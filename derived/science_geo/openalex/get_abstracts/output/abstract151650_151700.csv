https://openalex.org/W2166903671,"Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) directs the sequence-specific degradation of mRNA through a process known as RNA interference (RNAi). Using a recently developed Drosophila in vitro system, we examined the molecular mechanism underlying RNAi. We find that RNAi is ATP dependent yet uncoupled from mRNA translation. During the RNAi reaction, both strands of the dsRNA are processed to RNA segments 21–23 nucleotides in length. Processing of the dsRNA to the small RNA fragments does not require the targeted mRNA. The mRNA is cleaved only within the region of identity with the dsRNA. Cleavage occurs at sites 21–23 nucleotides apart, the same interval observed for the dsRNA itself, suggesting that the 21–23 nucleotide fragments from the dsRNA are guiding mRNA cleavage."

Conditional transgenic models of neurodegenerative diseases therefore could be a powerful means to explore the relationship between mutant protein expression and progression of the disease. We have created a conditional model of HD by using the tet-regulatable system. Mice expressing a mutated huntingtin fragment demonstrate neuronal inclusions, characteristic neuropathology, and progressive motor dysfunction. Blockade of expression in symptomatic mice leads to a disappearance of inclusions and an amelioration of the behavioral phenotype. We thus demonstrate that a continuous influx of the mutant protein is required to maintain inclusions and symptoms, raising the possibility that HD may be reversible."
https://openalex.org/W2003111769,"We have determined the crystal structure of a complex between the I domain of integrin alpha2beta1 and a triple helical collagen peptide containing a critical GFOGER motif. Three loops on the upper surface of the I domain that coordinate a metal ion also engage the collagen, with a collagen glutamate completing the coordination sphere of the metal. Comparison with the unliganded I domain reveals a change in metal coordination linked to a reorganization of the upper surface that together create a complementary surface for binding collagen. Conformational changes propagate from the upper surface to the opposite pole of the domain, suggesting both a basis for affinity regulation and a pathway for signal transduction. The structural features observed here may represent a general mechanism for integrin-ligand recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2020992585,"We present evidence that Rb forms a repressor containing histone deacetylase (HDAC) and the hSWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling complex, which inhibits transcription of genes for cyclins E and A and arrests cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin D/cdk4 disrupts association with HDAC, relieving repression of the cyclin E gene and G1 arrest. However, the Rb-hSWI/SNF complex persists and is sufficient to maintain repression of the cyclin A and cdc2 genes, inhibiting exit from S phase. HDAC-Rb-hSWI/SNF and Rb-hSWI/SNF then appear to maintain the order of cyclin E and A expression during the cell cycle, which in turn regulates exit from G1 and from S phase, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2043107604,"The tumor suppressor gene p53 regulates multiple cellular responses to DNA damage, but the transcriptional targets that specify these responses are incompletely understood. We describe a Drosophila p53 homolog and demonstrate that it can activate transcription from a promoter containing binding sites for human p53. Dominant-negative forms of Drosophila p53 inhibit both transactivation in cultured cells and radiation-induced apoptosis in developing tissues. The cis-regulatory region of the proapoptotic gene reaper contains a radiation-inducible enhancer that includes a consensus p53 binding site. Drosophila p53 can activate transcription from this site in yeast and a multimer of this site is sufficient for radiation induction in vivo. These results indicate that reaper is a direct transcriptional target of Drosophila p53 following DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W1984755213,"The importance of p53 in carcinogenesis stems from its central role in inducing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to cellular stresses. We have identified a Drosophila homolog of p53 (""Dmp53""). Like mammalian p53, Dmp53 binds specifically to human p53 binding sites, and overexpression of Dmp53 induces apoptosis. Importantly, inhibition of Dmp53 function renders cells resistant to X ray-induced apoptosis, suggesting that Dmp53 is required for the apoptotic response to DNA damage. Unlike mammalian p53, Dmp53 appears unable to induce a G1 cell cycle block when overexpressed, and inhibition of Dmp53 activity does not affect X ray-induced cell cycle arrest. These data reveal an ancestral proapoptotic function for p53 and identify Drosophila as an ideal model system for elucidating the p53 apoptotic pathway(s) induced by DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2038468714,"Interleukin-6 is involved in the regulation of many biological activities such as gene expression, cell proliferation, and differentiation. The control of the termination of cytokine signaling is as important as the regulation of initiation of signal transduction pathways. Three families of proteins involved in the down-regulation of cytokine signaling have been described recently: (i) SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatases (SHP), (ii) suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS), and (iii) protein inhibitors of activated STATs (PIAS). We have analyzed the interplay of two inhibitors in the signal transduction pathway of interleukin-6 and demonstrate that the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 and SOCS3 do not act independently but are functionally linked. The activation of one inhibitor modulates the activity of the other; Inhibition of SHP2 activation leads to increased SOCS3-mRNA levels, whereas increased expression of SOCS3 results in a reduction of SHP2 phosphorylation after activation of the interleukin-6 signal transduction pathway. Furthermore, we show that tyrosine 759 in gp130 is essential for both SHP2 and SOCS3 but not for SOCS1 to exert their inhibitory activities on interleukin-6 signal transduction. Besides SHP2, SOCS3 also interacts with the Tyr(P)-759 peptide of gp130. Taken together, our results suggest differences in the function of SOCS1 and SOCS3 and a link between SHP2 and SOCS3.

After ligand binding and gp130 dimer formation, constitutively associated kinases of the Janus family Jak1, Jak2, and tyrosine kinase 2 become activated by autophosphorylation. gp130, subsequently tyrosine phosphorylated on its cytoplasmic tail, recruits the transcription factors of the family of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT1 and STAT3) (2.Lütticken C.

In turn, these signaling components become tyrosine-phosphorylated also. Jak1 has been described to be crucial for the activation of gp130, the STAT factors (7.Guschin D. Rogers N. Briscoe J. Witthuhn B. Watling D. Horn F. Pellegrini S. Yasukawa K. Heinrich P. Stark G.R. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1421-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), and SHP2 (8.Schaper F. Gendo C. Eck M. Schmitz J. Grimm C. Anhuf D. Kerr I.M. Heinrich P.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The tyrosine-phosphorylated STATs form homo- and/or heterodimers (9.Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar) and translocate to the nucleus where they bind to enhancer elements of interleukin-6 inducible genes (10.Wegenka U.M. Buschmann J. Lütticken C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The Jak/STAT signal transduction pathway is under negative control by several different mechanisms. The presence of a nuclear phosphatase leading to dephosphorylation of activated STAT1 has been proposed by Haspel et al. (11.Haspel R.L. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6262-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). These authors observed a quantitative recycling of dephosphorylated STAT1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm implicating a circulation of STAT factors between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. These data contradict those of Kim and Maniatis (12.Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) who demonstrated a proteasome-dependent loss of activated STAT1 in the nucleus. Recently, another group of IL-6 signaling inhibitors has been described, STAT-binding proteins, known as protein inhibitors of activated STATs (PIAS) (13.Chung C.D. Liao J.Y. Liu B. Rao X.P. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 14.Liu B. Liao J.Y. Rao X.P. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Although the PIAS do not contain phosphotyrosine binding domains such as SH2 or PTB domains, they associate with activated, tyrosine-phosphorylated STATs, leading to a loss of STAT-DNA binding activity. The mechanism of this highly specific interaction of protein inhibitor of activated STATs with activated STAT factors remains to be elucidated. Another new family of inhibitors of cytokine signaling has been discovered in three different laboratories, recently. These proteins are referred to as suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) (15.Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar), Jak-binding proteins (16.Endo T.A. Masuhara M. Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Sakamoto H. Mitsui K. Matsumoto A. Tanimura S. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyazaki T. Leonor N. Taniguchi T. Fujita T. Kanakura Y. Komiya S. Yoshimura A. Nature. 1997; 387: 921-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar), or STAT-induced STAT inhibitors (17.Naka T. Narazaki M. Hirata M. Matsumoto T. Minamoto S. Aono A. Nishimoto N. Kajita T. Taga T. Yoshizaki K. Akira S. Kishimoto T. Nature. 1997; 387: 924-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). The members of this family contain a central SH2 domain as well as a carboxyl-terminal domain called the SOCS box. Depending on the cell type examined, SOCS1, SOCS2, and SOCS3 expression was found to be rapidly induced by IL-6. Because the SOCS proteins inhibit the IL-6-induced phosphorylation of Janus kinases, gp130 and STAT factors, they are regarded as feedback inhibitors of IL-6 signaling. SOCS1 inhibits the kinase activity of the three Janus kinases Jak1, Jak2, and tyrosine kinase 2 involved in IL-6 signaling (15.Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar, 16.Endo T.A. Masuhara M. Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Sakamoto H.

Kishimoto T. Nature. 1997; 387: 924-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been described that SOCS1 binds to phosphotyrosine 1007 within the kinase domain of activated Jak2 (18.Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T. Ohtsuka S. Imaizumi T. Matsuda T. Ihle J.N. Yoshimura A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Also, the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 was found to inhibit IL-6 signal transduction. Activation of the IL-6 receptor complex leads to a recruitment of SHP2 to tyrosine 759 in gp130 and to its subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation (4.Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). SHP2 activation is a crucial event for the induction of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway upon IL-6 stimulation (19.Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashitezuka M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Mutation of Tyr-759 in gp130 results in an enhanced and prolonged STAT1 and STAT3 activation and in an increased gene induction (8.Schaper F. Gendo C. Eck M. Schmitz J. Grimm C. Anhuf D. Kerr I.M. Heinrich P.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 20.Symes A. Stahl N. Reeves S.A. Farruggella T. Servidei T. Gearan T. Yancopoulos G. Fink J.S. Curr.

Kishimoto T. Nature. 1997; 387: 924-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar) and SHP2 is simultaneously activated (4.Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), we asked whether these proteins influence each other in respect to expression (SOCS3) or tyrosine phosphorylation (SHP2). We observed that an inhibition of SHP2 activation led to an enhanced induction of SOCS3 mRNA. On the other hand the expression of the SOCS3 protein decreased the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated SHP2 after IL-6 stimulation. Furthermore, we found that SOCS3, but not SOCS1, requires the SHP2 recruitment site in gp130 to exert its negative function on the IL-6 signal transduction pathway. Finally, it is demonstrated in the present study that both SHP2 and SOCS3 interact with a phosphotyrosine peptide containing the Tyr-759 motif of gp130. Although we demonstrate an SHP2-SOCS3 protein-protein interaction, we were also able to show that binding of SOCS3 to Tyr-759 of gp130 does not depend on the presence of SHP2.

Antibodies to the Tyr-705-phosphorylated STAT3 and Tyr-701-phosphorylated STAT1 were purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA), and antibodies to SHP2 and GST from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10) were from Upstate Laboratories (Lake Placid, NY), and anti-Flag-antibodies were from Sigma. Recombinant IL-6 and sIL-6R were prepared as described (22.Weiergräber O. Hemmann U. Küster A. Müller-Newen G. Schneider J. Rose-John S. Kurschat P. Brakenhoff J.P.J. Hart M.H.L. Stabel S.

Gendo C. Eck M. Schmitz J. Grimm C. Anhuf D. Kerr I.M. Heinrich P.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The DNA fragments encoding the EpoR/gp130 chimeric receptors were also transferred into pRc/CMV-EG and used for expression in HepG2 cells (pRc/CMV-EG(YYYYYY) and pRc/CMV-EG(YFYYYY)). The DNA fragments coding for the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the chimeric receptors were introduced into pSVL-gp130 resulting in expression vectors for wild type gp130 (pSVL-gp130(YYYYYY)) and for gp130 with a tyrosine to phenylalanine exchange at position 759 (pSVL-gp130(YFYYYY)) (8.Schaper F.

The latter constructs were used for generating stably transfected Ba/F3 cells. The expression vectors for the SOCS or CIS proteins were pEF-Flag-I/mSOCS1, pEF-Flag-I/mSOCS2, pEF-Flag-I/mSOCS3, and pEF-Flag-I/hCIS (15.Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J. Rayner J.R.

The expression vector for GST-SOCS3-(23–151) was generated by insertion of the DNA fragment encoding amino acids 23–151 of SOCS3 into the GST fusion protein expression vector pGEX-5X-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA was isolated from cultured Ba/F3 cells by using the Qiagen total RNA kit (Qiagan, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer's instructions. Gel electrophoresis and Northern blot analysis were performed with 10 μg of total RNA as described previously (26.Gatsios P. Haubeck H.D. van der Leur E. Frisch W. Apte S.S. Greiling H. Heinrich P.C.

Human hepatoma cells HepG2 were grown and transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method as described previously (27.Yuan J. Wegenka U.M. Lütticken C. Buschmann J. Decker T.

Cell lysis and luciferase assays were carried out using the luciferase kit (Promega, Madison, WI) as described by the manufacturer's instructions. All transient expression experiments were done at least in triplicate. Luciferase activity values were normalized to transfection efficiency monitored by the cotransfected β-galactosidase expression vector (pCR3lacZ, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (1.5 μg). COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, and 60 mg/liter penicillin. Approximately 1.5 × 107COS7 cells were transiently transfected with 6–25 μg of DNA using the DEAE-dextran method. Briefly, cells were incubated in medium containing the DNA, 80 μm chloroquine, and 0.4 mg/ml DEAE-dextran for 80 min avoiding gas exchange. Afterward, cells were incubated for 1 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% Me2SO. After 24 h cells were split 1:2, and after an additional 24 h in culture medium cells were stimulated. Ba/F3 cells were grown and stably transfected as described previously (28.Horsten U. Müller-Newen G. Gerhartz C. Wollmer A. Wijdenes J. Heinrich P.C. Grötzinger J. J. Biol.

Equal surface expression levels of gp130 were verified by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis with the B-P4 antibody specific for the extracellular domain of gp130.

We used a STAT1- and STAT3-specific double-stranded 32P-labeled probe, a mutated SIE oligonucleotide of the c-fos promoter (m67 SIE, 5′-GATCCGGGAGGGATTTACGGGAAATGCTG-3′). Protein-DNA complexes were separated on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 7.5% glycerol in TBE (23 mm Tris, 23 mm boric acid, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) at 20 V/cm for 4 h. Gels were fixed in 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid, and 80% water for 30 min, dried, and autoradiographed. For immunoprecipitation 2 × 107 cells were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5; 150 mm NaCl; 1% Triton X-100; 10% glycerol; 1 mmEGTA; 1.5 mm MgCl2) or for peptide/protein coprecipitation in Brij-lysis buffer (1% Brij96; 20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mm NaCl; 1 mm EDTA). Buffers were supplemented with 10 μg/ml aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin. Equal amounts of cellular protein or 10 μg of purified GST fusion proteins were incubated with the appropriate antibodies or with 2 μm of biotinylated peptides at 4 °C overnight and precipitated with 2.5 mg of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or NeutrAvidine-coupled agarose (Pierce), respectively. Immune complexes were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylfluoride membrane. Antigens were detected by incubation with the appropriate primary antibodies (4G10, 1:1000; anti-SHP2, 1:1000; anti FlagM2-biotin, 1:500; anti-GST, 1:1000) and horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (1:2000) (Dako, Hamburg, Germany) or horseradish peroxidase-coupled streptavidine (1:5000) (Pierce). The membranes were developed with an enhanced chemoluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To verify application of equal amounts of protein, blots were stripped and reprobed. The expression GST-SOCS3-(23–151) was performed in Escherichia coli (BL21). Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in LB medium with ampicillin to an A 600 of 1.2 and treated with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) for 5 h at 20 °C to induce expression to the GST-SOCS3-(23–151) fusion protein. Cells were lysed by sonication, and purification was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To find out which of the IL-6-induced SOCS proteins interfere with the IL-6-stimulated induction of acute phase protein (APP) synthesis in liver cells, we tested whether SOCS1, SOCS2, SOCS3, or CIS expression affects APP gene promoter induction in human HepG2 hepatoma cells (Fig.1). The respective SOCS or CIS cDNAs were cotransfected together with a reporter gene construct harboring the promoter of the α2-macroglobulin gene linked to the luciferase reporter gene (pGL3α2M-215Luc) and an expression vector for a chimeric receptor containing the extracellular domain of the EpoR and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of gp130 (EG(YYYYYY)), which allowed us to study the IL-6 signal transduction pathway independently from endogenous gp130 (25.Gerhartz C. Heesel B. Sasse J. Hemmann U. Landgraf C. Schneider-Mergener J. Horn F. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12991-12998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Stimulation with erythropoietin led to a 20-fold induction of the reporter gene in the transiently transfected cells expressing the chimeric receptor in the absence of SOCS/CIS. Coexpression of SOCS1 or SOCS3 led to a dramatic reduction in APP gene promoter induction. Even the background level of reporter gene expression was reduced indicating that SOCS1 and SOCS3 also influence basal transcription in unstimulated cells. In contrast, SOCS2 and CIS had only moderate effects. Thus, SOCS1 and SOCS3 but neither SOCS2 nor CIS are potent inhibitors for acute phase protein gene induction by interleukin-6. SHP2 counteracts the IL-6-induced acute phase protein gene induction (8.Schaper F. Gendo C. Eck M. Schmitz J. Grimm C. Anhuf D. Kerr I.M. Heinrich P.C. Biochem.

To study the interplay of the IL-6 signal transduction inhibitors SOCS1, SOCS3, and SHP2, we asked whether SHP2 might also negatively regulate the IL-6-induced expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 (Fig. 2, A andB). Therefore, IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cells, which do not express endogenous gp130 (29.Murakami M. Narazaki M. Hibi M. Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Hamaguchi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11349-11353Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), were stably transfected with gp130 receptor mutant cDNAs. Receptor surface expression of the transfected Ba/F3 cells was monitored by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis with an antibody raised against the extracellular domain of gp130 and was found to be comparable for all transfectants (Fig. 2 C). Stimulation of cells expressing the wild type receptor gp130(YYYYYY) led to a rapid induction of SOCS3 mRNA as determined in Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2 A). The data were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-mRNA levels (Fig. 2 B). There was no detectable induction of SOCS1 mRNA in Ba/F3 cells (data not shown). Stimulation of cells carrying a mutation of the SHP2 recruitment site in gp130 by a substitution of Tyr-759 to Phe (gp130(YFYYYY)) resulted in increased SOCS3 mRNA levels compared with the wild type receptor. The single tyrosine 759 in the cytoplasmic part of gp130 (gp130(FYFFFF)) was not sufficient to mediate induction of the SOCS3 gene. These observations indicate that SHP2 activation counteracts SOCS3 gene expression. To test whether SOCS3 counteracts SHP2 phosphorylation, COS7 cells were transiently transfected with SOCS3 expression vectors. SHP2 phosphorylation after stimulation with IL-6·sIL6R-complexes was analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 3). Coexpression of SOCS3 led to a reduced SHP2 phosphorylation compared with cells not transfected with SOCS3-cDNA. We conclude from these data that SOCS3 also regulates signaling components, which themselves are negative regulators of the IL-6 signal transduction pathway. SOCS1 interacts with the kinase domain of activated Jak2 (16.Endo T.A. Masuhara M. Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Sakamoto H. Mitsui K. Matsumoto A. Tanimura S. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyazaki T. Leonor N.

Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). On the other hand, only a weak association of Jak2 with SOCS3 has been described by Suzuki et al. (31.Suzuki R. Sakamoto H. Yasukawa H. Masuhara M. Wakioka T. Sasaki A. Yuge K. Komiya S. Inoue A. Yoshimura A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2271-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Unlike SOCS1, SOCS3 does not inhibit Jak kinase activity in vitro(30.Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Farley A. Starr R. Zhang J.G. Baca M. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). To learn more about the mechanism of action of SOCS3, we tested whether SOCS3 activity depends on the activation of SHP2 and examined the potential of SOCS1 and SOCS3 to inhibit acute phase protein gene induction in the presence or absence of tyrosine 759 in gp130. Therefore, chimeric EpoR/gp130 wild type or mutant receptors were expressed in HepG2 cells together with or without SOCS1/SOCS3. Reporter gene assays similar to those described above were performed (Fig.4). Mutation of Tyr-759 in gp130 to Phe led to an enhanced APP promoter/reporter gene induction as expected from previously described experiments (8.Schaper F. Gendo C. Eck M. Schmitz J. Grimm C. Anhuf D. Kerr I.M. Heinrich P.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) (compare YYYYYY with YFYYYY). Both the expression of SOCS1 (Fig. 4 A,left part) or SOCS3 (Fig. 4 B, left part) led to reduced levels of the reporter luciferase activity upon stimulation of the wild type receptor EG(YYYYYY). Interestingly, unlike SOCS1, SOCS3 was unable to reduce APP gene promoter induction in the absence of Tyr-759 (EG(YFYYYY)) (Fig. 4 B,right part). Rather a slightly enhanced luciferase activity was measured after expression of SOCS3. Thus, SOCS3 but not SOCS1 requires the SHP2 recruitment site, i.e. Tyr-759 in gp130 to exert its inhibitory effect on acute phase protein gene induction. To further confirm the requirement of Tyr-759 in gp130 for SOCS3 action, we asked whether the SOCS3-mediated reduction of STAT1/STAT3 activation (15.Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J.

Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). The functional domains of the AR (termed A-F) are conserved with other members of the “classical” receptor subclass, which includes receptors for estrogens, progestins, glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoids. Nuclear receptors may direct the assembly and stabilization of a pre-initiation complex at a target gene promoter through forming direct associations with the basal transcription apparatus and with hormone dependent cofactors (3.Beato M. Sanchez-Pacheco A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 587-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Although interactions between nuclear receptors and components of the basal transcription apparatus including the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and TAFII30 (4.Sadovsky Y. Webb P. Lopez G. Baxter J.D.

The coactivator proteins cAMP-response element-binding protein (CBP) and the related functional homologue p300 (6.Janknecht T. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 383: 22-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) regulate gene expression through several distinct mechanisms. p300/CBP may serve a bridging function between the DNA-bound transcription factor and the basal apparatus because p300/CBP interacts with TATA-binding protein (7.Dallas P.B.

Secondly, p300/CBP provides a scaffold interacting with numerous transcription factors through dedicated domains to assemble high molecular weight “enhanceosomes” (reviewed in Ref. 10.Giordano A. Avantaggiati M.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 218-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Thirdly, the cointegrator proteins p300/CBP share the capacity to acetylate histones, which correlates with their transcriptional coactivator function (11.Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bannister A.J. Martin K. Haus-Seuffert P. Meisterernst M. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2886-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In these circumstances acetylation facilitates binding of transcription factors to specific target DNA sequences by destabilizing nucleosomes bound to the promoter region of a target gene (12.Bannister A.J.

Separable intrinsic and “associated” histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity functions have been identified, and the p300/CBP-associated factor (P/CAF) can direct the associated acetylase function (16.Yang X.-J.

Transcription factor acetylation can have divergent and context-dependent effects on DNA binding and function (18.Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T.

In contrast CBP repressed the transcriptional activity of T cell factor (24.Walter L. Bienz M. Nature. 1998; 395: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), and acetylation of HMG1(Y) by CBP decreased its sequence-specific DNA binding (25.Munshi N. Merika M. Yie J. Senger K. Chen G.

In this report we demonstrate that AR activity is induced by either trichostatin A (TSA) (a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase activity) or the HAT-containing transcriptional coactivators p300 and P/CAF. p300 and P/CAF acetylated the AR on conserved lysines carboxyl-terminal to the zinc finger DNA-binding domain.

The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. 90 pmol of [14C]acetyl-CoA reaction were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and viewed following autoradiography of the gel. In addition, [14C]acetyl incorporation into the substrates was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The reaction mixture was spotted onto Whatman P-81 phosphocellulose filter paper. The filter paper was air-dried for 2–5 min and washed with 0.2 m sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.2) at room temperature with five changes of the buffer for a total of 30 min. The dried filter paper was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. In vitro protein-protein interactions were performed as described (36.Neuman E. Ladha M.H. Lin N. Upton T.M. Miller S.J. DiRenzo J. Pestell R.G. Hinds P.W. Dowdy S.F. Brown M. Ewen M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5338-5347Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The in vitro translated protein (15 μl of AR), 1 μg of rabbit anti-AR polyclonal antibody (N20), and 5 μg of purified Flag-tagged baculovirus-expressed P/CAF were incubated in 300 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 120 mmNaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin) and rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. The mixture was incubated with 30 μl of protein A-agarose beads and rotated overnight at 4 °C. In the polypeptide competition experiments, the AR1 polypeptide or control peptide (1 nm) was co-incubated with the AR-P/CAF mix. Beads were washed four times with 1 ml of binding buffer, and 30 μl of binding buffer were added after the final wash. 6 μl of 6× SDS loading buffer were added, and the sample was denatured at 95 °C and subjected ot electrophoresis on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was fixed with 25% isopropyl alcohol and 10% acetic acid for 15 min, washed with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min to enhance the 14C signal, and dried for 1 h at 80 °C, and autoradiography was performed at −70 °C using XAR ALF 2025 autoradiography film (LabScientific Inc., Livingston, NJ). The radioactivity was quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics phosphorImager and the ImageQuant software. In vitroacetylation assays were performed as described previously (37.Boyes J. Byfield P. Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Nature. 1998; 396: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide corresponding to the androgen receptor (AR1 residues 623 to 640), NH2-GMTLGARKLKKLGNLKLQ-OH, and a control polypeptide, NH2-ELVHMINWAKRVPGFVDL-OH, were synthesized by Biosynthesis (Lewisville, TX). The peptide was acetylated in vitro by incubating with 5 mm acetyl-CoA and baculovirus-purified Flag-p300 at 30 °C for 1 h. After incubation acetylated peptides were separated from contaminating p300 by passage through a 10-micron filter (Amicon) and further purified by analytical reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The reaction products were analyzed with a PE Biosystems DE-STR matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometer. Further analysis by Edman degradation was performed on a PE-Biosystems Procise sequencer. The amount of phenylthiohydantoin-acetyl-lysine was measured by absorbance at 259 nm. Previous studies demonstrated that CBP induced AR activity in CV1 cells (38.Aarnisalo P. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2122-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We examined the role of p300 in inducing AR activity in cultured prostate cancer cells. p300 augmented AR activity 2- to 3-fold. The addition of 10−7m DHT induced AR activity 7.5-fold. p300 augmented DHT-induced AR activity approximately 2-fold (Fig. 1 A) Regulation of transcription of certain promoters can be due to p300/CBP acetyltransferase activity (39.Kouzarides T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). To determine whether acetylation plays a role in regulating the activity of the androgen-responsive enhancer in prostate cancer cells, we assayed the sensitivity of the MMTV-LUC to trichostatin A, a specific inhibitor of deacetylase activity (40.Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Briefly, the MMTV-LUC was co-transfected with an expression vector for the human AR into DU145 cells in the presence or absence of TSA. As shown in Fig. 1 B, TSA enhanced activity of the MMTV-LUC reporter in a dose-dependent manner to a maximum of 4-fold (Fig. 1 B) and did not affect the activity of the pA3LUC reporter (data not shown). Significantly, a more dramatic effect of TSA was seen when cells transfected with the MMTV-LUC reporter and AR were treated with the ligand for AR, DHT (Fig. 1 C). In this case, the activity of the MMTV-LUC reporter was superinduced by TSA by approximately 20-fold, thus implying that DHT is rate-limiting in vivo. Together, these results indicate that the activity of endogenous deacetylase(s) might constrain the achievement of full activation potential by AR-regulated promoters. These studies suggested that DHT-induced AR activity is regulated by both endogenous histone deacetylase activity and by acetyltransferase containing transcriptional coactivators. Because p300 can regulate transcription factor activity through direct acetylation (18.Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 325-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 19.Liu L. Scolnick D.M. Trievel R.C. Zhang H.B. Marmorstein R. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1999; 19: 3496-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), we scrutinized the amino acid sequence of the AR for potential acetylation sites. Residues 623–640 are homologous to a RXKK motif acetylated by p300 in p53 and GATA-1 (Fig.2 A). The AR RXKK motif is highly conserved between different species and is located just carboxyl-terminal to the zinc finger DNA-binding domain. To determine whether the AR could be acetylated by p300 in vitro, purified GST·AR fusion proteins were exposed to p300 immunoprecipitated from cultured cells, and in vitroacetylation assays were performed (12.Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). Strikingly, endogenous p300 acetylated the AR fusion proteins, which included the acetylation site (GST·AR-(503–637) and GST·AR-(550–633)) (Fig. 2 C). Acetylation was not observed using equal amounts of GST protein (Fig.2 C, lane 1). The GST·AR-(1–614) and GST·AR-(676–919), which did not include the putative acetylation site, were not acetylated by p300 (Fig. 2 D). The [14C]acetate incorporation for each AR fusion protein was measured by the filter binding assay (Fig. 2 E). To determine whether the AR was acetylated in vivo, immunoprecipitation was performed using an anti-acetyl lysine antibody on cell extracts derived from cells transfected with the human AR expression vector (41.Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bauer U.-M. Nielson S.S.J.J. Brehm A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitate was subjected to Western blotting with an AR-specific antibody (Fig. 2 F). An AR-immunoreactive band was identified in the anti-acetyl-lysine antibody IP of identical mobility to the band identified in the AR IP, whereas no AR immunoreactivity was observed in the IgG control IP. Together these studies suggest that the AR is modified by acetylation at lysine residues in cultured cells. To identify the residues acetylated in the AR carboxyl terminus, a peptide, AR-(623–640), was synthesized and used as substrate for acetylation by p300 (Fig. 3 A). Mass analysis confirmed the presence of two major ions differing by 42 mass units (Fig. 3 B). The lower molecular weight product X corresponds to the unmodified AR peptide, whereas the higher molecular weight component Y corresponds to the acetylated AR product. To determine the functional significance of lysines 632/633, these residues were mutated to alanines in the context of the wild type AR to create the mutant plasmid AR-K632A/K633A. The wild type and mutant AR were transfected into AR-deficient cultured cells treated with DHT (10−7m), and Western blotting was performed for AR expression. Similar amounts of wild type and mutant AR were expressed as confirmed by normalization of transfer using the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor antibody (Fig.4 A). The wild type and mutant AR were immunoprecipitated from transfected cells and used as substrates for in vitro p300-dependent14C-acetylation assays. Equal amounts of wild type and mutant AR were identified by Western blotting of the AR immunoprecipitate (data not shown). Baculovirus-expressed p300 acetylated the wild type but not the AR K632A/K633A mutant. These studies demonstrate that the lysines 632 and 633 are required for full acetylation of the AR by p300 (Fig. 4 B). In previous studies of p53, acetylation analysis using Edman degradation had identified the capacity of lysines outside the RXKK motif to undergo in vitro acetylation, although mutation of these residues demonstrated redundancy and abrogated acetylation by CBP (21.Hung H.L. Lau J. Kim A.Y. Weiss M.J. Blobel G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3496-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Following in vitroacetylation of the AR peptide by p300, Edman degradation assays were performed. The results indicate that lysines 630, 632, and 633 were preferentially acetylated (Fig. 4 C). Only monoacetylated lysine-containing peptides were detected in the samples by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry, indicating that the product analyzed by Edman degradation was a heterogeneous population of peptides each acetylated at a single site. As mutation of lysine 632/633 completely abolished acetylation, it is likely that alanine mutations might prevent recognition of the acetylation motif by HAT or render lysine 630 inaccessible. p300/CBP and P/CAF have been shown to acetylate differentially select substrates (42.Schiltz R.L. Mizzen C.A. Vassilev A. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Nakatani Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1189-1192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). We therefore assessed p300 mutants that were either competent or defective in P/CAF binding for their effect on AR activity. The CH3 region of p300 interacts with P/CAF. Deletion of the CH3 region (Δ1737–1809) reduced p300 augmentation of AR activity by 30 to 40% (Fig.5 A). P/CAF has intrinsic HAT activity (16.Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar) located within a domain adjacent to the Ada2 homology region (Fig. 5 B) (43.Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Martinez-Balbas M.A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4469-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). AR activity was induced by P/CAF overexpression; however, the P/CAF HAT domain deletion mutant (P/CAF Δ609–624) reduced AR-induced activity by 45% (Fig. 5 B). The P/CAF wild type and mutant protein P/CAF Δ609–624 (ΔB) were expressed equally in DU145 cells by Western blotting using the anti-Flag antibody (data not shown). To determine whether P/CAF bound AR and to determine the domains of P/CAF required for binding, assays were performed using affinity-purified P/CAF andin vitro translated AR (Fig.6 A). Detection of P/CAF and AR was performed by Western blotting. The AR bound to P/CAF (>5% of input, shown as +++ in Fig. 6 A). An internal deletion mutant of the amino terminus Δ5–122 and deletions affecting the carboxyl terminus of P/CAF and the Ada2 homology region significantly reduced binding to the AR. Thus, the amino terminus and the carboxyl terminus including the bromo domain of P/CAF are required for full binding to the androgen receptor. In vitro acetylation assays were performed using GST·AR and the baculovirus-expressed P/CAF. In the presence of GST only the14C-labeled band corresponding to autoacetylated P/CAF was observed. The GST·AR-(550–633) was strongly acetylated by P/CAF (Fig. 6 B). The addition of DHT (10−7m) did not affect [14C]acetyl-CoA incorporation into the AR. Because P/CAF bound and was capable of acetylating the AR, we examined the possibility that the peptide encoding the AR acetylation motif (AR residues 623–640) could compete with P/CAF binding to the AR. The AR was synthesized in vitro and incubated with full-length baculovirus-produced P/CAF. Co-incubation was performed in the presence of either the AR peptide (623–640) or a polypeptide of equal size but incapable of being acetylated in vitro, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The AR-P/CAF co-incubated mix was subjected to IP with the AR antibody, the complex was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Western blotting was performed with an antibody directed to the Flag epitope of the P/CAF protein. P/CAF binding to the AR was reduced by pre-incubation with the AR polypeptide (Fig. 6 C) but not by equal molar amounts of the control peptide (data not shown). Together these studies demonstrate that the P/CAF HAT domain is required for induction of AR activity, that P/CAF binds the AR, and that P/CAF is sufficient for acetylation of the AR in vitro. To assess the role of lysines 632/633 in AR transcriptional regulation, the AR-responsive MMTV-LUC reporter was used in transient expression studies in the AR-deficient prostate cancer cell line DU145. As noted above (Fig. 4 A), the expression of the AR K632A/K633A mutant was similar to wild type in these cells. Activation of the AR K632A/K633A mutant by DHT was substantially reduced compared with wild type (Fig.7 A, lane 5 versus lane 6). p300 overexpression induced basal AR activity. However, the effect of p300 on DHT-induced activity was reduced to 50% of wild type. This finding is consistent with a role for acetylation in ligand-induced activation of the AR. Co-transfection of P/CAF augmented DHT-induced AR activity from 5- to 7.3-fold (Fig.7 B, lane 5 versus lane 6). In contrast the AR K632A/K633A mutant was defective in P/CAF augmentation of DHT-induced activity (compare lane 4 withlane 8). Together these findings demonstrate that the acetylation-defective AR K632A/K633A mutant is reduced in DHT-induced function in cultured cells. Edman degradation had identified residue 630 as a candidate for direct acetylation (Fig. 4 C). Because these studies suggested that acetylation was linked to ligand-induced activation of the AR, a point mutation of residue 630 (AR K630A) was performed, and the effect of this substitution on ligand responsiveness was assessed. The AR K630A mutant was expressed equally with wild type by Western blotting of transfected cells (data not shown); however, the induction by DHT (10−7m) was reduced by 95%. Together these studies suggest that each of the AR lysine residues acetylated in vitro contribute to full induction of AR activity by DHT. In recent studies a small number of non-histone proteins including p53 (35.Gu W. Roeder R.G.

Nature. 1998; 396: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), erythroid Kruppel-like factor (20.Zhang W. Bieker J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9855-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar),Xenopus NF-Y (45.Li Q. Herrler M. Landsberger N. Kaludov N. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6300-6315Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and the human immunodeficiency virus transactivator protein (46.Kiernan R. Vanhulle C. Schiltz L. Adam E. Xiao H. Maudoux F. Calomne C. Burny A. Nakatani Y. Jeang K.-T. Benkirane M. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6106-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) were identified as HAT substrates. Acetylation enhanced the activity of these transcriptional regulators through a conserved acetylation motif. Transcriptional activity of the AR is regulated by coactivators with intrinsic HAT activity, and we identified the presence of a candidate acetylation motif within the AR (Fig. 1 A). The formal possibility that the AR functioned as a direct substrate for histone acetylation to regulate ligand-dependent activity had not previously been examined. The current studies are the first to demonstrate a critical role for acetylation in ligand-induced activation of the AR. The current study demonstrated that ligand-induced AR function was enhanced by p300 and by P/CAF in prostate cancer cell lines. The coactivators p300/CBP and the p300/CBP-associated factors such as P/CAF contain intrinsic HAT activity (12.Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar, 13.Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar). We found that p300 acetylated GST·AR fusion proteins that included a conserved acetylation motif (RXKK) and failed to acetylate other regions of the AR expressed as GST fusions. Mass spectrometry confirmed that the AR polypeptide (residues 623–640) was acetylated in vitro by p300. Mutation of lysines 632 and 633 abrogated acetylation of the full-length AR protein. The RXKK motif of the AR is highly conserved between species (Fig. 2 A). The site of acetylation in the AR resembles the carboxyl-terminal acetylation motif of p53 and the GATA-1 acetylation site. Point mutation of two lysines within the GATA-1 acetylation motif abolished in vitro acetylation. The AR acetylation motif is located immediately carboxyl-terminal to the zinc finger DNA-binding domain, and the GATA-1 acetylation motif is immediately amino-terminal to its zinc finger binding domain. In the current study, p300 or P/CAF acetylated the AR in vitro. Co-transfection analyses, however, suggested that the CH3 region of p300, which binds P/CAF, rather than the HAT domain was required for full augmentation of DHT-induced activity. P/CAF also enhanced DHT-induced AR activity, and the P/CAF HAT domain was required for full induction. These findings suggest that p300-associated P/CAF HAT activity may contribute to AR acetylation and augment DHT-induced AR function in cultured cells but that P/CAF-independent activities of p300 probably contribute to AR induction. Baculovirus-expressed P/CAF bound the AR in pull-down experiments and was sufficient for AR acetylation. Deletion analysis of P/CAF demonstrated a critical role for the amino terminus and the carboxyl-terminal bromo and Ada2 domains for binding to the AR. The AR peptide (AR-(623–640)), which was acetylated by P/CAF, also competed with P/CAF for binding to the AR, suggesting that the acetylated motif of the AR probably contacts P/CAF. The solution structure of the P/CAF bromo domain revealed an unusual left-handed up and down four helix bundle (47.Dhalluin C. Carlson J. Zeng L. He C. Aggarwal A. Zhou M. Nature. 1999; 399: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). Furthermore the bromo domain module was shown to specifically interact with acetylated lysines (47.Dhalluin C. Carlson J. Zeng L. He C. Aggarwal A. Zhou M. Nature. 1999; 399: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). Together with our study, these findings are consistent with a model in which the P/CAF bromo domain may contact the acetylated lysines of the AR. This study does not preclude the possibility that other HATs may also regulate AR acetylation and function. There is considerable substrate specificity among the different acetyltransferases. P/CAF does not acetylate GATA-1 (21.Hung H.L. Lau J. Kim A.Y. Weiss M.J. Blobel G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3496-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and the carboxyl-terminal acetylation site of p53 is preferentially acetylated by p300 compared with P/CAF (19.Liu L. Scolnick D.M. Trievel R.C. Zhang H.B. Marmorstein R. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1202-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Acetylation, through neutralizing positively charged lysines, is predicted to affect conformation and thereby protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions. Acetylation of p53 by P/CAF or p300 enhanced DNA binding (35.Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar), whereas p300 acetylation of erythroid Kruppel-like factor did not alter its DNA binding properties (20.Zhang W. Bieker J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9855-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). GATA-1 acetylation affected DNA binding in one study (37.Boyes J. Byfield P. Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Nature. 1998; 396: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), but this effect was not observed in another study (21.Hung H.L. Lau J. Kim A.Y. Weiss M.J. Blobel G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3496-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). P/CAF-mediated AR acetylation may enhance transcriptional activity by affecting DNA binding or interactions with other proteins. In addition to post-translational modification by acetylation at lysines within residues 630–633 as demonstrated in this study, the AR is also phosphorylated (48.Blok L.J. de Ruiter P.E. Brinkmann A.O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3850-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the current study TSA augmented basal and DHT-induced AR activity, consistent with a model in which histone deacetylases repress AR function. Regulation of transcription by histone deacetylase inhibitors, such as TSA, is in part mediated through activation of serine/threonine protein kinases and phosphatases (49.Espinos E. Le Van Thai A. Pomies C. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3474-3484Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrated that phosphorylation-acetylation cascades regulate p53 function in response to DNA damage (44.Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). AR phosphorylation is ligand-regulated, and a phosphorylation-acetylation cascade regulating DHT-dependent AR function remains a formal possibility. Although speculative at this time, it is plausible that activity of other nuclear receptors may be governed through direct acetylation and phosphorylation. We thank Dr. D. Livingston for reagents and helpful discussion."

Tocotrienols were more effective than α-tocopherol in preventing glutamate-induced death. Uptake of tocotrienols from the culture medium was more efficient compared with that of α-tocopherol.

Traber M.G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1145-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). Compared with tocopherols, tocotrienols have been poorly studied (2.Traber M.G. Packer L. Am. J. Clin.

Tocotrienols are minor plant constituents especially abundant in palm oil, cereal grains, and rice bran that can provide a significant source of vitamin E activity. Tocotrienols differ from tocopherols by possessing a farnesyl (isoprenoid) rather than a saturated phytyl side chain. Dietary tocotrienols become incorporated into circulating human lipoproteins where they react with peroxyl radicals as efficiently as the corresponding tocopherol isomers (4.Suarna C. Hood R.L.

Consistently, tocotrienol supplementation has been reported to influence beneficially the course of carotid atherosclerosis in humans (6.Tomeo A.C. Geller M. Watkins T.R. Gapor A. Bierenbaum M.L. Lipids. 1995; 30: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Following supplementation to humans, the level of α-tocotrienol in the plasma has been estimated to be 0.98 ± 0.8 μm (7.O'Byrne D. Traber M.G. Packer L. Grundy S. Jialal I. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 536Google Scholar). A possible neuroprotective property of tocotrienols was indicated in a study testing the efficacy of the tocotrienol-rich fraction from palm oil to protect against oxidative damage of rat brain mitochondria. The tocotrienol-rich fraction from palm oil was significantly more effective than α-tocopherol in protecting the brain against damage caused by exposure to ascorbate-Fe2+, the free radical initiator azobis(2-amidopropane)dihydrochloride, or photosensitization. (8.Kamat J.P. Devasagayam T.P. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 195: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). At concentrations 25–50 μm, α-tocopherol is known to regulate signal transduction pathways by mechanisms that are independent of its antioxidant properties. α-Tocopherol, but not β-tocopherol having comparable antioxidant properties, inhibited inducible protein kinase C activity in smooth muscle cells (9.Azzi A.

Azzi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The signal transduction regulatory properties of tocotrienols, however, are yet unknown. ROS1 represent a major contributor to brain damage in disorders such as epilepsy (11.Kabuto H. Yokoi I. Ogawa N. Epilepsia. 1998; 39: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 12.Mahle C.

Freeman T.B. Cahill D.W. Sanberg P.R. J. Fla. Med. Assoc. 1996; 83: 335-341PubMed Google Scholar), Alzheimer's (18.Smith M.A. Sayre L.M. Anderson V.E. Harris P.L. Beal M.F. Kowall N. Perry G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), and Parkinson's. In the pathogenesis of these diseases, oxidative damage may accumulate over a period of years leading to massive neuronal loss. Glutamate toxicity is a major contributor to pathological cell death within the nervous system and appears to be mediated by ROS (19.Coyle J.T. Puttfarcken P. Science. 1993; 262: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (3533) Google Scholar). There are two forms of glutamate toxicity as follows: receptor-initiated excitotoxicity (20.Choi D.W. Cerebrovasc. Brain Metab. Rev. 1990; 2: 105-147PubMed Google Scholar) and non-receptor-mediated glutamate-induced toxicity (21.Tan S. Sagara Y. Liu Y. Maher P. Schubert D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). One model used to study oxidative stress-related neuronal death is to inhibit cystine uptake by exposing cells to high levels of glutamate (22.Murphy T.H. Schnaar R.L. Coyle J.T. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1624-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). High glutamate levels block cystine uptake via the amino acid transporter Xc− and impairs reduced glutathione (GSH) cell homeostasis. The induction of oxidative stress by glutamate in this model has been demonstrated to be a primary cytotoxic mechanism in C6 glial cells (23.Kato S. Negishi K. Mawatari K. Kuo C.H. Neuroscience. 1992; 48: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 24.Han D. Sen C.K. Roy S. Kobayashi M.S. Tritschler H.J. Packer L. Am. J.

Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1441-1453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the mitochondrial electron transport chain has been shown to be a source of ROS production during glutamate-induced apoptosis in HT22 neuronal cells, a sub-clone of HT4 cells used in the current study (21.Tan S. Sagara Y. Liu Y. Maher P. Schubert D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). At micromolar concentrations, antioxidants such as α-tocopherol, probucol, and α-lipoic acid have been shown to protect these cells against glutamate-induced cytotoxicity (22.Murphy T.H. Schnaar R.L. Coyle J.T. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1624-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 23.Kato S. Negishi K. Mawatari K. Kuo C.H.

Sastre A. Schnaar R.L. Coyle J.T. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1547-1558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). In the current study, rat hippocampal neuronal HT4 cells (30.Morimoto B.H. Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3518-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) were exposed to elevated levels of extracellular glutamate, and the ability of tocotrienols and tocopherol to protect the neuronal cells was examined. This study presents first evidence showing that at amounts 4–10-fold lower than levels of tocotrienol detected in plasma of human supplemented with the vitamin E molecule (7.O'Byrne D. Traber M.G. Packer L. Grundy S. Jialal I. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 536Google Scholar), α-tocotrienol has potent signal transduction regulatory properties that account for its neuroprotective function. The following materials were obtained from the sources indicated: l-glutamic acid monosodium salt (Sigma); DCFH-DA (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR); 2,2′-azobis[2-amidinopropane]hydrochloride (AAPH; Polysciences Inc., PA); racemic (d, l) mixture of tocopherol, tocotrienols, and related esters (BASF Bioresearch, Germany). For cell culture, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), fetal calf serum, and penicillin and streptomycin (University of California, San Francisco) were used, and culture dishes 100 × 15 mm (Becton Dickinson) were used. Mouse hippocampal HT4 cells, kindly provided by D. E. Koshland, Jr., University of California, Berkeley, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. Confluent cells were trypsinized and subcultivated in culture dishes at a concentration of 3 × 104cells/ml. The cells were cultured at standard conditions described above. Following 24 h of seeding, the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with serum and antibiotic. The cells were then exposed to 10 mm l-glutamate as described previously (24.Han D. Sen C.K. Roy S. Kobayashi M.S. Tritschler H.J. Packer L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: R1771-R1778PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Tirosh O. Sen C.K. Roy S. Kobayashi M.S. Packer L. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1999; 26: 1418-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). No change in medium pH was observed in response to addition of glutamate. Vitamin E molecules are lipid-soluble antioxidants. The lipid peroxidation initiating peroxyl radical generator AAPH (10 mm, 24 h under standard cell culture conditions) was therefore used to expose the cells to authentic oxidative stress (32.Burcham P.C. Harkin L.A. Mutagenesis. 1999; 14: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Stock solutions (103 × working concentration) of tocopherols and tocotrienols were prepared in ethanol. Respective controls were treated with an equal volume (0.1%, v/v) of ethanol. The antioxidants were added to the culture dishes either 5 min before glutamate challenge or after the glutamate treatment as indicated in the respective figure legends Cell membrane integrity was detected by flow cytometry (EPICS Elite or XL, Coulter, Miami, FL) as a measure of cell viabity. For this assay the nonpermeant DNA intercalating dye propidium iodide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) that is generally excluded by viable cells (33.Beletsky S.R. Umansky J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 134: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was used. A 15-milliwatt-powered argon ion laser was used for excitation at 488 nm, and emission signal was collected at 575 nm as described earlier (34.Sen C.K. Roy S. Han D. Packer L. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1997; 22: 1241-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Propidium iodide negative cells were interpreted as viable cells. Intracellular peroxides were detected using DCFH-DA as described previously (35.Roy S. Sen C.K. Kobuchi H. Packer L. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1998; 25: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Following treatment with or without antioxidants and glutamate, cells were washed three times with PBS. Cells were detached from monolayer using trypsin and centrifuged (600 × g, 5 min). The cells were again washed with PBS and centrifuged, following that they were resuspended in PBS and incubated with DCFH-DA (25 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then excited with a 488 nm UV line argon ion laser in a flow cytometer (XL, Coulter, FL), and the DCF emission was recorded at 530 nm. Data were collected from at least 10,000 cells. Intracellular free Ca2+ levels were measured using cell-permeant calcium Green-1, acetomethoxyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells were loaded with calcium Green-1 and then were excited at 488 nm using a argon ion laser, and emission was recorded at 530 nm using a flow cytometer. For phospho-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1 and -2) immunoblots, cytosolic extract of cells treated or not treated (control) with 10 mm l-glutamate in the presence of 0.2 mmNa3VO4 was separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with phospho-p44/42 (Thr-202/Tyr-204) E10 monoclonal antibody (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). This was followed by probing with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies. Bound antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Following 18 h of seeding, HT4 cells were transfected with eukaryotic expression vector containing mouse Src (activated or kinase-dead) cDNA under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). The kinase activating mutation (srcY529F) is a substitution of phenylalanine for tyrosine at position 529. The kinase-inactivating mutation (srcK297R) is a substitution of arginine for lysine at position 297 (36.Zang Q. Lu Z. Curto M. Barile N. Shalloway D. Foster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13275-13280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 37.Bjorge J.D. O'Connor T.J. Fujita D.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used to carry out the transfection process that lasted for 3 h. After 3 h, the transfection reagent was removed, and regular cell culture medium was added to the cells. The cells were maintained in regular culture condition for 24 h to allow for protein expression. At this point, the cells were harvested and seeded for treatment with tocotrienol and/or glutamate. After 5 h of seeding, culture medium was changed, and cells were treated as described in the legend to Fig. 4. By using standard Western blot techniques we were not able to get a high quality resolution of bands. Instead, we labeled cellular proteins with35S, then tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated, and autoradiography was performed as described below. Following 6 h of seeding, cells were labeled withl-[35S]methionine (60 μCi/ml; NEN Life Science Products) for 12 h under standard culture conditions. To inhibit protein tyrosine phosphatase activity, cells were treated with 0.25 mm sodium orthovanadate (Sigma) for 15 min. After this, cells were either treated or not with 250 nmα-tocotrienol followed by glutamate for 1 h under standard culture conditions (as indicated in figure legends). Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Cells were lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline 1% v/v Nonidet P-40, 0.5% w/v sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% v/v sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.25 mm sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin). Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated (4 °C, overnight) from the lysate using monoclonal protein phosphotyrosine antibody (PY99; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and protein A-agarose. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the protein tyrosine phosphorylation profile was detected by autoradiography. Cells were harvested and lysed in 1 ml of a lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of the supernatants containing 750 μg of protein were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with 2 μg of protein A-agarose-conjugated anti-Src family kinase antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with the lysis buffer and twice with reaction buffer (40 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmNaF and 2 mm β-glycerophosphate). Kinase reactions were carried out in 30 μl of the reaction buffer containing 4 μg of acid-denatured enolase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 10 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) at 22 °C for 10 min. The reactions were stopped by adding 10 μl of 4× Laemmli sample buffer. The boiled samples were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the radioactivity incorporated into enolase was determined using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The effect of tocotrienols on purified Src kinase activity was performed essentially as described above, except that in the kinase reaction buffer the immunoprecipitate was replaced by 500 ng (106 units/mg) of purified recombinant-active Src kinase (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY). To determine the amounts and uptake of tocopherols and tocotrienols in cells, HT4 cells were treated with tocopherol or tocotrienol for the duration indicated in respective figure legends. After the appropriate treatment time, cells were washed twice with ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. Washed cells were trypsinized and collected in microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min. To the pellet 0.925 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmNa2EDTA, 0.025 ml of butylated hydroxytoluene (10 mg/ml), and 0.5 ml of 0.1 m SDS was added. The mixture was vigorously vortexed for 15 min at 4 °C; 2 ml of ethanol was added, and the mixture was vortexed for another 2 min. Then, 2 ml of hexane was added to the mixture, and it was vortexed for another 3 min at 4 °C. The resulting mixture was extracted as described previously (38.Thiele J.J. Traber M.G. Podda M. Tsang K. Cross C.E. Packer L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). An appropriate aliquot of the hexane extract was used for HPLC analysis. The electrochemical detector was operated with a 0.5-V potential with full recorder scale at 50 nA for quantitation of α-tocopherol and α- and γ-tocotrienols (38.Thiele J.J. Traber M.G. Podda M. Tsang K. Cross C.E. Packer L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Authentic compounds were used to generate standard curves. Glutathione measurements were performed using an HPLC system coupled with a electrochemical coulometric detector (ESA, Chelmsford, MA). A C-18 column (150 × 4.6 mm, 5-μm pore size; Alltech, Deerfield, IL) was used for glutathione separation. Glutathione levels were expressed as nanomoles/mg protein. Protein was determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit. Data are reported as mean ± S.D. of at least three experiments. Comparison among multiple groups were made by analysis of variance. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Treatment of HT4 cells with elevated levels of extracellular glutamate resulted in >95% loss of cell viability within a duration of 12 h. On a concentration basis, α-tocotrienol was more effective than α-tocopherol in protecting HT4 cells against glutamate-induced cytotoxicity. A dose-dependent study of α-tocotrienol and α-tocopherol showed that at a concentration of 50 nm α-tocotrienol, but not α-tocopherol, partially protected the cells against glutamate-induced death. At 250 nm α-tocotrienol, but not α-tocopherol, provided complete protection against loss of cell viability (Fig. 1 A). In experiments where cells treated with these forms of vitamin E, washed, and then exposed to glutamate, it was observed that pretreatment with 1 μm tocotrienol, but not tocopherol, provided significant protection (Fig. 1 B). Comparison of the two analogues of tocotrienol, α- and γ-, showed that α-tocotrienol was more effective than γ-tocotrienol in protecting against glutamate-induced cell death (Fig. 1 C). To resolve temporally the site of tocotrienol action in the glutamate-induced death pathway, cells were treated with α-tocotrienol at various time points after glutamate treatment. Almost complete protection of cells was observed even when 100 nm α-tocotrienol was added at 60 min, but not 90 min, after glutamate treatment (Fig. 1 D). At higher concentrations, e.g. 250 nm, however, over 80% of cells maintained viability even when α-tocotrienol treatment was added 90 min after glutamate treatment. Complete protection against loss of viability was observed when cells were treated with an excess of 5 μm even after 6 h of glutamate treatment (not shown). Micromolar amounts of α-tocotrienol was necessary to protect cells against AAPH-generated peroxyl radical-induced loss of viability. Such an antioxidant property of α-tocotrienol was not evident when cells were pretreated with 100–250 nmol of α-tocotrienol (Fig.1 E). Comparison of the cytoprotective efficacy of the free form of α-tocotrienol with the corresponding ester (tocotrienol acetate) showed that the free form was marginally, but significantly, more potent (Fig. 1 F). Previously, it has been shown that vitamin E has potent iron chelation properties (39.Stoyanovsky D.A. Kagan V.E. Packer L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 160: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to examine whether the protective effect of α-tocotrienol against glutamate-induced loss of viability was mediated by the metal chelation property of vitamin E. Glutamate-induced death of HT4 cells was partially inhibited by the iron chelator deferoxamine mesylate. The iron chelator regulated a late event in the death pathway because significant protection was achieved even when cells were treated with deferoxamine mesylate 4 h after glutamate treatment (Fig.2). Glutamate-induced death of HT4 cells was preceded by depletion of intracellular GSH levels (Fig.3 A) and elevation of intracellular peroxide levels (Fig. 3 B). Studies on the kinetics of these responses showed that GSH depletion precedes elevation of DCF fluorescence. DCF fluorescence was slightly higher after 4 h of glutamate treatment and peaked at 6 h. Although α-tocotrienol treatment did not spare glutamate-induced depletion of intracellular GSH, it completely prevented the accumulation of intracellular peroxides as measured by DCF fluorescence (Fig. 3,A and B). The accumulation of intracellular peroxides was completely prevented even if tocotrienol was treated 5 h after glutamate treatment (Fig. 3 B). Following exposure to elevated levels of extracellular glutamate, intracellular levels of free calcium ([Ca2+]i) increased (Fig.3 C). Increases in [Ca2+]i peaked following 8 h of exposure to glutamate (not shown). Pretreatment of cells with 100 nm α-tocotrienol significantly diminished glutamate-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i. At this concentration, however, α-tocopherol did not show any effect (Fig. 3 C). At 250 nm, α-tocotrienol completely prevented glutamate-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i. At this concentration, the efficacy of α-tocotrienol to prevent glutamate-induced perturbation of [Ca2+]i homeostasis was better as compared with that of α-tocopherol (Fig. 3 D). The availability of exogenous α-tocotrienol and α-tocopherol in HT4 cells was compared. Treatment of cells with various concentrations (100–1000 nm) of α-tocotrienol resulted in time-dependent elevation of cellular α-tocotrienol content (Fig. 4,A–C). Treatment of cells with 1000 nmα-tocopherol, however, did not elevate α-tocopherol level in the cells (Fig. 4 D). Comparison of the uptake of the free and esterified forms of α-tocotrienol showed that cells more efficiently took up the free form (Fig. 4, E and F). This was clearly evident in cells treated with 250 nm of tocotrienol or tocotrienol acetate (Fig. 4 F). Detection of the protein tyrosine phosphorylation profile in cellular extracts provided direct evidence confirming that glutamate treatment induces protein tyrosine phosphorylation only of a few proteins and that this phosphorylation process is inhibited in α-tocotrienol-treated cells (Fig.5 A). Examination of specific tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins revealed that glutamate induced activation of ERK1 and ERK2. This response was rapid and was sustained for 2 h as shown in Fig. 5 B. Pretreatment of cells with 250 nm of α-tocotrienol completely abrogated glutamate-induced phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 (Fig.5 C). Inhibition of pp60c-Srcprotein-tyrosine kinase activity by herbimycin or geldanamycin completely protected the cells against glutamate-induced loss of viability (Fig. 6, A andB). Treatment of cells with another inhibitor of protein-tyrosine kinase activity, lavendustin A, that is not specific for pp60c-Src did not protect against glutamate-induced cell death (Fig. 6 C). To examine whether glutamate-induced activation of ERKs represents a key event in the execution of cell death, the effect of a specific inhibitor of the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (PD98059) was tested. Unlike the effects of herbimycin or geldanamycin, PD98059 did not protect against glutamate-induced cell death (Fig. 6 D). Although the pp60c-Src kinase inhibitor geldanamycin completely prevented glutamate-induced death of HT4 cells, this inhibitor did not influence glutamate-induced accumulation of intracellular oxidants (Fig. 6 E). These results further support the contention that in this experimental system oxidants are not solely responsible for the execution of death.Figure 6Effect of protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors on glutamate-induced cell death (A–D).

https://openalex.org/W2048680704,"We have discovered a correlation between the ability of Escherichia coli cells to survive damage to DNA and their ability to modulate RNA polymerase via the stringent response regulators, (p)ppGpp. Elevation of (p)ppGpp, or certain mutations in the beta subunit of RNA polymerase, dramatically improve survival of UV-irradiated strains lacking the RuvABC Holliday junction resolvase. Increased survival depends on excision and recombination proteins and relies on the ability of RecG helicase to form Holliday junctions from replication forks stalled at lesions in the DNA and of PriA to initiate replication restart. The role of RecG provides novel insights into the interplay between transcription, replication, and recombination, and suggests a general model in which recombination underpins genome duplication in the face of frequent obstacles to replication fork progression."

The mechanisms by which mammalian cells increase respiratory capacity and ATP production in preparation for cell division are largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that serum induction of cytochrome c mRNA and processed protein in quiescent BALB/3T3 fibroblasts is associated with a marked increase in mitochondrial respiration. Cytochrome c was induced in the absence of any increase in citrate synthase activity or in subunit IV of the cytochrome c oxidase complex mRNA or protein, indicating that the enhanced respiratory rate did not require a general increase in mitochondrial biogenesis or respiratory chain expression. Transfections with a series of cytochromec promoter mutants showed that both nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) binding sites contributed equally to induced expression by serum. Moreover, CREB and NRF-1 were phosphorylated sequentially in response to serum, and the NRF-1 phosphorylation was accompanied by an increase in its ability to trans-activate target gene expression. The results demonstrate that the differential transcriptional expression of cytochrome c, through sequential transcription factor phosphorylations, leads to enhanced mitochondrial respiratory capacity upon serum-induced entry to the cell cycle.

Transfections with a series of cytochromec promoter mutants showed that both nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) binding sites contributed equally to induced expression by serum. Moreover, CREB and NRF-1 were phosphorylated sequentially in response to serum, and the NRF-1 phosphorylation was accompanied by an increase in its ability to trans-activate target gene expression. The results demonstrate that the differential transcriptional expression of cytochrome c, through sequential transcription factor phosphorylations, leads to enhanced mitochondrial respiratory capacity upon serum-induced entry to the cell cycle. nuclear respiratory factor 1 cAMP-response element-binding protein cAMP-response element phosphate-buffered saline carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine di-HCl cytochromec oxidase subunit IV of the cytochrome coxidase complex 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid casein kinase II rat cytochrome oxidase subunit IV gene Entry into the cell cycle requires energy in the form of ATP for the execution of a number of regulatory and metabolic events. Protein synthesis consumes large amounts of cellular energy and is required for entry into S phase (1.Brooks R.F. Cell. 1977; 12: 311-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In quiescent 3T3 fibroblasts, cellular protein content increases within 4–5 h of serum stimulation and precedes DNA replication by several hours (2.Tiercy J.-M. Weil R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 131: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Nontoxic inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory function inhibits progression to G1 in parallel with a reduction in cellular ATP (3.Sweet S. Singh G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5164-5167PubMed Google Scholar). Protein synthesis (1.Brooks R.F. Cell. 1977; 12: 311-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and degradation (4.Varshavsky A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) as well as the depolymerization of the microtubular network during interphase (5.Marcussen M. Larson P.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 35: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) all depend upon the intracellular ATP concentration. ATP has also been implicated in the regulation of cyclin-dependent kinases, which in turn control cell proliferation (6.Sheaff R.J. Groudine M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1464-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). The bulk of cellular ATP comes from the mitochondrial electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation system (7.Hatefi Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This system comprises of five integral membrane complexes along with the dissociable electron carriers, ubiquinone and cytochrome c. An electrochemical gradient of protons is established across the mitochondrial inner membrane as a result of electron transfer. The dissipation of this proton gradient through the ATP synthase (complex V) is coupled to the synthesis of ATP (Fig. 1) (8.Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). The respiratory apparatus is the product of ∼90 different genes localized in both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes (9.Attardi G. Schatz G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 289-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar, 10.Wallace D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1175-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). Although the mitochondrial genes are essential, they encode only 13 respiratory polypeptides along with the tRNAs and rRNAs required for their translation in the mitochondrial matrix. Thus, nuclear genes specify the majority of respiratory subunits, and nuclear gene products govern mitochondrial gene expression in part by controlling the transcription and replication of mitochondrial DNA (11.Shadel G.S. Clayton D.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 12.Grossman L.I. Lomax M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Gene Struct.

Bioenergetics and Biomembranes. 1997; 29: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 14.Scarpulla R.C. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1996; 6: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, little is known of the signaling pathways that mediate changes in the expression and function of the respiratory apparatus in meeting cellular energy demands. One means for responding to changing requirements for ATP is to modulate the synthesis or activity of respiratory chain constituents in response to extracellular signals. For example, in yeast, metabolites in the environment regulate the expression of cytochrome c and other respiratory proteins through the action of specific transcriptional activators and repressors (15.Zitomer R.S. Lowry C.V. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochrome c participates in the reduction of oxygen by cytochrome oxidase, the terminal and putative rate-limiting step of electron transfer (16.Poyton R.O. Trueblood C.E. Wright R.M. Farrell L.E. Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 1988; 550: 289-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The induction of cytochrome c by oxygen and nonfermentable carbon sources is part of a shift to aerobic growth. It is conceivable that in mammalian cells, the rate of respiration under certain physiological conditions may also be governed by regulating levels of cytochrome c. Mechanisms governing cytochrome c expression in mammalian cells may also be important in controlling apoptosis and levels of reactive oxygen species (reviewed in Ref. 17.Skulachev V.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). We have previously isolated the human and rodent cytochromec genes and investigated the determinants of cytochromec transcription in mammalian cells (13.Scarpulla R.C. J. Bioenergetics and Biomembranes. 1997; 29: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The somatically expressed gene has a complex promoter comprised of recognition sites for NRF-1,1 Sp1, CAAT box factors, and CREB/activating transcription factor among others (18.Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14361-14368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tandem cAMP-response elements (CREs) were trans-activated by CREB in the presence of protein kinase A, and these CREs accounted for the cAMP induction of cytochrome c mRNA (19.Gopalakrishnan L. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings represent the only established link between a signaling molecule (cAMP) and a specific transcriptional activator (CREB) in the expression of a respiratory chain gene in vertebrate systems. NRF-1 was originally characterized as an activator of cytochromec expression and was subsequently found to act on many nuclear genes required for mitochondrial respiratory function (18.Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14361-14368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). These include genes encoding respiratory subunits (21.Virbasius C.A. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2431-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), the rate-limiting heme biosynthetic enzyme (22.Braidotti G. Borthwick I.A. May B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1109-1117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as mtDNA transcription and replication factors (20.Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 23.Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1309-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). NRF-1 is phosphorylated both in vivo and in vitro on serine residues within a concise amino-terminal domain (24.Gugneja S. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18732-18739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these sites in vitro enhances NRF-1 DNA binding activity, suggesting that these modifications may regulate NRF-1 function. Such a mechanism might allow the nuclear transcriptional machinery to respond both to extracellular signals and to intracellular ATP concentrations in controlling the expression of the respiratory chain. However, no in vivo regulatory function has yet been ascribed to NRF-1 phosphorylation. Here, we examine changes in respiratory activity and cytochromec gene expression associated with the serum-induced proliferation of quiescent 3T3 fibroblasts. We find that the transcriptional induction of cytochrome c is intimately associated with enhanced respiratory activity in preparation for entry to the cell cycle. The results demonstrate that a change in respiratory capacity can be implemented through the differential expression of a key respiratory protein rather than through coordinate synthesis of the entire chain. BALB/3T3 cells, clone A31, passage 64 from the American Type Culture Collection, were tested for contact inhibition and used between passages 67 and 69 because the respiratory response to serum was diminished or absent in transformed cells. Tissue culture reagents were from Sigma except for fetal bovine serum, which was from HyClone Laboratories, Inc. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and supplemented with 4 mm l-glutamine, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 4.5 g/liter glucose, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. For all experiments, cells were plated at a density of 5 × 103 cells/cm2 in growth medium and allowed to grow for two days until ∼40–50% confluent. The cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin for 60 h. Following starvation, the cells were stimulated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 20% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin for the indicated times. The viable cell number was found to be constant over 12 h of serum stimulation. Schneider's Drosophilaline-2 (SL2) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection at passage 519. All experiments were carried out between passages 521 and 541. Cells were cultured at 25 °C in Schneider's insect medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum as described (25.Cherbas L. Cherbas P. Roberts D.B. Drosophila: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1998Google Scholar). Cells assayed for oxygen utilization were harvested using a 1× trypsin/EDTA solution, collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g, and resuspended in PBS. Viable cells were counted as determined by dye exclusion using 1× trypan blue solution. The cell suspension was pelleted and resuspended to 5 × 104 cells/μl in respiration buffer containing 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 75 mmsucrose, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm potassium phosphate. Oxygen utilization by ∼1.5 × 106 cells was measured in 650 μl of air-saturated respiration buffer at 37 °C with constant mixing using an oxygen-sensitive electrode and dual oxygen electrode amplifier (INSTECH Model 203). After the rate of oxygen uptake driven by endogenous cellular substrates was recorded, rates of oxygen utilization were determined upon sequential addition of the following substrates and inhibitors to the indicated final concentrations: 10 mm each glutamate plus malate (pH 7.4), 0.5 μm CCCP, 0.02 μm rotenone, 0.02 μm antimycin A, 2 mm ascorbate plus 0.2 mm TMPD, pH 6.0, 0.3 mm KCN, pH 8.0 (26.Boffoli D. Scacco S. Vergari R. Solarino G. Santacroce G. Papa S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1226: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The ascorbate/TMPD respiration rate was measured as that which was KCN sensitive. No increase in oxygen uptake was observed in the presence of digitonin indicating that the substrates are permeable. Cells were lysed in 20 mmphosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1% laurylmaltoside at 5 × 103cells/μl and incubated for 15 min on ice. Citrate synthase activity was assayed using extract from 2.5 × 104 cells in a 300-μl reaction containing 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm acetyl-CoA, 0.5 mm5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). The reaction was started by the addition of oxaloacetate to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The change in absorbance at 419 nm was followed for 5 min (27.Srere P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 3-11Crossref Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). For the cytochrome oxidase (COX) assay, a 2-mmsolution of ferricytochrome c was reduced with several grains of sodium dithionite and chromatographed on a G50 Sephadex column (0.7 × 10 cm), and the ferricytochrome c eluate was assayed at 550 nm. COX activity using extract derived from 2 × 104 cells was assayed in 300 μl of 10 mmphosphate, pH 7.4, 10 μm ferricytochrome c by the change in absorbance at 550 nm (28.Cooperstein S.J. Lazarow A. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 189: 665-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For spectrophotometric determination of cellular cytochrome contents, ∼3 × 106 cells were suspended in 20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm ferricyanide and incubated on ice for 10 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g; the supernatant was divided between reference and sample cuvettes (80-μl quartz). A Cary 300 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer was zeroed across a spectral range of 420 to 640 nm with both cuvettes in place. Reduction of the sample with ascorbate plus TMPD was carried out in 0.4 mm KCN, 4 mm ascorbate, and 0.4 mm TMPD, and the absorbance spectra taken. The sample was subsequently reduced with 0.4 mm sodium dithionite, and a second absorbance spectra determined. Spectral data were expressed as reduced minus oxidized cytochrome spectral absorbance (29.Bookelman H. Trijbels J.M.F. Sengers R.C.A. Janssen A.J.M. Biochem. Med. 1978; 19: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared for immunoblotting as described (30.Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). For preparation of BALB/3T3 whole cell extracts, cells from a 150-mm plate at 60% confluence were lysed in 150 μl of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) containing 5 mm NaF, 500 nmokadaic acid, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate as phosphatase inhibitors, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin and allowed to incubate on ice for 30 min. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected. SL2 whole cell extracts were prepared from 10% of the transfected cells by lysis in 40 μl of RIPA. The remaining cells were used for reporter enzyme assays as described below. Extracts were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (36.5 acrylamide:1 bis-acrylamide) at 200 V for detection of cytochromec and COXIV (15% polyacrylamide) and CREB and phosphoCREB (10% polyacrylamide). The gels were transferred to either polyvinylidene difluoride (cytochrome c and COXIV) or to nitrocellulose (CREB and NRF-1). COXIV and cytochrome c were transferred in 10 mm caps, 10% methanol, pH 11. CREB was transferred in Towbin buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol, pH 8.3). Immunodetection was carried out with ECL reagents according to the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Plasmid p7ZfmCyt.c for the synthesis of a mouse cytochrome c riboprobe was made by cloning a 261-base pair HincII-BamHI fragment from the mouse gene (31.Limbach K.J. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 617-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) into SmaI-BamHI-digested pGEM7Zf. A plasmid for the production of a rat COXIV riboprobe was constructed by cloning the 281-base pairBglII-PvuII fragment containing exon 4 (32.Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6581-6586Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) into the BamHI and HincII sites of pGEM4Blue. The rat cytochrome c promoter luciferase plasmid, pGL3RC4/-326, was constructed by excising the promoter, 5′-untranslated region, and first intron fragment from pRC4CAT/-326 (33.Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) with BglII, blunting with Klenow DNA polymerase, and digesting with XhoI. The resultant fragment was cloned into pGL3 basic vector (Promega) that had been cut with HindIII, blunt-ended with Klenow, and digested with XhoI. pGL3RC4/-66, pGL3RC4/-326, and pGL3RC4/-326;CRE DM1, were all derived from their respective CAT plasmids (19.Gopalakrishnan L. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) by substituting a XhoI-HindIII fragment. pGL3RC4/-326 NRF-1Mut was constructed from the parent plasmid pGL3RC4/-326 using oligonucleotide RC4NRF-1MutF 5′-ACCATGCTAGCCCTCATTAGCGCGCACCTTGCT-3′ and the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Promega). Similarly, pGL3RC4/-326;CRE DM1/NRF-1Mut was constructed from pGL3RC4/-326;CRE DM1 using RC4NRF-1MutR 5′-AGCAAGGTGCGCGCTAATGAGGGCTAGCATGGT-3′. TheHindIII-XhoI fragments from the amplified reaction products were subcloned back into the parent pGL3RC4/-326 and sequenced. The construction of pSG5NRF-1/3xHA has been described (24.Gugneja S. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18732-18739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In pPac5c, the Drosophila actin 5c promoter drives expression of cloned coding regions (34.Urness L.D. Functional Studies of the E74A Protein during Drosophila Metamorphosis, Ph.D. thesis/dissertation. University of Utah, 1995Google Scholar). To make pPac5cNRF-1, pSG5NRF-1/119-1662 was digested with EcoRI andPstI, and the 230-base pair fragment was cloned into pBluescript. The resulting plasmid was digested with EcoRV and PstI to release the NRF-1 fragment. Next, pET3dNRF-1/6His was cut with PstI and Acc65I and, together with the EcoRV/PstI NRF-1 fragment, cloned into pPac5c linearized with EcoRV andAcc65I. pPac5cNRF-1Mut8xA was made from pSG5NRF-1Mut 8xA (24.Gugneja S. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18732-18739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) as described for pPac5cNRF-1. p4xNRF-1Luc has been described (35.Gugneja S. Virbasius C.A. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5708-5716Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). pSG5CREB was made by subcloning the EcoRI/BglII fragment from pRSVCREB into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pSG5. Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and RNase protections were performed as described (36.Gugneja S. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Reactions contained 5 μg of total RNA from BALB/3T3 cells and 15 μg of yeast tRNA. Antisense probes for hybridization were prepared by linearizing plasmids withMluI for mouse cytochrome c or EcoRI for RCO4 and transcribing with T7 polymerase. The 345-nucleotide cytochrome c probe gave a protected fragment of 175 nucleotides, whereas the 350-nucleotide RCO4 probe gave a protected fragment of 132 nucleotides. The protected products were run on a 6% acrylamide (29:1), 8 m urea gel and were visualized by autoradiography. BALB/3T3 cells were plated at 5 × 103 cells/cm2 in 6-well plates and incubated for 24–36 h. For transfections, 200 ng of pGL3RC4 reporter plasmid, 100 ng of pCMV β-gal (CLONTECH), and 3.7 μg of pGEM7Zf were added to 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. SuperFect (Qiagen)(5 μl) was added and vortexed for 10 s, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min. After the addition of 600 μl of growth medium, the suspension was added to a PBS-washed well and incubated for 6–8 h. The cells were washed three times with PBS and then starved with 2 ml of starvation medium for 48 h. The medium was changed to either stimulation or starvation medium, and the cells were incubated for an additional 13.5 h. COS cells were transfected with calcium/phosphate-precipitated DNA (33.Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). SL2 cells were plated at 106 cells/ml in 100-mm dishes and transfected with calcium/phosphate-precipitated DNA (25.Cherbas L. Cherbas P. Roberts D.B. Drosophila: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1998Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared, and luciferase assays were performed using reagents from Pharmingen. Spectrophotometric β-galactosidase assays were performed using the β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega). Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described (24.Gugneja S. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18732-18739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). BALB/3T3 cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate after 60 h in starvation medium. The medium was changed to phosphate-free stimulation media, and 200 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate was added. Cells were incubated for 12 h before harvesting with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). Transfected SL2 cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate 24 h after removal of the DNA precipitate. The cells were replated in 4 ml of medium containing 1.5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate. After 4 h they were washed with PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer. For in vivo 35S-labeling, cells were plated and after 16 h washed with PBS and labeled with 5 ml of methionine-free growth medium containing 250 μCi of [35S]methionine at 1000 Ci/mmol. After 16 h cells were washed with PBS, and 5 ml of methionine-free starvation medium containing 250 μCi of [35S]methionine was added. After 60 h the cells were again washed with PBS, and 5 ml of methionine-free stimulation medium containing 250 μCi of [35S]methionine was added. The cells were incubated for 12 h, washed with PBS, and lysed in RIPA buffer. In vivo labeled NRF-1 was immunoprecipitated from BALB/3T3 extracts as described (24.Gugneja S. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18732-18739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Extracts were precleared by incubation with normal rabbit IgG for 3 h followed by precipitation with protein A-agarose. We observed a marked increase in the endogenous rate of respiration in quiescent BALB/3T3 cells that were serum-stimulated (TableI). The increased respiration began within 3 h of stimulation and extended through at least 12 h. The elevated endogenous respiration rate, measured on a per cell basis, coincided with a similar increase in glutamate/malate-dependent respiration in the presence of an uncoupler. This is consistent with the enhancement of electron flow from NADH through the entire electron transport chain (Fig.1). An uncoupler (CCCP) was included to dissipate the proton gradient and thus alleviate respiratory control through complex V (Fig. 1). The increase in electron transport did not result from a general increase in respiratory chain synthesis or mitochondrial biogenesis. The activity of the mitochondrial matrix enzyme, citrate synthase, which is correlated with mitochondrial content (37.LaNoue K.F. Strzelecki T. Finch F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4116-4121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), remained unchanged in this time interval (Table I). In addition, there was no increase in cytochrome c oxidase activity as measured spectrophotometrically using reduced cytochromec as a substrate. Thus, the increased respiration did not coincide with a general increase in mitochondrial proliferation or respiratory chain expression.Table IEnzyme activities over a time course of serum stimulationSerum stimulation (h)Enzyme/substrate0312Activityfmol/min/cellEndogenousafmol of O2 consumed/min/cell using 1.5 × 106 intact cells in a 650-μl reaction volume.,bActivity values are the average of three independent experiments ± the standard error of the mean.0.88 ± 0.09 (1)cRelative activities normalized to citrate synthase.2.20 ± 0.28 (2.0)3.96 ± 0.12 (4.3)Glutamate + malateafmol of O2 consumed/min/cell using 1.5 × 106 intact cells in a 650-μl reaction volume.,bActivity values are the average of three independent experiments ± the standard error of the mean.1.65 ± 0.35 (1)3.75 ± 0.36 (1.8)5.13 ± 0.32 (2.9)Ascorbate + TMPD a,b,d,e3.49 ± 0.67 (1)4.86 ± 0.35 (1.1)8.02 ± 0.19 (2.2)Cytochrome oxidaseefmol of ferrocytochrome c oxidized/min/cell using a total cell extract from 2 × 104 cells in a 300-μl reaction volume.,ffmol of citric acid synthesized/min/cell using a total cell extract from 2 × 104 cells in a 300-μl reaction volume.18.33 ± 0.97 (1)18.01 ± 0.47 (0.8)10.64 ± 0.19 (0.6)Citrate synthasebActivity values are the average of three independent experiments ± the standard error of the mean.,ffmol of citric acid synthesized/min/cell using a total cell extract from 2 × 104 cells in a 300-μl reaction volume.3.16 ± 0.284.10 ± 0.263.38 ± 0.48d Assay performed in the presence of CCCP.a fmol of O2 consumed/min/cell using 1.5 × 106 intact cells in a 650-μl reaction volume.b Activity values are the average of three independent experiments ± the standard error of the mean.c Relative activities normalized to citrate synthase.e fmol of ferrocytochrome c oxidized/min/cell using a total cell extract from 2 × 104 cells in a 300-μl reaction volume.f fmol of citric acid synthesized/min/cell using a total cell extract from 2 × 104 cells in a 300-μl reaction volume. Open table in a new tab d Assay performed in the presence of CCCP. Although cytochrome oxidase activity was unchanged, increased respiration was observed using ascorbate plus TMPD (Table I), substrates that enhance respiration by reducing endogenous cytochromec (Fig. 1). This reaction was performed in the presence of antimycin A, which blocks the reduction of cytochrome c by NADH, and respiration was measured as the cyanide-sensitive component of the activity. In this manner, it was possible to dissect out the contribution of cytochrome c to the reduction of oxygen. The stimulation of oxygen consumption by ascorbate plus TMPD in response to serum stimulation demonstrated that cytochromec-dependent respiration contributed to the increased oxygen utilization. The observed increase in cytochromec-dependent respiration may be explained by the serum induction of cytochrome c relative to other respiratory components. Because cytochrome oxidase activity was not increased, the level of cytochrome c relative to cytochrome oxidase subunit IV (COXIV) was measured by immunoblotting. The results show a time-dependent elevation of cytochrome cprotein in total cell extracts, under conditions where COXIV protein levels remained unchanged (Fig. 2). When densitometric values were normalized to COXIV, cytochrome cincreased ∼1.5-fold after 3 h of serum stimulation and about 4-fold after 12 h. These values correlate well with the overall increase in respiration observed in these time intervals (TableI). To determine whether the induction of cytochrome c protein leads to higher levels of heme-containing holocytochrome, difference spectra obtained after 0 and 12 h of serum induction were compared.

A combination of Edman degradation and mass spectrometry of plasma revealed (i) a previously characterized molecule, mytilin B (Charlet, M., Chernysh, S., Philippe, H., Hetrut, C., Hoffmann, J., and Bulet, P. (1996)J. Biol. Chem. 271, 21808–21813) and (ii) three new isoforms, mytilin C, D, and G1. The four molecules exhibited complementary antimicrobial properties. The cDNA sequence coding for the mytilin B precursor was obtained from a hemocyte cDNA library. This precursor contains a putative signal peptide of 22 residues, a processing peptide sequence of 34 amino acids, and a C-terminal extension of 48 residues rich in acidic residues. Distribution of mytilin B mRNA and of the corresponding peptide in various mussel tissues revealed that mytilins are synthesized and stored in a specific hemocyte subtype. Furthermore, in an experimental model of infection, we showed (i) a recruitment of hemocytes containing mytilins toward the injection site within hours following bacterial challenge, (ii) that mytilins probably play a prominent role in killing intracellular bacteria after phagocytosis, and (ii) later an increase of mytilin-like material occurred in the plasma suggesting a secondary systemic role.

They float in the internal fluid or plasma in which organs are immersed. Consequently, hemocytes travel widely in the body cavity, providing ample opportunity to encounter foreign invaders. Hemocytes are capable of recognition through lectins (2.Renwrantz L. Daniels J. Hansen P, D. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1985; 9: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 3.Pipe R.K. Cell Tissue Res. 1990; 261: 261-268Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and of chemotactic migration toward invading pathogens (4.Cheng T.C. Howland K.H. J. Invertebr. Pathol. 1979; 33: 204-210Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar), followed by attachment and finally endocytosis of the pathogen (see Ref. 5.Bayne C.J. BioScience. 1990; 40: 723-731Crossref Google Scholar for a review). Two basic mechanisms for cell killing have been described in bivalve hemocytes. The first comprises the respiratory burst with release of highly reactive oxygen metabolites (6.Bachère E. Hervio D. Mialhe E. Dis. Aquat. Org. 1991; 11: 173-180Crossref Google Scholar). The second involves the release of lysosome enzymes from hemocytes (7.Leippe M. Renwrantz L. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1988; 12: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mussel circulating hemocytes can be divided into basophilic and eosinophilic groups (8.Friebel B. Renwrantz L. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A. 1996; 112: 81-90Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the former including hyaline (agranular) and granular cells and the latter only granular cells. Mussel granular hemocytes contain two different types of granules, distinguishable by size, lectin staining characteristics, and enzyme content (3.Pipe R.K. Cell Tissue Res. 1990; 261: 261-268Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 9.Pipe R.K. Histochem. J. 1990; 22: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The presence of numerous hydrolytic enzymes including proteinases, glycosidases, and sulfatases housed in large granules suggests that they are related to lysosomes (9.Pipe R.K. Histochem. J. 1990; 22: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In addition, cell free hemolymph contains various biologically active substances, including high molecular mass cytotoxic proteins capable of lysing various vertebrate erythrocytes (10.Hubert F. Cooper E.L. Roch P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1361: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and recently discovered antimicrobial peptides. Three types of small sized, cationic, cysteine-rich peptides were characterized: mytilin (34 residues (1.Charlet M. Chernysh S. Philippe H. Hetrut C. Hoffmann J. Bulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21808-21813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar)), myticin (40 residues (11.Mitta G. Hubert F. Noël T. Roch P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar)), and peptides that are members of the large defensin family of insects (1.Charlet M. Chernysh S. Philippe H. Hetrut C. Hoffmann J. Bulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21808-21813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 12.Hubert F. Noel T. Roch P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). A novel cysteine-rich antifungal peptide (mytimycin) was also partially characterized (1.Charlet M. Chernysh S. Philippe H. Hetrut C. Hoffmann J. Bulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21808-21813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). No information is available on precursor structure, localization, and regulation of antimicrobial peptide expression in mussels. This is in contrast to Drosophila, which responds to septic injury by rapid neosynthesis of antimicrobial peptides. These peptides, predominantly synthesized in the fat body, are secreted into hemolymph and participate in a systemic response (for a review, see Ref. 13.Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Hetru C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In addition, epithelial tissues that are in direct contact with the external environment also express the antifungal Drosophilapeptide, drosomycin (14.Ferrandon D. Jung A.C. Criqui M. Lemaitre B. Uttenweiler-Joseph S. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1217-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), suggesting a local response to infections affecting these barriers. In vertebrates, some antimicrobial peptides are also produced by epithelial cells of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts. Others are found in glandular secretions that moisten and lubricate epithelia (see Ref. 15.Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholarfor a review). Antimicrobial peptides are especially abundant in certain phagocytes, migratory cells that can surround, ingest, and kill microbial invaders (see Ref. 16.Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1997; 4: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar for a review). Nevertheless, increased plasma levels of human α-defensins have also been observed in patients with septicemia or bacterial meningitis (17.Panyutich A.V. Panyutich E.A. Krapivin V.A. Baturevich E.A. Ganz T. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1993; 122: 202-207PubMed Google Scholar), which supports the argument for participation of these peptides in systemic immune defense processes. In the present report, we investigated the physiological roles of the mussel antimicrobial peptide mytilin. We report the purification of mytilin B and three isoforms from hemocytes, the activity spectrum, and bactericidal effect of the different isolated molecules. We examined precursor structure and distribution of mRNA and of the peptides in various mussel tissues. We analyzed subcellular localization of mytilins in hemocytes by electron microscopy. In an experimental model of infection, we obtained evidence for rapid migration of mytilin-containing cells toward injected bacteria. Furthermore, phagocytosis experiments and analysis at the ultrastructural level showed that ingested bacteria and mytilins are located in the same intracellular granules. Finally, we report increased plasma levels of mytilin B-like material in a later stage after bacterial challenge. Adult mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis, were collected from a marine farm (Palavas, France, Gulf of Lyon). After acclimatization in oxygenated sea water at 18–20 °C, hemolymph was collected approximately 0.5 ml/animal) with a syringe from the posterior adductor muscle, under 1 volume of anti-aggregant modified Alsever solution buffer (18.Bachère E. Chagot D. Grizel H. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1988; 12: 549-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and immediately centrifuged at 800 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. Plasmas (cell-free hemolymphs) were then supplemented with aprotinin (5 μg/ml) and frozen (−80 °C) until use, while cell pellets were dried and stored at −80 °C until required. Mussels were challenged as follows. The shell was filed, and 100 μl of heat-killed bacteria in sea water (108 Vibrio alginolyticus/ml) or 100 μl of sterile sea water were injected into the adductor muscle. After challenge, mussels were returned to sea water, and hemolymph was collected periodically. Control hemolymphs were collected from unchallenged mussels. For phagocytosis assays, hemolymph was harvested as above and kept in 14 ml of Falcon tubes. Heat-killed bacteria (V. alginolyticus) were immediately added, according to the ratio 50 bacteria:1 hemocyte, and incubation was performed during 20 min at room temperature. The cells were then centrifuged at 800 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the pellets were treated for immunocytochemistry (see below). Plasma was diluted (1:1, v/v) in ultrapure water (UPW)1 containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the pH was adjusted to 3.75 with 1m HCl in ice-cold water bath under gentle stirring for 30 min. The supernatant was clarified by 20 min centrifugation at 10,000 × g and then kept at 4 °C until use. When extracting peptides from hemocytes, cell pellets were thawed and dissolved (5:1, v/v) in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.7, containing 50 mm NaCl, and then homogenized (30 strokes) using a Dounce apparatus. After a 20-min centrifugation at 10,000 × g, 4 °C, the pellet containing cellular organelles was disrupted in 2 m acetic acid (3:1, v/v) by ultrasounds (3 × 30 s) in an ice-cold water bath. Debris were eliminated by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and the organelle acid extract was kept at 4 °C until use. Plasma or hemocyte organelle acid extracts were loaded onto Sep-Pak C18 Vac cartridges (Waters Associates) equilibrated with acidified water (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in UPW). After washing with acidified water, two successive elutions were performed with successively 5 and 40% acetonitrile in acidified water. The 5% fraction was discarded, and the 40% fraction was lyophilized and reconstituted with UPW. All HPLC purification steps were carried out on a Beckman Gold HPLC system equipped with a Beckman 168 photodiode array detector. Column effluent was monitored by UV absorption at 225 nm. Fractions were hand-collected and treated for antimicrobial activity. The organelle acid extracts 40% Sep-Pak fraction were subjected to reverse-phase HPLC on a Sephasil C18 (250 × 4.1-mm) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Elution was performed with a linear gradient of 5–55% acetonitrile in acidified water over 90 min at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min. Fractions corresponding to absorbance peaks were collected in polypropylene tubes, freeze-dried, and reconstituted in UPW. Active fractions of step 1 were loaded onto a Sephasil C8 (250 × 4.1-mm) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted by two successive acetonitrile gradients over 10 and 40 min at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min, according to the following peptide: mytilin B (5–20% and then 20–30%), mytilin C (5–25.5% and then 25.5–35.5%), mytilin D (5–18% and then 18–28%), mytilin G1 (5–23% and then 23–33%). Active fractions of step 2 were loaded onto a Sephasil C18 (250 × 4.1 mm) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with the step 2 gradients. To ascertain the purity of the peptides, one additional step was performed on a narrow bore Delta Pak HPI C18 (150 × 2-mm) reverse-phase column (Waters Associates) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min using the gradients of step 2. Ten μl of purified peptides, corresponding to 50 pmol, were dissolved in UPW and analyzed by electrospray ionization in a Fisons mass spectrometer equipped with a quadrupole mass analyzer (mass range of 1–5000 Da). Molecular mass was calculated from a series of multiply charged protonated molecular ions. Purified peptides (0.5–1.5 nmol) were submitted to reduction and alkylation as described previously (10.Hubert F. Cooper E.L. Roch P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1361: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Automated Edman degradation was performed on a pulse-liquid automatic peptide sequencer Applied Biosystem 494. Bacteria, Escherichia coli D31 (streptomycin-resistant) and Micrococcus luteus A 270, were a gift from Dr. Jules A. Hoffmann (CNRS, Strasbourg, France). The human pathogen bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, andEnterobacter aerogenes, were a gift from Dr. Hélène Darbas (Hôpital Arnaud De Villeneuve, Montpellier, France), and Salmonella typhimurium (SL 1344),Brucella suis S1 (1330 ATCC), Listeria monocytogenes (SV1/2a strain EGD) were a gift from Dr. Jean-Pierre Liautard (INSERM, Montpellier, France). The marine bacteriaVibrio alginolyticus (DSMZ 2171), Vibrio splendidus (ATCC 33125), and Vibrio vulnificus (DSMZ 10143), were a gift from Dr. Jean-Louis Nicolas (IFREMER, Plouzané, France), Salmonella newport was a gift from Dr. Patrick Monfort (CNRS, Montpellier, France), and Vibrio harvey was a gift from Dr. Jenny Rodriguez (Centro Nacional de Acuicultura & Investigaciones Marina's, Ecuador). The marine fungus,Fusarium oxysporum, pathogenic for penaeid shrimp, was a gift from Dr Alain Vey (Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, St. Christol-les-Alès, France). The protozoan, Perkinsus marinus, a parasite affecting the Eastern oyster,Crassostrea virginica, was obtained from Dr. Mohamed Faisal (Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences, Gloucester Point, VA). After each purification step, antibacterial activity was monitored by a liquid growth inhibition assay according to Buletet al. (19.Bulet P. Cociancich S. Dimarcq J.L. Lambert J. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann D. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24520-24525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10-μl aliquots from each test fraction were incubated in microtiter plates with 100 μl of a suspension of bacteria (M. luteus) at a starting optical density of A 600 = 0.001 in Poor Broth nutrient medium (1% bactotrypton, 0.5% NaCl, w/v). Bacterial growth was assayed by measurement of optical density atA 600 after a 24-h incubation at 30 °C. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was obtained by testing serial doubling dilutions of the peptides in the same conditions. The minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) was determined according to the method of Hancock (20.Hancock, B. (1997) http://www.interchg.ubc.ca/bobh/methods.htmGoogle Scholar). Peptides were dissolved in a solution containing 0.01% acetic acid and 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and then serial doubling dilutions of the stock solution were made in 0.01% acetic acid, 0.2% BSA. Ten-μl aliquots from each test dilution were incubated in sterile 96-well polypropylene microtiter plates with 100 μl of a suspension of bacteria at a starting optical density of A 600 = 0.001 in Mueller Hinton Broth medium (Difco). Bacterial growth was checked after 18-h incubation at 37 °C under agitation, except for the marine bacteria which were incubated at 25 °C in Mueller Hinton Broth medium supplemented with NaCl (15 g/liter). The MBC was determined by plating the contents of the first three wells with no visible growth of bacteria onto Mueller Hinton agar plates and incubating at 37 °C for 18 h. The lowest concentration of peptide that prevented any residual colony formation corresponded to the MBC. Antifungal activity was monitored against F. oxysporum as described by Fehlbaum et al. (21.Fehlbaum P. Bulet P. Michaut L. Lagueux M. Broekaert W.F. Hetru C. Hoffman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33159-33163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by a liquid growth inhibition assay. Briefly, 80 μl of fungal spores (final concentration, 104 spores/ml) suspended in potato dextrose broth (Difco) were added to 10 μl of peptide solution in microtiter plates. Growth inhibition was observed microscopically after a 24-h incubation at 30 °C and quantified by measurement of optical density at 600 nm after 48 h. The MIC values are expressed as an interval of concentration (a–b), where (a) represents the highest peptide concentration at which fungi are still growing and (b) the lowest concentration that causes 100% growth inhibition. To test anti-protozoan activity, P. marinus was cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the method of Gauthier and Vasta (22.Gauthier J.D. Vasta G.R. J. Invertebr. Pathol. 1995; 66: 156-168Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Pure peptide (10 μm) was added to 4 × 104 P. marinus in sea water (final volume 20 μl) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Parasite viability was then estimated using acridine orange and ethidium bromide (23.Morvan A. Iwanaga S. Comps M. Bachère E. J. Invertebr. Pathol. 1996; 69: 177-182Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Ten μl of purified peptide, at a concentration 10 times the MIC, was mixed with 90 μl of an exponential phase culture of M. luteus at a starting A 600 = 0.01 in Poor Broth nutrient medium and incubated at 30 °C. Aliquots of 10 μl were plated after 0-min, 3-min, 10-min, 30-min, 2-h, 6-h, and 24-h incubation times on nutrient agar plates, and the number of colony-forming units was established after overnight incubation at 37 °C. As a control, the bacterial culture was incubated with 10 μl of sterile water. A cDNA library was constructed in the ZAP Express vector (Stratagene) using Poly(A)+ RNA from unchallenged adult mussel hemocytes. Reverse transcription-PCR was used to prepare the DNA probe corresponding to mytilin B. From the mytilin B amino acid sequence obtained by Edman degradation, degenerate sense oligonucleotides corresponding to residues 4–10 (5′-TT(C/T)(A/C)GITG(C/T)AA(A/G)GGITA(C/T)TG-3′) and degenerate antisense oligonucleotide corresponding to the residues 26–32 (5′-A(A/G)(C/T)TT(C/T)TT(A/G)CA(A/G)TA(A/G)CAIC-3′) were designed by back translation. Three μg of total RNA were submitted to reverse transcription using the Ready-to-Go You-Prime First-Strand Beads kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). One-fifth of the reaction was directly used as a template for the PCR with the two degenerate pool primers. PCR was performed with 40 cycles consisting of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 48 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C in 1.5 mmMgCl2 and 1 μm primers. The resulting 83-base pair cDNA fragment corresponding to mytilin B was cloned using the PCR script Amp (SK+) cloning kit (Stratagene), and the plasmid was called pBSMyt.83. The insert was labeled by random priming using the Ready-to-Go DNA labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used to screen 400,000 plaques from the cDNA library transferred to Hybond-N filter membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). High stringency hybridizations were carried out overnight at 65 °C in 5× Denhardt's solution, 5× SSPE, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. The filters were washed in a solution of 0.5× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 65 °C, followed by autoradiography. A secondary screening was performed to purify the positive clones. Phagemids were obtained by in vivo excision according to the manufacturer's instructions and sequenced on both strands. 18 S ribosomal DNA probe sense oligonucleotide (5′-TGACCTCGCGGAAAGAGCGC-3′) and antisense oligonucleotide (5′-AGGGGACGTAATCAACGCGAGC-3′) were designed from the sequence of the ribosomal RNA small subunit (24.Kenchington E.L.R. Landry D. Bird C.J. Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 1995; 52: 2613-2620Crossref Google Scholar) and used in PCR experiments. Five hundred ng of mussel genome DNA were submitted to amplification using 35 cycles consisting of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C in 1.5 mm MgCl2 and 1 μm primers. The preparation of hemocyte actin cDNA was reported in another study. 2G. Mitta, P. Roch, and J.-P. Cadoret, manuscript in preparation. Hemocytes from four mussels (8 × 106cells/animal) were pooled, centrifuged, and suspended in 1 ml of Trizol (Life Technologies). Immediately after hemolymph collection, the mantle, foot, labial palps, gills, hepatopancreas, and adductor muscle were excised from the same mussels and washed extensively in sterile sea water. Tissues (100 mg of each) were homogenized in 1 ml of Trizol using 30 potter strokes, and total RNA was extracted using the manufacturer's protocol. Five μg of total RNA from each tissue and from each mussel were pooled (20 μg of total RNA/tissue) and subsequently analyzed. For kinetics analysis, hemocytes were collected from noninjected and from bacteria or saline-injected mussels from 0 to 48 h postinjection. Hemocytes from each set of 30 mussels were centrifuged and suspended in 1 ml of Trizol. Total RNA was obtained according to the manufacturer's instruction, and 20 μg of total RNA from each set were submitted to analysis. Total RNAs from tissues and hemocytes were separated on 1.2% agarose gel containing 17% formaldehyde and transferred to Hybond N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were hybridized with32P-labeled mytilin B cDNA fragment in a solution containing formamide (50%), 5× SSC, 8× Denhardt's solution, 0.05m sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm at 55 °C for 12 h. Membranes were washed in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C, and autoradiography was carried out. Size markers were simultaneously applied to the electrophoresis and stained with a methylene blue solution. After autoradiography the membranes were stripped (boiling solution of 0.1% SDS onto the blot) and submitted to the same protocol for the 32P-labeled ribosomal DNA probe or 32P-labeled actin cDNA probe. Pure mytilin B peptide (0.6 mg) was coupled to ovalbumin using glutaraldehyde. Briefly, an equal volume of 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS was added to a solution containing ovalbumin and mytilin B (3:1, w/w) in PBS. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature with constant agitation, glycine was added to a final concentration of 200 mm, and the reaction was incubated with stirring for another hour. Two rabbits (male, 2–3 kg) were immunized by intradermal injection of ¼ of the peptide mixture and Freund's complete adjuvant followed by three intradermal injections of ¼ of the peptide mixture each with Freund's incomplete adjuvant at 2- or 3-week intervals. The antiserum was collected 10 days after the last injection and IgG were purified on a Hitrap protein G Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For light microscopy, hemolymph was collected under 1 volume of anti-aggregating modified Alsever solution (18.Bachère E. Chagot D. Grizel H. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1988; 12: 549-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) containing 8% paraformaldehyde. After a 10-min fixation at room temperature, cells were centrifuged (5 min, 1000 rpm) on slides (Cyto-Tek centrifuge), immersed in a 25 mm Tris buffer containing 0.2% gelatin, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm ammonium chloride for 10 min and then in a pH 7.4 PBS buffer containing 5% gelatin hydrolysate (Bellon, France) and 1% normal goat serum (NGS; Sigma) for 1 h. Cells were then successively incubated with the anti-mytilin B antibody (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature and with a fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-rabbit IgG (BioSys) diluted 1:500 in the presence of Evans blue for 25 min at room temperature. Slides were mounted in glycerin buffer and observed by epifluorescence. To study the immune reactivity on mussels, tissues from adults were fixed in a solution containing 35% formalin, 39% ethanol, and 0.65% ammonium hydroxide, pH 6.4. After dehydration, tissues were embedded in Paraplast, and 4-μm sections were cut, mounted on poly-l-lysinated slides, and stored at 4 °C in a dry atmosphere. After hydration, the sections were treated at room temperature as follows: (i) 10 min in PBS; (ii) 1.5 h in PBS containing 5% gelatin hydrolysate and 1% NGS (PBS/gelatin hydrolysate/NGS); (iii) 1 h in anti-mytilin B IgG at 10 μg/ml in the preceding buffer; (iv) 1 h in alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (BioSys) diluted 1:300 in the preceding buffer; (v) 10 min in equilibration buffer III (100 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, and 50 mm MgCl2, pH 9.5); (vi) 20-min development in buffer III containing 0.19 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, 0.4 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium, and 0.24 mg/ml levamisole; (vii) the reaction was stopped by a 15-min incubation in buffer IV (1 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mmEDTA, pH 8). Sections were mounted in Eukitt and observed using a light microscope. For electron microscopy and light microscopy of semithin sections, cell pellet (107 cells) and dissected tissues were fixed for 2 h at 4 °C in a mixture of 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% picric acid, and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in PBS. Cells and tissues were postfixed in 1% OsO4 for 5 min and dehydrated before embedding in LR White (TAAB Laboratories). For light microscopy, immune staining was performed on 1-μm-thick sections of tissues, placed on glass slides in a small drop of distilled water, and dried on a heating plate (100 °C for 5 min). Slides were treated as follows: (i) 30-min preincubation in TBS (0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.9% NaCl) containing 1% NGS and 1% BSA; (ii) 14-h incubation at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml anti-mytilin B IgG in TBS containing 1% NGS and 1% BSA (TBS/NGS/BSA); (iii) three 5-min washes in TBS; (iv) 1.5 h in 1-nm colloidal gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:50 in the preceding buffer; (v) three 5-min washes in TBS; (vi) 5-min equilibration in citrate buffer, pH 7.4; (vii) silver amplification performed with the IntenSETM (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) kit according to the manufacturer's instructions; (viii) washing twice for 2 min each in distilled water. The sections were then stained with a toluidine blue solution (1%) and observed. For electron microscopy, immune staining was performed on 90-nm-thick ultrathin sections cut from the embedded pellet and collected on nickel grids. Sections were treated as follows: (i) 8 min in 10% H2O2; (ii) 10 min in distilled water; (iii) 10 min in TBS containing 1% NGS and 1% BSA (TBS/NGS/BSA); (iv) 48 h at 4 °C in 10 μg/ml of anti-mytilin IgG in TBS/NGS/BSA; (v) 3 × 10 min in TBS/NGS/BSA; (vi) 1.5 h in 10-nm colloidal gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jansen) diluted 1:50 in the preceding buffer; (vii) three 10-min washes in TBS; (viii) 3-min fixation in TBS containing 1% glutaraldehyde; (ix) two 5-min washes in distilled water. Sections were then stained for 15 min with uranyl acetate and examined with a Jeol JEM 100 CX or a Zeiss 902 electron microscope. Controls, which consisted of preabsorbing the antibody overnight at 4 °C with pure mytilin B (10 μg of mytilin B per μg of purified IgG), were performed on centrifuged hemocytes, paraffin, and semithin sections. Mytilin B-like substances present in 40% Sep-Pak fraction of plasmatic extracts were quantified by ELISA. All washing procedures were performed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Antibodies were diluted in PBS, 5% gelatin hydrolysate, 0.1% Tween 20, and all of the incubations were carried out in a volume of 100 μl/well. Two μg of the 40% Sep-Pak fractions or serial dilutions of native mytilin B peptide solution were diluted in 0.05 mNa2CO3, pH 9.6, and coated on flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plates (Falcon 3912) during one night at 4 °C. After washing, PBS with 20% gelatin hydrolysate was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and washed wells were then incubated with the anti-mytilin B antibody at a concentration of 10 μg/ml during 1.5 h at 37 °C. After washing, a new incubation was performed with an alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody (BioSys) diluted 1:4000 during 1 h at 37 °C. Finally, and after washing, 100 μl of 1 mg/mlp-nitrophenyl phosphate and 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.8, was added for 30 min at room temperature. The color density was measured at 405 nm using a Multiskan (Labsystem). Mytilins were purified from organelle acid extracts prepared from 2 × 109 hemocytes collected from 1,000 mussels. Elution from Sep-Pak C18 performed with 5% acetonitrile was discarded as containing no antimicrobial activity. The 40% eluate was applied to reverse-phase HPLC and fractionated using a linear gradient of 5–55% acetonitrile over 90 min (0.5"

PTEN is capable of dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate in vitro and down-regulating its levels in insulin-stimulated 293 cells. To study the role of PTEN in insulin signaling, we overexpressed PTEN in 3T3-L1 adipocytes ∼30-fold above uninfected or control virus (green fluorescent protein)-infected cells, using an adenovirus gene transfer system. PTEN overexpression inhibited insulin-induced 2-deoxy-glucose uptake by 36%, GLUT4 translocation by 35%, and membrane ruffling by 50%, all of which are phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent processes, compared with uninfected cells or cells infected with control virus. Microinjection of an anti-PTEN antibody increased basal and insulin stimulated GLUT4 translocation, suggesting that inhibition of endogenous PTEN function led to an increase in intracellular phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate levels, which stimulates GLUT4 translocation. Further, insulin-induced phosphorylation of downstream targets Akt and p70S6 kinase were also inhibited significantly by overexpression of PTEN, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and IRS-1 or the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase were not affected, suggesting that the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway remains fully functional. Thus, we conclude that PTEN may regulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent insulin signaling pathways in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of the IRS and Shc proteins allows them to serve as docking proteins that interact with signaling molecules containing Src homology 2 domains (6.White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including PI1 3-kinase. PI 3-kinase is a dual protein and lipid kinase composed of a heterodimer of a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110) and an 85-kDa regulatory subunit (p85) that contains two Src homology 2 domains (7.Dhand R.

These PtdIns can serve as lipid second messengers that play a crucial role in the biologic actions of growth factors (11.Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). However, the exact function of each of these PtdIns in hormone signaling is not fully defined. PI 3-kinase activation is necessary for a number of insulin-stimulated effects, ranging from stimulation of glucose transport, glycogen synthesis, and membrane ruffling to mitogenesis, although the precise function of PtdIns products in eliciting these responses is currently unknown (12.Kotani K. Carrozzi A.J. Sakaue H. Hara K. Robinson L.J. Clark S.F. Yonezawa K. James D.E. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 13.Jhun B.H.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5045-5054Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) for this effect. One target of PI 3-kinase is the serine/threonine protein kinase B, PKB (also called Akt), and overexpression of a constitutively active form of Akt leads to increased glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (17.Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Akt contains a pleckstrin homology domain at its NH2 terminus, which has been implicated in interactions with the products of PI 3-kinase, PtdIns 3,4-bisphosphate, and PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 in vitro (18.Klippel A.

Insulin, like other growth factors can also induce actin filament rearrangement in various cell lines leading to stress fiber breakdown and membrane ruffling (16.Martin S.S. Rose D.W. Saltiel A.R.

Stress fiber formation correlates with PtdIns 3,4-bisphosphate generation (31.Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that stress fiber breakdown is induced by 3′ phosphorylation of 4,5-PIP2 induced by PI 3-kinase. The pleotropic effects of PtdIns suggest that their synthesis must be tightly regulated. Many agonists and growth factors stimulate an increase in the level of PtdIns 3,4,5-P3, which is rapidly metabolized and inactivated by a family of 5′-phosphatases (32.Kavanaugh W.M. Pot D.A.

Although there are several phosphoinositide phosphatases, the mechanism of regulation and particularly the degradation pathway of PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 in vivo is still unclear (37.Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2614) Google Scholar, 38.Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Trends Biol. Sci. 1997; 22: 427-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The tumor suppressor-PTEN, is a 3′-phosphatase with sequence similarity to the cytoskeletal protein tensin. When overexpressed in 293 cells, it reduces insulin-induced PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 levels by dephosphorylation, specifically at position 3 on the inositol ring, without affecting insulin-induced PI 3-kinase activation (39.Guilherme A. Klarlund J.K. Krystal G. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29533-29536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The catalytically inactive mutant of PTEN causes PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 accumulation in the absence of insulin stimulation. PTEN may therefore act in vivo as a phosphoinositide 3-phosphatase by regulating PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 levels. The physiological substrates and functions of PTEN protein, however, remain to be elucidated. Overexpression of PTEN inhibits cell migration, whereas antisense PTEN enhances migration (40.Tamura M. Gu J. Matasumato K. Aota S.-I. Parsons R. Yamada K.M. Science. 1998; 289: 1614-1617Crossref Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Further, wild-type PTEN down-regulates integrin-mediated cell spreading and the formation of focal adhesions. Thus, the hydrolysis of PI 3-kinase products by PTEN may be a general mechanism for the regulation of PI 3-kinase effects (36.Myers M.P. Pass I. Batty I.H. Kaay J.V. Stolarov J.P.

In the present study, we examined the effects of PTEN on insulin signaling using an adenovirus (Ad-PTEN) engineered to express PTEN in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Porcine insulin was kindly provided by Lilly. Mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (PY-20), mouse monoclonal anti-ERK1, anti-PTEN and the anti-GFP antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-IRS-1 and anti-human S6 Kinase (p70S6K) were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Phospho-specific MAP kinase and p70S6K antibodies were from New England Biolabs, Inc. The goat polyclonal AKT (C-20) antibody of human origin and horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit, -mouse, and -goat antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All radioisotopes were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Hoechst dye 33342 was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). XAR-5 film was obtained from Eastman Kodak Co. All other reagents and chemicals were purchased from Sigma. 3T3-L1 cells were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose containing 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum in a 10% CO2 environment. The cells were allowed to grow 2 days postconfluency and then differentiated by addition of the same medium containing isobutylmethylxanthine (500 μm), dexamethasone (25 μm), and insulin (4 μg/ml) for 3 days and the medium containing insulin for 3 additional days. The medium was then changed every 3 days until the cells were fully differentiated, typically by 10 days. Prior to experimentation, the adipocytes were trypsinized and reseeded in the appropriate culture dishes. The Ad-E1A-transformed human embryonic kidney cell line 293 was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. A recombinant adenovirus containing the PTEN/MMAC1(MMCB) cDNA was constructed as described previously (43.Davies M.A. Lu Y. Sano T. Fang X. Tang P. LaPushin R. Koul D. Bookstein R. Stokoe D.

The genome of this vector has deletions of the E1 and E3 regions and protein IX gene and expresses its transgene under the control of the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter/enhancer. The control vector GFP (CLONTECH) was constructed to match MMCB except for its transgene. All of the viruses were grown in 293 cells and purified by DEAE column chromatography as described (44.Huyghe B.G. Liu X. Sutjipto S. Sugarman B.J. Horn M.T. Shepard H.M. Scandella C.J. Shabram P.

Transduced cells were incubated for 48–72 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% heat-inactivated serum to minimize cell division and to avoid a hormonal effect on gene expression and/or on the activities of overexpressed proteins, followed by incubation in the starvation medium required for the assay. The experiments were performed 60–96 h after the viral incubation. The survival of the differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes was unaffected by incubation of cells with the different adenovirus constructs because the total cell protein remained the same in infected or uninfected cells. In vitrophosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol was carried out in immune complexes as described previously (46.Ruderman N.B. Kapeller R. White M.F. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells were infected with Ad5-PTEN or Ad5-GFP(Ctrl) at the indicated m.o.i and time and grown in medium containing heat-inactivated serum (2%) for 48 h. Serum-starved (16 h) cells were incubated in the absence (basal) or presence of insulin (100 ng/ml) for 10 min, washed once with ice-cold PBS, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation (400 to 500 μg total protein) with antibodies to IRS-1 (2–4 μg), overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were precipitated from the supernatant with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) and washed as described (46.Ruderman N.B. Kapeller R. White M.F. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1411-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The washed immune complexes were incubated with phosphatidylinositol (Avanti) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) for 10 min at room temperature. Reactions were stopped with 20 μl of 8 n HCl and 160 μl of CHCl3:methanol (1:1) and centrifuged, and the lower organic phase was removed and applied to a silica gel TLC plate (Merck) which had been coated with 1% potassium oxalate. TLC plates were developed in CHCl3:CH3OH:H2O:NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2), dried, visualized, and quantitated on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes uninfected or infected with Ad5-PTEN or Ad5-GFP (negative control) were starved for 24 h in serum-free Cellgro medium. The cells were stimulated with insulin (100 ng/ml or as indicated in the figure legends) for 5–15 min at 37 °C and lysed in a solubilizing buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1.5 μm pepstatin, pH 7.4, for 20 min at 4 °C. The cell lysates were centrifuged to remove insoluble materials. For Western blot analysis, whole cell lysates (15–40 μg of protein/lane) from the indicated cells were denatured by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred to Immobilon-P by electroblotting in Towbin buffer containing 0.02% SDS and 20% methanol and immunoblotted with the indicated antibody. Blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked second antibody followed by chemiluminescence detection, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Cells were cultured in the same medium without serum for 2 h, and microinjection of various reagents was carried out using a semiautomated Eppendorf microinjection system. All reagents were dissolved in a buffer containing 5 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl. GlutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins were each coinjected with 5 mg/ml sheep IgG for detection purposes. Prior to staining the cells were allowed to recover for a period of 1 h. The cells were stimulated with insulin for 20 min and then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 5 min on ice and for 5 min at room temperature. Following washing, the cells were permeabilized and blocked with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2% fetal calf serum in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-GLUT4 antibody (F349) (1 μg/ml) that had been raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 16 residues of GLUT4 (47.Haney P.M. Slot J.W. Piper R.C. James D.E. Mueckler M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) in PBS with 2% fetal calf serum overnight at 4 °C. After washing and GLUT4 staining the identity of microinjected cells was determined by incubation with rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG. The results were then analyzed and photographed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Each fluorescein isothiocyanate-positive microinjected cell was evaluated for the presence of plasma membrane-associated GLUT4 staining. As in all microinjection studies, control cells were microinjected with preimmune sheep IgG and then processed in the same way as experimental injected cells. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were starved overnight before stimulation without insulin or with insulin (17 nm) for 15 min. Cells were washed and permeabilized as above and then incubated first with anti-GFP in PBS, as indicated, for 1 h at room temperature. After washing several times with PBS, they were then incubated with rhodamine-phalloidin (0.125 mg/ml) to visualize the location of polymerized actin at the cell membrane (membrane ruffles) or stress fibers and with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse to detect expressed protein in injected cells. The procedure for glucose transport was a modification of the methods described by Klip et al. (48.Klip A. Li G. Logan W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 247: E291-E296PubMed Google Scholar). Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected with Ad5-PTEN or Ad5-GFP(Ctrl) at the indicated m.o.i. for 24 h at 37 °C and grown in medium containing heat-inactivated serum (2%) for 48 h. Serum and glucose deprived cells (1 h at 37 °C) were incubated in α-minimum essential medium in the absence (basal) or presence of 0.5 and 17 nm insulin for 1 h at 37 °C. Glucose uptake was determined in duplicate at each point after the addition of 10 μl of substrate ([2-3H]deoxyglucose/l-[14C]glucose, 0.1 μCi; final concentration, 0.01 mmol/liter) to provide a concentration at which cell membrane transport is rate-limiting. The value for l-glucose was substracted to correct each sample for the contributions of diffusion and trapping. Data are representative of four different observations, and each value was corrected for protein content. Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing PTEN and GFP proteins at 5, 15, 30, and 60 (7.55 × 108 particles/ml) m.o.i. for 24 h, and protein expression was examined 72 h later by Western blotting. Specific bands appeared at ∼60 and ∼28 kDa corresponding to PTEN and GFP, respectively. The proteins were expressed in a viral dose-dependent manner (Fig.1, lanes 2–5), with ∼30-fold higher expression levels at 60 m.o.i. (lane 5), compared with uninfected control cells (lane 1). We evaluated adenovirally mediated expression of PTEN protein on insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IR and IRS-1. As shown in Fig. 2, no differences in the extent of insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor or IRS-1 were detected in cell lysates from uninfected 3T3-L1 adipocytes compared with those expressing PTEN. We further determined PI 3-kinase activity associated with IRS-1 in cells overexpressing PTEN (Fig. 3). In control cells, insulin led to a 15–20-fold increase in IRS-1 associated PI 3-kinase activity, which was unaltered by expression of either the PTEN or the GFP(Ctrl) proteins. These latter results confirm that PTEN functions downstream of PI 3-kinase.Figure 3Effects of PTEN overexpression on insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.Cells were infected with Ad-PTEN and Ad-GFP for 24 h at 37 °C and grown in medium containing heat-inactivated serum (2%) for 48 h. Serum-starved (16 h) cells were incubated in the absence (basal) or presence of insulin (17 nm) for 10 min, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to IRS-1. The washed immunoprecipitates were assayed for PI 3-kinase activity with phosphatidylinositol as substrate, and the labeled PI 3-phosphate product (PI-3P) was resolved by thin layer chromatography and visualized by autoradiography. This experiment was repeated two times with appropriate controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Akt, a serine/threonine protein kinase, is activated upon insulin stimulation in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. Akt phosphorylation on both Thr-308 and Ser-473 is directly dependent on the levels of intracellular PtdIns 3,4,5-P3, the key product of PI 3-kinase activity (49.Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M.

To investigate whether PI 3-kinase signaling is modulated by PTEN expression, we assessed Akt activation in whole cell lysates derived from uninfected and PTEN- or GFP-expressing insulin-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Insulin stimulation of control cells resulted in a marked activation of Akt, as determined by Western blot analyses, using a phospho-specific AKT antibody that detects pAKT only when phosphorylated at Thr-473 (Fig.4 A, upper panel,lane 2). Akt activation was also determined by retarded migration of the enzyme on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-Akt antibody (Fig. 4 A, lower panel,lane 2). PTEN expression resulted in a ∼50% inhibition of insulin-stimulated AKT activation (Fig. 4 A, lane 6), as assessed by both AKT phosphorylation and AKT gel shift. p70S6K is another protein kinase downstream of PI 3-kinase, and activation of this enzyme was determined by Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates with a phospho-specific p70S6K antibody. As shown in Fig. 4 B, stimulation with insulin resulted in activation of p70S6 kinase (Fig. 4 B, upper panel, lane 2), which was not affected by overexpression of GFP (lane 4). In PTEN-expressing cells an ∼50% inhibition of insulin-induced p70S6K activation (Fig. 4 B, upper panel, lane 6) was observed. Comparable results were obtained when p70S6K activation was assessed by retarded migration on SDS-PAGE using anti-p70S6K antibody. To examine the specificity of the effect of PTEN on PI 3-kinase-mediated insulin signaling, we also examined the status of MAP kinase (ERK 1/2) activation. This was accomplished in uninfected, Ad-GFP-infected, and Ad-PTEN-infected cells by assessing MAP kinase activation using a phospho-specific MAP kinase antibody (Fig. 5, upper panel). Insulin increased MAP kinase activation in uninfected and Ad-GFP-infected cells by ∼20–25-fold. PTEN expression did not inhibit insulin-induced phosphorylation of either p44 or p42 MAP kinase (Fig. 5, upper panel, sixth lane). Expression of MAP kinase, as assessed by Western blotting with a polyclonal anti-Erk-1 antibody that recognizes both nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms, demonstrated that protein levels were not altered in any of the cell groups (Fig. 5, lower panel). We analyzed GLUT4 localization by immunofluorescent staining of GLUT4 in adenovirally infected cells expressing the PTEN protein, as well as in cells microinjected with PTEN neutralizing antibodies. Cells infected with Ad-PTEN or Ad-GFP (Fig.6) were treated with or without insulin for 20 min. Cells expressing the protein of interest were fixed and stained for GLUT4 localization as previously reported (51.Haruta T. Morri"

We show that EcR/USP DNA binding activity requires activation by a chaperone heterocomplex like that required for activation of the vertebrate steroid receptors, but not previously shown to be required for activation of RXR heterodimers. Six proteins normally present in the chaperone complex were individually purified and shown to be sufficient for this activation. We also show that two of the six (Hsp90 and Hsc70) are required in vivo for ecdysone receptor activity, and that EcR is the primary target of the chaperone complex."
https://openalex.org/W2029160049,"We have used site-directed mutagenesis and a recombinant expression system for thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) in order to identify the thrombin cleavage site in activated TAFI (TAFIa) and to determine the relative contribution of proteolytic cleavage and thermal instability in regulation of TAFIa activity in clots. Arg-330 of TAFIa had been proposed to be the thrombin cleavage site based on studies with trypsin, but mutation of this residue to Gln did not prevent thrombin-mediated cleavage nor did mutation to Gln of the nearby Arg-320 residue. However, mutation of Arg-302 to Gln abolished thrombin-mediated cleavage of TAFIa. All TAFIa variants were susceptible to plasmin cleavage. Interestingly, all Arg to Gln substitutions decreased the thermal stability of TAFIa. The antifibrinolytic potential of the TAFI mutants <i>in vitro</i>correlates with the thermal stability of their respective TAFIa species, indicating that this property plays a key role in regulating the activity if TAFIa. Incubation of TAFIa under conditions that result in complete thermal inactivation of the enzyme accelerates subsequent thrombin- and plasmin-mediated cleavage of TAFIa. Moreover, the extent of cleavage of TAFIa by thrombin does not affect the rate of decay of TAFIa activity. Collectively, these studies point to a role for the thermal instability, but not for proteolytic cleavage, of TAFIa in regulation of its activity and, thus, of its antifibrinolytic potential. Finally, we propose a model for the thermal instability of TAFIa."

In this study, we demonstrated that cAMP as well as cGMP analogs suppressed tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) plus actinomycin D (ActD)-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in cultured primary hepatocytes. Furthermore, forskolin, which increases intracellular cAMP levels, also effectively suppressed TNFα+ActD-induced apoptosis. Activation of multiple caspases was suppressed in cells exposed to TNFα+ActD in the presence of cAMP or cGMP analogs. TNFα+ActD-induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria was also inhibited by cAMP or cGMP, reinforcing our conclusion that cyclic nucleotides interfere with the early signaling events of TNFα-mediated apoptosis. We evaluated the possibility that cAMP and cGMP inhibit apoptosis by activating the serine/threonine kinase Akt, which is known to promote cell survival. Both cAMP- and cGMP-elevating agents led to marked increases in Akt activation that was inhibited by the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin. However, complete inhibition of cyclic nucleotide-induced Akt activation had little effect on cyclic nucleotide-mediated cell survival, indicating the existence of other survival pathways.

It is now well accepted that activation of a unique family of cysteine proteases named caspases plays a central role in the signaling and execution phase of apoptosis induced by a number of stimuli, including Fas, TNFα,1 TRAIL, radiation, and chemotherapeutic drugs (reviewed in Refs. 3.Ashkenazi A.

In some cell systems, the anti-apoptotic function of NO is mediated, at least partially, by NO-dependent generation of intracellular cGMP.

Activation of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3′K) and its downstream effector Akt by growth factors, cytokines, and certain stress such as heat shock has been demonstrated to transduce signals regulating not only protein synthesis, proliferation, and glycogen metabolism but also cell survival (reviewed in Refs. 29.Hemmings B.A. Science. 1997; 275: 628-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 30.Alessi D.R.

Moreover, cAMP-elevating agents have recently been shown to activate Akt independently of PI3′K in transfected cells (40.Sable C.L. Filippa N. Hemmings B. Van Obberghen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar); however, the relationship between the anti-apoptotic action of cyclic nucleotides and the Akt pathway remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the anti-apoptotic mechanisms of cyclic nucleotides in preventing TNFα plus actinomycin D (TNFα+ActD)-induced apoptosis in cultured primary hepatocytes. Here we report that both cGMP- and cAMP-elevating agents suppressed TNFα+ActD-induced apoptosis via inhibiting activation and processing of caspases, including caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9. This is consistent with the finding that cytochrome c release and DNA fragmentation, events downstream of caspase-8 and caspase-3, respectively, during TNFα+ActD-mediated apoptosis, were significantly inhibited when cells were cotreated with cyclic nucleotide-elevating agents and TNFα+ActD. Interestingly, we also found that both cyclic nucleotides rapidly activate endogenous Akt in cultured hepatocytes in a PI3′K-dependent manner. Inhibition of this Akt activation did not block the protective effect of cAMP or cGMP; however, inhibition of protein kinase A did. Our results indicate the existence of multiple survival pathways in cells and suggest that protein kinase A is involved in modulating the apoptotic signaling cascade by cyclic nucleotides.

Apoptosis was induced by incubating the hepatocytes with the culture medium containing 2000 units/ml TNFα and 0.2 μg/ml actinomycin D for 6 h unless specified in the figure legends. Cells were then scraped off the plates and centrifuged, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in 5-fold volume of hypotonic buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mmKCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). After three cycles of freezing and thawing, cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was used as crude cytosol for caspase assays and Western blot for caspases, and the cell debris was used for Western blotting analysis of PARP. Protein concentration was determined with the BCA assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Cell viability was determined by the crystal violet method as described previously (8.Li J. Bombeck C.A. Yang S. Kim Y.M. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17325-17333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Activation of Akt was evaluated by stimulating cells with indicated reagents for various times. Cells were first rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, and 600 μl of whole cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm PMSF) was then added to each plate. After 5 min incubation on ice, cells were scraped off the plates and lysed at 4 °C for 30 min. The whole cell lysate was collected by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min to remove cell debris, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in aliquots at −80 °C until use. Akt enzymatic activity was assayed with 1 μg per assay of recombinant glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3) fusion protein as substrate in a reaction mixture containing 25 mmTris, pH 7.5, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm PMSF, 10 mmMgCl2, 50 μm ATP, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/per assay. The phosphorylation reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 °C and stopped by adding 3× sample buffer. After boiling at 95 °C for 5 min, phosphorylated GSK3 was resolved by SDS-PAGE and quantitated with a ImageQuaNT system (Storm 860, Molecular Dynamics Inc., Sunnydale, CA). Caspase activity was evaluated by measuring proteolytic cleavage of the chromogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-pNA (for caspase-3-like protease activity) or Ac-IETD-pNA (for caspase-8 activity) as described previously (8.Li J. Bombeck C.A. Yang S. Kim Y.M. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17325-17333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Thirty to forty μg of protein was separated on 14% (caspase-3), 10% (Akt), or 8% (PARP) SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Nonspecific binding was blocked with TBS-T (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature. Anti-caspase-3 polyclonal antibody H277 was diluted 1:500 in TBS-T containing 1% bovine serum albumin, anti-PARP antibody 1:500, anti-Akt, phospho (Ser473)-Akt antibody 1:1000, anti-caspases-9 antibody 1:500, anti-caspase-8 antibody 1:1000, and anti-actin antibody 1:30,000. After 1 h incubation at room temperature (caspase-3, caspase-8, PARP, Akt) or overnight at 4 °C (phospho-Akt together with actin, caspase-9) with agitation, membranes were washed three times with TBS-T. The secondary antibody was incubated at 1:5000 dilution for 1 h. Following 5 washes with TBS-T, the protein bands were visualized with SupersignalTM according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantitate changes in DNA fragmentation according to the manufacturer's instructions. cAMP levels were measured by using an iodinated assay system from NEN Life Science Products. Following exposure to indicated reagents for 30 min, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer supplemented with 1 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor) to inhibit phosphodiesterases as described above. Intracellular cAMP contents were then determined with the cell lysate (10 μg of proteins) by radioimmunoassay according to the manufacturer's protocol. cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity was determined by in vitro phosphorylation of Kemptide. Cells were lysed as above, and aliquots of 10 μg of proteins were mixed with or without 1 μm protein kinase A inhibitor (PKI, 6–22) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, in a volume of 30 μl. After incubation for 15 min at 25 °C to allow PKI to bind to PKA, 10 μl of 4× substrate solution containing 200 μm Kemptide, 40 mm MgCl2, 400 μm ATP and 1 μCi per assay of [γ-32P]ATP was added to each sample. Samples were incubated for 5 min at 30 °C, and the reactions were terminated by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mm. 20 μl of the reaction mix was spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose paper disc. The P81 paper sheets were immersed in 1% (v/v) orthophosphoric acid, washed 5–6 times with the acid solution, and then 2 times with distilled water. The incorporated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Background values obtained from a mixture lacking cell lysate were subtracted from all values. All measurements were performed in duplicate. TNFα rapidly triggers hepatocyte apoptotic cell death in the presence of the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D (8.Li J. Bombeck C.A. Yang S.

Immunol. 1994; 153: 1778-1788PubMed Google Scholar). Previously we have shown that the cell-permeable cGMP analog Br-cGMP partially suppresses TNFα+ActD-induced hepatocyte apoptosis (7.Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). To investigate the underlying mechanism of the cyclic nucleotide-dependent inhibition of apoptosis, we first established the optimal concentration for the inhibition of apoptosis by Br-cGMP. When incubated with cells in the presence of TNFα+ActD, Br-cGMP suppressed apoptotic cell death in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A andB). The maximal inhibition was observed at 800 μm. Interestingly, cAMP analogs such as Br-cAMP also dose-dependently inhibited TNFα+ActD-induced cell death but at a much lower concentration when compared with the corresponding cGMP analog (Fig. 1, A and B). At the highest concentration used, Br-cAMP or Br-cGMP alone had no significant effect on cell viability and morphology in the absence of TNFα+ActD. Other cell permeable analogs of cGMP and cAMP, such as 8-pCPT-cGMP, dibutyryl-cGMP (Bt2cGMP), and dibutyryl-cAMP (Bt2cAMP) showed similar results for suppression of TNFα+ActD-induced hepatocyte cell death (data not shown). Treatment of hepatocytes with 10 μm forskolin, a reagent that activates adenylyl cyclase and thus increases intracellular cAMP level, also effectively suppressed TNFα+ActD-mediated apoptosis (Fig.1 B). TNFα+ActD-induced cell death and DNA fragmentation were completely inhibited by the pan caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 1 and Ref. 8.Li J. Bombeck C.A. Yang S. Kim Y.M. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17325-17333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Addition of cell-permeable Bt2cAMP or Br-cGMP at the same time with TNFα+ActD delayed the onset of apoptosis but did not completely inhibit cell death (Fig. 1 C). Since cell death was completely inhibited at the 6-h time point by cyclic nucleotides, this time point was thus chosen for subsequent studies to elucidate the mechanism by which cyclic nucleotides regulate apoptotic signaling events. Previously we have demonstrated that multiple caspases are activated in hepatocytes challenged with TNFα+ActD and that caspase activation is required for hepatocyte apoptosis in response to this stimulus (8.Li J. Bombeck C.A. Yang S. Kim Y.M. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17325-17333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). To examine whether cGMP and cAMP analogs suppress cell death by inhibiting activation of caspases, we first evaluated caspase-3-like activity of cells exposed to TNFα+ActD in the presence and absence of cyclic nucleotides. As shown in Fig. 2 A, cyclic nucleotides alone did not have any effect on caspase activity. However, concomitant exposure of cells to cyclic nucleotides with TNFα+ActD resulted in significant inhibition of caspase-3-like activity. The effect of cAMP and cGMP analogs on caspase-3-like protease activity closely correlated with their effect on hepatocyte DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, these cyclic nucleotide analogs suppressed proteolytic activation of procaspase-3 as determined by immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 2 C). Consistent with the finding that the caspase-3 activation was inhibited by the cyclic nucleotide analogs, cleavage of PARP, a well established intracellular substrate of caspase-3-like proteases, was also blocked (Fig. 2 C). These results demonstrate that cyclic nucleotides suppress TNFα+ActD-induced apoptosis at a site upstream of caspase-3 activation. The most proximal caspase activated by TNFα is believed to be caspase-8 (3.Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5152) Google Scholar). Activation of caspase-8 can lead to direct activation of other caspases or the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. We next tested whether activation of procaspase-8 is suppressed by cyclic nucleotide-elevating agents. As shown in Fig. 3 A, caspase-8 activity in cytosolic extracts was markedly elevated in cells treated with TNFα+ActD. Addition of Br-cGMP or Bt2cAMP to cells significantly inhibited the caspase-8 activity. As expected, the pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk completely prevented caspase-8 activation. Furthermore, forskolin also suppressed TNFα+ActD-induced caspase-8 activity. Immunoblotting analysis of procaspase-8 revealed that processing of this caspase was inhibited by cAMP and cGMP analog treatment (Fig. 3 B). These results indicate that elevation of cellular cyclic nucleotides interferes with the death signal leading to caspase-8 activation or amplification. We previously reported that cytochrome c translocates from mitochondria to cytoplasm in TNFα+ActD-treated hepatocytes (8.Li J. Bombeck C.A. Yang S. Kim Y.M. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17325-17333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Release of cytochromec is known to signal activation of procaspase-9 through interaction with Apaf-1 (43.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6232) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 C, cytosol from untreated cells contained negligible cytochrome c. However, cytochrome c accumulated in cytosol of cells exposed to TNFα+ActD. This release of cytochrome c was significantly inhibited by cotreatment of cells with Bt2cAMP or Br-cGMP, demonstrating that cyclic nucleotides act at or above the level of cytochrome c release. Moreover, the activation of caspase-9 was suppressed by cyclic nucleotide-elevating agents (Fig. 3 C). These results are in agreement with our above findings that the cyclic nucleotide agents suppressed TNFα+ActD-induced caspase-8 activation. The PI3′K/Akt pathway plays an important role in inhibiting apoptosis. One mechanism by which Akt signaling suppresses apoptosis is by inhibiting cytochrome c release (44.Kennedy S.G. Kandel E.S. Cross T.K. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5800-5810Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). To explore whether cyclic nucleotide may suppress apoptosis and apoptotic signaling via activating the Akt survival pathway, we then examined the effects of cyclic nucleotides on endogenous Akt activation. Since phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 is required for its full activation (45.Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar, 46.Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), we first examined the phosphorylation status of endogenous Akt using an antibody that specifically recognizes Akt phosphorylated at Ser473. We found rapid activation of endogenous Akt when cells were treated with Br-cGMP, and this activation was time- and concentration-dependent (Fig.4 A). Other cGMP analogs such as Bt2cGMP and the PKG activator 8-pCPT-cGMP also activated Akt in a dose- and time-dependent manner, revealing a link between cGMP signaling and the Akt signaling pathway. Similar results were observed for cAMP analogs. Treatment of cells with B"

Both proteins contain a lectin site that directs their association with newly synthesized glycoproteins. Although many glycoproteins bind to both calnexin and calreticulin, there are differences in the spectrum of glycoproteins that each binds.

Indeed, the functions of calnexin and calreticulin were largely interchangeable. We also determined that a soluble form of calnexin (residues 1–387) can functionally replace its membrane-bound counterpart. However, when calnexin was expressed as a soluble protein in L cells, the pattern of associated glycoproteins changed to resemble that of calreticulin.

CRT and the luminal domain of CNX share extensive amino acid sequence similarity with the highest degree of identity located within a central segment consisting of two tandemly repeated sequence motifs (1.Williams D.B.

As a consequence of their lectin functions, both CNX and CRT exhibit a marked preference for binding to Asn-linked glycoproteins (7.Ou W.J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.

CNX is thought to function as a molecular chaperone, since its expression enhances the in vivo folding and assembly of class I histocompatibility molecules (12.Vassilakos A. Cohen-Doyle M.F.

Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In addition to its chaperone function, CNX participates in quality control, retarding the export of incompletely assembled protein subunits from the ER (15.Jackson M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Peterson P.A.

CRT is believed to possess similar chaperone and quality control functions, since the simultaneous inhibition of CNX and CRT binding by castanospermine treatment is accompanied by impaired folding and subunit assembly, more rapid degradation, and premature release of glycoproteins from the ER in a variety of model systems (12.Vassilakos A.

(Tokyo). 1999; 125: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, CRT's individual role in these processes has never been examined. A prevalent view of how CNX and CRT associate with folding glycoproteins is that the interaction is regulated by the availability of monoglucosylated oligosaccharides. Following the initial attachment of the Glc3Man9GlcNAc2oligosaccharide to a nascent polypeptide chain, ER glucosidases I and II remove the two outer glucose residues to create the Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 species that is recognized by the lectin site of CNX and CRT. Once formed, complexes of a glycoprotein with CNX or CRT are dissociated through the further action of glucosidase II, which removes the single remaining glucose residue (24.Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Another resident ER enzyme, UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, regulates the rebinding of the glycoprotein to CNX and CRT by adding back a single glucose residue to recreate the Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 structure (24.Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 25.van Leeuwen J.E. Kearse K.P. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5420-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The glucosyltransferase is selective in that it only reglucosylates incompletely folded glycoproteins (27.Sousa M. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Hence, cycles of glucose removal and readdition regulate CNX and CRT binding to nonnative glycoproteins with the glucosyltransferase acting as the folding sensor. In this model, CNX and CRT do not function as classical chaperones, but rather the lectin-oligosaccharide interaction itself is thought to enhance folding or subunit assembly, stabilize intermediates, and exert quality control (2.Helenius A. Trombetta E.S. Hebert D.N. Simons J.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 193-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 8.Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

CNX and CRT may also promote folding by recruiting folding catalysts such as the thiol oxidoreductase, ERp57, to the vicinity of the folding glycoprotein (28.Elliott J.G. Oliver J.D. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13849-13855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar,29.Zapun A. Darby N.J. Tessier D.C. Michalak M. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6009-6012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The question of whether CNX and CRT recognize the polypeptide portion of glycoproteins is controversial. On the one hand, in vitrostudies have shown that CNX and CRT do not discriminate in their binding between reduced and native forms of RNase B and that complexes with RNase B can be dissociated solely by oligosaccharide modification (30.Rodan A.R. Simons J.F. Trombetta E.S. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6921-6930Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 31.Zapun A. Petrescu S.M. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M.

Alternatively, there is abundant evidence indicating that CNX and CRT are capable of binding to the polypeptide portion of other glycoprotein substrates (4.Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A.

Scand. 1998; 52: 942-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that in conjunction with the regulated lectin binding and release cycle, CNX and CRT also bind to unfolded polypeptide segments and promote folding in a manner analogous to classical chaperones. Given the identical lectin specificities of CNX and CRT, it is not surprising that there is overlap in the glycoproteins that they bind and that they can, in some instances, associate simultaneously with the same glycoprotein (2.Helenius A. Trombetta E.S. Hebert D.N. Simons J.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 193-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). However, it is clear from an examination of the overall spectrum of glycoproteins co-isolated with CNX or CRT that there are distinct differences in binding specificity (11.Peterson J.R. Ora A. Van P.N. Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 38.Wada I. Imai S. Kai M. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25345-25349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein binds to CNX but not to CRT (11.Peterson J.R. Ora A. Van P.N. Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and that CRT dissociates more rapidly than CNX as the folding/assembly of the T cell receptor (39.Van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25345-25349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and the influenza virus hemagglutinin (40.Hebert D.N. Zhang J.X. Chen W. Foellmer B. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) proceeds. Also, during the assembly of class I histocompatibility molecules, only CNX binds to the newly synthesized heavy chain, but it is partially or completely replaced by CRT upon subsequent heavy chain assembly with β2-microglobulin (41.Nossner E. Parham P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 42.Sadasivan B. Lehner P.J. Ortmann B. Spies T. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the two proteins may collaborate during the biogenesis of various glycoproteins and raise the question of what the functional relationship is between CNX and CRT. Do they possess distinct functions that are utilized at different stages in glycoprotein biogenesis? Alternatively, are they functionally interchangeable but bind differentially to certain glycoproteins by virtue of their distinct membrane versus soluble dispositions or through differences in polypeptide binding specificity? To address these questions, we first asked whether CRT alone is capable of enhancing protein folding and participating in quality control processes in vivo using the well characterized mouse class I histocompatibility molecule as a model glycoprotein. We then compared the results with those previously obtained for CNX to determine the extent to which the functions of these two proteins are interchangeable. Furthermore, we examined the influence of the different topological environments of CNX and CRT by removing the cytoplasmic and transmembrane segments of CNX and assessing the impact on its chaperone/quality control functions and its substrate binding specificity. We found that CRT does indeed function as an apparent chaperone and component of the ER quality control machinery and that these functions are largely interchangeable with those of CNX. Furthermore, CNX retains its functions when expressed as a soluble molecule, but its substrate specificity is altered to resemble that of CRT. D. melanogasterSchneider cells were maintained in Schneider's insect medium (Sigma) with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Stably transfected derivatives were cultured in the same medium supplemented with 500 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Mouse L cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The following mAbs were used for the isolation of class I molecules: mAb 20-8-4S, which reacts with H-2Kb heavy (H) chains associated with β2-microglobulin (β2m) (43.Ozato K. Sachs D.H. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 317-321PubMed Google Scholar) and mAb 28-14-8S, which recognizes a conformational epitope in the α3 domain of free or β2m-associated Db H chains (44.Ozato K. Hansen T.H. Sachs D.H. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 2473-2477PubMed Google Scholar). A rabbit antiserum (anti-8) directed against the C terminus of the H-2Kb H chain, which reacts with all conformational states of Kb, was provided by Dr. Brian Barber (University of Toronto) (45.Smith M.H. Parker J.M.R. Hodges R.S. Barber B.H. Mol. Immunol. 1986; 23: 1077-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Unassembled mouse class I H chains were isolated using a rabbit antiserum (anti-HC) provided by Dr. Hidde Ploegh, Harvard University (46.Machold R.P. Andree S. Van Kaer L. Ljunggren H.G. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1111-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A rabbit antiserum raised against the C-terminal 14 amino acids of CNX was used to isolate full-length CNX (15.Jackson M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Peterson P.A. Williams D.B. Science. 1994; 263: 384-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), whereas CNX mutants lacking the C terminus were detected with a rabbit antiserum (αpp90) directed against the N-terminal 268 residues of CNX (provided by Dr. Ikuo Wada, Sapporo Medical University). mAb 12CA5 was used to detect influenza hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged CNX and CRT mutants and was provided by Dr. Paul Hamel, (University of Toronto). Fig.1 A depicts the full-length and soluble forms of canine CNX that were expressed in D. melanogaster cells. The insertion of full-length CNX cDNA into the Drosophila expression vector pRMHa3 (CNX-pRMHa3) has been described previously (15.Jackson M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Peterson P.A. Williams D.B. Science. 1994; 263: 384-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). A truncated form of the ER luminal domain corresponding to CNX residues 1–387 (designated CNX 1–387) was generated by inserting an oligocassette, 5′-CCGGATAAGGACGAGCTGTAAGGTACCG-3′/5′-GATCCGGTACCTTACAGCTCGTCCTTAT-3′, containing the KDEL ER localization signal and a stop codon flanked by BspMII and KpnI sites into CNX-pRMHa3 cleaved at the unique BspMII and KpnI sites (KpnI being at the 3′ end of the cDNA in the pRMHa3 multiple cloning site). Rabbit CRT cDNA in the pBluescript vector (pB-CR-2) was obtained from Dr. M. Michalak (University of Alberta). For expression in Drosophila cells, theKpnI/Ecl136II restriction fragment of pB-CR-2, containing full-length CRT cDNA, was subcloned into theKpnI and HincII sites of the pRMHa3 expression vector. In the pRMHa3 vector, cDNAs are under the control of the metallothionein promoter (47.Bunch T.A. Grinblat Y. Goldstein L.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1043-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Stably transfected D. melanogaster Schneider cell lines were established by co-transfecting a phshsneo plasmid containing the neomycin resistance gene plus multiple pRMHa3 plasmids encoding CRT, CNX, or CNX 1–387 along with H-2Kb or Db H chains in the presence or absence of mouse β2m (15.Jackson M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Peterson P.A. Williams D.B. Science. 1994; 263: 384-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). To ensure that all three proteins, H chain, β2m, and either CRT, CNX, or CNX 1–387, were expressed within one cell, the cells were cloned by the soft agar technique (48.Hapel A.J. Lee J.C. Farrar W.L. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1981; 25: 179-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and screened for expression by metabolic radiolabeling and immunoisolation. Six clones were selected for each transfected cell line, and only clones expressing comparable levels of these proteins were used in all subsequent experiments. For expression in mouse L cells, a variety of CNX C-terminal truncation mutants were generated that possessed a hemagglutinin (HA) tag adjacent to the ER localization signal as depicted in Fig. 1 B. Full-length CNX tagged with HA (pCN (HA)) and HA-tagged CRT (pCR (HA)) were generous gifts of Dr. Ikuo Wada (Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine (38.Wada I. Imai S. Kai M. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20298-20304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar)). The Δcyt mutant of CNX tagged with HA (CNX:Δcyt(HA)) was generated by subcloning dog CNX cDNA into theKpnI and XbaI sites of the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen; CNX-pcDNA3). Two polymerase chain reaction primers, one upstream from the unique BspMII restriction site, 5′-CCCGAAGATACCAAATCCGG-3′, and the other downstream from the Tm segment, 5′-CCGCGGATCCTTATTGCATCTTTTTCTCGTCAGCATAATCTGGAACATCATATGGATATCCAGAGCAGCAGAAGAGG-3′, were used to generate a polymerase chain reaction fragment that encodes the HA tag inserted adjacent to the adenovirus E3/19K ER localization sequence (Fig. 1 B). The polymerase chain reaction product digested with BspMII and BamHI was subcloned into the compatible sites of CNX-pcDNA3. The ER luminal domain of CNX tagged with HA (CNX:Δcyt,Tm(HA)) was obtained by inserting a double-stranded oligonucleotide cassette, 5′-CGTGGTATCCATATGATGTTCCAGATTATGCTAAGGACGAGCTGTAAG-3′/5′-GATCCTTACAGCTCGTCCTTAGCATAATCTGGAACATCATATGGATAC-3′, encoding the HA tag, followed by the KDEL localization signal into DsaI/Bam-HI-digested CNX-pRMHa3. The mutated CNX insert was isolated by digestion with BspMII andBamHI and subcloned into compatible sites of CNX-pcDNA3. The truncated ER luminal domain of CNX tagged with HA (CNX:Δcyt,Tm,388–462(HA)) was obtained by inserting a double-stranded oligonucleotide cassette, 5′-CCGGATTATCCATATGATGTTCCAGATTATGCTAAGGACGAGCTGTAAG-3′/5′- GATCCTTACAGCTCGTCCTTAGCATAATCTGGAACATCATATGGATAAT-3′, encoding the HA tag, followed by the KDEL localization signal intoBspMII/BamHI-digested CNX-pcDNA3. To replace CNX's transmembrane domain with that of the adenovirus E3/19K glycoprotein, the CNX:Δcyt(HA) construct was digested withKpnI and BamHI and subcloned into theKpnI and BamHI sites of the pRMHa3 vector. The vector was then digested with DsaI and EcoRV, and a double-stranded oligonucleotide cassette, 5′-CGTGGCTCTTTTGTTCCACCGCTCTGCTTATTACAGCGCTTGCTTTGGTATGTACCTTACTTTATCTCAAATACAAAT-3′/5′-ATTTGTATTTGAGATAAAGTAAGGTACATACCAAAGCAAGCGCTGTAATAAGCAGAGCGGTGGAACAAAAGAGC-3′, encod- ing the E3/19 transmembrane domain, was inserted. The 1588-base pair KpnI/BamHI fragment was then subcloned into KpnI/BamHI-digested pcDNA3 and termed CNX:19KTm,Δcyt(HA). cDNA encoding CRT residues −17 to 340 fused to CNX's transmembrane and cytoplasmic segments (residues 459–573) was obtained from Dr. Ikuo Wada (Sapporo Medical University) and designated CRT:CNXTm/cyt(HA) (38.Wada I. Imai S. Kai M. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20298-20304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In all cases, the recombinant plasmids were introduced into L cells using Superfect (Qiagen). The cells were analyzed 2 days after transfection. Radiolabeling of Drosophila cells with [35S]Met, lysis, and immunoisolation were carried out as described previously (12.Vassilakos A. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Williams D.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Briefly, following induction with 1 mm CuSO4 for 16 h, transfectedDrosophila cells were incubated for 30 min in Met-free Schneider's medium. Cells were then radiolabeled with [35S]Met for 5 min, chased for various times, and lysed in a buffer containing 1% digitonin, phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 1% aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin. Lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with amounts of anti-class I or anti-CNX antibodies previously determined to recover in excess of 97% of their respective antigens in a single round of immunoisolation. Immune complexes were recovered by incubation for 1 h with protein A-agarose beads and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 10% gels (49.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). Radioactive proteins were visualized by fluorography. For quantitation of bands, fluorograms were scanned using an EPSON 1000C scanner and analyzed using NIH Image software. L cells at a density of 5 × 105 cells/60-mm dish were radiolabeled for 30 min with 200 μCi/ml [35S]Met, lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in 1 ml of lysis buffer, and incubated with anti-HA antibodies for 2 h. Immune complexes were collected on protein A-agarose and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Class I histocompatibility molecules are cell surface glycoproteins that function to present peptide fragments of viral or tumor antigens to cytotoxic T cells. They are composed of three subunits: a glycosylated type I transmembrane H chain, a soluble unglycosylated subunit termed β2-microglobulin (β2m), and a peptide ligand of 8–10 amino acids. The interactions of both mouse and human class I molecules with CNX and CRT have been extensively documented (34.Harris M.R., Yu, Y.Y. Kindle C.S. Hansen T.H. Solheim J.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5404-5409PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Sadasivan B. Lehner P.J. Ortmann B. Spies T. Cresswell P.

We previously expressed mouse class I H chains and β2m in D. melanogaster Schneider cells and found that Drosophilahomologs of CNX and CRT could not be detected in association with murine class I molecules as assessed either by chemical cross-linking (15.Jackson M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Peterson P.A. Williams D.B. Science. 1994; 263: 384-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) or by co-immunoprecipitation with anti-H chain mAbs (12.Vassilakos A. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Williams D.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, these cells were unable to support the efficient folding or assembly of class I molecules, and they lacked the quality control capacity to retard the export of incompletely assembled class I molecules from the ER. Since Drosophilacells possess genes encoding CNX and CRT and also a deglucosylation-reglucosylation system (53.Smith M.J. DNA Seq. 1992; 3: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 54.Parker C.G. Fessler L.I. Nelson R.E. Fessler J.H.

Gene (Amst.). 1997; 191: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), it is unclear whyDrosophila CNX and CRT do not bind detectably to mouse class I H chains. Nevertheless, these cells provide a useful system to assess the functions of mammalian CNX and CRT in class I biogenesis. Indeed, co-expression of mammalian CNX along with class I H chain and β2m in Drosophila cells revealed that CNX promotes efficient H chain folding and assembly with β2m, stabilizes H chain conformation, and functions as a component of the quality control machinery to retain assembly intermediates within the ER (12.Vassilakos A.

Science. 1994; 263: 384-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). It is important to note, however, that class I molecules do not acquire peptides in Drosophila cells and hence their assembly cannot be studied beyond the formation of H chain-β2m heterodimers (56.Jackson M.R. Song E.S. Yang Y. Peterson P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12117-12121Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).

Numerous observations have demonstrated that integrin-mediated cell anchorage can regulate the efficiency of signaling from RTKs to MAPK. Recently, a relationship between integrins and GPCR signaling has also emerged; however, little is understood concerning the mechanisms involved. Here, we investigate integrin regulation of GPCR signaling to MAPK, focusing on the P2Y class of GPCRs that function through activation of phospholipase Cβ. P2Y receptor signaling to the downstream components mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase and MAPK is highly dependent on integrin-mediated cell anchorage. However, activation of upstream events, including inositol phosphate production and generation of calcium transients, is completely independent of cell anchorage. This indicates that integrins regulate the linkage between upstream and downstream events in this GPCR pathway, just as they do in some aspects of RTK signaling. However, the P2Y pathway does not involve cross-activation of a RTK, nor a role for Shc or c-Raf; thus, it is quite distinct from the classical RTK-Ras-Raf-MAPK cascade. Rather, integrin-modulated P2Y receptor stimulation of MAPK depends on calcium and on the activation of protein kinase C.

Thus, in some systems, integrin-mediated cell adhesion has been reported to increase the efficiency of RTK activation and autophosphorylation (7.Miyamoto S. Katz B.Z. Lafrenie R.M. Yamada K.M. Ann.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5592-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). As with RTKs, certain GPCRs can also engage in mitogenic signal transduction. A number of GPCRs, operating through several subfamilies of heterotrimeric G proteins have been shown to activate the MAP kinase cascade; this includes receptors for thrombin, bombesin, bradykinin, eicosanoids, lysophosphatidic acid, and various muscarinic, α-adrenergic, and nucleotide (P2Y) agonists (14.Gutkind J.S.

Thus, signals from numerous GPCRs ultimately converge on the same downstream MAPK module as signals derived from RTKs.The underlying mechanisms linking GPCRs to mitogenic signaling are only partially understood, and effectors linked to G proteins can influence the pathway leading to MAPK activation in multiple ways (14.Gutkind J.S.

Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). A variety of co-actors have been implicated in GPCR signaling to MAPK; these include Ras, RTKs, Src family kinases, other cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases such as Pyk-2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and protein kinase C isoenzymes (14.Gutkind J.S.

For receptors coupling through Gq, one possible Ras-independent mechanism is activation of phospholipase Cβ leading to IP3 and diacylglycerol production, followed by PKC activation (21.Harden T.K.

Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). GPCRs can also activate the MAP kinase cascade in a Ras-dependent manner (25.Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Daaka Y. Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19125-19132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar); thus, signaling from Gi-coupled receptors to MAPK is largely Ras-dependent, and involves βγ subunits, rather than Gα subunits (14.Gutkind J.S.

Bruton's tyrosine kinase is directly stimulated by Gαq (28.Bence K. Ma W. Kozasa T. Huang X.Y. Nature. 1997; 389: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), while members of the Src family have also been implicated in linking certain GPCRs to MAPK (29.Igishi T. Gutkind J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 30.Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lansing T.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1185-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In some circumstances, a mechanism for signaling from GPCRs to MAPK involves a Src-dependent phosphorylation of the EGF receptor and subsequent activation of Ras (32.Luttrell L.M. Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4637-4644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The FAK-related kinase CADTK (Pyk-2) has also been implicated in mitogenic GPCR signaling, particularly in neuronal cells (33.Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 34.Soltoff S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23110-23117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recently there have been some important and novel developments concerning the role of receptor endocytosis in GPCR signaling. Thus, dynamin-mediated endocytosis has been shown to be essential for activation of the MAPK cascade by β2-adrenergic receptors (35.Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S.G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). This theme has been further developed in showing that β-arrestin recruits Src to agonist-occupied β2adrenergic receptors, which then traffic to dynamin-regulated, clathrin-coated pits, and are internalized as a necessary part of the signal transduction process (36.Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). Thus, a number of distinct molecular mechanisms are likely to link GPCRs to mitogeneic signaling. It is important to note that signaling pathways are often very context-dependent; for example, the linkages between individual G protein subfamilies and MAPK activation are quite different in fibroblasts and neuronal cells (37.Williams N.G. Zhong H. Minneman K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24624-24632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is unlikely that any one mechanism will account for all aspects of signal transduction between GPCRs and mitogenic pathways.Over the last few years, a number of interesting connections between integrins and GPCRs have emerged. For example, several GPCR agonists including bombesin, gastrin, endothelin, and various muscarinic agents can induce activation and autophosphorylation of FAK (38.Sinnett-Smith J. Zachary I. Valverde A.M. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14261-14268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Rozengurt E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 40.Slack B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7281-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), a cytosolic tyrosine kinase that is also responsive to integrin engagement (41.Hanks S.K. Polte T.R. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The FAK response to bombesin and related agents depends on the integrity of the cytoskeleton and requires functional Rho GTPase (39.Rozengurt E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Activation of FAK via muscarinic acetylcholine receptors can be blocked using RGD peptides that interfere with integrin binding to fibronectin and other extracellular matrix proteins, and it has been suggested that muscarinic signaling activates integrins, which then trigger the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (40.Slack B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7281-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Integrin-mediated cell anchorage has also been implicated in GPCR signaling to the MAPK pathway. Thus, two groups have reported an attenuation of GPCR signaling to MAPK in cells held in suspension (13.Renshaw M. Ren X.-D. Schwartz M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5592-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar,42.Short S. Talbot G. Juliano R.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 169-180Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent report has shown that treatment with RGD peptides, or with the actin de-polymerizing agent cytochalasin D, can block LPA receptor or thrombin receptor activation of MAPK in PC12 cells (43.Della Rocca G.J. Maudsley S. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13978-13984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, there was little effect of these agents in Rat 1 cells, suggesting that the integrin-GPCR connection may be very context dependent.Although the existence of a relationship between integrins and GPCR signaling seems clear, there is little mechanistic understanding of how this might take place. Here we have examined the role of integrin-mediated cell anchorage in one particular GPCR pathway that activates MAPK. P2Y receptors, presumably linked to Gq/11(15.Boarder M.R. Hourani S.M.O. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 99-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 44.Harden T.K. Burnstock G. Dobson J.G. Liang B.T. Linden J. Cardiovascular Biology of Purines. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA2000Google Scholar), were stimulated with agonists including ATP and UTP. The activation of upstream events, including IP3 production and calcium transients, was found to be completely independent of cell anchorage. However, P2Y receptor signaling to downstream events, including activation of MEK and MAPK, was essentially completely dependent on integrin-mediated anchorage to the substratum. Thus, integrins regulate the P2Y GPCR pathway by permitting efficient coupling between upstream and downstream events in the signal transduction cascade.DISCUSSIONAn important new development in signal transduction research is the growing realization that there are critical interconnections between cell adhesion molecules and signaling pathways (5.Aplin A. Howe A. Alahari S. Juliano R.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 197-264PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, the integrin family of cell adhesion receptors has been shown to both directly engage in signaling processes, and to regulate mitogenic signal transduction through RTKs and the canonical Ras-Raf-MAPK cascade (3.Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27268-27274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 9.Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Gutkind J. Yamada K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 12.Lin T. Chen Q. Howe A. Juliano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8849-8852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 13.Renshaw M. Ren X.-D. Schwartz M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5592-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that signals emanating from GPCRs and impinging on MAPK can also be influenced by integrin-mediated cell anchorage, primarily by affecting the linkage between upstream and downstream signaling events. We have focused on the role of anchorage in signaling downstream of P2Y receptor engagement, a pathway that involves the Gqsubfamily of G proteins (44.Harden T.K. Burnstock G. Dobson J.G. Liang B.T. Linden J. Cardiovascular Biology of Purines. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA2000Google Scholar); however, the basic phenomenon of anchorage dependence of MAPK activation is also seen for the LPA receptor, which signals through Gi proteins. While many of the experiments reported here have simply compared suspension-cultured cells to cells attached to fibronectin-coated substrata, the regulation of signaling clearly is an integrin-dependent and not merely an attachment-dependent process. Thus, cells attached via nonspecific interactions to a polylysine-coated substratum behave essentially the same as suspension cells, and quite differently from cells attached to fibronectin via integrins. It should be noted, however, that cells display very different morphologies when plated on polylysine versus fibronectin. Work from our laboratory and from others has shown that the actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in integrin modulation of signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases (64.Aplin A.E. Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). This is also likely to be true for GPCR signaling. Indeed, treatment with cytochalasin D sufficient to cause cell rounding strongly inhibits P2Y receptor signaling to MAPK.2 However, the precise mechanistic basis for the role of the cytoskeleton is not yet defined.A variety of GPCRs have been reported to signal to the mitogenic MAPK cascade, and several possible mechanisms have been suggested (14.Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 18.Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). One plausible mechanism is that GPCRs transactivate the EGF receptor, thus leading to stimulation of the canonical RTK-Ras-MAPK cascade (52.Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Della Rocca G.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31648-31656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). If that were so, then anchorage regulation of GPCR signaling to MAPK might simply be a recapitulation of the previously described anchorage regulation of RTK signaling; however, this does not seem to be the case. We have found no evidence that P2Y agonists activate the EGF receptor or trigger tyrosine phosphorylation of key RTK substrates such as the Shc adaptor protein. In addition, several other aspects of the P2Y signaling process described here, for example the lack of c-Raf activation, suggest that the P2Y pathway is quite different from the classical RTK-Ras-Raf-MAPK cascade delineated for polypeptide growth factor signaling. A very recent report concerning α-adrenergic signaling in PC12 cells also suggests that receptor tyrosine kinases and GPCRs couple to MAPK via distinct pathways (65.Zhong H. Minneman K.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 889-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar); this latter report did not deal with the role of cell adhesion, however.An important consideration here is the locus in the signaling cascade that is regulated by integrin-mediated anchorage. In the case of GPCR signaling, cell anchorage could potentially regulate key upstream aspects of the transduction process including the abundance of cell surface receptors, their coupling to G proteins, or the coupling between G proteins and membrane-bound enzyme effectors such as phospholipase Cβ. However, this seems not to be the case for anchorage regulation of P2Y receptor signaling. Thus, agonist-induced IP3 (and presumably diacylglycerol) formation and calcium mobilization take place equally well (or perhaps slightly better) in suspension cells as in cells anchored via integrins. This implies that the entire upstream aspect of the signaling cascade is intact. Our studies have also shown that both calcium mobilization and PKC activation seem to be essential for signal transmission downstream to MAPK. Thus, anchorage regulation of P2Y signaling seems to take place somewhere below the generation of calcium transients and diacylglycerol, but at or above the activation of MEK.We have examined some possible intermediate components in the P2Y signaling cascade, including Raf and MEK. Clearly, MEK and MAPK act as a module, with both showing dramatic anchorage dependence of activation. As we demonstrate above, it is unlikely that c-Raf has a role in P2Y signaling to MAPK; however, other MEKKs may be able to substitute for Raf (63.Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). In addition, it is clear that a PKC isoform plays an important role, perhaps acting via a MEKK, or by more directly activating MEK and thus MAPK. While many isoforms of PKC can activate MEK, the PKCζ isoform does this in a c-Raf independent manner (66.Schonwasser D.C. Marais R.M. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). It is thus interesting to note that in HEK293 cells, P2Y2 signaling to MAPK is thought to involve PKCζ rather than other isoforms (57.Gao Z. Chen T. Weber M.J. Linden J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5872-5980Google Scholar). However, we have not yet identified the PKC isoform involved in P2Y signaling to MAPK in HUVECs or ECV304 cells. It is also interesting that calcium-mediated activation of MAPK in PC12 cells and epithelial cells has been shown to be independent of Raf (53.Li X. Lee J.W. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2574-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 67.Egea J. Espinet C. Comella J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 75-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition to testifying to the complexity of signaling pathways, the above-mentioned examples indicate the existence of calcium-regulated pathways that signal to MAPK in a Ras- and Raf-independent manner. Our current observations on P2Y signaling to MAPK in endothelial-like cells are consistent with a model involving activation of calcium-dependent kinases, and/or of a PKC isoform, leading to activation of the MEK/MAPK module in a c-Raf-independent manner. A model depicting our current understanding of the P2Y pathway and the possible locus of regulation by integrins is provided in Fig.6.The precise mechanism whereby integrin engagement regulates GPCR signaling to MAPK has not yet been clearly defined. A likely possibility involves integrin-mediated recruitment of focal contact and cytoskeletal components that then form a scaffold to allow efficient assembly of the various components of the signaling pathway. For example, both MAPK (9.Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Gutkind J. Yamada K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar) and some forms of PKC (68.Keenan C. Kelleher D. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) have been reported to be enriched in integrin-dependent focal contacts, thus possibly allowing proximity and efficient interaction of these components. This scaffolding concept has been widely discussed in the context of integrin regulation of RTK signaling (4.Howe A. Aplin A. Alahari S. Juliano R. Cur. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 51.Aplin A.E. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 695-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 69.Yamada K.M. Geiger B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), as well as in the larger context of regulation of mitogenic signaling cascades (63.Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). In addition, some current models of GPCR function have also emphasized the key role of subcellular localization or compartmentalization in efficient signaling to mitogenic cascades (36.Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar,70.Neubig R.R. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Thus, integrin regulation of GPCR-induced MAPK activation may represent an important example of the relationship between subcellular architecture and the efficient functioning of signal transduction cascades. Normal cells require both soluble mitogenic factors and anchorage to a solid substratum in order to proceed through the cell cycle, while transformed cells have abrogated the anchorage requirement (1.Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for anchorage regulation of cell growth is rapidly becoming better understood (2.Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Recent observations have shown that the integrin family of cell adhesion receptors plays a key role in modulating several aspects of mitogenic signal transduction pathways emanating from RTKs1 (1.Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 2.Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 3.Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Thus, in some systems, integrin-mediated cell adhesion has been reported to increase the efficiency of RTK activation and autophosphorylation (7.Miyamoto S. Katz B.Z. Lafrenie R.M. Yamada K.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 857: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 8.Sundberg C. Rubin K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 741-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 9.Miyamoto S.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), whereas, in other cases, integrins have been shown to enhance the coupling between upstream and downstream events in the canonical RTK-Ras-MAP kinase signaling cascade (12.Lin T. Chen Q. Howe A. Juliano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8849-8852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 13.Renshaw M. Ren X.-D. Schwartz M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5592-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). As with RTKs, certain GPCRs can also engage in mitogenic signal transduction. A number of GPCRs, operating through several subfamilies of heterotrimeric G proteins have been shown to activate the MAP kinase cascade; this includes receptors for thrombin, bombesin, bradykinin, eicosanoids, lysophosphatidic acid, and various muscarinic, α-adrenergic, and nucleotide (P2Y) agonists (14.Gutkind J.S.

The data presented in this paper provide an analysis of translesion synthesis past cisplatin- and oxaliplatin-DNA adducts by pol β functioning in both distributive and processive modes using primer extension and steady-state kinetic experiments. Translesion synthesis past Pt-DNA adducts was greater with gapped DNA templates than with single-stranded DNA templates. In the processive mode pol β did not discriminate between cisplatin and oxaliplatin adducts, while in the distributive mode it displayed about 2-fold increased ability for translesion synthesis past oxaliplatin compared with cisplatin adducts. The differentiation between cisplatin and oxaliplatin adducts resulted from a K m-mediated increase in the efficiency of dCTP incorporation across from the 3′-G of oxaliplatin-GG adducts. Rates of misincorporation across platinated guanines determined by the steady-state kinetic assay were higher in reactions with primed single-stranded templates than with gapped DNA and a slight increase in the misincorporation of dTTP across from the 3′-G was found for oxaliplatin compared with cisplatin adducts.

Mammalian cells contain a post-replication repair pathway that allows cells to overcome replication blocks caused by these adducts. Post-replication repair can be either error-free, which would increase cellular tolerance of bulky adducts, or error-prone, which would increase the mutagenicity of bulky adducts. Previous studies have shown that mammalian cells possess the ability to replicate DNA containing cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II))1adducts and that cisplatin-resistant cell lines have a greater ability to replicate past Pt-DNA adducts than their parental cisplatin-sensitive cell lines (1.Gibbons G.R.

In addition, pol β is able to elongate the arrested replication products of polymerases α and δ, thus showing its capacity to successfully complete stalled replication (5.Hoffmann J.-S.

The full-length DNA products of translesion synthesis by pol β contain a high frequency of mutations in the vicinity of the Pt-DNA adducts (6.Hoffmann J.S. Pillaire M.J. Garcia-Estefania D. Lapalu S. Villani G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15386-15392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). On the basis of these data, Hoffmann et al. (5.Hoffmann J.-S. Pillaire M.-J.

In support of this hypothesis, increased cisplatin resistance (9.Scanlon K.J. Kashani-Sabet M. Miyachi H. Cancer Invest. 1989; 7: 563-569Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 10.Kraker A.J. Moore C.W.

This has lead to the suggestion that overexpression of pol β could be associated with cisplatin resistance and a mutator phenotype (12.Canitrot Y. Cazaux C. Frechet M. Bouayadi K. Lesca C. Salles B.

FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1107-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). If this hypothesis is correct it could be significant, since some spontaneously occurring tumors appear to overexpress pol β (15.Srivastava D.K. Husain I. Arteaga C.L. Wilson S.H. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and pol β gene amplification has been detected in tumors from patients that have failed cisplatin therapy (9.Scanlon K.J. Kashani-Sabet M. Miyachi H. Cancer Invest. 1989; 7: 563-569Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although cell lines expressing pol β antisense RNA show decreased sensitivity to cisplatin (16.Horton J.K. Srivastava D.K. Zmudzka B.Z. Wilson S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3810-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), no increased sensitivity to cisplatin has been seen in pol β-deleted cells (17.Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Thus, the available data suggest that pol β overexpression might represent an important mechanism of platinum drug resistance and mutagenicity, but it is not yet clear whether pol β makes a significant contribution to error-prone translesion synthesis at normal levels of expression. Although to date there is no direct evidence showing that pol β actually carries out error-prone DNA synthesis past bulky DNA adductsin vivo, one can envision at least two models for its involvement in translesion synthesis during in vivoreplication. 1) Pol β might substitute for a replication complex that had stalled at Pt-DNA lesion sites during chromosomal replication. After error-prone translesion synthesis, pol β would dissociate. Then the replication complex could reassociate at the nascent primer terminus downstream from the lesion and complete DNA replication (18.Efrati E. Tocco G. Eritja R. Wilson S.H. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2559-2569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). 2) Alternatively, pol β might be involved in the error-prone filling of single-stranded gaps in the daughter strand opposite the lesion. These gaps could be formed as a part of lagging strand synthesis or as a result of activation of alternative origins of replication in damaged chromosomes after the progression of the active replication fork is blocked by a DNA lesion (19.Naegeli H. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 557-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Both the extent and fidelity of translesion synthesis by pol β could be affected by the DNA substrate (single-stranded versusgapped). It has been shown that DNA synthesis by pol β is distributive on DNA substrates in which primer is annealed to a single-stranded template, while pol β conducts processive synthesis on short gapped DNA templates with a 5′-phosphate at the end of the gap (16.Horton J.K. Srivastava D.K. Zmudzka B.Z. Wilson S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3810-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 17.Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K.

With gaps of 2–6 nucleotides pol β exhibits increased catalytic efficiency (23.Osheroff W.P. Jung H.K. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol.

However, the overall base substitution fidelity of pol β appears to be very similar with 2–6 nucleotide gaps and single-stranded templates (23.Osheroff W.P. Jung H.K. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H.

The platinum complex (trans-R,R)1,2-diamminocyclohexaneoxalatoplatinum(II) (oxaliplatin) is currently in clinical trial for the treatment of tumors with intrinsic and acquired resistance to cisplatin. Both cisplatin and oxaliplatin form the same types adducts on the DNA, with the most abundant being Pt(GpG) intrastrand diadducts (26.Eastman A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3927-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 27.Eastman A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1987; 34: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 28.Saris C.P. van der Vaart P.J.M. Rietbroek R.C. Blommaert F.A.

Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, the adducts formed by oxaliplatin contain (trans-R,R)1,2-diamminocyclohexane (dach) carrier ligands, while the adducts formed by cisplatin containcis-diammine carrier ligands. Previous data from our laboratory suggest that mammalian cells are able to replicate DNA in the presence of platinum-DNA adducts and that the extent of replicative bypass in vivo can be influenced by the carrier ligand of the adducts (1.Gibbons G.R. Kaufmann W.K. Chaney S.G. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 2253-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 2.Mamenta E.L. Poma E.E. Kaufmann W.K. Delmastro D.A. Grady H.L. Chaney S.G.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3579-3585PubMed Google Scholar). We also have shown recently that pol β can discriminate between cisplatin and oxaliplatin adducts in vitro. The present study was designed to evaluate whether the efficiency and carrier ligand specificity of replicative bypass past Pt-DNA adducts by pol β could be determined by the mode of translesion synthesis (distributive synthesis on single-stranded DNAversus processive synthesis on gapped DNA) and whether the fidelity of replicative bypass depends on the carrier ligand of the Pt-DNA adducts and/or on the DNA template structure. Primer-templates were constructed from synthetic oligonucleotides as described previously (8.Vaisman A. Lim S.E. Patrick S.M. Copeland W.C. Hinkle D.C. Turchi J.J. Chaney S.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11026-11039Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, cisplatin was obtained from Sigma; Pt(dach)Cl2 (the biotransformation product of oxaliplatin) was provided by Dr. S. D. Wyrick (University of North Carolina). All platination reactions were carried out with aquated derivatives of the platinum complexes obtained by overnight stirring in the dark at room temperature of a solution containing either cisplatin or Pt(dach)Cl2 and 1.98 equivalents of silver nitrate. The final concentration of aquated derivatives of the platinum complexes was 40 mm. Platination of a 12-mer oligonucleotide containing a single GG sequence within a StuI restriction site (TCTAGGCCTTCT) was performed for 2 h at 37 °C in the dark with the 2:1 drug to oligonucleotide ratio. The oligonucleotides containing a single platinum adduct were separated from unplatinated impurities by electrophoresis on a 20% polyacrylamide gel. DNA was eluted from gel slices and desalted using CENTRI-SPINTM-10 columns (Princeton Separations, Inc). The templates used for primer extension and steady-state kinetic experiments are listed in Fig. 1. Site-specifically platinated 44-mer templates were constructed as described previously (8.Vaisman A. Lim S.E. Patrick S.M. Copeland W.C. Hinkle D.C. Turchi J.J. Chaney S.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11026-11039Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar): platinated 12-mers were ligated with a 14-mer (left end) and an 18-mer (right end) using a 35-mer as a scaffold. Control 44-mer templates were prepared using unplatinated 12-mer by the same procedure. After 16-h ligation at 16 °C by T4 DNA ligase, templates were purified by MicroSpin G-25 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), restricted by StuI to ensure the absence of any unplatinated oligonucleotides, and purified on 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Control experiments were performed to ensure the purity of platinated templates as described previously (8.Vaisman A. Lim S.E. Patrick S.M. Copeland W.C. Hinkle D.C. Turchi J.J. Chaney S.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11026-11039Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). StuI cleavage was used in all primer extension assays described below, and only StuI-resistant elongation products were quantitated as translesion synthesis to control for any loss of platinum adducts during the incubation.StuI cleaves >95% of undamaged templates elongated past the StuI restriction site, but it is almost completely blocked by the presence of either cisplatin or oxaliplatin adducts (8.Vaisman A.

The 22-, 24-, or 25-mer primers were 5′-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, according to the manufacturer's protocol. 14- and 16-mer downstream oligonucleotides used to form 6- or 5-base-gapped templates were 5′-end-phosphorylated with unlabeled ATP. DNA substrates were prepared by annealing undamaged or platinated 44-mer templates with 32P-labeled primers alone or in combination with downstream oligonucleotides at a 1.2:1: (2.Mamenta E.L. Poma E.E. Kaufmann W.K. Delmastro D.A. Grady H.L. Chaney S.G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3500-3505PubMed Google Scholar) molar ratio. Hybridization was done by heating the mixture of required oligonucleotides in an annealing buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl) for 10 min at 80 °C followed by slow cooling to room temperature over a period of about 2 h. Annealing efficiencies were >95%, as evidenced by the different mobility of the 32P-labeled primers before and after hybridization to the template on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (data not shown). Recombinant human pol β was generously provided by Dr. S. Wilson (NIEHS) (specific activity 1.4 units/μg). One unit of polymerase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required for the incorporation of 1 nmol of dTMP in 1 min at 25 °C using poly(dA)-p(dT)20 as a template-primer). Primer extension assays were performed as described previously (8.Vaisman A. Lim S.E. Patrick S.M. Copeland W.C. Hinkle D.C. Turchi J.J. Chaney S.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11026-11039Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) using 22/44 and 24/44 primer-templates with or without 16- or 14-mer downstream oligonucleotides (Fig. 1, A–D). 200 fmol of primer-template (expressed as primer termini) was incubated with pol β at 37 °C in 10-μl reactions containing 500 μm dNTPs unless otherwise indicated. Reaction times and enzyme concentrations are indicated in the figures. Reactions were terminated by heating at 80 °C for 10 min. Each reaction mixture was split into two aliquots, one of which was incubated with StuI restriction enzyme. Aliquots were mixed with 0.7 volume of formamide loading dye solution containing 500 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue in 90% formamide. Before loading onto the gel, the reactions were denatured by heating at 100 °C for 5 min and immediately transferred to ice for 5 min. Products were resolved by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8 m urea, 16% acrylamide, 4 h at 2000 V) and then visualized and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. The extent of translesion synthesis on damaged templates was calculated as the sum of elongation products past the platinum adducts as a percent of total primer termini (elongated and unelongated). Steady-state kinetic parameters K m and V max for dCTP incorporation were measured in standing-start reactions as described previously (8.Vaisman A. Lim S.E. Patrick S.M. Copeland W.C. Hinkle D.C. Turchi J.J. Chaney S.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11026-11039Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) using the 44-mer templates hybridized to 24- or 25-mer primers alone or in combination with downstream 16-mer oligonucleotides (Fig. 1, B, D, E, and F). 150 fmol of DNA substrates were replicated at 37 °C in 10-μl reaction mixtures containing 5 fmol of pol β and variable concentrations of dCTP. Initial time course studies indicated that under standard conditions the reaction velocity is linear (i.e. conforms to steady-state kinetics) for up to 12 min for single-stranded templates and up to 6 min for gapped templates (data not shown). Less than 20% of the primers were extended under the steady-state conditions ensuring single hit conditions. As expected in steady state,V max values were proportional to enzyme concentration (data not shown). The velocity of dCTP incorporation opposite the template 3′-G and 5′-G sites was determined using the equation υ = (I3′-G + I5′-G)/tI−1with templates B and D (Fig. 1) for the 3′-G or υ = I5′-G/tI−1 with templates E and F for the 5′-G (where t is the reaction time in min; I−1, I3′-G, and I5′-G are the integrated gel band intensities at sites −1 (corresponding to unextended primer, 3′-G, and 5′-G, respectively). The relationship between υ and dCTP concentration conformed to a Michaelis-Menten equation, as indicated by linearity in a Hanes-Woolf plot of [dCTP]/υ versus [dCTP]. V max(the maximum value of reaction velocity) and K m(dCTP concentration at which the reaction velocity is half-maximal) were determined from a Hanes-Woolf plot by linear least squares fit. The efficiency of nucleotide insertion by polymerase (f) was calculated as V max/K m. To facilitate comparison of values for different Pt adducts, the relative insertion efficiency f rel also is reported:f rel =f Pt/f control. To measure nucleotide misinsertion opposite Pt-GG adducts, DNA substrates shown in Fig. 1, B, D, E, and F were used. 150 fmol of these DNA substrates were incubated with 5 fmol of pol β and 5 mm of each dNTP individually for 15 and 30 min for control and damaged templates, respectively. Reactions were terminated, and products were analyzed as described above. The kinetics of dTTP misincorporation opposite platinated and undamaged GG sites using templates shown in Fig. 1,C, E, and F, were determined in reactions similar to ones described in the previous section. To detect extension products resulting from nucleotide misincorporation, it was necessary to increase incubation times from 1–2 to 15–30 min. The dTTP misinsertion efficiency (f mis) was determined as the ratio of dTTP to dCTP insertion efficiencies. In a previous study (8.Vaisman A. Lim S.E. Patrick S.M. Copeland W.C. Hinkle D.C. Turchi J.J. Chaney S.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11026-11039Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) we established the carrier-ligand specificity of pol β catalyzed translesion synthesis using primer-templates where the primer was placed either 2 or 53 bases before the GG sites containing the platinum adduct. In those studies, oxaliplatin-GG adducts were bypassed to a greater extent than cisplatin-GG adducts, and the placement of the primer relative to the Pt-GG adduct had no effect on the carrier-ligand specificity of translesion synthesis. To study the effect of template structure on the extent and specificity of translesion synthesis by pol β in more detail, we have performed the primer extension assay using undamaged or site-specifically platinated templates of different structure (Fig.1, A–D). All these DNA substrates contained the same 44-mer template. In addition to a 22-mer primer used previously in primer extension assays (Fig. 1 A), we have utilized a 24-mer primer (Fig. 1 B) to examine the capacity of pol β to initiate DNA synthesis from the base preceding the lesion. The same experiments were also carried out using 6-base gapped DNA templates with the lesion either in the center of the gap (Fig. 1 C) or at the beginning of the gap (Fig.1 D). Fig. 2, A–H, shows the time course for elongation of 22-mer or 24-mer primers on 44-mer single-stranded and gapped DNA templates, either undamaged or containing a single cisplatin adduct. The positions of primers, full-length reaction product (44-mer), and template sequence are indicated. The enzyme to DNA substrate ratio was approximately 1:4 in these experiments, which corresponds to the minimum amount of pol β necessary to ensure measurable translesion synthesis on all templates. As expected for such reaction conditions, distinct bands corresponding to practically every nucleotide in the sequence were clearly visible when undamaged single-stranded templates were used (Fig. 2,A and E). Such a pattern is consistent with the distributive nature of pol β. Singhal and Wilson (30.Singhal R.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15906-15911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown previously that pol β fills gaps of up to 6 nucleotides by a processive mechanism that requires a phosphate group at the 5′-end of the gap. In agreement with these findings we observed no strong pause sites within the 6-nucleotide gaps on undamaged DNA substrates (Fig. 2,C and G). At the pol β concentrations used in these experiments, some strand displacement was observed with gapped DNA templates. The extent of strand displacement depended on the DNA substrate utilized. For example, with the 22/44/16 DNA template (Fig.1 C) there was a major accumulation of products varying in length from 28 nucleotides (corresponding to the end of the gap) to 32 nucleotides (corresponding to strand displacement of four nucleotides). This was accompanied by significant time-dependent strand displacement to the end of the template (Fig. 2 C). However, with the 24/44/14 DNA substrate (Fig. 1 D) the major stop sites varied in length from 30 nucleotides (end of the gap) to 32 nucleotides (strand displacement of two nucleotides) (Fig.2 G). This was accompanied by limited strand displacement of the remaining duplex DNA, which did not increase with time. The difference in strand displacement between the 22/44/16 and 24/44/14 DNA substrates is most likely due to the stability of the duplex region immediately downstream of the gap. For the 24/44/14 DNA substrate, the first 5 base pairs of the duplex region downstream of the gap are all G·Cs, whereas the 22/44/16 DNA substrate contains an A·T base pair located 2 bases downstream from the gap. Primer extension on all damaged templates was substantially reduced (Fig. 2, B, D, F, and H). When single-stranded templates were used, the decrease in the amount of full-length product was mainly due to a strong inhibition of dNTP incorporation opposite the template 3′-G(Pt) (24-mer band), Fig. 2, B andF) and 3′ to the lesion (22- and 23-mer bands), Fig.2 B). Weaker inhibition of dNTP incorporation opposite the 5′-G(Pt) (25-mer band), Fig. 2, B and F) and of chain extension from 5′-G(Pt) (26-mer band), Fig. 2, B andF) was also observed. Primer extension on damaged gapped DNA templates produced multiple stop sites, although the relative distribution of the products of replication was somewhat different from that seen with single-stranded templates. Stop sites 3′ from the lesion weakened. This was most apparent for the DNA substrates with the Pt adduct in the center of the gap (compare the 23- and 24-mer bands in gel 2D (gapped DNA) with gel 2B (single-stranded DNA)). In addition, the stop site across from the 3′-G(Pt) became more prominent and additional pause sites 1 and 2 nucleotides beyond the adduct appeared. This was most apparent for the DNA substrates with the Pt adduct at the beginning of the gap (compare the 27- and 28-mer bands in gel 2H (gapped DNA) and gel 2F (single-stranded DNA)). Some strand displacement was seen with both gapped DNA templates with platinum adducts. However, in contrast to the pattern of strand displacement for undamaged templates, less strand displacement was seen for the 22/44/16 DNA template (Fig. 2 D) than for 24/44/14 DNA template (Fig.2 H). The extent of translesion synthesis past the cisplatin-GG and oxaliplatin-GG adducts was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures” and is summarized in Fig. 2, Iand J (the stop sites were identical for cisplatin- and oxaliplatin-GG adducts, so the gels for the experiment with oxaliplatin adduct are not shown). Levels of translesion synthesis past platinum adducts (sum of products longer than 26 nucleotides (Fig. 2, B, D, F, and H) as a percent of total primer termini) appeared to be similar for both the 22/44 and 24/44 single-stranded DNA templates (Fig. 2, I and J, closed symbols). The extent of translesion synthesis past Pt-DNA adducts was increased 1.5–3-fold with gapped DNA templates (Fig. 2,I and J, open symbols) relative to single-stranded primed DNA templates. Furthermore, a higher extent of translesion replication was observed for DNA tem"

However, limited insight into the specificity of arrestin-mediated regulation of GPCRs is currently available. Recently, we used an antisense strategy to reduce arrestin levels in HEK293 cells and characterize the role of arrestins on endogenous Gs-coupled receptors (Mundell, S. J., Loudon, R. B., and Benovic, J. L. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 8723–8732). Here, we characterized GPCRs coupled to either Gq (M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M1AchR) and P2y1 and P2y2purinergic receptors) or Gi (somatostatin and AT1 angiotensin receptors) in wild type and arrestin antisense HEK293 cells. The agonist-specific desensitization of the M1Ach and somatostatin receptors was significantly attenuated in antisense-expressing cells, whereas desensitization of P2y1and P2y2 purinergic and AT1 angiotensin receptors was unaffected by reduced arrestin levels. To further examine arrestin/GPCR specificity, we studied the effects of endogenous GPCR activation on the redistribution of arrestin-2 epitope tagged with the green fluorescent protein (arrestin-2-GFP). These studies revealed a receptor-specific movement of arrestin-2-GFP that mirrored the arrestin-receptor specificity observed in the antisense cells. Thus, agonist-induced activation of endogenous β2-adrenergic, prostaglandin E2, M1Ach, and somatostatin receptors induced arrestin-2-GFP redistribution to early endosomes, whereas P2y1 and P2y2 purinergic and AT1 angiotensin receptor activation did not. Thus, endogenous arrestins mediate the regulation of selective Gq- and Gi-coupled receptors in HEK293 cells. Arrestins play an important role in regulating desensitization and trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). However, limited insight into the specificity of arrestin-mediated regulation of GPCRs is currently available. Recently, we used an antisense strategy to reduce arrestin levels in HEK293 cells and characterize the role of arrestins on endogenous Gs-coupled receptors (Mundell, S. J., Loudon, R. B., and Benovic, J. L. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 8723–8732). Here, we characterized GPCRs coupled to either Gq (M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M1AchR) and P2y1 and P2y2purinergic receptors) or Gi (somatostatin and AT1 angiotensin receptors) in wild type and arrestin antisense HEK293 cells. The agonist-specific desensitization of the M1Ach and somatostatin receptors was significantly attenuated in antisense-expressing cells, whereas desensitization of P2y1and P2y2 purinergic and AT1 angiotensin receptors was unaffected by reduced arrestin levels. To further examine arrestin/GPCR specificity, we studied the effects of endogenous GPCR activation on the redistribution of arrestin-2 epitope tagged with the green fluorescent protein (arrestin-2-GFP). These studies revealed a receptor-specific movement of arrestin-2-GFP that mirrored the arrestin-receptor specificity observed in the antisense cells. Thus, agonist-induced activation of endogenous β2-adrenergic, prostaglandin E2, M1Ach, and somatostatin receptors induced arrestin-2-GFP redistribution to early endosomes, whereas P2y1 and P2y2 purinergic and AT1 angiotensin receptor activation did not. Thus, endogenous arrestins mediate the regulation of selective Gq- and Gi-coupled receptors in HEK293 cells. muscarinic acetylcholine receptor green fluorescent protein G protein-coupled receptor human embryonic kidney cells phosphate-buffered saline analysis of variance Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium somatostatin Arrestins mediate the desensitization and internalization of a number of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1(1). Agonist-dependent phosphorylation of GPCRs by G protein-coupled receptor kinases promotes the high affinity binding of arrestins (1.Carman C. Benovic J.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), which in turn sterically inhibits G protein interaction with the receptor, thereby terminating agonist-mediated signaling (2.Kuhn H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), highlighting the important role of these proteins in receptor regulation. Recent evidence indicates that arrestins not only bind to GPCRs but also associate with clathrin heavy chains to promote GPCR internalization via clathrin-coated pits (5.Goodman Jr., O.B.

This process has been characterized extensively for the β2-adrenergic receptor (5.Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L.

Whereas many GPCRs undergo agonist-promoted internalization, the functional role of this process may vary between receptors. For example, internalization plays an important role in the resensitization of the β2-adrenergic receptor (9.Yu S.S. Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorff W.P. J. Biol.

Although providing important insight into arrestin function and receptor specificity, one of the inherent drawbacks with this approach is the potential for nonspecific effects associated with protein overexpression. In a recent study we demonstrated that an antisense strategy can be successfully employed to reduce endogenous arrestin levels and effect changes in the internalization, desensitization, and resensitization of the Gs-coupled β2-adrenergic receptor (16.Mundell S.J. Loudon R.B. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8723-8732Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Moreover, the regulation of two other endogenous Gs-coupled receptors, the A2 adenosine and prostaglandin E2, was also shown to be affected by reductions in arrestin levels (16.Mundell S.J. Loudon R.B. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8723-8732Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These antisense-expressing cells therefore represent a novel system in which to further explore the involvement of arrestins in the desensitization of native receptors in intact cells. Although numerous studies have examined the role of arrestins in regulating the responsiveness of the β2-adrenergic receptor and other Gs-coupled receptors, considerably less attention has been paid to GPCRs coupled to Gi (which inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity) and Gq (which stimulate inositol phosphate production and Ca2+ release). Here we utilized HEK293 cells expressing arrestin-2 and arrestin-3 antisense constructs to perform a systematic analysis of arrestin specificity for regulating signaling by endogenous Gq-coupled P2y1 and P2y2 purinergic (17.Schachter J.B. Sromek S.M. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and M1Ach receptors (18.Conklin B.R. Chabre O. Wong Y.H. Federman A.D. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 31-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Gi-coupled somatostatin and AT1 angiotensin receptors. In addition, arrestin/GPCR specificity was further characterized by examining changes in arrestin-2-green fluorescent protein (GFP) redistribution induced by endogenous receptor activation. Human embryonic kidney cells transformed with the EBNA vector (HEK293-EBNA) were purchased from Invitrogen. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Life Technologies Inc. Fugene-6 transfection agent, hygromycin, and Geneticin were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. [3H]cAMP and [3H]inositol were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Rhodamine-conjugated transferrin, fura-2, and lysosomal tracker red were purchased from Molecular Probes. All other reagents were from Sigma. HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (complete media) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. For culture of HEK293-EBNA cells stably transfected with pcDNA3 or pcDNA3 containing antisense cDNAs for arrestin-2 or arrestin-3, media was supplemented with 400 μg/ml hygromycin and 200 μg/ml Geneticin to maintain plasmid expression (16.Mundell S.J. Loudon R.B. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8723-8732Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For transient transfections of arrestin-2-GFP, HEK293 cells were grown in 100-mm dishes to 80–90% confluence and transfected with 1–5 μg of DNA using Fugene-6 following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated with a DNA/Fugene mixture for 24 h, the media was replaced, and the cells analyzed 48 h after transfection. HEK293 cells were seeded at a density of 80,000 cells/well in 12-well plates and labeled the following day for 18–24 h withmyo-[3H]inositol (4 μCi/ml) in DMEM (high glucose, without inositol) as described previously (19.Parent J.L. Labrecque P. Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8941-8948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). After labeling, cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated in prewarmed DMEM containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 20 mm LiCl for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then stimulated with either ATP (100 μm), UTP (100 μm), 2-methyl-ADP (100 μm) or carbachol (1 mm). Reactions were terminated by removing the stimulation media and adding 0.8 ml of 0.4m perchloric acid. Samples were harvested in Eppendorf tubes, and 0.4 ml of 0.72 n KOH, 0.6 mKHCO3 were added. Tubes were vortexed and centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. Inositol phosphates were separated on Dowex AG 1-X8 columns. Total labeled inositol phosphates were counted by liquid scintillation. The intracellular free Ca2+ concentration was determined using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (fura-2/AM) as previously reported (20.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK-293 cells were loaded with fura-2/AM to a final concentration of 3 μm in complete medium and incubated at 37 °C for 50 min with stirring. After the loading, the cells were pelleted and washed twice with Locke's solution (154 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4) to remove the extracellular dye. For the fluorimetric measurement of the [Ca2+]i, 1 × 106 cells were placed into a quartz cuvette in a thermostatically controlled cell holder at 37 °C with continuous stirring. Fluorescence was measured at 340- and 380-nm excitation and 510-nm emission. Results were expressed as the ratio of the fluorescence at the two excitation wavelengths, which is proportional to the [Ca2+]i. To generate concentration response curves, cells were exposed once to varying concentrations of ATP, ADP, or carbachol until a maximum response was attained (<30 s). To evaluate GPCR desensitization, cells were incubated with either ATP (0.01 nm–100 μm) or carbachol (0.1 nm–1 mm) for 30 min, washed, and then rechallenged with either compound. Where required, drugs were added directly to the culture medium for varying times. Cells were harvested in 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted by centrifugation at 200 × g for 1 min. The resulting pellets were washed twice in 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and frozen at −70 °C until use. Adenylyl cyclase activity was measured using a protein binding assay (21.Mundell S.J. Benovic J.L. Kelly E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cell pellets were thawed and homogenized in a glass Dounce homogenizer containing ice-cold homogenization buffer (0.3 m sucrose, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). A 40-μl sample of homogenate was then added to 30 μl of premix buffer (final assay concentration, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm Mg2+, 1 mm ATP, 1 μm GTP, 250 μmRo201724 (4-(3-butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl) imidazolidin-2-one) as phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 20 mm creatine phosphate, and 130 units/ml creatine phosphokinase) and 30 μl of drug at the relevant concentration. The tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid; the tubes were placed on ice for 10 min. Precipitated protein was pelleted by centrifugation at 2900 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C, and 50 μl of the resulting supernatant was added to 50 μl of 1 m NaOH and 200 μl of TE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 4 mm EDTA, pH 7.4); 50 μl of this solution was then added to fresh tubes containing 100 μl of TE buffer, 100 μl of [3H]cAMP in TE buffer (∼20,000 cpm), and 100 μl of binding protein in TE buffer (to give a final concentration of ∼750 μg of protein/ml; prepared from bovine adrenal cortex). Tubes containing 50 μl of standard concentrations of cAMP (0.125–20 pmol) were used to construct a standard curve. After a 2-h incubation at 4 °C, 200 μl of TE buffer containing charcoal (Norit GSX; 50 mg/ml final concentration) and bovine serum albumin (2 mg/ml final concentration) were added, and 15 min later, the tubes were centrifuged at 2900 × gfor 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was transferred into vials for liquid scintillation counting. Standard curve data were fitted to a logistic expression (GraphPAD Software, San Diego, CA), and the unknowns were read off. Protein content of homogenates was determined (22.Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Niederdraing N. Neumann E. Frode R. Lass H. Van Koppen C.J. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 354: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and adenylyl cyclase activity was expressed as pmol of cAMP/min/mg of protein. To assess the distribution of arrestin-2 in living cells, HEK293 cells (60-mm dish) were transfected with 0.25 μg of arrestin-2-GFP. Cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and mounted on an imaging chamber (Warner Instrument Corp) equipped with an inlet port through which media and drugs could be perfused. For experiments analyzing transferrin distribution, cells were incubated for 15 min with 200 μg/ml rhodamine-conjugated transferrin on glass coverslips. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS before imaging then examined by microscopy on a Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescence microscope using a Plan-Apo 60 × 1.40 NA oil immersion objective. For experiments analyzing rab-5 distribution, arrestin-2 GFP-transfected cells were incubated with a rab-5-specific antibody (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at 4 °C in DMEM supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were washed twice with PBS and then treated with drug for 30 min at 37 °C in DMEM. The cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, PBS for 15 min at room temperature, washed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100/PBS/CaCl2 for 10 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was blocked with buffer A (0.05% Triton X-100/PBS/CaCl2 containing 5% nonfat dry milk) for 30 min at 37 °C. Goat anti-mouse rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) was then added at a dilution of 1:150 in buffer A for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed 6 times with permeabilization buffer, with the last wash left at 37 °C for 30 min. Finally, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde as described. Coverslips were mounted using Slow-Fade mounting medium (Molecular Probes) and examined by microscopy as described above. All images were collected using QED Camera software and processed with Adobe Photoshop. For confocal microscopy, cells were prepared in the same manner, and images were obtained on a Bio-Rad MRC-Zeiss Axiovert 100 confocal microscope using a Zeiss Plan-Apo 63 × 1.40 NA oil immersion objective. Dose-response curves were analyzed by the iterative fitting program GraphPAD Prism (GraphPAD Software). Log concentration-effect curves were fitted to logistic expressions for single-site analysis. t 12 values for agonist-induced desensitization were obtained by fitting data to a single exponential curve. Where appropriate, statistical significance was assessed by Student's t test or by two-way ANOVA using GraphPAD Prism. Previously, we used stable expression of arrestin antisense constructs to successfully reduce endogenous arrestin levels in HEK293 cells (16.Mundell S.J. Loudon R.B. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8723-8732Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These cells revealed an important role for arrestins in the desensitization of endogenous Gs-coupled receptors such as the β2-adrenergic, adenosine A2b, and prostaglandin E2 (16.Mundell S.J. Loudon R.B. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8723-8732Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Three of these previously characterized cell lines with demonstrated reductions in arrestin-2 and/or arrestin-3 were used in the present study. The line AS 37, stably transfected with an arrestin-2 antisense construct, exhibits an ∼50% reduction in arrestin-2 levels, whereas the lines AS 83, transfected with an arrestin-3 antisense construct, and AS 108, transfected with both antisense constructs, exhibit an ∼50% decrease in arrestin-2 and ∼75% decrease in arrestin-3 levels. Endogenous arrestin levels in vector-transfected cells were comparable with those in wild type HEK293 cells. To further define the arrestin specificity in regulating GPCRs, we next focused on endogenous Gq-coupled receptors. HEK293 cells have been reported to contain a number of Gq-coupled receptors including muscarinic (18.Conklin B.R. Chabre O. Wong Y.H. Federman A.D. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 31-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thrombin, lysophosphatidic acid, sphingolipid (23.Anderson L. Alexander C.L. Faccenda E. Eidne K.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), endothelin, bradykinin (24.Barak L.S. Warabi K. Feng X. Caron M.G. Kwatra M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7565-7569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and P2y1and P2y2 purinergic (17.Schachter J.B. Sromek S.M. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The addition of carbachol (M1Ach), ADP (P2y1), and ATP (P2y2) to HEK293 cells resulted in significant stimulation of inositol phosphate accumulation (Fig. 1). In contrast, incubation with bombesin, bradykinin, thrombin, serotonin, lysophosphatidic acid, or endothelin resulted in <2-fold increases in inositol phosphate production compared with basal (data not shown). Thus, we focused our studies on the Gq-coupled M1Ach, P2y1 and P2y2 purinergic receptors. GPCR-mediated phospholipase C activation was assessed in intact cells by measuring [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation following the addition of agonist. M1AchR-stimulated inositol accumulation by the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol (1 mm) was ∼70% greater 30 min after agonist addition to antisense versus control cells (2.1 ± 0.3, 2.8 ± 0.2- and 2.9 ± 0.4-fold basal for wild type, AS 37, and AS 108 cells, respectively) (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, stimulation of P2y1 receptors with ADP (100 μm) or P2y2 receptors with ATP (100 μm) produced equivalent increases in inositol phosphate production among the various cell lines tested (Fig. 1, B and C). Similarly, incubation with 2-methyl-ADP (100 μm) or UTP (100 μm), selective agonists for the P2y1 and P2y2 purinergic receptors, respectively, also produced equivalent increases in inositol phosphate production in the various lines (Fig. 1 D). These studies demonstrate that the agonist-specific desensitization of the M1AchR was significantly attenuated in cells with reduced arrestin levels, whereas the desensitization of the P2y1 and P2y2purinergic receptors was unaffected. To confirm that each of these receptors was coupled to phospholipase C via Gq, as previously reported (17.Schachter J.B. Sromek S.M. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 18.Conklin B.R. Chabre O. Wong Y.H. Federman A.D. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 31-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cells were incubated with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml, 12 h). Pertussis toxin pretreatment had no effect on inositol phosphate production by any of the endogenous receptors under investigation, confirming that each of these responses was via Gq activation (data not shown). To further investigate arrestin/receptor specificity, we characterized Ca2+ mobilization induced by activation of each of these Gq-coupled GPCRs. In agreement with previous studies we found that ADP, ATP, and carbachol all triggered a rapid and transient intracellular mobilization of Ca2+ (17.Schachter J.B. Sromek S.M. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 18.Conklin B.R. Chabre O. Wong Y.H. Federman A.D. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 31-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Complete concentration-effect curves were subsequently generated for the M1Ach, P2y1, and P2y2 purinergic receptors in antisense and vector transfected control cells (Fig.2). The magnitude of the calcium response and agonist potency was unchanged in antisense-expressing cells compared with vector-transfected controls. In addition, the duration of the transient Ca2+ responses was similar in antisense and control cell lines for each of the agonists tested (data not shown). These findings appear to contrast with our M1AchR-mediated inositol phosphate analysis, where increased inositol phosphate accumulation was observed in the antisense lines (Fig. 1). However, these differences are likely due to the transient nature of the Ca2+ responses (measured ∼30 s after agonist addition)versus the longer incubations used for inositol phosphate accumulation (>10 min). Our studies next focused on the desensitization of P2y2 and M1AchR-mediated calcium responses in vector-transfected cells. The concentration dependence of agonist-mediated desensitization was examined by pretreating cells with ATP (0.01 nm–100 μm) or carbachol (0.1 nm–1 mm) for 30 min before subsequent determination of intracellular calcium mobilization by a maximally activating concentration of each of these agonists (Fig. 3, A andB). Carbachol pretreatment produced a homologous, concentration-dependent desensitization of the subsequent carbachol response, whereas the response to ATP remained largely unaffected. In contrast, ATP pretreatment led to homologous desensitization of the P2y2 receptor but also resulted in heterologous desensitization of the M1AchR. Note that the duration of the transient Ca2+ response was unaffected by agonist pretreatment, with only the magnitude of response affected. To investigate the involvement of arrestins in the desensitization of these responses, antisense and control cells were pretreated with a fixed concentration of agonist for 30 min, and then intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was measured in response to ATP or carbachol. As previously shown, carbachol pretreatment caused homologous desensitization of the M1AchR, whereas the response to ATP was not altered in wild type cells (Fig.4 A). The extent of M1AchR desensitization was significantly lower in the various antisense cell lines, further confirming a role for arrestins in M1AchR desensitization (Fig. 4 A). Conversely, the homologous desensitization of the P2y2 receptor by ATP was unaffected by reductions in arrestin levels, again suggesting that arrestins do not play a role in desensitization of this receptor (Fig.4 B). Interestingly, the heterologous desensitization of the M1AchR by ATP pretreatment was also unchanged in antisense cells, indicating that arrestins are involved only in the homologous desensitization of the M1AchR (Fig. 4 B). Time courses of agonist-mediated P2y1, P2y2, and M1AchR desensitization were next constructed by pretreating cells with agonist for 0 to 45 min before rechallenge with a maximally activating concentration of agonist (Fig.5). The rate and extent of M1AchR desensitization was significantly diminished in antisense cell lines (t 12 = 4.3 ± 0.6, 4.4 ± 0.9, and 6.0 ± 0.8 min for AS 37, 83, and 108, respectively, compared with 1.8 ± 0.4 for vector-transfected cells) (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, the time courses of P2y1 and P2y2 receptor desensitization were unaffected by reductions in arrestin levels (Fig. 5, B andC). Since the endogenous arrestins appeared to differentially regulate Gq-coupled receptors in HEK293 cells, we were also interested in characterizing Gi-coupled receptors in these cells. Screening for multiple Gi-coupled receptors (somatostatin, angiotensin, purinergic, α2-adrenergic, lysophosphatidic acid, and muscarinic) revealed that the AT1 angiotensin and somatostatin receptors are functionally expressed in HEK293 cells. SRIF-14 (Fig.6 A) and angiotensin II (Fig.6 B) both produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in whole cell homogenates. Both the IC50 and the magnitude of inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity by each agonist was similar in vector-transfected and antisense-expressing cells. We next constructed time courses of AT1 angiotensin and somatostatin receptor desensitization in control and antisense cells. In vector-transfected cells, pretreatment with SRIF-14 and angiotensin II resulted in rapid desensitization of receptor activity (Fig. 6,C and D). Interestingly, the SRIF-14-promoted desensitization was significantly attenuated in AS 37 and AS 108 lines (Fig. 6 C). The rate of somatostatin receptor desensitization was significantly slower in both antisense cell lines (t 12 = 4.1 ± 0.6 and 5.4 ± 0.6 min for AS 37 and 108, respectively, compared with 2.3 ± 0.4 for vector-transfected cells) (Fig. 6 C). Interestingly, although the t 12 of desensitization was slower in both antisense cell lines, both lines exhibited significant levels of receptor desensitization at later time points. Conversely, angiotensin II-promoted desensitization was no different in vector-transfected control and antisense cell lines. The AT1 angiotensin receptor can also couple to activation of Gq and phospholipase C in a number of cell lines. Unfortunately, when we measured inositol phosphate accumulation in vector-transfected and antisense cell lines in response to angiotensin II, we found a very weak response with <2-fold stimulation of inositol phosphate accumulation over basal (data not shown).

Weber S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3205-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) when 50−100 mm butyrate was present during spheroplasting and isolation of nuclei. Histone H4 contained 2.0 ± 0.3 acetylated lysines per molecule, i.e. 10% tetra- and 20% triacetylated H4 forms with less than 15% unmodified histone. High levels of acetylation were also shown in two-dimensional gels for other core histones, but these were not quantified.Over the years a method of histone purification from nuclei ofPhysarum (30.Mende L.M.

Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) has been developed that is based on the use of guanidine as a chaotropic salt that prevents protease, deacetylase, and phosphatase action. Histones are obtained quantitatively and at reasonable to high purity. When applied to whole cells of multiple plant species (34.Waterborg J.H. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 35.Waterborg J.H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 18: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the method gives consistently high histone yield with only limited reduction in histone purity. In this publication we present its use, including a novel ultrafiltration step that increases histone purity, for the quantitative preparation of fully acetylated histones from whole yeast cells. It allowed, for the first time, the determination of the steady-state acetylation levels of all four core histones of yeast. A simple method for isolating nuclei without loss of histone acetylation is also described. Histone solubilization from such crude nuclei followed by reversed-phase HPLC yields undegraded, purified core histones of yeast.DISCUSSIONBy avoiding extensive incubation of yeast for spheroplasting and isolation of nuclei, the steady-state acetylation levels of all core histones could be determined for the first time in the yeast S. cerevisiae (Table I). Davie et al. (29.Davie J.R. Saunders C.A. Walsh J.M. Weber S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3205-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) had shown that 100 mm butyrate during spheroplasting of yeast cells could prevent histone deacetylation. However, common histone isolation procedures from yeast do not include the use of butyrate during spheroplasting and use only up to 30 mm butyrate during extensive procedures to isolate nuclei (20.Rundlett S.E.

Consequently, AU gel electrophoresis (if shown) reveals variable loss of acetylation, most easily seen in the distribution of acetylated histone H4 species (8.Kuo M.H. Zhou J.X. Jambeck P. Churchill M.E.A. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 22.Braunstein M. Sobel R.E. Allis C.D. Turner B.M. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Even proteolysis of histone H3 is seen in SDS gel patterns (19.Zhang W.Z. Bone J.R. Edmondson D.G. Turner B.M. Roth S.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3155-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 27.Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The method described here is fast and can be applied directly to flash-frozen yeast cells. Extensive histone purification is achieved when histones are extracted from nuclei produced in a single step from frozen cells using a buffer that prevents loss of histone acetylation and maximizes histone recovery.The steady-state acetylation level of whole-cell histone H4 (Table I) and its distribution across acetylated forms (Fig. 3 C) mirrors the pattern described by Davie et al. (29.Davie J.R. Saunders C.A. Walsh J.M. Weber S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3205-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) produced at 100 mm butyrate. We obtained the same result when crude nuclei were rapidly isolated from yeast in 50 mm butyrate (Table I). Our common observations enable the redesign of current methods of yeast chromatin preparation to preserve in vivolevels of histone acetylation for Western analysis of acetylation sites and levels.The effective prevention of histone deacetylation in vivounder conditions of spheroplasting (25.Nelson D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1565-1568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Davie J.R. Saunders C.A. Walsh J.M. Weber S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3205-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) is remarkable as neither butyrate nor TSA will induce histone hyperacetylation in growing yeast cells (42.Sanchez-del-Pino M.M. Lopez-Rodas G. Sendra R. Tordera V. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The latter observation was confirmed during culture of yeast cells for up to 3 h at 100 ng of TSA per ml (results not shown). This suggests that in growing yeast cells the steady-state pattern of histone acetylation (Table I) is defined by histone acetyltransferase (HAT) levels. Inhibition of HDAC activities under these conditions has no effect. The balance between HAT and HDAC activities appears delicate as histone deacetylation is readily observed during spheroplasting unless the then-dominant HDAC activity is inhibited by butyrate. This conclusion implies that in growing yeast cells all potential sites for histone acetylation, within reach of acetylating enzymes, are fully modified and are kept that way. This is in sharp contrast to animals (43.Matthews H.R. Waterborg J.H. Freedman R.B. Hawkins H.C. The Enzymology of Post-translational Modification of Proteins. 2. Academic Press, London1985: 125-285Google Scholar, 44.Hoshikawa Y. Kwon H.J. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), algae (39.Waterborg J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27602-27609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and plants (45.Waterborg, J. H. (1999) Plant Biology ‘99, Annual Meeting of the American Society of Plant Physiologists, Baltimore, July 1999 Abstract 891, American Society of Plant Physiology, Rockville, MDGoogle Scholar, 46.Belyaev N.D. Houben A. Baranczewski P. Schubert I. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1997; 106: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), where HDAC inhibitors like butyrate and TSA rapidly induce histone hyperacetylation. Apparently, repressive HDAC activities dominate activating HAT action in these organisms.This general conclusion agrees with the overall state of chromatin transcription. In most species, a limited fraction of the genome exists in a transcriptionally potentiated, competent, or transcribing state. Comparing the fraction of genome expressed with the steady-state level and distribution of histone acetylation, we have deduced that transcriptionally active or competent chromatin in plants and algae may carry 10−12 acetylated lysines per nucleosome, predominantly in histone H3 (33.Waterborg J.H. Robertson A.J. Tatar D.L. Borza C.M. Davie J.R. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 39.Waterborg J.H. J. Biol.

Similar conclusions have been reached for animal cells where histone H4 is most highly acetylated. Biophysical studies of the transition between the folded and unfolded states of chromatin fibers also indicate a transition at 10−12 acetylated lysines per nucleosome (48.Tse C. Sera T. Wolffe A.P. Hansen J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4629-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 49.Garcia-Ramirez M. Rocchini C. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17923-17928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). It has been well established that the complete genome of S. cerevisiae exists as euchromatin with the exception of chromosome telomers and a few internal sites that are repressed by interaction with SIR proteins (8.Kuo M.H. Zhou J.X. Jambeck P. Churchill M.E.A. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 50.Hecht A. Laroche T. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gasser S.M. Grunstein M. Cell. 1995; 80: 583-592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). The overall steady-state acetylation of yeast nucleosomes with approximately 13 acetylated lysines per nucleosome (Table I) fits this model rather well. The average steady-state level of histone acetylation (Table I) is the highest ever reported. However, compared with the maximal level of 34 acetylated lysines in a yeast nucleosome, based on 6 lysines that can be acetylated in H2B, 2 in H2A, 5 in H3, and 4 in H4 (Fig. 3), the average level of nucleosome acetylation in yeast is rather moderate. Combining the methodologies described here with chromatin fractionation procedures, it should be possible to determine whether individual yeast nucleosomes have acetylation levels within a narrow range around 10−12 or vary between the extremes of 0 and 34 acetylated lysines per nucleosome. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a unicellular eukaryotic model system used in many studies that aim to define in molecular detail the components of chromatin and the regulatory machinery of gene transcription (1.Strahl B.D.

The highest levels of histone acetylation have been reported by Davieet al. (29.Davie J.R. Saunders C.A. Walsh J.M. Weber S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3205-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) when 50−100 mm butyrate was present during spheroplasting and isolation of nuclei. Histone H4 contained 2.0 ± 0.3 acetylated lysines per molecule, i.e. 10% tetra- and 20% triacetylated H4 forms with less than 15% unmodified histone. High levels of acetylation were also shown in two-dimensional gels for other core histones, but these were not quantified. Over the years a method of histone purification from nuclei ofPhysarum (30.Mende L.M. Waterborg J.H. Müller R.D. Matthews H.R.

Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 237-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), andChlamydomonas (33.Waterborg J.H. Robertson A.J. Tatar D.L. Borza C.M. Davie J.R. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) has been developed that is based on the use of guanidine as a chaotropic salt that prevents protease, deacetylase, and phosphatase action. Histones are obtained quantitatively and at reasonable to high purity. When applied to whole cells of multiple plant species (34.Waterborg J.H. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 35.Waterborg J.H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 18: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the method gives consistently high histone yield with only limited reduction in histone purity. In this publication we present its use, including a novel ultrafiltration step that increases histone purity, for the quantitative preparation of fully acetylated histones from whole yeast cells. It allowed, for the first time, the determination of the steady-state acetylation levels of all four core histones of yeast. A simple method for isolating nuclei without loss of histone acetylation is also described. Histone solubilization from such crude nuclei followed by reversed-phase HPLC yields undegraded, purified core histones of yeast. DISCUSSIONBy avoiding extensive incubation of yeast for spheroplasting and isolation of nuclei, the steady-state acetylation levels of all core histones could be determined for the first time in the yeast S. cerevisiae (Table I). Davie et al. (29.Davie J.R. Saunders C.A. Walsh J.M. Weber S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3205-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) had shown that 100 mm butyrate during spheroplasting of yeast cells could prevent histone deacetylation. However, common histone isolation procedures from yeast do not include the use of butyrate during spheroplasting and use only up to 30 mm butyrate during extensive procedures to isolate nuclei (20.Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Kobayashi R. Bavykin S. Turner B.M. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14503-14508Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 25.Nelson D.A. J. Biol.

Consequently, AU gel electrophoresis (if shown) reveals variable loss of acetylation, most easily seen in the distribution of acetylated histone H4 species (8.Kuo M.H. Zhou J.X. Jambeck P. Churchill M.E.A. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 22.Braunstein M. Sobel R.E. Allis C.D. Turner B.M. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Even proteolysis of histone H3 is seen in SDS gel patterns (19.Zhang W.Z. Bone J.R. Edmondson D.G. Turner B.M. Roth S.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3155-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 27.Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The method described here is fast and can be applied directly to flash-frozen yeast cells. Extensive histone purification is achieved when histones are extracted from nuclei produced in a single step from frozen cells using a buffer that prevents loss of histone acetylation and maximizes histone recovery.The steady-state acetylation level of whole-cell histone H4 (Table I) and its distribution across acetylated forms (Fig. 3 C) mirrors the pattern described by Davie et al. (29.Davie J.R. Saunders C.A. Walsh J.M. Weber S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3205-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) produced at 100 mm butyrate. We obtained the same result when crude nuclei were rapidly isolated from yeast in 50 mm butyrate (Table I). Our common observations enable the redesign of current methods of yeast chromatin preparation to preserve in vivolevels of histone acetylation for Western analysis of acetylation sites and levels.The effective prevention of histone deacetylation in vivounder conditions of spheroplasting (25.Nelson D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1565-1568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Davie J.R. Saunders C.A. Walsh J.M. Weber S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3205-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) is remarkable as neither butyrate nor TSA will induce histone hyperacetylation in growing yeast cells (42.Sanchez-del-Pino M.M. Lopez-Rodas G. Sendra R. Tordera V. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The latter observation was confirmed during culture of yeast cells for up to 3 h at 100 ng of TSA per ml (results not shown). This suggests that in growing yeast cells the steady-state pattern of histone acetylation (Table I) is defined by histone acetyltransferase (HAT) levels. Inhibition of HDAC activities under these conditions has no effect. The balance between HAT and HDAC activities appears delicate as histone deacetylation is readily observed during spheroplasting unless the then-dominant HDAC activity is inhibited by butyrate. This conclusion implies that in growing yeast cells all potential sites for histone acetylation, within reach of acetylating enzymes, are fully modified and are kept that way. This is in sharp contrast to animals (43.Matthews H.R. Waterborg J.H. Freedman R.B. Hawkins H.C. The Enzymology of Post-translational Modification of Proteins. 2. Academic Press, London1985: 125-285Google Scholar, 44.Hoshikawa Y. Kwon H.J. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Exp.

Chromosoma (Berl.). 1997; 106: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), where HDAC inhibitors like butyrate and TSA rapidly induce histone hyperacetylation. Apparently, repressive HDAC activities dominate activating HAT action in these organisms.This general conclusion agrees with the overall state of chromatin transcription. In most species, a limited fraction of the genome exists in a transcriptionally potentiated, competent, or transcribing state. Comparing the fraction of genome expressed with the steady-state level and distribution of histone acetylation, we have deduced that transcriptionally active or competent chromatin in plants and algae may carry 10−12 acetylated lysines per nucleosome, predominantly in histone H3 (33.Waterborg J.H. Robertson A.J. Tatar D.L. Borza C.M. Davie J.R. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 39.Waterborg J.H. J. Biol.

Similar conclusions have been reached for animal cells where histone H4 is most highly acetylated. Biophysical studies of the transition between the folded and unfolded states of chromatin fibers also indicate a transition at 10−12 acetylated lysines per nucleosome (48.Tse C. Sera T. Wolffe A.P. Hansen J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4629-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 49.Garcia-Ramirez M. Rocchini C. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17923-17928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). It has been well established that the complete genome of S. cerevisiae exists as euchromatin with the exception of chromosome telomers and a few internal sites that are repressed by interaction with SIR proteins (8.Kuo M.H.

Cell. 1995; 80: 583-592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). The overall steady-state acetylation of yeast nucleosomes with approximately 13 acetylated lysines per nucleosome (Table I) fits this model rather well. The average steady-state level of histone acetylation (Table I) is the highest ever reported. However, compared with the maximal level of 34 acetylated lysines in a yeast nucleosome, based on 6 lysines that can be acetylated in H2B, 2 in H2A, 5 in H3, and 4 in H4 (Fig. 3), the average level of nucleosome acetylation in yeast is rather moderate. Combining the methodologies described here with chromatin fractionation procedures, it should be possible to determine whether individual yeast nucleosomes have acetylation levels within a narrow range around 10−12 or vary between the extremes of 0 and 34 acetylated lysines per nucleosome. By avoiding extensive incubation of yeast for spheroplasting and isolation of nuclei, the steady-state acetylation levels of all core histones could be determined for the first time in the yeast S. cerevisiae (Table I).

https://openalex.org/W2059349192,"S-Nitrosylation of protein thiols is one of the cellular regulatory mechanisms induced by NO. The cysteine protease papain has a critical thiol residue (Cys25). It has been demonstrated that NO or NO donors such as sodium nitroprusside and N-nitrosoaniline derivatives can reversibly inhibit this enzyme by S–NO bond formation in its active site. In this study, a different regulated mechanism of inactivation was reported using S-nitrosothiols as the NO donor. FiveS-nitroso compounds,S-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine,S-nitrosoglutathione, S-nitrosocaptopril, glucose-S-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine-2, and the S-nitroso tripeptide acetyl-Phe-Gly-S-nitrosopenicillamine, exhibited different inhibitory activities toward the enzyme in a time- and concentration-dependent manner with second-order rate constants (k i/K I) ranging from 8.9 to 17.2 m−1s−1. The inhibition of papain byS-nitrosothiol was rapidly reversed by dithiothreitol, but not by ascorbate, which could reverse the inhibition of papain by NOBF4. Incubation of the enzyme with a fluorescentS-nitroso probe (S-nitroso-5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl) resulted in the appearance of fluorescence of the protein, indicating the formation of a thiol adduct. Moreover, S-transnitrosylation in the incubation of S-nitroso inactivators with papain was excluded. These results suggest that inactivation of papain byS-nitrosothiols is due to a direct attack of the highly reactive thiolate (Cys25) in the enzyme active site on the sulfur of S-nitrosothiols to form a mixed disulfide between the inactivator and papain.

FiveS-nitroso compounds,S-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine,S-nitrosoglutathione, S-nitrosocaptopril, glucose-S-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine-2, and the S-nitroso tripeptide acetyl-Phe-Gly-S-nitrosopenicillamine, exhibited different inhibitory activities toward the enzyme in a time- and concentration-dependent manner with second-order rate constants (k i/K I) ranging from 8.9 to 17.2 m−1s−1. The inhibition of papain byS-nitrosothiol was rapidly reversed by dithiothreitol, but not by ascorbate, which could reverse the inhibition of papain by NOBF4. Incubation of the enzyme with a fluorescentS-nitroso probe (S-nitroso-5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl) resulted in the appearance of fluorescence of the protein, indicating the formation of a thiol adduct. Moreover, S-transnitrosylation in the incubation of S-nitroso inactivators with papain was excluded. These results suggest that inactivation of papain byS-nitrosothiols is due to a direct attack of the highly reactive thiolate (Cys25) in the enzyme active site on the sulfur of S-nitrosothiols to form a mixed disulfide between the inactivator and papain. S-nitrosoglutathione S-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl dithiothreitol 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) NO is a newly discovered biological messenger that plays important roles in physiological and pathophysiological conditions such as septic shock, inflammation, and endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation (1.Ignarro L. Murad F. Nitric Oxide: Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Therapeutic Implications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1995Google Scholar, 2.Lancaster J. Nitric Oxide: Principles and Actions. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar). Many effects of NO are based on its reaction with other important species. NO reacts with superoxide to make peroxynitrite (3.Pryor W.A. Squadrito G.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L699-L722PubMed Google Scholar). It also forms metal-nitrosyl complexes in the reaction of transition metals (4.Richter-Addo G.B. Acc. Chem. Res. 1999; 32: 529-536Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The interactions of NO with sulfhydryl-containing molecules and enzymes have gained considerable importance (5.Broillet M.-C. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 6.Gaston B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In many biological systems,S-nitrosylation reactions, transferring NO from a NO donor to a protein sulfhydryl group, affect protein function. Targets for this type of modification, among others, are serum albumin (7.Stamler J.S. Simon D.I. Osborn J.A. Mullins M.E. Jaraki O. Michel T. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mulsch A. Dimmeler S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6823-6826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and cathepsin K (14.Percival M.D. Ouellet M. Campagnolo C. Claveau D. Li C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13574-13583Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) have also been demonstrated to be inhibited by NO donors. Cysteine proteases (EC 3.4.22.1–18) compose a large class of enzymes from plant, animal, and bacterial sources. They play important roles in various biological processes (for review, see Refs. 15.Lowe G. Tetrahedron. 1976; 32: 291-302Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar and 61.Rawlings N.J. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 461-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Since many disease states such as muscular dystrophy, inflammation, and rheumatoid arthritis are associated with elevated proteolytic activity of cysteine proteases, much attention has been paid to the rational design and synthesis of selective inhibitors of these types of enzymes (16.Fischer, G. (1988) Nat. Prod. Rep. 465–495Google Scholar, 17.Otto H. Schirmeister T. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 133-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 18.Babine R.E. Bender S.L. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 1359-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). The active sites of cysteine proteases contain an essential cysteine sulfhydryl and histidine imidazole unit (19.Keillor J.W. Brown R.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 7983-7989Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The active thiol is highly sensitive to oxidation, which changes the enzyme's properties and sensitivity to inhibitors and activators. It has been suggested that enzyme oxidation occurs in vivo and may represent an important mode of post-translational regulation of enzyme activity (20.Hampton M.B. Fadeel B. Orrenius S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 854: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Papain, the most studied plant cysteine protease, shares many features with physiologically important mammalian cysteine proteases such as cathepsins B, H, L, and S and the calpains. The x-ray structure for human cathepsin B and earlier comparisons of the crystal structure of papain with models of cathepsins B and H demonstrated that the mammalian enzymes show nearly identical folding patterns to papain, especially around the active site (21.Meara J.P. Rich D.H. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3357-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the active site of papain, Cys25 and His159 are thought to be catalytically active as a thiolate-imidazolium ion pair. This enzyme should be susceptible to NO donors in a manner similar to other cysteine-containing enzymes. In fact, our previous reports (22.Guo Z. Ramirez J. Li J. Wang P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 3726-3734Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23.Guo Z. McGill A., Yu, L. Li J. Ramirez J. Wang P.G. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1996; 6: 573-578Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) have shown that papain can be efficiently inhibited by peptidyl or non-peptidyl N-nitrosoanilines (a novel class of stable NO donors). We demonstrated that the inactivation is due to the formation of a stable S–NO bond in the active site of papain (S-nitroso-Cys25). Other authors, using (E)-ethyl-2-((E)-hydroxyimino)-5-nitro-3-hexenamide and sodium nitroprusside as NO donors to inactivate papain, obtained the same results (24.Venturini G. Fioravanti E. Colasanti M. Persichini T. Ascenzi P. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 46: 425-428PubMed Google Scholar). S-Nitrosothiols are other important widely used NO donors. These compounds such as GSNO1 may be the most relevant biological molecules to carry out nitrosation reactions under physiological conditions (25.Arnelle D.R. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 26.Padgett C.M. Whorton A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C739-C749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some authors have even suggested that the actions of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor more closely resemble a low molecular weight nitrosothiol rather than the NO radical itself (27.Myers P.R. Minor Jr., R.L. Guerra Jr., R. Bates J.N. Harrison D.G. Nature. 1990; 345: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the influence ofS-nitrosothiols on papain. Our results show thatS-nitrosothiols are efficient papain inhibitors and work through the formation of mixed disulfide species in the active-site cysteine (Cys25) of the enzyme. This mechanism is different from previous reports using other NO donors, including (E)-ethyl-2-((E)-hydroxyimino)-5-nitro-3-hexenamide, sodium nitroprusside, and N-nitroso compounds (22.Guo Z. Ramirez J. Li J. Wang P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 3726-3734Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23.Guo Z. McGill A., Yu, L. Li J. Ramirez J. Wang P.G. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1996; 6: 573-578Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 24.Venturini G. Fioravanti E. Colasanti M. Persichini T. Ascenzi P. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 46: 425-428PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the possibility of another cysteine modification besidesS-nitrosylation should be considered when the effects of S-nitrosothiols on critical thiol-containing proteins are investigated. Enzyme, amino acids, amino acid derivatives, and all other chemicals, solvents, and reagents were obtained from commercial sources (Sigma, Aldrich, and Fluka). They were of the highest purity available and used without further purification unless otherwise noted.1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian VRX 400S NMR apparatus. Silica Gel F254 plates (Merck) and Silica Gel 60 (70–230 mesh; Merck) were used in analytical TLC and column chromatography, respectively. SNAP (1), GSNO (2), andS-nitrosocaptopril (3) were prepared by the methods of Field et al. (28.Field, L., Dilts, R. V., Ravichandran, R., Lenhert, P. G., and Carnahan, G. (1978 ) J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 249–250Google Scholar), Hart (29.Hart, T. W. (1985) Tetrahedron Lett. 2013–2015Google Scholar), and Loscalzoet al. (30.Loscalzo J. Smick D. Andon N. Cooke J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 249: 726-729PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Glucose-SNAP-2 (4) was synthesized according to our previous method (31.Ramirez J., Yu, L. Li J. Braunschweiger P.G. Wang P.G. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1996; 6: 2575-2580Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Acetyl-Phe-Gly-OH (0.4 mmol) was reacted with 2-N-acetyl-3-S-triphenylmethyl-3-methylbutanoic acid methyl ester (1 eq) in 10 ml of dimethylformamide at 50 °C overnight with 1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (1.5 eq), triethylamine (3 eq), and hydroxybenzotriazole (3 eq) as coupling reagents. The tripeptide was obtained in 30% yield. The free sulfhydryl compound was afforded in 70% yield by deprotection of the triphenylmethyl group with trifluoroacetic acid (0.5 ml) in CH2Cl2. The target compound 5 was obtained in 85% yield by nitrosation of the free sulfhydryl group with ethyl nitrite (4–5 eq) in MeOH/H2O at −5–0 °C for 1.5 h. Compound 5: 1H NMR (CD3OD) δ 7.205–7.295 (m, 5H), 4.613 (d, 2H,J = 6.4 Hz), 3.793–3.968 (m, 2H), 3.722 (s, 3H), 3.161–3.21 (m, 1H), 2.86–2.92 (m, 1H), 1.89 (s, 3H), 1.45 (s, 3H), and 1.394 (s, 3H); 13C NMR (CD3OD) δ 173.2, 172.2, 170.3, 170.1, 137.4, 129.0, 128.3, 126.6, 83.6, 61.7, 55.2, 51.4, 42.4, 37.5, 29.2, 28.8, and 21.2. 5-N-Dansylpentanol (540 mg) was obtained in 95% yield by overnight coupling of dansyl chloride with 1.1 eq of 5-aminopentanol in 40 ml of tetrahydrofuran with triethylamine (3 eq) as a base. Then, the free hydroxyl compound (650 mg) was transferred to tosylate compound in 85% yield with tosyl chloride (1.2 eq) in 50 ml of CH2Cl2/pyridine (1:2.3). The tosylate (1 mmol, 490 mg) was substituted by thiol acetate in 30 ml of acetone quantitatively with potassium thiol acetate. Thus, the free thiol compound was obtained in 60% yield by deprotection of the acetyl group (1 mmol, 395 mg) with diisobutyl aluminum hydride (2.3 eq) in 30 ml of CH2Cl2 at −78 °C for 2.5 h. Compound 6 was obtained in 90% yield by nitrosation of the thiol compound (0.3 mmol) with NaNO2/HCl (1.3 eq) in MeOH/H2O at 0 °C for 2 h. Compound6: 1H NMR (CD3OD) δ 8.92 (d, 1H,J = 8.4 Hz), 8.64 (d, 1H, J = 9.0 Hz), 8.55 (dd, 1H, J = 7.6, 1.2 Hz), 8.16 (d, 1H,J = 7.6 Hz), 7.85–7.91 (m, 2H), 3.51 (s, 6H), 3.30–3.45 (m, 2H), 2.86 (t, 2H, J = 6.6Hz), 1.29–1.36 (m, 4H), and 1.10–1.28 (m, 2H); 13C NMR (CD3OD) δ 139.5, 137.8, 130.0, 129.5, 127.5, 127.4, 126.9, 126.1, 125.5, 119.5, 46.7, 42.4, 38.0, 28.3, 28.2, and 25.4. The solutions of S-nitrosothiols were prepared fresh each time before use. SNAP and S-nitrosodansyl were dissolved in Me2SO and then diluted in reaction buffer to achieve the desired concentration. Twice-crystallized papain was reductively activated at a concentration of 3 mg/ml by incubation with 10 mmdithiothreitol in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.2, for 1.5 h. It was then passed through a 2.3 × 26-cm Sephadex G-25 column (Amicon, Inc., Danvers, MA) equipped with a Retriever II fraction collector and an ISCO UA-5 absorbance/fluorescence detector at 4–6 °C. Fractions containing the protein were pooled and lyophilized. The protein was stored at −20 °C before use. The enzyme obtained this way excluded any unexpected effect of DTT. Papain activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 410 nm with a Hewlett-Packard 8453 UV/visible spectrophotometer using the chromogenic substrate N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Glyp-nitrophenyl ester (25 mm, 10 μl) in 1 ml of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1m NaCl, and 7% (v/v) acetonitrile. A 5 mmnitrosothiol solution (freshly prepared) was prepared in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1m NaCl. To initiate incubation, each nitrosothiol solution obtained after serial dilution was mixed with an equal volume of active papain at 25 °C. An aliquot was periodically removed from the incubation mixture and diluted into the enzyme assay solution containing the substrate. The residual enzyme activity was measured. A control preincubation solution containing all of the ingredients except for the inhibitor itself was run and assayed in parallel. These experiments were performed both in the absence and presence of Gly-Gly-Tyr-Arg. The free thiol group of the protein was titrated by 5-(octyldithio)-2-nitrobenzoate as described by Faulstich et al. (32.Faulstich H. Tews P. Heintz D. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This reagent reacts with free thiol on protein faster than Ellman's reagent due to its lipophilic hydrocarbon chain and the absence of one negative charge, which permits its access to thiol groups that normally remain undetected by Ellman's reagent. Free thiols were titrated both before and after the inactivation of the enzyme by inactivators. Titration was performed in the Hewlett-Packard 8453 UV/visible spectrophotometer by measuring the release of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate anion (ε412 = 13600m−1cm−1). The free thiol of active papain (1 mg/ml) was titrated by 5-(octyldithio)-2-nitrobenzoate (1.2 mm) in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 m NaCl. After incubation of the active enzyme (1 mg/ml) with S-nitroso inhibitor (0.5 mm) for 30 min, the protein was purified and concentrated. The free thiol of this inactive papain (1 mg/ml) was then titrated by 5-(octyldithio)-2-nitrobenzoate (1.2 mm). Protein content was determined according to the method of Lowryet al. (33.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Active papain (0.5 mg/ml, 500 μl) was incubated with 500 μl of S-nitroso compounds (1 mm) or nitrosonium tetrafluoroborate (NOBF4; 6 mm) in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1m NaCl at 25 °C for 60 min. The enzyme activity was totally abolished. The protein was then passed through a Sephadex G-25 column for purification. Fractions containing the protein were concentrated by centrifugal filtration (Centricon YM-3, Amicon, Inc.). The obtained inactive enzyme (0.5 mg/ml, 100 μl) was then incubated with 100 μl of l-ascorbic acid (20 mm) or DTT (10 mm), and the activity of papain was measured at different time intervals. Samples without inactivators served as controls. Active papain (1 mg/ml, 600 μl) was incubated with compound6 (2 mm, 600 μl) in 50 mmphosphate buffer, pH 6.2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mNaCl at 25 °C until the papain was completely inactivated (∼30 min). The protein was then passed through a Sephadex G-25 column to remove excess compound 6 and other low molecular weight reaction products. Fractions containing the protein (5 ml) were concentrated by centrifugation at 7000 rpm at 4 °C to produce a 1-ml final solution. The fluorescence of the protein solution (0.5 mg/ml) was measured using a SPEX Fluro Max spectrometer. A control experiment including all the steps except for incubating papain withN-ethylmaleimide (0.1 mm) for 30 min before adding compound 6 was run and assayed in parallel. Freshly prepared solutions of S-nitroso compounds1–5 (0.4 mm, 0.5 ml) and DTNB (0.6 mm, 0.2 ml) were mixed in a UV quartz cell. Then, 0.5 ml of active papain (0.6 mg/ml) was added to the solution, and the mixture was monitored at 412 nm for 30 min with the Hewlett-Packard 8453 UV/visible spectrophotometer. The reaction was carried out in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1m NaCl at 25 °C. The procedure is based on the low reactivity of DTNB with protein thiol compared with most simple thiols (34.Zhang H. Means G.E. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). If the reaction of papain with S-nitroso inhibitor wasS-transnitrosation, the generated simple thiol would rapidly react with DTNB to give 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate dianion. The strong visible absorbance of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate dianion (ε412 = 13600 m−1cm−1) could be easily detected. The inhibition of papain byS-nitrosothiol compounds 1-5 was first investigated. SNAP (1), GSNO (2), andS-nitrosocaptopril (4) were used in our bioassay because these three compounds are the most typical and stableS-nitrosothiols and have been widely used in the biological research on nitric oxide. Glucose-SNAP-2 (3) represents a novel class of NO donor compounds developed by our group (31.Ramirez J., Yu, L. Li J. Braunschweiger P.G. Wang P.G. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1996; 6: 2575-2580Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The sugar unit of these compounds enhances water solubility, cell penetration, and drug-receptor interaction and influences the dose-response relationships. Moreover, these compounds are more stable than SNAP in aqueous solution. Compound 5 was specifically designed and synthesized for papain because this enzyme prefers to have a peptide substrate with a bulky residue such as Phe at the S2 subsite and a small hydrophobic residue at the S1 subsite (35.Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4766) Google Scholar, 36.Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 32: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The inactivation process could therefore be facilitated by directing the nitrosothiol moiety into the active site through the binding of P1 and P2residues to S1 and S2 subsites. The molecular structures of these inactivators are shown in Fig.1. Incubation of papain with each of these S-nitrosothiols resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent loss of enzyme activity. A typical enzyme inactivation process by GSNO is shown in Fig. 2. As shown, the inactivation reactions obeyed apparent first-order kinetics. The apparent first-order inactivation constants (k obs) could be calculated by plotting the residual activity versus time and fitting a linear equation. The replots ofk obs as a function of S-nitrosothiol concentration gave a Kitz-Wilson plot (37.Kitz R. Wilson I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3245-3250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.3), indicating that the inactivation of papain by S-nitrosothiols is a bimolecular process. The calculated kinetic parameters for each inhibitor inactivation of the enzyme are shown in Table I.Figure 3Kitz-Wilson plot for the inhibition of papain by GSNO.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IKinetic parameters for the inactivation of papain by S-nitrosothiolsS-Nitroso compoundsk iK Ik i/K Imin −1mmm −1 s −110.3180.35614.920.2020.30511.130.2390.4498.940.4770.61812.950.0910.09617.2 Open table in a new tab The kinetic results presented in Table I indicated thatS-nitroso compounds were moderate inactivators of papain. The second-order rate constants (k i/K I) for inactivation of papain by these compounds ranged from 17.2 to 8.9m−1 s−1. The values were substantially lower than those exhibited by other well known papain inhibitors such as peptidyl diazomethanes. This result was partly attributable to the higher K I values of theS-nitrosothiols, whereas in the diazomethane case, the actual dissociation constant for the Michaelis-type complex was significantly lower due to the fast reversible chemical step preceding the alkylation step. The intrinsic reactivity of the nitrosothiol moiety toward the papain differed in these five compounds, of which the most potent was inhibitor 5, as we predicted. This result suggested that the Phe and Gly residues in inhibitor 5contributed significantly to the stabilization of the inactivator-enzyme complex. However, by comparing the second-order rate constants for inhibition of papain by S-nitrosothiols with those exhibited by peptidyl N-nitrosoanilines (22.Guo Z. Ramirez J. Li J. Wang P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 3726-3734Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we can conclude that the functional S–NO residue is generally a more potent inactivator than the N–NO residue. By comparing the kinetic parameters of SNAP and glucose-SNAP-2, it appeared that the introduction of a sugar fragment decreased the inhibitory potency of SNAP. The same effect was observed for protein-tyrosine phosphatase (38.Xian M. Wang K. Chen X. Hou Y. McGill A. Chen X. Zhou B. Zhang Z.-Y. Cheng J.-P. Wang P.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 310-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The next step was to identify the site implicated in the enzyme inactivation. Gly-Gly-Tyr-Arg is a competitive peptide inhibitor of papain. To determine whether the inhibitory effect of S-nitrosothiols on papain occurs due to modification at a similar or distinct site of action, we analyzed the inactivation of papain byS-nitrosothiol in the presence or absence of Gly-Gly-Tyr-Arg. The effects of Gly-Gly-Tyr-Arg alone and together with GSNO are shown in Fig. 4. A combination of GSNO and the tetrapeptide inhibited the enzyme by 42%, whereas individually, 75 and 96% inhibition was achieved, respectively. This result that the competitive inhibitor protected the enzyme from inactivation suggested that the action of S-nitrosothiols was directed to the active site of papain. Since papain has only one free sulfhydryl group (Cys25 in the active site of the enzyme), the data in Fig. 4 also suggested that inactivation of papain by S-nitroso compounds was due to the modification of Cys25 of the protein. To further verify this conclusion, free thiol groups were titrated both before and after inactivation of the enzyme with S-nitroso compounds (data not shown). We found that only <0.05 free thiol groups/enzyme molecule were titrated after incubating the enzyme (1 mg/ml) with S-nitrosothiols (0.5 mm) for 30 min, whereas 0.81 free thiol groups were titrated in the uninhibited enzyme. These results also indicated that the sulfhydryl group in the active site of papain (Cys25) was involved in the enzyme inactivation and that the modification of this sulfhydryl group by inactivators was complete. It is well known that the activities of many cysteine-containing enzymes are modulated by an NO-induced mechanism (39.Stamler J.S. Cell. 1996; 78: 931-936Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1633) Google Scholar). The present dogma for the mechanism of inactivation of critical thiol-containing enzymes by NO or NO donors is the formation of an S-nitroso adduct (40.Stamler J.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 196: 19-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 41.Kroncke K.D. Fehsel K. Kolb-Bachofen V. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 107-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). This species, which has been identified by spectroscopic and colorimetric quantitation techniques in a number of proteins, is reducible to the free thiol by DTT with the recovery of enzyme activity (42.Mohr S. Stamler J.S. Brune B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4209-4214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). This latter criterion has been used to postulate the presence of an S-nitrosothiol group in recent studies on the effects of NO donors on enzymes, sometimes in the absence of direct evidence (43.Venturini G. Colasanti M. Salvati L. Gradoni L. Ascenzi P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 190-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 44.So H.S. Park R.K. Kim M.S. Lee S.R. Jung B.H. Chung S.Y.

Commun. 1997; 240: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). If NO donors used in the inactivation of cysteine-containing enzymes were compounds that release only nitric oxide as the inactivating reagent in the incubation (such as diazeniumdiolates, sodium nitroprusside, 3-morpholinosydnonime, (E)-methyl-2-((E)-hydroxyimino)-5-nitro-6-methoxy-3-hexenamide, and N-nitrosoaniline derivatives), the modification of enzyme may be caused by the S-nitroso protein in many cases. Sometimes, the formation of protein sulfenic acid may be possible due to the oxidation of thiol groups in the protein by these inactivators (14.Percival M.D. Ouellet M. Campagnolo C. Claveau D. Li C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13574-13583Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 46.Ishii T. Sunami O. Nakajima H. Nishio H. Takeuchi T. Hata F. Biochem.

Biol. 1998; 5: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, if an S-nitrosothiol were used as a NO donor, since the reaction of S-nitrosothiol with another thiol is complex (48.Wong P.S.-Y. Hyun J. Fukuto J.M. Shirota F.N. DeMaster E.G. Shoeman D.W. Nagasawa H.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5362-5371Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 49.Singh S.P. Wishnok J.S. Keshive M. Deen W.M. Tannenbaum S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Both modifications would lead to the inactivation of cysteine-containing enzymes that could be reversed with DTT (SchemeFS1). Thus, the reactivation of the enzyme by DTT should not be taken alone as evidence for the formation of an S–NO bond. Recently, it was reported that ascorbate can promote NO release fromS-nitrosoalbumin and GSNO in blood plasma (50.Scorza G. Pietraforte D. Minetti M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In another study using plasma and fractions of liver and kidney extracts, it was also claimed that ascorbate promoted the decomposition of GSNO (51.Kashiba-Iwatsuki M. Kitoh K. Kasahara H., Yu, M.

Reaction of wild-type recombinant human Mb, the C110A variant of human Mb, or horse heart Mb with H2O2(protein/H2O2 = 1:1.2 mol/mol) resulted in formation of tryptophan peroxyl (Trp-OO⋅) and tyrosine phenoxyl radicals as detected by EPR spectroscopy at 77 K.

One particularly well studied example of radical translocation is provided by the protein-centered radical formed by myoglobin upon reaction with hydrogen peroxide. Myoglobin (Mb)1 has a limited ability to reduce H2O2 to water with the concomitant formation of ferryl (Fe(IV)=O) heme. At protein/H2O2 ratios ≤1:5 mol/mol, reaction of metmyoglobin with H2O2 yields both ferryl (Fe(IV)=O) Mb and protein radicals (globin⋅). Although the ferryl Mb is stable for hours at room temperature (15.George P. Irvine D.H. Biochem. J. 1952; 52: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), the identity of the Mb residue(s) that form radicals in the presence of H2O2 has been the subject of some controversy. Globin⋅ radicals have been localized to tyrosine (16.Tew D. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17880-17886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Davies M.J. Biochim.

Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Mason R.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1293-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Additionally, globin⋅ radicals may undergo subsequent chemistry (18.Gunther M.R. Tschirret-Guth R.A. Witkowska H.E. Fann Y.C. Barr D.P. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Mason R.P. Biochem.

Chem. 1994; 269: 7458-7463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hydroxyl radicals, however, do not appear to be involved in the transfer of oxidative damage (20.Davies M.J. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1990; 10: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar,21.Turner J.J. Rice-Evans C.A. Davies M.J. Newman E.S. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Human Mb is similar in sequence to other mammalian myoglobins. One significant difference, however, is the presence of Cys110. No other species of known mammalian Mb possesses a cysteine residue (22.Hubbard S.R. Hendrickson W.A. Lambright D.G. Boxer S.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As Mb is released under some pathological situations such as ischemia/reperfusion of the heart (23.Galaris D. Eddy L. Arduini A. Cadenas E. Hochstein P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 160: 1162-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and H2O2is produced continuously in vivo (24.Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (4764) Google Scholar), the reaction of human Mb and H2O2 may afford a physiologically relevant oxidant. Although the reactions of horse heart Mb and sperm whale Mb with H2O2 have been studied extensively, the corresponding reaction of human Mb has not been investigated previously. In this work, we have studied the reaction of human Mb and its C110A variant to evaluate the possible role of the reactive thiol group in the reaction of this protein with hydrogen peroxide through the combined use of EPR spectroscopy and electrospray mass spectrometry. Horse heart Mb, reduced glutathione, iodoacetamide, bovine serum albumin (BSA), trypsin (type III; 10,200 unit/mg of protein), bovine liver catalase (40,000 unit/mg of protein), urea, ascorbate, EDTA, TEMPO, DTPA, 2,2-dithiodipyridine (DTP), 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) were obtained from Sigma. DMPO was purified by stirring solutions (1 m in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) with activated charcoal (100 mg/ml) in the dark. After 30 min, the solution was filtered, and portions were stored at −80 °C prior to use (25.Kotake Y. Reineke L.A. Tanigawa T. Koshida H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 17: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Tryptone and yeast extract were from Becton Dickinson (Sparks, MD). Dithiothreitol (DTT) and NaCl were obtained from Fisher. H2O2was from Bio-Rad. Buffers were prepared from either glass-distilled water or glass-distilled water purified further by passage through a Barnstead Nanopure system. All buffers were stored over Chelex 100® (Bio-Rad) at 4 °C for at least 24 h to remove contaminating transition metals as verified by ascorbate autoxidation analysis (26.Buettner G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Organic solvents and all other chemicals employed were of the highest quality available. Transformed bacteria (strain AR68) containing plasmids for both wild-type recombinant human myoglobin and the C110A variant (27.Ragavan V. Szabo A. Boxer S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5681-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) were obtained from Prof. Steven G. Boxer. The cells were grown at 28 °C in 10 × 2-liter flasks containing 2YT Superbroth (1 liter/flask: Tryptone (16 g/liter), yeast extract (10 g/liter), and NaCl (5 g/liter)) toA 600 nm = 1.2. The expression of recombinant myoglobins was induced by immersing each flask in a water bath (55 °C) for 5 min and then transferring the flask to an incubator operating at 42 °C. Cultures were incubated for a further 6–7 h, and the cells were harvested. Myoglobin (isolated as a fusion product) was purified by anion-exchange chromatography (Whatman DE52 resin) as described (27.Ragavan V. Szabo A. Boxer S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5681-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Rapidly increasing the culture temperature in this manner was essential as simply increasing incubation temperature from 28 to 42 °C failed to induce protein expression. The partially purified fusion protein was reconstituted with excess hemin (heme/protein ∼ 1:1.5; Porphyrin Products, Logan, UT), treated with trypsin (to cleave the fusion segment) and then further purified as described (27.Ragavan V. Szabo A. Boxer S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5681-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, recombinant myoglobin was isolated as metmyoglobin. When required, proteins were concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration (Centriprep-10 concentrators, Millipore Corp.). X-band EPR spectra (293 or 77 K) were obtained with a Bruker ESP 300e spectrometer equipped with a Hewlett-Packard microwave frequency counter. Mb solutions (∼1 mm in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) were treated with H2O2 at molar ratios of 1:1.2–5 in both the presence and absence of DMPO (protein/DMPO = 1:5–100 mol/mol). For low temperature studies, a sample of the reaction mixture (250 μl) was placed into a standard 3-mm quartz cell (Wilmad, Buena, NJ), snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and transferred to a finger Dewar insert (77 K) for EPR analyses. Analyses of DMPO spin-trapped adducts were performed with samples (50 μl) of the reaction mixture transferred into capillary tubes with a glass pipette. The capillary was then placed into a quartz EPR tube, and the tube was transferred to the cavity for EPR analyses at 293 K. The limit of detection of a stable nitroxide (TEMPO) under identical conditions was determined to be ∼50 nm. Unless indicated otherwise, the time between removal of the sample, transfer to the appropriate cell, and tuning the spectrometer was consistently <30 s. EPR spectra were obtained as an average of three to five scans with a modulation frequency of 100 kHz and a sweep time of 84 s. Microwave power, modulation amplitude, and scan range used for each analysis varied appropriately as indicated in the figure legends. Hyperfine couplings were obtained by spectral simulation using the simplex algorithm (28.Duling D.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1994; 104B: 105-110Crossref Scopus (885) Google Scholar) provided in the WINSIM program (NIEHS, National Institutes of Health). All hyperfine couplings are expressed in units of milliteslas. Simulations were considered acceptable if they produced correlation factors of R > 0.85. Peak area was estimated by integration using standard WINEPR software. Where possible, peak areas were standardized against a freshly prepared solution of TEMPO (5 μm in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) measured under identical spectrometer conditions; concentrations are expressed as moles of spins/mol of Mb protein. DTPA (100 μm) was included in all Mb solutions prior to addition of H2O2 to minimize the possibility of free transition metal-mediated decomposition of peroxide by Fenton chemistry. For the analyses of power saturation data, a plot of log(I/P 0.5) versus logP, where I represents intensity and Prepresents the microwave power, was chosen, as this results in a line that is parallel to the abscissa so long as the signal is not saturated and that slopes downward with increasing saturation. The saturation data (29.Rajagopalan K.V. Handler P. Palmer G. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3784-3796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Rupp H. Rao K.K. Hall D.O. Cammack R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 537: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) were fitted to the relationship I ∝ (P 0.5)/(1 +P/P 12)0.5 b, whereb ranges from 1 (for an inhomogeneous case) to 2 (for a homogeneous case). The curve of the fitted line tends to a slope of 0.5b under conditions of power saturation, andP 12 is the half-saturation power obtained from the intersection of the two straight line segments of the line of best fit. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI/MS) was performed with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer described in detail elsewhere (31.Hunter C.L. Mauk A.G. Douglas D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1018-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Samples of myoglobin/H2O2 reaction mixtures were diluted to a final concentration of 10 μm in heme (using methanol/water (1:10, v/v)) and were infused continuously (flow rate of 1 μl/min) into the ion source at 20 °C. Experiments were performed without an internal standard. Multiply charged gas-phase proteins were generated by pneumatically assisted ESI. Depending on the voltage difference between the ion sampling orifice and skimmer, the heme-protein interactions can be disrupted, and free heme can be completely dissociated from the heme-protein complex (31.Hunter C.L. Mauk A.G. Douglas D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1018-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For this study, the voltage difference between the orifice and skimmer was set at +100–110 V, such that dissociation of heme from the heme-protein complex could occur, and mass peaks were obtained largely for the apoprotein (apoMb) form of the protein. This dissociation of heme from the native protein was necessary to reduce the complexity of species analyzed where a homodimer was obtained (see below), although some contamination from intact protein (or holoprotein) was detected. Estimates of mass for holoMb, however, were performed with a voltage difference of 50–60 V to preserve the heme-protein complex and to afford charge-state distributions largely for the holoMb form of the protein. The ESI/MS system was calibrated with solutions of CsI, and horse heart Mb (mass of the apoprotein predicted from the amino acid sequence of 16,950 atomic mass units) was employed as a standard to test the mass accuracy of the system prior to use. Mass values were obtained by standard fitting analyses of the variousm/z distributions using BioMultiView software (Perkin-Elmer Sciex Instruments, Foster City, CA). Mass determinations were performed for two or more independent protein preparations on different days. Mass values reported here refer to the means ± S.D. from five or more analyses. Electronic absorption spectra were obtained with a Cary 3E UV/visible spectrophotometer. Mb concentrations were determined for solutions prepared in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, assuming ε408 nm ∼ 188,000m−1 cm−1. Reactive thiol content was determined by incubating protein samples (1–5 μm in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) with either DTP or DTNB (1:10 molar ratio of protein to reagent). Absorbance was then measured at 325 or 446 nm, respectively (32.Garel M.C. Beuzard Y. Thillet J. Domenget C. Martin J. Galacteros F. Rosa J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 33.Lynch S.M. Frei B. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1745-1753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and concentrations of free thiol were estimated by comparison with GSH standards. For hemeproteins, the absorbance of the DTNB adduct (421 nm) is nearly coincident with the heme absorption at 408 nm. To avoid this interference, TNB− anion formation was measured at 446 nm and used to estimate protein thiol content (34.Kelman D.J. Mason R.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In some experiments, wild-type human Mb was incubated with iodoacetamide (protein/thiol-blocking reagent = 1:10 mol/mol) prior to addition of DTP or DTNB. The stability of mixed disulfides (i.e. from the reaction of reduced GSH with DTNB or DTP) to reduction by ascorbate was evaluated at 25 °C at variable concentrations (0.1–1 molar eq) of ascorbate by monitoring the spectrum between 250 and 500 nm following addition of ascorbate. Cross-linking experiments were performed by incubating solutions of either wild-type human Mb or the C110A variant (65 μm in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) with H2O2 (325 μm final concentration) and DTPA (100 μm) at 37 °C. Samples of the reaction mixture were removed periodically and diluted immediately with the same buffer with or without added DTT. In some cases, wild-type human Mb was incubated with iodoacetamide prior to addition of H2O2. Samples were then heated at 100 °C for 5 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (35.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) after staining with Coomassie Blue. Statistics were performed with Student's t test available in Microsoft Excel, and significant difference was accepted at p < 0.05. The reactive thiol content of wild-type human Mb and the C110A variant and that of horse heart Mb and BSA are shown in TableI. BSA was found to possess a single reactive thiol that was accessible to both DTP and DTNB, consistent with previous reports (36.Gatti R.M. Radi R. Ohara A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 37.Silvester J.A. Timmins G.S. Davies M.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 754-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As expected from their amino acid sequences, wild-type human Mb also exhibited a single reactive thiol, whereas horse heart Mb and the C110A variant of the human protein contained no free thiol irrespective of treatment (Table I). Treatment of wild-type human Mb with iodoacetamide prior to free thiol determination decreased the thiol content of this protein significantly as expected following carboxymethylation of Cys110, indicating that the thiol had been effectively blocked by this treatment.Table IFree thiol content of human myoglobins and bovine serum albuminProteinReagentFree thiol contentmol/molWild-type human MbDTP1.11 ± 0.01DTNB0.94 ± 0.03Human Mb C110A variantDTP0.02 ± 0.01DTNB0.00 ± 0.03Horse heart MbDTP0.07 ± 0.00DTNB0.01 ± 0.20BSADTP1.07 ± 0.02DTNB0.96 ± 0.10Thiol-blocked wild-type human Mb aThiol-blocked wild-type human Mb was prepared by modification with iodoacetamide immediately before thiol determination (see “Experimental Procedures”).DTP0.22 ± 0.03 bValues are significantly different from corresponding values obtained for unmodified wild-type human Mb (p < 0.05).DTNB0.04 ± 0.04 bValues are significantly different from corresponding values obtained for unmodified wild-type human Mb (p < 0.05).Data represent the means ± S.D. of at least three separate determinations.

EPR spectra (77 K) for various mammalian myoglobins reacted with H2O2 at a protein/H2O2 molar ratio of 1:1.2 and frozen and recorded immediately after mixing are shown in Fig.1. For horse heart Mb, the C110A variant of human Mb, and the wild-type human protein, weak EPR signals were detected at g ∼ 2.036, 2.013, and 2.006, indicating that the initial globin⋅ formed under these reaction conditions was the same for each protein. Upon incubation of the reaction mixture for wild-type human Mb at 77 K, the signal at g ∼ 2.036 decayed to the base line within 5 min. Subsequently, a second signal appeared at an identical g-value. This latter species was stable at 77 K for at least 15 min (Fig. 2). During this time, the signal at g ∼ 2.011 both increased in intensity and broadened in appearance, such that the features noted earlier were no longer distinguishable. The decay of the g ∼ 2.036 signal and the subsequent broadening of the g ∼ 2.011 signal were also observed for horse heart Mb and the human C110A variant; however, the signal at g ∼ 2.036 did not reappear in either case, even after 30 min of incubation at 77 K (data not shown). The latter observation is consistent with that described for the decay of Trp-OO⋅ in horse heart Mb (38.Irwin J.A. Ostdal H. Davies M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 94-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).Figure 2Changes in EPR spectral features of globin⋅ following the reaction of wild-type human Mb and H2O2. Reaction conditions and EPR parameters were as described for Fig. 1. Where indicated (arrows), g-values correspond to gx ∼ 2.036, gy ∼ 2.013, and gz ∼ 2.006. Spectra were obtained after 0 (A), 5 (B), 10 (C), and 30 (D) min. The EPR signal at g = 2.036 decayed to below the detection limit over 0–5 min and was detected again after a further 10 min at 77 K. The maximum concentrations of radicals detected were 0.26 ± 0.01 and 0.44 ± 0.01 mol of spins/mol of human Mb for signals at g ∼ 2.036 and 2.011, respectively, whereas the concentration of radicals measured at g ∼ 2.036 after 15 min was determined to be 0.20 ± 0.01 mol of spins/mol of human Mb. Data represent three or more experiments with different Mb preparations. mT, milliteslas.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To obtain further information concerning the identity of the protein radicals generated by the reaction of wild-type human Mb with H2O2, the spin trap DMPO was added to the reaction mixture prior to addition of peroxide. After 2 min at 20 °C, reaction mixtures treated with DMPO afforded a radical with a four-line EPR spectrum (Fig.3 A). The signal was relatively broad, with the outer most line at a lower g-value broadened almost to the base line. The broad nature of the EPR signal is consistent with a radical exhibiting restricted rotational motion on the EPR time scale and is indicative of DMPO trapping a radical on a large molecule (i.e. a protein). No EPR signal was detected in the absence of protein, DMPO, or H2O2 (Fig. 3,C–E, respectively). Treatment of the wild-type protein with iodoacetamide prior to addition of peroxide inhibited the formation of the radical adduct (Fig. 3 F). Simulation of the EPR signal from the DMPO adduct with WINSIM software (Fig. 3 B) indicated hyperfine couplings from single nitrogen (AN) and hydrogen (AH) atoms. Consistent with a previous report on DMPO trapping of protein thiyl radicals (39.Yeong-Renn C. Gunther M.R. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3308-3314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), addition of iodoacetamide after formation of the DMPO adduct did not significantly affect the EPR signal of the radical adduct on wild-type recombinant human Mb (data not shown). Hyperfine couplings obtained from these simulations together with reported values for relevant DMPO adducts are summarized in Table II. The couplings obtained from the quartet signal in this work are similar to those previously reported for the glutathione-derived thiyl radical (Table II). Importantly, hyperfine coupling of the free electron to the β-hydrogen in the DMPO adduct detected here is also similar to that reported for DMPO-thiyl radicals derived from both BSA and cytochromec oxidase (Table II). The magnitude of the hydrogen coupling is typical of a heteroatom-centered radical (40.Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1987; 3: 259-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). These data, together with the EPR spectra of the reaction mixtures reported above, suggest that a thiyl radical is produced on wild-type human Mb upon reaction with hydrogen peroxide.Table IIEPR hyperfine coupling constants for various DMPO adductsThiol sourceSolventANAHRef.GSHH2O1.51.649BSA aThe EPR signal of the DMPO adduct in these studies was attributed to that from coupling to single nitrogen and hydrogen atoms; however, only AH was reported as coupling to the β-hydrogen in the EPR analyses of the DMPO adduct was the only coupling clearly resolved.Sodium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4)1.636, 37CcOSodium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4)1.51.639Human MbSodium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4)1.4 ± 0.11.6 ± 0.2This workHyperfine coupling constants are given as data from a single literature source or mean of literature values (where applicable) or were derived from this study.

https://openalex.org/W1997161154,"The structure and regulation of the microsomal glutathione S-transferase gene (MGST1) are considerably more complex than originally perceived to be. TheMGST1 gene has two alternative first exons and is located in the 12p13.1–13.2 region. Two other potential first exons were determined to be nonfunctional. The region between the functional first exons cannot direct transcription. Thus, one common promoter element directing transcription exists, and RNA splicing occurs such that only one of the first exons (containing only untranslated mRNA) is incorporated into each mRNA species with common downstream exons.MGST1 expression and regulation are therefore similar to those of other hepatic xenobiotic handling enzymes, which also produce mRNA species differing only in the 5′-untranslated regions to yield identical proteins. MGST1 was previously considered a “housekeeping” gene, as non-oxidant inducers had little effect on activity. However, the promoter region immediately upstream of the dominant first exon transcriptionally responds to oxidative stress. In this respect, MGST1 is similar to glutathione peroxidases that also transcriptionally respond to oxidative stress. The discovery that MGST1 utilizes alternative first exon splicing eliminates a problem with the first description of MGST1cDNA in that it appeared that MGST1 expression was in violation of the ribosomal scanning model. The identification that the first exon originally noted is in fact a minor alternative first exon far downstream of the primary first exon eliminates this conundrum.

The classic membrane-bound GST is microsomal GST (also known asMGST1 orGST12), 2There are numerous abbreviations for the classical microsomal glutathione transferase enzyme. The gene and enzyme were designated GST12 at the Tenth International Workshop on Human Gene Mapping in 1989, but with the discovery of other microsomal GSTs, the gene designation was changed in 1998 toMGST1. which was first noted in 1982 (5.Morgenstern R. Guthenberg C. DePierre J.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and is a single-copy gene on chromosome 12 (6.DeJong J.L. Mohandas T. Tu C.P. Genomics. 1990; 6: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Other members of the membrane-bound GST family include 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein, leukotriene C4 synthase (7.Soderstrom M. Hammarstrom S. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 8.Metters K.M. Sawyer N. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol.

Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7220-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the latter enzyme is the one most closely related to MGST1 (38% identity on the amino acid level). A major difference between MGST1 and other GST enzymes is the ability of MGST1 to be activated (specific activity of the protein increased) post-translationally (12.Morgenstern R. DePierre J.W. Rev. Biochem. Toxicol. 1985; 7: 67-104Google Scholar, 13.Andersson C. Mosialou E. Weinander R. Morgenstern R. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 27: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Activation of MGST1 occurs by a variety of mechanisms including exposure to sulfhydryl-reacting agents, thiol-disulfide interchange, proteolysis, and sulfhydryl oxidation to form dimers (14.Morgenstern R. DePierre J.W. Ernster L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 87: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 15.Aniya Y. Anders M.W. Arch. Biochem.

Sies H. Akerboom T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which MGST1 activation proceeds is unclear, but is thought due to a higher rate of formation of the GSH thiolate anion within the activated enzyme (13.Andersson C. Mosialou E. Weinander R. Morgenstern R. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 27: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). MGST1 displays non-selenium glutathione-dependent peroxidase activity, and N-ethylmaleimide exposure (or activation) markedly increases this peroxidase activity (18.Reddy C.C. Tu C.P. Burgess J.R. Ho C.Y. Scholz R.W. Massaro E.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 101: 970-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Lipid and fatty acid hydroperoxides (linoleic acid/ester hydroperoxide), lipid peroxidation products (4-hydroxynon-2-enol), and oxidized phospholipids (linoleoylpalmitoylphosphatidylcholine hydroperoxides and cholesterol linoleate hydroperoxides) are MGST1 substrates (19.Mosialou E. Morgenstern R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 275: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 20.Mosialou E. Ekstrom G. Adang A.E. Morgenstern R. Biochem.

Biophys. 1995; 320: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this respect, MGST1 demonstrates non-selenium-dependent hydroperoxide activity similar to the selenium-dependent hydroperoxide activity of the enzyme phospholipid hydroperoxide-glutathione peroxidase (GPX4). MGST1 also conjugates a variety of potentially harmful xenobiotics, including halogenated hydrocarbons, activated esters, and unsaturated carbonyls (12.Morgenstern R. DePierre J.W. Rev. Biochem. Toxicol. 1985; 7: 67-104Google Scholar, 13.Andersson C. Mosialou E. Weinander R. Morgenstern R. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 27: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although GST reactions are generally a detoxification mechanism, the nephrotoxicity of several haloalkenes is attributed to hepatic microsomal GSH conjugate formation, metabolism of these GSH conjugates to corresponding cysteineS-conjugates, and subsequent translocation to the kidney, followed by bioactivation of the cysteine S-conjugates to a toxic intermediate (23.Anders M.W. Lash L. Dekant W. Elfarra A.A. Dohn D.R. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1988; 18: 311-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Chlorotrifluoroethene is a potent nephrotoxin that undergoes such bioactivation; and in rodent liver cells, 85% of the GSH conjugation with chlorotrifluoroethene (as a substrate) is catalyzed by MGST1 (24.Hargus S.J. Fitzsimmons M.E. Anders M.W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1991; 283: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The role of promoter induction or transcriptional regulation in increasing cytosolic GST expression is well documented. Although inducers of cytosolic GSTs have little effect on MGST1 activity, there are some exceptions. A consistent increase in MGST1 activity and protein occurs in mice treated with 2(3)-terbutyl-4-hydroxyanisole (25.Morgenstern R. Dock L. Acta Chem. Scand. Ser. B Org. Chem. Biochem. 1982; 36: 255-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A recent study noted that isoniazid, napthoflavone, clofibrate, and isosafrole produce moderate increases in MGST1 activity and mRNA content (26.Waxman D.J. Sundseth S.S. Srivastava P.K. Lapenson D.P. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5797-5802PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that transcriptional up-regulation plays a role in regulation of MGST1. Phorone (diisopropylidineacetone) is another agent noted to increase MGST1 in vivo (27.Masukawa T. Iwata H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As phorone reacts with sulfhydryl groups, it was originally believed that the in vivo induction of MGST1 was mediated either by disulfide interchange or covalent modification (activation by binding to the single cysteine). However, utilizing hepatocytes, it was subsequently demonstrated that these alternatives are less likely (28.Lundqvist G. Morgenstern R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We previously determined the structural organization of theMGST1 gene (29.Kelner M.J. Stokely M.N. Stovall N.E. Montoya M.A. Genomics. 1996; 36: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and assigned exons based on earlier work (30.DeJong J.L. Morgenstern R. Jornvall H. DePierre J.W. Tu C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8430-8436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, further investigation, as described here and elsewhere (31.Lee S.H. DeJong J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), reveals that the MGST1 gene is considerably more complex than originally deduced (30.DeJong J.L. Morgenstern R. Jornvall H. DePierre J.W. Tu C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8430-8436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as alternative splicing is utilized, and in response to oxidative stress, the promoter or upstream 5′-nontranscribed region directs transcription.

The cDNA from human liver was a gift from Dr. Inger Johansson (Institute for Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institute), and the pCDGM637 cDNA library was a gift from Dr. Paul Berg (Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA). The following primers were used to study whether products corresponding to the alternative first exons were expressed: lower, 5′-TTGTCAATCTATAGAATGCAGTTGC-3′ in exon 2; and upper, 5′-CTGGTATCATGAATTTGGA-3′ (corresponding to the alternative first exon in GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession numberR86750; exon 1A in Table I), 5′-GCGGCGGGACAGGCTTGCT-3′ (corresponding to the alternative first exon in H49331; exon 1B in Table I), and 5′-TTTTGACAGGGAATTGTATT (corresponding to the alternative first exon inAA314967; exon 1C in Table I), and 5′-CAAGTCCTAAAGCCTACAGTTTTG-3′ (corresponding to the alternative first exon in J03746; exon 1D in Table I). Note that there are minor nucleotide differences between the sequence in H49331 and the exon 1B we identified (described in Table I) from the P1 genomic, the HepG2 cDNA, and the GM637 cDNA libraries. The PCR amplifications were carried out in a total volume of 50 μl containing 1 μl of cDNA, 1 unit of Taqpolymerase (Kebo, Sponga, Sweden), 20 pmol of each primer, the reaction buffer, and 1.5 mm MgCl2.

Primer 5′-CCTCTGCTCCCCTCCTACCTAAAATCTAAG-3′ (corresponding to the common fourth exon) was used as a positive sequencing control. The Marathon cDNA amplification kit for RACE determination of 5′-cDNA termini and the 5′-stretch human liver cDNA library (HL1145Y) were obtained from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). RACE amplification of the human liver cDNA library was performed by using the upper primer 5′-CTTCCTCCTCCTCGGCCTCACCATTCCAGACCAAAA-3′ (located in the λ vector) in conjunction with the lower P1 sequencing primers for the various alternative first exons described above. PCR conditions were as described above, except that the annealing temperature was 65 °C, and 25 cycles was performed. The visible PCR products of the correct size were gel-purified and subcloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for nucleotide sequencing as described under “Materials.” Fragments containing the desired genomic regions of MGST1 were isolated from a P1 plasmid previously demonstrated to contain theMGST1 gene (29.Kelner M.J.

The genomic regions were then subcloned into pBluescript KS(−) for determination of nucleotide sequence and transferred into the pGL2 enhancer in the correct orientation to produce the desired luciferase expression vector. All inserted genomic regions in the pGL2 expression vectors were bidirectionally resequenced using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method of Sanger et al.(32.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R.

This eliminates variation in endogenous cellular cytosolic glutathione peroxidase (GPX1) (35.Hornsby P.J. Pearson D.W. Autor A.P. Aldern K.A. Harris S.E. J. Cell.

The transfection mixture was freshly prepared by mixing equal amounts of solution A (2 μg of desired pGL2-derived plasmid, 3 μg of SV-galactosidase vector, and 100 μl of DMEM) and solution B (10 μl of Lipofectin in 100 μl of DMEM), incubating for 15 min at room temperature, and then adding 800 μl of DMEM. The pGL2-derived plasmids were always cotransfected with the SV-galactosidase vector to correct for variations in transfection efficiency. Cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and once with DMEM, and then the lipofection transfection solution (1 ml) was overlaid onto the cells. Cells were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator. The transfection solution was removed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline; and cells were removed by trypsinization, combined, and then replated to allow for uniform distribution of transfected cells. Normal growth medium (2 ml) containing various quantities of paraquat was added, and cells were allowed to incubate for 18 h before luciferase and galactosidase assays. The medium was removed; cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline; and 400 μl of 1:3 diluted ALL lysis buffer was added, followed by agitation for 15 min at 4 °C. Fluid was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at maximum speed for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was removed for luciferase analysis using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). The medium was removed; cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline; and 400 μl of diluted reporter lysis buffer were added. Cellular debris was removed by scraping into a microcentrifuge tube, and the supernatant was collected. To 150 μl of supernatant was added 150 μl of 2× galactosidase assay buffer, and the mixture was allowed to incubate for 2 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with 50 μl of sodium carbonate, and the absorbance was determined at 420 nm. All values were corrected for endogenous galactosidase cellular activity. The chromosomal localization of P1 clone 2625 was determined by the fluorescence in situhybridization technique as described previously (38.Stokke T. Collins C. Kuo W.L. Kowbel D. Shadravan F. Tanner M. Kallioniemi A. Kallioniemi O.P. Pinkel D. Deaven L. Genomics. 1995; 26: 134-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 17-kb SacI genomic clone containing MGST1 was labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP by nick translation. Labeled probe was combined with sheared human DNA and hybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes derived from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes in a solution containing 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, and 2× SSC. The specific hybridization signals were detected by incubating hybridized slides in fluoresceinated anti-digoxigenin antibodies, followed by counterstaining with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Computer analysis of upstreamMGST1 regions for potential transcription factor- and regulatory binding sites was by several approaches. The regions were analyzed by a nonmatrix method including the WDNASIS® DNA motif Version 2.5 data base (latest version) and by matrix methods. Matrix methods included MatInspector® Version 2.2 software using the Transfac® Version 3.3 data base (latest version) utilizing both normal homology scanning (core similarity at 0.80 and matrix at 0.85) and high homology scanning (core similarity at 1.00 and matrix similarity at 0.95). The matrix approach was also accomplished by accessing the Signal Scan IMD Search Service of BIMAS using the MAMMALIAN matrix data base and the TFSEARCH Program (Version 1.3) using the TFMATRIX data base (Release 3.3). We isolated the upstream region of MGST1 cDNA clones from λ cDNA libraries derived from human HepG2 hepatoma (liver tumor) and GM637 fibroblast cell lines by conventional molecular biology techniques. Sequencing of these clones revealed a marked difference in the 5′-UTR (Table I), which corresponded to the first exon 1B (30.DeJong J.L. Morgenstern R. Jornvall H. DePierre J.W. Tu C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8430-8436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining mRNA sequence containing the coding region (exons 2–4) was identical in all isolatedMGST1 cDNA clones, indicating that they all encode for an identical protein (Table I). However, the clones definitely had different 5′-UTR sequences than previously reported (30.DeJong J.L. Morgenstern R. Jornvall H. DePierre J.W. Tu C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8430-8436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of human expressed sequence tag submissions in the dbEST data bank of GenBankTM revealed that the majority of the submitted clones had a 5′-UTR, or first exon, identical to that detected in our GM637- or HepG2-derived clones. Examples of dbEST clones from other sources with a first exon (and thereby second exon) identical to ours clones include liver clones T86061 and N78024, and fibroblast cloneH24621. There were two other submissions, clones R86750 and AA314967, with entirely different first exons. All of our clones and the GenBankTM submissions varied at the same exact point (exon 1/exon 2 junction) and were derived from different cDNA libraries, making it unlikely that numerous chimeric clones had been isolated by different investigators. Thus, there are at least four transcripts ofMGST1 mRNA, with varying 5′-noncoding ends, expressed in humans (Table I). Oligonucleotides specific for the different first exons (Table I) were used to directly sequence P1 clone 2625, previously demonstrated to contain the MGST1 gene (29.Kelner M.J. Stokely M.N. Stovall N.E. Montoya M.A. Genomics. 1996; 36: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The P1 clones containing human gastrointestinal glutathione peroxidase (GPX2, chromosome 14) and glutathione reductase (GRD1, chromosome 8) 3M. J. Kelner, unpublished results. were also directly sequenced, as negative controls, to ensure that we did not obtain erroneous sequencing results attributable to the P1 vector. When using the HepG2, adult liver, and lymphoid corresponding oligonucleotides, we obtained positive nucleotide sequencing results with theMGST1 clone (illustrating one of the advantages of using P1 clones with large inserts), but no results were obtained using these exon-specific oligomers with the negative controls (GPX2 andGRD1 P1 clones). These positive nucleotide sequencing results confirmed the presence of three potential alternative first exons that were in close proximity (<20 kb) to the MGST1second exon. PCR amplification of the MGST1 P1 genomic clone using these exon-specific oligonucleotides in combination with an oligonucleotide complementary to the adult liver-specific exon first reported (30.DeJong J.L. Morgenstern R. Jornvall H. DePierre J.W. Tu C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8430-8436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that these exons were located ∼6 kb upstream. No PCR products were obtained with the GPX2 orGRD1 P1 clones (data not shown), indicating that the derived sequences were specific to the MGST1 gene. It was therefore of interest to determine whether these mRNAs result from genetic variation or alternative splicing. Here we could demonstrate that PCR products of the expected size and sequence are produced when alternative exon 1B- and 1D-specific primers are used in combination with an exon 2 primer. The template was cDNA from a single human liver, and the results indicated alternative splicing. The strongest band was consistently obtained from exon 1B (Fig.1), corresponding also to the most frequent expressed sequence tag clone. Overlapping SacI and XbaI subclones of theMGST1-containing P1 phagemid clone were isolated and sequenced as described previously (29.Kelner M.J. Stokely M.N. Stovall N.E. Montoya M.A. Genomics. 1996; 36: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Complete bi-directional nucleotide sequencing of these clones revealed that the predominate or primary first exon 1B is located ∼6 kb upstream of the alternative or secondary first exon 1D that was originally described (Fig.2). The locations of the nondetectable first exons 1A and 1C were also identified. RACE analysis (39.Bertling W.M. Beier F. Reichenberger E. PCR Methods Applications. 1993; 3: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) to determine the 5′-cDNA termini was performed using an upper primer corresponding to the λ vector nucleotide sequence and lower primers corresponding to the different alternative first exons. The major product was only with the primer derived from the alternative first exon 1B. A faint band was detected from the primer corresponding to exon 1D. There was no detectable PCR product with primers corresponding to the alternative first exons 1A and 1C. Twenty-four clones were isolated from the exon 1B-derived PCR product. Nucleotide analysis of the clones revealed a common mRNA initiation site in the first exon 1B (Fig. 3), which matches a primer extension study (31.Lee S.H. DeJong J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Computer analysis of the 5′-flanking region or common promoter element (Fig. 3) revealed the presence of a potential electrophile response element site (60.Rushmore T.H. King R.G. Paulson K.E.

Disruption of these processes by gene mutations commonly results in chondrodysplasias that are characterized by dwarfism, skeletal deformities, and early onset osteoarthritis (2.Mundlos S. Olsen B.R. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar,3.Mundlos S. Olsen B.R. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Although the intracellular mechanisms involved in the regulation of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation are poorly understood, recent evidence suggests that cell cycle genes play an important role in these processes (for review, see Ref. 4.Beier F. Leask T.A. Haque S. Chow C. Taylor A.C. Ballock R.T. LuValle P. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Progression through the mammalian cell cycle is controlled by the sequential activation of several complexes of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)1 (for review, see Ref.5.Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4312) Google Scholar). Activation of CDKs is in part controlled by the expression levels of their respective cyclin partners. Therefore, much attention has been paid to the elucidation of the mechanisms controlling cyclin gene expression. The cyclin A gene is induced at the transition from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle and is necessary for progression through the cell cycle from this point on, first in a complex with CDK2, later with CDK1 (5.Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4312) Google Scholar, 6.Pagano M. Pepperkok R. Verde F. Ansorge W. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). Induction of cyclin A is caused, at least in part, by transcriptional activation. At least twocis-active sites in the cyclin A promoter have demonstrated importance for the induction of cyclin A transcription: a binding site for E2F transcription factors (7.Schulze A. Zerfass K. Spitkovsky D. Middendorp S. Berges J. Helin K. Jansen-Durr P. Henglein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11264-11268Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and a cyclic AMP response element (CRE; 8–10). One of the transcription factors binding to the CRE is ATF-2 (activating transcription factor 2; 11). ATF-2 is a member of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors capable of forming homodimers and heterodimers with other family members as well as with c-Jun (11.Ivashkiv L.B. Liu H.-C. Kara C.J.

Sidman R.L. Glimcher M.J. Glimcher L.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). We have recently identified the cyclin D1 gene, which is involved in progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle, as one target of ATF-2 in chondrocytes (18.Beier F. Lee R.J. Taylor A.C. Pestell R.G. LuValle P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Reduced levels of cyclin D1 in the ATF-2-deficient mice likely contribute to the phenotype of these mice. However, the skeletal phenotype of cyclin D1-deficient mice (19.Sicinski P. Donaher J.L. Parker S.B. Li T. Fazeli A. Gardner H. Haslam S.Z. Bronson R.T. Elledge S.J. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 621-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar) is much less severe than that of the ATF-2-deficient mice, suggesting that additional target genes of ATF-2 are involved. Here we demonstrate that the cyclin A gene is a second target of ATF-2 in chondrocytes and that reduction in cyclin A levels as a result of the absence of ATF-2 may also be in part responsible for the phenotype of ATF-2-deficient mice. The plasmids pcycAluc707 and pcycAluc707m have been described recently (9.Shimizu M. Nomura Y. Suzuki H. Ichikawa E. Takeuchi A. Suzuki M. Nakamura T. Nakajima T. Oda K. Exp.

Luciferase values are representative of multiple independent experiments, done in triplicate. Cotransfections were performed using 1.0 μg of cyclin A promoter plasmid, 0.3 μg of empty expression vector or expression vectors for wild type or dominant-negative transcription factors, and 0.2 μg of pRlSV40 (Promega) for standardization. Serum induction experiments involved transfections of primary chondrocytes or RCS cells as described (18.Beier F. Lee R.J. Taylor A.C. Pestell R.G. LuValle P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Cells were serum starved for 3 days following transfection and then incubated in medium containing 10% FBS. Cells were harvested at the time points indicated. For the GAL4 assays, RCS cells were transfected with 0.2 μg of pFA-ATF2 or pFC2-dbd, 1.0 μg of pRF-Luc, and 0.1 μg of pRlSV40. Cells were serum starved for 72 h, and the medium was exchanged for new serum-free medium or medium containing 10% FBS. Cells were harvested for luciferase assays 12 h after the medium change. For protein time course experiments, subconfluent RCS cells or primary chondrocytes were serum starved for 3 days, stimulated with 10% FBS, and harvested for Western blot analyses at the indicated time points. Chondrogenic RCS cells were serum starved for 3 days and restimulated with 10% FBS to examine cyclin A expression and serum inducibility. Cells were harvested at 4-h intervals, and cyclin A protein expression was investigated using Western blot analyses. Whereas cyclin A protein was hardly detectable in serum-starved cells and in the first hours after serum stimulation, cyclin A levels began to rise sharply after 4 h of serum stimulation and reached maximal levels at 12–16 h (Fig.1). This was paralleled by an increase in DNA replication as measured by bromdeoxyuridine incorporation. 2F. Beier, A. C. Taylor, and P. LuValle, unpublished observations. In contrast, medium changed to fresh serum-free medium induced only a very slight increase in cyclin A protein after 24 h (data not shown). We addressed the question of whether increased levels of cyclin A are caused by enhanced transcriptional activity by transfecting the plasmid pcycAluc707, which contains 707 nucleotides of the rat cyclin A promoter fused to the firefly luciferase gene (9.Shimizu M. Nomura Y. Suzuki H. Ichikawa E. Takeuchi A. Suzuki M. Nakamura T. Nakajima T. Oda K. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), into RCS cells. After transfection, cells were serum starved for 3 days, restimulated with 10% FBS, and measured for promoter activity at 4-h intervals. The low basal activity of the cyclin A promoter began to increase after 4 h of serum stimulation and reached its maximum at 12 h (Fig. 2). Medium changed to fresh serum-free medium induced only slight activation of the cyclin A promoter, suggesting that the serum inducibility of the cyclin A gene is caused, at least in part, by increased transcription. The 707-base pair cyclin A promoter fragment has been shown to contain a functional CRE that can confer binding of transcription factors of the CREB/ATF family (9.Shimizu M. Nomura Y. Suzuki H. Ichikawa E. Takeuchi A. Suzuki M. Nakamura T. Nakajima T. Oda K. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We used primary mouse chondrocytes (Fig.3 A) and RCS cells (Fig.3 B) to examine the involvement of the CRE in the regulation of the cyclin A promoter in chondrocytes. Cells were transfected with the plasmids pcycAluc707 and pcycAluc707m (in which the CRE has been mutated; 9). Mutation of the CRE caused a reduction of 70–80% in promoter activity in both cell types. The transcription factor ATF-2 is expressed in proliferating chondrocytes and necessary for chondrocyte proliferation (17.Reimold A.M. Grusby M.J. Kosaras B. Fries J.W.V. Mori R. Maniwa S. Clauss I.M. Collins T. Sidman R.L. Glimcher M.J. Glimcher L.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 18.Beier F. Lee R.J. Taylor A.C. Pestell R.G. LuValle P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). pcycAluc707 and pcycAluc707m were cotransfected with expression vectors for wild type and dominant-negative ATF-2 (18.Beier F. Lee R.J. Taylor A.C. Pestell R.G. LuValle P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) or empty expression vectors into RCS cells (Fig. 3 B). Whereas overexpression of wild type ATF-2 caused a 2.8-fold increase in the activity of pcycAluc707, dominant-negative ATF-2 strongly inhibited the activity of the wild type cyclin A promoter. In contrast, pcycAluc707m showed only weak responses to overexpression of both forms of ATF-2. Transcriptional activation by ATF-2 is enhanced by phosphorylation of NH2-terminal threonine residues through several mitogen-activated protein kinases (22.Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar, 23.Livingstone C. Patel G. Jones N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1785-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). We tested whether ATF-2 phosphorylation is increased by serum stimulation by Western blot with an antibody recognizing ATF-2 which is phosphorylated on threonine 71 (Fig. 4). After 12 h of serum stimulation (the time point where maximal activation of the cyclin A promoter is observed; Fig. 2), the amount of phosphorylated ATF-2 is 6-fold higher in stimulated cells than in control cells (as determined by densitometry). In contrast, the amount of total ATF-2 is very similar in stimulated and nonstimulated cells. To determine whether enhanced phosphorylation of ATF-2 in response to serum corresponds to increased transcriptional activation, we used a fusion protein of the GAL4-DNA binding domain and the ATF-2 transcriptional activation domain (Fig.5 A). This fusion protein can activate transcription from promoters containing GAL4-binding elements only when the ATF-2 domain is activated. Serum stimulation for 12 h caused a 10-fold increase in the activity of a GAL4-responsive promoter by GAL4-ATF-2, whereas a control plasmid encoding the GAL4-DNA binding domain alone showed no response to serum (Fig.5 B). To determine whether the CRE is involved in the serum induction of the cyclin A promoter, pcycAluc707 and pcycAluc707m were transfected into RCS cells, and cells were serum starved for 3 days and restimulated with medium containing 10% FBS. Wild type promoter activity was induced between 4 and 8 h and reached its maximum at 12 h (Fig. 6 A). Overexpression of wild type ATF-2 caused a higher basal activity of the cyclin A promoter without major effects on its inducibility. Overexpression of dominant-negative ATF-2 caused a clear delay in the induction of cyclin A promoter activity and reduced maximal activity. The induction of the CRE mutant displayed a delay of 4 h compared with the wild type promoter (Fig. 6 B). In addition, the maximal activity conferred by the mutant promoter reached only 40% of the value of the wild type promoter. Although the effects of ectopic ATF-2 on the activity of the CRE mutant were relatively weak compared with its effect on the wild type promoter, wild type and dominant-negative ATF-2 showed either significant enhancement or repression, respectively, on the serum induction of the mutant cyclin A promoter. We next addressed the function of ATF-2 in the control of cyclin A expression in chondrocytes in more detail by examining the regulation of the cyclin A gene in primary chondrocytes isolated from homozygous ATF-2-deficient mice (−/−; which display reduced chondrocyte proliferation; 12) and their heterozygote littermates (−/+; which are phenotypically normal). Wild type cyclin A promoter activity was reduced by 50% in chondrocytes from −/− animals compared with promoter activity in chondrocytes from −/+ littermates (Fig.7 A). Mutation of the CRE caused a further 40% reduction of promoter activity in −/− cells, whereas the same mutation repressed the activity of the cyclin A promoter by 78% in −/+ cells. We also demonstrated that loss of ATF-2 caused a delay in serum induction and a 50% reduction in maximal promoter activity in chondrocytes from homozygous ATF-2-deficient mice compared with heterozygous littermates (Fig. 7 B). Overexpression of ATF-2 rescued both of these phenotypes. Next we analyzed cyclin A protein levels in homo- and heterozygote ATF-2-deficient mice (Fig. 8). Whereas heterozygote chondrocytes express the 70- and 62-kDa isoforms of ATF-2, but not the recently described 66-kDa form (24.Maekawa T. Bernier F. Sato M. Nomura S. Singh M. Inoue Y. Tokunaga T. Imai H. Yokoyama M. Reimold A. Glimcher L.H. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17813-17819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), none of the three isoforms could be detected in −/− chondrocytes. Densitometric analyses revealed that cyclin A levels in subconfluent, unsynchronized ATF-2 −/− chondrocytes (cultured in the presence of 10% FBS) were 2.8-fold lower than in ATF-2 −/+ cells (after standardization to actin signals). Finally we compared the induction of cyclin A protein expression by 10% FBS in serum-starved primary chondrocytes from homozygous and heterozygous ATF-2-deficient mice (Fig.9). In heterozygous cells, maximal induction of cyclin A protein was observed after 16 h of serum stimulation, whereas in homozygous cells this induction was delayed, and maximal expression was clearly lower. Because ATF-2-deficient chondrocytes still displayed significant levels of cyclin A protein as well as activity of the CRE in the cyclin A promoter, we examined the possibility that other transcription factors might be responsible for this effect. The CRE is the target sequence for the transcription factor CREB, and CREB cooperates with ATF-2 in the regulation of the cyclin D1 CRE in RCS cells (18.Beier F. Lee R.J. Taylor A.C. Pestell R.G. LuValle P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition, Fos and Jun proteins have been shown to bind to the cyclin A CRE in other cell types (9.Shimizu M. Nomura Y. Suzuki H. Ichikawa E. Takeuchi A. Suzuki M. Nakamura T. Nakajima T. Oda K. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 25.Sylvester A.M. Chen D. Krasinski K. Andres V. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 940-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To address the function of these proteins in the regulation of cyclin A transcription, we contransfected cyclin A promoter constructs with expression vectors for dominant-negative versions of CREB, c-Fos, c-Jun, and ATF-2 into unsynchronized, subconfluent chondrocytes from heterozygote (Fig.10 A) and homozygote (Fig.10 B) ATF-2-deficient mice. All four dominant-negative constructs caused a reduction in cyclin A promoter activity in heterozygote cells. However, the inhibition by dominant-negative CREB and ATF-2 was largely dependent on the CRE, whereas dominant-negative c-Fos and c-Jun blocked the activities of the promoter plasmids with wild type and mutated CRE to a similar degree (Fig. 10 A). Dominant-negative ATF-2 had no effect in ATF-2-null cells, whereas dominant-negative CREB reduced the activity of the wild type promoter to the level observed for the promoter with the mutated CRE (Fig.10 B). In contrast, dominant-negative c-Fos and c-Jun caused similar reductions in activity of wild type and mutant promoters. We show here that the cyclin A CRE is necessary both for basal cyclin A promoter activity in asynchronously dividing chondrocytes and for serum induction of the cyclin A promoter. We have shown previously that ATF-2 is among the major transcription factors binding to the CRE in chondrocytes, thus regulating the transcription of the cyclin D1 gene (18.Beier F. Lee R.J. Taylor A.C. Pestell R.G. LuValle P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Here we identify the cyclin A gene as a second target gene of ATF-2 in chondrocytes. Ectopic wild type ATF-2 can activate the cyclin A promoter in chondrocytes, whereas dominant-negative ATF-2 inhibits the activity of the promoter. In addition, activity and phosphorylation of ATF-2 are strongly enhanced after 12 h of serum stimulation, when cyclin A promoter activity is maximal. ATF-2 activity is regulated through phosphorylation by several mitogen-activated protein kinases as well as protein kinase C α (22.Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar, 23.Livingstone C. Patel G. Jones N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1785-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 26.Kawasaki H. Song J. Eckner R. Ugai H. Chiu R. Taira K. Shi Y. Jones N. Yokoyama K.K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the protein kinase C phosphorylation site (serine 121; 23) is not present in the GAL4 fusion protein used in these studies, nor is phosphorylation of this site recognized by the phospho-specific ATF-2 antibody used. Therefore, a potential role of serine 121 in the regulation of ATF-2 activity in chondrocytes cannot be excluded. Experiments to identify the extracellular signals, intracellular pathways, and kinases regulating ATF-2 activity in chondrocytes are currently being performed in our laboratory. The effect of ATF-2 on the cyclin A promoter is conferred mainly by the CRE; however, mutation of the CRE does not abolish the effects of ATF-2 on cyclin A promoter activity entirely. These data suggest that ATF-2 regulates the cyclin A promoter through a second cis-active element in addition to the CRE. The cyclin A gene is also a target of the cell cycle-regulated transcription factors of the E2F family (7.Schulze A. Zerfass K. Spitkovsky D. Middendorp S. Berges J. Helin K. Jansen-Durr P. Henglein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11264-11268Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). E2F activity is regulated by the phosphorylation status of pocket proteins, which in turn is controlled by the activity of CDKs and indirectly by cyclin levels. Because ATF-2 regulates the expression of the cyclin D1 gene in chondrocytes (18.Beier F. Lee R.J. Taylor A.C. Pestell R.G. LuValle P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), it is likely that it also influences E2F activity and cyclin A promoter activity through E2F. Therefore we suggest a model in which ATF-2 regulates the cyclin A promoter in a dual way, directly through the CRE and indirectly through the E2F site (Fig. 11). Experiments are under way in our laboratory to examine whether the E2F site contributes to the effects of ATF-2 on the cyclin A promoter. The regulatory relationship between ATF-2 and cyclin A exists in vivo, as shown by the reductions in cyclin A protein levels, cyclin A promoter activity, and serum induction of cyclin A expression in ATF-2-deficient chondrocytes. These data also suggest that the reduction in cyclin A protein levels is at least partially responsible for the phenotype of the ATF-2-deficient mice. However, mutation of the CRE causes a larger decrease in promoter activity than loss of ATF-2. In addition, considerable CRE activity is present in ATF-2-deficient chondrocytes, suggesting that other factors activate cyclin A transcription from this site. The ATF-2-deficient mice used in this study are still able to express one isoform of ATF-2 (24.Maekawa T. Bernier F. Sato M. Nomura S. Singh M. Inoue Y. Tokunaga T. Imai H. Yokoyama M. Reimold A. Glimcher L.H. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17813-17819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, expression of this isoform could not be detected in chondrocytes isolated from heterozygote or homozygote ATF-2-deficient mice. Therefore, it is unlikely that this isoform causes the observed activity of the CRE in ATF-2-null chondrocytes. In contrast, overexpression of dominant-negative CREB in the ATF-2-deficient background reduces the activity of the wild type cyclin A promoter to that of the CRE mutant promoter, suggesting that CREB accounts for this (or the majority of this) activity. We have observed a similar cooperativity of CREB and ATF-2 in the regulation of the cyclin D1 gene in chondrocytes (18.Beier F. Lee R.J. Taylor A.C. Pestell R.G. LuValle P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition, the dwarfed phenotype of CREB-deficient mice (27.Rudolph D. Tafuri A. Gass P. Hammerling G.J. Arnold B. Schutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4481-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) suggests a role for CREB in skeletal growth. The AP-1 transcription factors c-Jun and c-Fos have also been shown to bind to the cyclin A CRE in other cell types (9.Shimizu M. Nomura Y. Suzuki H. Ichikawa E. Takeuchi A. Suzuki M. Nakamura T. Nakajima T. Oda K. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 25.Sylvester A.M. Chen D. Krasinski K. Andres V. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 940-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Overexpression of dominant-negative forms of these proteins inhibited cyclin A promoter activity in chondrocytes; however, these effects were independent of the CRE, suggesting that they act through different promoter elements. Because both c-Fos and c-Jun are necessary for maximal activity of the cyclin D1 promoter,2 it is possible that they exert their effect through regulation of E2F activity. Our data clearly show that the CRE and ATF-2 are important for serum induction of the cyclin A promoter. Deletion of the CRE, as well as loss of ATF-2, causes both a delay and decrease in serum induction. However, cyclin A promoter activity is still responsive to serum in both cases, suggesting that additional promoter elements are involved in serum induction. A likely candidate for this function is the above mentioned E2F site because E2F activity can likely be induced by mitogenic signals that do not require ATF-2 or CREB. In summary, our data identify the cyclin A gene as a second target of ATF-2 in chondrocytes. Both cyclin D1 and cyclin A are involved in the control of progression through the G1 and S phases of the cell cycle, suggesting that ATF-2 exerts its effect on chondrocyte proliferation and endochondral bone growth through the regulation of cell cycle progression. The complete characterization of these processes will contribute significantly to our understanding of the mechanisms controlling and of the diseases associated with skeletal growth.

https://openalex.org/W2000668418,"Mechanisms of transcription initiation appear to be remarkably conserved between archaea and eucaryotes. For instance, there is homology between archaeal and eucaryotic basal transcription factors. Also, the archaeal RNA polymerase (RNAP) resembles eucaryotic nuclear RNAPs in subunit composition and at the amino acid sequence level. Here, we examine the role of transcription factor B, the archaeal homologue of eucaryotic transcription factor IIB, in transcription initiation. We show that the N-terminal region of transcription factor B is required for RNAP recruitment. Furthermore, we reveal that mutation of a conserved residue immediately C-terminal of the N-terminal zinc ribbon motif abrogates transcription on certain promoters. Finally, we identify the promoter sequences responsive to this mutation and demonstrate that the effect of the mutation is to block a late stage in transcription initiation, following formation of the promoter open complex."

It exhibits a complex pattern of tissue- and development-specific expression. It is also a marker of the metastatic potential of many tumor cells. Previously, the human vimentin promoter was shown to contain several regions for the binding of positive and negative acting regulatory factors.

In vivo DMS footprinting by ligation-mediated PCR delineated the position of guanine residues important to vimentin expression.

Band shift assays, UV cross-linking, and Southwestern blot analysis confirm that the silencer element specifically binds a protein. Several lines of evidence show that ZBP-89, a zinc finger, Kruppel-like repressor protein is vimentin's silencer element binding factor.

Paulin D. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 39: 443-457PubMed Google Scholar). IFs include such proteins as keratins, vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, desmin, peripherin, nestin, internexin, neurofilaments, and lamins (2.Steinert P.M. Liem R.K. Cell. 1990; 60: 521-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 3.Parry D.A. Steinert P.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The IF system is a highly regulated, dynamic structure (4.Foisner R. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). So far, efforts to clearly define the physiological functions of IFs have not resulted in any unequivocal answers. It is known, for example, that cells can grow, divide, and differentiate in culture without any known cytoplasmic IFs being present (5.Hedberg K.K. Chen L.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 163: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, there is an enormous amount of data concerning the origin of tumors, and IF markers have been useful in identifying tumor types (6.Osborn M. Weber K. Cell. 1982; 31: 303-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 7.Osborn M. Weber K. Lab. Invest. 1983; 48: 372-394PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Zemar R. Fishman A. Bernheim J. Zimlichman S. Markowicz O. Altaras M. Klein A. Gynecol. Oncol. 1998; 70: 410-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although vimentin does not seem to be essential for growth, cell division, or development, it does contribute to the metastatic potential of melanoma and mammary tumors (9.Chu Y-W. Seftor E.A. Romer L.H. Hendrix M.J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 63-69PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Hendrix M.J.C. Seftor E.A. Seftor R.E.B. Trevor K.T. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 483-495PubMed Google Scholar). We hope that an understanding of the mechanism of vimentin gene regulation will ultimately contribute to controlling the invasiveness of some tumor cells. Initially, vimentin is widely expressed in the embryo but becomes progressively restricted to fewer cell types during development (1.Duprey P. Paulin D. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 39: 443-457PubMed Google Scholar). It is postulated that negative regulation is involved in the cellular extinction of vimentin during embryogenesis. To date, the following elements have been identified in the promoter region of the vimentin gene: a TATA-box, several positive regulatory elements including eight GC-boxes (11.Rittling S.R. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3908-3915Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), a NF-κB site (12.Lilienbaum A. Paulin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2180-2188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a PEA3 site (13.Chen J.H. Vercamer C. Li Z. Paulin D. Vandenbunder B. Stehelin D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1667-1675PubMed Google Scholar), and two AP-1 binding sites (14.Rittling S.R. Coutinho L. Amram T. Kolbe M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 1619-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) plus silencer elements (15.Salvetti A. Lilienbaum A. Li Z. Paulin D. Gazzolo L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16.Izmailova E.S. Zehner Z.E. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 230: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that of the eight GC-boxes, GC-box 1 is indispensable for vimentin gene expression (17.Izmailova E.S. Wieczorek E. Perkins E.B. Zehner Z.E. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 235: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Another interesting feature of the vimentin promoter is the presence of an upstream antisilencer element, which was recently identified in the human as well as the chicken gene (16.Izmailova E.S. Zehner Z.E. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 230: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 18.Stover D.M. Zehner Z.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2230-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The human antisilencer element can overcome the minimal activity of a distal silencer (DS) element as well as the repression exerted by the proximal silencer (PS) element described in this paper (16.Izmailova E.S. Zehner Z.E. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 230: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The current model of eukaryotic gene regulation suggests that many positive and negative acting factors control its expression. Over the years factors that enhance gene expression have been isolated, and their mechanisms have been studied in great detail. More recently, mechanisms that repress gene activity have come under scrutiny, and it is now apparent that there are several different ways to silence gene activity (19.Chang M. Jaehning J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4861-4865Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 20.Hanna-Rose W. Hansen U. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 229-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 21.John S. Workman J.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1836-1837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Ogbourne S. Antalis T.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). One level of gene repression is achieved by the highly organized and condensed structure of chromatin itself (21.John S. Workman J.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1836-1837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Lu Q. Wallrath L.L. Elgin S.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this case, the unraveling of chromatin by acetylation or methylation has been shown to affect transcription, and it has been proven that some repressors work by stimulating such processes as histone deacetylation (23.Lu Q. Wallrath L.L. Elgin S.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 24.Eden S. Hashimshony T. Keshet I. Cedar H. Thorne A.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 842Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). An example of a second class of repressors is Dr1 (25.Inostroza J.A. Mermelstein F.H. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1992; 70: 477-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). These proteins do not bind to any specific sequence in DNA but are proposed to act directly at the level of transcription initiation by blocking the formation of the preinitiation complex. The third class of repressors involves proteins that do recognize specific sequences in DNA (22.Ogbourne S. Antalis T.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). These proteins can be further divided into two subgroups depending on their proposed mechanism of action. One group recognizes a DNA binding site, which overlaps with that of a positive factor. Therefore, the negative factor works by competing with an activator for DNA binding. Other repressors bind DNA and inhibit gene expression directly by interacting with a specific component of the general transcription complex presumably by protein-protein interaction. Since vimentin synthesis is practically eliminated in certain stages of tissue development, we were interested in identifying its major silencer element and binding protein. In this paper, we have used ligation-mediated PCR (LMPCR) to first determine which guanine residues are important to vimentin expression in vivo. Transient transfection analyses with wild type and mutants thereof confirmed the precise localization of the major PS element. Moreover, we have identified the repressor, which binds to this element. We also present evidence for its interaction with the transcriptional activator, Sp1. These results suggest a mechanism by which the vimentin gene is regulated. HeLa, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231 (MDA) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum,l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). In vivo dimethyl sulfate (DMS)-treated genomic DNA was isolated from five dishes of each cell type using established protocols (26.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). As a control, genomic DNA isolated from untreated cells was exposed to DMS in vitro. All DNA samples were treated with piperidine prior to analysis by LMPCR. To cover the entire promoter region (−900 to +41) of the human vimentin gene, multiple oligonucleotides were synthesized for use as primers. Each region required a unique set of primers designated PR3, PR4, and PR5. Five such sets covered the entire promoter region (TableI). The position of annealing to the 3′-end of the sequencing primers, PR5, is shown. The oligonucleotides PR1 and PR2 were annealed to produce the unidirectional (staggered) linker (27.Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). The sequence of the PR3 primer was chosen to anneal to a known sequence 3′ of the region to be analyzed. Ultimately, LMPCR allows the clear visualization of any fragment containing a cleavage site due to DMS methylation of guanosine residues within approximately 200 bases of the 3′-end of PR3. Footprinting reactions were performed as described (26.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar, 27.Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Briefly, in step 1 the DNA (2.5 μg) is denatured and PR3 (0.3 pmol) is annealed and then extended with Vent DNA polymerase (0.5 units, New England BioLabs Inc., catalog no. 245L). In step 2, the unidirectional, staggered linker fragment (5 μm), with one blunt end, is ligated to the blunt end of the DNA fragment generated in step 1. In step 3, the new DNA fragment is denatured and PR4 is annealed and extended. In step 4, this fragment is PCR-amplified in the presence of PR4 and PR2 (both at 10 pmol). The sequence of the amplified fragment is visualized on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel by a final round of PCR in the presence of 32P-end-labeled PR5 (2.3 pmol). Primers (PR3, PR4, and PR5) were designed to possess a high T m (>59 °C) to reduce nonspecific binding and display increasing values during the various steps of LMPCR, since initial primers are still present in subsequent PCR steps when annealing to the newly added primer is preferred. The temperature of the annealing step in each reaction was chosen to equal the T m of that featured primer. Replicate experiments using the same DNA and primers produced reproducible cleavage patterns.Table ISequence of primers used for ligation-mediated PCRSetPrimerSequencePR5 3′-endTmaT m = 81.5 + 16.6(logM) + 0.41 (%GC) − (500/n), whereM represents the molar salt concentration and nrepresents the number of bases.°C1PR35′-TCCCACTGCCATCCCAGC-3′59.0PR45′-ACCTAGCGAGAAGCGGGGAGGG-3′65.6PR55′-GAGAAGCGGGGAGGGTGGGCGGG-3′−13270.72PR35′-TCCCGGAGAAGAGGCGAAC-3′59.0PR45′-TGGGAGCGCGGCTGCGTCTCT-3′65.6PR55′-AGCGCGGCTGCGTCTCTGGCGCG-3′+5870.73PR35′-AGGAACGCAGGGCTCAGG-3′59.0PR45′-TGGAAAGGGGGGCTGCTCCGG-3′65.6PR55′-GGAAAGGGGGGCTGCTCCGGCCC-3′−58370.74PR35′-CGCGACTTCAGATCTGAGGG-3′59.0PR45′-CGCTCCTTTGCCCGCGGGTCT-3′65.6PR55′-TTGCCCGCGGGTCTCCCCGCCTG-3′−38270.75PR35′-GATTGAGGGCTCCTAGCGG-3′59.0PR45′-GCTCCGCGCGCGCTGCTAGTT-3′65.6PR55′-GCTCCGCGCGCGCTGCTAGTTCTC-3′−81370.7Staggered linkerPR15′-GAATTCAGATC-3′PR25′-GCGGTGACCCGGGAGATCTGAATTC-3′64.9a T m = 81.5 + 16.6(logM) + 0.41 (%GC) − (500/n), whereM represents the molar salt concentration and nrepresents the number of bases. Open table in a new tab Various 5′-deletions of the human vimentin promoter were constructed by PCR and fused to the reporter gene CAT in the vector, p8CAT (28.Dente L. Cesareni G. Cortese R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1645-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). The expression vector pEcoCAT containing 1416 bp of 5′-promoter sequence from the human vimentin gene was used as the template (11.Rittling S.R. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3908-3915Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The 5′-primers were designed to contain anEcoRI restriction site at the 5′-end and anneal to various 5′-promoter sequences beginning at positions −261, −319, −339, and −353 as noted in Fig. 2 B. In each case, the 3′ primer (5′-ACGGAATTCCGGATGAGCATTC-3′) was complementary to the sequence upstream of the EcoRI site inside the CAT gene itself. All PCR products were digested with EcoRI and subsequently inserted into the EcoRI restriction site of p8CAT. For constructs containing the various mutations between −339 and −261, different cloning strategies were used. Seven 5′ PCR primers were synthesized, with lowercase letters designating the mutated bases as follows: mut1, 5′-TACGAATTCCTCTGGTTCAGTCCCAGGCGGACCCCCCCCTCACaatatGACCC-3′; mut2, 5′-TACGAATTCCTCTGGTTCAGTCCCAGGCGGACCaattaCTCAC-3′; mut3, 5′-TACGAATTCCTCTGGTTCAGTCCCAGatatACCCC-3′; mut4, 5′-TACGAATTCCTCTGGTTCAGTataAGGCGG-3′; mut5, 5′-TACGAATTCCTtTaaTTCAGTCCC-3′; mut6, 5′-TACGAATTCTTGGatTaaTGCCACC-3′; mut7, 5′-TACGAATTCTTGGCGTGGTGCCAaaaGACC-3′. Italics show theEcoRI site (plus 3 bases to increase restriction enzyme efficiency) used for cloning. The 3′ CAT primer mentioned above was used. The expression vector pEcoCAT was used as the template for PCR, and an expression vector, pH15, a derivative of pEcoCAT containing 251 bp of the vimentin promoter fused to the CAT gene in pUC19CAT, was used as the cloning vector. A unique XhoI site present at position −150 of the pH15 construct was utilized in generating all mutant constructs. For the mut1 construct, the PCR product was digested with XhoI, and the fragment containing the sequence from −319 to −150, including the mutated bases, was gel-purified and used for subsequent cloning. PH15 was digested with HindIII, filled in using the Klenow fragment to generate a blunt end, and subsequently digested with XhoI. The PCR product from above was inserted into the blunt XhoI site of the pH15 vector. For mut2 to mut7 constructs, the PCR products were first cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and then digested with XhoI andEcoRI. The resulting fragments containing the desired 5′-promoter sequences were used for subsequent cloning. In this case, the pH15 vector was digested with XhoI andHindIII. The entire multicloning site of pUC18 was removed by EcoRI and HindIII digestion, ligated to theEcoRI end of the PCR product, and subsequently inserted into the HindIII–XhoI site of the aforementioned pH15 vector. For constructs that contain double mutations, two 5′ primers were synthesized. For the double mutant construct of the human proximal silencer element (DM-PS), the 5′-primer is 5′-AGCAAGCTTCCTCTGGTTCAGTCCCAGatatACCaattaCTCACC-3′, and the mut2 construct was used as the template for PCR. For the double mutant construct of the Δ19 (DM-19) element, the 5′-primer was 5′-AGCAAGCTTGGatTaaTGCCAaaaGACCCC-3′, and the mut6 construct was used as the template. Italics show the HindIII site (plus three bases to increase restriction enzyme efficiency) used for cloning. The 3′ primer was the CAT primer described above. These PCR products were digested with HindIII and XhoI, and the desired fragment was inserted into theHindIII–XhoI digested pH15 vector. The DNA sequence of all constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture, DNA Transfections, and CAT Assays—HeLa cells were maintained as described previously and plated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes at 30–50% confluency, 30 min prior to transfection (18.Stover D.M.

Chimeric plasmids were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method with slight modification (32.Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virol. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). Standardization among different transfections was achieved by co-transfecting 1 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase (pCMV-β-galactosidase) to serve as an internal control plus pUC18 as a carrier to attain a total of 20 μg of DNA per transfection (33.Nielsen D.A. Chou J. MacKrell A.J. Casadaban M.J. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5198-5202Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). CAT assays were performed after standardization to a fixed β-galactosidase activity and analyzed as described (34.Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). Results were quantitated by the use of a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Crude nuclear extracts (NE) were prepared from HeLa, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 cells as described (35.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar, 36.Dignam J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 194-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (37.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), and aliquots in Dignam buffer D were stored at −70 °C. The cDNA sequence encoding ZBP-89 was excised from the fusion vector GST-ZBP-89 by digestion with SalI andBamHI and subcloned into like-digested pQE32 vector (Qiagene) (38.Merchant J.L. Iyer G.R. Taylor B.R. Kitchen J.R. Mortensen E.R. Wang Z. Flintoft R.J. Michel J.B. Bassel-Duby R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6644-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). ZBP-89 was subsequently expressed as a hexahistidine-tagged protein (His6-ZBP-89) and purified on a nitrilotriacetic acid-Ni2+ column per the manufacturer's directions (Qiagene). Samples of crude HeLa NE (10 μg), affinity-purified, recombinant His6-ZBP-89 (10–200 ng), and/or purified Sp1 (1 footprinting unit; Promega) were preincubated in reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) with competitor DNA (1 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA and 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) for NE versus 0.25 μg of salmon sperm DNA and 0.25 μg of poly(dI-dC) for purified proteins) for 15 min on ice. Thirty fmol of a32P-labeled DNA fragment (radiospecific activity of 1 × 1012 cpm/μmol) was added. The samples were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and applied to a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE and electrophoresed at 4 °C at 170 V, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. For competition assays, DNA fragments at a 50- or 250-fold excess were added to the preincubation mixture, prior to the addition of 32P-labeled DNA. For supershift experiments, the following antibodies were used: 1) anti-ZBP-89, a purified rabbit polyclonal antibody against the N-terminal part (amino acids 1–521) of bacterially expressed rat ZBP (38.Merchant J.L. Iyer G.R. Taylor B.R. Kitchen J.R. Mortensen E.R. Wang Z. Flintoft R.J. Michel J.B. Bassel-Duby R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6644-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar); 2) anti-KAP-1, a purified mouse polyclonal antibody against hexahistidine-tagged KAP-1 (amino acid 423–584) (39.Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W. Huang X.P. Neilson E.G. Rauscher F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar); 3) anti-Ku-86, a goat polyclonal IgG to the carboxyl terminus of the 86-kDa subunit of the mouse Ku protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); and 4) anti-Sp1, a goat polyclonal IgG supplied as TransCruz Gel Supershift reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein(s) were allowed to bind to DNA in the presence of nonspecific competitor, salmon sperm DNA and poly(dI-dC) and then subjected to gel electrophoresis as discussed above for EMSA. Afterward, the wet gel was exposed to UV light (254 nm) for 60 min, to cross-link the DNA to the protein(s), and then the bands were revealed by autoradiography. The gel pieces containing the complex(es) of interest were cut out, diced, and placed into Eppendorf tubes. Elution buffer was added (100 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 200 mm dithiothreitol, and 4% SDS), and the tubes were left on a rotator for incubation overnight at 37 °C. The buffer was transferred to a new tube, and the eluted macromolecules (protein(s) with covalently attached DNA) were precipitated with 2 volumes of acetone and centrifuged. The supernatant was removed and the pellet air-dried. The DNA component of the complex was not digested with DNase I, since digestion would remove the 32P-end-label, thus making it impossible to subsequently identify the bound protein. The precipitated macromolecules were solubilized in sample buffer and resolved on an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and autoradiographed. Crude nuclear extracts (100 μg) from HeLa, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 cells were separated on a SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membrane-bound proteins were allowed to renature in TNED buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5), and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 5% milk overnight at room temperature. Afterward, the nitrocellulose was rinsed three times with TNED buffer and placed in 3 ml of the same buffer containing 20 pmol (2 × 107cpm) of a 32P-labeled DNA fragment containing the PS-binding site. Hybridization was carried out overnight at room temperature. The membrane was washed three times (10 min each) with TNED buffer, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Protein G-Sepharose was equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and divided into three 30-μl portions. Three μg of anti-Sp1 (PEP2X, Santa Cruz) in 300 μl of PBS was added to two portions, whereas the third sample (control) was supplemented with 300 μl of PBS alone. The incubation was carried out overnight at 4 °C, and then unbound antibody was removed, and all three resins were washed once with 200 μl of PBS. Next, 100 μl of HeLa NE (740 μg of protein) and 100 μl of PBS were added to each batch of resin. Additionally, one of the resin samples, which contained anti-Sp1, was supplemented with PS DNA (final concentration 1 μm). After incubation for 3 h at 4 °C on a rotary shaker, each resin was washed three times with 400 μl of PBS. Sample buffer was added, and following boiling, resin-bound proteins were separated on a SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel. Western blotting analysis was used to confirm the presence of ZBP bound to the resin. Affinity resins were prepared as described (65.Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides bearing wild type and mutated PS DNA sequences were covalently bound to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. DNA-bound resin (two 50-μl portions, containing approximately 2 μg of DNA) was equilibrated with no salt buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 5% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). At the same time, two 100-μl portions of HeLa NE (700 μg protein) were diluted 10 times with no salt buffer, supplemented with 100 μg of salmon sperm DNA, and incubated on ice for 20 min. Then the extract was incubated with the resins for 4 h at 4 °C on a rotary shaker. Afterward, each resin was washed twice with 2.5 ml of no salt buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and then once with no salt buffer without detergent. Sample buffer (50 μl) was added to each resin, and, after boiling, the proteins bound to the DNA-Sepharose were separated on an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel. The presence of ZBP-89 and Sp1 was verified by Western blotting analysis. In vivo DMS footprinting via LMPCR was used to determine which regions of the human vimentin promoter are important for gene expression. We chose to analyze the human vimentin gene because of the existence of established cell lines that do or do not express vimentin to varying degrees in tissue culture. MDA cells, a human metastatic breast cancer cell line, express a high level of vimentin mRNA (40.Sommers C.L. Walker-Jones D. Heckford S.E. Worland P. Valverius E. Clark R. McCormick F. Stampfer M. Abularach S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4258-4263PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells, originally established as a carcinoma from an epithelial cell, co-express cytokeratins and a moderate amount of vimentin (41.Osborn M. Franke W.W. Weber K. Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 125: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Finally, MCF-7 cells, a nonmetastatic breast cancer cell line, do not express vimentin mRNA as judged by Northern blot analysis (31.Stover D.M. Carey I. Garzon R.J. Zehner Z.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3092-3095PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Sommers C.L. Walker-Jones D. Heckford S.E. Worland P. Valverius E. Clark R. McCormick F. Stampfer M. Abularach S. Gelmann E.P.

Previous DNA transfection analyses indicated that multiple regulatory elements exist between the DS element at position −780 and GC-box 1 at position −64 (see diagram Fig. 2 A) (12.Lilienbaum A.

Throughout most of vimentin's promoter (−900 to +41), no differences could be detected in the G-specific ladders of DNA isolated from MDA, MCF-7, and HeLa cells relative to the control DNA, methylated in vitro in the absence of protein. However, two regions displayed obvious DMS-hypersensitive sites. One area centered on GC-box 1 (data not shown). The importance of this element to gene activity is reported elsewhere (17.Izmailova E.S. Wieczorek E. Perkins E.B. Zehner Z.E. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 235: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The second area, reported here, shows four hypersensitive sites at positions −32"

Although TNFα and IL-1α both signaled the activation of nuclear factor κB and enhanced transcription of the KC gene with equal potency, only IL-1α treatment resulted in stabilization of KC mRNA. Nucleotide sequences that confer sensitivity for IL-1α-mediated mRNA stabilization were identified within the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) of KC mRNA using transient transfection of chimeric plasmids containing specific portions of KC mRNA linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. When plasmids containing either the 3′- or 5′-UTR of KC mRNA were used, the half-life of CAT mRNA was unaltered either in untreated or IL-1α-stimulated cells. In contrast, CAT mRNA transcribed from plasmids that contained both the 5′- and 3′-UTRs of the KC mRNA decayed more rapidly than control CAT mRNA, and this enhanced decay was prevented in cells treated with IL-1α. A cluster of four overlapping AUUUA motifs within the 3′-UTR was required, whereas the 5′-UTR region exhibited orientation dependence. These findings indicate that cooperative function of the two nucleotide sequences involves a distinct signaling pathway used by IL-1α but not TNFα. mRNA transcribed from the mouse KC chemokine gene accumulated to significantly higher levels in multiple cell types after treatment with interleukin 1α (IL-1α) as compared with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα).

The changes in gene expression associated with inflammation are stringently controlled in response to extracellular signals encountered in the microenvironment of the inflammatory site. Among the most potent of such signals are the cytokines interleukin-1α/β (IL-1α/β)1 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα). Although IL-1α and TNFα are structurally unrelated and interact with distinct receptors, they induce a very similar set of functional responses in many cell types (5.Vilcek J. Lee T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7313-7316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Le J. Vilcek J. Lab. Invest. 1987; 56: 234-248PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Dinarello C.A. Eur. Cytokine.

Indeed, some components of the intracellular signaling pathways that mediate cellular response to TNFα and IL-1α are shared (9.Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D.

Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3231) Google Scholar, 18.Baggiolini M. Nature. 1998; 392: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar, 19.Rollins B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The products of these genes serve to recruit select subsets of inflammatory leukocytes into tissue sites and have significant impact on the magnitude and character of an inflammatory reaction. In the mouse, one of the earliest events in inflammation is the infiltration of neutrophils, a process controlled in part by members of the CXC chemokine family that includes IL-8 and GROα (17.Luster A.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3231) Google Scholar, 18.Baggiolini M. Nature. 1998; 392: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar, 19.Rollins B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Though there is no direct equivalent of IL-8 in the mouse, the GRO-α-related genes are termed KC and MIP-2 (20.Sherry B. Horii Y. Manogue K.R. Widmer U. Cerami A. Cytokines. 1992; 4: 117-130PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Oquendo P. Albertas J. Wen D. Graycan J.L. Derynk R. Stiles C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4133-4137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the mouse KC gene is stimulated by a number of inflammatory agents including lipopolysaccharide, thrombin, platelet-derived growth factor, TNFα, and IL-1α/β in a number of cell types including macrophages, fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells (22.Hall D.J.

DiCorleto P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 2: 145-150Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Although KC mRNA expression requires increased KC gene transcription through the action of NFκB, IL-1α has been shown to enhance the accumulation of KC mRNA by prolonging its half-life in BALB/c 3T3 cells (27.Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 2: 590-596Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28.Ohmori Y. Fukumoto S. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3593-3600PubMed Google Scholar).In the present study we consider the mechanism(s) by which IL-1α can selectively stabilize KC mRNA. Although TNFα and IL-1α are both competent stimuli for the activation of NFκB and associated changes in gene transcription, only IL-1α stabilizes KC mRNA. Furthermore, both the constitutive instability of KC mRNA and the sensitivity to IL-1α depend upon two separate nucleotide sequences within the mature mRNA. Although a cluster of four overlapping AUUUA pentamers in the 3′-UTR is required for both rapid decay and IL-1α-mediated stabilization, this sequence motif is by itself insufficient and requires the 68 nucleotides composing the 5′-UTR as well.DISCUSSIONChemokines are now believed to be critical players in the development and resolution of inflammatory reactions (17.Luster A.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3231) Google Scholar, 18.Baggiolini M. Nature. 1998; 392: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar, 19.Rollins B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The overlapping target cell specificity and receptor utilization of many chemokines, however, suggest that the control of chemokine expressionin vivo may be an important determinant of their distinct functions (19.Rollins B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of many chemokine genes is known to be controlled at the level of transcription, and the mechanisms involved are well studied (27.Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 2: 590-596Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28.Ohmori Y. Fukumoto S. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3593-3600PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Ohmori Y. Wyner L. Narumi S. Armstrong D.

Indeed, prior work from this and other laboratories has demonstrated that stimulus-dependent changes in specific chemokine mRNA stability can be an important and even critical determinant of the level of specific chemokine gene expression (27.Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 2: 590-596Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 46.Kasama T. Strieter R.M. Lukacs N.W. Burdick M.D. Kunkel S.L. J.

In the present study, we have explored the IL-1α-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of mouse KC gene expression. The results of these experiments support the following conclusions. 1) IL-1α-mediated stabilization of KC mRNA is a general phenomenon that can be detected in fibroblast, epithelial, and endothelial cell types. 2) The IL-1α-initiated intracellular signaling pathway leading to the activation of NFκB is not sufficient for inducing alterations in KC mRNA stability. 3) Nucleotide sequences in the 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR of KC mRNA are both required for destabilizing the message and for conferring sensitivity to IL-1α for mRNA stabilization.IL-1α/β and TNFα are known to exhibit broadly overlapping functional activities that include the ability to modulate proinflammatory gene expression in a wide array of cell types (5.Vilcek J. Lee T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7313-7316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Le J. Vilcek J. Lab. Invest. 1987; 56: 234-248PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Dinarello C.A. Eur. Cytokine.

Not surprisingly, these agents also share many intracellular signaling components (9.Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar, 10.Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev.

Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). For example, both TNFα and IL-1 are known to stimulate the activation of NFκB, and data presented here demonstrate that, under the experimental conditions employed, both agents were equipotent stimuli for the induced degradation of IκBα, the activation of κB sequence-specific DNA binding activity, and the stimulation of NFκB-dependent gene transcription. Receptor occupancy by either IL-1α or TNFα leads to a series of sequential protein-protein interactions that are distinct for each ligand receptor pair (10.Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar, 12.Auron P.E.

Both pathways, however, converge with involvement of TRAF6 and share in common the downstream components NIK, the IκB kinase complex, and finally the release and nuclear translocation of NFκB. The finding that IL-1α but not TNFα can stimulate the stabilization of KC mRNA clearly demonstrates that IL-1α is able to activate signaling events that are not shared with TNFα. In this regard, TNFα and IL-1 have been reported to produce differential effects in some cell types and/or to use nonidentical signaling pathways to achieve the same biologic outcomes (14.Eder J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 319-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 16.Saklatvala J. Dean J. Finch A. Biochem. Soc.

At least a portion of this diversity is likely to involve the contribution of the stress-activated/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways (14.Eder J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 319-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 16.Saklatvala J. Dean J. Finch A. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 63-77PubMed Google Scholar, 49.Muzio M.

Med. 1998; 187: 2097-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), and recent reports link these signaling pathways with regulation of mRNA stability (50.Chen C.Y. Del Gatto-Konczak F. Wu Z. Karin M. Science. 1998; 280: 1945-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 51.Ridley S.H. Dean J.L. Sarsfield S.J. Brook M. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar).Multiple studies demonstrate that IL-1 can modulate the stability of specific mRNAs, including human GRO-α, IL-8, IL-6, COX2, and IL-11 (52.Stoeckle M.Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 917-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 53.Stoeckle M.Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1123-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 54.Ng S.B. Tan Y.H.

This activity apparently is mediated through specific regulatory sequences present in the mature mRNAs. As is true for regulatory sequences in genomic DNA that control transcription, there can be multiple elements in a particular mRNA that determine, either independently or cooperatively, the half-life of the molecule (50.Chen C.Y. Del Gatto-Konczak F. Wu Z. Karin M. Science. 1998; 280: 1945-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 55.Yang L. Yang Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32732-32739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed regions in both the 5′-UTR and the 3′-UTR of mRNAs can function in cooperative fashion to confer sensitivity to various stimuli (50.Chen C.Y. Del Gatto-Konczak F. Wu Z. Karin M. Science. 1998; 280: 1945-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 55.Yang L. Yang Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32732-32739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present findings confirm these prior observations and provide more precise determination of the nature of the sequence regions that are required. Although both the 68-nucleotide 5′-UTR and a portion of the 3′-UTR containing an ARE cluster are required, neither fragment alone alters the metabolic behavior of the reporter mRNA molecule; only when both sequences are present is the mRNA destabilized and sensitive to IL-1α-mediated stabilization. Whether these sites are recognized independently by distinct proteins or function as part of a larger complex remains to be determined.It is noteworthy that the sequence motif in the KC 3′-UTR that is necessary for destabilization and IL-1α sensitivity contains a classic AU-rich motif composed of four overlapping AUUUA pentamers. Such sequence motifs are well known to be important determinants of the instability of many growth factor and cytokine mRNAs (38.Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 3: 423-450Crossref Google Scholar, 39.Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar, 40.Caput D. Beutler B.

Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3106) Google Scholar). Studies of the mechanisms controlling mRNA stability demonstrate that shortening of the polyadenylated mRNA tail may be the first step in targeting an mRNA for degradation, and this is determined, at least in part, by the nature of the ARE motif (56.Xu N. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4611-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Whether sensitivity for IL-1-mediated modulation of stability is a property of all AREs or is restricted to a subset is at present not known.Furthermore, there have been many reports identifying RNA-binding proteins that exhibit sequence specificity for AREs (57.Hel Z. Skamene E. Radzioch D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5579-5590Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 58.Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. De Maria C.T. Crater D. De Haven K. Long L.

Biol. 1999; 62: 257-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). At least two families of ARE-binding proteins have been well characterized. The Elav family (embryonic lethal abnormal vision) contains at least four members (elr A-D), one of which, termed HuR or elr A, is widely expressed and has been clearly demonstrated to bind AREs and regulate the stability of ARE-containing mRNAs (62.Fan X.C.

A second well characterized RNA-binding protein is termed AUF1 and is a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein family (65.Wagner B.J. DeMaria C.T. Sun Y. Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Genomics. 1998; 48: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The binding of the HuR protein with an ARE containing mRNA is correlated with mRNA stabilization, while interaction with AUF1 appears to destabilize the target mRNA (62.Fan X.C. Steitz J.A.

Which, if either, of these proteins participates in the mechanism of IL-1α-mediated KC mRNA stabilization will be the object of future studies. The development of an inflammatory response is mediated, in part, by the modulation of gene expression in multiple participating cell types (1.Adams D.O. Hamilton T.A. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1992: 637-662Google Scholar, 2.Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. Pharmacol.

The changes in gene expression associated with inflammation are stringently controlled in response to extracellular signals encountered in the microenvironment of the inflammatory site. Among the most potent of such signals are the cytokines interleukin-1α/β (IL-1α/β)1 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα). Although IL-1α and TNFα are structurally unrelated and interact with distinct receptors, they induce a very similar set of functional responses in many cell types (5.Vilcek J. Lee T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7313-7316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Le J. Vilcek J. Lab. Invest. 1987; 56: 234-248PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Dinarello C.A. Eur. Cytokine.

Indeed, some components of the intracellular signaling pathways that mediate cellular response to TNFα and IL-1α are shared (9.Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar, 10.Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev.

Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). These signaling pathways lead to alterations in gene transcription, in mRNA stability, and in mRNA translation (10.Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar,13.O'Neill L.A. Greene C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 14.Eder J.

Members of the chemoattractant cytokine or chemokine gene families are recognized as important targets of TNFα/IL-1α during inflammation (17.Luster A.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3231) Google Scholar, 18.Baggiolini M. Nature. 1998; 392: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar, 19.Rollins B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The products of these genes serve to recruit select subsets of inflammatory leukocytes into tissue sites and have significant impact on the magnitude and character of an inflammatory reaction. In the mouse, one of the earliest events in inflammation is the infiltration of neutrophils, a process controlled in part by members of the CXC chemokine family that includes IL-8 and GROα (17.Luster A.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3231) Google Scholar, 18.Baggiolini M. Nature. 1998; 392: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar, 19.Rollins B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Though there is no direct equivalent of IL-8 in the mouse, the GRO-α-related genes are termed KC and MIP-2 (20.Sherry B. Horii Y. Manogue K.R. Widmer U. Cerami A. Cytokines. 1992; 4: 117-130PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Oquendo P. Albertas J. Wen D. Graycan J.L. Derynk R. Stiles C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4133-4137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the mouse KC gene is stimulated by a number of inflammatory agents including lipopolysaccharide, thrombin, platelet-derived growth factor, TNFα, and IL-1α/β in a number of cell types including macrophages, fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells (22.Hall D.J.

DiCorleto P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 2: 145-150Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Although KC mRNA expression requires increased KC gene transcription through the action of NFκB, IL-1α has been shown to enhance the accumulation of KC mRNA by prolonging its half-life in BALB/c 3T3 cells (27.Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 2: 590-596Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28.Ohmori Y. Fukumoto S. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3593-3600PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we consider the mechanism(s) by which IL-1α can selectively stabilize KC mRNA. Although TNFα and IL-1α are both competent stimuli for the activation of NFκB and associated changes in gene transcription, only IL-1α stabilizes KC mRNA. Furthermore, both the constitutive instability of KC mRNA and the sensitivity to IL-1α depend upon two separate nucleotide sequences within the mature mRNA. Although a cluster of four overlapping AUUUA pentamers in the 3′-UTR is required for both rapid decay and IL-1α-mediated stabilization, this sequence motif is by itself insufficient and requires the 68 nucleotides composing the 5′-UTR as well. DISCUSSIONChemokines are now believed to be critical players in the development and resolution of inflammatory reactions (17.Luster A.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3231) Google Scholar, 18.Baggiolini M. Nature. 1998; 392: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar, 19.Rollins B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The overlapping target cell specificity and receptor utilization of many chemokines, however, suggest that the control of chemokine expressionin vivo may be an important determinant of their distinct functions (19.Rollins B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of many chemokine genes is known to be controlled at the level of transcription, and the mechanisms involved are well studied (27.Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

RNA polymerase II polymerase chain reaction The Elongator complex is a major component of native RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)1elongation complexes and co-purifies with elongating RNAPII holoenzyme after its extraction from ternary DNA/RNA/RNAPII complexes (1.Otero G.

Elongator interacts directly with RNAPII and stable association is dependent on the C-terminal domain of the largest polymerase subunit being in a hyperphosphorylated state. Another RNAPII-associated complex, Mediator (2.Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, 3.Bjorklund S.

It is therefore an attractive model that Elongator displaces Mediator at the initiation/elongation transition in response to transcription factor IIH-mediated C-terminal domain phosphorylation and thereafter assists RNAPII during elongation (1.Otero G.

Svejstrup, manuscript in preparation. Elp3 is a histone acetyltransferase, pointing to a role for Elongator in chromatin disruption during transcript elongation. Deletion of ELP1 orELP3 confers a peculiar slow start phenotype, manifested as a pronounced delay in adaptation to new growth conditions. Elongator mutants are also salt- and temperature-sensitive. We have found that these phenotypes are in all likelihood a result of delays in the activation of genes required for growing under the new conditions. For example, activation of the genes GAL1–10, PHO5, and ENA1, which are normally repressed and turned on 50–1000-fold by appropriate growth conditions, is delayed and reduced in the mutants (1.Otero G.

Antiserum against the recombinant protein was raised in rabbits and tested for reactivity toward the subunits of essentially homogenous yeast Elongator (from the Mono Q step of purification) by immunoblotting. During chromatography of the Elongator preparation, immune reactivity precisely co-eluted with the other subunits of Elongator, Elp1 and Elp3 (Fig.1 A, and data not shown). Moreover, immune serum, but not pre-immune serum, specifically recognized a protein with the same mobility as the 90-kDa protein evident from silver staining of a RNA polymerase II holoenzyme preparation (Fig. 1 B). We conclude that the open reading frame, which we term the ELP2 gene for ElongatorProtein 2, encodes the p90 subunit of Elongator and elongating RNAPII holoenzyme.Data base searching revealed that the ELP2 gene product has eight domains with homology to WD40 repeats (Fig.2 A). These repeats are found in all eukaryotes and are implicated in a variety of crucial functions, likely by enabling specific protein-protein interactions (15.Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Moreover, homologues of Elp2 were found in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Arabidopsis thaliana (Blast scores 10−114 and 2 × 10−77, respectively). Importantly, the homology of the Arabidopsis and S. pombe proteins to Elp2 was not confined to the WD40 repeats, indicating that these proteins might indeed be functional homologues (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, a number of protein complexes involved in chromatin remodeling, such as CAF-1 (16.Verreault A. Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Cell. 1996; 87: 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), NURF (17.Martinez-Balbas M.A. Tsukiyama T. Gdula D. Wu C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The precise function of the WD40 domains in these complexes remains to be established, but it is an obvious possibility that they might enable a proper alignment of the respective enzymatic subunit they support with histone tails (20.Roth S.Y.

All the other elpΔ strains also failed to grow under these conditions when plated from midlog cultures (data not shown). By contrast, we observed that growth of elpΔ strains on high salt plates was only slightly affected when cells were plated from cultures grown into stationary phase rather than midlog phase, presumably because ENA1together with other stress genes becomes expressed as cells enter stationary phase growth (23.Ruis H.

First, the phenotypes of elp1Δ, elp2Δ, andelp3Δ strains are very similar. Second, the disruption of any two, or all three, ELP genes in the same cell does not confer a dramatic new phenotype that we have so far been able to find. These results clearly demonstrate that the products of theELP genes work together in a complex in vivo and indicate that the functional integrity of Elongator is compromised by deletion of any one of these genes. We have recently found that more or less the full range of elp phenotypes are conferred by point mutations which severely diminish the HAT activity of Elp3 in vitro. 3B. Ø. Wittschieben, J. Fellows, W. Du, D. J. Stillman, and J. Q. Svejstrup, submitted for publication. It is therefore tempting to speculate that a major purpose of the elongator complexin vivo is to serve as a vehicle for the HAT activity of Elp3, and that deletion of any one of the ELP genes leads to loss of the structural integrity of Elongator, leading to loss of productive Elongator HAT activity below a certain threshold, which, in turn, results in the growth defects described. The Elongator complex is a major component of native RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)1elongation complexes and co-purifies with elongating RNAPII holoenzyme after its extraction from ternary DNA/RNA/RNAPII complexes (1.Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M.G. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Elongator interacts directly with RNAPII and stable association is dependent on the C-terminal domain of the largest polymerase subunit being in a hyperphosphorylated state. Another RNAPII-associated complex, Mediator (2.Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, 3.Bjorklund S. Kim Y.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 335-337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), is exclusively associated with non-phosphorylated RNAPII and is recycled at transcriptional initiation (4.Svejstrup J.Q.

It is therefore an attractive model that Elongator displaces Mediator at the initiation/elongation transition in response to transcription factor IIH-mediated C-terminal domain phosphorylation and thereafter assists RNAPII during elongation (1.Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M.G. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Elongator comprises three subunits of 150, 90, and 60 kDa. The gene encoding p150,ELP1/IKI3, appears to have no significant homology to protein domains of known function (1.Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M.G. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). It does, however, have a well conserved Schizosaccharomyces pombe homologue of unknown function and, furthermore, might be the yeast counterpart of human IKAP protein (5.Cohen L. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The gene encoding p60, ELP3, is highly conserved, with likely functional homologues found in many higher eukaryotes, such as Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and man (6.Wittschieben B.O.

Svejstrup, manuscript in preparation. Elp3 is a histone acetyltransferase, pointing to a role for Elongator in chromatin disruption during transcript elongation. Deletion of ELP1 orELP3 confers a peculiar slow start phenotype, manifested as a pronounced delay in adaptation to new growth conditions. Elongator mutants are also salt- and temperature-sensitive. We have found that these phenotypes are in all likelihood a result of delays in the activation of genes required for growing under the new conditions. For example, activation of the genes GAL1–10, PHO5, and ENA1, which are normally repressed and turned on 50–1000-fold by appropriate growth conditions, is delayed and reduced in the mutants (1.Otero G.

Peptide mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry (12.Lui M. Tempst P. Erdjument-Bromage H. Anal.

Antiserum against the recombinant protein was raised in rabbits and tested for reactivity toward the subunits of essentially homogenous yeast Elongator (from the Mono Q step of purification) by immunoblotting. During chromatography of the Elongator preparation, immune reactivity precisely co-eluted with the other subunits of Elongator, Elp1 and Elp3 (Fig.1 A, and data not shown). Moreover, immune serum, but not pre-immune serum, specifically recognized a protein with the same mobility as the 90-kDa protein evident from silver staining of a RNA polymerase II holoenzyme preparation (Fig. 1 B). We conclude that the open reading frame, which we term the ELP2 gene for ElongatorProtein 2, encodes the p90 subunit of Elongator and elongating RNAPII holoenzyme. Data base searching revealed that the ELP2 gene product has eight domains with homology to WD40 repeats (Fig.2 A). These repeats are found in all eukaryotes and are implicated in a variety of crucial functions, likely by enabling specific protein-protein interactions (15.Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Moreover, homologues of Elp2 were found in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Arabidopsis thaliana (Blast scores 10−114 and 2 × 10−77, respectively). Importantly, the homology of the Arabidopsis and S. pombe proteins to Elp2 was not confined to the WD40 repeats, indicating that these proteins might indeed be functional homologues (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, a number of protein complexes involved in chromatin remodeling, such as CAF-1 (16.Verreault A. Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Cell. 1996; 87: 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), NURF (17.Martinez-Balbas M.A. Tsukiyama T. Gdula D. Wu C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 193-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and the B-type HAT complex in yeast (19.Parthun M.R. Widom J. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), all contain proteins with WD40 repeats. The precise function of the WD40 domains in these complexes remains to be established, but it is an obvious possibility that they might enable a proper alignment of the respective enzymatic subunit they support with histone tails (20.Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar,21.Vermaak D. Wade P.A. Jones P.L. Shi Y.B. Wolffe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5847-5860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the requirement for ELP2 in yeast, a diploidELP1/elp1 ELP3/elp3 strain was made in which one copy of the entire ELP2 gene was replaced with HIS3. This approach made it possible to easily compare the consequences ofELP2 deletion with deletion of the other ELPgenes, and to get an impression of the consequence of double and tripleELP deletion. The resulting ELP1/elp1 ELP2/elp2 ELP3/elp3 diploid strain was induced to sporulate, and the resulting tetrads were dissected. The same slow start phenotype previously described for elp1Δ, elp3Δ, and the elp1Δ elp3Δ double mutant (1.Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M.G. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H.

With all the different combinations of ELP delete strains available, we then did a number of phenotypic assays in order to investigate differences and similarities among the constructed strains. As shown previously for elp1Δ and elp3Δ (1.Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M.G. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol.

We then took advantage of growth conditions under which elp1and elp3 deletion had previously been found to confer mild growth disadvantages, with the expectation that possible differences in the degree of severity of the different mutations might be detected in this way. elp1Δ strains fail to grow on 1 mNaCl (YPD) plates when plated from midlog cultures, in all likelihood due to delayed and reduced transcription of the gene encoding the sodium pump, ENA1 (1.Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M.G. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). All the other elpΔ strains also failed to grow under these conditions when plated from midlog cultures (data not shown). By contrast, we observed that growth of elpΔ strains on high salt plates was only slightly affected when cells were plated from cultures grown into stationary phase rather than midlog phase, presumably because ENA1together with other stress genes becomes expressed as cells enter stationary phase growth (23.Ruis H. Schuller C. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). We grew cells to stationary phase and plated on 1 m NaCl plates in the hope that a graduation of severity of elp mutations could be detected, if it existed. However, as can be seen in Fig.5 A, all elp strains behaved similarly in this phenotypic assay. They all grew slightly less well than wild type. We next took advantage of a slow growth adaptation phenotype observed for elp strains on galactose (1.Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M.G. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 6.Wittschieben B.O. Otero G. de Bizemont T. Fellows J. Erdjument- Bromage H. Ohba R. Li Y. Allis C.D. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Again, we expected that if differences in severity of the differentelp mutations existed, they would be detectable by this assay (Fig. 5 B). All elpΔ strains grew slower than wild type, but no significant differences in growth rate betweenelpΔ strains were observed on galactose either. The following general conclusions can be drawn from these experiments. First, the phenotypes of elp1Δ, elp2Δ, andelp3Δ strains are very similar. Second, the disruption of any two, or all three, ELP genes in the same cell does not confer a dramatic new phenotype that we have so far been able to find. These results clearly demonstrate that the products of theELP genes work together in a complex in vivo and indicate that the functional integrity of Elongator is compromised by deletion of any one of these genes. We have recently found that more or less the full range of elp phenotypes are conferred by point mutations which severely diminish the HAT activity of Elp3 in vitro. 3B. Ø. Wittschieben, J. Fellows, W. Du, D. J. Stillman, and J. Q. Svejstrup, submitted for publication. It is therefore tempting to speculate that a major purpose of the elongator complexin vivo is to serve as a vehicle for the HAT activity of Elp3, and that deletion of any one of the ELP genes leads to loss of the structural integrity of Elongator, leading to loss of productive Elongator HAT activity below a certain threshold, which, in turn, results in the growth defects described."

To investigate its functions, we expressed human eNOS in a baculovirus system with deletion of a 45-residue segment from this region (residues 594–606 and 614–645, designated as Δ45eNOS), and characterized the purified mutant enzyme. In contrast with wild-type eNOS, Δ45eNOS exhibited characteristics resembling inducible NOS (iNOS). It contained an endogenously bound CaM, which was essential in folding and stabilizing this mutant enzyme, and retained 60% ofl-citrulline formation in 5 mm EGTA. We also produced four N-terminally truncated reductase domains with or without the 45-residue segment, and either including or excluding the CaM-binding sequence. Basal cytochrome c reductase activity of reductase domains without the 45-residue segment was up to 20 fold greater than that of corresponding insert-containing domains, and higher than CaM-stimulated activity of the wild-type enzyme. A series of mutants with smaller fragment deletion in this region such as Δ594–604, Δ605–612, Δ613–625, Δ626–634, Δ632–639, and Δ640–645 mutants were further characterized. The crude lysate of mutants Δ613–625 and Δ632–639 did not show activity in the presence of Ca2+/CaM, while other four mutants had activity comparable to that of WTeNOS. The purified Δ594–604 and Δ605–612 proteins had a 3–5-fold higher affinity for Ca2+/CaM, but their l-citrulline forming activity was still 80% dependent upon the addition of Ca2+/CaM. Both mutants exhibited a low level of the cytochrome c and ferricyanide reductase activities, which either did not respond to (Δ594–604) or slightly enhanced by (Δ605–612) the exogenous CaM. In contrast, activities of Δ626–634 and Δ640–645 like those of WTeNOS were largely Ca2+/CaM-dependent. Thus, our findings indicate that the N-terminal half of the 594–645 segment containing residues 594–612 plays a significant role in regulating Ca2+/CaM binding.

Despite structural similarities, the NOS isoforms can be grouped into two distinct classes according to their mode of expression and dependence on Ca2+. Constitutive NOS (cNOS) isoforms including endothelial NOS (eNOS) and neuronal NOS (nNOS), are constitutively expressed as latent enzymes that require a higher concentration of Ca2+ for CaM binding and enzyme catalysis (12.Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3128) Google Scholar, 13.Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). In contrast, cytokine-induced NOS (iNOS) is active at a basal level of intracellular [Ca2+], presumably due to high affinity of CaM binding. The Ca2+/CaM-dependent NOS activity was assumed to be an intrinsic property determined by the primary sequences at the CaM-binding region. However, sequence analysis showed that all isoforms contained a similar canonical CaM-binding sequence rich in basic and hydrophobic residues, typical for Ca2+/CaM-dependent proteins (14.Rhoads A.R. Friedman J.E. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Furthermore, chimeric eNOS and nNOS in which the CaM-binding region was replaced with the corresponding region of murine iNOS (residues 503–532) did not exhibit fully Ca2+-independent NOS activity (15.Ruan J.

Sequence alignment among NOS isoforms suggests that a ∼50-residue segment present in the FMN-binding domain of human eNOS (residues 594–645) and nNOS (residues 834–882) but absent in that of iNOS represents a putative autoinhibitory element that impedes CaM binding to cNOSs at the basal level of intracellular [Ca2+], a feature common to many Ca2+/CaM-dependent proteins (19.Goldberg J. Nairn A.C. Kurian J. Cell. 1996; 84: 875-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). This notion was supported by inhibition of CaM binding and catalytic activities of eNOS and nNOS with synthetic peptides corresponding to this segment of eNOS, and reversal of inhibition by exogenous CaM (20.Salerno J.C. Harris D.E. Irizarry K. Patel B. Morales A.J. Smith S.M. Martasek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S. Jones C.L. Weissman B.A. Lane P. Liu Q. Gross S.S. J. Biol.

However, it remains unclear how the presence of this segment in the constitutive NOS isoforms affects the Ca2+/CaM dependence, and whether the segment has other roles in function of intact eNOS. To address these issues, we prepared a series of mutants by deleting this segment to various extent from eNOS as well as N-terminally truncated reductase domains with or without this segment and CaM-binding sequence. The effects of various mutants on Ca2+/CaM dependence, catalytic activities, and electron transfer are evaluated in this study. l-[2,3,4,5-3H]Arginine (58 Ci/mmol), ECL detection kit, CaM-Sepharose, and 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose were products of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.

An insertion of a 45-amino acid segment, which is located in the FMN subdomain (Fig.1 B), represents a major sequence difference among the three NOS isoforms. Fig. 1 C is a schematic diagram showing the proteins that were constructed, expressed, and purified. The 45-amino acid insert was deleted by the method of polymerase chain reaction. Two steps of deletion were performed. The fragment (residues 614–645) of eNOS was first deleted by using two pairs of primer: 5′-1741CTGGTGCTGGTGGTAACCAGC and 5′-1884GAATCGAATCTTATAACTCTTGTG, and 5′-1970CTGGGTCGATTCAGGTTCTGTGTGTTC and 5′-2520TCAGTGGGCGCCGGCGGGTCC. The second fragment (residues 594–606) was then further deleted from the first deleted mutant by using two pairs of primer: 5′-1730GAACACGAGACGCTGGTGCT and 5′-1822CTCCATTAATGCAGCTGCAAAGCTCTCTCC, and 5′-CCTCGATTAATGGAGATG1865AAGAGTTATAAGATTCGATTCAGG and 5′-2520TCAGTGGGCGCCGGCGGGTCC. The resultant construct (Δ45eNOS) was expressed in a Sf9/baculovirus system. Constructs of reductase domain were prepared using polymerase chain reaction-mediated amplification. The primers GGGGAATTCACCATG1490GGGAGTGCCGCCAAGGGCand3796TGCTGAATTCTTGCAGCCTCTG were used for amplification of CaM/FMN/FAD and Δ45CaM/FMN/FAD domains, which contained CaM-, FMN-, and FAD-binding regions (residues 482–1204); Δ45CaM/FMN/FAD domain lacked of the 45-residue insert. The primers1561CTCCGAATTCATCATGGGCACGGTGATG and3796TGCTGAATTCTTGCAGCCTCTG were used for amplification of FMN/FAD and Δ45FMN/FAD domains (residues 511–1204), which contained the FMN- and FAD-binding regions but not the CaM-binding sequence; the 45-residue insert was absent in Δ45FMN/FAD domain. We used the wild-type eNOS (WTeNOS) cDNA as template for amplification of CaM/FMN/FAD and FMN/FAD domains, and Δ45eNOS cDNA as template for Δ45CaM/FMN/FAD and Δ45FMN/FAD domains. A series of mutants with smaller fragment deletions such as Δ594–604, Δ605–612, Δ613–625, Δ626–634, Δ632–639, and Δ640–645 were also generated using PCR amplification. The primers used for amplification and the residues deleted for each mutant are listed below.SEQUENCES 1–6 All primers were synthesized by Genosys Inc. (Woodlands, TX). Sequences of the mutant cDNAs at junctional regions were confirmed by sequencing using the dideoxy chain termination method (26.Sanger, F., Nicklen, S., and Coulson, A. R. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 74, 5463–5467Google Scholar). cDNAs for the WTeNOS, deletion mutants (Δ45eNOS, Δ594–604, Δ605–612, Δ613–625, Δ626–634, Δ632–639, and Δ640–645), and N-terminally truncated reductase domains (CaM/FMN/FAD, Δ45CaM/FMN/FAD, FMN/FAD and Δ45FMN/FAD) were inserted intoEcoRI site of pVL1392 transfer vector, which was used to generate recombinant viruses in Sf9/baculovirus system. Due to naturally low heme biosynthetic capability in the Sf9 cells, heme chloride (4 μg/ml) was added into the culture medium 48 h after infection to enrich heme content for the expressed WTeNOS and deletion mutants. The same procedure was used to express the N-terminally truncated reductase domains except for omission of hemin chloride from the culture medium. The cells were harvested 72 h after infection and suspended in buffer containing 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 μmleupeptin, 1 μm antipain, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol. The cells were sonicated 20 s for three times and centrifuged at 30,000 ×g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose affinity column (1.5 × 5 cm). The protein was eluted with 5 mm 2′-AMP plus 0.5 m NaCl and concentrated by Centriprep-30 (Amicon). The concentrated fraction was applied onto a gel-filtration chromatography (1 × 120 cm, Ultrogel AcA34, Sepracor). The running buffer of gel-filtration column for WTeNOS and ΔeNOS deletion mutants contained 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol, but for all N-terminally truncated reductase domains, DTT was omitted from the buffer. To obtain CaM-free Δ45eNOS, WTeNOS and Δ45eNOS were inserted into a bacterial expression pCWori vector, which was cotransfected with the pgroESL or pACYC184-CaM plasmid (a generous gift from Dr. E. E. Strehler) in BL21 Escherichia coli cells according to the procedures reported by McMillan and Masters (11.McMillan K. Masters B.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3686-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The nitrate/nitrite accumulation in culture medium was measured using a colorimetric assay kit from Cayman Chemical Co. (Alexis, San Diego, CA). Ten million Sf9 cells were seeded in each T75culture flask, each of which was individually infected with recombinant viruses (multiplicity of infection 2) for WTeNOS and deletion mutant expressions. Hemin chloride was added into the culture medium 24 h after infection. The amount of nitrite/nitrate in the culture medium was determined at the indicated time by adding Griess reagent. The absorbance at 540 nm was recorded using Dynatech MR5000 microplate reader, and NO2−/ NO3− was quantified using NaNO3 as standard. NOS activity was assayed by measuring conversion of l-[3H]arginine tol-[3H]citrulline as described by Bredtet al. (6.Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar) with slight modification. The reaction mixture containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm DTT, 0.5 μm calmodulin, 100 μmCaCl2, 100 μm β-NADPH, 100 μmBH4, 50 μm l-arginine, 10% glycerol, and 1 μCi of l-[3H]arginine was incubated with 1 μg of enzyme at 37 °C for 5 min. Cytochromec reductase activity was determined at 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 50 μm cytochromec, 0.5 μm calmodulin, 100 μmCaCl2, and ∼3 μg of enzymes. The reaction was initiated by addition of 100 μm β-NADPH and the absorbance at 550 nm was recorded in a Shimadzu-2501 PC equipped with a TCC temperature controller. The reduced cytochrome c was quantified using Δεred-ox of 21 mm−1cm−1. Ferricyanide reduction was measured at 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing 0.5 mm ferricyanide and quantified using Δεred-ox of 1.02 mm−1 cm−1 at 420 nm. To measure NOS activity at different free Ca2+ concentrations, a 100 mm stock of Ca2+-EGTA (Molecular Probes, Inc.) was used to obtain the desired free Ca2+ solution as calculated according to manufacturer's procedure using the K d value of (Ca2+-EGTA) = 43.7 nm at 37 °C in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.1 m KCl. Optical spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu-2501 PC equipped with a TCC temperature controller. The ferrous heme-CO spectrum was obtained by flushing the sample with CO gas, followed by reducing the sample with a few grains of dithionite. The binding affinity of l-arginine for WTeNOS and deletion mutants was determined by perturbation difference spectroscopy as described by McMillan and Masters (27.McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9875-9880Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and dissociation constant (K d) value was estimated as described previously (9.Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14631-14635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (28.Bradford M.M Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed on 7.5% slab gel using 3% stacking gel in a Bio-Rad mini-gel apparatus according to the Laemmli (29.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) procedures and stained by Coomassie Blue R250. For CaM immunoblot, the purified protein (5 μg) was subjected to SDS-PAGE in 15% gel under reducing condition and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride blot membrane in 25 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 at 20 V and 4 °C overnight. The monoclonal antibody raised against CaM (catalog no. C-7055, Sigma) was used. The blot was detected by ECL method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate as secondary antibody. Sequence alignment shows that human eNOS contains a 45-residue insert (residues 594–606 and residues 614–645, Fig.1 A) in the FMN subdomain (Fig.1 B), which is also present in nNOS but absent in iNOS or other related flavoproteins. An eNOS mutant with the deletion of this 45-amino acid segment designated as Δ45eNOS (Fig. 1 C) was constructed and expressed in Sf9 cells. When a comparable amount of protein was expressed, the NO2−/ NO3− concentration in the cultured medium of the Sf9 cells 74 h after infection with Δ45eNOS recombinant viruses was about 50-fold higher than that produced by Sf9 cells infected with WTeNOS recombinant viruses (82 μm versus 1.5 μm). These results suggest that Δ45eNOS is active at the basal level of intracellular [Ca2+] (Fig. 2). WTeNOS and Δ45eNOS proteins were purified to near homogeneity and shown to have molecular masses of 133 and 123 kDa, respectively (Fig.3, lanes 1 and2). The absorbance spectrum of purified Δ45eNOS exhibited a Soret peak at ∼401 nm, a charge-transfer band at 647 nm, and a flavin absorbance shoulder between 450 nm and 475 nm (Fig.4 A). Addition of 1 mm imidazole shifted the Soret peak to 428 nm, and the low spin heme-imidazole complex could be converted back to high spin heme (397 nm) upon addition of 1 mm l-arginine (Fig.4 A). The K d value of Δ45eNOS forl-arginine calculated from the spectral changes was 1.4 μm (Fig. 4 A, inset). The dithionite-reduced, CO-saturated Δ45eNOS displayed spectral peaks at 445 and 550 nm (Fig. 4 B). These spectral properties are similar to those of WTeNOS (30.Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6114-6118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), indicating that deletion of 45 residues did not perturb the heme electronic environment.Figure 4Optical absorption spectra of Δ45eNOS.

In the presence of all essential cofactors, the specific activity of l-citrulline formation was170 nmol/min/mg for Δ45eNOS versus 130 nmol/min/mg for WTeNOS. Omission of BH4 resulted in a 65–75% reduction inl-citrulline formation for both WTeNOS and Δ45eNOS, with the residual activity presumably due to the endogenous BH4in the purified proteins. However, omission of CaM from the reaction mixture completely eliminated l-citrulline formation for WTeNOS without an apparent effect for Δ45eNOS. It was reported that murine iNOS retained 50–85% of enzyme activity in 5 mmEGTA (15.Ruan J. Xie Q. Hutchinson N. Cho H. Wolfe G.C. Nathan C. J. Biol.

Mitchell J.A. Warner T.D. Harald H.H. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Nakane M. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10480-10484Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, 16.Venema R.C. Sayegh H.S. Kent J.D. Harrison D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6435-6440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Catalytic activity was thus measured in the presence of 5 mm EGTA. No activity was detected for the WTeNOS, but ∼60% of activity was still retained for Δ45eNOS. This behavior indicates that the activity of Δ45eNOS is largely Ca2+-independent and WTeNOS is fully Ca2+/CaM-dependent (Fig. 5). To determine whether the Ca2+/CaM independence of Δ45eNOS was attributed to an intrinsically bound CaM, the purified proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot with anti-CaM monoclonal antibody. An endogenously bound CaM was found in Δ45eNOS but not in WTeNOS (Fig. 6,lanes 1 and 2). We have tried to obtain CaM-free Δ45eNOS to test whether Δ45eNOS could generate⋅NO in the absence of CaM by using a bacterial expression system. WTeNOS and Δ45eNOS were cloned into a bacterial expression pCWori vector, which was cotransfected with the pgroESL or pACYC184-CaM plasmid into BL21 E. coli cells. WTeNOS purified from either system was similar and active, whereas Δ45eNOS had to be coexpressed with pACYC184-CaM, suggesting that Δ45eNOS requires CaM to properly fold and stabilize its conformational structure (data not shown). In order to elucidate the reciprocal relationship between the 45-residue segment and canonical CaM-binding region, we next prepared N-terminally truncated constructs of the eNOS reductase domains containing FMN- and FAD-binding regions, and either including (CaM/FMN/FAD construct, residues 482–1204) or excluding (FMN/FAD construct, residues 511–1204) the CaM-binding sequence. Two other reductase domains were constructed by deleting this 45-residue segment from the CaM/FMN/FAD construct (Δ45CaM/FMN/FAD) and the FMN/FAD construct (Δ45FMN/FAD). These four reductase domains were expressed in the Sf9/baculovirus system and purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 3). We generally obtained about 30 mg of purified reductase domains from 4 × 109 Sf9 cells. The apparent molecular masses on SDS-PAGE analysis were ∼80 kDa (CaM/FMN/FAD), ∼75 kDa (Δ45CaM/FMN/FAD), ∼77 kDa (FMN/FAD), and ∼72 kDa (Δ45FMN/FAD) (Fig. 3, lanes 3–6). An endogenously bound CaM was not detected in these purified domains (Fig.6, lanes 3–6). Each of the constructs displayed almost a 1:1 FAD to FMN ratio (∼0.8 eq) (data not shown), indicating that removal of the 45-residue segment did not perturb FMN binding affinity. The absorbance spectra of the purified reductase domains had absorption peaks at 454 and 381 nm (Fig.7, A–D). Both CaM/FMN/FAD (Fig. 7 A) and FMN/FAD (Fig. 7 C) domains, which contained the 45-residue segment exhibited an additional prominent peak at 590 nm in the resting state, attributable to an air-stable flavin semiquinone radical, whereas both domains without the 45-residue segment (Δ45CaM/FMN/FAD and Δ45FMN/FAD) did not exhibit the semiquinone peak in the resting state (Fig. 7, B andD). Addition of NADPH produced a spectrum characteristic of the air-stable semiquinone form in all reductase domains (Fig. 7,A–D). Presumably this portion is due to partial reduction of FMN or FAD in contrast to a complete reduction to flavin hydroquinone by dithionite. The NADPH-dependent electron transfer rates to ferricyanide and cytochrome c were determined using the purified proteins in the absence (basal) or presence of Ca2+/CaM (TableI). Cytochrome c and ferricyanide reductase activities in the WTeNOS were increased 3–5-fold in the presence of CaM. Both activities in Δ45eNOS did not respond to exogenous CaM and were ∼2-fold higher than CaM-stimulated activities of WTeNOS. CaM/FMN/FAD domain (residues 482–1204) displayed a similar rank order of basal and CaM-stimulated ferricyanide reductions. The cytochrome c reduction of this domain was enhanced 3.5 times by addition of Ca2+/CaM. Basal and CaM-stimulated cytochrome reductions in the CaM/FMN/FAD domain were both 4-fold higher than that of WTeNOS and also higher than that previously reported for a slightly shorter reductase domain (residues 491–1204, Ref. 9.Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14631-14635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The reason for the later difference is unknown. The corresponding reductase domain lacking the 45-residue insert (Δ45CaM/FMN/FAD) had an even higher ferricyanide reductase activity, which was slightly stimulated by CaM. Adding Ca2+/CaM to this domain enhanced cytochrome creduction by 3-fold. The FMN/FAD reductase domain had a low level of ferricyanide and cytochrome c reduction rates, which were not significantly changed by CaM, consistent with its not containing a CaM-binding sequence. The Δ45FMN/FAD reductase domain had ferricyanide and cytochrome c reductase activities which were 3- and 20-fold, respectively, greater than those of the parent FMN/FAD domain, and which was not enhanced by exogenously added CaM.Table ICatalytic activities of the purified wild-type, deleted eNOS, and reductase domainsConstructsaConstructs are shown in Fig. 1.l-Citrulline formationbThe l-citrulline formation was assayed in a mixture containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm DTT, 0.5 μm calmodulin, 100 μm CaCl2, 100 μm β-NADPH, 100 μm BH4, 50 μm l-arginine, 1 μCi of l-[3H]arginine, and 10% glycerol.Cytochrome creductasecCytochrome c reduction was determined in a mixture containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 μm calmodulin, 100 μmCaCl2, 50 μm cytochrome c, and 100 μm β-NADPH, and the absorbance at 550 nm was recorded.Ferricyanide reductasedFerricyanide reduction was determined in a reaction mixture co"

SH2-Bβ colocalized with filamentous actin in GH and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced membrane ruffles. To test if SH2-Bβ is required for actin reorganization, we transiently overexpressed wild-type or mutant SH2-Bβ in 3T3-F442A cells and assayed for GH- and PDGF-induced membrane ruffling and fluid phase pinocytosis. Overexpression of wild-type SH2-Bβ enhanced ruffling and pinocytosis produced by submaximal GH but not submaximal PDGF. Point mutant SH2-Bβ (R555E) and truncation mutant ΔC555, both lacking a functional SH2 domain, inhibited membrane ruffling and pinocytosis induced by GH and PDGF. Mutant ΔN504, which possesses a functional SH2 domain and enhances JAK2 kinase activity in overexpression systems, also inhibited GH-stimulated membrane ruffling. ΔN504 failed to inhibit GH-induced nuclear localization of Stat5B, indicating JAK2 is active in these cells.

GH stimulates longitudinal bone growth in part from a direct action of GH on epiphyseal prechondrocytes, inducing their differentiation into chondrocytes (1.Ohlsson C. Nilsson A. Isaksson O. Lindahl A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9826-9830Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Similarly, GH has a role in adipocyte differentiation. GH-deficient children have a reduced fat cell number, suggesting a role for GH in preadipocyte proliferation and induction of differentiation (2.Wabitsch M. Heinze E. Horm. Res. (Basel). 1993; 40: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Indeed, GH is permissive for adipocyte differentiation in tissue culture models (3.Green H. Meuth M.

Differentiation. 1985; 29: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), and GH signaling appears be required for normal fat deposition in mice (6.Teglund S. McKay C.

GH also stimulates chemotaxis of monocytes (7.Wiedermann C.J. Reinisch N. Braunsteiner H. Blood. 1993; 82: 954-960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A shared requirement for these varied actions of GH is a change in cell shape or location. The cytoskeleton is intimately involved in the regulation of cell morphology and movement (8.Cooper J.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 585-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Hence, it is logical to predict that GH regulates the cytoskeleton. Consistent with this, GH is known to stimulate actin reorganization (9.Goh E.L. Pircher T.J. Wood T.J. Norstedt G. Graichen R. Lobie P.E. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3207-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and microtubule polymerization (10.Goh E.L. Pircher T.J. Lobie P.E. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4364-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Initiation of GH signaling involves GH binding to its receptor (GHR), a member of the cytokine/hematopoietin receptor family, and activation of the Janus tyrosine kinase JAK2 (11.Argetsinger L.S.

Activated JAK2 phosphorylates multiple proteins, triggering numerous signaling cascades (12.Argetsinger L.S. Carter-Su C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1089-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing GHR, several proteins involved in cell adhesion and/or movement are phosphorylated in response to GH. For example, GH stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and formation of a multiprotein complex containing focal adhesion kinase, JAK2, p130 cas, CrkII, and others (13.Zhu T. Goh E.L. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10682-10689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 14.Zhu T. Goh E.L.K. LeRoith D. Lobie P.E. J. Biol.

Generation of membrane ruffles rich in polymerized actin is one of the earliest detectable events when cells are stimulated with growth factors and hormones such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), insulin, and GH (9.Goh E.L.

Ruffles are commonly found on the leading edge (lamella) of motile cells and are thought to be required for cell migration (17.Ridley A.J. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Ruffling may also be important for nutrient uptake, since ruffling is linked to fluid phase pinocytosis (18.Brunk U. Schellens J. Westermark B. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 103: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 19.Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R. Science. 1986; 233: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The signaling pathways involved in the generation of membrane ruffles are emerging. For PDGF and insulin-stimulated ruffling, the Rho family GTPase Rac is clearly required (20.Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10590-10594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar,33.Qian X. Riccio A. Zhang Y. Ginty D.D. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1017-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Given that neuronal differentiation requires extensive changes in cell shape and that both GH and PDGF stimulate actin reorganization, we hypothesized that SH2-Bβ might play a role in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. We show that SH2-Bβ is colocalized with filamentous actin at GH and PDGF-induced membrane ruffles. Introduction of mutant SH2-Bβs into cells inhibits membrane ruffling and pinocytosis stimulated by GH and PDGF. These findings provide evidence that SH2-B is a novel component of the signaling network involved in regulation of cell shape and movement. The stock of mouse 3T3-F442A fibroblasts were provided by H. Green (Harvard University, Cambridge, MA). Recombinant human GH was the gift of Lilly and recombinant human PDGF-BB was purchased from Invitrogen. Prestained molecular weight standards were from Life Technologies, Inc., and ECL detection reagents were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All chemicals were reagent grade or better. c-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody (9E10) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal antibody raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the C-terminal portion of SH2-Bβ has been described previously (25.Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Goat anti-mouse IgG-Oregon Green 488 and Texas Red-phalloidin were from Molecular Probes, Inc. Rabbit anti-mouse IgG-Texas Red was from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Fluorescein-conjugated bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA) was obtained from Sigma. cDNAs encoding GFP-tagged or Myc-tagged wild-type SH2-Bβ and SH2-Bβ(R555E) have been described previously (32.Rui L. Herrington J.B. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10590-10594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Construction of cDNAs encoding the tagged versions of truncation mutants ΔC555 and ΔN504 are described elsewhere (35.Rui, L., Gunter, D., Herrington, J., and Carter-Su, C. (2000) Mol. Cell. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). 3T3-F442A cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 9% calf serum. For imaging experiments, cells were plated on glass coverslips and transfected with 2.5 μg of cDNA expression vector using Lipofectamine Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) or Transfast (Promega) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Approximately 36 h after transfection, cells were incubated in serum-free medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin overnight, treated with ligands at 37 °C where appropriate, and processed for imaging as described below. Stable lines derived from PC12 cells expressing GFP-SH2-Bβ have been described previously (32.Rui L. Herrington J.B. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10590-10594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Cells were rapidly rinsed two times with PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), fixed for 15 min at 37 °C in CFA (4% paraformaldehyde, 5% polyethylene glycol 400 in intracellular buffer consisting of 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgSO4, 33 mm KC2H3O3, and 0.02% NaN3). Cells were permeabilized with CFB (1% Triton X-100, 4% paraformaldehyde, 5% polyethylene glycol 400 in intracellular buffer) for 15 min at 37 °C. Following two rinses in PBS, nonspecific sites were bound with blocking solution (2% goat serum, three 5-min incubations). Samples were incubated with α-Myc (1:200) in blocking solution for 2 h, rinsed twice with PBS, and incubated with 0.2 μg/ml goat anti-mouse IgG-Oregon Green 488 in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. For F-actin staining, samples were incubated with Texas Red-phalloidin (1:40) for 30 min at room temperature. Following staining, the coverslips were rinsed twice with PBS, mounted on slides, and imaged the same day. Confocal imaging was performed with a Noran OZ laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 60× Nikon objective. GFP and Oregon Green 488 were excited at 488 nm by a krypton-argon laser, and fluorescence at 500 ± 12 nm was captured. Texas Red-X was excited at 568 nm, and fluorescence above 590 nm was captured. For localization experiments, a 15-μm slit was used to limit the excitation light for the maximum spatial resolution achievable at 60× by the microscope. Digital images were converted to TIF files for analysis and presentation using Adobe PhotoshopTM. The images presented in thefigures are representative of at least three separate experiments. To measure the effect of SH2-Bβ on membrane ruffling, cells expressing wild-type or mutant GFP-tagged SH2-Bβ were deprived of serum overnight, treated with GH or PDGF as indicated in the figure legends, and fixed and permeabilized as described above. Filamentous actin was labeled with Texas Red-phalloidin and imaged by epifluorescence microscopy (Carl Zeiss). The number of ruffles per transfected cell was determined. Transfectional efficiency was generally low (<5%) and different between constructs, limiting the number of transfected cells that could be studied per condition in each experiment. All of the transfected cells that could be found on the coverslip were counted. Each experiment was repeated at least three times, and the data were pooled and analyzed. To confirm that SH2-Bβ localizes to membrane ruffles, we identified the localization of SH2-Bβ on GFP/Texas Red ratio images according to the method proposed by T. Howard (36.Coates T.D. Watts R.G. Hartman R. Howard T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Since the microscopic image of a fluorescently labeled cell is a two-dimensional projection of a three-dimensional object, localized variations in fluorescence intensity may be due to regional differences in cell thickness (36.Coates T.D. Watts R.G. Hartman R. Howard T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). GFP- or GFP-SH2-Bβ-expressing cells were treated with GH or PDGF or left untreated, fixed, and permeabilized as described above. Cells were labeled with 25 μg/ml Texas Red-sulfonyl chloride for 30 min as a stain for general cytoplasmic fluorescence to normalize for differences in path length. Images were captured with a cooled CCD camera (Spot-2, Diagnostic Instrumentation, Inc.) using a three-channel filter set, allowing simultaneous imaging of GFP and Texas Red fluorescence. This method protects against possible shifts during the overlay of two images obtained separately. Using Adobe PhotoshopTM, the two-color image was split into separate black-and-white images corresponding to the green and red channels. These images were thresholded to create binary masks using Metamorph software. Ratio images were obtained by dividing the green (GFP-positive) by the red (general staining) images. Parts of the cells where GFP fluorescence is concentrated, relative to cytoplasmic proteins, appear white on the ratio images. Where increased GFP fluorescence results from increased cell thickness the ratio image is gray or black. As expected, cells expressing GFP alone have black ruffles in the ratio images. Thirty-six h after transfection with cDNA encoding Myc-tagged versions of wild-type or mutant SH2-Bβ, cells were incubated overnight in serum-free medium. As a control, cells were transfected with cDNA encoding Myc-tagged Lin-7, a protein not expected to regulate the actin cytoskeleton (37.Borg J.P. Straight S.W. Kaech S.M. de Taddeo-Borg M. Kroon D.E. Karnak D. Turner R.S. Kim S.K. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31633-31636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To measure fluid phase pinocytosis, cells were incubated with 2 mg/ml FITC-BSA together with GH or PDGF for 10 min, washed, incubated in medium alone for an additional 10 min, fixed with CFA, and permeabilized with CFB. Nonspecific sites were blocked with 2% goat serum (three incubations, 5 min each). To visualize transfected cells, coverslips were incubated with α-Myc followed by rabbit α-mouse-IgG-Texas Red, mounted, and imaged as above. For quantification of FITC-BSA uptake, the number of fluorescent vesicles per transfected cell was determined. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Confluent 10-cm plates of cells were rinsed three times with ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1 mm Na3VO4, lysed, and scraped from plates in lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm EGTA, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Following sonication for 50 s, the lysates were centrifuged at 120,000 ×g for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer. The supernatant and pellet fractions were designated cytosol and membrane fractions, respectively. Samples from each fraction were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5% gels). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and detected by Western blotting using ECL with antibody to SH2-Bβ (1:15,000). Cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of cDNA encoding rat Stat5B fused to enhanced GFP (pGFP-Stat5B) (38.Herrington J. Rui L. Luo G., Yu- Lee L. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5138-5145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and 2.5 μg of cDNA encoding Myc-tagged versions of wild-type or mutant SH2-Bβ. As a control, cells were transfected with empty Myc vector and pGFP-Stat5B. Following overnight incubation in serum-free medium, cells were stimulated for 40 min with 500 ng/ml GH where appropriate, fixed, and processed for immunocytochemistry as described above using α-Myc and anti-mouse IgG-Texas Red antibodies. The nuclear-to-cytosol fluorescence intensity ratios for 20 cells/condition were calculated as reported previously (38.Herrington J. Rui L. Luo G., Yu- Lee L. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5138-5145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Data from three or four separate transfections were pooled and analyzed using one-tailed unpairedt test. When individual experiments were analyzed, the results were indistinguishable from those obtained from the pooled data. Differences were considered to be statistically significant atp < 0.05. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. We first investigated the localization of SH2-B in unstimulated 3T3-F442A fibroblasts, a highly GH-responsive cell line. Subcellular fractionation revealed that SH2-B is primarily in the membrane fraction of these cells, with a small amount present in the cytosol fraction (Fig.1 A). Since crude cellular fractionation can often be misleading, we utilized immunocytochemistry to precisely localize SH2-B within single cells. Since our SH2-B antibody does not specifically recognize SH2-B within 3T3-F442A cells by immunofluorescence procedures, 2J. Herrington and C. Carter-Su, unpublished observations. we expressed Myc-tagged SH2-Bβ in 3T3-F442A cells and performed immunocytochemistry with antibody to the Myc tag. SH2-Bβ is detected at the plasma membrane and in the cytosol of unstimulated cells (Fig.1 C, left panel). No staining with the Myc antibody was observed in untransfected cells (Fig. 1 C,right panel). Similar membrane and cytosol localization of SH2-Bβ was seen with GFP-tagged SH2-Bβ in 3T3-F442A cells, 2C4 human fibrosarcoma cells (data not shown), and PC12 cells (Fig.1 B). Thus, SH2-Bβ is present at the plasma membrane and in the cytosol of unstimulated cells. GH is known to stimulate actin reorganization in a variety of cell types (9.Goh E.L. Pircher T.J. Wood T.J. Norstedt G. Graichen R. Lobie P.E. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3207-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the mechanism of action of GH on the actin cytoskeleton. We first characterized the effect of GH on the actin cytoskeleton of 3T3-F442A cells. Subconfluent cultures of cells were deprived of serum overnight and stimulated with 500 ng/ml GH for 0–60 min. Filamentous actin was stained with Texas Red-phalloidin. Confocal imaging revealed that prior to stimulation, cells possess typical flattened fibroblast morphology with numerous actin stress fibers (Fig.2, left). GH induces a change in cell shape with the formation of broad, protrusive sheets (lamellipodia) with characteristic membrane ruffles rich in polymerized actin (Fig. 2, center, arrows). The response to GH was transient, peaking within 5–10 min and subsiding by 30–60 min, and was present in approximately 30–40% of the cells. Treatment of cells with 5 ng/ml PDGF for 5–10 min produced more extensive ruffling than GH and was present in the majority of cells (Fig. 2,right, arrows). We next examined the localization of SH2-Bβ in cells treated with GH or PDGF. Cells expressing Myc-tagged SH2-Bβ were treated with GH or PDGF for 5–10 min and processed for actin staining and immunocytochemistry against the Myc tag. Confocal imaging revealed that SH2-Bβ colocalizes with polymerized actin in membrane ruffles induced by GH or PDGF (Fig.3 A, arrows). Membrane ruffling causes an increase in the amount of membrane in the light path of the microscope as the cell lifts off the substratum, an event that can complicate interpretation of specific localization to membrane ruffles. Confocal microscopy reduces but does not completely eliminate this problem. To verify that SH2-Bβ is specifically localized at membrane ruffles, we labeled GFP- or GFP-SH2-Bβ-expressing cells with the general cytoplasmic stain Texas Red-sulfonyl chloride and imaged the cells by fluorescence microscopy. The GFP fluorescence image was divided by the Texas Red fluorescence image, effectively normalizing the GFP images to the amount of total cellular protein present (see “Experimental Procedures”). After normalization, GFP-SH2-Bβ but not GFP alone was detectable at GH-induced ruffles (Fig. 3 B, arrows). We counted the number of membrane ruffles with more GFP than Texas Red fluorescence (termed SH2-Bβ-positive ruffles). The percentage of total ruffles that were SH2-Bβ-positive is plotted in Fig.3 C. Approximately 80% of ruffles induced by either GH or PDGF have wild-type SH2-Bβ localized there. As expected, few ruffles were positive for GFP alone. To test whether SH2-Bβ participates in GH-stimulated actin reorganization, we overexpressed wild-type or mutant GFP-SH2-Bβ in cells and assayed membrane ruffling (Fig.4). Cells expressing GFP alone served as a control. Cells overexpressing SH2-Bβ exhibited more pronounced ruffling in response to GH compared with GFP-expressing cells (Fig.4 B). To examine if SH2-Bβ is required for GH-induced membrane ruffling, we tested if mutant forms of SH2-Bβ might act as dominant negatives. Two mutants were assayed: the point mutant SH2-Bβ(R555E), in which the Arg within the FLVR motif of the SH2 domain critical for binding to phosphotyrosine is replaced by Glu, and truncation mutant ΔC555, which lacks a functional SH2 domain (Fig.4 A). Both mutants fail to associate with JAK2 with high affinity and to serve as substrates for JAK2 (35.Rui, L., Gunter, D., Herrington, J., and Carter-Su, C. (2000) Mol. Cell. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar, 39.Rui L. Carter-Su C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7172-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Both GFP-tagged SH2-Bβ(R555E) and GFP-tagged ΔC555 inhibited membrane ruffling induced by GH (Fig. 4 B). Hence these mutants are effective dominant negative proteins and provide further evidence for a requirement of SH2-Bβ in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton by GH. To better visualize the actions of SH2-Bβ on GH-dependent membrane ruffling, we captured lower magnification images to include both transfected cells and untransfected cells (as judged by GFP fluorescence) within the same field (Fig. 4 C). As shown in Fig. 4 C, left panel, the cell expressing GFP-SH2-Bβ has pronounced membrane ruffling in response to 50 ng/ml GH, whereas the untransfected cell in the same field does not. In contrast, the cell expressing GFP-tagged SH2-Bβ(R555E) in Fig.4 C, right panel, lacks membrane ruffles when treated with 500 ng/ml GH, whereas the adjacent untransfected cell has a large ruffle. To quantify the dominant negative activity of mutant SH2-Bβ, we expressed GFP, wild type GFP-SH2-Bβ, or mutant GFP-SH2-Bβ in cells, treated with GH or PDGF, and counted the number of ruffles per cell. GFP-tagged SH2-Bβ(R555E) and ΔC555 inhibited ruffling at all concentrations tested (25–500 ng/ml, Figs. 4 B and5 A). Overexpression of wild-type GFP-SH2-Bβ increased the number of ruffles per cell compared with cells expressing GFP alone at a submaximal concentration of GH (25 ng/ml; Fig. 5 A) (GFP-SH2-Bβ, 2.0 ± 0.5 (n = 37); GFP, 1.2 ± 0.2 (n = 44)). Interestingly, the involvement of SH2-Bβ in PDGF-induced ruffling appears subtler, since GFP-tagged SH2-Bβ(R555E) and ΔC555 inhibition of PDGF-induced ruffling were most prominent at low concentrations of PDGF (Fig. 5 B). Also, overexpression of SH2-Bβ did not enhance PDGF-induced ruffling when compared with cells expressing GFP alone (Fig. 5 B) (GFP-SH2-Bβ, 1.2 ± 0.2 (n = 95); GFP, 1.4 ± 0.2 (n = 88)). Membrane ruffling is closely associated with pinocytotic activity (18.Brunk U. Schellens J. Westermark B. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 103: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 19.Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R. Science. 1986; 233: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). To test if SH2-Bβ has a role in fluid phase macropinocytosis, we monitored the uptake of FITC-BSA by cells expressing Myc-tagged wild-type or mutant SH2-Bβ (Fig. 6). Myc-tagged Lin-7, a protein not expected to influence ruffling or pinocytosis, served as a control. In unstimulated cells, pinocytotic activity was very low (<5 vesicles/cell; data not shown). To trigger pinocytosis, GH or PDGF was added to the medium containing FITC-BSA. Fifty ng/ml GH, a concentration that produces strong ruffling (Fig.5 A), produced 17.0 ± 1.0 (n = 44) intracellular vesicles containing FITC-BSA per cell in cells expressing Lin and 17.4 ± 0.7 (n = 88) vesicles per cell in cells expressing SH2-Bβ, indicating a high rate of ongoing pinocytosis (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, the number of GH-induced pinosomes per cell in cells expressing mutant SH2-Bβ was lower by 65–75% (ΔC555, 4.5 ± 0.4 (n = 68); SH2-Bβ(R555E), 6.3 ± 1.0 (n = 86)). At a concentration of GH that produces a relatively small amount of ruffling (25 ng/ml GH), 8.0 ± 0.8 (n = 18) vesicles per cell were present in cells expressing the control Lin p"

Here, we identified a DNase in Drosophila Schneider cells that can be activated by caspase 3, and purified it as a complex of two subunits (p32 and p20). Using primers based on the amino acid sequence of the purified proteins, a cDNA coding for Drosophila CAD (dCAD) was cloned. The polypeptide encoded by the cDNA contained 450 amino acids with a calculated M r of 52,057, and showed significant homology with human and mouse CAD (22% identity). Mammalian CADs carry a nuclear localization signal at the C terminus. In contrast, dCAD lacked the corresponding sequence, and the purified dCAD did not cause DNA fragmentation in nuclei in a cell-free system. When dCAD was co-expressed in COS cells with Drosophilainhibitor of CAD (dICAD), a 52-kDa dCAD was produced as a heterotetrameric complex with dICAD. When the complex was treated with human caspase 3 or Drosophila caspase (drICE), the dICAD was cleaved, and released from dCAD. In addition, dCAD was also cleaved by these caspases, and behaved as a (p32)2(p20)2 complex in gel filtration. When aDrosophila neuronal cell line was induced to apoptosis by treatment with a kinase inhibitor, both dCAD and dICAD were cleaved. These results indicated that unlike mammalian CAD,Drosophila CAD must be cleaved by caspases to be activated.

This process is triggered by the transcriptional activation of genes involved in apoptosis, cytotoxic cells, anti-cancer drugs, and death factors (3.Green D.R. Reed J.C.

Studies in Caenorhabditis elegans have identified several gene products that regulate programmed cell death (6.Ellis R.E. Yuan J. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 663-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar). Ced-3 (cell-death abnormal) andCed-4 are required for cell death (7.Ellis H.M. Horvitz H. Cell. 1986; 44: 817-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). Ced-9blocks the action of Ced-4 and Ced-3 to inhibit the process (8.Hengartner M.O. Ellis R.E. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), while Egl-1 (egg laying defective) inhibits the anti-apoptotic function of Ced-9, thus promoting the cell death process (9.Conradt B. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Mammalian homologues for Ced-3 and Ced-4 have been identified as caspases (cysteine proteases) (10.Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6151) Google Scholar) and Apaf-1 (11.Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2739) Google Scholar), respectively. The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are mammalian homologues of Ced-9, while pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members such as Bid and Bad, which carry only the BH3 domain, are homologues of Egl-1 (12.Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4802) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the central molecular components required for apoptosis are well conserved among different species. At least 13 caspase family members have been identified in mammals, and these can be divided into three groups (10.Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6151) Google Scholar, 13.Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2180) Google Scholar). Caspases in the first group are mainly involved in the production of cytokines, whereas caspases in the second and third groups play a direct role in apoptosis. Among the caspases involved in apoptosis, caspases 8, 9, and 10 carry a long prodomain at the N terminus, and are activated by oligomerization at the plasma membrane or by apoptosomes at mitochondria, and thus function as initiator elements. Caspases 3, 6, and 7 carry a short prodomain, are activated by the initiator caspases, and are responsible for cleaving at least 60 death-related substrates (14.Stroh C. Schulze-Osthoff K. Cell Death Diff. 1998; 5: 997-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The cleavage of these substrates is assumed to bring about the morphological changes of cells and nuclei that characterize apoptosis. Developmental programmed cell death plays an important role in embryogenesis, morphogenesis, and oogenesis in insects. InDrosophila, it begins at stage 11–12 of embryogenesis and becomes widespread in many tissues (15.Abrams J.M. White K. Fessler L.I. Steller H. Development. 1993; 117: 29-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Jiang C. Baehrecke E.H. Thummel C.S. Development. 1997; 124: 4673-4683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deleterious stimuli such as γ-irradiation also induce apoptosis in Drosophilaembryos (17.Nordstrom W. Chen P. Steller H. Abrams J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 213-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Apoptosis in Drosophila is triggered by the expression of a set of genes: reaper, grim, andhead involution defective (hid), which are tightly linked at the H99 region of the third chromosome (18.Bergmann A. Agapite J. Steller H. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3215-3223Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). As found in C. elegans and mammals, the apoptotic process inDrosophila is mediated by caspase-like proteases (19.Fraser A.G. McCarthy N.J. Evan G.I.

We and others have identified a DNase in humans and mice (caspase-activated DNase, CAD) that can be activated by human caspase 3 (27.Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S.

CAD1 is complexed with its inhibitor protein (inhibitor of CAD, ICAD, also called DNA fragmentation factor-45) in growing cells (27.Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar, 30.Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar). When apoptotic stimuli activate caspase 3, it then cleaves ICAD at two positions, causing ICAD to lose its ability to bind CAD (31.Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar). CAD, thus released from ICAD, cleaves the chromosomal DNA in the nucleus. To examine whether this mechanism of apoptotic DNA fragmentation is conserved among different species, and to study its role in developmental programmed cell death, we sought to identify CAD and ICAD inDrosophila cells. In this report, we identified aDrosophila CAD (dCAD) in Drosophila cells. The purification and molecular cloning of dCAD revealed a novel activation mechanism for dCAD. Drosophila Schneider's line 2 (S2) (ATCC CRL 1963) cells were grown at 25 °C in Schneider's insect medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). A Drosophila neuronal cell line, ML-DmBG2-c2 (BG2-c2) was provided by Dr. Y. Miyata (Department of Pharmacology, Nippon Medical School), and was cultured in Shields and Sang M3 Insect medium (Sigma) supplemented by 10% fetal calf serum and 10 μg/ml insulin as described (32.Nagano M. Suzuki H. Ui-Tei K. Sato S. Miyake T. Miyata Y. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 31: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Monkey COS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Mouse ICAD (GST-mICAD), as a fusion protein with glutathioneS-transferase (GST), and human caspase 3 were prepared inEscherichia coli as described (27.Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar). An expression plasmid for histidine-tagged drICE was provided by Dr. S. Kumar (Hanson Center for Cancer Research, Adelaide, Australia). Recombinant drICE was produced in E. coli BL21 (DE3), and partially purified on a nickel-chelating column. The mouse ICAD·CAD complex was produced in Sf9 cells, and purified as described (33.Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15740-15744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Nuclei were prepared from mouse liver or S2 cells as described (27.Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar). Biotinylated Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-chloromethylketone (bio-DEVD-cmk) and acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde (Ac-DEVD-cho) were from the Peptide Institute. 1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7) was purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The dCAD activity was determined by assaying its DNase activity. In brief, samples were incubated at 4 °C overnight and 30 °C for 2 h with 1 μg of plasmid DNA in 20 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2 5 mm EGTA, and 10% glycerol) containing 5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 67 ng of human caspase 3. After incubation, DNA was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel. -All packed columns used for protein purification were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. S2 cells (1.3 × 1011 cells) were suspended in buffer B (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm p-(amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were disrupted by freezing and thawing as described previously (27.Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar). The homogenate was spun at 30,000 × g for 30 min and 100,000 × g for 2 h. The S-100 fraction (1,375 mg) was applied to a 20-ml DEAE-Sepharose FF column that was equilibrated with buffer C (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 20% glycerol, 0.15% CHAPS, 0.1 mm p-(amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mmNaCl), and eluted with a 50–350 mm linear NaCl gradient. The active fractions were pooled and passed through a 2-ml HiTrap Blue-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer C containing 150 mm NaCl. After concentration using a Centriprep 10 (Amicon), the sample was applied to a Hiload 26/60 Superdex 200-pg column equilibrated with buffer C. Human caspase 3 (384 μg) was added to the pooled active fractions and the samples were incubated at 4 °C overnight. The samples were then incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with 5 μm bio-DEVD-cmk, followed by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min with 11.5 μg of GST-mICAD. Glutathione-Sepharose (300-μl bed volume) was added to the mixture, which was then rocked at 4 °C overnight. After washing with buffer A containing 0.02% Tween 20, proteins were eluted from the beads with 20 mmglutathione in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.6, containing 0.02% Tween 20, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol (buffer D). Purified dCAD was subjected to electrophoresis on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (Applied Biosystems) membrane using a semi-dry transfer method. After staining with Ponceau S, proteins (about 19 pmol for p32, and 5 pmol for p20) were reduced,S-carboxymethylated, and digested withAchromobacter protease I and endoproteinase Asp-N as described (34.Iwamatsu A. Electrophoresis. 1992; 13: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Peptides released from the membrane were fractionated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography with a Wakosil-II AR C18 300A column (Wako Pure Chemical), and sequenced using a protein sequencer (model PPSQ-23, Shimadzu). Two oligonucleotides (5′-AATTCCCTGGAAATGCTGATA-3′ and 5′-GAAGTTTCGATACCTGCTCA-3′) were designed from an EST clone (GenBank accession number: HL03573.5) that encodes one of the peptide sequences of the purified dCAD (Fig. 3). A cDNA (544 base pairs) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from a Drosophila cDNA library (CLONTECH), labeled with 32P, and used as a probe. The screening of 1 × 106 clones from aDrosophila embryo cDNA library (provided by Dr. T. Uemura, Kyoto University) by plaque hybridization yielded three positive clones. One of the clones carried the 5′ portion of dCAD, but lacked the 3′ portion. To obtain the 3′ part of dCAD cDNA, a 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends procedure was carried out with mRNA from S2 cells using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). The sense primers for the first and second PCR were 5′-AGGTGTCCGACGATGAGTAC-3′ and 5′-GATAAACTCTGTGCTGG-3′, at nucleotide positions 287–306 and 711–727, respectively. The longest cDNA (about 1.4 kilobases) contained a termination codon and poly(A) stretch. The full-length coding sequence for dCAD was then amplified by reverse transcription PCR from S2 mRNA, and inserted into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) to generate pGEM-dCAD. The DNA sequence was determined using a PRIZM310 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The coding sequence of dCAD starting from the first (Met-1 for dCAD/L) or third methionine codon (Met-47 for dCAD/S) was tagged with the influenza hemagglutinin A epitope at the C terminus, and introduced into the pEF-BOS-EX vector (35.Murai K. Murakami H. Nagata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3461-3466Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) to generate pEF-dCAD/L or pEF-dCAD/S. A caspase non-cleavable mutant (D278E) dCAD was constructed by PCR. In brief, a 50-mer oligonucleotide of nucleotides 802–849 carrying the mutation, and a 26-mer oligonucleotide of nucleotides 1339–1356 were used as sense and antisense primers for PCR with pGEM-dCAD/L as a template. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and inserted into the corresponding position of pEF-dCAD/L. The wild-type and mutant (D119E) dICAD cDNAs will be described elsewhere. These cDNAs were tagged with a FLAG epitope at the N terminus, and ligated with the pEF-BOS-EX vector to generate pEF-dICAD and pEF-dICADm, respectively. COS cells were transfected with plasmid DNA by electroporation. After culturing at 37 °C for 48 h, cells were suspended in buffer B, disrupted by repeated freezing and thawing, and spun to remove cell debris. Rabbit antibodies against dCAD (anti-J176 and anti-J173 antibodies) were custom-prepared at the Peptide Institute. In brief, two peptides, TGGEERFHSKEEA (J-176, amino acids 188–200) and KNLKLVHIVCHEK (J-173, amino acids 403–415), with an extra cysteine residue at the N terminus, were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin withm-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Pierce), and used to immunize rabbits. The antibodies were affinity purified from the serum using AF amino-Toyopearl beads (Tosoh Co) to which the respective peptides had been attached. Rabbit antibody against dICAD will be described elsewhere. For Western blotting analysis, proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a 10–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After incubation at room temperature for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% skim milk and 0.05% Tween 20 (PBSDT), the membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 500-fold diluted anti-J176, 100-fold diluted anti-J173, or 2000-fold diluted anti-dICAD antibody in PBSDT. The membrane was then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 3000-fold diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Transduction Laboratories), and the proteins recognized by the antibody were visualized by a chemiluminescence reaction (Renaissance; NEN Life Science Products Inc.). CAD is defined as a DNase that can be activated by caspase (27.Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar). To identifyDrosophila CAD, the cytosolic fraction (S-100) from S2 cells was treated with caspase 3, and its DNase activity was examined. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the S-100 fraction from S2 cells had little DNase activity without caspase treatment. However, when treated with caspase, it showed distinct DNase activity in a dose-dependent manner, indicating thatDrosophila cells contain CAD. Human and mouse CADs DNase activity is inhibited by its specific inhibitor, ICAD. The DNase activity in S2 cells could also be inhibited by mouse ICAD (Fig.1 B). We recently found that DREP-1, a gene identified in theDrosophila EST data base as a cDNA related to ICAD/DFF-45 (38.Walker N.P. Talanian R.V. Brady K.D. Dang L.C. Bump N.J. Ferenz C.R. Franklin S.

Tracey D.E. Kamen R. Wong W.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 343-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), in fact codes for DrosophilaICAD. 2N. Mukae, H. Yokoyama, and S. Nagata, manuscript in preparation. Accordingly, the DNase activity of S2 cells could be inhibited by recombinant DREP-1/dICAD. Human and mouse CADs have not only DNase activity, but also DNA fragmentation activity with intact nuclei as targets. In contrast, the caspase 3-treated cytosolic fraction from S2 cells did not cause DNA fragmentation in nuclei (data not shown, see below). The proform of dCAD was partially purified by DEAE-Sepharose, Blue-Sepharose, and gel filtration, by following DNase activity after caspase 3 treatment. The partially purified CAD was then treated with caspase 3, and the active CAD was bound to the GST-mICAD. The dCAD·GST-mICAD complex was bound to glutathione-Sepharose, and eluted with a high concentration of glutathione. As shown in Fig.2 A, the eluates showed very strong DNase activity following caspase 3 treatment. When proteins in the eluates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, distinct bands were visualized by silver staining (Fig. 2 B). A control experiment with biotin-labeled partially purified dCAD indicated that proteins of 32 and 20 kDa were derived from the dCAD preparation (data not shown). Proteins of 64 and 42 kDa probably represent GST-mICAD and its derivative. The 32- and 20-kDa proteins were subjected to peptide sequence analysis, and sequences of four peptides from p32, and one from p20 were obtained. The sequences of the peptides from p32 matched a sequence from the Drosophila EST data base (clone HL03573.5). This cDNA was amplified from S2 cDNA by PCR, and used to isolate the full-length cDNA from aDrosophila embryo cDNA library. The full-length cDNA contained an open reading frame for 450 amino acids, which was preceded by an in-frame termination codon. The open reading frame contained the peptide sequences derived from p32 and p20 (Fig.3 A), indicating that dCAD is synthesized as a precursor protein, and is processed into p32 and p20 subunits. There were three potential translation initiation codons (Met-1, Met-10, and Met-48) in the N-terminal domain of dCAD. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of dCAD with those of mCAD and hCAD (Fig.3 B) indicated that dCAD is about 50 amino acids longer at the N terminus, suggesting that Met-48 may be the initiation codon. The overall identity between dCAD and mCAD and between dCAD and hCAD were 21.8 and 22.0%, respectively. The region of amino acids 308–415 in the 20-kDa subunit was highly homologous to the corresponding region of mCAD and hCAD (41.7% identity). In particular, five cysteine and four histidine residues in this region were conserved among dCAD, mCAD, and hCAD. In contrast to mCAD and hCAD, dCAD did not contain a stretch of basic amino acids at the C terminus (Fig. 3 B). When the C-terminal stretch of the basic amino acids was deleted from mouse CAD, its nuclear DNA fragmentation activity was destroyed, although its DNase activity was not affected. 3M. Enari and S. Nagata, unpublished observation.The lack of this stretch in dCAD suggests that dCAD might not have the nuclear DNA fragmentation activity. To examine this possibility, dCAD and mCADs DNase and nuclear DNA fragmentation activities were compared. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the purified dCAD had DNase activity, with a specific activity comparable to that of mCAD. On the other hand, the same preparation of dCAD did not cause DNA fragmentation in intact Drosophila nuclei, whereas, mCAD showed DNA fragmentation activity inDrosophila nuclei as well as in mouse nuclei. These results indicated that dCAD, unlike mCAD, cannot enter nuclei on its own. To confirm that the dCAD cDNA coded for an active DNase, the cDNA was introduced into monkey COS cells, and the DNase activity in the cell lysates was determined. As with human and mouse CAD, expression of dCAD cDNA alone in COS cells did not produce DNase activity (Fig.5 A). However, when COS cells were co-transfected with dCAD and DREP-1/dICAD, a large amount of DNase activity was detected in the cell lysates after treatment with caspase 3. A similar amount of DNase activity was detected with either the full-length cDNA or with the cDNA lacking the first 48 amino acids, suggesting that the N-terminal 48 amino acids of dCAD is dispensable for the DNase activity. The DNase activity in the COS cell lysates was dose-dependent (Fig. 5 B), and was lower than that observed in COS cells transfected with mCAD and mICAD expression plasmids. The purified dCAD consisted of two subunits (p32 and p20), while the dCAD cDNA encoded a single 52-kDa protein. Since the dCAD preparation was treated with caspase 3 during the purification step, it seemed possible that dCAD was cleaved by caspase 3. To examine this possibility, two anti-peptide antibodies (anti-J176 and anti-J173) recognizing the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of dCAD were produced. Western blotting analysis of the lysates from the dCAD and dICAD-transfected COS cells gave a band of 52 kDa with either anti-J176 or -J173 (Fig. 6 A). When the lysates were treated with caspase 3, the anti-J176 and J173 antibodies detected bands of 32 and 20 kDa, respectively. The partially purified native dCAD (i.e. after gel filtration) showed a band of 52 kDa with both antibodies, whereas the purified dCAD (i.e.the eluate from the GST-mICAD affinity column) gave bands of 32 and 20 kDa with the anti-J173 and -J176 antibody, respectively. These results indicated that the primary 52-kDa dCAD is cleaved by caspase 3 to generate p32 and p20. An inspection of the dCAD amino acid sequence indicated that a tetrapeptide of Glu-Glu-Thr-Asp (EETD) at amino acids 275–278 is a potential recognition site for caspase 3 (13.Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2180) Google Scholar). To examine whether dCAD is cleaved by the caspase at this site, Asp-278 was changed to Glu. Transfection of COS cells with the expression plasmids for the dCAD D278E mutant and DREP-1/dICAD produced the 52-kDa dCAD protein (Fig.7 A). However, this protein was not cleaved by caspase 3, confirming that caspase 3 cleaves dCAD at Asp-278. We recently found that caspase 3 cleaves DREP-1/dICAD at Asp-119 to destroy its ability to inhibit the dCADs DNase. Accordingly, the wild-type dICAD (apparent molecular mass of 46 kDa) expressed in COS cells was cleaved to proteins of approximately 26 kDa, and the dICAD D119E mutant was not cleaved by caspase 3. We then assayed the DNase activity in the COS cell lysates transfected with the wild-type and mutant forms of dCAD and dICAD. As shown in Fig. 7 B, the lysates containing the caspase-cleavable dCAD and dICAD showed DNase activity after treatment with caspase 3. On the other hand, no DNase activity was observed if caspase 3 could not cleave either dCAD or dICAD. These results indicated that both dCAD and dICAD must be cleaved by caspase 3 to generate the active DNase. The above results indicated that functional dCAD is synthesized in COS cells only when it is co-expressed with DREP-1/dICAD, and that both DREP-1/dICAD and dCAD must be cleaved by caspases to generate the functional DNase. To examine the molecular events behind this phenomenon, COS cells were transfected with the expression plasmids for wild-type dCAD and DREP-1/dICAD. The proform of dCAD in lysates was partially purified by a DEAE-Sepharose column, and analyzed by gel filtration. As shown in Fig. 8 A, the proform of dCAD, the DNase activity of which was seen only after treatment with caspase 3, was eluted at an apparent mass of 145 kDa. The active fractions (fractions 24–26) contained the dCAD of 52 kDa, and the DREP-1/dICAD of 32 kDa, as revealed by Western blotting with anti-dCAD and dICAD antibodies, respectively. A second peak of DREP-1/dICAD eluted at an apparent molecular mass of 70 kDa, which represents the free form of DREP-1/dICAD. These results indicated that the proform of dCAD is a tetrameric complex consisting of (dCAD)2(dICAD)2. On the other hand, when the sample was analyzed by gel filtration after treatment with caspase 3, the DNase activity was detected without the caspase treatment at the position corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 105 kDa. Western blotting analysis showed that the active fractions (fractions 26–30) contained the cleaved subunits of dCAD (p32 and p20). The cleaved dICAD fragments (p19 and p13) eluted separately after the fractions for dCAD. These results indicated that active dCAD is a tetramer consisting of (p32)2(p20)2 of dCAD, and is free from DREP-1/dICAD. Similar structures, (dCAD)2(dICAD)2 for the proform"

The presence of FVIII and FX increases 5-fold the affinity of FIXa for the surface of activated platelets, and the presence of FVIII or FVIIIa generates a high affinity, low capacity specific FX-binding site on activated platelets. We have now examined the effects of FX and active site-inhibited FIXa (EGR-FIXa) on the binding of both FVIII and FVIIIa to activated platelets and show the following: (a) von Willebrand factor inhibits FVIII binding (K i = 0.54 nm) but not FVIIIa binding; (b) thrombin and the thrombin receptor activation peptide (SFLLRN amide) are the most potent agonists required for FVIII-binding site expression, whereas ADP is inert; (c) FVa does not compete with FVIIIa or FVIII for functional platelet-binding sites; and (d) Annexin V is a potent inhibitor of FVIIIa binding (IC50 = 10 nm) to activated platelets. The A2 domain of FVIII significantly increases the affinity and stoichiometry of FVIIIa binding to platelets and contributes to the stability of the FX-activating complex. Both FVIII and FVIIIa binding were specific, saturable, and reversible. FVIII binds to specific, high affinity receptors on activated platelets (n = 484 ± 59;K d = 3.7 ± 0.31 nm) and FVIIIa interacts with an additional 300–500 sites per platelet with enhanced affinity (K d = 1.5 ± 0.11 nm). FVIIIa binding to activated platelets in the presence of FIXa and FX is closely coupled with rates of F-X activation.

FVIII is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain containing 2,351 amino acids (1.Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and shows a discrete domain structure, A1-a1-A2-a2-B-a3-A3-C1-C2; the domains are separated by short spacers (a1, a2, and a3) composed of acidic regions that contain clusters of Asp and Glu residues (2.Lenting P.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. Blood. 1998; 92: 3983-3996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The A domains display ∼30% homology to each other, and they also share sequence homology with ceruloplasmin and FV. The B domain is unique to FVIII. The C domains share homology with FV and discoidin 1, a lectin (1.Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During proteolytic activation of pro-cofactor (FVIII), the B domain that does not contribute to cofactor function is excised. The heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) remain noncovalently associated through the A1 and A3 domains in a metal ion-dependent manner and participate as an active cofactor in tenase complex formation (1.Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following terminology, suggested by Lenting et al. (2.Lenting P.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. Blood. 1998; 92: 3983-3996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), for FVIII subunits was used: A1 = HC-derived fragment containing residues 1–372; A2 = HC-derived fragment containing residues 373–740; A1-A2 = HC subunit of FVIII containing residues 1–740 (without the B domain); B = HC subunit residues 741–1648; LC = LC of FVIII; A3-C1-C2 = LC-derived fragment arising from the cleavage at position 1689. Thrombin cleaves FVIII at one specific site within the LC, Arg1689, and at two sites in the HC, Arg372and Arg750, resulting in a heterodimer of 50 kDa (A1 domain), 43 kDa (A2 domain), and 73 kDa (A3-C1-C2 dimer); all of these subunits are required for the procoagulant activity (3.Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More specifically, the cleavages at Arg372 and Arg1689 are required to exert full cofactor activity (4.Donath M.S. Lenting P.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3648-3655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,5.Regan L.M. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8546-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), whereas cleavage of the LC at Arg1689 is also responsible for dissociation of FVIII from von Willebrand factor (vWF) (6.Saenko E.L. Scandella D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18007-18014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). FVIII in the circulation forms a tight, noncovalent complex with vWF, and both the amino-terminal and the carboxyl-terminal regions of FVIII are involved in this interaction (6.Saenko E.L. Scandella D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18007-18014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 7.Vlot A.J. Koppelman S.J. van den Berg M.H. Bouma B.N. Sixma J.J. Blood. 1995; 85: 3150-3157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of the FVIII-vWF complex is essential for the survival of FVIII in the circulation. Another functional consequence of FVIII-vWF complex formation is to prevent binding of FVIII to components of the FX-activating complex,e.g. the binding of FVIII LC to FIXa has been shown to be inhibited by vWF (8.Lenting P.J. Donath M.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, FVIII-vWF complex is less susceptible to proteolytic degradation by proteases like activated protein C (9.Fay P.J. Walker F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 994: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and FXa (10.Koedam J.A. Hamer R.J. Beeser-Visser N.H. Bouma B.N. Sixma J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). vWF also prevents FVIII binding to phospholipids (11.Fay P.J. Coumans J.V. Walker F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2172-2177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and platelets (12.Nesheim M. Pittman D.D. Giles A.R. Fass D.N. Wang J.H. Slonosky D. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17815-17820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, vWF does not protect FVIII from thrombin cleavage (13.Hill-Eubanks D.C. Parker C.G. Lollar P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6508-6512Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14.Esmon C.T. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13882-13887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown (15.Duffy E.J. Parker E.T. Mutucumarana V.P. Johnson A.E. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17006-17011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that FIXa displays similar affinity for pro-cofactor (FVIII) and active cofactor (FVIIIa), but as mentioned above, the FIXa-binding site is not accessible when FVIII is in complex with vWF (8.Lenting P.J. Donath M.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This clearly indicates that there is a delicate balance between FVIII binding in complex with vWF and FVIII binding to membrane surfaces. However, proteolytic activation of FVIII to FVIIIa causes a dramatic decrease (1,600-fold) in affinity for vWF (6.Saenko E.L. Scandella D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18007-18014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), thus shifting the balance toward FVIIIa binding to the membrane surface. This phenomenon has recently been studied by using electrophoretic quasi-elastic light scattering, which demonstrated the physical exchange of FVIII between vWF and activated platelets (16.Li X. Gabriel D.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10760-10767Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our laboratory provided the first evidence that platelets have an essential role in the activation of FX by the intrinsic pathway (17.Walsh P.N. Biggs R. Br. J. Haematol. 1972; 22: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar,18.Walsh P.N. Br. J. Haematol. 1978; 40: 311-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies (19.Rosing J. van Rijn J.L. Bevers E.M. van Dieijen G. Comfurius P. Zwaal R.F. Blood. 1985; 65: 319-332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that the contribution of platelets to F-X activation by FIXa in the presence of activated FVIII requires stimulation of platelets by specific agonists such as collagen, thrombin, the calcium ionophore (A23187), or a combination of thrombin and collagen. Differences in the ability of specific platelet agonists to promote binding of the components of FX-activating complex (FIXa, FX, and FVIII) are not fully understood or worked out; although it is clear that only activated platelet membranes provide a procoagulant surface for the assembly and expression of a variety of coagulation protease complexes (20.Ahmad S.S. Walsh P.N. Trends Cardiovas. Med. 1994; 4: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Recent studies from our laboratory and others are focused on the molecular mechanisms involved in the assembly of the intrinsic F-X-activating complex on platelet membranes, showing that optimal rates of F-X activation require occupancy of receptors for FIXa (21.Ahmad S.S. Rawala-Sheikh R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20012-20016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), FVIII (12.Nesheim M. Pittman D.D. Giles A.R. Fass D.N. Wang J.H. Slonosky D. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17815-17820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Nesheim M.E. Pittman D.D. Wang J.H. Slonosky D. Giles A.R. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16467-16470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and FX (23.Scandura J.M. Ahmad S.S. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 36: 8890-8902Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The presence of cofactor (FVIIIa) and substrate (FX) increases 5-fold the affinity of FIXa (active site-inhibited Glu-Gly-Arg-FIXa, i.e. EGR-FIXa) for the surface of activated platelets (21.Ahmad S.S. Rawala-Sheikh R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20012-20016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we have reported that the presence of FVIIIa generates a high affinity, low capacity specific FX-binding site on activated platelets (24.Scandura J.M. Ahmad S.S. Walsh P.N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 73: 1214Google Scholar). In this study we have demonstrated that both pro-cofactor (FVIII) and active cofactor (FVIIIa) bind to platelets with enhanced affinity in the presence of the enzyme (EGR-FIXa) and the substrate (FX), thus emphasizing the validity of a three-receptor complex on the platelet surface (20.Ahmad S.S. Walsh P.N. Trends Cardiovas. Med. 1994; 4: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In order to be more specific about the location and stability of FVIII-interactive site on platelet membranes, we have studied the effect of isolated subunits of FVIII on the binding of FVIIIa to activated platelets. Recent studies indicate that it is the spontaneous dissociation of A2 domain from the metal-linked A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer that causes FVIIIa activity to be unstable (for recent reviews, see Refs. 2.Lenting P.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. Blood. 1998; 92: 3983-3996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 25.Fay P.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our results clearly show that the presence of the A2 domain increases the affinity and stoichiometry of FVIIIa binding. These studies support a model in which the A2 subunit of FVIIIa contributes to the catalysis and stability of the F-X-activating complex both in vitro (26.Fay P. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and in vivo (27.Pipe S.W. Eickhorst A.N. McKinley S.H. Saenko E.L. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1999; 93: 176-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, our studies further emphasize that F-X activation is a platelet receptor-mediated process tightly coupled to receptor occupancy by FIXa, FVIIIa, and FX. Phenalanyl-prolyl-arginine chloromethyl ketone (PPACK) and calcium ionophore A23187 were from Calbiochem. Prostaglandin E1 and apyrase were from Sigma. All other reagents were of analytical quality. Human FIX, FX, vWF, and prothrombin were purchased from both Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc. (South Bend, IN) and Hematologic Technologies, Inc. Other highly purified human coagulation factors (vWF, FIXaβ, RVV-X, and antithrombin III) were from Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc. Human α-thrombin (4,165 units/mg) was purchased from Sigma. Highly purified recombinant FVIII (rFVIII, >4,000 units/mg) was the generous gift of Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA) and Baxter Health Care Corp. (Duarte, CA). Human prothrombin fragment 1 was liberally supplied by Dr. S. Krishnaswamy (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia) and human placenta annexin V (28.Funakoshi T. Hendrickson L.E. McMullen B.A. Fujikawa K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8087-8092Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) was given to us by Dr. Kazuo Fujikawa (University of Washington, Seattle). The murine monoclonal antibody, R8B12, which reacts with the carboxyl-terminal region of FVIII A2 domain (3.Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was obtained from Dr. Philip J. Fay of the University of Rochester School of Medicine, Rochester, NY. All proteins were >95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE (29.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar) and protein staining by Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For binding assays,125I-labeled FIX was prepared by the IODO-GEN method (30.Tuszynski G.P. Knight L. Piperno J.R. Walsh P.N. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and had a specific radioactivity of ∼2.5 × 106cpm/μg. Human FX was radioiodinated via lactoperoxidase (23.Scandura J.M. Ahmad S.S. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 36: 8890-8902Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Attempts were made to label FVIII by various procedures: IODO-GEN (30.Tuszynski G.P. Knight L. Piperno J.R. Walsh P.N. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), IODO-BEADS (31.Gilbert G.E. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. Furie B. Furie B.C. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17261-17268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), transfer technique (32.Bloom J.W. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4419-4425Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), lactoperoxidase (33.Tracy P.B. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 329-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), Enzymobeads (34.Ortel T.L. Devore-Carter D. Quinn-Allen M. Kane W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4189-4198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and NHS-[3H]propionate (35.Foster P.A. Fulcher C.A. Houghten R.A. Zimmerman T.S. Blood. 1990; 75: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, we had success in developing a highly reproducible method utilizing the Bolton-Hunter reagent (36.Bolton A.E. Hunter W.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2395) Google Scholar) to radiolabel FVIII to high specific radioactivity while retaining virtually 100% of its specific biological activity. In this procedure, 20–50 μg of rFVIII was precipitated with 25% PEG 8000, washed, and then resuspended in 50 μl of 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm HEPPS, pH 8.0, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Tween 80 just before use. The protein was then added to a siliconized glass vial containing 0.25–0.5 mCi of iodinated Bolton-Hunter reagent that had been previously dried onto the surface. The mixture was incubated for 45 min at 0 °C and then quenched by the addition of 5 μl of 0.2 m glycine, 0.1 m borate, pH 8.5, followed by further incubation for 45 min at 0 °C. The quenched reaction mixture was then precipitated with 25% PEG 8000, and the supernatant containing most of the unbound reagent was discarded. An aliquot was removed just before precipitation to determine percent incorporation (20–30%) by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. It was often necessary to precipitate the labeled protein more than once to remove the noncovalently associated reagent. Percent incorporation and percent bound radioactivity were determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The concentration of rFVIII protein was either determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (if bovine serum albumin was added as a carrier) or a BCA protein assay if there were no other proteins present. Usually 85–95% of the original protein was recovered after labeling. Finally, the functional activity of the labeled rFVIII was compared with unbound rFVIII in order to determine whether the protein was damaged during the radiolabeling procedure. We developed a chromogenic assay based on the modification of an assay developed by Wagenvoord et al. (37.Wagenvoord R.J. Hendrix H.H. Hamker H.C. Haemostasis. 1989; 19: 196-204PubMed Google Scholar) that depends on the ability of FVIII to enhance the catalytic efficiency of surface-bound FIXa in F-X activation. In this assay the concentration of FVIII is the limiting factor in activation of FX by FIXa in the presence of phospholipid vesicles and calcium ions. The velocity of FXa generation is determined from the rate of the cleavage of FXa-sensitive chromogenic substrate. Briefly, three reagents were prepared in assay buffer (0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 175 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPPS, pH 8.0, at 37 °C) and lyophilized for storage. Reagent 1 contains 300 nm thrombin, 300 nmFIXa, 60 μm phospholipid vesicles (25% phosphatidylserine; 75% phosphatidylcholine, mol/mol), and 15 mm CaCl2. Reagent 2 contains 1 μmFX, and reagent 3 was a substrate solution containing 20 mmEDTA, 700 μm Kabi S-2765 (FXa-sensitive substrate), and 2 μm Kabi I-2581 (thrombin inhibitor). In the assay, appropriate samples of ∼20 μl were added to 20 μl of reagent 2 in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube, then 20 μl of reagent 1 was added quickly, vortexed, and placed at 37 °C water bath. After 100 s, 50 μl of the reaction mixture was removed and added to a second Eppendorf tube containing 450 μl of 20 mm EDTA at 4 °C to stop further activation of FX. Seventy five μl of this solution was then placed in a microtiter plate, warmed at 37 °C, and mixed with 75 μl of substrate solution (reagent 3). The plates were monitored kinetically at 405 nm for 10 min (Molecular Devices, ThermoMax Reader). The averaged, background subtracted, velocity measurements were plotted as the velocity of substrate hydrolysisversus 1/titer. Slopes were fit to each series of sample dilutions using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (38.Marquardt D.W. J. Soc. Ind. Appl. Math. 1963; 11: 431-437Crossref Google Scholar). The activation of FX by FIXa was also determined at 37 °C in the presence of thrombin-stimulated platelets, FVIIIa and CaCl2, as described previously (21.Ahmad S.S. Rawala-Sheikh R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20012-20016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Simultaneously FVIII-specific activities (4,000–5,000 units/mg) were also measured by the ability to clot hemophilic plasma in a clotting assay (39.Lee M.L. Maglalang E.A. Kingdon H.S. Thromb. Res. 1983; 30: 511-519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Albumin density gradient washed gel-filtered platelets (wGFP) were isolated from human venous blood by the modification of the method of Walsh et al. (40.Walsh P.N. Mills D.C. White J.G. Br. J. Haematol. 1977; 36: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), as recently reported by us (23.Scandura J.M. Ahmad S.S. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 36: 8890-8902Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Platelets obtained in this manner contained no detectable levels of FII, FX, or vWF. Therefore, in all our experiments we used activated platelets prepared by incubation of platelets at 37 °C with 1.0 nm human α-thrombin for 5 min, followed by the addition of 2.5 μm PPACK. Similarly, binding studies of activated platelets with active cofactor (FVIIIa) were performed by activating both FVIII and platelets by the addition of 0.1 unit/ml human α-thrombin for 5 min followed by the addition of 2.5 μmPPACK just prior to the binding assay. In a typical binding experiment, wGFP platelets (3.5 × 108/ml) in Ca2+-free HEPES/Tyrode's buffer, pH 7.4, were incubated at 37 °C in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf plastic centrifuge tube with mixtures of unlabeled and radiolabeled rFVIII or FVIIIa, CaCl2, platelet agonists, and other proteins. After incubation, aliquots (100 μl) were removed and centrifuged through a mixture of silicon oils as described previously (41.Ahmad S.S. Rawala-Sheikh R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3244-3251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data were analyzed, and the number of binding sites and K d values were calculated from the means of six independent determinations each done in duplicate using a Macintosh Quadra 900 computer (Apple Computer, Cupertino, CA) and the Ligand Program as modified by G. A. McPherson (Elsevier Science Publishers BV, The Netherlands). The activation of FX by platelet-bound FIXa in the presence of bound FVIIIa was determined in the presence of CaCl2 and FIXa at concentrations of the reactants indicated in the figure legends and as described previously by us (23.Scandura J.M. Ahmad S.S. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 36: 8890-8902Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 41.Ahmad S.S. Rawala-Sheikh R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3244-3251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subunits of FVIII were prepared by the method described by Fay et al. (3.Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, human recombinant FVIII was first dialyzed into 0.1 m NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 7.2, then diluted to 0.2 mg/ml, and activated with 20 nm human α-thrombin at room temperature. After 3 min 50 nm FPR-CK was added to inhibit thrombin activity, and aliquots were removed and assayed for FVIII activity using a one-stage clotting assay. Activated FVIII was applied to a Mono-S column (equilibrated with 0.1 m NaCl, 2.5 mmCaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 6.0). Unbound material contained B domain, whereas the bound material was eluted by 30-ml linear gradient, i.e. A2 domain was eluted at ∼0.33 m NaCl and A1/A3C1C2 dimer was eluted at ∼0.64m NaCl with some residual contamination of A2 subunit. Both A2 subunit fraction and A1/A3C1C2 were subsequently purified to homogeneous proteins by chromatography over R8B12 immunoabsorbent. Dimer eluted in the unbound fraction, whereas A2 was eluted from the R8B12 antibody column (equilibrated with 0.7 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 7.2) with buffer containing 50% ethylene glycol. Purification of A1 subunit from A3C1C2 subunit was carried out by chromatography on Mono-Q column equilibrated and eluted in 0.15 m NaCl, 0.02 mHEPES, 0.01% Tween 20 plus 0.04 m EDTA (42.Lapan K.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2082-2088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A3C1C2 subunit was eluted in the unbound fraction whereas A1 subunit was absorbed and subsequently batch-eluted with buffer containing ∼0.8m NaCl. Protein was determined by the Coomassie dye binding method of Bradford (43.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar) and SDS-PAGE analysis of Mono-S fast protein liquid chromatographic column; R8B12 immunoabsorbent column and Mono-Q columns were performed using the buffer system of Laemmli (29.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar) as shown in Fig. 1. We have compared seven iodination procedures for labeling FVIII. Labeling of FVIII by the methods of IODO-GEN (30.Tuszynski G.P. Knight L. Piperno J.R. Walsh P.N. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), IODO-BEADS (31.Gilbert G.E. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. Furie B. Furie B.C. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17261-17268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), transfer technique (32.Bloom J.W. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4419-4425Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), lactose peroxidase (33.Tracy P.B. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 329-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and Enzymobeads (34.Ortel T.L. Devore-Carter D. Quinn-Allen M. Kane W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4189-4198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) all left FVIII with less than 20% activity. FVIII labeled with [3H]propionate (35.Foster P.A. Fulcher C.A. Houghten R.A. Zimmerman T.S. Blood. 1990; 75: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) worked very well except the low energy emission from tritium was not sensitive enough for use. In comparison to other procedures, the Bolton-Hunter reagent (36.Bolton A.E. Hunter W.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2395) Google Scholar) for labeling FVIII was relatively mild and resulted in retention of >95% of specific functional activity. Therefore, in all our experiments we used the Bolton-Hunter reagent to radiolabel FVIII. To characterize the bound FVIII and FVIIIa structurally, platelets were incubated with thrombin (0.1 u/ml), CaCl2 (5 mm), EGR-FIXa (45 nm), and FX (1.5 μm) for 20 min at 37 °C in the presence of either 125I-FVIII or125I-FVIIIa and centrifuged through 20% sucrose to separate the bound from free ligand as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Platelet pellets were solubilized in SDS and were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography as described previously (21.Ahmad S.S. Rawala-Sheikh R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20012-20016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Scandura J.M. Ahmad S.S. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 36: 8890-8902Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The bound radioligand migrated under reduced conditions as two major bands, i.e. HC, molecular mass = 90–200 kDa, and LC, molecular mass = 80 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2, lane 1). Thrombin activated FVIII, i.e.FVIIIa (Fig. 2, lane 2) migrated under reduced conditions as several bands of molecular mass = ∼90, 72, 50, and 43 kDa representing A1-A2 domain; A3 plus C1, C2; A1 and A2 respectively. Fig.2 (lane 2) clearly indicates the apparent retention of the A2 domain in platelet-bound FVIIIa and the complete absence of B domain. Both bound FVIII and FVIIIa were indistinguishable from free FVIII and FVIIIa (data not shown), and the data provided in Fig. 2provide no evidence for the formation of high molecular weight covalent complexes or for proteolytic degradation of FVIII or FVIIIa by platelets thus confirming that the bound radioactivity consists entirely of FVIII or FVIIIa and not a radiolabeled contaminant. The fact that the bound cofactor (FVIII or FVIIIa) is structurally intact and indistinguishable from free cofactor (FVIII or FVIIIa) provides strong evidence that the functional F-X-activating complex consists of bound cofactor (FVIII or FVIIIa) together with bound enzyme (FIXa) (21.Ahmad S.S.

The function of a SCAN box is unknown, but it is predicted to form α-helices that may be involved in protein-protein interactions. Myeloid zinc finger gene-1B (MZF1B) is an alternatively spliced human cDNA isoform of the zinc finger transcription factor, MZF1. MZF1 and MZF1B contain 13 C2H2 zinc finger motifs, but only MZF1B contains an amino-terminal SCAN box. A bone marrow cDNA library was screened for proteins interacting with the MZF1B SCAN box domain and RAZ1 (SCAN-related protein associated with MZF1B) was identified. RAZ1 is a novel cDNA that encodes a SCAN-related domain and arginine-rich region but no zinc finger motifs. Co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that the SCAN box domain of MZF1B is necessary for association with RAZ1. By yeast two-hybrid analysis, the carboxyl terminus of RAZ1 is sufficient for interaction with the MZF1B SCAN box. Furthermore, MZF1B and RAZ1 each self-associate in vitro via a SCAN box-dependent mechanism.

Many C2H2 zinc finger genes have been demonstrated to function as transcriptional regulators and frequently, zinc finger genes are targeted for disruption in a variety of human diseases and cancers. The Krüppel-like subclass of mammalian C2H2 zinc finger proteins, first identified in the zinc finger transcription factor TFIIIA, share a conserved link between the last histidine of the preceding finger motif with the first cysteine of the next finger (H-C link) (1.Miller J. McLachlam A.D. Klug A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1609-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). Krüppel-like proteins often contain conserved modular domains outside of their zinc finger motifs. These identified domains include the KRAB (Krüppel-associated box) domains A and B, FAX (finger-associated box) domain of Xenopus, BTB/POZ (broad complex, tramtrack, andbric-a-brac/poxvirus and zinc finger) or ZiN (zinc finger N-terminal) domain, and the SCAN box or leucine-rich domain. To date, the functions of the KRAB and BTB/POZ domains have been best characterized. The KRAB domain is a conserved stretch of 75 amino acids found in an estimated one-third of Krüppel-like zinc finger proteins (2.Bellefroid E.J. Poncelet D.A. Lecocq P.J. Revelant O. Martial J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3608-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The KRAB domain, further subdivided into domains A and B, functions as a potent transcriptional repressor (3.Margolin J.F. Friedman J.R. Meyer W.K.-H. Vissing H. Thiesen H.-J. Rauscher III, F.J.

The KRAB domain from KOX1 interacts with human TIF1β (also named KAP-1,KRAB-associated protein-1) (6.Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W. Huang X.-P. Neilson E.G.

Le Douarin B. Bourquin J.-P. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4859-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In addition, the KRAB-A domain of Kid-1 interacts with KRIP-1 (KRAB-A interactingprotein), which is likely to be the murine homologue of TIF1β and KAP-1 (8.Kim S.-S. Chen Y.-M. O'Leary E. Witzgall R.

The POZ domain defines a conserved region of approximately 120 amino acids and is found in 5–10% of zinc finger proteins. The POZ domain is a protein interaction motif (9.Bardwell V.J. Treisman R.

The POZ domain also has been demonstrated to interact with the co-repressors N-CoR, SMRT, Sin3, and histone deacetylase (16.David G. Alland L. Hing S.H. Wong C.W. DePinho R.A. Dejean A.

However, this may not be a general mechanism for POZ-containing transcription factors (20.Deltour S. Guerardel C. Leprince D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14831-14836Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2908-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).

Nagata S. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 581-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). SCAN box domains are about 80 residues in length, and approximately two-thirds of the amino acids are highly conserved with 80–100% sequence identity. The function of the SCAN box is unknown. Based on protein sequence analysis, the SCAN box is predicted to form two or three amphipathic helices that may be involved in protein-protein interactions (4.Pengue G. Calabro V. Bartoli P.C. Pagliuca A. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2908-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 21.Williams A.J. Khachigian L.M. Shows T. Collins T. J. Biol.

Fusion of the SCAN box to a GAL4 DNA binding domain has demonstrated that the SCAN box cannot confer transactivation or repression function onto a heterologous DNA binding domain (4.Pengue G. Calabro V. Bartoli P.C. Pagliuca A. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2908-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 21.Williams A.J. Khachigian L.M. Shows T. Collins T. J. Biol.

To gain a better understanding of the SCAN box function, we directed our attention to the SCAN box-containing zinc finger protein, MZF1B. 1M. J. Peterson and J. F. Morris, submitted for publication., 2M. J. Peterson, and J. F. Morris, manuscript in preparation. MZF1B is an alternatively spliced isoform of the zinc finger transcription factor, MZF1 (26.Hromas R.

Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 581-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). MZF1 is a 485-amino acid protein that contains 13 C2H2zinc finger motifs arranged in a bipartite DNA binding domain. The consensus DNA binding sites have been identified (27.Morris J.F. Hromas R. Rauscher III, F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1786-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and MZF may regulate the expression of specific genes in a tissue-specific manner (28.Morris J.F. Rauscher III, F.J. Davis B.

MZF1B cDNA encodes a 734-amino acid protein that shares identity to the carboxyl terminus of MZF1, including the 13 C2H2 zinc finger motifs. However, MZF1B encodes an additional 257 residues at its amino terminus, which contains a SCAN box domain. Therefore, the amino-terminal domains unique to each isoform may define the distinct functions of MZF1 and MZF1B proteins. We hypothesized that the MZF1B SCAN box is a protein interaction domain. A human bone marrow cDNA library was screened for proteins interacting with the MZF1B SCAN box domain, and RAZ1 (SCAN-related proteinassociated with MZF1B) was identified. MZF andRAZ1 cDNAs were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3.1 (−)/Myc-His (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA) using oligonucleotides synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. (TableI).

Open table in a new tab Full-length MZF1B cDNA (amino acids 1–734) and the unique amino terminus of MZF1B (amino acids 1–257) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)3 methods with oligonucleotides 1 and 2 or oligonucleotides 1 and 3, respectively, and subcloned into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pcDNA3.1 (A) to produce plasmids MZF1B-mh/pcDNA and MZF1B N-term-mh/pcDNA, where “mh” indicates fusion of the protein to the carboxyl-terminal Myc-His epitope tag. MZF1B lacking the Myc/His tag was created by subcloning the same PCR fragment from MZF1B-mh/pcDNA into pcDNA3.1 (C) to create MZF1B3*/pcDNA, which added three extra amino acids (Lys, Ala, Thr) to the carboxyl terminus of MZF1B. To eliminate these extra amino acids, a SmaI fragment from gp-end*/pcDNA (MZF1B amino acids 463–734) was subcloned into theSmaI-digested MZF1B3*/pcDNA plasmid to create MZF1B*/pcDNA. The plasmid gp-end*/pcDNA was produced by PCR amplification of MZF1B cDNA (amino acids 463–734, including the stop codon) with oligonucleotides 4 and 5 and subcloning theBglII and HindIII PCR fragment into pcDNA3.1 (A). The unique amino terminus of MZF1B (amino acids 1–257) lacking the Myc/His tag was constructed by subcloning the same PCR fragment of MZF1B N-term-mh/pcDNA into pcDNA3.1 (C) to create MZF1B N-term*/pcDNA, which encodes an extra three amino acids (Lys, Ala, Thr) at the carboxyl-terminal end. Full-length MZF1B with the SCAN box domain deleted, MZF1B ΔSCAN-mh/pcDNA, was constructed by a three-step subcloning procedure. First, the cDNA encoding amino acids 1–46 of MZF1B was PCR-amplified using oligonucleotides 1 and 6 and subcloned into theEcoRI and KpnI sites of pcDNA3.1 (A), creating MZF1B 1–46-mh/pcDNA. Second, the MZF1BcDNA encoding amino acids 124–357 (contains an internalBamHI site) was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides 7 and 8 and subcloned into the KpnI and HindIII sites of MZF1B 1–46 mh/pcDNA to create MZF1B 1–357ΔSCAN-mh/pcDNA. Third, a BamHI andHindIII fragment of MZF1B-mh/pcDNA (internalBamHI and 3′ HindIII site immediately following amino acid 734) was then subcloned into the BamHI andHindIII sites of MZF1B 1–357ΔSCAN-mh/pcDNA to construct MZF1B ΔSCAN-mh/pcDNA. The unique MZF1B amino terminus with the SCAN box deleted, MZF1B N-term ΔSCAN-mh/pcDNA, was constructed by subcloning a BglII fragment from MZF1B 1–357ΔSCAN-mh/pcDNA into theBglII-digested MZF1B N-term-mh/pcDNA plasmid. Full-length MZF1 cDNA (amino acids 1–485) was PCR-amplified with oligonucleotides 9 and 2. The PCR fragment, flanked by BglII and HindIII, was subcloned into theBamHI and HindIII sites of pcDNA3.1 (A) to create MZF1-mh/pcDNA. The cDNA isolated from yeast two-hybrid screening was removed from the pACT2 expression vector by digestion with BglII (including the hemagglutinin (HA) tag) and subcloned into theBamHI site of pcDNA3.1 (A) to generate ha-RAZ1/pcDNA. β-gal-mh/pcDNA, an expression plasmid encoding Myc-His epitope-tagged β-galactosidase, was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). MZF1B and RAZ1 cDNA were subcloned into yeast expression cloning vectors, pAS2–1 and pACT2 (CLONTECH; Palo Alto, CA), to generate fusion proteins with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (BD; amino acids 1–147) or GAL4 activation domain (AD; amino acids 768–881), respectively. The constructs were confirmed by automated sequencing using AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase FS (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). To generate the bait plasmid, SCAN/pAS2–1, the cDNA encoding the MZF1B SCAN box (amino acids 47–123) was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides 10 and 11 and subcloned into the EcoRI andHindIII sites of the mammalian expression vector CB6+ (34.Patwardhan S. Gashler A. Siegel M.G. Chang L.C. Joseph L.J. Shows T.B. Le Beau M.M. Sukhatme V.P. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 917-928PubMed Google Scholar) to create SCAN/CB6+. SCAN/CB6+ was digested with EcoRI andBamHI and the MZF1B SCAN box insert was subcloned into pAS2–1. To generate fusions of the MZF1B SCAN box with the GAL4 AD and HA tag, the cDNA encoding the MZF1B SCAN box (amino acids 47–123) was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides 12 and 13 and subcloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pACT2 to create SCAN/pACT2. RAZ1/pACT2 is the library clone isolated from the yeast two-hybrid screen as described below. This clone contains the RAZ1cDNA (amino acids 1–217) library insert subcloned into theEcoRI and XhoI sites of pACT2 to generate a fusion protein containing the GAL4 AD and HA tag. RAZ1 cDNA encoding amino acids 38–217 was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides 14 and 15 or oligonucleotides 16 and 17 and subcloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pAS2–1 or the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pACT2 to create RAZ1 38–217/pAS2–1 and ha-RAZ1 38–217/pACT2, respectively. cDNA encoding either the amino terminus (amino acids 38–132) or carboxyl terminus (amino acids 133–217) of RAZ1 was PCR-amplified using oligonucleotides 16 and 18 or oligonucleotides 19 and 17 and subcloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pACT2 to generate ha-RAZ1 N-term/pACT2 and ha-RAZ1 C-term/pACT2, respectively. The MATCHMAKER Two-Hybrid System 2 and GAL4 Human Bone Marrow MATCHMAKER cDNA library were purchased from CLONTECH. A large scale, sequential transformation of the GAL4-SCAN bait fusion (SCAN/pAS2–1) and bone marrow cDNA library was carried out according to the manufacturer's directions. Briefly, the bone marrow cDNA library (50 μg) was introduced into CG-1945 yeast previously transformed with SCAN/pAS2–1, and yeast transformants were plated onto synthetic drop-out medium depleted of histidine, tryptophan, and leucine (SD −His/−Trp/−Leu) containing 5 mm 3-amino-1,2,3-triazole. Yeast clones positive for HIS3 expression were assayed for β-galactosidase activity with the colony-lift filter assay. Yeast plasmid DNA was isolated using glass beads and phenol/chloroform extraction (Method 1 in Ref. 63.CLONTECH, Yeast Protocol Handbook PT3024–1, pp. 29–30, CLONTECHPalo Alto, CAGoogle Scholar) and pACT2 library plasmids were rescued via transformation of electrocompetent Escherichia coli KC8 (CLONTECH). Approximately 5 × 105 plaque-forming units from a λgt11 5′-StretchPlus cDNA library synthesized from the human erythroleukemia cell line, K562 (CLONTECH) were plated and transferred to BA-S nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell). The filters were hybridized (35.Denhardt D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1966; 23: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (2495) Google Scholar) with a 32P-labeled RAZ1 cDNA probe (nucleotides 115–396) for 20 h at 65 °C and washed under high-stringency conditions with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. Total RNA was isolated from tissue culture cells with TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies). The RNA was separated by electrophoresis through a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to a 0.2-μm Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was hybridized (35.Denhardt D. Biochem.

First and second strand cDNA synthesis from human bone marrow poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH), adapter ligation, and 5′ and 3′ Marathon RACE reactions were performed using the Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's directions. Gene-specific primers were synthesized by Life Technologies for 3′ RACE (RAZ1 GSP-2 (nucleotides 361–385), 5′-GTA GCG CCT CAG GCC GAA GCT GAA G-3′) and 5′ RACE (RAZ1 GSP-1b (nucleotides 723–749), 5′-AAC ACG GGG TGG GGT CCC AGG CTC AGG-3′). The TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to synthesize radiolabeled proteins for co-immunoprecipitation experiments. In vitro transcription and translation reactions were carried out in a final volume of 25 μl according to the manufacturer's directions using 1 μg of plasmid DNA and 10–20 μCi of [35S]cysteine or methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). IVT lysate (5–7 μl) and 1 μg of purified rabbit IgG (α-His, α-Myc, α-post-SCAN, α-ZF) or a 1:150 dilution of rabbit α-HA antisera were incubated at 4 °C for 2–3 h in 500 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (150 mmNaCl, 10 mm NaPO4 pH 7.2, 1% IGEPAL, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). The immune complexes were immunoprecipitated with 10% protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at 4 °C, washed three times with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer, and resuspended in 15 μl of 1× SDS-Laemmli buffer. The gels were fluorographed with Me2SO and 2,5-diphenyloxazole and visualized by autoradiography. Normal rabbit IgG was used as a negative control (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal IgG α-His and α-Myc are specific for the 6× histidine probe and c-Myc epitope tag, respectively (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Rabbit polyclonal crude antiserum α-HA was raised against the HA tag (Babco, Richmond, CA). Rabbit polyclonal α-post-SCAN antiserum was generated using amino acids 124–257 of MZF1B. Rabbit polyclonal α-ZF antiserum was generated using zinc fingers 1–4 of MZF1B (amino acids 358–462) (32.Hromas R. Morris J. Cornetta K. Berebitsky D. Davidson A. Sha M. Sledge G. Rauscher III, F. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3610-3614PubMed Google Scholar). IgG fractions were purified from both α-post-SCAN and α-ZF antisera by protein A chromatography (36.Fuller S.A. Takahashi M. Hurrell J.G.R.

Computer searches were done using the FASTA, BLAST, and MOTIFS algorithms through the Wisconsin Package software (64.Genetics Computer Group, Wisconsin Package Version 10.0, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WIGoogle Scholar) or BLAST version 2.0 through the World Wide Web interface. Nucleotide sequences were compared with entries in the GenBankTM or expressed sequence tag (EST) data bases, while peptide sequences were searched against the Protein Information Resources (PIR) or Swiss-Prot data base. The Homo sapiens clone RP5–1121G12 from the RPCI5 library maps to chromosome 20q11.1–11.23 and has been assigned the EMBL/GenBankTM accession number AL109965. These data were produced by the Human Chromosome 20 Mapping and Sequencing Groups at the Sanger Center. Mapping and sequence data can be obtained on the World Wide Web. A human bone marrow cDNA library was screened by yeast two-hybrid analysis for potential MZF1B SCAN box interacting proteins, and one clone was identified (Table II). To confirm the positive protein interaction, we performed two-hybrid assays in the presence and absence of the MZF1B SCAN box domain. The library plasmid did not autonomously activate reporter gene expression, and a positive protein interaction was only observed when both the MZF1B SCAN box and library plasmid were co-transformed into yeast (Table II). To determine whether the interaction was an artifact of the fusion protein partner, we switched the AD and the DNA BD fusion partners for both the MZF1B SCAN box and interacting clone. The interaction between the MZF1B SCAN box and the isolated library clone was not dependent upon the fusion protein partner (Table II). These control experiments confirm that we identified a cDNA library insert positive for MZF1B SCAN box protein interaction. We have named this protein, RAZ1, a SCAN-related protein associated with MZF1B.Table IIIdentification of RAZ1, a novel cDNA library clone that interacts with the MZF1B SCAN boxa Number of yeast colony-forming units/μg of plasmid DNA (cfu/μg) growing on leucine and tryptophan-depleted medium: cfu × total suspension vol (μl)/vol plated (μl) × dilution factor × amount DNA used (μg) = cfu/μg of DNA.a The percentage of yeast positive for both HIS3and lacZ reporter gene expression.

The cDNA and amino acid sequences of RAZ1 are shown in Fig.1 A. The sequence is not found in the GenBankTM data base and appears to be a novel clone. The open reading frame for RAZ1 is defined by fusion with the upstream GAL4 activation domain and encodes 217 amino acids, starting with a glycine and ending with a stop codon at nucleotide position 652. The first methionine is at nucleotide 115 and contains a weak Kozak consensus sequence for translation initiation (37.Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Thus, it is probable that we have isolated a partial cDNA clone from the GAL4 fusion library that is incomplete at the 5′-end. The predicted sequence of RAZ1 encodes a SCAN-related domain at its carboxyl terminus (amino acids 140–200) but no zinc finger motifs. We refer to the domain as “SCAN-related” because the alignment with SCAN domains in other zinc finger proteins is conserved at the amino terminus and truncated at the carboxyl terminus (TableIII). Approximately 20 SCAN box-containing proteins have been reported and/or deposited into the GenBankTM data base that contain zinc finger motifs and/or KRAB domains (Table III).

A variety of structural and functional criteria have been used to group the superfamily into three classes consisting of TGFs-β, activins, and bone morphogenic proteins. Members of these groups have been implicated in the regulation of wound healing, cellular proliferation, immune responses, and pattern formation throughout development. Two distinct membrane receptor proteins referred to as TGF-β type I (TGF-βRI) and type II (TGF-βRII) receptors and a membrane-anchored proteoglycan called the type III receptor have been characterized and show high affinity TGF-β ligand binding (4.Franzen P. ten Dijke P.

The type III receptor is proposed to present TGF-β to the signaling receptors and to enhance cell responsiveness to TGF-β; however, its short intracellular domain and absence of known signaling motifs suggest a limited role in direct regulation of TGF-β signaling. TGF-β signaling is primarily mediated by TGF-βRI and TGF-βRII. The signaling cascade begins when TGF-βRII binds ligand and recruits TGF-βRI into a heteromeric complex. TGF-βRII then transphosphorylates TGF-βRI at serine residues in the juxtamembrane glycine/serine-rich domain, and the activated TGF-βRI, in turn, interacts and activates downstream targets (7.Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2113) Google Scholar). Interaction screens have demonstrated that the immunophilin FKBP12 binds to TGF-β type I receptors (8.Wang T.W. Donahoe P.K. Zervos A.S.

FKBP12 belongs to a large family of peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerases catalyzing the isomerization of peptidylprolyl imide bonds in peptide and protein substrates. It was first isolated as the receptor protein for the immunosuppressive drugs FK506 and rapamycin (11.Göthel S.F. Marahiel M.A. Cell. Mol.

The FKBP12·FK506 complex inhibits calcineurin phosphatase activity and nuclear factor of activated T cells translocation, whereas the FKBP12·rapamycin complex inactivates TOR (targetof rapamycin) family proteins (13.Liu J.

Although the interaction of FKBP12 and the TGF-β type I receptor has been unequivocally established, its function in TGF-β-mediated signaling has been controversial. Initial reports proposed that FKBP12 functioned as a negative regulator of TGF-β signaling (15.Chen Y.G. Liu F. Massagué J.

However, other studies reported no detectable effect on TGF-β signaling in FKBP12 null fibroblasts or by disrupting FKBP12/TGF-βRI binding with FK506 or rapamycin (17.Charng M.J. Kinnunen P.

Although a considerable amount of effort has been directed to studying the role of FKBP12 in TGF-β signaling, other possible functions of FKBP12 in regulating TGF-β activity have not been extensively investigated. Our laboratory has developed a chimeric receptor system that employs the ligand-binding domain of the human GM-CSF α- or β-receptor fused to the TGF-β type I or II receptor transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (20.Anders R.A. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21758-21766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21.Anders R.A. Doré Jr., J.J.E. Arline S.L. Garamszegi N. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23118-23125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This model system permits one to determine the signaling and endocytic activities of defined TGF-β receptor complexes and provides a sensitive method to quantify the rates and extent of receptor internalization. In the course of studies identifying elements within the chimeric type I receptor that control receptor trafficking, 2D. Yao, J. J. E. Doré, Jr., and E. B. Leof, manuscript in preparation. we noted the presence of a potential negative regulator of endocytosis near the chimeric type I receptor glycine/serine-rich domain (amino acids 185–192). Since FKBP12 binds to a nearby Leu-Pro sequence at amino acids 193 and 194 (17.Charng M.J. Kinnunen P. Hawker J. Brand T. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22941-22944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we investigated whether FKBP12 binding to the chimeric type I receptor might be inhibitory to TGF-β receptor internalization. In this report, we observed a specific enhancement of chimeric TGF-β receptor internalization when FKBP12 binding to the chimeric type I receptor was prevented. This effect occurred independently of type II receptor kinase activity. We also found that FKBP12 does not modulate basal or chimeric TGF-β receptor-mediated induction of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) or fibronectin proteins in fibroblast cell lines. As such, our data suggest that a novel physiological function of FKBP12 is to act as a negative regulator of TGF-β receptor endocytosis. 125I-Labeled recombinant human GM-CSF and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. To document activation of endogenous TGF-β receptors, TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 were purchased from Austral Biologicals (San Ramon, CA) or R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN); no difference in activity was observed for either isoform (data not shown). Rapamycin was purchased from Sigma. Chimeric receptor-expressing fibroblast clones were maintained in 5% FBS/DMEM containing 100 μg/ml bioactive Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 50 μg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described (20.Anders R.A. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21758-21766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Parental AKR-2B cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were washed with serum-free DMEM and then incubated for 8 h in 2 ml of DMEM with transfection solution consisting of 2–4 μg of expression plasmid DNA and 2 μl/μg TransITTM LT2 (PanVera Corp., Madison, WI) in a final volume of 100 μl with Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were allowed to recover for 16 h in 5% FBS/DMEM and then were placed in selective medium (5% FBS/DMEM with 600 μg/ml Geneticin and 350 μg/ml hygromycin B) for 24 h before splitting 1:40 by surface area. Separated colonies were isolated and expanded after 2–3 weeks. L193A/P194A mutant constructs were made using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The polymerase chain reaction template was the chimeric type I receptor consisting of the extracellular domain of the GM-CSF receptor α-subunit and the transmembrane and intracellular domains of the TGF-β type I receptor (20.Anders R.A. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21758-21766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The primers used for amplification were 5′-CTGGCTCAGGTTTAgCAgcGCTTGTTCAGAGA and 3′-TCTCTGAACAAGCgcTGcTAAACCTGAGCCAG (lowercase letters indicate the mutated nucleotides). The polymerase chain reaction was set up at 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 2 min, and 65 °C for 18 min and was repeated for 18 cycles. The insert was verified by automated DNA sequencing and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pNa (20.Anders R.A. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21758-21766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cultures were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates (9.6 cm2/well) 16–24 h prior to the experiment in 5% FBS/DMEM. Ligand binding was performed at 4 °C in binding buffer (DMEM containing 200 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) supplemented with 100 pm125I-labeled GM-CSF in the presence or absence of a 20-fold molar excess of unlabeled GM-CSF to document specific binding. Once equilibrium had been reached (2–4 h), the plates were washed twice with binding buffer. 1 ml of 5% FBS/DMEM (prewarmed to 37 °C) with or without 10 μm rapamycin was added to each well (final ethanol concentration of 0.1% for all wells), and the plates were returned to 37 °C for the indicated times. Percent internalization (i.e. specific cpm in cell/specific surface cpm) was determined after acid washing (PBS, pH 3.0; two 2-min washes) to remove surface-bound ligand and cell lysis in 0.2 m NaOH and 40 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. EGF internalization was measured as described for GM-CSF, except the binding buffer was 20 mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and DMEM, pH 7.4, and the acid stripping solution was 50 mm acetic acid, 135 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm KCl. 125I-Labeled EGF was added to binding buffer at 150 pm, and specific binding was determined by co-incubation with 400-fold excess unlabeled EGF. The endocytic rate constant (k e), defined as the probability of an occupied receptor being internalized in 1 min at 37 °C, represents the slope of the line when the ratio of the internalized versus surface-bound ligand is plotted as a function of time. This constant is independent of receptor affinity or number and has been shown to be an accurate reflection of internalization (22.Wiley H.S. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4222-4229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at 1.5 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates the day before the experiment. Plates were chilled at 4 °C for 20 min, followed by two washes with ice-cold binding buffer. 100 pm125I-labeled GM-CSF in the presence or absence of a 20-fold molar excess of unlabeled GM-CSF in binding buffer was added to each well, and the plates were rocked at 4 °C for 2 h. The cells were washed with 75% calf serum and 25% binding buffer, and 1 ml of 5% FBS/DMEM (prewarmed to 37 °C) with or without 10 μm rapamycin was added to each well. At the indicated times, the medium was collected and precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The cells were solubilized with 0.2 mNaOH and 40 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA to determine cell-associated counts. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that degraded ligand was almost exclusively secreted into the medium (data not shown). The extent of degradation was measured as the trichloroacetic acid-soluble counts divided by the sum of the two fractions. Cells were seeded in six-well plates at 1.5 × 105 cells/well 24 h before the experiment. The next day, the growth medium was removed, and cells were washed twice with 1× PBS. 1 ml of methionine-free DMEM alone or containing 10 ng/ml either GM-CSF or TGF-β2 was added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Cells were then pulsed for 2 h with 50 μCi of Easy Tag EXPRESS [35S] protein labeling mixture (NEN Life Science Products) and processed by washing (on ice) once with 1× PBS; three times with 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; twice with 2 mm Tris, pH 8.0; and once with 1× PBS (23.Cárcamo J. Weis F.M. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining matrix proteins were eluted from the plate by addition of 100 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol. The samples were separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by fluorography. Cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates and incubated overnight. The next day, the cells were washed twice with 1× PBS and placed in serum-free MCDB 402 medium (JRH Biosciences) for 24 h. The following day, the growth medium was replaced with 1 ml of methionine-free DMEM alone (control) or containing 10 ng/ml either GM-CSF or TGF-β2 in the presence of 50 μCi of Easy Tag EXPRESS [35S] protein labeling mixture. The plates were returned to the incubator for 4 h. The medium was collected and mixed with 50 μl of gelatin-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 50 μl of 10% Triton X-100 and rocked at 4 °C for 2 h. Following washing once with Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris and 150 mm NaCl), once with 50 mm Tris and 500 mm NaCl, and again with Tris-buffered saline, the bound proteins were eluted with 50 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol. The samples were separated by 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by fluorography. The A105 clone is an AKR-2B mouse fibroblast cell line that expresses wild-type chimeric TGF-β type I and type II receptors. Addition of GM-CSF activates both the signaling and endocytic activities of the receptor complex (20.Anders R.A. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21758-21766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24.Anders R.A. Arline S.L. Doré J.J.E. Leof E.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the course of studies using chimeric type I receptor truncation mutants, we noted the presence of a potential negative regulator of endocytosis acting within/nearby the glycine/serine-rich domain.2 Since this region overlapped the FKBP12-binding site and because the role of FKBP12 in TGF-β receptor action has been controversial, we decided to examine the effect of FKBP12 binding on chimeric receptor internalization. 125I-Labeled GM-CSF binding was performed at 4 °C, and the cultures were shifted to 37 °C in the absence or presence of 10 μm rapamycin to sequester intracellular FKBP12 (8.Wang T.W. Donahoe P.K. Zervos A.S. Science. 1994; 265: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, addition of rapamycin significantly enhanced chimeric receptor internalization (p < 0.05). Moreover, similar results were obtained using mink lung epithelial cells or by substituting FK506 to prevent FKBP12 binding to the chimeric type I receptor (data not shown). Thus, agents that sequester FKBP12 enhanced chimeric TGF-β receptor internalization, and the effects were observed in both mesenchymal and epithelial cells. Since rapamycin is a potent immunosuppressant with a variety of cellular effects (14.Abraham R.T. Wiederrecht G.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 483-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), we were concerned about the specificity of the response to chimeric TGF-β receptor internalization. To address this question, we determined whether rapamycin would modulate internalization of the EGF receptor also expressed on A105 cells. The EGF receptor system was chosen because it is a well characterized model for receptor-mediated endocytosis, and it has not been reported to bind FKBP12. As shown in Fig. 1 (inset), although the kinetics of EGF receptor internalization were significantly faster than those of chimeric TGF-β receptor internalization (24.Anders R.A. Arline S.L. Doré J.J.E. Leof E.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 25.Sorkin A. Water C.M. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), no significant differences were found in EGF receptor internalization following rapamycin treatment. In fact, at 15 min, the cells treated with rapamycin had undergone internalization to an even lesser (not greater, as seen with TGF-β receptors) extent than the cells treated with vehicle alone. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that rapamycin specifically enhances chimeric TGF-β receptor internalization through sequestration of intracellular FKBP12. To characterize further the enhancement of internalization of the wild-type chimeric receptor by rapamycin, a dose-response experiment was performed. We examined the effects of various concentrations of rapamycin on receptor internalization at both 30 min (Fig.2 A) and 60 min (data not shown). At 30 min, a dose-dependent enhancement of internalization was observed with maximal activity seen at 30 μm. The concentration (10 μm) used in Fig.1 gave ∼65% of the maximal response. However, at 60 min, there was no significant difference between the two concentrations of rapamycin (data not shown). Thus, to minimize the potential nonspecific cellular effects associated with high concentrations of rapamycin, 10 μm was chosen as our working concentration for subsequent studies. A potential consequence of enhanced ligand internalization might be a corresponding increase in the rate of ligand degradation. Since, in the presence of rapamycin, the chimeric receptors were internalized more rapidly (Figs. 1 and 2 A), we investigated whether a similar effect on ligand degradation was observed. A105 cells expressing wild-type chimeric receptors were incubated with125I-labeled GM-CSF at 4 °C until equilibrium was achieved. Following removal of unbound ligand, the cells were incubated in the presence or absence of rapamycin at 37 °C for the times indicated. As shown in Fig. 2 B, degraded ligand was detectable in the medium after only 30 min of internalization, and ∼80% of the internalized ligand was degraded by 3 h. Interestingly, despite the faster rate of internalization, the rate of ligand degradation was unchanged by rapamycin. Although the significance of this finding is presently unclear, the results document that these two processes are not necessarily directly coupled (26.Dhanwada K.R. Vijapurkar U. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 544-554PubMed Google Scholar,27.Bradbury F.A. Menon K.M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8703-8712Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). FKBP12 binding is mediated through a Leu-Pro motif within the TGF-β type I receptor at amino acids 193 and 194 (28.Okadome T. Oeda E. Saitoh M. Hidenori I. Moses H. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21687-21690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Mutation of these two residues to alanines has been shown to abolish the ability of TGF-βRI to bind FKBP12 (17.Charng M.J. Kinnunen P. Hawker J. Brand T. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22941-22944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). If the enhanced internalization seen in Figs. 1and 2 A occurred through a specific effect of rapamycin in preventing FKBP12/TGF-βRI binding, then mutation of the FKBP12-binding site should abrogate the response to rapamycin. To that end, we established several stable fibroblast lines harboring the L193A/P194A double mutations in the chimeric type I receptor (coexpressed with the wild-type chimeric type II receptor) and tested them for the ability to internalize 125I-labeled GM-CSF in the absence and presence of rapamycin. As shown in Fig.3, rapamycin did not significantly enhance ligand internalization when the FKBP12-binding site in the chimeric type I receptor was eliminated. These results (Figs. 1,2 A, and 3) indicate that the increase in chimeric TGF-β receptor internalization by rapamycin is specifically mediated through FKBP12 and suggest that FKBP12 functions as a negative regulator of TGF-β receptor internalization. As discussed previously, the role of FKBP12 in TGF-β signaling is controversial (15.Chen Y.G. Liu F. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3866-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 16.Wang T.W.

Nature. 1998; 391: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to examine the signaling activity of the chimeric type I receptor deficient in FKBP12 binding (Fig. 4). Stable fibroblast clones expressing mutant chimeric TGF-βRI (L193A/P194A) and wild-type chimeric TGF-βRII were examined for ligand-stimulated secretion of PAI-1 and fibronectin proteins. As shown in Fig. 4 (A andB), the parental A105 cells exhibited ligand-dependent induction of PAI-1 and fibronectin proteins when stimulated with either GM-CSF (activates chimeric TGF-β receptors) or TGF-β2 (activates endogenous TGF-β receptors). Moreover, L193A/P194A receptor-expressing clones also responded to treatment with GM-CSF or TGF-β2 by increasing the expression of both PAI-1 and fibronectin proteins. Although there were quantitative differences as compared with A105 cells, neither the basal nor the induced secretion of PAI-1 and fibronectin proteins was elevated by the L193A/P194A mutation. Thus, altering the FKBP12-binding site in the chimeric TGF-β type I receptor did not enhance receptor-mediated signaling activities. Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that the kinase activity of TGF-βRII is required for optimal ligand internalization in mesenchymal cells (21.Anders R.A. Doré Jr., J.J.E. Arline S.L. Garamszegi N. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23118-23125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that FKBP12 is gradually released from TGF-βRI once the receptor is phosphorylated by TGF-βRII (15.Chen Y.G. Liu F. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3866-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 16.Wang T.W. Li B.Y. Danielson P.D. Shah P.C. Rockwell S. Lechleider R.J. Martin J. Manganaro T. Donahoe P.K. Cell. 1996; 86: 435-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that in addition to its obligate signaling role, an endocytic role of the type II receptor kinase is to function as a mechanism to dissociate the negative regulator FKBP12 from the type I receptor. As such, a direct extension of this hypothesis would be that rapamycin should abrogate the type II receptor kinase requirement for internalization via sequestering FKBP12 from the type I receptor. To test this possibility, we utilized several lines expressing wild-type chimeric type I receptors and mutant chimeric type II receptors harboring a mutation in the presumptive ATP-binding site (K277R) and investigated their response to rapamycin. These clones had been previously reported to have a diminished ability to internalize ligand and signal through the chimeric receptors (21.Anders R.A. Doré Jr., J.J.E. Arline S.L. Garamszegi N. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23118-23125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5 A, addition of rapamycin enhanced internalization of the K277R type II receptor by ∼35%, indicating an action downstream of the receptor kinase. The TGF-β type II receptor has both trans- as well as autophosphorylation activities (7.Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2113) Google Scholar). Although the K277R mutation will abolish both responses, a mutation at proline 525 to leucine (P525L) was shown to generate a type II receptor capable of autophosphorylation, yet lacking the ability to transphosphorylate an associated type I receptor (29.Cárcamo J. Zentella A. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This not only generated a receptor complex unable to signal, but one with diminished endocytic activity (21.Anders R.A. Doré Jr., J.J.E. Arline S.L. Garamszegi N. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23118-23125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As such, if TGF-βRI phosphorylation (presumably by TGF-βRII) was required for the release of FKBP12, and rapamycin enhanced chimeric receptor internalization via dissociating FKBP12 from the type I receptor, the P525L mutant receptor should also show enhanced internalization with rapamycin similar to the K277R receptor. Fig.5 B shows that this did in fact occur. Thus, rapamycin enhances internalization of chimeric TGF-β receptors in the absence of type II receptor kinase activity. FKBP12 is an abundant and ubiquitously expressed protein that catalyzes peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerization (11.Göthel S.F. Marahiel M.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 423-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 12.Kay J.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It is also classified as an immunophilin due to its ability to bind and activate the immunosuppressive activity of the macrolides FK506 and rapamycin. Although it has been shown convincingly that (i) FKBP12 associates with the TGF-β type I receptor, (ii) both FK506 and rapamycin effectively compete with the type I receptor for FKBP12, and (iii) type I receptor phosphorylation results in the gradual release of FKBP12 in a ligand-dependent manner, the physiological role of FKBP12 in TGF-β receptor signaling is still controversial (8.Wang T.W. Donahoe P.K. Zervos A.S. Science. 1994; 265: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar,15.Chen Y.G. Liu F. Massagué J.

Nature. 1998; 391: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In the course of studies designed to identify elements in the type I receptor controlling chimeric receptor trafficking, we noted that a negative regulator of endocytosis acted near the glycine/serine-rich domain.2 Since FKBP12 is the only protein known to bind the type I receptor in this region, we investigated the possibility of whether FKBP12 regulated TGF-β receptor internalization. To address the possible role of FKBP12 in TGF-β receptor endocytosis, we have employed our previously characterized chimeric receptor-expressing cultures (20.Anders R.A. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21758-21766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24.Anders R.A. Arline S.L. Doré J.J.E. Leof E.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Using this system, we found that rapamycin enhanced the internalization of chimeric TGF-β receptors in both AKR-2B mouse fibroblasts (Fig. 1 and 2A) and Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cells (data not shown). Interestingly, although the rate of125I-labeled GM-CSF internalization was increased in the presence of rapamycin, a corresponding increase in ligand degradation was not observed (Figs. 1 and 2 B). A similar dissociation of internalization and degradation has been reported by Dhanwada et al. (26.Dhanwada K.R. Vijapurkar U. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 544-554PubMed Google Scholar) and Bradbury and Menon (27.Bradbury F.A. Menon K.M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8703-8712Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) in studies of mutant luteinizing hormone receptors. Although a mechanism has not been defined, both our results might be a reflection of the differences in the kinetics of the internalization and degradation processes. For instance, following steady-state binding, the rapid rate of ligand internalization might saturate the intracellular sorting machinery (30.Marks M.S. Woodruff L. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar,31.Warren R.A. Green F.A. Stenberg P.E. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17056-17063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). As such, since endocytic sorting proceeds degradation, increased internalization would not necessarily lead to increased degradation. To that end, a current focus of our laboratory is to define the subcellular compartment(s) and effector(s) regulating TGF-β trafficking. Since rapamycin has numerous effects on cultured cells (14.Abraham R.T. Wiederrecht G.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 483-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), it was necessary to document that the increase in ligand internalization was specific to the TGF-β receptor system. This concern was initially addressed by examining EGF receptor internalization. The data demonstrated that rapamycin did not enhance the internalization of EGF receptors (Fig. 1, inset), which also internalize ligand through a clathrin-dependent mechanism, but have not been reported to interact with FKBP12 (24.Anders R.A. Arline S.L. Doré J.J.E. Leof E.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 25.Sorkin A. Water C.M. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This implies that the action of rapamycin in promoting chimeric TGF-β receptor internalization is not a nonspecific result of drug treatment, but is likely mediated through FKBP12. To investigate that hypothesis further, mutant type I receptors (L193A/P194A) incapable of binding FKBP12 were generated (28.Okadome T. Oeda E. Saitoh M. Hidenori I. Moses H. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21687-21690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). If the enhanced internalization by rapamycin observed in Fig. 1was a result of releasing FKBP12 from the type I receptor, then the L193A/P194A receptors should not be affected by rapamycin treatment. As shown in Fig. 3, the L193A/P194A mutants showed no statistically significant differences in rates and/or extent of internalization in the presence and absence of rapamycin. Moreover, although the extent of internalization of the L193A/P194A mutant was less than that of the wild-type receptors (compare Figs. 1 and 3), which is likely due to both differential receptor expression as well as clonal variation, the rate constant for the L193A/P194A mutant (in the absence of rapamycin) was in fact slightly higher than that for the wild type (0.063versus 0.048 min−1, respectively). This is consistent with the hypothesis that through binding to the type I receptor, FKBP12 functions as a negative regulator of TGF-β receptor endocytosis. The kinase activity of the type II receptor provides an obligate function for optimal TGF-β receptor internalization in AKR-2B fibroblasts (21.Anders R.A. Doré Jr., J.J.E. Arline S.L. Garamszegi N. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23118-23125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, additional studies have shown that FKBP12 is slowly released from the type I receptor upon ligand stimulation and type I receptor phosphorylation (15.Chen Y.G. Liu F. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3866-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 16.Wang T.W. Li B.Y. Danielson P.D. Shah P.C. Rockwell S. Lechleider R.J. Martin J. Manganaro T. Donahoe P.K. Cell. 1996; 86: 435-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). We thus hypothesized that besides phosphorylating the type I receptor to initiate the signaling cascade, the type II receptor kinase is also able to enhance receptor internalization via mechanisms such as promoting the dissociation of FKBP12, a negative regulator of internalization. This hypothesis prompted the studies shown in Fig. 5, where TGF-β receptor internalization was tested in cell lines expressing mutant chimeric type II receptors (K277R and P525L) unable to phosphorylate an associated type I receptor. The results show that rapamycin significantly enhanced internalization in the absence of chimeric type II receptor kinase activity. Although the extent of internalization was less than that observed for wild-type chimeric receptors (Fig. 1), indicating either multiple functions of the receptor kinase or clonal variation in internalization rates, the data support an action of rapamycin downstream of the type II receptor kinase. To date, the physiological role(s) of FK506-binding proteins remains elusive. They have been implicated in assisting protein folding and immunosuppression and as components of multisubunit assemblies (11.Göthel S.F. Marahiel M.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 423-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar,12.Kay J.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). For example, FKBP12 was demonstrated to associate with the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor, and the release of FKBP12 by treatment with FK506 or rapamycin enhanced spontaneous calcium efflux and sensitivity to inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (32.Cameron A.M. Steiner J.P. Sabatini D.M. Kaplin A.I. Walensky L.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1784-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). It was thus proposed that the primary purpose of this family of peptidylprolylcistrans isomerases is to interact with a proline residue and to hold the peptidylprolyl bond in a transition state to modulate partner activity through affecting its conformation. Similarly, one possibility might be that the interaction between FKBP12 and the type I receptor serves to maintain a certain conformation of the receptor such that it is not recognized by the endocytic machinery. However, upon ligand stimulation and transphosphorylation by the type II receptor, FKBP12 would then be released from the type I receptor, resulting in a receptor conformation amenable to the binding of various endocytic molecules. The present studies suggest a new role for FKBP12 as a negative regulator of TGF-β receptor internalization. Moreover, the data further indicate that the transphosphorylation activity of the type II receptor functions to remove this negative regulation. Although the mechanism(s) by which FKBP12 binding prevents internalization is unknown, current work in the laboratory is directed to identifying the nature of these presumptive endocytic molecules and thecis-acting receptor elements to which they bind.

Considering a metabolic pathway, a basic question is, “Are the enzymes and the metabolites randomly dispersed inside the cell, or is there a cellular organization such that the sequential enzymes of this pathway remain in a close proximity allowing especially the intermediary metabolites to be passed directly from one enzyme of the sequence to the next one?” Whereas no direct evidence has ever supported the view of the cell as a bag of uniformly dispersed enzymes, the general concept of an intracellular organization of enzymes and channeling of intermediates has in many respects received support from a large body of experimental data during the last 20 years (reviewed in Refs. 1.Srere P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 89-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 2.Ovádi J. Cell Architecture and Metabolic Channeling. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1995Google Scholar, 3.Srere P.A. Sherry A.D. Malloy C.R. Sumegi B. Agius L. Sherratt H.S.A. Channeling in Intermediary Metabolism. Portland Press Ltd., London1997: 201-217Google Scholar). This type of organization is often referred to as “microcompartmentation” (4.Jones D.P. Microcompartmentation. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1988Google Scholar), and the term “metabolon” has been introduced (5.Srere P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1985; 10: 109-110Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (244) Google Scholar) to describe supramolecular complexes of sequential metabolic enzymes and structural components. Such “integrated” pathways may present important advantages for metabolic integration and regulation, such as protection of labile intermediates, prevention of intermediates from escaping into the bulk solution where they may be sequestered by other enzymes for use in different metabolic pathways, conservation of cellular solvent capacity, reduction of transition times, and enhancement of metabolic fluxes. Experimental data support the existence of metabolons for many metabolic pathways and especially for the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle. For instance, specific interactions have been demonstratedin vitro between six of the eight sequential tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes including citrate synthase (CS)1 and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) (reviewed in Ref. 3.Srere P.A. Sherry A.D. Malloy C.R. Sumegi B. Agius L. Sherratt H.S.A. Channeling in Intermediary Metabolism. Portland Press Ltd., London1997: 201-217Google Scholar). In the last few years, evidence was presented concerning the channeling of oxaloaxetatein vitro between yeast mitochondrial CS (Cit1p) and MDH (Mdh1p) (6.Lindbladh C. Rault M. Hagglund C. Small W.C. Mosbach K. Bülow L. Evans C. Srere P.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11692-11698Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) as well as between the corresponding pig enzymes (7.Morgunov I. Srere P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29540-29544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar,8.Shatalin K. Lebreton S. Rault-Leonardon M. Vélot C. Srere P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, no direct evidence has been obtained in vivo for the interactions between sequential Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, mainly because these interactions are weak and many of the resulting complexes dissociate during isolation due to dilution effects. A possible strategy to demonstrate the in situexistence and the physiological relevance of such complexes is to screen for and characterize mutations that affect specifically these interactions, i.e. mutations that affect the metabolic pathway without affecting the enzymatic activities. Such mutations, which we refer as to “assembly mutations,” have already been isolated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For instance, McCammon (9.McCammon M.T. Genetics. 1996; 144: 57-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who screened for mutants unable to grow on acetate, isolated three mutants with defects in the ACO1 gene (encoding mitochondrial aconitase) that display a wild type level of aconitase activity. Here, we describe the serendipitous isolation of an assembly mutation in the CIT1 gene encoding Cit1p and its characterization using an adaptation and an extension of the transdominant genetic analysis initially described by Caponigro et al. (10.Caponigro G. Abedi M.R. Hurlburt A.P. Maxfield A. Judd W. Kamb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7508-7513Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Transdominant genetic experiments involve introduction and overexpression in wild type cells of small molecules and selection for those that inhibit a particular biological process. This is a new and promising approach to identify and characterize protein interactionsin vivo (10.Caponigro G. Abedi M.R. Hurlburt A.P. Maxfield A. Judd W. Kamb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These authors used expression libraries designed to encode inhibitory proteinaceous molecules (peptides and protein fragments) and performed a selection for those that inhibit the pheromone response pathway in yeast. Peptide and protein fragments that permit cell division in the presence of pheromone were recovered and characterized. Several were derived from proteins that were already known to be involved in the pathway, and other inhibitors represented novel peptide sequences allowing identification of proteins that may negatively influence the pheromone response. To designate collectively the transdominant proteinaceous inhibitors, Caponigro et al. (10.Caponigro G. Abedi M.R. Hurlburt A.P. Maxfield A. Judd W. Kamb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7508-7513Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) introduced the term “perturbagens” by analogy with “mutagens”; instead of producing mutations in genes, perturbagens act at the level of the proteins, disrupting specific biochemical interactions in cells to generate a mutant phenocopy. In fact, a perturbagen acts as the product of a gene carrying a dominant negative mutation (13.Herskowitz I. Nature. 1987; 329: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), i.e. a gene encoding an altered protein that when overexpressed disrupts the function of the wild type protein. The power of the transdominant inhibition analysis lies mainly in three features: (a) the interactions are detected in their physiological context; (b) the physiological relevance of the interaction is directly reflected by the mutant phenocopy resulting from its inhibition; and (c) the identification and the characterization of the perturbagen allows a direct access to the structure of the interaction (i.e. binding site, residues involved, etc.). In this study, we did not use randomly generated perturbagens but rather a specific peptide based on the location of the assembly mutation previously identified in order to confirm that this mutation does affect an interacting site of the enzyme. To identify targets for the inhibitors, Caponigro et al. (10.Caponigro G. Abedi M.R. Hurlburt A.P. Maxfield A. Judd W. Kamb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Here, the interacting partner was identified by searching for proteins that are able, when co-overexpressed with the perturbagen, to reverse the transdominant inhibition (i.e. to restore a wild type phenotype) as a consequence of a “back-titration” of the perturbagen. The results reported here provide the first direct in vivoevidence of interaction between two sequential Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes (Cit1p and Mdh1p) and suggest that the reversible transdominant inhibition method may be a powerful tool to identify weak protein-protein interactions in vivo. TheS. cerevisiae null mutant cit1(cit1::LEU2) and cit1cit2(cit1::LEU2 cit2::URA3) strains used in this study originated from the haploid parental strain FYF5 (MATα ura3–52 leu2Δ1 his3Δ200 trp1Δ63), isogenic to the reference strain S288C (ATCC 26108). FYF5 was used in all the transdominant inhibition experiments. The yeast media were synthetic complete (SC) media prepared as described by Sherman et al. (15.Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar) with either 2% glucose (SCD) or 2% sodium acetate (SCAc) as the carbon source. SCD-U-W and SCAc-U-W were like SCD and SCAc, respectively, but lacked uracil and tryptophan. Rich media consisted of 1% yeast extract and 2% peptone (YP) with either 2% glucose (YPD), 2% (v/v) lactic acid (YPL), or 2% sodium acetate (YPAc) as a carbon source. YPL medium contained also 1% KH2PO4 and was adjusted to pH 5.5 with NaOH. Two percent agar (Difco) was added for plates. Yeast transformations were conducted using the lithium acetate protocol of Gietz et al. (16.Gietz D. St-Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). The host Escherichia coli strain used for cloning was XL1-Blue (recA1, end A1, gyrA96, thi-1, hsdR17, supE44, relA1, lac, [F′ proAB, lacIq lacZΔM15,Tn10(tet r)]). Preparation and transformation of competent cells were performed according to Morrison (17.Morrison A. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 132: 349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial transformant cells were grown on LB plates supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. All of the vectors used in this study are summarized in Table I. All of the constructs were cloned in either pRS314, pRS424, or pRS426. The vectors encoding the hybrid Citp proteins (pRS-C-hCIT2/1 and pRS-C-hcit2/1*) have been performed from pRS-C-CIT1PLS, itself constructed from pRS314. The vector pGAL-CLbGFP was used to amplify the coding region of green fluorescence protein (GFP), alone or fused to the 3′-flanking region ofCIT1. Plasmids used for PCR amplifications ofACO1, CIT1, CIT2, and MDH1sequences were pRS-C-ACO1, pRS-C-CIT1, pRS-C-LSCIT2δSKL, and pRS314/MDH1, respectively.Table IVectors used in this studyNameDescriptionSource or referencepRS314ARS-CEN,TRP1-based yeast-E. coli shuttle vectorRef. 18.Sikorski R.S.

All enzymatic reactions were performed as recommended by the manufacturers (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Life Technologies, Inc., Qiagen, and Stratagene), and all recombinant manipulations were done according to Maniatis et al. (21.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Plasmids were prepared using commercially available kits (Qiagen, Promega). ClonedPfu polymerase (Stratagene) was used in all polymerase chain reaction amplifications, except in those of the construction pRS-C-hcit2/1* that were performed with Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). All of the constructs were sequenced on an ABI 377 automated sequencer. Yeast precultures were grown under selective pressure in synthetic glucose medium (SCD-W or SCD-U-W). Aliquots of the precultures were used to inoculate either 250-ml cultures of a rich medium (YPL or YPAc) or 750-ml cultures of SCD-U-W medium. Cultures were grown to early log phase. Cellular fractionation was performed as described previously (20.Vélot C. Lebreton S. Morgunov I. Usher K.C. Srere P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16195-16204Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial proteins were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose (Protran BA; Schleicher and Schuell). The nitrocellulose membrane was blocked by 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS (1 mm KH2PO4, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.0), incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of a mixture of two mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in PBS containing a final concentration of 2.5% nonfat dry milk (PBS-M), and washed in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T). After incubation with a 1:3000 dilution of a goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in PBS-M, and rinsing in PBS-T, the membrane was developed with the ECL method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Enzyme activities for citrate synthase, aconitase, malate dehydrogenase, and NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase were determined spectrophotometrically as described by Srere et al. (22.Srere P.A.

Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 562 nm using the BCA protein assay as described by Smith et al. (26.Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H.

Genes CIT1 and CIT2 from S. cerevisiae encode mitochondrial and peroxisomal forms of CS involved in the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle and glyoxylate pathway, respectively. Cit1p has been shown to bind to the inner surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane, while Cit2p does not possess such binding abilities (27.Kispal G. Srere P.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In attempt to define the region of Cit1p responsible for its binding to the inner mitochondrial membrane, we have constructed different hybrid proteins between Cit1p and Cit2p. It was in the context of this work that the following plasmid construction, which led us to the serendipitous isolation of an assembly mutation in the CIT1 gene, was performed. This plasmid was constructed from pRS314 (18.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a centromere-based vector carrying the yeast TRP1 gene as a selectable marker, and designed to encode a chimeric Citp protein including the 40 first amino acids of Cit1p (mitochondrial targeting presequence) fused to the N-terminal third of Cit2p (177 residues) followed by the C-terminal two-thirds of Cit1p (283 residues). The polymerase chain reaction amplifications of the fragment containing codons 1–177 of theCIT2 gene and of that including the last 283 codons ofCIT1 and its 3′-flanking region were first performed withTaq DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the subsequent sequencing of the construct revealed the presence of mutations in the chimeric coding region. The resulting plasmid, where the CIT1 promoter drives the expression of a gene encoding a mutated hybrid Citp protein (hCitp*), was termed pRS-C-hcit2/1*. The same construct was performed again but using cloned Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), which is known to exhibit the lowest error rate of any thermostable polymerase (28.Flaman J.M. Frebourg T. Moreau V. Charbonnier F. Martin C. Ishioka C. Friend S.H. Iggo R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3259-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The sequencing of the resulting construct, termed pRS-C-hCIT2/1, did not reveal the presence of any mutation. These two plasmids as well as pRS-C-CIT1 encoding native Cit1p (20.Vélot C. Lebreton S. Morgunov I. Usher K.C. Srere P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16195-16204Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were used to transform the yeast null mutants Δcit1 andΔcit1 Δcit2, which do not grow on acetate as the sole carbon source (29.Kispal G. Rozenkrantz M. Guarente L. Srere P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11145-11149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a phenotype symptomatic of a Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle defect in S. cerevisiae. The resulting Trp+ transformants were tested for their ability to grow on acetate medium (SCAc). The same complementation results were obtained with both mutant strains, and only those obtained with the double mutant strain are shown (Fig. 1). The construct encoding native Cit1p (pRS-C-CIT1) as well as that encoding the “wild type” hybrid Citp (pRS-C-hCIT2/1) were able to fully restore the ability of the mutant to utilize acetate. However, the complementation observed with the construct encoding hCitp* (pRS-C-hcit2/1*) was significantly less. To get more precise information on the ability of these transformants to grow on acetate, a growth curve in rich acetate medium was performed for each of them, as well as for wild type (WT) and double mutant (Δcit1 Δcit2) strains as positive and negative controls, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the transformant harboring the plasmid pRS-C-hcit2/1* grew much more poorly with a significantly increased lag time and exhibited a decreased cell density in stationary phase when compared with the transformants expressing either native Cit1p or “wild type” hCitp. Mitochondrial and cytosolic CS activities were determined in these three Δcit1 Δcit2 transformants as well as in parental wild type and mutant strains (as controls). As shown in TableII, the transformant expressing the plasmid-encoded native Cit1p protein displayed more mitochondrial CS activity than the wild type strain. This is a common observation, probably due to the fact that a centromere-based plasmid is generally present in slightly more than one copy per cell. Similar cellular levels of CS activity were found in the transformant expressing “wild type” hCitp. Indeed, the transformant expressing the mutated hCitp* protein displayed less mitochondrial CS activity than the other transformants. But, interestingly, this difference cannot explain the difference observed for acetate utilization between these transformants, since the mutated hybrid protein nevertheless displayed a level of mitochondrial CS activity comparable with that of the original parental strain, which clearly grows on acetate. Moreover, a collection of hybrid forms of Citp actually available in the laboratory indicate that only a minimum of 20% of wild type mitochondrial CS activity level is required to obtain full growth on acetate. For instance, we have recently reported (20.Vélot C. Lebreton S. Morgunov I. Usher K.C. Srere P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16195-16204Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) that a Δcit1 Δcit2 mutant strain expressing a mitochondrial mislocalized form of Cit2p grows fully on acetate with only 26% of wild type CS activity.Table IIIntracellular levels of CS activity in the transformants expressing the plasmid-encoded Citp proteins and in the wild type and mutant parental strainsStrain genotypePlasmid (centromeric)CS activityaSpecific CS activities are expressed in nmol of citrate formed per min per mg of mitochondrial or cytosolic proteins ± S.E. of three independent experiments.MitochondriabMitochondrial and cytosolic extracts were prepared from cells grown in rich lactate medium and harvested in early log phase.CytosolbMitochondrial and cytosolic extracts were prepared from cells grown in rich lactate medium and harvested in early log phase.WT—1800 ± 31048 ± 18Δcit1 Δcit2—26 ± 104 ± 3Δcit1 Δcit2pRS-C-CIT13640 ± 509120 ± 50Δcit1 Δcit2pRS-hCIT2/13253 ± 453175 ± 74Δcit1 Δcit2pRS-hcit2/1*1930 ± 356161 ± 64a Specific CS activities are expressed in nmol of citrate formed per min per mg of mitochondrial or cytosolic proteins ± S.E. of three independent experiments.b Mitochondrial and cytosolic extracts were prepared from cells grown in rich lactate medium and harvested in early log phase. Open table in a new tab These results indicate that the mutation affecting the chimericCIT2/1 gene we have constructed here shows no correspondence between the level of mitochondrial CS activity and the ability of the corresponding cells to grow fully on acetate. In other words, we have isolated an altered form of Cit1p that, although fully catalytically active, does affect the metabolic process in which it is involved (i.e. the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle). Consequently, this mutation is designated an assembly mutation. The sequencing of the chimeric CIT2/1 gene from vector pRS-C-hcit2/1* revealed the deletion of three bases within the CIT1 coding region (Fig. 3): G1069 (codon 357), G1075 (codon 359), and A1089 (codon 363). Since these three bases are not consecutive, these deletions result not only in the loss of one residue in the encoded protein but also in a change of sequence of five consecutive amino acid residues, as illustrated in Fig. 3. We termed this mutation cit1Δ3. The whole peptide shown in Fig. 3 (from Pro354 to Pro366) is fully conserved in Cit2p and in pig heart CS, where it forms a solvent exposed loop (from Pro316 to Pro328) between two α-helixes in the three-dimensional structure. Thus, this peptide represents a possible interacting site with other proteins. Two other point mutations were identified in the CIT2 coding region, resulting in two amino acid substitutions, A92T and T166A. Since these two residues are not in regions that are conserved in Cit1p, we assumed that these mutations were probably not relevant for the observed assembly mutation phenotype and concentrated our efforts on the further characterization of cit1Δ3. In order to further characterize the cit1Δ3 mutation and, more precisely, to determine if this mutation does affect an enzyme-enzyme interacting site relevant for the metabolic pathway in which Cit1p is involved, we have used a strategy derived from the transdominant genetic analysis described by Caponigro et al. (10.Caponigro G. Abedi M.R. Hurlburt A.P. Maxfield A. Judd W. Kamb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7508-7513Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The principle of this strategy was to test the ability of a peptide encompassing the mutation site of cit1Δ3 to behave as a transdominant inhibitor (a perturbagen) of the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle, i.e. to evaluate the ability of this peptide, when overexpressed in cells, to inhibit the growth on acetate of a wild type strain. The peptide we have chosen to test is a 15-amino acid peptide (termed Pept1) corresponding to the wild type sequence shown in Fig. 3 plus one residue on the amino terminus (Val353) and one residue on the carboxyl terminus (Arg367). Peptides can be stably expressed inside the cell as fusions with an inert carrier protein as, for instance, the adsorption protein (pIII) of fd phage (30.Cwirla S.E. Peters E.A. Barrett R.W.

In this study, we expressed Pept1 as a C-terminal fusion with GFP. In fact, the total sequence fused to GFP coding region encoded a 19-amino acid peptide because of four construction residues encoded by twoHpaI restriction sites that were introduced just upstream and downstream of the sequence encoding Pept1.

APP is a precursor protein of β-amyloid (Aβ), whose deposition and accumulation in the brain are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (reviewed in Refs. 3.Shoulson I.

While the mechanisms regulating the proteolytic cleavage of APP and secretion of Aβ are as yet not well understood, we and others recently reported that X11 (6.Borg J.-P. Yang Y. de Taddeo-Borg M.

The phosphotyrosine interaction domain of X11L interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of APP, and the PDZ (a repeated sequences in the brain-specific protein PSD-95, the Drosophilaseptate junction protein disks-large, and the epithelial tight junction protein ZO-1) domains of X11L are essential for the modulation of Aβ production (2.Tomita S.

However, the exact regulatory mechanism of Aβ production by X11L has yet to be resolved. In this study, we isolated only NF-κB/p65 from the multiple isoforms of NF-κB from a human brain cDNA library and found that it interacts with the PDZ domain of hX11L. We also found that NF-κB/p65 induces the increased secretion of Aβ42, but not Aβ40, and that this could be suppressed by the expression of X11L due to trapping of NF-κB by its binding to X11L. Since NF-κB acts as a transcriptional regulator for genes participating in cell death and/or survival (reviewed in Ref. 8.Schneider A. Martin-Villalba A. Weih F. Vogel J. Wirth T. Schwaninger M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 554-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), our findings provide new insights regarding the regulation of NF-κB activity for neuronal survival and the mechanisms controlling Aβ production in the brains of AD patients. The protocol for yeast two-hybrid screening using MATCH MAKER Two-Hybrid System (CLONTECH) has been described previously (2.Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S. Takeda S. Yagi Y. Sakiyama S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2243-2254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In brief, cDNA encoding PDZ domain (amino acid sequence 556–749) from hX11L was inserted into pGBT9, and this was used as a “bait” plasmid to isolate cDNA of PDZ-binding proteins from a human adult brain cDNA library cloned into the vector pGAD424, which contains the GAL4 transactivation domain. Both plasmids were co-transfected into yeast cells, and colonies whose HIS3 and LacZreporter genes were activated were selected. Plasmids from positive clones were re-transfected into Escherichia coli, the nucleotide sequence was determined, and from this NF-κB/p65 was identified as a candidate PDZ-binding protein. To identify the PDZ that interacts with NF-κB/p65, the pGAD424NF-κB/p65 bait plasmid was co-transfected into yeast with pGBT9 “prey” plasmid containing either a region of PDZ1+2 (amino acid positions 556–749), PDZ1 (amino acid positions 556–655), PDZ2 (amino acid positions 656–749), or plasmid alone. Co-transfectants were streaked on the selective medium lacking Trp, Leu, and His or control medium lacking Trp and Leu and clones growing on the selective medium were observed. The rabbit polyclonal anti-X11L antibodies UT-29, UT-30, and UT-50 were raised against hX11L peptides 207–223, 735–749, and 538–554, respectively. The specificity of UT-29 and UT-30 has been previously described (2.Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S. Takeda S. Yagi Y. Sakiyama S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol.

A rabbit polyclonal anti-κB/p65 antibody, sc-109 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), and anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 were purchased from the Eastman Kodak Co. COS7 cells (∼1 × 107 cells) were co-transfected for 18 h in LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 2 μg each of the following plasmids: pcDNA3-hX11L and pcDNA3-NF-κB/p65 (Fig.1 c), pcDNA3-hX11L and pcDNA3-FLAG-RHDp65 (Fig.1 d) and/or pcDNA3-FLAG-RHDp50 (Fig. 2 a), and pcDNA3-hX11L, pcDNA3-p65, and pcDNA3-FLAG-RHDp65 or pcDNA3-FLAG-RHDp50 (Fig. 2 b). After changing the medium, the cells were cultured for 48 h. The cells were then harvested, lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm CHAPS, 5 μg/ml chymostatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm NaF) for 30 min on ice, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The polyclonal antibodies (20 μg) or anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (40 μg) were added to the supernatant (which contained approximately 1 mg of protein) and incubated on ice for 1 h. Immunocomplexes binding to the rabbit and mouse antibodies were recovered using protein A- or protein G-Sepharose beads, respectively, and revealed by immunoblot using the indicated antibodies.Figure 2Non-interaction of X11L with NF-κB/p50 and with a heterodimer consisting of p50 and p65 subunits. a, co-immunoprecipitation of hX11L and FLAG-RHD construct derived from NF-κB/p50 and NF-κB/p65. COS7 cells transiently expressing hX11L and FLAG-tagged RHD constructs derived from NF-κB/p50 (FLAG-RHD(p50)) or NF-κB/p65 (FLAG-RHD(p65)) were lysed and the crude lysate was used for immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-FLAG antibody M2. The lysate (crude, left panel) and immunoprecipitates (IP, right panel) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-X11L antibody UT-29 (upper panel) and M2 (lower panel).

The cells were supplied with fresh growth medium 12 h after the start of transfection, and conditioned medium from cells (2 × 106 cells) was collected 72 h after the medium change. Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides secreted into the medium (100 μl) were quantified by sandwich ELISA (9.Tomita S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol.

Expression of hX11L and FLAG-p65 was examined by immunoblot analysis of cell lysate with UT-29 and anti-FLAG antibody M2. The relative ratios of the levels of Aβ observed using cells transfected with the pcDNA3 vector alone were determined. One of the p55IgkLuc, pActLuc, and pIFNLuc reporter construct plasmids (1.25 μg) together with any two of the effector plasmids (each 1.25 μg), pcDNA3-FLAG-NF-κB/p65, pcDNA3-hX11L, and pcDNA3, were triply transfected into either HEK293 cells stably expressing human APP695 or human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (∼5 × 105 cells/well in 24-well dishes). The cells were supplied with fresh growth medium 12 h after the start of transfection. After 48 h, the culture medium was removed and cell lysis buffer (100 μl) was added. Luciferase activity in the cell lysate was assayed using Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and measured with Luminometer (11.Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Lion H.-C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1354-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Results were expressed in an arbitrary unit. EMSA was performed with a procedure described previously (12.Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide Ig κ containing self-complementary region was radiolabeled with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, and the labeled probe was self-annealed. HEK293 cells (∼2 × 106cells) were transfected with pcDNA3-FLAG-NF-κB/p65, pcDNA3-FLAG-NF-κBmut encoding p65 carrying the ALA substitution of the 75-SLV-77 sequence, or pcDNA3 as described above. After 48 h, the cells were collected and nuclear extract was prepared (13.Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5–2 μl (approximately 0.3–1.2 μg of protein) of nuclear extract, and 2–4 fmol of 32P-labeled probe. The mixture was incubated and loaded to 4% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel (12.Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Expression of FLAG-NF-κB/p65 and FLAG-NF-κBmut was examined by Western blot using whole cell extracts and anti-FLAG antibody M2. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, cDNA encoding full-length NF-κB/p65 interacting with the PDZ domain of hX11L was isolated. The hX11L protein contains two PDZ domains (Fig.1 a) (2.Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S. Takeda S. Yagi Y. Sakiyama S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2243-2254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and the His reporter gene assay demonstrated that it was the most carboxyl-terminal domain (PDZ2) that was responsible for the interaction with NF-κB/p65 (Fig.1 b). Interaction of hX11L and NF-κB/p65 in mammalian cells was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig.1 c). COS7 cells that transiently express hX11L and NF-κB/p65 were lysed and the co-precipitation assay performed. The hX11L protein was detected in the sample immunoprecipitated with the anti-NF-κB/p65 antibody, sc-109. NF-κB/p65 was also detected in the sample immunoprecipitated with two of the anti-hX11L antibodies UT-29 and UT-50, but detection with the third, UT-30, was weak because UT-30 competes with NF-κB for the recognition sequence. Neither hX11L nor NF-κB/p65 could be detected in the sample immunoprecipitated using non-immune rabbit antibodies, indicating that the co-immunoprecipitation of hX11L and NF-κB/p65 was specific. NF-κB/p65 consists of a Rel homology domain (RHD), a nuclear localization signal (NLS), and transcription activator domain (TA) (Fig. 1 a) (reviewed in Refs. 14.Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar and 15.Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R19-R22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the RHD participated in the binding of NF-κB/p65 to hX11L, we performed another co-immunoprecipitation experiment using COS7 cells co-expressing hX11L and the RHD tagged with a FLAG sequence at their amino-terminal ends (Fig. 1 d). The expression of the FLAG constructs of RHD and hX11L could be detected in the crude cell lysate (data not shown). When the lysate from cells expressing FLAG-RHD was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody M2, the hX11L protein could also be detected (Fig. 1 d, wt), indicating that some sequence in RHD can interact with PDZ2 of hX11L. It is known that PDZ generally binds to S/T-X-I/V (class I), F/Y-X-A/F/V (class II), and D-X-V or Y-X-A/F motifs (class III) within target proteins (16.Oschkinat H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 408-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 17.Tochio H. Zhang Q. Mandel P. Li M. Zhang M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar); and based on this, four potential PDZ-binding sequences, 75-SLV-77, 141-FQV-143, 161-FQV-163, and 217-DKV-219, were found in the NF-κB/p65 RHD (Fig. 1 d). To determine which of these sites was important in PDZ binding, an alanine mutation was introduced in each candidate motif. When the 161-FQV-163 motif was altered to AQA, the anti-FLAG antibody failed to pull down hX11L (Fig. 1 d,161-FQV-163→AQA). The other motif mutants pull down hX11L as well as the non-mutated FLAG-RHD (wt). Thus, PDZ2 of hX11L recognizes and binds to the 161-FQV-163 motif in the RHD of NF-κB/p65. Since NF-κB can function as homo- and heterodimers of p65 and/or p50 (reviewed in Ref. 18.Grilli M. Goffi F. Memo M. Spano P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15002-15007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), we assessed whether the p50 subunit is as able to bind to the PDZ domain of X11L as the p65 subunit. For this purpose, FLAG constructs of RHD from NF-κB/p50 (FLAG-RHD(p50)) and hX11L were expressed transiently in COS7 cells. When FLAG-RHD(p50) was isolated from cell lysate by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody, hX11L could not be detected in the precipitate (Fig.2 a). Thus, X11L associates with the p65 but not the p50 subunit of NF-κB. Consistent with this finding is the observation that the p50 subunit does not contain the PDZ binding motif found in p65 (data not shown). To determine whether the heterodimer of NF-κB/p65 and p50 can associate with X11L, COS7 cells were transiently and triply transfected with pcDNA3-hX11L and pcDNA3-NF-κB/p65 together with either pcDNA3FLAG-RHD(p50) or pcDNA3FLAG-RHD(p65). The protein lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody M2 and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblot with the anti-X11L antibody UT-29, the anti-p65 antibody sc-109 and M2 (Fig. 2 b). When cells expressed FLAG-RHD(p65), both NF-κB/p65 and X11L could also be detected in the precipitate. However, when cells were expressed with FLAG-RHD(p50), NF-κB/p65, but not X11L, could be detected in the precipitate. Thus, NF-κB/p65 associates with FLAG-RHD(p50), but this heterodimer cannot bind to X11L. Although we did not determine whether the NF-κB/p65 homodimer is able to associate with X11L, the present results suggest that only monomeric NF-κB/p65, not homo- and heterodimers, can interact with X11L. It is known that X11L is a potential modulator of Aβ production (2.Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S. Takeda S. Yagi Y. Sakiyama S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2243-2254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and that NF-κB acts as a transcriptional activator of many genes (reviewed in Refs. 14.Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar and 15.Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R19-R22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of NF-κB/p65 on the generation of both Aβ40 and Aβ42. HEK293 cells that stably expressed human APP695 were transiently co-transfected with any two combinations of cDNA encoding hX11L, NF-κB/p65 with a FLAG tag (FLAG-p65) and vector alone. At 72 h, a sandwich ELISA was used to quantify Aβ40 and Aβ42 secreted into the medium. That hX11L and FLAG-p65 were expressed was verified by immunoblot analysis using UT-29 and M2 (data not shown). The negative control consisted of the Aβ released by cells containing pcDNA3 together with pcDNA3. This amount was set at 1.0 and levels in test samples related to this (Fig.3). NF-κB/p65 alone increased the level of Aβ42 but not Aβ40. As expected and reported previously, hX11L did not alter the level of Aβ42 but slightly decreased the level of Aβ40 (2.Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S. Takeda S. Yagi Y. Sakiyama S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2243-2254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, when hX11L was co-transfected with NF-κB/p65, the NF-κB/p65-induced secretion of Aβ42 was suppressed. The secretion level of Aβ40 was not, however, altered in this situation. Thus, NF-κB/p65 may activate the expression of one or more genes participating in Aβ42 production and hX11L is able to suppress this. Whether hX11L can suppress κB motif-dependent gene activation was examined with a reporter gene assay using non-neuronal (HEK293) and neuronal (SH-SY5Y) cells (Fig.4). HEK293 cells stably express human APP695 and SH-SY5Y cells express endogenous APP. These cells were transfected with either the positive reporter plasmid p55IgκLuc, which consists of three tandemly repeated κB motifs upstream of a minimal interferon-β promoter (−55 to +19) and the luciferase structural gene (Fig. 4 a) (11.Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Lion H.-C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1354-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), or the κB-independent reporter plasmids pActLuc and pIFNLuc as negative controls. The reporter plasmid was co-transfected transiently with NF-κB/p65 and hX11L genes (Fig. 4, b and c). When FLAG-p65 was present, transcription of the reporter gene p55IgkLuc was activated. When pActLuc and pIFNLuc, reporter genes containing defective κB motifs, were used instead of p55IgκLuc, no effect on gene activation by NF-κB was observed, indicating that the activation of the reporter gene depends on the κB motif. The κB motif-dependent activation of genes was also supported with an electrophoretic mobility-shift assay (Fig. 5). When p65 was present, specific complex composed of p65 and a probe containing κB motif was observed, which definitely demonstrated NF-κB/p65 in the nucleus.Figure 5Binding activity of NF-κB/p65 to κB-motif. a, nuclear extract (lane 1, 0.5 μl; lane 2, 1.0 μl; lane 3, 2.0 μl) derived from HEK293 cells that express FLAG-NF-κB/p65 (p65), FLAG-NF-κB/p65mut (p65mut) encoding p65 carrying the ALA substitution of the 75-SLV-77 sequence, and vector alone (vector) was subjected to EMSA using32P-labeled probe containing the Ig κ κB motif.b, nuclear extract (2 μl each) was subjected to EMSA in the presence (+) or the absence (−) of 100-fold excess of unlabeled probe.

The asterisk indicates an unrelated complex composing of DNA-repair protein Ku (S. Tomita, T. Fujita, Y. Kirino, and T. Suzuki, unpublished observation). c, whole cell extract (∼5 μg of protein) was assayed by Western blot with anti-FLAG antibody M2. The arrow indicates FLAG-NF-κB/p65 protein. Transfection was performed in duplicate and FLAG-NF-κB/p65 expresses 4-fold higher than FLAG-NF-κB/p6 NF-κB/65mut.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Transfection with hX11L alone did not activate any of the reporter genes used (data not shown). However, when hX11L was co-transfected with FLAG-p65, activation of the reporter gene p55IgκLuc was partly suppressed. Identical results were obtained with non-neuronal HEK293 (Fig. 4 b) and neuronal SH-SY5Y (Fig. 4 c) cells, which do not express the endogenous X11L. These results show that NF-κB may increase the production of Aβ42 via κB motif-dependent transcriptional activation of certain gene(s) and further suggest that hX11L may inhibit this process by binding NF-κB to its PDZ domain, thereby retaining NF-κB in the cytoplasm and impeding its translocation into the nucleus. Further supporting the notion that Aβ42 production depends on genes activation by NF-κB is the finding that the mutant NF-κB containing an ALA substitution in the 75-SLV-77 sequence (whose binding to X11L is not impaired (Fig. 1 d)) failed to activate κB motif-dependent genes and did not enhance Aβ42 production (Fig. 6). This mutant NF-κB has lost an ability to bind to κB motif (Fig. 5). In our previous study (2.Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S. Takeda S. Yagi Y. Sakiyama S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2243-2254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), X11L was found to bind to the cytoplasmic domain of APP and regulate Aβ production. It has also been demonstrated by others that X11 modulates APP metabolism (6.Borg J.-P. Yang Y. de Taddeo-Borg M. Margolis B. Turner R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14761-14766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 7.Sastre M. Turner R.S. Levy E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22351-22357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). From these observations, we hypothesized that X11L may regulate Aβ production by complexing with APP and that the PDZ domains in X11L may play an important role in this process (2.Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S. Takeda S. Yagi Y. Sakiyama S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2243-2254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It was, however, not clear whether X11L regulates APP processing by directly interacting with APP or via other, as yet unidentified, proteins. To this aim, we used yeast two-hybrid screening to identify proteins able to bind to the PDZ of X11L and thus identified NF-κB/p65 as a PDZ-binder. NF-κB/p65 could induce the production of Aβ42 through κB motif-dependent gene activation. The 5′-regulatory region of the APP gene contains two NF-κB binding sequences (18.Grilli M. Goffi F. Memo M. Spano P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15002-15007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and NF-κB might thus be expected to increase the expression of APP and concomitantly result in increased levels of Aβ42. However, this is not the case because when HEK293 cells stably expressing APP695 under the control of cytomegalovirus enhancer-promoter are transiently transfected with NF-κB/p65, the production of Aβ40 is not changed, while the production of Aβ42 is increased. Furthermore, overexpression of NF-κB/p65 did not alter the synthesis and maturation of APP695 (data not shown), and the κB sites of APP gene interact with NF-κB/p50 but not NF-κB/p65 (18.Grilli M. Goffi F. Memo M. Spano P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15002-15007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The observations suggest the significance that NF-κB signaling system connects to Aβ42 generation by activating expression of gene(s), which encodes protein concerning with a γ-secretase pathway, and also support the concept of two independent γ-secretases. Expression of the neuron-specific protein X11L suppressed the transcriptional activity by NF-κB/p65 and inhibited Aβ42 production. This suggests that X11L binds to NF-κB/p65 with its PDZ domain, thus suppressing the capacity of NF-κB to induce expression of protein(s) involved in Aβ42 production in the neuron. We were not able to detect a triple complex consisting of APP, X11L, and NF-κB/p65 by co-immunoprecipitation with their respective antibodies (data not shown), indicating that NF-κB/p65 binds to X11L in the absence of APP. In addition, a mutant NF-κB/p65 with alanine substitutions in the 75-SLV-77 sequence failed to induce both Aβ42 production and κB motif-dependent gene activation despite its ability to associate with X11L. Thus, it is unlikely that X11L acts to suppress NF-κB/p65-mediated activation of Aβ42 production by forming a triple complex with APP and NF-κB/p65 and also unlikely that NF-κB/p65 regulates APP metabolism directly in the absence of transcriptional activation. There may be another regulatory mechanism, independent of gene activation, that suppresses Aβ40 production through a triple complex consisting of APP, X11L, and an unidentified PDZ-binding protein (2.Tomita S.

It is well known that target genes of NF-κB participate in the immune system (reviewed in Refs. 14.Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar and 15.Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R19-R22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and increasing evidence indicates that a wide variety of members of the NF-κB family play a role in the neuronal system (reviewed in Ref. 19.O'Neill L.A.J. Kaltschmidt C. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 252-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Since inflammation is though to be a cause of AD, it may be that brain inflammation activates NF-κB and thus induces Aβ42 production. Although the activity of NF-κB/p65 is generally regulated by its association with IκB (reviewed in Refs. 14.Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar and 15.Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R19-R22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a constitutive, uncomplexed form of NF-κB has been observed in cortical and hippocampal neurons (20.Rattner A. Korner M. Walker M.D. Citri Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4261-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 21.Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Neumann H. Wekerle H. Baeuerle P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3981-3992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which are the cells that undergo the characteristic degeneration in AD. Furthermore, Aβ can activate NF-κB in neurons (22.Behl C. Davis J.B. Lesley R. Schubert D. Cell. 1994; 77: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2052) Google Scholar, 23.Yan S.D. Chen X. Fu J. Chen M. Zhu H. Roher A. Slattery T. Zhao L. Nagashima M. Morser J. Migheli A. Nawroyh P. Stern D. Schmidt A.M. Nature. 1996; 382: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (1827) Google Scholar), and activated NF-κB is found only in cells in close vicinity to early senile plaques of AD patients (24.Kaltschmidt B. Uherek M. Volk B. Baeuerle P.A. Kaltschmidt C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2642-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). In addition, NF-κB contributes to neuronal cell death (8.Schneider A. Martin-Villalba A. Weih F. Vogel J. Wirth T. Schwaninger M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 554-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These observations together with our present results argue strongly for the participation of NF-κB in AD pathogenesis. Given the inhibitory role of X11L on NF-κB-induced Aβ42 production, this neuron-specific protein (2.Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S. Takeda S. Yagi Y. Sakiyama S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2243-2254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) could be used as a specific drug target for the treatment of AD rather than NF-κB, which is expressed ubiquitously. NF-κB can form homo- or heterodimers consisting of p65 and/or p50 subunits and binds to DNA (reviewed in Refs. 14.Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar and 15.Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R19-R22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We showed that the p50 subunit and a heterodimer consisting of p65 and p50 could not bind to the PDZ domain of X11L. X11L may thus be an anchor protein specific for monomeric NF-κB/p65, although it is remains to be seen if X11L can bind p65 homodimers. In many protein-protein interactions involving PDZ domain recognition, the PDZ domain associates with carboxyl termini of proteins such as those occurring in receptors or channels (25.Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar, 26.Schultz J. Hoffmller U.

However, a recent report has revealed that PDZ domains can also bind to non-terminal consensus motifs such as those of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) (15.Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R19-R22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Oschkinat H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 408-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The PDZ domains of X11L also recognized to non-terminal motif in NF-κB/p65. The interaction between NF-κB/p65 and X11L indicates a novel function for the PDZ domain in that it is involved in regulation of protein metabolism via transcriptional activation. Since NF-κB is thought to regulate cell death or survival through activation of several types of genes, analysis of the molecular mechanism(s) of NF-κB activation in neuronal cell is important in the understanding of neurologic disease such as AD.

Regulation of c-FOS expression is tightly dependent on the serum response element localized within its promoter. Two transcription factors, the serum response factor (SRF) and the ternary complex factor, bind to the serum response element and play a key role in the regulation of the c-FOS promoter activity. In the present study, we show that two death effectors (CH11 and TRAIL) severely impaired the transcriptional activity of the c-FOSpromoter in Jurkat T cells. This inhibition can be accounted for by the specific cleavage by caspase 3 of the SRF both in vitro andin vivo, since acetyl-DEVD-aldehyde prevented SRF cleavage and abolished the inhibitory effect of CH11 and TRAIL on the c-FOS promoter activity. Moreover, phorbol myristate acetate, a potent anti-apoptotic effector, was found to protect SRF completely from cleavage by caspase 3 and also to prevent the inhibition of the c-FOS promoter activity by death effectors. Survival factors play an essential function in the regulation of cell growth mainly by regulating the expression of immediate early gene such as c-FOS. In this line, cleavage of SRF at the onset of apoptosis could abrogate the ability of the cell to induce inappropriate survival pathways.

Notably, the family of immediate early genes, among which we find c-FOS, are rapidly activated, within minutes, in response to mitogenic stimuli such as serum, phorbol esters, lysophosphatidic acid, and growth factors (1.Hill C.S.

Induction of c-FOS is widely dependent on the serum response element (SRE)1 located within its promoter. Two transcription factors, the serum response factor (SRF) and the ternary complex factor (TCF), bind to the SRE and stimulate the transcriptional activity of the c-FOS promoter (4.Shaw P.E.

SRF is ubiquitously expressed and binds as a dimer to the CarG box of the SRE sequence. The central core of SRF contains the DNA binding and dimerization domains, whereas the trans-activation domain critically required for full signal-induced response is located within the C terminus part (3.Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 7.Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). The TCF belongs to the proteins of the Ets domain family including Elk-1 (8.Hipskind R.A. Rao V.N. Mueller C.G.F. Reddy E.S.P. Nordheim A. Nature. 1991; 354: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), SRF accessory protein 1 (9.Dalton S. Treisman R.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1502-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). TCF associates with the SRF via a region located in the dimerization domain of SRF and binds to a purine-rich sequence (CAGGAT) at the 5′ end of the SRE (11.Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3283-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Mutations of the SRE site in the c-FOS promoter dramatically affect the c-FOSresponse to diverse stimuli demonstrating the key function of SRE in the regulation of c-FOS promoter activity. Until now, two alternative pathways have been described to converge to the SRE and regulate the transcriptional activity of c-FOS promoter. First, activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38MAPK, by mitogenic and stress signals leads to phosphorylation of the TCF proteins and stimulation of their transcriptional activity (12.Gille H.

In a second pathway that is independent of TCF, SRF can integrate, via the Rho family of small GTPase, signals from the mitogen lysophosphatidic acid (1.Hill C.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5037-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Apoptosis or programmed cell death is a physiological process to eliminate unwanted or superfluous cells from the organism. It plays a crucial role in embryogenesis, in the development of the nervous system, in adult tissue homeostasis, and in the regulation of the immune system. When deregulated, apoptosis has been involved in the pathogenesis of a number of human diseases including cancers, neurodegenerative disorders, and autoimmune diseases (17.Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6179) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is characterized by cytoplasmic shrinkage, membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, and nuclear DNA fragmentation and culminates in cellular death. The molecular mechanisms involved in apoptosis regulation have been extensively studied. From these studies, it appears that the activation of caspases is essential for execution of the apoptotic program evoked by death receptor ligands (TRAIL or Fas ligand), by growth factors deprivation, or by genotoxic agents (18.Bose R.

Indeed, repression of caspase enzymatic activity, by viral proteins p35 from baculovirus or CrmA from cowpox virus, FLIP, as well as by synthetic inhibitor peptides (acetyl-DEVD-aldehyde) blocks induction of apoptosis, demonstrating the key role of caspases in the execution of the apoptotic program (22.Dubrez L.

Nature. 1997; 386: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). As inhibition of survival pathways may increase susceptibility to death receptor-induced apoptosis, we first studied whether death effectors may affect the expression of c-FOS, which represents a prototype immediate early gene. By using a luciferase reporter plasmid containing a fragment of the c-FOS promoter, we showed that induction of apoptosis by TRAIL and CH11, an anti-Fas monoclonal antibody, inhibits the transcriptional activity of the c-FOS promoter. Interestingly, we identified, in vivo and in vitro, a caspase-dependent cleavage of the serum response factor (SRF) during CH11 and TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Moreover, we showed that PMA, which prevents apoptosis of Jurkat T cells, abrogates both the cleavage of SRF and the inhibitory effects of CH11 and TRAIL on the transcriptional activity of the c-FOSpromoter. Taken together, our results point to the cleavage of SRF during apoptosis and reveal a striking parallel between SRF cleavage, c-FOS gene repression, and apoptosis. Based on these observations, we propose that during apoptosis the expression of c-FOS, a key gene in cell growth and survival, is impaired, ensuing SRF cleavage by caspase 3. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), sodium fluoride, sodium orthovanadate, aprotinin, and leupeptin were purchased from Sigma and acetyl-DEVD-aldehyde from Bachem. T4 polynucleotide kinase was from Biolabs, and RNase and proteinase K were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. RPMI and fetal calf serum (FCS) were from Life Technologies, Inc. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies were from Dakopatts. TRAIL, anti-C-terminal SRF (G20), and anti-Elk1 (I20) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-Fas monoclonal antibody (CH11) was from Euromedex, and anti-caspase 3 monoclonal antibody was from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-N-terminal SRF antibody was obtained by injection of a rabbit with a peptide (NH2-GSLNRTPTGRPG-COOH) corresponding to the N-terminal part of SRF. Jurkat T cells (clone Jd) were grown at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in RPMI supplemented with 5% FCS and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Jurkat cells, used for electroporation experiments (Jd tag), a kind gift from Dr. Crabtree (Stanford, CA), express the large T antigen of SV40 and were grown under the same conditions in RPMI with 10% FCS. TheFOS luciferase reporter was constructed from a −77/+42 fragment surrounding the transcriptional start site of the humanFOS gene kindly provided by Dr. R. Treisman. The SRE luciferase reporter plasmid contains the SRE motif upstream from the minimal thymidine kinase promoter. Jd tag cells were transiently transfected by electroporation. Ten million Jd tag cells were resuspended in 400 μl of RPMI and placed in a 0.4-cm gap cuvette with 10 μg of total plasmid DNA. Electroporation was performed with a double electric shock (260 V, 960 microfarads) using the gene pulser system (Bio-Rad). Each 10 million cells were separated into 4 wells, and 36 h after transfection, cells were exposed to 100 ng/ml TRAIL, 100 ng/ml CH11, and/or 100 ng/ml PMA for 4 h. When indicated, cells were incubated directly after electroporation with 100 μm acetyl-DEVD-aldehyde. Then soluble extracts were harvested in 50 μl of lysis reporter buffer (Promega) and assayed for luciferase activity. Luciferase activity was normalized by protein amount. Jurkat T cells (4 × 106) were stimulated with 100 ng/ml TRAIL, 100 ng/ml CH11, and/or 100 ng/ml PMA for the times indicated in the figure legends. Then the cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 100 μm NaF, 10 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmleupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1% Nonidet P-40. Proteins (100 μg) were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Millipore). SRF was detected with polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1/3000 in saturation buffer and with a secondary peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody at 1/10,000 dilution. Caspase 3 was detected with monoclonal antibody at a 1/4000 dilution in saturation buffer and with a secondary anti-mouse antibody at a 1/5000 dilution as described previously (26.Ricci J.E.

Proteins were visualized with the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL system. Cells (106) were cultured in RPMI medium in 12-well dishes with 100 ng/ml TRAIL, 100 ng/ml CH11, and/or 100 ng/ml PMA. When indicated, cells were exposed to 100 μm acetyl-DEVD-aldehyde for 24 h. The cells were then collected and lysed with 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Triton X-100. Samples were treated with 100 μg/ml RNase for 30 min at 37 °C and then with 100 μg/ml proteinase K for 30 min at 37 °C. Cellular DNA was isopropyl alcohol-precipitated, dried, and resuspended in Tris-EDTA buffer for 30 min at 55 °C. Next, DNA was analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide as described previously (27.Cursio R. Gugenheim J. Ricci J.E. Crenesse D. Rostagno P. Maulon L. Saint-Paul M.C. Ferrua B. Auberger P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In vitro translation of SRF from pHIVSRF, kindly provided by Dr. Harel-Bellan, was carried out using the SP6 transcription-translation system from Promega. SRF translation was monitored using [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. In vitro translated SRF (2.5 μl) was incubated with 25 ng of recombinant caspase 3 in the presence or absence of 10 μmacetyl-DEVD-aldehyde for 6 h at 37 °C in buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1% CHAPS, and 2 mmdithiothreitol. Reactions were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by autoradiography or were used to perform gel mobility shift assays. Jurkat T cells (4 × 106) were stimulated with 100 ng/ml TRAIL, 100 ng/ml CH11, and/or 100 ng/ml PMA. When indicated, cells were preincubated with 100 μm acetyl-DEVD-aldehyde for 24 h. Cells were then lysed in Hepes buffer containing 350 mmNaCl, 20% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA. Double-stranded synthetic SRE sequence (5′-GGATGTCCATATTAGGACATCT-3′) was [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Ten μg of cellular proteins or thein vitro translated SRF reaction mix described above was preincubated in a binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 4% glycerol, 80 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 15 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) for 10 min on ice. Then, 30,000–50,000 cpm of32P-labeled probe were added to the binding reaction for 20 min at room temperature. For competition experiments, a 50-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides was added during preincubation. For supershift assays, 0.5 μl of anti-SRF or 1 μl of anti-Elk-1 antibodies were added to cellular extracts in the binding reaction buffer. DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide gels (37.5/1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in TBE buffer (22.5 mm Tris borate, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8) for 3 h at 150 V. Initially, we sought to investigate the effects of death receptor activation on c-FOS expression in T lymphocytes. To this end, Jurkat T cells were transiently transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids, containing either a c-FOSpromoter fragment or an SRE motif upon a thymidine kinase minimal promoter. The cells were exposed to TRAIL or CH11, an anti-Fas monoclonal antibody that mimics the apoptotic effects of Fas ligand. Used as a positive control, PMA resulted in a 6-fold stimulation of the c-FOS and SRE luciferase reporter plasmids (Fig.1, A and B). By contrast, we observed that TRAIL or CH11 markedly decreased the c-FOS promoter activity (∼50–60%) (Fig. 1 A). Similarly, TRAIL or CH11 decreased the SRE-driven promoter activity indicating that TRAIL or CH11 effects were targeted to the SRE motif of the c-FOS promoter (Fig. 1 B). At that same time, the activity of the RSV promoter was not impaired by TRAIL or CH11, indicating that a decrease in c-FOS and SRE transcriptional activities was not due to an overall effect on transcription (Fig.1 C). As activation of death receptors by their respective ligand induces apoptosis via activation of caspases, we tested the hypothesis that caspase activities were involved in inhibition of the c-FOS promoter activity by death effectors. Interestingly, the inhibitory effects of TRAIL or CH11 on c-FOS promoter activity were abrogated by acetyl-DEVD-aldehyde, an inhibitor of the CPP32-like caspase family, and this inhibitor did not affect the stimulation evoked by PMA (Fig. 1 D). In conclusion, these results demonstrate that TRAIL or CH11 induce a specific inhibition of the transcriptional activity of the c-FOS promoter. Additionally, our data also suggest that the inhibitory effect of TRAIL or CH11 is targeted to the SRE sequence within the c-FOS promoter. To investigate further the mechanism by which TRAIL or CH11 inhibited the transcriptional activity of the c-FOS promoter, we used the c-FOS SRE sequence as a probe in band shift assays (Fig.2 A). Cellular extracts prepared from Jurkat T cells formed two complexes with the radiolabeled SRE. The major complex (I) was formed by a homodimeric SRF bound to the SRE motif. Moreover, SRF is able to form a ternary complex with the ubiquitously expressed transcription factors of the TCF family (complex II) (8.Hipskind R.A. Rao V.N. Mueller C.G.F. Reddy E.S.P. Nordheim A. Nature. 1991; 354: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 11.Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3283-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). When Jurkat T cells were exposed to TRAIL or CH11 for 2 h, we observed the formation of two additional complexes, with faster electrophoretic mobility, that we called complexes III and IV. Induction of complexes III and IV by TRAIL or CH11 was abolished when Jurkat T cells were preincubated with the caspase inhibitor, acetyl-DEVD-aldehyde. This observation demonstrates the pivotal role of caspase activities in the generation of complexes III and IV and suggests the cleavage of SRE-binding proteins by caspases during induction of apoptosis (Fig. 2 B). Competition experiments using a 50-fold excess of unlabeled probe showed the specificity of complexes I–IV (Fig. 2 A). Under the same conditions, when measuring internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of apoptosis, we clearly observed acetyl-DEVD-aldehyde-sensitive DNA ladder formation that appeared only after a 4-h incubation with TRAIL or CH11 (Fig.2 C). Our results indicate that, in T cells, the early phase of apoptosis is characterized by both the cleavage of an SRE-binding protein and the decrease of the c-FOS promoter activity. Moreover, cleavage of SRE-binding proteins clearly precedes the process of DNA fragmentation. The next series of supershift experiments was undertaken to identify the nature of complexes III and IV generated upon TRAIL or CH11 treatment of Jurkat T cells. Fig. 3 Ashowed that an antibody directed against the N-terminal part of SRF displaced complexes I and II as well as the complexes III and IV. On the other hand, an anti-Elk1 antibody did not affect complex III and IV migration. These results demonstrate that complexes III and IV contain the SRF protein. Additionally, we performed supershift assays using a combination of antibodies directed against the N- or C-terminal part of SRF. Although the anti-N-terminal SRF antibody displaced complexes I–IV, the anti-C-terminal SRF antibody displaced complexes I–III but did not affect complex IV (Fig. 3 B). Thus, complex III corresponds likely to a heterodimer composed of full-length SRF and C-terminally truncated SRF (SRF/SRFΔc) bound to the SRE motif. Complex IV is most likely composed by two C-terminally truncated SRF fragments (SRFΔc/SRFΔc) bound to the SRE motif since this complex that is recognized by the anti-N-terminal SRF antibody is not displaced by the anti-C-terminal SRF antibody. To determine whether SRF was cleaved by caspases, we looked for SRF proteolysis in Jurkat T cells by Western blot. Although the anti-N-terminal SRF antibody failed to react with denatured SRF and the anti-C-terminal SRF antibody did not recognize the cleavage products, we could observe a gradual disappearance of SRF as a function of time in the presence of TRAIL or CH11. After a 2-h incubation period most of the SRF protein was cleaved (Fig.4 A, upper panel). Disappearance of SRF immediately followed activation of caspase 3 as shown in Fig. 4 A, lower panel. The cleavage of SRF is dependent on caspase activity since treatment with acetyl-DEVD-aldehyde was found to abrogate similarly activation of pro-caspase 3 and SRF cleavage (Fig. 4 B, upper and lower panels). These results demonstrate that execution of the apoptotic program is accompanied by the cleavage of SRF by caspases and resulted in the deletion of its C-terminal domain. To detect SRF cleavage products, we next examined whether SRF could serve as a substrate for caspasesin vitro. In vitro transcribed and translated SRF was first incubated with recombinant caspase 3 in the presence or the absence of acetyl-DEVD-aldehyde. After 6 h at 37 °C, recombinant caspase 3 completely degraded the 67-kDa SRF generating a major fragment of approximately 32 kDa (Fig.5 A). In the presence of acetyl-DEVD-aldehyde, caspase 3 failed to cleave SRF (Fig.5 A). Furthermore, reactions carried out as described in Fig.5 A were used to perform gel shift assays (Fig.5 B). In vitro transcribed and translated SRF was found to bind labeled SRE. SRF processed in vitro by caspase 3, generated, in the band shift assay, two complexes migrating with faster electrophoretic mobility than the constitutive, homodimeric SRF·SRE complexes observed under control conditions or in the presence of acetyl-DEVD-aldehyde (Fig. 5 B). Interestingly, complexes obtained in gel shift assay with in vitroprocessed SRF comigrated with those found in cellular extracts prepared from CH11 or TRAIL-stimulated Jurkat T cells (Fig. 5 C). Moreover, addition of an anti-N-terminal SRF antibody to the binding reaction totally displaced complexes III and IV (Fig. 5 D). Taken together these results demonstrate that, in vivo andin vitro, SRF is a target for caspase 3 during induction of apoptosis by TRAIL or CH11. In agreement with recent reports (42.Holmstrom T.H. Chow S.C. Elo I. Coffey E.T. Orrenius S. Sistonen L. Eriksson J.E. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2626-2636PubMed Google Scholar), we showed that internucleosomal DNA fragmentation observed upon exposure to TRAIL or CH11 was not detected when these death effectors were combined with PMA, demonstrating that PMA blocks TRAIL- and CH11-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 6 A). As we observed a tight correlation between induction of apoptosis, cleavage of SRF, and inhibition of the c-FOS transcriptional activity, we expected that PMA treatment would block the apoptotic effect of TRAIL or CH11. Whereas TRAIL or CH11 decreased the basal transcriptional activity of the c-FOS promoter by about 50%, addition of PMA in the medium abrogated their effects and also maintained a full stimulation of the c-FOS promoter activity (Fig.6 B). Identical results were observed on the activity of the SRE-driven reporter plasmid (Fig. 6 C). Interestingly, in the presence of PMA, we failed to detect any SRF cleavage upon TRAIL or CH11 stimulation as judged by band shift assays (Fig.7 A). In Western blot experiments, SRF expression was barely detectable after exposure to TRAIL or CH11, but in presence of PMA, TRAIL- or CH11-mediated cleavage of SRF was totally impaired (Fig. 7 B, upper panel). Finally, when death effectors were combined with PMA, we failed to observe any activation of caspase 3 indicating that PMA is able to counteract the activation of procaspase 3 by death inducers (Fig. 7 B, lower panel).Figure 7PMA prevents SRF cleavage.

One of the first and best characterized biological effect of growth factors is to induce a battery of genes, called immediate early genes, that plays a pivotal role in the control of cell growth and survival (28.Herschman H.R.

In this report, focusing our attention on the immediate early gene c-FOS, we clearly demonstrated that induction of apoptosis by death effectors leads to a drastic decrease in the transcriptional activity of the c-FOS promoter. Since a similar inhibitory effect was observed on an SRE-dependent luciferase construct, the effect of death receptor ligands appears to be targeted to the SRE sequence of the c-FOS promoter. At the same time, TRAIL or CH11 did not impair the activity of a heterologous promoter, demonstrating that the effects of death effectors were specific of the c-FOS promoter and did not reflect a more general mechanism of DNA degradation in apoptotic cells. We showed that death factors induced a cleavage of SRF, likely through activation of caspase 3, suggesting that the inhibition of the c-FOS promoter activity, during induction of apoptosis, resulted from a cleavage of SRF. A role for SRF in the regulation of c-FOS expression has already been proposed. Indeed, in SRF−/− mice embryos, expression of c-FOS is severely impaired, and SRF-deficient mice do not develop to term (29.Arsenian S. Weinhold B. Oelgeschlager M. Ruther U. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6289-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). As c-FOS is tightly associated with cell growth control, extinction of the basal c-FOS expression may be a signal to engage the cell into a death pathway. By using a combination of antibodies directed against the N- or C-terminal part of SRF, we showed that the cleavage of SRF, during induction of apoptosis, leads to elimination of its C-terminal domain (SRFΔc). Additionally, we showed that SRFΔc still bound to the SRE sequence as demonstrated by the presence of the two fast electrophoretic mobility complexes III and IV. Our results are in agreement with other reports which previously showed that deletion of the SRF C-terminal domain did not impair its ability to dimerize and bind DNA (8.Hipskind R.A. Rao V.N. Mueller C.G.F. Reddy E.S.P. Nordheim A. Nature. 1991; 354: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 9.Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 11.Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3283-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 30.Treisman R. Marais R. Wynne J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4631-4640Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In most cases, SRF functions in close association with a member of the TCF family that includes Elk1, Sap1, and Sap2/ERP/NET (31.Price M.A. Rogers A.E. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2589-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). TCF associates both with the dimerization domain of SRF and with the 5′ end of the SRE only if the SRE is already occupied by SRF (8.Hipskind R.A. Rao V.N. Mueller C.G.F. Reddy E.S.P. Nordheim A. Nature. 1991; 354: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In our supershift experiments, we observed that an anti-Elk1 antibody displaced complex II, suggesting that in Jurkat T cells, Elk1 is likely the major TCF that associates with SRF. The shift evoked by anti-Elk1 antibody was less visible in TRAIL- or CH11-treated cells due to the cleavage of SRF. This observation agrees with earlier studies demonstrating the requirement of SRF for Elk1 binding to SRE motif (8.Hipskind R.A. Rao V.N. Mueller C.G.F. Reddy E.S.P. Nordheim A. Nature. 1991; 354: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Moreover, since the anti-Elk1 antibody did not displace the fast mobility complexes (complexes III and IV), we conclude that Elk1 is probably not able to associate with the truncated form of SRF. SRE sequences have been identified in the promoter of different immediate early genes such as EGR-1, EGR-2, β-actin, and JUN B that are also involved in cell growth and survival control (3.Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). So, it is possible that the inhibitory effects evoked by death effectors on c-FOS promoter activity may also be observed on these SRF-dependent promoters as a consequence of SRF cleavage. Recently, an SRE-like motif was found in the promoter of MCL1, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl2 family (32.Townsend K.J. Zhou P. Qian L. Bieszczad C.K. Lowrey C.H. Yen A. Craig R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1801-1813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Proteins of the Bcl2 family include those that promote death (e.g. Bax, Bak, Bad, and Bid) and those that prevent death (e.g. Bcl2, BclxL, and MCL1) (33.Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4789) Google Scholar, 34.Kroemer G. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 614-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar, 35.Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar). In Jurkat T cells, apoptosis can be blocked by an overexpression of the anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl2 family that impairs caspase 3 activation (36.Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friescu C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2620) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the expression of MCL1 appears to be controlled by SRF and TCF transcription factors (32.Townsend K.J. Zhou P. Qian L. Bieszczad C.K. Lowrey C.H. Yen A. Craig R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1801-1813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). According to the crucial role of the Bcl2 family proteins in the regulation of apoptosis (37.Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4920) Google Scholar), the cleavage of SRF could also affect the expression of MCL1 thus favoring transmission of apoptotic signals. In this line, we hypothesize that SRF cleavage results in a decrease of SRF-responsive gene expression and thereby would play a key role in the regulation of the apoptotic pathway. Numerous caspase substrates have been described so far, and some of them have also been involved in the control of cell growth and survival (38.Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Given the complexity of the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of programmed cell death, it has not been possible until now to demonstrate that the cleavage of one of these caspase target is absolutely required for cell death. Because of the presence of more than one cleavage site in SRF (Fig. 5 A), we have not yet been able to generate a non-cleavable form of the protein. However, it would be interesting in the future to assess the effect of a non-cleavable form of SRF on TRAIL and CH11-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, we observed that the protective effect of PMA on TRAIL- and CH11-mediated cleavage of SRF and c-FOS promoter inhibition correlated with a protection against apoptosis. We also established that the specific MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor, PD 98059, partially inhibited the protective effects of PMA, whereas a complete inhibition was achieved with the PKC inhibitor GF109203X. These results demonstrate that the protective effects of PMA depend on both the p42/44MAPK signaling pathway and PKC activity. 2C. Bertolotto, personal communication.This observation is in accordance with a recent study indicating that neuronal cell survival was promoted by activation of the RasMAPK signaling pathway and involved the MAPK-activated p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (pp90RSK) family (39.Bonni A. Brunet A. West A.E. Datta S.R. Takasu M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar). In a recent report, it has also been shown that pp90RSK blocked bad-mediated cell death via a PKC-dependent pathway (40.Tan Y. Ruan H. Demeter M.R. Comb M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34859-34867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Importantly, pp90RSK has also shown to phosphorylate SRF on serine 103, an event that facilitates formation of an active transcription complex at the SRE (41.Rivera V.M. Miranti C.K. Misra R.P. Ginty D.D. Chen R.H. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6260-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Taken together, we demonstrated in this report that the transcription factor SRF was cleaved during induction of apoptosis. This observation was correlated with a decrease of the c-FOSpromoter transcriptional activity. As SRF and c-FOS have been involved in the control of cell survival, we hypothesized that the cleavage of SRF and the inhibition of c-FOS expression represent an important step in the execution of the apoptotic program in Jurkat T cells. We thank Dr. A. Harel-Bellan (Villejuif, France) for providing the plasmid pHIV SRF containing the SRF coding sequence and Dr. G. R. Crabtree (Stanford University) for providing Jd tag. We are also grateful to E. Van Obberghen-Schilling for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2091856251,"The DNA strand passage activity of eukaryotic topoisomerase II relies on a cascade of conformational changes triggered by ATP binding to the N-terminal domain of the enzyme. To investigate the interdomain communication between the ATPase and cleavage/religation domains of human topoisomerase IIα, we characterized a mutant enzyme that contains a deletion at the interface between the two domains, covering amino acids 350–407. The ATPase domain retained full activity with a rate of ATP hydrolysis that was severalfold higher than normal, but the ATPase activity was unaffected by DNA. The cleavage and religation activities of the enzyme were comparable with those of the wild-type enzyme both in the absence and presence of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. However, neither ATP nor a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog stimulated cleavage complex formation. Although both conserved domains retained full activity, the mutant enzyme was unable to coordinate these activities into strand passage. Our findings suggest that the normal conformational transitions occurring in the enzyme upon ATP binding are hampered or lacking in the mutant enzyme. Consistent with this hypothesis, the enzyme displayed an abnormal clamp closing activity. In summary, the region covering amino acids 350–407 in human topoisomerase IIα seems to be essential for correct interdomain communication and probably is involved in signaling ATP binding to the rest of the enzyme.

Hickson I.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 681-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 2.Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar, 3.Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Topological changes mediated by the dimeric topoisomerase II enzyme require a strict control of the passage of duplex DNA through the whole subunit interface (4.Roca J. Berger J.M. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4057-4062Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and through another duplex coordinately cleaved by the enzyme, where a correct interdomain as well as intersubunit communication is fundamental. Topoisomerase II consists of three distinct domains. The N-terminal and central domains are highly conserved among enzymes from different eukaryotic organisms and also share homology to the gyrase B and A subunits, respectively (5.Lynn R. Giaever G. Swanberg S.L. Wang J.C. Science. 1986; 233: 647-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 6.Wyckoff E. Natalie D. Nolan J.M. Lee M. Hsieh T. J. Mol.

Kjeldsen E. Biersack H. Olsen E.H. Andersen T.B. Westergaard O. Jakobsen B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3866-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 10.Shiozaki K. Yanagida M. Mol. Cell.

Central to the activity of the enzyme is its ability to bind and hydrolyze ATP as well as to cleave and religate DNA. The active site for ATP hydrolysis is encompassed in the N-terminal domain (12.Worland S.T. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Wigley D.B.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), while that for DNA cleavage/religation is located in the central domain (15.Austin C.A. Sng J.H. Patel S. Fisher L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1172: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Structural and biochemical data have suggested a rational model for the catalytic mechanism of eukaryotic topoisomerase II (16.Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10485-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 17.Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 18.Roca J. Wang J.C.

Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). According to this model, the two subunits of the enzyme form a heart-shaped ring structure, where the N-terminal domains protrude as a set of jaws functioning as an ATP operated clamp. In the absence of ATP, the enzyme assumes an open conformation with a gate in the N-terminal part of the enzyme. The open state can permit a DNA segment (the so-called G-segment) to enter the enzyme through the N-terminal face and bind to the cleavage/religation domain. Binding of the DNA segment will induce the first conformational change in the enzyme, which enables the active site tyrosines to move toward each other into a position whereby cleavage can occur. Upon binding of ATP and hydrolysis of the first ATP molecule, other conformational changes occur, facilitating dimerization of the N-terminal domains (20.Baird C.L. Harkins T.T. Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13685-13690Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In this process, the other duplex segment (the so-called T-segment) that has to be transported through the broken DNA is captured by the enzyme. Besides DNA trapping, the conformational changes also ensure the creation of a gate in the G-segment by separation of the two active site tyrosines covalently linked to the broken DNA ends. The process is continued by the transport of the trapped T-segment through the entire interfacial channel in between the two subunits and thereby through the gate in the cleaved G-segment. The movements of the cleavage/religation domain during DNA religation restrict the cavity enclosing the transported DNA, thereby releasing this duplex through a second gate formed by a disruption of the dimerization region located in the C-terminal part of the central domain (4.Roca J. Berger J.M. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4057-4062Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 18.Roca J. Wang J.C.

Chem. 1999; 274: 26529-26536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Finally, ATP hydrolysis of the second ATP molecule results in enzyme turnover and reopening of the N-terminal gate (20.Baird C.L. Harkins T.T. Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13685-13690Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In a recent study by Maxwell and co-workers (22.Gardiner L.P. Roper D.I. Hammonds T.R. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16997-17004Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), a human topoisomerase IIα fragment covering the N-terminal domain from amino acid 1 to 439 was shown to have an intrinsic ATPase activity, which could be further stimulated by the presence of DNA. In another study, a core domain ofDrosophila topoisomerase II covering amino acids 406–1207 was demonstrated to have wild-type levels of cleavage/religation activity (23.Chang S. Hu T. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19822-19828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The results from the two studies nicely illustrate that the individual domains in topoisomerase II still preserve their intrinsic activities even when separated from the rest of the enzyme, demonstrating that they fold up as independent catalytic domains. However, strand passage activity requires a tightly coordinated communication between the individual domains. This is indicated by a study of the ATP consumption by topoisomerase II performed by Lindsley and Wang (24.Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8096-8104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where it was shown that a tight coupling exists between ATP usage and the DNA strand transport event under unsaturated ATP concentrations. Furthermore, several studies have revealed a stimulatory effect of ATP on topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage, also illustrating the communication between enzyme subdomains (25.Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9944-9950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Wasserman R.A. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20943-20951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to investigate the communication between the ATPase and cleavage/religation domains of human topoisomerase IIα, we characterized a mutant enzyme having a deletion at the interface between the two domains. The enzyme contained both ATPase and cleavage/religation activities, but no strand passage occurred. Furthermore, the DNA cleavage activity was independent of ATP, and rates of ATP hydrolysis were unaffected by the presence of DNA. Finally, the mutant enzyme lacked a normal clamp closing activity. In summary, the deleted region seems to be essential for correct interdomain communication and probably is involved in signaling ATP binding to the rest of the enzyme. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains BJ201 (Matα ura3 trp1 pep4::HIS3 prb1 can1 top2::TRP1) and JEL1ΔTop1 (kindly provided by J. C. Wang) were used for complementation and overexpression of topoisomerase II constructs, respectively. Plasmid pBY105 contains the yeast TPI promoter inserted into the polylinker region of the LEU2/ARS-CEN plasmid pRS315, which was used as the backbone for pHT212 and pHTΔ350–407, carrying the wild-type human TOP2α cDNA and the humanTOP2α cDNA with a deletion spanning amino acids 350–407, respectively. Both pHT212 and pHTΔ350–407 contain a bicomposite tag at the C-terminal end consisting of the c-Myc epitope and a hexahistidine tail (9.Jensen S. Andersen A.H. Kjeldsen E. Biersack H. Olsen E.H. Andersen T.B. Westergaard O. Jakobsen B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3866-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Modified versions of YEpWOB6 were used for overexpression of the hexahistidine-tagged human topoisomerase IIα and hΔ350–407 enzymes. The construction of pHT212 and pHTΔ350–407 was described by Jensen et al. (9.Jensen S. Andersen A.H. Kjeldsen E. Biersack H. Olsen E.H. Andersen T.B. Westergaard O. Jakobsen B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3866-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For overexpression of the hexahistidine versions of human topoisomerase IIα and hΔ350–407 enzymes, the topoisomerase IIα cDNA of YEpWOB6 was first modified with a hexahistidine tail at the C terminus. For this purpose, a C-terminal fragment of topoisomerase IIα fused to a hexahistidine tail was generated via polymerase chain reaction using pHT212 as template. The 3′ primer was designed with a stretch of 54 overhanging nucleotides containing the hexahistidine tail and three restriction sites for cloning. The annealing segment of the primer was the reverse complementary sequence of the human c-Myc epitope (5′-TCC CCC CGG GGC GGC CGC CTC GAG CTA ATG ATG GTG GTG ATG GTG GCT CCC ACG GTT CAA GTC TTC TTC AGA GAT CAA C-3′). The 5′ primer sequence was identical to nucleotides 2973–2991 of the topoisomerase IIα cDNA sequence (5′-GAG AGA GTT GGA CTA CAC-3′). The generated polymerase chain reaction fragment was used to replace the corresponding fragment of human topoisomerase IIα in YEpWOB6 employing BlnI andXmaI as 5′ and 3′ cloning sites, respectively. For overexpression of the hΔ350–407 enzyme in the YEpWOB6 system, theBsrGI/BlnI fragment in YEpWOB6 was substituted with the corresponding fragment from pHTΔ350–407. Yeast cells were transformed by using a modified version of the LiAc method of Itoet al. (27.Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the ability of the hΔ350–407 enzyme to complement the lack of endogenous topoisomerase II in BJ201, the LEU2-based construct pHTΔ350–407 was transformed into BJ201, and cells were transferred to media plates containing 5′-fluoro-orotic acid (1 mg/ml) to select against the URA3 plasmid carrying theSchizosaccharomyces pombe TOP2 gene (9.Jensen S. Andersen A.H. Kjeldsen E. Biersack H. Olsen E.H. Andersen T.B. Westergaard O. Jakobsen B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3866-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). pHT212 was used as the positive control. The recombinant human topoisomerase II enzymes were overexpressed in yeast strain JEL1ΔTop1 by the addition of galactose to glucose-free medium (12.Worland S.T. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells were extracted with 2 volumes of extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 1 volume of acid-washed glass beads (425–600 μm; Sigma). Further preparation of yeast extracts was done according to the procedure of Jensen et al. (9.Jensen S. Andersen A.H. Kjeldsen E. Biersack H. Olsen E.H. Andersen T.B. Westergaard O. Jakobsen B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3866-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The initial purification step using a 6-ml Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column was as described previously by Biersack et al. (28.Biersack H. Jensen S. Gromova I. Nielsen I.S. Westergaard O. Andersen A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8288-8293Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For further purification of the recombinant enzymes to near homogeneity, the fractions pooled from the Ni2+ column were loaded onto a 5-ml heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and elution was performed by a 75-ml linear gradient having a NaCl concentration ranging from 200 mm to 1 m. Fractions containing topoisomerase II were further applied to a phosphocellulose column (P11 cellulose phosphate; Whatman) for concentration of the enzyme. Elution was performed in a buffer containing 750 mmKCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7. Fractions containing topoisomerase II enzyme were pooled and stored in liquid nitrogen for later use. Homogeneity of the topoisomerase II preparations was determined based on the analysis in 8.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Blue dye. DNA relaxation was performed by incubating 0.05 μg (5 nm) of topoisomerase II and 0.3 μg of supercoiled pBR322 DNA in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2.5% glycerol) supplemented with 1 mm ATP. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C and stopped at different times by the addition of 3 μl of 0.77% SDS and 77 mm EDTA. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels in TBE (100 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA). Gels were stained with 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide, visualized by UV light, and photographed using Polaroid type 665 positive/negative films. Topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage was performed by incubating 1.5 μg (150 nm) of topoisomerase II and 0.3 μg of negatively supercoiled pBR322 DNA in a total volume of 20 μl in assay buffer. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 6 min, and cleavage products were trapped by the addition of SDS to 1%. Samples were treated with 2 μl of 0.8 mg/ml Proteinase K before subjection to electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels in TAE (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA) containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. When topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage was carried out in the presence of ATP or the ATP analog AMP-PNP1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), the concentration of these nucleotides was 1 mm. When amsacrine or VM26 (teniposide) was included in the cleavage reaction, the final concentration of the drug was 100 μm. Levels of DNA cleavage were quantified by scanning the cleavage bands in photographic negatives with an EC apparatus model EC910 scanning densitometer in conjunction with Hoefer GS-370 Data System software DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized on a DNA synthesizer model 394 by DNA Technology Corp. and purified by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described by Andersenet al. (29.Andersen A.H. Sorensen B.S. Christiansen K. Svejstrup J.Q. Lund K. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9203-9210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 28-mer used as the bottom strand in the suicide substrate was modified at the 3′-end by the amino link -O-PO2-O-CH2-CHOH-CH2-NH2to inhibit ligation to this end. Hybridization and labeling of the synthetic oligonucleotides were done according to the procedures described by Andersen et al. (29.Andersen A.H. Sorensen B.S. Christiansen K. Svejstrup J.Q. Lund K. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9203-9210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage, 75 nm topoisomerase II was incubated with 0.1 pmol of labeled substrate in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mmCaCl2, 30 mm NaCl, 15 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 mm EDTA (cleavage buffer) at 37 °C, and reactions were stopped at different times by the addition of SDS to 1%. Covalent topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complexes were recovered from a phenol/water interphase according to Gocke et al. (30.Gocke E. Bonven B.J. Westergaard O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 7661-7678Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Complexes were subsequently ethanol-precipitated and treated with proteinase K (500 μg/ml) for 2 h at 45 °C. One volume of gel loading buffer (50% formamide, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.03% xylene cyanole, 5 mm EDTA) was added, and the material was subjected to electrophoresis in a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The level of cleavage was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). A topoisomerase II-mediated suicide cleavage reaction was performed as described above. After incubation at 37 °C for 60 min, the cleavage reaction was stopped by the addition of NaCl to 0.4 m, thereby preventing further cleavage during the ligation reaction. Ligation was initiated by the addition of a 45-mer ligation substrate in a 200-fold molar excess relative to the cleavage substrate. After further incubation (with incubation times as indicated in the figure legends), the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS to 1%. Samples were ethanol-precipitated, proteinase K-digested, and analyzed by electrophoresis in a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The ATPase assay was based on the method of Osheroff et al. (31.Osheroff N. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9536-9543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions contained 15 nm topoisomerase II and, when indicated, 1 μg of negatively supercoiled pBR322. Reactions were carried out in 20 μl of assay buffer containing a final concentration of 1 mm cold ATP and 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mixtures were incubated at 37 °C, and 2.5-μl aliquots were removed at various times and spotted onto thin layer cellulose plates impregnated with poly(ethylenimine) (Baker-flex precoated flexible TLC sheets). Chromatography was performed using freshly made 0.4 mNH4HCO3. Levels of free PO4 were quantified using a PhosphorImager. For clamp closing experiments, 0.06 pmol of topoisomerase II was preincubated with 6 ng of supercoiled pBR322 and 6 ng of linearized pBR322 at 37 °C for 5 min in a total volume of 20 μl of assay buffer. After preincubation, AMP-PNP or ATP was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the reactions were incubated for an additional 5 min at 37 °C. The reactions were next stopped by the addition of either NaCl or SDS to final concentrations of 800 mm and 1%, respectively. The sample volume was increased to 70 μl by adding 50 μl of an 800 mm NaCl solution. To trap enzyme-DNA catenanes, phenol extraction was performed by adding 1 volume of phenol. The samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 15 min. The water phase was removed, and 35 μl of it was ethanol-precipitated and dissolved in 10 μl of TE buffer for gel analysis. The combined phenol and phenol interphase was washed three times with 500 μl of 800 mm NaCl after increasing the sample volume to approximately 100 μl with phenol. Upon removal of the water phase after the last wash, the remaining material was ethanol-precipitated and dissolved in 10 μl of Proteinase K buffer containing 1 mg/ml Proteinase K and 0.5% SDS. The samples were next subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels in TBE. Southern blotting was performed using Zeta-Probe GT membranes (Bio-Rad), and random primed plasmids were used for hybridization (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) was used for gel scanning. ATP binding and hydrolysis by topoisomerase II is known to mediate sequential conformational changes in the enzyme reaching from the N-terminal clamp to the C-terminal dimerization region (16.Lindsley J.E.

A. 1999; 96: 13685-13690Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the communication between the ATPase and the cleavage/religation domains of human topoisomerase IIα, we characterized a mutant enzyme (hΔ350–407) that contains a deletion of amino acids 350–407 at the very C-terminal end of the N-terminal ATPase domain (Fig.1 A). The deletion mutant has been presented earlier as one in a series of human topoisomerase IIα mutants all having deletions in highly conserved subdomains (9.Jensen S. Andersen A.H. Kjeldsen E. Biersack H. Olsen E.H. Andersen T.B. Westergaard O. Jakobsen B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3866-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In a complementation assay using an S. cerevisiae top2 deletion strain, hΔ350–407 failed to sustain mitotic growth in contrast to a wild-type human topoisomerase IIα enzyme, suggesting that the mutant enzyme has lost its in vivo activity (Fig. 1 B). For studies of the in vitro capabilities of hΔ350–407, the mutant enzyme fused to a hexahistidine tail at the C-terminal end was overexpressed in a yeast top1 null strain and purified to homogeneity as seen from the Coomassie-stained gel in Fig.1 C. To investigate the DNA strand passage activity of hΔ350–407, a DNA relaxation assay was performed, where the catalytic activity of the mutant enzyme was compared with that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig.2). While the wild-type enzyme relaxed all the supercoiled DNA within 10 min, the deletion mutant showed no sign of relaxation up to 15 min. Thus, consistent with the lack ofin vivo complementation, hΔ350–407 appears to have lost its in vitro relaxation activity, or it is diminished to under detectable levels. A similar lack of DNA strand passage was observed in a DNA decatenation assay (data not shown). These results demonstrate that deletion of the C-terminal 57 amino acids of the ATPase region in human topoisomerase IIα is detrimental to the enzyme. Either it abrogates the DNA strand passage activity of the enzyme, or it disrupts correct folding of the protein. In order to determine whether the individual domains of hΔ350–407 still retain their residual activities although the enzyme is unable to convert these activities to full catalysis, we analyzed the capability of the N-terminal domain of the deletion mutant to hydrolyze ATP. According to the model presented by Lindsley, ATP hydrolysis is responsible for the conformational changes leading to DNA transport and final enzyme turnover (20.Baird C.L. Harkins T.T. Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13685-13690Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis was investigated using thin layer chromatography, and hydrolysis rates were assigned using a linear regression least squares analysis (Fig.3). Strikingly, the ATPase activity of hΔ350–407 was ∼6-fold higher than that of the wild-type enzyme, demonstrating that the N-terminal domain of the mutant enzyme indeed still folds into a catalytic active domain able to bind and hydrolyze ATP. Earlier studies on topoisomerase II-mediated ATP hydrolysis have shown that this activity is stimulated in the presence of DNA, both when the ATPase region is embodied in a full-length enzyme or in an N-terminal topoisomerase II fragment (22.Gardiner L.P. Roper D.I. Hammonds T.R. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16997-17004Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 24.Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. J. Biol.

In the present study, the ATPase activity of the wild-type human topoisomerase IIα enzyme was stimulated 2–3-fold in the presence of supercoiled plasmid DNA (Fig.3, inset). However, no stimulation was observed with hΔ350–407, indicating that the ATPase activity of the mutant enzyme is unaffected by DNA. The significant rise in the ATPase activity and its DNA independence combined with the lack of strand passage activity indicate an uncoupling of the N-terminal domain from the rest of the enzyme. The uncoupling might be caused either by an inability of the mutant enzyme to transmit essential conformational changes as a result of ATP binding and hydrolysis or an inability to interact properly with DNA. In order to test if the central domain of the hΔ350–407 enzyme still retained its intrinsic DNA binding and cleavage activities, cleavage experiments were performed using either oligonucleotides or supercoiled circular DNA as substrate. The suicide substrate, which is schematically illustrated in Fig.4A (upper panel) consists of a 16-base-long 5′-recessed top strand with only three nucleotides 5′ to the cleavage position and a 28-base-long bottom strand. Use of the suicide substrate has been demonstrated to cause an uncoupling of the cleavage and ligation half-reactions due to the release of the trinucleotide 5′ to the cleavage position on the top strand (29.Andersen A.H. Sorensen B.S. Christiansen K. Svejstrup J.Q. Lund K. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9203-9210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate was labeled at the 3′-end of the recessed top strand and incubated with either hΔ350–407 or the wild-type enzyme. Samples were withdrawn at different times, and after termination of the cleavage reaction by SDS, the protein-linked cleavage complexes were isolated from a phenol/water interphase. Samples were analyzed in a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel after proteinase K treatment (Fig.4 A, middle panel). As seen from a schematic presentation of the obtained cleavage levels (Fig. 4 A,lower panel), the mutant enzyme cleaved the suicide substrate to a level similar to the wild-type enzyme, indicating that the cleavage domain retained normal DNA binding and cleavage activities.

That is, we were able to coprecipitate the guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G with the adaptor protein CRKII in lysates from suspended cells that had low ERK activity, but we could not do so or could do so less efficiently in lysates of adherent cells with increased ERK activity. Consistent with the presence of a functional CRKII-C3G complex, we detected more GTP-loaded RAP1 in suspension than adherent lysates. Overexpression of cDNAs encoding B-RAF, CRKII W109L, and PTP1B C215S activated ERK in suspension cells, the latter two constructs also disrupting CRKII-C3G complex formation. Finally, we have also observed that certain integrin α subunit cytoplasmic splice variants differentially regulate ERK1/2 but also in a manner that correlated with levels of a CRKII-C3G complex. Thus, these data suggest the involvement of integrins in an ERK suppression pathway mediated by CRKII-C3G complex formation and downstream signaling from activated RAP1.

Although the initial mechanics of these transduction pathways are distinct, several downstream effects and mediators are held in common. One of these common downstream mediators is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (the MAP1 kinases ERK1 and ERK2). Canonical pathways leading to ERK activation typically involve small GTPases. Principally, GTP loading or activation of RAS triggers a downstream kinase activation cascade from RAF1 to MEK and finally to ERK1 and ERK2. Integrin-mediated adhesion has been reported to impact this pathway at various and sometimes controversial points (1.Clark E.A. Hynes R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14814-14818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 2.Lin T.H. Aplin A.E. Shen Y. Chen Q. Schaller M. Romer L. Aukhil I. Juliano R.L. J.

Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). A second GTPase that may affect ERK activity is RAP1. By competing with RAS for common downstream effectors, activated RAP1 is sometimes thought to be antagonistic to RAS-based signaling (5.Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), although specific RAP1 effects may be species- or cell type-specific (6.Ishimaru S. Williams R. Clark E. Hanafusa H. Gaul U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7.Zwartkruis F.J.T. Wolthuis R.M.F. Nabben N.M.J.M. Franke B. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5905-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Crucial in the activation of the small GTPases is the mobilization of adaptor protein-exchange factor complexes. Thus, the GRB2-SOS complex is recruited to the cell membrane in GRB2 SH2 domain-dependent interactions with tyrosine-phosphorylated growth factor receptors or phosphorylated intermediates of integrin signaling pathways, thereby enabling efficient guanine nucleotide exchange or activation of RAS. Likewise, RAP1 is activated by the relocation of the adaptor protein, CRKII, and its associated exchange factor C3G. A potential docking site for CRKII is p130CAS, a protein heavily phosphorylated upon integrin ligation (8.Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to relocation of these complexes, recent studies suggest their association itself may be regulated, thereby affecting downstream signaling. In what can be thought of as a classical negative feedback loop, a kinase activity downstream of MEK, possibly MEK itself, can serine/threonine-phosphorylate SOS (9.Zhao H. Okada S. Pessin J.E. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12061-12067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated SOS can dissociate from GRB2 (10.Waters S.B. Holt K.H. Ross S.E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25320-25323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), thereby limiting GTP loading of RAS and attenuating ERK activation. In a similar manner, as best exemplified with the insulin receptor, ligand occupancy can lead to tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor protein CRKII (12.Okada S. Matsuda M. Anafi M. Pawson T. Pessin J.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2554-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Once tyrosine-phosphorylated, CRKII can form an intramolecular SH2 domain loop (13.Rosen M.K. Yamazaki T. Gish G.D. Kay C.M. Pawson T. Kay L.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 477-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), altering its conformation and dissociating from C3G (12.Okada S. Matsuda M. Anafi M. Pawson T.

Certain integrins are expressed with alternatively spliced cytoplasmic domains that often exist in a cell- or tissue-specific manner and can be induced upon differentiation (15.Fornaro M. Languino L.R. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). There are four β1and β4 cytoplasmic variants, three of α7, and two each of β3, α3, and α6. In some cases these isoforms confer phenotypic variation. For example, overexpression of the β1C and β1D variants slow cell cycle progression (16.Belkin A.M. Retta S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15234-15240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17.Fornaro M. Zheng D.Q. Languino L.R. J. Biol.

Schwartz M.A. Science. 1995; 269: 1570-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), whereas β1B appears to have dominant negative effects on cell adhesion and motility (19.Balzac F. Retta S.F. Albini A. Melchiorri A. Koteliansky V.E. Geuna M. Silengo L. Tarone G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cells expressing the α6A as opposed to the α6B isoform are more migratory (20.Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, the distribution and expression pattern of these splice variants may enable unique functional properties to constituent cells. Whereas phenotypic differences have been ascribed to certain splice variants, the intracellular signaling pathways utilized by them are less clear. Nevertheless, limited studies with the α6 variants have identified different patterns of adhesion-stimulated protein tyrosine phosphorylation (21.Shaw L.M. Turner C.E. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23648-23652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and MAP kinase activation (22.Wei J. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5903-5907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In exploring the role of adaptor protein-exchange factor complexes in the regulation of the MAP kinases, we have identified a correlation between CRKII-C3G complex formation, levels of GTP-loaded RAP, and ERK activity in CHO cells. That is, in lysates of suspension cells, we observed low ERK activity but an immunoprecipitable CRKII-C3G complex and high levels of activated RAP. In contrast lysates generated from CHO cells adherent to fibronectin (fn) demonstrated increased ERK activity but little of the CRKII-C3G complex and GTP-loaded RAP. We have also observed that cells expressing α subunit cytoplasmic splice variants differentially regulated ERK1/2 in a manner that was consistent with levels of the CRKII-C3G complex. These data suggest the possibility that integrins mediate an active mechanism to suppress or maintain basal levels of MAP kinases and that this may involve the variable association of adaptor proteins with exchange factors. The characterization of the anti-αIIbβ3 antibodies D57, anti-LIBS6, and PAC1 have been described previously (23.O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C.

Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were from Tago (Burlingame, CA), and phycoerythrin-streptavidin was from Molecular Probes Inc. (Junction City, OR). The peptide mimetic compound Ro43-5054, which specifically inhibits binding to αIIbβ3 was a generous gift from Beat Steiner (Hoffmann-La Roche). Antibodies to ERK1, ERK2, CRKII, C3G, B-RAF, and the HA epitope were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and an anti-PTP1B antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Phospho-ERK-specific antibodies were from Promega (Madison, WI) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Fibrinogen (fg) was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc. (South Bend, IN) and G418 (Geneticin) was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. The construction of the chimeric integrins β3β1, αIIbα6A, and αIIbα6B has been described previously (23.O'Toole T.E.

Briefly, cytoplasmic sequences of the integrin variants α3A and α3B were generated from full-length cDNA clones by polymerase chain reaction with appropriately designed oligonucleotide primers, digested with HindIII andXbaI, and subcloned into pCDM8. The resulting construct was digested with HindIII and fused to a HindIII fragment of CD2b (26.O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Plow E.F. Glass A. Harper J.R. Ginsberg M.H.

A catalytically inactive mutant of PTP1B (C215S) was generated from the wild-type clone (gift of Nicholas Tonks; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) by Quick Change Mutagenesis (Stratagene) with appropriately designed oligonucleotides. A B-RAF cDNA was supplied by Phillip Stork (Vollum Institute), and expression vectors for RAS and RAP GTPases were supplied by Gary Bokoch (Scripps Research Institute). All constructs were verified before use by DNA sequencing. CHO cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 1% l-glutamine (Sigma), 1% penicillin and streptomycin (Sigma), and 1% non-essential amino acids (Sigma). To establish stable lines expressing integrin chimera, plasmids encoding these sequences and a construct expressing the neomycin resistance gene were cotransfected into CHO cells. Briefly, the cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/100-mm dish, and 24 h later, 2 μg of each integrin construct and 0.1 μg of the neomycin resistance construct were mixed with 20 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a final volume of 200 μl and incubated for 10 min. At this time, the DNA-liposome complex was made up to 4 ml with unsupplemented DMEM and added to the cells. The cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C, washed with PBS, and put into complete media. The media were changed after 24 h, and the cells were subjected to G418 selection (700 μg/ml) after 48 h. After 2 weeks of selection, the cells were collected and single-cell sorted by flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton Dickinson) using the αIIbβ3-specific antibody, D57. Clonal lines were expanded and further analyzed. Transient transfections were also performed with the LipofectAMINE reagent. In these experiments, the cells were cotransfected with the pHOOK vector (Invitrogen) and positive cells isolated after 48 h by magnetic sorting as per manufacturer's suggestions. Integrin expression was determined by single color flow cytometry. Cells were harvested by incubation with trypsin-EDTA (Irvine Scientific, CA), washed in buffer containing soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), and analyzed for D57 antibody binding. To do this, the cells were incubated in a final volume of 50 μl of DMEM, 1% BSA with 0.5 μg of D57 antibody for 30 min on ice. The cells were then diluted to 0.5 ml with DMEM-BSA, pelleted, and resuspended in 50 μl of DMEM-BSA containing 10% FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. After 30 min on ice, the cells were diluted to 0.5 ml with PBS, centrifuged, resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS, and analyzed on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). The ligand binding properties of these transfectants were determined by two-color flow cytometry using the activation-specific anti-αIIbβ3 antibody (PAC1) and D57, as has been previously described (23.O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Adhesion studies were done by first incubating cells overnight in DMEM containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum. At this time, the cells were harvested by incubation in trypsin-EDTA and washed with serum-free DMEM containing 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and 0.2% BSA (Calbiochem, nuclease- and protease-free). The cells were then resuspended in DMEM, 0.2% BSA, and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in suspension dishes (Corning Glass) that had been blocked overnight with 1% heat-denatured BSA. At this time, some of the cells were collected and washed in PBS (suspension cells). The remaining cells were allowed to adhere for 10 min to tissue culture dishes that had been coated with substrate proteins (overnight incubation with 15 μg/ml fg or fn) and washed once with PBS (adherent cells). Suspended and adherent cells prepared as described above were lysed on ice in M2 buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 3 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mmNaPi, 3 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 1× complete phosphatase inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), the lysates clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration determined by the BCA assay (Pierce). For phospho-ERK immunoblotting, 60 μg of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) for 2 h at room temperature, incubated with an anti-phospho-ERK antibody (1:2000 dilution in 5% milk) for 1 h at room temperature, and then washed with TBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 (TBS-T). The membranes were then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:3000 dilution) for 1 h, washed with TBS-T, and immunoreactive bands visualized using ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To confirm equal loading of ERK1 and ERK2, the membrane was stripped in buffer containing 62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 65 °C, blocked with 5% non-fat milk, and re-probed with antibodies to ERK1 and ERK2. For in vitro kinase reactions, ERK1 and ERK2 were immunoprecipitated from 150 μg of lysate by incubation with 0.4 μg each of anti-ERK1 and anti-ERK2 antibodies and 30 μl of a 50% slurry of protein-G Sepharose for 3 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed with M2 buffer and with kinase buffer (KB: 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mm DTT, 5 mmNa3VO4), and then resuspended in KB. Kinase reactions were initiated by addition of 2 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP), 20 μm cold ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and allowed to incubate for 20 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer, and labeled products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Equal immunoprecipitation of ERK1 and ERK2 was confirmed by Western blotting with antibodies to these proteins. Suspension and adherent lysates prepared as described above were clarified by centrifugation, and the resulting supernatants were collected. For immunoprecipitations, 300 μg of cell extract was diluted to 0.4 ml in lysis buffer and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate antibodies. Proteins were recovered after a 2-h incubation with protein G-Sepharose, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Protein bands were identified after incubating the membranes with specific primary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and finally visualized with the ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To determine the GTP-loading of RAS and RAP GTPases, we performed pull-down assays. GST fusion proteins with the minimal RAP-binding domain of RalGDS and the RAS-binding domain of RAF-1 (RBD) were generated in Escherichia colistrain BL21 following induction with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and isolated by immobilizing bacterial lysates for 1 h at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were then washed three times with RBD buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 120 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin), and then resuspended in RBD buffer to make a 50% slurry. CHO cells were transfected with expression vectors for HA-tagged wild-type RAP1 or wild-type Ha-RAS and pHOOK as described above. After 48 h, transfectants were isolated by magnetic sorting and suspended and adherent cells generated as above. These samples were then lysed in ice-cold pull-down buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 25 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1× completeTM protease inhibitors) and immediately centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was incubated with immobilized GST-RalGDS or GST-RBD beads (50 μl of 50% slurry containing about 10 μg of protein) for 1 h at 4 °C. At this time, the beads were washed three times with pull-down buffer, and isolated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Detection of pulled down RAP and RAS GTPases was accomplished by Western blotting with anti-HA and anti-RAS antibodies, respectively. As noted above, the association of SH2 and SH3-containing adaptor proteins with guanine nucleotide exchange factors can be regulated by signals arising from occupancy of growth factor receptors. To determine if integrin occupancy also regulates these associations, we have examined the properties of these molecules in suspension and adherent lysates. As expected, when CHO cells were serum-starved overnight and then kept in suspension for 2 h, we observed low levels of ERK1/2 activity that were significantly increased upon adhesion to fn (Fig.1 A). When we immunoprecipitated CRKII from CHO lysates, we consistently observed C3G in Western blots from suspension lysates but could not do so or could do so less efficiently from adherent lysates (Fig. 1 B; also Figs. 4 C and 5 C). Similar amounts of CRKII were immunoprecipitated from both lysates. In contrast we saw no change in levels of the GRB2-SOS complex from suspended or adherent lysates (data not shown). Thus low ERK1/2 activity correlated with the presence of an immunoprecipitable CRKII-C3G complex.Figure 4Disruption of CRKII-C3G complex activates ERK. CHO cells were transfected with pHOOK, and either wild-type (wt) CRKII or its W109L variant and suspended (S) and adherent (A) lysates were prepared as above.A, equal amounts of these lysates were then analyzed for levels of ERK activity by Western blotting (WB) with a phospho-ERK antibody. The same blot was stripped and reprobed with antibodies to ERK1 and ERK2 to determine levels of ERK protein.B, to quantitate ERK activity levels, we performed densitometric analysis of the blots shown in A. Relative ERK2 activity was expressed as the amount of phosphorylated ERK2 normalized to the amount of ERK2 protein. C, equal amounts of protein from the suspended and adherent lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with an anti-CRKII antibody and recovered proteins analyzed by Western blotting with anti-CRKII and anti-C3G antibodies as indicated. D, to determine the expression of the transfected CRKII constructs, equal amounts of lysate were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-CRKII antibody.

The results illustrated are from a representative experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As C3G functions as an exchange factor for the RAS family member RAP1, we were interested if the state of integrin occupancy, and variable levels of the CRKII-C3G complex, affected the activation or GTP loading of this G protein. To determine this, we used a pull-down assay with a GST-RalGDS fusion protein that selectively binds the GTP as opposed to the GDP-bound form of RAP. When analyzed in this way, we found that levels of activated RAP were approximately 10-fold greater in suspension lysates than in adherent lysates (Fig.2). In analogous experiments using a GST-RBD fusion protein to isolate GTP-bound RAS, we found activated RAS was mostly present in adherent but not suspended cell lysates (Fig. 2). In both experiments we used an activated variant (G12V) of these GTPases as a positive control (data not shown). Thus, the state of integrin occupancy determines the nucleotide loading of the RAS and RAP GTPases, and GTP-loaded RAP is also found in lysates with low ERK activity. The downstream signaling consequences of activated RAP are dependent upon the predominant isoform of RAF present. As noted above, in certain cell types, GTP-loaded RAP is thought to be antagonistic to RAS-mediated ERK activation by competing for common effectors such as RAF1 (5.Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). However, in many neuronal cell types that express B-RAF, activated RAP stimulates rather than suppresses ERK activity (29.York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 30.Dugan L.L. Kim J.S. Zhang Y. Bart R.D. Sun Y. Holtzman D.M. Gutman D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25842-25848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). As RAP is GTP-loaded in suspended CHO cells, we would predict that overexpression of B-RAF would activate ERK in this condition. To examine this possibility we transiently transfected CHO cells with B-RAF cDNA or a vector control and determined ERK activity levels upon suspension or adhesion to fn. While CHOs transfected with the empty vector construct demonstrated background levels of ERK activity, those transfected with B-RAF had significantly greater levels of active ERK in suspension lysates (Fig.3 A). As expected, ERK activity increased upon adhesion of both cell types. Although the absolute level of ERK activity was greater in the B-RAF transfectants, when analyzed quantitatively, adhesion stimulated a 50% increase in the vector transfectants but only a 5% increase in the B-RAF transfectants. Thus ERK phosphorylation, and presumably activity, was nearly maximal in suspension lysates of the B-RAF transfectants. These results are consistent with the idea that RAP is GTP-loaded when CHOs are in suspension and that the state of RAP loading is an important determinant of ERK activity. The above data suggested that activation of RAP and inhibition of ERK activity in CHO cells was dependent upon the regulated formation of the CRKII-C3G complex. Blocking this association would therefore be predicted to activate ERK1/2 in suspension cells. To look at this possibility we have made use of a CRKII variant (W109L) with an SH3 domain mutation that abolishes interaction with C3G. When we expressed this construct in CHO cells, we observed that levels of ERK activity in suspension lysates were increased relative to cells transfected with wild-type CRKII (Fig. 4, A andB), despite comparable expression of both CRKII constructs (Fig. 4 D). Consistent with this observation and the described functional properties of this amino acid substitution, we detected little of the CRKII-C3G complex in suspension lysates of the W109L transfectants (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, cells transfected with wild-type CRKII, like untransfected CHOs, did demonstrate an immunoprecipitable CRKII-C3G complex in suspension lysates (Fig. 4 C). Thus blocking the interaction of CRKII with C3G activates ERK1/2. Studies from another group suggested that overexpression of the protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTP1B, impaired integrin-mediated up-regulation of ERK activity in 3Y1 fibroblasts, whereas a CAS binding-deficient variant of this phosphatase reversed these effects (31.Liu F. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 173-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In another study, expression of a catalytically inactive form of this phosphatase resulted in altered morphology, reduced spreading, and decreased focal contacts in mouse L fibroblasts (32.Arregui C.O. Balsamo J. Lillen J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 861-873Crossref PubMed Sc"

In the absence of cytokines, hemopoietic progenitor cells die by apoptosis. Abl PTKs mediate suppression of this apoptotic response leading to aberrant survival. To investigate the mechanism of Abl PTK action, we have used an interleukin-3-dependent murine mast cell line that expresses a temperature-sensitive form of the v-ABL PTK, which is active at the permissive temperature of 32 °C and inactive at 39 °C. At the permissive temperature, these cells are resistant to apoptosis induced both by the withdrawal of the hemopoietic growth factor (interleukin-3) and the addition of cytotoxic drugs. We demonstrate that v-Abl associates with and stimulates activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and, crucially, that this activation results in enhanced cellular levels of the mass of the second messenger phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate. Activation of PI3K leads to enhanced activity of PKB and increased levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL. Transfection of cells with a dominant negative PKB reduces both the Abl-stimulated PKB activity and the survival effect conferred by activation of this oncogene.

A complex set of interactions between cytokines, integrins, and cell surface receptors on the hemopoietic progenitor cells governs the survival, proliferation, and development of primitive cells in normal hemopoiesis. In the absence of such cytokines, non-leukemogenic progenitor cells die by apoptosis. The normal regulation of survival, proliferation, and differentiation can be disrupted by leukemogenic proteins, e.g. the Bcr/Abl protein expressed in chronic myeloid leukemia. The Abelson protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK)1 mediates suppression of apoptosis induced by growth factor withdrawal (1.Evans C.A. Owen-Lynch P.J. Whetton A.D. Dive C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1735-1738PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Abl PTK also protects against drug-induced apoptosis, a fact that may explain the resistance of CML progenitor cells to cytotoxic drugs (2.Bedi A. Zehnbauer B.A. Barber J.P. Sharkis S.J. Jones R.J. Blood. 1994; 83: 2038-2044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Chapman R.S. Whetton A.D. Chresta C.M. Dive C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 334-343PubMed Google Scholar). Other oncogenes such asbcl-2 also suppress apoptosis, and it is becoming clear that the bcl-2 family members are regulated transcriptionally and post-translationally by upstream signaling proteins (for review see Ref. 4.Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). One signal transduction pathway that is proposed to initiate cell survival is the PI3K/PKB pathway. Growth factors, such as nerve growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-1, can stimulate PI3K activity, and this activity is associated with survival of the target cells (5.Eves E.M. Xiong W. Bellacosa A. Kennedy S.G. Tsichlis P.N. Rosner M.R. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2143-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar,6.Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). In hemopoietic cells other cytokines such as IL-3 and stem cell factor also stimulate PI3K and cell survival (7.Scheid M.P. Lauener R.W. Duronio V. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The lipid product of PI3K, PIP3, functions as a second messenger that stimulates the phosphorylation and activation of PKB by PDK1, via interactions with the pleckstrin homology domain of these two kinases (8.Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKB or Akt kinase is the cellular homologue of the viral oncoprotein v-Akt that causes leukemia in mice and is related to protein kinase C (PKC) within the catalytic domain. However, PKB differs from the PKC family members by the presence of a pleckstrin homology domain at its N terminus. It has recently been shown that phosphorylations at Thr-308 and Ser-473 on PKB are required for full activation of PKB activity (8.Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R.

PKB is implicated in protecting cells from apoptosis induced by a number of agents and treatments, including UV irradiation (11.Kulik G. Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism of the survival advantage conferred by Abl PTKs, we have used the IC.DP cell line model. This murine mast cell line expresses a temperature-sensitive form of v-ABL PTK that is active as a PTK at 32 °C and inactive at 39 °C (15.Kipreos E.T. Lee G.J. Wang J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1345-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). IC.DP cells are resistant to apoptosis induced both by the withdrawal of the hemopoietic growth factor, interleukin-3 (IL-3), and the addition of cytotoxic drugs (3.Chapman R.S. Whetton A.D. Chresta C.M. Dive C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 334-343PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Evans C.A. Lord J.M. Owen-Lynch P.J. Johnson G. Dive C. Whetton A.D. J.

Another important feature of this cell line is that apoptotic suppression mediated by v-Abl in IC.DP cells occurs in the absence of cell proliferation. This allows us specifically to examine signal transduction pathways utilized by these PTKs in the suppression of apoptosis. Our previous studies have shown that this is a critical facet of this model. For example, when expressed in other cell lines, Abl PTKs stimulate cellular transformation, i.e. they stimulate both survival and proliferation. In such models the ERK1/2 and the JAK-2/signal transducers and activators of transcription pathways are activated by ABL PTK and linked to the above downstream effects (18.Cortez D. Stoica G. Pierce J.H. Pendergast A.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2589-2594PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Carlesso N. Frank D.A. Griffin J.D. J. Exp.

Cell. 1993; 75: 175-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). However, in IC.DP cells where only a survival response is observed, these pathways are not activated by Abl PTK but are activated by the growth factor IL-3 (17.Owen-Lynch P.J. Wong A.K.Y. Whetton A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5956-5962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although it has been shown that Abl PTKs can activate PI3K in other cells (12.Skorski T. Bellacosa A. Nieborowska-Skorska M. Majewski M. Martinez R. Choi J.K. Trotta R. Wlodarski P. Perrotti D.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2217-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the mechanism(s) of activation, the effect of this on cellular mass levels of PIP3 and the effects of Abl PTK on PKB have remained relatively unexplored. Similarly the role of PI3K and PKB in Abl PTK-mediated cell survival in the absence of proliferation is not clear. We demonstrate that in the IC.DP cell line, activation of the Abl PTK stimulates PI3K resulting in an increase in the mass of the second messenger PIP3, which is associated with the activation of specific isoforms of PKB. We also provide evidence that this activation of PI3K/PKB is necessary for v-Abl-mediated anti-apoptotic effects. Recombinant mouse IL-3 and polyclonal anti-Abl antibodies (Ab-3) were purchased from Calbiochem. Antibodies to phosphotyrosine, PI3K, Shc, and Cbl were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). IC2.9 and IC.DP cells were maintained in Fischer's medium supplemented with pre-selected batches of horse serum (20% v/v) and murine interleukin-3 (mIL-3). The source of mIL-3 was conditioned medium from a myeloma cell line which expresses the mouseIL-3 gene (24.Karasuyama H. Melchers F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar), and this was used at 5% v/v. Cells, maintained at 39 °C for 18 h prior to experiments, were washed in Fischer's medium to remove serum and growth factors and plated in cell culture plates at 2 × 105 cells/ml. Cells were plated in the absence of growth factor (IL-3) and/or inhibitor additions as shown. Duplicate plates were set up, one of which was incubated at the restrictive (39 °C) and one at the permissive (32 °C) temperature. Aliquots of cells were removed from each well, at 24-h intervals, over 3 days, and cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Results were expressed as percent viable cells in the culture (i.e.viable cell count/(viable + dead cell count) × 100%). Cells were maintained at 39 or 32 °C overnight before washing cells three times and resuspending in Fischer's medium without supplements. Cells were maintained at the relevant temperature for a further 4 h before switching to the alternative temperature or stimulating with recombinant IL-3 for the times shown. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmbenzamidine). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies raised against p85, Cbl, Abl, or phosphotyrosine as described previously (17.Owen-Lynch P.J. Wong A.K.Y. Whetton A.D. J. Biol.

An aliquot of the immunoprecipitate was incubated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and loaded onto a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel.

In order to assay the activity of PKB, antibodies to specific PKB isoforms were pre-coupled with protein G beads and incubated with cell lysates (prepared as described above) for an hour at 4 °C with agitation on a shaking platform. The protein G beads were spun down in a microcentrifuge and washed twice with buffer A (as above) and twice with buffer B (50 mmTris/HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100). The PKB activities in these immunoprecipitates were assayed as described (9.Walker K.S. Deak M. Paterson A. Hudson K. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained at 39 °C overnight before washing cells three times and resuspending in Fischer's medium without supplements. Cells were maintained at 39 °C for further 4 h and then switched to 32 °C for 2 h in the presence and absence of LY294002. Cells were harvested and lipids were extracted and used in a PIP3 mass assay using the detailed procedure described previously (26.van der Kaay J. Batty I.H. Cross D.A.E. Watt P.W. Downes C.P. J.

A full-length human PKBα construct was isolated from a skeletal muscle cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). A hemagglutinin-antigen epitope tag was incorporated into the N terminus of the PKB gene by polymerase chain reaction, and the resulting construct was subcloned into the EcoRI-KpnI site of the pCMV5 vector. Kinase-dead PKB was created by mutating Asp-292 to Ala using Quickchange mutagenesis system (Stratagene). Cell lines were transfected as described previously (27.Spooncer E. Fairbairn L. Cowling G.J. Dexter T.M. Whetton A.D. Owen Lynch P.J. Leukemia (Balt.). 1994; 8: 620-630PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Pierce A. Owen-Lynch P.J. Spooncer E. Dexter T.M. Whetton A.D. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, IC.DP cells were transiently transfected with the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus-based vector, pM5 alone (control), or vector carrying the dominant negative kinase-dead PKB. In order to study survival pathways, we used a simple, readily manipulated cell system, the IC.DP murine pre-mast cell line that depends upon v-Abl PTK for survival or IL-3 for survival and proliferation. Our previous data have shown that activation of v-Abl PTK in IC.DP cells resulted in autophosphorylation of v-Abl, which was detectable 2 h after temperature switch and was maximal by 4 h (29.Owen P.J. Musk P. Evans C.A. Whetton A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15696-15703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins, achieved by switching cells to the permissive temperature for v-Abl PTK activity, was also maximal by 4 h and remained elevated indefinitely until the cells were returned to the restrictive temperature (29.Owen P.J. Musk P. Evans C.A. Whetton A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15696-15703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have now investigated the effect of v-Abl PTK on the PI3K activity associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. As shown in Fig.1 A, there is detectable increase in the PI3K activity associated with this protein fraction after cells have been incubated at permissive temperature for 1 h, and this activity peaked at 2 h and remained elevated. When cells were returned to restrictive temperatures, the PI3K activity dropped down to basal level within an hour (Fig. 1 B). Thus v-Abl PTK appears to activate PI3K. Definitive proof of activation of this PI3K in cells is the presence of elevated mass levels of the product of this enzyme, PIP3. As shown in Table I, there is an approximately 2-fold increase in the mass of PIP3 mass after 2 h at the permissive temperature for Abl PTK activity. Thus v-Abl PTK activates PI3K leading to elevated levels of the second messenger PIP3.Table IChange in PIP3 mass in IC.DP cells in response to v-Abl activationpmol PIP3/mg proteinExperiment 139 °C0.65 ± 0.1232 °C1.38 ± 0.1832 °C + LYNot detectableExperiment 239 °C0.72 ± 0.1832 °C1.25 ± 0.1232 °C + LYNot detectableExperiment 339 °C1.5 ± 0.1532 °C2.6 ± 0.532 °C + LYNot detectableFor measurement of PIP3 mass, cells were maintained at 39 °C overnight before washing cells three times and resuspending in Fisher's medium without supplements. Cells were maintained at 39 °C for further 4 h and then switched to 32 °C for 2 h in the presence and absence of LY. Cells were harvested, and lipids were extracted, and PIP3 mass assays were performed. Open table in a new tab For measurement of PIP3 mass, cells were maintained at 39 °C overnight before washing cells three times and resuspending in Fisher's medium without supplements. Cells were maintained at 39 °C for further 4 h and then switched to 32 °C for 2 h in the presence and absence of LY. Cells were harvested, and lipids were extracted, and PIP3 mass assays were performed. In order to determine whether this elevation of PI3K activity has a role in the anti-apoptotic effect of the Abl PTK, experiments were performed using the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (30.Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measurement of PIP3mass levels after treatment of cells with LY (20 μm) shows that this is sufficient to inhibit completely the rise in PIP3 levels usually observed after temperature switch (Table I). In agreement with our previously published data, there is rapid cell death after growth factor (IL-3) removal from the culture medium of the parental IC2.9 cell lines at 39 or 32 °C (Fig.2, A and B) and from v-Abl- transfected IC.DP at restrictive temperature (39 °C) (Fig. 2 C). We have previously shown that these cells are dying via apoptosis (1.Evans C.A. Owen-Lynch P.J. Whetton A.D. Dive C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1735-1738PubMed Google Scholar). The PI3K inhibitor LY has no significant effect on the kinetics or extent of apoptosis induced by IL-3 withdrawal under these three conditions. In contrast, activation of v-Abl at the permissive temperature (32 °C) results in maintained cell survival, even in the absence of growth factor, over a 3-day period. This survival is inhibited by over 75% when the PI3K inhibitor is included in the cultures. Thus activation of PI3K appears to play a key role in the survival effects of the abl oncogene. What are the downstream effects of PI3K activation that may mediate suppression of apoptosis by the Abl PTK? Several studies have suggested that the effects of PI3K on cell survival are mediated by PKB (10.Andjelkovic M. Suidan H.S. Meier R. Frech M. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11.Kulik G. Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 14.Khwaja A.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The effect of Abl on PKB activity was therefore determined. The individual isoforms of PKB were assessed separately. In IC.DP cells PKBβ activity is almost undetectable. The activity data are in agreement with data analyzing the expression patterns of PKB isoforms in the IC.DP cells as PKBβ was not detected in cell lysates by Western blotting (Fig. 4 B). Both the α and γ isoforms of PKC were expressed in the cells, and their expression was independent of temperature. The activity of these two isoforms was markedly increased when cells were incubated at the permissive temperature for Abl PTK activity. PKBα and -γ activation peaked at approximately 4 h and then remained elevated indefinitely (Fig. 3 A). Switching off v-Abl PTK activity by maintaining cells at the restrictive temperature (39 °C) resulted in rapid decrease of PKB activity (Fig. 3 B). Preincubating cells in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor LY abolished v-Abl-mediated activation of both PKB isoforms (Fig. 4 A). Activation of v-Abl protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) leads to increased levels of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-XL. By having shown that v-Abl can activate PI3K and subsequently PKB, we reasoned that this pathway may play a role in the up-regulation of Bcl-XL by v-Abl. As expected, switching on v-Abl PTK activity by culturing cells at the permissive temperature (32 °C) for 6 h resulted in an approximately 2-fold increase in Bcl-XL expression compared with cells cultured at the restrictive temperature (39 °C). This increase in Bcl-XLexpression was completely blocked by including LY in the cultures such that the levels of Bcl-XL expression were equivalent to those in cells maintained at the restrictive temperature (Fig.5). Thus PI3K and PKB may play a role in the up-regulation of Bcl-XL expression, leading to enhanced cell survival. Retroviral mediated transfer of a dominant negative form of PKB was carried out in order to determine whether enhanced PKB activity was required for Abl-induced cell survival. Transfection of IC.DP cells resulted in a reduction in Abl-stimulated PKB activity at 32 °C to 55 ± 5% (n = 2, mean ± range) of the activity in control cells transfected with vector only. This reduction in activity was mirrored by a decline in Abl PTK-stimulated survival in the absence of IL-3 (Fig. 6). Expression of the dominant negative PKB reduced the viability of IC.DP cells at 32°C to 57 ± 11% (n = 3, mean ± S.E.) that observed in the control cells. Thus, Abl-induced activation of PKB is required for the anti-apoptotic effects of this oncogene. As shown in Fig. 1 v-Abl activation leads to the increase of PI3K activity associated with anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates. This finding lead us to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the activation of PI3K by Abl PTK. The adapter protein SHC is known to be associated with PI3K in some v-Abl- and Bcr-Abl-transformed cells (12.Skorski T. Bellacosa A. Nieborowska-Skorska M. Majewski M. Martinez R. Choi J.K. Trotta R. Wlodarski P. Perrotti D. Chan T.O. Wasik M.A. Tsichlis P.N. Calabretta B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6151-6161Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). 2D. Xenaki and P. J. Owen-Lynch, unpublished observations. In IC.DP cells, IL-3 stimulation resulted in phosphorylation of SHC, and we have previously demonstrated that Abl PTK also stimulates phosphorylation of SHC on tyrosine residues (17.Owen-Lynch P.J. Wong A.K.Y. Whetton A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5956-5962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). By using antibodies raised against SHC, we can demonstrate that SHC protein co-immunoprecipitates with the p85 subunit of PI3K in IC.DP cells at 39 and 32 °C. However, this association is constitutive (i.e. independent of temperature), and the associated PI3K is inactive at both the restrictive and permissive temperatures (Fig. 7 D). Thus in IC.DP cells, enhanced activity of PI3K in response to v-Abl PTK is not mediated directly through enhanced interaction with this phosphorylated adapter protein. Several recent findings support the notion that the proto-oncogenecbl is involved in signal transduction pathways; in particular, Cbl has been implicated as an adapter protein for PI3K in epidermal growth factor-stimulated PC12 cells (32.Kim T.J. Kim Y.T. Pillai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27504-27509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), antigen-stimulated B cells, and T cell receptor cross-linked Jurkat cells (33.Soltoff S.P. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 563-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 34.Hartley D. Meisner H. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18260-18263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We studied the role of Cbl in PI3K pathway in IC.DP cells. Since Cbl has several potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites, we initially studied tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl following v-Abl activation. Both IL-3 stimulation and v-Abl activation caused tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl (Fig. 7, A and B). By using immunoprecipitation and Western blotting approaches, we found that, in common with the results obtained with Shc, Cbl and p85 were constitutively associated, i.e. the amount of p85 associated with Cbl did not increase following IL-3 stimulation or Abl activation (Fig. 7 C). To provide further evidence of the association between p85 and Cbl, anti-Cbl immunoprecipitates were assayed for PI3K activity. As shown in Fig. 7 D, v-Abl activation resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in the activity of the fraction of PI3K associated with Cbl. Similarly, the PI3K activity associated with anti-Abl immunoprecipitates was examined. V-Abl activation resulted in an approximately 2-fold increase in PI3K activity associated with the Abl protein. However, again, activation of the Abl PTK did not affect the levels of p85 associated with v-Abl, i.e. a fraction of the cellular p85 is constitutively associated with Abl in a temperature-independent manner, and increased activity of Abl PTK leads to enhanced activity of this fraction. v-Abl protein-tyrosine kinase potently suppresses apoptosis, induced by cytokine withdrawal, in various hemopoietic cell lines, including pre-mast cells (1.Evans C.A. Owen-Lynch P.J. Whetton A.D. Dive C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1735-1738PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Evans C.A. Lord J.M. Owen-Lynch P.J. Johnson G. Dive C. Whetton A.D. J.

The molecular mechanisms involved in the suppression of apoptosis by the v-Abl protein-tyrosine kinase are not yet clear. By using the IC.DP cell line model, where Abl stimulates survival but not proliferation upon growth factor removal from the cells, we have investigated the role of PI3K in the anti-apoptotic effects of this oncogene. We have now confirmed, in agreement with others (12.Skorski T. Bellacosa A. Nieborowska-Skorska M. Majewski M. Martinez R. Choi J.K. Trotta R. Wlodarski P. Perrotti D. Chan T.O.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2217-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), that activation of PI3K by Abl PTK does occur and, more importantly, by using our novel mass assay for PIP3, that this activation does result in an increase in the mass of the product PIP3in the cells. This result is important. Previously due to radiolabeling difficulties in these and other hemopoietic cells, it was not possible to demonstrate that in vitro PI3K activity measurements did correlate with an increase in the amount of the PIP3 second messenger in vivo. Recently there have been a number of reports examining the effects of PI3K inhibition on cell survival. It was noted that PI3K was important for cell survival of MC-9 mast cells when they were grown in stem cell factor or IL-3 (7.Scheid M.P. Lauener R.W. Duronio V. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and PI3K is important for the survival of PC12 cells, a model system for sympathetic neurones (31.Philpott K.L. McCarthy M.J. Klippel A. Rubin L.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). By using the PI3K inhibitor LY, we found that the effect of v-Abl on cell survival in the absence of IL-3 can be inhibited by preincubating cells with LY. Thus PI3K is necessary for the suppression of apoptosis induced by the oncogene v-abl. Elevated cellular levels of the second messenger PIP3 lead to activation of PKB, another protein kinase that has been shown to be important as the downstream effector of PI3K leading to cell survival (see Introduction). PKB is activated following v-Abl PTK activation in IC.DP cells, and this PKB activity is dependent on PI3K activity. Of the three isoforms of PKB assessed in this study, only PKBα and PKBγ are expressed in IC.DP cells. Abl PTK activates both of these isoforms (up to a 6-fold enhancement of activity) in a PI3K-dependent manner. Several reports examining the signal transduction pathways leading to growth factor-induced survival of hemopoietic cells (35.Craddock B.L. Orchiston E.A. Hinton H.J. Welham M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10633-10640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 36.Dijkers P.F. van Dijk T.B. de Groot R.P. Raaijmakers J.A. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 7002-7009PubMed Google Scholar) and aberrant survival in cancer cells (38.Carson J.P. Kulik G. Weber M.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1449-1453PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that activation of PKB is not a necessary component of survival signaling. Our experiments using expression of a dominant negative PKB to reduce the level of PKB activation in response to the Abl PTK demonstrate that activation of PKB is required for Abl-mediated survival effects. The mechanism of PKB-mediated survival has been partly elucidated in other cell systems. In growth factor-stimulated cells, activated PKB phosphorylates the pro-apoptotic protein, BAD (39.Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4957) Google Scholar, 40.del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). This protein, in its dephosphorylated form, constitutively associates with the Bcl-2 family member, Bcl-XL, and induces apoptosis of some cells. However, once phosphorylated by PKB at Ser-136 BAD dissociates from Bcl-XL, and Bcl-XL is free to exert its anti-apoptotic effect (39.Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4957) Google Scholar, 40.del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). In oncogenic transformation by Abl PTKs and other oncogenes, increases in the levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members are often observed (12.Skorski T. Bellacosa A. Nieborowska-Skorska M. Majewski M. Martinez R. Choi J.K. Trotta R. Wlodarski P. Perrotti D. Chan T.O. Wasik M.A. Tsichlis P.N. Calabretta B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6151-6161Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 41.Chen Q. Turner J. Watson A.J. Dive C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We have now demonstrated up-regulation of Bcl-XL levels by v-Abl PTK is mediated through activation of PI3K, presumably through the activity of downstream substrates of PKB on specific transcription mechanisms. One important question concerns the molecular mechanism utilized by Abl PTKs to associate with and activate PI3K. By using our inducible system we have investigated the role of two proteins that have been put forward as the link between Abl and PI3K. The proto-oncogenecbl (shown here) and the adapter protein Shc (17.Owen-Lynch P.J. Wong A.K.Y. Whetton A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5956-5962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) both become tyrosine-phosphorylated in IC.DP cells after v-Abl activation, and both of these can associate with the p85 subunit of PI3K. However, the activity of the fraction of PI3K that is associated with either of these two proteins is not stimulated to any significant extent by the activation v-Abl PTK. There is a small amount of enhanced PI3K activity associated with Cbl after temperature switch to the permissive temperature, but this is a very small proportion of the overall activation of the PI3K activity as compared with the activity in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates. In contrast, the extent of activation associated with anti-phosphotyrosine at the permissive temperature is comparable to the activity associated with anti-Abl immunoprecipitates at the same temperature. This suggests that the fraction of cellular PI3K that is associated with Abl (either directly or through other protein-protein contacts) is the important fraction. Growth factor-mediated activation of PI3K usually occurs by binding of the SH2 domains of the PI3K regulatory subunit, p85, to phosphorylated YXXM motifs on the relevant growth factor receptor. However, although YXXM motifs can be can be identified within the Abl sequence, it is not clear that these motifs are in fact responsible for direct binding of the p85 subunit of PI3K. In our inducible system, the constitutive association of Abl with p85 does not appear to be dependent on tyrosine kinase activity and is thus likely to be independent of SH2-phosphotyrosine interactions. The association must therefore be mediated through other protein domains. For example, the SH3 domain of Abl may interact with the proline-rich region of p85 subunit of PI3K as has been observed in vitro (42.Kapeller R. Prasad K.V. Janssen O. Hou W. Schaffhausen B.S. Rudd C.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1927-1933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly it is possible that the association between Abl and p85 is mediated through other intermediate binding proteins. Our previous work has examined other signal transduction pathways that may be involved in Abl PTK function. In contrast to the results in other cell lines where Abl PTKs stimulate cellular transformation,i.e. they stimulate both survival and proliferation, the ERK1/2 and the JAK-2/signal transducers and activators of transcription pathways are not activated by ABL PTK in IC.DP cells, where only a survival response is observed (17.Owen-Lynch P.J. Wong A.K.Y. Whetton A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5956-5962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, evidence does point to a role for a specific protein kinase C isoform, PKCβII. This protein is translocated to the nucleus upon activation of Abl PTK, and inhibition of PKC reverses the survival response (16.Evans C.A. Lord J.M. Owen-Lynch P.J. Johnson G. Dive C. Whetton A.D. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2591-2598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper we have shown that Abl PTK-induced activation of PI3K activity is associated with enhanced cellular levels of the second messenger PIP3, consequent PKB activity, and enhanced levels of Bcl-XL. Both PI3K and PKB are necessary for the anti-apoptotic effects of Abl PTK and thus may play a role in vivo in the growth and survival advantage conferred on leukemic cells by this oncogene. It remains to be determined whether there are any interrelationships between the PKCβII and PI3K/PKB pathways and how these mediate up-regulation of Bcl-XL expression in response to Abl PTK activation. We thank Dr. Jeroen van der Kaay for providing help in PIP3 mass assay and Drs. Maria Deak and Dario Alessi for providing us the dominant negative PKB construct."
https://openalex.org/W1983814360,"The HNF3/fork head family includes a large number of transcription factors that share a structurally related DNA binding domain. Fork head factors have been shown to play important roles both during development and in the adult. We now describe the cloning of a novel mammalian fork head factor that we have named FHX (fork head homologous X (FHX), which is expressed in many adult tissues. In the embryo, FHX expression showed a very early onset during the cleavage stages of preimplantation development. Polymerase chain reaction-assisted site selection experiments showed that FHX bound DNA with a dual sequence specificity. Sites recognized by FHX could be classified into two different types according to their sequences. Binding of FHX to sequences of each type appeared to occur independently. Our data suggest that either different regions of the fork head domain or different molecular forms of this domain could be involved in binding of FHX to each type of site. In transfection assays, FHX was capable of activating transcription from promoters containing FHX sites of either type."

Several cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors have been defined for control of the LHβ promoter through heterologous cell culture models. In this report, we describe the identification of bipartite NF-Y (CBF/CP1) binding sites within the proximal bovine LHβ promoter. When multimerized, one of these sites activates the heterologous, minimal HSV thymidine kinase promoter in the gonadotrope-derived cell line αT3-1. The functional role of the promoter-distal site in regulating the full-length bovine LHβ promoter was assessed in vivousing transgenic mice harboring a mutant promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. While this element is important for conferring high level activity of the LHβ promoter in pituitary, it does not appear to be essential for mediating gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) regulation. This is the first characterization of a cis-acting element within this GnRH-dependent promoter that is restricted to regulating basal expression and not GnRH-induced activity."
https://openalex.org/W1987205661,"Glycoprotein (GP) Ib, an adhesion receptor expressed on both platelets and endothelial cells, mediates the binding of von Willebrand factor (vWF). Platelet GPIb plays an important role in platelet adhesion and activation, whereas the interaction of vWF and endothelial GPIb is not fully understood. We report here that agkistin, a snake venom protein, selectively blocks the interaction of vWF with human endothelial GPIb and inhibits angiogenesis in vivo. Agkistin specifically blocked human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) adhesion to immobilized vWF in a concentration-dependent manner. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated agkistin bound to HUVECs in a saturable manner. AP1, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) raised against GPIb, specifically inhibited the binding of FITC-conjugated agkistin to HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner, but other anti-integrin mAbs raised against αvβ3, α2β1, and α5β1did not affect this binding reaction. However, neither agkistin (2 μg/ml) nor AP1 (40 μg/ml) apparently reduced HUVEC viability. Both agkistin and AP1 exhibited a profound anti-angiogenic effectin vivo when assayed by using the 10-day-old embryo chick chorioallantoic membrane model. These results suggest endothelial GPIb plays a role in spontaneous angiogenesis in vivo, and the anti-angiogenic effect of agkistin may be because of disruption of the interaction of endogenous vWF with endothelial GPIb. Glycoprotein (GP) Ib, an adhesion receptor expressed on both platelets and endothelial cells, mediates the binding of von Willebrand factor (vWF). Platelet GPIb plays an important role in platelet adhesion and activation, whereas the interaction of vWF and endothelial GPIb is not fully understood. We report here that agkistin, a snake venom protein, selectively blocks the interaction of vWF with human endothelial GPIb and inhibits angiogenesis in vivo. Agkistin specifically blocked human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) adhesion to immobilized vWF in a concentration-dependent manner. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated agkistin bound to HUVECs in a saturable manner. AP1, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) raised against GPIb, specifically inhibited the binding of FITC-conjugated agkistin to HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner, but other anti-integrin mAbs raised against αvβ3, α2β1, and α5β1did not affect this binding reaction. However, neither agkistin (2 μg/ml) nor AP1 (40 μg/ml) apparently reduced HUVEC viability. Both agkistin and AP1 exhibited a profound anti-angiogenic effectin vivo when assayed by using the 10-day-old embryo chick chorioallantoic membrane model. These results suggest endothelial GPIb plays a role in spontaneous angiogenesis in vivo, and the anti-angiogenic effect of agkistin may be because of disruption of the interaction of endogenous vWF with endothelial GPIb. extracellular matrix 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and -6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester bovine serum albumin chorioallantoic membrane fluorescein isothiocyanate glycoprotein human umbilical vein endothelial cell monoclonal antibody 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide phosphate-buffered saline von Willebrand factor Angiogenesis, the development of new capillaries from preexisting blood vessels, plays a critical role in a variety of physiological processes and pathological conditions, including embryonic development, wound healing, tumor growth, metastasis, and various inflammatory disorders (1.Folkman J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 1757-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). Interactions between endothelial cells and extracellular matrices (ECMs)1 including fibrinogen, vitronectin, collagen, laminin, and vWF, through cell surface adhesion receptors, are involved in the multiprocesses of neovascularization (2.Stromblad S. Cheresh D.A. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 881-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). For example, integrin αvβ3 is not readily detectable in quiescent vessels but becomes highly expressed in angiogenic vessels (3.Brook P.C. Clark R.A.F. Cheresh D.A. Science. 1994; 264: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (2741) Google Scholar). The dependence of angiogenesis on vascular cell adhesion events in vivo is evidenced by the observation that antibody and snake venom proteins antagonizing integrin αvβ3 blocked angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model (4.Brook P.C. Montgomery A.M.P. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A. Hu T. Klier G. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2181) Google Scholar, 5.Yeh C.H. Peng H.C. Huang T.F. Blood. 1998; 92: 3268-3276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GPIb is an adhesive receptor expressed both on platelets and endothelial cells. Binding of plasma vWF to platelet GPIb plays a critical role in the earliest phase of primary hemostasis, which consists of the anchoring of platelets to injury vessel walls (6.Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18172-18178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the platelets, the functions of endothelial GPIb for vWF are not well understood. Several studies have demonstrated the presence of GPIb complex expressed on the endothelial cell surface and up-regulation of endothelial GPIb by cytokines, i.e. tumor necrosis factor and interferon γ (7.Wu G. Essex D.W. Meloni F.J. Takafuta T. Fujimura K. Konkle B.A. Shapiro S.S. Blood. 1997; 90: 2660-2669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Beacham D.A. Tran L.-P. Shapiro S.S.

It has been shown that endothelial GPIb participates in HUVEC binding to sickle cell erythrocytes (11.Wick T.M. Moake J.L. Udden M.M. McIntire L.V. Am. J. Hematol. 1993; 42: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and also promotes platelet bridging to endothelial cells (12.Bombeli T. Schwartz B.R. Harian J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Recently, Lian et al. (13.Lian J. Guoping C. Shapiro S.S. Tran L.-P. Beacham D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) assumed that endothelial GPIb may contribute to mediate the process of endothelial cell migration during wound repair in vivo. Snake venoms contain many unique components that affect cell-matrix interaction. Disintegrins represent a family of low molecular weight, cysteine-rich polypeptides that bind specifically to integrins αIIbβ3, α5β1, and αvβ3 expressed on platelets and other cells including vascular endothelial cells and some tumor cells, leading to inhibition of platelet aggregation, inhibition of cell adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis (14.Gould R.J. Polokoff M.A. Friedman P.A. Huang T.F. Holt J.C. Cook J.T. Niewiarowski S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1990; 195: 168-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). On the other hand, some GPIb-binding venom proteins modulate vWF-GPIb interaction, leading to platelet activation, inhibition of platelet aggregation (15.Fujimura Y. Kawasaki T. Titani K. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), or mediating HUVEC adhesion (16.Tan L. Kowalska M.A. Romo G.M. Lopez J.A. Darzynkiewicz Z. Niewiarowski S. Blood. 1999; 93: 2605-2616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Agkistin (also named agkicetin (17.Chen Y.L. Tsai I.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)), belonging to C-type lectin polypeptide derived from the viper venom ofAgkistrodon acutus, specifically inhibited human platelet aggregation and agglutination triggered by ristocetin in the presence of vWF in vitro by acting as the platelet GPIb antagonist (18.Huang T.F. Yeh C.H. Abstracts of Third Sino-Japanese Symposium on Coagulation, Fibrinolysis and Platelets. Kobe, Japan1994Google Scholar). Furthermore, agkistin is a potent anti-thrombotic agent because it pronouncedly blocked platelet plug formation in an experimental model in vivo. 2C-H. Yeh, M-C. Chang, H-C. Peng, and T-F. Huang, manuscript in preparation. In this study, we showed that agkistin specifically inhibited HUVEC adhesion to immobilized vWF and it was shown to bind endothelial GPIb in a saturable manner. The role of endothelial GPIb in angiogenesisin vivo was thus evaluated. Agkistin was purified from crude venom of Formosan Agkistrodon acutus by means of gel filtration and ion exchanger as described previously (18.Huang T.F. Yeh C.H. Abstracts of Third Sino-Japanese Symposium on Coagulation, Fibrinolysis and Platelets. Kobe, Japan1994Google Scholar). The homogeneity of agkistin was judged by both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis and N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Rhodostomin was isolated from Agkistrodon rhodostoma venom as described previously (19.Huang, T. F., Ouyang, C., and Teng, C. M. (1990) Abstracts of Eleventh International Congress on Thrombosis, Ljubljana, YugoslaviaGoogle Scholar). Human plasma purified vWF was purchased from Calbiochem, and vitronectin was from Life Technologies, Inc. The mAbs AP1 raised against GPIb (20.Okita J.R. Pidard D. Newman P.J. Montgomery R.R. Kunicki T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and 7E3 raised against integrin αIIbβ3 and αvβ3(21.Coller B.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) were kindly donated by Dr. Robert Montgomery (Southern Wisconsin Milwaukee Blood Center, Milwaukee, WI) and Dr. Barry Coller (Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, NY), respectively. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and -6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF/AM) were purchased from Molecular Probes. 3-[4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), collagen type I, and fibronectin were from Sigma. HUVECs were isolated from umbilical cord veins and maintained in Medium 199 containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 30 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement, 4 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics at 37 °C with 5% CO2 incubation. The cells were identified as positively immunofluorescent staining for human vWF antigen (DAKO) and used between the second and fourth passages. Synchronized HUVECs were harvested and labeled with BCECF/AM (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing, cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of agkistin or PBS for another 30 min. Control or the pretreated HUVECs were applied onto ECM-precoated plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C allowing adhesion. After incubation, the non-adherent cells were removed by aspiration, and plates were subjected to a CytoFluor 2300 fluorescence plate reader (Minipore). The percent adherent HUVECs toward fibronectin (30 μg/ml), vitronectin (10 μg/ml), and vWF (10 μg/ml) was calculated to be 49.2 ± 2.2, 24.0 ± 0.7, and 40.9 ± 1.5%, respectively, based on the cell count by hemacytometer (Hausser Scientific) after trypsin deattachment. The amount of nonspecific adhesion was performed by using wells precoated with 1% BSA and estimated to be 3.26 ± 0.8%. Cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates (Costar) followed by incubation with agkistin, AP1, rhodostomin, or vehicle for 48 h in a humidified atmosphere (i.e. 37 °C, 5% CO2). For MTT assay, cells were incubated with MTT at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml for 4 h. After incubation, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and then the developed color absorbance at 550 nm was measured. HUVECs (1 × 106) were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and then incubated with FITC-conjugated agkistin or FITC-conjugated BSA for 30 min. After incubation, cells were washed twice and resuspended in PBS and analyzed immediately by fluorescence-activated cell sorter(Calibur, Becton Dickinson) using excitation and emission wavelength of 488 and 525 nm, respectively. In inhibitory studies, mAb 7E3 or AP1 was added to fixed HUVEC for 30 min prior to the incubation of FITC-conjugated proteins. Eggs of 10-day-old chick embryo were opened with a 1.0-cm square window that allowed direct access to underlying CAM by the method described previously (22.Masood R. McGarvey M.E. Zheng T. Cai J. Arora N. Smith D.L. Sloane N. Gill P.S. Blood. 1999; 92: 1038-1044Crossref Google Scholar). A filter paper disc (1.3 cm, Minipore) saturated with test compounds or an equal aliquot of PBS (final volume in 20 μl) was applied to the top of CAM. The window was covered with sterile cellophane tape, and the embryos were incubated for a further 48 h at 37 °C with 60% humidity to develop spontaneous angiogenesis. Multiple adhesive receptors expressed on endothelial cells mediate adhesion to extracellular matrices. First, we examined the effect of agkistin on HUVEC adhesion to a number of immobilized ECMs including collagen type I (80 μg/ml), fibronectin (30 μg/ml), vitronectin (10 μg/ml), and vWF (10 μg/ml). As shown in Fig.1, agkistin specifically and dose dependently inhibited HUVEC adhesion to immobilized vWF (48.98 ± 4.12% inhibition at 0.066 μm) but apparently little affected those adhesive events toward other matrices used (less than 10% inhibition). Agkistin at a high concentration of 0.2 μm did not exhibit a further inhibition on HUVEC adhesion to immobilized vWF (about 52% inhibition, data not shown). These results indicate that agkistin does not interfere with the adhesion of integrins αvβ3, α2β1, and α5β1and their respective ligands, vitronectin, collagen, and fibronectin. The interaction of vWF with HUVECs is mediated by endothelial integrin αvβ3 and by GPIb complex (16.Tan L. Kowalska M.A. Romo G.M. Lopez J.A. Darzynkiewicz Z. Niewiarowski S. Blood. 1999; 93: 2605-2616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, agkistin may process a rather specific binding and high affinity toward GPIb on HUVEC and functionally block vWF-endothelial GPIb interaction. A similar result (40–50%) was reported with echicetin, another GPIb antagonist (23.Peng M. Lu W. Beviglia L. Niewiarowski S. Kirby E.P. Blood. 1993; 81: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further explore the binding receptor of agkistin on HUVECs, we conjugated agkistin and BSA with FITC by a previously described method (24.Liu C.Z. Wang Y.W. Shen M.C. Huang T.F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 919-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and then examined the binding reaction of FITC-conjugated agkistin toward HUVEC by flow cytometry. Nonspecific binding was performed using FITC-BSA as a probe. After incubation of FITC-conjugated agkistin with HUVECs, the increment of relative fluorescence intensity of FITC-agkistin bound cells was concentration-dependent and reached a saturated binding at a concentration of 1 μm (Fig.2). The different concentration range of agkistin used in this binding assay and in the cell adhesive assay (Fig. 1) is attributable to the different number of cells used in the two independent systems (i.e. 1 × 106cells for agkistin binding and 5 × 104 cells for cell adhesion). Thus, the concentration of agkistin in reaching binding saturation is about 14-fold higher than the maximal effective concentration used in adhesion study (1.0 versus 0.07 μm). AP1, a mAb raised against the N-terminal 45-kDa domain of GPIbα (25.Andrews R.K. Berndt M.C. Histol. Histopathol. 1998; 13: 837-844PubMed Google Scholar), exerted a dose-dependent inhibition on the binding of FITC-agkistin to HUVECs. However, all of anti-αvβ3 mAb 7E3 and anti-α2β1, α3β1, α4β1, and α5β1 integrin mAbs (50 μ g/ml, Chemicon) did not affect this binding (Fig. 3 and data not shown). These data indicate that agkistin and AP1 might bind to a common epitope on endothelial GPIbα whereas agkistin did not bind to other endothelial integrins including αvβ3, α2β1, and α5β1, consistent with the inference obtained from the above described adhesive experiment.Figure 3Effect of mAbs on the binding of FITC-conjugated agkistin to HUVECs. HUVECs (1 × 106 cells) pretreated with 7E3 (A,thick line, 50 μg/ml), various concentrations of AP1 (B–D, thick lines, 10, 20, or 50 μg/ml, respectively), or nonimmune IgG (A–D, gray areas) were incubated with FITC-conjugated agkistin (0.5 μm) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Nonspecific binding was carried out by incubating cells with FITC-conjugated BSA (A–D, thin lines, 0.5 μm). Similar results were obtained in at least four separate experiments. E, quantitative analyses of the binding of FITC-agkistin and FITC-BSA in the presence of mAbs were presented as mean fluorescence intensity. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. (n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Primary endothelial cells are anchorage-dependent, and disruption of integrin-ECM interaction induces HUVEC death (26.Ruoslahti E. Reed J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 477-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar, 27.Meredith J.E. Fazeli B. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). In addition, αvβ3 receptor blockade resulted in unscheduled programmed cell death (apoptosis) of proliferating vascular cells (4.Brook P.C. Montgomery A.M.P. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A. Hu T. Klier G. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2181) Google Scholar). Recently, Feng et al. (28.Feng S. Christodoulide N. Kroll M.H. Blood. 1999; 93: 4256-4263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that GPIb complex expressed on Chinese hamster ovary cells regulates cell proliferation. Thus, it is interesting to investigate if the blockade of endothelial GPIb reduces the viability of primary endothelial cells. HUVEC viability assay was performed by determining the cell metabolic activity with MTT. As shown in Fig. 4, neither agkistin (at a high concentration of 2 μg/ml, i.e.0.066 μm), which exerted a maximal effect in blocking vWF-HUVEC adhesion (Fig. 1), nor AP1 (40 μg/ml) affected HUVEC viability. However, rhodostomin (2 μg/ml), a member of disintegrins, significantly reduced HUVEC viability. These data suggest that blockade of the vWF-endothelial GPIb interaction is not sufficient to induce cell death and endothelial GPIb receptor is not essential for cell survival. Several useful models have been used to study the role of cell adhesion molecule in angiogenesis. One of the most common in vivo models is the chick embryo CAM assay (29.Stromblad S. Cheresh D.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 462-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of endothelial GPIb complex in neovascularization in vivo, the effects of agkistin and anti-GPIb mAb AP1 on spontaneous angiogenesis occurring in the chick CAM model were examined. Upon dissection of the CAM of 12-day-old chick embryo, both agkistin (Fig.5, B and C) and AP1 (Fig. 5, D and E), which were topically applied on CAM for 48 h, dose dependently inhibited the spontaneous angiogenesis in the CAM model as examined under filter disc as compared with control CAMs (Fig. 5 A, PBS). These data suggest that endothelial GPIb receptor may significantly contribute to spontaneous angiogenesis in vivo. Moreover, blockade of vWF-GPIb interaction either by anti-GPIb mAb (i.e. AP1) or by polypeptide (i.e. agkistin) markedly inhibited neovascularization. On the other hand, accutin, a disintegrin derived from the same viper venom of A. acutus, inhibited angiogenesis by acting as endothelial integrin αvβ3 antagonist and by inducing apoptosis (5.Yeh C.H. Peng H.C. Huang T.F. Blood. 1998; 92: 3268-3276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, snake venom constituents affect cell-matrix interaction via multiple mechanisms, resulting in modification of platelet and vascular cell behaviors, an important cellular process in thrombosis, hemostasis, and angiogenesis (30.Huang T.F. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 52: 527-540Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Furthermore, at a higher dose (2 μg/embryo), both agkistin and AP1 significantly disrupted preexisting blood vessels as evidenced by disappearance of large vessels (Fig. 5, C and E). This is different from the previous observation with integrin αvβ3antagonists, which inhibited angiogenesis without affecting preexisting blood vessels (4.Brook P.C. Montgomery A.M.P. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A. Hu T. Klier G. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2181) Google Scholar, 5.Yeh C.H. Peng H.C. Huang T.F. Blood. 1998; 92: 3268-3276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the action mechanisms of anti-angiogenic activity elicited by endothelial GPIb antagonists are quietly different from those of integrin αvβ3 antagonists and remain to be further investigated. To our knowledge, it is the first report describing the functional role of endothelial GPIb in spontaneous angiogenesis, and GPIb antagonists can markedly inhibit this process. It remains to be elucidated regarding whether agkistin affects the multisteps in the angiogenic process such as tissue degradation, migration, and differentiation elicited by a specific angiogenic factor (e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor or basic fibroblast growth factor). In conclusion, agkistin specifically inhibited HUVEC adhesion to immobilized vWF through selective binding of endothelial GPIb, resulting in a blockade of interaction between vWF and endothelial GPIb. Agkistin binds to endothelial GPIb in a specific and saturable manner. Furthermore, both agkistin and AP1 significantly inhibited spontaneous angiogenesis in the chick CAM model in vivo but apparently did not affect HUVEC viability. In addition to their anti-thrombotic activity of agkistin and crotalin, another venom platelet GPIb antagonist (31.Chang M.C. Lin H.K. Peng H.C. Huang T.F. Blood. 1998; 91: 1582-1589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these GPIb antagonists may be useful tools for developing a new therapeutic strategy in angiogenesis-related diseases, such as inflammation and tumor metastasis. We appreciate very much the generous supply of monoclonal antibodies from Dr. R. Montgomery (AP1) and Dr. B. Coller (7E3). We also thank S. C. Huang for preparing HUVECs."

These residual rates suggest either the presence of alternative entry points for these inhibitors or breathing motions that open a gap between the fasciculin and AChE interfaces. Fluorescent ligands can be used to probe structural characteristics of proteins in solution. The prototypic AChE peripheral site ligand propidium, for instance, elucidated the nature of a peripheral binding site for inhibitors, remote from the active site serine residue (16.Taylor P. Lappi S. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1989-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Furthermore, fluorescent phosphonates, which conjugate with the active site serine, were utilized to measure the hydrophobicity of the active site gorge, the contribution of charge to active center accessibility, and the distance between the reactive serine and the peripheral site years before a crystal structure was solved (17.Berman H.A. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1704-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18.Berman H.A. Yguerabide J. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2226-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Potentially, site-directed mutagenesis on recombinant DNA-derived AChE should render a broader range of discrete positions available for selective fluorescence labeling on the enzyme surface. Cysteine substitution mutagenesis, followed by labeling the resulting reactive thiol with methanethiosulfonate (MTS) compounds or fluorescent probes, has been utilized to identify and characterize functionally important residues in several enzyme and receptor systems (19.Kenyon G.L. Bruice T.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 407-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 20.Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A.

A monomeric form of mouse AChE, in which the C-terminal cysteine is removed, leaving the remaining six cysteines linked through three disulfide bonds in a stable structure (1.Cygler M. Schrag J.D. Sussman J.L. Harel M. Silman I. Gentry M.K. Doctor B.P. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 366-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), presents an ideal candidate for cysteine substitution mutagenesis. In this study, we substitute cysteine into three positions on the enzyme: within the active site gorge (Tyr124), at the gorge rim (His287), and on the enzyme surface removed from the gorge entrance (Ala262). The cysteines were then modified with cationic, neutral, and anionic substituents. Substrate and inhibitor binding kinetics were examined to assess the influence of electrostatic and steric parameters on ligand association kinetics. Acrylodan, a fluorescent ligand offering a neutral side chain substitution (22.Prendergast F.G. Meyer M. Carlson G.L. Iida S. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7541-7544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), enabled us to evaluate polarity of the probe environment and solvent accessibility to the probe for unliganded AChE and the fasciculin-AChE complex and relate these physical parameters to the kinetics of ligand access. Acetylthiocholine iodide, 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Ellman's reagent), 1,5-bis(4-allyldimethylammoniumphenyl)pentan-3-one dibromide (BW284c51), and dithiothreitol were products of Sigma. Substituted methanethiosulfonates ((sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSES), benzyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSBn), (2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl)methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET), and 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide (MTSEA)), and acrylodan were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc. (Toronto, Canada) or Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), respectively. Fasciculin 2 (purified from the venom of Dendroaspis angusticeps) was a gift of Dr. Pascale Marchot (Marseille, France).m-(N,N,N-Trimethylammonio)trifluoromethyl acetophenone and m-tert-butyl trifluoromethyl acetophenone (TFK+ and TFK0, respectively) were synthesized as described (23.Nair H.K. Seravalli J. Arbuckle T. Quinn D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8566-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and kindly provided by Dr. Daniel M. Quinn (University of Iowa). 7-[[(Methylethoxy)phosphinyl]-oxyl]-1-methylquinolinium iodide (MEPQ) (24.Levy D. Ashani Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was a gift of Drs. Yacov Ashani and Bhupendra P. Doctor (Walter Reed Army Research Center, Washington, D.C.). All other chemicals were of at least reagent grade. A cDNA encoding mouse AChE truncated at position 548 and yielding a monomeric form of the enzyme has been characterized previously (25.Radić Z. Pickering N.A. Vellom D.C. Camp S. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12074-12084Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Mutant mouse AChE cDNAs encoding the monomeric form of the enzyme were generated either by Kunkel (26.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar) or polymerase chain reaction-mediated (Stratagene Quik Change Kit) standard mutagenesis procedures. The presence of the mutation was detected by restriction enzyme digestion, and cassettes containing the mutation were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector, pCDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The nucleotide sequences of the cassettes were confirmed by double stranded sequencing to ensure that spurious mutations were not inadvertently introduced into the coding sequence. The plasmids were purified by standard protocols involving alkali cell lysis, phenol/chloroform extraction, poly(ethylene glycol) precipitation, and CsCl gradients. Human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Atlanta, GA) and, 24 h before transfection, plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells per 10-cm dish. Ten μg of plasmid DNA per plate were added to the cells using standard HEPES/calcium phosphate precipitation methods. Approximately 16 h after transfection, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline. For transient expression of mutant enzymes, cells were supplied with serum-free media for 48 to 72 h. The media containing the secreted monomeric enzyme was periodically collected and the cells were resupplied with fresh serum-free media. This process continued until at most three harvests of enzyme were obtained. In some cases, enzymes were concentrated for kinetic experiments by use of Centriprep or Centricon 30 concentrators (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). For large scale productions of enzyme, stable transfectants were selected by G418 resistance following co-transfection with a neomycin resistance gene. After transfection and rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were allowed to recover in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 3–5 days after which G418 (Gemini Bio-Products, Inc., Calabasas, CA) was added to the media for 2 to 3 weeks. Stable transfectants were pooled and grown to confluency prior to replacement of the fetal bovine serum supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with serum-free media. Harvests of the media containing the AChE continued for several weeks or until the expression levels began to decline. Fluorescence studies required purified AChE, both mutant and wild type. Inhibitors (trimethyl-(m-aminophenyl)-ammonium chloride hydrochloride or procainamide hydrochloride), linked through an extended chain to Sepharose CL-4B resin (Sigma), were used to affinity purify the cysteine-substituted enzymes, typically in amounts between 10 and 25 mg, as described previously (27.Berman J.D. Young M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 28.De La Hoz D. Doctor B.P. Ralston J.S. Rush R.S. Wolfe A.D.

Levels of purity were determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and by comparisons of specific activity using absorbance at 280 nm or BCA assay for estimating protein content. Enzyme activity was measured spectrophotometrically by the method of Ellman (30.Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres Jr., V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21913) Google Scholar). Kinetic constants for acetylthiocholine hydrolysis were determined by fitting the observed rates as described previously (25.Radić Z. Pickering N.A. Vellom D.C. Camp S. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12074-12084Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Known concentrations of MEPQ were utilized to titrate the number of active sites according to Levy and Ashani (24.Levy D. Ashani Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). 10–250 mm solutions of MTS compounds were added to enzymes to result in 1–10 mmconcentrations of labeling agent. The reaction was allowed to proceed at least 30 min, after which labeled enzymes were separated from MTS compounds by means of G-50 Sephadex spin columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Enzymes were assayed for kinetic changes immediately thereafter. One to 2 mg of acrylodan were dissolved in dimethylformamide to a stock concentration of 3–12 mm, as measured by absorbance at 387 nm (ε = 16,400m−1 cm−1 in ethanol; Ref. 22.Prendergast F.G. Meyer M. Carlson G.L. Iida S. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7541-7544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The A262C and H287C mutant enzymes were pretreated with 0.5–1 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at room temperature to ensure that the free cysteine had not partially oxidized. Free dithiothreitol was removed by use of a G-50 Sephadex spin column (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A volume of 0.5 to 1 μl of acrylodan at 100 times the enzyme concentration was slowly added to the enzyme to achieve a 5–10-fold molar excess. Labeling was allowed to proceed at least 12 h at 4 °C. Unreacted acrylodan was removed by size exclusion chromatography using G-25 Sephadex (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7. Labeled enzyme concentrations were determined from the maximal acrylodan absorbance found between 360 and 380 nm (ε ≅ 16,400 m−1 cm−1). Stoichiometry of labeling, estimated from a comparison of enzyme concentration by protein (280 nm) with acrylodan (360–380 nm) absorbance, ranged as follows: Y124C, 0.6–0.9; A262C, 0.75–1.0; H287C, 0.6–0.85. Since acrylodan absorbance for the wild type enzyme was virtually undetectable, specificity of labeling was assessed by comparison of areas of the fluorescence emission curves for acrylodan-treated mutant and wild type enzymes. In the absence of dithiothreitol, labeling of Y124C-acrylodan was ≥95% selective. Treatment of enzymes with 0.5–1 mm dithiothreitol increased wild type acrylodan fluorescence. For A262C-acrylodan, specific labeling was 85% whereas for H287C-acrylodan it was 70%. Picomolar amounts of enzyme in 0.01% bovine serum albumin in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, were reacted with the charged or uncharged substituted trifluoroacetophenone or fasciculin 2 in the absence of substrate. Inhibition was monitored by measuring residual enzyme activity by removal of aliquots during the course of the reaction. Bimolecular rate constants of inhibition were determined by nonlinear fit of the data (31.Radić Z. Kirchoff P.D. Quinn D.M. McCammon J.A. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23265-23277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectra were collected using a Jobin Yvon-Spex Fluoromax fluorometer (Instruments S.A., Inc., Edison, NJ) and analyzed with GRAMS/386 data analysis software (Galactic Industries Corp., Salem, NH). The excitation wavelength for acrylodan was set at 355 nm and emission was detected between 420 and 600 nm. Emission and excitation slits were set at 5 nm. Rate constants (k on) for fasciculin association with acrylodan-labeled mutant AChE was assessed by utilization of anApplied Photophysics SX.18MV (Leatherhead, UK) stopped-flow reaction analyzer and observation of the time-dependent increase in fluorescence above 420 nm upon excitation at 355 nm by means of a 420-nm emission cut-off filter. Data were fit according to a single exponential rise to maximum fluorescence. Since competition experiments between radioactively labeled fasciculin and BW284c51 show that binding of these ligands is mutually exclusive (32.Marchot P. Khélif A. Ji Y.-H. Mansuelle P. Bougis P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12458-12467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), fasciculin dissociation rate constants (k off) were determined by measuring the time dependence of the decrease in fluorescence for the fasciculin-AChE-acrylodan conjugate upon addition excess BW284c51 at several concentrations. Here, data were fit to a single exponential decay to a minimal value. For the Y124C, but not the H287C, fasciculin-AChE-acrylodan conjugate, this observed rate was dependent on the concentration of BW284c51. In this case, linear regression of a reciprocal plot of the observed rate and the concentration of BW284c51 yielded the desired fasciculin dissociation rate constant. Equilibrium dissociation constants (K D) were calculated from the ratios of k off tok on. All of the mutant enzymes show kinetics of acetylthiocholine hydrolysis similar to wild type enzyme, indicating that catalytic activity is preserved and the enzymes containing the newly introduced cysteine residues fold properly (TableI). The Michaelis constant (K m) appears unaffected by the mutations, while the secondary site binding constant (K ss) is only marginally increased for the mutant Y124C, as observed previously for the mutant Y124Q (25.Radić Z. Pickering N.A. Vellom D.C. Camp S. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12074-12084Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The turnover rate, k cat, and the ratio of k cat to K m, as a measure of catalytic efficiency, and the relative activity of the enzyme with two substrate molecules simultaneously bound, as reflected by the b factor, are all within experimental error of the values for wild type enzyme.Table IConstants for acetylthiocholine hydrolysis by wild type and mutant mouse AChEs unconjugated or conjugated with aromatic (benzyl-MTS), negatively charged (MTSES, SO3−), positively charged (MTSET, N(CH3)3+; MTSEA, NH3+) or fluorescent (acrylodan) cysteine labeling compoundsEnzymeK mK ssbk catk cat/K mμmmm10 5 /min10 9 /m · minWild type aData from Ref. 25.

Modifications of the cysteine at position 124 by the MTS compounds (Fig. 1) alter the kinetics of acetylthiocholine hydrolysis (Table I and Fig.2A). Labeling of Y124C with a benzylmethyl thiol elicits a minimal influence on the kinetic constants, whereas conjugation with a negatively charged sulfonate moiety affects K ss, but notK m. The largest variation of K mis observed with positively charged MTS compounds. In comparison to the mutant enzyme, derivatization with a quaternary amine (MTSET) or a primary amine (MTSEA) increases K m 17- and 36-fold, respectively, while having little effect on K ssor b values. Only small changes ink cat are observed for the MTS-modified enzymes. The inability of certain conjugates to induce significant alterations in the kinetics of acetylthiocholine hydrolysis required sequential modification to detect completeness of labeling. Kinetic measurements in which Y124C was first exposed to either benzene or sulfonate MTS reagents then to MTSEA confirmed that reaction with the initial compounds proceeded to near completion (Fig. 2 B). Acrylodan labeling of Y124C affects both K m andk cat, while K ss andb values remain similar to unreacted Y124C.K m is increased approximately 4-fold, whilek cat is reduced 25-fold, resulting in a 100-fold loss in enzyme efficiency as measured by the ratio ofk cat to K m.Figure 2Concentration dependence of acetylthiocholine hydrolysis for Y124C and the cysteine substituted derivatives of Y124C AChE.

The bimolecular association rate of the cationic inhibitor TFK+ with Y124C is slightly slower than that for wild type enzyme. Derivatization of Y124C with either neutral (benzyl) or negatively charged (sulfonate) reagents further decreases this rate, but modestly. In contrast, placement of a positive charge at the Y124C position decreases the association rate constant substantially. The primary amine moiety reducesk on 52-fold while the quaternary ammonium group reduces it over 200-fold. In contrast, the bimolecular rate constants for TFK0 with the same set of Y124C-labeled enzymes are nearly unaltered, and a comparison with TFK+ kinetics enables one to distinguish the role of steric and electrostatic factors in the inhibition mechanism. With TFKo, Y124C again shows a slight (2-fold) decrease in k on, when compared with wild type enzyme. The neutral benzyl side chain does not further decrease this rate constant while the negatively charged side chain decreases it modestly. The positively charged side chain substitutions show a slight reduction in the rate constant, where the maximum diminution of 6-fold for the quaternary ammonium does not approach the reduction observed for cationic substitutions with TFK+. Acrylodan modification, as the bulkiest substituent, causes a 19-fold reduction in the association rate of TFK0and a 64-fold reduction for TFK+. By comparison, the dissociation rate constants, k off, are relatively unaffected by the presence of the primary mutation or subsequent substitution. However, slow dissociation rates preclude precise estimates of these rate constants.Table IIRate constants for reaction of enzymes with TFK + and TFK 0 in the presence and absence of aromatic (benzyl-MTS), negatively charged (MTSES, SO3−), positively charged (MTSET, N(CH3)3+; MTSEA, NH3+) or fluorescent (acrylodan) cysteine labeling compoundsTFK+TFK0Enzymek onk onWTk offk onk onWTk offk onmutantk on mutant10 9 /m · min10 −4 /min10 9 /m · min10 −3 /minWild type160 ± 1315 ± 22.3 ± 0.56116 ± 4Y124C110 ± 41.514 ± 61.3 ± 0.021.819 ± 2Y124C-benzyl63 ± 72.57 ± 31.6 ± 0.041.431 ± 12Y124C-SO3−84 ± 31.98 ± 20.75 ± 0.043.114 ± 5Y124C-NH3+3.1 ± 0.45216 ± 120.70 ± 0.043.312 ± 2Y124C-N(CH3)3+0.72 ± 0.0322014 ± 40.40 ± 0.025.86 ± 3Y124C-a"

Specific initiation of plus strand synthesis from this polypurine tract (PPT) RNA is essential for the subsequent integration of the linear viral DNA product. Based on current models, it is predicted that priming from sites upstream of the PPT may be tolerated by the virus, whereas efficient extension from RNA primers located downstream from the PPT is predicted to generate dead-end products. By using hybrid duplex substrates derived from the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat, we investigated the extent to which RNase H degrades the viral RNA during time course cleavage assays, and we tested the capacity of the polymerase activity of RT to use the resulting cleavage products as primers. We find that the majority of the RNA fragments generated by RNase H are 2–25 nucleotides in length, and only following extensive degradation are most fragments reduced to 10 nucleotides or smaller. Although extensive RNA degradation by RNase H likely eliminates many potential RNA primers, based on thermostability predictions it appears that some RNA fragments remain stably annealed to the DNA template. RNA primers generated by RNase H within the long terminal repeat sequence are found to have the capacity to initiate DNA synthesis by RT; however, the priming efficiency is significantly less than that observed with the PPT primer. We find that Moloney murine leukemia virus nucleocapsid protein reduces RNase H degradation and slightly alters the cleavage specificity of RT; however, nucleocapsid protein does not appear to enhance PPT primer utilization or suppress extension from non-PPT RNA primers.

J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The multifunctional reverse transcriptase carries a polymerase activity that utilizes both RNA and DNA strands as templates as well as an RNase H activity that cleaves RNA in hybrid duplex with DNA (reviewed in Ref.3.Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 133-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). RNase H is required to carry out the following three distinct steps during reverse transcription: generation of the plus strand RNA primer, removal of the plus and minus strand primers from the nascent DNA strands, and degradation of the RNA genome following minus strand DNA synthesis which is thought to make the DNA template accessible for plus strand synthesis (reviewed in Ref. 6.Champoux J.J. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 103-118Google Scholar). The extent to which the RNase H activity of RT degrades RNA has been investigated using a number of model systems. During RNA-templated DNA synthesis some cleavage of the template RNA concomitant with nucleotide incorporation appears to occur, and although the frequency of cleavage seems to vary widely depending on the viral RT studied (7.DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3793-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8.DeStefano J.J. Buiser R.G. Mallaber L.M. Myers T.W. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7423-7431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), some longer RNA fragments probably remain available as substrates for subsequent synthesis-independent cleavage by RNase H (7.DeStefano J.J.

The extent to which synthesis-independent cleavage by RNase H contributes to RNA removal is less well characterized. In vitro studies using uniformly labeled RNA from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)gag region have shown that very extensive degradation by HIV RT results primarily in fragments ranging from ∼6 to 14 nucleotides (nt) in length (11.Mizrahi V. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9088-9094Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Whether this fragment distribution is representative of RNase H cleavage activity on other regions of the viral sequence remains to be determined. In contrast to the relatively nonspecific cleavage that removes genomic RNA from the nascent minus strand DNA, RNase H is also required to make a precise cleavage at the RNase H-resistant polypurine tract (PPT) sequence to generate the primer for plus strand synthesis. Accurate plus strand initiation from the PPT is required to generate an integration-competent final DNA product. The finding that some retroviruses possess a second copy of the PPT (cPPT) near the middle of the genome that efficiently primes synthesis, as well as evidence that plus strands are discontinuous in a number of retroviral systems, indicates that priming from regions upstream of the PPT in addition to PPT priming may not be detrimental to the virus (12.Tobaly Tapiero J.

By contrast, current models predict that plus strands initiated from primer RNAs downstream of the PPT will generate dead-end products (6.Champoux J.J. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 103-118Google Scholar). Since RNA fragments within the LTR are closer to the end of the minus strand template than the PPT, plus strands initiated from LTR primers are predicted to have a temporal advantage over PPT-primed products in completing plus strong stop synthesis and the second strand transfer. Thus, priming from within the LTR is predicted to result in the generation of products with one incorrect end, lacking the requisite integration signal normally present at the terminus of the LTR. These considerations raise the possibility that sequences with the potential to generate extendable primers following RNase H cleavage have been selectively excluded from the LTR region. In this study, we sought to determine whether the RNase H activity of Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV) RT degrades the LTR RNA to a sufficient extent that none of the non-PPT RNA fragments would be predicted to remain annealed. Additionally we investigated the effects of Mo-MLV NC on RT-catalyzed RNase H cleavage. Since we found that some longer RNA fragments persisted following extensive cleavage, we tested the capacity of the polymerase activity of RT to use these RNA fragments as primers. Our results indicate that some non-PPT RNA fragments generated by RNase H from within the LTR region or from elsewhere in the genome have the capacity to prime synthesis by the polymerase, although the efficiency of extension is significantly less than from the PPT primer. Mo-MLV RT and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. SuperScript II (RNase H− RT) was from Life Technologies, Inc. Expression and purification of the RNase H domain of Mo-MLV RT have been described elsewhere (20.Schultz S.J. Champoux J.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8630-8638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All other enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs. Denaturing polyacrylamide gels (8.3 murea) were prepared with Sequagel reagents from National Diagnostics. Synthesis and characterization of native Mo-MLV NC and the NCdd mutant (zinc finger replaced by a Gly-Gly linker) have been described (21.De Rocquigny H. Ficheux D. Gabus C. Allain B.

RNA oligonucleotide “PPT Oligo” (5′-CCAGAAAAAGGGGGG-3′) was obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. Salhind (5′-GAATCAGTCGACAAGCTTGTGCAC-3′) and Salterm (5′-TCACTGGTCGACCGGGTTAACC-3′) were used for amplification during M13INT construction. SP6S1 (5′-AGCTATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAATACGCATG-3′) and SP6S2 (5′-CGTATTCTATAGTGTCACCTAAAT-3′) were used to insert an SP6 promoter into M13INT. Amplification primers T7M13 and TermM13, used to generate M13LTR1, have been described (22.Kelleher C.D. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9976-9986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Construction of plasmids pGEMLTR2 and M13LTR2 has been described previously (22.Kelleher C.D. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9976-9986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); pGEMLTR1 was similarly generated but contains a 738-bp insert from the Mo-MLV LTR (genome position 7758–8332 joined to 69–231 (23.Shinnick T.M. Lerner R.A. Sutcliffe J.G. Nature. 1981; 293: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar)) that, in addition to downstream sequences, includes the PPT and 68 nt of upstream sequence. M13LTR1 was constructed by cloning a polymerase chain reaction-amplified 782-bp region of pGEMLTR1, including the LTR insert, into M13mp7 DNA. M13INT was constructed by inserting an SP6 promoter oligonucleotide linker followed by a polymerase chain reaction-amplified region of the Mo-MLV integrase gene (genome position 5138–5824 (23.Shinnick T.M. Lerner R.A. Sutcliffe J.G. Nature. 1981; 293: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar)) into M13mp7 DNA so that the RNA transcripts are the same polarity as the viral RNA. Single-stranded phage and phagemid DNAs were isolated using established procedures (24.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). Single-stranded DNA inserts LTRi (807 nt), LTRΔPPTi (709 nt), and N-LTRi (738 nt) were excised and recovered from M13LTR1, M13LTR2, and M13INT, respectively, as described (22.Kelleher C.D. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9976-9986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) except that the restriction enzyme digestion was withBamHI. In vitro transcription was carried out using the RiboMAX kit (Promega) following the supplier's protocol. LTR and LTRΔPPT RNAs were produced using T7 RNA polymerase to transcribe BamHI-linearized pGEMLTR1 and pGEMLTR2, respectively. EcoRI-linearized M13INT DNA was transcribed by SP6 RNA polymerase to produce N-LTR RNA. Full-length RNA transcripts of 753 nt for LTR, 655 nt for LTRΔPPT, and 705 nt for N-LTR were purified by electrophoresis in a 4% sequencing gel. Following UV shadowing, the RNA was extracted from gel slices by electroelution into 40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.5, 2 mm EDTA. The RNA was ethanol-precipitated in 0.3 m sodium acetate, resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA (TE), and stored at −80 °C. In some cases the 5′-triphosphate was removed by incubation with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase in 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmZnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2 for 30 min at 30 °C, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The dephosphorylated RNA was 5′ end-labeled in 20-μl reactions containing 0.2 μm RNA, 70 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), 0.3 μm [γ-32P]ATP and 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase. Incubation was for 30 min at 37 °C; the reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 mm EDTA and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min to inactivate the kinase. The nuclease P1 ladder was prepared by digesting 0.17 μg (77 nm) of end-labeled RNA with 0.01 ng of nuclease P1 in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2, for 30 min at 60 °C in a 10-μl reaction. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 9 volumes of Form-EDTA buffer (98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA), and aliquoted samples were stored at −20 °C. Under the conditions used, cleavage by nuclease P1 is enhanced at ribonucleotide A residues allowing the sequence identity of most bands to be clearly established. Separate RNA ladders generated using RNase ONE, RNase A, and RNase T1 were used to clarify the few remaining ambiguities. Long RNA-DNA hybrid duplexes were annealed by incubating the indicated nucleic acids at 67 °C for 45 min in 200 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA. The PPT Oligo was annealed to single-stranded pGEMLTR1 or LTRi DNA under similar conditions except the reaction was heated to 90 °C and then slow-cooled to 25 °C. RNA-DNA hybrids were generated by annealing LTR RNA with complementary single-stranded pGEMLTR1 DNA or N-LTR RNA with complementary single-stranded M13INT DNA as described above. The cleavage reactions (30 μl) contained 1× reaction buffer (50 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 6 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT) plus 18 nm RNA annealed to 36 (pGEMLTR1) or 74 nm(M13INT) complementary DNA. Because the pGEMLTR1 and M13INT vector sizes differed by ∼2-fold, the indicated DNA concentrations were used to equalize the amount of total DNA in the reactions. For assays using end-labeled RNA, cleavage was initiated by the addition of 2.5 (low enzyme) or 28 pmol (high enzyme) of Mo-MLV RT. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C, and aliquots of the reaction were stopped in 3 volumes of Form-EDTA buffer at the indicated times. For parallel control reactions, 0.08 units of Escherichia coli RNase H or an equivalent volume of RT dilution buffer (20% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm DTT) was added in place of RT. For RNA fragment analysis by exchange labeling, reactions were carried out as described above except the RNA was unlabeled during the cleavage reaction, and the reactions were stopped at the indicated time points by removing 8-μl aliquots into 2 μl of Tris/EDTA stop solution (255 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.0, 24 mm EDTA) and heating for 10 min at 65 °C. The RNA fragments were exchange-labeled in 13-μl reactions containing 70 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 400 μm ADP, 0.15 μm [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase. The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and terminated by the addition of 2.3 volumes of Form-EDTA buffer. For cleavage reactions carried out in the presence of NC protein, DNA templates LTRi and N-LTRi were used in place of the full-length phage DNA to avoid sequestration of NC by excess single-stranded DNA. Reactions containing 5 nm RNA annealed to 7.5 nm DNA in 1× reaction buffer plus 10 μm ZnCl2 were preincubated with 30 μm NC protein or NCdd (3:1 NC:nt ratio) for 1 min at 37 °C. Cleavage was initiated by the addition of 0.7 pmol of RT, or for control reactions 0.014 units of E. coli RNase H or an equivalent volume of RT dilution buffer, and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. Reactions were terminated and exchange-labeled (where indicated) as described above. In all cases, samples were heated at 90 °C for 3 min prior to resolving the cleavage products on 20% sequencing gels. Substrates for the dideoxy-terminated extension assays were prepared by annealing unlabeled LTR or LTRΔPPT RNAs to the complementary M13-derived insert DNA templates, LTRi and LTRΔPPTi, respectively. For the oligonucleotide hybrid, PPT Oligo was annealed to LTRi DNA. RNA cleavage was initiated by the addition of 11.3 pmol of RT to 30-μl reactions containing hybrid substrates at 7.5 nm in 1× reaction buffer, and the reactions were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. In control reactions, an equivalent number of units (156 units) of RNase H− RT was added in place of RT. At 5 min, 12-μl aliquots of the cleavage reaction were added directly to prewarmed extension tubes containing either 4 μl of ddTTP mix (1× reaction buffer, 200 μm each dATP, dGTP, and ddTTP and 0.3 μm [α-32P]dCTP) or 4 μl of ddCTP mix (1× reaction buffer, 200 μm each dATP, dGTP, and ddCTP and 0.3 μm [α-32P]dTTP), and incubation continued at 37 °C for 30 min. Following extension, stalled products were chased by the addition of 2 μl of 1.8 mm dCTP (ddTTP reactions) or 2 μl of 1.8 mmdTTP (ddCTP reactions). Incubation was continued at 37 °C for another 20 min, and the reactions were terminated by adding 2 μl of 100 mm EDTA. The samples were divided into two portions, and either an equal volume of H2O (−NaOH) or an equal volume of 0.6 m sodium hydroxide (+NaOH) (to hydrolyze the RNA) was added, and the samples were heated at 60 °C for 30 min under a layer of mineral oil. Both the − and + NaOH samples were diluted in 3 volumes of Form-EDTA buffer and heated for 3 min at 90 °C prior to electrophoresis on a 20% sequencing gel. Dideoxy-termination assays that included NC were carried out as described above, except 10 μm ZnCl2 was included in the 1× reaction buffer, and the hybrid substrates were incubated with 428 pmol of NC or an equivalent volume of NC dilution buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.0, 10 μmZnCl2, 1 mm DTT) for 1 min at 37 °C prior to the initiation of cleavage with RT. Run-off extension assays were carried out in 20-μl reactions. For the long hybrid substrates (LTR, LTRΔPPT, and N-LTR), 10 nmtemplate DNA (M13 derived inserts) and 20 nm RNA were present in the final reaction. For the oligonucleotide hybrid substrate, 10 nm LTRi DNA template and 7.5 nmPPT Oligo were used, and for RNA and template self-priming controls, the nucleic acid concentrations were 10 nm. The cleavage extension reactions contained the nucleic acid substrates in 1× reaction buffer plus 200 μm each dATP, dGTP, dCTP, 50 μm dTTP and 0.25 μm[α-32P]dTTP. Following the addition of 10.3 pmol of RT or for the control, an equal number of RNase H− RT units (200 units), the reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Stalled products were chased by adding cold dTTP to 800 μm (6600:1 unlabeled:labeled nucleotide) and 400 units of RNase H− RT, and the incubation was continued at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA to 12 mm and heated for 10 min at 65 °C to inactivate the enzymes. The samples were divided, and from half of each reaction the RNA was hydrolyzed with NaOH as described for the dideoxy-terminated reactions. The samples were diluted in 3 volumes of Form-EDTA buffer, heated at 90 °C for 3 min, and separated on 6% sequencing gels. To quantify primer utilization, 5 discrete bands that did not co-migrate with RNA self-priming products were selected for each substrate. Using ImageQuant software, rectangles were drawn around the bands, and the volume was calculated with the volume quantitation feature. Because the background varied significantly along each lane, background volumes were determined for each band independently by quantifying the volume of an identical rectangle positioned in a clear area of the lane near the band of interest. Because the 3′ ends of the extension products correspond to the end of the linear template, the approximate 5′ end of each band could be determined from its size, based on a labeled 100-bp ladder and a sequencing reaction run in adjacent lanes. The pixel volumes for the individual bands were normalized based on the predicted number of labeled dT residues in the fragment. Melting temperatures (T m) were calculated using the nearest-neighbor model, incorporating thermodynamic parameters for RNA-DNA hybrid duplexes (Ref. 25.Sugimoto N. Nakano S. Katoh M. Matsumura A. Nakamuta H. Ohmichi T. Yoneyama M. Sasaki M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar and references therein). Thermostability plots were generated by calculating the T m values for all possible RNA oligonucleotides that could be generated during cleavage of substrate sequences, using a fixed oligonucleotide length for each independent plot. An Excel macro program was written to iteratively repeat the calculation after shifting the frame of reference down the sequence by 1 base. The calculated T m values were plotted as a function of the position of the 3′ end of the hypothetical RNA oligonucleotide along the linear sequence. T mpredictions were calculated for hybrid substrates LTR, N-LTR (IN), and ENV corresponding to the Mo-MLV genome positions 7758–8332 joined to 69–231, 5138–5824, and 6285–6985, respectively (23.Shinnick T.M. Lerner R.A. Sutcliffe J.G. Nature. 1981; 293: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Calculations were based on the concentrations of the components of the cleavage reactions (10 nm hybrid, 50 mm monovalent cation and 6 mm Mg2+). Although sequence recognition has been demonstrated to play a role in facilitating the selection of the correct RNA fragment for plus strand initiation by RT (26.Powell M.D. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Pullen K.A. Rattray A.J. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6221-6227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Rattray A.J.

To begin to investigate whether genomic RNA could be effectively removed from the minus strand DNA through RT-catalyzed RNase H cleavage, we determined the predictedT m for RNA fragments derived from viral sequences using thermodynamic parameters based on the nearest-neighbor model for thermostability prediction of RNA/DNA hybrid duplexes (25.Sugimoto N. Nakano S. Katoh M. Matsumura A. Nakamuta H. Ohmichi T. Yoneyama M. Sasaki M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Initially, the relationship between thermostability and the size of the RNA fragments was assessed for potential products within the LTR and surrounding sequences. For each of a series of fixed frame lengths, theT m of the sequence within the frame was calculated and then the frame was repositioned down the sequence by one nucleotide, and the T m calculation was repeated. Iterative application of this procedure yielded theT m values shown in Fig.1 for frames lengths of 7 and 10 nt, plotted as a function of the position of the 3′ end of the frame. Based on this analysis we found that whereas none of the possible 7-mers haveT m values above 37 °C, 12% of the 10-mers haveT m values at or above 37 °C and would thus be predicted to remain stably annealed. Interestingly, we note that the fragment corresponding to the PPT primer has the highestT m among regions either immediately upstream of the PPT site or downstream within U3. To assess whether the thermostabilities for RNA fragments that could be generated in the LTR region are representative of viral sequences elsewhere in the genome and to gain an understanding of the proportion of the fragments at various lengths that may remain annealed to the minus strand DNA, similar thermostability calculations were carried out using two additional, randomly chosen, non-LTR regions of viral sequence. When the three regions were compared, little difference in the proportion of the RNA fragments, from 7 to 18 nt in length, that would remain annealed at 37 °C was observed (TableI). In all cases, it appears that degradation of the genomic RNA by RT to fragments 7 nt and smaller would be required for effective removal of the RNA from the minus strand DNA template.Table IPercentage of RNA fragments predicted to remain annealed at 37 °CLengthaRNA oligonucleotide frame length.LTRbMo-MLV LTR and surrounding sequences as defined in text (750 nt).INcSegment of Mo-MLV IN gene corresponding to N-LTR as defined in text (705 nt).ENVdSegment of Mo-MLV envelope gene (700 nt, positions 6285–6985).nt70008110944210121161126272212414542135668641471818215828889169294951795969818979899Thermostability calculations were based on the nearest neighbor model using fixed frame lengths (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Reversible acetylation of the core histone tails in chromatin has been linked to transcriptional regulation. Here we investigate the mechanism whereby PCAF acetylates its target in chromatin. We demonstrate that recombinant PACF preferentially acetylates the H3 tail in oligonucleosomes, as compared with nucleosome core particles. The rate of acetylation is directly related to the length of the oligonucleosomal substrate. Using a trypsin accessibility assay, we demonstrate that the rate of acetylation is also related to the accessibility of the H3 tail in uncondensed oligonucleosomes. We suggest that PCAF, and perhaps other histone acetyltransferases, acetylate chromatin templates more efficiently than core particle subunits and that this preference arises from an increased accessibility of the H3 tail in either condensed or uncondensed oligonucleosomes. Acetylation of the H3 tails by the native PCAF complex is not affected by the length of the oligonucleosomal substrate. Our results suggest that the accessibility of the H3 tail in chromatin is a major factor affecting their rate of acetylation and that component(s) in the native PCAF complex function to modify the organization of these tails in chromatin thereby enhancing their accessibility to PCAF.

Nature. 1998; 392: 831-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar).Most studies on the specificity and activity of purified histone acetyltransferases (HATs),1or multiprotein complexes containing HAT activity, were performed using either free histone, core particles, or on oligonucleosomal templates assembled in vitro on DNA sequences that position nucleosomes at specific sites. However, in the cell nucleus, the DNA has a high sequence complexity, the nucleosomes contain histone H1, and the chromatin fiber is folded in a highly condensed structure (10.Wolffe A.P. Chromatin Structure and Function. Academic Press, London1995Google Scholar, 11.van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms whereby various HATs acetylate their targets in cellular chromatin are not fully understood. It has been demonstrated that the HAT GCN5 acetylates efficiently an oligonucleosomal template assembled on a repeated array ofXenopus 5 S RNA genes (12.Tse C. Georgieva E.I. Ruiz-Garcia A.B. Sendra R. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32388-32392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that histone H1 specifically represses the ability of the HAT P300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) to acetylate its target site and suggested that perturbation of the organization of this histone is a prerequisite for efficient acetylation of H3 in chromatin (13.Herrera J.E. West K.L. Schiltz R.L. Nakatani Y. Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). During these studies, we noted that PCAF acetylates oligonucleosomes more efficiently than nucleosome core particles.Here we study the molecular mechanisms responsible for the enhanced activity of PCAF on oligonucleosomal substrates. We investigate the ability of the histone acetyltransferase PCAF, either as a recombinant enzyme (rPCAF) (14.Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar) or as part of a purified multiprotein nuclear complex (cPCAF) (15.Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schlitz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), to acetylate oligonucleosome arrays isolated from chicken nuclei. We find that recombinant PCAF, but not PCAF in its native multiprotein complex, acetylates oligonucleosome substrates more efficiently than isolated nucleosome core particles. We demonstrate that this enhanced acetylation activity of rPCAF on oligonucleosomes is the result of an enhanced accessibility of the H3 tail in oligonucleosomes as compared with core particles. Furthermore, we had previously demonstrated that magnesium-induced oligonucleosome condensation significantly enhances the ability of cPCAF to acetylate the H3 histone tail (13.Herrera J.E. West K.L. Schiltz R.L. Nakatani Y. Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These results, and those showing that GCN5 activity was also stimulated by magnesium (12.Tse C. Georgieva E.I. Ruiz-Garcia A.B. Sendra R. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32388-32392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), indicated that these HATs preferentially acetylate a condensed oligonucleosome structure. These findings were unexpected, because it is generally accepted that condensation reduces the accessibility of chromatin targets to regulatory factors and that transcriptional activation is associated with chromatin decondensation (10.Wolffe A.P. Chromatin Structure and Function. Academic Press, London1995Google Scholar, 11.van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar, 16.Kornberg R. Lorch Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that magnesium-induced condensation of an oligonucleosome array does not dramatically alter accessibility of the H3 tail.Our finding that the transcription factor PCAF preferentially targets condensed oligonucleosomes suggests that the activity of this HAT is an early step in transcriptional activation, perhaps a prerequisite for subsequent chromatin decondensation. Our studies provide a molecular mechanism underlying the enhanced ability of PCAF to acetylate chromatin and suggest that chromatin condensation alters the organization of the H3 tails in nucleosomes without dramatically affecting its accessibility to factors that function to modify chromatin structure.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo examine the ability of PCAF to acetylate various substrates, we purified nucleosome core particles and H1-free oligonucleosomes from chicken erythrocyte nuclei and subjected them to acetylation by either the recombinant PCAF (rPCAF) or by the nuclear multiprotein PCAF complex (cPCAF). Agarose gel electrophoresis of the oligonucleosomal DNA indicated that the starting material was on the average of 2 kilobases (kb) in length, i.e. it contained about 10 nucleosomes (Fig.1 a). Limited MNase digestion generated a typical oligonucleosomal pattern (not shown, see Ref. 13.Herrera J.E. West K.L. Schiltz R.L. Nakatani Y. Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), whereas prolonged digestion resulted in protection of the canonical 147-base pair (bp) DNA fragment indicative of the nucleosome core particle (Fig. 1 a). Unless noted otherwise, all studies were done under low salt conditions where the oligonucleosomal arrays are uncondensed.Fig. 1 b shows the degree of PCAF-mediated (rPCAF or cPCAF) H3 acetylation in duplicate samples of core particle and uncondensed oligonucleosomes. We find that rPCAF acetylates histone H3 in oligonucleosomes more efficiently than the H3 in core particles. The specific activity of the H3 isolated from the acetylated oligonucleosomes was 8-fold higher than that isolated from core particles (Fig. 1 c). In contrast, cPCAF exhibited no preference for acetylation of either substrate, exhibiting equivalent activities toward core particles and oligonucleosomes. We note that the enzymatic activity of rPCAF cannot be compared directly to those of cPCAF, because the former is a recombinant enzyme while cPCAF is a multiprotein complex isolated from nuclei. Therefore, the amounts of HAT used in these assays are empirically normalized to give approximately similar activities with nucleosome core. Nevertheless, the results clearly indicate that, for the free enzyme (i.e.rPCAF), the uncondensed oligonucleosomes are a better substrate than the core particles, whereas the PCAF complex acetylates both substrates with equal efficiency.To determine if the acetylase activity of rPCAF correlates with nucleosomal length, and to eliminate the possibility that the results are due to some artifact associated with the oligonucleosomal purification procedures, we examined the acetylation efficiency for both rPCAF and cPCAF as a function of MNase digestion. MNase digestion occurs in the linker region between adjacent core particles and reduces the average size of the oligonucleosomes until most of the preparation is reduced to mononucleosomes (11.van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar, 20.Kornberg R.D. LaPointe J.W. Lorch Y. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Fig.2 a shows the DNA products resulting from digestion of a fragment with an average length of 10 nucleosomes. As depicted in Fig. 2 b, the gradual digestion of the oligonucleosome to monomer length (estimated from the relative amounts of core particles) correlates with a gradual loss in the acetylation efficiency of rPCAF but has no significant effect on the acetylation efficiency of cPCAF. This digestion resulted in the appearance of a monomeric subunit containing approximately 176 bp of DNA (Fig. 2 a). Calculation of the specific activities of H3 acetylation indicated that the oligonucleosome was acetylated approximately 8-fold better than that of the sample digested to mononucleosomes (containing linker DNA). We note that direct comparison of the rate of acetylation of purified core particles and oligonucleosomes yielded the same ratio (Fig. 1). These results indicate that the difference in acetylation efficiency observed for the oligonucleosome and the core particle does not arise simply from the presence of the linker DNA. Rather, the results indicate that the preference must arise from a feature intrinsic to an array of nucleosomes. These results are in complete agreement with those depicted in Fig. 1, indicating that rPCAF exhibits a strong preference for acetylation of the H3 tail in the oligonucleosome, whereas cPCAF acetylates all substrates with equal efficiency.Figure 2MNase digestion of the oligonucleosome to mononucleosomes reduces the efficiency of H3 acetylation by rPCAF.a, an agarose gel of the oligomer sample at different times of MNase I digestion.

Themiddle panel is the Coomassie-stained gel, and thebottom panel shows the image (using the PhosphorImager) of the same gel used for determining the [14C]acetate incorporation.

Note that the gradual digestion of the oligomer to monomer results in a gradual decrease in acetylation by rPCAF and has no significant effect on acetylation by cPCAF.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The results in Fig. 2 show that, as the oligonucleosome is digested to shorter arrays, there is a concomitant decrease in the efficiency of PCAF-mediated acetylation. These results suggested that the enzyme exhibits a size dependence in substrate preference. To examine the relationship between oligonucleosomal length and the acetylation activity of PCAF, we purified oligonucleosomes of different average lengths and examined the ability of both cPCAF and rPCAF to acetylate these substrates. The average length of the oligonucleosomal substrates were estimated from the midpoint of the DNA bands isolated from these oligonucleosomes and analyzed on agarose gels (Fig.3 a). The data revealed a direct correlation between the acetylation activity of rPCAF and the oligonucleosomal length of the substrate (Fig. 3 b). A preparation with an average length of tetranucleosomes was acetylated 4.5 times more efficiently than an equal amount of nucleosome core particles, whereas a preparation with an average length of six nucleosomes was acetylated 6 times more efficiently than a core particle. In contrast, the oligonucleosomal length (Fig. 2 b) did not affect the activity of cPCAF.Figure 3rPCAF preferentially acetylates oligonucleosomes of increasing length, whereas cPCAF acetylates all with equal efficiency. Oligonucleosomes of increasing lengths were purified and subjected to acetylation by either rPCAF or cPCAF.a, the DNA purified from the individual length oligonucleosomes (lanes 1–5) and that of the purified core particles (Cp).

A significant difference between the core particle and an oligonucleosomal chain is the presence of the linker DNA between adjacent core particles. Our finding that the acetylation activity is directly proportional to the oligonucleosomal length argues against the linker DNA as the major factor in determining acetylation levels. Indeed, we found that rPCAF acetylates mononucleosomes, which contain part of the linker DNA, as efficiently as core particles, which lack linker DNA (Fig. 2). We therefore suggest that the main effect is due to the interaction of the histone tail with neighboring nucleosomes (not necessarily contiguous), even in the uncondensed state, a situation consistent with the known role of H3 in the condensation of the chromatin fiber (21.Tse C.

Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19587-19595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conceivably, by interacting with the DNA on neighboring nucleosomes, rather than with the DNA on its own core particle, the nucleosomal organization of the H3 tail is altered and the acetylation sites are sterically more accessible to rPCAF. This explanation is also consistent with the length dependence (Fig. 3). If we assume that the interactions can occur between noncontiguous nucleosomes within the array, then the increased length and greater flexibility of the fiber would facilitate these interactions. Thus, steric factors may be affecting the rPCAF-mediated acetylation of the histone H3 tail.To test this hypothesis, we examined the ability of trypsin to digest the histone tails in core particles and in oligonucleosomes (Fig. 3). It has been previously demonstrated that the H3 tail is especially sensitive to trypsin digestion in chromatin (29.Harborne N. Allan J. FEBS Lett. 1983; 155: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Fig.4, a and b, shows representative digestion patterns as a function of increasing times of trypsin digestion for the core particle (Fig. 4 a) and an oligonucleosome fragment containing 12 nucleosomes (Fig.4 b). Quantitative analyses of the rate of H3 tail digestion, either as a function of trypsin concentration or of the time of digestion, are shown in Fig. 4, c and d. The rate of digestion of the H3 tail increased with oligonucleosomal length, with the H3 tail in the nucleosome core particle being the most resistant, and the 12-mer being the most sensitive to digestion. Fig.4 d also indicates that all of the substrates can be digested to completion if sufficient trypsin is added to the reaction, indicating that there is not a particular conformer of the substrate in the reaction that is undigestable by trypsin. These results suggest that the organization of the histone H3 tails in oligonucleosomes is distinct from that in core particles. Trypsin cleaves adjacent to Lys and Arg residues without any known specific conformational requirements. These results suggest that the H3 tail in oligonucleosomes does not adopt a unique conformation that is specifically and uniquely recognized by rPCAF. We conclude, therefore, that the H3 acetylation site is sterically more accessible to rPCAF in oligonucleosomes than in core particles. Interestingly, the difference in digestion rate was specific for the H3 tail. Although the histone tails for all of the core histone are digestible by trypsin, the H3 tail was the only one to exhibit an enhanced rate of digestion in oligonucleosomes as compared with that in core particles.Figure 4The H3 tail in oligonucleosomes is more sensitive to trypsin digestion than that in core particles. a and b, the Coomassie-stained gels for representative time courses of trypsin digestion of core particles and an oligonucleosome (12-mer). c, the fraction of H3 remaining as a function of time of trypsin digestion for core particle (○), chromatosome length (1-mer to 2-mer, ●), 8-mers (▵), and 12-mers (▴). d, the fraction of H3 remaining as a function of increasing concentration of trypsin (plotted as the log of trypsin in nanograms/mL).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because our results indicate that the H3 tail in oligonucleosomes is more accessible than that in core particles, our enhancement in acetylation could result from the acetylation of additional lysines in the H3 tail. We therefore examined the number of acetylated species in core particles versus oligonucleosomes using triton acid urea (AUT) gels. Core particles or oligonucleosomes were acetylated with rPCAF for 20 or 40 min, and the resultant reaction products were analyzed on AUT gels (Fig. 5). Fig.5 a shows the Coomassie Blue-stained AUT gel from the acetylation reaction. Fig. 5, b and c, shows the densitometric scan of the H3 region of the gel. Acetylation of both core particles and oligonucleosomes results in an increase of the mono-acetylated H3 species. The increase in the relative levels of the mono-acetylated species in oligomers was significantly higher than that in core particles (Fig. 5 a, arrow atH3). Analysis of the [14C]acetate incorporation indicated that all counts were incorporated into the mono-acetylated species (not shown). The results show that acetylation of the oligonucleosomes result in greater accumulation of the mono-acetylated species and are not caused by additional acetylated forms arising from the reaction. Therefore, we conclude that the preferential acetylation of the oligonucleosome over the core particle arises from an enhanced rate of acetylation at a specific site and not from the appearance of additional acetylation sites.Figure 5Enhanced acetylation is not due to increased number of targets sites. a, the Coomassie-stained AUT gel for the time course of acetylation by rPCAF of core particles (Cp) or oligonucleosomes (Om).

Quantitative analysis of the acetylation pattern for H4 in the AUT gels (Fig. 5) indicated that there was an accumulation of mono- and di-acetylated forms of H4 as a function of time of acetylation with rPCAF for both the core particle and the oligonucleosome (Fig. 5 a,arrow at H4). However, in contrast to H3, the rate of appearance of the acetylated H4 species for core particles was very similar to that of the oligonucleosome. These results are in full agreement with our trypsin digestion studies that indicated that the sensitivity of H4 to trypsin in core particles is the same as that in oligonucleosomes (Fig. 4). Taken together, these results indicate that the enhanced accessibility, as measured by acetylation or trypsin digestion, is specific for the H3 tail. Furthermore, we conclude that The H3 tail adopts a distinct conformation in oligonucleosomes as compared with core particles.Magnesium ions are known to condense oligonucleosomes (22.Schwartz P.M.

For instance, agonists of PKA and PKC can modify the metabolic functions of cells by inducing an altered program of LDH-A mRNA regulation. These mechanisms allow the cell to respond rapidly to changes in the physiologic environment of the cell and to cover a potential energy deficit through conversion of pyruvate to lactate. Clues to mechanisms underlying this dual mode of control were provided by the identification of cis-acting promoter elements instrumental in PKA- and PKC-mediated transcriptional regulation (2.Huang D. Jungmann R.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 108: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 6.Short M.L. Huang D. Milkowski D.M. Short S. Kunstman K. Soong C-J. Chung K.C. Jungmann R.A. Biochem.

However, less information is available about the mechanism of protein kinase-mediated LDH-A mRNA stability regulation resulting in higher levels of intracellular LDH-A mRNA (3.Huang D. Hubbard C.J. Jungmann R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 994-1004PubMed Google Scholar). Attention has recently focused on the modulation of mRNA stability in response to a variety of physiological signals. For instance, it is known that activators of PKA and PKC are important effectors of mRNA stability regulation in a number of gene systems (1.Jungmann R.A. Kelley D.C. Miles M.F. Milkowski D.M. J.

Our own studies identified a synergistic interaction between PKA and PKC in regulating the stability of LDH-A mRNA (3.Huang D. Hubbard C.J. Jungmann R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 994-1004PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the molecular basis for the synergistic effect remains unknown, we have recently identified a cAMP-stabilizing region (CSR) within the 3′-UTR of LDH-A mRNA (5.Tian D. Huang D. Short S. Short M.L. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24861-24866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) that in combination with specific CSR-binding proteins (4.Tian D. Huang D. Brown R.C. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28454-28460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) is required to achieve LDH-A mRNA stabilization in response to PKA activation. The binding activity of the proteins to the CSR and the effect on LDH-A mRNA stabilization are regulated through a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanism by PKA and as yet unknown protein phosphatases. Thus, it is now clear that the CSR, in concert with CSR-binding proteins, is absolutely required to achieve increased LDH-A mRNA stability in response to PKA activation. However, the molecular mechanism of mRNA stabilization by PKC is unknown. The present paper describes the identification of acis-regulatory element within the 3′-UTR of LDH-A mRNA that is required for PKC-mediated mRNA stability regulation. The identification was accomplished using a strategy previously developed for the identification of the cAMP-stabilizing region (5.Tian D. Huang D. Short S. Short M.L. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24861-24866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Using deletion, mutation, and replacement analysis, we constructed chimeric β-globin/ldh 3′-UTR minigenes that were stably transfected and expressed in rat C6 glioma cells. Applying ribonuclease protection assays, we studied the effects of PKC activation on the rate of decay of chimeric β-globin/ldh 3′-UTR mRNAs. Using this methodology, we demonstrated the presence of an uridine-rich region within the LDH-A 3′-UTR, named PKC-stabilizing region (PCSR), capable of stabilizing LDH-A mRNA in response PKC activation. It is of particular interest that the sequences of CSR and PCSR overlap and possess a common 13-nucleotide region. Nucleic acid-modifying enzymes, acrylamide, and nucleoside triphosphates were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Radioisotopes were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Other reagents were of molecular biology grade and purchased from Sigma. Cell culture products were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Synthesis and processing of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides and their ligation into respective plasmid vectors were performed as described before (5.Tian D. Huang D. Short S. Short M.L. Jungmann R.A.

Rat C6 glioma cells (American Type Culture Collection CCL 107) were maintained as monolayers in Ham's F-10 nutrient medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml of penicillin, and 50 mg of streptomycin as described by us (5.Tian D.

The LDH-A 3′-UTR was derived from plasmid pLDH-2 (kindly provided by Dr. Richard Breathnach) containing a full-length rat fibroblast LDH-A cDNA insert. The mRNA consists of a 103-nucleotide 5′-untranslated region and a 510-nucleotide 3′-untranslated region (corresponding to nucleotides 1103–1610) (50.Matrisian L.M. Rautmann G. Magun B.E. Breathnach R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 711-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The 3′-UTR contains the classic polyadenylation signal AAUAAA 18 nucleotides before the poly(A) sequence. AHinfI/BamHI fragment containing the entire LDH-A 3′-UTR (with 28-base pair 5′ coding sequence and 100-base pair pLDH-2 vector sequence) was inserted into pGEM3Zf(−) at the BamHI site resulting in plasmid pLDH-5. To eliminate the 28-base pairldh-a coding and 100-base pair pLDH-2 vector sequences contained in pLDH-5, the complete 510-base pair 3′-UTR of LDH-A with 5′BamHI and 3′ HindIII sites was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The fragment was cloned into theBamHI-HindIII sites of pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene) resulting in pLDH-6 from which the various 3′-UTR fragments were prepared. The rabbit β-globin expression vector pRc/FBB (see Fig. 1) was constructed as described previously (5.Tian D. Huang D. Short S. Short M.L. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24861-24866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) by Dr. D. Chagnovich (Northwestern University) in two steps from plasmids pRc/CMS (Invitrogen) and pBBB (kindly provided by Dr. M. E. Greenberg) (15.Shyu A.-B. Greenberg M.E. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 60-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Plasmid pRc/FBB encodes a transcription unit consisting of β-globin coding region flanked by the β-globin 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions fused to the c-fos promoter. To construct the chimeric globin/ldh expression vectors, various LDH-A 3′-UTR fragments were inserted into the BglII site or, alternatively, they replaced the BglII/Hind III fragment (β-globin 3′-UTR) of pRc/FBB. The fragments were constructed as follows. To construct the pRc/FBB expression vector containing the full-length LDH-A 3′-UTR, the 510-base pair 3′-UTR was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from pLDH-6 using 5′- and 3′-oligonucleotide primers with BglII and HindIII restriction sites, respectively. The polymerase chain reaction product as well as pRc/FBB were digested with BglII and HindIII and ligated to generate expression vector pRc/FBB/LDH. In this vector, the β-globin 3′-UTR had been deleted from pRc/FBB and replaced with the LDH-A 3′-UTR. Truncated 3′-UTR fragments were similarly generated using the appropriate oligonucleotide primers. Fragments for insertion into the BglII site of pRc/FBB were blunt-end ligated, and fragments replacing the globin 3′-UTR contained BglII andHindIII ends. LDH-A 3′-UTR sequences with base deletions were generated by splicing upstream and downstream polymerase chain reaction fragments that lacked the appropriate base sequence as indicated in Fig. 3. The sequence and correct orientation of all inserts were confirmed by restriction and DNA sequence analyses. Sequencing was carried out in both directions by the dideoxynucleotide chain terminator method with specific synthetic oligonucleotides as primers. These experimental methods were described in detail in a previous publication (5.Tian D. Huang D. Short S. Short M.L. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24861-24866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out at about 90% confluence. Serum was withdrawn 24–28 h prior to addition of fetal bovine serum (final concentration, 15%) together with various agents at concentrations indicated in the text. One hour after the addition (taken as 0 h time point), RNA was isolated at subsequent time points up to 12 h and analyzed. These methods were previously described in detail (5.Tian D. Huang D. Short S. Short M.L. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24861-24866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Messenger RNA decay was assessed by ribonuclease protection assay. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as internal control, because GAPDH mRNA was stable under the conditions of the experiments regardless of the absence or presence of effector agents. Nuclear run-off experiments were carried out as described by us (1.Jungmann R.A. Kelley D.C. Miles M.F. Milkowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5312-5318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Huang D. Hubbard C.J. Jungmann R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 994-1004PubMed Google Scholar) using a LDH-A 3′-UTR cDNA inserted in Bluescript II KS+ as hybridization probe. Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated that intracellular steady-state levels of LDH-A mRNA are regulated, in part, through modulation of mRNA stability. For instance, after treatment of rat glioma cells with activators of PKA or PKC, a dramatic but transient increase of LDH-A mRNA levels takes place (1.Jungmann R.A. Kelley D.C. Miles M.F. Milkowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5312-5318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Huang D. Hubbard C.J. Jungmann R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 994-1004PubMed Google Scholar). The induced mRNA exhibits a markedly increased half-life as compared with the relatively short half-life of LDH-A mRNA in noninduced cells. This indicates that the LDH-A transcript in noninduced cells is targeted for rapid degradation through processes that can be modulated by effector agents capable of activating the PKA or PKC signal transduction pathways. To investigate the molecular basis of the protein kinase-stabilizing effect, initial studies were carried out to determine whether or not the decay of wild-type LDH-A mRNA and chimeric globin/ldh mRNA followed similar patterns, justifying the use of chimeric vectors for subsequent stability studies. By choosing an expression vector (pRc/FBB) with a serum-induciblec-fos promoter (15.Shyu A.-B. Greenberg M.E. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 60-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 16.Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3124) Google Scholar, 17.Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar), we also avoided artifacts that potentially occur when commonly used transcriptional inhibitors (18.Harrold S. Genovese C. Kobrin B. Morrison S.L. Milcarek C. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar,19.Scott W.A. Tomkins G.M. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 40: 273-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) are used to stop ongoing transcription. We modified pRc/FBB, which is under the control of a serum-inducible c-fos promoter, by replacing the BglII/HindIII fragment (Fig.1), containing the globin 3′-UTR, with the entire LDH-A 3′-UTR. The resulting chimeric minigene (pRc/FBB/LDH) was stably transfected into rat C6 glioma cells. After serum deprivation of cells for 25–30 h, the c-fos promoter was pulse-induced with fetal calf serum resulting in a brief pulse of transcription of chimeric β-globin/ldh mRNA. Nuclear run-off assays indicated a rapid induction of nuclear chimeric globin/ldh transcripts at 15 min (TableI). After 1 h the level of transcription had already decreased to levels seen before serum stimulation. Similar transient kinetics were observed without or with added DG or (S p)-cAMPS. Because nuclear transcription had essentially ceased after 1 h, RNA was subsequently isolated at various time points, and the rate of decay and the half-life of chimeric β-globin/ldh mRNA were determined using quantitative ribonuclease protection assays. As expected from our previous studies (5.Tian D. Huang D. Short S. Short M.L. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24861-24866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), wild-type β-globin mRNA was remarkably stable (Fig. 2 A, wt Globin) and decayed with a half-life of about 21 h (extrapolated from Fig. 2 B). In marked contrast, chimeric β-globin/ldh mRNA in unstimulated cells (Fig.2 A, Control) decayed at a much faster rate (t 12 ≈ 65 min) (Fig. 2 B) similar to the half-life of wild-type LDH-A mRNA rate (t 12≈ 55 min) in glioma cells (1.Jungmann R.A.

Nonspecific hybridization to wild-type pBluescript filters was subtracted from the counts/min hybridized to globin filters. RNA synthesis results are given as the means ± S.E. determined from four separate experiments. To examine the effect of protein kinase activation on the rate of decay of β-globin/ldh mRNA, we used theS p-isomeric form of adenosine 3′, 5′ cyclic monophosphorothioate ((S p)-cAMPS), a potent activator of PKA, and DG, a membrane-permeable diacylglycerol analog that activates PKC (20.Berridge M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 159-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (2455) Google Scholar) and mimicks the effect of endogenous diacylglycerol on PKC (21.Boynton A.L. Whitfield J.F. Kleine L.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 115: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22.Lapetina E.G. Reep B. Ganon B.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1358-1361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, DG as well as (S p)-cAMPS achieved a marked stabilization of chimeric β-globin/ldh mRNA (Fig.2 A, compare Control with DG and(S p )-cAMPS). Activation of PKC increased the half-life of globin/ldh mRNA from about 65 min in untreated to 4.2 h in TPA- and 3.9 h in DG-treated cells (Fig. 2 B). Activation of PKA with (S p)-cAMPS achieved an approximate 7-fold increase of the half-life of β-globin/ldh mRNA from 65 min to 8 h (Fig. 2 B). In view of our previous identification of a synergistic action of PKA and PKC on LDH-A mRNA stability (3.Huang D. Hubbard C.J. Jungmann R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 994-1004PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether such an effect also occurred when the chimeric β-globin/ldh 3′-UTR minigene was the transcribed template. Our data show that synergism was, indeed, demonstrable when a combination of DG + (S p)-cAMPS was used as activators of the protein kinase pathways (Fig. 2 A, DG + (S p )-cAMPS). The half-life of β-globin/ldh mRNA increased 18-fold to a half-life of about 21 h (extrapolated from Fig. 2 B). We conclude from the data that the stability of β-globin/ldh mRNA in glioma cells is similar or identical to wild-type LDH-A mRNA. Furthermore, the decay patterns of chimeric β-globin/ldhmRNA in protein kinase-activated cells appear to follow mechanisms identical to wild-type LDH-A mRNA. To further test the pivotal role of protein kinase activation in regulation of β-globin/ldh mRNA stability, we used inhibitors that prevent activation of the respective protein kinase pathway. Exposure of transfected cells to various activators and inhibitors of PKA and PKC markedly modified the half-life of β-globin/ldh mRNA. As shown in TableII, the phorbol ester TPA, which binds to and activates PKC irreversibly (23.Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5764) Google Scholar), caused an approximate 4-fold increase of β-globin/ldh mRNA half-life. Because TPA may possibly achieve this effect through mechanisms other than activation of PKC (24.Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4038) Google Scholar), we chose DG as activator. DG is a synthetic cell membrane-permeable analog of diacylglycerol, the endogenous activator of PKC, and mimicks the effect of endogenous diacylglycerol (21.Boynton A.L. Whitfield J.F. Kleine L.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 115: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22.Lapetina E.G. Reep B. Ganon B.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1358-1361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, DG treatment of transfected glioma cells increased the half-life of β-globin/ldh mRNA about 4-fold. The α-isomeric form of phorbol 12β,13α-didecanoate, which is unable to activate PKC (25.Kreibich G. Hecker E. Z. Krebsforsch. 1970; 74: 448-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 26.Akiguchi I. Izumi M. Nagataki S. J. Endocrinol. 1993; 138: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), lacked the stabilizing effect of TPA on globin/ldh mRNA, strongly suggesting that TPA exerts its effect through activation of PKC. Furthermore, to prevent activation of PKC, we used the specific PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide GF 109203X (BIM) (27.Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The use of BIM alone did not change the half-life of globin/ldh mRNA. In combination with DG or TPA, BIM prevented stabilization of the mRNA. We have already previously shown that the use of (R p)-cAMPS, which prevents activation of PKA, similarly failed to cause stabilization of chimeric globin/ldh mRNA (3.Huang D. Hubbard C.J. Jungmann R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 994-1004PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Tian D. Huang D. Short S. Short M.L. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol.

LDH-A mRNA is characterized by a moderately short half-life of approximately 55 min (1.Jungmann R.A. Kelley D.C. Miles M.F. Milkowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5312-5318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of its 3′-UTR identifies a 99-nucleotide domain (nt 1450–1549) that is relatively AU-rich when compared with the overall nucleotide composition of the 3′-UTR. Recently, we have shown that the 3′-UTR imparts a relatively short half-life to LDH-A mRNA because of the presence of three determinants of instability (5.Tian D. Huang D. Short S. Short M.L. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24861-24866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although two of the instability regions are not regulated, one of them, the 22-base 3′-UTR region comprised of nt 1478–1499, is subject to regulation by the PKA signal pathway. Its presence is an absolute requirement for cAMP-mediated stabilization of LDH-A mRNA. Using an experimentally similar approach, we now identified putative region(s) within the LDH-A 3′-UTR that are responsible for PKC-mediated stabilization of LDH-A mRNA. Our strategy consisted of the synthesis of two types of chimeric globin/ldh 3′-UTR vectors. First, we constructed a series of globin/ldh 3′-UTR vectors that contained (a) systematically truncated wild-type 3′-UTR fragments; (b) mutated 3′-UTR fragments; and (c) 3′-UTRs from which we had deleted short base regions. The deleted regions were of approximately similar size to prevent artifactual effects because of drastic variations in mRNA size. The fragments were inserted into the unique BglII site of pRc/FBB located at the junction of the β-globin translated and 3′-untranslated regions (Fig. 1) (28.van Ooyen A. van den Berg J. Mantei N. Weissmann C. Science. 1979; 206: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In the second approach, the entire globin 3′-UTR was deleted by restriction at the BglII/HindIII sites (Fig. 1) and replaced with wild-type and various mutated LDH-A 3′-UTR fragments. Upon stable transfection and transcription of the appropriate vectors, unique chimeric globin/ldh mRNAs were produced whose stability was assayed by ribonuclease protection assay. Because in each vector the promoter (c-fos) and globin translation reg"

This observation was exploited in the development of the BTA stat™ and BTA TRAK™ diagnostic assays, both of which make use of two factor H-specific monoclonal antibodies in sandwich format. Here we show that both antibodies exert interesting effects on the biochemistry of complement activation in in vitro systems. Antibody X13.2 competes with C3b for association with factor H and strongly inhibits factor H/factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b, thereby evidently inactivating a negative regulator of complement; yet, the antibody strongly inhibits complement-mediated lysis as well. Conversely, antibody X52.1, which does not compete with C3b and has no effect on solution-phase cleavage of C3b, is capable of enhancing complement-mediated lysis of various cell types, including cancer cells, by over 10-fold. Our observations indicate that it is possible to deconvolute the biochemical roles of factor H in complement by means of appropriate inhibitors, a finding with potentially valuable implications for both basic research and cancer therapy.

We recently reported that a number of human cancer cell lines produce and secrete either FH or closely related FH variants with FH biochemical activity (1.Kinders R.J. Jones T. Root R. Bruce C. Murchison H. Corey M.J. Williams L. Enfield D. Hass G.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 2511-2520PubMed Google Scholar). In situ hybridization experiments have shown that bladder tumors also produce FH message, while normal bladder epithelium produces little or no message (12.Corey M.J. Kinders R.J. Brown L. Rowley H. Vessella R. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1998; 39: 263Google Scholar). However, the significance of this phenomenon with regard to both biochemistry and cancer biology remains to be established. It is not known, for example, whether complement is able to act against bladder cancer (transitional cell carcinoma or TCC), or whether secretion of FH enables the tumor to ward off the attack of complement. Still, the observation of FH expression in a high percentage of patients with even low grade TCC may indicate that FH plays an important role in tumor survival. FH-mediated regulation is thought to be important in controlling inappropriate activation of the alternative pathway of complement (APC; Refs. 13.Meri S. Pangburn M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3982-3986Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar and 14.Meri S. Pangburn M.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, the classical pathway of complement activation is generally antibody-dependent, while the alternative pathway is activated by the presence of negatively charged macromolecules with repetitive structures, such as mannans or bacterial cell walls. The central activating protein in both complement pathways is C3. A normal constituent of blood, C3 can be spontaneously activated by hydrolysis of an internal thioester bond, or can be selectively activated by the complement cascade (7.Austyn J.M. Wood K.J. Principles of Cellular and Molecular Immunology. Oxford University Press, New York1993Google Scholar, 9.Fishelson Z. Mol. Immunol. 1991; 28: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 11.Ollert M.W. David K. Bredehorst R. Vogel C.-W. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4955-4972PubMed Google Scholar). The activated form is designated C3b (or C3(H2O) for the spontaneously activated form). Activated C3 species direct other complement proteins to an appropriate target by associating either with specific receptors or with certain structures that constitute recognition motifs, such as the carbohydrates elaborated from the surfaces of yeast and bacteria (15.Fishelson Z. Mol. Immunol. 1991; 28: 545-552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activated C3 bound to a target cell or macromolecular structure provides both an anchoring point and a biochemical component of the “C3 convertase,” a complex of activated C3 units and Bb fragments (16.Muller-Eberhard H.J. Gotze O. J. Exp. Med. 1972; 135: 1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The C3 convertase has proteolytic activity which is absent or minimally present in the separate proteins; as a complex, the convertase catalytically activates further C3 molecules, leading to a cascade effect and eventually to formation of the membrane attack complex by the downstream complement proteins. In principle, complement can lyse any cell that exhibits a C3b target, including the normal cells of the host, but the process is ordinarily held in check both by solution-phase control of the concentration of activated C3 species and by regulatory proteins that act to suppress the cascade even after immobilization of activated C3. FH plays an important role in each form of regulation; it acts with factor I in cleaving activated C3 species to inactive forms, and it is also capable of causing dissociation of the constituents of the C3 convertase and thereby hindering autocatalytic activation of the APC. There are a number of reports of up-regulation of membrane-bound regulators of complement activation in cancer (17.Seya T. Hara T. Matsumoto M. Hitoshi A. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 238-245PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Yamakawa M. Yamada K. Tsuge T. Ohrui H. Ogata T. Dobashi M. Imai Y.

Cancer. 1997; 71: 1049-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). One model of expression of regulators of complement activation, including FH, in cancer holds that their up-regulation could enhance the ability of cancer cells to escape lysis by the immune system (immune surveillance; Refs. 23.Penn I. Pimentel E. CRC Critical Reviews in Oncogenesis. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 27-52Google Scholar and 24.Penn I. Curr. Prob. Cancer. 1982; 6: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Our interest in the biological basis of FH production and in the potential of FH as a therapeutic target has led us to investigate the effects of anti-FH monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) on complement activation and to probe certain biochemical details of their mechanisms of action. In this report, we describe the effects of an unusual anti-FH mAb on complement-mediated lysis of both erythrocytes and cancer cell lines and analyze its mode of action using purified complement components and other cell-free systems. A serendipitous product of intensive hybridoma procedures, the X52.1 mAb, in addition to serving as a critical component of a diagnostic test for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, has allowed us to enhance complement-mediated lysis by up to 15-fold. However, the mAb evidently does not affect the solution-phase control mechanism by which FH reverses spontaneous activation in the bloodstream; instead our evidence indicates that X52.1 specifically protects the C3 convertase from disruption by FH. Two other mAbs with contrasting modes of action (X13.2, X46.3) are also described. If it proves possible to separate the biochemical processes of complement activation with single reagents, it is reasonable to hope for the development of new therapeutic strategies to treat both cancer and various infectious pathologies that take advantage of inappropriate suppression of complement activity. Human complement serum, factor B-depleted human serum, zymosan, sensitized sheep erythrocytes, other miscellaneous chemicals, and ATP assay reagent (50 mm Tricine, 10 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 66 μg/ml luciferase, 590 μm luciferin as reconstituted) were purchased from Sigma. C2-depleted serum was purchased from Advanced Research Technologies (San Diego, CA). Rabbit erythrocytes (RE) for activity assays of the APC were isolated from rabbit blood which was purchased from Colorado Serum Co., Denver, CO. Immobilized trypsin used to activate C3 was purchased from Pierce. Polyacrylamide gels for gel electrophoresis were purchased from Novex (San Diego, CA). mAbs X13.2, X46.3, and X52.1 were generated by immunization of mice with the S-300 fraction of the urine of TCC patients and subsequent hybridoma procedures, which have been fully described (1.Kinders R.J. Jones T. Root R. Bruce C. Murchison H. Corey M.J. Williams L. Enfield D. Hass G.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 2511-2520PubMed Google Scholar). Control mAb MOPC-21 was grown from a hybridoma originally purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. The specificities of X52.1 and X13.2 were further characterized by Western blots of tryptic fragments of FH, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The mAbs were detected with an alkaline phosphatase-linked goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibody (human serum-absorbed, Kierkegaard & Perry, Gaithersburg, MD) and TMB substrate, and scanned with a Bio-Rad GelDoc densitometer. The Profile Analyst II program was used to calculate molecular weights. Similar blots performed with other complement proteins as targets established that X46.3 is specific for the α chain of C3. HL-60, LS174T, Raji, HTB5, HTB9, T-24, and RT4 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained according to the cell line-specific protocols. Puromycin treatment of Raji was as described previously (25.Schreiber R.D. Pangburn M.K. Medicus R.G. Muller-Eberhard H.J. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1980; 15: 384-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), except that we treated the cells with puromycin for only 5 h, because we found that this was sufficient to render the cells highly susceptible to complement-mediated lysis. cDNA was prepared from 2–3 μg of total cellular RNA of various cancer cell lines according to the kit manufacturer's protocol (Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, CA). The reverse transcription (RT) reaction was carried out at 42 °C for 90 min. PCR amplification of DAF message (40 cycles, 94°/15 s, 62°/30 s, 72°/90 s; 10 μl of the RT reaction into a 100-μl PCR) was performed with the primer pair ATGATGAAGGAGAGTGGAGTGG and CTCCTTGCTCTGTTGACATTCC; each primer was used at a final concentration of 0.3 μm in the reaction mixture. Identity of the amplicon was confirmed by automated sequencing. RT-PCR detection of FH expression was described previously (1.Kinders R.J. Jones T. Root R. Bruce C. Murchison H. Corey M.J. Williams L. Enfield D. Hass G.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 2511-2520PubMed Google Scholar). These assays were performed as in Ref. 1.Kinders R.J. Jones T. Root R. Bruce C. Murchison H. Corey M.J. Williams L. Enfield D. Hass G.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 2511-2520PubMed Google Scholar, except that mAbs were added as indicated to a final concentration of 2.6 or 5.2 μm. In the control experiment designed to detect protease contamination of the X52.1 preparation that might mimic the action of the C3 convertase, either factor I or factor H was omitted from the reaction, and 1–50 μg of mAb X52.1 was substituted. Rabbit blood was used less than 3 weeks after it was drawn. RE were gently resuspended, diluted into 24 volumes of gelatin veronal buffer (GVB: 0.15 mm CaCl2 141 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% gelatin, 1.8 mmsodium barbital, 3.1 mm barbituric acid, pH 7.3–7.4), and centrifuged for 5 min at 600 × g. The supernatant was discarded, and the erythrocyte pellet was again diluted into the same volume of GVB and centrifuged for 10 min at 600 × g. The pellet was diluted into the same volume of GVB for use. RE were counted and used at 2–3 × 108/ml (prior to addition to the complement reaction). Hemoblogin-release assays were performed with RE (APC) or sensitized sheep erythrocytes (classical pathway). A typical APC assay contained 1/20 volume of complement serum, 6 mm EGTA, 4 mm MgCl2, and mAbs diluted in GVB to final volume before addition of erythrocytes, which were added in 0.5 volume. The EGTA and MgCl2 were mixed to a 3:2 ratio and titrated separately to pH 7.4 before dilution to a 20-fold working solution in order to avoid proton-release effects in the complement reaction. Reactions were preincubated for 90–100 min prior to addition of erythrocytes. Pilot studies indicated that this preincubation enhanced the effect of X52.1 on the complement reaction, probably by allowing formation of a pool of activated C3; additional preincubation had little effect. The degree of enhancement was dependent on the age of the complement preparation. In our view this represents a reasonable model of the biochemical environment of a solid tumor, such as a transitional cell carcinoma, where any complement proteins present must have slowly diffused from a spatially removed blood vessel. RE or sensitized sheep erythrocytes, previously equilibrated in GVB at 2–3 × 108/ml, were added in 0.5 volume, and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C with mild shaking. Absorbance was measured by removing aliquots in staggered fashion to tubes on ice (to assure equal incubation times), centrifugation at 1000 × g for 3 min, and removal of cell-free supernatants to a microtiter plate, which was read at 405 or 410 nm. Nucleated cells were lysed by addition of 10–50% complement serum (preincubated with or without mAb as above) to cell culture media, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 50 min to 4 h. In initial experiments on the HL-60 and LS174T cell lines, cytotoxicity was measured by exclusion of trypan blue from live cells; live and dead cells were counted immediately after aliquots were taken for analysis and the ratio was determined. Subsequently the rapid glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase/phosphoglycerokinase/luciferase luminescent cytotoxicity assay, with a limit of detection of approximately 0.03 human nucleated cell lysis, was developed (26.Corey M.J. Kinders R.J. Brown L.G. Vessella R.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 207: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and used to measure lysis of Raji, LS174T, and three bladder-cancer cell lines (HTB-5, T-24, RT4). mAbs were conjugated with alkaline phosphatase, yielding an average of two AP molecules per mAb molecule (1.Kinders R.J. Jones T. Root R. Bruce C. Murchison H. Corey M.J. Williams L. Enfield D. Hass G.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 2511-2520PubMed Google Scholar), and the conjugates were detected by measuring hydrolysis ofp-nitrophenyl phosphate at 405 nm after performance of EIA by techniques previously described (1.Kinders R.J. Jones T. Root R. Bruce C. Murchison H. Corey M.J. Williams L. Enfield D. Hass G.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 2511-2520PubMed Google Scholar). In the “homologous” EIA format, intended to detect multiple sites of association for each mAb, the same mAb was used for both coating and detection (the latter with the mAb-alkaline phosphatase conjugate). Apparent dissociation constants of mAb-FH complexes were measured by direct titration in sandwich EIA (sEIA) format and the data were reduced by Equation 1 or 2, as described previously (27.Corey E. Wegner S.K. Stray J.E. Corey M.J. Arfman E.W. Lange P.H. Vessella R.L. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 1019-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because of the possibility that directly immobilized FH would be structurally distorted and would not yield accurate results, measurement ofK d(app) for X52.1 was determined by immobilizing X13.2 for capture of FH, and vice versa. To measure the K d(app) of X52.1, the X52.1-alkaline phosphatase conjugate was added in 2-fold serial dilutions over the concentration range 0–2.5 nm to a microtiter plate coated with 1 μg/ml X13.2, which had been preincubated for 4 h with 2 μg/ml FH. TheK d(app) of X13.2 was measured by adding the X13.2-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (0–2.5 nm) to immobilized X52.1 (0.11 μg/ml) and FH as above. The lowest concentrations of coating antibodies that yielded a reliable signal were used to minimize ligand depletion. Nevertheless, such measurements cannot be assumed to yield accurate dissociation constants for the solution-phase complexes, for several reasons: 1) the alkaline phosphatase conjugate may not bind as well as the free molecule; 2) the dissociation constants of the two antibodies are convoluted in the result, since dissociation of either the X13.2-FH or X52.1-FH complex leads to loss of signal in each case; 3) the antigen immobilized in a microtiter well and “displayed” by a coating antibody may be sterically hindered from forming the strongest possible association with the detection antibody. However, the actual K dis likely to be stronger than theK d(app) measured by these methods, since all of these effects tend to weaken the association. It is therefore fairly safe to assume that the measuredK d(app) is an upper bound on theK d of the weaker of the two associations. [FH] in the equations is the effective concentration of immobilized FH (which can be fit as a disposable parameter under ligand-depletion conditions), A 0 is the observed absorbance value (or rate of change of absorbance-see below) with no added conjugate, and A max is the fit asymptote of the absorbance data. Two equations were used for reduction of the association data. Equation1 is the Michaelis-Menten equation with an adjustment for the zero-ligand value. Equation 2 is similar, but contains a quadratic correction to account for the difference between the known, total quantity of added ligand (mAb conjugate) and the actual concentration of free ligand. There is a significant difference between the two only if the quantity of active, captured target (FH) is not negligible with regard to the size of the free-ligand pool and theK d (see Ref. 27.Corey E. Wegner S.K. Stray J.E. Corey M.J. Arfman E.W. Lange P.H. Vessella R.L. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 1019-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar for more detail). In the data sets used for measurement of K d(app), non-linear regression to Equation 2 yielded a fit target concentration that was indistinguishable from zero in all cases, indicating that ligand depletion was negligible.AobsAmax=[Ab]/([Ab]+Kd)+A0Equation 1 AobsAmax=[Ab]+[FH]+Kd−(([Ab]+[FH]+Kd) 2−4[Ab][FH]) 0.5)2[FH]+A0Equation 2 We therefore used Equation 1 to calculate the reportedK d(app). TheK d(app) of X13.2 was determined either with single ELISA readings at 405 nm, or by taking readings at six time points and using the slope of the linear fit as the signal. The latter is slightly superior in terms of accuracy, but involves much more data reduction (27.Corey E. Wegner S.K. Stray J.E. Corey M.J. Arfman E.W. Lange P.H. Vessella R.L. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 1019-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The K d of X52.1 was determined by combining three runs, using the latter method. mAb X52.1 was immobilized at 0.35 μg/ml for capture of FH with or without C3b and subsequent titration with AP-conjugated X13.2. In contrast to these experiments, the experiments using varying FH concentrations that led to Fig. 5 were performed with larger concentrations (5 μg/ml) of coating mAb, and much better fits were obtained with the ligand-depletion equation (Equation 2), indicating that the amount of active, immobilized target was not negligible with respect to the concentration of ligand (FH) under these conditions. In separate experiments designed to detect multiple sites of association with FH, each mAb was coated on the plate at 2 μg/ml (100 μl/well), then probed with its own alkaline phosphatase conjugate (0–100 nm) in the presence of saturating FH (“homologous” format). For X52.1, this experiment was also performed with and without competing unlabeled X13.2 (0–3 μm) to examine the possibility that the secondary site of X52.1 might overlap one of the X13.2 sites.K d(app) in these experiments was calculated with Equation 1. Zymosan (a component of yeast cell walls that strongly activates the APC) was incubated with complement and 6 mm EGTA, 4 mm MgCl2(separately titrated to pH 7.4) with or without added mAb for various lengths of time. The zymosan was then pelleted, washed twice with GVB, and resuspended in Laemmli buffer for SDS-PAGE; these gels were silver-stained, and the C3 β chain was identified by comparison with literature data (7.Austyn J.M. Wood K.J. Principles of Cellular and Molecular Immunology. Oxford University Press, New York1993Google Scholar). The supernatant was analyzed by Western blots, using an mAb (X46.3) specific for the C3 α chain (1.Kinders R.J. Jones T. Root R. Bruce C. Murchison H. Corey M.J. Williams L. Enfield D. Hass G.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 2511-2520PubMed Google Scholar). While the effect of X52.1 on T-24 lysis was robust from day to day, position effects were observed on the ELISA plates used for growth of the cells. We therefore used proximate pairs of wells to measure lysis ± X52.1, and the data were analyzed by two-tailed, paired t test. Linear regression was performed with CricketGraph 1.3. Non-linear regression to Equations 1and 2 was performed with JMP 3.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). EIAs performed in the process of screening the antibody panels showed that mAb X46.3 was specific for the C3 α chain and exhibited no detectable cross-reactivity with FH. The specificity of X52.1 and X13.2 was previously determined (1.Kinders R.J. Jones T. Root R. Bruce C. Murchison H. Corey M.J. Williams L. Enfield D. Hass G.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 2511-2520PubMed Google Scholar); these mAbs do not cross-react with C3, C3-derived fragments or other complement proteins. They appear to be specific for human FH. According to data from Western blots, mAb X52.1 associated with the 120-kDa and 48-kDa fragments of trypsinized FH, consistent with assignment of its primary site of association to SCR domains 15–20 of FH. mAb X13.2 associated with the same fragments, and also with the 38-kDa fragment reported to contain SCRs 1–5, as well as the factor I cofactor activity of FH (28.Alsenz J. Lambris J.D. Schulz T.F. Dierich M.P. Biochem. J. 1984; 224: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). No secondary site of association for X52.1 was seen in Western blot experiments.

In our initial complement tests with nucleated cells, we studied the effects of X52.1 on lysis of the promyelocytic leukemia line HL-60, using a dye-exclusion assay to measure cell death. The presence of X52.1 (22 nm) enhanced complement-mediated lysis of this cell line by 73%. Subsequently we developed an ultra-sensitive luminescent assay for cell death and membrane damage, which we used to observe an 11-fold enhancement of complement-mediated killing of puromycin-treated Raji cells by X52.1versus the complement-only background (26.Corey M.J. Kinders R.J. Brown L.G. Vessella R.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 207: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Untreated Raji cells were much less sensitive to complement-mediated lysis than puromycin-treated Raji, but X52.1 still enhanced the rate of lysis by approximately 12-fold (Table I). We also wished to extend the results to TCC cell lines. HTB-5, which expresses no detectable FH (1.Kinders R.J. Jones T. Root R. Bruce C. Murchison H. Corey M.J. Williams L. Enfield D. Hass G.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 2511-2520PubMed Google Scholar) and low levels of DAF (Table I), was very readily killed by complement, but no effect of X52.1 was seen, probably because the cells' poor defense against complement leads to such a rapid rate of lysis that any enhancement is not quantifiable. RT-4, which expresses very high levels of FH, exhibited a variable response to complement, and again, it was not possible to identify a separate effect of X52.1 on lysis. However, T-24, which expresses intermediate levels of FH, was lysed by complement, and the effect was enhanced by X52.1. Table I presents a summary of the lysis data and effects of X52.1 by cell type. Fig. 1shows the effects of various monoclonal antibodies on the cleavage reaction in a purified system. In this system, factor I and FH form a complex that cleaves the C3b α-chain to the iC3b fragments of 68 kDa and 43 kDa (lane 2 versus lane 1). X13.2 (anti-FH), X46.3 and X87.2 (anti-C3 antibodies) strongly inhibit this process at 5.2 μm, as shown by the strong “C3b, α” bands and the low levels of the two iC3b bands in lanes 10,4, and 8, respectively. 2.6 and 5.2 μm mAb X52.1 did not inhibit FH/factor I-mediated cleavage (lanes 5 and 6).

The degradation of Topo I in vitro was inhibited by aprotinin or soybean trypsin inhibitor, suggesting that the enzyme responsible is a trypsin-like serine protease. Furthermore, Topo I degradation by this protease was Mg2+-dependent. The Topo I-specific protease activity induced during T lymphocytes proliferation was not detected in Jurkat (human T cell leukemia) cells and various other tested human cancer cell lines, possibly explaining why the abundance of Topo I is increased in tumor cells.

DNA topoisomerase I phytohemagglutinin glutathioneS-transferase dithiothreitol phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride adenosine-5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate The superhelical state of DNA is an important determinant of DNA structure and function. The enzyme DNA topoisomerase I (Topo I)1 regulates DNA topology and is evolutionarily conserved in both mode of action and amino acid sequence from yeast to mammals. Topo I relaxes DNA supercoils by cleaving a single strand of duplex DNA and passing the complementary DNA strand through the cleaved strand before religation (1.Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2052) Google Scholar). Biochemical and genetic studies have shown that Topo I plays important roles in DNA replication (2.Yang L. Wold M.S. Li J.J.

During DNA replication, Topo I removes the positive supercoils that accumulate in the unreplicated portion of topologically restrained DNA as a result of the unwinding of the double helix. Topo I also acts as a swivel to release the torsional strain in DNA during RNA transcription. The enzyme contributes to illegitimate recombination between a cleavage complex and an exogenous DNA strand bearing a 5′-hydroxyl end. Moreover, Topo I regulates the initiation of transcription through direct interaction with transcription factors (15.Kretzschmar M. Meisterernst M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because Topo I participates in multiple biological functions, its expression is likely strictly regulated under various physiological conditions. Indeed, deregulation of Topo I results in fatal defects in cells. Thus, overexpression of yeast Topo I in Saccharomyces cerevisiae resulted in a 6–12-fold increase in the frequency of illegitimate recombination (19.Zhu J. Schiestl R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1805-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Overexpression of human or yeast Topo I in Escherichia coli or of mammalian Topo I in mammalian cells resulted in cell death (20.Fernandez-Beros M.E. Tse-Dinh Y.C. J.

These observations also suggest that it is important for cells to maintain a normal level of Topo I protein. The cellular concentration of a protein is determined by both its rate of synthesis and its rate of degradation. Control of protein stability is becoming a critical point for modulating gene expression, and the degradation of various proteins is known to be regulated. Thus, in eukaryotes, mitotic cyclins, G1 cyclin, and Cdk inhibitors are degraded at specific times during the cell cycle (29.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar); proteolysis of p53 and c-Jun contributes to the control of cell growth and proliferation (29.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar); a plant phytochrome is degraded after exposure to red light (30.Shanklin J. Jabben M. Vierstra R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar); and the rate of degradation of several important biosynthetic enzymes is increased in the presence of their end products (31.Arad G. Freikopf A. Kulka R.G. Cell. 1976; 8: 95-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 32.Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3556-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In prokaryotes, the heat shock sigma factor, HtpR, is transiently stabilized in response to an increase in temperature (33.Strauss D.B. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Nature. 1987; 329: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). However, little is known about regulation of the stability of Topo I protein. We have previously shown that PHA-induced T cell proliferation is accompanied by increases in both the abundance of Topo I mRNA and the synthesis of Topo I protein. However, we also detected a concomitant rapid degradation of Topo I under these same conditions (34.Hwong C.L. Chen C.Y. Shang H.F. Hwang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18982-18986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the mechanism of this rapid degradation of Topo I protein in PHA-stimulated proliferating T cells. We demonstrate that the degradation of Topo I is mediated by a nuclear trypsin-like serine protease and that the initial site of cleavage by this protease is located in the NH2-terminal region of Topo I. Our results also suggest that the abundance of Topo I is increased in tumor cells as a result of lacking the trypsin-like serine protease activity in the nucleus of these cells.

Rabbit antibodies to glutathioneS-transferase (GST) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies to rabbit IgG were from Southern Biotechnology Associates. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and from Sigma. Human blood was obtained from healthy donors and mixed with heparin sulfate (20 units/ml). Lymphocytes were isolated from the heparinized blood by density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and were cultured at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 IU/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and 1 mm glutamine. The peripheral resting T lymphocytes were stimulated into proliferation by incubation in the presence of PHA (100 μg/ml) (Wellcome Diagnostics) at 37 °C. Jurkat cells (human T cell leukemia cell line), A2780 cells (human ovarian cell line), U937 cells (human monoblastic cell line), HL60 cells (human leukemia cell line), K562 cells (human erythroleukemia cell line), and Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. H460 cells (human non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line), A431 cells (human epidermoid cell line), Saos-2 cells (human osteosarcoma cell line), KB cells (human epidermoid carcinoma cell line), HepG2 cells (human hepatoblastoma cell line), and HeLa cells (human cervical carcinoma cell line) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were maintained under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. Human Topo I cDNA was subcloned into the pET-22b plasmid (Novagen), and the resulting construct was subjected to in vitro transcription and translation with TNT wheat germ extract (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The translation products were used directly in the in vitroassay of Topo I degradation (see below). Various regions of human Topo I cDNA, generated either by the polymerase chain reaction or by restriction enzyme digestion, were also subcloned into the plasmid pGEX-KG (P-L Biochemicals) for expression of the encoded Topo I fragments as GST fusion proteins. Some of the resulting constructs (GST, GTOPI-4, GTOPI-6, and GTOPI-7) were subjected to in vitro transcription and translation with an E. coli T7 S30 extract (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. The other GST-Topo I constructs were introduced into E. coliBL21 (DE3), and expression of the fusion proteins was induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The fusion proteins were purified with the use of glutathione-agarose affinity columns. Both the fusion proteins produced by in vitro translation, and those purified with the affinity columns were used for the in vitro assay of Topo I degradation. Cells were fractionated according to a modified version of the method of Dyer and Herzog (35.Dyer R.B. Herzog N.K. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 192-195PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (1∼5 × 107) were collected by centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, washed with phosphate-buffer saline, and lysed by suspension in 100 μl of sucrose buffer I (0.32 m sucrose, 3 mmCaCl2, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40). The lysate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet nuclei, and the resulting supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, mixed with 0.22 volume of 5× cytoplasmic extraction buffer (150 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.9, 0.7 m KCl, 15 mm MgCl2), and centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant (cytosolic extract) was transferred to a fresh tube, into which glycerol was added to a final concentration of 25% (v/v), and the mixture was divided into portions and stored at −70 °C. The nuclear pellet was washed with sucrose buffer I lacking Nonidet P-40, with recentrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was removed, and the nuclei were resuspended in 20 μl of low salt buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT). After the addition of 20 μl of high salt buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.8 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm DTT) to lyse the nuclei, the mixture was incubated on a rotary platform at 4 °C for 20 min, diluted 1:2.5 with diluent (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.6, 25% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT), and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant (nuclear extract) was divided into portions and stored at −70 °C. 5 μl of the [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated proteins or 250 ng of the purified GST-Topo I fusion proteins were incubated for various times at 37 °C in a final volume of 30 μl with nuclear or cytosolic extracts (10 μg of protein) isolated from proliferating (resting T lymphocytes stimulated with PHA for 72 h at 37 °C) or resting T lymphocytes in the incubation buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 8.0). After the addition of Laemmli sample buffer, the mixture was boiled for 5 min and then fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10 or 12.5% gel. The gel was subjected to fluorography with 2,5-diphenyloxazol to detect thein vitro translated 35S-labeled proteins. The degradation of the purified GST fusion proteins was detected by immunoblot analysis. At various times after stimulation with PHA, lymphocytes were harvested and lysed in an ice-cold solution containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 8.3 μm aprotinin, 50 μm leupeptin, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 100 mm Na3VO3, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The mixture was incubated on a rotary platform at 4 °C for 20 min and centrifuged at 26,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. A portion (100 μg of protein) of each cell lysate was mixed with Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 7.5% gel. The separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), which was then incubated for 2 h at room temperature in TBS buffer (125 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing 1.5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk. The membrane was then incubated for 90 min with rabbit antiserum to human DNA Topo I (1:5000 dilution) (34.Hwong C.L. Chen C.Y. Shang H.F. Hwang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18982-18986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in TBST buffer (125 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), washed three times with TBST buffer, and incubated for an additional 30 min with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat antibodies to rabbit IgG. After another three washes in TBS buffer, the membrane was incubated for ∼5 min with a solution containing nitroblue tetrazolium (0.33 mg/ml) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (0.165 mg/ml) to allow visualization of immune complexes. The in vitro cleavage of GST-Topo I fusion proteins (GTOPI-1, -2, -3, -5, -8, and -9) was detected by immunoblot analysis with rabbit antibodies to GST and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies to rabbit IgG; immune complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Our previous observation that Topo I is degraded rapidly during PHA stimulation of T lymphocyte proliferation (34.Hwong C.L. Chen C.Y. Shang H.F. Hwang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18982-18986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) led us to propose that PHA may induce a protease activity that is responsible for this degradation. To investigate this proposal, we first harvested human T lymphocytes at various times after PHA stimulation and examined the degradation of Topo I by immunoblot analysis. The amount of Topo I gradually increased with time of exposure to PHA, and a partial degradation of Topo I into two smaller immunoreactive fragments was first detected 12 h after PHA stimulation and increased thereafter (Fig.1), indicating that a protease activity was indeed induced in the proliferating T cells. To characterize the proteolytic activity responsible for the degradation of Topo I, we developed an in vitro degradation assay. We produced [35S]methionine-labeled human Topo I by in vitro transcription and translation and incubated the labeled protein with nuclear or cytosolic extracts isolated from either resting or proliferating T cells. The 35S-labeled Topo I (100 kDa) was degraded in a time-dependent manner in the presence of cytosolic or nuclear extracts from either resting (Fig.2 A) or proliferating (Fig.3 A) T cells. However, only nuclear extract from proliferating T cells generated a pattern of Topo I degradation similar to that observed in intact cells (Figs. 1 and3 A), characterized by two predominant proteolytic intermediates of 97 and 82 kDa that appeared to be produced sequentially. Whereas a mixture of protease inhibitors (aprotinin (5.8 μm), leupeptin (42 μm), pepstatin (1.46 μm), and PMSF (574 μm)) inhibited the degradation of Topo I in vitro by nuclear or cytosolic extracts from resting T cells (Fig. 2 B) or by cytosolic extract of proliferating T cells (Fig. 3 B), these inhibitors had no effect on Topo I degradation by nuclear extract of proliferating T cells (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that this latter proteolysis is specific.Figure 3Degradation of Topo I by cytosolic or nuclear extracts of proliferating T lymphocytes.[35S]Methionine-labeled Topo I was incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C with cytosolic (PCE) or nuclear (PNE) extracts of proliferating T lymphocytes either in the absence (A) or presence (B) of protease inhibitors as described in the legend to Fig. 2. The positions of Topo I and of the predominant 97- and 82-kDa fragments of Topo I are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The 82-kDa processing intermediate was more prominent in the in vitro assay of Topo I degradation by nuclear extract of proliferating T cells (Fig. 3) than in the in vivo assay of Topo I degradation (Fig. 1). To investigate whether this difference might be due to an effect of temperature, given that the in vivo assay was performed at 4 °C and the in vitroassay was performed at 37 °C, we compared the patterns of in vitro degradation of Topo I at 37, 25, 15, and 4 °C. Although Topo I was degraded at all tested temperatures, the rate of proteolysis increased with increasing temperature, and the 82-kDa product was less evident at 4 °C than at 37 °C (Fig.4). The in vitro degradation pattern at 4 °C was thus most similar to the in vivopattern, suggesting that the degradation of Topo I into 97- and 82-kDa fragments is mediated by the same proteolytic activity both in vivo and in vitro. To determine whether this proteolytic activity degrades other proteins, we incubated two nuclear proteins, the Cdk inhibitor p27 and the tumor suppressor p53 (Fig. 5), as well as bacterial GST (see Fig. 11 A) with nuclear extract of proliferating T lymphocytes. None of these three proteins was degraded under conditions similar to those of the Topo I degradation assay. The protease activity thus appears to be relatively specific for Topo I.Figure 11Localization of the initial site of proteolytic cleavage in Topo I. GST (A) and the indicated GST-Topo I fusion proteins (B–D) were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of nuclear extract from proliferating T lymphocytes and in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and PMSF).E, GTOPI-1 was incubated as in A but in the additional presence of the indicated concentrations of soybean trypsin inhibitor. The degradation of the various fusion proteins was then analyzed either by electrophoresis and fluorography or by immunoblot analysis.

FASEB J. 1987; 1: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar): the ubiquitin-26 S proteasome pathway, which requires ATP, and the lysosomal and Ca2+-dependent pathways, which are ATP-independent. To determine whether Topo I is degraded by the ubiquitin-26 S proteasome pathway, we therefore examined the effects of the ATP analog ATP-γ-S, of depletion of ATP by apyrase, and of the 26 S proteasome inhibitors hemin and lactacystin on the degradation of Topo I by nuclear extract of proliferating T cells. The degradation of the 97-kDa Topo I fragment to the 82-kDa fragment was partially inhibited by 1 mm ATP-γ-S (Fig.6 A), and that of the full-length protein to the 97-kDa fragment was partially blocked at 10 mm ATP-γ-S and was completely inhibited at 40 mm ATP-γ-S (Fig. 6 B). These data thus suggested that the degradation of Topo I may be ATP-dependent. However, depletion of ATP by apyrase failed to block Topo I degradation (Fig.7 A). To resolve these apparently inconsistent results, we examined the effect of ATP on Topo I proteolysis. The degradation of Topo I was inhibited by ATP in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6 C), similar to the effect of ATP-γ-S (Fig. 6 B). As a control, we examined the effect of cAMP; this nucleotide had no effect on the degradation of Topo I (data not shown).Figure 7Effects of apyrase and lactacystin on the degradation of Topo I in vitro. A, [35S]methionine-labeled Topo I and nuclear extract of proliferating T lymphocytes, each of which had been pretreated or not with apyrase, were incubated in the indicated combinations with a mixture of protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and PMSF) for 5 min at 37 °C. B, [35S]methionine-labeled Topo I was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in the presence of the indicated concentrations of lactacystin and in the absence or presence of nuclear extract of proliferating T cells. Topo I degradation was analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 2. PNE, nuclear extracts of proliferating T lymphocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously shown that the binding of ATP to Topo I results in a conformational change in the enzyme, whereas cAMP has no such effect (37.Chen H.J. Hwang J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, the inhibition of Topo I degradation by ATP or ATP-γ-S may be attributable to such a conformational change that renders the enzyme resistant to protease digestion. The conformation of Topo I may thus be a determining factor of the stability of the protein. However, we also cannot rule out the possibility that the inhibitory effect of ATP or ATP-γ-S on the Topo I proteolysis is due to a titration of Mg2+, because Mg2+ is required for Topo I proteolysis (see Fig. 9 B). Our data indicate that ATP is not required for the proteolysis of Topo I. Neither lactacystin (Fig.7 B) nor hemin (data not shown) inhibited the degradation of Topo I, further indicating that Topo I proteolysis is not mediated by the ATP-dependent 26 S proteasome pathway in proliferating T lymphocytes. The effects of E64 as well as of calpain I inhibitor and calpain II inhibitor on Topo I degradation were examined to determine the roles of the lysosomal and Ca2+-dependent proteolysis systems, respectively, in this phenomenon. None of these three inhibitors blocked the proteolysis of Topo I (data not shown). Together, our data suggest that the degradation of Topo I is not mediated by the ubiquitin-dependent 26 S proteasome, lysosomal, or Ca2+-dependent proteolytic pathways. Proteases can be classified into four types on the basis of their active sites: serine proteases, cysteine proteases, metalloproteases, and aspartic proteases. Proteases of each type are inhibited by corresponding specific blockers. To characterize the type of protease responsible for the degradation of Topo I, we examined the effects of various protease inhibitors, including aprotinin, PMSF, pepstatin, leupeptin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, EDTA (Fig.8), N-ethylmaleimide,N-α-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, chymostatin, and caspase inhibitors (data not shown), on Topo I degradation by nuclear extract of proliferating T cells. Of these various agents, only EDTA, aprotinin (trypsin inhibitor, pancreas type, from bovine lung), and soybean trypsin inhibitor exhibited an inhibitory effect on Topo I degradation. The degradation of the 97-kDa fragment of Topo I to the 82-kDa fragment was inhibited by aprotinin at concentrations of 50 and 167 μm (Fig. 8 B); however, aprotinin failed to block the degradation of the full-length protein to the 97-kDa intermediate. Soybean trypsin inhibitor blocked the degradation of full-length Topo I in a concentration-dependent manner, with complete inhibition of proteolysis apparent at a concentration of 150 μm (Fig. 8 C). Taken together, these results suggest that the protease responsible for Topo I degradation is an EDTA-sensitive, trypsin-like serine protease. The degradation of the 97-kDa fragment of Topo I to the 82-kDa fragment was inhibited by 1 mm EDTA (Fig. 8 A). Furthermore, degradation of the full-length enzyme to the 97-kDa intermediate was inhibited in the presence of 2 mm EDTA (Fig.9 A). These observations suggested that Mg2+ or Ca2+ might be required for Topo I proteolysis. We therefore investigated the effect of the Ca2+-specific chelator EGTA and addition of Ca2+ on this process. EGTA had no effect on the degradation of Topo I at concentrations up to 2 mm (Fig.9 A), and the addition of various concentrations of Ca2+ also did not stimulate proteolysis of Topo I (data not shown), indicating that Ca2+ is dispensable for proteolysis of Topo I. We further investigated the role of Mg2+"
