https://openalex.org/W1987370132,"Recent therapeutic advances in oncology have been driven by the identification of tumour genotype variations between patients, called interpatient heterogeneity, that predict the response of patients to targeted treatments. Subpopulations of cancer cells with unique genomes in the same patient may exist across different geographical regions of a tumour or evolve over time, called intratumour heterogeneity. Sequencing technologies can be used to characterize intratumour heterogeneity at diagnosis, monitor clonal dynamics during treatment and identify the emergence of clinical resistance during disease progression. Genetic interpatient and intratumour heterogeneity can pose challenges for the design of clinical trials that use these data."
https://openalex.org/W2013976594,"With the recent production of polar molecules in the quantum regime, long-range dipolar interactions are expected to facilitate the understanding of strongly interacting many-body quantum systems and to realize lattice spin models for exploring quantum magnetism. In atomic systems, where interactions require wave function overlap, effective spin interactions on a lattice can be realized via superexchange; however, the coupling is weak and limited to nearest-neighbor interactions. In contrast, dipolar interactions exist in the absence of tunneling and extend beyond nearest neighbors. This allows coherent spin dynamics to persist even at high entropy and low lattice filling. Effects of dipolar interactions in ultracold molecular gases have so far been limited to the modification of chemical reactions. We now report the observation of dipolar interactions of polar molecules pinned in a 3D optical lattice. We realize a lattice spin model with spin encoded in rotational states, prepared and probed by microwaves. This spin-exchange interaction arises from the resonant exchange of rotational angular momentum between two molecules. We observe clear oscillations in the evolution of the spin coherence in addition to an overall decay. The frequency of these oscillations, the strong dependence of the spin coherence time on the lattice filling, and the effect of a multi-pulse sequence designed to reverse dynamics due to two-body exchange interactions all provide evidence of dipolar interactions. We also demonstrate suppression of loss in weak lattices due to a quantum Zeno mechanism. Measurements of these tunneling-induced losses allow us to independently determine the lattice filling factor. These results comprise an initial exploration of the behavior of many-body spin models with direct, long-range spin interactions and lay the groundwork for future studies of many-body dynamics in spin lattices."
https://openalex.org/W2009870816,"Accumulation of intracellular tau fibrils has been the focus of research on the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related tauopathies. Here, we have developed a class of tau ligands, phenyl/pyridinyl-butadienyl-benzothiazoles/benzothiazoliums (PBBs), for visualizing diverse tau inclusions in brains of living patients with AD or non-AD tauopathies and animal models of these disorders. In vivo optical and positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging of a transgenic mouse model demonstrated sensitive detection of tau inclusions by PBBs. A pyridinated PBB, [(11)C]PBB3, was next applied in a clinical PET study, and its robust signal in the AD hippocampus wherein tau pathology is enriched contrasted strikingly with that of a senile plaque radioligand, [(11)C]Pittsburgh Compound-B ([(11)C]PIB). [(11)C]PBB3-PET data were also consistent with the spreading of tau pathology with AD progression. Furthermore, increased [(11)C]PBB3 signals were found in a corticobasal syndrome patient negative for [(11)C]PIB-PET."
https://openalex.org/W2046938310,"Dinner Time! Biological clocks allow organisms to anticipate cycles of feeding, activity, and rest so that metabolic enzymes in mitochondria are ready when needed. Peek et al. ( 10.1126/science.1243417 , published online 19 September; see the Perspective by Rey and Reddy ) describe a mechanism by which the biochemical elements of the circadian clock are linked to such control of mitochondrial metabolism. The clock controls rhythmic transcription of the gene encoding the rate-limiting enzyme required for synthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ). The concentration of NAD + in mitochondria determines the activity of the deacetylase SIRT3, which then controls acetylation and activity of key metabolic enzymes. NAD+ also influences clock function, and thus appears to be a versatile point at which regulation of oxidative metabolism is coordinated with the daily cycles of energy consumption."
https://openalex.org/W2043726848,"Animal cells harbour multiple innate effector mechanisms that inhibit virus replication. For the pathogenic retrovirus human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), these include widely expressed restriction factors, such as APOBEC3 proteins, TRIM5-α, BST2 (refs 4, 5) and SAMHD1 (refs 6, 7), as well as additional factors that are stimulated by type 1 interferon (IFN). Here we use both ectopic expression and gene-silencing experiments to define the human dynamin-like, IFN-induced myxovirus resistance 2 (MX2, also known as MXB) protein as a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 infection and as a key effector of IFN-α-mediated resistance to HIV-1 infection. MX2 suppresses infection by all HIV-1 strains tested, has equivalent or reduced effects on divergent simian immunodeficiency viruses, and does not inhibit other retroviruses such as murine leukaemia virus. The Capsid region of the viral Gag protein dictates susceptibility to MX2, and the block to infection occurs at a late post-entry step, with both the nuclear accumulation and chromosomal integration of nascent viral complementary DNA suppressed. Finally, human MX1 (also known as MXA), a closely related protein that has long been recognized as a broadly acting inhibitor of RNA and DNA viruses, including the orthomyxovirus influenza A virus, does not affect HIV-1, whereas MX2 is ineffective against influenza virus. MX2 is therefore a cell-autonomous, anti-HIV-1 resistance factor whose purposeful mobilization may represent a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of HIV/AIDS."

https://openalex.org/W2073902410,"The ten-eleven translocation (Tet) family of methylcytosine dioxygenases catalyze oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and promote DNA demethylation. Despite the abundance of 5hmC and Tet proteins in the brain, little is known about the functions of the neuronal Tet enzymes. Here, we analyzed Tet1 knockout mice (Tet1KO) and found downregulation of multiple neuronal activity-regulated genes, including Npas4, c-Fos, and Arc. Furthermore, Tet1KO animals exhibited abnormal hippocampal long-term depression and impaired memory extinction. Analysis of the key regulatory gene, Npas4, indicated that its promoter region, containing multiple CpG dinucleotides, is hypermethylated in both naive Tet1KO mice and after extinction training. Such hypermethylation may account for the diminished expression of Npas4 itself and its downstream targets, impairing transcriptional programs underlying cognitive processes. In summary, we show that neuronal Tet1 regulates normal DNA methylation levels, expression of activity-regulated genes, synaptic plasticity, and memory extinction."
https://openalex.org/W2018338317,"Dynamic changes in 5-methylcytosine (5mC) have been implicated in the regulation of gene expression critical for consolidation of memory. However, little is known about how these changes in 5mC are regulated in the adult brain. The enzyme methylcytosine dioxygenase TET1 (TET1) has been shown to promote active DNA demethylation in the nervous system. Therefore, we took a viral-mediated approach to overexpress the protein in the hippocampus and examine its potential involvement in memory formation. We found that Tet1 is a neuronal activity-regulated gene and that its overexpression leads to global changes in modified cytosine levels. Furthermore, expression of TET1 or a catalytically inactive mutant (TET1m) resulted in the upregulation of several neuronal memory-associated genes and impaired contextual fear memory. In summary, we show that neuronal Tet1 regulates DNA methylation levels and that its expression, independent of its catalytic activity, regulates the expression of CNS activity-dependent genes and memory formation."
https://openalex.org/W2103905237,"Genetic variation in neuregulin and its ErbB4 receptor has been linked to schizophrenia, although little is known about how they contribute to the disease process. Here, we have examined conditional Erbb4 mouse mutants to study how disruption of specific inhibitory circuits in the cerebral cortex may cause large-scale functional deficits. We found that deletion of ErbB4 from the two main classes of fast-spiking interneurons, chandelier and basket cells, causes relatively subtle but consistent synaptic defects. Surprisingly, these relatively small wiring abnormalities boost cortical excitability, increase oscillatory activity, and disrupt synchrony across cortical regions. These functional deficits are associated with increased locomotor activity, abnormal emotional responses, and impaired social behavior and cognitive function. Our results reinforce the view that dysfunction of cortical fast-spiking interneurons might be central to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia."

https://openalex.org/W2134581110,"The CYFIP1/SRA1 gene is located in a chromosomal region linked to various neurological disorders, including intellectual disability, autism, and schizophrenia. CYFIP1 plays a dual role in two apparently unrelated processes, inhibiting local protein synthesis and favoring actin remodeling. Here, we show that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-driven synaptic signaling releases CYFIP1 from the translational inhibitory complex, triggering translation of target mRNAs and shifting CYFIP1 into the WAVE regulatory complex. Active Rac1 alters the CYFIP1 conformation, as demonstrated by intramolecular FRET, and is key in changing the equilibrium of the two complexes. CYFIP1 thus orchestrates the two molecular cascades, protein translation and actin polymerization, each of which is necessary for correct spine morphology in neurons. The CYFIP1 interactome reveals many interactors associated with brain disorders, opening new perspectives to define regulatory pathways shared by neurological disabilities characterized by spine dysmorphogenesis."

Replication happens in the context of defects in the DNA template and other forms of replication stress that present challenges to both genetic and epigenetic inheritance. The replication machinery is highly regulated by replication stress responses to accomplish this goal. To identify important replication and stress response proteins, we combined isolation of proteins on nascent DNA (iPOND) with quantitative mass spectrometry. We identified 290 proteins enriched on newly replicated DNA at active, stalled, and collapsed replication forks. Approximately 16% of these proteins are known replication or DNA damage response proteins.

Significance: The data increase our understanding of the network of proteins involved in DNA replication and the replication stress response. Chromosomal replication requires the coordinated action of a large molecular machine, called the replisome, consisting of multiple subunits, including helicases, polymerases, histone chaperones, and chromatin-modifying enzymes. The replisome must work with speed and precision to replicate the DNA and chromatin during each cell division cycle. Damage to the DNA template from endogenous and environmental genotoxins, depletion of nucleotide precursors, and even difficult-to-replicate DNA sequences can impede replication fork progression. Multiple mechanisms respond to this stress to repair the damaged DNA, signal checkpoint activation, ensure the completion of DNA replication, and maintain genome stability. Defects in replication stress response mechanisms cause diseases that are characterized by developmental abnormalities, premature aging, and cancer predisposition.

Activated ATR stabilizes the stalled fork, promotes fork restart, and regulates cell cycle checkpoints to ensure completion of DNA synthesis prior to mitosis. If ATR is not functional, then forks collapse into double-strand breaks because of the action of unregulated fork remodeling and nuclease activities (6.Couch F.B. Bansbach C.E. Driscoll R.

The continued high rate of discovery of new replication stress response proteins suggests that our inventory of replication regulators remains incomplete. Thus, identifying proteins that function at active and damaged replication forks and characterizing how they work in a coordinated fashion to maintain genome integrity remain critically important research goals. We recently developed a technology called isolation of proteins on nascent DNA (iPOND) that can be used to track protein recruitment to active and damaged replication forks as well as study the processes of chromatin deposition and maturation (7.Sirbu B.M.

Analysis of protein dynamics at active, stalled, and collapsed replication forks.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 1320-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Importantly, the technique provides high resolution and sensitivity and is compatible with unbiased approaches such as mass spectrometry. iPOND uses the nucleoside analog 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) and click chemistry (8.Sirbu B.M. Couch F.B. Feigerle J.T. Bhaskara S. Hiebert S.W. Cortez D. Analysis of protein dynamics at active, stalled, and collapsed replication forks.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 1320-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). EdU is rapidly incorporated into newly synthesized DNA when added to cell culture medium and does not interfere with replication or cause detectable DNA damage when used in short term cell culture (8.Sirbu B.M. Couch F.B. Feigerle J.T. Bhaskara S. Hiebert S.W. Cortez D. Analysis of protein dynamics at active, stalled, and collapsed replication forks.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 1320-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 9.Salic A. Mitchison T.J. A chemical method for fast and sensitive detection of DNA synthesis in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 2415-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). An alkyne functional group on EdU can be reacted with an azide linked to biotin using click chemistry. This facilitates a streptavidin-biotin method of purification of the EdU-labeled nascent DNA with associated proteins. Fixation of cells with a reversible cross-linking agent prior to click chemistry and cell lysis permits purification under denaturing conditions, making a single-step isolation procedure possible. Cross-link reversal separates the proteins from the DNA fragments, which can then be detected by immunoblotting or mass spectrometry. Here we coupled iPOND to unbiased shotgun proteomics to probe the changes in replisome composition at active, stalled, and collapsed replication forks. iPOND was performed largely as described previously (7.Sirbu B.M. Couch F.B. Cortez D. Monitoring the spatiotemporal dynamics of proteins at replication forks and in assembled chromatin using isolation of proteins on nascent DNA.Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7: 594-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. 500 ml of logarithmically growing (3.3 × 106 cells/ml) suspension of 293T cells (a total of 1.6 × 109 cells) were labeled with 12 μm EdU for 15 min. An EdU labeling period of this length may label ∼15–20 kb of DNA depending on the rate of polymerization and how rapidly EdU is imported into the cell and phosphorylated by thymidine kinase (8.Sirbu B.M. Couch F.B. Feigerle J.T. Bhaskara S. Hiebert S.W. Cortez D. Analysis of protein dynamics at active, stalled, and collapsed replication forks.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 1320-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Following EdU incorporation, the stalled fork sample was incubated in 3 mm of hydroxyurea for 2 h, and the collapsed fork sample was treated with 3 mm hydroxyurea and 3 μm of ATR inhibitor for 2 h to induce fork collapse (10.Reaper P.M. Griffiths M.R. Long J.M. Charrier J.D. Maccormick S. Charlton P.A. Golec J.M. Pollard J.R. Selective killing of ATM- or p53-deficient cancer cells through inhibition of ATR.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2011; 7: 428-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). After EdU labeling, the thymidine chase sample was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 4 min, medium was decanted, and cells were resuspended in medium equilibrated for temperature and pH containing 10 μm thymidine. The thymidine chase was conducted for 60 min. All samples were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, followed by 5-min incubation with 0.125 m glycine to quench the formaldehyde. Fixed samples were split evenly into six 50-ml conical tubes, centrifuged at 2000 rpm at 4 °C for 6 min, washed three times with PBS, and frozen at −80 °C. Five of the six tubes were processed independently on a scale of 2.7 × 108 cells/sample for iPOND purifications. Briefly, click chemistry reactions were performed to conjugate biotin to the EdU-labeled DNA. Streptavidin beads were used to capture the biotin-conjugated DNA-protein complexes. Captured complexes were washed extensively using SDS and high-salt wash buffers. Purified replication fork proteins were eluted under reducing conditions by boiling in 2× SDS sample buffer for 25 min. One-sixth of the eluted protein sample was resolved 1 cm into a 10% Novex precast gel (Invitrogen), excised from the gel slice, alkylated, and in-gel trypsin-digested using standard procedures. Recovered tryptic peptides were subjected to two-dimensional LC-MS/MS (multidimensional protein identification technology) separation as described previously (11.MacCoss M.J. McDonald W.H. Saraf A. Sadygov R. Clark J.M. Tasto J.J. Gould K.L. Wolters D. Washburn M. Weiss A. Clark J.I. Yates 3rd., J.R. Shotgun identification of protein modifications from protein complexes and lens tissue.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 7900-7905Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Briefly, digested peptides were separated by a combined strong cation exchange and reversed-phase chromatographic strategy. Subsets of peptides were eluted from the strong cation exchange onto the reverse phase using a series of ammonium acetate pulses of increasing concentration. This was performed for eight steps, each followed by a 105-min aqueous to organic separation on the reversed-phase column. Eluted peptides were directly nanoelectrospray-ionized and introduced into an LTQ-XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) where peptide tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) were collected in a data-dependent manner. The peptide spectral data were searched against the canonical human proteome subset of UniProtKB (v. 155) using the Myrimatch (v. 1.6.75) (12.Tabb D.L. Fernando C.G. Chambers M.C. MyriMatch. Highly accurate tandem mass spectral peptide identification by multivariate hypergeometric analysis.J. Proteome Res. 2007; 6: 654-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), Sequest (v. 27) (13.Yates 3rd, J.R. Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Schieltz D.

Protein groups were assembled using IDPicker, which uses parsimony to report the minimum number of confident protein identifications (15.Ma Z.Q. Dasari S. Chambers M.C. Litton M.D. Sobecki S.M.

Proteome Res. 2009; 8: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Matched peptides were filtered at a 5% peptide and protein false discovery rate, and each protein required a minimum of two independent peptides for identification. Protein identifiers were converted to EntrezID unique identifiers using the UniProt ID mapping database (16.UniProt C. Reorganizing the protein space at the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt).Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: D71-D75Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar) and the DAVID bioinformatics database (17.Huang da W. Sherman B.T. Lempicki R.A. Systematic and integrative analysis of large gene lists using DAVID bioinformatics resources.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (25496) Google Scholar). To determine fold enrichments of proteins relative to the negative controls, spectral count data were imported into the statistical software program QuasiTel (18.Li M. Gray W. Zhang H. Chung C.H. Billheimer D. Yarbrough W.G. Liebler D.C. Shyr Y. Slebos R.J. Comparative shotgun proteomics using spectral count data and quasi-likelihood modeling.J. Proteome Res. 2010; 9: 4295-4305Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) for pairwise comparisons. QuasiTel applies a quasi-likelihood model to raw spectral count data and reports protein fold enrichment and statistical significance as a quasi p value. Spectral count data are normalized for each multidimensional protein identification technology run using the total number of spectra reported for the run. The threshold for spectral counts was set at an average of one spectral count per experimental sample. For example, when comparing the five replicates from the replication fork sample to the five replicates from the chromatin chase sample, a minimum of 10 total spectral counts was required from the 10 samples for QuasiTel comparisons. Furthermore, to be considered a protein significantly enriched on nascent DNA, the filtering criteria required a minimum of 1.5-fold enrichment above both of the negative controls and a quasi p value of ≤ 0.05. These filtering criteria were applied to proteins identified using each of the three protein identification search algorithms (Myrimatch plus Sequest, Myrimatch alone, and Sequest alone). Therefore, three lists of enriched proteins were generated independently. The final data reported in supplemental Tables S1–S3 represent the union of all three lists and report the median fold enrichment relative to the chromatin-bound negative control, median p value, and median spectral counts. The median p value, in some cases, is > 0.05 because three independent p values were calculated by QuasiTel for each protein identified by the three different search algorithm methods. If any one of the analyses yielded a p value < 0.05, that protein is reported in supplemental Tables S1–S3 along with the median p value from the three analyses. It should also be noted that when no spectra were detected in the thymidine chase negative control, QuasiTel calculated relative fold enrichment using a small, non-zero value in the denominator. This factor may lead to an overestimation of protein enrichment. Although these values are included in supplemental Tables S1–S3, they are omitted from FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4.FIGURE 3iPOND-MS identifies proteins at stalled replication forks.

To display median fold enrichment relative to the thymidine chase negative control, median quasi p value, and median spectral counts from the experimental sample were graphed using R. Protein network modeling was performed using the GeneMANIA prediction server (20.Warde-Farley D. Donaldson S.L. Comes O. Zuberi K. Badrawi R. Chao P. Franz M. Grouios C. Kazi F. Lopes C.T.

The antibodies used were as follows: H2A, H2B, MSH2, and SNF2H (Abcam); H1 (Millipore); PCNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); SNF2L (Cell Signaling Technology); BAZ1B (Novus). Four individual siRNAs for each of the genes arrayed in 384-well dishes were transfected into U2OS cells at 10 nm final siRNA concentrations. Three days after transfection, cells were treated with 2 mm hydroxyurea for 24 h. Hydroxyurea was removed, and cells were incubated with 10 μm EdU for 4 h. Cells were then fixed with paraformaldehyde and processed with Alexa Fluor 488-coupled biotin azide followed by labeling with antibodies to γH2AX as described previously (21.Bansbach C.E. Bétous R. Lovejoy C.A. Glick G.G. Cortez D. The annealing helicase SMARCAL1 maintains genome integrity at stalled replication forks.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 2405-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Images were obtained on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Opera automated microscope, and the intensities of EdU and γH2AX per nucleus were quantitated by Columbus image analysis software. The ratio of γH2AX to EdU intensities was used as the final scoring criterion. Samples with elevated ratios were identified using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test requiring a false discovery rate-adjusted p value of < 0.001 and a ratio of at least 2.0. As a comparison, the average ratio for the negative control siRNA was 1.07 with an S.E. of 0.026. To identify proteins associated with nascent DNA at active, stalled, and collapsed replication forks, we coupled iPOND purifications to mass spectrometry. Five samples were prepared for iPOND-MS (Fig. 1A). For all samples, cells were treated for 15 min with EdU to label nascent DNA. To examine proteins at active replication forks, EdU-labeled cells were collected immediately. To monitor proteins associated with stalled replication forks, EdU-labeled cells were treated with 3 mm hydroxyurea for 2 h to arrest fork movement and induce a replication stress response. To identify proteins associated with fork collapse, cells were treated with hydroxyurea and a selective ATR inhibitor (10.Reaper P.M. Griffiths M.R. Long J.M. Charrier J.D. Maccormick S. Charlton P.A. Golec J.M. Pollard J.R. Selective killing of ATM- or p53-deficient cancer cells through inhibition of ATR.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2011; 7: 428-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) for 2 h. These conditions elicit fork collapse, including accumulation of double-strand breaks and excess single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) at the replication fork (6.Couch F.B. Bansbach C.E. Driscoll R. Luzwick J.W. Glick G.G. Bétous R. Carroll C.M. Jung S.Y. Qin J. Cimprich K.A. Cortez D. ATR phosphorylates SMARCAL1 to prevent replication fork collapse.Genes Dev. 2013; 27: 1610-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). EdU remained in the growth media during the hydroxyurea treatments. The specificity of replication fork protein purifications was tested relative to two negative controls. The first were cells treated identically to the normal replication fork sample, but the biotin azide was omitted during the iPOND procedure. Proteins purified in this “no click reaction” sample represent those that interact nonspecifically with streptavidin-conjugated beads. For the second negative control, cells labeled with EdU were washed and then incubated with medium containing a small amount of thymidine for 1 h. This procedure allows replication to continue without additional EdU incorporation. The small concentration of thymidine does not interfere with replication but is used to compete for whatever EdU is left in the cell after removing it from the growth medium. Thus, this negative control monitors proteins bound to mature chromatin that are no longer close to the replication fork. Proteins detected in this “thymidine chase” sample represent chromatin-bound proteins that are not specifically enriched at replisomes (8.Sirbu B.M. Couch F.B. Feigerle J.T. Bhaskara S. Hiebert S.W. Cortez D. Analysis of protein dynamics at active, stalled, and collapsed replication forks.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 1320-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). To test the relative enrichment of replication proteins in the samples submitted for mass spectrometry analyses, iPOND purifications were examined for PCNA levels. As observed previously, PCNA was detected at elongating replication forks, and its levels decreased in the thymidine chase sample (Fig. 1B). Although still detectable, PCNA levels at stalled and collapsed replication forks were also decreased compared with the active fork sample, likely because of unloading of PCNA from the mature Okazaki fragments (8.Sirbu B.M. Couch F.B. Feigerle J.T. Bhaskara S. Hiebert S.W. Cortez D. Analysis of protein dynamics at active, stalled, and collapsed replication forks.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 1320-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The equal level of histone H2B detected on isolated chromatin (Fig. 1B) indicates that an equivalent amount of EdU-labeled DNA was purified in each sample. The five experimental samples were purified independently five times each using the iPOND procedure (Fig. 1C). Eluted proteins were analyzed using two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (multidimensional protein identification technology). The MS/MS spectra were matched to the human protein database using the Myrimatch and Sequest search engines (12.Tabb D.L. Fernando C.G. Chambers M.C. MyriMatch.

https://openalex.org/W2007487283,"The ability to learn not only from experienced but also from merely fictive outcomes without direct rewarding or punishing consequences should improve learning and resulting value-guided choice. Using an instrumental learning task in combination with multiple single-trial regression of predictions derived from a computational reinforcement-learning model on human EEG, we found an early temporospatial double dissociation in the processing of fictive and real feedback. Thereafter, real and fictive feedback processing converged at a common final path, reflected in parietal EEG activity that was predictive of future choices. In the choice phase, similar parietal EEG activity related to certainty of the impending response was predictive for the decision on the next trial as well. These parietal EEG effects may reflect a common adaptive cortical mechanism of updating or strengthening of stimulus values by integrating outcomes, learning rate, and certainty, which is active during both decision making and evaluation. Neuronal processing of real (rewarding, punishing) and fictive action outcomes (which would have happened had one acted differently) differs for 400 ms and then converges on a common adaptive mechanism driving future decision making and learning."

The CCK interneurons provide a surprisingly strong feedforward inhibitory drive to effectively control the coincident excitation of CA1 pyramidal neurons by convergent inputs. Thus, in-phase cortico-hippocampal activity provides a powerful heterosynaptic learning rule for long-term gating of information flow through the hippocampal excitatory macrocircuit by the silencing of the CCK inhibitory microcircuit."

These aggressors trigger the JA pathway, which in turn up-regulates overlapping yet distinct sets of genes that lead to the accumulation of a specific arsenal of chemical defenses and proteins (6.Mithöfer A.

Regulation and function of Arabidopsis JASMONATE ZIM-domain genes in response to wounding and herbivory.Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 952-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The processes and enzymes leading to jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis are relatively well described (2.Wasternack C. Hause B. Jasmonates. Biosynthesis, perception, signal transduction and action in plant stress response, growth and development.Ann. Bot. 2013; 111: 1021-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar), but the nature of the initial molecular event triggering the pathway is still elusive. In Arabidopsis, partially redundant lipases release the precursor fatty acid α-linolenic acid from plastidial membranes where it is converted to 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid through the sequential action of 13-lipoxygenases, the cytochrome P450 allene oxide synthase, and allene oxide cyclase. 12-Oxo-phytodienoic acid is then translocated to peroxisomes where it is reduced by 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductase 3 before three rounds of β-oxidation of the side chain. JA has been viewed initially as the active jasmonate in plants, due to its abundance and relative stability, and also because JA treatment recapitulates most known jasmonate responses. JA is subjected to many enzymatic modifications that generate an array of derivatives, including oxidized and/or sulfonated forms or amino acid or sugar conjugates (2.Wasternack C. Hause B. Jasmonates. Biosynthesis, perception, signal transduction and action in plant stress response, growth and development.Ann. Bot. 2013; 111: 1021-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar, 11.Koo A.J. Howe G.A. Catabolism and deactivation of the lipid-derived hormone jasmonoyl-isoleucine.Front. Plant Sci. 2012; 3: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These individual jasmonates vary in abundance, biological activity, and distribution under various stimuli and in different tissues. For example, the JA metabolite 12OH-JA was first described in potato and Solanaceous species for its tuber-inducing activity, hence its trivial name tuberonic acid (TA) (12.Yoshihara T. Omer E.-L.A. Koshino H. Sakamura S. Kikuta Y. Koda Y. Structure of a tuber-inducing stimulus from potato leaves (Solanum tuberosum L.).Agric. Biol. Chem. 1989; 53: 2835-2837Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). More recently, TA and its sulfonated or glucosylated derivatives were found as commonly occurring metabolites of JA, particularly in the wound response (13.Gidda S.K. Miersch O. Levitin A. Schmidt J. Wasternack C. Varin L. Biochemical and molecular characterization of a hydroxyjasmonate sulfotransferase from Arabidopsis thaliana.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17895-17900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 14.Miersch O. Neumerkel J. Dippe M. Stenzel I. Wasternack C. Hydroxylated jasmonates are commonly occurring metabolites of jasmonic acid and contribute to a partial switch-off in jasmonate signaling.New Phytol. 2008; 177: 114-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), but the mode of formation of TA and biological activity of its derivatives are still largely unknown. TA formation has, however, been proposed as a partial switch-off in JA signaling (14.Miersch O. Neumerkel J. Dippe M. Stenzel I. Wasternack C. Hydroxylated jasmonates are commonly occurring metabolites of jasmonic acid and contribute to a partial switch-off in jasmonate signaling.New Phytol. 2008; 177: 114-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, TA could also be a metabolic intermediate, for example, TA-glucoside was described as a specific signal triggering leaf closing in the rain tree Samanea saman (15.Nakamura Y. Mithöfer A. Kombrink E. Boland W. Hamamoto S. Uozumi N. Tohma K. Ueda M. 12-Hydroxyjasmonic acid glucoside is a COI1-JAZ-independent activator of leaf-closing movement in Samanea saman.Plant Physiol. 2011; 155: 1226-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Among many existing JA modification routes, the JASMONATE RESISTANT 1 (JAR1)-catalyzed formation of (+)-7-iso-jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine (JA-Ile) is the critical signal activation step (16.Staswick P.E. Tiryaki I. The oxylipin signal jasmonic acid is activated by an enzyme that conjugates it to isoleucine in Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2117-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). JAR1 is a member of the GH3 family of acyl amidosynthases, whose other described members conjugate auxin to amino acids (17.Staswick P.E. Serban B. Rowe M. Tiryaki I. Maldonado M.T. Maldonado M.C. Suza W. Characterization of an Arabidopsis enzyme family that conjugates amino acids to indole-3-acetic acid.Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 616-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar), indicating possible metabolic cross-talk between auxin and JA pathways. JA-Ile specifically promotes assembly of a co-receptor composed of the F-box protein CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1) and Jasmonate ZIM domain (JAZ) proteins. JAZ proteins constitute a family of transcriptional repressors that under low JA-Ile content prevent the transcription of target genes. JA-Ile-triggered co-receptor assembly results in JAZ ubiquitination by the SCFCOI1 E3 ligase and their subsequent proteolytic removal by the 26S proteasome, leading to the derepression of target genes, and the deployment of the JA response (18.Fonseca S. Chico J.M. Solano R. The jasmonate pathway. The ligand, the receptor and the core signalling module.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2009; 12: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 19.Katsir L. Chung H.S. Koo A.J. Howe G.A. Jasmonate signaling. A conserved mechanism of hormone sensing.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2008; 11: 428-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Plants have also evolved mechanisms to reset JA signaling to pre-stimulation conditions. For example, the strong JAZ repressor gene co-induction with the JA metabolic pathway is believed to rapidly restore a repressed state on JA-responsive promoters (10.Chung H.S. Koo A.J. Gao X. Jayanty S. Thines B. Jones A.D. Howe G.A. Regulation and function of Arabidopsis JASMONATE ZIM-domain genes in response to wounding and herbivory.Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 952-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Another means to terminate signaling is to modify or eliminate the hormonal signal. We and others have recently described a cytochrome P450 (CYP)-based catabolic pathway that contributes to the turnover of JA-Ile. CYP94B3 and CYP94C1 oxidize JA-Ile at the C12 position, leading to sequential accumulation of the oxidized derivatives 12OH-JA-Ile and 12COOH-JA-Ile (20.Heitz T. Widemann E. Lugan R. Miesch L.

This oxidative metabolism accounts largely for the transient nature of JA-Ile accumulation after wounding and, similarly to other plant hormones (23.Mizutani M. Ohta D. Diversification of P450 genes during land plant evolution.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2010; 61: 291-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), corresponds to the attenuation of the hormonal signal, as plants with perturbed JA-Ile oxidizing activity have an altered JA response (20.Heitz T. Widemann E. Lugan R. Miesch L. Ullmann P. Désaubry L. Holder E. Grausem B. Kandel S. Miesch M. Werck-Reichhart D. Pinot F.

Gene families encoding auxin amidohydrolases and their regulation by interacting microorganisms have been described in Brassica rapa (25.Schuller A. Ludwig-Müller J.

In Arabidopsis, they form a 7-gene family (IAR3, ILL1, ILL2, ILL3, ILL5, ILL6, and ILR1) with several members known to cleave auxin-amino acid conjugates (27.Rampey R.A. LeClere S. Kowalczyk M.

Jasmonic acid-dependent and -independent signaling pathways control wound-induced gene activation in Arabidopsis thaliana.Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Recently, Woldemariam et al. (40.Woldemariam M.G. Onkokesung N. Baldwin I.T. Galis I. Jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine hydrolase 1 (JIH1) regulates jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine levels and attenuates plant defenses against herbivores.Plant J. 2012; 72: 758-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) reported the characterization of the IAR3-related jasmonoyl-isoleucine hydrolase 1 (JIH1), an herbivore-induced amidohydrolase from the wild species Nicotiana attenuata, which contributes to JA-Ile signal attenuation by cleaving the hormone into JA and Ile. We describe here the characterization of IAR3 and ILL6, two of three amidohydrolase genes that are co-regulated with the JA pathway in Arabidopsis. IAR3 was previously characterized in the context of auxin conjugate hydrolysis (28.Davies R.T. Goetz D.H. Lasswell J. Anderson M.N. Bartel B. IAR3 encodes an auxin conjugate hydrolase from Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), but no data were available for ILL6. Starting from a metabolic analysis of several JA pathway mutants, we hypothesized the action of amidohydrolases to explain the particular jasmonate profiles in these lines. Indeed, recombinant IAR3 and ILL6 were found to cleave JA-Ile in vitro, consistent with a role in hormonal turnover upon wounding. Interestingly, the enzymes also seem to act on the hydroxylated JA-Ile conjugate, with important consequences on the homeostasis of oxidized jasmonates. Particularly, we elucidate an unexpected mode of TA formation that, instead of direct hydroxylation of JA, proceeds through the cleavage of JAR1- and CYP94-generated 12OH-JA-Ile. Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes used were all in the Col0 ecotype and grown under a 12/12-h photoperiod in a growth chamber. T-DNA insertion lines used were: coi1-1, jar1-1, the double mutant between cyp94c1-1 (SALK_55455) and cyp94b3-1 (CS302217) described in Ref. 20.Heitz T. Widemann E. Lugan R. Miesch L. Ullmann P.

For wounding experiments, between 4 and 6 fully expanded leaves of 6–7-week-old plants were wounded three times across the midvein with a hemostat. At increasing time points following mechanical damage, leaf samples were quickly harvested and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen before storing at −80 °C until use. Total RNA was extracted from plant leaves with TRIzol reagent (Molecular Research Center).

The hydroxyl group and carboxyl function of 12OH-JA-Me-Ile were successively protected to provide 12-OAc-dioxaspiro-JA-Me-Ile. After saponification of the latter, the primary alcohol was oxidized using tetrapropylammonium perruthenate-N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (34.Ogawa N. Kobayashi Y.

The complete procedures, the characterization of intermediates, and final product are given in supplemental Methods S1. For heterologous expression of IAR3 and ILL6, open reading frame sequences deleted of the 25 N-terminal signal peptide-encoding codons were amplified using Phusion Taq Polymerase (Thermo Scientific) prior to cloning in the pENTR1a (Invitrogen) plasmid in the DH5α Escherichia coli strain. Inserts with error-free sequences were recombined into the expression vector pHMGWA using GatewayTM technology (Invitrogen). Plasmids were further transformed into E. coli SoluBL21 strain (AMS Biotechnology, Abingdon, UK). Ice-cold bacterial pellets from isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced cultures were collected and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mg/ml of lysozyme, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm EDTA, 0,1% Tween 20) at an A600 of 20. Bacteria were lysed by sonication on ice for 2 min. Clarified protein lysates were filtered and loaded on a 1-ml HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol installed on an Äkta Purifier10 Liquid chromatography system. The column was washed with equilibration buffer and bound protein was eluted with equilibration buffer complemented with 500 mm imidazole. Eluate was desalted on PD10 columns and the protein concentration was determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a bovine serum albumin standard series. Incubation conditions were based on those described for IAR3 activity with IAA-Ala (Sigma) (36.LeClere S. Tellez R. Rampey R.A. Matsuda S.P. Bartel B. Characterization of a family of IAA-amino acid conjugate hydrolases from Arabidopsis.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20446-20452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Incubations were performed in 200 μl containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μm JA-Ile or 12OH-JA-Ile or 12COOH-JA-Ile synthesized as described in the previous section as substrate. Control reactions were run with a similar amount of purified maltose-binding protein. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C and stopped by addition of 40 μl of 1 m HCl before extraction with 240 μl of ethyl acetate. After brief vortexing and centrifugation, the upper organic phase was dried under N2 flow, and reconstituted with 150 μl of MeOH before UPLC-MS analysis as described below. Jasmonates were identified and quantified in plant extracts and enzymatic incubations by ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), using MS transitions determined from pure standards (JA, 12OH-JA, JA-Ile, 12OH-JA-Ile, or 12COOH-JA-Ile). The relative quantification in samples was achieved by reporting MS peak areas relative to internal standard peak area and mass of biological material. Absolute quantifications of JA, 12OH-JA, JA-Ile, 12OH-JA-Ile, or 12COOH-JA-Ile were determined by comparison of a sample signal with dose-response curves established for each pure compound. For plant extraction, 5 volumes of ice-cold 90% methanol containing 9,10-dihydro-JA and 9,10-dihydro-JA-Ile as internal standards were added to one fresh weight (100–150 mg pre-weighed) of frozen leaf powder in a screw-capped tube containing glass beads. Material was ground twice for 30 s with a Precellys 24 tissue homogenizer (Bertin Technologies, Montigny-Le-Bretonneux, France). Homogenates were cleared by two successive centrifugations at 20,000 × g and supernatants were saved for UPLC-MS analysis.

https://openalex.org/W2045915987,"Neutrophil proteinases released at sites of inflammation can affect tissue function by either activating or disarming signal transduction mediated by proteinase-activated receptors (PARs). Because PAR1 is expressed at sites where abundant neutrophil infiltration occurs, we hypothesized that neutrophil-derived enzymes might also regulate PAR1 signaling. We report here that both neutrophil elastase and proteinase-3 cleave the human PAR1 N terminus at sites distinct from the thrombin cleavage site. This cleavage results in a disarming of thrombin-activated calcium signaling through PAR1. However, the distinct non-canonical tethered ligands unmasked by neutrophil elastase and proteinase-3, as well as synthetic peptides with sequences derived from these novel exposed tethered ligands, selectively stimulated PAR1-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. This signaling was blocked by pertussis toxin, implicating a Gαi-triggered signal pathway. We conclude that neutrophil proteinases trigger biased PAR1 signaling and we describe a novel set of tethered ligands that are distinct from the classical tethered ligand revealed by thrombin. We further demonstrate the function of this biased signaling in regulating endothelial cell barrier integrity."

In February 1637 in Amsterdam, the cost of a single exotic tulip bulb reached a price equal to ten times what a skilled craftsman earned in a year. The price of the same bulb collapsed a few days later. The dramatic rise and fall of tulip bulb prices is a famous historical example of a financial bubble (Kindleberger and Aliber, 2005Kindleberger C.P. Aliber R.Z. Manias, panics, and crashes: a history of financial crises. John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken, NJ2005Crossref Scopus (517) Google Scholar). A bubble is conventionally defined by active trading of an asset at prices that are considerably higher than its intrinsic fundamental value. Examples of modern bubbles include Japanese stocks in the 1990s, the US high-tech sector in the late 1990s, and housing prices, which rose and crashed in many countries from 2000–2008. All of these bubbles (especially the housing crash) caused long-lasting macroeconomic disruptions (Shiller, 2005Shiller R.J. Irrational Exuberance.Second Edition. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ2005Google Scholar). Modern bubble episodes have also led to a substantial shift in thinking about the capacity of prices to act as sober information aggregation mechanisms that guide efficient allocation of capital. Policy makers, academics, and market participants alike are now more familiar with, and groping to understand, the ways that prices can reflect pathological valuation and are actively debating whether policy interventions can help (Akerlof and Shiller, 2009Akerlof G. Shiller R. Animal Spirits. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ2009Google Scholar). Despite these dramatic historical and modern examples, there is no well-accepted theory of how bubbles start and end. One common definition of bubbles is rapid price appreciation followed by a crash (Brunnermeier, 2008Brunnermeier M.K. Bubbles.in: Durlauf S.N. Blume L.E. The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics. Palgrave Macmillan, Basingstoke2008Google Scholar). However, this definition has no predictive power for identifying an ongoing bubble, since it does not identify a bubble before it crashes. Furthermore, fundamental asset values are rarely known with precision, so it is difficult to identify a bubble if bubbles are defined as prices above an elusive fundamental value. One way to learn about bubbles is to observe trading in an experimental market for artificial assets that have a known fundamental value. In these markets, price variation cannot be explained by changes in fundamentals. In fact, several carefully controlled economics experiments have shown that certain classes of asset markets do generate price bubbles quite regularly, even when intrinsic values are easy to compute and are known to traders (Smith et al., 1988Smith V.L.

The nature of bubbles has also been intensely investigated in theory (Abreu and Brunnermeier, 2003Abreu D. Brunnermeier M.K.

Bubbles, Crises, and Heterogeneous Beliefs.in: Fouque J. Langsam J.A. Handbook on Systemic Risk. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge2013Google Scholar). Recent work in neuroeconomics has shown how financial decision theory can be informed by neuroscientific data (Bossaerts, 2009Bossaerts P. What Decision Neuroscience Teaches Us About Financial Decision Making.Annu. Rev. Fin. Econ. 2009; 1: 383-404Crossref Google Scholar). In particular, studies have started to dissect the neural mechanisms by which risk processing (Preuschoff et al., 2008Preuschoff K. Quartz S.R. Bossaerts P.

Exploring the Nature of “Trader Intuition.”.J. Finance. 2010; 65: 1703-1723Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and mental accounting of trading outcomes (C. Frydman, personal communication) shape financial decisions. However, the neural mechanisms underpinning the formation of a financial bubble are still unknown. Understanding of these mechanisms could prove critical in distinguishing between alternative hypotheses, each requiring different macroeconomic interventions. This study, which combines experimental finance settings together with behavioral modeling and neuroimaging methods, aims to identify the neural coding scheme at the core of bubble formation. We focus here on how the representation of assets trading values in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a brain region heavily involved in representing goal value (Rangel et al., 2008Rangel A.

Our hypothesis is that the increase in prices observed in bubble markets is associated with the neural representation of inflated trading values in vmPFC, which produces an enhanced susceptibility to buying assets at prices exceeding their fundamental value. We test the hypothesis that the inflated values are caused by participants’ maladaptive attempts to forecast the intentions of other players in a fast-growing market. In particular, we propose that the more dorsal portion of the prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), a region well known to represent the mental state of other individuals (also known as theory of mind; ToM) (Frith and Frith, 2003Frith U. Frith C.D. Development and neurophysiology of mentalizing.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2003; 358: 459-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar, Amodio and Frith, 2006Amodio D.M.

USA. 2008; 105: 6741-6746Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), is involved in updating the value computation in vmPFC, stimulating the formation of a financial bubble. In order to clarify the role played by intentions in modulating activity in these brain regions during financial bubbles, we introduce a computational concept from financial theory. This metric captures the dynamic changes from a steady, regular arrival of buying and selling orders to a more variable arrival process (perhaps signaling the start of a bubble, as orders arrive rapidly due to excitement, or an impending crash, when orders arrive slowly as traders hold their breath) that can signal the presence of strategic agents in a market. Activity in medial prefrontal regions is correlated with this index more strongly in bubble markets than in nonbubble markets and is associated with the individual’s propensity to ride the financial bubble. Twenty-one participants were scanned while trading in experimental markets. Trading activity in six actual experimental markets (collected in previous behavioral studies; Porter and Smith, 2003Porter D.P. Smith V.L. Stock market bubbles in the laboratory.J. Behav. Finance. 2003; 4: 7-20Crossref Google Scholar) was replayed over a 2-day scanning schedule. On each day, the participants traded in three experimental markets. Each market was divided into fifteen trading periods. During each trading period, the scanned participants observed a fast-motion visual representation of the prices of offers to sell (asks) and offers to buy (bids), which were actually inputted by the participants who had taken part in the original behavioral experiments. Subjects started with a cash endowment of $60. The screen was frozen at random intervals (2–3 times each period). At these freeze points, participants were allowed to stay (do nothing) or buy or sell one, two, or three shares at the current market price by pressing a keypad. After the choice was inputted, an update of the participants’ portfolio (number of the shares held and cash) was presented on the screen. This was followed by a variable resting phase. At the end of each of the fifteen periods, the trading activity was interrupted, and participants were shown the dividend paid to the shareholder for that period. The traded assets paid a dividend worth an expected value of $0.24 in each period to subjects who held those assets. Therefore, the intrinsic expected value of buying and holding assets was initially $3.60. The assets’ intrinsic value (fundamental value) declined by $0.24 after each period (since there were fewer future dividends lying ahead). The asset value in period t was therefore $0.24 × (15 − t + 1) (see Experimental Procedures for more details). Three of the six sessions used in the study were nonbubble markets; in those sessions, the market prices were tracking the fundamental value of the asset closely (Figure 1A). The other three sessions were bubble markets, in which market prices rose well above the intrinsic value in later periods (Figure 1B; Figure S1 available online). Our initial approach was to quantify how participants’ choices (i.e., buy, sell, or stay) were influenced by market parameters such as bid and ask prices and fundamental values. We performed an ordered logistic regression using participants’ choices (i.e., buy, sell, or stay) as dependent variables and market prices and fundamental values as independent variables. The parameter estimates showed that in both the bubble and nonbubble markets, the participants’ behavior was significantly modulated by prices and fundamental values, but that those two factors explained less variance in the bubble markets data (pseudo R2 = 0.27; Bayesian information criterion [BIC] = 2,089) than in nonbubble (pseudo R2 = 0.33; BIC = 1,840). Notably, there was a significant difference between bubble and nonbubble market coefficients computed for prices (t test: t = 3.48; p < 0.05) and for fundamental value (t test: t = 4.24; p < 0.001). Coefficients for prices and fundamentals together with a summary statistics are presented in Table 1. These results suggest that during financial bubbles, participants’ choices are less driven by explicit information available in the market (i.e., prices and fundamentals) and are more driven by other computational processes, perhaps imagining the path of future prices and likely behavior of other traders.Table 1Ordinal Logistic RegressionMarket ParameterBubble MarketsNonbubble MarketsPrices−0.011 (±0.002)∗−0.020 (±0.004)∗Fundamental values0.009 (±0.001)∗∗0.02 (±0.004)∗∗Summary StatisticsBubble MarketsNonbubble MarketsPseudo R20.270.33Bayesian information criterion (BIC)2,0891,840The dependent variable is an ordered variable (buy, stay, sell).

The SEM is reported within parentheses; bubble versus nonbubble markets: ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.001. To further investigate this issue, we measured how the neural representation of value changes when participants trade assets in bubble markets compared with nonbubble markets (using fMRI). Our hypothesis was that the increased trade volume in bubble markets should be associated with an inflated representation of portfolio profits. We reasoned that if the formation of bubbles is a consequence of inflated value representation, a brain region that codes for parametric changes in trading values should have increased activity when participants trade in bubble markets. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a parametric variable that captured the trial-by-trial variance in the value of each participant’s trading position. We called this variable current portfolio value (CPV), a combination of the value in cash and in shares held by a participant (or trader) at each point in time (CPV[t] = cash + [shares × fundamental value at time t]). CPV was used as a parametric regressor in a general linear model to isolate changes in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal underpinning the increased representation of trading values during bubble markets compared to nonbubble markets. This analysis yielded a significant interaction in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC peak [3, 53, −2], t = 3.48; p < 0.05 small volume correction [SVC] for multiple comparison), a brain region that plays a key role in encoding the goal values that are used to guide choice (Figure 2A; for a complete list of activations see also Figure S1). We therefore confirmed, consistent with our initial hypothesis, that the parametric representation of the portfolio value (CPV) was increased during bubble markets. This is illustrated by the pattern of activity in vmPFC (percent BOLD signal changes) in response to increasing levels of CPV in both bubble and nonbubble markets (Figure 2B). We next reasoned that if inflated trading values represented in vmPFC play a role in the formation of a financial bubble, activity in this region should predict the behavioral tendency to buy shares when their prices are above the fundamental values (a behavior that stimulates and sustains the formation of a financial bubble). To test this, we constructed an independent parameter that quantified the participants’ tendency to ride the bubble. We called this between-subject index “bubble susceptibility,” which is the extra price paid by participants to purchase shares at prices above the fundamental value (see Experimental Procedures for more details). We then entered this bubble susceptibility index as a between-subjects covariate in the parametric general linear model (GLM) model described above. This analysis yielded a significant correlation in vmPFC (peak [−6, 50, 1]; t = 3.44; p < 0.05 SVC for multiple comparisons). More precisely, activity in vmPFC was a significant predictor of the behavioral tendency to ride bubbles (Figure 3). Note that while the overall buying at prices above the fundamental value was a relatively rare phenomenon (see Figures S2 and S3), riding the bubble (in the context of our experimental setup) was clearly a suboptimal behavior, as demonstrated by the fact that those participants with high susceptibly to ride the bubble had significantly lower monetary earnings (p = 0.02), an effect due to only trading in bubble markets (nonbubble markets: p > 0.1; bubble markets: p = 0.005). Critically, low monetary earnings did not directly correlate with activity in vmPFC (p = 0.19), excluding the possibility that the correlation we identified in this region reflected increasing susceptibility to reduced earnings (independent of bubble susceptibility). Our next step was to investigate the mechanism causing the inflation in value representation observed in vmPFC during financial bubbles. The key difference between nonbubble markets and bubble markets is that in nonbubble markets, the value of a share is only determined by the fundamental value of the asset, while in bubble markets, profitable trading depends on accurately judging the intentions of other players in the market. Therefore, we hypothesized that the increase in value representation during a bubble market was a consequence of the fact that traders use inferences about the intentions and mental states of other agents to update their value representation. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that in our whole-brain analysis, together with increased activity in vmPFC, we isolated a network of brain regions that have previously been associated with theory of mind (Siegal and Varley, 2002Siegal M. Varley R. Neural systems involved in “theory of mind”.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 463-471PubMed Google Scholar, Frith and Frith, 2006Frith C.D. Frith U.

In particular, we focused on dmPFC because convergent evidence suggests that this region of the prefrontal cortex plays a primary role in human ability to make inferences about the mental states (including intentions) of other agents (Siegal and Varley, 2002Siegal M. Varley R. Neural systems involved in “theory of mind”.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 463-471PubMed Google Scholar, Amodio and Frith, 2006Amodio D.M. Frith C.D.

Neural correlates of mentalizing-related computations during strategic interactions in humans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 6741-6746Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a previous study has shown that in experimental financial markets, activity in this area correlates with participants’ ability to predict price changes in markets due the presence of informed insider traders in the market (Bruguier et al., 2010Bruguier A.J. Quartz S.R. Bossaerts P. Exploring the Nature of “Trader Intuition.”.J. Finance. 2010; 65: 1703-1723Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). If activity isolated in dmPFC during bubble markets reflected mentalizing ToM activity, then we would expect a measure of neural signal change in that region during bubble markets to be associated with individual-specific measures of ToM. To test this hypothesis further, we retested a subset of participants (n = 14) who had originally participated in the bubble experiment using an online version of the eye gaze test to assess their ToM skills (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001Baron-Cohen S. Wheelwright S. Hill J. Raste Y. Plumb I. The “Reading the Mind in the Eyes” Test revised version: a study with normal adults, and adults with Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism.J. Child Psychol. Psychiatry. 2001; 42: 241-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this task, participants looked at eye gazes and picked one of four terms that best described the mental state of the person whose eyes were shown (see Experimental Procedures). The task has correct answers, from which we constructed an index of the ToM ability of each participant. We then extracted the percentage of signal change in dmPFC in response to CPV during bubble markets (in the 8 mm sphere centered at [9, 50, 28]) for each subject and found a substantial correlation between that signal change and each subject’s ToM ability index (Spearman rank correlation coefficient ρ = 0.57; p < 0.05) (Figure 4). Critically, no significant correlation between dmPFC signal and the ToM index was found during nonbubble markets (ρ = 0.32; p > 0.1). Furthermore, we repeated the same analysis in vmPFC (in the 8 mm sphere centered at [3, 53, −2]), which showed that activity in vmPFC did not correlate with performance in the ToM task in either the bubble (ρ = 0.06; p > 0.5) or the nonbubble markets (ρ = 0.09; p > 0.5). Taken together, these findings supported our hypothesis that the increased activity in dmPFC that we isolated during the financial bubbles reflected a computation associated with the participants’ tendency to make inferences about the mental states of other players in the market. An intriguing possibility is that participants during the financial bubble, rather than mentalizing the intentions of individual players, would represent the whole market as an intentional agent in the attempt to forecast the future intentions of the market. Notably, unlike in vmPFC, activity in dmPFC isolated in this contrast did not correlate significantly (ρ = 0.009; p > 0.5) with the individual’s susceptibility to ride a financial bubble, as measured by the bubble susceptibility index. These results suggested that the neural circuit that modulated the value representation in vmPFC (associated with the behavioral susceptibility to ride a financial bubble) might be influenced by the social computations instantiated in dmPFC during the update of participants’ CPV. In order to test this hypothesis, we then conducted a psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis between vmPFC and dmPFC. This analysis revealed that the functional coupling between these two regions significantly increased during bubble markets (p < 0.001; Figure 5), suggesting that investors might update their portfolio profits in vmPFC by taking into account the intentions of the other players in the market. We therefore devised a model-based analysis to investigate this idea in more detail. To study how intentions modulate market traders’ computations, we studied how subjects inferred intentional agency from changes in the arrival of buy and sell orders. Recall that subjects see a fast-motion replay of all orders to buy (bids), and all orders to sell (asks), which were entered in the original behavioral experiments. Paying careful attention to this fine-grained sequence of buy and sell orders could form a basis for predicting trader intentions (a relative of sentiment in financial economics; Baker and Wurgler, 2007Baker M. Wurgler J. Investor sentiment in the stock market.J. Econ. Perspect. 2007; 21: 129-151Crossref Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). To translate this idea into a precise computational variable, we use a recent precise measure from financial theory. The intuitive idea is that the presence of strategic agents in a market can be inferred by a statistical change in the order arrival process, from a homogeneous Poisson process to a mixture process (where the arrival intensity switches randomly) (Easley et al., 1997Easley D. Kiefer N.M. O’Hara M. One Day in the Life of a Very Common Stock.Rev. Financ. Stud. 1997; 10: 805-835Crossref Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The idea is that any increase in trader information, or even a perception of such an increase, will change order arrival. For example, orders may arrive more rapidly as traders try to trade quickly before information leaks out, or orders may thin out as traders place orders more cautiously, afraid of being on the wrong end of a trade against a better-informed partner (Easley et al., 2002Easley D. Hvidkjaer S. O’Hara M. Is Information Risk a Determinant of Asset Returns?.J. Finance. 2002; 57: 2185-2221Crossref Scopus (787) Google Scholar). We therefore constructed a statistic that measured the dynamic of breaks in Poisson homogeneity during trading. We called this metric Poisson inhomogeneity detector (PID). PID is a statistic that increases as the evidence against a homogenous Poisson order arrival process increases over the recent past. Specifically, it tests whether the number of arrivals in the last interval of 9 s conforms to a Poisson distribution with fixed arrival intensity. This measure, first proposed and investigated by Brown and Zhao, 2002Brown L.D. Zhao L.H. A new test for the Poisson distribution.Sankhyā, the Indian Journal of Statistics, Series A. 2002; 64: 611-625Google Scholar, has good statistical power (in small samples) to reject the null hypothesis of homogenous arrival in favor of the alternative that the arrival rates obtain from Poisson distributions with different arrival rates across the M intervals. Letting xi denote the number of arrivals in interval i(i=1,…,M), andyi=(xi+38)1/2,(Equation 1) then the PID is defined asPID=4∑mi(y(i)−Y)2,(Equation 2) where Y equals the average (across M intervals) of the values of yi. Under the null hypothesis, PID approximately follows a χ2 distribution with M − 1 degrees of freedom. Taking M = 24, this means that the critical value corresponding to p = 0.05 is PID = 36. As PID grows, the evidence against the null hypothesis of no change in arrival rate increases (Figure 6A; Figure S4). Using this model, we were then able to construct a parametric regressor for each subject, measuring inferred intention over time. The regressor averaged the value of PID over the period in which the subject observed the arrival of asks and bids in the market (see Experimental Procedures). Critically, this parametric regressor was uncorrelated with either CPV (r = 0.06 ± 0.02) or the deviation in prices from the fundamental values (r = 0.001 ± 0.09). Changes in PID were then input as a parametric regressor in a general linear model to test whether activity in vmPFC and dmPFC showed a greater modulation to this metric during a contrast between bubble markets versus nonbubble markets (analogously to the"

Using a combination of electrophysiological, optical, and morphological circuit analysis tools, we find that layer II stellate cells are embedded in a dense local inhibitory microcircuit. Specifically, we report a gradient of inhibitory inputs along the dorsoventral axis of the MEC, with the majority of this local inhibition arising from parvalbumin positive (PV+) interneurons. Finally, the gradient of PV+ fibers is accompanied by a gradient in the power of extracellular network oscillations in the gamma range, measured both in vitro and in vivo. The reported differences in the inhibitory microcircuitry in layer II of the MEC may therefore have a profound functional impact on the computational working principles at different locations of the entorhinal network and influence the input pathways to the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2114104454,"Chagas disease, caused by the eukaryotic (protozoan) parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is an alarming emerging global health problem with no clinical drugs available to treat the chronic stage. Azole inhibitors of sterol 14α-demethylase (CYP51) were proven effective against Chagas, and antifungal drugs posaconazole and ravuconazole have entered clinical trials in Spain, Bolivia, and Argentina. Here we present the x-ray structures of T. cruzi CYP51 in complexes with two alternative drug candidates, pyridine derivatives (S)-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl)-2-(pyridin-3-yl)ethanone (UDO; Protein Data Bank code 3ZG2) and N-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-N-[1-[5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridyl]-4-piperi-dyl]pyridin-3-amine (UDD; Protein Data Bank code 3ZG3). These compounds have been developed by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) and are highly promising antichagasic agents in both cellular and in vivo experiments. The binding parameters and inhibitory effects on sterol 14α-demethylase activity in reconstituted enzyme reactions confirmed UDO and UDD as potent and selective T. cruzi CYP51 inhibitors. Comparative analysis of the pyridine- and azole-bound CYP51 structures uncovered the features that make UDO and UDD T. cruzi CYP51-specific. The structures suggest that although a precise fit between the shape of the inhibitor molecules and T. cruzi CYP51 active site topology underlies their high inhibitory potency, a longer coordination bond between the catalytic heme iron and the pyridine nitrogen implies a weaker influence of pyridines on the iron reduction potential, which may be the basis for the observed selectivity of these compounds toward the target enzyme versus other cytochrome P450s, including human drug-metabolizing P450s. These findings may pave the way for the development of novel CYP51-targeted drugs with optimized metabolic properties that are very much needed for the treatment of human infections caused by eukaryotic microbial pathogens."

As such, hGGT1 is expressed as a 569-amino acid propeptide that autocleaves into a large subunit (42 kDa, residues 1–380) and a small subunit (20 kDa, residues 381–569). The heterodimer localizes to the cell surface and is tethered to the plasma membrane by a single-pass transmembrane domain (residues 5–26) located at the N terminus of the large subunit. The same residue (Thr-381) that autocleaves the propeptide also serves as the catalytic nucleophile within the active site of the mature enzyme (20.Castonguay R. Halim D. Morin M. Furtos A. Lherbet C. Bonneil E. Thibault P. Keillor J.W.

Under physiological conditions, the primary reaction catalyzed by mammalian hGGT1 is the hydrolysis of γ-glutamyl amide bonds (2.Hanigan M.H. Ricketts W.A. Extracellular glutathione is a source of cysteine for cells that express γ-glutamyl transpeptidase.Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6302-6306Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 22.Elce J.S.

Characterization and physiological-function of rat renal γ-glutamyl-transpeptidase.Enzyme. 1979; 24: 383-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). hGGT1 cleaves the γ-glutamyl amide bond of all γ-glutamyl compounds that have been tested (5.Wickham S. West M.B. Cook P.F. Hanigan M.H. γ-Glutamyl compounds. Substrate specificity of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase enzymes.Anal. Biochem. 2011; 414: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The reaction is initiated by a nucleophilic attack by the side chain hydroxyl oxygen of Thr-381 on the γ-glutamyl amide bond. An acyl bond forms between the glutamate portion of the substrate (the δ-carbon of glutamate) and the γ-oxygen of the side chain of Thr-381 as the remainder of the substrate is released. The subsequent hydrolysis of the acyl bond releases glutamate and is the rate-limiting step of the reaction. hGGT1 can also catalyze a transpeptidation reaction in solutions with high concentrations of dipeptides and some amino acids (24.Thompson G.A. Meister A. Hydrolysis and transfer reactions catalyzed by γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. Evidence for separate substrate sites and for high affinity of l-cystine.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 71: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the transpeptidation reaction, the γ-glutamyl group bound to Thr-381 is transferred to the α-nitrogen of a dipeptide acceptor, thereby forming a new γ-glutamyl compound. The hydrolysis and transpeptidation reactions proceed by a modified ping-pong mechanism (25.Allison R.D. γ-Glutamyl transpeptidase. Kinetics and mechanism.Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 419-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 26.Taniguchi N. Ikeda Y. γ-Glutamyl transpeptidase. Catalytic mechanism and gene expression.Adv.

Crystal structures have been reported for one archaeal (Thermoplasma acidophilum; PDB code 2i3o) and four bacterial (Escherichia coli, Helicobacter pylori, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus halodurans) GGTs (27.Morrow A.L.

Among these structures, GGT from E. coli (EcGGT; P18956) has the highest amino acid sequence homology to hGGT1 (P19440), with 32% (172 of 533 residues) identity, 53% (280 of 533 residues) similarity, and 4% (20 of 533 residues) gaps (Fig. 1). Despite these similarities, hGGT1 differs from bacterial GGTs in several ways. For example, hGGT1 catalyzes both a hydrolysis and a transpeptidation reaction (16.Wickham S. Regan N. West M.B. Kumar V.P. Thai J. Li P.K. Cook P.F. Hanigan M.H. Divergent effects of compounds on the hydrolysis and transpeptidation reactions of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase.J. Enzyme Inhib. Med.

This suggests that the binding pocket surrounding the active site of hGGT1 differs from the binding pockets in the bacterial GGTs in a manner that is not readily discernible from sequence alignments between the primary structures of these orthologs. Furthermore, hGGT1 is a type II membrane protein tethered to the cell surface by a single-pass transmembrane domain, whereas GGTs in bacteria are untethered and localize to the periplasmic space (30.Suzuki H.

Finally, hGGT1 has different requirements for autocleavage compared with bacterial GGTs. hGGT1 has seven N-glycosylation sites, and proper folding and autocleavage of the propeptide requires co-translational N-glycosylation (35.West M.B.

Two cysteines (Cys-50 and Cys-74) are conserved in the large subunit of all eukaryotic GGT1s and are required for efficient autocleavage of hGGT1 (38.Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Bruns J.B.

These differences in protein maturation and function reflect distinct structural features of hGGT1. To improve our understanding of the structure of hGGT1, we have innovatively crystallized the soluble ectodomain (residues 28–569) of deglycosylated hGGT1 and determined its x-ray crystal structure to a resolution of 1.67 Å. Analysis of this active form of the enzyme has provided new insights into the folding, autocleavage, and kinetic activity of hGGT1 and revealed many key structural differences between the human and bacterial GGTs. These structural differences (a) underscore the differences in the catalytic behavior of these orthologous enzymes and (b) explain the difficulties in drug design based upon homology models of hGGT1 derived from the bacterial crystal structures. This new information will serve as an essential launching point for the structure-based design of hGGT1 inhibitors with enhanced therapeutic efficacy. We developed a yeast recombinant system for the expression of hGGT1. To express the soluble ectodomain of the enzyme, the transmembrane domain (residues 1–27) was omitted and replaced with a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease-cleavable polyhistidine tag. The N-terminal His6-tagged hGGT1 (P19440; amino acids 28–569) open reading frame was integrated into the genome of the Pichia pastoris strain X-33 (15.King J.B. West M.B. Cook P.F. Hanigan M.H. A novel, species-specific class of uncompetitive inhibitors of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9059-9065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Two 40-ml volumes of BMGY medium (Invitrogen) containing 100 μg ml−1 of Zeocin were inoculated with the transformed X-33 strain and cultured at 30 °C to high density overnight at 250 rpm. These cultures were used to inoculate two 1.5-liter volumes of BMGY medium and were then propagated without an antibiotic at 30 °C until a final A600 of 15 was achieved. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 10 min, and the cell pellets were resuspended in two 1.5-liter volumes of pH 7.4 BMMY medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% casamino acids and 1% methanol to induce expression of the recombinant hGGT1 enzyme. The cells were induced for 112 h with shaking (250 rpm) at 30 °C and the addition of 1% methanol at 24 and 72 h to sustain induction. The cells were harvested at 1500 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatants contained the secreted hGGT1. The supernatants were pooled and filtered through 0.22-μm polyethersulfone bottle top filters (Corning), and the 3 liters of filtrate was concentrated 10-fold. The buffer was changed to binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl) by tangential flow filtration using a Pellicon PLCTK cassette with a size exclusion cut-off of 30 kDa (Millipore). The resulting 300 ml of diafiltered medium was supplemented with imidazole to 10 mm and loaded onto Ni-NTA resin (PerfectPro; 1 ml of resin/liter of culture). The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of wash buffer (10 mm imidazole, 25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl), and the tagged protein was eluted with elution buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole). Eluate fractions were assayed for GGT activity as described previously (15.King J.B. West M.B. Cook P.F. Hanigan M.H. A novel, species-specific class of uncompetitive inhibitors of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9059-9065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The active fractions (∼20 mg of total protein) were combined and dialyzed against 4 liters of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and 30 mm NaCl. The dialysate was then incubated with 300 mega units of Endo Hf (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 18 h to remove all but the basal N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue from the enzyme. The deglycosylated hGGT1 pool was dialyzed against 4 liters of 25 mm HEPES (pH 8.0) and 100 mm NaCl buffer at 4 °C, and the dialysate was subjected to Ni-NTA purification as described above to remove the cleaved glycans and Endo Hf. The hGGT1-containing fractions were dialyzed against 4 liters of TEV cleavage buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. 150 μg of His6-tagged TEV protease was added at 4 °C for 20 h to cleave the hexahistidine tag. TEV-cleaved hGGT1 was separated from the hexahistidine tag and the His-tagged TEV protease by passage over a third Ni-NTA column. The untagged, deglycosylated hGGT1 was then dialyzed at 4 °C against 4 liters of 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, and concentrated at 4 °C in a Centriprep concentrator (YM-30, Amicon) to a final concentration of ∼20 mg ml−1. The concentrated protein stock was stored at 4 °C until used for crystallization. Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion with the hanging drop method. The protein stock solution was diluted to 5 mg ml−1 with 50 mm Na-HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide, and 0.5 mm Na-EDTA, pH 8.0. The crystallization drops were assembled by mixing 2 μl of protein solution with 2.0 μl of double-distilled H2O and 1.5 μl of reservoir solution. The crystals appeared in 1–4 weeks at room temperature over reservoir solutions containing 15–25% PEG 3350, 200 mm ammonium chloride, 0.5 mm l-glutamate, and 200 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.0, or Na-HEPES, pH 7.5. Similar crystals appeared in either sitting or hanging drops. The crystals were enlarged by adding to the reservoir 10 μl of 100% PEG 400 once and 10 μl of 50% glycerol five times during 2 weeks. The best diffracting crystals (500 × 100 × 30 μm) were isolated from clusters of thin plates. Crystals were cryoprotected by rapid passage through drops made by mixing 1.3 μl of 50% (w/v) PEG 1550 and 0.7 μl of reservoir solution supplemented with glutamate to a final concentration of 10 mm in the cryo drop. X-ray (λ = 1.1 Å) diffraction data were collected at 100 K at beam line X25 of the National Synchrotron Light Source. The x-ray diffraction data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with XDS (40.Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11225) Google Scholar). The structure was determined by molecular replacement using MOLREP (41.Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Molecular replacement with MOLREP.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2057573148,"In humans, numbers of circulating naive T cells strongly decline in the morning, which was suggested to be mediated by cortisol, inducing a CXCR4 up-regulation with a subsequent extravasation of the cells. As a systematic evaluation of this assumption is lacking, we investigated in two human placebo-controlled studies the effects of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist mifepristone (200 mg orally at 23:00) and of suppressing endogenous cortisol with metyrapone (1 g orally at 04:00) on temporal changes in CXCR4 expression and numbers of different T-cell subsets using flow cytometry. Mifepristone attenuated, and metyrapone completely blocked, the morning increase in CXCR4 expression on naive T cells. In parallel, both substances also hindered the decline in naive T-cell numbers with this effect, however, being less apparent after mifepristone. We identified, and confirmed in additional in vitro studies, a partial agonistic GR effect of mifepristone at night (i.e., between 02:00 and 03:30) that could explain the lower antagonistic efficacy of the substance on CXCR4 expression and naive T-cell counts. CXCR4 expression emerged to be a most sensitive marker of GR signaling. Our studies jointly show that endogenous cortisol, specifically via GR activation, causes the morning increase in CXCR4 expression and the subsequent extravasation of naive T cells, thus revealing an important immunological function of the morning cortisol rise."

MBOAT proteins contain a highly conserved asparagine (Asn-307 in GOAT) and an invariant histidine (His-338 in GOAT) separated by 30–45 residues; these residues have been proposed to be catalytic. There are two additional regions of conservation in the family, at the N- and C-terminal boundaries of loop 5 on GOAT, where it adjoins surrounding hydrophobic regions. The topology of a few MBOATs has been analyzed, and the invariant histidine has been shown to be lumenal in these cases (27.Pagac M. de la Mora H.V. Duperrex C. Roubaty C. Vionnet C. Conzelmann A.

Based on the modification of lumenal, secreted proteins and on lumenal location of the conserved histidine, the active site for the MBOAT family has been proposed to be conserved on the lumenal face (2.Yang J.

Detailed studies of catalysis by these purified enzymes is generally hindered by the challenge of solubilization in active conformations (32.Yang J. Zhao T.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

Chem. 2008; 283: 22076-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In contrast to other MBOAT members, for HHAT, some catalytic activity was retained upon alanine mutation of the conserved histidine (37.Buglino J.A. Resh M.D. Identification of conserved regions and residues within Hedgehog acyltransferase critical for palmitoylation of Sonic Hedgehog.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e11195Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, the assignment of this histidine as catalytic is not yet definitive. GOAT octanoylates serine-3 of proghrelin in the ER lumen after signal peptide cleavage. A range of fatty acids can be processed by GOAT, and the most likely acyl donors are acyl-CoAs (reviewed in Ref. 34.Taylor M.S. Hwang Y. Hsiao P.Y. Boeke J.D. Cole P.A. Ghrelin O-acyltransferase assays and inhibition.Methods Enzymol. 2012; 514: 205-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because fatty acyl-CoAs are known to be cytosolic (e.g. those produced during fatty acid β-oxidation), the ER membrane represents a barrier that these acyl-CoAs must cross. In this regard, GOAT has been postulated to be a possible acyl-CoA transporter (2.Yang J. Brown M.S. Liang G. Grishin N.V. Goldstein J.L. Identification of the acyltransferase that octanoylates ghrelin, an appetite-stimulating peptide hormone.Cell. 2008; 132: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Determination of the topology of GOAT is a critical step to defining its detailed structure and mechanisms. GOAT has been proposed to contain eight transmembrane helices (TMs) (2.Yang J. Brown M.S. Liang G. Grishin N.V. Goldstein J.L. Identification of the acyltransferase that octanoylates ghrelin, an appetite-stimulating peptide hormone.Cell. 2008; 132: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar), but this has not been experimentally investigated. In this study, we examine GOAT topology in detail, first computationally and then experimentally. Our data suggest that GOAT contains 11 TMs and segregate the invariant His-338 and conserved Asn-307 to opposite sides of the ER membrane. Photocross-linking binding studies map the binding of acyl ghrelin analogs to the C-terminal region of GOAT and demonstrate that purified GOAT can bind ligand as a monomer. All reagents were purchased at the highest quality available from Sigma-Aldrich or Acros Organics unless otherwise indicated. Commercially available reagents were used without further purification. GOAT sequences were identified using BLASTp. Annotation of chicken GOAT was corrected to include the first exon. Dog and green anole (Anolis carolinensis) GOAT sequences were identified by megaBLAST and tBLASTx searches from their draft genomes and annotated. Sequences were aligned using MUSCLE (38.Edgar R.C. MUSCLE. Multiple sequence alignment with high accuracy and high throughput.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1792-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (30229) Google Scholar). Conserved domains and residues were identified using CDD (39.Marchler-Bauer A. Zheng C. Chitsaz F. Derbyshire M.K. Geer L.Y. Geer R.C. Gonzales N.R. Gwadz M. Hurwitz D.I. Lanczycki C.J. Lu F. Lu S.

A battery of topology prediction servers were queried with GOAT sequences from various organisms, starting with mouse and human sequences. A multiple sequence alignment was submitted wherever possible. Older methods, such as TMHMM version 2.0 (40.Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L.

Improving the accuracy of transmembrane protein topology prediction using evolutionary information.Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) gave very different results from species to species, even between the highly conserved human and mouse GOATs; the range was from 4 to 11 TMs. The consensus prediction servers TOPCONS (45.Bernsel A.

However, for GOAT, the results from both servers were similarly inconsistent between species and thus hard to interpret. HMMtop (47.Tusnády G.E. Simon I. The HMMTOP transmembrane topology prediction server.Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 849-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar) and PolyPhobius (48.Käll L. Krogh A. Sonnhammer E.L. Advantages of combined transmembrane topology and signal peptide prediction. The Phobius web server.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: W429-W432Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar) can use a multiple sequence alignment as input. Although this improved the results somewhat as compared with the aforementioned algorithms, these algorithms predict only seven and eight TMs, respectively. Both missed TMs predicted by MemBrain and MEMSAT-SVM that were subsequently validated experimentally. MemBrain and MEMSAT-SVM predictions were used as a basis for our study and are discussed under “Results.” For MemBrain, predictions for each organism were overlaid on the multiple-species alignment, and TM propensity plots were overlaid and aligned. HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. Transfections were done using Fugene 6 or Fugene HD (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with 2 μg of GOAT DNA and 6 μl of reagent per 35-mm dish or well of a 6-well plate. SF9 cells were maintained in ISFM medium, an affordable serum-free synthetic medium, made as reported in (49.Inlow D. Shauger A. Maiorella B.

N- and C-terminal tags were placed immediately before the first or after the last residue of GOAT without any extraneous sequence by incorporating tag sequences into oligonucleotide primers. Internally V5-tagged GOAT clones were prepared using fusion PCR (50.Yon J. Fried M. Precise gene fusion by PCR.Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Individual point mutants were made using a modified QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). Asn-free and Lys-free GOAT were made in one round of polymerization using MISO mutagenesis, as described in Fig. 2a of a previous study (51.Mitchell L.A. Cai Y. Taylor M. Noronha A.M. Chuang J. Dai L. Boeke J.D. ACS Synth. Biol. 2013; 2: 473-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), as were V5Glyc clones. N-terminal deletion ΔN-H1 starts with a Met at residue 32. ΔN-H1-2, ΔN-H1-3, and ΔN-H1-3 constructs start with Met-56 and ATG codons substituted at positions 81 and 109, respectively, to define the first residue of the constructs. ΔC-H10-11 and ΔC-H11 are truncated after residues 357 and 399, respectively. N-IBV-1-GOAT and N-IBV-2-GOAT are GOAT-3xFLAG with an N-terminal fusion of the first 20 and 10 residues, respectively, of the M glycoprotein from infectious bronchitis virus (IBV; an avian coronavirus). Asn-3 and Asn-6 of this sequence are glycosylated in IBV-M, previously called the E1 protein (52.Swift A.M. Machamer C. A Golgi retention signal in a membrane-spanning domain of coronavirus E1 protein.J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). All clones were fully sequence-verified. Baculovirus constructs were made using the Bac2Bac system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 200,000 HeLa cells were plated on glass coverslips, transfected 8–16 h after plating, and incubated for 40 h. For complete permeabilization, cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and fixative was then quenched using PBS containing 10 mm glycine and 0.2% sodium azide (PBS/gly). Cells were incubated for 3 min in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS/gly and then washed twice with PBS/gly. For selective permeabilization, dishes were placed on ice, washed with ice-cold KHM (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate), and kept on ice. The cells were permeabilized with 75 μg/ml digitonin (EMD Biosciences) in KHM for 10 min. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold KHM, moved to room temperature, and fixed as above. Staining with primary and secondary antibodies was carried out for 20 min at room temperature by inverting coverslips onto Parafilm containing 45-μl drops of PBS/gly supplemented with 1% BSA and appropriate antibodies. Antibodies used were mouse anti-FLAG M2 (1:500; Sigma), rabbit anti-FLAG (1:1000; Sigma F7425), mouse anti-V5 (1:5000; Invitrogen), mouse anti-Myc 9E10 (1 μg/ml), rabbit anti-GFP (1:500; Molecular Probes), mouse anti-GFP (1:500; Roche Applied Science 11814460001), and rabbit anti-SSR1 (2 μg/ml; Sigma HPA011276; recognizes residues 230–286). Coverslips were washed and incubated analogously with secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:1000) and Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000). As controls, untransfected cells were stained identically, and primary antibodies were omitted. DNA was stained prior to imaging with Hoechst 33285 (0.1 μg/ml, 5 min), and coverslips were mounted using glycerol with 100 mm N-propyl gallate. Epifluorescent images were collected at room temperature using an Axioscop microscope with ×63 and ×40 objectives (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped for epifluorescence using an ORCA-03G CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Japan) and iVision software (BioVision). For equal comparison of staining between permeabilizations, within each construct, for each antibody, an optimal exposure time was first determined, and then this fixed exposure time was used for both perme"
https://openalex.org/W2045060921,"Recent studies link synaptojanin 1 (synj1), the main phosphoinositol (4,5)-biphosphate phosphatase (PI(4,5)P2-degrading enzyme) in the brain and synapses, to Alzheimer disease. Here we report a novel mechanism by which synj1 reversely regulates cellular clearance of amyloid-β (Aβ). Genetic down-regulation of synj1 reduces both extracellular and intracellular Aβ levels in N2a cells stably expressing the Swedish mutant of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Moreover, synj1 haploinsufficiency in an Alzheimer disease transgenic mouse model expressing the Swedish mutant APP and the presenilin-1 mutant ΔE9 reduces amyloid plaque load, as well as Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels in hippocampus of 9-month-old animals. Reduced expression of synj1 attenuates cognitive deficits in these transgenic mice. However, reduction of synj1 does not affect levels of full-length APP and the C-terminal fragment, suggesting that Aβ generation by β- and γ-secretase cleavage is not affected. Instead, synj1 knockdown increases Aβ uptake and cellular degradation through accelerated delivery to lysosomes. These effects are partially dependent upon elevated PI(4,5)P2 with synj1 down-regulation. In summary, our data suggest a novel mechanism by which reduction of a PI(4,5)P2-degrading enzyme, synj1, improves amyloid-induced neuropathology and behavior deficits through accelerating cellular Aβ clearance."
https://openalex.org/W2113266091,"Natalizumab antibody to α4-integrins is used in therapy of multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease. A crystal structure of the Fab bound to an α4 integrin β-propeller and thigh domain fragment shows that natalizumab recognizes human-mouse differences on the circumference of the β-propeller domain. The epitope is adjacent to but outside of a ligand-binding groove formed at the interface with the β-subunit βI domain and shows no difference in structure when bound to Fab. Competition between Fab and the ligand vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) for binding to cell surface α4β1 shows noncompetitive antagonism. In agreement, VCAM docking models suggest that binding of domain 1 of VCAM to α4-integrins is unimpeded by the Fab, and that bound Fab requires a change in orientation between domains 1 and 2 of VCAM for binding to α4β1. Mapping of species-specific differences onto α4β1 and α4β7 shows that their ligand-binding sites are highly conserved. Skewing away from these conserved regions of the epitopes recognized by current therapeutic function-blocking antibodies has resulted in previously unanticipated mechanisms of action."
https://openalex.org/W2043776590,"Diapycnal mixing (across density surfaces) is an important process in the global ocean overturning circulation. Mixing in the interior of most of the ocean, however, is thought to have a magnitude just one-tenth of that required to close the global circulation by the downward mixing of less dense waters. Some of this deficit is made up by intense near-bottom mixing occurring in restricted 'hot-spots' associated with rough ocean-floor topography, but it is not clear whether the waters at mid-depth, 1,000 to 3,000 metres, are returned to the surface by cross-density mixing or by along-density flows. Here we show that diapycnal mixing of mid-depth (∼1,500 metres) waters undergoes a sustained 20-fold increase as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current flows through the Drake Passage, between the southern tip of South America and Antarctica. Our results are based on an open-ocean tracer release of trifluoromethyl sulphur pentafluoride. We ascribe the increased mixing to turbulence generated by the deep-reaching Antarctic Circumpolar Current as it flows over rough bottom topography in the Drake Passage. Scaled to the entire circumpolar current, the mixing we observe is compatible with there being a southern component to the global overturning in which about 20 sverdrups (1 Sv = 10(6) m(3) s(-1)) upwell in the Southern Ocean, with cross-density mixing contributing a significant fraction (20 to 30 per cent) of this total, and the remainder upwelling along constant-density surfaces. The great majority of the diapycnal flux is the result of interaction with restricted regions of rough ocean-floor topography."
https://openalex.org/W2071683264,"Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins that form a pervasive family of proteins conserved in yeast, plants, and humans. The plant PPR proteins are grouped mainly into the P and PLS classes. Here, we report the crystal structure of a PLS-class PPR protein from Arabidopsis thaliana called THA8L (THA8-like) at 2.0 Å. THA8L resembles THA8 (thylakoid assembly 8), a protein that is required for the splicing of specific group II introns of genes involved in biogenesis of chloroplast thylakoid membranes. The THA8L structure contains three P-type PPR motifs flanked by one L-type motif and one S-type motif. We identified several putative THA8L-binding sites, enriched with purine sequences, in the group II introns. Importantly, THA8L has strong binding preference for single-stranded RNA over single-stranded DNA or double-stranded RNA. Structural analysis revealed that THA8L contains two extensive patches of positively charged residues next to the residues that are proposed to comprise the RNA-binding codes. Mutations in these two positively charged patches greatly reduced THA8L RNA-binding activity. On the basis of these data, we constructed a model of THA8L-RNA binding that is dependent on two forces: one is the interaction between nucleotide bases and specific amino acids in the PPR motifs (codes), and the other is the interaction between the negatively charged RNA backbone and positively charged residues of PPR motifs. Together, these results further our understanding of the mechanism of PPR protein-RNA interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2026344731,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an essential player in the development of multiple organs during embryonic and postnatal stages. To understand its role in epiphyseal cartilage development, we generated transgenic mice with conditionally inactivated EGFR in chondrocytes. Postnatally, these mice exhibited a normal initiation of cartilage canals at the perichondrium, but the excavation of these canals into the cartilage was strongly suppressed, resulting in a delay in the formation of the secondary ossification center (SOC). This delay was accompanied by normal chondrocyte hypertrophy but decreased mineralization and apoptosis of hypertrophic chondrocytes and reduced osteoclast number at the border of marrow space. Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that inactivation of chondrocyte-specific EGFR signaling reduced the amounts of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP9, -13, and -14) and RANKL (receptor activator of NF-κB ligand) in the hypertrophic chondrocytes close to the marrow space and decreased the cartilage matrix degradation in the SOC. Analyses of EGFR downstream signaling pathways in primary epiphyseal chondrocytes revealed that up-regulation of MMP9 and RANKL by EGFR signaling was partially mediated by the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway, whereas EGFR-enhanced MMP13 expression was not. Further biochemical studies suggested that EGFR signaling stimulates the phosphorylation of LRP6, increases active β-catenin level, and induces its nuclear translocation. In line with these in vitro studies, deficiency in chondrocyte-specific EGFR activity reduced β-catenin amount in hypertrophic chondrocytes in vivo.

Nonprotective antibodies are directed against epitopes whose ligation does not interfere with viral attachment or entry. Moreover, the poor immunogenic nature of conserved neutralizing determinants requires immune engineering to present or re-surface those epitopes to focus B cell responses away from immunodominant regions toward the conserved neutralizing determinants.

Med. 2013; 210: 241-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The immunogenicity of an epitope is dependent upon its context in a protein. Mutations in one segment can redirect B cell responses toward otherwise weakly immunogenic regions (20.Chiesa M.D. Martensen P.M. Simmons C. Porakishvili N. Justesen J. Dougan G. Roitt I.M. Delves P.J. Lund T. Refocusing of B-cell responses following a single amino acid substitution in an antigen.Immunology. 2001; 103: 172-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the functionality of antibodies induced by West Nile virus is also strongly influenced by the quaternary structure of viral antigens, suggesting that the nature of the epitope in the native protein is key for interaction with B cell receptors (BCRs) (21.Zlatkovic J.

Although antigenicity has been previously predicted based on hydrophilicity, mobility of backbone atoms, accessibility, topology, and protein flexibility (see Refs. 22.Geysen H.M. Tainer J.A.

Therefore, although the discipline of protein design is rapidly evolving, knowledge of the physicochemical and structural properties that determine antigen immunogenicity coupled with complementary experimental approaches needs to be obtained. To date, no thorough examination has been performed at both molecular and immunological levels to assess quantitative and/or qualitative differences in immunogenicity. Here, we investigate the influence of antigenic structure on vaccine-induced antibody responses using the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of the HIV-1 gp41 subunit as a model antigen. The MPER is a highly conserved tryptophan-rich hydrophobic segment (residues 662–683, according to HxB2 numbering) important for viral fusion (24.Salzwedel K. West J.T. Hunter E. A conserved tryptophan-rich motif in the membrane-proximal region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp41 ectodomain is important for Env-mediated fusion and virus infectivity.J.

Unlike many BNAbs binding to discontinuous epitopes, the 2F5, 4E10, 10E8, and Z13el BNAbs recognize juxtaposed linear epitope residues in the MPER (25.Cardoso R.M. Zwick M.B. Stanfield R.L. Kunert R.

HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibody extracts its epitope from a kinked gp41 ectodomain region on the viral membrane.Immunity. 2008; 28: 52-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In this study, we show how the membrane orientation of the MPER segment per se significantly impacts immunogenicity, including epitope immunodominance. Our observations have implications for therapeutic and preventive vaccine design. Various MPER sequences were synthesized according to standard procedures on an ABI 431 Peptide Synthesizer using Fmoc chemistry as follows: synthesis of HxB2 Npalm-MPER (ELDKWASLWNWFNITNWLWYIK), 089CON Npalm-MPER (ALDSWKNLWSWFSITNWLWYIK), and PB7 Npalm-MPER(ALDKWNSLWSWFDITKWLWYIK) from Tufts University (Boston, MA) and HxB2 MPER-Cpalm (ELDKWASLWNWFNITNWLWYIK), MPERkk-Cpalm (ELDKWASLWNWFNITNWLWYIKKK), and MPER-TM(ELDKWASLWNWFNITNWLWYIKIFIIIVGGLVGLRIVFAVLSIV) from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge, MA). HPLC purification was performed on a reverse phase C18 or C5 column. Palmitic acid was conjugated to the N terminus of MPER (Npalm-MPER) overnight using the standard 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium activation. To synthesize MPER coupled with palmitic acid at the C terminus (MPER-Cpalm), lysine pre-modified with palmitic acid at ϵ-amine (Fmoc-Lys(palmitoyl)-OH; Bachem, Torrance, CA) was used during peptide synthesis. To prepare standard liposomes, lipids in chloroform (typical lipid composition: 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC)/1,2-di-(9Z-octadecenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol)(DOPG)/1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000])/monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA)/MPER) or palmitoylated MPER = 72:18:10:0.4:0.5 molar ratio (lipids from Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL, and MPLA from Sigma) were dispensed to glass vials, and the organic solvents were evaporated under vacuum overnight, resulting in dried thin lipid films. The lipid films were rehydrated with 1 mg/ml of LACK-1 (SPSLEHPIVVSGSWD) CD4 helper peptides at a lipid concentration of 20 mg/ml in PBS for 1 h with rigorous vortexing every 10 min, subjected to six freeze-thawing cycles (freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing at 60 °C), and then sonicated (Misonix Microson XL probe tip sonicator, Farmingdale, NY) in alternating power cycles of 12 and 3 watts in 30-s intervals for 5 min on ice. In some experiments, MPER was loaded only on the external surface of liposomes by simply mixing MPER with liposomes pre-formed in the absence of MPER in a molar ratio of 1:100 = MPER/total lipid. In some experiments, the liposomes were extruded 11 times through polycarbonate membranes with 50-, 100-, 200-, or 400-nm pores. To synthesize liposomes encapsulating PADRE (AKXVAAWTLKAAA, where X is cyclohexylalanine) instead of LACK-1, PADRE was loaded in liposomes by the standard procedure of remote loading using ammonium sulfate gradient (30.Haran G. Cohen R. Bar L.K. Barenholz Y. Transmembrane ammonium sulfate gradients in liposomes produce efficient and stable entrapment of amphipathic weak bases.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1151: 201-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). The average size of standard liposomes used in immunization studies was 77 ± 12 nm with polydispersity index of 0.17 ± 0.093 as determined by dynamic light scattering using a 90Plus/ZetaPals particle size analyzer (Brookhaven Instruments). Lipids were mixed in chloroform and dried as thin films under a nitrogen gas stream. To remove residual organic solvent, the lipid films were further dried by vacuum pump for ≈16 h. The lipids were resuspended in 20 mm HEPES and 150 mm KCl, pH 7.0, and subjected to 10–15 freeze-thaw cycles, followed by extrusion 15 times through two sheets of polycarbonate membrane with a pore size of 100 nm (Avanti Polar Lipids). Vesicles with virion membrane mimic were prepared at the molar ratio 9:18:20:9:45 of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine/sphingomyelin/dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine/dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol/cholesterol (Avanti Polar Lipids). 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylglycerol large unilamellar vesicles at a 4:1 molar ratio were used for EPR power saturation measurements. 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/1,2-dioleoyl-snglycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) (DOPC/DOPG) large unilamellar vesicles at a 4:1 ratio were used for BIAcore analysis. The EPR experiments were carried out as described previously (31.Song L. Sun Z.Y. Coleman K.E. Zwick M.B. Gach J.S. Wang J.H. Reinherz E.L. Wagner G. Kim M. Broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibodies disrupt a hinge-related function of gp41 at the membrane interface.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 9057-9062Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To obtain EPR signals, peptides containing single cysteine substitutions were labeled with (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5,-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl)-methanethiosulfonate (Toronto Research Chemicals (Ontario, Canada)) as follows. 5 mg of synthetic peptides were dissolved in 150 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Spin labeling was then performed by adding 3–5-fold excess of (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5,-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl)-methanethiosulfonate and incubating ∼16 h at room temperature. Peptides were purified and separated from free spin labels by reverse phase HPLC using a C4 or C5 column (Sigma). EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker EMX spectrometer (Billerica, MA) at 2-milliwatt incident microwave power with a field modulation of 1.0–2.0 G at 100 kHz using a Bruker high sensitivity resonator. To measure immersion depths, solvent accessibility and power saturation measurements were performed on a loop-gap resonator (Molecular Specialties, Milwaukee, WI) with microwave power varied from 0.4 to 100 milliwatts. Samples were placed in gas-permeable TPX tubes (Molecular Specialties) and purged by either a stream of air or nitrogen gas. The immersion depth values were calculated by the ratio of the accessibility values of O2 to 50 mm nickel(II) ethylenediaminediacetic acid. Depth standard curves were determined using lipid vesicles containing trace amounts of spin-labeled lipids (1:500 by weight) as described (29.Sun Z.Y. Oh K.J. Kim M. Yu J. Brusic V. Song L. Qiao Z.

NMR structural determination of HxB2, Con089A, and PB7 MPER peptides in dodecylphosphocholine micelles was carried out as described previously (29.Sun Z.Y. Oh K.J. Kim M. Yu J. Brusic V. Song L.

Backbone amide and carbon chemical shift assignments for MPERTM peptide in lyso-myristoylphosphatidylglycerol micelles were completed using a 1 mm 15N-13C double-labeled sample with conventional NMR triple-resonance experiment data obtained on a Bruker (Billerica, MA) 750-MHz spectrometer. The preliminary MPERTM structural model was constructed using the software CYANA (32.Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. Protein NMR structure determination with automated NOE assignment using the new software CANDID and the torsion angle dynamics algorithm DYANA.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar), based on three-dimensional 15N NOESY data and backbone dihedral angles predicted by software TALOS+ (33.Shen Y. Delaglio F.

A 96-well plate is coated with 50 μl of MPER peptide (2 μg/ml) or streptavidin (2 μg/ml) (Sigma S0677) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight. The plates were washed with PBS containing 0.1% BSA three times and then blocked with 100 μl of 1% BSA in PBS/well at room temperature for 3 h. After incubation with 50 μl of biotinylated MPER peptides diluted in PBS, 1% BSA at 2 μg/ml for 2 h at room temperature, and an additional 2 h at 4 °C, pre- and post-immune sera serially diluted in PBS, 1% BSA were added to the plate for overnight incubation. The next day, the plates were washed three times with PBS, 0.1% BSA and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. These plates were then washed four times with PBS and developed with 50 μl of 3,3-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (SureBlue Reserve, Gaithersburg, MD)/well. The HRP reaction was stopped with 50 μl of 1 m HCl/well, and the well absorbance was determined at 490 nm. MPER-specific monoclonal antibodies were produced by fusion of murine myeloma cells (NS0 BCL2) with mesenteric lymph node cells from a mouse immunized with Npalm-7-MPER/liposome. Briefly, mice were immunized with Npalm-7-MPER/liposome three times every 3 weeks apart. 4 days after final immunization, mesenteric lymph nodes were isolated, and a single cell suspension was obtained. Electrofusion was carried out with the ratio of one mesenteric lymph node cell to two myeloma fusion partners, and the fused cell suspension was placed in culture at 1000 cells/well in 96-well plates (34.Yu X. McGraw P.A. House F.S. Crowe Jr., J.E. An optimized electrofusion-based protocol for generating virus-specific human monoclonal antibodies.J. Immunol. Methods. 2008; 336: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Twelve days after fusion, we harvested supernatants and screened for MPER reactivity by ELISA. The MPER-reactive wells were initially subcloned at 10 cells/well and followed by 3 cells/well and then 0.3 cells/well. The anti-MPER monoclonal antibodies were purified from supernatants of the subcloned hybridoma using protein G column. BALB/c mice were purchased from Taconic and housed in the Vivarium at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Animal Core Facility. Animals were studied under a protocol approved by the Animal Use and Care Committee of Dana Farber Cancer Institute. Mice (four or five animals per immunogen group) were immunized in the flanks of both thighs intradermally three times every 3–4 weeks with 50 μl/injection of MPER/liposome vaccine at the concentration of 20 mg/ml. Serum samples were collected 10 days after each immunization and stored at −20 °C until use. To analyze the distribution of MPER and liposomes in draining lymph nodes, C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed 2 and 24 h after intradermal injection of rhodamine-labeled liposomes containing either FITC-labeled MPER peptide or FITC-labeled MPER peptide covalently attached to palmitic acid at the C terminus (50-μl injection at 20 mg/ml). Fluorophore-labeled liposomes were prepared from lipid films containing rhodamine-labeled 2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl) and the standard lipid components in a 0.2:100 molar ratio, and rhodamine-liposome was mixed with FITC-labeled MPER peptides at 100:1 molar ratio. Inguinal lymph nodes were removed and embedded in TissueTek OCT compound (Fisher) by flash-freezing in 2-methylbutane chilled with liquid nitrogen. Sections (5 μm) were prepared using a cryostat and positively charged slides. After air-drying for 2 h, sections were fixed with 1:1 acetone/methanol for 10 min at −20 °C. Sections were blocked for 15 min with PBS containing 0.5% BSA, 5 μg/ml Fc block (BD Biosciences), and 5% rat serum. Sections were then labeled with biotin B220 and APC-conjugated TCRβ monoclonal antibodies (eBioscience). Biotinylated antibodies were detected with AlexaFluor 405-conjugated streptavidin (Invitrogen). Slides were then cover-slipped with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech) and left to dry overnight. Sections were imaged using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope (×10 objective, NA, 0.4; ×100 objective with oil, NA, 1.4) with LAS AF (version 2.6.0) software. Images were processed and merged in Adobe Photoshop. BIAcore experiments were carried out with a BIAcore 3000 with the Pioneer L1 sensor chip at 25 °C. Data analyses were performed using BIAevaluation 3.1 software (BIAcore). The running buffer was 20 mm HEPES containing 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4 (HBS-N). The DOPC/DOPG liposome (30 μl, 150–250 μm) was applied to the sensor chip surface at a flow rate of 3 μl/min, and the liposomes were captured on the surface of the sensor chip and provided a supported lipid bilayer. To remove any multilamellar structures from the lipid surface, sodium hydroxide (20 μl, 25 mm) was injected at a flow rate of 100 μl/min, which resulted in a stable base line corresponding to the immobilized liposome bilayer membrane with response units of 4500–6000.

https://openalex.org/W2135317380,"The study examined how the mitochondrial enzyme monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A), which produces hydrogen peroxide as a catalytic by-product, influences death and survival mechanisms. Targeted microRNA (miRNA) was used to stably knock down MAO-A mRNA, protein, and catalytic activity by 60-70% in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. The effects of MAO-A knockdown (KD) on ATP, oxidative stress, electron transport chain, and survival following exposure to mitochondrial toxins were assessed. In control cells, complex I inhibition resulted in caspase-mediated cell death linked with ROS production and reduced ATP, followed by up-regulation of MAO-A mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity levels. Inhibition of complex III and IV resulted in a similar increase in MAO-A expression, while up-regulation of MAO-A was lower following complex II inhibition. MAO-A KD decreased basal reactive oxygen species levels by 50% and increased levels of ATP and reduced glutathione and Bcl-2. MAO-A KD specifically increased the activity of complex I but had no effect on complex II-IV activities. Furthermore, MAO-A KD protected against inhibitors of complex I, III, and IV. In summary, endogenous MAO-A levels influence mitochondrial function, notably complex I activity, and MAO-A may be a target for protection against neurodegenerative conditions that involve oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction as underlying pathogenic factors."

To investigate this, we first investigated the impact of five hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-causing (N1327K, E1356K, R1382W, E1555K, and R1768K) and one dilated cardiomyopathy-causing (R1500W) tail mutations on their ability to incorporate into muscle sarcomeres in vivo. We used adenoviral delivery to express full-length wild type or mutant enhanced GFP-MHC in isolated adult cardiomyocytes. Three mutations (N1327K, E1356K, and E1555K) reduced enhanced GFP-MHC incorporation into muscle sarcomeres, whereas the remainder had no effect. No mutations significantly affected contraction. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching showed that fluorescence recovery for the mutation that incorporated least well (N1327K) was significantly faster than that of WT with half-times of 25.1 ± 1.8 and 32.2 ± 2.5 min (mean ± S.E.), respectively.

It contains two heavy and four light chains. The heavy chains dimerize by forming a coiled-coil tail in the C-terminal region of the molecule and separate to form two globular heads at their N-terminal region. The globular head contains the motor domain, which binds actin and nucleotide and is responsible for generating contraction. The coiled-coil tail contains two α-helices that interact with each other to bury hydrophobic residues, forming a hydrophobic seam (1.Parry D.A. Fraser R.D. Squire J.M. Fifty years of coiled-coils and α-helical bundles: a close relationship between sequence and structure.J. Struct. Biol. 2008; 163: 258-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Each contains a distinctive heptad repeat sequence in the form of (abcdefg)n where a and d are commonly hydrophobic. Because the heptad repeat is slightly shorter than two turns of an α-helix, the two helices twist around each other to form a coiled coil with a left-handed superhelix (2.Offer G. Sessions R. Computer modelling of the α-helical coiled coil: packing of side-chains in the inner core.J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 967-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The tail also contains four “skip” residues, nominally at positions Thr-1188, Glu-1385, Glu-1582 and Gly-1807, which interrupt the heptad motif and correlate to bends in the myosin tail in the isolated molecules (3.Offer G. Skip residues correlate with bends in the myosin tail.J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The distal region of the coiled-coil tail assembles into thick filaments as a result of patterns of alternating charge along the length of the coiled coil (4.Atkinson S.J. Stewart M.

Mutations in MYH7 cause ∼40% of cases of inherited HCM (9.Maron B.J. The 2009 international hypertrophic cardiomyopathy summit.Am. J.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 2012.Circulation. 2012; 125: 1432-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). More generally, mutations in genes that encode sarcomeric proteins are responsible for HCM (12.Maron B.J. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: a systematic review.JAMA. 2002; 287: 1308-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) with over 630 mutations in 10 sarcomeric genes described as causing this disease. Mutations in MYH7 also cause dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a rarer heart disease that only affects about 1 in 2500 people (13.Taylor M.R. Carniel E. Mestroni L. Cardiomyopathy, familial dilated.Orphanet. J. Rare Dis. 2006; 1: 27Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and is characterized by a thinning of the ventricular walls (ventricular dilatation). Currently, over 200 HCM and 24 DCM mutations have been described for MYH7 (14.Xu Q. Dewey S. Nguyen S. Gomes A.V.

However, tail mutations are rare, and only limited descriptions of their severity and phenotype are available (supplemental Table S1). hypertrophic cardiomyopathy fluorescence recovery after photobleaching dilated cardiomyopathy enhanced GFP light meromyosin myosin heavy chain. Although a clear link between HCM-causing mutations in the motor domain and HCM can be attributed to direct effects on force output (11.Ho C.Y. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 2012.Circulation. 2012; 125: 1432-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), it is unclear why mutations in the distal tail result in HCM. As the main role of the tail is to form filaments, it is unlikely that mutations in the tail directly affect force output. However, effects on coiled-coil structure and/or packing of the coiled coil into the thick filament might affect myosin incorporation into thick filaments in sarcomeres, and thus indirectly affect force output over the longer term. To test this idea, we investigated five different mutations that result in HCM (15.Blair E. Redwood C. de Jesus Oliveira M. Moolman-Smook J.C. Brink P. Corfield V.A. Ostman-Smith I. Watkins H.

In those reports, expressed and purified light meromyosin peptides containing the mutation had decreased thermal stability, but the secondary structure was not affected. This suggested to us that any effects on secondary structure could be localized and not observable in the full-length LMM. Thus, in this study, we have used shorter peptides to investigate the effects of the mutations. Neither of these previous reports investigated the effects of these mutations in vivo. Here, we have investigated the effects of each of these mutations on the incorporation of full-length β-cardiac myosin heavy chain fused to eGFP (eGFP-MHC) in vivo. We used an adenoviral expression system to express eGFP-MHC in adult rat cardiomyocytes, and we determined whether these mutations affect incorporation of the full-length heavy chain into the sarcomere or contraction. To determine whether the effects we observed were correlated to effects on peptide structure in vitro, we analyzed the secondary structure and thermal stability of peptides of different length. We used peptides that were 7, 11, or 15 heptads long from the myosin coiled-coil tail to determine whether any or all of the five different mutations affect molecular structure and to determine whether the effects observed depended on peptide length. The full-length cDNA for the heavy chain of MYH7 (24.Miller G. Maycock J. White E. Peckham M. Calaghan S.

Physiol. 2003; 548: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) was cloned into an adenoviral expression vector (pdc315, Addgene) with eGFP fused to the N terminus to generate eGFP-MHC. A second construct, without eGFP, was also constructed. Purified virus (at multiplicities of infection between 50 and 100) was used to infect isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes. These were prepared from isolated rat hearts using a Langendorff retrograde perfusion technique with a collagenase-containing solution (25.McCrossan Z.A. Billeter R. White E. Transmural changes in size, contractile and electrical properties of SHR left ventricular myocytes during compensated hypertrophy.Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 63: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C, to allow the MHC to be expressed, cells were fixed using 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline prior to staining for other proteins of interest. Cells were stained with antibodies against an M-line epitope of titin (Ti51; kind gift of Dieter Furst (26.Van der Ven P.F. Ehler E. Perriard J.C. Fürst D.O. Thick filament assembly occurs after the formation of a cytoskeletal scaffold.J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1999; 20: 569-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)) or for myosin heavy chain (A4.1025 antibody (27.Maggs A.M. Taylor-Harris P. Peckham M. Hughes S.M. Evidence for differential post-translational modifications of slow myosin heavy chain during murine skeletal muscle development.J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2000; 21: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)), and cells were imaged using a Deltavision deconvolution microscope. Levels of eGFP-MHC expression were compared with endogenous levels of MHC by SDS gel analysis using a protocol that separates MHC isoforms in a minigel system (28.Picard B. Barboiron C. Chadeyron D. Jurie C. Protocol for high-resolution electrophoresis separation of myosin heavy chain isoforms in bovine skeletal muscle.Electrophoresis. 2011; 32: 1804-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, the separating gel contained 35% v/v glycerol, 9% total acrylamide of which 1/49 was bisacrylamide, 230 mm Tris-HCl, 115 mm glycine, pH 8.8, and 0.4% w/v SDS; and the stacking gel contained 47% v/v glycerol, 6% w/v acrylamide (1/49 bisacrylamide), 110 mm Tris-HCl, 6 mm EDTA, pH 6.8, and 0.4% w/v SDS. Gels were stained, or proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose paper to perform Western blotting, using an antibody to MHC (A4.1025) or to eGFP (Abcam). These blots confirmed which band was endogenous and which was the eGFP-tagged myosin in the stained gel (Fig. 1). As expression levels were ∼10% or less after 24 h, we also attempted to culture MHC expressing cardiomyocytes for longer time periods. However, we found that long term culture of cardiomyocytes resulted in a loss of contractility of the intact cells and in a loss of the characteristic rod shape, as documented previously (29.Leach R.N. Desai J.C. Orchard C.H. Effect of cytoskeleton disruptors on L-type Ca channel distribution in rat ventricular myocytes.Cell Calcium. 2005; 38: 515-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We also suspect that the large excess of the overexpressed MHC compared with other myosin-binding proteins (light chains, titin, MyBP-C, actin, etc.) that are also needed to incorporate and regulate the MHC into muscle sarcomeres contributed to the loss of contractility as large amounts of unregulated soluble nonincorporated MHC may be toxic to the cells. Thus, 24 h of myosin overexpression is the best compromise between expression of high enough levels of eGFP-MHC to observe the impacts of the mutants within the sarcomere and expression of such high levels that cell viability is lost. For FRAP experiments, cells were plated onto laminin-coated glass bottomed dishes (35 mm, Iwaki), infected with the adenovirus, cultured overnight, and imaged the following day using an inverted Zeiss 510 confocal microscope. Dishes were placed onto the heated stage (set to 37 °C); 10–15 cells were selected and their positions marked. A Zeiss multitime series macro was programmed to image each cell in turn, bleaching a small rectangular area in each cell, ∼2 sarcomeres in width, using 20 cycles of maximum laser power (at a wavelength of 488 nm) and then imaging each cell every 5–10 min after bleaching for the next 105–125 min at 1% laser power until fluorescence recovery reached a plateau. To analyze the data, the average intensity of the bleached area was measured at each time point using ImageJ. Recordings from cells that contracted or underwent large movements during the experiment were discarded. The average image intensity of the same sized area in an area adjacent to that bleached was also measured, to test that the intensity of nonbleached regions did not change. Data were normalized as described (30.Snapp E.L. Altan N. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Measuring protein mobility by photobleaching GFP chimeras in living cells.Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2003; (Chapter 21, Unit 21.1)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exponential fits to the data were generated using Prism (GraphPad). Within 18–24 h of infection, live cells were placed in a bath, continuously perfused with physiological saline at room temperature, and stimulated by external platinum electrodes at a frequency of 1 Hz to investigate their ability to contract. Contraction was recorded using video edge detection (24.Miller G. Maycock J. White E. Peckham M. Calaghan S. Heterologous expression of wild-type and mutant β-cardiac myosin changes the contractile kinetics of cultured mouse myotubes.J. Physiol. 2003; 548: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and analyzed for the times to peak shortening and half-relaxation together with contractility, indexed as the amplitude of shortening as a percent of resting cell length. Standard PCR-based cloning was used to generate expression vectors for GST fusion proteins, using the MYH7 cDNA as a template. All constructs were sequence-verified after cloning. The resulting expression vectors were used to express peptides in Escherichia coli. During purification, the GST was removed using PreScission Protease. All peptides (supplemental Table S2) contained the N-terminal sequence GPLGS in addition to the peptide sequence. Each peptide expressed was designed to start and end on a residue in the d-position of the heptad repeat. Peptides were 55, 83, or 111 residues long (7, 11, or 15 heptads, respectively). The 7-heptad peptides were designed such that in mutants the mutated residue was in the central heptad with three heptads on either side. The concentrations of the purified proteins were determined by a micro BCA assay (Pierce) and/or by measuring their absorbance at 280 nm in a quartz cuvette on a Cary-50 spectrophotometer and using the extinction coefficient calculated from the sequence (using ProtParam (ExPASy)). The 7-heptad peptides were additionally analyzed by mass spectrometry, to confirm that their molecular mass was correct. Circular dichroism spectra were measured from 260 to 190 nm at 10 °C using a Jasco J715 spectropolarimeter. For the 7H peptides, protein concentrations varied from 0.25 to 0.05 mg/ml, and their CD spectra were obtained at 10 °C at pH 8.0 in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm phosphate buffer. Thermal melt data were obtained either in the same buffer or in 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm phosphate buffer, at pH 7.0. An increase in pH slightly increased the melting temperature (Tm) for all the peptides equally. 1 mm DTT was added to peptides containing a cysteine residue. The effect of the mutations on α-helical content was estimated by comparing the value of the ellipticity measurements (θ222) at a wavelength of 222 nm, expressed as mean residue ellipticity in degrees cm2 dmol−1 for the peptides at 10 °C for all the constructs. The θ222 values indicate the relative helical content of the peptides. We therefore used θ222 values to compare helical content between the constructs. Repeat measurements for the majority of the 7H constructs gave consistent results, giving confidence that the observed differences between peptides are likely to be significant, especially where differences are large. Where more than two repeats were performed for the 7H constructs, error bars are shown in Fig. 5. To compare helical contents between peptides, the 222 nm value was divided by −36,000 (theoretical value for 100% helical content) (32.Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Computed circular dichroism spectra for the evaluation of protein conformation.Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3318) Google Scholar). For the 11H and 15H peptides, protein concentrations varied from 0.25 to 0.1 mg/ml, and their CD spectra were obtained at 10 °C in 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Further data obtained in the same buffer at pH 7.0 (data not shown) showed very little change in the spectra at a temperature of 10 °C. Three repeat measurements were made for each of the 11 and 15H peptides, and t tests used to determine whether differences in helical content (estimated from the 222-nm value as described above) were significant. The effect of temperature on the α-helical content was measured by taking measurements at 222 nm from 5 to 60 °C, for every 1 °C temperature change. The conditions used were 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm phosphate buffer, at pH 7.0. Temperature was changed at a rate of 2 °C/min. The temperature was returned to 10 °C, and the resulting spectrum was close to that measured prior to heating (value at 222 nm, to within a few percent). The θ222 measurements were normalized by setting the value at 5 °C to 0% unfolded and the value at 65 °C to 100% unfolded. The resulting plots of the θ222 values were fit using the Boltzman sigmoidal fit function in GraphPad Prism 6 software (33.Greenfield N.J. Using circular dichroism collected as a function of temperature to determine the thermodynamics of protein unfolding and binding interactions.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2527-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) to generate values for Tm. WT eGFP-MHC was expressed successfully in isolated adult cardiomyocytes, and the eGFP-tagged MHC (in which eGFP is fused to the MHC N terminus (motor domain)) incorporated into the thick filaments in muscle sarcomeres. eGFP-MHC began to be expressed and to incorporate into sarcomeres 6–7 h after viral infection (supplemental Fig. S1). After 24 h, the pattern of fluorescence for eGFP-MHC was similar to the immunostaining pattern for total MHC, using an antibody against an epitope in the motor domain (Fig. 1A). Both the anti-MHC immunostaining and the eGFP fluorescence show two stripes, separated by an unstained gap, which corresponds to the bare zone in the center of the thick filament. The unstained gap at the M-line was wider (∼0.3 μm) for eGFP-MHC than for endogenous myosin (Fig. 1B), suggesting that there is some limit on incorporation of new myosin in the center of the thick filament, as reported earlier (34.Wenderoth M.P. Eisenberg B.R. Incorporation of nascent myosin heavy chains into thick filaments of cardiac myocytes in thyroid-treated rabbits.J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2771-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The gap in intensity at the I-band is similar for eGFP-MHC and the immunostained image for MHC (Fig. 1B). Overall, the newly synthesized eGFP-MHC has incorporated generally throughout the thick filaments, and not only at the very edges of the A-bands or at the periphery of the myofibrils, similar to that reported for embryonic chicken MHC in embryonic cardiomyocytes (35.Wang Q. Moncman C.L. Winkelmann D.A. Mutations in the motor domain modulate myosin activity and myofibril organization.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4227-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), although the fluorescence intensity is higher at the ends of the A-band. This suggests that myosin may exchange more easily at the ends of the thick filaments, because of the reduced number of interactions that myosin there makes with other myosins, as the thick filament tapers at this point. It is also possible that diffusion is faster within the I-band (less congested) than with the A-band, so that exchanging molecules are more likely to encounter thick filament ends. Using the adenoviral expression system, we expressed and characterized six different tail mutants (N1327K, E1356K, R1382W, R1500W, E1555K, and E1768K) in adult cardiomyocytes. These mutations are all found in the tail of MHC (Fig. 5A and supplemental Table S2). WT and mutant eGFP-MHC were all expressed at a level of 5–10% of the endogenous myosin, following 24 h of infection with the adenovirus as shown by SDS-polyacrylamide gel and Western blotting (Fig. 1B), with the exception of R1500W, which was expressed at slightly lower levels (∼2% of endogenous myosin). Deconvolution microscopy of fixed cardiomyocytes containing expressed mutant eGFP-MHC isoforms showed that in the case of several mutants, eGFP-MHC did not incorporate into muscle sarcomeres as well as WT eGFP-MHC in substantial numbers of cells (Fig. 2). Instead, eGFP-MHC incorporation was limited to regions at the edges at the A-bands, where it is mainly incorporated into the ends of the thick filament, and there were increased numbers of filamentous aggregates outside the myofibrils (Fig. 2B). These filamentous aggregates are likely to contain eGFP-MHC that is unable to incorporate or exchange into the sarcomeric thick filaments. We repeated these experiments several times and consistently observed this effect. Quantifying the proportions of cells with normal or limited incorporation showed that the mutation N1327K resulted in the highest increase in the proportion of cells with limited incorporation of eGFP-MHC, and this increase was significant (Fig. 2B). Two further mutations, E1356K and E1555K, also showed a trend toward an increase in numbers of cells with limited eGFP MHC incorporation. In the remaining three mutations, R1500W, R138W, and E1768K, eGFP MHC incorporation wa"
https://openalex.org/W2032974810,"It has long been known that during initial transcription of the first 8-10 bases of RNA, complexes are relatively unstable, leading to the release of short abortive RNA transcripts. An early ""stressed intermediate"" model led to a more specific mechanistic model proposing ""scrunching"" stress as the basis for the instability. Recent studies in the single subunit T7 RNA polymerase have argued against scrunching as the energetic driving force and instead argue for a model in which pushing of the RNA-DNA hybrid against a protein element associated with promoter binding, while likely driving promoter release, reciprocally leads to instability of the hybrid. In this study, we test these models in the structurally unrelated multisubunit bacterial RNA polymerase. Via the targeted introduction of mismatches and nicks in the DNA, we demonstrate that neither downstream bubble collapse nor compaction/scrunching of either the single-stranded template or nontemplate strands is a major force driving abortive instability (although collapse from the downstream end of the bubble does contribute significantly to the instability of artificially halted complexes). In contrast, pushing of the hybrid against a mobile protein element (σ3.2 in the bacterial enzyme) results in substantially increased abortive instability and is likely the primary energetic contributor to abortive cycling. The results suggest that abortive instability is a by-product of the mechanistic need to couple the energy of nucleotide addition (RNA chain growth) to driving the timed release of promoter contacts during initial transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2004443873,"The cotranscriptional mRNA processing and packaging reactions that lead to the formation of export-competent messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) are under the surveillance of quality control steps. Aberrant mRNPs resulting from faulty events are retained in the nucleus with ensuing elimination of their mRNA component. The molecular mechanisms by which the surveillance system recognizes defective mRNPs and stimulates their destruction by the RNA degradation machinery are still not completely elucidated. Using an experimental approach in which mRNP formation in yeast is disturbed by the action of the bacterial Rho helicase, we have shown previously that the targeting of Rho-induced aberrant mRNPs is mediated by Rrp6p, which is recruited cotranscriptionally in association with Nrd1p following Rho action. Here we investigated the specific involvement in this quality control process of different cofactors associated with the nuclear RNA degradation machinery. We show that, in addition to the main hydrolytic action of the exonuclease Rrp6p, the cofactors Rrp47p, Mpp6p as well as the Trf-Air-Mtr4 polyadenylation (TRAMP) components Trf4p, Trf5p, and Air2p contribute significantly by stimulating the degradation process upon their cotranscriptional recruitment. Trf4p and Trf5p are apparently recruited in two distinct TRAMP complexes that both contain Air2p as component. Surprisingly, Rrp47p appears to play an important role in mutual protein stabilization with Rrp6p, which highlights a close association between the two partners. Together, our results provide an integrated view of how different cofactors of the RNA degradation machinery cooperate to target and eliminate aberrant mRNPs."

It operates in either forward mode (Ca2+ efflux) or reverse mode (Ca2+ influx), depending on the membrane potential and ion gradients across the plasma membrane. In the heart, Ca2+ entry via the L-type Ca2+ channel during the action potential triggers a larger amount of Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via the ryanodine receptor, mediating cardiac muscle contraction. During relaxation, cytosolic Ca2+ is removed by both the SR Ca2+ ATPase and by forward-mode NCX activity. At steady state, the amount of Ca2+ removal via NCX equals Ca2+ entry via the L-type Ca2+ channel. The contribution of NCX to total Ca2+ removal in the cardiac myocyte is species-dependent, varying from less than 10% in mice and rats to up to 30% in guinea pigs, rabbits, and humans (1.Bers D.M. Calcium fluxes involved in control of cardiac myocyte contraction.Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar).

NADH/NAD+ redox potential determines the activity of enzymes that utilize NADH to donate electrons in both the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix. In the cytosol, NADH is mainly produced by glycolysis and oxidized either anaerobically by the lactate dehydrogenase reaction or transported indirectly into the mitochondria via a shuttle system to be oxidized by NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) of the respiratory chain. Although, under physiological conditions, cytosolic NAD+:NADH has been reported to range from 500–1000 (23.Zhang Q. Piston D.W. Goodman R.H. Regulation of corepressor function by nuclear NADH.Science. 2002; 295: 1895-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 24.Veech R.L. Eggleston L.V. Krebs H.A.

Moreover, chronic pathological conditions such as angina, heart failure, or diabetes involve alterations in glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, or blood lactate concentrations (lactic acidosis), which will lead to an altered cytosolic NADH/NAD+ ratio. In this study, we investigate whether an altered cytosolic NADH/NAD+ redox potential modulates NCX activity in adult guinea pig ventricular myocytes. We demonstrate that cardiac NCX is inhibited by increased cytosolic NADH and that this effect is mediated by ROS. We further characterize the source of NADH-induced ROS, which is independent of mitochondrial respiration and is prevented by a flavoprotein inhibitor, diphenylene iodonium (DPI). Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of cardiac NCX regulation by cytosolic NADH/NAD+ redox potential. All animal handling and care was performed in accordance with the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996) and was approved by The Johns Hopkins Animal Care and Use Committee. Ventricular myocytes were enzymatically isolated from adult guinea pig heart as described previously (25.O'Rourke B. Ramza B.M. Marban E. Oscillations of membrane current and excitability driven by metabolic oscillations in heart cells.Science. 1994; 265: 962-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Myocytes were loaded in a heated chamber (37 °C) on the stage of a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE300) and superfused with Cs-Tyrode's solution containing 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm sodium-HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4). To block L-type Ca2+ channels and Na+-K+-ATPase, 10 μm nitrendipine and strophanthidin, respectively, were applied in Cs-Tyrode's solution. Myocytes were whole-cell patch-clamped with 2–4 MΩ pipettes and equilibrated with a pipette solution containing 120 mm CsCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm sodium-HEPES, 5 mm magnesium-ATP, 5 mm 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), and 3 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.25). The presence of 5 mm BAPTA and 3 mm CaCl2 in pipette solution buffered the intracellular Ca2+ to 200 nm. After achievement of whole-cell conformation, cells were voltage-clamped at a holding potential of −40 mV. INCX was recorded with families of pulses applied from +80 to −80 mV in 20-mV steps for 300 ms at 0.5 Hz. After each pulse, the voltage was returned to −40 mV. INCX was defined as the current blocked by 5 mm NiCl2 (nickel-sensitive current). As indicated, NADH, NADPH, catalase, or rotenone were added to the intracellular pipette solutions. Stock solutions of NADH, NADPH, and catalase were freshly prepared on the day of the experiment. When testing each compound or condition, NCX currents were compared with those of control and/or NADH groups in the same cell preparation unless specified otherwise. To record NADH in single cells (Figs. 2D and 3A), myocytes were excited at λex = 360 nm, and NADH autofluorescence was collected at λem = 450 nm with a photomultiplier tube (PTI Inc., Birmingham, NJ). The mitochondrial NADH oxidation state was calibrated by applying 4 mm NaCN (CN−) for 100% NADH reduction and 5 μm carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone for 0% NADH reduction at the end of recording. NADH in myocyte suspensions was measured in a quartz cuvette with a fluorometer (QuantaMaster, PTI, Inc.) with stirring and temperature-controlled at 37 °C (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 3Effects of lactate on NADH and INCX.

The total H2O2 emission in cell suspensions was measured with Amplex UltraRed (Invitrogen). Myocytes were suspended in 2 ml of normal Tyrode's solution with 50 μm Amplex UltraRed reagent, 5 units/ml horseradish peroxidase, and 10 units superoxide dismutase in a stirred quartz cuvette. Fluorescence intensity was measured with a fluorometer at 37 °C. Values are reported as mean ±S.E. Statistical analysis between I-V plots of INCX and between DCF recordings (Fig. 4A) were performed using multiple linear regression. For average INCX at +80 or −80 mV, unpaired Student's t test was performed. Reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless indicated otherwise. With a holding potential of −40 mV, a family of pulses from +80 to −80 mV at 20-mV steps (Fig. 1, inset) elicited nickel-sensitive and nickel-insensitive currents. INCX was defined as the nickel-sensitive component (Fig. 1C) determined by subtracting nickel-insensitive (B) from the total current (A). In Fig. 1D, the currents in response to repeated families of pulses were recorded with control pipette solution and plotted against experimental time (I-t plot). The representative I-t plot of control currents (Fig. 1D) illustrated that, starting from a low base-line level (currents elicited by the first family of pulses), INCX was gradually activated and reached a steady state within 2–3 min, in keeping with previous studies (26.Maack C. Ganesan A. Sidor A. O'Rourke B. Cardiac sodium-calcium exchanger is regulated by allosteric calcium and exchanger inhibitory peptide at distinct sites.Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Application of 5 mm nickel to the perfusate rapidly blocked INCX, leaving only a stable background current. To test the effects of NADH on INCX, we applied 100 or 400 μm NADH, respectively, in the intracellular pipette solutions and measured INCX. Although 100 μm NADH had no effect on INCX (Fig. 2, A and G), application of 400 μm NADH significantly inhibited INCX (Fig. 2, B, C, and G). Reverse-mode INCX at +80 mV decreased by 66% (4.57 ± 0.26 pA/pF in the control and 1.57 ± 0.20 pA/pF in 400 μm NADH, p < 0.0001), and forward-mode INCX at −80 mV decreased by 70% (-0.79 ± 0.10 pA/pF in the control and −0.24 ± 0.12 pA/pF in 400 μm NADH, p < 0.001) (Fig. 2C). Fig. 2E shows a representative I-t plot with the currents recorded in the presence of 400 μm NADH right after the achievement of whole-cell configuration. In contrast to the gradual activation under control conditions, INCX declined with 400 μm NADH in the pipette solution and reached a steady state in about 3 min of recording (Fig. 2E). To test whether NADPH had similar inhibitory effects on INCX, INCX was measured in the presence of 100 or 400 μm NADPH in the pipette solution. NADPH showed no effect on INCX at either concentration (Fig. 2, F and G). The cumulative I-V plots of control INCX and INCX in the presence of NADH or NADPH are shown in Fig. 1G. To investigate whether increasing endogenous cytosolic NADH has a similar inhibitory effect on INCX, 1 mm lactate was applied in the perfusate to promote the reduction of NAD+ by lactate dehydrogenase reaction in the cytosol. Following lactate perfusion, NADH autofluorescence in myocytes increased by 20–30% of the total cellular NADH pool (Fig. 3A). INCX was markedly inhibited at a time point 5 min after lactate perfusion (Fig. 3B). Compared with control INCX, the forward mode of INCX at −80 mV decreased by 85% (-0.80 ± 0.15 pA/pF in control cells and −0.12 ± 0.07 pA/pF in lactate-treated cells, p < 0.01), and the reverse mode of INCX at +80 mV decreased by 74% (5.76 ± 0.72 pA/pF in control cells and 1.52 ± 0.25 pA/pF in lactate-treated cells, p < 0.005). Next we examined whether increasing mitochondrial NADH had the same effect on INCX as that of increasing cytosolic NADH. INCX was measured in myocytes in which mitochondrial NADH was fully reduced by applying 4 mm NaCN to the perfusate. The reverse-mode of INCX at +80 mV was 4.00 ± 0.07 pA/pF, which was not significantly different from the control shown in Fig. 2G. To determine whether the increased cytosolic NADH/NAD+ redox potential affected intracellular ROS, cumulative H2O2 production was monitored in both single myocytes and cell suspensions. Myocytes loaded with 5-(-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorohydrofluorescein diacetate were patch-clamped with control pipette solution or pipette solution containing 400 μm NADH, and DCF fluorescence was recorded after achievement of the whole-cell configuration. The DCF signal increased in cells with NADH in the pipette solution, whereas it remained unchanged in control cells (Fig. 4A). The NADH-induced H2O2 increase was also investigated in cell suspensions with the Amplex UltraRed assay system. Approximately 20,000 live myocytes were suspended in a quartz cuvette with 2 ml of Tyrode's solution, and the Amplex signal and NADH autofluorescence were monitored simultaneously. Following the addition of 5 mm lactate into the cuvette, NADH autofluorescence increased, which was associated with an increased rate of Amplex oxidation (Fig. 4B). The Amplex oxidation rate increased by 130% after lactate administration as compared with the control rate (Fig. 7C). The effect of lactate on ROS production displayed a sigmoidal dose dependence with a half-maximal effect at 3.78 mm (Fig. 4C). To investigate whether NADH-induced ROS is involved in INCX inhibition, INCX was measured with pipette solution containing 400 μm NADH with or without 1000 units/ml catalase. The data in figure 5A indicate that inhibition of INCX by NADH was abolished by catalase. INCX at −80 and +80 mV was −0.46 ± 0.05 pA/pF and 1.64 ± 0.23 pA/pF, respectively, when measured with NADH alone. However, in the presence of catalase, INCX at −80 and +80 mV was −1.34 ± 0.41 pA/pF and 5.43 ± 1.43 pA/pF, respectively, which was not significantly different from controls (cf. Fig. 2). Addition of catalase alone to control pipette solution had no effect on INCX (data not shown). We further examined whether increased oxidative stress is sufficient to inhibit INCX. Myocytes were incubated with the redox-cycling quinone derivative (2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (DMNQ); 100 μm) for 1 h. This reagent generates superoxide without directly modifying thiols or forming adducts. As demonstrated in Fig. 5, treatment with DMNQ inhibited INCX to a similar extent as NADH. The mitochondrial electron transport chain is a major source of ROS production in cells. To investigate whether the electron transport chain plays a role in NADH-induced ROS, H2O2 production induced by lactate was monitored in the presence of rotenone in myocyte suspensions. Rotenone did not block the increased H2O2 production following lactate application (Fig. 6A), suggesting that NADH-induced ROS is independent of the electron transport chain. INCX was further measured in the presence of NADH with or without rotenone. Rotenone did not prevent NADH-induced INCX inhibition. INCX was not significantly different between groups with and without rotenone (at −80mV, −0.11 ± 0.14 pA/pF without rotenone versus −0.31 ± 0.16 pA/pF with rotenone, p = not significant; at +80 mV, 1.74 ± 0.30 pA/pF without rotenone versus 2.28 ± 0.14 pA/pF with rotenone, p = not significant) (Fig. 6B). Compared with control INCX (Fig. 2G), INCX measured with a pipette solution containing NADH and rotenone at −80 and +80 mV was decreased by 61% (p < 0.01) and 50% (p < 0.001), respectively. NAD(P)H oxidases (NOXs) are another potential source of NADH-induced ROS. NOX2 and NOX4 are the two primary members of the NOX family present in cardiac myocytes. We first used a specific inhibitory peptide of NOX2, gp91ds-tat (AnaSpec, Inc., Fremont, CA), to examine the role of NOX2. The NADH inhibitory effect on INCX was still evident in myocytes dialyzed with 3 μm gp91ds-tat (Fig. 7A), and the response was not significantly different from that of NADH alone. We then tested the effect of DPI, a nonspecific NOX inhibitor. In myocytes treated with 3 μm DPI, INCX inhibition by NADH was abrogated (Fig. 7A). Moreover, DPI also inhibited the lactate-induced ROS increase in myocyte suspensions (the ratio of Amplex oxidation rate after lactate administration to that before lactate administration was 1.11 ± 0.05 in the presence of DPI (n = 6) versus 2.31 ± 0.44 without DPI (n = 6) (Fig. 7, B and C). These results suggest that a cytoplasmic NADH-dependent flavoenzyme other than NOX2 or complex I is implicated in the modulation of INCX. In this study, we investigated the role of NADH/NAD+ redox potential in the modulation of sarcolemmal NCX in isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes. We found that increasing cytosolic NADH via patch clamp (400 μm) or by lactate treatment significantly inhibited INCX. This inhibition of NCX was mediated by H2O2. We also found that ROS induced by NADH was independent of mitochondrial respiration. These findings suggest that, during metabolic stress in cardiomyocytes, increased cytosolic NADH can play a critical role in both oxidative stress and Ca2+ homeostasis. The NADH/NAD+ ratio is an important component of cellular redox state and regulates energy metabolism in the cytoplasm by controlling the activity of several enzymatic reactions in the cytosol. Alterations in NADH/NAD+ ratio not only reflect abnormal redox and metabolic conditions but can also play a primary role in the regulation of ion channels. Recent studies demonstrated that NADH inhibits the Na+ current (27.Liu M. Liu H. Dudley Jr., S.C. Reactive oxygen species originating from mitochondria regulate the cardiac sodium channel.Circ. Res. 2010; 107: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 28.Liu M. Sanyal S. Gao G. Gurung I.S. Zhu X. Gaconnet G. Kerchner L.J. Shang L.L. Huang C.L. Grace A. London B. Dudley Jr., S.C.

A sustained elevation of cytosolic NADH can occur under ischemic or hypoxic conditions, which was mimicked in this work by raising cytoplasmic NADH via the patch pipette or by increasing the NADH/NAD+ redox potential with lactate treatment, leading to a marked inhibition of INCX. Inhibition of NCX by NADH is, therefore, likely to be an important mechanism for Ca2+ regulation in the heart when energy metabolism is compromised. This effect would occur in parallel with other fa"

Freshly dissected Xenopus laevis lungs were used for transepithelial short-circuit current (ISC) recordings and were exposed to increased hydrostatic pressure (HP; 5 cm fluid column, modified Ussing chamber). I(SC) values obtained under HP (I(5cm)) were normalized to values before HP (I(0cm)) application (I(5cm)/I(0cm)). Under control conditions, HP decreased I(SC) (I(5cm)/I(0cm)=0.84; n=68; P<0.0001). This effect was reversible and repeatable ≥30 times. Preincubation with ATP-sensitive K(+) channel (K(ATP)) inhibitors (HMR1098 and glibenclamide) prevented the decrease in I(SC) (I(5cm)/I(0cm): HMR1098=1.19, P<0.0001; glibenclamide=1.11, P<0.0001). Similar effects were observed with hemichannel inhibitors (I(5cm)/I(0cm): meclofenamic acid=1.09, P<0.0001; probenecid=1.0, P<0.0001). The HP effect was accompanied by release of ATP (P<0.05), determined by luciferin-luciferase luminescence in perfusion solution from the luminal side of an Ussing chamber. ATP release was abrogated by both meclofenamic acid and probenecid. RT-PCR experiments revealed the expression of pannexin and connexin hemichannels and KATP subunit transcripts in X. laevis lung. These data show an activation of KATP in pulmonary epithelial cells in response to HP that is induced by ATP release through mechanosensitive pannexin and connexin hemichannels. These findings represent a novel mechanism of mechanotransduction in nonexcitable cells."

It consists of a scaffolding A subunit to which a catalytic C subunit and one of many regulatory B subunits bind. Of the more than 80 PP2A isoforms, 10% use Aβ as a scaffold. This study demonstrates the isoform-specific function of the A scaffold subunits. Polyomaviruses have shown the importance of phosphotyrosine, PI3K, and p53 in transformation. Comparisons of polyoma and SV40 small T antigens implicate Aβ in the control of differentiation. Knockdown of Aβ enhanced differentiation. Akt signaling regulated differentiation; its activation or inhibition promoted or blocked it, respectively. Aβ bound Akt. Enhancement of PP2A Aβ/Akt interaction by polyoma small T antigen increased turnover of Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation. Conversely, knockdown of Aβ promoted Akt activity and reduced turnover of phosphate at Ser-473 of Akt. These data provide new insight into the regulation of Akt, a protein of extreme importance in cancer. Furthermore, our results suggest that the role for Aβ in differentiation and perhaps tumor suppression may lie partly in its ability to negatively regulate Akt."

https://openalex.org/W1996019777,"Filamins are actin-binding and cross-linking proteins that organize the actin cytoskeleton and anchor transmembrane proteins to the cytoskeleton and scaffold signaling pathways. During hematopoietic cell differentiation, transient expression of ASB2α, the specificity subunit of an E3-ubiquitin ligase complex, triggers acute proteasomal degradation of filamins. This led to the proposal that ASB2α regulates hematopoietic cell differentiation by modulating cell adhesion, spreading, and actin remodeling through targeted degradation of filamins. Here, we show that the calponin homology domain 1 (CH1), within the filamin A (FLNa) actin-binding domain, is the minimal fragment sufficient for ASB2α-mediated degradation. Combining an in-depth flow cytometry analysis with mutagenesis of lysine residues within CH1, we find that arginine substitution at each of a cluster of three lysines (Lys-42, Lys-43, and Lys-135) renders FLNa resistant to ASB2α-mediated degradation without altering ASB2α binding. These lysines lie within previously predicted actin-binding sites, and the ASB2α-resistant filamin mutant is defective in targeting to F-actin-rich structures in cells. However, by swapping CH1 with that of α-actinin1, which is resistant to ASB2α-mediated degradation, we generated an ASB2α-resistant chimeric FLNa with normal subcellular localization. Notably, this chimera fully rescues the impaired cell spreading induced by ASB2α expression. Our data therefore reveal ubiquitin acceptor sites in FLNa and establish that ASB2α-mediated effects on cell spreading are due to loss of filamins."
https://openalex.org/W2008016068,"Osteogenesis is a complex process that is orchestrated by several growth factors, extracellular cues, signaling molecules, and transcriptional factors. Understanding the mechanisms of bone formation is pivotal for clarifying the pathogenesis of bone diseases. Previously, we reported that fad104 (factor for adipocyte differentiation 104), a novel positive regulator of adipocyte differentiation, negatively regulated the differentiation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts into osteocytes. However, the physiological role of fad104 in bone formation has not been elucidated. Here, we clarified the role of fad104 in bone formation in vivo and in vitro. fad104 disruption caused craniosynostosis-like premature ossification of the calvarial bone. Furthermore, analyses using primary calvarial cells revealed that fad104 negatively regulated differentiation and BMP/Smad signaling pathway. FAD104 interacted with Smad1/5/8. The N-terminal region of FAD104, which contains a proline-rich motif, was capable of binding to Smad1/5/8. We demonstrated that down-regulation of Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation by FAD104 is dependent on the N-terminal region of FAD104 and that fad104 functions as a novel negative regulator of BMP/Smad signaling and is required for proper development for calvarial bone. These findings will aid a comprehensive description of the mechanism that controls normal and premature calvarial ossification."
https://openalex.org/W2030841935,"Skeletal fusions with sterility (sks) is an autosomal recessive mutation of mouse that results in male and female sterility because of defects in gametogenesis. The mutants also have skeletal malformations with fused vertebrae and ribs. We examined testicular phenotypes of sks/sks mice to investigate the defects in spermatogenesis. Histological and immunocytochemical analyses and expression analyses of the marker genes demonstrated that spermatogenesis is arrested at mid to late pachytene stage of meiotic prophase with defective synapsis of the homologous chromosomes. Next, we determined the precise chromosomal localization of the sks locus on a 0.3-Mb region of mouse chromosome 4 by linkage analysis. By sequencing the positional candidate genes in this region and whole exome sequencing, we found a GG to TT nucleotide substitution in exon 6 of the Tmem48 gene that encodes a putative transmembrane protein with six transmembrane domains. The nucleotide substitution causes aberrant splicing, which deletes exon 6 of the Tmem48 transcript. Specific expression of TMEM48 was observed in germ cells of males and females. Furthermore, the phenotypes of the sks mutant were completely rescued by the transgenesis of a genomic fragment containing the wild-type Tmem48 gene.

Significance: This is the first report to demonstrate that the nuclear pore complex has an important role in mammalian gametogenesis. Mammalian gametogenesis, particularly spermatogenesis, is a dramatic developmental process. It consists of cell proliferation, differentiation, and morphogenesis, which involve numerous cellular and molecular steps, including germ cell differentiation and germ cell/somatic cell interactions. In mouse, spermatogenesis begins 7 days after birth with the differentiation of gonocytes into spermatogonial stem cells and subsequent recruitment of differentiated spermatogonia into meiosis I with the formation of pre-leptotene primary spermatocytes. Meiosis I is characterized by a prolonged prophase, consisting of the leptotene, zygotene, pachytene, diplotene, and diakinesis stages, in which the pairing and recombination of homologous chromosomes are accompanied by changes in chromatin structure. Meiosis I is initiated by the formation of meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) 4The abbreviations used are: DSBDNA double-strand breakBACbacterial artificial chromosomeEnembryonic dayESEsplicing enhancer motifNEnuclear envelopeNPCnuclear pore complexPnpostnatal daySCsynaptonemal complexSNPsingle-nucleotide polymorphismSPBspindle pole bodysqRT-PCRsemiquantitative RT-PCRTgtransgene. at the leptotene stage, and these DSBs are repaired by homologous recombination in zygotene spermatocytes. During the zygotene and pachytene stages, homologous chromosomes undergo synapsis, a process mediated by the formation of the synaptonemal complex (SC), which plays an essential role in meiotic recombination (1.Handel M.A. Schimenti J.C. Genetics of mammalian meiosis: regulation, dynamics and impact on fertility.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 124-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar).

To study the molecular mechanisms underlying mammalian gametogenesis, mutant mice with defective gametogenesis are useful animal models to identify the key molecules and signaling pathways (1.Handel M.A. Schimenti J.C.

So far, a large number of infertile and subinfertile animal models have been obtained by spontaneous mutations, gene targeting technology, and several mutagenesis projects; these animal models have certainly contributed to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of mammalian gametogenesis (1.Handel M.A. Schimenti J.C.

They are also valuable for gaining an understanding of the pathogenesis of human infertility, frequently due to defective gametogenesis. Skeletal fusions with sterility (sks) is an autosomal recessive mutation of mice that arose spontaneously in the A/J strain at The Jackson Laboratory. The sks mutant shows sterility and skeletal defects in both males and females, which are caused by defective gametogenesis and skeletal fusion, respectively (6.Handel M.A. Lane P.W. Schroeder A.C. Davisson M.T. New mutation causing sterility in the mouse.Gamete Res. 1988; 21: 409-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The sks mutant is, therefore, a good model to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying both gametogenesis and axial skeleton development in mammals, and identifying the causative gene for the sks mutation will contribute to understanding the genes required for in these processes. Here, we report a detailed examination of defective spermatogenesis in sks mutants as well as the positional cloning and identification of the underlying mutation in Tmem48. The sks mice that were used in this study were obtained from the Mouse Mutant Resource at The Jackson Laboratory. The JF1/Ms strain was obtained from the National Institute of Genetics (Mishima, Japan). The sks mutant and normal mice were euthanized, and tissues were excised and fixed by immersion in Bouin's fluid. After dehydration, tissues were embedded in paraffin wax and sectioned. After deparaffination in xylene, sections were rehydrated and stained with Mayer's hematoxylin and eosin. The protocols for the use of animals in this study were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Okayama University. The surface spread preparations of testicular cells were prepared as described previously (7.Noguchi J. Ozawa M. Nakai M. Somfai T. Kikuchi K. Kaneko H. Kunieda T.

Seminiferous tubules were dissociated in DMEM and centrifuged at 1800 rpm, and the collected cells were resuspended in DMEM. The cell suspension was spread onto the surface of the 0.5% NaCl solution, transferred to a silanized glass slide, and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde containing 0.02% SDS. The surface-spread preparations were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-SCP3 antibody (8.Chuma S. Nakatsuji N.

Total RNA samples of adult tissues, whole embryos of E10.5, testes of juvenile mice at various ages, ovaries of pubertal mice (21 days old), and each stage of the estrous cycle of adult mice were subjected to sqRT-PCR analyses. Total RNA from mouse tissues was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA preparations were treated with 10 units of DNase I (TaKaRa Bio, Shiga, Japan) and then purified. cDNA synthesis was performed by a reverse transcription reaction using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primer (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amounts of RNA were standardized according to the amplification of an internal control using the murine GAPDH primers (Table 1). The expression of stage-specific marker genes was examined by RT-PCR analysis by using primers that are listed in Table 1 as described in Dix et al. (9.Dix D.J. Allen J.W. Collins B.W. Poorman-Allen P. Mori C. Blizard D.R. Brown P.R. Goulding E.H. Strong B.D. Eddy E.M.

RT-PCR analysis was carried out in a reaction mixture containing a 100 nm concentration of each primer, a 100 μm concentration of each dNTP, and 0.25 unit of Taq polymerase (TaKaRa Bio) with 25–30 cycles of amplification that consisted of 94 °C for denaturation, 53 °C-60 °C for annealing, and 72 °C for extension.

To map the sks locus, genotypes of microsatellite makers of the F2 mice were determined by PCR in a reaction mixture containing 20 ng of genomic DNA, a 100 nm concentration of each primer for the microsatellite markers (Table 1), a 100 μm concentration of each dNTP, and 0.25 unit of Taq polymerase (TaKaRa Bio) with 35 cycles of amplification that consisted of 94 °C for denaturation, 53 °C-60 °C for annealing, and 72 °C for extension. For sequence analyses of the positional candidate genes, entire coding regions of the candidate genes were amplified by sets of primers (Table 1), cloned in the pGEM T-easy vector (Promega), and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method with a DNA sequencer HITACHI SQ5500. For whole exome sequencing, size selected DNA (Pippen Prep; Sage Science) and Illumina Paired End libraries were constructed from genomic DNA using the Illumina-supplied protocol. Hybridization-based sequence capture was used to enrich the Illumina library for all mouse coding sequences (exome). Roche NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Mouse Exome Design (110624_MM9_Exome L2R_D02_EZ_HX1) was utilized according to the manufacturer's protocols and as described by Fairfield et al. (10.Fairfield H.

After capture, enriched sequencing libraries used for cluster formation and paired end sequencing were done using Illumina HiSeq. Sequencing data were processed and aligned to the mouse genome (MGSC37, mm9) using a Burrows-Wheeler Alignmer, and SNPs/INDELs were called using SAMtools. The exon-trapping vector (Exontrap, pET01; MoBiTec, Göttingen, Germany) was used to investigate the splicing activity of exon 6 of the Tmem48 gene with the sks mutation. A 286-bp DNA fragment containing exon 6 and its flanking regions of the Tmem48 gene of the sks or wild-type allele was cloned into the pET01 vector. The clone carrying DNA from either wild-type (pET01-+) or sks alleles (pET01-sks) was transiently expressed in COS7 cells. COS7 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS and were seeded 24 h before transfection. COS7 cells were transfected with 1 μg of pET01-+ or pET01-sks using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics). Total RNA was extracted from COS7 cells 48 h after transfection, cDNA was synthesized with a primer for pET01–3′ transcriptional region, and RT-PCR was carried out using 2 sets of primers, pET01-exonA and pET01-exonB, or Tmem48-exon 6-specific primer and pET01-exonB (Table 1). A BAC clone, RP23-259O13 (Invitrogen), containing an ∼181-kb genomic fragment covering the Tmem48 gene that was cloned into the pBACe3.6 vector, was used for BAC transgenesis rescue experiments (see Fig. 8A). A DNA fragment containing the 181-kb BAC insert and flanking vector sequences was used for the pronuclear injection to generate the BAC transgenic mice containing the wild-type Tmem48 gene (see Fig. 8A). To genotype the transgenic animals, two sets of primers were used that amplified a 251-bp fragment of the T7 side of the pBACe3.6 vector-insert junction and a 289-bp fragment of the SP6 side of the pBACe3.6 vector-insert junction (see Fig. 8B and Table 1). A synthetic oligopeptide (HQKRLQQFLEFKE) that was derived from the C-terminal region of the mouse TMEM48 protein was used to immunize rabbits, and antibodies were purified from the serum of these rabbits. The specificity of the antibody was evaluated as follow. The Tmem48 protein fused with an N-terminal FLAG tag was expressed in COS7 cells by transfecting Tmem48/pCMV-Tg2. Lysates of transfected COS7 cells were electrophoresed through SDS-PAGE and transferred to a membrane, and the membrane was incubated with anti-TMEM48 or anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody and goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP or goat anti-mouse IgG HRP as a secondary antibody. A neutralization test was also performed to test the antibody specificity. The antibody was preincubated with 0.5 mg/ml TMEM48 antigen before immunohistochemical staining. For immunofluorescence analysis of the transfected COS7 cells with anti-TMEM48 or anti-FLAG antibody, donkey anti-rabbit IgG rhodamine-conjugated (AP182R; Chemicon) and goat anti-mouse IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 (A-21121; Invitrogen) were used as secondary antibodies. For the immunohistochemical analysis, tissue sections were incubated with PBS containing 0.3% H2O2 for 30 min and TNB buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5% tyramide signal amplification blocking reagent) for 30 min at room temperature. The sections were then incubated with the rabbit anti-TMEM48 antibody (1:500) with 3% BSA in PBS overnight at 4 °C. The sections were incubated in series with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (sc-2004, B0507; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted with 3% BSA in PBS (1:1000), 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNP) amplification reagents, anti-DNP-HRP antibody (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 3,3′-diaminobenzidinetetrahydrochloride chromogen (Dako, Kyoto, Japan). The sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin and were examined by light microscopy. Mouse testes were lysed in the radioimmuneprecipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm protease/phosphatase inhibitors). Equal amounts of the extracted proteins of the sks/sks and +/+ mice were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The filters were incubated with anti-TMEM48 antibody that was diluted in 2% blocking buffer. The filters were washed with PBS-Tween 20 and then were incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The HRP signal was detected using the Amersham Biosciences ECL Advance Western blotting Detection Kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The testes of adult sks/sks mice were smaller than those of normal littermate animals, but the sizes of other male reproductive organs, including the epididymis and seminal vesicle, showed no clear difference (Fig. 1A). The testis weights of adult sks/sks mice (0.045 ± 0.004 g) were less than one-fourth of those of normal mice (0.206 ± 0.046 g). Histological examination of the testes showed that most seminiferous tubules of the sks/sks mice contained germ cells at all stages of development up to pachytene stage, but neither spermatids nor spermatozoa were observed, and significant portions of seminiferous tubules were vacuolized (Fig. 1B) as reported previously (6.Handel M.A. Lane P.W. Schroeder A.C. Davisson M.T. New mutation causing sterility in the mouse.Gamete Res. 1988; 21: 409-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To further investigate the underlying spermatogenesis defect in the mutant mouse, we compared testis sections of sks/sks mice and normal littermates during the first wave of spermatogenesis at postnatal day (P) 14, 16, 18, 22, and 35 (Fig. 2) when spermatogenesis is synchronized (11.Bellvé A.R. Cavicchia J.C. Millette C.F. O'Brien D.A. Bhatnagar Y.M. Dym M. Spermatogenic cells of the prepubertal mouse: isolation and morphological characterization.J. Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 68-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). The seminiferous tubules of the mutant and normal mice showed an organized progression of cell types from spermatogonia at the periphery to leptotene, zygotene, or early-mid pachytene stage spermatocytes at the innermost layers at P14, and no significant difference was observed in the two genotypes (Fig. 2, A and B). At P16, mid-late pachytene spermatocytes and a few meiotic metaphase cells were apparent in the seminiferous tubules of the normal mice (Fig. 2C), and spermatocytes completed meiosis at P18 with the appearance of the round spermatids (Fig. 2E). However, although a few mid-late pachytene spermatocytes were observed, neither metaphase cells nor round spermatids were observed in the testes of the mutant mice at these stages (Fig. 2, D and F). More substantial differences appeared at later stages. The seminiferous tubules of the normal mice were filled with round spermatids at P22 (Fig. 2G) and showed the release of mature spermatozoa into the lumen at P35 (Fig. 2I), but the seminiferous tubules of the mutant mice contained no postmeiotic germ cells, and cells with condensed nuclei and multinucleated cells were frequently observed (Fig. 2, H and J). These findings indicate that the differentiation of most mutant germ cells is interrupted at mid to late pachytene stage of meiosis, although a few meiotic metaphase cells were observed in the seminiferous tubules of the adult mutant mice (Fig. 1B).FIGURE 2First wave of spermatogenesis of the sks and normal mice.

RT-PCR analysis of adult testis of the mutant mice revealed normal expression of the Histh1t gene, significantly reduced Hspa2 and Ccna1 gene expression, and no or trace levels Pou5f2, Hspl1, and Tnp1 gene expression (Fig. 3). The expression of genes that are specifically expressed at stages later than late pachytene stage in normal mice was not detected in the sks/sks mice. These results confirmed that spermatogenesis of the sks/sks mice is arrested at the late pachytene stage. During prophase of meiosis, a homologous chromosomes pair and a SC is formed between the homologous chromosomes. We examined whether pairing of homologous chromosomes and the formation of SC proceeded normally in the sks/sks spermatocytes by immunofluorescence staining using antibodies against SCP3 and γH2AX. SCP3 is a component of the lateral element of SC, and γH2AX is a phosphorylated histone variant that accumulates on the DSB sites and can be used as a maker for asynapsis. The patterns of γH2AX staining in the sks/sks spermatocytes at the leptotene to zygotene stage were similar to those of the normal mice. (data not shown). However, ∼40% of the mutant spermatocytes at the pachytene stage showed apparently different γH2AX staining patterns. As shown in Fig. 4, a γH2AX focus was restricted to the X-Y body in the normal spermatocytes, which represented an unpaired region of the X and Y chromosomes. However, defused γH2AX foci other than the X-Y body were frequently observed in the sks/sks spermatocytes which indicates unrepaired DSBs in autosomes. These spermatocytes with the defused γH2AX foci also showed partial asynapsis of homologous chromosomes that was indicated by SCP3 signals (Fig. 4, A and B). These findings confirmed defects of homologous chromosome paring and synapsis in the spermatocytes of the sks/sks mice as reported previously (6.Handel M.A. Lane P.W. Schroeder A.C. Davisson M.T. New mutation causing sterility in the mouse.Gamete Res. 1988; 21: 409-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We performed fine mapping of the sks locus by linkage analysis to identify the gene responsible for the sks mutation. A total of 532 F2 progeny were obtained from the cross between sks and JF1/Ms mice. As the sks locus has been mapped to a 8-Mb interval of the distal region of mouse chromosome 4, we genotyped 9 microsatellite makers in this region in the 63 sks/sks and 469 unaffected mice. The segregation data of these makers indicated the localization of the sks gene to an ∼0.3-Mb interval between D4Mit31 and D4Mok22 in which nine genes were localized (Fig. 5). We sequenced the entire coding regions of these nine genes: Tceanc2, Tmem59, Ldlrad1, Lrrc42, Hspb11, Dio1, Yipf1, Tmem48, and Gils1. Comparing the nucleotide sequences of these candidate genes in the sks mutant and normal mice revealed no nucleotide sequence differences in these genes except for the Tmem48 gene. However, a remarkable difference was observed in the transcripts of the Tmem48 gene. As shown in Fig. 6A, the amplification of cDNA spanning exon 6 of the gene by RT-PCR yielded a fragment with the expected size (287 bp) in the normal mouse, but the fragment from the mutant mouse was ∼100 bp shorter than the expected size. Comparing the nucleotide sequence of these two transcripts revealed that a 109-bp sequence corresponding to exon 6 of the Tmem48 gene was deleted in the transcripts of the mutant mice. RT-PCR analysis of Tmem48 in several tissues showed that the deletion of exon 6 of Tmem48 transcripts was observed in all of the sks/sks tissues but not the normal tissues, indicating that the deletion of exon 6 is not caused by tissue-specific alternative splicing. The deletion of exon 6 creates a frameshift mutation resulting in premature termination at codon 225. By Western blot analysis using anti-TMEM48 antibody, we confirmed that no mature TMEM48 protein was present in the tissues of sks/sks mice, whereas a protein of 65 kDa was observed in the normal mice (Fig. 6D). To determine the cause of the deletion, we compared the genomic sequence of Tmem48 in the sks mutant and normal mice. Neither deletion of the region containing exon 6 nor mutation at the splicing donor or acceptor sites of the exon was observed, but a nucleotide substitution of GG to TT was found in exon 6 (Fig. 6B). Although the GG to TT substitution is predicted to result in a missense mutation of arginine to leucine, it also occurs in a putative exonic splicing enhancer motif (ESE), which likely explains the aberrant splicing observed in sks mice (Fig. 6C). To confirm that the GG to TT substitution of Tmem48 gene is unique to sks mice and no other gene of the candidate region has nucleotide lesion in the sks mice, we performed whole exome sequencing of sks mouse. Using the data generated from high throughput sequencing of whole exomes, we performed a genome-wide comparison of coding sequence from sks and from a strain background matched control (A/J). This comparison allowed us to eliminate from consideration all strain background-specific SNPs. We also compared these data with a large set (250) of whole exome datasets from unrelated spontaneous mutants and control inbred strains generated by the Jackson Laboratory Mutant Mouse Resour"
https://openalex.org/W2093592740,"Serpin protein protease inhibitors inactivate their target proteases through a unique mechanism in which a major serpin conformational change, resulting in a 70-Å translocation of the protease from its initial reactive center loop docking site to the opposite pole of the serpin, kinetically traps the acyl-intermediate complex. Although the initial Michaelis and final trapped acyl-intermediate complexes have been well characterized structurally, the intermediate stages involved in this remarkable transformation are not well understood. To better characterize such intermediate steps, we undertook rapid kinetic studies of the FRET and fluorescence perturbation changes of site-specific fluorophore-labeled derivatives of the serpin, α1-protease inhibitor (α1PI), which report the serpin and protease conformational changes involved in transforming the Michaelis complex to the trapped acyl-intermediate complex in reactions with trypsin. Two kinetically resolvable conformational changes were observed in the reactions, ascribable to (i) serpin reactive center loop insertion into sheet A with full protease translocation but incomplete protease distortion followed by, (ii) full conformational distortion and movement of the protease and coupled serpin conformational changes involving the F helix-sheet A interface. Kinetic studies of calcium effects on the labeled α1PI-trypsin reactions demonstrated both inactive and low activity states of the distorted protease in the final complex that were distinct from the intermediate distorted state. These studies provide new insights into the nature of the serpin and protease conformational changes involved in trapping the acyl-intermediate complex in serpin-protease reactions and support a previously proposed role for helix F in the trapping mechanism."

This enzyme has an Asp-194 catalytic nucleophile and two catalytically unrelated Cys residues, Cys-129 and Cys-532. Cys-free SmDG was constructed by replacement with Ser (C129S/C532S (2CS), the activity of which was the same as that of the wild type, SmDG). The nucleophile mutant of 2CS was generated by substitution of Asp-194 with Cys (D194C-2CS). The hydrolytic activity of D194C-2CS was 8.1 × 10(-4) % of 2CS. KI-associated oxidation of D194C-2CS increased the activity up to 0.27% of 2CS, which was 330 times higher than D194C-2CS. Peptide-mapping mass analysis of the oxidized D194C-2CS (Ox-D194C-2CS) revealed that Cys-194 was converted into cysteine sulfinate. Ox-D194C-2CS and 2CS shared the same properties (optimum pH, pI, and substrate specificity), whereas Ox-D194C-2CS had much higher transglucosylation activity than 2CS. This is the first study indicating that a more acidic nucleophile (-SOO(-)) enhances transglycosylation. The introduction of cysteine sulfinate as a catalytic nucleophile could be a novel approach to enhance transglycosylation."
https://openalex.org/W2049530810,"The melanization reaction promoted by the prophenoloxidase-activating system is an essential defense response in invertebrates subjected to regulatory mechanisms that are still not fully understood. We report here the finding and characterization of a novel trypsin inhibitor, named panulirin, isolated from the hemocytes of the spiny lobster Panulirus argus with regulatory functions on the melanization cascade. Panulirin is a cationic peptide (pI 9.5) composed of 48 amino acid residues (5.3 kDa), with six cysteine residues forming disulfide bridges. Its primary sequence was determined by combining Edman degradation/N-terminal sequencing and electrospray ionization-MS/MS spectrometry. The low amino acid sequence similarity with known proteins indicates that it represents a new family of peptidase inhibitors. Panulirin is a competitive and reversible tight-binding inhibitor of trypsin (Ki = 8.6 nm) with a notable specificity because it does not inhibit serine peptidases such as subtilisin, elastase, chymotrypsin, thrombin, and plasmin. The removal of panulirin from the lobster hemocyte lysate leads to an increase in phenoloxidase response to LPS. Likewise, the addition of increasing concentrations of panulirin to a lobster hemocyte lysate, previously depleted of trypsin-inhibitory activity, decreased the phenoloxidase response to LPS in a concentration-dependent fashion. These results indicate that panulirin is implicated in the regulation of the melanization cascade in P. argus by inhibiting peptidase(s) in the pathway toward the activation of the prophenoloxidase enzyme."
