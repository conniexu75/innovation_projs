https://openalex.org/W1990962430,"Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated γ-secretase is a presenilin (PS)- dependent proteolytic activity involved in the intramembraneous cleavage of the β-amyloid precursor protein, Notch, LDL receptor-related protein, E-cadherin, and ErbB-4. This cut produces the corresponding intracellular domains (ICD), which are required for nuclear signaling of Notch and probably ErbB-4, the β-amyloid precursor protein, E-cadherin, and the LDL receptor-related protein as well. We have now investigated CD44, a cell surface adhesion molecule, which also undergoes an intramembraneous cleavage to liberate its ICD. We demonstrate that this cleavage requires a PS-dependent γ-secretase activity. A loss-of-function PS1 mutation, a PS1/PS2 knockout, as well as two independent and highly specific γ-secretase inhibitors, abolish this cleavage. Surprisingly, small peptides similar to the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) are generated by an additional cut in the middle of the transmembrane region of CD44. Like Aβ, these CD44 β-peptides are generated in a PS-dependent manner. These findings therefore suggest a dual intramembraneous cleavage mechanism mediated by PS proteins. The dual cleavage mechanism is required for nuclear signaling as well as removal of remaining transmembrane domains, a general function of PS in membrane protein metabolism.

Intramembraneous proteolysis has been long thought to be an exceptional biochemical pathway involved in the pathological generation of Aβ 1The abbreviations used are: Aβ, amyloid β-peptide; AD, Alzheimer's disease; βAPP, β-amyloid precursor protein; AICD, APP intracellular domain; CD44-ICD, CD44 intracellular domain; CTF, C-terminal fragment; DAPT, N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycinet-butyl ester; HEK, human embryonic kidney; ICD, intracellular domain; IDE, insulin-degrading enzyme; LRP, LDL receptor-related protein; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; NICD, Notch intracellular domain; PS, presenilin; TMD, transmembrane domain; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy- 1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. (1Esler W.P. Wolfe M.S. Science. 2001; 293: 1449-1454Google Scholar). However, intramembraneous processing of membrane-bound proteins has now been demonstrated to play an important physiological role in regulated nuclear signaling (2Ebinu J.O. Yankner B.A. Neuron. 2002; 34: 499-502Google Scholar). Currently three such proteolytic pathways are known, PS-dependent intramembraneous proteolysis (3Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 217-224Google Scholar), site 2 protease-mediated cleavage (4Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Google Scholar), and rhomboid-mediated proteolysis (5Lee J.R. Urban S. Garvey C.F. Freeman M. Cell. 2001; 107: 161-171Google Scholar,6Urban S. Lee J.R. Freeman M. Cell. 2001; 107: 173-182Google Scholar). The PS-dependent γ-secretase cleavage is of pivotal importance for Aβ generation (3Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 217-224Google Scholar). Aβ is physiologically produced from the β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) through an initial β-secretase cleavage followed by the intramembraneous γ-secretase cut (7Vassar R. Citron M. Neuron. 2000; 27: 419-422Google Scholar). The resulting peptide is secreted and deposited in the AD-defining amyloid plaques. A knockout of the two homologousPS1 and PS2 genes fully abolishes Aβ generation (8Herreman A. Serneels L. Annaert W. Collen D. Schoonjans L. De Strooper B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 461-462Google Scholar, 9Zhang Z. Nadeau P. Song W. Donoviel D. Yuan M. Bernstein A. Yankner B.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 463-465Google Scholar). Furthermore, highly specific γ-secretase inhibitors bind to PSs (10Li Y.M. Xu M. Lai M.T. Huang Q. Castro J.L. DiMuzio-Mower J. Harrison T. Lellis C. Nadin A. Neduvelli J.G. Register R.B.

Rahmati T. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 428-433Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of two conserved critical aspartate residues within transmembrane domains (TMD) 6 and 7 of PS1 and PS2 also blocks γ-secretase function (12Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Google Scholar, 13Steiner H. Duff K. Capell A. Romig H. Grim M.G. Lincoln S. Hardy J. Yu X. Picciano M. Fechteler K. Citron M. Kopan R. Pesold B. Keck S. Baader M. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. Baumeister R. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28669-28673Google Scholar), which indicates that PSs may contain an intrinsic aspartyl protease activity responsible for the γ-secretase cut (14Wolfe M.S. De Los Angeles J. Miller D.D. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11223-11230Google Scholar). Indeed, we have identified a novel active site motif in all PSs (15Steiner H. Kostka M. Romig H. Basset G. Pesold B. Hardy J. Capell A. Meyn L. Grim M.G. Baumeister R. Fechteler K. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 848-851Google Scholar), which is also present in polytopic bacterial aspartyl proteases called type 4 prepilin peptidases (16LaPointe C.F. Taylor R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1502-1510Google Scholar). Very recently this finding was confirmed by the identification of the same motif in the signal peptide peptidase SPP, another polytopic aspartyl protease (17Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Google Scholar). However, increasing evidence indicates that γ-secretase activity resides in a high molecular weight complex (18Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6138-6143Google Scholar) composed of PS (19Capell A. Grunberg J.

Priess J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 775-779Google Scholar). PSs also play a major role in Notch signaling (3Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 217-224Google Scholar). Deletion of thePS1 gene in mice causes a phenocopy of a Notch knockout (28Wong P.C. Zheng H. Chen H. Becher M.W. Sirinathsinghji D.J. Trumbauer M.E. Chen H.Y. Price D.L. Van der Ploeg L.H. Sisodia S.S. Nature. 1997; 387: 288-292Google Scholar). This is due to a lack of nuclear signaling via the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) (29De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan R. Nature. 1999; 398: 518-522Google Scholar). NICD is liberated by the PS-dependent γ-secretase and targeted to the nucleus where it regulates gene transcription. βAPP itself may also provide a precursor for the production of a cytoplasmic fragment involved in nuclear signaling (30Cao X. Südhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Google Scholar). Indeed it has recently been demonstrated that the βAPP intracellular domain (AICD) is generated by a very similar proteolytic mechanism like NICD (31Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 835-841Google Scholar, 32Yu C. Kim S.H. Ikeuchi T. Xu H. Gasparini L. Wang R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol.

Paliga K. Baier G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Evin G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2825-2835Google Scholar). In addition, LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) (35May P. Reddy Y.K. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18736-18743Google Scholar), E-cadherin (36Marambaud P. Shioi J. Serban G. Georgakopoulos A. Sarner S. Nagy V. Baki L. Wen P. Efthimiopoulos S. Shao Z. Wisniewski T. Robakis N.K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1948-1956Google Scholar), and ErbB-4 (37Ni C.Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Google Scholar,38Lee H.-J. Jung K.-M. Huang Y.Z. Bennett L.B. Lee J.S. Mei L. Kim T.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6318-6323Google Scholar) have also been shown to undergo PS-dependent endpoproteolysis resulting in the liberation of their ICDs, which may be involved in nuclear signaling as well. However, the cleavage, which liberates such ICDs takes place at a topologically different site as the cut, which generates Aβ (see Fig. 1 A). Moreover, secreted peptides similar to Aβ have so far not been observed to be generated from any of the PS substrates other than βAPP. This may suggest that biochemically different mechanisms are involved in intramembraneous proteolysis leading to ICD liberation and the production of Aβ-like peptides (32Yu C. Kim S.H. Ikeuchi T. Xu H. Gasparini L. Wang R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43756-43760Google Scholar), a hypothesis that may exclude a direct function of PSs in γ-secretase processing. Identification of PS substrates is of pivotal importance for the development of safe γ-secretase inhibitors. In that regard it has been shown that γ-secretase inhibitors not only block Aβ generation but also severely interfere with T-lymphocyte differentiation in cultured cells (39Hadland B. Manley N.

A. 2001; 98: 9312-9317Google Scholar) and lateral inhibition in zebrafish (Danio rerio) (41Geling A. Steiner H. Willem M. Bally-Cuif L. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 688-694Google Scholar). Very recently CD44, a cell surface adhesion protein, has been shown to undergo an intramembraneous cleavage, which results in the generation of CD44-ICD (42Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Murakami D. Sasayama T. Araki N. Miki T. Wong A.J. Saya H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 755-762Google Scholar). CD44-ICD is targeted to the nucleus where it regulates genes containing TPA-responsive elements (42Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Murakami D. Sasayama T. Araki N. Miki T. Wong A.J. Saya H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 755-762Google Scholar). Based on the inhibition of this cleavage by MG132, an unspecific proteasome inhibitor (43Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Google Scholar), which also blocks β- and γ-secretase (44Steinhilb M.L. Turner R.S. Gaut J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4476-4484Google Scholar), it has been hypothesized that CD44-ICD generation could be mediated by γ-secretase (42Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Murakami D. Sasayama T. Araki N. Miki T. Wong A.J. Saya H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 755-762Google Scholar). However, as described above at least three different intramembraneous cleavage mechanisms are currently known and evidence for a PS-dependent CD44-ICD generation is missing. We therefore investigated if inactivation of PS function through highly selective inhibitors, a complete knockout of PS genes, or a dominant negative PS1 mutation affects CD44-ICD production. Upon demonstration of a PS-dependent CD44-ICD generation, we further found that a second PS-dependent γ-secretase cut located in the middle of the TMD liberates a small and hydrophobic peptide similar to Aβ. Therefore our data suggest a novel function of PSs in TMD removal. Moreover, our findings demonstrate very similar mechanisms of βAPP and CD44 γ-secretase processing and therefore further support a direct role of PSs in intramembraneous proteolysis. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 200 μg/ml zeocin to select for PS1 expression. Immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblast cells derived from PS1+/+/PS2+/+ or PS1−/−/PS2−/− mice were cultured as described previously (23Edbauer D. Winkler E. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8666-8671Google Scholar). Transfections were carried out using FuGENE 6 for HEK293 cells (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) or LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) for mouse embryonic fibroblasts according to the supplier's instructions. A full-length CD44 construct with a C-terminal Myc epitope tag was generated by PCR using a human brain cDNA library (Clontech) and the following primers: CD44FL forward, cgcaagcttccggacaccatggacaagttttgg and CD44FL reverse, cgcctcgagtcaCAGATCCTCTTCTGAGATGAGTTTTTGTTCcaccccaatcttcatgtcc. Capital letters denote the C-terminal Myc epitope tag. The PCR product was subcloned into the HindIII/XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1/Hygro(+) (Invitrogen). The CD44ΔE and CD44ΔE-FLAG constructs were generated by PCR using the following primers: CD44ΔE forward, cgcaagcttcaagaaggtggagcaaac or CD44ΔE-FLAG forward, cgcaagcttGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAGcaagaaggtggagcaaac, respectively and CD44ΔE reverse, ccgctcgagccaccccaatcttcatgtcc and subcloned into theHindIII/XhoI sites of pSecTag2/HygroB (Invitrogen). Capital letters denote the N-terminal FLAG-epitope-tag. The resulting cDNA constructs were sequenced for verification. The monoclonal antibody 9E10 to the Myc epitope was obtained from the hybridoma bank. Anti-FLAG-M2-agarose, anti-Myc-agarose and the monoclonal FLAG-M2 antibody were from Sigma. HEK293 cells or HEK293 cells stably expressing wild type PS1 or PS1 D385N were transiently transfected with cDNA encoding CD44FL. 24 h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for CD44FL by immunoblotting with antibody 9E10. Detection was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). HEK293 cells stably expressing wild type PS1 or PS1 D385N were grown on poly-l-lysine coated 6-cm dishes. 6 h after transfection of the cells with CD44ΔE or CD44ΔE-FLAG, cells were incubated for 15 h in DMEM containing 1 μm DAPT, 5 μm L-685,458, or Me2SO as vehicle. In order to detect CD44 β-peptides, media were collected, cleared from debris by centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG-M2-agarose for 4 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10–20% Tris-Tricine gels (Invitrogen), and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were boiled for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline, probed with antibody FLAG-M2, and developed using Western Star (Tropix). For detection of CD44-ICD, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline subjected to SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted with antibody 9E10, and analyzed for CD44-ICD as described above. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were cultured in 10-cm dishes, and CD44-ICD and CD44-β were detected as described for HEK293 cells. CD44-ICD was generatedin vitro as previously described for the generation of AICD (31Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 835-841Google Scholar) except that both homogenization buffer and assay buffer were supplemented with 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm1,10-phenanthroline, and 10 μm lactacystin. Following SDS-PAGE, CD44-ICD was analyzed by immunoblotting with 9E10 as described above. Cell lines transiently expressing CD44ΔE-FLAG were grown to confluency in 10-cm dishes. Media were replaced with 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and were incubated for 3 h. From four dishes, 20 ml of conditioned media were collected, immediately put on ice, and subjected to a clarifying spin. Following addition of a protease inhibitor mix (1:1000, Sigma) and 0.025% sodium azide, conditioned media were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG-M2-agarose for 4 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times for 10 min at 4 °C with wash buffer 1 (0.1% n-octylglucoside, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.025% sodium azide) and once with wash buffer 2 (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.025% sodium azide). Immunoprecipitated peptides were eluted with trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile/water (1:20:20) saturated with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. The dissolved samples were dried on a stainless plate and subjected to MALDI-TOF MS analysis. The MS peak heights and molecular masses were calibrated with angiotensin (Sigma) and bovine insulin β-chain (Sigma). The cell surface protein CD44 was previously shown to undergo ectodomain shedding in various cancer cell lines to produce a membrane-anchored C-terminal fragment (CTF) (45Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Tsuiki H. Sasaki J. Nakao M. Matsumoto M. Suga M. Ando M. Nakajima M. Saya H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1435-1446Google Scholar). Very recently it was demonstrated that this CTF could further be proteolytically cleaved within the transmembrane region very close to the putative cytoplasmic border to liberate CD44-ICD from the membrane (42Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Murakami D. Sasayama T. Araki N. Miki T. Wong A.J. Saya H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 755-762Google Scholar). Thus this cut is reminiscent to the PS/γ-secretase-dependent generation of AICD (Fig. 1 A). We therefore investigated whether intramembraneous proteolytic processing of CD44 is dependent on PS activity. HEK293 cells express endogenous PS-dependent γ-secretase activity and have been widely used to investigate PS-dependent processing of βAPP (15Steiner H. Kostka M. Romig H. Basset G. Pesold B.

Kim T.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6318-6323Google Scholar), E-cadherin (36Marambaud P. Shioi J. Serban G. Georgakopoulos A. Sarner S. Nagy V. Baki L. Wen P. Efthimiopoulos S. Shao Z. Wisniewski T. Robakis N.K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1948-1956Google Scholar), and Notch (13Steiner H. Duff K. Capell A. Romig H. Grim M.G. Lincoln S. Hardy J. Yu X. Picciano M. Fechteler K. Citron M. Kopan R. Pesold B. Keck S. Baader M. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. Baumeister R. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28669-28673Google Scholar). Therefore we transiently transfected HEK293 cells or HEK293 cells stably expressing either wild type PS1 or the biologically inactive mutant PS1 D385N (12Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Google Scholar) with a cDNA construct encoding C-terminal Myc-tagged full-length CD44 (CD44FL) (Fig. 1 B). CD44FL is expressed as a 90–100 kDa protein in transfected cells (Fig.2). Additionally, we observed a robust accumulation of a protein species of ∼25 kDa in cells expressing the non-functional dominant negative mutant PS1 D385N (Fig. 2). This protein most likely corresponds to the C-terminal fragment of CD44 (CD44-CTF) derived by ectodomain cleavage (42Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Murakami D. Sasayama T. Araki N. Miki T. Wong A.J. Saya H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 755-762Google Scholar). In contrast almost no CD44-CTF was observed in HEK293 cells or cells expressing wild type PS1 (Fig. 2). This result is reminiscent to the effect of biologically inactive PS1 on the accumulation of βAPP-CTFs (12Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Google Scholar) and NotchΔE (41Geling A. Steiner H. Willem M. Bally-Cuif L. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 688-694Google Scholar). The accumulation of CD44-CTF in the presence of a non-functional PS1 variant thus suggests that CD44 is a physiological substrate for PS-mediated γ-secretase processing. Next we investigated if the massive accumulation of CD44-CTF in the presence of the non-functional PS1 D385N mutation also results in a concomitant decrease of CD44-ICD. Therefore HEK293 cells stably expressing wild type PS1 or PS1 D385N were transiently transfected with CD44ΔE (Fig. 1 B), which mimics the product of the ectodomain-shedded CD44 and is reminiscent to the constitutively active NotchΔE frequently used to monitor PS-dependent Notch endoproteolysis (47Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Google Scholar). Consistent with Okamoto et al. (42Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Murakami D. Sasayama T. Araki N. Miki T. Wong A.J. Saya H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 755-762Google Scholar) we obtained proteins with a molecular mass of 25–30 kDa upon expression of CD44ΔE. These fragments accumulated to high levels either in the presence of the non-functional PS1 D385N mutant or in wild type PS1-expressing cells treated with specific γ-secretase inhibitors (48Dovey H.F.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8698-8704Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 A,upper panels). This observation is reminiscent of the accumulation of βAPP-CTFs upon γ-secretase inhibitor treatment (31Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 835-841Google Scholar). Consistent with previous results (42Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Murakami D. Sasayama T. Araki N. Miki T. Wong A.J. Saya H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 755-762Google Scholar), immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with anti-Myc-agarose resulted in the detection of CD44-ICD (Fig.3 A,lower panels). CD44-ICD generation is PS-dependent, since this fragment was not detectable in cells expressing the non-functional mutant PS1 D385N (Fig.3 A,lower panels). Moreover the generation of CD44-ICD was also inhibited in the presence of two highly specific γ-secretase inhibitors, DAPT (48Dovey H.F. John V. Anderson J.P. Chen L.Z. de Saint Andrieu P. Fang L.Y. Freedman S.B. Folmer B. Goldbach E. Holsztynska E.J. Hu K.L. Johnson-Wood K.L. Kennedy S.L. Kholodenko D. Knops J.E. Latimer L.H. Lee M. Liao Z. Lieberburg I.M. Motter R.N. Mutter L.C. Nietz J.

Neurochem. 2001; 76: 173-181Google Scholar) and L-685,458 (49Shearman M.S. Beher D. Clarke E.E. Lewis H.D. Harrison T. Hunt P. Nadin A. Smith A.L. Stevenson G. Castro J.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8698-8704Google Scholar) (Fig.3 A,lower panels). These results were confirmed by a previously established in vitro assay for PS-dependent AICD generation (31Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 835-841Google Scholar). Membranes were prepared from HEK293 cells transiently expressing CD44ΔE and incubated either at 4 or 37 °C. As shown in Fig.3 B incubation of membranes at 37 °C led to the production of CD44-ICD. When L-685,458 was added to inhibit PS-dependent γ-secretase activity no CD44-ICD was observed (Fig. 3 B). Moreover, CD44-ICD was also not produced when membranes isolated from HEK293 cells expressing PS1 D385N were used in the in vitro assay (Fig. 3 B). The lack of CD44-ICD production upon interference with PS activity thus unequivocally proves that CD44 is a novel substrate for PS-mediated γ-secretase activity. Intramembraneous proteolysis of βAPP not only results in the generation of AICD via a cleavage close to the cytoplasmic site of the TMD, but also in the generation of Aβ by an additional cut in the middle of the TMD (Fig. 1 A). We therefore investigated if we could detect the N-terminal counterpart of CD44-ICD in conditioned media similar to Aβ. To do so we transiently transfected cells either expressing wild type PS1 or PS1 D385N with an N-terminal FLAG-tagged and C-terminal Myc-tagged CD44ΔE construct (CD44ΔE-FLAG) (Fig.1 B). As expected expression of CD44ΔE-FLAG led to CD44-CTFs of the expected slightly higher molecular mass compared with the expression of CD44ΔE (Fig. 4,upper panels). Conditioned media of transfected cells treated with or without γ-secretase inhibitors were precipitated with anti-FLAG-M2-agarose. As shown in Fig. 4, we observed a triplet of peptides with a molecular weight around 5 kDa (hereafter called CD44-β) in cells expressing endogenous or ectopic wild type PS1, suggesting heterogeneous processing. In conditioned media from cells expressing CD44ΔE no such peptides were detected demonstrating the specific isolation of CD44-β (Fig. 4, lower panels). The generation of CD44-β is PS-dependent, because cells expressing the non-functional PS1 D385N mutant secreted no CD44-β (Fig. 4, lower panels). In addition, treatment with the γ-secretase inhibitors DAPT (48Dovey H.F. John V. Anderson J.P. Chen L.Z. de Saint Andrieu P. Fang L.Y. Freedman S.B. Folmer B. Goldbach E. Holsztynska E.J. Hu K.L.

Johnstone E.M. Li W.Y. Little S.P. Mabry T.E. Miller F.D. Audia J.E. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 173-181Google Scholar) or L-685,458 (49Shearman M.S. Beher D. Clarke E.E. Lewis H.D. Harrison T. Hunt P. Nadin A. Smith A.L. Stevenson G. Castro J.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8698-8704Google Scholar) also significantly reduced the production of CD44-β (Fig. 4, lower panels). To further demonstrate that PSs are absolutely required for the generation of CD44-ICD and CD44-β we analyzed the production of both CD44-species in embryonic fibroblasts derived from PS1+/+/PS2+/+ or PS1−/−/PS2−/− mice transiently transfected with CD44ΔE-FLAG. As expected, CD44-ICD and CD44-β are generated in PS1+/+/PS2+/+ cells whereas ablation of PS1 and PS2 results in a robust accumulation of CD44ΔE-CTF (Fig.5). PSs are essential for the generation of CD44-ICD and of CD44-β, since both cleavage products could not be observed in cells derived from PS1−/−/PS2−/− mice (Fig. 5). Moreover, the generation of both CD44-ICD and CD44-β in PS1+/+/PS2+/+ cells is blocked in the presence of the γ-secretase inhibitor L-685,458 (49Shearman M.S. Beher D. Clarke E.E. Lewis H.D. Harrison T. Hunt P. Nadin A. Smith A.L. Stevenson G. Castro J.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8698-8704Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). Taken together the above findings provide unequivocal evidence for a PS-dependent generation of CD44-ICD and CD44-β. In order to determine the cleavage site, which results in the release of CD44-β we performed MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using immunoprecipitated CD44-β. This revealed a major peptide species with a molecular mass of 4385 Da (Fig.6 A). Computer-based analysis revealed that the proteolytic cleavage, which results in the secretion of this peptide occurs between Ala278 and Leu279 (Fig. 6 B) in cells expressing endogenous or ectopic wild type PS1. Similar to the heterogeneous γ-secretase generated Aβ additional peptides were observed (Fig. 6, Aand B). All peptides were generated by a PS-dependent activity, since the corresponding peaks were not observed upon expression of PS1 D385N (Fig. 6 A,inset). Thus, like βAPP (31Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 835-841Google Scholar, 32Yu C. Kim S.H. Ikeuchi T. Xu H. Gasparini L. Wang R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol.

Paliga K. Baier G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Evin G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2825-2835Google Scholar), CD44 is cleaved at two topologically different sites within the TMD (Fig.7). Both cleavages are dependent on PS function, since the γ-secretase inhibitors DAPT and L-685,458, and the biologically inactive PS1 D385N mutant inhibit formation of CD44-β and of CD44-ICD. This suggests a dual cleavage mechanism directly mediated by a PS1-dependent γ-secretase activity.Figure 7Schematic representation of the transmembrane region of CD44 and βAPP with the indicated cleavage sites for PS-dependent γ-secretase activity. Arrowsindicate the cleavage site liberating AICD or CD44-ICD.Arrowheads indicate the cleavage sites located in the middle of the transmembrane for the generation of Aβ40 and Aβ42 or for the novel cleavage site for CD44.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Overall, our data demonstrate that intramembraneous processing of CD44 occurs by a PS-dependent γ-secretase activity at two topologically different sites (summarized in Fig. 7). One cleavage (close to the cytoplasmic border) liberates CD44-ICD for putative nuclear signaling, the other cut (in the middle of the TMD predominantly between Ala278 and Leu279) splits the TMD and results in the secretion of a peptide similar to Aβ. Cleavage close to the cytosolic border of the TMD results in the generation of CD44-ICD. This cut is remarkably similar to AICD and NICD generation, since it not only occurs at a topologically similar site but it is also fully PS-dependent. This is demonstrated by the inhibition of CD44-ICD generation through DAPT, L-685,458, and by a dominant negative mutation of PS1. Moreover no CD44-ICD could be detected in PS 1/2 double knockout cells. DAPT and L-685,458 specifically inhibit the γ-secretase in cultured cells and in vivo (48Dovey H.F. John V. Anderson J.P.

Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan R. Nature. 1999; 398: 518-522Google Scholar, 50Martys-Zage J.L. Kim S.H. Berechid B. Bingham S.J.

Bally-Cuif L. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 688-694Google Scholar). Therefore several substrates for the PS-dependent γ-secretase have now been identified: βAPP (and its homologues) (1Esler W.P. Wolfe M.S. Science. 2001; 293: 1449-1454Google Scholar), Notch1–4 (29De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A.

Interestingly, all of these are type 1 transmembrane proteins. Moreover, they all undergo ectodomain shedding, which apparently is a prerequisite for the subsequent γ-secretase cleavage. The resulting cytoplasmic domains may then be targeted to the nucleus where they could regulate transcription of selective target genes (2Ebinu J.O. Yankner B.A. Neuron. 2002; 34: 499-502Google Scholar, 3Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 217-224Google Scholar). Nuclear targeting may require binding of additional cofactors and the efficiency of nuclear targeting appears to be very different for all known ICDs. Whereas NICD can be detected in large amounts within the nucleus (54Moehlmann T. Winkler E. Xia X. Edbauer D. Murrell J. Capell A. Kaether C. Zheng H. Ghetti B. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8025-8030Google Scholar, 55Song W. Nadeau P. Yuan M. Yang X. Shen J. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6959-6963Google Scholar),in vivo produced authentic AICD has so far not been detected within nuclei. Moreover, natural target genes have so far been identified only for CD44 (42Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Murakami D. Sasayama T. Araki N. Miki T. Wong A.J. Saya H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 755-762Google Scholar) and Notch1 (47Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Google Scholar). In all cases the intramembraneous cleavage leading to ICD generation seems to take place close to the cytoplasmic domain. PS-dependent ICD generation occurs constitutively immediately after ectodomain shedding. This raises the question how nuclear signaling of the different ICDs is regulated. Up- or down-regulation of PS genes has so far not been reported. Moreover, artificial overexpression of PSs by transfection does not lead to substantially higher PS levels since only endogenous PSs are replaced by the overexpressed variant (56Thinakaran G. Harris C.L. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Slunt H.H. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28415-28422Google Scholar). This may also be the case for other components of the PS/γ-secretase complex such as nicastrin (22Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S. Levitan D. Zhang L. Tandon A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Chen F. Kawarai T. Supala A. Levesque L. Yu H. Yang D.S. Holmes E. Milman P. Liang Y. Zhang D.M. Xu D.H. Sato C. Rogaev E. Smith M. Janus C. Zhang Y. Aebersold R. Farrer L.S. Sorbi S. Bruni A. Fraser P.

Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Diehl T.S. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2720-2725Google Scholar). It appears therefore that the activity of ICDs like that of conventional transcription factors may be regulated by proteolytic degradation. In fact, NICD (57Oberg C. Li J. Pauley A. Wolf E. Gurney M. Lendahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35847-35853Google Scholar, 58Gupta-Rossi N. Le Bail O. Gonen H. Brou C. Logeat F. Six E. Ciechanover A. Israel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34371-34378Google Scholar) and LRP-ICD (35May P. Reddy Y.K. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18736-18743Google Scholar) have been shown to be degraded by the proteasome whereas AICD is predominantly removed by a metalloprotease activity, most likely IDE (59Edbauer D. Willem M. Lammich S. Steiner H. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13389-13393Google Scholar). In addition to ICD generation we also found a PS-dependent production of Aβ-like CD44 peptides, which we called CD44-β. MALDI-TOF MS revealed that these peptides are generated by cleavage within the middle of the TMD. This cut is apparently homologous to the cleavages, which lead to the secretion of the two major Aβ species (Fig. 7). Our findings therefore reveal a remarkably similar intramembraneous cleavage mechanism of βAPP and CD44. Moreover, we have recently identified a secreted Notch peptide, which also resembles Aβ and CD44-β (60Okochi M. Steiner H. Fukumori A. Tanii H. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. Kudo T. Haass C. Takeda M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5408-5416Google Scholar). Therefore we identified a dual intramembraneous cut mediated by a PS-dependent γ-secretase activity. Apparently one cut allows the generation of ICDs, which may be involved in nuclear signaling. The other cut, which occurs within the middle of the TMD allows the efficient removal of the remaining membrane associated stub. Thus we propose that PS-mediated endoproteolysis is required at least in some cases for nuclear signaling but also for the general clearance of TMDs. This is supported by the finding that even artificial TMDs may allow γ-secretase processing in cultured cells (61Zhang J. Ye W. Wang R. Wolfe M.S. Greenberg B.D. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15069-15075Google Scholar) and in Drososphila (62Struhl G. Adachi A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 625-636Google Scholar). We thank Drs. Bart De Strooper and Paul Saftig for PS knockout cells."
https://openalex.org/W1988284222,"Upon termination of bone matrix synthesis, osteoblasts either undergo apoptosis or differentiate into osteocytes or bone lining cells. In this study, we investigated the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and growth factors in the differentiation of osteoblasts into osteocytes and in osteoblast apoptosis. The mouse osteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1 and primary mouse calvarial osteoblasts were either grown on two-dimensional (2-D) collagen-coated surfaces, where they morphologically resemble flattened, cuboidal bone lining cells, or embedded in three-dimensional (3-D) collagen gels, where they resemble dendritic osteocytes constituting a network of cells. When MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts were grown in a 3-D matrix in the presence of an MMP inhibitor (GM6001), the cell number was dose-dependently reduced by approximately 50%, whereas no effect was observed on a 2-D substratum. In contrast, the murine mature osteocyte cell line, MLO-Y4, was unaffected by GM6001 under all culture conditions. According to TUNEL assay, the osteoblast apoptosis was increased 2.5-fold by 10 μm GM6001. To investigate the mechanism by which MMPs mediate the survival of osteoblasts, we examined the effect of GM6001 on MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts in the presence of extracellular matrix components and growth factors, including tenascin, fibronectin, laminin, collagenase-cleaved collagen, gelatin, parathyroid hormone, basic fibroblast growth factor, vascular epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, interleukin-1, and latent and active transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Only active TGF-β, but not latent TGF-β or other agents tested, restored cell number and apoptosis to control levels. Furthermore, we found that the membrane type MMP, MT1-MMP, which is produced by osteoblasts, could activate latent TGF-β and that antibodies neutralizing endogenous TGF-β led to a similar decrease in cell number as GM6001. Whereas inhibitors of other protease families did not induce osteoblast apoptosis, an inhibitor of the p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase showed the same but non-synergetic effect as GM6001. These findings suggest that MMP-activated TGF-β maintains osteoblast survival during trans-differentiation into osteocytes by a p44/42-dependent pathway.

The skeleton is a dynamic tissue that is continuously remodeling to sustain calcium homeostasis, repair microfractures, and react to strain and stress of the skeleton. The remodeling process is a complex process and relies on the coupling between bone resorption and formation that involves osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes. The constant regeneration of bone emphasizes the delicate balance between bone resorption and bone formation, which otherwise may lead to pathological conditions such as osteoporosis or osteopetrosis. The investigation of the cellular actions of the major players of bone remodeling may therefore contribute significantly to the discovery of new and better drugs for the treatment of osteoporosis (1Weinstein R.S.

The major pharmaceutical interventions for treatment and prevention of osteoporosis have focused on reduction of osteoclast numbers and their resorptive activity. However, osteoporotic patients with a very low bone mass who already have passed below the threshold for fractures are unlikely to rise above this critical limit by intervention with an anti-resorptive therapy. As a consequence, an increasing number of studies have investigated the regulation of bone matrix synthesis, a complex interplay of osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts in the so-called basic multicellular unit (2Parfitt A.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). The rate of supply of new osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and the timing of the death of osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts by apoptosis are critical determinants of the initiation of new basic multicellular units and the extension or reduction of the lifetime of existing ones (1Weinstein R.S. Manolagas S.C. Am. J. Med. 2000; 108: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Of particular interest for the regulation of anabolic processes in bone are the effect of growth factors and cytokines produced in the bone microenvironment on osteoblast apoptosis (3Manolagas S.C.

Res. 1998; 13: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). In vivo, 50–70% of all osteoblasts initially present during human bone remodeling cannot be accounted for by subsequent transformation into bone lining cells or osteocytes (6Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Bellido T. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Therefore it is hypothesized that many osteoblasts undergo apoptosis upon finished bone matrix synthesis (6Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Bellido T. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), and a small shift in this delicate balance, by e.g. a specific therapeutic intervention, leading to more living osteocytes, could result in increased bone mass and reduced fracture risk.

To investigate the complex interplay of proteases and growth factors involved in osteoblast differentiation into osteocytes and apoptosis, we employed a cell culture assay in three-dimensional (3-D) type I collagen gels, which allow investigation of physiological interactions between cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules more closely than traditional in vitro monolayer cultures (10Bouvier M.

In this study, we have investigated in more detail the proteases and growth factors involved in controlling osteoblast fate, when osteoblasts have stopped synthesizing new bone matrix and therefore are forced to trans-differentiate into osteocytes or bone lining cells or to die by apoptosis. The mouse osteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1 (MC) was routinely maintained and passaged in growth medium consisting of αMEM (Invitrogen) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). The mouse osteocyte cell line MLO-Y4 (21Bonewald L.F. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 1999; 17: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 22Cheng B. Kato Y. Zhao S. Luo J. Sprague E. Bonewald L.F. Jiang J.X. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3464-3473Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by L. Bonewald, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX) was routinely maintained on collagen-coated dishes in αMEM supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum, 2.5% calf serum (Invitrogen, #26170-043), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). For experiments, MC cells were plated for cultivation in two dimensions (2-D) at a density of 30,000 cells per cm2 into 96-well tissue culture plates (Costar). Alternatively, the cells were seeded for cultivation in 3-D collagen I gel (Nitta Collagen) or Matrigel (R&D Systems) at 1 × 105 cells/ml, and cultured in 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum in α-MEM for 5 days unless otherwise mentioned. Unless otherwise indicated, growth factors and inhibitors were added at the time of plating into the culture medium at the following concentrations: TGF-β1 (R&D Systems) at 2.5 ng/ml, basic fibroblast growth factor (R&D Systems) at 2 ng/ml, PTH (R&D Systems) at 10 nm, GM6001 (AM Scientific) at 10 μm, aprotinin (Calbiochem) at 10 μm, pepstatin (Calbiochem) at 10 μm, and E-64 (Calbiochem) at 10 μm. Primary mouse osteoblasts were isolated from 1-day-old mouse calvarias, cultured for 7 days, and used for experiments (23Sprague S.M. Krieger N.S. Bushinsky D.A. Kidney Int. 1994; 46: 1199-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To quantify the cell number, the Alamar Blue assay (Trek Diagnostics) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Annexin, 4′,6-diamidine-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and propidium iodide assays, MC cells were seeded as described under cell culture and stained according to the manufacturer's description by the Annexin-V-FLOUS staining kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, catalog no. 1858777). For detection of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), the MC cells were cultured on chamber slides, fixed in 4% formaldehyde, and dehydrated in a sucrose gradient. Samples were frozen at −80 °C until sectioning in a cryostat at −20 °C. Sections were mounted on coverslips and stained according to the manufacturer's descriptions by the in situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, catalog no. 1684809). Human pro-MMP-2 was a kind gift from Drs. F. Frankenne and J. M. Foidart (University of Liege, Belgium). Mouse pro-MMP-9 was purified from cell culture media of transformed baby hamster kidney cells, by means of two consecutive chromatographic steps on gelatin-Sepharose and concanavalin A-Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences) (24Morodomi T. Ogata Y. Sasaguri Y. Morimatsu M. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of rabbit MMP-14 was purified from conditioned medium of transfectedEscherichia coli. 2M. A. Karsdal, L. Larsen, M. T. Engsig, H. Lou, M. Ferreras, A. Lochter, J.-M. Delaissé, and N. T. Foged, unpublished. Pro-MMPs were activated with 4-aminophenyl mercuric acetate. The molar concentration of active MMPs (25Knight C.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 85-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) was determined by using the MMP inhibitor BB94 (kindly provided by Dr. H. Van Wart, Roche Bioscience, Palo Alto, CA). Collagen type I (Nitta Collagen) or latent TGF were incubated with 4-aminophenyl mercuric acetate-activated MMP for 5 or 24 h unless otherwise indicated in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 50 μmZnSO4, 0.05% Brijj, pH 7.5). Activation of latent TGF-β was followed by Western blotting. Western blotting was performed on total cell lysates in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 30 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P40, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS) containing 10 mm NaF and 50 mmNa3VO4. Samples were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C with TBS-T (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20, 100 mm NaCl) containing 5% milk powder. Membranes were then incubated for 1 h at ambient temperature with antibodies against TGF-β. After washing vigorously with TBS-T for 1 h, membranes were incubated for 1 h at ambient temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibodies (Dako) and developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECLTM, AmershamBiosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions. To study cell shape, cells were fixed with 5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, washed extensively with water, and stained with 0.5% toluidine blue (Sigma) in 2.5% Na2CO3. Cells were examined by light microscopy (Olympus IX70, ×20 magnification). All graphs show one representative experiment of at least three, each with four individual replications. All graphs show the mean of four replications and standard deviations. All statistical calculations have been performed by the Student's two-tailed un-pairedt test assuming normal distribution with equal variance. Statistical significance is given by number of asterisks (*,p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01). When the mouse calvaria osteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1 (MC) or primary osteoblasts isolated from calvariae of 1-day-old mice were cultured on 2-D type I collagen-coated surfaces they morphologically resembled flattened, cuboidal bone lining cells, whereas, when embedded in 3-D type I collagen gels, they resembled dendritic osteocytes constituting a network of cells (Fig. 1 A). When MC cells or osteoblasts were grown in the 3-D collagen matrix in the presence of the MMP inhibitor, GM6001, the cell morphology was severely affected. Cell spreading was inhibited after 24 h of culture, and apoptotic vesicles and pycnotic nuclei were apparent after 2 days. In contrast, cell morphology was not affected by GM6001 when cells were grown on the 2-D collagen-coated substratum (Fig.1 A). To evaluate the exact amount of cell death due to MMP inhibitor treatment AlamarBlue assessment of cell number in MC cultures was performed (Fig. 1 B). The cell number was significantly lower after 2 days of culture and reduced by approximately 50% compared with the untreated control at day 5 of culture (Fig. 1 B). The effect of GM6001 was dose-dependent, with an IC50 value of 0.1 μm (Fig. 1 B). Primary osteoblasts displayed a similar pattern of sensitivity to MMP inhibition as the MC cell line when assessed by AlamarBlue (Fig.1 C). The MMP inhibitor BB-94 showed the same effect as GM6001 on both MC cells and primary mouse osteoblasts (data not shown). To evaluate if the observed effect on cell death was restricted to a bone-mimicking microenvironment consisting of 3-D type I collagen, MC cells were also cultured in another 3-D gel material, Matrigel. Matrigel consists of solubilized basement membrane, of which the major constituents are laminin, type IV collagen, heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and entactin and among other growth factors TGF-β and basic fibroblast growth factor (26Kleinman H.K. McGarvey M.L. Liotta L.A. Robey P.G. Tryggvason K. Martin G.R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6188-6193Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 27McGuire P.G. Seeds N.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 40: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, Matrigel does not resemble bone, but still retains the features of a 3-D matrix. MMPs were only important for survival of MC cells cultured in the type I collagen matrix and not in Matrigel (Fig. 2 A). Thus, MMPs are not essential for the survival in 3-D per se but specifically important when osteoblasts are surrounded by type I collagen. To further investigate the role of proteases in osteoblast survival in the bone microenvironment, we tested the effect of inhibitors of serine, cysteine, and aspartic proteases on MC cells. However, none of the protease inhibitors reduced the number of osteoblasts in 3-D type I collagen gels as measured by AlamarBlue (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, the morphological characteristics of apoptosis such as blebbing processes, apoptotic vesicles, condensed cytoplasm, and pycnotic nuclei were only induced in osteoblasts treated by the MMP inhibitor and not by inhibitors of the other protease families To investigate whether MMP inhibitor-treated osteoblasts die by apoptosis rather than necrosis, MC cells were cultured in 3-D type I collagen gels and stained for Annexin V together with DAPI and propidium iodide or for TUNEL. According to DAPI staining (Fig.3 A), the nuclei of cells treated with GM6001 were smaller and less abundant than those of vehicle-treated cells. In contrast to vehicle-treated control cells, GM6001-treated cells allowed uptake of propidium iodide, which only traverses the plasma membrane of cells that have lost their membrane potential, i.e. that either are late stage apoptotic or have died by necrosis. Cells treated with GM6001 were clearly positive for Annexin V, which indicates that they undergo apoptosis (Fig.3 A). However, because some cells were positive for both Annexin V and propidium iodide, it is difficult to conclude whether they died from apoptosis or necrosis, even when the classic morphological phenotypes of apoptosis were taken into account. Therefore, to further determine osteoblast cell death characteristics, TUNEL staining was applied to 3-D type I collagen gels after sectioning. After 5 days of culture in the presence of GM6001, we detected a 2.5-fold increase of apoptotic cells compared with vehicle-treated control cells (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, the increase in apoptotic cells from days 2 to 5 was 5-fold higher when MC cells were treated with GM6001 (Fig. 3 B). Thus, we conclude that MMP inhibitor-induced cell death of osteoblasts in 3-D type I collagen is due to apoptosis. To further investigate the mechanism by which MMPs control the survival of osteoblasts, we examined the effect of GM6001 in the presence of cleaved type I collagen fragments and extracellular matrix components. We hypothesized that the MMP-dependent survival may in part be explained by a proteolytic action on type I collagen that would expose an otherwise cryptic peptide sequence that is able to mediate survival, e.g. a peptide containing the integrin binding RGD motif (28Morimura N.

Rabinovitch M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and that mice, carrying a collagenase-resistant form of type I collagen, have altered skeletal remodeling resulting in empty lacunae in osteocytes in calvariae as a result of osteocyte apoptosis (30Zhao W. Byrne M.H. Wang Y. Krane S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 941-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We therefore examined if the incorporation of denatured collagen (gelatin) or proteolytically generated collagen fragments would have a positive effect on cell morphology and cell number in the presence of an MMP inhibitor. Collagen was denatured by heating or cleaved with either a collagenase (MMP-13) resulting in the classic ¾-¼ fragments, a gelatinase (MMP-9) or bacterial collagenase with unspecific activity against type I collagen. All incubations were checked by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining to detect both ¾ and ¼ fragments and unspecific cleavage of type I collagen (data not shown). These fragments were then incorporated into the type I collagen gel at a 1% w/w basis. However, neither heat-denatured collagen nor collagen fragments promoted osteoblast survival in the presence of GM6001 according to assessment by AlamarBlue (Fig. 4 A) and/or cell morphology (data not shown). ECM components may, in combination with RGD sequences released through MMP-directed proteolysis of collagen, mediate survival of smooth muscle cells (29Jones P.L. Crack J. Rabinovitch M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The viability of these cells is hypothesized to be sustained by an MMP-dependent pathway where RGD sequences facilitate endogenous production of tenascin, which thereby mediates survival. We therefore investigated the effect of fibronectin, laminin, and tenascin on osteoblast survival in the presence of an MMP inhibitor in 3-D type I collagen gels. None of the ECM molecules tested affected cell survival in the presence or absence of GM6001 measured either by cell number (Fig. 4 B) or by cell morphology (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that MMP-dependent survival of osteoblasts does not seem to be due to proteolytically generated type I collagen fragments or ECM molecules. Growth factors such as PTH, TNF-α, and TGF-β1 have previously been shown to modulate osteoblasts apoptosis (7Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A.

Res. 2001; 16: 975-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To further examine the effect of MMP action on osteoblast survival in 3-D collagen gels, we investigated the effect of a battery of known bone growth factors on MC cells in type I collagen gels,i.e. PTH, VEGF, TGF-β1, interleukin-1, and insulin-like growth factor. None of these growth factors had an effect on cell number in the absence of GM6001, and only TGF-β restored cell number and morphology to control levels in the presence of an MMP inhibitor (Fig. 5 A). MMPs can activate latent TGF-β (32Maeda S. Dean D.D. Gay I. Schwartz Z. Boyan B.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1281-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 33D'Angelo M. Billings P.C.

Biochem. 1996; 61: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), we investigated whether both active and latent TGF-β could prevent MMP inhibitor-mediated osteoblast apoptosis. Active TGF-β, but not latent TGF-β, restored cell number to control levels in the presence of GM6001 (Fig. 5 B). To further corroborate that endogenously produced and activated TGF-β is responsible for blocking osteoblasts apoptosis, we monitored cell number in the presence of TGF-β function-blocking antibodies. Addition of function-blocking anti-TGF-β antibodies dose-dependently reduced the cell number to the same extent as GM6001 (Fig. 5 C). Control antibodies had no significant effect on the cell number. TGF-β did not increase the cell number compared with vehicle-treated control cultures (Fig. 5, Aand B). To investigate further whether TGF-β blocks MMP inhibitor-induced apoptosis, we assessed by TUNEL-staining apoptosis of MC cells cultured in 3-D type I collagen gels in the absence and presence of TGF-β or/and GM6001. The increase in apoptosis induced by GM6001 was prevented by TGF-β (Fig. 5 D). TGF-β alone had some anti-apoptotic effects compared with controls, as previously described in serum starvation experiments (6Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Bellido T. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Taken together these results clearly demonstrate that TGF-β rescues the apoptosis induced by loss of MMP activity, suggesting that MMPs support cell survival through activation of latent TGF-β. The survival of trans-differentiating osteoblasts but not of mature osteocytes depends on MMP activity and is correlated to TGF-β-induced p44/42 MAPK activation. To compare the role of MMP activity in trans-differentiating osteoblasts to that in mature osteocytes, we cultured the osteocyte cell line MLO-Y4 (21Bonewald L.F. J. Bone Miner.

A recent study suggests that stress-activated protein kinases such as JNK 1The abbreviations used are: JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; ASK, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKKK, MAPK kinase kinase; Mcl-1, myeloid cell leukemia 1; PAE, porcine aortic endothelial; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; DTT, dithiothreitol; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; WT, wild type 1The abbreviations used are: JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; ASK, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKKK, MAPK kinase kinase; Mcl-1, myeloid cell leukemia 1; PAE, porcine aortic endothelial; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; DTT, dithiothreitol; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; WT, wild typeand p38 play important roles in triggering apoptosis in response to various cellular stressors including oxidative stress. We have shown that oxidative stress-induced sustained activation of JNK and p38 is required for apoptosis (4Tobiume K. Matsuzawa A. Takahashi T. Nishitoh H. Morita K. Takeda K. Minowa O. Miyazono K.

Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase (MAPKKK), specifically mediates the sustained activation of JNK/p38 and apoptosis in response to oxidative stress (5Ichijo H.

ASK1-dependent apoptosis is mediated by the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria followed by caspase 9 activation (7Hatai T. Matsuzawa A. Inoshita S. Mochida Y. Kuroda T. Sakamaki K.

It has also been reported that JNK is required for UV-induced release of cytochromec and that new gene expression is not required for this process (8Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D., Xu, J. Turner T.K.

These reports indicate that JNK induces apoptosis in part through the mitochondria-dependent caspase activation. However, the molecular mechanism by which activated JNK induces mitochondrial dysfunction is unclear. The members of the Bcl-2 family play pivotal roles in cellular decision to undergo apoptosis. Bcl-2 has been reported to be phosphorylated by JNK in response to different stimuli (9Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell.

Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins thus may be potential mediators of JNK-induced apoptosis. However, little is known about the relation between JNK and the other anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family in the context of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis signaling.

Similar to other Bcl-2 family members, Mcl-1 localizes in the mitochondrion as well as in other intracellular membranes (18Yang T. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. J.

Little is known regarding posttranslational modification and regulation of Mcl-1. In this study, we investigated the potential involvement of phosphorylation regulation of Mcl-1. HEK293 cells were grown under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 4.5 g/liter glucose, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells were grown under 5% CO2 in F12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Transfection with various constructs in pGEX-Neo was performed using 2 μg of plasmid and 8 μl of Tfx 50 (Promega). Transfected cells were selected in the presence of 1 mg/ml Geneticin for 2 weeks, and drug-resistant single-cell colonies were chosen and maintained in growth medium containing 0.4 mg/ml Geneticin. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to Mcl-1 was purchased from BD Biosciences. Phospho-JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185) and p38 (Thr-180/Tyr-182) were purchased from New England Biolabs. Phospho-ERK (Thr-183/Tyr-185) was purchased from Promega. The antibodies to Myc tag (clone 9E10), HA tag (clone 3F10), and FLAG tag were purchased from Calbiochem, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and Sigma, respectively. SB203580 was purchased from Calbiochem. Cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.5% aprotinin. Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation and resolved on SDS-PAGE followed by electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After blocking with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.05% Tween 20), the membranes were probed with antibodies. The antibody-antigen complexes were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). A cDNA clone containing the full-length of the Mcl-1 coding region was inserted into pcDNA3.0 vector. To replace Ser-121 and/or Thr-163 with Ala, a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis method was used. The Myc tag was inserted at the NH2 termini of wild type and mutant Mcl-1. pcDNA3-HA-ERK, pcDNA3-HA-JNK, pcDNA3-HA-p38, pcDNA3-HA-ASK1, pcDNA3-HA-ASK1ΔN, and pcDNA3-FLAG-ASK1 have been described previously (6Saitoh M.

Green fluorescent protein-tagged MKK4 mutant cDNA was subcloned into the SwaI site of pAdex1pCAw cassette cosmid. Each cosmid bearing the expression unit and adenovirus DNA-terminal protein complex was cotransfected into the E1 transcomplementing 293 cell clone. The recombinant adenoviruses generated by homologous recombination were isolated, and high titer stocks of recombinant adenoviruses were grown in 293 cells and purified. Nearly 100% infection of PAE cells by recombinant adenoviruses can be achieved at a m.o.i. of 100 as determined by green fluorescent protein fluorescence (data not shown). A cDNA encoding the human Mcl-1 protein corresponding to amino acids 31–229 was inserted into the pGEX-2T expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). Mcl-1-GST protein was induced in Escherichia coli BL21 cells by adding 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). The immune complex kinase assay was done as described previously (26Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K. Nakano H. Rothe M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The indicated plasmids were co-transfected into 293 cells by Tfx 50 (Promega). Cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 12 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.5% aprotinin. Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody using protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The beads were washed twice with washing buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, and 1 mm DTT), and then incubated with GST-Mcl-1 as the substrate for 20 min at 30 °C in 30 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm MgCl2, and 0.3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). The kinase reaction was stopped by adding SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and a Fuji BAS2000 Image analyzer. Cells were lysed in a lysis buffer for phosphatase treatment containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.5% aprotinin. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. Lysates were incubated with or without 2 units/μl of λ-protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The reaction was terminated by adding SDS sample buffer and boiling for 3 min. Cells were incubated in phosphate-free medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, at 37 °C for 3 h. [32P]Orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences) was then added at a final concentration of 1 mCi/ml, and labeling was continued at 37 °C for 3 h. The cells were transferred onto ice and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Cells were stimulated with 0.5 mm H2O2 containing F12 medium for 3 h. Cell viability was measured by the trypan blue (Sigma) dye exclusion method. Cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and counted using a hemocytometer after dilution in trypan blue. Blue cells were considered as dead cells. To investigate whether Mcl-1 is regulated by phosphorylation in response to oxidative stress, PAE cells were exposed to H2O2 and the electrophoretic mobility of Mcl-1 was assessed by immunoblotting analysis. We detected endogenous Mcl-1 of PAE cells as a double band under non-stressed conditions (Fig.1 A, top,lane 1). The mobility of both bands was delayed by H2O2 treatment in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A, top, lanes 2–6). The treatment of cell lysates prepared from H2O2-stimulated (Fig. 1 A,top, lane 7) and unstimulated (data not shown) PAE cells with λ-protein phosphatase resulted in the acceleration of the mobility of those bands. These findings suggest that endogenous Mcl-1 is partially phosphorylated under non-stressed conditions and that additional phosphorylation occurred after H2O2 treatment. To identify the kinase responsible for Mcl-1 phosphorylation in response to H2O2, we examined the activation state of three classes of MAPK, namely, ERK, JNK, and p38, which are all known to be activated by H2O2 (4Tobiume K. Matsuzawa A. Takahashi T. Nishitoh H. Morita K. Takeda K. Minowa O. Miyazono K. Noda T. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 2001; 2: 222-228Crossref Scopus (983) Google Scholar, 31Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M., Xu, Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). The kinetics of activation of JNK correlated with the extent of mobility of Mcl-1 (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that JNK might be involved in the H2O2-induced phosphorylation of Mcl-1. To examine which MAPK can phosphorylate Mcl-1 directly, we carried out an in vitro kinase assay using recombinant Mcl-1 as the substrate. JNK and p38 strongly phosphorylated Mcl-1in vitro, whereas the phosphorylation of Mcl-1 by ERK was marginal (Fig. 1 B). The co-transfection of ASK1, a MAPKKK that activates JNK and that p38 MAPK cascades in vivo, strongly enhanced the phosphorylation of Mcl-1 by JNK and p38 (Fig.1 C, top, lanes 1–5). ASK1 itself phosphorylated Mcl-1 very weakly (Fig. 1 C, top,lane 6). These findings suggested that Mcl-1 may serve as a specific substrate for JNK and p38 at least in vitro. We next examined whether Mcl-1 could be phosphorylated by JNK and p38 in mammalian cells. When Mcl-1 was co-transfected with JNK or p38 alone, the phosphorylation of Mcl-1 was undetectable as determined by the band shift analysis (Fig. 1 D, lanes 2 and4). In contrast, Mcl-1 became a shifted doublet by the co-expression of the activated allele of ASK1 (ASK1ΔN) together with JNK or p38 (Fig. 1 D, lanes 3 and 5). Phosphatase treatment shifted the doublet down to the basal status (Fig. 1 D, lanes 6–10), indicating that activated JNK and p38 could phosphorylate Mcl-1 in vivo. A sequence comparison of human and mouse Mcl-1 revealed that Mcl-1 possesses two conserved sites, Ser-121 and Thr-163, in humans that conforms to the consensus motif for the substrate of JNK and p38 (Fig.2 A). These sites are located in the PEST (proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine) domain of Mcl-1 (Fig. 2 A) and correspond to the so-called unstructural loop region in Bcl-2, which regulates the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2 (32Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Thompson C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). To examine which sites are phosphorylated by JNK or p38, we constructed three alanine substitution mutants of Mcl-1 (S121A, T163A, and S121A/T163A). The Myc-tagged wild-type (WT) or alanine-substituted mutant of Mcl-1 was co-transfected with JNK or p38 plus ASK1ΔN. Cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and analyzed by autoradiography after immunoprecipitation using anti-Myc antibody. WT and single alanine substitution mutants (S121A and T163A) of Mcl-1 were clearly phosphorylated by the co-expression of activated JNK and p38 (Fig.2 B, top, lanes 5–7 and9–11). In contrast, little phosphorylation was detected in the double-alanine mutant (S121A/T163A) of Mcl-1 (Fig. 2 B,top, lanes 8 and 12). These findings suggested that when overexpressed, activated JNK and p38 can phosphorylate both Ser-121 and Thr-163 of Mcl-1 and that these two amino acids are the major phosphorylation sites of Mcl-1 in vivo. To investigate the involvement of Ser-121 and Thr-163 in oxidative stress-induced phosphorylation of Mcl-1 as observed in Fig.1 A, we generated PAE cell clones stably expressing Myc-tagged WT and S121A/T163A mutant of Mcl-1. When these cells were treated with H2O2, the activations of endogenous JNK and p38 were clearly observed in both cells in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2 C,middle and bottom panels). In parallel with JNK activation, gel mobility of Mcl-1 was retarded in WT but not in S121A/T163A mutant-expressing cells (Fig. 2 C,top), and the retardation was canceled by treatment with λ-protein phosphatase (Fig. 2 C, lane 7). We have examined three independently selected clones of WT and mutant Mcl-1 and obtained essentially the same results in independent clones (data not shown). These results suggest that both Ser-121 and Thr-163 of Mcl-1 are phosphorylated in response to oxidative stress. The overexpression of either activated JNK or p38 phosphorylated Mcl-1in vivo (Figs. 1 D and 2 B), and both kinases were activated by H2O2 treatment (Figs.1 A and 2 C). However, time course analysis indicated that the activation of JNK coincided with Mcl-1 phosphorylation following H2O2 stimulation much better than that of p38 (Figs. 1 A and 2 C). To examine which signaling pathway is physiologically required for Mcl-1 phosphorylation in response to H2O2, we used the p38 inhibitor SB203580 and a recombinant adenovirus encoding dominant negative MKK4. Although p38 was specifically inactivated by SB203580 (data not shown), the treatment of PAE cells with SB203580 before H2O2 stimulation did not alter H2O2-induced Mcl-1 mobility shift (Fig.3 A). In contrast, the expression of the dominant negative MKK4 significantly reduced the gel mobility shift of Mcl-1 upon H2O2 treatment (Fig. 3 B). JNK but not p38 activation was specifically reduced by adenovirus encoding dominant negative MKK4. Taken together, Mcl-1 appears to be phosphorylated mainly via the JNK pathway in response to oxidative stress. Finally, we assessed the functional importance of Mcl-1 phosphorylation in oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. To this end, the susceptibility to H2O2-induced apoptosis was examined in PAE clones stably expressing WT and those expressing S121A/T163A Mcl-1. PAE clones were treated with 0.5 mmH2O2 for 3 h, and cell death was determined by the trypan blue exclusion assay (Fig.4). WT Mcl-1 conferred only minimal resistance compared with the vector control. However, S121A/T163A Mcl-1 showed substantially stronger anti-apoptotic activity than WT Mcl-1 following H2O2 treatment. We have examined three independently selected clones of WT and mutant Mcl-1 and obtained essentially the same results in independent clones (data not shown). These data indicated that eliminating phosphorylation sites increased anti-apoptotic activity of Mcl-1. In other words, Mcl-1 appears to be negatively regulated through phosphorylation of Ser-121 and Thr-163 by JNK following H2O2 stimulation. In this study, we demonstrated that Mcl-1 was phosphorylated at Ser-121 and Thr-163 through the JNK pathway and inactivated following H2O2 treatment. We also demonstrated that both JNK and p38 could phosphorylate Mcl-1 in vitro, whereas ERK induced little phosphorylation. A recent study also suggested using an ERK inhibitor that ERK was involved in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced Mcl-1 phosphorylation (33Domina A.M. Smith J.H. Craig R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21688-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Further investigations will be needed to determine whether the ERK pathway is also involved in Mcl-1 phosphorylation depending on stimuli. We identified two phosphorylation sites, which regulate the anti-apoptotic function of Mcl-1 in response to H2O2. Although human Mcl-1 possesses five potential phosphorylation sites that can be phosphorylated by JNK and p38, we could not detect any phosphorylation in the S121A/T163A mutant, suggesting that Ser-121 and Thr-163 are the main sites to undergo H2O2-induced phosphorylation. Bcl-2 has been shown to be phosphorylated by JNK in at least four serine/threonine sites. Especially, Ser-70 and Ser-87 play an important role in negatively regulating the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2 (9Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 11Thomas A. Giesler T. White E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5259-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recent work suggested that the number of phosphorylated sites of Bcl-2 appeared to depend on the intensity of kinase activation. We detected another shift of gel mobility of the S121A/T163A mutant of Mcl-1 when it was co-expressed with JNK and ASK1ΔN in 293 cells (data not shown). It remains to be determined whether other phosphorylation sites contribute to the regulation of the anti-apoptotic activity of Mcl-1. The mechanisms by which phosphorylation of Bcl-2 regulates anti-apoptotic function are poorly understood. Several studies have shown that phosphorylated Bcl-2 does not heterodimerize with Bax, and thus, apoptosis is promoted by an increase in the amount of free Bax (34Basu A. Haldar S. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 13: 659-664PubMed Google Scholar, 35Haldar S. Basu A. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1609-1615PubMed Google Scholar). We could not detect any changes in the interaction of Bax and Mcl-1 before or after the phosphorylation of Mcl-1 (data not shown). However, in the phosphorylation sites of Mcl-1 located in the PEST motif, there was no difference in the half-life of WT and S121A/T163A mutant of Mcl-1 after H2O2stimulation (data not shown). Further studies will be needed to elucidate the mechanism of phosphorylation-mediated inactivation of Mcl-1. The JNK signaling pathway is essential for exocytotoxic stress-induced apoptosis in neurons and UV-induced apoptosis in mouse embryonic fibroblast (8Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D., Xu, J. Turner T.K.

Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). It seems that activated JNK acts on mitochondria and induces apoptosis through the release of cytochrome c(7Hatai T. Matsuzawa A. Inoshita S. Mochida Y. Kuroda T. Sakamaki K. Kuida K. Yonehara S.

Although the Bcl-2 family is a potential target of JNK that regulates cytochrome c, several discrepancies have been pointed out. For example, Bcl-2 phosphorylation has been suggested to increase rather than decrease anti-apoptotic function (37Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Stimuli that cause JNK-induced apoptosis such as UV do not necessarily cause Bcl-2 phosphorylation (8Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D., Xu, J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar). In our study, Mcl-1 was phosphorylated by JNK and its anti-apoptotic function decreased. Phosphorylation and inactivation of Mcl-1 thus may be one of the mechanisms by which JNK induces apoptosis in response to oxidative stress. We thank Y. Tsujimoto and S. Shimizu for valuable comments.

https://openalex.org/W2045003839,"Efficient transcription and replication of the influenza virus genome are dependent upon host-derived factors. Using an <i>in vitro</i> RNA synthesis system, we have purified and identified Hsp90 as one of the host factors that stimulate viral RNA polymerase activity. Hsp90 interacted with the PB2 subunit of the viral RNA polymerase through the amino-terminal chaperone domain and the middle region containing a highly acidic domain. The acidic middle region was also responsible for its stimulatory activity. We found that a portion of Hsp90 is re-localized to the cell nucleus after viral infection. A PB2 fragment containing a Hsp90 binding domain inhibited viral gene expression in a dominant-negative manner. These results suggest that Hsp90 is a host factor for the influenza virus RNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W2032118099,"The changes in the intermediary metabolism of plant cells were quantified according to growth conditions at three different stages of the growth cycle of tomato cell suspension. Eighteen fluxes of central metabolism were calculated from13C enrichments after near steady-state labeling by a metabolic model similar to that described in Dieuaide-Noubhani et al. (Dieuaide-Noubhani, M., Raffard, G., Canioni, P., Pradet, A., and Raymond, P. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 13147–13159), and 10 net fluxes were obtained directly from end-product accumulation rates. The absolute flux values of central metabolic pathways gradually slowed down with the decrease of glucose influx into the cells. However, the relative fluxes of glycolysis, the pentose-P pathway, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle remained unchanged during the culture cycle at 70, 28, and 40% of glucose influx, respectively, and the futile cycle of sucrose remained high at about 6-fold the glucose influx, independently from carbon nutritional conditions. This natural resistance to flux alterations is referred to as metabolic stability. The numerous anabolic pathways, including starch synthesis, hexose accumulation, biosynthesis of wall polysaccharides, and amino and organic acid biosynthesis were comparatively low and variable.

We conclude that anabolic fluxes constitute the flexible part of plant cell metabolism that can fluctuate in relation to cell demands for growth. Plants are able to grow under a wide range of environmental conditions (extreme temperatures, insufficient or excessive light, and shortage of water or mineral nutrients) and show a robust physiological homeostasis. To ensure this homeostasis, plant metabolism has to be very flexible (1Smirnoff N. Smirnoff N. Environment and Plant Metabolism: flexibility and acclimation. Bios Scientific Publishers, Oxford1995: 1-16Google Scholar). In all cells, the central carbon metabolism provides energy, cofactor regeneration, and building blocks for biomass and secondary metabolism. The flexibility of plant metabolism, which is probably an evolutionary adaptation to the variable environmental conditions plants normally experience, has been explained by the buffering effect of carbon storage and allocation (2ap Rees T. Hill S.A. Plant Cell Environ. 1994; 17: 587-599Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and by the complexity of regulation or built-in redundancy owing to alternative enzymes and pathways for many processes (3Plaxton W.C. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 185-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). For example, parallel glycolytic pathways are present in the cytosol and plastid; in the cytosol, the classic key sites for regulation of glycolysis at phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase (PK) 1The abbreviations used are: PK, pyruvate kinase; PEPC, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; SR, specific radioactivity; FW, fresh weight; DW, dry weight; PPP, pentose-phosphate pathway 1The abbreviations used are: PK, pyruvate kinase; PEPC, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; SR, specific radioactivity; FW, fresh weight; DW, dry weight; PPP, pentose-phosphate pathwaycan be bypassed by pyrophosphate:fructose-6-phosphate phosphotransferase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) (3Plaxton W.C. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 185-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar).The development of genetic engineering, which introduced a new dimension to pathway knowledge by allowing precise modifications of specific enzymatic reactions in metabolic pathways, also highlighted the flexibility of plant primary metabolism (4Stitt M. Curr. Opin. Biotech. 1994; 5: 137-143Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 5Stitt M. Sonnewald U. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

Pyrophosphate:fructose-6-phosphate phosphotransferase and cytosolic PK, which generally have been considered essential, were almost removed without any significant effect on growth or development (7Gottlob-McHugh S.G. Sangwan R.S. Blakeley S.D. Vanlerberghe G.C., Ko, K. Turpin D.H. Plaxton W.C. Miki B.L. Dennis D.T. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 820-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Hajirezaei M.

In contrast, in yeast many genes encoding glycolytic enzymes (e.g. hexose kinase, phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphoglucose kinase, PK, and alcohol dehydrogenase) have been overexpressed many times, but in none of the mutants did the glycolytic flux differ substantially from the wild type flux (10Schaaff I. Heinisch J. Zimmermann F.K. Yeast. 1989; 5: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 11Davies S.E.C. Brindle K.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4729-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In plants, overexpression of the spinach choline monooxygenase gene in tobacco chloroplasts did not contribute to the accumulation of glycine betaine (12Nuccio M.L. Russel B.L. Nolte K., D. Rathinasabapathi B. Gaye D.A. Hanson A.D. Plant J. 1998; 16: 101-110Crossref Google Scholar). This inherent resistance to flux alteration by genetic manipulation, which was designed to enhance the yield in biosynthetic choline pathways, has also been named “rigidity” (13McNeil S.D. Rhodes D. Russell B.L. Nuccio M.L. Shachar-Hill Y. Hanson A.D. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The concept of “network rigidity” was initially proposed by Stephanopoulos and Vallino (14Stephanopoulos G. Vallino J.J. Science. 1991; 252: 1675-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) and was considered to result from mechanisms that stabilize flux ratios at branch points in metabolic networks. The enzymes bifurcating from a rigid node are activated by intermediates in the opposite branch. The interdependency of enzyme activities in competing branches stabilizes the ratio of branching fluxes and maintains flux distribution, which is optimal for growth. In view of carbon metabolism adaptations in response to environmental changes in plants, the following question can be raised: does the plant primary metabolism coordinate a relatively uniform constant distribution of building block metabolites and energy or does it support radically different flux distributions in response to different environmental stimuli?A variety of methods have been developed to quantify intracellular fluxes in animals (15Malloy C.R.

Radio or stable isotopic tracers such as 14C or13C can be used according to three major methods (22Roscher A. Kruger N.J. Ratcliffe R.G. J. Biotech. 2000; 77: 81-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A commonly used method is to calculate a flux from the rate of end-product labeling and the specific radioactivity of the precursor (23Hill S.A. ap Rees T. Planta. 1994; 192: 52-60Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Alternatively, tissues are labeled to isotopic steady state, and intermediate labeling can be used for flux calculation using a linear equation, independently of time (18Salon C. Raymond P. Pradet A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12278-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Dieuaide-Noubhani M. Raffard G. Canioni P. Pradet A. Raymond P. J. Biol.

Fluxes can also be measured directly by in vivo NMR using the techniques of magnetization transfers (21Roscher A. Emsley L. Raymond P. Roby C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25053-25061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In plants, major fluxes of carbohydrate metabolism have been estimated during starch breakdown by ripening bananas (23Hill S.A. ap Rees T.

Changes observed in the enrichments of intermediary metabolites during the first stages of sugar starvation indicated that sugar nutrition profoundly affects the metabolic network in excised corn root tips. Acetyl-CoA entering the tricarboxylic acid cycle is progressively supplied by lipids and proteins, and the anaplerotic flux through the PEPC vanishes long before carbohydrates are exhausted.The aim of the present work was to examine changes in fluxes of intermediary metabolism in heterotrophic plant cells in suspension cultures, in response to changes in the culture medium and growth stages during a growth cycle. Tomato cells were labeled to the isotopic steady state with [1-13C]glucose. 1The abbreviations used are: PK, pyruvate kinase; PEPC, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; SR, specific radioactivity; FW, fresh weight; DW, dry weight; PPP, pentose-phosphate pathwayH and13C NMR were used to determine 13C enrichments of specific carbons of carbohydrates and amino acids. Metabolic pathway modeling was used to interpret isotope distribution according to Ref.20Dieuaide-Noubhani M. Raffard G. Canioni P. Pradet A. Raymond P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13147-13159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar. Using these data, 29 metabolic fluxes were quantified at 3 different physiological stages during the growth cycle of tomato cells. The results show the following: (i) That relative fluxes in the central metabolism (glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and pentose-P pathway) and futile cycles (sucrose turnover and triose-P to hexose-P recycling) are high and stable. (ii) On the contrary, relative fluxes in anabolic pathways, such as the anaplerotic flux catalyzed by PEP carboxylase, are low and variable, constituting the flexible part of metabolism, which may fluctuate to fit precursor availability for the anabolic pathway in relation to cell needs.RESULTSCell Growth, Glucose Uptake, and Cellular Metabolite ContentThe growth rate of tomato cells in liquid culture was established by measuring fresh weight (FW), dry weight (DW), and cell number (Fig. 1, A andB). The growth curve profile was similar to that of most other plant cell cultures (35Kanabus J. Bressan R.A. Carpita N.C. Plant Physiol. 1986; 82: 363-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Botha F.C. O'Kennedy M.M. Physiol. Plant. 1998; 102: 429-436Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Growth was exponential during the first 6 days after subculture. Fig. 1 A indicates that, after day 5, FW increased more by cell enlargement than by cell division. This was confirmed by the decrease in the rate of [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA from day 4, and the disappearance of cyclin A2 and D3 mRNA at day 5, thus indicating the arrest of cell division (data not shown). In batch culture, most physical and chemical conditions change during the growth cycle. In our experiment, glucose disappeared from the medium in a sigmoid fashion (Fig. 1 A). The glucose influx rate (Vg) decreased in parallel, from 903 ± 45 at day 3 to 180 nmol.h−1.(106 cells)−1 at day 7.5 (Fig. 1 C). At day 6, nitrogen (NH 4+, 15 mm) and glucose (65 mm) were still available in the culture medium, whereas inorganic phosphate measured by the molybdate method was under 0.02 mm. The vacuolar phosphate was not detectable by in vivo 31P NMR, but the cytoplasmic Pi level was the same as on day 1 (data not shown). No Pi starvation symptom was observed. Growth (FW curve) slowed down after day 6 and stopped after day 10 when glucose was exhausted from the medium (Fig.1 A).During a culture cycle, 70% of the absorbed glucose was used to sustain respiration. The main end products of glucose metabolism accumulated during a growth cycle (i.e. soluble and insoluble sugars, organic acids, and proteins) are shown in Fig.2. Soluble sugars mainly accumulated at the end of the exponential phase between days 5 and 6 (Fig.2 A). At the end of the culture, the accumulation of cell wall polysaccharides, soluble sugars, and starch was, respectively, 1.7, 1.2, and 0.6 mmol of glucose equivalent per flask corresponding to 10, 8, and 4% of the initial glucose (Fig. 2, A andB). The organic acid content (0.1 mmol per flask at the end of the culture, Fig. 2 C) was a small fraction of accumulated carbon. Citrate and malate mainly accumulated after day 5 when cell growth started to decline (Fig. 2 C). Total proteins constantly increased during the cell growth cycle (Fig. 2 D). Their amino acid composition remained stable during the growth cycle. The carbon flux for each group of amino acids contributing to protein accumulation was calculated from the rate of protein accumulation (Fig.2 D) and the established pathway of amino acid biosynthesis (Fig. 3) (37Ireland R.

It was therefore assumed that the cytosolic hexose-P constituted a single pool (Fig. 6). The labeling of intracellular free glucose C-6 suggested that part of intracellular glucose was formed from hexose-P via a sucrose cycle (Vi) (Fig. 6). According to Ref. 20Dieuaide-Noubhani M. Raffard G. Canioni P. Pradet A. Raymond P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13147-13159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, the C-6 enrichment of the hexose-P pool can be explained by both triose-P recycling and exchange through the cytosolic transaldolase reaction (Vtald) (Fig. 6). The absence of detectable label in free glucose C-2 and C-5 suggests the absence of gluconeogenesis (Fig. 6). The fact that the total enrichment (C-1 + C-6) of free glucose, sucrose, and starch glucosyl was gradually lower than that of the glucose precursor (92%) was accounted for by the pentose-P pathway (Vppp), the only possibility in the absence of gluconeogenesis (Fig. 6). The similar enrichments of starch glucosyl C-6, and sucrose glucosyl C-6 (Table I) indicated that starch was essentially formed from hexose-P imported from the cytosol with no further exchange of hexose-P C-6 with triose-P C-1.

This is shown in the present model as a reverse flux (Vhpc) of hexose-P from plastids to cytosol (Fig. 6). The hexose-P exchange between cytosol and plastids could be performed either by a hexose-P translocator of the plastid double membrane, as suggested recently (39Flugge U.I. Curr. Opin. Plant. Biol. 1998; 1: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), or by a glucose translocator (40Weber A. Servaites J.C. Geiger D.R. Kofler H. Hille D. Groner F. Hebbeker U. Flugge U.I.

The lower enrichment of the starch glucosyl C-1 compared with cytosolic hexose-P C-1 (Table I) indicated the occurrence of a flux through the plastidial PPP, with recycling of C-1 unlabeled hexose-P inside plastids. As in Ref. 20Dieuaide-Noubhani M. Raffard G. Canioni P. Pradet A. Raymond P. J. Biol.

According to (18Salon C. Raymond P. Pradet A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12278-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Dieuaide-Noubhani M. Raffard G. Canioni P. Pradet A. Raymond P. J.

The identical enrichment of Glu C-4 and Ala C-3 (Table II) indicated that there was no diluting flux between pyruvate and Glu, i.e. glycolysis was the only source of acetyl CoA. The low enrichment of C-2 Ala showed the occurrence of a relatively small flux from malate to Ala through the malic enzyme reaction (Fig. 6).Amino Acid FluxesOur model also includes the fluxes of amino acid biosynthesis calculated from the rate of amino acid accumulation into total proteins (Fig. 2 D). During the culture cycle, the amino acid composition of total protein remained constant (Fig. 3). Table III presents the conversion factor (F) used to calculate the fluxes (Vx)"

It is an ATP-binding cassette transporter with two nucleotide-binding domains and two transmembrane (TM) domains. One class of compounds transported by P-gp is the rhodamine dyes. A P-gp deletion mutant (residues 1–379 plus 681–1025) with only the TM domains retained the ability to bind rhodamine. Therefore, to identify the residues involved in rhodamine binding, 252 mutants containing a cysteine in the predicted TM segments were generated and reacted with a thiol-reactive analog of rhodamine, methanethiosulfonate (MTS)-rhodamine. The activities of 28 mutants (in TMs 2–12) were inhibited by at least 50% after reaction with MTS-rhodamine. The activities of five mutants, I340C(TM6), A841C(TM9), L975C(TM12), V981C(TM12), and V982C(TM12), however, were significantly protected from inhibition by MTS-rhodamine by pretreatment with rhodamine B, indicating that residues in TMs 6, 9, and 12 contribute to the binding of rhodamine dyes. These results, together with those from previous labeling studies with other thiol-reactive compounds, dibromobimane, MTS-verapamil, and MTS-cross-linker substrates, indicate that common residues are involved in the binding of structurally different drug substrates and that P-gp has a common drug-binding site.

Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).An important goal in understanding the mechanism of drug transport is the identification of residues that line the drug-binding site. The drug-binding site(s) are within the TM domains of P-gp because a deletion mutant missing both nucleotide-binding domains could still interact with drug substrates (13Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24759-24765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A useful method for identifying residues in the TM segments that contribute to drug binding is to use cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and reaction with thiol-reactive substrates. Such an approach is feasible with P-gp because a Cys-less mutant of P-gp is active (9Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and most single cysteine mutants retain activity (19Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27482-27487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In previous studies we used the thiol-reactive substrates dibromobimane (20Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 14972-14979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) to test the reactivity of the single cysteine mutants. These studies showed that residues in TMs 4–6 and 10–12 contributed to the drug-binding site. Some of these residues were common to the binding of both substrates. Although both dibromobimane and verapamil stimulate the ATPase activity of P-gp, it is not known whether both are transported by P-gp. Kinetic studies indicate that verapamil is a noncompetitive inhibitor of cytotoxic substrates transported by P-gp and may occupy separate site(s) from that of transported compounds (24Ayesh S. Shao Y.M. Stein W.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1316: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 25Shapiro A.B. Fox K. Lam P. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar).It has been shown that all rhodamine compounds are transported by P-gp (26Eytan G.D. Regev R. Oren G. Hurwitz C.D. Assaraf Y.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In this study, we used a thiol-reactive analog of rhodamine, MTS-rhodamine, to identify residues involved in its binding.DISCUSSIONRhodamine compounds such as trimethylrosamine, rhodamines I, II, and II, rhodamine B, rhodamine G, and rhodamine 123 are transported by P-gp. These rhodamine dyes and MTS-rhodamine (this study) also stimulate ATPase activity and are considered to be substrates of P-gp (26Eytan G.D. Regev R. Oren G. Hurwitz C.D. Assaraf Y.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).Two mutants, L65C and F343C, showed increased activity after treatment with MTS-rhodamine. Because mutant L65C had only 51% of the verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity relative to that of the Cys-less parent (22Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39272-39278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), treatment with MTS treatment essentially restored the activity of the mutant to that of the Cys-less P-gp. Perhaps a bulky residue is required at position 56 for full activity. Mutant F343C showed about 3.5-fold increase in activity after treatment with MTS-rhodamine. Because mutant F343C had about 60% of the activity of Cys-less P-gp, reaction with MTS-rhodamine essentially causes a 2-fold increase in activity relative to the Cys-less parent. The presence of a bulky group a position 343 appears to enhance activity. We previously showed that the bulkiness of side chains in TMs 5 and 6 can have large effects on drug-stimulated ATPase activity (29Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 43Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 480-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).MTS-rhodamine inhibited the ATPase activities of 28 of the 252 single cysteine mutants by at least 50%. A cysteine mutant that was sensitive to inhibition was found in all other TM segments except in TM1. Three cysteine mutants (V52C, G54C, and G62C) in TM1 were not tested because of low expression, indicating that these residues must be important for structure and/or function. Therefore, it appears that all of the TMs are important for function because at least one position in each TM segment is sensitive to mutation or inhibition by MTS-rhodamine.The activity of mutant C137(TM2) was inhibited by 93% by MTS-rhodamine. This residue is interesting in that it is one of seven endogenous cysteines (other cysteines at positions 431, 717, 956, 1074, 1125, and 1227) found in wild-type P-gp. Previous studies on the inhibition of P-gp activity have shown that only the cysteines located in the cytoplasmic Walker A nucleotide-binding regions (Cys431 and Cys1074) are inhibited by thiol-reactive compounds (17Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22957-22961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 44Senior A.E. Gros P. Urbatsch I.L. Arch. Biochem.

Inhibition of the activity of the C137 mutant was quite specific because similar inhibition of activity was not observed when the mutant was treated with the thiol-reactive compounds such as biotin-maleimide (9Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar),N-ethylmaleimide (17Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 14972-14979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The ability to inhibit the activity of mutant C137 with MTS-rhodamine indicates that this residue could be a target for the development of novel inhibitory reagents that covalently modify P-gp.Rhodamine B significantly protected the activities of mutants I340C(TM6), A841C(TM9), L975C(TM12), V981C(TM12), and V982C(TM12) from inhibition by MTS-rhodamine (Fig. 5). This indicates that these residues must be within or close to the rhodamine drug-binding site.The results from studies involving cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and reaction with structurally diverse thiol-reactive substrates (this study and Refs. 20Loo T.W.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14049-14057Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) point to the presence of a “common” drug-binding site. A model of such a common drug-binding site in P-gp is shown in Fig.6. The arrangement of the TM segments (Fig. 6) is also based on the results of disulfide cross-linking studies that show TMs 4–6 to be close to TMs 10–12 during the resting phase (19Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27482-27487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 46Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The MTS-rhodamine results (this study) show that TM9 must also be close to or within the binding site for rhodamine-type compounds and would be next to TM6 (Fig. 6). Song and Melera (58Song J. Melera P.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) showed in hamster P-gp that there is close interaction between TMs 6 and 9 during drug binding. Mutations in TM9 (I837L and N839I) or in TM6 (G388A and A339P) resulted in similar drug resistance profiles with four structurally different drugs (increased resistance to vincristine or actinomycin D but decreased resistance to colchicine or daunorubicin relative to wild-type P-gp). It is interesting that the equivalent residues in human P-gp (Ile840 and Asn842 in TM9 and Gly341 and Ala342in TM6) are adjacent to the cysteines (A841C(TM9) and I340C(TM6)) the activities of which are protected by rhodamine B from inhibition by MTS-rhodamine (Fig. 5).Some studies have suggested that P-gp has four different drug interaction sites that substrates occupy different sites during transport or that each substrate has a distinct binding site (25Shapiro A.B. Fox K. Lam P. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 59Dey S. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10594-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar,60Pascaud C. Garrigos M. Orlowski S. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These results are not incompatible with the model presented in Fig. 6. Although the model shows the presence of a common drug-binding site, it can be used to accommodate results that predict multiple drug-binding sites. We had proposed that substrates can create their own binding sites (“substrate-induced fit” hypothesis) by using a combination of residues from different TMs to form a particular drug-binding site (21Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35388-35392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Forming the drug-binding site this way would depend on the TMs being quite mobile. The binding of a particular substrate would result in a more “rigid” P-gp. Evidence that the TM segments are quite mobile comes from disulfide cross-linking studies (57Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). When thermal motion is reduced (4 °C), only residues at the cytoplasmic side in TMs 4 and 5 were cross-linked with that in TM12. At higher temperatures (21 and 37 °C), these residues as well as residues at the cytoplasmic side in TM 6 were cross-linked with those in TMs 10 and 11. The substrate-induced fit hypothesis would also explain why P-gp binds substrates with different affinities. When a particular substrate induces a particular fit in P-gp, then the combined effects of contributing residues from each TM would determine the affinity. Also, some substrates may share the same residue(s) during binding. For example, the activities of mutants L339C(TM6) and A342(TM6) are protected from inhibition by dibromobimane (21Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35388-35392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and MTS-verapamil (23Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14972-14979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) but not by MTS-rhodamine, whereas that of mutant V982C(TM12) is protected from inhibition by dibromobimane and MTS-rhodamine but not by MTS-verapamil.An interesting feature of the cysteine mutants that are inhibited with thiol-reactive compounds is that most are located near the middle of each TM segment (Fig. 7). When the drug-binding site is opened as a fan, it appears that the reactive residues form a ring. The substrates may recognize various combinations of residues in this ring during binding. Future work with other structurally diverse thiol substrates will determine whether other residues contribute to this “ring of recognition.”Figure 7Location of the cysteine residues that interact with MTS-rhodamine, MTS-verapamil, or dibromobimane.The numbered cylinders represent TM segments 4–6 and 8–12 of P-gp.

Expression of P-gp complicates treatment of AIDS and cancer because many of the therapeutic compounds are also substrates of P-gp (3Lee C.G. Gottesman M.M. Cardarelli C.O. Ramachandra M. Jeang K.T.

P-gp also plays an important role in mediating the bioavailability of oral drugs because of its relatively high expression in the intestine, liver, kidney, and brain (5Thiebaut F. Tsuruo T. Hamada H.

P-gp is a member of the ATP-binding cassette family of transporters (7Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar). Its 1280 amino acids are organized in two repeating units of 610 amino acids that are joined by a linker segment of 60 amino acids (8Chen C.J. Chin J.E. Ueda K. Clark D.P. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Roninson I.B. Cell. 1986; 47: 381-389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). Each repeat has six transmembrane (TM) segments and a hydrophilic domain containing an ATP-binding site (9Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). An important goal in understanding the mechanism of drug transport is the identification of residues that line the drug-binding site. The drug-binding site(s) are within the TM domains of P-gp because a deletion mutant missing both nucleotide-binding domains could still interact with drug substrates (13Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24759-24765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A useful method for identifying residues in the TM segments that contribute to drug binding is to use cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and reaction with thiol-reactive substrates. Such an approach is feasible with P-gp because a Cys-less mutant of P-gp is active (9Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and most single cysteine mutants retain activity (19Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27482-27487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In previous studies we used the thiol-reactive substrates dibromobimane (20Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 14972-14979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) to test the reactivity of the single cysteine mutants. These studies showed that residues in TMs 4–6 and 10–12 contributed to the drug-binding site. Some of these residues were common to the binding of both substrates. Although both dibromobimane and verapamil stimulate the ATPase activity of P-gp, it is not known whether both are transported by P-gp. Kinetic studies indicate that verapamil is a noncompetitive inhibitor of cytotoxic substrates transported by P-gp and may occupy separate site(s) from that of transported compounds (24Ayesh S. Shao Y.M. Stein W.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1316: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 25Shapiro A.B. Fox K. Lam P. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). It has been shown that all rhodamine compounds are transported by P-gp (26Eytan G.D. Regev R. Oren G. Hurwitz C.D. Assaraf Y.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In this study, we used a thiol-reactive analog of rhodamine, MTS-rhodamine, to identify residues involved in its binding. DISCUSSIONRhodamine compounds such as trimethylrosamine, rhodamines I, II, and II, rhodamine B, rhodamine G, and rhodamine 123 are transported by P-gp. These rhodamine dyes and MTS-rhodamine (this study) also stimulate ATPase activity and are considered to be substrates of P-gp (26Eytan G.D. Regev R. Oren G. Hurwitz C.D. Assaraf Y.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).Two mutants, L65C and F343C, showed increased activity after treatment with MTS-rhodamine. Because mutant L65C had only 51% of the verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity relative to that of the Cys-less parent (22Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39272-39278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), treatment with MTS treatment essentially restored the activity of the mutant to that of the Cys-less P-gp. Perhaps a bulky residue is required at position 56 for full activity. Mutant F343C showed about 3.5-fold increase in activity after treatment with MTS-rhodamine. Because mutant F343C had about 60% of the activity of Cys-less P-gp, reaction with MTS-rhodamine essentially causes a 2-fold increase in activity relative to the Cys-less parent. The presence of a bulky group a position 343 appears to enhance activity. We previously showed that the bulkiness of side chains in TMs 5 and 6 can have large effects on drug-stimulated ATPase activity (29Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 43Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 480-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).MTS-rhodamine inhibited the ATPase activities of 28 of the 252 single cysteine mutants by at least 50%. A cysteine mutant that was sensitive to inhibition was found in all other TM segments except in TM1. Three cysteine mutants (V52C, G54C, and G62C) in TM1 were not tested because of low expression, indicating that these residues must be important for structure and/or function. Therefore, it appears that all of the TMs are important for function because at least one position in each TM segment is sensitive to mutation or inhibition by MTS-rhodamine.The activity of mutant C137(TM2) was inhibited by 93% by MTS-rhodamine. This residue is interesting in that it is one of seven endogenous cysteines (other cysteines at positions 431, 717, 956, 1074, 1125, and 1227) found in wild-type P-gp. Previous studies on the inhibition of P-gp activity have shown that only the cysteines located in the cytoplasmic Walker A nucleotide-binding regions (Cys431 and Cys1074) are inhibited by thiol-reactive compounds (17Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22957-22961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 44Senior A.E. Gros P. Urbatsch I.L. Arch. Biochem.

Inhibition of the activity of the C137 mutant was quite specific because similar inhibition of activity was not observed when the mutant was treated with the thiol-reactive compounds such as biotin-maleimide (9Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar),N-ethylmaleimide (17Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 14972-14979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The ability to inhibit the activity of mutant C137 with MTS-rhodamine indicates that this residue could be a target for the development of novel inhibitory reagents that covalently modify P-gp.Rhodamine B significantly protected the activities of mutants I340C(TM6), A841C(TM9), L975C(TM12), V981C(TM12), and V982C(TM12) from inhibition by MTS-rhodamine (Fig. 5). This indicates that these residues must be within or close to the rhodamine drug-binding site.The results from studies involving cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and reaction with structurally diverse thiol-reactive substrates (this study and Refs. 20Loo T.W.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14049-14057Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) point to the presence of a “common” drug-binding site. A model of such a common drug-binding site in P-gp is shown in Fig.6. The arrangement of the TM segments (Fig. 6) is also based on the results of disulfide cross-linking studies that show TMs 4–6 to be close to TMs 10–12 during the resting phase (19Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27482-27487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 46Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The MTS-rhodamine results (this study) show that TM9 must also be close to or within the binding site for rhodamine-type compounds and would be next to TM6 (Fig. 6). Song and Melera (58Song J. Melera P.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) showed in hamster P-gp that there is close interaction between TMs 6 and 9 during drug binding. Mutations in TM9 (I837L and N839I) or in TM6 (G388A and A339P) resulted in similar drug resistance profiles with four structurally different drugs (increased resistance to vincristine or actinomycin D but decreased resistance to colchicine or daunorubicin relative to wild-type P-gp). It is interesting that the equivalent residues in human P-gp (Ile840 and Asn842 in TM9 and Gly341 and Ala342in TM6) are adjacent to the cysteines (A841C(TM9) and I340C(TM6)) the activities of which are protected by rhodamine B from inhibition by MTS-rhodamine (Fig. 5).Some studies have suggested that P-gp has four different drug interaction sites that substrates occupy different sites during transport or that each substrate has a distinct binding site (25Shapiro A.B. Fox K. Lam P. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 59Dey S. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10594-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar,60Pascaud C. Garrigos M. Orlowski S. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These results are not incompatible with the model presented in Fig. 6. Although the model shows the presence of a common drug-binding site, it can be used to accommodate results that predict multiple drug-binding sites. We had proposed that substrates can create their own binding sites (“substrate-induced fit” hypothesis) by using a combination of residues from different TMs to form a particular drug-binding site (21Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35388-35392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Forming the drug-binding site this way would depend on the TMs being quite mobile. The binding of a particular substrate would result in a more “rigid” P-gp. Evidence that the TM segments are quite mobile comes from disulfide cross-linking studies (57Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). When thermal motion is reduced (4 °C), only residues at the cytoplasmic side in TMs 4 and 5 were cross-linked with that in TM12. At higher temperatures (21 and 37 °C), these residues as well as residues at the cytoplasmic side in TM 6 were cross-linked with those in TMs 10 and 11. The substrate-induced fit hypothesis would also explain why P-gp binds substrates with different affinities. When a particular substrate induces a particular fit in P-gp, then the combined effects of contributing residues from each TM would determine the affinity. Also, some substrates may share the same residue(s) during binding. For example, the activities of mutants L339C(TM6) and A342(TM6) are protected from inhibition by dibromobimane (21Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35388-35392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and MTS-verapamil (23Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14972-14979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) but not by MTS-rhodamine, whereas that of mutant V982C(TM12) is protected from inhibition by dibromobimane and MTS-rhodamine but not by MTS-verapamil.An interesting feature of the cysteine mutants that are inhibited with thiol-reactive compounds is that most are located near the middle of each TM segment (Fig. 7). When the drug-binding site is opened as a fan, it appears that the reactive residues form a ring. The substrates may recognize various combinations of residues in this ring during binding. Future work with other structurally diverse thiol substrates will determine whether other residues contribute to this “ring of recognition.” Rhodamine compounds such as trimethylrosamine, rhodamines I, II, and II, rhodamine B, rhodamine G, and rhodamine 123 are transported by P-gp. These rhodamine dyes and MTS-rhodamine (this study) also stimulate ATPase activity and are considered to be substrates of P-gp (26Eytan G.D. Regev R. Oren G. Hurwitz C.D. Assaraf Y.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Two mutants, L65C and F343C, showed increased activity after treatment with MTS-rhodamine. Because mutant L65C had only 51% of the verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity relative to that of the Cys-less parent (22Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39272-39278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), treatment with MTS treatment essentially restored the activity of the mutant to that of the Cys-less P-gp. Perhaps a bulky residue is required at position 56 for full activity. Mutant F343C showed about 3.5-fold increase in activity after treatment with MTS-rhodamine. Because mutant F343C had about 60% of the activity of Cys-less P-gp, reaction with MTS-rhodamine essentially causes a 2-fold increase in activity relative to the Cys-less parent.

A model of such a common drug-binding site in P-gp is shown in Fig.6. The arrangement of the TM segments (Fig. 6) is also based on the results of disulfide cross-linking studies that show TMs 4–6 to be close to TMs 10–12 during the resting phase (19Loo T.W. Clarke D.M.

The MTS-rhodamine results (this study) show that TM9 must also be close to or within the binding site for rhodamine-type compounds and would be next to TM6 (Fig. 6). Song and Melera (58Song J. Melera P.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) showed in hamster P-gp that there is close interaction between TMs 6 and 9 during drug binding. Mutations in TM9 (I837L and N839I) or in TM6 (G388A and A339P) resulted in similar drug resistance profiles with four structurally different drugs (increased resistance to vincristine or actinomycin D but decreased resistance to colchicine or daunorubicin relative to wild-type P-gp). It is interesting that the equivalent residues in human P-gp (Ile840 and Asn842 in TM9 and Gly341 and Ala342in TM6) are adjacent to the cysteines (A841C(TM9) and I340C(TM6)) the activities of which are protected by rhodamine B from inhibition by MTS-rhodamine (Fig. 5). Some studies have suggested that P-gp has four different drug interaction sites that substrates occupy different sites during transport or that each substrate has a distinct binding site (25Shapiro A.B. Fox K. Lam P. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 59Dey S. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These results are not incompatible with the model presented in Fig. 6. Although the model shows the presence of a common drug-binding site, it can be used to accommodate results that predict multiple drug-binding sites. We had proposed that substrates can create their own binding sites (“substrate-induced fit” hypothesis) by using a combination of residues from different TMs to form a particular drug-binding site (21Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35388-35392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Forming the drug-binding site this way would depend on the TMs being quite mobile. The binding of a particular substrate would result in a more “rigid” P-gp. Evidence that the TM segments are quite mobile comes from disulfide cross-linking studies (57Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). When thermal motion is reduced (4 °C), only residues at the cytoplasmic side in TMs 4 and 5 were cross-linked with that in TM12. At higher temperatures (21 and 37 °C), these residues as well as residues at the cytoplasmic side in TM 6 were cross-linked with those in TMs 10 and 11. The substrate-induced fit hypothesis would also explain why P-gp binds substrates with different affinities. When a particular substrate induces a particular fit in P-gp, then the combined effects of contributing residues from each TM would determine the affinity. Also, some substrates may share the same residue(s) during binding. For example, the activities of mutants L339C(TM6) and A342(TM6) are protected from inhibition by dibromobimane (21Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35388-35392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and MTS-verapamil (23Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14972-14979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) but not by MTS-rhodamine, whereas that of mutant V982C(TM12) is protected from inhibition by dibromobimane and MTS-rhodamine but not by MTS-verapamil. An interesting feature of the cysteine mutants that are inhibited with thiol-reactive compounds is that most are located near the middle of each TM segment (Fig. 7). When the drug-binding site is opened as a fan, it appears that the reactive residues form a ring. The substrates may recognize various combinations of residues in this ring during binding. Future work with other structurally diverse thiol substrates will determine whether other residues contribute to this “ring of recognition.” We thank Dr. Randal Kaufman (Boston, MA) for pMT21.

Recently, it was reported that S1P or VEGF treatment of endothelial cells leads to phosphorylation at Ser-1179 in bovine endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and this phosphorylation is critical for eNOS activation. S1P stimulation of eNOS phosphorylation was shown to involve Gi protein, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and Akt. VEGF also activates eNOS through Flk-1/KDR, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and Akt, which suggested that S1P and VEGF may share upstream signaling mediators. We now report that S1P treatment of bovine aortic endothelial cells acutely increases the tyrosine phosphorylation of Flk-1/KDR, similar to VEGF treatment. S1P-mediated phosphorylation of Flk-1/KDR, Akt, and eNOS were all inhibited by VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors and by antisense Flk-1/KDR oligonucleotides. Our study suggests that S1P activation of eNOS involves Gi, calcium, and Src family kinase-dependent transactivation of Flk-1/KDR. These data are the first to establish a critical role of Flk-1/KDR in S1P-stimulated eNOS phosphorylation and activation.

In the EDG family, EDG-1, EDG-3, EDG-5, EDG-6, and EDG-8 work as S1P receptors (15Hla T. Prostaglandins. 2001; 64: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 16Pyne S. Pyne N. Pharmacol.

Activation of EDG-1 receptor triggers several signaling pathways via pertussis toxin (PTx)-sensitive Gi protein. Although the signaling pathways activated by S1P have been extensively studied in several cell types, the precise signaling mechanism by which S1P elicits angiogenesis remains unclear. Recent studies revealed that S1P binding to EDG-1 receptor increases NO synthesis through the PI3K-Akt pathway in EC, similar to VEGF (17Kwon Y.G. Min J.K. Kim K.M. Lee D.J. Billiar T.R. Kim Y.M. J.

Transactivation of the EGF receptor by S1P has also been reported (28Kim J.H. Song W.K. Chun J.S. IUBMB Life. 2000; 50: 119-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that transactivation of a growth factor receptor may be involved in S1P-stimulated PI3K-Akt-eNOS phosphorylation and investigated the specific role of Flk-1/KDR. Here we show that S1P signaling increases tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGF receptor Flk-1/KDR. Importantly, we demonstrate that inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity of Flk-1/KDR reduces S1P-stimulated Akt and eNOS phosphorylation. These results demonstrate a critical role of Flk-1/KDR in S1P-induced PI3K-Akt-eNOS activation. S1P, o-phenanthroline,N-acetylcysteine (NAC), 4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzenedisulfonic acid (Tiron), ebselen, and diphenylene iodonium (DPI) were purchased from Sigma.

Poppa V. Ueba H., Wu, A. Yan C. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Confluent cells cultured in 60-mm dishes were serum-starved for 18–24 h and stimulated by S1P or VEGF. For the inhibitor studies, cells were pretreated with 50 ng/ml PTx for 24 h, 30 μm SU1498, 10 μm VTKi, 1 μm AG1478, 10 μg/ml 577B11, 20 μm BAPTA/AM, 10 μm PP2, 100 nm wortmannin, 10 μm o-phenanthroline, 1 μm GM 6001, 10 mm NAC, 10 mm Tiron, 40 μmebselen, or 10 μm DPI for 30 min or 5 μmcherelythrine for 10 min in serum-depleted medium. To distinguish the contribution of Flk-1/KDR in S1P-stimulated signaling, we treated BAEC with antisense S-oligonucleotide against bovine Flk-1/KDR mRNA. The same sequence of antisense S-oligonucleotide as reported by Bernatchez et al. (30Bernatchez P.N. Soker S. Sirois M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31047-31054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) against bovine Flk-1/KDR (AS-KDR: 5′-GCT GCT CTG ATT GTT GGG-3′) and as negative control, scrambled Flk/KDR (SCR-KDR: 5′-TGC TGG CAT GTG CGT TGT-3′) were purchased from custom DNA synthesis service of Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). For transfection, BAEC at 40–50% confluence in 60-mm dishes were washed twice with Opti-MEM. Forty μl of TransIT-LT1 (Mirus, Madison, WI) was mixed with 360 μl of Opti-MEM and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Then 1.5 μl of 1 mm antisense or scramble S-oligonucleotide was added to the solution, mixed gently, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. This mixture was added to BAEC in 2 ml of Opti-MEM (final concentration of S-oligonucleotide was 0.6 μm) and cultured for 4 h. The medium was changed to medium 199 with 10% serum and cultured for 20 h. The cells were washed with Opti-MEM and treated again with TransIT-LT1/S-oligonucleotide (final concentration 0.3 μm) for 4 h. The medium was changed to medium 199 with 10% serum, and cells were cultured for 20 h. Finally, cells were serum-starved for 24 h and stimulated by S1P or VEGF. Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (24Heeneman S. Haendeler J. Saito Y. Ishida M. Berk B.C. J. Biol.

BAEC were lysed in Triton/Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mmTris, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm KCl, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)), scraped off the dish, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was used as a total cell lysate. The supernatant was analyzed for protein concentration by the Bradford method (BioRad), and equal amounts of cellular proteins (50 μg/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (HybondTM ECL,Amersham Biosciences). After incubation in blocking solution (5% bovine serum albumin, phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20), membranes were incubated with appropriate primary antibodies, such as anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473), anti-phospho-eNOS (Ser-1177), or anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10) antibodies, for 2 h at room temperature. Membrane-bound primary antibodies were visualized by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL system. The membranes were reprobed with anti-Akt, anti-eNOS, or anti-Flk-1/KDR antibodies. Densitometric analyses of immunoblots were performed by NIH image. Results were normalized by arbitrarily setting the densitometry of control cells to 1.0. Lysates containing equal amounts (300 μg) of protein were incubated with antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After incubation with protein A/G PLUS-agarose for 2 h, precipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer and then resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After being heated at 100 °C for 5 min, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. BAEC were treated with 1 μm S1P for 0–60 min, cell lysates prepared, SDS-PAGE performed, and Western blots analyzed for phosphotyrosine. Very rapid and transient phosphorylation of a 230-kDa protein band (peak at 2 min) was observed (Fig.1 A, upper panel, B). Based on its molecular weight and tyrosine phosphorylation we predicted that this band was the VEGF receptor Flk-1/KDR. We reprobed the membrane with anti-Flk-1/KDR antibody and detected the same molecular mass band as a highly glycosylated mature form of Flk-1/KDR. A 200-kDa protein was also detected by anti-Flk-1/KDR antibody (presumably a less glycosylated form of Flk-1/KDR), but this band was not phosphorylated. As reported previously by Igarashi et al. (18Igarashi J. Bernier S.G. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12420-12426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and Morales-Ruiz et al. (19Morales-Ruiz M. Lee M.J.

The peak of Akt phosphorylation was at 3 min, that of eNOS was set at 5 min, and later both phosphorylations returned to baseline by 60 min. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the same molecular mass protein, Flk-1/KDR, was time-dependently tyrosine-phosphorylated in BAEC treated with VEGF. The 230-kDa protein, Akt, and eNOS are dose dependently phosphorylated in response to S1P (Fig. 1 D). The EC50 values for phosphorylation of the 230-kDa protein, Akt, and eNOS were ∼30 nm. To confirm that the 230-kDa protein was Flk-1/KDR, samples were immunoprecipitated either with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) or with anti-Flk-1/KDR antibody. Afterward, SDS-PAGE membranes were immunoblotted with anti-Flk-1/KDR antibody or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, the same 230-kDa protein was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with both anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and anti-Flk-1/KDR antibody when cells were treated with 1 μm S1P. Thus, the 230-kDa protein tyrosine-phosphorylated by S1P is Flk-1/KDR, which is transactivated by the S1P receptor, EDG-1. Comparison of the time course for phosphorylation of eNOS, Akt, and Flk-1/KDR indicated that phosphorylation of Flk-1/KDR was faster than eNOS or Akt (Fig. 1 B). This finding suggests that transactivation of Flk-1/KDR is “upstream” of the phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS. To access this mechanism, BAEC were pretreated with the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, SU 1498 and VTKi. Both compounds inhibited phosphorylation of Flk-1/KDR, Akt, and eNOS in response to either S1P or VEGF (Fig. 3). Based on these results it seems likely that transactivation of Flk-1/KDR is required for phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS induced by S1P. To determine if the transactivation of the EGF receptor family (ErbB family) tyrosine kinase contributes to S1P-mediated phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS, we used AG1478, an inhibitor of ErbB family kinases. AG1478 (1 μm) did not inhibit phosphorylation of eNOS, Akt, or Flk-1/KDR in response to S1P or VEGF stimulation. S1P did not stimulate the release of VEGF since the VEGF neutralization antibody 577B11 inhibited VEGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Flk-1/KDR, Akt, and eNOS, but not S1P-stimulated phosphorylation of these molecules. To verify the results of inhibitor studies described above, BAEC were pretreated with antisense Flk-1/KDR oligonucleotides and stimulated with S1P or VEGF. Because of low transfection efficiency of the antisense oligonucleotides to BAEC, Flk-1/KDR protein expression was decreased by about 50% similar to data as reported by Bernatchez et al. (30Bernatchez P.N. Soker S. Sirois M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31047-31054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) (Fig.4). The expression of Akt and eNOS did not change. After antisense oligonucleotides treatment, both S1P- and VEGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Flk-1/KDR, Akt, and eNOS were inhibited to a similar extent. There was no change in cells treated with scramble oligonucleotides. Thus, transactivation of Flk-1/KDR is required for phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS induced by S1P. To characterize the signal transduction pathway from the EDG-1 receptor to Flk-1/KDR, we examined the effects of several inhibitors on the phosphorylation of Flk-1/KDR, Akt, and eNOS after stimulation by S1P or VEGF (Fig. 5). As reported previously (18Igarashi J. Bernier S.G. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12420-12426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 19Morales-Ruiz M. Lee M.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 19672-19677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), the Gi inhibitor PTx blocked phosphorylation of Flk-1/KDR, Akt, and eNOS by S1P but had no effect on VEGF-stimulated phosphorylation. BAPTA/AM inhibited Flk-1/KDR phosphorylation by S1P but not by VEGF. This means that Ca2+ is required for the transactivation from EDG-1 to Flk-1/KDR. The Src kinase inhibitor, PP2, also blocked S1P-stimulated phosphorylation of Flk-1/KDR, but as expected had no effect on VEGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Flk-1/KDR. Interestingly, BAPTA/AM and PP2 inhibited both S1P- and VEGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS. The protein kinase C inhibitor, cherelythrine, had no effect on both S1P and VEGF-induced phosphorylation. Wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K, did not block the phosphorylation of Flk-1/KDR by S1P or VEGF, but inhibited Akt and eNOS phosphorylation. EGF receptor transactivation by several GPCR ligands involves activation of metalloproteases and release of heparin binding-EGF, an endogenous membrane binding ligand (32Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). Because VEGF-neutralizing antibody did not block S1P-stimulated Flk-1/KDR transactivation (Fig. 3), release of an endogenous ligand appeared unlikely. As shown in Fig. 1 CVEGF time dependently phosphorylated Flk-1/KDR, but the peak was 5 min, which is slower than S1P-stimulated phosphorylation (Fig.1 A). The rapid activation by S1P is also not consistent with release of an endogenous ligand. To rule out this mechanism, we pretreated BAEC with the metalloprotease inhibitors,o-phenanthroline and GM6001, and stimulated with S1P or VEGF. No effect was observed with these inhibitors (Fig.6 A). EGF receptor transactivation by AngII was reported to be ROS-dependent (33Ushio-Fukai M. Griendling K.K. Becker P.L. Hilenski L. Halleran S. Alexander R.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Therefore we examined the effects of various anti-oxidants NAC, Tiron, ebselen, and DPI on tyrosine phosphorylation of Flk-1/KDR by S1P (Fig.6 B). NAC, Tiron, and ebselen had no effect on S1P-stimulated phosphorylation of Flk-1/KDR, while DPI showed a partial inhibition. All four compounds showed no effect on VEGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Flk-1/KDR. Based on these findings, ROS appear not to be involved in S1P stimulated Flk-1/KDR transactivation. The major finding of the present study is that S1P transactivates the VEGF receptor Flk-1/KDR leading to phosphorylation and stimulation of the PI3K-Akt-eNOS pathway in endothelial cells. Based on our experiments and previously reported data we summarize that S1P stimulated eNOS activation as follows. VEGF receptor Flk-1/KDR localizes to caveolae (34Feng Y. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. Tsai N. Caldwell R.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), while EDG-1 receptor exists in both non-caveolae and caveolae membranes. After stimulation EDG-1 translocates and concentrates in caveolae (35Igarashi J. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32363-32370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Upon Giprotein-mediated activation of phospholipase C, intracellular Ca2+ levels increase and Ca2+ complexes with calmodulin (CaM). The Ca2+/CaM complex then activates eNOS (36Venema R.C. Sayegh H.S. Arnal J.F. Harrison D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14705-14711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Simultaneously, Ca2+ and Src family kinase-dependent transactivation of Flk-1/KDR occurs. Flk-1/KDR then stimulates Src family kinase and PI3K causing Akt and eNOS (Ser-1179) to be phosphorylated and activated. We speculate that different molecules of Src family kinase transduce the signaling before and after Flk-1/KDR. Ca2+/CaM and Ser-1179 phosphorylation synergistically activate eNOS (9Michell B.J. Griffiths J.E. Mitchelhill K.I. Rodriguez-Crespo I. Tiganis T. Bozinovski S. de Montellano P.R. Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 845-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In addition, heat shock protein 90 and other molecules are also likely to regulate eNOS activation (37Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar,38Fulton D. Gratton J.P. Sessa W.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 818-824PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to identify individual Src family kinases and other molecules involved in this pathway. EGF receptor transactivation by GPCR ligands has been well studied. The best elucidated mechanism involves binding of ligand to GPCR, activation of matrix metalloproteases, cleavage of membrane binding heparin binding-EGF, and binding of heparin binding-EGF to the EGF receptor (26Gschwind A. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Leserer M. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1594-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 27Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J.

Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). However Flk-1/KDR transactivation by S1P involves a different pathway since matrix metalloproteases are not involved (see Figs. 3 and 5 B). In fact, from comparison of Flk-1/KDR phosphorylation by S1P and VEGF, S1P-stimulated Flk-1/KDR-phosphorylation is faster than VEGF-stimulated (Fig.1 C). We found involvement of Gi, Ca2+, and Src family kinase in this transactivation pathway, suggesting a requirement for intracellular signals and/or membrane trafficking. Of interest S1P-mediated transactivation appeared not to require ROS (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, Ushio-Fukaiet al. (33Ushio-Fukai M. Griendling K.K. Becker P.L. Hilenski L. Halleran S. Alexander R.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) reported that antioxidants completely inhibit AngII-stimulated transactivation of EGF receptor, and we found that transactivation of the PDGF receptor was also inhibited by antioxidants (24Heeneman S. Haendeler J. Saito Y. Ishida M. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15926-15932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Further studies are necessary to elucidate the nature of Flk-1/KDR transactivation mechanism. Previously, Igarashi and Michel (39Igarashi J. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36281-36288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) reported S1P-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS. They proposed that Gβγ directly activated PI3Kβ and excluded tyrosine kinases in this pathway because genistein (10 μm), a broad spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor, did not inhibit the S1P-stimulated PI3Kβ activity. We believe the differences in our data are due to the fact that genistein at 10 μm cannot completely inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of Flk-1/KDR and Src family kinases. Similar to our data, Rikitake et al. (40Rikitake Y. Hirata K. Kawashima S. Ozaki M. Takahashi T. Ogawa W. Inoue N. Yokoyama M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) showed that the Src family inhibitor, PP2, inhibited S1P-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS. We are confident of the role of Flk-1/KDR since two specific Flk-1/KDR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, (VTKi and SU1498) with different chemical structures inhibited S1P-stimulated phosphorylation of Flk-1/KDR, Akt, and eNOS. In addition the antisense Flk-1/KDR oligonucleotides experiment confirms the requirement for Flk-1/KDR expression (Fig.4). The extent of Flk-1/KDR-phosphorylation induced by S1P was less than that induced by VEGF (Figs. 3, 4, 5, and 6), but phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS were similar (Figs. 3, 4, and 5). A likely explanation is that VEGF stimulation phosphorylates Flk-1/KDR at several tyrosine residues, including Tyr-801, -951, -996, -1054, -1175, -1214, -1223, -1305, -1309, and -1319. In contrast we speculate that S1P increases phosphorylation of only one or two tyrosines necessary for the activation of the PI3K-Akt-eNOS pathway. Recently, Takahashi et al. reported that phosphorylation of only one tyrosine (Tyr-1175) in Flk-1/KDR is essential for VEGF-stimulated activation of PLC-γ (41Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Chida K. Shibuya M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2768-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Further investigations are needed to identify the tyrosine residue(s) phosphorylated in response to S1P stimulation. We are grateful to Dr. Robert J. Bjercke (Texas Biotechnology Corporation) for providing 577B11 anti-VEGF neutralization antibody.

https://openalex.org/W2067151543,"MST1 is a member of the Sterile-20 family of cytoskeletal, stress, and apoptotic kinases. MST1 is activated by phosphorylation at previously unidentified sites. This study examines the role of phosphorylation at several sites and effects on kinase activation. We define Thr183 in subdomain VIII as a primary site of phosphoactivation. Thr187 is also critical for kinase activity. Phosphorylation of MST1 in subdomain VIII was catalyzed by active MST1 via intermolecular autophosphorylation, enhanced by homodimerization. Active MST1 (wild-type or T183E), but not inactive Thr183/Thr187 mutants, was also highly autophosphorylated at the newly identified Thr177 and Thr387 residues. Cells expressing active MST1 were mostly detached, whereas with inactive MST1, adhesion was normal. Active MKK4, JNK, caspase-3, and caspase-9 were detected in the detached cells. These cells also contained all autophosphorylated and essentially all caspase-cleaved MST1. Similar phenotypes were elicited by a caspase-insensitive D326N mutant, suggesting that kinase activity, but not cleavage of MST1, is required. Interestingly, an S327E mutant mimicking Ser327 autophosphorylation was also caspase-insensitive, but only when expressed in caspase-3-deficient cells. Together, these data suggest a model whereby MST1 activation is induced by existing, active MST kinase, which phosphorylates Thr183 and possibly Thr187. Dimerization promotes greater phosphorylation. This leads to induction of the JNK signaling pathway, caspase activation, and apoptosis. Further activation of MST1 by caspase cleavage is best promoted by caspase-3, although this appears to be unnecessary for signaling and morphological responses.

These kinases share a conserved catalytic (kinase) domain at the amino terminus and a C-terminal regulatory region of great structural diversity, which interacts with signaling molecules that regulate the cytoskeleton. Currently, four closely related MST kinases have been described (5Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. J. Biol.

Most Ste20 group kinases activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1cascades in the signaling pathways between the cellular membrane and the nuclear compartment (2Hagemann C. Blank J.L. Cell.

In yeast, the mating pheromone receptor Ste20p phosphorylates and activates a MAPK kinase kinase, Ste11p, raising the possibility that mammalian homologs of Ste20p (e.g. MST1 kinase) also function as MAPK kinase kinase kinases (3Wu C.

Wright M. Chernoff J. Clark E.A. Krebs E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2224-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). MST1 was shown to act upstream of MAPK kinases that regulate p38 and JNK activities, probably acting via the MAPK kinase kinase MEKK1 (10Graves J.D. Draves K.E. Gotoh Y. Krebs E.G. Clark E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14909-14915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). There is substantial evidence that MST1 promotes apoptosis, although its role in this process may vary in different cell types. Overexpression of MST1 can induce apoptosis and nuclear condensation in BJAB, 293T and COS-1 cells (4Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Draves K.E. Ambrose D. Han D.K. Wright M. Chernoff J. Clark E.A. Krebs E.G.

A consistent feature of MST1 in all tested cell types is its proteolytic cleavage by caspase, in response to apoptotic stimuli, to a 34–36-kDa product (hereafter referred to as 36-kDa MST1). Cleavage increases MST1 kinase activity severalfold (4Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Draves K.E. Ambrose D. Han D.K. Wright M. Chernoff J. Clark E.A. Krebs E.G.

Recently, a second caspase cleavage site was identified in the human MST1 sequence that is absent in mouse MST1 and in MST2 from several species (10Graves J.D. Draves K.E. Gotoh Y. Krebs E.G. Clark E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14909-14915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Mutation of this site has no impact on accumulation of the 36-kDa species. Expression of a kinase-dead MST1 mutant (K59R) can partially or fully suppress apoptosis or chromatin condensation in HL-60 and 293T cells treated with chemical apoptotic stimuli (15Ura S.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5211-5220Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This protective effect is associated with suppression of both JNK activity and DNA fragmentation. However, the K59R mutant fails to suppress apoptosis in BJAB and HeLa cells treated with Fas ligand or TNF-α (4Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Draves K.E. Ambrose D. Han D.K. Wright M. Chernoff J. Clark E.A.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The basis for the cell type- and stimulus-specific differences in MST function has not yet been elucidated. Interestingly, like PAK proteins (11Rudel T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 12Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), MST1 (full-length or cleaved) can have a profound effect on cell shape (cell rounding and detachment) independent of caspase activation and prior to nuclear condensation (13Lee K.K. Ohyama T. Yajima N. Tsubuki S. Yonehara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19276-19285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This action and the high basal activity of MST1 kinase suggest a possible function unrelated to apoptosis. Stress-inducing agents such as staurosporine and sodium arsenite (9Taylor L.K. Wang H.C. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10099-10104Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) can increase MST1 kinase activity; however, no physiological activator of MST1 has been identified, and little is known about the endogenous activation of MST1. Recently, it was proposed that in addition to caspase cleavage, MST1 phosphorylation at yet unidentified sites contributes to kinase activation (10Graves J.D. Draves K.E. Gotoh Y. Krebs E.G. Clark E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14909-14915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), as has been observed for PAK2 (20Gatti A. Huang Z. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21695-21700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) showed that dephosphorylation of MST1 with protein phosphatase-2A in vitro results in 3–4-fold stimulation of activity, suggesting that phosphorylation sites are involved in suppression of activity. The physiological occurrence of this type of phosphoregulation of MST1 has not been reported. To address some of the questions related to MST regulation, we performed a structure-function analysis of MST1 phosphorylation sites. We identified novel phosphorylation sites and, by mutational analysis, demonstrated a role for intermolecular autophosphorylation of the activation loop of MST1 in subdomain VIII. We identified Thr183 and Thr187 as essential for kinase activity and for effects on farther downstream targets such as MKK4 and JNK. Phosphorylation at Thr177 altered the electrophoretic mobility of MST1, suggesting an influence on the conformation of the activation loop. We also found that MST1 phosphorylation status had no effect on MST1 cleavage by caspase-3 during apoptosis, but might influence susceptibility to cleavage by other caspases. Mouse fibroblast NIH-3T3 cells and African green monkey kidney COS-1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were cultivated at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. MCF7 cells (MCF7/pBI pool) and caspase-3-expressing WTC3/MCF7 cells were kindly provided by Sophie Roy (Merck Frosst, Kirkland, Canada) and cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 μg/ml Geneticin, and 150 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). Apoptosis of MCF7 cells was induced by treatment with TNF (35 ng/ml) and cycloheximide (50 μm) for 6–7 h. Mouse osteoclast mRNA was reverse-transcribed with PowerScript reverse transcriptase (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), and full-length MST1 was amplified with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and mouse MST1-specific primers: Primer 1 containing anSfiI site (5′-CTTATGGCCATGGAGGCCATGGAGACCGTGCAGCTGAGGAACCCACC) and Primer 2 (5′-GGGAGATCTTTGTCAGAAGTTCTGTTGCCTCCTCTTCTTGGCTTCAATGG) containing a BglII site. The 1.45-kb PCR product was directionally inserted into the SfiI/BglII sites of pCMV-Myc (Clontech) in-frame with the Myc epitope tag and designated Myc-MST1(WT). The MST1 N-terminal kinase domain (amino acids 1–326) corresponding to the caspase cleavage product of mouse MST1 was amplified using Primer 1 together with Primer 3 (5′-TCGCGGTACCTCAATCCATTTCATCCTCCTCTGAGTT) containing a KpnI site and a termination codon. This was then ligated into the SfiI/KpnI sites of pCMV-Myc. C-terminally V5 epitope-tagged MST1 was constructed by cloning in-frame into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His vector (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. NIH-3T3 or COS-1 cells were seeded at 30,000 cells/cm2, and MCF7 cells were seeded at 50,000 cells/cm2 in six-well multi-dishes and allowed to adhere for at least 8 h or overnight before transfection. Cells were transfected with 0.8 μg of DNA and 4 μg of FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cultures were then maintained for at least 18 h before protein lysates were made. After treatments, cells were placed on ice and washed twice with ice-cold β-glycerophosphate/HEPES-buffered solution (β-HBS; 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EGTA, and 150 mm NaCl). For collection of floating cells, the culture medium was pooled with the washes and centrifuged at 5000 × g to pellet cells. Cell pellets were suspended in 1 ml of β-HBS, transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, and pelleted at 20,000 ×g. For collection of adherent cells, cells were scraped from the dish in ∼500 μl of residual β-HBS, transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, and pelleted at 20,000 × g. Cells were then lysed in β-HBS containing Triton X-100 (0.2%) supplemented with microcystin LR (1 μm), Na3VO4 (1 mm), dithiothreitol (1 mm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) (22Reszka A.A. Halasy-Nagy J. Rodan G.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford reagent kit (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein lysates were loaded and separated on 7.5, 12, or 4–15% gradient Tris-HCl gels (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, which were blocked with 5% milk and 5% bovine serum albumin in 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20). Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (1:50,000; Clontech); monoclonal anti-V5 epitope antibody (1:10,000; Invitrogen); phospho-Ab1 (raised against phospho-Ser189/Ser207 MKK3/6 peptide), phospho-Ab2 (raised against phospho-Thr423 PAK1 peptide), and phospho-Ab3 (raised against phospho-(R/K)X(R/K)XX(S/T) motifs; catalog no. 9611) (all from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA); and anti-phospho-Thr261 SEK1/MKK4 antibody, anti-phospho-Thr183/Tyr185 SAPK/JNK antibody, anti-phospho-Thr180/Tyr182 p38 MAPK antibody, and anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) antibody (all at 1:1000;Cell Signaling Technology) were diluted in blocking solution. Detection was performed with alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibodies (1:10,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and enhanced chemifluorescence substrate (Amersham Biosciences) using an Amersham Biosciences Storm system. Protein lysates (50 μg) were diluted in 1 ml of ice-cold β-HBS-IP (β-HBS containing Tween 20 (0.05%) and the protease inhibitor mixture noted above) and then combined with primary antibody (3 μg) and protein G-conjugated agarose beads (20-μl bead volume; Sigma). Lysate/antibody/bead mixtures were gently mixed overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed four times with ice-cold β-HBS-IP. Antibodies and antigen were released by suspending beads in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and boiled or mixed vigorously at 37 °C. Kinase assays were performed in-gel using the method described previously (17Reszka A.A. Halasy-Nagy J.M. Masarachia P.J. Rodan G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34967-34973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) with one modification: the kinase buffer contained 20 mm MgCl2 in place of 5 mm MnCl2. Lanes were loaded with equivalent amounts of protein lysate (5–10 μg/lane) or the entirety of each immunoprecipitation, and then gels were electrophoresed and processed for kinase assay. Dried gels were exposed to phosphorimaging screens and scanned and analyzed using the Amersham Biosciences Storm system. For auto- and transphosphorylation studies, Myc-tagged MST1, MST1(D326N), MST1(K59R/D326N), MST1-(1–326), and MST1(K59R)-(1–326) were separately transfected into COS-1 cells. Proteins were isolated 20 h after transfections, and the expression levels of diverse Myc-MST1 protein variants were assessed by Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody. Myc-tagged MST1 proteins were immunoprecipitated. To precipitate two different constructs on the same beads, lysates from independent transfections were mixed together prior to immunoprecipitation, which was then carried out as described above. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6) and 10 mm MgCl2). Kinase assays were performed in 50 μl of kinase buffer with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or in 1 mm ATP for 25 min at 30 °C. The kinase reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli sample buffer, and each reaction was subjected to SDS-PAGE using 12% acrylamide gels. The fluorescent caspase-3 (DEVDase) activity assay kit was from Biovision Inc.; caspase-9 (LEHDase) and caspase-8 (IETDase) activity assay kits were from Oncogene Research Products (Boston, MA). Cells were washed with Hanks' buffered salt solution and lysed and scraped in the lysis buffer supplied by the manufacturer. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and supernatants were assayed according to the instructions provided with each kit. 40–90 μg of total protein were used per assay, and activities were determined after a 2-h incubation at 37 °C. Values are in relative fluorescence units/μg of protein. Cells were cotransfected with various Myc-MST1-encoding plasmids (0.8 μg) and the pcDNA3.1/lacZi expression vector (0.5 μg; Invitrogen) as described above. After 48 h, the plates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and adherent cells were fixed in 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 5 min. After fixation, cells were stained overnight at 37 °C with 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal), 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, and 2 mm MgCl2 in phosphate-buffered saline. MST1 was cloned from mouse osteoclast-like cells by reverse transcription-PCR using specific primers for the mouse sequence and is referred to throughout as MST1(WT). A nucleotide missense mutation (Lys instead of Glu at residue 198), by comparison with the published mouse and human sequences, was corrected by site-directed mutagenesis (K198E). Constructs described hereafter were expressed with an N-terminal Myc tag, unless otherwise noted. The general features of MST1 and amino acid residues targeted in this study are depicted schematically in Fig.1. NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with full-length MST1 or cleaved MST1-(1–326), visualized in Fig. 2 (A and B) by immunoblot and in-gel kinase analyses, respectively. The in-gel kinase activity of the MST1(WT) construct was substantial (Fig.2 B) and was not further increased by staurosporine treatment of transfected NIH-3T3 or COS-1 cells (data not shown). Overexpression of active MST1(WT) caused cell rounding and eventual detachment of NIH-3T3 cells. This was recorded as a reduction in the number of adherent cells 24 h after transfection (Fig.3, A and B) and by the increase in the activity of the wild-type kinase in the floating cell population (Fig. 3 C).Figure 3Cell detachment by non-caspase-cleavable MST1(D326N), but not by inactive MST1(T183A). A, shown is the cell detachment induced by MST1 overexpression. MST1 constructs were cotransfected with β-galactosidase-encoding pcDNA3.1/lacZi in NIH-3T3 cells. After 48 h, adherent cells were fixed and stained for β-galactosidase activity. Bar = 100 μm. B, the number of β-galactosidase (β-Gal)-positive cells in 10 observation fields (×10) was determined. Results are means ± S.D. from a representative experiment. The experiment was repeated three times with similar results. C, cell lysates of adherent (A) and floating (F) cell populations were analyzed for kinase activities by in-gel kinase assays (upper panel), and caspase activation was assessed by immunoblotting for PARP (lower panel). Myc-tagged full-length MST1 (MST1 FL) and the Myc-tagged MST1 caspase cleavage product (MST1 1–326) are indicated. PARP (p116) and the caspase cleavage product of PARP (p89) are also marked.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate the contribution of MST1 cleavage and kinase activity to the effects of the exogenous constructs on morphology, we expressed kinase-dead (MST1(K59R)), truncated (MST1-(1–326)), and caspase-insensitive (MST1(D326N)) mutant kinases (Fig. 2, Aand B) in NIH-3T3 cells. Consistent with a previous report (13Lee K.K. Ohyama T. Yajima N. Tsubuki S. Yonehara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19276-19285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), kinase activity was required for MST1 induction of cell rounding and detachment (Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, the morphological phenotype and cell detachment generated by the full-length caspase-resistant (MST1(D326N)) and truncated (MST1-(1–326)) constructs were indistinguishable from those elicited by the MST1(WT) kinase. MST1 kinase activity thus seems to be both necessary and sufficient to produce morphological changes, in contrast to chromatin condensation, which requires MST1 caspase cleavage or expression of the truncated species (26Messmer U.K. Pereda-Fernandez C. Manderscheid M. Pfeilschifter J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 133: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To further investigate the link between MST1 activity, caspase activity, and cell detachment, we separately collected and analyzed adherent and detached cells. In terms of total protein, there were ∼3-fold more floating cells when transfected with MST1(WT) or MST1(D326N) than when transfected with vector as measured 24 h post-transfection. Caspase activities were measured directly or by PARP cleavage. Detachment of cells correlated with induction of apoptosis, as assessed by generation of the 89-kDa PARP fragment (Fig.3 C, lower panel), which was cleaved in all floating cell populations transfected with vector, MST1(WT), or MST1(D326N). This correlated with fluorometric measurements of caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities, which were increased by >90-fold in floating versus adherent cells (activity/mg of protein). Total caspase-3 activity in floating cells expressing MST1(WT) and MST1(D326N) was increased by up to 6.3- and 4.2-fold, respectively, compared with the vector control. This reflected both an increase in the number of detached cells and an up to 2-fold average increase in caspase activity per floating cell. MST1 activity was determined by in-gel kinase assays at the same 24-h time point (Fig. 3 C). To more accurately assess kinase activity per cell, lanes were loaded with equivalent amounts of protein. The activities of full-length MST1(WT) and MST1(D326N) were increased by ∼20-fold in floating versus adherent cells. The activity of the 36-kDa MST1(WT) caspase cleavage product was mostly found in the floating cell population and at levels equal to the full-length kinase. In adherent cells, the 36-kDa caspase-cleaved MST1(WT) kinase showed about one-fourth of the activity of the full-length kinase. Because MST1(D326N) was caspase-resistant, no 36-kDa kinase activity was observed, and the full-length activity was approximately equal to that of the combined full-length and caspase-cleaved MST1(WT) kinases. Together, these data suggest that expression of active MST1 leads to concomitant cell detachment and caspase activation. Caspase cleavage of MST1 in and of itself is not required for either process. Alignment of MST1 subdomain VIII with other members of the Ste20 family and MKK3 and MKK6 kinases (Fig. 4 A) shows conservation in MST1 of phosphoregulated residues. Thr177aligns with the phosphoacceptor Ser189/Ser207residues in MKK3 and MKK6, respectively; and Thr183 aligns with the phosphorylated Thr423 residue in PAK1. Thr175 and Thr187 are also conserved among the Ste20 family members, although phosphorylation at these sites has not been described. We used two approaches to investigate putative phosphorylation at these residues and their relationship to MST1 kinase function. (a) Using site-directed mutagenesis, we replaced all four putative phosphorylatable residues with alanine (T175A, T177A, T183A, and T187A) or glutamate (T175E, T177E, T183E, and T187E) and assessed catalytic activities (Fig. 4 B). (b) We used phospho-specific antibodies to probe for putative phosphorylation at Thr177 (antibody Ab1) and Thr183 (antibody Ab2) (Fig. 4 C), similar to a previous approach assessing phosphorylation at Thr423 of PAK1 (23Zenke F.T. King C.C. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32565-32573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Mutation of Thr183 and Thr187 altered the catalytic activity of MST1 (Fig. 4 B, lower panel). The T183A mutation reduced the estimated activity to 1–3% of that of MST1(WT). This substitution was somewhat more effective than the analogous T423A mutation in PAK1, which maintains 12% of the wild-type kinase activity (23Zenke F.T. King C.C. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32565-32573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Even more substantial was the complete loss of catalytic activity observed with the T187A mutation. Consistent with a role for Thr183 phosphorylation in MST1 kinase activation, the T183E mutant was partially active, with glutamate substituting for a putative phosphorylated threonine. However, the T187E mutant remained completely inactive, which is more analogous to the effects of similar substitutions in MAPKs such as ERK2 (24Zhang J. Zhang F. Ebert D. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Structure. 1995; 3: 299-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). As in the case of the K59R mutant, lack of kinase activity following expression of T183A (Fig. 3, A and B) and T187A or T187E (data not shown) resulted in little or no morphological rounding and detachment of NIH-3T3 cells. Meanwhile, expression of the mostly active T183E mutant caused morphological rounding and detachment that were comparable to those caused by the wild-type kinase (Fig. 3, A and B). Mutations of Thr175 and Thr177 did not alter catalytic activity (see T175A, T175E, T177A, and T177E in Fig. 4 B,lower panel), and morphological cell rounding was comparable to that obtained with the MST1(WT) kinase (data not shown). A phosphorylation-dependent MST1 band shift was recently reported for the cleaved MST1 kinase (13Lee K.K. Ohyama T. Yajima N. Tsubuki S. Yonehara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19276-19285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), although the responsible residue(s) were not identified. Likely candidates are identified here because mutations of Thr177 and Thr183 altered the electrophoretic mobility of the kinase. The T177A mutant showed reduced mobility of both the full-lengt"
https://openalex.org/W2024997053,"We recently demonstrated that suppressing 1alpha,25-(OH)2-D3 by increasing dietary calcium decreases adipocyte intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), stimulates lipolysis, and inhibits lipogenesis. High calcium diets also increase core temperature and white adipose tissue uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) expression in aP2-agouti transgenic mice. Accordingly, we have evaluated the role of 1alpha,25-(OH)2-D3 in regulating human adipocyte UCP2 expression. Treatment of human adipocytes for 48 h with 1 nM 1alpha,25-(OH)2-D3 inhibited UCP2 mRNA and protein levels by 50% (P<0.002) and completely blocked isoproterenol- or fatty acid-stimulated two- to threefold increases in UCP2 expression. However, a specific agonist for the membrane vitamin D receptor (mVDR), 1alpha,25-dihydroxylumisterol3, was unable to inhibit basal, isoproterenol-stimulated, or fatty acid-stimulated UCP2 expression, whereas a specific mVDR antagonist,1beta,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, was unable to prevent the 1alpha,25-(OH)2-D3 inhibition of UCP2 expression. In contrast, nuclear vitamin D receptor (nVDR) knockout via antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) prevented the inhibitory effect of 1alpha,25-(OH)2-D3 on adipocyte UCP2 expression and protein levels. These data indicate that 1a,25-(OH)2-D3 exerts an inhibitory effect on adipocyte UCP2 expression via the nVDR. Thus, suppression of 1alpha,25-(OH)2-D3 and consequent up-regulation of UCP2 may contribute to our previous observation of increased thermogenesis in mice fed with high calcium diets."

ABC transporters have two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD) and two transmembrane domains. The presence of the conserved “signature” sequence (LSGGQ) in each NBD is a unique feature in these transporters. The function of the signature sequences is unknown. In this study, we tested whether the signature sequences (531LSGGQ535 in NBD1;1176LSGGQ1180 in NBD2) in P-gp are in close proximity to the opposing Walker A consensus nucleotide-binding sequences (1070GSSGCGKS1077 in NBD2;427GNSGCGKS434 in NBD1). Pairs of cysteines were introduced into a Cys-less P-gp at the signature and “Walker A” sites and the mutant P-gps were subjected to oxidative cross-linking. At 4 °C, when thermal motion is low, P-gp mutants (L531C(Signature)/C1074(Walker A) and C431(Walker A)/L1176C(Signature) were cross-linked. Cross-linking inhibited the drug-stimulated ATPase activities of these two mutants. Their activities were restored, however, after addition of the reducing agent, dithiothreitol. Vanadate trapping of nucleotide at the ATP-binding sites prevented cross-linking of the mutants. These results indicate that the signature sequences are adjacent to the opposing Walker A site. They likely participate in forming the ATP-binding sites and are displaced upon ATP hydrolysis.

The signature sequences are present in all ABC transporters, but not in any other transporter (1Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar). The function of these sequences is unknown. Both NBDs must interact with each other, since both halves of P-gp are required for drug-stimulated ATPase activity (8Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Therefore, it is possible that the conserved signature sequence in each NBD may interact with Walker A consensus nucleotide-binding sequence (Walker A site) (10Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J.

In this study, we used cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and cross-linking analysis to test whether the signature sequence in each NBD is close to the site in the opposing NBD.

The samples were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, 15 min at 21 °C, or 5 min at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 4% (w/v) SDS) containing 50 mm EDTA and no reducing agent. The reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% polyacrylamide gels) and immunoblot analysis with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against P-gp (5Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

For vanadate trapping experiments, the membranes were incubated with an equal volume of TBS containing 12 mm ATP, 24 mmMgCl2, and 0.6 mm sodium vanadate for 10 min at 37 °C before cross-linking at 4, 21, or 37 °C. Purification of histidine-tagged P-gp mutants and assay of verapamil-stimulated ATPase activities were done as described previously (15Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The contact sites between the NBDs of P-gp are not known. It is possible that the conserved signature sequence in each NBD (531LSGGQ535 in NBD1 and1176LSGGQ1180 in NDB2) may interact with the Walker A site (427GNSGCGKS434 in NBD1 and1070GSSGCGKS1077 in NBD2) in the opposing NBD. Accordingly, we used disulfide cross-linking analysis to determine whether a cysteine introduced into the signature sequence in one NBD could be cross-linked to another cysteine introduced into the Walker A site in the opposing NBD. P-gp is an ideal membrane protein for cross-linking analysis because the Cys-less form of P-gp is functional and the cross-linked product migrates with reduced mobility on SDS-PAGE (16Loo T.W.

At 4 °C, the thermal motion of the protein would be reduced so that cross-linking should occur only if the cysteines are close together (20Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), while cross-linking of more distal cysteines would be expected only at higher temperatures (21 and 37 °C). The cross-linking results of three mutants, L531C/G1070C, L531C/S1072C, and L531C/C1074, are shown in Fig. 1. No cross-linked product was detected in mutant L531C/G1070C at any temperature. In mutant L531C/S1072C, no cross-linked product was detected when treated with oxidant at 4 °C. By contrast, there was partial cross-linking at 21 °C and almost complete cross-linking at 37 °C. The slow migrating cross-linked product was not detected when the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) was added after cross-linking. This indicates that the disulfide bond was cleaved by DTT. In mutant L531C/C1074, cross-linked product was detected at all three temperatures. Again, addition of DTT resulted in the disappearance of the cross-linked product and the appearance of the 170-kDa P-gp. The complete cross-linking results between the cysteines in the NBD1 terminal signature sequence (531LSGGQ535) and the cysteines in the NBD2 Walker A site (1070GSSGCGKS1077) are shown in TableI. Residues G1073C and C1074 in the NBD2 Walker A site and L531C and S532C in the NBD1 signature sequence appear to be closest, since mutants L531C/G1073C, L531C/C1074, and S532C/G1073C were cross-linked when treated with oxidant at 4 °C. The cysteines in other mutants (e.g. L531C/S1072C, S532/S1072C, and G533C/G1073C) must be further apart, since cross-linked product was only observed at either 21 or 37 °C. In all cases, there was no evidence of intermolecular cross-linking, since a product with a molecular mass greater than that of the cross-linked P-gp was not detected (data not shown). Also, no cross-linked product was observed in P-gp containing one cysteine (data not shown).Table ICross-linking between residues in the NBD1 signature sequence and in the NBD2 Walker A siteL531C (21%)aActivity of the single cysteine mutant relative to Cys-less P-gp.S532C (38%)G533C (91%)G534C (4%)Q535C (0%)4 °C21 °C37 °C4 °C21 °C37 °C4 °C21 °C37 °C4 °C21 °C37 °C4 °C21 °C37 °CG1070C (0%)−bNo cross-linked product detected in SDS-PAGE.−−−−−−−−−−−−−−S1071C (85%)−−*cRelatively weak cross-linking (<50% of P-gp cross-linked).−−−−−−−−+−−+S1072C (23%)−+cRelatively weak cross-linking (<50% of P-gp cross-linked).++dRelatively strong cross-linking (>50% of P-gp cross-linked).−++++−−+−−+−−−G1073C (4%)++++++++++−+++−−−−−−C1074 (103%)****** dRelatively strong cross-linking (>50% of P-gp cross-linked).eAsterisk sign in bold indicates cross-linking inhibited when preincubated with ATP plus vanadate.−**−−*−−−−−−G1075C (0%)−−++−−+−−−−−−−−−K1076C (12%)−−*−−−−−−−−−−−−S1077C (0%)−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−a Activity of the single cysteine mutant relative to Cys-less P-gp.b No cross-linked product detected in SDS-PAGE.c Relatively weak cross-linking (<50% of P-gp cross-linked).d Relatively strong cross-linking (>50% of P-gp cross-linked).e Asterisk sign in bold indicates cross-linking inhibited when preincubated with ATP plus vanadate. Open table in a new tab Structural changes that occur in P-gp immediately after ATP hydrolysis can be studied by vanadate trapping of the molecule in a transition state (21Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Vanadate traps ADP at one of the two NBDs by occupying the position of the γ-phosphate adjacent to ADP. Vanadate trapping at one site inhibits ATP hydrolysis at the second site. Accordingly, we examined the effect of vanadate trapping on cross-linking of all the mutants. Representative cross-linking results of two (NBD1 signature/NBD2 Walker A) mutants (L531C/G1073C and L531C/C1074) are shown in Fig. 2. For both mutants, cross-linking was done at 21 °C, after preincubation of the membranes with ATP plus vanadate for 10 min at 37 °C (22Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31800-31805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained when cross-linking was done at 4 or 37 °C after vanadate trapping (Table I). Cross-linking of mutant L531C/C1074 was almost completely inhibited by vanadate trapping of nucleotide. Similar results were observed in mutants L531C/S1071C, S532C/C1074, G533C/C1074C, and L531C/K1076C (Table I). Mutants L531C/C1074, L531C/S1071C, S532C/C1074, G533C/C1074, and L531C/K1076C had verapamil-stimulated ATPase activities of 22, 22, 30, 90, and 11% respectively, relative to Cys-less P-gp. The other mutants (Table I) such as L531C/G1073C (Fig. 2) showed no detectable inhibition of cross-linking when preincubated with ATP plus vanadate. A prerequisite step in vanadate trapping is hydrolysis of ATP, and an inactive mutant would not be expected to show evidence of vanadate trapping. This appears to be the case for mutants such as L531C/G1073C that showed no inhibition of cross-linking after treatment with ATP plus vanadate. All of these mutants had little or no ATPase activity (<5%). We then performed cross-linking analysis between cysteines in the NBD2-signature sequence (1176LSGGQ1180) and cysteines in the NBD1 Walker A site (427GNSGCGKS434). Cross-linking involving residues G427C, N428C, and S434C was not done because the single cysteine mutants, G427C and S434C, showed little or no activity (<5%), while N428C was defectively processed and rapidly degraded. The cross-linking results from the other 25 double cysteine mutants are shown in Table II. One mutant, L1176C/C431, was cross-linked at 4, 21, and 37 °C. Mutants L1176C/S429C and L1176C/G432C were cross-linked only at 21 and 37 °C, while cross-linking of mutants L1176C/G430C, S1177C/S429C, S1177C/G430C, S1177C/C431, S1177C/G432C, and G1179C/S429C was only observed at 37 °C.Table IICross-linking between residues in the NBD2 signature sequence and in the NBD1 Walker A siteL1176C (53%)aActivity of the single cysteine mutant relative to Cys-less P-gp.S1177C (35%)G1178C (78%)G1179C (14%)Q1180C (23%)4 °C21 °C37 °C4 °C21 °C37 °C4 °C21 °C37 °C4 °C21 °C37 °C4 °C21 °C37 °CS429C (38%)−bNo cross-linked product detected in SDS-PAGE.*cRelatively weak cross-linking (<50% of P-gp cross-linked).**−−*−−−−−+−−−G430C (12%)−−++dRelatively strong cross-linking (>50% of P-gp cross-linked).−−+−−−−−−−−−C431 (100%)*****dRelatively strong cross-linking (>50% of P-gp cross-linked).eAsterisk sign in bold indicates cross-linking inhibited when preincubated with ATP plus vanadate.−−*−−−−−−−−−G432C (0%)−+cRelatively weak cross-linking (<50% of P-gp cross-linked).++−−+−−−−−−−−−K433C (12%)−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−a Activity of the single cysteine mutant relative to Cys-less P-gp.b No cross-linked product detected in SDS-PAGE.c Relatively weak cross-linking (<50% of P-gp cross-linked).d Relatively strong cross-linking (>50% of P-gp cross-linked).e Asterisk sign in bold indicates cross-linking inhibited when preincubated with ATP plus vanadate. Open table in a new tab Inhibition of cross-linking by vanadate trapping was tested with all the mutants. Cross-linking of four mutants, L1176C/S429C, S1177C/S429C, L1176C/C431, and S1177C/C431, was inhibited by preincubation with ATP plus vanadate (Table II). A representative blot of mutant L1176C/C431 is shown in Fig. 2. No inhibition of cross-linking by vanadate trapping was observed in mutants such as L1176C/G430C, L1176C/G432C, S1177C/G430C, or S1177C/G432C. Inhibition of cross-linking by vanadate plus ATP again correlated with the ATPase activity of the mutants. All of the mutants that had cross-linking inhibited by vanadate trapping had verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity (>23% of Cys-less P-gp), while those that did not show inhibition had little or no verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity (<5%). Is the cross-linking method specific? To address this question we also constructed 120 other double cysteine mutants. Each mutant had a cysteine in the NBD1-signature sequence and another in a segment of the second cytoplasmic loop (residues Asn280 to Ile289) connecting TMs 4 and 5, in the NBD2-signature sequence, in the conserved Q-loop (residues 1114Q to1121I) in NBD2, or in the D-loop (residues (Ser1204 to Ser1211). The d- and Q-loops are highly conserved regions in ABC proteins (23Schneider E. Hunke S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When these mutant P-gps were expressed in HEK 293 cell and subjected to oxidative cross-linking with copper phenanthroline at 37 °C, there was no cross-linked product detected in SDS-PAGE (data not shown). These results indicate that cross-linking between residues in the signature sequences and in the Walker A sites was specific. The cross-linking results indicate that the signature sequence in each NBD is very close to the Walker A site in the opposing NBD. To confirm that this structural arrangement is present in the active molecule, we tested the effect of cross-linking on drug (verapamil)-stimulated ATPase activity. Two mutants, L531C/C1074 and L1176C/C431, were selected for analysis; because these residues are found at identical positions when the two halves of P-gp are aligned, both mutants can be cross-linked with oxidant at 4 °C and both retained ATPase activity (22 and 41%, respectively, relative to Cys-less P-gp). Fig. 3 shows that the activities of mutants L531C/C1074 and L1176C/C431 after treatment with oxidant were inhibited 82 and 72%, respectively. The activities of both mutants were almost completely recovered after treatment with DTT. These results are consistent with the idea that disulfide bond formation is occurring in functional molecules and that cross-linking between the signature sequence in each NBD with the opposing Walker A site inhibits activity. This study shows that the NBD1 Walker A site is close to the NBD2 signature sequence, while the NBD2 Walker A site is close to the NBD1 signature sequence. The residues closest to each other are Cys431(NBD1)/Cys1176(NBD2) at one ATP-binding site and Cys531(NBD1), Cys532(NBD1)/Cys1073(NBD2), and Cys1074(NBD2) at the other ATP-binding site, since they were cross-linked at 4 °C, a temperature at which molecular motion would be expected to be low (Fig. 4). This implies that the residues in the Walker A site and in the signature sequences must be about 5–8 Å apart, as this is the distance between the Cα bonds of a disulfide bond (24Richardson J.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1981; 34: 167-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (3063) Google Scholar). The close association between NBD1 and NBD2 is consistent with the observation that these domains will associate with each other when expressed as separate polypeptides (25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21839-21844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of cysteine residues in the signature and Walker A sites of the active mutants was blocked by vanadate trapping of nucleotide. Hydrolysis of ATP was essential, since inhibition of cross-linking was not observed in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMP.PNP (data not shown) or in the inactive mutants (e.g. mutant L531C/G1073C; Fig. 2). Vanadate trapping of nucleotide by P-gp only occurs at one site (either NBD1 or NBD2) at a time and in a random manner (26Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Our study also supports the notion that there is movement of the signature and Walker A sites during the transition state (28Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

The crystal structures of some bacterial ABC transporters, however, have been reported recently. Our biochemical data for the NBDs of P-gp are different from that deduced from the crystal structures of the NBDs of histidine permease (HisP) (29Hung L.W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar), the maltose transporter (MalK) (30Diederichs K. Diez J. Greller G. Muller C. Breed J. Schnell C. Vonrhein C. Boos W.

Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). In the MalK and HisP proteins, the signature sequences and the Walker A sites were on opposite ends of the complex, while in MsbA, the two NBDs were more than 50 Å apart. The crystal structures of three other bacterial proteins support the biochemical data from P-gp. In the DNA repair enzyme Rad50 (32Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P.

Cell. 2002; 10: 139-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar), the signature sequences were reported to be close to the Walker A sites and contributed to ATP binding. A recent biochemical study of the MalK NBDs also suggested potential interaction between the signature sequences and the Walker A site (35Fetsch E.E. Davidson A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9685-9690Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). They reported vanadate-catalyzed photo-cleavage of the signature sequence. Therefore, the NBDs of some bacterial and eukaryotic ABC transporter may have some similar features. Major structural changes occur in the NBDs (this study) and in the TM domains (19Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3511-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 22Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Further studies will be required to determine how conformational changes in the NBDs are transmitted to the TM domains."
https://openalex.org/W2026644592,"Homer proteins form an adapter system that regulates coupling of group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors with intracellular inositol trisphosphate receptors and is modified by neuronal activity. Here, we demonstrate that Homer proteins also physically associate with ryanodine receptors type 1 (RyR1) and regulate gating responses to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, depolarization, and caffeine. In contrast to the prevailing notion of Homer function, Homer1c (long form) and Homer1-EVH1 (short form) evoke similar changes in RyR activity. The EVH1 domain mediates these actions of Homer and is selectively blocked by a peptide that mimics the Homer ligand. 1B5 dyspedic myotubes expressing RyR1 with a point mutation of a putative Homer-binding domain exhibit significantly reduced (∼33%) amplitude in their responses to K<sup>+</sup>depolarization compared with cells expressing wild type protein. These results reveal that in addition to its known role as an adapter protein, Homer is a direct modulator of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release gain. Homer is the first example of an ""adapter"" that also modifies signaling properties of its target protein. The present work reveals a novel mechanism by which Homer directly modulates the function of its target protein RyR1 and excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal myotubes. This form of regulation may be important in other cell types that express Homer and RyR1."
https://openalex.org/W2132757164,"Actin polymerization drives the extension of pseudopods required for phagocytosis. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is thought to play a central role in this process, because it interacts with several actin-regulatory proteins and undergoes acute and localized changes at sites of phagocytosis. We therefore studied whether phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIPK), the enzyme responsible for the generation of PIP2from phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, is involved in the control of phagocytosis. PIPKIα was found to accumulate transiently on forming phagosomes. To test the functional involvement of PIPKIα in particle engulfment, we generated a double mutant (D309N/R427Q) that lacks kinase activity. When ectopically expressed in cultured cells, this mutant is targeted to the plasma membrane and accumulates at the phagosomal cup during particle engulfment. Expression of PIP5KIα D309N/R427Q impaired phagocytosis in RAW264.7 macrophages and in engineered phagocytes generated by transfection of Fc receptors in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Inhibition of phagocytosis could not be attributed to defects in particle binding or receptor clustering, which was monitored using green fluorescent protein-tagged Fcγ receptors. Instead, expression of the inactive kinase diminished the accumulation of PIP2 and of F-actin in the phagosomal cup. These data suggest that PIPKIα activity is involved in the actin remodeling that is a prerequisite for efficient phagocytosis.

Phagocytosis is a fundamental component of the innate immune response in mammals. Macrophages and neutrophils have the ability to engulf invading microorganisms into a specialized compartment, known as the phagosome. Formation of phagosomes, where microbial killing occurs, is supported by the finely coordinated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, accompanied by remodeling of cellular membranes (1Allen L.A.

It is not known exactly how the deposition of F-actin at the site of phagosome formation is controlled, but membrane-associated molecules that regulate actin metabolism are likely involved in this process. Evidence from other systems suggests that Rho family GTPases and phospholipids are essential in F-actin polymerization and remodeling at the membrane. Of particular importance is phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a membrane-associated lipid that can bind to, and alter the activity of, several proteins that are directly involved in controlling the architecture of the actin skeleton (17Toker A.

These observations suggested that dynamic changes in the local availability of PIP2 are required for the assembly and subsequent remodeling of F-actin structures during phagosome formation. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the mechanism whereby PIP2 is regulated during phagocytosis and to evaluate its functional role in the engulfment process. Specifically, we examined the role that PIPKIα, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of PIP2, plays in phagocytosis. This required the design and transfection of kinase-inactive forms of the enzyme. We report that heterologous expression of such mutants impairs phagocytosis, without significantly altering the basal actin architecture of macrophages. Phagocytosis is a fundamental component of the innate immune response in mammals. Macrophages and neutrophils have the ability to engulf invading microorganisms into a specialized compartment, known as the phagosome. Formation of phagosomes, where microbial killing occurs, is supported by the finely coordinated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, accompanied by remodeling of cellular membranes (1Allen L.A.

Although phosphorylation of these GEFs is considered an activation mechanism, little is known about the upstream of PAK-interacting exchange factor (PIX), a member of the Dbl family of GEFs. We report here that phosphorylation of p85 βPIX/Cool/p85SPR is mediated via the Ras/ERK/PAK2 pathway. To understand the role of p85 βPIX in basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-induced neurite outgrowth, we established PC12 cell lines that overexpress the fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 in a tetracycline-inducible manner. Treatment with bFGF induces the phosphorylation of p85 βPIX, as determined by metabolic labeling and mobility shift upon gel electrophoresis. Interestingly, phosphorylation of p85 βPIX is inhibited by PD98059, a specific MEK inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of the ERK cascade. PAK2, a major PAK isoform in PC12 cells as well as a binding partner of p85 βPIX, also functions upstream of p85 βPIX phosphorylation. Surprisingly, PAK2 directly binds to ERK, and its activation is dependent on ERK. p85 βPIX specifically localizes to the lamellipodia at neuronal growth cones in response to bFGF. A mutant form of p85 βPIX (S525A/T526A), in which the major phosphorylation sites are replaced by alanine, shows significant defect in targeting. Moreover, expression of the mutant p85 βPIX efficiently blocks PC12 cell neurite outgrowth. Our study defines a novel signaling pathway for bFGF-induced neurite outgrowth that involves activation of the PAK2-p85 βPIX complex via the ERK cascade and subsequent translocation of this complex.

Kimura K.D. Kobayashi M. Ihara S. Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S., Ui, M. Iba H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Nagata S. Fukui Y. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 907-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Goi T. Rusanescu G.

Physiol. 2000; 183: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Growth factors such as NGF and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are potent extracellular stimuli for neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, a model system that has been widely used to understand the molecular mechanism of neurite outgrowth. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that bFGF also activates the specific GEFs for Rac1 and Cdc42. However, the signaling pathway that links bFGF to these GEFs has not yet been delineated. The p21-activated kinase (PAK) is central to cytoskeletal changes associated with neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (21Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The PAK family constitutes six distinct members, PAK1–6 (22Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), and their activities are up-regulated by interaction with the GTP-bound forms of active Rac1 or Cdc42 via a specific p21-binding domain in the N terminus (23Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar, 24Dan C. Nath N. Liberto M. Minden A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, PAK has been thought to be a downstream effector of Rac1 and Cdc42. It is somewhat surprising that Rac1/Cdc42-binding deficient PAK1 mutants induce a Rac phenotype in PC12 cells, because this result suggests that PAK acts upstream of Rac1 under certain circumstances and that its p21-binding domain is dispensable (25Obermeier A. Ahmed S. Manser E. Yen S.C. Hall C. Lim L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4328-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, expression of the membrane targeting form of kinase-negative PAK1 also causes morphological changes similar to those observed with wild type PAK1 (26Daniels R.H. Hall P.S. Bokoch G.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 754-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated further that the membrane targeting of PAK1 is sufficient for neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, suggesting that the major downstream mediators of PAK for cytoskeletal remodeling reside in the membrane. Given that PAK functions upstream of Rac1 and that targeting of PAK to the membrane is sufficient for neurite outgrowth, elucidation of the mechanism by which PAK is targeted to the membrane seems to be a prerequisite to understand how PAK exerts its effect on the actin cytoskeleton. Nck is an adaptor protein containing a single Src homology 2 (SH2) domain and three SH3 domains (27Lehmann J.M. Riethmuller G. Johnson J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Nck is constitutively associated with PAK1, and association is mediated through the interaction between the second SH3 domain of Nck and the first proline-rich sequence of PAK (28Bagrodia S.

On the other hand, the SH2 domain of Nck binds with high affinity to tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor kinases such as the platelet-derived growth factor receptor and the epidermal growth factor receptor (32Nishimura R., Li, W.

However, overexpression of Nck inhibits both the NGF- and bFGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, suggesting that proteins other than PAK are major downstream effectors and are more potent in inducing the proliferation of PC12 cells (37Rockow S. Tang J. Xiong W. Li W. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2351-2359PubMed Google Scholar). Nck-mediated PAK translocation and activation provide a clue that SH3 adaptor molecules other than PAK might be involved in the translocation of PAK. Recently, the PIX (PAK-interacting exchange factor)/Cool (cloned outof library) protein has been identified as a new PAK-binding partner (21Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). PIX was first cloned as p85SPR (SH3 domain-containing proline-rich protein) (38Oh W.K. Yoo J.C., Jo, D. Song Y.H. Kim M.G. Park D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The PIX family contains two members, αPIX and βPIX. βPIX exists as two distinct isoforms, β1 and β2, that are distinguished by the presence of a C-terminal coiled-coil leucine zipper domain (39Koh C.G. Manser E. Zhao Z.S., Ng, C.P. Lim L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4239-4251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primary β1PIX transcript can be spliced to produce three variants, β1PIX-a, β1PIX-b, and β1PIX-c (40Kim S. Kim T. Lee D. Park S.H. Kim H. Park D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Adding to the complexity, β1PIX-a (identical to p85SPR/p85Cool-1, which we designate p85 βPIX) can be expressed as a shorter protein, p50Cool (41Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordon K.A. Van Aelst L.

Chem. 2002; 277: 5644-5650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). All these isoforms share SH3, Dbl homology (DH), and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains at their N termini. The SH3 domain of PIX binds to a unique proline-rich PAK sequence (PXXXP) located between the third and the fourth conventional SH3-binding motif (PXXP). Through this interaction the PIX-PAK complex gains the much higher affinity (K d of 24 nm) than the Nck-PAK complex and co-localizes in focal complex (21Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Other domains of PIX, a GIT1-binding (GB) domain and a leucine zipper domain, are tandemly arranged at the C terminus. The GB domain is a site for interaction with ADP-ribosylation factor-GTPase-activating proteins such as Cat (cool-associated,tyrosine-phosphorylated), p95PKL (paxillin-kinase linker), and GIT (G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-interactingtargets) (43Bagrodia S.

Manser E. Loo T.H. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6354-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The leucine zipper domain at the C terminus was recently shown to mediate the homodimerization of PIX, which is essential for several features of cytoskeletal reorganization, such as membrane ruffles (46Kim S. Lee S.H. Park D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10581-10584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). αPIX has an additional calponin homology domain at the N terminus compared with βPIX. PIX exhibits a GEF activity toward both Rac1 and Cdc42 in vitro and in vivo (21Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). αPIX is activated by interaction with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) in the signaling pathway from the platelet-derived growth factor receptor and from the EphB2 receptor as well as in the integrin-induced signaling (47Yoshii S. Tanaka M. Otsuki Y. Wang D.Y. Guo R.J. Zhu Y. Takeda R. Hanai H. Kaneko E. Sugimura H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5680-5690Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As a result of this signaling, αPIX is redistributed to the membrane by forming a complex with these receptors via direct association with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3-kinase, and its GEF activity is enhanced by the membrane-targeted PI3-kinase. However, little is known about the signaling pathway of βPIX activation. In the present study, we show that p85 βPIX is phosphorylated in response to bFGF, and its upstream pathway is defined by the components Ras/Raf-1/MEK/ERK/PAK2. p85 βPIX has been shown to be constitutively associated with PAK2, a major PAK isoform in PC12 cells. Basic FGF induces phosphorylation of p85 βPIX through activation of PAK2, which acts downstream of the Ras/ERK cascade. Translocation of p85 βPIX to the lamellipodia at growth cones is dependent on this phosphorylation. These results suggest that the PAK2-dependent phosphorylation of p85 βPIX is a signal for targeting of the p85 βPIX-PAK2 complex to the lamellipodia at growth cones, where PAK2 regulates reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton for bFGF-induced neurite extension in PC12 cells.

This cell line is a stable transfectant of pTRE-DN-Ras encoding a dominant negative form of Ras (N17 Ras), which is expressed in a doxycycline-inducible manner. FGF receptor-1 (FGFR-1) cDNA for inducible expression was amplified by the PCR from rat FGFR-1 cDNA (48Kim E.G. Kwon H.M. Burrow C.R. Ballermann B.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F66-F73PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned into EcoRI/XbaI sites of pTRE (Clontech). Primers were used as follows: 5′ primer (5′-GAATCCATGTGGGGCTGGAGGGGCCTC-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-TCTAGATCAGCGCCGGTTGAGTCCG-3′). The p85 βPIX construct was amplified using mouse p85 βPIX cDNA (identical to β1PIX-a isoform) as template (38Oh W.K. Yoo J.C., Jo, D. Song Y.H. Kim M.G. Park D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), followed by introduction into theXhoI/EcoRI sites of pEGFP-C2 or pDS-Red2-C1 (Clontech).

To generate mutant cDNAs, mutagenesis was conducted using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The p85 βPIX mutant (S525A/T526A) was generated by mutagenic PCR using sense (5′-GCTGTGCGCAAGGCCGCAGCGGCGCTGGAAGC-3′) and antisense (5′-TTCCAGCGCCGCTGCGGCCTTGCGCACAGC-3′) oligonucleotides. The PAK1 (T423E), PAK2 (T402E), and PAK2 (P185A/R186A) mutants were generated by mutagenic PCR using sense (5′-CAGAGCAAACGGAGCGAGATGGTAGGAACCCCA-3′, 5′-AGCAAACGCAGTGAGATGGTTGGAACGCCA-3′, and 5′-CCCGTCATTGCCGCTGCGCCAGATCATACA-3′) and antisense (5′-TGGGGTTCCTACCATCTCGCTCCGTTTGCTCGT-3′, 5′-TGGCGTTCCAACCATCTCACTGCGTTTGCT-3′, and 5′-TGTATGATCTGGCGCAGCGGCAATGACGGG-3′) primers, respectively. PAK inhibitory domain (PID) cDNA (226–447 bp) was amplified from human PAK1 with PID5 (5′-GAATTCCACACAATTCATGTCGG-3′) and PID3 (5′-GTCGACTAGATGACTTATCTGTAAAG C-3′) primers and subcloned intoEcoRI/SalI sites of pEGFP-C2. pTM-MEK-S218A/S222A (dominant negative MEK1) was kindly provided by Dr. K. C. Chung (College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea). PC12FW cells were incubated in phosphate-free DMEM containing doxycycline (1.5 μg/ml) for 24 h and stimulated for 4 h in the presence or absence of bFGF (10 ng/ml). During the stimulation, cells were labeled with [32P]H3PO4 (0.3 mCi/ml). After aspiration of medium, cells were washed extensively with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4) and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 200 μm orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 12,000 rpm and immunoprecipitated with anti-p85 βPIX antibody. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with lysis buffer and twice with ice-cold PBS. Each sample was resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled at 100 °C for 5 min, resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a membrane. p85 βPIX was detected by autoradiography and confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-p85 βPIX antibody. For labeling of pEGFP-p85 βPIX, (wild type) or pEGFP-Mp85 βPIX (mutant type, S525A/T526A),transfected cells, the same procedure was employed except for immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP antibody. PC12-tet-on cells (Clontech) were routinely cultured on poly-l-lysine-coated tissue culture dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% Tet System-approved fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Clontech), 2 mm glutamine, 1× antibiotics (Invitrogen), and 100 μg/ml G418. PC12FW cells were grown in the same medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml hygromycin B. Prior to differentiation, PC12FW cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM with 1.5 μg/ml doxycycline for 24 h to induce FGFR expression. Culture medium was then replaced by DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, 10 ng/ml bFGF (Invitrogen), and 1.5 μg/ml doxycycline. bFGF-containing medium was changed every 48 h. After 2–4 days of bFGF treatment, cells showing a typical phenotype were captured by the SPOT system with an inverted phase contrast microscope (Fig. 1 B). Transfected cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) were monitored by fluorescence with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, CK-40). bFGF-induced differentiation was measured by scoring as positive those green cells with one or more growth cone-tipped neurites longer than two cell bodies in length (26Daniels R.H. Hall P.S. Bokoch G.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 754-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Cells from at least 10 different microscope fields of view were counted with a fluorescence microscope. Transfection was performed with the calcium phosphate transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Briefly, 1 μg of pTK-HYG and 10 μg of pTRE-FGFR-1 were resuspended in 0.3 ml of 2× HBS (0.5% HEPES, 0.8% NaCl, 0.1% dextrose, 0.01% anhydrous Na2HPO4, 0.37% KCl; pH adjusted to 7.05) and mixed with 36 μl of 2 m CaCl2. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min prior to addition to the cells. Cells were grown for 24 h in nonselective culture medium and then replaced by complete DMEM containing 250 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). After 14 days of culture in the hygromycin B-containing medium, hygromycin B-resistant colonies were isolated and transferred to 96-well plates. The selected colonies were subcloned to obtain populations of single cells, and selection pressure was maintained subsequently in the presence of 50 μg/ml hygromycin B and 100 μg/ml G418. To measure expression levels of FGFR-1, a receptor binding assay was conducted. Cells were incubated with 0.2 ng/ml125I-labeled bFGF in binding buffer (DMEM, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) for 3 h at 4 °C and washed twice with a solution of 1.6 m NaCl in PBS, pH 7.5. To release 125I-labeled bFGF from FGFR-1, cells were incubated in a solution of 2 m NaCl in PBS, pH 4.0, for 5 min. Expression levels of FGFR-1 were calculated by counting radioactivity of released 125I-labeled bFGF. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of unlabeled recombinant bFGF. PC12FW cells were seeded on sterilized glass coverslips that had been pre-coated with 20 μg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and inserted into 6-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well). For transfection and localization of proteins, PC12FW cells were induced to differentiate in complete media containing 10 ng/ml bFGF for 48 h and transfected with pEGFP-p85 βPIX or various vector constructs using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were incubated in DMEM containing 2% FBS in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml bFGF for 24–48 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 min. After fixation the coverslips were washed twice in PBS and mounted onto a glass slide with gelvatol. Fluorescence was visualized with a laser confocal microscope (MRC-1024, Bio-Rad). We usually obtained 60–70% transfection efficiency, except for pEGFP-Mp85 βPIX (mutant type, S525A/T526A) of ∼30%, as determined by counting the number of fluorescence positive cells relative to the total number of cells per field (×200). PC12FW cells were pre-treated with the following various inhibitors: PD98059 (50 μm), staurosporine (200 nm), K-252a (200 nm), LY294002 (50 μm), calphostin C (2 μm) or KN-62 (10 μm) for 1 h and stimulated with 10 ng/ml bFGF for 1 h. At the end of the incubation period, cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and solubilized in lysis buffer. The lysates were boiled for 5 min, resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a PVDF membrane. Mobility shift of p85 βPIX on electrophoresis was detected by immunoblotting with anti-p85 βPIX antibody. PC12FW cells were starved in serum-free DMEM containing doxycycline for 24 h. They were then stimulated with 10 ng/ml bFGF for 1 h and solubilized in lysis buffer. Cell lysates were incubated with alkaline phosphatase (25- 100 units/100 μl) and protein phosphatase 2A (2 units/100 μl) in dephosphorylation buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, followed by immunoblotting with anti-p85 βPIX antibody. PC12FW cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml bFGF for the indicated times and lysed in the lysis buffer described under “Metabolic Labeling.” Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PAK2 antibody. Immunoprecipitated PAK2 was incubated in kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm ATP) containing 5 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Phosphoproteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and exposed to x-ray film. GST and His-tagged PAK1 and PAK2 proteins were expressed in E. coli (DH5α and M15) according to the manufacturer's instruction, respectively. Equal amounts of GST or GST-ERK1 beads were incubated with bacterial lysates containing PAK1-His or PAK2-His for 1 h at room temperature in the lysis buffer described under “Metabolic Labeling.” The beads were washed with the lysis buffer, resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and then resolved b"
https://openalex.org/W2009813647,"The calcium-activated phosphatase calcineurin has been implicated as a critical intracellular signal transducer of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Although previous data suggested the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) as its sole transcriptional effector, the absolute requirement of NFAT as a mediator of calcineurin signaling has not been examined in the heart. We therefore investigated the expression and activation profile of NFAT genes in the heart. Four members (NFATc1–c4) are expressed in cardiomyocytes, elicit nuclear translocation upon calcineurin activation, and are able to drive transactivation of cardiac promoter luciferase constructs. To define the necessary function of NFAT factors as hypertrophic transducers, a dominant negative NFAT construct was created, encompassing part of the N-terminal region of NFATc4 containing a conserved calcineurin-binding motif. Cotransfection of this construct dose-dependently abrogated promoter activation, irrespective of the NFAT isoform used, whereas a control construct with the calcineurin-binding motif mutated displayed no such effects. Adenoviral gene transfer of dominant negative NFAT rendered cardiomyocytes resistant toward all aspects of calcineurin or agonist-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, whereas adenoviral gene transfer of the control construct had no discernable effect on these parameters. These results indicate that multiple NFAT isoforms are expressed in cardiomyocytes where they function as necessary transducers of calcineurin in facilitating cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.

Heart failure is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in industrial countries, affecting over 10 million Americans and Western Europeans, with a 5-year mortality approaching 50% despite current medical therapy (1Cleland J.G. Khand A. Clark A. Eur. Heart J. 2001; 22: 623-626Google Scholar). 1www.americanheart.org/statistics. 1www.americanheart.org/statistics.These mortality figures reflect the lack of biologically efficacious therapies directed against the underlying disease processes that lead to maladaptive left ventricular remodeling and, ultimately, failure itself. In response to a plethora of intra- and extracardiac stimuli, cardiomyocytes exhibit cellular enlargement or hypertrophy as a compensatory adaptation to increased ventricular wall stress (3Hunter J.J. Chien K.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 1276-1283Google Scholar). However, sustained cardiac hypertrophy is the single most important risk factor for the development of heart failure (4Chien K.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 555-558Google Scholar, 5Lorell B.H. Carabello B.A. Circulation. 2000; 102: 470-479Google Scholar). Because intracellular signaling pathways are thought to both initiate and perpetuate the cardiac hypertrophic response and its transition to dilated failure, recent investigation has attempted the identification of key regulatory factors with the goal of defining novel therapeutic targets (3Hunter J.J. Chien K.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 1276-1283Google Scholar). One recently characterized intracellular signaling pathway that links extracellular stimuli to a hypertrophic transcriptional response employs the phosphatase calcineurin and its downstream transcriptional effector nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT). 2The abbreviations used are: NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T-cells; AKAP79 , A-kinase anchoring protein 79; dnNFAT, dominant negative NFAT; ANF, atrial natriuretic factor; Adβgal, adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase; AdCnA, adenovirus expressing an activated mutant of calcineurin; BNP, brain natriuretic factor, CnA, calcineurin; CT-1, cardiotrophin-1; DSCR1, Down's syndrome critical region 1; Endo-1, endothelin-1; MCIP1, myocyte-enriched calcineurin inhibitory protein, NP40, Nonidet P-40; RT, reverse transcriptase; HA, hemagglutinin; aa, amino acid(s); CMV, cytomegalovirus; fw, forward; rv, reverse; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; GSK-3, glycogen synthase kinase-3. 2The abbreviations used are: NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T-cells; AKAP79 , A-kinase anchoring protein 79; dnNFAT, dominant negative NFAT; ANF, atrial natriuretic factor; Adβgal, adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase; AdCnA, adenovirus expressing an activated mutant of calcineurin; BNP, brain natriuretic factor, CnA, calcineurin; CT-1, cardiotrophin-1; DSCR1, Down's syndrome critical region 1; Endo-1, endothelin-1; MCIP1, myocyte-enriched calcineurin inhibitory protein, NP40, Nonidet P-40; RT, reverse transcriptase; HA, hemagglutinin; aa, amino acid(s); CMV, cytomegalovirus; fw, forward; rv, reverse; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; GSK-3, glycogen synthase kinase-3. Four of the five NFAT proteins (NFATc1, NFAT2, or NFATc; NFATc2, NFAT1, or NFATp; NFATc3, NFAT4, or NFATx; and NFATc4 or NFAT3) reside in the cytoplasm in unstimulated cells but quickly translocate to the nucleus in response to stimulation that promote Ca2+ mobilization (6Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Google Scholar). The Ca2+-calmodulin-activated phosphatase calcineurin physically interacts with NFAT members within the cytoplasm, where it directly dephosphorylates multiple serine residues within the N-terminal regulatory domain of NFAT, resulting in the unmasking of two nuclear localization sequences required for nuclear import (7Aramburu J.

The identification of calcineurin as a signaling factor has attracted considerable interest, in part due to the demonstration that the calcineurin inhibitory drugs cyclosporin A and FK506 were shown to abrogate the cardiomyopathic response in several, but not all, rodent models of congenital and acquired forms of hypertrophic heart disease (reviewed in Refs. 12Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 731-738Google Scholar and 13Bueno O.F. van Rooij E. Molkentin J.D. Doevendans P.A. De Windt L.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 53: 806-821Google Scholar). A central role for calcineurin in the cardiac hypertrophic response was substantiated by the observation that hearts from transgenic mice expressing either MCIP1, a dominant negative calcineurin mutant, or the calcineurin inhibitory domains of Cain or AKAP79, were largely resistant to pleiotropic, hypertrophic stimuli (14Zou Y.

Bueno O.F. Liang Q. Delling U. Braz J.C. Glascock B.J. Kimball T.F. del Monte F. Hajjar R.J. Molkentin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3322-3327Google Scholar). More recently, calcineurin Aβ gene-targeted mice were generated and shown to be defective in mounting a cardiac hypertrophic response due to pressure overload or agonist infusion (17Bueno O.F. Wilkins B.J. Tymitz K.M. Glascock B.J. Kimball T.F. Lorenz J.N. Molkentin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4586-4591Google Scholar). Although a large number of studies have convincingly demonstrated the importance of calcineurin as a hypertrophic mediator, the importance of the downstream NFAT factors has not been evaluated in cardiomyocytes. In the present study we demonstrate the presence of all four calcineurin-sensitive members of the NFAT family (NFATc1, -c2, -c3, and -c4) in the ventricular cardiomyocyte cell lineage. All four isoforms displayed calcineurin-dependent nuclear translocation and the ability to transactivate cardiac promoters. To simultaneously inhibit all myocardial NFAT factors in an effort to effectively examine their necessary function as hypertrophic transducers, a dominant negative NFAT strategy was developed. Dominant negative NFAT dose-dependently abrogated calcineurin-NFAT-dependent transactivation ofMCIP1 and BNP promoter luciferase constructs. Adenoviral-mediated gene transfer of dominant negative NFAT in cultured cardiomyocytes efficiently inhibited calcineurin- and agonist-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Taken together, these data demonstrate a previously unexpected level of redundancy of the downstream targets of calcineurin and establish their requirement in pathophysiological signaling in the cardiomyocyte. Expression vectors containing a constitutively activated mutant of calcineurin Aα (CnAα), NFATc1, -c3, or -c4 were described previously (10Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J.

A constitutively activated FLAG-tagged NFATc3 clone was PCR-generated (fw, 5′-GGTGGGTCAGGCCTTGGCCTT; rv, 5′-TTAGAGCCCATCAGATCTTCC) and lacks the first 315 N-terminal aa of the published human NFATc3/NFATx sequence (PubMed U85429). The fragment was cloned into the EcoRI site of the pECE vector to include a N-terminal FLAG-tag to generate pECE-(Δ315)NFATc3. A construct encompassing aa 3–191 of murine NFATc4 was PCR-generated (fw, 5′-GCCGCAAGCTGCGAGGATGAG; rv, 5′-GACGGCTCGGGCTGAAGA) and subcloned as an EcoRI fragment into the pECE vector to incorporate an N-terminal FLAG-epitope to generate pECE-NFATc4(PXIXIT). A human BNP promoter-luciferase construct was obtained by cloning an 1800-bp PCR-amplified fragment of the proximal human BNP promoter sequence from genomic DNA (fw, 5′-GTAGAAACACCTTGTGATCAC; rv, 5′-GGGACTGCGGAGGCTGCT) into the HindIIII site of pGL3 (Promega) to generate pGL3-hBNP(1800)Luc. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange-XL kit from Stratagene. Two GATA sites centered at −116 (10Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J.

Subsequently, the NFAT site centered at −927 (10Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N.

An MCIP1-luciferase reporter, containing a 904-bp intragenic sequence encompassing the third intron of the human MCIP1 (DSCR1) gene (18Yang J. Rothermel B. Vega R.B. Frey N. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: E61-E68Google Scholar), was PCR-generated from genomic DNA (fw, 5′-CAACCTCTGGCATAAAT; rv, 5′-CTTGAGCTGGTGCTTATAAA) and cloned as a HindIII fragment in pGL3 to generate pGL3-hMCIP1(Int3)Luc. This reporter is identical as described previously (18Yang J. Rothermel B. Vega R.B. Frey N. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: E61-E68Google Scholar). All new PCR-generated constructs were amplified using the Accutaq high fidelity system (Sigma) and confirmed by diagnostic restriction and double-strand sequencing analysis. Adult mouse ventricular myocytes were isolated as described previously (19Schaap F.G. Binas B. Danneberg H. van der Vusse G.J. Glatz J.F. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 329-337Google Scholar), pelleted by centrifugation, and stored at −80 °C. Isolation and culture of neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes was performed as described before in detail (20Taigen T. De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Molkentin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1196-1201Google Scholar). Low passage COS-7 and HEK 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. COS-7 cells were grown in 12-well plates and transfected using 5 μl of FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis) and a total of 2 μg of DNA, consisting of the above luciferase reporter constructs, in the presence or absence of expression vectors for ΔCnA; NFATc1, -c2, -c3, or -c4; pECE-NFATc4(PXIXIT); pCDNA3-NFATc4(Ala mut); pECE-(Δ315)NFATc3; or pCG-GATA4 as indicated. In addition, 20 ng of pRL-CMV (Promega), an expression vector containing theRenilla luciferase gene under control of a CMV promoter, was included in each experiment to correct for transfection efficiency (see below). Empty expression vector was used to normalize the DNA amount. The cultures were harvested for luciferase activities 48 h after transfection. Fifty microliters of cell extract (100 μl) was assayed for luciferase activity for 3 s in a Biocounter M1500 luminometer (Lumac, Netherlands) using the Dual Luciferase assay system (Promega), where firefly luciferase activity is normalized forRenilla luciferase activity to control for variations in transfection efficiency according to the manufacturer's procedures. Total RNA was isolated from the indicated murine tissues or cell types using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The presence of NFATc1, -c2, -c3, or -c4 mRNA in adult C57BL/6 murine ventriculocytes was analyzed by RT-PCR using primers specific for the individual NFAT isoforms as described before (21Ranger A.M. Gerstenfeld L.C. Wang J. Kon T. Bae H. Gravallese E.M. Glimcher M.J. Glimcher L.H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 9-22Google Scholar). Northern blot hybridizations on size-fractionated total RNA (10 μg) from indicated tissues were performed as described previously (22De Windt L.J. Willemsen P.H. Popping S. Van der Vusse G.J. Reneman R.S. Van Bilsen M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2095-2106Google Scholar). To obtain probes specific for the NFAT isoforms, the mRNA sequences of murine NFATc1 through c4 were aligned (using ClustalW software) and primers designed for the 3′-untranslated regions showing no or minimal overlap (primers: NFATc1 fw, 5′-GATGCTGAACCTGAGACGCC and rv, 5′-GCCACCAGCCAGTCTGGTGT; NFATc2 fw, 5′-ATTGCTATCTTAGTAAAATCAAGG and rv, 5′-TAATCTGAAAGCAAGA; NFATc3 fw, 5′-GGTGATGAGAGACACTCCTCTCCC and rv, 5′-ATCATATAAAAGTACCTA; NFATc4 fw, 5′-CCGCACAGCCTCACTGATGT and rv 5′-GCCACCGCTCCTTCCTCC). The isoform-specific probes were randomly labeled with [32P]dCTP (E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. NV, Brussels, Belgium), added to the blots and incubated in Rapid Hyb hybridization solution (Amersham Biosciences) at 58 °C. Stringent post-hybridization wash conditions were used. Filters were exposed to phosphorimaging screens (Bio-Rad) and analyzed using Quantity 1 (Bio-Rad) and Adobe Photoshop 6.0 software. The intensity of the18 S ribosomal RNA band detected with a radiolabeled 18 S probe was used as a quantitative control. The method used is a minor modification of a recently described protocol (23Lim H.W. De Windt L.J. Steinberg L. Taigen T. Witt S.A. Kimball T.R. Molkentin J.D. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2431-2437Google Scholar, 24De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Haq S. Force T. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13571-13579Google Scholar). In brief, protein extracts were lysed in ice-cold buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 2 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor). Protein concentration in lysates was determined using a protein dye assay (Bio-Rad) followed by separation on gradient gels (Bio-Rad), and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Filters were blocked for 1 h at room temperature using 10% nonfat dry milk dissolved in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton-X-100 (Sigma), TBST. Primary antibodies included rabbit polyclonal anti-NFATc1 (Santa Cruz, H-110), mouse monoclonal anti-NFATc2 (Santa Cruz, 4G6-G5), rabbit polyclonal anti-NFATc3 (Santa Cruz, M75), rabbit polyclonal anti-NFATc4 (Santa Cruz, H-74), and mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma, F-3165). Anti-NFATc1–c3 were diluted 1:200, and anti-NFATc4 was diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk dissolved in TBST). Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibodies included swine anti-rabbit peroxidase or rabbit anti-mouse peroxidase (DOKA, Denmark) and were used at a dilution of 1:2000 in blocking buffer and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Signals were detected with an Enhanced Chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed using Adobe Photoshop 6.0 software. The adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase with a nuclear localization signal (Adβgal) was a generous gift from Mark Sussman (Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, OH). The adenovirus expressing an activated mutant of calcineurin (AdCnA) was described and characterized previously (11De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Taigen T. Wencker D. Condorelli G. Dorn 2nd, G.W. Kitsis R.N. Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 255-263Google Scholar, 24De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Haq S. Force T. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13571-13579Google Scholar). AdNFATc4(PXIXIT) and AdNFATc4(Ala mut), replication-deficient adenoviruses expressing either FLAG-tagged NFATc4(PXIXIT) or NFATc4(Ala mut), were generated by subcloning PCR-amplified fragments (fw, 5′-CCAGAAGTAGTGAAGC; rv, 5′-ATGATCATTACTTATCTA and fw, 5′-AGCGGCAGCCAACATG; rv, 5′-GCATTTAGGTGACACTAT, respectively) as XbaI fragments into the adenoviral shuttle vector pACCMVplpA, using either pECE-NFATc4(PXIXIT) or pCDNA-NFAT3(Ala mut) as templates. The recombinant shuttle vectors were cotransfected with pJM17 in HEK 293 cells to produce initial recombinant adenovirus lysates. Procedures for plaque purification, expansion, and titering the replication-deficient adenovirus and infection of cardiomyocytes were performed as described previously (11De Windt L.J. Lim H.W.

Chem. 2000; 275: 13571-13579Google Scholar). Cardiomyocytes were infected with indicated adenoviruses at an m.o.i. 100 for 2 h and cultured in serum-deficient medium with or without of Endo-1 (100 nm; Sigma) or CT-1 (1 nm) present. Fixed cultured cardiomyocytes underwent immunocytochemistry as previously described in detail (11De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Taigen T. Wencker D. Condorelli G. Dorn 2nd, G.W. Kitsis R.N. Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 255-263Google Scholar, 20Taigen T. De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Molkentin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1196-1201Google Scholar, 24De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Haq S. Force T. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13571-13579Google Scholar). To visualize the subcellular localization of NFATc1, -c2, and -c3, primary, isoform-specific antibodies (see Western blots) were used at a dilution of 1:400 followed by corresponding anti-mouse or anti-rabbit Oregon green-labeled secondary antibody incubation (Molecular Probes) at a dilution of 1:400. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline/0.1% Nonidet P-40, including bisbenzimide (Sigma) to visualize nuclei. For visualization of cardiomyocyte size, sarcomeric organization, and perinuclear ANF expression, the primary antibody included polyclonal anti-rat ANF (Peninsula laboratories), followed by secondary anti-rabbit Oregon green (Molecular Probes)-conjugated antibody and a phalloidin Texas Red-conjugated antibody (Molecular Probes), all used at a dilution of 1:400. An epifluorescence microscope (Eclipse E800, Nikon) was used to visualize the cells at a 400× magnification. Quantitation of cardiomyocyte cell surface area was performed on digitized images using NIH Image software. At least 50 cardiomyocytes in 10–20 fields were examined in three independent experiments. The results are presented as mean values ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using InStat 3.0 software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) and analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's post-test when appropriate. RT-PCR analysis was employed to investigate which members of the NFAT transcription factor family are present in ventricular cardiomyocytes, and hence, might function as calcineurin effectors. Using RNA from adult mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes, transcripts of the expected size for NFATc2, -c3, and -c4 were easily detected following a limited number of amplifications (Fig. 1A). NFATc1 was also detectable albeit at lower levels than the other isoforms (Fig. 1A, top left panel, lane 2). As a control for RT quality, a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase RT-PCR was performed, which resulted in robust product in RT material (data not shown). These data suggest that transcripts of all NFAT isoforms are present in the ventricular muscle cell lineage. To extend these results, Northern blot analyses for the different NFAT isoforms were performed on RNA isolated from several murine muscle types, including the individual cardiac chambers (right and left ventricle and atria), three skeletal muscle types (diaphragm, quadriceps, and gastrocnemius), and visceral smooth muscle (stomach) using NFAT isoform-specific probes. The NFATc4-specific probe yielded the most intense signal in both cardiac chambers, displaying two prominent transcripts, one of 6.0 and one of about 4.5 kb, with the latter giving the most intense signal. The same two transcripts were present throughout all muscle types, albeit at lower levels (Fig. 1B, lower panel). NFATc3 gave two transcript sizes, with a smaller one of about 4.8 kb being the most intense in all muscle types, but most prominently expressed in the cardiac ventricular chambers. Two transcripts for NFATc2 were also detected, which were each expressed at comparable levels in all tissues tested. NFATc1 showed three different transcripts, with the smallest transcript (2.0 kb) being expressed in the left ventricle and the two larger transcripts being expressed at roughly equivalent levels in most other tissues analyzed (Fig. 1B, upper panel). All blots were probed for 18 S to verify quality and equal loading of RNA (data not shown). Collectively, these data indicate that transcripts for all four calcineurin-regulated NFAT factors are present in cardiomyocytes, with those for NFATc3 and NFATc4 being present at the highest levels. To verify whether these transcripts were also efficiently translated into their respective protein products, a series of Western blots were performed on total protein lysate from cultured neonatal rat ventriculocytes using isoform-specific antibodies. Tissue extracts of rat brain and rat thymus (data not shown) served as positive controls. Fig. 1C demonstrates that signals for all four calcineurin-regulated NFAT factors were obtained in cardiomyocytes, albeit at differing intensity, and with products ranging in mass from 70 to 200 kDa. For NFATc1 and NFATc2, discrete protein signals were observed, whereas for NFATc3 and NFATc4 multiple bands in the range of 100 to 200 kDa were observed. This may reflect generation of proteins by alternatively spliced transcripts (see Fig. 1B) and/or by differential phosphorylation states of the NFATc3 and NFATc4 proteins. Although the different affinities of the separate antibodies used do not allow for direct comparison of signal intensity, it is interesting to note that the relatively higher intensity of the protein signals for NFATc3 (Fig. 1C) correlates with its relatively high signal in the Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1B). Conclusively, RT-PCR, Northern blot, and Western blot analyses all point toward the existence of all four calcineurin-regulated NFAT isoforms in the ventricular cardiomyocyte. NFAT transcription factors are dephosphorylated upon activation of the Ca2+/CaM-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, resulting in unmasking of their nuclear localization signals permitting nuclear import. To verify that NFATc isoforms could be activated by calcineurin in cardiac myocytes, we performed immunocytochemistry for each NFAT factor at baseline or after infection with an adenovirus expressing a constitutively activated form of calcineurin (AdCnA) or after stimulation with Endo-1. Cardiomyocytes were 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained to visualize the nuclei and facilitate observation of nuclear localization (Fig. 2, B, D,F, and H, left and right panels). NFATc1, -c2, and -c3 were easily detectable using their respective antibodies and displayed a predominant cytosolic localization in unstimulated cardiomyocytes (Fig. 2A,left and right panels, NFATc1 and -c3, and data not shown for NFATc2). AdCnA infection resulted in nuclear accumulation of each NFAT isoform in nearly 100% of the myocytes evaluated. Stimulation with the agonist Endo-1 for 12 h resulted in efficient NFATc1 and c3 nuclear translocation in about 70% of cardiomyocytes (Fig. 2E, left and right panels). Similar findings were obtained for NFATc2 (data not shown). To control for the specificity of the antibodies used, the primary isoform-specific antibody was omitted, which resulted in background fluorescence (Fig. 2G, left andright panels). All cells examined were also positive for sarcomeric actin using phalloidin staining, thereby confirming their identity as cardiomyocytes (data not shown). These results indicate that NFATc1, -c2, and -c3 are equally sensitive to endogenous calcineurin activation as demonstrated previously for NFATc4 (10Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Google Scholar) and point toward a potential contribution for all NFAT members in calcineurin signaling in the ventricular cardiomyocyte. To explore whether the calcineurin-mediated, nuclear import of the cardiac NFAT isoforms was associated with their ability to participate in transcriptional activity of cardiac-specific, calcineurin-responsive promoters, a series of transient cotransfection assays were carried out. Recently, a novel gene was characterized that is present at low levels under physiological conditions in the heart but undergoes dramatic up-regulation following calcineurin activation in the heart (15Rothermel B.A. McKinsey T.A. Vega R.B. Nicol R.L. Mammen P. Yang J. Antos C.L. Shelton J.M. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Williams R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3328-3333Google Scholar, 18Yang J. Rothermel B.

STC acts locally in kidney and gut to modulate calcium and phosphate excretion, and its overexpression in mice results in high serum phosphate, dwarfism, and increased metabolic rate. STC has also been linked to cancer, pregnancy, lactation, angiogenesis, organogenesis, cerebral ischemia, and hypertonic stress. In this report we have characterized the STC receptor and the functional targeting of ligand and receptor to mitochondria. For receptor binding analysis, a stanniocalcin-alkaline phosphatase fusion protein was engineered. Subsequent binding assays using the fusion protein indicated that kidney and liver contained the highest number of binding sites with affinities of 0.8 and 0.25 nm, respectively. Intriguingly, purified mitochondria from both tissues yielded similar high affinity binding sites. Fractionation analysis revealed that the majority of binding sites were localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane. In further studies, we characterized the time course of STC-alkaline phosphatase fusion protein sequestration by intact mitochondria. In situligand binding also revealed discrete, displaceable binding to plasma membranes and mitochondria of nephron cells and liver hepatocytes. The existence of mitochondrial receptors prompted a similar search for the ligand. Immunogold electron microscopy revealed that STC was preferentially concentrated in the mitochondria of all nephron segments targeted by STC. Subcellular fractionation revealed that >90% of cellular STC immunoreactivity was mitochondrial, confined to the inner matrix, and similar in size to recombinant STC (50 kDa). In functional studies, recombinant STC had concentration-dependent stimulatory effects on electron transfer by sub-mitochondrial particles.

Finally, STC overexpression in mice leads to high serum phosphate, dwarfism, and increased metabolic rate (22Varghese R. Gagliardi A.D. Bialek P.E. Yee S.P. Wagner G.F. Dimattia G.E.

Gerritsen M.E. French D.M. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3681-3690Google Scholar). Despite this growing body of knowledge, little is known of STC signaling or STC receptors. In this report we have characterized mammalian STC receptors and described a novel mitochondrial-targeting pathway for both ligand and receptor. An STC-alkaline phosphatase fusion protein was generated essentially as previously described (23Flanagan J.G. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein-coding region of the mouse STC cDNA was amplified by PCR to add restriction sites (NheI andBglII) and then ligated in-frame, upstream of the human placental alkaline phosphatase gene in the commercially available APtag vector (Genhunter) (Fig. 1 A). After bacterial amplification, the vector was purified and sequenced to confirm the desired open reading frame. The STC-AP expression vector was stably transfected into Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells using ExGen 500 (Fermentas) and selected in 250 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). As a control, the vector without insert (AP) was also stably transfected into MDCK cells as described above to generate secreted alkaline phosphatase. Media was harvested and concentrated before quantitating the alkaline phosphatase activity from STC-AP and AP-expressing cells as previously described (23Flanagan J.G. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Google Scholar). The STC content of STC-AP fusion protein media was quantified using a well characterized STC radioimmunoassay (24De Niu P. Radman D.P. Jaworski E.M. Deol H. Gentz R. Su J. Olsen H.S. Wagner G.F. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 162: 131-144Google Scholar). Receptor binding assays were conducted on isolated nuclear, mitochondrial, and plasma membrane fractions from liver and kidney to obtain relative estimates of specific binding. Cell fractionation was performed as described (25Graham J.M. Higgins J.A. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1993: 19Google Scholar). Briefly, tissues were minced with a razor blade and then Dounce-homogenized in 5 volumes of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 0.25 m sucrose and 5 mm EDTA. The homogenate was then centrifuged twice at 1,000 × g for 15 min, once at 15,000 × g for 30 min, and finally at 100,000 × g for 90 min, thereby isolating crude nuclear, mitochondrial, and plasma membrane fractions, respectively. Subcellular fractions were resuspended in 50 mm HEPES, quantified for total protein, and stored at −70 °C until use. High purity mitochondrial fractions were obtained by Percoll gradient centrifugation (26Reinhart P.H. Taylor W.M. Bygrave F.L. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 731-735Google Scholar). The relative purity of each subcellular fraction was determined using 5′-nucleotidase, acid phosphatase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and succinate dehydrogenase assays as representative markers of plasma membranes, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria as previously described (27Morré J.D. Jakoby W.B. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, Inc., New York1971: 648Google Scholar). For binding assays, 200-μg aliquots of each subcellular fraction were incubated with 0.5 nm STC-AP, STC-AP plus 1 μg/ml purified STC, or the equivalent amount of secreted AP activity in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5 (HBHA), for 90 min at room temperature. To separate bound and free ligand, tubes were centrifuged for 3 min at 10,000 ×g to pellet the protein followed by two 1-ml washes of ice-cold HBHA. Washed pellets were solubilized in 200 μl of 1% Triton X-100 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for subsequent detection of AP activity (28Flanagan J.G. Cheng H.J. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 198-210Google Scholar). The correlation between binding activity and protein concentration was established by adding 0.5 nm STC-AP to increasing amounts of purified liver membrane protein (100–500 μg). Membranes were incubated and washed, and AP activity was determined as described above. The pH dependence of binding was determined on 200-μg aliquots of membrane protein suspended in 50 mm acetate, HEPES, or Tris-based buffers to achieve pH ranges of 3–5, 6–7, and 8–10, respectively. To further establish the specificity of STC-AP binding, highly purified NIH hormone preparations were tested for their abilities to displace STC-AP binding. Binding of STC-AP was measured in the presence of each hormone (30 μg/ml). Saturation binding assays were performed essentially as described above with increasing amounts of STC-AP, AP alone, or STC-AP + 1 μm purified recombinant human STC (hSTC) to obtain estimates of K d and B max. Additions were made to fixed amounts of membrane or mitochondrial protein (200–400 μg), and all samples were processed as above. To more precisely localize the sites of STC binding, we compared equal numbers of whole rat liver mitochondria and mitoplasts for receptor binding activity. Mitoplasts were prepared with 1% digitonin as described. To determine whether STC-AP was capable of being sequestered by intact mitochondria, we performed time course incubations of STC-AP (0.2 nm for 5, 15, 30, and 60 min) to 100-μg aliquots of freshly isolated mitochondria. After binding, proteinase K digestion (5 units/ml for 5 min on ice) was employed to destroy all externally bound ligand before the measurement of internalized STC-AP. Total, bound STC-AP activity was also quantified in undigested mitochondria as controls. To localize STC binding sites at the histological level, in situ ligand binding was performed as previously described (23Flanagan J.G. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Google Scholar), with the exception that paraffin-embedded sections were used instead of cryosections as the latter yielded only weak binding activity when tested. Paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were de-waxed, rehydrated, and equilibrated in HBHA before incubation with 0.5 nm STC-AP, AP, or STC-AP plus 1 μm hSTC in HBHA for 90 min at room temperature. Thereafter, the tissue sections were washed in HBHA with 0.1% Tween and fixed for 30 s in 60% acetone, 3% formaldehyde in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Endogenous AP activity was inactivated by a 60-min incubation in HBHA at 65 °C. Color development of ligand-associated AP activity was then initiated at room temperature by the addition of AP detection buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2 0.33 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium, and 0.17 mg/ml BCIP). Finally, slides were washed in ultrapure water to stop the reaction and mounted. To localize STC at the subcellular level, rat liver, and kidney were Dounce-homogenized and fractionated according to Graham and Higgins (25Graham J.M. Higgins J.A. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1993: 19Google Scholar) to yield nuclear (1,000 × g), light mitochondrial (10,000 ×g), heavy mitochondrial (17,000 × g), and plasma membrane fractions (100,000 × g). The supernatant from the 100,000 × g spin was also saved to represent the cytosol. Serial dilutions of each fraction (200–800 μg) were then assessed for STC content by RIA. The data were expressed as ng of STC/mg of protein. To more precisely localize STC within mitochondria, isolated liver mitochondria were subjected to either proteinase K and digitonin treatments. To determine whether STC was attached to the outer membrane, 200-μg aliquots of mitochondria were re-suspended in buffer (0.22 m mannitol, 0.07 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA) with or without 5 units/ml proteinase K and incubated for 10 min on ice. Digested mitochondria were then washed twice to remove residual proteinase K, dissolved in 0.1% Triton X-100, and assayed by RIA (24De Niu P. Radman D.P. Jaworski E.M. Deol H. Gentz R. Su J. Olsen H.S. Wagner G.F. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 162: 131-144Google Scholar) or Western blot. To test for the presence of STC in the inner mitochondrial matrix, mitoplasts (digitonin-treated mitochondria devoid of the outer membrane or intermembrane space) were generated by incubating intact mitochondria with 1% digitonin in the above buffer for 20 min on ice (29Clausmeyer S. Sturzebecher R. Peters J. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 337-344Google Scholar). Mitoplasts were then pelleted, dissolved in 0.1% Triton X-100, and assayed by RIA or Western blot. Controls in this case consisted of incubating equivalent amounts of mitochondria in buffer alone over the same time period. To localize STC at the subcellular level, mouse kidneys were fixed in a mixture of 2% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 3 h and then embedded in Lowicryl K4M. Thin tissue sections were preincubated in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.4 (phosphate buffer) containing 0.1% skimmed milk powder and 50 mmglycine. The sections were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a 1:100 dilution of rabbit anti-hSTC in phosphate buffer containing 1% normal goat serum. Sites of primary antibody binding were then visualized with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 10-nm colloidal gold particles (Sigma) diluted 1:50 in phosphate buffer. Sections were stained with uranyl acetate before examination by electron microscopy. To determine the possible effects of STC on mitochondrial respiratory chain activity, biologically active recombinant hSTC (20Zhang J. Alfonso P. Thotakura N.R. Su J. Buergin M. Parmelee D. Collins A.W. Oelkuct M. Gaffney S. Gentz S. Radman D.P. Wagner G.F. Gentz R. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 390-398Google Scholar) was used in combination with a Mitoscan kit according to the manufacturer's directions (Harvard Bioscience, Inc. Madison, WI). The kit utilizes bovine heart sub-mitochondrial particles to assess electron transfer rate based on the disappearance of NADH. For the assay, hSTC (0.5–1000 nm) or a control buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) was preincubated with sub-mitochondrial particles for 5 min. The disappearance of NADH in each treatment group was then monitored at 340 nm over the next 15 min to establish NADH consumption rates. Three independent rate determinations were conducted for each concentration of STC. Saturation binding curves were analyzed using a nonlinear regression analysis of one-site binding in GraphPad Prism where Y = B max ×X/(K d + X). For comparison of binding between isolated mitochondria and mitoplasts, a student'st test was used (α = 0.01). The time course of STC sequestration into intact mitochondria was assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnet's test using the first time point as the control where α = 0.05. Because radioiodination consistently failed to produce a functional STC tracer for receptor binding assays, we generated a fusion protein (STC-AP) encompassing the entire protein-coding region of the mouse STC cDNA with alkaline phosphatase fused to the C terminus (Fig. 1 A). Western blot analysis with STC antiserum revealed that STC-AP was a 210-kDa protein under nonreducing conditions and 120-kDa after reduction with β-mercaptoethanol, suggesting that the STC-AP formed dimers like native STC (Fig. 1 B). Identical blots probed with an antibody to placental alkaline phosphatase also revealed the presence of both STC-AP and AP (Fig. 1 C). Conditioned media from STC-AP-expressing cells also exhibited parallelism in the RIA, indicating that the fusion protein was immunologically indistinguishable from purified hSTC (data not shown). We assessed the activity of the AP enzymatic tag and estimated the STC content of conditioned media from STC-AP- and AP-producing cells after concentrating the media using Centriprep devices (Millipore). The specific activity of STC-AP was estimated as 4 milliunits of alkaline phosphatase activity ≅ 1 ng of STC (1 unit represents the hydrolysis of 1 mmol of p-nitrophenyl phosphate/min at 37 °C). Analysis of binding in fractionated kidney and liver tissue revealed some binding in all fractions but highest binding in the 15,000 × g (crude mitochondrial fraction) and 100,000 × g (plasma membranes) fractions (Fig.2). Nonspecific binding was essentially the same using either AP alone or STC-AP plus 1 μm hSTC. Using isolated liver plasma membranes, we determined that binding was linear with protein concentration and highly pH-dependent such that binding was reduced outside the physiological range (Fig.3). Displacement assays using a variety of bioactive NIH hormones and STC-2 demonstrated the specificity of STC-AP binding, because only hSTC was capable of causing significant displacement (not shown).Figure 3Binding of STC-AP fusion protein is pH-dependent and linear with protein concentration. A, isolated rat liver membranes were incubated with 0.5 nm STC-AP or the equivalent amount of AP activity using acetate (pH 4–6), HEPES (pH 7–8), and Tris (pH 9–10) buffers. Bound AP activity was quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, increasing amounts of rat liver membrane were incubated with fusion protein to establish binding linearity. Graphs are representative of three independent experiments.ABS, absorbance.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Purified kidney and liver membranes were analyzed further in saturation binding assays, yielding high affinity, high capacity binding sites in both (Fig. 4, A andB). An estimated K d of 0.8 ± 0.3 nm and B max of 1.2 ± 0.6 pmol/mg of protein was obtained for kidney membranes, and aK d of 0.25 ± 0.1 nm andB max of 1.8 ± 0.5 pmol/mg of protein was determined for liver membranes (saturation curves are representative of 6 independent determinations). Because we observed relatively high levels of specific binding to the 15,000 × g, mitochondria-rich fraction in liver and kidney, we explored the possibility of STC receptors on mitochondria in greater detail using purified mitochondrial preparations from rat liver and kidney. Saturation binding analysis of purified mitochondria from rat liver and kidney revealed similar binding kinetics to those obtained with membranes (Fig. 4, C and D, kidney mitochondria had a K d of 0.56 nm andB max of 0.99 pmol/mg of protein, and liver mitochondria yielded a K d of 0.44 nm andB max of 1.1 pmol/mg of protein. Enzyme analysis revealed that these mitochondria were enriched for succinate dehydrogenase and had minimal contamination by other organelles as compared with a crude homogenate (Fig.5). To identify mitochondrial compartments containing the majority of STC receptors, we performed a comparative binding analysis on equal numbers of whole mitochondria and mitoplasts (digitonin-treated mitochondria). Surprisingly, mitoplasts contained twice the number of binding sites as mitochondria (Fig. 6), suggesting that the majority of STC receptors were confined to mitoplast membranes. Because of the marked differences between mitoplast and mitochondrial binding, we explored the possibility of in vitro ligand sequestration by performing a time course study of STC-AP binding to whole mitochondria followed by proteinase K treatment to destroy non-internalized ligand. The results demonstrated that there was progressive protection of the ligand from the enzyme over time (Fig7), suggesting that the native ligand likely undergoes the same process in vivo. In support of the receptor binding data, in situ ligand binding studies with STC-AP revealed discrete, displaceable binding to cells in specific nephron segments. Fig.8 is a sagittal view of outer medullary kidney in adult mouse after in situ ligand binding with STC-AP. The dark brown staining over the cytoplasm of all thick ascending limb cells (asterisks) is representative of specific ligand binding. Specific binding was also observed over collecting duct (CD) cells. This was more apparent at higher magnifications, as shown in Fig. 8 B, which is a transverse section of outer medullary kidney of another animal. The specific binding to CD and thick limb cells contrasted sharply with the complete absence of binding to the thin loops of Henle (arrows) and vascular bundles (VB) comprising the vasa recta capillaries. An entirely different pattern of binding was evident in cells comprising the cortical CDs and distal convoluted tubules. Fig.8 C is a view of mouse cortical kidney. The binding of STC-AP to these segments was punctate in appearance and more intense than the binding to medullary CDs or thick limb cells, as evidenced by the darker hue of the reaction product. In these segments, binding was almost entirely restricted to cytoplasmic inclusions that were rod-shaped in appearance and ∼3–5 μm in length, highly reminiscent of mitochondria. For comparison with kidney, in situ ligand binding studies were also carried out on tissue sections of human and mouse liver (Fig. 8, D and E). Here the pattern of binding was the same as that observed in the distal convoluted tubules; hepatocytes demonstrated a high density of punctate, cytoplasmic staining to rod-shaped structures. Binding was also evident on liver cell membranes, particularly in the vicinity of central veins. It is perhaps noteworthy that not all hepatocytes exhibited binding activity. In control tissue sections, all of the aforementioned ligand binding was displaced by co-incubation of the fusion protein with excess (1 μm) recombinant hSTC (Fig. 8, B(inset) and F). Furthermore, as in displacement assays, the addition of 1 μm STC-related protein (STCrP or STC2) did not displace fusion protein binding. In view of the presence of STC receptors on mitochondria, we also attempted to localize the STC ligand at the subcellular level using a number of methods. The first entailed a crude subcellular fractionation of kidney and liver tissue followed by RIA quantification of STC in each fraction. This procedure revealed that >90% of the STC was confined to the 10,000 and 15,000 × g fractions that are largely comprised of heavy and light mitochondria, respectively. The remaining immunoreactivity (<5%) was confined to the 100,000 × g supernatant representing the cytoplasm (TableI). This was also confirmed by Western blot analysis of isolated mitochondrial fractions from liver and kidney. In both instances a single 50-kDa band, approximately the same size as recombinant hSTC, was observed. Pre-absorbing the antiserum with 1 μg/ml hSTC eliminated the immuno-detection of this band (not shown).Table ISubcellular distribution of STC in major organs (ng/mg of total protein)700 × gnuclear10,000 × g heavy mitochondria17,000 ×g light mitochondria100,000 × gmembrane100,000 × g cytosol% STC in combined mitochondrial fractionsKidneyND18.715.21.11.493LiverND1815.3ND0.7898SpleenND16.310ND1.894LungND18.1111.50.992Tissues were extracted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Equal amounts of protein (0.4–1.0 mg/tube) were then analyzed by RIA.

Spleen and lung are included for comparison. ND, not detectable below RIA detection limit of 0.2 ng/ml. To further confirm the cell fractionation studies above, immunogold electron microscopy was performed on adult mouse kidney using STC antiserum. By this procedure, large numbers of colloidal gold particles were preferentially localized over the mitochondria of proximal straight tubules (Fig. 9 A), thick ascending limbs (Fig. 9 B), distal convoluted tubule (Fig. 9 C), and CD cells (Fig. 9 D). Colloidal gold staining of the nephron cell cytoplasm was also observed but not nearly to the same extent. All gold labeling was completely abolished in control tissue section by pre-absorbing the antiserum with excess hSTC (Fig. 9 A, inset), indicating that the procedure was specific for STC. To pinpoint more precisely the location of mitochondrial STC, the STC content of isolated mitochondria was assessed after treatment with either proteinase K or digitonin. The results showed that proteinase K digestion did not significantly alter the levels of immuno-assayable STC as compared with untreated controls (0.59 ng/mg of protein after digestion as compared with 0.54 ng/mg in controls). This suggested that the majority of STC was inside the mitochondria as opposed to being bound to the outer membrane. However, when 1% digitonin was employed to remove the outer mitochondrial membrane and the intermembrane proteins, the immunoassayable STC content of the remaining mitoplasts remained unchanged as compared with controls (0.61 ng/mg of protein after digitonin as compared with 0.55 ng/mg in untreated controls). This indicated that the majority of STC was confined to the mitoplast. In comparison, control mitochondria that were lysed before proteinase K treatment had STC levels that were below RIA detection limits (<0.2 ng/ml), indicating the effectiveness of proteinase K digestion. The efficacy of digitonin treatment was also assured by Wester"

However, in membrane vesicles prepared from transfected cells, all mutants were still functional. In addition, FRET was readily detected during maturation of wild type rGAT, when the bulk of the protein resided in the endoplasmic reticulum.

In the former, binding of substrate induces an ion influx in excess, and in the latter, ions and substrates are translocated with a fixed stoichiometry. Regardless of which model is correct, it is attractive to speculate that the functional transporter unit contains more than one current membrane permeation pathway that allows for concomitant but segregated translocation of substrate and ions (12Sonders M.S. Amara S.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 294-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 13DeFelice L.J. Blakely R.D. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 579-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A survey of channel structures indicates that oligomers are frequently encountered (20Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2002; 415: 276-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), regardless of whether the channels contain a single pore (e.g. K+ channels and ligand-gated ion channels) or multiple pores (Cl− channels and aquaporins).We have therefore searched for mutations that abolish oligomer formation in the rat GABA transporter GAT-1 (rGAT). The rGAT contains a perfect leucine heptad repeat in its second transmembrane helix (TM2); 4 leucine residues (Leu83–Leu104) are separated by 6 intervening amino acids. This leucine heptad repeat conforms to the arrangement found in canonical leucine zippers. Thus, by analogy with transcription factors (21O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Stafford III, W.F. Kim P.S. Science. 1989; 245: 646-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), soluble proteins (22Bartkiewicz M. Houghton A. Baron R. J. Biol.

Cell. 1996; 87: 33-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), TM2 in individual rGAT molecules may drive dimerization by adopting a leucine zipper-like conformation.Our experiments show that substituting leucine residues by alanine abrogates intermolecular FRET most likely by interruption of oligomer formation in rGAT1. One of those mutants, namely L97A, still binds and transports substrate in a manner indistinguishable from the wild type. Mutations that replace more than one leucine result in intracellular retention of transporters that are still capable of translocating substrate across the bilayer. These data indicate that assembly of rGAT into a stable oligomeric complex is required for export of rGAT1 from the endoplasmic reticulum.DISCUSSIONThe mechanisms that support oligomer formation of membrane proteins are still poorly understood, because the forces that stabilize protein-protein interfaces in a hydrophobic milieu differ from those operating in aqueous solution. In the present study, we have focused on the leucine heptad repeat TM2 of the rat GABA transporter-1 and employed three independent techniques of FRET microscopy to investigate its contribution in supporting oligomer formation. Our approach has the advantage that it allows the visualization of protein-protein interactions in the native environment, i.e.in the membrane of a living cell. Based on all data sets (ratio imaging, donor photobleaching, and donor recovery after acceptor photobleaching), we conclude that the propensity to form oligomeric complexes is considerably impaired upon substitution of a single leucine residue in TM2 (Leu97 by alanine) and completely abrogated by removal of additional leucine side chains. We cannot rule out an overall change in the conformation that would move the amino-terminally attached fluorescent tags in an otherwise intact oligomer beyond the Förster distance (∼50 Å). However, the fact that bidirectional transport of substrate, binding of inhibitors, and regulation by protein kinase C was not affected in the mutants (cf. Figs. 3, 4, and 8) argues against a global conformational change of this magnitude. The observations are more likely accounted for by a loss in the physical interaction of neighboring amino termini of YFP- and CFP-tagged rGAT-L97A, because their ability to form oligomers is impaired. However, our results obviously do not rule out that the oligomer may be stabilized by interaction of helices other than TM2; in fact, it has been shown that cysteines on top of TM6 can support intermolecular cross-links in the human dopamine transporter (10Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Finally, the possibility has to be considered that the effect of the leucine residues is indirect; they may be required for packing of the helices in the hydrophobic core of an individual transporter and thereby indirectly stabilize the interface that supports oligomer formation.Apart from the current observations, the following three lines of evidence support the assumption that leucine heptad repeats may mediate homophilic interactions of proteins within the membrane: (i) studies of the small protein phospholamban which contains a single transmembrane span (36Arkin I.T. Adams P.D. MacKenzie K.R. Lemmon M.A. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4757-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 37Cornea R.L. Autry J.M. Chen Z. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41487-41494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); (ii) experiments studying the homophilic interactions of single artificial transmembrane segments (38Gurezka R. Laage R. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9265-9270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 39Choma C. Gratkowski H. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 40Zhou F.X. Merianos H.J. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar); and (iii) a related approach in which the amphipathic segment comprising the leucine zipper of the transcription factor GCN4 was converted into a hydrophobic helix (41Zhou F.X. Cocco M.J. Russ W.P. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). There are, however, several arguments that cast doubt on a role of simplistic extension of the leucine zipper model to membrane proteins, in particular those containing multiple transmembrane domains. First, voltage-sensitive Shaker K+ channels, for instance, are assembled from identical or related subunits that contain a conserved leucine heptad repeat within their S4–S5 region; these leucine residues, however, are not involved in subunit assembly (28McCormack K. Tanouye M.A. Iverson L.E. Lin J.W. Ramaswami M. McCormack T. Campanelli J.T. Mathew M.K. Rudy B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2931-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Similar results have been found for L-type calcium channels, where the heptad motif is thought to play a fundamental role in channel activation rather than helix packing (29Garcia J. Nakai J. Imoto K. Beam K.G. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2515-2523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Second, it is difficult to envisage the driving force that would stabilize a leucine zipper in a membrane protein; in aqueous medium helices that contain leucine heptad repeats form a “zipper” because this conformation shields the bulky hydrophobic residue from the aqueous medium. This need to minimize the solvent-exposed surface obviously does not arise in the lipid environment of the membrane. In fact, polyleucine stretches haveper se little propensity to support helix-helix interactions in a hydrophobic environment (41Zhou F.X. Cocco M.J. Russ W.P. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The association (as dimers and trimers) is greatly enhanced by hydrogen-bonding donors such as asparagine (39Choma C. Gratkowski H. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 41Zhou F.X. Cocco M.J. Russ W.P. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) or aspartate and glutamate (40Zhou F.X. Merianos H.J. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) in the position “a” of a heptad repeat “dnefgabcdn+1,” where the positions “dn” and “dn+1” are held by leucines (or isoleucines), i.e. in the helix the hydrophilic residue is sandwiched between two hydrophobic side chains. In this context, it is worth pointing out that a glutamate residue is found in TM2 of all members of Na+-dependent (monoamine) neurotransmitter transporters. This invariant glutamate (Glu101 in rGAT) is found at the a position between two leucine residues (Leu97 and Leu104 in rGAT, see Fig. 1). It is also worth noting that the constitutive activity of the neu oncogene results from a point mutation, which replaces Val664 of the Her/erbB2 receptor by glutamate. This substitution results in constitutive (i.e.ligand-independent) oligomerization and hence persistent signaling (42Weiner D.B. Liu J. Cohen J.A. Williams W.V. Greene M.I. Nature. 1989; 339: 230-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 43Bargmann C.I. Weinberg R.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2043-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar).Based on these arguments, we propose that the leucine heptad repeat and the invariant glutamate in TM2 are important components of the oligomeric interface of rGAT1. The role of Glu101 in rat Gat1 is currently being explored. Importantly, we stress, however, that our data do not allow us to draw any conclusions about the structure of the leucine heptad repeat nor about the stoichiometry of transporters in the oligomeric complex. For appropriate synthetic artificial leucine heptad repeats can exist as dimers and trimers (39Choma C. Gratkowski H. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In phospholamban, the leucine heptad repeat in the single transmembrane span supports pentamer formation. Obviously, in rGAT (and related transporters) the 12 transmembrane helices impose a space constraint; hence, the number of monomers that can be recruited into a complex via homophilic association of TM2 is limited. Nevertheless, trimeric complexes can, for instance, readily be envisaged. In addition, as mentioned earlier, there may be additional contact sites that stabilize the oligomer (10Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).Our data point to a role of the leucine heptad repeat in supporting the delivery of the transporter from the endoplasmic to the plasma membrane. A role for oligomerization in this process can be inferred from earlier domain swapping experiments in the glucose transporters 1 and 4 (44Asano T. Takata K. Katagiri H. Tsukuda K. Lin J.L. Ishihara H. Inukai K. Hirano H. Yazaki Y. Oka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19636-19641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this interpretation is supported by the following observations. Oligomer formation can be observed in the very early stage of rGAT synthesis and maturation. Replacing leucine residues in TM2 interferes with oligomer formation and results in the intracellular retention of (otherwise transport competent) rGAT mutants. These findings suggest that the assembly into a higher ordered complex is indeed important for the export from the ER. However, whereas oligomer formation is necessary, it is clearly not sufficient; resonance energy transfer was similar in magnitude in the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant rGATΔC and in wild type rGAT. Thus, it is safe to conclude that this mutant existed in oligomeric form. Nevertheless, rGATΔC was not inserted into the plasma membrane. This indicates that an intact carboxyl terminus is also required for ER export. Presumably, the carboxyl terminus represents a docking site for a component of the machinery that recruits rGAT into the budding vesicles and/or targets it to the subsequent compartment. The amino terminus of rGAT is known to bind syntaxin-1A (45Quick M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5686-5691Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), a member of the t-SNARE family; proteins that bind to the carboxyl terminus of rGAT have not yet been identified. In our search for transporters, which are retained in intracellular compartments but have presumably normal transport characteristics, we focused on the carboxyl terminus, because its proteolytic removal does not affect the ability of purified rGAT to transport substrate (46Mabjeesh N.J. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2563-2568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Truncation of the carboxyl terminus by 38 amino acids reducedV max by 75% relative to cells expressing the full-length transporter (47Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); the reason for the reduction was not explored, but it may presumably reflect intracellular retention of the truncated transporter. rGATΔC, the mutant investigated in the present work, lacks 45 amino acids; this mutant was not present at the cell surface to any appreciable extent. Conversely, a mutant of rGAT, in which the carboxyl terminus is truncated by 36 amino acids, was delivered to the apical membrane of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells in a manner similar to wild type rGAT (48Perego C. Bulbarelli A. Longhi R. Caimi M. Villa A. Caplan M.J. Pietrini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6584-6592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The interpretation of our results and those obtained in the earlier two studies is limited by the fact that three different cell types were used. With this obvious caveat in mind, it is possible to postulate that the first 7–9 amino acids immediately adjacent to the last trans-membrane span play an important role in supporting export of rGAT from the ER.Although the phenomenon of FRET has been known for some 5 decades (49Förster T. Ann. d. Physik (Leipzig). 1948; 2: 57-75Google Scholar), FRET microscopy has only been applied recently to the study of membrane proteins in living cells. A standard argument raised against this approach is the conjecture that membrane proteins, in particular when heterologously overexpressed, are tightly packed in the bilayer (e.g. Ref. 50Wilson M.C. Meredith D. Halestrap A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3666-3672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar); this accumulation and the restricted mobility of membrane proteins (often referred to as “membrane crowding”) are invoked as a nonspecific source of FRET (thought to support FRET in a nonspecific manner). Our experiments refute this argument in a definitive manner; wild type YFP-rGAT and YFP-rGAT-L97A accumulated to levels in the plasma membrane that allowed for equivalent V max of inward (and outward) transport. Nevertheless, the lack of 9 atoms in YFP-rGAT-L97A sufficed to abolish or greatly blunt resonance energy transfer. This establishes the specificity of FRET microscopy beyond reasonable doubt.

The medical relevance of these proteins is obvious; for instance, it has long been known that antidepressant drugs block the transporter for norepinephrine and serotonin (2Axelrod J. Whitby L.G. Hertting G. Science. 1961; 133: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Likewise, tiagabine, an inhibitor of GABA transport, is used as an anticonvulsant in the treatment of epileptic seizures (3Iversen L. Mol. Psychiatry. 2000; 5: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Transporters support bidirectional flux of substrate, i.e. not only do they mediate influx of substrate but they also allow for non-exocytotic release of substrate (4Levi G. Raiteri M. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 415-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Compounds that induce reverse transport enjoy widespread popularity among illicit drug users; this is particularly true for amphetamine and its congeners, including ecstasy. Increasing evidence suggests that neurotransmitter transporters are oligomers (5Klingenberg M. Nature. 1981; 290: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 6Veenhoff L.M. Heuberger E.H.

https://openalex.org/W2168941494,"Recently, several studies have reported oligomerization of G protein-coupled receptors, although the functional implications of this phenomenon are still unclear. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and coimmunoprecipitation (COIP), we previously reported that the human thyrotropin (TSH) receptor tagged with green fluorescent protein (TSHRGFP) and expressed in a heterologous system was present as oligomeric complexes on the cell surface. Here, we have extended this biophysical and biochemical approach to study the regulation of such oligomeric complexes. Co-expression of TSHRGFP and TSHRMyc constructs in Chinese hamster ovary cells resulted in FRET-positive cells. The specificity of the FRET signal was verified by the absence of energy transfer in individually transfected TSHRGFP and TSHRMyc:Cy3 cells cultured together and also by acceptor photobleaching. Occupation of the receptor molecule by the ligand (TSH) resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the FRET index from 20% in the absence of TSH to <1% with 103 microunits/ml of TSH. Such reduction in oligomeric forms was also confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation. Exposure of TSHRGFP/Myc cells to forskolin or cytochalasin D caused no change in the FRET index, confirming that the decrease in the oligomeric complexes was a receptor-dependent phenomenon and free of energy or microtuble requirements. The TSH-induced decrease in TSHR oligomers was found to be secondary to dissociation of the TSHR complexes as evidenced by an increase in fluorescent intensity of photobleached spots of GFP fluorescence with 103microunits/ml of TSH. These data indicated that the less active conformation of the TSHR was comprised of receptor complexes and that such complexes were dissociated on the binding of ligand. Such observations support the concept of a constitutively active TSHR dimer or monomer that is naturally inhibited by the formation of higher order complexes. Inhibition of these oligomeric forms by ligand binding returns the TSHR to an activated state.

These data indicated that the less active conformation of the TSHR was comprised of receptor complexes and that such complexes were dissociated on the binding of ligand. Such observations support the concept of a constitutively active TSHR dimer or monomer that is naturally inhibited by the formation of higher order complexes. Inhibition of these oligomeric forms by ligand binding returns the TSHR to an activated state.

This G protein-coupled receptor, comprising a large ectodomain attached by disulfide linkages to a membrane-anchored subunit, embodies unique features absent in other glycoprotein hormone receptors such as the luteinizing hormone receptor and follicle-stimulating hormone receptor. Proteolysis (cleavage) of the TSH holoreceptor into the two disulfide-linked subunits (A or α and B or β) and the presence of two “inserts” of 8 and 50 residues within the large ectodomain are unique hallmarks of this receptor (4Rees S.B.

Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 1-11Google Scholar). Our recent studies using FRET and coimmunoprecipitation confirmed the presence of TSH receptor (TSHR) homophilic complexes in cells expressing this receptor (8Latif R. Graves P. Davies T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45217-45224Google Scholar). To further explore the dynamics of such juxtapositioned TSHR complexes on the cell surface, in real time, we have now used a labeled antibody-based FRET approach (24Verveer P.J. Wouters F.S. Reynolds A.R. Bastiaens P.I. Science. 2000; 290: 1567-1570Google Scholar) along with coimmunoprecipitation. These data demonstrated the regulation of these oligomeric complexes by ligand binding, which promoted the formation of receptor monomers. As described previously (8Latif R. Graves P. Davies T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45217-45224Google Scholar), TSHRGFP constructs were made by fusing the 3′ end of a modified human TSHR (stop codon removed) to the N terminus of a GFP vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). A second construct, TSHRMyc, was made likewise by fusion of 3′ end of the same TSHR to the N terminus of a c-Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) in the vector pCDNA3.1/Myc-His(−) B vector (Invitrogen). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml of penicillin and streptomycin were seeded at a density of 0.3 × 106/well in 24-well plates. Transfections were performed the following day using Lipofection (LipofectAMINE 2000; Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer. All of the transfections were split after 48 h and selected with 750 μg/ml of G418 (neomycin sulfate). Stable clones obtained from the above transfections were further purified by cell sorting for TSHRGFP clones. To obtain a differentially tagged stable clone, TSHRGFP-positive cells were transfected with an hygromycin-containing plasmid (pCEP4; Invitrogen) and TSHRMyc at 1:1 and 1:5 ratios of each DNA, respectively. As described above, the cells were split after 48 h of transfection and selected for stable clones. The clones thus selected were maintained in 500 μg/ml of G418 and 200 μg/ml of hygromycin. The expression of both transgenes in these stable clones was ascertained by flow cytometry and microscopy. The cells of clones expressing receptor tagged with GFP, Myc, or GFP plus Myc were treated with 1 mm EDTA/EGTA, pH 7.4, for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were collected with gentle pipetting and washed twice with PBS, pH 7.4. For GFP analysis, 1 × 106 cells were suspended in ice-cold FACS buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, with 0.02% sodium azide) and read under FL1 (green channel), and expression of Myc was assayed by initially fixing the cells with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min followed by 0.5% saponin for 5 min. The fixed and permeabilized cells were then stained with 1 μg/106 cells of anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10; Hybridoma Core, Mount Sinai School of Medicine) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells, after washing twice with FACS buffer, were further incubated with anti-mouse phycoerythrin-labeled secondary antibody (Sigma) at 1:100 dilution. Untransfected CHO cells stained with anti-Myc alone and secondary antibody alone were the controls. The fluorescence of 10,000 cells/tube was assayed under FL2 (red channel) using a BD FACS SCAN flow cytofluorometer (Core FACS Facility, Mount Sinai School of Medicine). To determine whether TSHRGFP receptors and TSHRMyc receptors were functional, production of cAMP in response to bovine TSH (Sigma) was evaluated in stable clones of TSHRGFP and TSHRMyc using the Biotrak cAMP enzyme immunoassay system (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, 30,000 cells/well were seeded in microtiter plates, and after 48 h of growth the cells were stimulated with the indicated concentration of TSH for 1 h at 37 °C. Intracellular cAMP was measured in the lysate as per the manufacturer. A stable clone coexpressing similar levels of TSHRGFP:TSHRMyc was used for the FRET study. 0.3 × 106 cells were seeded in a four-well, pretreated chamber slide (Labtek) and incubated overnight in 1 ml of Ham's F-12 complete medium at 37 °C with 5% CO2. These adherent cells were washed twice with PBS, pH 7.4, and incubated further with different concentrations of bovine TSH. The cells were washed and then treated for 3 min with 10 mmsodium azide to arrest endocytosis and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature. The fixed cells were preblocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C and were stained for Myc by using directly labeled anti-Myc:Cy3 (Sigma) for 2 h at 37 °C in a moist chamber. The stained cells were washed five times with PBS and mounted using Vectashield (Vector Labs, Inc.). Imaging was performed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica LSCM). Filters for these experiments were: 1) TSHRGFP: excitation, 488 nm; emission, 522 nm; 2) TSHRMyc:Cy3: excitation, 550 nm; emission, 570 nm; and 3) FRET: excitation, 488 nm; emission, 570 nm. The images were acquired using a 63× objective with a NA of 1.32 and a pinhole setting of 1. All scanned images thus acquired were transferred to a Leica NT work station. To prevent spectral cross-talk between the two fluorophores, the GFP (donor) excitation laser (488 nm) window was set to 38%, and Cy3 excitation (568 nm) window was set to 0. Any cell overexpressing GFP was excluded from the assay, five images (8 bit 1024 × 1024) of the untreatedversus the treated were acquired, and the FRET-positive cells were counted. The “mean FRET index” was calculated by dividing the number of FRET-positive cells by the average obtained from five fields multiplied by 100. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting as described (8Latif R. Graves P. Davies T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45217-45224Google Scholar, 25Zeng F.Y. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19487-19497Google Scholar). Briefly, a stable doubly transfected CHO (TSHRGFP:TSHRMyc) clone (tested previously for expression) was expanded, and the cells were detached using 1 mm EDTA/EGTA and collected by centrifugation. PBS-washed cell pellets were incubated on ice for 20 min with 0.2% digitonin in PBS containing protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Following centrifugation at 2000 × gfor 10 min, the supernatants were discarded, and cell pellets were treated with lysis buffer (PBS containing 1% digitonin, 0.5% deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors) for 1 h at 4 °C. The cell lysates were then centrifuged in a refrigerated microcentrifuge at maximum speed for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants containing solubilized receptors were used either directly for immunoprecipitation or stored at −80 °C. For immunoprecipitation 200 μg of membrane protein in PBS containing 0.5% digitonin, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and protease inhibitors was first reacted overnight with 1 μg/ml of anti-Myc antibody at 4 °C followed by 3 h of incubation with protein A-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% digitonin, and eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. SDS-PAGE was performed essentially as described by Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The samples were eluted from protein A-agarose using a 2-fold concentrated sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 100 mmdithiothreitol, 4% SDS, and 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% dried skimmed milk in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and then probed with1 μg/ml of primary antibody (polyclonal anti-GFP, Clontech) for 1 h at room temperature in 5% milk with PBST. The washed membranes were then incubated with 1:3000 of secondary antibody (anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase; Bio-Rad) for 1 h at room temperature. After final washing bound secondary antibodies were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Super Signal ECL; Pierce). This method was used to confirm FRET specificity. The acceptor was irreversibly photobleached, and the increase in fluorescence intensity of the donor was recorded. Accordingly, 0.3 × 106/well of cotransfected cells were cultured overnight on chamber slides and were then washed twice with PBS, pH 7.4. The cells were then fixed with 2% paraformaldehye for 1 h at room temperature. The washed cells were preblocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min followed by anti-Myc labeled with Cy3. After washing five times with PBS, the cells were mounted in 50% glycerol in PBS. The photobleaching used the confocal microscope described earlier. For photobleaching the helium/neon/argon laser was used at its maximum power. Simultaneous images were acquired of donor (GFP) and acceptor (Cy3) before bleaching by scanning with 50% 488-nm laser and 100% 568-nm laser lines. Anti-Myc:Cy3-stained cells to be bleached were scanned repeatedly with the 568-nm laser line (488-nm scanning window set to 0 to prevent any GFP photobleaching) for 2 min and 30 s for maximum bleaching of the Cy3 fluorochrome. Post-bleached images were acquired by reverting back to the original settings. All measurements were obtained using a 40× 1NA objective, and samples labeled with the donor and acceptor alone were used to verify non-cross-over between the fluorophores. Intensity measurements were performed using ScionImage beta 4.2 software (Scion Corporation, Inc.). In this technique, fluorescent molecules in a small region of the cell were irreversibly photobleached using a high powered laser beam. Subsequent movement of surrounding nonbleached fluorescent molecules into the photobleached area was recorded at low laser power (27Lippincott-Schwartz J. Snapp E. Kenworthy A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 444-456Google Scholar). In this study, spot fluorescence recovery after photobleaching used laser scanning confocal microscope with a 40× objective and NA1.32. Images (8 bit 512 × 512) were acquired for pre- and post-bleached time points. The cells were grown on Delta TC3 dishes and maintained at 37 °C on an electrically heated thermal stage. The 40× objective was also maintained at the same temperature during the entire course of the experiment to minimize any thermal aberrations during image collection. A 2-s exposure of a annotated spot on the cell surface with all three laser lines (488, 568, and 633 nm) at 70% power produced a bleached spot, and the recovery of the bleached spot was monitored by collecting images of the same bleached cell every 3 s for a period of 1 min. Intensities in the region of interest in the pre- and post-bleached images on the cell were then measured using the IPLabs V3.5 software (Scanalytics, Inc.). Two distinct tagged receptor constructs were prepared: 1) wild type human TSHR receptor fused in-frame with GFP and 2) wild type human TSHR fused with a Myc epitope at the C terminus of the receptor. These constructs were transfected into CHO cells and selected for clones expressing TSHRGFP or TSHRMyc. Double transfected clones,i.e. cells expressing both TSHRGFP and TSHRMyc were also generated following transfection of the TSHRMyc construct into stably expressing TSHRGFP cells. Expression of Myc in these cells was detected using a monoclonal antibody to Myc followed by anti-mouse phycoerythrin-labeled secondary antibody. Fig.1 shows the expression of TSHRGFP (panel A) and TSHRMyc(panel B) in individually transfected stable representative clones. Fig. 1 C shows the expression of these transgenes in a representative double transfected clone. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov analysis on these doubly transfected cells (Fig. 1 D) indicated similar expression levels of the two fusion proteins within the same population of cells. The merged confocal image (Fig.1 D, inset) of the cotransfected cells obtained by GFP fluorescence and anti-myc:Cy3 labeling showed the colocalization of GFP and Myc within the same cell and further confirmed expression of both the transgenes. The TSH receptor complexes with G proteins, which in turn activate the enzyme adenyl cyclase to generate cAMP. The functionality of these constructs was therefore verified by their ability to generate cAMP on stimulation with TSH. Both the TSHRGFP and TSHRMyc receptors elicited cAMP responses (Fig.2) when compared with the untagged wild type receptor (JPO9 cells), indicating their ability to signal despite their C-terminal tags. A lower affinity cAMP response by the TSHRGFP cells (Fig. 2, inset) compared with that of the TSHRMyc cells may have been secondary to steric hindrance caused by the larger molecular size of GFP and similar to our previous observations (8Latif R. Graves P. Davies T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45217-45224Google Scholar). Previously, we reported constitutive oligomerization of the human TSHR using FRET by fusion of TSHRGFP-expressing cells with TSHRRFP-expressing cells (8Latif R. Graves P. Davies T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45217-45224Google Scholar). Although the spectra of GFP and RFP are well suited for FRET, this pair of tags could not be used as a practical system to study the regulation of oligomerization because of possible tetramerization of red fluorescent protein (28Cornea A. Janovick J.A. Maya-Nunez G. Conn P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2153-2158Google Scholar), which could lead to TSHRRFP aggregation. This problem was overcome by using an antibody directly labeled with Cy3 to detect TSHRMyc. Using this system, an optimum dilution of the acceptor label could be determined for a bright FRET signal. Our previous finding of constitutive oligomerization of the TSHR was further supported by this technique (29Kenworthy A.K. Methods. 2001; 24: 289-296Google Scholar, 30Truong K. Ikura M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 573-578Google Scholar) using TSHRGFPand TSHRmyc labeled with anti-Myc Cy3 (Fig.3). In this system there was an energy transfer from the excited donor TSHRGFP to the TSHRMyc:Cy3 acceptor, indicating the close proximity of the two receptor molecules. The fluorophores GFP and Cy3 formed a favorable Förster donor-acceptor pair with an R 0value (defined as the distance at which 50% of the excited donor molecules transferred energy by FRET) of 6 nm (29Kenworthy A.K. Methods. 2001; 24: 289-296Google Scholar). A detectable FRET signal could therefore be interpreted as a direct interaction between the two receptors. A number of controls were performed to ensure that the fluorescent properties of the TSHR constructs were appropriate. In particular, a total absence of energy transfer in a physically mixed population of TSHRGFP and TSHRMyc individually transfected cells and probed with anti-Myc-labeled Cy3 (Fig.4 D) was observed. This was also compared with the FRET positivity seen in doubly transfected cells (Fig. 4 A) and demonstrated a requirement for physical proximity for energy transfer. Another measure to ensure the specificity of energy transfer of FRET was acceptor photobleaching. As indicated in Fig. 5, the sharp drop in the fluorescence intensity of the acceptor Cy3 (panels A andB and filled bars in right panel) was compensated by the marginal increase in the intensity of the donor GFP (panels C and D and open bars inright panel). This increase was due to the lack of acceptor absorbing the energy liberated by the donor, which in turn leads to a higher emission from the donor. Using the above data, the extent of receptor-receptor interaction and the proximity of receptor molecules were estimated to be in the range of 50–100 Å, which was again indicative of constitutive oligomerization of the TSH receptors.Figure 5Acceptor photobleaching. In TSHRGFP:TSHRMyc cells the acceptor label (Cy3) was photobleached by repeated scanning with the 568-nm laser.A and B are pre- and post-bleached images of the acceptor. C and D are corresponding donor (GFP) images in the same cell. The boxes indicate the annotated areas used for intensity measurements. The graph in theright panel indicates the intensity of the acceptor and the donor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Having shown that TSHR-transfected cells expressed both receptors and were colocalized (interdispersed) on the plasma membrane in a constitutively oligomeric state, it was important to examine whether this oligomeric state was regulated by the TSH ligand. Following increasing concentrations of TSH, the FRET index of these cells showed a dose-dependent decrease in oligomeric complexes. A decrease to almost undetectable levels was observed with 103microunits/ml of TSH as compared with a 20–30% basal index for untreated cells (Fig. 6 A). This decrease in the oligomeric complex of TSH-treated cells was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. 6 B). Solubilized cell membranes prepared from doubly transfected cells treated with increasing doses of TSH were immunoprecipitated with Myc antibody. Immunoprecipitates were then analyzed for the presence of oligomeric forms by Western blot with GFP peptide antibody. As seen in Fig.6 B, there was a complete absence of the 85-kDa band in >102 microunits/ml TSH-treated cells. By molecular size estimation the 85 kDa conformed to a large TSHR β subunit (58 kDa) linked to GFP (27 kDa). The absence of uncleaved TSH holoreceptor from the coimmunoprecipitates also suggested that the 85-kDa band seen in the immunoblot was formed by TSHR subunits existing as oligomers and that cleavage may be essential for oligomerization. Thus, the TSH-induced decrease seen in the coimmunoprecipitation corroborated with our previous FRET findings. To study whether TSH regulation of oligomeric TSHR complexes was a receptor-mediated phenomenon, the TSHRGFP:TSHRMyc transfected cells were treated with increasing concentrations of forskolin to stimulate the adenyl cyclase system independent of the receptor. As shown in Fig.7, there was no significant decrease in the FRET index of forskolin-treated cells, in contrast to the control cells, which were treated with increasing amounts of TSH. Similarly, treating these cells with increasing doses of cytochalasin-D (Fig.8), a cytoskeleton disrupting agent, did not affect FRET positivity, implying that TSHR receptors were forming “microaggregates” not affected by actomyosin disruption (28Cornea A. Janovick J.A. Maya-Nunez G. Conn P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2153-2158Google Scholar). These observations suggested that the dissociation of the oligomers and the consequent decrease in FRET was a direct effect of TSH binding rather than downstream modulation.Figure 8Negative effect of cytochalasin D on oligomerization. The white bars represent the mean FRET indices of cells treated with different doses of cytochalasin D. Theshaded bars are mean FRET indices of control TSH-treated cells. The data represented are the means ± S.E. from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The TSH-mediated dissociation of constitutive oligomerization was ascertained by measuring the lateral diffusion of the receptors on the cell surface of TSHRGFP-expressing cells using FRAP. If exposure to TSH caused a decrease in the oligomers seen by FRET by dissociating the complexes, then the monomeric units of the tagged receptor outside the zone of bleaching would have a faster mobility into the bleached area than larger oligomeric forms. Thus, for the same duration of measurement, the bleached spot would show a higher recovery of fluorescence if there was faster movement of receptor units. Therefore, photobleaching of live cells treated with varying amounts of TSH was measured on TSHRGFP-positive cells in the presence of cyclohexamide to inhibit newly synthesized receptor (Fig.9). A higher fluorescence intensity of the post-bleached spot at 103 microunits/ml TSH was seen as compared with those at lower TSH concentrations. This recovery in the intensity suggested dissociation of TSHRGFP oligomeric complexes following ligand binding to the receptor, causing faster movement of the monomeric receptors into the photobleached spot. A large number of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been shown to be oligomerized, and a number of reports have described the existence of homo- and hetero-oligomers (10Bouvier M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 274-286Google Scholar, 13Devi L.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 324-326Google Scholar, 17Rios C.D. Jordan B.A. Gomes I. Devi L.A. Pharmacol.

Neuropsychopharmacology. 2000; 23: S3-S4Google Scholar). The human TSHR, a member of this G protein-coupled family, also exists as homo-oligomers (7Graves P.N. Vlase H. Bobovnikova Y. Davies T.F. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3915-3920Google Scholar, 8Latif R. Graves P. Davies T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45217-45224Google Scholar). Therefore, in this study, using FRET and coimmunoprecipitation, we have addressed the regulation of these homo-oligomers by TSH. The results of our study showed that 1) TSH regulates these constitutive oligomers in a dose-dependent manner and 2) the ligand-induced changes in the TSHR reflected a dissociation of the oligomers as indicated by FRAP studies and the formation of monomers. Recent advances in epitope tagging and development of biophysical methods such as FRET and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (27Lippincott-Schwartz J. Snapp E. Kenworthy A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 444-456Google Scholar, 32Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689Google Scholar) have facilitated the detection in real time of GPCR oligomers and the examination of the role of ligand in oligomerization in several GPCRs, such as the β-adrenergic receptor, the α-mating factor, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, so"
https://openalex.org/W2161966432,"Smad proteins have been demonstrated to be key components in the transforming growth factor β signaling cascade. Here we demonstrate that Smad4, together with Smad3, can interact with the androgen receptor (AR) in the DNA-binding and ligand-binding domains, which may result in the modulation of 5α-dihydrotestosterone-induced AR transactivation. Interestingly, in the prostate PC3 and LNCaP cells, addition of Smad3 can enhance AR transactivation, and co-transfection of Smad3 and Smad4 can then repress AR transactivation in various androgen response element-promoter reporter assays as well as Northern blot and reverse transcription-PCR quantitation assays with prostate-specific antigen mRNA expression. In contrast, in the SW480·C7 cells, lacking endogenous functional Smad4, the influence of Smad3 on AR transactivation is dependent on the various androgen response element-promoters. The influence of Smad3/Smad4 on the AR transactivation may involve the acetylation since the treatment of trichostatin A or sodium butyrate can reverse Smad3/Smad4-repressed AR transactivation and Smad3/Smad4 complex can also decrease the acetylation level of AR. Together, these results suggest that the interactions between AR, Smad3, and Smad4 may result in the differential regulation of the AR transactivation, which further strengthens their roles in the prostate cancer progression.

Upon phosphorylation, these Smads will associate with Smad4 and move into the nucleus where they assemble transcriptional complexes that activate specific sets of genes. Thus, Smad4 is a shared key component of these various signaling pathways. A distinct structural feature that distinguishes Smad4 from other Smads is the lack of the SSXS motif at the tail of the Mad homology 2 (MH2) domain terminal that can be phosphorylated by the cognate receptor kinases (3Zhang Y.

Smad4 was originally identified as a candidate tumor suppressor gene in chromosome 18q21 that was somatically deleted/ mutated/inactivated in many pancreatic or colorectal tumors (11Takaku K.

The introduction of theSmad4 gene into Smad4-null cells also suggested that the wild type Smad4 could decrease the cell growth rate, cause a cell cycle arrest, and induce apoptosis (13Dai J.L.

Pegram M. Slamon D. Bookstein R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1111-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), a significant increase of Smad4 was observed in the normal ventral prostate, as well as in the prostate tumors after castration. Moreover, a previous report has shown that the staining for Smad4 was present in areas with a large number of apoptotic cells in the prostate after castration (16Brodin G. ten Dijke P. Funa K. Heldin C.H. Landstrom M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2731-2738PubMed Google Scholar). The androgen receptor (AR), a member of the steroid receptor superfamily, functions as an androgen-dependent transcriptional factor (17Chang C.S. Kokontis J. Liao S.T. Science. 1988; 240: 324-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). After binding to ligand, the activated AR is able to recognize palindromic DNA sequences, called androgen response elements (AREs), and form a complex with AR-associated proteins to induce the expression of AR target genes. Several AR coregulators (ARAs), such as ARA24, ARA54, ARA55, ARA70, ARA160, and ARA267, and Rb, BRCA1, and TIFIIH have been isolated and characterized (18Hsiao P.W. Chang C. J. Biol.

Results from these studies suggest that coregulators not only can enhance AR transactivation, but may also be able to increase the agonist activity of antiandrogens and 17-β estradiol (26Miyamoto H. Yeh S. Wilding G. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7379-7384Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) in prostate cancer cells. Previously, we discovered that Smad3 could function as a positive coregulator for AR in prostate cancer DU145 cells (27Kang H.Y. Lin H.K., Hu, Y.C. Yeh S. Huang K.E. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3018-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We further showed that endogenous prostate-specific antigen (PSA) mRNA in LNCaP cells can be induced by 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and the Smad3 further enhanced the PSA expression levels. In addition, several studies also showed that Smad3 can interact with other nuclear receptors, such as estrogen receptor and vitamin D receptor, and enhance these receptors-mediated transactivation (28Matsuda T. Yamamoto T. Muraguchi A. Saatcioglu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42908-42914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 29Subramaniam N. Leong G.M. Cock T.A. Flanagan J.L. Fong C. Eisman J.A. Kouzmenko A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15741-15746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As Smad4 proteins have been found to functionally interact with Smad3 (3Zhang Y. Feng X., We, R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar), AP-1 (30Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), and p300/CBP (31Feng X.H. Zhang Y., Wu, R.Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), it is reasonable that Smad4 may also play an important role in the modulation of the androgen-mediated signal pathway. Here, we demonstrate that both Smad4 and Smad3 can interact with AR in the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and the ligand-binding domain (LBD). Moreover, Smad4 can decrease the AR-Smad3 interaction and repress the Smad3-enhanced AR transactivation. The fact that these interesting inhibitory functions of Smad3/Smad4 on AR transactivation can be reversed by the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors raises the possibility that Smad3/Smad4 may cooperate with HDAC complex to modulate AR acetylation. This linkage not only strengthens the roles of Smad3/Smad4 in the prostate cancer cells, it may also further indicate the importance of the acetylation activity in the modulation of AR function in prostate cancer. DHT and hydroxyflutamide were from Schering. pSG5-wild type AR (wtAR) and pCMV-AR were used in our previous report (19Kang H.Y. Yeh S. Fujimoto N. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8570-8576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).

Human prostate cancer DU145 cells and PC3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Minimum Essential Medium containing penicillin (25 units/ml), streptomycin (25 μg/ml), and 5% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method, and cells were harvested after 24 h for the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay, as described previously (19Kang H.Y. Yeh S. Fujimoto N. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8570-8576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The CAT activity was visualized and quantitated by STORM 840 (Molecular Dynamics). At least three independent experiments were carried out in each case. The SW480·C7 cells and PC3-AR2 cells were the gifts from Dr. Eric J. Stanbridge and Dr. T. J. Brown. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmol/l NaCl, 1 mmol/l EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin). An aliquot of each sample was used for determination of protein content using the Bradford protein assay reagent. Samples with equivalent amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% acrylamide gel as described previously (19Kang H.Y. Yeh S. Fujimoto N. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8570-8576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Blots were developed using the ECL Western blot analysis system from AmershamBiosciences. Fusion proteins of GST-Smad3, GST-AR, and GST protein alone were obtained by transforming expressing plasmids into BL21 (DE3) pLysS strain competent cells followed with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. GST-fusion proteins then were purified by glutathione-SepharoseTM 4B (Amersham Biosciences). The wtAR and deletion mutant AR proteins labeled with 35S were generated in vitro using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). For the in vitro interaction, the glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST-proteins were mixed with 5 μl of35S-labeled TNT proteins in the presence or absence of 1 μm DHT at 4 °C for 3 h. The bound proteins were separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by using autoradiography. PC3 Cells were co-transfected with AR and FLAG-Smad4 and FLAG-Smad3 for 16 h and then treated with vehicle or 10 nm DHT for another 16 h. LNCaP and PC3-AR2 cells were treated with vehicle or 10 nm DHT for 16 h. The cells were lysed and incubated with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), polyclonal Smad4 and Smad3 antibodies (Santa Cruz), or control IgG at 4 °C for 2 h depending on the experimental design, followed by addition of protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz) for 1 h at 4 °C. The bound proteins were separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted with polyclonal AR antibody (NH27), Smad4, and Smad3 antibodies or anti-FLAG antibody. The bands were detected using an alkaline phosphatase detection kit (Bio-Rad). Fluorescence signal from each real time quantitative PCR reaction (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) is collected as normalized values plotted versus the cycle number. Reactions are characterized by comparing threshold cycle (C T) values. The C T is a value defined the fractional cycle number at which the sample fluorescence signal passes a fixed threshold above base. Quantitative values are obtained from the C T number at which the increase in signal associated with an exponential growth of PCR product starts to be detected (using PerkinElmer Life Sciences systems analysis software) according to the manufacturer's manual. The precise amount of total RNA added to each reaction (based on absorbance) and its quality (i.e. lack of extensive degradation) are both difficult to assess. Therefore, we also quantified transcripts of the gene β-actin as the endogenous RNA control, and each sample was normalized on the basis of its β-actin content. The relative target gene expression level was also normalized to the calibrator. The final results, expressed as N-fold differences in target gene expression relative to the β-actin gene and the calibrator termed “N target” were determined as follows: Ntarget = 2−(ΔC Tsample−ΔC Tcalibrator), where ΔC T values of the sample and calibrator are determined by subtracting the average CT value of the target gene from the average CT value of the β-actin gene. The target cDNA sequence was evaluated using the Primer Express software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (see Table I in Fig. 1). The forward and reverse primers were designed to lie in adjacent exons to prevent amplification genomic DNA that may be contained in samples. Total RNA was extracted from LNCaP cell lines by using the TRIZOL (Invitrogen). The quality of the RNA samples was determined by electrophoresis through agarose gels and staining with ethidium bromide. The 18 S and 28 S RNA bands were visualized under UV light. All of the PCR reactions were performed using an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (Invitrogen). PCR was performed using the SYBR® Green PCR Core Reagents kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The amplification reactions were performed in 25 ml of final volume containing 10× SYBR buffer, 25 mmof MgCl2, 12.5 mm of dNTP, 0.625 units of AmpliTaq Gold and 0.25 units of uracil N-glycosylase. Final AR, PSA, and β-actin forward, reverse concentrations were 2.5 μm. To reduce variability between replicates, PCR premixes, which contained all reagents except for total RNA, were prepared and aliquoted into 1.5-ml microfuge tubes. The thermal cycling conditions comprised an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 10 min and 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Specific PCR amplification products were detected by the fluorescent double-stranded DNA-binding dye SYBR Green core reagent kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Experiments were performed with duplicates for each data point. To study the potential correlation between AR and Smads in prostate cancer cells, we first chose prostate cancer PC3-AR2 cells, which were stably transfected with wtAR, to examine the effect of Smads on androgen-mediated mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter activity. Activation of MMTV-CAT activity was achieved by treating with 10−8m DHT (Fig.1 A, lane 1 versus 2), and this androgen-activated transactivation was further enhanced by the addition of Smad3, but not Smad4 (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and 4 versus 5 and 6). Interestingly, Smad3-enhanced AR transactivation was significantly repressed by adding Smad4 (Fig. 1 A, lane 3 versus 7). Similar results were obtained with LNCaP cells that expressed mutated but functional AR (Fig. 1 A). Next, we examined the effect of Smads on AR transactivation by increasing the dose of Smad3, Smad4, and steroid hormone receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) in PC3-AR2 cells. As shown in Fig. 1 B, in the presence of Smad3, the addition of Smad4 can result in the repression of Smad3-enhanced AR transactivation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B, lane 3 versus 4, 5, and 6). On the other hand, in the presence of Smad4, AR transactivation was slightly repressed (Fig.1 B, lane 2 versus 10), and adding Smad3 could then further repress AR transactivation (Fig.1 B, lane 10 versus 11,12, and 13). In contrast, addition of SRC-1 can then increase AR transactivation in the presence of Smad3 or Smad4 (lane 3 versus 7, 8,9 and lane 10 versus 14,15, and 16). Together, these results from reporter assays suggested that the amount of Smad4 available might have a major influence on the Smad3 effect on the AR transactivation. To further confirm Smad3/Smad4 repression effects on AR transactivation and reduce potential artifact effects related to reporter assays, we then applied Northern blot to assay Smad3/Smad4 repression effect on AR endogenous target gene PSA mRNA expression. In LNCaP cells, 10 nm DHT increases PSA mRNA expression (Fig. 1 C, lane 1 versus 2). Addition of Smad3 further enhances DHT-induced PSA mRNA expression (Fig. 1 C, lane 2 versus 3), whereas addition of Smad4 alone has slight repression of PSA mRNA expression (Fig. 1 C,lane 2 versus 4). Addition of both Smad3 and Smad4 reverses the Smad3-enhanced PSA mRNA expression (Fig. 1 C, lane 5). Similar results were also obtained with the real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assay to measure PSA mRNA expression (Tables I and II in Fig. 1 and Fig. 1 D). Together, Fig. 1,C and D all confirmed the above ARE-reporter assays showing that addition of Smad3 alone can enhance AR transactivation and that addition of both Smad3 and Smad4 can then repress AR transactivation. Next, we examined the possibility of interaction between AR, Smad3, and Smad4. N-terminal FLAG-tagged, full-length Smad3 and Smad4 were expressed in PC3-AR2 cells and treated with DHT (or vehicle). Cell extracts were prepared for immunoprecipitations by using anti-FLAG or anti-AR antibodies. As shown in Fig.2 A, in the presence of FLAG-Smads, AR was able to be co-immunoprecipitated with Smad3 as we reported previously (27Kang H.Y. Lin H.K., Hu, Y.C. Yeh S. Huang K.E. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3018-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and Smad4 was detected in the AR complex both in the presence and absence of DHT. Moreover, Fig. 2 Bdemonstrated that immunoprecipitating against AR can also capture Smads/AR complexes. An in vivo co-immunoprecipitation assay was applied to demonstrate that the endogenous Smad4 immunocomplex exists in the absence or presence of DHT in PC3-AR2 cells but not in AR-negative PC3 cells. A similar result was also obtained when we replaced PC3-AR2 with LNCaP cells. To dissect which individual domain of AR can interact with Smad4, we used GST-Smad4 fusion proteins incubated with various AR deletion mutants in pull-down experiments. As shown in Fig.3 A, the full-length wtAR could interact with Smad4 both in the presence and absence of 10 nm DHT. While AR-DBD/LBD peptides could interact with Smad4, we also found that both AR-DBD and AR-LBD peptides interact with Smad4 but not N-terminal AR peptide. Similar results were obtained with GST-AR, which can also bind to Smad3 or Smad4 (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that both DBD and LBD domains of AR may contain binding sites for Smad4 or Smad3 interactions. In addition, when we used GST-Smad3 to incubate with AR and added different amounts of Smad4 to this protein complex, the full-length wtAR could interact with Smad3. Interestingly, addition of Smad4 can decrease this AR-Smad3 interaction in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 C). Previous reports showed that Smad3 can interact with Smad4 (1Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 35List H.J. Smith C.L. Rodriguez O. Danielsen M. Riegel A.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 36Sharma M. Sun Z. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1918-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and our results further demonstrated that both Smad3 and Smad4 can interact with AR in the DBD and LBD. It is possible that Smad4 may either directly compete with Smad3 for the same AR binding sites or that Smad4 may simply have a higher binding affinity than Smad3 to bind to AR. We reasoned that the identification of the domains in Smad3 and Smad4 required for their association with AR transcriptional activity would provide us with tools to dissect the roles of Smad3 and Smad4 in Smads-mediated repression of AR transactivation. Therefore, we tested which region(s) within the Smad4 are important for repression of Smad3-enhanced AR transactivation. As shown in Fig.4 A, addition of Smad3 increased the AR transactivation (lane 2 versus 3), co-transfection of Smad4 and Smad3 can then repress the Smad3-enhanced AR transactivation (lane 3 versus 7) in PC3 cells. In contrast, replacing Smad4 with a Smad4 mutant, with a C-terminal deletion, can only show partial repression effect (lane 7 versus 8). On the other hand, a C-terminal deletion of Smad3 resulted in the loss of the Smad3-enhanced effect on the AR transactivation (lane 3 versus 4). As previous reports indicated that the MH2 region of the C-terminal Smad proteins is important for homo-oligomerization and hetero-oligomerization (11Takaku K. Oshima M. Miyoshi H. Matsui M. Seldin M.F. Taketo M.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 645-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), it is possible that the C-terminal region is also important for Smad proteins to interact with AR and exert its function on the modulation of AR transactivation. To further dissect the repression domains of Smad4, a series of deletion mutants of Smad4 (Fig. 4 B), were tested in the Smad3-enhanced AR transactivation. Among all mutants, ΔM4, with a deletion of amino acids 274–322, and Smad4G508S have the greatest effect to reverse the Smad4 repression of Smad3-enhanced AR transactivation, suggesting that the region amino acids 274–322 and amino acid 508 within the C-terminal of Smad4 may play essential roles to repress Smad3-enhanced AR transactivation. Previously, p300/CBP was shown to be able to acetylate non-histone proteins including AR and the addition of trichostatin A (TSA), a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase activity, was shown to induce the androgen-mediated AR transactivation (34Fu M.

Other reports also suggested that some Smads could interact directly with several HDAC1-associated proteins, such as 5′TG3′ interacting factor (TGIF), c-ski, and SnoN-(37–40), which might play roles in the Smads-mediated transcriptional repression. Whether repression of AR by Smad3/Smad4 might involve the deacetylation of AR, however, remains unknown. We first tested if TSA had any influence on the Smad3/Smad4-mediated AR transactivation. As shown in Fig.5 A, addition of TSA can enhance AR transactivation in a dose-dependent manner (lane 2 versus lane 5, 8, and11). More importantly, addition of TSA can also reverse the Smad3/Smad4-repressed AR transactivation in a dose-dependent manner in PC3-AR2 cells (lane 3 versus 6, 9, and 12). A similar effect was also observed when cells were treated with NaB, another specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase (lane 13–15). To further determine whether Smad3 and Smad4 could influence the acetylation of AR, immunoprecipitation was performed using an AR-specific antibody on cell extracts transfected with different Smad expression vectors. The immunoprecipitate was subjected to Western blotting with an anti-acetyl-lysine antibody, AR-specific antibody, or anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 5 B, acetyl-lysine-immunoreactive bands were detected in the AR antibody IP complex, which have the identical mobility to the AR bands, whereas acetyl-lysine-immunoreactivity was decreased when cells were co-transfected with Smad3 and Smad4. Together, these results suggest that Smad3/Smad4 may modulate the endogenous deacetylase activity that results in the decrease of AR acetylation, consequently repressing AR transactivation.

Lipoxins (LXs), more recently described lipoxygenase products, modulate many proinflammatory actions of LTs and have impressive proresolution properties. Mesangial cell (MC) proliferation is a central event in the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis. LTD4-induced proliferation of mesangial cells is modulated by LXA4. Here, we demonstrate that LXA4 inhibits PDGF- and LTD4-stimulated proliferation through modulation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRbeta) activation. Specifically, we demonstrate that LTD4 transactivates the PDGFRbeta, a process associated with c-src recruitment and ras activation. We demonstrate expression of cysLT1 and cysLT2 receptors in MCs. LTD4-induced c-src activation was insensitive to pertussis toxin and the cysLT1 receptor antagonist Zafirlukast but was blocked by the nonselective antagonist Pobilukast. We show that LXA4 inhibits LTD4-stimulated activation of the PDGFRbeta and that LXA4 modulates PDGF-BB-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFRb and subsequent mitogenic events. Furthermore, expression of recombinant LXA4 receptor (ALXR) in CHOK1 cells was associated with an attenuation of serum-stimulated proliferation. These data demonstrate that LXA4 receptor (ALXR) activation is accompanied by antimitogenic effects coupled with inactivation of growth factor receptors, highlighting the complex cross-talk between G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases in an inflammatory milieu. These data elaborate on the profile of cell signaling events that underpin the anti-inflammatory and proresolution bioactions of LX."

Residues from α1Arg-273 to α1Ile-289 were mutated to cysteine, one at a time. MTSET+ or MTSES− reacted with all mutants from α1R273C to α1Y281C, except α1P277C, in the absence and presence of GABA. The MTSET+ closed-state reaction rate was >1000 liters/mol-s at α1N274C, α1S275C, α1K278C, and α1Y281C and was <300 liters/mol-s at α1R273C, α1L276C, α1V279C, α1A280C, and α1A284C. These two groups of residues lie on opposite sides of an α-helix. The fast reacting group lies on a continuation of the M2 segment channel-lining helix face.

The GABAA receptors are composed of five subunits arranged pseudo-symmetrically around the central channel axis. Each subunit has an extracellular N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain with four transmembrane segments (M1–M4) that are largely α helical (5Macdonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev.

The putative ends of the membrane-spanning segments have been defined on the basis of hydrophobicity and sequence analysis (7Schofield P.R. Darlison M.G. Fujita N. Burt D.R. Stephenson F.A.

There is, however, little experimental evidence to define precisely the ends of the helical membrane-spanning segments. The subunits of this gene superfamily are built on a modular basis. The extracellular domain forms the agonist binding sites and determines the order of subunit assembly around the channel axis (6Karlin A. Akabas M.H.

The C-terminal domain forms the ion channel that is largely lined by residues from the M2 membrane-spanning segments of each of the five subunits (13Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Gen.

Support for the concept of modular design comes from the ability to generate functional chimeras between the GABA ρ receptor extracellular domain and the glycine receptor membrane-spanning domain, or between serotonin Type 3 and ACh α7 receptors (15Eisele J.L.

In addition, in invertebrates, a number of “chimeras” have evolved that combine extracellular domains that bind ACh, serotonin, or glutamate with a GABAA-like, anion-selective, channel-forming, membrane-spanning domain (17Vassilatis D.K. Elliston K.O. Paress P.S. Hamelin M. Arena J.P. Schaeffer J.M. Van der Ploeg L.H. Cully D.F. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 44: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 18Ranganathan R. Cannon S.C. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 2000; 408: 470-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The conformational changes by which ligand binding is coupled to movement of the channel gate are unknown. Two regions of the membrane-spanning domain that might be involved in coupling to the extracellular domain are the pre-M1 region and the M2–M3 loop, the extracellular region that flanks the channel-lining M2 segment (Fig. 1). Depending on how the C-terminal end of M2 and the N-terminal end of M3 are defined, the M2–M3 loop is between 9 and 15 residues long. Only 3 to 5 residues would be necessary to form a β-turn between α helical M2 and M3 membrane-spanning segments. Several lines of evidence have implicated the M2–M3 loop in the signal transduction process. Mutations of three residues in the GABAA receptor γ2 subunit, two in the M2 segment and one in the M2–M3 loop aligned with α1Ala280, uncouples benzodiazepine binding in the extracellular domain from benzodiazepine potentiation of GABA-evoked currents (19Boileau A.J. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10213-10220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in the M2–M3 loop alter agonist efficacy in GABA, ACh, and glycine receptors (20Campos-Caro A. Sala S.

Auerbach A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The effect of many of these mutations is to uncouple or to reduce the coupling between ligand binding and channel gating (22Grosman C. Salamone F.N. Sine S.M. Auerbach A. J. Gen.

In α7/α3 chimeric nicotinic ACh receptors, mutation at Asp-266 in the M2–M3 loop of the α7 subunit exhibited poor response to different nicotinic agonists. Similar results were observed when the aligned residue in the ACh β4 subunit were mutated in α3/β4 ACh receptor (26Rovira J.C. Vicente-Agullo F. Campos-Caro A. Criado M. Sala F. Sala S. Ballesta J.J. Pflugers Arch. 1999; 439: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All these studies suggest that the M2–M3 loop may be involved in coupling conformational change between the two domains. There is, however, a paucity of data on the structure of the M2–M3 loop and little information on its structural dynamics during gating. Consistent with conformational change in this region, in the homo-pentameric glycine receptor, the water accessibility of residues in the N-terminal end of the M2–M3 loop increases in the presence of glycine (27Lynch J.W. Han N.L. Haddrill J. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2589-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To probe the structure and conformational changes that occur in the M2–M3 loop during channel gating, we used the substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM) (28Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A., Xu, M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 29Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). This method assays the water-surface accessibility of engineered cysteine residues by their reactivity with water-soluble, charged sulfhydryl-specific reagents (29Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The reagents used in this study were permanently charged derivatives of methanethiosulfonate (MTS), a positively charged derivative, MTS-ethyltrimethylammonium (MTSET+), and a negatively charged derivative, MTS-ethylsulfonate (MTSES−) (28Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A., Xu, M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). We mutated each of the α1 subunit residues between α1Arg-273 and α1Ile-289 to cysteine (Cys), one at a time. We measured the reaction rates of the MTS reagents with the engineered Cys residues in the absence and in the presence of GABA. In the absence of GABA, the residues in the region between α1Arg-273 and α1Tyr-281 can be divided into two groups based on the MTSET+ reaction rates. If this region is α helical, the two groups would lie on opposite faces of an α-helix. Additionally, we infer, based on increases in the reaction rates in the presence of GABA compared with the absence of GABA, that the region undergoes structural rearrangement during gating. At several positions in the M2–M3 loop the functional effects of covalent modification by MTSET+ and MTSES−were similar suggesting the functional effects were due to steric factors rather than to electrostatic effects on permeating ions. In contrast, at two positions, α1L276C and α1A280C, the effect of modification was due to electrostatic interactions rather than steric effects possibly due to proximity with α1Arg-273. The implications of these results for the structure of this region and its role in signal transduction are considered. The cDNAs encoding the rat GABAA α1, β1, and γ2S subunits in the pGEMHE vector were used (30Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). To ensure that the sulfhydryl reagents only reacted with the engineered Cys all of the endogenous Cys in membrane-spanning segments were mutated to other amino acids. Thus, “wild type” subunits had the following mutations: α1 C233S and C292S; β1C288S; and γ2S C244S, C303A, and C413A. Hereafter, these “Cys-minus” constructs will be referred to as wild type. The α1 Cys-minus construct was used as the background for the M2–M3 loop mutations from α1S275C to α1I289C. Mutations were generated by PCR and confirmed by DNA sequencing (31Horenstein J. Akabas M.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 870-877PubMed Google Scholar). The α1 wild type and all α1 Cys mutants except α1R273C, α1N274C, and α1S275C contained the FLAG epitope tag sequence inserted between residues 4 and 5 in the mature protein sequence. The β1 subunit was tagged with the myc epitope sequence at the same site as described previously (14Horenstein J. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Akabas M.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Insertion of these epitope tags had no functional effect (32Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). α1R273C and α1N274C were in the wild type, endogenous-Cys-containing background. The M2 segment residues from α1E249 to α1N274 and the M3 segment residues from α1A290 to α1V306 were studied previously (13Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 33Williams D.B. Akabas M.H. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2563-2574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The 5′-capped cRNAs were made using standard procedures (14Horenstein J. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Akabas M.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 50 nl of RNA (200 pg/nl) mixed in an equal ratio of α1:β1:γ2. After injection, oocytes were incubated at 16–17 °C for 2–3 days in OR3 solution before use in electrophysiological experiments (14Horenstein J. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Akabas M.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Residues in the M2 segment are referred to by an indexing number system that numbers a conserved positively charged amino acid, aligned with GABAA receptor α1Arg-254, at the cytoplasmic end of M2 as the 0′ position and the residues (α1Asn-274) aligned with the ACh receptor extracellular ring of charge (34Imoto K. Busch C. Sakmann B. Mishina M. Konno T. Nakai J. Bujo H. Mori Y. Fukuda K. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 335: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) at the extracellular end of M2 as the 20′ position (35Miller C. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1195-1205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Two electrode voltage clamp experiments were performed at room temperature as described previously (13Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Holding potential was −60 mV. The oocyte was continuously perfused at 6 ml/min with calcium-free frog Ringer (CFFR), containing 115 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mmMgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). To determine the GABA EC50 concentration for wild type and the Cys mutants, concentration-response curves were generated by recording the currents elicited by increasing concentrations of GABA (Fig. 2). The GABA-induced currents for each GABA concentration were normalized relative to the maximal currents (I max) and then plotted as a function of GABA concentration. The curves were fitted to the Hill equation, I/I max = ([c]n)/(EC50n + [c]n), where I max is the maximum GABA-induced current, [c] is the GABA concentration, EC50 is the GABA concentration that gives half-maximal current, and n is the Hill coefficient, using Sigma Plot 2000 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). We used the MTS derivatives MTSET+ and MTSES− (Biotium, Inc., Haywood, CA). They add –SCH2CH2 X onto the Cys where X is N(CH3) 3+ for MTSET+ and SO 3− for MTSES− (28Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A., Xu, M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Reaction of the MTS reagents with engineered Cys residues was assayed functionally by effects on GABA-induced currents. The effects of MTSET+ and MTSES− were studied using the following protocol: two 10- to 20-s pulses of submaximal GABA concentration (EC20-EC50), designated as test pulses, were applied. Next, 1 mm MTSET+ or 10 mmMTSES− ± near-saturating GABA concentration (5 times EC50) was applied for 1 min. This was followed by two submaximal GABA test pulses. All applications were separated by 3- to 5-min washes with CFFR to allow complete recovery from desensitization. GABA-induced currents were stable before and after application of the sulfhydryl reagents. Experiments in which the peak currents of the two GABA test responses were not within 5% were discarded. The percentage effects of the sulfhydryl-specific reagents were calculated using the following equation: [(I final/I initial) − 1] × 100. I final designates the average peak current of the two test pulses after MTS reagent application, and I initial is the average peak current of the two initial GABA test pulses. To avoid MTS reagent hydrolysis, 100 mm stocks were made in distilled water each day, kept on ice, and diluted into CFFR immediately before use (29Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. of at least three observations. All experiments were performed in at least two separate batches of oocytes from different frogs. Statistical significance of effects was determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the Dunnett post hoc test with wild type as control. p < 0.05 was considered significant. It is important to recognize that MTS-reactive residues were identified based on functional effects of modification. Functional effects were determined by the statistical significance of the effect on a mutant relative to the effect on wild type. For some mutants the average effect following MTS reagent application was small. Whether such an effect was statistically significant depended, in part, on the stringency of the one-way ANOVA post hoc test used. For example, in our previous work on the α1 M3 segment, using the Student-Newman-Kuels post hoc test to determine significance, the effect of pCMBS− applied in the presence of GABA was significant at six residues: α1A290C, α1Y293C, α1F297C, α1A299C, α1L300C, and α1E302C. With the less stringent Duncan post hoc test, an additional residue α1F295C was judged to be reactive with pCMBS− applied in the presence of GABA (33Williams D.B. Akabas M.H. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2563-2574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The choice of post hoc test is, unfortunately, somewhat arbitrary. Thus, for Cys mutants where the effects of complete reaction are small, it may be difficult to determine whether reaction has occurred. For screening experiments 1 mm MTSET+ was applied for 1 min. This combination of time and concentration limits our ability to detect reactive residues. For a given mutant, based on the variability of responses, application of a reagent must cause a net change in current greater than ∼30% to be statistically significantly different than wild type by a one-way ANOVA (forn between 3 and 6). Thus, if complete reaction caused 100% inhibition of the GABA-induced current, with a detection threshold of 30% effect and the MTSET+ reaction conditions of 1 mm applied for 1 min, the slowest reaction rate that we can detect must have a second order reaction rate constant of >6 liters/mol-s. To place this in context, the second order rate constant for MTSET+ reaction with 2-mercaptoethanol in solution at pH 7.0 is 2.1 × 105 liters/mol-s (29Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The reaction rate of MTS reagents with engineered Cys were determined by the method described previously (36Williams D.B. Akabas M.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A test pulse of GABA was applied to monitor the GABA-induced current. MTS reagents (1 μm to 1 mm) were applied with or without GABA for 10–60 s. The MTS reagent concentration was constant during an experiment and in vast molar excess to the number of Cys on the oocyte surface. After washing for 3–5 min, a second test pulse of GABA was applied and the peak current was measured. The brief pulses of reagent alternating with GABA test pulses continued until the reaction saturated, as observed by the plateau of the GABA test-pulse current magnitude. The magnitude of GABA-induced, test-pulse currents was normalized, relative to the current induced by GABA test pulses before exposure to the MTS reagents. The normalized currents were plotted as a function of cumulative exposure time to the MTS reagents. Using Prism 3 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) the curves were fitted with single- or double-exponential equations. The F-test was used to determine whether the double-exponential fit was significantly better than the single-exponential fit. In all cases, except α1A280C in the presence of GABA, the best fit was obtained with a single-exponential function. The pseudo-first-order rate constant, obtained from the exponential fit, was divided by the molar concentration of MTS reagents to give the second order reaction rate constant. At most positions the pseudo-first order reaction rates were determined using at least two different concentrations of MTS reagent. Similar second order rates were obtained in all cases consistent with the reaction being a simple bimolecular reaction. Oocytes expressing each of the Cys substitution mutants displayed GABA-evoked currents. This indicated that the mutations were tolerated and yielded functional channels. The GABA EC50 values for the wild type and the mutants were determined (TableI and Fig.2). Five mutants, α1L276C, α1P277C, α1K278C, α1D286C, and α1F288C, had statistically significant increases in GABA EC50 (Table I). The Hill coefficient for wild type was 1.5, whereas for the mutants it ranged from 0.9 to 1.7. For wild type the average maximal current (I max) was −4034 ± 359 nA (n = 28) at a holding potential of −60 mV. The I max for the mutants ranged from −206 ± 41 nA (α1D286C) to −3496 ± 236 nA (α1I289C) (Table I). For three mutants, α1A282C, α1D286C, and α1F288C, I max was only 5–8% of the wild type I max. The currents, however, were sufficiently large for our experiments.Table IGABA EC50 of M2–M3 loop cysteine substitution mutantsMutantnEC50Hill coefficientI maxμmnAWT510 ± 2aMean ± S.E.1.5 ± 0.2aMean ± S.E.4034 ± 359R273C312 ± 10.9 ± 0.12621 ± 302N274C35 ± 0.21.0 ± 0.13397 ± 423S275C33 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.12639 ± 146L276C3138 ± 12bStatistically significantly different from WT by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post hoc test.1.7 ± 0.21190 ± 428P277C4143 ± 17bStatistically significantly different from WT by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post hoc test.1.3 ± 0.51026 ± 112K278C651 ± 13bStatistically significantly different from WT by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post hoc test.1.2 ± 0.12745 ± 134V279C320 ± 51.0 ± 0.12633 ± 149A280C48 ± 21.4 ± 0.22932 ± 509Y281C39 ± 21.0 ± 0.22919 ± 216A282C342 ± 31.5 ± 0.6292 ± 43T283C524 ± 41.2 ± 0.12470 ± 227A284C512 ± 11.6 ± 0.32403 ± 417M285C313 ± 1.51.3 ± 0.12597 ± 241D286C477 ± 17bStatistically significantly different from WT by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post hoc test.1.0 ± 0.1206 ± 41W287C83 ± 0.51.2 ± 0.12699 ± 139F288C465 ± 3bStatistically significantly different from WT by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post hoc test.1.0 ± 0.1257 ± 21I289C337 ± 81.4 ± 0.13496 ± 239a Mean ± S.E.b Statistically significantly different from WT by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post hoc test. Open table in a new tab We studied the sensitivity to MTSET+ of wild type and Cys substitution mutants both in the absence and in the presence of GABA. In the absence of GABA, the channels are in the closed state most of the time. Application of 1 mm MTSET+ for 1 min irreversibly potentiated the GABA test pulse current amplitude for the mutants α1R273C, α1N274C, α1S275C, α1L276C, α1V279C, and α1A284C (Figs. 3 and4 A). The GABA-induced currents of the mutant α1Y281C were significantly reduced after exposure to MTSET+ (Fig. 4 A). MTSET+application to wild type receptors and the other Cys mutants caused no functional effects (Fig. 4 A). At α1L276C the GABA-induced currents following MTSET+ treatment in the absence of GABA were potentiated by 24%, however, this was not statistically significant.Figure 4The average effect of a 1-min application of 1 mm MTSET+ applied in the absence (A) and in the presence (B) of near-saturating GABA on wild type and the M2–M3 loop Cys mutants. Gray bars indicate effects that are significantly different than the effect on wild type by a one-way ANOVA. Negative effect indicates inhibition and positive effect indicates potentiation of subsequent ∼EC50 GABA-induced currents. At most reactive positions the subsequent currents were altered following application in the absence and presence of GABA, but at two positions subsequent currents were only affected following MTSET+ application in the presence (α1L276C) and in the absence (α1K278C) of GABA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In the presence of GABA the channels undergo transitions between the open, desensitized, and closed states. Application of 1 mmMTSET+ in the presence of GABA irreversibly potentiated the subsequent GABA test currents for the mutants α1R273C, α1N274C, α1S275C, α1K278C, α1V279C, and α1A284C (Fig. 4 B). The subsequent GABA test currents were irreversibly inhibited for the mutant α1Y281C (Fig. 4 B). The mutant α1K278C showed 56% potentiation of subsequent GABA-induced currents when modified in a closed state (Fig.3 C) but did not show any effect when treated for 1 min with 1 mm MTSET+ + GABA (Figs. 3 C,3 D, and 4). To determine whether MTSET+ reacted silently with α1K278C in the presence of GABA, we applied MTSET+ twice, first in the presence of GABA and then in the absence of GABA to the same oocytes (Fig. 3 D). The ability of MTSET+ to potentiate the subsequent GABA currents was eliminated by pretreatment with MTSET+ + GABA. This inhibitory effect of pretreatment with MTSET+ + GABA was reversed by application of 10 mm dithiothreitol between the MTSET+ applications (Fig. 3 E). This implies that, when applied in the presence of GABA, MTSET+covalently modified α1K278C in a functionally silent manner. However, when applied in the absence of GABA, MTSET+ modification altered subsequent channel function. The potentiation of GABA-induced currents by MTSET+treatment in the closed state was not reversed by subsequent co-application of GABA + MTSET+ (data not shown). These experiments imply that the cysteines in both α subunits were reacting in both conditions. A similar phenomenon was observed with the mutant α1L276C. Modification by 1 mmMTSET+ in the presence of GABA potentiated the subsequent GABA test pulses by 62% (Fig. 4). Application of 1 mmMTSET+ in the absence of GABA did not have a statistically significant effect on the subsequent GABA-induced currents (Fig.4 A). Nevertheless, MTSET+ reacted in the absence of GABA with the engineered Cys in α1L276C, because it inhibited the ability of a subsequent application of MTSET+in the presence of GABA to potentiate GABA-induced currents (data not shown). In our original SCAM analysis we reported that application of the MTS reagents had no functional effect on α1R273C (13Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In those experiments we used only saturating concentrations of GABA for the test pulse"
https://openalex.org/W2060134079,"Axin is a multifunctional protein, regulating Wnt signaling and the c-Jun N-terminal/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) pathway as well as tumorigenesis. In the present study, we found that Axin interacts with three SUMO-1 (small ubiquitin-related modifier) conjugating enzymes 3 (E3), PIAS1, PIASxbeta, and PIASy. The extreme C-terminal six amino acid residues of Axin are critical for the Axin/E3 interaction as deletion of the six residues (AxinDeltaC6) completely abolished the ability of Axin to interact with E3 enzymes. AxinDeltaC6 also failed to activate JNK, although it was intact in both its interaction with MEKK1 and homodimerization. Consistent with the presence of a doublet of the KV(E/D) sumoylation consensus motif at the C-terminal end (KVEKVD), we found that Axin is heavily sumoylated. Deletion of the C-terminal six amino acids drastically reduced sumoylation, indicating that the C-terminal six amino acids stretch is the main sumoylation site for Axin. Sumoylation-defective mutants failed to activate JNK but effectively destabilized beta-catenin and attenuated LEF1 transcriptional activity. In addition, we show that dominant negative Axin mutants blocked PIAS-mediated JNK activation, in accordance with the requirement of sumoylation for Axin-mediated JNK activation. Taken together, we demonstrate that sumoylation plays a role for Axin to function in the JNK pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2120657906,"Previous studies have shown that nuclear levels of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) are dynamically regulated and may affect access of GSK-3 to its substrates. In this study we show that the GSK-3-binding protein Frat/GBP regulates the nuclear export of GSK-3. We show that Frat/GBP contains a nuclear export sequence that promotes its own nuclear export and that of associated GSK-3. Treating cells with leptomycin B increased nuclear levels of endogenous GSK-3 suggesting that an endogenous process targets GSK-3 for nuclear export. To investigate this further, we used two approaches to disrupt the interaction between GSK-3 and endogenous Frat. First we isolated mutants of GSK-3 that selectively interfered with Frat binding and found that these mutants were poorly exported. Second we expressed a peptide that competes with Frat for GSK-3 binding and found that it caused endogenous GSK-3 to accumulate in the nucleus. Together these data suggest that Frat may be the endogenous factor that targets GSK-3 for nuclear export. The dynamic expression patterns of Frat mRNAs together with the role of Frat in mediating GSK-3 nuclear export have important implications for the control of the substrate access of GSK-3 in several signaling pathways.

Regulation of GSK-3 is primarily achieved through the inhibition of its activity in response to multiple signaling pathways, including the Wnt and insulin pathways (2Woodgett J.R. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/100/re12)PubMed Google Scholar). In the Wnt pathway, GSK-3 phosphorylates β-catenin as part of a multiprotein complex containing the binding proteins Axin and APC (adenomatous polyposis coli), which targets β-catenin for degradation. Activation of the Wnt pathway, which involves proteins of the Dishevelled (Dsh) family, inhibits β-catenin phosphorylation and consequently allows it to accumulate and act as a co-transcription factor (3Peifer M. Polakis P. Science. 2000; 287: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Deregulation of the Wnt pathway has been implicated in several human cancers. Alteration of GSK-3 function has also been implicated in diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and clinical depression (4Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar).Recent studies have indicated that GSK-3 localization is dynamically regulated. Although GSK-3 is found predominantly in the cytoplasm of most cells, it has been found to enter the nucleus during S phase of the cell cycle and during apoptosis (5Bijur G.N., De Sarno P. Jope R.S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 28586-28597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Significantly, GSK-3 nuclear accumulation correlates with increased phosphorylation of nuclear substrates. For example, the increased levels of nuclear GSK-3 in S phase result in the increased phosphorylation of cyclin D1 (6Alt J.R. Cleveland J.L. Hannink M. Diehl J.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3102-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The nuclear accumulation of GSK-3 during apoptosis suggests that the phosphorylation of other substrates may be involved in apoptotic signaling. This is supported by evidence indicating that GSK-3 inhibition promotes cell survival, whereas increased GSK-3 activity potentiates apoptosis (5Bijur G.N., De Sarno P. Jope R.S. J. Biol.

Phosphorylation of cyclin D1, GATA-4, Dd-STATa (Dictyostelium STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) protein), TIMELESS, and NF-ATc (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) by GSK-3 alters their nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution (6Alt J.R.

https://openalex.org/W1972242729,"In metazoans, CBL proteins are RING finger type ubiquitin-protein isopeptide (E3) ligases involved in the down-regulation of epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase receptors (EGFR). Among the three CBL proteins described in humans, CBLC (CBL3) remains poorly studied. By screening in parallel a human and a Caenorhabditis elegans library using the two-hybrid procedure in yeast, we found a novel interaction between Hsa-CBLC and Hsa-AIP4 or its C. elegans counterpart Cel-WWP1. Hsa-AIP4 and Cel-WWP1 are also ubiquitin E3 ligases. They contain a HECT (homologous to E6-AP C terminus) catalytic domain and four WW domains known to bind proline-rich regions. We confirmed the interaction between Hsa-CBLC and Hsa-AIP4 by a combination of glutathione S-transferase pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation, and colocalization experiments. We show that these two E3 ligases are involved in EGFR signaling because both become phosphorylated on tyrosine following epidermal growth factor stimulation. In addition, we observed that CBLC increases the ubiquitination of EGFR, and that coexpressing the WW domains of AIP4 exerts a dominant negative effect on EGFR ubiquitination. Finally, coexpressing CBLC and AIP4 induces a down-regulation of EGFR signaling. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that two E3 ligases of different classes can interact and cooperate to down-regulate EGFR signaling."

Here we have determined the membrane topology of Pex16p by differential permeabilization method: both N- and C-terminal parts are exposed to the cytosol. In the search for Pex16p topogenic sequence, basic amino acids clustered sequence, RKELRKKLPVSLSQQK, at positions 66–81 and the first transmembrane segment locating far downstream, nearly by 40 amino acids, of this basic region were defined to be essential for integration into peroxisome membranes. Localization to peroxisomes of membrane proteins such as Pex14p, Pex13p, and PMP70 was interfered with in CHO-K1 cells by a higher level expression of thepex16 patient-derived dysfunctional but topogenically active Pex16pR176ter comprising resides 1–176 or of the C-terminal cytoplasmic part starting from residues at 244 to the C terminus. Furthermore, Pex16p C-terminal cytoplasmic part severely abrogated peroxisome restoration in pex mutants such as matrix protein import-defective pex12 and membrane assembly impaired pex3 by respective PEX12 andPEX3 expression, whereas the N-terminal cytosolic region did not affect restoration. These results imply that Pex16p functions in peroxisome membrane assembly, more likely upstream of Pex3p.

Most organellar proteins are synthesized on cytoplasmic polyribosomes and are then directed to their destined compartments in either a post-translational or co-translational manner. The peroxisome is a model system for addressing protein traffic and membrane biogenesis, especially where it is linked to human neurological and metabolic diseases, called peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBD). 1The abbreviations used are: PBD, peroxisome biogenesis disorders; AOx, acyl-CoA oxidase; CG, complementation group; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, influenza virus hemagglutinin; mPTS, peroxisome targeting signal for membrane protein; PMP47, 47-kDa peroxisomal integral membrane protein; PMP34, 34-kDa PMP; PMP22, 22-kDa PMP; PMP70, 70-kDa PMP; PNS, postnuclear supernatant; PTS, peroxisome targeting signal; thiolase, peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase; TM, transmembrane segment; ER, endoplasmic reticulum Peroxisomal matrix and membrane proteins are also synthesized on free polyribosomes and post-translationally imported into peroxisomes (1Lazarow P.B.

Genetic analyses of peroxisome-deficient mutants isolated from yeast and mammalian cells have led to the identification of a number of proteins, known as “peroxins,” which are essential for peroxisome biogenesis (4Distel B.

Peroxisome biogenesis consists of two major distinct steps. The membrane-assembly step is initiated by at least three peroxins, Pex3p, Pex16p, and Pex19p. The following step is for the matrix protein import, growth, and division of the assembled peroxisomes (5Fujiki Y. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 6Subramani S.

The sequence relatively enriched in positively charged amino acid residues and transmembrane segment(s) is mostly required for translocation of integral membrane proteins to peroxisomes, although any consensus sequence for mPTS has not been delineated. In the present study, we have investigated biogenesis and a functional role of human Pex16p essential for peroxisome membrane biogenesis in order to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in peroxisome biogenesis, more specifically peroxisomal membrane assembly. First, we determined membrane topology of Pex16p; both N- and C-terminal parts face the cytosol. For Pex16p membrane targeting a cluster of positively charged amino acid residues at 66–81 and the first transmembrane segment (TM1) was found to be required. The cytoplasmically oriented C-terminal part of Pex16p was likely to play a role in an early stage of peroxisome assembly. Restriction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from Nippon Gene (Tokyo, Japan) and Takara (Kyoto, Japan). Fetal calf serum and Ham's F-12 were from Invitrogen.

Flag-PEX16-HA was constructed as follows. PCR was done using a forward FLAG16, a reverse 140R, and pCMVPEX16 (33Honsho M. Tamura S. Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Am. J. Hum.

The NotI-MscI fragment was ligated into the NotI-SalI site in pUcD2Hyg, together with MscI-SalI fragment ofPEX16-HA. Subcellular fractionation of cells was done as described previously (25Otera H.

Isopycnic ultracentrifugation was done as described previously (25Otera H. Harano T. Honsho M. Ghaedi K. Mukai S. Tanaka A. Kawai A. Shimizu N. Fujiki Y. J. Biol.

Western blot analysis was performed using electrophoretically transferred samples on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), with primary antibodies and a second antibody, donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized with ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Protein assay was conducted using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). We determined the transmembrane topology of human Pex16p in peroxisomal membranes by the differential cell-permeabilization method, using CHO-K1 cells transfected withFlag-PEX16-HA encoding N- and C-terminally epitope-tagged Pex16p, where detection of Pex16p was done using antibodies to epitope tags. Flag-PEX16-HA was biologically active when expressed in fibroblasts from a CG9 pex16 patient (PBDD-01) with Zellweger syndrome (33Honsho M. Tamura S. Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 1622-1630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), indicating that the epitope tagging did not affect the Pex16p function (data not shown). When the CHO-K1 cells expressing FLAG-Pex16p-HA were treated with 1% Triton X-100 which solubilized all cellular membranes, both FLAG-Pex16p-HA and PTS1 proteins were detected in particulates, in a superimposable manner (Fig. 1, a and c), thereby indicating localization of Pex16p in peroxisomes. Next, FLAG-Pex16p-HA-transfected CHO-K1 cells were permeabilized with 25 μg/ml of digitonin, under which conditions only plasma membranes were selectively permeabilized and intra-peroxisomal proteins were inaccessible to exogenous antibodies (29Okumoto K. Shimozawa N. Kawai A. Tamura S. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. Moser H. Wanders R.J.A. Suzuki Y. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4324-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). FLAG-Pex16p-HA was observed in a punctate staining pattern with anti-FLAG antibody, whereas almost no staining of cells was noted using anti-PTS1 antibody (Fig. 1,b and d). Similar punctate staining was discernible using an anti-HA antibody after both types of treatments (Fig. 1, e and f). Together, the data strongly suggested that both N- and C-terminal parts of Pex16p are exposed to the cytosol. When the full-length human Flag-PEX16 was expressed in CHO-K1 cells, Pex16p was detected as a punctate staining pattern using anti-FLAG antibody (Fig.2 B, a). The staining pattern was superimposable with PTS1-positive particles (Fig.2 B, b), thereby indicating that FLAG-Pex16p was transported to peroxisomes, consistent with the results described above (Fig. 1). Flag-PEX16 expression restored peroxisome assembly in CG9 pex16 PBD patient-derived fibroblasts (Fig.2 B, c). To search for mPTS of Pex16p, we constructed various mutants, such as those with deletion either from the C or N terminus, internal truncation, as well as fusion to GFP (Fig. 2 A). Several deletion mutants lacking the C-terminal portion were verified for peroxisomal targeting in CHO-K1 as well as peroxisome-restoring activity in pex16 fibroblasts.FlagC315Ter encoding FLAG-Pex16pΔ316–336 truncated in the sequence from residues at 316 to the C terminus was expressed in CHO-K1. Numerous Pex16p-positive particles were visible in a manner superimposed with those stained using anti-Pex14pC antibody (Fig.2 B, d and e), hence demonstrating localization of Pex16pΔ315–336 to peroxisomes. However, nearly none of peroxisomes were re-established inFlagC315Ter-transfected pex16 fibroblasts (Fig.2 B, f), indicating that deletion of ∼20 amino acids from the C terminus severely affected the Pex16p function. Very recently, two PEX16-defective unrelated patients with Zellweger syndrome have been identified, both carrying a homozygote allele encoding Pex16p changed in the sequence of residues at 298–336 (35Shimozawa N. Nagase T. Takemoto Y. Suzuki Y. Fujiki Y. Wanders R.J.A. Kondo N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Two deletion mutants, FlagC298Ter coding for FLAG-Pex16pΔ299–336 and FlagC244Ter for FLAG-Pex16pΔ245–336 lacking the entire sequence downstream of the second transmembrane domain, respectively, were likewise determined for intracellular location. Both mutants were localized to peroxisomes in CHO-K1, as assessed by co-localization with Pex14p (Fig. 2 B,g, h, j, and k). Peroxisomes were not detectable in FlagC298Ter- andFlagC244Ter-transfected pex16 fibroblasts (Fig.2 B, i and l). Together, the C-terminal cytoplasmically exposed portion is also essential for the function but is not required for the peroxisomal localization of Pex16p. We earlier reported that a CG9 pex16 patient (PBDD-01) was a homozygote for PEX16 with a nonsense point mutation in a codon for Arg176 (33Honsho M. Tamura S. Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 1622-1630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). PEX16R176ter-HAexpression did not restore peroxisome assembly in CG9 pex16patient's fibroblasts (Fig. 2 B, o), consistent with our earlier results (33Honsho M. Tamura S. Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 1622-1630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). When PEX16R176ter-HA was likewise transfected into K1/22GFP cells, CHO-K1 stably expressing PMP22-GFP, Pex16pR176ter-HA was detected as puncta using anti-Pex16pN antibody (Fig. 2 B, m), in a superimposable manner with PMP22-GFP-positive particles (Fig.2 B, n), thereby demonstrating that Pex16pR176ter-HA was translocated to peroxisomes. These results strongly suggested that mPTS, if any, of Pex16p resides in the N-terminal part. Next, to verify the TM1 requirement for peroxisomal localization, we constructed several PEX16 variants encoding C-terminally GFP-"
https://openalex.org/W2061051242,"We have previously demonstrated intracellular degradation of the heparan sulfate side chains in recycling glypican-1 by heparanase and by deaminative cleavage atN-unsubstituted glucosamine with nitric oxide derived from intrinsic nitrosothiols (see Ding, K., Mani, K., Cheng, F., Belting, M. and Fransson, L.-Å. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 33353–33360). To determine where and in what order events take place, we have visualized, by using confocal laser-scanning immunofluorescence microscopy, glypican-1 variants in unperturbed cells or arrested at various stages of processing. In unperturbed proliferating cells, glypican-1 was partly S-nitrosylated. Intracellular glypican-1 was enriched in endosomes, colocalized significantly with GM-1 ganglioside, caveolin-1, and Rab9-positive endosomes, and carried side chains rich in N-unsubstituted glucosamine residues. However, such residues were scarce in cell surface glypican-1. Brefeldin A-arrested glypican-1, which was non-S-nitrosylated and carried side chains rich inN-unsubstituted glucosamines, colocalized extensively with caveolin-1 but not with Rab9. Suramin, which inhibits heparanase, induced the appearance of S-nitrosylated glypican-1 in caveolin-1-rich compartments. Inhibition of deaminative cleavage did not prevent heparanase from generating heparan sulfate oligosaccharides that colocalized strongly with caveolin-1. Growth-quiescent cells displayed extensive NO-dependent deaminative cleavage of heparan sulfate-generating anhydromannose-terminating fragments that were partly associated with acidic vesicles. Proliferating cells generated such fragments during polyamine uptake. We conclude that recycling glypican-1 that is associated with caveolin-1-containing endosomes undergoes sequentialN-desulfation/N-deacetylation, heparanase cleavage, S-nitrosylation, NO release, and deaminative cleavage of its side chains in conjunction with polyamine uptake. We have previously demonstrated intracellular degradation of the heparan sulfate side chains in recycling glypican-1 by heparanase and by deaminative cleavage atN-unsubstituted glucosamine with nitric oxide derived from intrinsic nitrosothiols (see Ding, K., Mani, K., Cheng, F., Belting, M. and Fransson, L.-Å.

These PG, like other cell surface PG, are selective regulators of ligand-receptor encounters and thereby control growth and development (1Lander A.D. Selleck S.B. J.

Gpc proteins are post-translationally modified by the addition of the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate (HS) at sites located close to the C-terminal GPI-membrane anchor (see Scheme FS1). The central part of the protein consists of a cysteine-rich domain containing information that ensures a high level of HS substitution (5Chen R.L. Lander A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7507-7517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Many of the functions of Gpc are dependent on the HS side chains, which are capable of binding and/or activating and/or transporting a variety of growth factors, cytokines, enzymes, viral proteins, and polyamines (6Belting M.

Such enriched domains may exist either as small phase-separated “rafts” or, when associated with caveolin-1 (Cav-1), form flask-shaped plasmalemmal invaginations called caveolae, which are involved in signal transduction and special forms of non-clathrin-dependent endocytosis mediated by Cav-1-containing endosomes, also called caveosomes (12Drab M.

Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). During recycling, the HS side chains are degraded both by heparanase and by NO-dependent deaminative cleavage at N-unsubstituted glucosamine residues (GlcNH 3+) (20Ding K. Jönsson M. Mani K.

New HS chains can then be synthesized on the stubs remaining on the core protein (see SchemeFS1). Biosynthesis of HS takes place in the Golgi and involves many interacting enzymes (21Lindahl U.

The GlcNH 3+ residues are either a result of inadequate sulfation during the regional exchange ofN-acetyl for N-sulfate, or they are formed when synthesis is completed, by N-desulfation or furtherN-deacetylation. Cells with up-regulated polyamine uptake synthesize Gpc-1 that carries HS chains with an increased number of GlcNH 3+ residues (23Ding K. Sandgren S. Mani K. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46779-46791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). NO depletion, which precludes cleavage at these residues, results in diminished uptake, suggesting a functional relationship (23Ding K. Sandgren S. Mani K. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol.

More recently, we have identified and isolated S-nitrosylated (SNO) forms of Gpc-1 and demonstrated that NO released from these SNO groups cleaves the HS chains in an autocatalytic process that involves a Cu2+/Cu+ redox cycle (24Ding K.

After the various treatments, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times and then fixed and permeabilized by treatments with acetone for 2–4 min followed by incubation with 1 ml of 2% (v/v) H2O2 in 60% (v/v) methanol for 15 min.N-Acetylations were carried out by adding acetic anhydride (1:10, v/v) to the methanol solution. After washing with water three times for 1 min each, cells were incubated with nonimmune serum (1:100 dilution) for 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies were applied as described by the manufacturers and kept for 3 h; cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and exposed to secondary antibodies (1:500 dilution) for 2 h.

Edgren G. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) to detect all forms of Gpc-1 (i.e. with or without SNO groups, with or without HS; see Scheme FS2). Two HS-specific monoclonal antibodies were tested, one of which (JM-403) (29van den Born J. Gunnarsson K. Bakker M.A.H. Kjellén L. Kusche-Gullberg M. Maccarana M. Berden J.H.M. Lindahl U. J. Biol.

The HS epitope of the other monoclonal (10E4) has been proposed to comprise the sequence HexUA-GlcNH 3+-HexUA-GlcNAc (32Leteux C. Chai W. Nagai K. Herbert C.G. Lawson A.M. Feizi T. J. Biol.

As expected, the reactivity of the Gpc-1 protein was unaffected (Fig. 1 A, GPC + N-Ac;cf. Fig. 1 B, GPC). Unexpectedly, the 10E4 HS-epitope was also unaffected by N-acetylation (Fig.1 A, 10E4 + N-Ac), indicating that GlcNH 3+ was tolerated but not necessary for the antigenicity of 10E4. Therefore, in the present study, we have used JM-403 to trace GlcNH 3+ (see SchemeFS2).Figure 1Monoclonal antibody JM-403 but not 10E4 is specific for HS containing GlcNH 3+ , monoclonal antibody S1 recognizes S-nitrosylated Gpc-1 , andS-nitrosylated Gpc-1 containing HS with GlcNH 3+ residues localize to perinuclear areas. A, confocal laser immunofluorescence staining for Gpc-1 (GPC) and HS (using either JM-403 or 10E4) afterN-acetylation with acetic anhydride, showing thatN-acetylation does not affect detection of Gpc-1 protein (GPC + N-Ac) but destroys the GlcNH 3+-specific epitope (JM-403 + N-Ac), whereas the 10E4 epitope is not affected by N-acetylation and thus is not specific for GlcNH 3+ (10E4 +N-Ac). B, corresponding immunofluorescence staining for Gpc-1 using both polyclonal antiserum (GPC) and monoclonal S1 (GPC-S1) showing substantial colocalization (Merged). C, corresponding immunofluorescence staining for Gpc-1 in cells treated with ascorbate or ascorbate followed by NO donor (sodium nitroprusside (SNP)) and Cu2+ showing that reduction with ascorbate does not affect detection of Gpc-1 protein (GPC +Ascorbate) but destroys the S1 epitope (GPC-S1 +Ascorbate). The S1 epitope can be partly recovered by the addition of NO donor and Cu2+ (GPC-S1 +Ascorbate + SNP + CuCl 2).D, corresponding immunofluorescence staining forS-nitrosylated cysteines (SNO-Cys) in the absence or presence of ascorbate and after recovery from ascorbate treatment in the presence of NO donor and Cu2+, showing that ascorbate likewise destroys S-nitrosylated cysteine epitopes (SNO-Cys + Ascorbate), which can subsequently be restored (SNO-Cys + Ascorbate + SNP +CuCl 2). Recovery after ascorbate treatment but without added NO donor and Cu2+ resulted in a weak signal (as in the middle panel; data not shown).E, immunofluorescence staining for S-nitrosylated Gpc-1 using monoclonal S1 (GPC-S1) and polyclonal anti-S-nitrosocysteine (SNO-Cys), showing perinuclear colocalization (Merged).

Bars, 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The Gpc-1 core protein epitope recognized by the much used S1 monoclonal antibody has been reported to be sensitive to reduction with thiols (28de Boeck H. Lories V. David G. Cassiman J.-J. van den Berghe H. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This has been assumed to indicate that the S1 epitope is located in the cysteine-rich and potentially disulfide-rich central domain of Gpc-1 and that reduction of disulfide bonds with thiols would destroy the epitope. However, immunolocalization of the S1 epitope and total Gpc-1 (Fig. 1 B) suggested that S1 reacted with a subpopulation of the Gpc-1 molecules (yellow inMerged panel). It is known that reduction with thiols also releases NO from SNO groups (33Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Temps P. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). Hence, the S1 epitope may comprise SNO. Ascorbate can be used to release NO from SNO groups without cleaving disulfide bonds (33Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Temps P. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether the S1 epitope was sensitive to ascorbate. As shown in Fig. 1 C, detection of total Gpc-1 protein was unaffected by ascorbate (GPC + Ascorbate), whereas the S1 epitope was destroyed (GPC-S1 + Ascorbate). Re-S-nitrosylation with NO is dependent on a Cu2+/Cu+ redox cycle (34Stubauer G. Giuffrè A. Sarti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28128-28133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Accordingly, when NO donor and Cu2+ were provided after ascorbate treatment, the S1 epitope was partially restored (GPC-S1 +Ascorbate + SNP + CuCl 2). Corresponding results were obtained by using a polyclonal antiserum against SNO groups (Fig. 1 D). Again, ascorbate reduced the signal (cf. SNO-Cys and SNO-Cys +Ascorbate), which could then be restored by re-S-nitrosylation using exogenous NO (SNO-Cys +Ascorbate + SNP + CuCl 2). Endogenous production of NO was insufficient to restoreS-nitrosylation during the 1-h recovery period (results not shown). That S1 recognizes S-nitrosylated Gpc-1 was confirmed by a colocalization experiment using S1 and anti-SNO. The strongest colocalization was in the perinuclear region (Fig.1 E, Merged panel; see also SchemeFS2). Colocalization experiments using the GlcNH 3+-recognizing JM-403 monoclonal antibody and anti-SNO indicated that a major population of theS-nitrosylated Gpc-1 molecules carries HS with GlcNH 3+ residues (Fig. 1 F,yellow in Merged panel). This material was also present in compartments closely encircling the nucleus. GlcNH 3+-containing HS (JM-403 epitope) that was not associated with S-nitrosylated proteins appeared to be present in a few scattered vesicles (Fig. 1 F,green in Merged panel). These could either represent HS attached to non-S-nitrosylated Gpc-1 or HS-oligosaccharides (see further below) or HS attached to other core proteins. There was also separate SNO-positive material (Fig. 1 F, red in Merged panel) that should represent other S-nitrosylated proteins or peptides. Co-visualization of HS with GlcNH 3+residues (JM-403) and total Gpc-1 (GPC) confirmed that the glycoform carrying such HS chains was largely present in compartments encircling the nucleus (Fig. 1 G,yellow in Merged panel). Thus, a significant proportion of resident, intracellular Gpc-1 in subconfluent cells was both S-nitrosylated and carried HS rich in GlcNH 3+ residues (i.e.charged and ready for autocleavage of its HS chains) (24Ding K. Mani K. Cheng F. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33353-33360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, the cells should also contain nonglycanated Gpc-1 (see Fig.1 G, red) and HS-oligosaccharides (see Fig.1 G, green) at steady state (19Mani K. Jönsson M. Edgren G. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Since Gpc-1 is a GPI-anchored molecule, it may be associated with lipid rafts, caveolae, caveosomes, or endosomes transporting cargo from the plasma membrane to the Golgi. This may result in colocalization of Gpc-1 with Cav-1, Rab9, and GM1 ganglioside (14Pelkmans L. Kartenbeck J. Helenius A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 16Schlegel A. Lisanti M.P. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 35Barbero P.

Results of colocalization experiments indicated that Gpc-1 substituted with GlcNH 3+-containing HS chains (as in Fig.1 G) was partly associated with Cav-1 in vesicular structures diffusely encircling the nucleus (Fig.2 A). Using anti-Rab9 as a marker for late endosomes (35Barbero P. Bittova L. Pfeffer S.R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), strong scattered colocalization with Gpc-1 was seen in small vesicles surrounding the nucleus but also in larger vesicles located closer to the cell surface (Fig.2 B). Similarly, there was a marked colocalization between Rab9 and Cav-1 in the same area (Fig. 2 C). FITC-labeled cholera toxin B was used to detect GM1-ganglioside. Colocalization between GM1 and Gpc-1 was strong in the middle section of the cell (yellow in Fig. 2 D) and encircled the nucleus approximately in the same plane where Gpc-1 with GlcNH 3+-containing HS colocalized with Cav-1 (Fig. 2 A). Taken together, these results indicated that Gpc-1 carrying HS with GlcNH 3+residues is partly present in vesicles that share characteristics with caveosomes or transporting endosomes (14Pelkmans L. Kartenbeck J. Helenius A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 35Barbero P. Bittova L. Pfeffer S.R. J.

We also immunoisolated [35S]Gpc-1 from endosome preparations obtained from cells incubated with radiosulfate. We applied recently described procedures based on discontinuous sucrose density centrifugation of isotonic or hypotonic cell homogenates (31Kobayashi T. Beuchat M.-H. Chevallier J. Makino A.

Expressed as the proportion of total 35S-labeled macromolecules, there was a 5–15-fold enrichment of Gpc-1 in the endosomal fractions compared with total cellular Gpc-1. To identify the differently charged glycoforms of Gpc-1 (24Ding K. Mani K. Cheng F. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol.

The total cellular pool of Gpc-1 comprised almost equal proportions of the slightly negatively charged (i.e. relatively GlcNH 3+-rich) (24Ding K. Mani K. Cheng F. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol.

We have now investigated the signaling pathway that leads from mGluRs to casein kinase 1 (CK1) activation. In mouse neostriatal slices, the effect of DHPG on phosphorylation of Ser-137 or Thr-75 of DARPP-32 was blocked by the phospholipase Cβ inhibitor U73122, the Ca2+chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA/AM), and the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A. In neuroblastoma N2a cells, the effect of DHPG on the activity of transfected HA-tagged CK1ε was blocked by BAPTA/AM and cyclosporin A. In neostriatal slices, the effect of DHPG on Cdk5 activity was also abolished by BAPTA/AM and cyclosporin A, presumably through blocking activation of CK1. Metabolic labeling studies and phosphopeptide mapping revealed that a set of C-terminal sites in HA-CK1ε were transiently dephosphorylated in N2a cells upon treatment with DHPG, and this was blocked by cyclosporin A. A mutant CK1ε with a nonphosphorylatable C-terminal domain was not activated by DHPG. Together, these studies suggest that DHPG activates CK1ε via Ca2+-dependent stimulation of calcineurin and subsequent dephosphorylation of inhibitory C-terminal autophosphorylation sites.

There are at least seven mammalian CK1 isoforms (α, β, γ1, γ2, γ3, δ, and ε (1Gross S.D. Anderson R.A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 699-711Google Scholar, 2Vielhaber E. Virshup D.M.

An increasing number of potential physiologic substrates for CK1 isoforms have been identified. CK1α phosphorylates M1 and M3 muscarinic receptors and rhodopsin in an agonist-dependent manner (3Tobin A.B. Totty N.F. Sterlin A.E. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol.

CK1ε and CK1δ phosphorylate N-terminal residues of p53 in vitro and in vivo, and DNA-damaging drugs enhance this activity (4Budd D.C. McDonald J.E. Tobin A.B. J. Biol.

CK1 family members contain a highly related, central kinase domain that is flanked by N- and C-terminal extensions of variable length. The amino acid sequences of the C-terminal extensions are in general not highly related. However, the 124-amino acid C-terminal domain of mammalian CK1ε is 50% identical to that of CK1δ. Notably, severalin vitro studies have shown that the activities of CK1δ and CK1ε are regulated by autophosphorylation of their respective C-terminal domains (16Graves P.R. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21689-21694Google Scholar, 17Cegielska A. Gietzen K.F. Rivers A. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1357-1364Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of more than eight sites leads to inhibition of kinase activity. Moreover, it has been shown in vitro that treatment of CK1ε with several different serine/threonine phosphatases including PP1, PP2A, and PP2B (calcineurin) causes a marked increase in kinase activity (13Lowrey P.L.

Dephosphorylation of CK1δ and CK1γ isoforms by the catalytic subunit of PP1 has also been found in vitro to result in enzyme activation (16Graves P.R. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21689-21694Google Scholar). Recently, we have reported that both CK1 and Cdk5 are regulated by activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in neostriatal neurons (19Liu F. Ma X.H. Ule J. Bibb J.A. Nishi A. DeMaggio A.J. Yan Z. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11062-11068Google Scholar). DHPG, an agonist for group I mGluRs, increased CK1 and Cdk5 activities in neostriatal slices, leading to enhanced phosphorylation of Ser-137 and Thr-75 of DARPP-32, respectively. The effects of DHPG on both Ser-137 and Thr-75 were blocked by CK1–7 and IC261, specific inhibitors of CK1, suggesting that activation of Cdk5 by mGluRs required activation of CK1. In support of this possibility, the DHPG-induced increase in Cdk5 activity, subsequently measured in extracts of neostriatal slices, was abolished by treatment of slices with CK1–7 or IC261. Finally, treatment of acutely dissociated neurons with DHPG enhanced voltage-dependent Ca2+currents. This enhancement was eliminated by either CK1–7 or butyrolactone (an inhibitor of Cdk5), indicating that CK1 and Cdk5 may be involved in the regulation by mGluR agonists of Ca2+channels. In the present study, we have investigated the processes that lead from mGluRs to CK1 activation and the mechanism that underlies CK1 activation in response to group I mGluR agonists. The results obtained support a signal transduction pathway in which group I mGluRs increase intracellular Ca2+ and stimulate calcineurin to dephosphorylate autoinhibitory phosphorylation sites in CK1ε. Transient dephosphorylation and subsequent autophosphorylation of CK1ε leads to transient activation and inactivation, respectively, of the enzyme. Phosphospecific antibodies that recognize either phospho-Ser-137 DARPP-32 or phospho-Thr-75 DARPP-32 were developed as described (19Liu F. Ma X.H. Ule J. Bibb J.A. Nishi A. DeMaggio A.J. Yan Z.

The expression plasmids pCDP4HA-CKIε and pCS-Myc-MM2-CK1ε were prepared as described (18Gietzen K.F. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32063-32070Google Scholar). Anti-HA (12CA5) was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and anti-Myc (9E10) from Upstate Biotechnology. Anti-Cdk5 (C-8) and anti-CKIε were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.U73122, BAPTA/AM, and cyclosporin A were obtained from Calbiochem; (S)-3,5-DHPG, ZM241385, and L-AP3 were obtained from Tocris. Protease inhibitor mixture tablets were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Lambda protein phosphatase was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. Neostriatal slices were prepared from male C57/BL6 mice (6–8 weeks old) as described (21Nishi A. Snyder G.L. Greengard P. J Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8147-8155Google Scholar). Briefly, coronal (usually 3–4/mouse) slices (350 μm) were prepared using a vibratome. From each coronal slice, two neostriatal slices (left and right) were dissected. When slices were treated with drugs, one slice from a pair served as a control for the drug-treated slice. After drug treatment, slices were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until assayed. Frozen slices were sonicated in hot homogenization buffer containing 1% SDS and 50 mm NaF, and samples were boiled for 10 min. SDS-PAGE sample buffer was then added, and samples were boiled for 5 min. Samples (∼120 μg protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblots were first probed with anti-phospho-Ser-137 DARPP-32 antibody. The blots were stripped and probed with anti-phospho-Thr-75 DARPP-32 antibody. Blots were stripped again and probed with anti-total DARPP-32 antibody. Antibody binding was detected by enhance chemiluminescence (ECL) using x-ray film, and images were analyzed by laser scanning densitometry using NIH Image 1.52 software. Data were statistically analyzed by Student's t test in Microsoft Excel software as indicated. For each neostriatal slice sample, the level of phospho-Ser-137 or phospho-Thr-75 was normalized to the total level of DARPP-32. In every individual experiment (i.e. for each mouse brain), a control without drug and a control with DHPG were always included. Results from slices from a single mouse brain were normalized to the control slice without drug (arbitrarily set as 1). The figures show ECL blots that were obtained in some cases from different mouse brains and from different experiments. The cumulative data shown in the bar graphs were obtained from at least three independent experiments. Neuroblastoma N2a cells were cultured to 50–60% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Four μg of the expression plasmid for HA-CK1ε or Myc-MM2-CK1ε was transfected into N2a cells in 100-mm dishes using FuGENETM 6. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were incubated at room temperature in phosphate-buffered Krebs-Henseleit solution (Sigma) for 10 min and then with or without inhibitors for 30 min before treatment with (S)-3,5-DHPG for 2 min. Cells were then lysed in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mmNa3VO4, 20 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerol-phosphate, and protease inhibitors. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g, and supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation and kinase assay. For immunoprecipitation of CK1ε from N2a cells, lysates (1 mg of total protein) were precleared with 5 μl of mouse IgG (ICN) and 50 μl of protein A-agarose for 30 min. Five μl (∼2 μg) of anti-HA antibody was added, and samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Five μl of anti-mouse rabbit IgG and 50 μl of protein A-agarose were then added for 45 min. Immunocomplexes were washed three times in lysis buffer and two times in kinase buffer (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol). CK1 assays were performed in a 30-μl assay volume with 2 μg of purified DARPP-32, 500 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min, and reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide). SDS-polyacrylamide gels were dried and exposed to Kodak film for autoradiography. Results were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The amount of HA-CK1ε in each immunoprecipitated sample was determined by immunoblotting using an anti-HA antibody. Kinase activity in each immunoprecipitated sample was normalized to total HA-CK1ε. Immunoprecipitation and assay of Cdk5 were performed as described (19Liu F. Ma X.H. Ule J. Bibb J.A. Nishi A. DeMaggio A.J. Yan Z. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11062-11068Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated CKIε, from N2a cells treated with DHPG, was added to a mixture consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MnCl2, and 200 units of lambda phosphatase (Upstate Biotechnology, no. 14-405). Control reactions without lambda protein phosphatase were also performed. Dephosphorylation reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. To stop the reactions, beads with CKIε were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer and two times with kinase buffer (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol). Kinase activity was measured as described above. Twenty-four hours after transfecting N2a cells with CK1ε expression plasmids, cells were incubated in 200 μCi/ml (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) of 32P-inorganic phosphate and phosphate-free, serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h. Cyclosporin A was added to the transiently transfected cultures at a final concentration at 1 μm during the last 30 min of metabolic labeling. Cells were treated with DHPG for various periods of time as indicated, harvested by lysis in radioimmune precipitation buffer, and clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 10 min. Soluble extracts containing HA- or Myc-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with 12CA5 or 9E10 monoclonal antibody and protein A-agarose. The immunoprecipitates were eluted from the protein A-agarose and separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gel. Protein was stained briefly with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the gels were dried, and the labeled protein was visualized by autoradiography. Radioactivity was determined using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (AmershamBiosciences). Radiolabeled protein bands were excised, rehydrated, destained, and dried in a Speedvac. The gel slices were minced and rehydrated in 75 μg/ml TPCK/trypsin in 50 mmNH4CO3H (1 ml final volume) for 24 h at 37 °C. The supernatant was removed from the gel slices and then lyophilized to dryness. Recovery of tryptic phosphopeptides was determined by Cerenkov counting. The two-dimensional peptide mapping method was used to separate phosphopeptides. Lyophilized tryptic peptides were suspended in 10 μl of electrophoresis buffer (10% acetic acid and 1% pyridine, pH 3.5) and spotted onto thin-layer cellulose plates (20 × 20 cm, Analtech). Electrophoresis was carried out at 400 V for 1.5 h. Following electrophoresis, cellulose plates were dried and then subjected to ascending chromatography in buffer containing 25% l-butanol, 7.5% acetic acid, and 37.5% pyridine. Phosphopeptides were visualized using a PhosphorImager and radioactivity in individual phosphopeptides was measured using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Previously we showed that DHPG, an agonist for group I mGluRs, increased CK1 and Cdk5 activities in neostriatal slices, leading to enhanced phosphorylation of Ser-137 and Thr-75 of DARPP-32, respectively. Activation of group I mGluRs results in the stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis (22Conn P.J. Pin J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Google Scholar). Therefore, one possible mechanism for DHPG-dependent activation of CK1 might involve activation of PLCβ. However, it has also been reported that DHPG can potentiate the response of adenosine A2a receptors to agonist (23Paolillo M. Montecucco A. Zanassi P. Schinelli S. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 1937-1945Google Scholar, 24Cartmell J. Goepfert F. Knoflach F. Pink J.R. Bleuel Z. Richards J.G. Schaffhauser H. Kemp J.A. Wichmann J. Mutel V. Brain Res. 1998; 791: 191-199Google Scholar), raising the possibility of an involvement of other signal transduction pathways. We tested the effect of the specific PLCβ inhibitor,U73122, in slices. Preincubation with 12.5 μmU73122 for 20 min did not change the basal phosphorylation of Ser-137 or Thr-75, but the effect of DHPG was abolished (Fig.1). In contrast, the adenosine A2a receptor antagonist, ZM241385 (10 μm), did not affect the ability of DHPG to stimulate phosphorylation of Ser-137 or Thr-75. These results support a role for a signal transduction pathway involving PLCβ. Activation of PLCβ leads to production of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum. To examine the role of Ca2+, we used the Ca2+chelator, BAPTA/AM, in studies in slices. Preincubation with 20 μm BAPTA/AM did not change the basal phosphorylation of DARPP-32, but the effect of DHPG was abolished (Fig.1). Moreover, treatment of slices with the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin (2 μm), resulted in increased phosphorylation of both Ser-137 and Thr-75 of DARPP-32 (Fig. 1). Based on previous studies of the regulation of CK1ε (13Lowrey P.L. Shimomura K. Antoch M.P. Yamazaki S. Zemenides P.D. Ralph M.R. Menaker M. Takahashi J.S. Science. 2000; 288: 483-492Google Scholar, 17Cegielska A. Gietzen K.F. Rivers A. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1357-1364Google Scholar, 18Gietzen K.F. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32063-32070Google Scholar), we hypothesized that increased intracellular Ca2+ might activate a Ca2+-dependent protein phosphatase to dephosphorylate inhibitory autophosphorylation sites on CK1. The Ca2+-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin (PP2B), is expressed at high levels in striatum (25Goto S. Matsukado Y. Mihara Y. Inoue N. Miyamoto E. Brain Res. 1986; 397: 161-172Google Scholar). Treatment of slices with cyclosporin A (5 μm), a specific calcineurin inhibitor, for 1 h attenuated the effect of DHPG on phosphorylation of Ser-137 and Thr-75 of DARPP-32 (Fig. 1). To further characterize the effect of DHPG on CK1ε activity, we used a transfection system. An expression plasmid containing HA-tagged CK1ε was transiently transfected into N2a cells, and cells were treated with DHPG for 2 min. CK1ε was immunoprecipitated using anti-HA antibody, and CK1ε activity was assayed using DARPP-32 as substrate (Fig.2). An initial screen for different subtypes of group I mGluRs indicated that mGluR1 is expressed in N2a cells. For example, treatment of cells with DHPG resulted in an increase in CK1ε activity; this effect was blocked by the group I mGluR antagonist L-AP3 (Fig. 2). Preincubation of cells with U73122 (10 μm), BAPTA/AM (20 μm), or cyclosporin A (1 μm) abolished the effect of DHPG on CK1ε activity, consistent with a role for Ca2+-dependent activation of calcineurin in the regulation of CK1ε. Previously we demonstrated by using specific CK1 inhibitors that group I mGluRs activate Cdk5 kinase activity via a pathway that involves CK1. To further examine whether Cdk5 activation by DHPG is through a PLCβ/Ca2+/calcineurin pathway, we analyzed Cdk5 kinase activity following its immunoprecipitation from mouse neostriatal slices. Preincubation of mouse neostriatal slices with U73122 (12.5 μm), BAPTA/AM (20 μm) for 30 min, or cyclosporin A (5 μm) for 60 min abolished the effect of DHPG on Cdk5 activity (Fig. 3). Treatment of slices with ionomycin (2 μm) for 2 min also resulted in an increase in Cdk5 kinase activity by 2-fold; the effect of ionomycin was blocked by cyclosporin A (5 μm). The ability of cyclosporin A to block the effect of DHPG suggested that the regulation of CK1ε by DHPG might involve direct dephosphorylation of CK1ε by calcineurin. To examine the phosphorylation state of CK1ε in response to DHPG, N2a cells that expressed HA-CK1ε were metabolically labeled with 32P and then treated with DHPG for various periods of time. HA-CK1ε was immunoprecipitated, separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig.4 a), and then subjected to two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping (Fig. 4 b). There was little apparent change in the total level of phosphorylation of CK1ε after incubation of cells with DHPG (Fig. 4 a). However, peptide mapping revealed that DHPG treatment resulted in rapid and transient dephosphorylation of a subset of phosphopeptides (Fig.4 b). At time 0 (in the absence of DHPG), wild-type CK1ε was found to be strongly phosphorylated at one site (basic peptide labeled “C ” in Fig. 4 b, top left). In addition, 7–10 negatively charged peptides were phosphorylated (acidic sites, circled in Fig.4 b,top left). Treatment with DHPG for 2 or 4 min resulted in the dephosphorylation of the acidic peptides, whereas there was no dephosphorylation of the control (basic) peptide. Indeed, after calculating the relative radioactivity in the acidic peptides and in the C peptide, phosphorylation of the C peptide actually increased ∼2-fold at 2 or 4 min. Ten minutes after DHPG treatment, the phosphorylation level of the acidic peptides, and also of the C peptide, returned close to the same levels observed in the “0 min” time point sample. Preincubation of cells with cyclosporin A (1 μm) for 30 min before the addition of DHPG prevented the transient dephosphorylation of the acidic peptides in CK1ε (Fig.4 c, measured at the 4 min time point). Together these results indicate that DHPG stimulates calcineurin and results in transient dephosphorylation of a subset of autophosphorylation sites in CK1ε, whereas phosphorylation of a separate site increases transiently. Eight phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal domain of CK1ε were identified as probable in vivo autophosphorylation sites (18Gietzen K.F. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32063-32070Google Scholar). To further examine the details of CK1ε activation, we tested a mutant of CK1ε, MM2, that lacked the eight sites (S323A/T325A/T334A/T337A/S368A/S405A/T407A/S408A). Myc-MM2-CK1ε was transiently transfected into N2a cells, immunoprecipitated, and subjected to phosphopeptide mapping and kinase activity assay. Phosphopeptide mapping revealed that MM2-CK1ε was autophosphorylated only at the control (basic) peptide, and treatment with DHPG had no effect on phosphorylation of this site (Fig.5 a and data not shown). Treatment with DHPG had no effect on MM2-CK1ε activity assayed using DARPP-32 as substrate, and this was also unaffected by preincubation with cyclosporin A (Fig. 5 b). The expression level of Myc-tagged MM2-CK1ε in N2a cells was about the same as the HA-tagged wild-type CK1ε, but the immunoprecipitated MM2-CK1ε was ∼2-fold more active than HA-CK1ε (Fig. 5 b). Previous studies carried out in vitro had suggested that inhibitory autophosphorylation site(s) within the catalytic domain might also contribute to autoinhibition of CK1ε (17Cegielska A. Gietzen K.F. Rivers A. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1357-1364Google Scholar). The phosphopeptide maps revealed that the control (basic) phosphopeptide was present in both wild-type and MM2-CKIε, and that phosphorylation of this site increased transiently in wild-type CK1ε (but, notably, not in MM2-CK1ε) following treatment with DHPG (Figs. 4 and 5). The identity of the control site phosphorylated under basal conditions is not known. To examine whether phosphorylation of this site has any influence on CKIε activity, tagged CK1ε was immunoprecipitated from N2a cell lysates and incubated with nonspecific lambda protein phosphatase. The incubation with lambda phosphatase substantially reduced phosphorylation of either wild-type or MM2-CK1ε, as revealed by studies in which cells were prelabeled with 32P (and treated with DHPG) (Fig.6 a,upper panel). Other samples were prepared in parallel with unlabeled N2a cells and treated with lambda phosphatase, and CK1 activity was assayed using DARPP-32 as substrate. Phosphatase treatment did not apparently affect the activity of wild-type or MM2-CKIε (all cells were preincubated with DHPG) (Fig. 6 a,lower panel, and Fig.6 b), suggesting that phosphorylation of the control site in intact cells did not regulate CK1ε. Comparison of our phosphopeptide maps with those obtained in a previous study of wild-type CK1ε and a kinase-dead mutant suggest that the control site might not be autophosphorylated by an intramolecular mechanism (cf. peptide f in Fig. 1 B in Gietzenet al. (18Gietzen K.F. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32063-32070Google Scholar)) and could possibly be phosphorylated by another protein kinase in intact cells. In the present study, we found that as the activity of CK1ε was stimulated ∼2-fold by dephosphorylation of a subset of inhibitory sites, phosphorylation of the control site was increased ∼2-fold (see Fig. 4, a and b). This observation supports the idea that the phosphorylation of the control site is linked directly to the activity of CK1ε and probably occurs, at least in part, via autophosphorylation. In the present study we have examined the signal transduction pathway that links stimulation of group I mGluRs to CK1ε activation. The results obtained are consistent with the mechanism illustrated in Fig. 7. Activation of mGluR1 receptors stimulates G proteins that are coupled to PLCβ; Ca2+ released from IP3-sensitive stores actives the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin; and calcineurin dephosphorylates the inhibitory autophosphorylation sites on CKIε. Dephosphorylation of CK1ε results in an increase in kinase activity. However, this increase is transient because of the subsequent autophosphorylation and autoinhibition of the kinase. Our previous studies had shown that in neostriatal slices, DHPG, an agonist for group I mGluRs, increased CK1 activity, leading to enhanced phosphorylation of Ser-137 of DARPP-32. In the present study, we found that the phosphorylation of Ser-137 of DARPP-32 in neostriatal neurons was sensitive to U73122, BAPTA, and cyclosporin A. The phosphorylation of Thr-75 was also sensitive to these inhibitors, supporting our previous results indicating that activation of CK1 leads to activation of Cdk5 (19Liu F. Ma X.H. Ule J. Bibb J.A. Nishi A. DeMaggio A.J. Yan Z. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11062-11068Google Scholar). The present results, from studies carried out largely using transfected cell lines, support the conclusion that CK1ε is the likely target for regulation by type I mGluRs in neostriatal neurons. However, it is possible that other CK1 isoforms may be activated through a pathway similar to that shown in Fig. 7. The C-terminal 125 amino acids of CK1δ is ∼50% identical to the corresponding domain of CK1ε. In addition, several in vitro studies have found that the activity of CK1δ, like CK1ε, is regulated by autophosphorylation (16Graves P.R. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21689-21694Google Scholar, 26Rivers A. Gietzen K.F. Vielhaber E. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15980-15984Google Scholar). In vitro studies have also indicated that all three CK1γ isoforms can be autophosphorylated (16Graves P.R. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21689-21694Google Scholar), raising the possibility that these isoforms are regulated as well. CK1α, -δ, and -ε isoforms have all been found to be expressed in brain and are likely to be distributed widely in neurons (27Graves P.R. Haas D.W. Hagedorn C.H. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6394-6401Google Scholar, 28Ghoshal N. Smiley J.F. DeMaggio A.J. Hoekstra M.F. Cochran E.J. Binder L.I. Kuret J. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1163-1172Google Scholar, 29Takano A. Shimizu K. Kani S. Buijs R.M. Okada M. Nagai K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 106-112Google Scholar). In addition, our preliminary results indicate that CK1α, -δ, and -ε isoforms are expressed in neostriatum (data not shown). Thus it is possible that activation of calcineurin could lead to transient activation of several CK1 isoforms in neostriatal slices (see also further discussion below). The precise molecular mechanism by which autophosphorylation of CK1 isoforms regulates enzyme activity is not clear. Autophosphorylation of multiple C-terminal sites in CK1δ and CK1ε appear to be required, although the precise relationship between individual sites and enzyme activity remains to be clarified (16Graves P.R. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21689-21694Google Scholar, 17Cegielska A. Gietzen K.F. Rivers A. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1357-1364Google Scholar, 18Gietzen K.F. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32063-32070Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation is associated with inhibition of enzyme activity toward protein substrates but does not affect phosphorylation of some short synthetic peptides. This latter observation suggests that autophosphorylation serves to influence protein substrate binding negatively by a process that does not block access to the active site of the kinase. Ser-137, the site phosphorylated in DARPP-32 by CK1, is situated at the C-terminal end of a highly acidic region of the protein (23 of 30 residues are either glutamate or aspartate) (30Hemmings Jr., H.C. Nairn A.C. Elliott J.I. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20369-20376Google Scholar). Possibly, the phosphorylated C-terminal domain of CK1ε (or other isoforms) could act to block binding of longer polypeptide substrates containing acidic domains but not shorter synthetic peptides. Dephosphorylation of the C-terminal domain would then lead to a loss of this inhibitory constraint. Alternatively, an unphosphorylated C-terminal domain (which in CK1ε contains a significant excess of basic amino acids) could serve a positive role in binding to polypeptide substrates that contain acidic domains. The present study establishes that autophosphorylation of CK1ε at least is a regulated physiological event in intact cells. Although we did not investigate in detail the identity of the site(s) of autophosphorylation that are regulated by calcineurin, the results provide some further insight into the molecular events involved in regulation of CK1ε activity in intact cells. Previous studies of CK1ε have indicated that at least eight sites are autophosphorylatedin vitro. However, in intact cells autophosphorylation of many of these sites is apparent only in the presence of okadaic acid or calyculin A, inhibitors of PP1 and PP2A (18Gietzen K.F. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32063-32070Google Scholar, 26Rivers A. Gietzen K.F. Vielhaber E. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15980-15984Google Scholar). Moreover, autophosphorylation of these sites in the presence of PP1/PP2A inhibitors is associated with a decrease in electrophoretic mobility, detected using SDS-PAGE. In the present study, a significant level of autophosphorylation of CK1ε was observed in intact cells under basal conditions. Moreover, treatment with DHPG or cyclosporin A had no effect on the electrophoretic mobility of the protein, despite the dephosphorylation of a subset of the sites phosphorylated. A reasonable explanation for these results is that there are a least two subsets of autophosphorylation sites. One set is subject to dephosphorylation by calcineurin, is not associated with any alteration of electrophoretic mobility, and is phosphorylated under basal conditions in intact cells as long as calcineurin is inactive. The second set is subject to dephosphorylation by PP1 or PP2A, is associated with a decrease in electrophoretic mobility, and is maintained in a dephosphorylated state in intact cells by active PP1 or PP2A. Additional mutagenesis will be required to identify the site(s) in CK1ε that are specifically dephosphorylated by either calcineurin or PP1/PP2A in intact cells. The results from our present study indicate that one or more of the sites phosphorylated under basal conditions, and dephosphorylated by activated calcineurin, is associated with regulation of CK1ε activity. It also seems likely that autophosphorylation of one or more of the sites dephosphorylated in intact cells by PP1/PP2A may be associated with regulation of CK1ε activity. Although the sites that are sensitive to PP1/PP2A are maintained in a dephosphorylated state in cells in culture (and apparently in neostriatal neurons under basal conditions), it is possible that physiological inhibition of PP1 or PP2A would result in additional inhibition of CK1ε. For example, in neostriatal neurons, stimulation of phosphorylation of DARPP-32 by D1 dopamine receptors would lead to inhibition of PP1 and could influence CK1ε activity. Further studies will be required to determine whether autophosphorylation of these different sets of sites results in independent modes of regulation of CK1ε or whether there is some sort of interdependence between autophosphorylation of the different sites and regulation of CK1. Autophosphorylation of different sites could have additive or synergistic effects, could cause them to occlude one another, or perhaps could even modulate the ability of CK1 to interact with distinct substrates. Interestingly, three of the eight sites in CK1ε (Thr-325, Ser-368, and Ser-405) appear to be conserved in CK1δ. It is possible that these conserved sites might also confer regulation of CK1δ by calcineurin in intact cells. Alternatively, different autophosphorylation sites may be used to confer differential physiological regulation of CK1 isoforms by protein phosphatases. The present studies were motivated by our original observations indicating that CK1 could phosphorylate Ser-137 of DARPP-32 (31Desdouits F. Cohen D. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Girault J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8772-8778Google Scholar, 32Desdouits F. Siciliano J.C. Greengard P. Girault J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2682-2685Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-137 impairs the ability of Thr-34 of DARPP-32 to be dephosphorylated by calcineurin, thereby modulating the DARPP-32/PP1 cascade. Our more recent studies support the conclusion that activation of CK1 by group I mGluRs results in phosphorylation of Ser-137 of DARPP-32 in neostriatal neurons and that this leads to regulation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (19Liu F. Ma X.H. Ule J. Bibb J.A. Nishi A. DeMaggio A.J. Yan Z. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11062-11068Google Scholar). A variety of other studies have provided strong support for a role of CK1 isoforms, particularly CK1δ and CK1ε, in diverse cellular processes such as regulation of Wnt signaling and of the circadian clock (7Sakanaka C.

CK1δ and CK1ε have also been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (28Ghoshal N. Smiley J.F. DeMaggio A.J. Hoekstra M.F. Cochran E.J. Binder L.I. Kuret J. Am. J.

Ghoshal N. Binder L.I. Kuret J. McGeer P.L. Neurobiol. Aging. 2000; 21: 503-510Google Scholar). Regulation of CK1ε (and possibly CK1δ) by autophosphorylation and transient dephosphorylation by calcineurin may play an important role in the regulation of these other processes that involve the enzyme. Activation of calcineurin may result from stimulation of mGluRs or via many alternative pathways that increase the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ in mammalian cells. Regulation of CK1ε also adds to the diversity of signal transduction pathways utilized by mGluRs and may be responsible for various actions of this increasingly important family of G protein-coupled receptors (35Sallese M. Iacovelli L. Cumashi A. Capobianco L. Cuomo L. De Blasi A. Biochim Biophys Acta. 2000; 1498: 112-121Google Scholar, 36Hermans E. Challiss R.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 465-484Google Scholar). Finally, the results from these studies indicate that CK1ε represents an additional example of a group of protein kinases including Cdks, Src family members, and Raf-1 (37Williams J.C. Wierenga R.K.

Here we report identification of an interaction between Grb7 and the cytoplasmic domain of EphB1 by using Grb7 as a “bait” in a yeast two-hybrid screening. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to confirm the interaction of Grb7 with the cytoplasmic domain of EphB1 as well as the full-length receptor in intact cells. This interaction is mediated by the SH2 domain of Grb7 and requires tyrosine autophosphorylation of EphB1. Furthermore, Tyr-928 of EphB1 was identified as the primary binding site for Grb7. Stimulation of endogenous EphB1 in embryonal carcinoma P19 cells with its ligand ephrinB1 increased its association with Grb7, which is consistent with a role for the autophosphorylation of EphB1. We also found that EphB1 could phosphorylate Grb7 and mutation of either Tyr-928 or Tyr-594 to Phe decreased this activity. Finally, we show that EphB1 could stimulate fibroblast motility on extracellular matrix in a kinase-dependent manner, which also correlated with its association with Grb7. Consistent with this, co-expression of Grb7 with EphB1 further enhanced cell motility, whereas co-expression of the Grb7 SH2 domain abolished EphB1-stimulated cell migration. Together, our results identified a novel interaction between EphB1 with the adaptor molecule Grb7 and suggested that this interaction may play a role in the regulation of cell migration by EphB1.

Grb7 is the founding member of a family of adaptor molecules that also include Grb10 and Grb14. The Grb7 family members share similar structural organizations, including an amino-terminal proline-rich region, a central segment termed the GM 1The abbreviations used are: GM, Grb and Mig; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; ECM, extracellular matrix; HA, hemagglutinin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GFP, green fluorescence protein; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; LMW-PTP, low molecular weight protein-tyrosine phosphatase.1The abbreviations used are: GM, Grb and Mig; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; ECM, extracellular matrix; HA, hemagglutinin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GFP, green fluorescence protein; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; LMW-PTP, low molecular weight protein-tyrosine phosphatase. (for Grb andMig) region, which includes a pleckstrin homology domain, and a carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain. Grb7 family members have been shown to interact with a variety of cell surface receptors and other signaling proteins (1Daly R.J. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 613-618Google Scholar, 2Han D.C. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6315-6321Google Scholar). Many of these interactions are mediated by the SH2 domain of a Grb7 family member and a phospho-tyrosine motif in the activated receptors/other signaling molecules. These interactions have been proposed to play a role in the regulation of mitogenic signaling pathways. A number of recent studies provided evidence to support a role of Grb10 in cell proliferation and cell survival (3Morrione A. Valentinis B. Resnicoff M. Xu S. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26382-26387Google Scholar, 4Wang J. Dai H. Yousaf N. Moussaif M. Deng Y. Boufelliga A. Swamy O.R. Leone M.E. Riedel H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6217-6228Google Scholar), although a similar role for the other family members Grb7 and Grb14 is not clear (2Han D.C. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6315-6321Google Scholar).The central GM domain of Grb7 family adaptors share significant sequence homology with Mig-10, a Caenorhabditis elegans gene that has been implicated in neuronal migration in C. elegansembryonic development (5Manser J. Wood W.B. Dev. Genet. 1990; 11: 49-64Google Scholar, 6Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1621-1630Google Scholar). This suggests that Grb7 may play a role in the regulation of mammalian cell migration. Indeed, recent studies from our laboratory showed that Grb7 participates in signal transduction pathways in integrin-mediated cell migration (11Han D.C. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24425-24430Google Scholar,12Han D.C. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28911-28917Google Scholar). We found that the SH2 domain of Grb7 could directly interact with focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase known to mediate integrin signaling in cell migration (7Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 146-152Google Scholar, 8Hanks S.K. Polte T.R. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 137-145Google Scholar, 9Cary L.A. Guan J.L. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D102-D113Google Scholar, 10Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Google Scholar). Grb7 interaction with FAK required autophosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-397, and this interaction is increased upon integrin-mediated cell adhesion, which stimulates FAK activation and autophosphorylation. Inducible over-expression of Grb7 in NIH3T3 cells enhanced cell migration toward fibronectin, whereas the SH2 domain inhibited cell migration. Association of Grb7 with FAK allowed phosphorylation by FAK, which was shown to be critical in the regulation of cell migration (11Han D.C. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24425-24430Google Scholar, 12Han D.C. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28911-28917Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, whether Grb7 interactions with other signaling molecules and/or cell surface receptors also play a role in the regulation of cell migration.With 15 members by the last count, Eph kinases constitute the largest family of receptor protein tyrosine kinases. According to sequence homology and ligand-binding specificity, they are divided into two subfamilies. EphA kinases bind to ephrinA ligands that are anchored to cytoplasmic membrane through a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol linkage, whereas EphB kinases bind to ephrinB ligands that have a single transmembrane domain. Interestingly, receptor-ligand relationships between Eph kinases and ephrins are not distinct in that both Eph kinases and ephrins can transmit signals to the interior of juxtaposing cells (13Holland S.J. Gale N.W. Mbamalu G. Yancopoulos G.D. Henkemeyer M. Pawson T. Nature. 1996; 383: 722-725Google Scholar, 14Bruckner K. Pasquale E.B. Klein R. Science. 1997; 275: 1640-1643Google Scholar, 15Cowan C.A.

The Eph-ephrin interaction and ensuing bi-directional signaling have been implicated in diverse biological processes including nervous system development, angiogenesis, and neural synapsis formation and maturation (see Refs. 17Wilkinson D.G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 155-164Google Scholar, 18Flanagan J.G. Vanderhaeghen P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 309-345Google Scholar, 19Adams R.H. Klein R. Trends Cardiovasc.

Neuron. 2002; 33: 159-162Google Scholar for recent reviews).The regulatory functions of Eph kinases have been attributed to repulsive guidance of axon and cell migration in some cases and establishment and remodeling of cell-cell interactions in other situations (17Wilkinson D.G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 155-164Google Scholar, 18Flanagan J.G. Vanderhaeghen P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 309-345Google Scholar, 21Gale N.W. Yancopoulos G.D.

Recent studies suggested that several Eph receptors could regulate cell adhesion and migration on extracellular matrix (ECM) (23Zou J.X. Wang B. Kalo M.S. Zisch A.H. Pasquale E.B. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13813-13818Google Scholar, 24Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Google Scholar, 25Wang B. Zou J.X. Ek-Rylander B. Ruoslahti E.

EphB2 could down-regulate integrin activity, possibly through tyrosine phosphorylation and inactivation of R-Ras (23Zou J.X. Wang B. Kalo M.S. Zisch A.H. Pasquale E.B. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13813-13818Google Scholar), a positive regulator of integrin function (24Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Google Scholar, 25Wang B. Zou J.X. Ek-Rylander B. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5222-5227Google Scholar). In PC-3 cells, ligand stimulation of endogenous EphA2 caused cell rounding due to integrin affinity down-regulation, concomitant with focal adhesion kinase dephosphorylation (26Miao H. Burnett E. Kinch M. Simon E. Wang B. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 62-69Google Scholar). Induction of cell de-adhesion was also observed following ligand activation of EphA3 transfected into 293 cells (27Boyd A.W. Lackmann M. Sci. STKE. 2001; 112: RE20Google Scholar, 28Lawrenson I.D. Wimmer-Kleikamp S.H. Lock P. Schoenwaelder S.M. Down M. Boyd A.W. Alewood P.F. Lackmann M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1059-1072Google Scholar). The adhesion regulatory function of Eph kinases appears to be cell type-specific; transfection of EphA8 into HEK 293 cell inhibited cell adhesion (29Choi S. Park S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5413-5422Google Scholar), whereas in NIH 3T3 cells, the similarly transfected EphA8 stimulated integrin-mediated cell adhesion (30Gu C. Park S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4579-4597Google Scholar). Recently, EphA4 and other EphA kinases were found to associate with ephexin, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho family small GTPases (31Shamah S.M. Lin M.Z. Goldberg J.L. Estrach S. Sahin M. Hu L. Bazalakova M. Neve R.L. Corfas G. Debant A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 2001; 105: 233-244Google Scholar). Upon EphA kinase ligation, ephexin mediates activation of RhoA and suppression of Cdc42 and Rac1, consistent with the repulsive guidance function of Eph kinases.To further explore the role and mechanisms of Grb7 in cell migration, we used yeast two-hybrid screening to identify novel cellular proteins that bind to Grb7. We report here the identification of the association of EphB1 with Grb7 in an activation-dependent manner and the effect of EphB1 expression on cell migration. These results suggest the potential role of Grb7 in mediating the signaling pathways triggered by the EphB1 receptor in cell migration.RESULTSTo understand the role of Grb7 as an adaptor molecule in the regulation of cell migration, we employed yeast two-hybrid screening to identify protein(s) that can interact with Grb7. A cDNA encoding full-length Grb7 was inserted into pGBT9 bait vector and used to screen a HeLa cell library (32Hannon G.J. Demetrick D. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2378-2391Google Scholar) in the prey vector pGAD. From ∼2 × 106 transformants, several clones were identified that specifically interacted with the Grb7 bait. The specificity of the interactions was confirmed by co-transforming yeast cells with the recovered prey plasmids and pGBT9-Grb7 or pGBT9 vector alone as control. Partial DNA sequencing of the clones indicated that one of the clones encodes part of the human receptor tyrosine kinase EphB1 including the catalytic site in the cytoplasmic domain. This clone is designated as pGAD-EphB1cyto.A number of tyrosine kinases have been shown to interact with Grb7 through its SH2 domain (2Han D.C. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6315-6321Google Scholar). To determine whether the SH2 domain of Grb7 is also involved in mediating the interaction of Grb7 with EphB1cyto, we tested potential interaction of EphB1cyto interaction with a Grb7 truncation mutant lacking the SH2 domain (designated Pro-GM) in a yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 1). As expected, EphB1cyto interacted with the full-length Grb7 encoded by pGBT-Grb7 but not pGBT9 vector alone. Interestingly, EphB1cyto did not show any interaction with Pro-GM. These results suggested that EphB1cyto also interacted with Grb7 through its SH2 domain.To verify the yeast two-hybrid results and to further investigate the potential interaction of EphB1 with the Grb7 SH2 domain, a mammalian expression vector encoding the EphB1 cytoplasmic domain (EphB1cyto) with a triple HA tag fused to its amino terminus was generated as described in the “Materials and Methods.” Point mutations were introduced into EphB1cyto to generate the kinase-defective (EphB1cyto-kd) and missense mutations (EphB1cyto-Y594F and EphB1cyto-Y928F) in the same expression vector. Tyr-594 and Tyr-928 have been shown to mediate EphB1 interactions with Nck and LMW-PTP, respectively. CHO cells were co-transfected with pKH3 vectors encoding EphB1cyto or its mutants along with pDHGST-Grb7 encoding Grb7 fused to GST at the amino terminus (11Han D.C. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24425-24430Google Scholar). Two days after transfection cells were lysed and GST-Grb7 complexes were precipitated with glutathione-agarose beads. After washing, the bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with antibody against EphB1. Fig.2 shows that the wild type EphB1cyto and EphB1cyto-Y594F mutant associated with Grb7 in CHO cells. In contrast, EphB1cyto-kd was not associated with Grb7, and the EphB1cyto-Y928F mutant showed a significantly reduced association with Grb7. Similar expression levels of EphB1cyto and its mutants were verified by blotting of whole cell lysates with anti-EphB1 antibodies. We noticed that EphB1cyto-kd exhibited an increased mobility compared with wild type EphB1-cyto on the gel, suggesting that EphB1 autophosphorylation affected its mobility on SDS-PAGE. Together, these results demonstrate the interaction of EphB1 with Grb7 and suggest that autophosphorylation of EphB1 at Tyr-928 plays a major role in mediating its interaction with Grb7 through the SH2 domain.Figure 2Association of Grb7 with EphB1 cytoplasmic domain and its mutants in mammalian cells. CHO cells were co-transfected with plasmid pDHGST-Grb7 and pKH3-EphB1cyto, pKH3-EphB1cyto-kd, pKH3-EphB1cyto-Y594F, or pKH3-EphB1cyto-Y928F, as indicated. Grb7 was pulled-down from the lysates using glutathione-coupled agarose beads. They were then analyzed by Western blotting with anti-EphB1 (left four lanes). Aliquots of the lysates (whole cell lysates) were also analyzed directly by Western blotting with anti-EphB1 to verify similar expression levels in all samples (right four lanes). Molecular mass positions (kDa) are shown on theleft. The arrow on the right indicates the position of EphB1 cytoplasmic domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We next examined the association of the full-length EphB1 with Grb7 and its various domains in intact cells. CHO cells were co-transfected with expression vector encoding HA-tagged full-length EphB1 and pDHGST encoding Grb7 or its different segments with GST fused at their amino terminus. Two days after transfection, the lysates were prepared and GST fusion proteins were pulled down using glutathione-agarose beads. The bound proteins were then analyzed by Western blotting with polyclonal anti-HA antibody to detect associated HA-tagged EphB1 (Fig.3 A) or with anti-GST to detect the amount of Grb7 or its segments in the complex (Fig. 3 B). EphB1 bound to full-length Grb7 and the SH2 domain of Grb7 but not the GM domain, Pro-GM domains, or GST alone control. Although the amount of GST-GM is slightly lower than the Grb7 or SH2 domain alone, comparable amounts of GST-Pro-GM were precipitated. Western blotting of whole cell lysates with anti-HA confirmed similar expression levels of EphB1 in all samples (Fig. 3 C). Together, these results indicated that the SH2 domain of Grb7 is sufficient for mediating specific binding of Grb7 to EphB1 in mammalian cells and that other domains are not involved in the interaction. In addition we found that Grb7 did not interact with EphB3, another member of the EphB family, in similar experiments (data not shown), providing further support for the specificity of Grb7 interaction with EphB1.Figure 3Binding of full-length EphB1 to Grb7 and its segments. CHO cells were co-transfected with pKCH-EphB1 encoding HA-tagged full-length EphB1 and pDHGST, pDHGST-Grb7, pDHGST-GM, pDHGST-Pro-GM, and pDHGST-SH2, as indicated. Two days after transfection, cells were lysed and Grb7 or its segments were pulled-down from the lysates using glutathione-coupled agarose beads. They were then analyzed by Western blotting with anti-HA (A) or anti-GST (B). Aliquots of the lysates (WCL) were also analyzed directly by Western blotting with anti-HA to verify similar expression levels EphB1 (C). Molecular mass positions (kDa) are shown on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The above data show clearly that EphB1 could interact with Grb7 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. However, the biological significance of this interaction can only be established if this interaction is regulated by activation of endogenous EphB1 by its ligand. To investigate this possibility, we employed P19 cells that express endogenous EphB1. The cells were transiently transfected with a mammalian expression vector pHAN-Grb7 encoding a His-tagged Grb7. Two days after transfection, the cells were treated with EphB1 ligand ephrin-B1-Fc or Fc control. Cell lysates were then prepared, and EphB1 complexes were precipitated with ephrin-B1-Fc-protein A/G beads. After washing, the precipitated complexes were resolved on SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting using anti-Grb7 antibody. Fig.4 shows that endogenous EphB1 associates with Grb7, and treatment of cells with the ligand ephrin B1 further enhanced EphB1/Grb7 association.Figure 4Stimulation of Grb7 association with endogenous EphB1 upon ligand treatment. P19 cells were transfected with pKH3-Grb7 and then incubated with or without Ephrin-B1-Fc fusion protein as described under “Materials and Methods.” The cells were lysed and EphB1 complex was pull-downed with pre-clustered EphrinB1-Fc-Protein A/G beads. They were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Grb7 (left panel). Aliquots of the lysates (WCL, right panel) were also analyzed directly with anti-Grb7 to show similar expression levels (right panel). Molecular mass positions (kDa) are shown on theleft.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Our previous studies (12Han D.C. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28911-28917Google Scholar) showed that Grb7 could be phosphorylated by FAK, which plays a role in the regulation of cell migration by FAK. To further investigate the potential cellular function of EphB1 binding to Grb7, we examined the possibility of tyrosine phosphorylation of Grb7 by EphB1. We first analyzed the kinase activity of the EphB1 and its mutants because a number of reports suggested that mutation of the corresponding Tyr-594 residue in EphB2 attenuated its catalytic function (34Binns K.L. Taylor P.P. Sicheri F. Pawson T. Holland S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4791-4805Google Scholar, 35Zisch A.H. Pazzagli C. Freeman A.L. Schneller M. Hadman M. Smith J.W. Ruoslahti E. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 177-187Google Scholar). CHO cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding HA-tagged EphB1 or its mutants. Lysates were prepared two days after transfection and analyzed for autophosphorylation by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA followed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY-20. Fig.5 A shows that the wild type EphB1 exhibited strong autophosphorylation, whereas the kinase-defective mutant did not show any autophosphorylation, as expected. The Y594F mutant showed a significant decrease in phosphorylation, whereas the Y928F mutant only has a slightly reduced phosphorylation (top panel). Western blotting of the lysates from parallel samples with anti-HA verified similar expression levels of the constructs (bottom panel). These results suggested that mutation at Y594 also attenuated the kinase activity of EphB1, as in the case of EphB2 reported earlier (34Binns K.L. Taylor P.P. Sicheri F. Pawson T. Holland S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4791-4805Google Scholar, 35Zisch A.H. Pazzagli C. Freeman A.L. Schneller M. Hadman M. Smith J.W. Ruoslahti E. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 177-187Google Scholar).Figure 5Induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of Grb7 by EphB1. A, CHO cells were transfected with pKCH vector alone, pKCH-EphB1, pKCH-EphB1-kd, pKCH-EphB1-Y594F, or pKCH-EphB1-Y928F, as indicated. Two days after transfection, cells were lysed and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA followed by Western blotting with PY-20 (top panel) or anti-HA (bottom panel). B, CHO cells were co-transfected with expression vector pHAN-Grb7 and pKCH vector alone, pKCH-EphB1, pKCH-EphB1-kd, pKCH-EphB1-Y594F, or pKCH-EphB1-Y928F, as indicated. Two days after transfection, cells were lyzed and Grb7 was pulled-down from the lysates using Ni-beads. They were then analyzed by Western blotting with PY-20 to detect tyrosine phosphorylated Grb7 (top panel) and associated EphB1 or mutants (bottom panel) or anti-Grb7 to verify similar expression levels (middle panel). Molecular mass positions (kDa) are shown on theleft.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We then analyzed possible phosphorylation of Grb7 by EphB1 (Fig.5 B). CHO cells were co-transfected with pHAN-Grb7 and pKCH vectors encoding HA-tagged EphB1, its mutants EphB1-kd, EphB1-Y594F, and EphB1-Y928F, or vector alone as a control. Two days after transfection, cell lysates were prepared and Grb7 was precipitated with Ni-beads and analyzed by Western blotting with PY-20. The top panel shows that co-expression of wild type EphB1, but not the kinase-defective EphB1, induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Grb7. Both EphB1-Y594F and EphB1-Y928F mutant also induced Grb7 phosphorylation, although to a lesser extent than the wild type EphB1. Western blotting of the precipitates by anti-Grb7 verified similar amounts of Grb7 in the samples (middle panel).Because EphB1-Y594 mutant was still capable of binding to Grb7, we investigated the phosphorylation levels of EphB1 and its mutants that were associated with Grb7. Western blotting of Grb7 immunoprecipitates with PY20 revealed that wild type EphB1 was phosphorylated, whereas EphB1-kd was not. Interestingly, EphB1-Y594F was strongly phosphorylated (Fig. 5 B, lower panel), correlating with its ability to bind Grb7 (Fig. 2). The strong phosphorylation of the co-precipitated EphB1-Y594F suggests that Grb7 may target the pool of the EphB1 mutant that was appropriately phosphorylated at sites that are targeted by the SH2 domain of Grb7, including Tyr-928. The reduced phosphorylation of Grb7 by the EphB1-Y594F mutant, relative to the wild type, could be accounted for by its reduced catalytic activity, which is consistent with previous reports for EphB2 mutation at similar site (34Binns K.L. Taylor P.P. Sicheri F. Pawson T. Holland S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4791-4805Google Scholar, 35Zisch A.H. Pazzagli C. Freeman A.L. Schneller M. Hadman M. Smith J.W. Ruoslahti E. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 177-187Google Scholar).Consistent with the lack of interaction between EphB1-Y928F and Grb7 (Fig. 2), only low levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated EphB1-Y928F were detected in Grb7 precipitates. The low level of Grb7 phosphorylation, despite the relatively intact catalytic activity of EphB1-Y928F, indicates that the physical interaction may be necessary for phosphorylation to occur.To study whether EphB1 and its association with Grb7 could regulate cell migration, we tested the potential effects of EphB1 and its mutants on cell migration using a time-lapse imaging-based computerized motility analysis method called OMAware, as described previously (12Han D.C. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28911-28917Google Scholar). CHO cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding EphB1 or its mutants along with pEGFP to mark the transfected cells. Two days after transfection, a fraction of cells were lysed and analyzed by Western blotting to verify similar expression levels (data not shown and Fig. 5). The remaining cells were used to evaluate the effects of these constructs on cell motility using OMAware. Fig.6 shows that expression of wild type EphB1 stimulated CHO cell migration, whereas transfection of control pKH3 vector did not affect cell motility when compared with untransfected cells. Under similar conditions, the kinase-defective EphB1 did not stimulate cell migration. The Y594F mutant exhibits similar activity as the wild type EphB1, whereas the EphB1Y928F mutant shows reduced stimulation of cell migration (about 35% of that by the wild type EphB1).Figure 6Regulation of cell migration by EphB1 and its interaction with Grb7. CHO cells were co-transfected with vectors EphB1 or its mutants and plasmid encoding GFP fusion protein containing Grb7 or Grb7 SH2 domain or GFP alone, as indicated. They were then subjected to the cell migration assays as described under “Materials and Methods.” The mean and standard deviation of relative migration rate (normalized to untransfected cell as 1.0) from three independent experiments are shown. *p = 0.067 and P** = 0.042 in comparison to EphB1+GFP transfected cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)These results suggested that EphB1 could regulate cell migration in a kinase-dependent manner. In addition, they showed that the ability of EphB1 to stimulate cell migration correlated with its association with Grb7 (see Figs. 2 and 5), suggesting that EphB1 may regulate cell migration through its interaction with Grb7. To test this possibility, CHO cells were co-transfected with expression vector encoding EphB1 and pEGFP-Grb7 or pEGFP-Grb7SH2 encoding full-length Grb7 or the SH2 domain of Grb7, respectively. The cells were then subjected to motility assays using OMAware as described above. As shown in Fig. 6, expression of GFP-Grb7 alone stimulated cell migration as reported previously (11Han D.C. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24425-24430Google Scholar, 12Han D.C. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28911-28917Google Scholar). Co-expression of EphB1 with GFP-Grb7 further enhanced cell motility compared with expression of EphB1 with the GFP control or expression of GFP-Grb7 alone. Conversely, co-expression of EphB1 with the SH2 domain of Grb7 abolished EphB1-stimulated cell migration, presumably by disrupting EphB1 interaction with the endogenous Grb7. Together these results provide strong support for a role of EphB1 interaction with Grb7 in the regulation of cell migration.DISCUSSIONCell migration is critical for biological processes such as development, immune response, wound healing, and tumor metastasis. Initiation of cell migration involves detection of the gradients of soluble chemoattractants and/or immobilized environmental cues by cell surface receptors. The Eph receptor tyrosine kinases have been implicated to play a key role in the axon path-finding and migration of neurons as well as other cell types (17Wilkinson D.G. Nat. Rev.

The cDNA of the human gene contained a putative open reading frame of 1251 bp encoding 416 amino acids with 83.6% identity compared with the rat protein. The substrate specificity of the recombinant human protein demonstrated preference for Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 with a catalytic efficiency (V max/Km) 43-fold greater than that of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and 2-fold greater than that of Ins(1,4,5)P3. The apparentV max was 114 nmol of Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 formed/min/mg of protein, and the apparentKm was 0.3 μmIns(1,3,4,6)P4. The functional homolog in yeast is Ipk2p, and ipk2-null yeast strains do not synthesize Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 or InsP6. Synthesis of these compounds was restored by transformation with wild-type yeastIPK2 but not with human InsP4 5-kinase. Thus the human gene does not complement for the loss of the yeast gene because yeast cells do not contain the substrate Ins(1,3,4,6)P4, and the reaction of the human protein with Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 is insufficient to effect rescue or synthesis of InsP5 and InsP6. Therefore the major activity of human InsP4 5-kinase is phosphorylation at the D-5 position, and the pathways for synthesis of Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 in yeast versus humans are different.

Inositol phosphates are a group of highly complex molecules for which cellular functions are being defined; however, this process has been difficult because of the large number of different inositol phosphates, with varying numbers of phosphates in different positions of the inositol ring. The synthetic pathway generating higher order inositol phosphates, inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5) 1The abbreviations used are: Ins(1, 3,4,5,6)P5, inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate; InsP6, inositol hexakisphosphate; Ins(1, 4,5)P3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; InsP3 3-kinase(s), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase(s); InsP3 5/6-kinase, inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase; Ins(1, 3,4,5)P4 and Ins(1,3,4,6)P4, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate, respectively; InsP45-kinase, inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate 5-kinase; IPMK, inositol phosphate multikinase; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; EST, expressed sequence tag; ORF, open reading frame; SAX, strong anion exchange; OCRL, oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe and inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6), in human cells is not completely defined. Current evidence supports inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) as the common precursor and Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 and InsP6 as the predominant higher inositol phosphates in human cells, and the synthetic pathway from Ins(1,4,5)P3 to Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 remains an area of active investigation (for general reviews, see Refs. 1Majerus P.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1051-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar and 2Majerus P.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 225-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Hence, the goal of the current study is to define a catalytic step leading to Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 synthesis. The best characterized InsP6 synthetic pathway is inSaccharomyces cerevisiae (3York J.D. Guo S. Odom A.R. Spiegelberg B.D. Stolz L.E. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2001; 41: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The common precursor Ins(1,4,5)P3 is synthesized from phospholipase C and subsequently used by two distinct proteins, Ipk2p and Ipk1p, ultimately to generate InsP6. The IPK1 and IPK2genes were isolated from a genetic screen for mutants that were synthetically lethal in combination with a gle1-2 mutant, which is defective in mRNA export. Sequential phosphorylation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 at the D-6 and D-3 positions generates Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 and Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5, respectively, catalyzed by the IPK2 gene product (4Odom A.R. Stahlberg A. Wente S.R. York J.D. Science. 2000; 287: 2026-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Next, phosphorylation at the D-2 position yields InsP6 catalyzed by the IPK1 gene product (5Ives E.B. Nichols J. Wente S.R. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36575-36583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In human cells, the synthetic pathway to higher inositol phosphates shares the same initial step to produce the common precursor Ins(1,4,5)P3 catalyzed by phospholipase C (2Majerus P.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 225-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). However, the pathway from Ins(1,4,5)P3 to Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5is less clear. Two different synthetic pathways generating different isomers of InsP4 have been described. First, the synthesis of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 from Ins(1,4,5)P3 has been well documented to be catalyzed by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinases (InsP3 3-kinases) in response to stimulation by various ligands (6Communi D. Vanweyenberg V. Erneux C. Cell. Signal. 1995; 7: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 7Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). Genes encoding the InsP33-kinase have been cloned (8Thomas S. Brake B. Luzio J.P. Stanley K. Banting G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1220: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 9Takazawa K. Perret J. Dumont J.E. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 883-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 10Choi K.Y.

Vanweyenberg V. Erneux C. Cell. Signal. 1995; 7: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Second, the synthesis of Ins(1,3,4,6)P4from Ins(1,3,4)P3 was described to be catalyzed by the inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase (InsP3 5/6-kinase), which has no activity toward the Ins(1,4,5)P3 isomer (11Wilson M.P. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11904-11910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The Ins(1,3,4)P3 isomer is synthesized from Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 catalyzed by 5-phosphatase(s). The human enzymes responsible for the conversion of either Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 or Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 to Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 have not been reported. The final step is the phosphorylation of Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 at the D-2 position catalyzed by inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase (12Verbsky J.W. Wilson M.P. Kisseleva M.V. Majerus P.W. Wente S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31857-31862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To date, the synthesis of Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 from InsP4 has been characterized in S. cerevisiae, as noted above, and in rat. The rat inositol phosphate multikinase (IPMK) was isolated based on sequence homology at the putative binding site that catalyzed the transfer of phosphate from ATP to inositol phosphate (13Saiardi A. Nagata E. Luo H.R. Sawa A. Luo X. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2306-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Saiardi and co-workers (13Saiardi A.

The presence of a 5-kinase activity converting Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 to Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 has been previously proposed (14Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19879-19886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Menniti F.S. Oliver K.G. Nogimori K. Obie J.F. Shears S.B. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol.

In this paper we report the isolation of a human inositol kinase that has homology with the rat IPMK. Analysis of substrate specificity and enzyme kinetics demonstrates a preference for phosphorylation at the D-5 position. Based on substrate preference for Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 over Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, we assigned the name inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate 5-kinase (InsP4 5-kinase). We postulate that human InsP4 5-kinase exists in a metabolic pathway downstream from the InsP3 5/6-kinase and upstream from InsP5 2-kinase. Therefore with these three human kinases, we have established a metabolic pathway from InsP3to InsP6 in human cells. All chemicals were reagent grade or better.

The EST clone containing human InsP4 5-kinase (GenBank accession number BC016612) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Using the EST clone as template, the InsP4 5-kinase ORF was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-CGCGGATCCGCAACAGAGCCACCATCCCCCCTCC-3′ and 5′-CGGGGTACCGAGGATTCAATTGTCTAAAATACTTC-3′. The DNA sequence of both strands of the PCR product was obtained from cycle sequence PCR using ABI PRISM® Big Dye™ Terminators v 3.0 Cycle Sequencing Kit, and the product was analyzed at the Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory at Washington University. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as per manufacturer's protocol. Mutagenesis primers designed per manufacturer's protocol were 5′-GGATGTAAAGATAGGGCAAAAAAGCTATGATCCTTTTGC-3′ and 5′-GGCAAAAGGATCATAGCTTTTTTGCCCTATCTTTACATCC-3′. For expression in E. coli, a PCR product encoding human InsP4 5-kinase flanked by 5-prime BamHI and 3-prime KpnI sites was subcloned into the BamHI and KpnI sites of the expression vector pTrcHisA (Invitrogen). The N-terminal His-tagged fusion protein was transformed into E. coli strain BL21CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene).E. coli strain BL21CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL containing the expression construct (0.5 liter) was grown to O.D. ∼0.6 in LB + ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and the expression was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1,000–3,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of 100 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 4 °C. Lysozyme (Sigma) was added to final concentration of 0.75 mg/ml, and the resuspended cells were incubated at 4 °C for 60 min. Cells were lysed by sonication three times for 30 s each with a 2-min pause on ice between each sonication. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000–12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the resulting cell extract was applied to 0.5 ml of cobalt-based metal affinity TALON resin (Clontech). The resin was washed three times with 10 bed volumes of 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 4 °C. The His-tagged human InsP4 5-kinase was eluted with 100 mm imidazole in the above buffer. For expression in S. cerevisiae, human InsP45-kinase was subcloned into the yeast-E. coli shuttle vector pLGSD5Trp under the regulation of the inducible yeast Gal10promoter. The vector pLGSD5Trp (from John W. Verbsky) was constructed by substituting the StuI fragment containing the majority of the URA3 gene from the vector pLGSD5 with theStuI-PuvII fragment containing theTRP1 gene by blunt end ligation. The InsP45-kinase ORF was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-CGCGGATCCATGGCAACAGAGCCACCATCC-3′ and 5′-CCCGAGCTCGAGGATTCAATTGTCTAAAATAC-3′. A PCR product encoding human InsP4 5-kinase flanked by 5-prime BamHI and 3-prime SacI sites was subcloned into the plasmid pCR2.1-TOPO after incubation with TaqDNA polymerase per TOPO TA cloning kit protocol (Invitrogen). TheBamHI-SacI fragment containing the InsP4 5-kinase was subcloned into pLGSD5Trp behind the yeast Gal10 promoter. The DNA sequence was verified by sequencing both strands of the PCR product as described previously. A PCR product containing the entire ORF of human InsP4 5-kinase (as described above) was used as a template for random sequence hexanucleotide-mediated labeling reaction as per RediprimeII labeling kit protocol (AmershamBiosciences). The resulting 32P-labeled probes were hybridized to Multiple Tissue Northern Blots and Multiple Tissue Expression Arrays following the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Enzymatic activity was determined by the addition of the desired amount of enzyme to 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, and 1,000–2,000 cpm of [3H]Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 to a total reaction volume of 50 μl at 37 °C for the desired times. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of H2O, and the sample was loaded onto a 500-μl Dowex AG 1-X8 formate column (mesh 200–400, Bio-Rad) equilibrated in water. The column was washed with 1 m ammonium formate and 0.1 m formic acid to elute the substrate. The product was eluted with 2 mammonium formate and 0.1 m formic acid and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Samples from enzymatic reactions as described above were analyzed using HPLC with either a 4.6 x 125-mm Partisphere (Whatman) SAX or a 4.6 x 250-mm Adsorbosphere SAX column as indicated. For the Partisphere SAX column, reaction products were analyzed using a linear gradient from 10 mmto 1.7 m ammonium phosphate, pH 3.5, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, over 25 min, followed by isocratic elution with 1.7m ammonium phosphate for 25 min. For the Adsorbosphere SAX column, reaction products were analyzed using a linear gradient of 0–1.0 m ammonium phosphate, pH 3.5, over 120 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, using a modification of the method of Hughes et al. (27Hughes P.J. Hughes A.R. Putney Jr., J.W. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19871-19878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactivity from both columns was measured using an inline detector β-RAM (IN/US System Inc.), and the individual inositol polyphosphates were assigned on the basis of coelution with known samples. The yeast strain YOL126 harboring a null mutation in IPK2(ipk2Δ) was transformed with plasmids carrying human InsP4 5-kinase, S. cerevisiae IPK2, or an empty vector. Strains were grown to late logarithmic phase in synthetic complete medium containing 2% glucose (uninduced) or 2% galactose (induced) and 30 μCi/ml [3H]inositol. Soluble inositol phosphates were isolated as described previously (28Stolz L.E. Kuo W.J. Longchamps J. Sekhon M.K. York J.D. J. Biol.

Samples were separated by HPLC over a Partisphere SAX column (Whatman, 4.6 × 125 mm) using a 25-min linear gradient from 10 mm to 1.7m ammonium phosphate, pH 3.5, followed by another 25 min at 1.7 m. Peaks were identified by comparison with known inositol phosphate standards. The yeast strain SWY1852 carrying synthetically lethal mutations ingle1-2 and ipk2-3 covered bypGLE1/URA3/ADE3 was transformed with plasmids carrying human InsP4 5-kinase or S. cerevisiae IPK2. The ability of the resulting strains to survive without pGLE1/URA3/ADE3 was tested by growth on medium containing 2% galactose and 1.0 mg/ml 5-FOA. Growth was compared with the parental strain and control strains with either a wild-type URA3 or ura3mutation. Because the yeast Ipk2p and rat IPMK proteins catalyzed the synthesis of inositol pentakisphosphate, we postulated that the human homolog might function as an InsP4 kinase. Using the sequence of rat IPMK, a human EST (GenBank accession number BC016612) was identified. The EST contained a series of 7 adenosines at bp 446–452 compared with 6 adenosines found in the genomic sequence located on chromosome 10 (data not shown). The homology of the rat sequence extended to the entire ORF using the chromosomal sequence, suggesting that the EST sequence was in error (Fig. 1). Hence, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to produce the correct sequence of 6 adenosines. The human InsP4 5-kinase cDNA contains a putative ORF of 1251 bp encoding 416 amino acids (estimated 47.2 kDa); the encoded amino acids are 83.6% identical compared with the rat IPMK and 15.8% compared with the yeast Ipk2p (Fig. 1). Amino acids 140–148 (gray box in Fig. 1) contained the conserved sequence P-X-X-X-D-X-K-X-G demonstrated previously as the putative binding site that catalyzes the transfer of phosphate from ATP to inositol phosphates (29Bertsch U.

Northern blot analysis of different human tissues revealed two transcripts of ∼6 and 4 kb which were expressed ubiquitously in all tissues tested; however, the highest expression was seen in the liver, followed by skeletal muscle, placenta, and peripheral blood leukocytes (Fig.2). A similar result was obtained using Multiple Tissue Expression Arrays (data not shown). Hence, Northern blot analysis indicated ubiquitous endogenous expression of the identified human InsP4 5-kinase. Interestingly, the tissue expression of the rat IPMK is quite different with highest expression in kidney and brain (13Saiardi A. Nagata E. Luo H.R. Sawa A. Luo X. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2306-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); the significance of this difference is unclear at this time. The human InsP45-kinase was subcloned into a His-tagged expression system, expressed in E. coli with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction, and purified using a cobalt-based metal affinity resin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The expression of the N-terminal His-tagged InsP4 5-kinase was verified by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using anti-Xpress-horseradish peroxidase antibody (Invitrogen); the purified recombinant human InsP4 5-kinase accounted for greater than 75% of the protein in the purified fraction as determined by Coomassie Blue staining (data not shown). The purified InsP4 5-kinase phosphorylated Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 to produce Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5, whereas proteins isolated from bacterial cells containing vector alone did not exhibit any inositol phosphorylation activity (data not shown). This result established that the inositol kinase activity was from the His-tagged human InsP4 5-kinase and not from the copurified E. coli proteins. Previous reports of the yeast Ipk2p and rat IPMK predicted multiple substrate specificity and catalysis of sequential phosphorylations to yield Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 (4Odom A.R. Stahlberg A. Wente S.R. York J.D. Science. 2000; 287: 2026-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 13Saiardi A. Nagata E. Luo H.R. Sawa A. Luo X. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Either 5 or 40 ng of human InsP4 5-kinase was incubated with 200 nmIns(1,3,4,6)P4, 100 nmIns(1,3,4,5)P4, and 100 nmIns(1,4,5)P3 as substrates for 5 min at 37 °C (for details, see Fig. 3). The InsP4 5-kinase was able to synthesize InsP5from both isomers of InsP4 (Fig. 3, B andC) and InsP4 from Ins(1,4,5)P3 (Fig.3 D). Interestingly, the Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 was the best substrate compared with Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and Ins(1,4,5)P3 (note 8-fold less enzyme used in 3Bcompared with 3C and 3D), and the Ins(1,4,5)P3 reaction did not produce any InsP5or PP-InsP4 (Fig. 3 D). The small peak at the InsP5 elution position was not significantly above the background. Ins(1,3,4)P3 was not a substrate (data not shown). The human InsP4 5-kinase exhibited a substrate preference for Ins(1,3,4,6)P4. To identify the products of InsP4 5-kinase definitively, an Adsorbosphere SAX HPLC column was used which can resolve different isomers of the higher phosphorylated inositol phosphates. The human InsP45-kinase catalyzed the conversion of Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 to Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5, as shown by coelution with standard [32P]Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 on HPLC (Fig.4). Our initial experiment using Ins(1,4,5)P3 as substrate synthesized no detectable amounts of InsP5 or PP-InsP4; hence, the InsP4 5-kinase was incubated with the substrate Ins(1,4,5)P3 as function of time. The production of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 was identified by coelution with the [32P]Ins(1,3,4,5,)P4 standard (Fig. 5,B–D); additionally, the InsP4 product was dephosphorylated by the 5-phosphatase OCRL (33Zhang X. Jefferson A.B. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4853-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 E). This further supported Ins(1,3,4,5,)P4 as the product and eliminated Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 as a product because Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 would be resistant to dephosphorylation by 5-phosphatase. Interestingly, neither the production of InsP5 nor that of PP-InsP4 was observed (Fig. 5 D). Hence, human InsP4 5-kinase was shown to have 5-kinase and 3-kinase activity. No 6-kinase activity was seen using our experimental conditions.Figure 5Identification of the InsP45-kinase reaction product with Ins(1,4,5)P3 as substrate.

https://openalex.org/W2144147476,"Functional studies of the protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) regulator Sds22 suggest that it is indirectly and/or directly involved in one of the most ancient functions of PP1,i.e. reversing phosphorylation by the Aurora-related protein kinases. We predict that the conserved portion of Sds22 folds into a curved superhelix and demonstrate that mutation to alanine of any of eight residues (Asp148, Phe170, Glu192, Phe214, Asp280, Glu300, Trp302, or Tyr327) at the concave surface of this superhelix thwarts the interaction with PP1. Furthermore, we show that all mammalian isoforms of PP1 have the potential to bind Sds22. Interaction studies with truncated versions of PP1 and with chimeric proteins comprising fragments of PP1 and the yeast PP1-like protein phosphatase Ppz1 suggest that the site(s) required for the binding of Sds22 reside between residues 43 and 173 of PP1γ1. Within this region, a major interaction site was mapped to a triangular region delineated by the α4-, α5-, and α6-helices. Our data also show that well known regulatory binding sites of PP1, such as the RVXF-binding channel, the β12/β13-loop, and the acidic groove, are not essential for the interaction with Sds22.

Among the protein phosphatases that occur in all studied eukaryotic lineages, the Ser/Thr-specific protein phosphatases of type-1 are the best conserved, with more than 70% of their residues nearly invariant (1Ceulemans H. Stalmans W. Bollen M. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 371-381Google Scholar). This conservation extends well beyond structurally and catalytically important residues to include exposed residues involved in the binding of regulatory proteins. As a catalytic subunit, PP1 1The abbreviations used are: PP1, protein phosphatase-1; BLAST, basic local alignment search tool; CC, cysteine containing; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; RI, ribonuclease inhibitor; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside 1The abbreviations used are: PP1, protein phosphatase-1; BLAST, basic local alignment search tool; CC, cysteine containing; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; RI, ribonuclease inhibitor; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside depends on the interaction with one or two regulatory subunits for subcellular localization, substrate specificity, and activity regulation (1Ceulemans H. Stalmans W. Bollen M. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 371-381Google Scholar, 2Bollen M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 426-431Google Scholar). Eukaryotic cells contain a large variety of regulatory subunits of PP1, which account for the diversified action of this phosphatase. We have recently proposed that PP1 acquired an essential function during early eukaryotic evolution by the development of sites for interaction with a primordial regulatory subunit(s) (1Ceulemans H. Stalmans W. Bollen M. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 371-381Google Scholar). This essential primordial function and the sequential acquirement of additional interaction sites and functions would then have impeded further mutation of the corresponding portion(s) of the surface. The phylogenetic distribution of PP1 indicates that this primordial function must have been acquired before the divergence of the extant eukaryotic lineages. One of the most ancient functions of PP1 is to dephosphorylate substrates of the Aurora-related protein kinases, and this is essential for the completion of mitosis (3Hsu J.Y. Sun Z.W. Li X. Reuben M. Tatchell K. Bishop D.K. Gruschow J.M. Brame C.J. Caldwell J.A. Hunt D.F. Lin R. Smith M.M. Allis C.D. Cell. 2000; 102: 279-291Google Scholar). The regulatory subunit(s) associated with this function of PP1 remain unknown, but the protein Sds22 (38 kDa) has emerged as a prime candidate. First, both yeast and mammalian Sds22 have been shown to interact with PP1 and to be part of a complex with PP1 that is enriched in the nucleus (4Hisamoto N. Frederick D.L. Sugimoto K. Tatchell K. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3767-3776Google Scholar, 5MacKelvie S.H. Andrews P.D. Stark M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3777-3785Google Scholar, 6Stone E.M. Yamano H. Kinoshita N.

Second, the Sds22 encoding gene was identified independently in fission and in budding yeast as an extra-copy suppressor of the temperature-sensitive mitotic arrest phenotypes that are associated with certain mutations of PP1 (4Hisamoto N. Frederick D.L. Sugimoto K. Tatchell K. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3767-3776Google Scholar, 5MacKelvie S.H. Andrews P.D. Stark M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3777-3785Google Scholar, 8Ohkura H. Yanagida M. Cell. 1991; 57: 997-1007Google Scholar). Deletion of the Sds22-encoding gene caused a similar mitotic arrest, and this phenotype could be complemented by the overexpression of PP1 (4Hisamoto N. Frederick D.L. Sugimoto K. Tatchell K. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3767-3776Google Scholar, 5MacKelvie S.H. Andrews P.D. Stark M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3777-3785Google Scholar, 8Ohkura H. Yanagida M. Cell. 1991; 57: 997-1007Google Scholar). Third, the conditionally lethal phenotype in budding yeast that was conferred by a loss-of-function mutation of the Aurora-related kinase Ipl1 (Ipl1–2), was largely relieved by the expression of certain temperature-sensitive mutant versions of Sds22 or PP1 (9Peggie M.W. MacKelvie S.H. Blocher A. Knatko E.V. Tatchell K. Stark M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 195-206Google Scholar, 10Francisco L. Wang W. Chan C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4731-4740Google Scholar). The mutant Sds22 version that rescued the Ipl1–2 phenotype showed a decreased ability to interact with PP1. The expression of this mutant Sds22 did not affect the cellular levels of PP1 or Sds22, but drastically reduced the nuclear level of PP1 and caused a redistribution of the nuclear pool of PP1 (9Peggie M.W. MacKelvie S.H. Blocher A. Knatko E.V. Tatchell K. Stark M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 195-206Google Scholar).Hitherto, little is known about the mechanism of interaction between Sds22 and PP1. Most known PP1 regulators contain a so-called “RVXF” motif with the consensus sequence [RK]X (0–1)[VI]X[FW], which binds to a hydrophobic channel of the catalytic subunit (1Ceulemans H. Stalmans W. Bollen M. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 371-381Google Scholar, 11Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Google Scholar). Sds22 lacks an RVXF motif but consists of a tandem array of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), which are established protein interaction modules (12Kobe B. Kajava A.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 725-732Google Scholar). In this paper, we demonstrate that the LRR-repeats of Sds22 are indeed essential for binding to PP1 and we propose that the LRRs assume the conformation of a curved superhelix ending in a C-terminal so-called LRR cap (13Ceulemans H. De Maeyer M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 349-351Google Scholar). Guided by this three-dimensional model and by the crystal structure of PP1, we have been able to map determinants of the Sds22-PP1 interaction at the concave surface of the Sds22 superhelix and in a triangle composed of α-helices 4, 5, and 6 of PP1.DISCUSSIONThe present study established that the conserved C-terminal three-fourths of Sds22, which are proposed to form a curved LRR superhelix fused to a C-terminal LRR-cap, suffice for binding to PP1. Nevertheless, the affinity of Sds22 for PP1 was significantly reduced by removal of the N terminus of Sds22. Strikingly, a similar N-terminal amputation of fission yeast Sds22 confers a temperature-sensitive mitotic defect (6Stone E.M. Yamano H. Kinoshita N. Yanagida M. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 13-26Google Scholar), which may also correlate with compromised binding to PP1. Possibly, the N terminus of Sds22 folds into an N-terminal LRR-cap, like the one observed in the structure of Internalin B, a prokaryotic LRR protein of the Sds22-like family (38Schubert W.D. Gobel G. Diepholz M. Darji A. Kloer D. Hain T. Chakraborty T. Wehland J. Domann E. Heinz D.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 783-794Google Scholar). Deletion of such a shielding cap may induce a distortion of some of the LRRs to avoid exposure of the hydrophobic core of the LRR-superhelix.Furthermore, a major bipartite interaction site for PP1, comprising residues Asp148, Phe170, Glu192, Phe214, Asp280, Glu300, Trp302, and Tyr327 of Sds22, was mapped to the concave surface of the superhelix. Indeed, mutation of any of these residues severely or completely compromised the interaction with PP1. The reproducibility of a selection of these yeast two-hybrid results was confirmed in co-immunoprecipitation experiments from mammalian cell lysates. Interestingly, in the four available crystal structures of LRR proteins in complex with macromolecular ligands, the concave side of the LRR-superhelix also functions as a binding site (35Price S.R. Evans P.R. Nagai K. Nature. 1998; 394: 645-650Google Scholar, 37Ho D.N. Coburn G.A. Kang Y. Cullen B.R. Georgiadis M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 1888-1893Google Scholar, 40Evdokimov A.G. Anderson D.E. Routzahn K.M. Waugh D.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 807-821Google Scholar,41Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1995; 374: 183-186Google Scholar).Conveniently, the concave surface can be quite confidently modeled in terms of general architecture and curvature because the proposed rigid ladder of hydrogen-bonded asparagine residues also restricts the curvature of the attached parallel β-sheet. It must, however, be noted that some uncertainty remains in terms of the twist of the sheet. While we have opted for a virtually untwisted sheet as observed in other eukaryotic proteins with Sds22-like LRRs and an LRR-cap, a modest right-handed twist of the sheet cannot be excluded. Such a twist occurs in the proteins Internalin B, which consists largely of Sds22-like LRRs (38Schubert W.D. Gobel G. Diepholz M. Darji A. Kloer D. Hain T. Chakraborty T. Wehland J. Domann E. Heinz D.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 783-794Google Scholar), and YopM, which has shorter LRRs of the so-called bacterial class (42Papageorgiou A.C. Shapiro R. Acharya K.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5162-5177Google Scholar). The right-handed twist of these proteins has been tentatively explained by the repulsion of exposed negatively charged side-chains that occupy a fixed position in the second half of neighboring repeats (34Kajava A.V. Kobe B. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1082-1090Google Scholar). The Glu position in the consensus sequence of the Sds22 repeats may therefore induce a similar twist.We have also demonstrated that Sds22 can bind all mammalian isoforms of PP1. Given that most of the variance between these isoforms is concentrated in the N-terminal 40 and C-terminal 30 residues, this observation is in line with our conclusion that the N terminus of PP1 does not function as a binding site for Sds22. Nevertheless, removal of the N terminus proved detrimental to the interaction, probably because of a structural distortion of the truncated protein. Further deletion and alanine-scanning studies and experiments with chimeric PP1/Ppz1 proteins suggest that the essential Sds22-binding sites are located between residues 43–173 of PP1γ1, which rules out several classical interaction sites such as the RVXF-binding channel, the β12/β13-loop, and the acidic groove as essential determinants of the interaction. In accordance with our results, it has recently been shown that point mutations in the RVXF-binding channel that impeded binding of RVXF-containing PP1 regulators did not compromise the interaction with Sds22 (43Wu X. Tatchell K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7410-7420Google Scholar). In fact, for our mapping we exploited the observation that PP1γ1-Δ286–323 yielded a stronger interaction signal in yeast two-hybrid assays than did the wild-type. Because no stronger signal was obtained with PP1γ1-Δ297–323, this effect cannot be ascribed to the deletion of the flexible C terminus of PP1 but is indeed caused by the deletion of residues 286–296 that include the β14-strand. Given that RVXF-binding is disrupted by this deletion, it is likely that the binding of Sds22 to this truncated version of PP1 is facilitated by the elimination of interactions with RVXF-containing subunits that are incompatible with Sds22 binding. However, it cannot be ruled out that deletion of residues 286–296 relieves some sterical hindrance of the Sds22-PP1 interaction. A third explanation, namely that this deletion introduces an artificial binding site for Sds22 is highly unlikely. Indeed, such a site would comprise previously unexposed elements, and the crystal structure of PP1 (11Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Google Scholar) shows that these elements must have been eliminated in PP1γ1-Δ270–323 and PP1γ1-Δ249–323, which yield a similarly enhanced interaction signal. Moreover, the point mutations in Sds22 that compromise the binding to PP1γ1-Δ286–323 also impede binding to wild-type PP1γ1.The observation that the C-terminal half of PP1, including all residues that contribute to the RVXF-binding channel, is not required for the interaction with Sds22 raises the interesting possibility that in Sds22-associated PP1 this channel is free for interaction with a specific additional RVXF-containing subunit. For instance, the unidentified phosphoprotein of 25 kDa that co-purifies with Sds22 and PP1 from fission yeast (6Stone E.M. Yamano H. Kinoshita N. Yanagida M. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 13-26Google Scholar), may constitute a third component of the Sds22 complex. Other trimeric PP1 holoenzymes are known that contain an RVXF-containing and an RVXF-less regulator, such as the CPI-17·Mypt1·PP1 complex (30Li L. Eto M. Lee M.R. Morita F. Yazawa M. Kitazawa T. J. Physiol. 1998; 508: 871-881Google Scholar).We also confirmed earlier observations that Sds22-associated PP1 largely lacks phosphorylase phosphatase activity (7Dinischiotu A. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 141-144Google Scholar, 25Hong G. Trumby R.J. Reimann E.M. Schlender K.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 288-298Google Scholar). This, however, does not necessarily imply that Sds22 is a negative regulator of PP1 since the effects of various regulators is well known to be substrate-dependent (2Bollen M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 426-431Google Scholar). It can indeed be envisaged that the binding of Sds22 to the α4/α5/α6-triangle of PP1 restricts the accessibility of the catalytic site to its physiological substrate(s) and thus blocks out other PP1 substrates, such as phosphorylase a.In summary, we have gained insight into the complex interaction mechanism that governs the binding of Sds22 to PP1 and have charted major binding sites on both interaction partners. Among the protein phosphatases that occur in all studied eukaryotic lineages, the Ser/Thr-specific protein phosphatases of type-1 are the best conserved, with more than 70% of their residues nearly invariant (1Ceulemans H. Stalmans W. Bollen M. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 371-381Google Scholar). This conservation extends well beyond structurally and catalytically important residues to include exposed residues involved in the binding of regulatory proteins.

One of the most ancient functions of PP1 is to dephosphorylate substrates of the Aurora-related protein kinases, and this is essential for the completion of mitosis (3Hsu J.Y. Sun Z.W. Li X. Reuben M. Tatchell K. Bishop D.K. Gruschow J.M. Brame C.J. Caldwell J.A. Hunt D.F. Lin R. Smith M.M. Allis C.D. Cell. 2000; 102: 279-291Google Scholar). The regulatory subunit(s) associated with this function of PP1 remain unknown, but the protein Sds22 (38 kDa) has emerged as a prime candidate. First, both yeast and mammalian Sds22 have been shown to interact with PP1 and to be part of a complex with PP1 that is enriched in the nucleus (4Hisamoto N. Frederick D.L. Sugimoto K. Tatchell K. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3767-3776Google Scholar, 5MacKelvie S.H. Andrews P.D. Stark M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3777-3785Google Scholar, 6Stone E.M. Yamano H. Kinoshita N. Yanagida M. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 13-26Google Scholar, 7Dinischiotu A. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 141-144Google Scholar). Second, the Sds22 encoding gene was identified independently in fission and in budding yeast as an extra-copy suppressor of the temperature-sensitive mitotic arrest phenotypes that are associated with certain mutations of PP1 (4Hisamoto N. Frederick D.L. Sugimoto K. Tatchell K. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3767-3776Google Scholar, 5MacKelvie S.H. Andrews P.D. Stark M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3777-3785Google Scholar, 8Ohkura H. Yanagida M. Cell. 1991; 57: 997-1007Google Scholar). Deletion of the Sds22-encoding gene caused a similar mitotic arrest, and this phenotype could be complemented by the overexpression of PP1 (4Hisamoto N. Frederick D.L. Sugimoto K. Tatchell K. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3767-3776Google Scholar, 5MacKelvie S.H. Andrews P.D. Stark M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3777-3785Google Scholar, 8Ohkura H. Yanagida M. Cell. 1991; 57: 997-1007Google Scholar). Third, the conditionally lethal phenotype in budding yeast that was conferred by a loss-of-function mutation of the Aurora-related kinase Ipl1 (Ipl1–2), was largely relieved by the expression of certain temperature-sensitive mutant versions of Sds22 or PP1 (9Peggie M.W. MacKelvie S.H. Blocher A. Knatko E.V. Tatchell K. Stark M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 195-206Google Scholar, 10Francisco L. Wang W. Chan C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4731-4740Google Scholar). The mutant Sds22 version that rescued the Ipl1–2 phenotype showed a decreased ability to interact with PP1. The expression of this mutant Sds22 did not affect the cellular levels of PP1 or Sds22, but drastically reduced the nuclear level of PP1 and caused a redistribution of the nuclear pool of PP1 (9Peggie M.W. MacKelvie S.H. Blocher A. Knatko E.V. Tatchell K. Stark M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 195-206Google Scholar). Hitherto, little is known about the mechanism of interaction between Sds22 and PP1. Most known PP1 regulators contain a so-called “RVXF” motif with the consensus sequence [RK]X (0–1)[VI]X[FW], which binds to a hydrophobic channel of the catalytic subunit (1Ceulemans H. Stalmans W. Bollen M. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 371-381Google Scholar, 11Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Google Scholar). Sds22 lacks an RVXF motif but consists of a tandem array of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), which are established protein interaction modules (12Kobe B. Kajava A.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 725-732Google Scholar). In this paper, we demonstrate that the LRR-repeats of Sds22 are indeed essential for binding to PP1 and we propose that the LRRs assume the conformation of a curved superhelix ending in a C-terminal so-called LRR cap (13Ceulemans H. De Maeyer M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 349-351Google Scholar). Guided by this three-dimensional model and by the crystal structure of PP1, we have been able to map determinants of the Sds22-PP1 interaction at the concave surface of the Sds22 superhelix and in a triangle composed of α-helices 4, 5, and 6 of PP1. DISCUSSIONThe present study established that the conserved C-terminal three-fourths of Sds22, which are proposed to form a curved LRR superhelix fused to a C-terminal LRR-cap, suffice for binding to PP1. Nevertheless, the affinity of Sds22 for PP1 was significantly reduced by removal of the N terminus of Sds22. Strikingly, a similar N-terminal amputation of fission yeast Sds22 confers a temperature-sensitive mitotic defect (6Stone E.M. Yamano H. Kinoshita N. Yanagida M. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 13-26Google Scholar), which may also correlate with compromised binding to PP1. Possibly, the N terminus of Sds22 folds into an N-terminal LRR-cap, like the one observed in the structure of Internalin B, a prokaryotic LRR protein of the Sds22-like family (38Schubert W.D. Gobel G. Diepholz M. Darji A. Kloer D. Hain T. Chakraborty T. Wehland J. Domann E. Heinz D.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 783-794Google Scholar). Deletion of such a shielding cap may induce a distortion of some of the LRRs to avoid exposure of the hydrophobic core of the LRR-superhelix.Furthermore, a major bipartite interaction site for PP1, comprising residues Asp148, Phe170, Glu192, Phe214, Asp280, Glu300, Trp302, and Tyr327 of Sds22, was mapped to the concave surface of the superhelix. Indeed, mutation of any of these residues severely or completely compromised the interaction with PP1. The reproducibility of a selection of these yeast two-hybrid results was confirmed in co-immunoprecipitation experiments from mammalian cell lysates. Interestingly, in the four available crystal structures of LRR proteins in complex with macromolecular ligands, the concave side of the LRR-superhelix also functions as a binding site (35Price S.R. Evans P.R. Nagai K. Nature. 1998; 394: 645-650Google Scholar, 37Ho D.N. Coburn G.A. Kang Y. Cullen B.R. Georgiadis M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 1888-1893Google Scholar, 40Evdokimov A.G. Anderson D.E. Routzahn K.M. Waugh D.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 807-821Google Scholar,41Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1995; 374: 183-186Google Scholar).Conveniently, the concave surface can be quite confidently modeled in terms of general architecture and curvature because the proposed rigid ladder of hydrogen-bonded asparagine residues also restricts the curvature of the attached parallel β-sheet. It must, however, be noted that some uncertainty remains in terms of the twist of the sheet. While we have opted for a virtually untwisted sheet as observed in other eukaryotic proteins with Sds22-like LRRs and an LRR-cap, a modest right-handed twist of the sheet cannot be excluded. Such a twist occurs in the proteins Internalin B, which consists largely of Sds22-like LRRs (38Schubert W.D. Gobel G. Diepholz M. Darji A. Kloer D. Hain T. Chakraborty T. Wehland J. Domann E. Heinz D.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 783-794Google Scholar), and YopM, which has shorter LRRs of the so-called bacterial class (42Papageorgiou A.C. Shapiro R. Acharya K.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5162-5177Google Scholar). The right-handed twist of these proteins has been tentatively explained by the repulsion of exposed negatively charged side-chains that occupy a fixed position in the second half of neighboring repeats (34Kajava A.V. Kobe B. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1082-1090Google Scholar). The Glu position in the consensus sequence of the Sds22 repeats may therefore induce a similar twist.We have also demonstrated that Sds22 can bind all mammalian isoforms of PP1. Given that most of the variance between these isoforms is concentrated in the N-terminal 40 and C-terminal 30 residues, this observation is in line with our conclusion that the N terminus of PP1 does not function as a binding site for Sds22. Nevertheless, removal of the N terminus proved detrimental to the interaction, probably because of a structural distortion of the truncated protein. Further deletion and alanine-scanning studies and experiments with chimeric PP1/Ppz1 proteins suggest that the essential Sds22-binding sites are located between residues 43–173 of PP1γ1, which rules out several classical interaction sites such as the RVXF-binding channel, the β12/β13-loop, and the acidic groove as essential determinants of the interaction. In accordance with our results, it has recently been shown that point mutations in the RVXF-binding channel that impeded binding of RVXF-containing PP1 regulators did not compromise the interaction with Sds22 (43Wu X. Tatchell K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7410-7420Google Scholar). In fact, for our mapping we exploited the observation that PP1γ1-Δ286–323 yielded a stronger interaction signal in yeast two-hybrid assays than did the wild-type. Because no stronger signal was obtained with PP1γ1-Δ297–323, this effect cannot be ascribed to the deletion of the flexible C terminus of PP1 but is indeed caused by the deletion of residues 286–296 that include the β14-strand. Given that RVXF-binding is disrupted by this deletion, it is likely that the binding of Sds22 to this truncated version of PP1 is facilitated by the elimination of interactions with RVXF-containing subunits that are incompatible with Sds22 binding. However, it cannot be ruled out that deletion of residues 286–296 relieves some sterical hindrance of the Sds22-PP1 interaction. A third explanation, namely that this deletion introduces an artificial binding site for Sds22 is highly unlikely. Indeed, such a site would comprise previously unexposed elements, and the crystal structure of PP1 (11Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Google Scholar) shows that these elements must have been eliminated in PP1γ1-Δ270–323 and PP1γ1-Δ249–323, which yield a similarly enhanced interaction signal. Moreover, the point mutations in Sds22 that compromise the binding to PP1γ1-Δ286–323 also impede binding to wild-type PP1γ1.The observation that the C-terminal half of PP1, including all residues that contribute to the RVXF-binding channel, is not required for the interaction with Sds22 raises the interesting possibility that in Sds22-associated PP1 this channel is free for interaction with a specific additional RVXF-containing subunit. For instance, the unidentified phosphoprotein of 25 kDa that co-purifies with Sds22 and PP1 from fission yeast (6Stone E.M. Yamano H. Kinoshita N. Yanagida M. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 13-26Google Scholar), may constitute a third component of the Sds22 complex. Other trimeric PP1 holoenzymes are known that contain an RVXF-containing and an RVXF-less regulator, such as the CPI-17·Mypt1·PP1 complex (30Li L. Eto M. Lee M.R. Morita F. Yazawa M. Kitazawa T. J. Physiol. 1998; 508: 871-881Google Scholar).We also confirmed earlier observations that Sds22-associated PP1 largely lacks phosphorylase phosphatase activity (7Dinischiotu A. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 141-144Google Scholar, 25Hong G. Trumby R.J. Reimann E.M. Schlender K.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 288-298Google Scholar). This, however, does not necessarily imply that Sds22 is a negative regulator of PP1 since the effects of various regulators is well known to be substrate-dependent (2Bollen M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 426-431Google Scholar). It can indeed be envisaged that the binding of Sds22 to the α4/α5/α6-triangle of PP1 restricts the accessibility of the catalytic site to its physiological substrate(s) and thus blocks out other PP1 substrates, such as phosphorylase a.In summary, we have gained insight into the complex interaction mechanism that governs the binding of Sds22 to PP1 and have charted major binding sites on both interaction partners. The present study established that the conserved C-terminal three-fourths of Sds22, which are proposed to form a curved LRR superhelix fused to a C-terminal LRR-cap, suffice for binding to PP1. Nevertheless, the affinity of Sds22 for PP1 was significantly reduced by removal of the N terminus of Sds22.

With plasmid length DNA substrates, maximal DNA joint formation is observed with amounts of Rad51 substantially below what is needed to saturate the initiating single-stranded DNA template, and, relative to Rad51, Rad54 is needed in only catalytic quantities. RPA is still indispensable for optimal reaction efficiency, but its role in this instance is to sequester free single-stranded DNA, which otherwise inhibits Rad51 and Rad54 functions. We also demonstrate that Rad54 helps overcome various reaction constraints in DNA joint formation. These results thus shed light on the function of Rad54 in the Rad51-mediated homologous DNA pairing reaction and also reveal a novel role of RPA in the presynaptic stage of this reaction.

Aside from contributing to the creation of genetic diversity, homologous recombination is indispensable for DNA double-stranded break repair, meiosis I, and for various aspects of telomere homeostasis. Genetic studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been chiefly responsible for identifying the components of the recombination machinery. These recombination genes (RAD50,RAD51, RAD52, RAD54, RAD55,RAD57, RAD59, RDH54/TID1,MRE11, and XRS2) are collectively referred to as the RAD52 epistasis group. Gene cloning, genetic analyses, and biochemical studies have revealed a remarkable degree of conservation of the RAD52 group, from yeast to humans (1Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 570-603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Cromie G.A. Connelly J.C. Leach D.R. Mol.

In mammals, members of the RAD52 group interact with the tumor suppressors BRCA1 and BRCA2, which in turn influence the activities of their partner recombination factors and the efficiency of recombination (5Dasika G.K.

The latter observations underscore the importance for deciphering the functions of individual recombination factors and the mechanism of the protein machine comprising these factors. Results from combined genetic and biochemical studies have suggested the following sequence of events in recombination. Following the introduction of a DNA double-stranded break, the ends of the break are processed nucleolytically to generate long single-stranded tails that have a 3′ extremity. Mre11, working in conjunction with Rad50 and Xrs2, provides the nuclease function for the formation of the 3′ ssDNA 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; RPA, replication protein A 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; RPA, replication protein Atails. Rad51, the eukaryotic equivalent of the Escherichia coli general recombinase RecA, nucleates onto the ssDNA tails to form a right-handed nucleoprotein filament. The Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament then conducts a search for a chromosomal homolog, either the sister chromatid or the homologous chromosome. Pairing between the initiating ssDNA tails and the complementary strand in the duplex partner yields heteroduplex DNA joints, followed by extension of the joints by branch migration. The biochemical reaction responsible for DNA homology search and the formation of heteroduplex DNA joints is commonly called “homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange” (1Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 570-603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sung P. Trujillo K.M. Van Komen S. Mutat.

In the homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange reaction, the assembly of the Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament is referred to as the presynaptic phase. Rad52 and the Rad55-Rad57 complex are recombination mediators that promote the assembly of the Rad51-ssDNA presynaptic nucleoprotein filament (4Sung P. Trujillo K.M. Van Komen S. Mutat.

In the post-synaptic phase, the Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament cooperates with Rad54 and Rdh54 (also called Tid1) to form DNA joints (12Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P.

The negative supercoils produced by Rad54 and Rdh54 lead to transient DNA strand opening, believed to be germane for the promotion of DNA joint formation (15Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sigurdsson S.

Interestingly, Rad51 enhances the DNA supercoiling and DNA strand opening activities of Rad54 (15Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sigurdsson S. Stratton S. Sung P. Mol.

Whereas a good body of information concerning the biochemical properties of the RAD52 group proteins has accumulated in recent years, the manner in which these recombination factors functionally interact with one another and with the DNA substrates to achieve the maximal efficiency of DNA joint formation has remained mysterious. Here we present results that shed light on the synergistic interactions among Rad51, Rad54, RPA, and the ssDNA substrate in the initial stages of recombination. The results also reveal a new role of RPA in the homologous DNA pairing reaction. Rad51 and Rad54 proteins were overexpressed in yeast cells and purified to near homogeneity as described previously (12Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P.

RPA was overexpressed in yeast using three plasmids that code for the three subunits of RPA (18Nakagawa T. Flores-Rozas H. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31487-31493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and purified to near homogeneity as described (19Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The concentrations of Rad51 and RPA were determined using extinction coefficients of 1.29 × 104 and 8.8 × 104 at 280 nm, respectively (20Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The concentration of Rad54 was determined by densitometric scanning of SDS-PAGE gels of multiple loadings of purified Rad54 against known quantities of bovine serum albumin and ovalbumin. The φX174 (+) strand and replicative form I DNA were purchased from New England Biolabs and Invitrogen, respectively. The replicative form DNA was linearized by treatment withApaLI or StuI to yield linear duplex substrates that have either 3′ 4-base overhangs or blunt ends, respectively. Linearization of the viral (+) strand was done by hybridizing a 26-mer oligonucleotide to create a PstI site, followed by treatment with PstI (12Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The pBluescript (+) strand and replicative form DNA were prepared as described previously (21Petukhova G. Stratton S.A. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33839-33842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The pBluescript dsDNA used in Fig. 4 B was a 1712-bp fragment generated from the replicative form by treatment with ApaLI andBsaI; it was purified from 0.9% agarose gels as above. The pBluescript dsDNA used in Fig. 5 C was full-length replicative form DNA linearized with BsaI. The 90-mer oligonucleotide (5′-AAATCAATCTAAAGTATATATGAGTAAACTTGGTCTGACAGTTACCAATGCTTAATCAGTGAGGCACCTATCTCAGCGATCTGTCTATTT-3′) used for D-loop formation in Fig. 8 is complementary to pBluescript SK DNA from position 1932 to 2022. The oligonucleotide was 5′-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and then purified using the MERmaid Spin Kit (Bio 101). All of the DNA substrates were stored in TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.5 mmEDTA).Figure 5Effect of ssDNA on Rad51 and Rad54 functions. A, all of the incubations were carried out at 37 °C.

ATPase activity (open squares) with 150 nm Rad54 was also determined for the same concentration range of pBluescript ssDNA (0.9–28.7 μm nucleotides).

A, schematic of assay. A 90-mer 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (lss oligo) is paired with its homologous supercoiled DNA target (sc) to yield a D-loop. B,panel I, reaction schematic. The combination of Rad51 (2 μm) and Rad54 (0.04–1.6 μm) was mixed with the 90-mer oligonucleotide (6 μm nucleotides) in the presence of ATP. The reactions were preincubated for 10 min at either 23 or 37 °C prior to the addition of target duplex. The completed reaction mixtures were incubated at 23 °C for 5 min and processed for electrophoresis in 0.9% agarose gels. Panel II displays the reactions in which Rad51 and Rad54 were preincubated with the 90-mer oligonucleotide at 23 °C, whereaspanel III shows the reaction with the preincubation step done at 37 °C. C, the results inpanels II (lanes 5–14) andIII (lanes 5–14) of B are graphed as a function of Rad54 concentration and against the Rad51/Rad54 ratio, as shown. The level of reaction product is expressed as the percentage of the input single-stranded oligonucleotide incorporated into the D-loop structure. D, in one reaction (shaded squares), Rad51 was incubated with the 90-mer oligonucleotide for 8 min at 23 °C, followed by the addition of Rad54 and a 2-min incubation at 23 °C, before the pBluescript DNA was incorporated to complete the reaction mixture. In another reaction (closed circle), Rad51 and Rad54 were coincubated with the oligonucleotide for 10 min at 23 °C, and then the pBluescript DNA was incorporated to complete the reaction. In the third reaction (open triangles), Rad51 and Rad54 were coincubated with the oligonucleotide for 10 min at 37 °C, and then the pBluescript DNA was incorporated to complete the reaction. In all three cases, the completed reaction mixture was incubated at 23 °C, and aliquots were withdrawn at the indicated times and analyzed as described for B. The concentrations of reaction components were as follows: Rad51, 2 μm; Rad54, 150 nm; 90-mer oligonucleotide, 6 μm nucleotides or 67 nm oligonucleotides; pBluescript DNA, 65 μmbase pairs or 22 nm plasmid molecules.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Unless stated otherwise, the reactions containing Rad54 were carried out at 23 °C, and the reactions without Rad54 were carried out at 37 °C. In the standard reaction (12.5-μl final volume), circular φX (+)-strand (19.6 μm nucleotides) was incubated for 4 min in 10 μl of buffer R (35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 60 mm KCl, 2.5 mm ATP, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 20 mm creatine phosphate and 300 ng of creatine kinase) with the indicated amounts of Rad51 added in 0.5 μl of storage buffer. Following the incorporation of RPA in 0.5 μl of storage buffer and the indicated amounts of Rad54 in 0.3 μl of storage buffer and an additional 4-min incubation, ApaLI linearized dsDNA in 0.7 μl, and 1 μl of 50 mmspermidine hydrochloride (4 mm final concentration) was added to complete the reaction. For time course experiments, the reactions were scaled up accordingly, and unless stated otherwise, the same order of addition of reaction components was used. At the times indicated, 5-μl portions of the reaction mixtures were mixed with an equal volume of 1% SDS and then treated with proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C before being run in 0.9% agarose gels in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 0.5 mmEDTA) at 23 °C. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide and recorded in a Nucleotech gel documentation system. Quantitation of the data was done using the Gel Expert software. The standard D-loop reaction was assembled by preincubatingPstI-linearized φX ssDNA with Rad51 for 3 min, followed by the incorporation of RPA and an additional 3-min incubation. Rad54 was then added, and, following a 2-min incubation, φX replicative form DNA was incorporated to complete the reaction. All of the incubations were carried out at 23 °C, and the reaction mixtures were processed for electrophoresis as described above. Other details are given in the figure legends. Unless stated otherwise, Rad51 (2 μm) and the indicated amounts of Rad54 were incubated with the 5′-end-labeled 90-mer oligonucleotide (6 μm nucleotides or 67 nm oligonucleotide) in 11.5 μl of buffer R. The protein/DNA mixture was incubated for 10 min at either 23 or 37 °C, and D-loop formation was initiated by the addition of pBluescript SK replicative form DNA (65 μm base pairs or 22 nm plasmid molecules) in 1 μl. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 5 min at 23 °C and arrested by the addition of an equal volume of 1% SDS. The reactions were deproteinized with proteinase K as above before being subjected to electrophoresis in 0.9% agarose gels in TAE buffer at 23 °C. The gels were dried, and the level of D-loop was quantified in a Personal FX phosphor imager with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The results were plotted as the percentage of oligonucleotide that had been incorporated into the D-loop. For the order of addition experiments in Fig.8 D, the reactions were scaled up accordingly with the indicated amounts of components. In Fig. 4 B, panels I and II, the reaction mixtures (final volume of 14.5 μl) were assembled as described for the standard D-loop reaction, except that increasing concentrations of pBluescript circular ssDNA or linear duplex were added with the φX replicative form I DNA substrate in 3 μl of TE. In Fig. 4 B, panel III, the reaction mixtures (final volume of 14.5 μl) were assembled as described for panels I andII, except that the pBluescript ssDNA competitor (150 μm nucleotides) had been preincubated with RPA (9 μm) at 37 °C for 3 min in buffer R. The RPA-coated ssDNA competitor was then diluted with buffer R to the desired concentrations and added in 2 μl with the replicative form I DNA in 1 μl to the D-loop reactions. In Fig. 5, A and C, the reaction mixtures (final volume of 14.5 μl) were assembled as described for the model DNA strand exchange reaction, except that increasing concentrations of pBluescript ssDNA (Fig. 5 A,lanes 3–6) or pBluescript linear duplex (Fig.5 C, lanes 3–6 and 9–12) was added with the φX linear duplex in 3 μl of TE. In Fig.5 A, lanes 7–10, the pBluescript ssDNA competitor (150 μm nucleotides) had been preincubated with RPA (9 μm), as described above for Fig.4 B, and then added in 2 μl with the φX linear duplex in 1 μl of TE to the reaction. In Fig. 1 A, Rad54 (150 nm), in 8 μl of buffer A (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, 45 mm KCl, and 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin), that had or had not been preincubated either at 37 or 23 °C was mixed with φX replicative form DNA (30 μmbase pairs) and 1.5 mm [γ-32P]ATP (AmershamBiosciences) in 2 μl. Where indicated, dsDNA or ATP was also present during the preincubation of Rad54 at 37 °C. The reactions (10 μl) were incubated at 23 °C, and at the indicated times a 1.5-μl aliquot was removed and mixed with an equal volume of 500 mm EDTA to halt the reaction. The amount of ATP hydrolysis was determined by thin layer chromatography, as described (12Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of Rad51 on the thermal stability of Rad54 (Fig.1 B), the combination of Rad51 (2 μm) and Rad54 (75 nm), in 8 μl of buffer A, that had or had not been preincubated at 23 °C or 37 °C as above was mixed with φX replicative form DNA (30 μm base pairs) and 1.5 mm [γ-32P] ATP in 2 μl. In Fig. 5 D, Rad54 (150 nm) was incubated for 15 min at 23 °C with 1.5 mm [γ-32P]ATP and the indicated amounts of ssDNA (0.9, 3.6, 7.2, 14.4, or 28.7 μm nucleotides) in 10 μl of buffer A. Rad54 (150 nm) was also similarly incubated with φX replicative form DNA (30 μm base pairs) and the indicated amounts of pBluescript ssDNA (0.9, 3.6, 7.2, 14.4, and 28.7 μmnucleotides). To examine the effect of precoating the pBluescript ssDNA competitor with RPA, the ssDNA (150 μm nucleotides) was incubated with RPA (9 μm) at 37 °C for 5 min in buffer A, diluted with the appropriate volume of buffer A, before being incorporated with the φX replicative form DNA (30 μmbase pairs) in 2 μl into the ATPase reactions. The completed reactions (10 μl) were incubated at 23 °C for 15 min. In Fig. 3 A, panel III, the ATPase assay was performed as described for the model D-loop reaction with 660 nm Rad54, 1.4 μm Rad51, 1.3 μmRPA, and [γ-32P]ATP, either with or without the ATP-regenerating system consisting of 20 mm creatine phosphate and 300 ng of creatine kinase. The rate of dsDNA-activated ATP hydrolysis by Rad54 was linear with time for at least 12 min at 23 °C (Fig.1 A). Preincubation of Rad54 at 37 °C in the absence of ATP and dsDNA for brief periods caused a dramatic decrease in ATP hydrolysis in reactions conducted at 23 °C, whereas preincubation of Rad54 at 23 °C had no effect on the ATPase activity (Fig. 1 A). These results indicate that the Rad54 ATPase function is prone to denaturation at 37 °C. Whereas ATP had only a very slight protective effect against thermal denaturation of Rad54 (Fig. 1 A), dsDNA exhibited a modest protective effect (Fig. 1 A). Although Rad51 physically interacts with Rad54 (12Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 22Jiang H. Xie Y. Houston P. Stemke-Hale K.

Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 583-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), it did not prevent thermal denaturation of Rad54 (Fig. 1 A). In the homologous DNA pairing reaction, preincubation of Rad54 or the combination of Rad51 and Rad54 at 37 °C for brief periods also greatly diminished the extent of the reaction (see below). By contrast, Rad51 is stable for at least 30 min at 37 °C, as gauged by its ATPase and homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange activities (data not shown). Thus, Rad54 is quite unstable at 37 °C, and because of this, all of the reactions involving Rad54 were routinely carried out at 23 °C, where it is much more stable. Furthermore, since homologous pairing by Rad51 and Rad54 occurs efficiently, the use of a relatively low reaction temperature also allowed us to follow the reaction kinetics with greater ease. In the model homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange reaction that employs circular ssDNA and linear duplex (see Fig. 2 A,panel I, for schematic) but contains no Rad54, maximal reaction efficiency is observed at 3 nucleotides per Rad51 monomer (Fig. 2 B, panels I andIII) (20Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 24Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The optimal ratio of Rad51 to ssDNA in this model reaction corresponds to the ssDNA binding site size of Rad51 (25Zaitseva E.M. Zaitsev E.N. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2907-2915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it has been generally assumed that a contiguous Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament is needed for achieving maximal homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange. The stoichiometric relationship between Rad51 and the ssDNA substrate in the D-loop reaction (see Fig. 2 A, panel II, for schematic) was examined here. Amounts of Rad51 varying from 30 to 3.2 nucleotides of ssDNA per protein monomer (0.66–6.1 μm Rad51 and 19.6 μm nucleotides of ssDNA) were used with a concentration of Rad54 (150 nm) sufficient to afford robust homologous DNA pairing. Surprisingly, maximal homologous pairing (see Fig. 2 B, panels II and III) occurred over the range of 15 to 9 nucleotides/Rad51 monomer, which is substantially below the ratio of 3 nucleotides/Rad51 monomer needed for the formation of a contiguous Rad51 filament. In fact, increasing the Rad51 amount to 3 nucleotides/protein monomer consistently led to a greater than 3-fold decrease in the amount of D-loop (Fig. 2 B, panels II and III). We note that whereas at 30 nucleotides/Rad51 monomer a substantial level of D-loop was obtained (Fig. 2 B, panel II, lane 2), only a trace of reaction product was formed by an amount of Rad51 corresponding to 7.4 nucleotides/Rad51 monomer in the model reaction that did not contain Rad54 (Fig. 2 B,panel I, lane 2). We have also examined the dependence of D-loop formation on the Rad51 amount with concentrations of Rad54 higher and lower than that used in the experiment above. Under those conditions, we again found that Rad51 amounts from ∼15 to 9 nucleotides per protein monomer were optimal and that increasing the Rad51 level beyond this optimal range resulted in a similar degree of reduction of D-loop as in Fig. 2 B(data not shown). Turnover of RecA from the bound ssDNA occurs when the ssDNA is linear (9Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If there had been sufficient Rad51 dissociating from the linear ssDNA substrate in the D-loop reaction, the free Rad51 pool could have sequestered the dsDNA from pairing with the ssDNA (24Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). To help eliminate this caveat, we examined the pairing between a circular ssDNA with linear duplex (Fig. 2 A, panel I) in the presence of Rad54. In this case, the stoichiometric relationship between Rad51 and the ssDNA (Fig. 2 C) closely resembled that seen in the D-loop experiment (Fig. 2 B, panel II) (i.e. with the optimal concentration range of Rad51 at ∼15 to 9 nucleotides per protein monomer and the reaction efficiency gradually decreasing with elevating Rad51 amounts). In aggregate, the new data demonstrate that homologous pairing catalyzed by the combination of Rad51 and Rad54 does not require a contiguous Rad51 filament. In fact, suppression of DNA joint formation occurs when a full Rad51 filament is allowed to assemble. Although a quantity of Rad54 substoichiometric to Rad51 affords a robust homologous pairing reaction (12Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 15Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sigurdsson S. Stratton S. Sung P. Mol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 29453-29462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2), we examined whether higher amounts of Rad54 would further enhance the reaction. Although an ATP-regenerating system was included in the pairing assays, to ensure that the increased amounts of Rad54 did not cause a depletion of the ATP pool, we also monitored the level of free ATP by thin layer chromatography. As shown in Fig.3 A, panels I and II, the optimal level of Rad54 was between 82.5 and 300 nm, substantially below that of Rad51 (1.4 μm) used. Importantly, increasing the amount of Rad54 to 660 nm in fact suppressed joint formation greatly. For example, after 2.5 min of incubation, whereas ∼40% of the replicative form DNA had been converted to D loop at 82.5 nm of Rad54, a ratio of Rad51/Rad54 of 17 (Fig.3 A, panel I, lane 3; panel II), only ∼4% of D-loop formation was observed at 660 nm Rad54, a ratio of Rad51/Rad54 of 2.1 (Fig. 3 A, panel I,lane 10; panel II). Even at the highest concentration of Rad54, the ATP level never dropped below 98% of the nucleotide pool (Fig. 3 A, panel III). We also investigated whether maximal D-loop formation would require more Rad54 at a Rad51 concentration (4 μm) significantly higher than that used in Fig. 3 A (1.4 μm). However, even with the increase"

Although the subunit size of ryanodine receptors (∼560 kDa) is almost twice that of IP3 receptors (∼300 kDa), these ubiquitous intracellular Ca2+ channels display several similarities in their structure and function. Multiple hydrophobic stretches of amino acids at the extreme C terminus of both receptors form the transmembrane region encompassing the Ca2+ channel, and it is within this region that the highest degree of sequence similarity between these proteins is found (7Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C. Takei K. De Camilli P. Nature. 1989; 342: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 8Furuichi T. Yoshikawa S. Miyawaki A. Wada K. Maeda M. Mikoshiba K. Nature. 1989; 342: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Both proteins assemble as tetrameric complexes with native molecular weights in excess of 1000 kDa (7Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C.

Nature. 1988; 331: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IP3 and ryanodine receptors are regulated by interactions with a range of accessory proteins including calmodulin (10Patel S. Morris S.A. Adkins C.E. O'Beirne G. Taylor C.W. Proc. Natl.

Modest elevations in cytosolic Ca2+ are stimulatory resulting in Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release whereas higher concentrations of Ca2+ inhibit Ca2+ release (18Iino M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 190: 185-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dual regulation of IP3 and ryanodine receptors by their respective ligand and Ca2+ provides intricate control of channel function and is central to the generation of complex spatio-temporal Ca2+ signals (19Thomas A.P. Bird G.St.J. Hajnóczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Putney Jr., J.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Sea urchin egg homogenates contain readily accessible functional Ca2+ stores providing an ideal experimental tool for the study of intracellular Ca2+ release pathways (20Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9561-9568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this preparation, both IP3 and cADPR effect robust release of sequestered Ca2+ through activation of IP3 and ryanodine receptors, respectively. In addition, recent studies have uncovered a third intracellular Ca2+ release pathway activated by nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) (21Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar,22Chini E.N. Beers K.W. Dousa T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3216-3223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). That this pathway is not modulated by changes in cytosolic Ca2+ clearly distinguishes it from IP3- and cADPR-mediated Ca2+ release (23Chini E.N. Dousa T.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 709-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 24Genazzani A.A. Galione A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Indeed, NAADP-induced Ca2+ mobilization is demonstrable in the presence of specific IP3/cADPR antagonists (21Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 22Chini E.N. Beers K.W. Dousa T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3216-3223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), after depletion of IP3 and ryanodine/cADPR-sensitive Ca2+ stores with the Ca2+ ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin (24Genazzani A.A. Galione A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and also in subcellular fractions insensitive to IP3 and cADPR (21Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar,25Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4413-4420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inactivation properties of this pathway are also somewhat unique. Concentrations of NAADP that are below the threshold for Ca2+ release are able to effect complete block of subsequent normally maximal NAADP challenge (26Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 27Genazzani A.A. Empson R.M. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1159911602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (149) Google Scholar). From radioligand experiments, NAADP appears to bind its receptor irreversibly (26Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 28Patel S. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,29Billington R.A. Genazzani A.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and this unusual property may underlie the unique inactivation of this pathway. These independent lines of evidence from broken cell preparations support the notion that NAADP targets a novel intracellular Ca2+ channel. Despite such discrete properties of NAADP sensitive Ca2+release in broken cell preparations, the pharmacology of NAADP-induced Ca2+ signals in intact cells is much more complex. In sea urchin eggs (30Churchill G.C. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38687-38692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and starfish oocytes (31Santella L. Kyozuka K. Genazzani A.A., De Riso L. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8301-8306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signals can be inhibited by a combination of heparin and 8-amino-cADPR, antagonists of IP3 and cADPR responses, respectively. Similarly, in pancreatic acinar cells, NAADP induces Ca2+ oscillations, reminiscent of those evoked by the brain-gut peptide, cholecystokinin, which are again sensitive to inhibitors of IP3 and cADPR (32Cancela J.M. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Nature. 1999; 398: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). This apparent discrepancy in the pharmacology of NAADP-induced Ca2+ release in broken and intact cells can be explained if NAADP initiates a “trigger” Ca2+ increase in the intact cell that is then amplified by Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release via IP3and cADPR receptors. This effect is lost in biochemical experiments where normal cellular architecture is disrupted. Additionally, Ca2+ release from NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ stores in intact sea urchin eggs may also be shuttled to thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores resulting in sensitization of IP3 and ryanodine receptors and the generation of Ca2+ oscillations (33Churchill G.C. Galione A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, this novel Ca2+-mobilizing agent may serve to coordinate Ca2+ signals via interaction with other intracellular Ca2+ release channels (34Patel S. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 482-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Indeed, blockade of NAADP receptors attenuates Ca2+ signals initiated by cholecystokinin in acinar cells (32Cancela J.M. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Nature. 1999; 398: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), T-cell receptor activation in T-lymphocytes (35Berg I. Potter V.L. Mayr G.W. Guse A.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and sperm in ascidian eggs (36Albrieux M. Lee H.C. Villaz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14566-14574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), events that require functional IP3 and/or ryanodine receptors. That metabolism of NAADP is regulated by Ca2+ in brain membranes (37Berridge G. Cramer R. Galione A. Patel S. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) adds an additional point of regulation for the fine-tuning of Ca2+ dynamics. Although the biochemical and molecular properties of IP3and ryanodine receptors are well defined, little is known concerning the nature of NAADP receptors. Here, we report for the first time, solubilization, and characterization of NAADP receptors from sea urchin eggs. Our data provide evidence that NAADP targets a novel protein that is distinct from known intracellular Ca2+ release channels. Sea urchin (Lytechinus pictus) egg homogenates (50% v/v) were prepared as described previously (27Genazzani A.A. Empson R.M. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1159911602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (149) Google Scholar), washed twice by centrifugation (20,000 ×g, 10 min) at 4 °C in binding medium composed of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 250 mm potassium gluconate, 250 mm N-methyl d-glucamine and 1 mm MgCl2. Washed homogenates (17% v/v) were solubilized by incubation with either Triton X-100, CHAPS, or SDS (1%) for 60 min and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. Supernatants were analyzed for [32P]NAADP binding (see below). Solubilization and centrifugation were performed at either 4 °C (for Triton X-100 and CHAPS) or room temperature (for SDS). [32P]NAADP was prepared enzymatically from [32P]NAD (1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (28Patel S. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 38Patel S. Churchill G.C. Sharp T. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36495-36497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Solubilized extracts were incubated in binding medium supplemented with [32P]NAADP (0.2 nm) together with the indicated concentrations of unlabeled NAADP or the NAADP analogues, 2′,3′-cyclic NAADP and 3′-NAADP (38Patel S. Churchill G.C. Sharp T. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36495-36497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 39Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20378-20383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Incubations were performed at room temperature for 1–3 h (final detergent concentration = 0.2% w/v). γ-globulin (400 μg) was then added to samples and protein precipitated by incubation with 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (average molecular weight = 8000) for 30–90 min. Samples were then centrifuged at 12000 × g for 5 min, the resulting pellets washed with 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol and dissolved in H2O for Cerenkov counting. Specific binding (1000–2000 cpm/incubation) was typically 70% of total binding. Sea urchin egg homogenates (0.1–25% v/v) were incubated for 1–16 h at room temperature in binding medium supplemented with 1–2 nm [32P]NAADP. Samples were subsequently washed twice in binding medium by centrifugation (2 min, 100,000 × g, 4 °C). Washed membranes (17% v/v) were then solubilized with the appropriate detergent as described for unlabeled homogenates. Homogenates (25% v/v) were prelabeled with [32P]NAADP in binding buffer (as described above) and subsequently washed and solubilized with Triton X-100 (1%) in a modified buffer composed of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). This step was necessary since we found that binding buffer interfered with electrophoresis (not shown). Solubilized samples were separated on native 7.5% polyacrylamide gels (pH 8.8) at 4 °C according to standard procedures (40Shi Q. Jackowski G. Hames B.D. Gel electrophoresis of proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998Google Scholar). Buffers were supplemented with 0.2% Triton X-100 to prevent protein precipitation. Samples were also subject to electrophoresis on 3–10 pH gradient gels (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gels were dried and apposed to Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences) at −80 °C for ∼16 h prior to developing. Prelabeled NAADP receptors solubilized with Triton X-100 or CHAPS in binding medium (100–500 μl) were injected onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column linked to an AKTA FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with binding buffer supplemented with the appropriate detergent (1%). Fractions (0.5–1 ml) were then collected (flow rate of 0.5 ml/min) and analyzed directly for radioactivity. Unlabeled solubilized samples were also separated under identical conditions and individual fractions assayed for [32P]NAADP binding using polyethylene glycol (see above). NAADP receptor migration was compared with the migration of the molecular mass markers, cytochrome c (12.5 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa). Triton X-100-solubilized receptors prelabeled with their ligand (200 μl) were layered onto a 1.8-ml 5–20% (w/v) sucrose density gradient (prepared in 3% increments) in binding medium supplemented with 1% Triton X-100. Samples were centrifuged in a swing-out rotor at 166,000 × g for 3.5 h at 4 °C. Fractions (195 μl) were collected from the top of the gradient and analyzed for radioactivity. Unlabeled NAADP receptors were separated under identical conditions. In order to improve resolution of lower molecular weight proteins, prelabeled receptors (200 μl) were also layered onto larger 3.6-ml 5–20% (w/v) sucrose density gradients, centrifuged at 164,000 × g for 17 h at 4 °C and fractionated as with smaller gradients. We and others have previously reported binding of [32P]NAADP to membrane preparations derived from sea urchin eggs (26Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 28Patel S. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 29Billington R.A. Genazzani A.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the present study, washed sea urchin egg homogenates were treated with the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100 and supernatants, following ultracentrifugation, analyzed for [32P]NAADP binding. Binding of [32P]NAADP was readily detected following Triton X-100 solubilization (yield = 153 ± 31%,n = 3). From isotope dilution experiments, [32P]NAADP binding to solubilized receptors was inhibited by NAADP (IC50 = 1 ± 0.3 nm,n = 8) and the NAADP analogues, 2′,3′-cyclic NAADP (IC50 = 3 ± 1 nm, n = 3) and 3′-NAADP (IC50 = 8 ± 4 nm,n = 3; Fig.1 A). The rank order of potency for solubilized NAADP receptors (NAADP>2′,3′-cyclic NAADP>3′-NAADP) is therefore the same as that reported previously for membrane-bound NAADP receptors (38Patel S. Churchill G.C. Sharp T. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36495-36497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and correlates closely with the rank order of potency of NAADP and its analogues in stimulating Ca2+ mobilization from sea urchin egg homogenates (39Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20378-20383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). An intriguing feature of [32P]NAADP binding to sea urchin egg homogenates, but notably not mammalian brain (38Patel S. Churchill G.C. Sharp T. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36495-36497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or heart (41Bak J. Billington R.A. Timar G. Dutton A.C. Genazzani A.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 987-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) membranes, is its apparent non-dissociating nature (26Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 28Patel S. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 29Billington R.A. Genazzani A.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As originally described by Lee and colleagues (26Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), an excess of unlabeled NAADP competes with [32P]NAADP if added simultaneously with the radioligand but has no effect once association is initiated (28Patel S. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 29Billington R.A. Genazzani A.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In converse experiments, we have shown that if sea urchin egg homogenates are incubated first with unlabeled NAADP prior to addition of radioligand, an apparent leftward-shift in competition curves is observed compared with experiments in which labeled and unlabeled NAADP are added together (28Patel S. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These data are again inconsistent with a reversible interaction. As shown in Fig. 1 B, addition of unlabeled NAADP (1 μm) following prior incubation of solubilized receptors with radioligand was without effect on binding of [32P]NAADP over the time course of the experiment (90 min). Thus, sea urchin egg NAADP receptors, whether membrane-bound or soluble, appear to bind their ligand in an essentially irreversible manner. The data from Fig. 1 show that the binding characteristics of membrane-bound and solubilized NAADP receptors are similar. Indeed, binding of [32P]NAADP to Triton X-100 extracts was inhibited by high concentrations (1 m) of NaCl but unaffected by pH in the range 6–8 (data not shown), again consistent with previous studies using membrane preparations (28Patel S. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Taken together, our data indicate that detergent treatment of sea urchin egg homogenates results in solubilization of functional NAADP receptors. Since binding of NAADP to both membrane-bound and solubilized receptors does not readily dissociate, we determined whether membrane-bound NAADP receptors could be first tagged with their ligand and then solubilized as a receptor-ligand complex. Sea urchin egg homogenates were incubated with [32P]NAADP and membranes washed by centrifugation in order to remove unbound radioligand. [32P]NAADP binding to sea urchin egg homogenates was similar whether determined by this centrifugation method (14.8 ± 1 fmol/μl of homogenate,n = 3) or filtration (10.3 fmol/μl of homogenate,n = 2). These data indicate that washing does not induce dissociation of radioligand validating the use of this assay for the preparation of labeled membranes. Simultaneous addition of unlabeled NAADP together with radioligand during prelabeling of sea urchin egg homogenates (0.1% v/v) reduced the levels of tagged receptors following subsequent centrifugation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.2 A). The IC50value for NAADP in these protection assays (2 ± 0.6,n = 3) is similar to the apparent affinity of membrane-bound (28Patel S. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and solubilized (Fig. 1 A) NAADP receptors. At higher homogenate concentrations (25% v/v), we noted that the apparent affinity of NAADP receptors determined by centrifugation (16 ± 2 nm, n = 3) and also by filtration (data not shown) was somewhat reduced (Fig.2 A). Accordingly, reduced levels of [32P]NAADP binding to a fixed amount of sea urchin egg homogenate was evident when incubations were performed at lower dilutions (Fig. 2 B). Clearly then, binding of NAADP versus homogenate concentration is non-linear (Fig. 2 B, inset), an effect that may be due to increased NAADP metabolism at higher protein concentrations. Preincubation of sea urchin egg homogenates with a low concentration of NAADP prior to addition of radioligand reduced subsequent tagging to a greater extent than when the same concentration of NAADP was incubated together with the radioligand (Fig.2 C). In addition, incubation of a normally maximal concentration of NAADP was without effect on tagging if added after the radioligand during preincubation. These effects, which were similar at low and high concentrations of sea urchin egg homogenates during labeling (Fig. 2 C), further indicate that NAADP does not dissociate from its receptor following washing by centrifugation confirming again our results obtained by conventional filtration assays (28Patel S. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the next set of experiments, we treated membranes labeled with [32P]NAADP with the Triton X-100, the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS, and the ionic detergent, SDS. All three detergents resulted in efficient release of radioligand from prelabeled membranes into supernatant fractions following ultracentrifugation whereas buffer alone was without effect (Fig. 3,A and B). In order to determine whether released radioligand following solubilization of prelabeled membrane remained bound to its receptor or had dissociated due to detergent treatment, we precipitated fractions with polyethylene glycol and analyzed the resulting pellets for radioactivity (Fig. 3, A andC). Following solubilization with Triton X-100 and CHAPS, 63 ± 13% and 74 ± 11% (n = 3) of the radioactivity in supernatant fractions could be precipitated, respectively, indicating that binding of [32P]NAADP to its receptor is preserved. In contrast, recovery after SDS treatment was minimal (4 ± 1%, n = 3, Fig. 3 C). Thus, under the latter denaturing conditions, supernatant radioactivity is likely free, unbound radioligand. These data, together with the finding that high salt concentrations initiate partial dissociation of bound [32P]NAADP to membrane preparations (28Patel S. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), provide evidence that irreversible binding of [32P]NAADP to NAADP receptors is not due to covalent modification of the target protein. Having defined solubilization conditions that retain binding of [32P]NAADP to its receptor, we analyzed prelabeled NAADP receptors by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Autoradiograms following separation of labeled membranes solubilized with Triton X-100 revealed that a significant proportion of the radioactivity migrated as a band distinct from the dye-front (Fig.4 A). These data further suggest that [32P]NAADP remains bound to its receptor following solubilization of labeled membranes with mild detergents. Additionally, [32P]NAADP appears to bind only a single protein under these conditions. However, dissociation of [32P]NAADP from its receptor was also evident (Fig.4 A). We also analyzed NAADP receptor migration by electrophoresis on pH gradient gels (Fig. 4 B). From these experiments the isoelectric point of prelabeled NAADP receptors was 5.9 ± 0.3 (n = 3). Although NAADP receptor-ligand complexes could be resolved by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4), separation of proteins by this method is dependent not solely on size but also net charge and is therefore not well suited for determining molecular size. SDS (which eliminates the endogenous charge of proteins) could not be included during electrophoresis since it induced ligand dissociation (Fig3 C). The molecular size of NAADP receptors was therefore determined by gel filtration. With this method, previous studies have demonstrated that both IP3 and ryanodine receptors, (which assemble as large tetrameric complexes) migrate to fractions corresponding to molecular weights of ∼1000 and 2000 kDa, respectively (42Supattapone S. Worley P.F. Baraban J.M. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1530-1534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Pessah I.N. Francini A.O. Scales D.J. Waterhouse A.L. Casida J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8643-8648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, we provide evidence that NAADP receptors are substantially smaller. Fractionation of prelabeled NAADP receptors solubilized in the presence of Triton X-100 on Superdex 200 indicated a molecular weight of 471 kDa (n = 3, Fig.5 A, closed circles). Similar results were obtained following fractionation of unlabeled homogenates (Fig. 5 A, inset). In these postlabeling experiments, NAADP receptor migration was determined conventionally by analyzing the individual fractions for [32P]NAADP binding as in Fig. 1. Similar results were also obtained when gel filtration was performed in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (data not shown). Migration of prelabeled NAADP receptors solubilized with CHAPS (Fig. 5 B) revealed that the molecular weight was consistently smaller (408 kDa,n = 3) than that determined in the presence of Triton X-100 (471 kDa, n = 3). Gel filtration of the NAADP receptor in the presence of CHAPS, where total protein distribution could be determined in parallel (Fig. 5 B, dotted line), indicated a 9.3 ± 0.4-fold (n = 3) enrichment of NAADP receptors in the peak fraction. We next determined the molecular weight of NAADP receptors by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 6). As with gel filtration, both IP3 and ryanodine receptors migrate as high molecular weight complexes and are accordingly recovered in heavy fractions with this technique (7Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C. Takei K. De Camilli P. Nature. 1989; 342: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 9Lai F.A. Erickson H.P. Rousseau E. Liu Q.-Y. Meissner G. Nature. 1988; 331: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Prelabeled NAADP receptors were therefore layered onto a 5–20% sucrose gradient and fractions analyzed for radioactivity following ultracentrifugation (Fig 6 A). In contrast to the results from gel filtration experiments, where NAADP receptors coeluted with apoferretin (molecular size 443 kDa, Fig. 5), the estimated molecular size of prelabeled NAADP receptors with this method was substantially smaller. Thus, whereas apoferretin migrated to fraction 5.2 ± 0.2 (n = 7), NAADP receptors prelabeled with [32P]NAADP at a homogenate concentration of either 25% v/v or 0.1% v/v migrated earlier to fractions 2.4 ± 0.3 (n = 5) and 2.7 ± 0.4 (n = 3), respectively (Fig. 6 A, closed circles, pooled data from all eight experiments). This distribution is more similar to that of alcohol dehydrogenase (2.7 ± 0.4, n = 3; molecular size 150 kDa). Again, similar results were obtained when NAADP receptor migration was determined by postlabeling of the collected fractions with [32P]NAADP following separation of unlabeled NAADP receptors (peak fraction = 2.5, n = 2; Fig.6 A, open circles). These data further highlight the usefulness of the prelabeling method for tracking NAADP receptors during purification. Migration of prelabeled NAADP receptors on glycerol density gradients was also the same as sucrose density gradients (data not shown). In order to obtain a more accurate molecular weight by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, we performed experiments on larger gradients following prolonged centrifugation (Fig. 6 B). From these experiments, the molecular mass of prelabeled NAADP receptors was estimated to be 120 ± 2 kDa. (n = 3). Inclusion of an excess of unlabeled NAADP during incubation of homogenates with [32P]NAADP, resulted in substantial reduction in radioactivity following solubilization and fractionation, confirming the specificity of binding (Fig. 6 B, open circles). The surprising discrepancy between the calculated molecular weight of NAADP receptors by gel filtration (Fig. 5) and sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 6) was further analyzed by combining the two techniques in sequence (Fig. 7,insets). Separation of partially purified NAADP receptors following gel filtration on sucrose gradients, indicated that prelabeled NAADP receptors again coeluted with alcohol dehydrogenase (Fig. 7 A, n = 3) and were thus substantially smaller than that estimated by gel filtration (Fig. 5). Conversely, prior separation of NAADP receptors on sucrose density gradients followed by purification of peak fractions by gel filtration, indicated that NAADP receptors were substantially larger than when analyzed on sucrose density gradients (Fig. 6). In these experiments, NAADP receptors comigrated with apoferritin (Fig. 7 B,n = 3) as did crude solubilized samples (Fig.5 A). One possibility to reconcile the results from gel filtration and sucrose density gradient experiments is that NAADP receptors form oligomeric complexes that are dissociated by the latter technique in a reversible manner. Although the mechanism underlying this effect is not known at present, this feature is not shared by known intracellular Ca2+ channels, suggesting that NAADP binds to a distinct, smaller target. Indeed, under the present conditions optimized for solubilization of NAADP receptors, we were unable to solubilize ryanodine receptors with Triton X-100 following prelabeling of homogenates with [3H]ryanodine (data not shown). In summary, we have for the first time characterized the binding properties of NAADP receptors solubilized from sea urchin eggs. Solubilized NAADP receptors bound their ligand with the appropriate affinity and selectivity. Furthermore, binding of [32P]NAADP to detergent extracts is not readily reversible indicating that this unusual property is likely to be intrinsic to the NAADP receptor. We also show that NAADP receptors can be tagged with their ligand and solubilized intact thereby providing a convenient means of tracking NAADP receptors during purification. Results from gel filtration and sucrose density gradient centrifugation experiments indicate that NAADP receptors are significantly smaller than IP3 and ryanodine receptors. Our data provide further evidence that NAADP mediates Ca2+ mobilization via a novel pathway. We thank Rachel Ashworth, Steve Bolsover, Philippe Champiel, Grant Churchill, F.

The proteins encoded by TSC1 andTSC2, hamartin and tuberin, respectively, associate with each other forming a tight complex. Here we show that hamartin binds the neurofilament light chain and it is possible to recover the hamartin-tuberin complex over the neurofilament light chain rod domain spanning amino acids 93–156 by affinity precipitation. Homologous rod domains in other intermediate filaments such as neurofilament medium chain, α-internexin, vimentin, and desmin are not able to bind hamartin. In cultured cortical neurons, hamartin and tuberin co-localize with neurofilament light chain preferentially in the proximal to central growth cone region. Interestingly, in the distal part of the growth cone hamartin overlaps with the ezrin-radixin-moesin family of actin binding proteins, and we have validated the interaction of hamartin with moesin. These results demonstrate that hamartin may anchor neuronal intermediate filaments to the actin cytoskeleton, which may be critical for some of the CNS functions of the hamartin-tuberin complex, and abolishing this through mutations in TSC1 orTSC2 may lead to certain neurological manifestations associated with the disease.

Several experimental approaches clearly establish that hamartin and tuberin function together as a complex. It is likely that, depending on the cell or tissue type, additional proteins exist in this complex, and, therefore, identification of binding partners for hamartin and tuberin is essential. Recently, hamartin was shown to interact with the ERM (ezrin, radixin, and moesin) family of actin-binding proteins and is thought to have a role in cell adhesion and activation of the small GTP-binding protein Rho (26Lamb R.F. Roy C. Diefenbach T.J. Vinters H.V. Johnson M.W. Jay D.G. Hall A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have isolated the neurofilament-light chain (NF-L) and have confirmed that NF-L is a physiologically relevant interactor for hamartin. Studies performedin vitro indicate that NF-L is part of the hamartin-tuberin complex. Hamartin and tuberin co-localize with NF-L and the ERM proteins in cultured primary cortical neurons with enrichment in neuronal growth cones. The association of hamartin with NF-L and ERM proteins in the proximal and distal part of the growth cone, respectively, suggests that this tumor suppressor may function as an integrator of the neuronal intermediate filament and the actin cytoskeletal network. cDNA was synthesized from human fetal cerebellum mRNA using the Superscript preamplification system for first-strand cDNA synthesis (Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD) followed by reverse transcription-PCR using specific primers and Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The bait used in the yeast two-hybrid system encoded hamartin amino acids 674 through the stop codon and was amplified with primers 5HAMC (5′-CGGCGTCGACCTTGGACCCACTTTGGAGGC-3′) and 3HAMC (5′-CGGCGTCGACCTTTAGCTCTCTTCATGATGAGT-3′) and cloned into the vector pGBT9 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). TheNF-L insert, isolated from the cDNA library, was subcloned into the EcoRI site of the pGEX4T-1 and pGAD424 vectors. Full-length TSC1 in pcDNA3 has been described previously (8Murthy V. Haddad L.A. Smith N. Pinney D. Tyszkowski R. Brown D. Ramesh V. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F737-F746PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length NF-L was cloned into pcDNA3 by PCR amplification of an Image (National Institute of Health) clone obtained from Research Genetics (#631980) using primers NFL1S (5′-GCGGGATCCATGAGTTCCTTCAGCTACGAGCCG-3′) and NFL3A (5′-CAGGCGGCCGCTCAATCTTTCTTCTTAGCTGCTTG-3′). NF-L domain constructs were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR from fetal cerebellum cDNA and cloned directionally into the pGEX4T-1 vector. The amino acid numbers defining head, rod, and tail domains were taken from human NF-L Genpept sequence accession number P07196. Primers used to amplify the various domains of NF-L were as follows: the head domain (aa 1–92) using NFL1S and NFL5A (5′-GCGCTCGAGCTGCGCCTTCTCCTGCGTGCG-3′), the first 64 residues of the rod domain (aa 93–156) using NFL2S (5′-GCGGGATCCCTCCAGGACCTCAATGACCGC-3′) and NFL2A (5′-ATAGCGGCCGCCTACTCGTTGGTGGTGGCATCTTC-3′), the last 241 residues of the rod domain (aa 157–397) using NFL3S (5′-GCGGGATCCAAGCAGGCGCTCCAGGGCGAG-3′) and NFL7A (5′-GCGGTCGACGGTCTCCTCGCCTTCCAAGAG-3′). NF-M construct (aa 1–165) was amplified with primers NFM1S (5′-GGAATTCATGAGCTACACGTTGGACTCG-3′) and NFM1A (5′-CGTGTCGACCTGAGCCTTCTCGTGGTTCACG-3′), and an α-internexin construct (aa 1–165) was made with primers AINT1S (5′-GGAATTCATGAGCTTCGGCTCGGAGCAC-3′) and AINT1A (5′-CGTGTCGACCTGCGAGCCGAGCTGGCG-3′). NF-M and α-internexin constructs were directionally cloned into the vector pGAD424 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). A desmin construct (aa 22–177) was obtained by sub-cloning full-length mouse desmin cDNA, kindly provided by Dr. R. Kothary from Ottawa General Hospital Research Institute, into SmaI and SalI sites of pGAD424 vector. Full-length 3′ myc-tagged vimentin in pcDNA3 was a kind gift from Dr. R. D. Goldman, Northwestern University Medical School. All clones obtained by PCR were completely sequenced. Hamartin polyclonal antibodies HF3 and HF6 have been described earlier (8Murthy V. Haddad L.A.

A polyclonal antibody C20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was employed for tuberin. For NF-L either monoclonal antibody (clone DA2, Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) or a polyclonal antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) was used. Anti-vimentin monoclonal antibody was obtained from Dako (clone V9, Glostrup, Denmark), and the anti-ERM 13H9 monoclonal supernatant was a generous gift of Dr. F. Solomon at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Donkey anti-mouse conjugated to Cy3, donkey anti-rabbit conjugated to Cy2 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), and donkey anti-rabbit Alexa488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were used as secondary antibodies. Hamartin C-terminal bait (aa 674–1164) was used to screen a human fetal brain cDNA library made in fusion with the GAL4 activation domain in the vector pGAD10 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using the yeast strain Hf7c containing the reporter genes his3 and lacZ. One million co-transformants were screened for the two reporter genes on plates containing media with amino acid selection. Forhis3 gene transcription activation, 20 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added to decrease the possibility of false-positive results. Yeast two-hybrid clones pVA3 (murine p53), pTD1 (SV40 large T-antigen), and pLAM5 (5′-end of lamin C) were used as controls (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Interactor controls WASP and WIP were kindly provided by Dr. N. Ramesh (Children's Hospital, Boston, MA). Dystrobrevin-α exons 14 through 16 were amplified by PCR from a full-length clone in pCR2.1, kindly provided by Dr. L. M. Kunkel (Children's Hospital, Boston, MA), and were subcloned into either pGBT9 or pGAD424 vectors. Hamartin bait deletion constructs were obtained by digestion of the bait with PstI (Fig. 3 A, #2) orEcoRI (Fig. 3 A, #5), followed by vector purification, ligation, and transformation. Other constructs were generated by restriction digestion (Fig. 3 A,#3 with EcoRI, #4 withSmaI, and #6 with BamHI andBglII), followed by gel purification of respective bands and subcloning into pGBT9 vector. Cos-7 cells, co-transfected with full-length hamartin and either full-length NF-L or vimentin, were lysed in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Triton-X-100, complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN), 2 mm EDTA, and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride). Lysates were precleared with normal rabbit serum and a mixture of protein A- and protein G-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Precleared lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-hamartin antibody HF6, and beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer containing decreasing concentrations of Triton X-100 (from 1% to 0.25%). After the final wash, beads were resuspended in 1× sample buffer (33% glycerol, 6.7% SDS, 330 mm dithiothreitol), resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-NF-L antibody or anti-vimentin antibody. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). HeLa cells were used as an endogenous source of hamartin. Cells were lysed as described above, and the lysate was incubated with 600 pmol of GST-NF-L or GST immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. The beads were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline containing Pefabloc, resuspended in 1× sample buffer, subjected to 6% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-hamartin antibody HF6. Neuron cultures were established using published protocols (28Lin J.W., Ju, W. Foster K. Lee S.H. Ahmadian G. Wyszynski M. Wang Y.T. Sheng M. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1282-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Briefly, brain cortexes of Sprague-Dawley rat embryos (E20) were dissected, submitted to enzymatic dissociation of cells with trypsin (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) at room temperature, followed by mechanical dissociation in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen). 5 × 104 cells were plated in each well of a six-well plate containing poly-d-lysine/laminin-coated coverslips (BD-Bioscience, Bedford, MA) and 2 ml of media. Neurobasal media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% B-27 (Invitrogen) was used. Media was initially changed on the second day in vitro (DIV) and subsequently once every week. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 37 °C for 30 min on the 10th or 16th DIV. Fixed neurons were permeabilized with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min, blocked for 1 h in 10% normal goat serum, incubated with anti-hamartin polyclonal antibody HF6 (1:10) and either anti-NF-L monoclonal antibody (1:100) or anti-ERM monoclonal antibody (1:100) for 1 h, then incubated again with Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:1500) and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (1:1000) for 30 min. For tuberin staining, C20 was used at a dilution of 1:100 followed by Cy2-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (1:1000) antibody. Coverslips were mounted on Gelvatol mounting media (polyvinyl alcohol resin grade 205, Air Products and Chemicals, Lehigh Valley, PA). Images were captured using LSM 5 Pascal software coupled to a Zeiss LSM Pascal Vario 2 RGB confocal system. To identify proteins that associate with hamartin, the C-terminal half of the protein (aa 674–1164) containing the large coiled-coil domain was used as a bait to screen a human fetal brain cDNA library using the GAL4 yeast two-hybrid system. Screening was performed on a total of 1 × 106 clones with 15 positive clones identified representing three groups. One of the cDNA groups, which comprised 13 positive clones, encoded the head and part of the rod domain of NF-L spanning amino acids 8–156. The hamartin bait as well as the NF-L clone did not independently activate transcription of the reporter genes his3 andlacZ. The specificity of this interaction was tested using various unrelated baits, which did not activate transcription after co-transformation with either the TSC1 bait or NF-L (Fig.1). Among these controls, dystrobrevin-α in particular represents an unrelated protein containing a coiled-coil domain and did not show an interaction with either hamartin or NF-L, excluding the possibility that the interaction observed between NF-L and hamartin is nonspecifically mediated through the coiled-coil domains of these proteins. To further characterize the interaction between hamartin and NF-L, we tested the ability of hamartin to bind GST-NF-L in affinity precipitation assays. As shown in Fig.2 A, endogenous hamartin from HeLa cells was able to bind to a GST-NF-L fusion protein encoding aa 8–156 and did not bind to GST alone employed as a negative control. In addition, immunoprecipitation assays performed on Cos-7 cells, which had been co-transfected with full-length TSC1 and full-length NF-L cDNA clones, revealed that NF-L co-immunoprecipitates with hamartin (Fig. 2 B), confirming that NF-L is a physiologically relevant binding partner for the tumor suppressor hamartin. Coiled-coil domains are known to mediate protein-protein interactions (29Burkhard P. Stetefeld J. Strelkov S. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 82-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). To define the domain(s) responsible for the interaction of hamartin with NF-L, further deletion constructs within the TSC1 bait region were generated and employed in yeast two-hybrid assays to verify the activation of the reporter genes his3 andlacZ after co-transformation with NF-L. Deletions either within, upstream, or downstream of the coiled-coil domain completely abolished the activation of transcription (Fig.3 A). In addition, the coiled-coil domain alone could not activate transcription of the reporter genes. Thus we could not further define the domain in hamartin that is necessary for interacting with NF-L. It is possible that conformational changes caused by deletions mask the NF-L binding site in hamartin in this assay. Similar to other intermediate filaments, NF-L is composed of head (aa 1–92), rod (aa 93–397), and tail (aa 398–544) domains. The region of NF-L that was isolated in the yeast two-hybrid screen (aa 8–156) comprised most of the head and a part of the rod domains. To further analyze hamartin binding to NF-L, we expressed the head and rod regions of NF-L as GST fusion proteins and performed affinity precipitation assays as described above. A majority of the interaction between hamartin and NF-L was seen with the rod domain spanning aa 93–156 (Fig. 3 B). We also observed that the rest of the NF-L rod domain (aa 157–397) was not necessary for this interaction (data not shown). The NF-L rod domain is composed of heptad repeats forming four regions of coiled-coil domains (coils 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B) connected by three linker regions. The NF-L rod domain segment that binds hamartin contains coil 1A, the first linker, and the first 19 residues of coil 1B. Hamartin and tuberin strongly associate with each other and may exist as part of a complex that contains additional components (13Nellist M. van Slegtenhorst M. Goedbloed M. van den Ouweland A.M. Halley D.J. van der Sluijs P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35647-35652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Hamartin and tuberin exhibit strong similarities in their expression pattern and subcellular distribution, although some differences do exist (8Murthy V. Haddad L.A. Smith N. Pinney D. Tyszkowski R. Brown D. Ramesh V. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F737-F746PubMed Google Scholar, 9Gutmann D.H. Zhang Y. Hasbani M.J. Goldberg M.P. Plank T.L. Henske E.P. Acta Neuropathol. (Berlin). 2000; 99: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) raising the possibility that protein interactors identified for each protein may or may not be part of the hamartin-tuberin complex. We raised the question whether tuberin along with hamartin could be retained in affinity precipitation assays performed with GST-NF-L. The NF-L domains spanning amino acids 8–156, as well as amino acids 93–156, are capable of retaining tuberin presumably through hamartin (Fig. 3 B) suggesting that NF-L may exist as part of the hamartin-tuberin complex in neurons. The rod domain of NF-L is about 50% homologous to rod domains of other intermediate filaments. Because the association of hamartin with NF-L is mostly mediated through the rod domain, we examined whether additional intermediate filaments with homologous rod domains are capable of interacting with hamartin. The intermediate filaments with the highest homology to NF-L include vimentin, desmin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilaments-medium (NF-M) and -heavy (NF-H) chains, α-internexin, peripherin, and cytokeratin 8. Vimentin is present in cells from mesenchymal origin and is highly expressed in fibroblasts, which are a major cellular component of TSC-associated skin lesions such as facial angiofibromas, shagreen patch, and subungual fibromas. Similarly, desmin, a muscle-specific intermediate filament, is of relevance for TSC cardiac rhabdomyoma. We therefore initially examined whether vimentin and desmin were capable of binding hamartin. Co-transfection of full-length TSC1 with full-length VIM, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-hamartin antibody showed that vimentin does not co-immunoprecipitate with hamartin (Fig.4). Co-immunoprecipitations could not be carried out successfully on cells co-transfected with TSC1and DES, because exogenously expressed desmin consistently precipitated and bound nonspecifically to Sepharose beads employed in the assays. We therefore used the yeast two-hybrid system to examine the interaction of hamartin with desmin as well as two members of the class IV intermediate filaments, NF-M and α-internexin, in which NF-L is a member. With the exception of NF-L, the transcriptional activation of the reporter genes was not observed when TSC1 was co-transformed with any of the other intermediate filaments tested (Table I). These findings indicate that, among the intermediate filaments, NF-L is a distinct binding partner of hamartin with the interaction likely to be restricted to neurons.Table IInteraction of hamartin with other intermediate filaments assessed by yeast-two hybrid assayBinding domainActivation domainReporter gene activationhis3lacZBaitNF-L++BaitNF-M−−Baitα-Internexin−−BaitDesmin−−The respective rod domains of intermediate filament family members NF-M, α-internexin, or desmin did not activate the transcription of the reporter genes his3 and lacZ when co-transformed with TSC1 bait. Open table in a new tab The respective rod domains of intermediate filament family members NF-M, α-internexin, or desmin did not activate the transcription of the reporter genes his3 and lacZ when co-transformed with TSC1 bait. To examine whether hamartin and NF-L are present in similar subcellular locations within neurons, we performed indirect immunofluorescence microscopy on cultured cortical neurons obtained from rats. We observed an enrichment of hamartin staining in many neuronal growth cones with a weaker punctate pattern along the neurites. As expected, NF-L was present in neurites and growth cones, and the two proteins co-localized primarily in the proximal to central regions of growth cones (Fig. 5,A–C). We also examined the co-localization of tuberin with NF-L and observed that tuberin in fact overlaps with NF-L in the proximal to central regions of growth cones (Fig. 5,D–F) further supporting that hamartin together with tuberin exist in a complex with NF-L in neuronal growth cones. A recent study reported hamartin as a physiological binding partner for the ERM family of proteins. In this study, co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous ezrin with hamartin as well as co-localization of ERM proteins with hamartin were documented in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (26Lamb R.F. Roy C. Diefenbach T.J. Vinters H.V. Johnson M.W. Jay D.G. Hall A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). However, it remained unclear whether the interactions between these proteins occurred in other cell types. Interestingly, several studies have demonstrated that the ERM proteins are enriched in growth cones of various neurons (30Goslin K. Birgbauer E. Banker G. Solomon F. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1621-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 31Birgbauer E. Dinsmore J. Winckler B. Lander A.a. Solomon F. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 30: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 32Gonzalez-Agosti C. Solomon F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 34: 122-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Radixin and moesin are implicated to play a key role in generating and maintaining the normal structural and functional organization of growth cones (32Gonzalez-Agosti C. Solomon F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 34: 122-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 33Paglini G. Kunda P. Quiroga S. Kosik K. Caceres A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 443-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 34Castelo L. Jay D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1511-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether hamartin and ERM proteins co-localize in neurons and observed that these two proteins indeed exist together in neuronal growth cones. Hamartin co-localizes with the ERM proteins in the central to distal part of growth cones (Fig.6 A, panels A–D). Similarly, tuberin also exhibits a strong co-localization with the ERM proteins in the distal region of growth cones (data not shown). As described previously ERM proteins are seen in the actin-rich peripheral regions of growth cones where hamartin is not enriched (panels C and D). Furthermore, we confirmed that interaction occurs between hamartin and ERM proteins by affinity precipitation assays employing GST fusion proteins expressing the N terminus of either moesin or the related NF2 tumor suppressor protein merlin and endogenous hamartin from HeLa cells. Hamartin was able to bind GST-moesin and, to a lesser extent, GST-merlin but not GST alone, in affinity precipitation assays (Fig. 6 B), which is in agreement with an earlier study (26Lamb R.F. Roy C. Diefenbach T.J. Vinters H.V. Johnson M.W. Jay D.G. Hall A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that in neurons, hamartin may integrate actin and NF-L via its direct interaction with the ERM proteins and NF-L. TSC is a developmental disorder characterized by abnormalities in cell migration, differentiation, and proliferation, and it is manifested by the presence of hamartomas and hamartias in various organs. Central nervous system lesions include cortical tubers, subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, subependymal nodules, and neuroglial heterotopias, which result in a variety of neurological manifestations, including mental retardation and seizures. The CNS lesions contain cells that can be classified as neurons and astrocytes as well as cells that are not easily classified. The neurons in these lesions appear to be primitive or aberrant (1Gomez M. Sampson J. Holtes-Whittemore V. Tuberous Sclerosis Complex. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, 1999Google Scholar). We have observed the expression of tuberin and hamartin to decline progressively after birth in many tissues; however, in the CNS their expression levels did not decrease with age. Throughout development and in adult CNS strong expression of both proteins was seen in neurons (27Murthy V. Stemmer-Rachamimov A.O. Haddad L.A. Roy J.E. Cutone A.N. Beauchamp R.L. Smith N. Louis D.N. Ramesh V. Acta Neuropathol. (Berlin). 2001; 101: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Genetic analyses of TSC lesions demonstrate that a majority of renal angiomyolipomas seen in TSC are associated with loss of the wild-type allele as expected, whereas less frequent loss of heterozygosity is seen in cortical tubers (35Henske E.P. Scheithauer B.W. Short M.P. Wollmann R. Nahmias J. Hornigold N. van Slegtenhorst M. Welsh C.T. Kwiatkowski D.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 400-406PubMed Google Scholar, 36Au K.S. Hebert A.A.

Careful analysis for subtle variations in TSC genes, molecular analysis of micro-dissected balloon cells from cortical tubers, as well promoter methylation studies performed in our laboratory failed to reveal the second somatic mutation in some of the clonally derived brain lesions. This suggests the possibility that somatic mutations may not be necessary and that other mechanisms may contribute to abnormal growth particularly in the CNS lesions (37Niida Y. Stemmer-Rachamimov A.O. Logrip M. Tapon D. Perez R. Kwiatkowski D.J. Sims K. MacCollin M. Louis D.N. Ramesh V. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 493-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). All these observations suggest that the hamartin-tuberin complex is likely to have distinct functions in the CNS. Neurofilaments are the major intermediate filaments in mature neurons and consist of three polypeptides, the light (NF-L), medium (NF-M), and heavy (NF-H) chains. NF-L homodimerizes and interacts with NF-M and NF-H, which extend side projections in the neurofilament meshwork. In this study we have shown that NF-L associates with hamartin through the first half of its rod domain. Other intermediate filaments such as vimentin, desmin, NF-M, and α-internexin, which exhibit about 50% homology in the first two coil regions of their respective rod domains with NF-L, do not show association with hamartin. Therefore, hamartin association with intermediate filaments is probably restricted to neurons and is specific to NF-L. Furthermore, in affinity precipitation assays using the first half of the NF-L rod domain, it is possible to recover tuberin bound to hamartin, suggesting that the three proteins are probably part of the same molecular complex in neurons. Co-localization of hamartin and tuberin with NF-L is enriched particularly in the proximal and central regions of neuronal growth cones implicating this as a potential site of interaction for these proteins. An earlier study found hamartin to be associated with the ERM family of actin-binding proteins in vitro and in vivo in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and this interaction was shown to be required for activation of Rho by serum or lysophosphatidic acid (26Lamb R.F. Roy C. Diefenbach T.J. Vinters H.V. Johnson M.W. Jay D.G. Hall A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). We have confirmed that hamartin interacts with moesin, and in cultured primary neurons hamartin and tuberin reveal strong co-localization with ERMs in the distal region of growth cones. Interestingly, among the ERM family members, only radixin and moesin are concentrated in neuronal growth cones, and ezrin is restricted mainly to the cell body (32Gonzalez-Agosti C. Solomon F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 34: 122-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 33Paglini G. Kunda P. Quiroga S. Kosik K. Caceres A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 443-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Moesin and radixin have been clearly shown to regulate key aspects of growth cone development and maintenance modulating neurite formation and polarity (32Gonzalez-Agosti C. Solomon F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 34: 122-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 33Paglini G. Kunda P. Quiroga S. Kosik K. Caceres A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 443-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 34Castelo L. Jay D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1511-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In neurons expressing reduced levels of radixin and moesin, growth cone alterations are accompanied by a dramatic disorganization of F-actin (33Paglini G. Kunda P. Quiroga S. Kosik K. Caceres A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 443-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It is likely that the association of hamartin-tuberin complex with ERM proteins is essential for growth cone maintenance and motility. The ERM proteins are highly regulated, actin-binding proteins and have emerged as key molecules in linking F-actin to specific membrane proteins, especially in cell surface structures (38Bretscher A. Chambers D. Nguyen R. Reczek D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 113-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The interaction of hamartin with ERM proteins is reported to be required upstream of Rho for lysophosphatidic acid-induced assembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers (26Lamb R.F. Roy C. Diefenbach T.J. Vinters H.V. Johnson M.W. Jay D.G. Hall A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Mouse embryonic fibroblast lines derived from Tsc1 null mice display a difference in actin and focal adhesion dynamics supporting a function for hamartin in the actin-based cytoskeleton (21Kwiatkowski D.J. Zhang H. Bandura J.L. Heiberger K.M. Glogauer M. el-Hashemite N. Onda H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Our results documenting the interaction of hamartin with NF-L imply that hamartin could function as a novel integrator of the neuronal cytoskeleton (Fig.7). In this context it is worthwhile to note that several members of the plakin protein family serve as anchors that connect cytoskeleton filaments to junctional complexes and as linker proteins that cross-link various cytoskeletal elements. Interestingly, plakins are involved in both inherited and autoimmune diseases that affect the skin, heart, neuronal tissue, and skeletal muscle (39Leung C.L. Liem R.K. Parry D.A. Green K.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3409-3410PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the present study potentially adds hamartin to the growing list of versatile cytoskeletal linker proteins that are implicated in human disease. The CNS lesions of TSC are thought to arise from a defect in glial-neuronal differentiation and migration during embryonic development. It is believed that the least differentiated cells found in TSC brains fail to reach the post-mitotic stage and thus fail to migrate from the periventricular germinal matrix, developing into subependymal giant cell astrocytomas and subependymal nodules. More differentiated, but still dysplastic cells succeed in migrating to the cortical plate but fail to become incorporated into the normal cortical cytoarchitecture, forming cortical tubers or neuroglial heterotopias (40Caviness Jr., V.S. Takahashi T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 615: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 41Huttenlocher P.R. Wollmann R.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Acta Neuropathol. 1995; 90: 387-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the association of hamartin with NF-L and ERM proteins might play an essential role in neuronal migration and that abolishing this interaction by mutations in the TSC genes could explain certain neuronal differentiation and migration defects observed in TSC brains. We thank Roberta L. Beauchamp for her help in preparation of this manuscript and members of our laboratory for helpful comments on the manuscript."

The activation of protein kinases through growth factor receptors is achieved via a complex network of intracellular signal processes involving second messengers, protein-protein interaction, and the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of interacting proteins.

Front Biosci. 1998; 3: D1134-D1147Google Scholar, 2Black J.D. Front Biosci. 2000; 5: D406-D423Google Scholar). The PKCs comprise a family of intracellular serine/threonine-specific kinases that are, depending on the isoform typically activated by Ca2+, lipid second messengers and/or protein activators (1Toker A. Front Biosci. 1998; 3: D1134-D1147Google Scholar,3Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 105-114Google Scholar). Recently, a more detailed activation model involving PDK1 as a PKC activation loop kinase preceding lipid activation has been established (4Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Google Scholar). A group of kinases with PKC-like functional structures has been described. This kinase family consists of PKCμ (5Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Google Scholar), its mouse homologue termed PKD (6Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Google Scholar), PKCν (7Hayashi A. Seki N. Hattori A. Kozuma S. Saito T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 99-106Google Scholar), and PKD2 (8Sturany S. Van Lint J. Muller F. Wilda M. Hameister H. Hocker M. Brey A. Gern U. Vandenheede J. Gress T. Adler G. Seufferlein T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3310-3318Google Scholar). These kinases share structural homology to PKCs with respect to the catalytic domain and to the presence of amino-terminal cysteine fingers, defining the structural basis for lipid binding. PKCμ/PKD differs from PKC isozymes by an acidic domain (9Gschwendt M. Johannes F.J. Kittstein W. Marks F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20742-20746Google Scholar), a PH domain within the regulatory region (10Gibson T.J. Hyvonen M. Musacchio A. Saraste M. Birney E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 349-353Google Scholar) and the lack of a typical pseudo-substrate site. PKCμ/PKD activation occurs through several mediators via a PKC-dependent pathway (11Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Google Scholar). PKCη and PKCε have been implicated in the activation of PKCμ/PKD through binding to the PKCμ PH domain (12Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9224-9230Google Scholar). Both enzymes associate and, in the case of PKCη, directly phosphorylate the activation loop of PKCμ (13Brandlin I. Hubner S. Eiseler T. Martinez-Moya M. Horschinek A. Hausser A. Link G. Rupp S. Storz P. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6490-6496Google Scholar). Although a precise positioning of the PKC/PKCμ-PKD module in signal transduction pathways is currently unknown, it seems to be part of a kinase cascade that is triggered by multiple cell surface receptors. In the case of PDGF-initiated signal processes, PKCμ/PKD has been placed downstream of phospholipase γ (14Van Lint J. Ni Y. Valius M. Merlevede W. Vandenheede J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7038-7043Google Scholar). This predicts that phospholipase γ-derived diacylglycerol generation results in PKC and consequently PKD/PKCμ activation, triggering p42 MAPK-modulated gene expression (15Hausser A. Storz P. Hubner S. Braendlin I. Martinez-Moya M. Link G. Johannes F.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 39-44Google Scholar). The discovery that PKC activation depends upon an ordered series of phosphorylation events before lipids activate has led to a search for an upstream kinase identifying PDK1 phosphorylating the PKC activation loop (4Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Google Scholar, 16Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Google Scholar). PDK1 is a constitutive active and mainly cytosolic localized kinase that translocates upon growth factor-induced synthesis of 3′-phosphorylated phosphoinositides via its PH domain to the cytoplasm membrane in which it phosphorylates downstream kinases such as Akt (17Storz P. Toker A. Front Biosci. 2002; 7: D886-D902Google Scholar). The discovery that PKCs are activated through PDK1 and that PKC activates PKCμ/PKD implicates that PDK1 is involved in PKCμ activation. We have carried out this study to analyze in detail the activation of PKCμ by upstream kinases and to identify potential downstream pathways. Here we demonstrate that PKCε colocalizes with, phosphorylates, and activates PKCμ. PDK1 activates PKCη and PKCεin vitro, but upon transient expression in HEK293 cells, PDK1 acts only via PKCε and not via PKCη to activate PKCμ, leading to an inhibition of JNK activity. The PDK1 expression constructs and the recombinant enzyme were gifts of Alex Toker (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The construction of the PKCμ and PKCη-GFP expression vectors have been described previously (13Brandlin I. Hubner S. Eiseler T. Martinez-Moya M. Horschinek A. Hausser A. Link G. Rupp S. Storz P.

The PKCε expression vector was a gift of Angelika Hausser (University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany). The construction of the PKCμ-GFP expression construct has been described previously (19Hausser A. Link G. Bamberg L. Burzlaff A. Lutz S. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 65-74Google Scholar). Recombinant expression and purification of PKCμ and His-tagged PKCμK612W either in Sf158 or Sf9 cells were described previously (13Brandlin I. Hubner S.

The monoclonal 9E10 anti c-mycantibody was used for the detection of c-myc-tagged proteins (Roche Diagnostics). Western blot detection was carried out using an alkaline phosphatase-based detection system (Dianova). The cell lines used (HEK293, MCF7) were obtained from ATCC. SF9-produced affinity-purified PKCs were obtained from Calbiochem. 600,000 HEK293 cells were seeded in 6-cm plates 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected using 5 μg of DNA with 30 μl of Superfect (Qiagen) and incubated for 2 h. The transfection mixtures were replaced by fresh medium, and cells were lysed 48 h after transfection (see below). For MCF7 cells, the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. PKCμ-GFP, PKCε, and PDK1 were transfected in HEK293 and MCF7 cells. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) for 15 min at 37 °C. Permeabilization and blocking of the cells were performed by incubation with 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 30 min. The cells were rinsed three times with PBS and then incubated with the primary antibody against PKCε, PDK1, and PKCμ (0.2 μg/ml) for 2 h (0.05% Tween 20 and 5% fetal bovine serum in PBS). For immunofluorescence detection of PKCη, cells were incubated with a secondary anti-rabbit antibody (Alexa-46-conjugated, 1:1000, MobiTec) for 2 h. PDK1 was stained with an anti-c-myc monoclonal antibody and visualized with Cy3-labeled anti-mouse antibody. After staining, the cells were rinsed four times with PBS and prepared for microscopic analysis. Images were acquired using a confocal laser scanning microscope (TCS SP2, Leica) equipped with a ×100/1.4 HCX PlanAPO oil-immersion objective. GFP was excited with an argon laser (488-nm line), whereas Alexa-546 was excited using a helium-neon laser (543-nm line). Each image represents a two dimensional parallel projection of sections in the z-series taken at 0.8–0.9-μm intervals across the cell. Cells were lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride). After 30-min incubation on ice, the lysates were centrifuged at 10 000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (21Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Dieterich S. Oberhagemann P. Link G. Pfizenmaier K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 303-307Google Scholar). 1 ml of lysate was incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C with 5 μl of the antibody. Immunocomplexes were harvested by adding 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose, incubated for 1 h, and washed twice with lysis buffer and one time with PBS. The samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane. For in vitro kinase assays, the immunoprecipitates were washed additionally in 1 ml of phosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol). Kinase reaction with or without 2.5 μg of syntide 2 as a substrate was started by adding 4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (AmershamBiosciences) in 20 μl of kinase buffer and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. For in vitro phosphorylation, reactions 450 units of recombinant protein PKCs were used in a volume of 40 μl of phosphorylation buffer. Enzyme assays were carried out in the presence of lipid micelles as described previously (20Dieterich S. Herget T. Link G. Bottinger H. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 183-187Google Scholar). In vitroactivation of autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation of 10 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP, Sigma) and 2.5 μg of syntide 2 (Sigma) by recombinant PKCη in the presence or absence of lipid micelles was tested (data not shown). JNK assays were performed as described previously (22Wajant H. Johannes F.J. Haas E. Siemienski K. Schwenzer R. Schubert G. Weiss T. Grell M. Scheurich P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 113-116Google Scholar). Equal amounts of glutathioneS-transferase-fusion protein used were verified by Ponceau staining. Phosphorylation reactions were stopped by adding 5× concentrated sample buffer subsequently fractionated on a SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and exposed to autoradiography. Syntide 2 phosphorylation was monitored by autoradiography after fractionation on 20% SDS-PAGE followed by drying of the gel. Autoradiographs were analyzed by using phosphorimaging analysis (Amersham Biosciences). In vitro kinase experiments and coimmunoprecipitations were performed at least three times. Shown are representative autoradiographs and immunoblots. We have recently shown that PKCμ is phosphorylated and activated by PKCη (13Brandlin I. Hubner S. Eiseler T. Martinez-Moya M. Horschinek A. Hausser A. Link G. Rupp S. Storz P. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6490-6496Google Scholar). These findings together with independent studies showing association of PKD with PKCη and to lesser degree with PKCε (12Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9224-9230Google Scholar) allow us to postulate that PKCε might also act as a direct upstream kinase for PKD/PKCμ. Earlier studies were in favor of this hypothesis, showing that PKCε similar to PKCμ is located at the Golgi compartment (23Lehel C. Olah Z. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1406-1410Google Scholar, 24Prestle J. Pfizenmaier K. Brenner J. Johannes F.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1401-1410Google Scholar). Because PKCμ has been demonstrated to translocate from the cytoplasm to the Golgi compartment thus leading to the appearance of an activated enzyme (19Hausser A. Link G. Bamberg L. Burzlaff A. Lutz S. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 65-74Google Scholar, 25Maeda Y. Beznoussenko G.V. Van Lint J. Mironov A.A. Malhotra V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5982-5990Google Scholar), PKCε can be considered as an upstream kinase phosphorylating the activation loop of PKCμ, which has already been demonstrated for PKCη (13Brandlin I. Hubner S. Eiseler T. Martinez-Moya M. Horschinek A. Hausser A. Link G. Rupp S. Storz P. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6490-6496Google Scholar). Using in vitro kinase assays, we have tested whether recombinant PKCη, PKCε, and PDK1 are able to phosphorylate recombinant Sf9-produced purified PKCμ, leading to kinase activation. As shown in Fig. 1,left-hand panels, recombinant PKCμ displays autophosphorylation leading to substrate (syntide 2) phosphorylation, whereas kinase-dead His-tagged PKCμK612W shows no evidence of autophosphorylation at all (Fig. 1). PKCμK612W phosphorylation is enhanced by adding purified SF9-expressed PKCη (positive control) and also, to a significantly higher degree, by adding purified PKCε (Fig. 1, upper panel), thus indicating a direct phosphorylation as shown for PKCη. In contrast to the phosphorylation of kinase-dead PKCμ by PKCε, the phosphorylation of wild-type PKCμ leads to a significant enhancement of syntide 2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1, lower panel). SF9-expressed purified PKCη and PKCε do not phosphorylate syntide 2 significantly but do show autophosphorylation (Fig. 1). As a control for nonspecific phosphorylation, purified PDK1 was used to phosphorylate PKCμ. No enhancement of PKCμ phosphorylation by recombinant PDK1 was detected, demonstrating the specificity of PKCη- and PKCε-mediated PKCμ activation. PKD has been shown to be associated with PKCε using biochemical techniques such as in vitro pull-down assays using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins and coimmunoprecipitations (12Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9224-9230Google Scholar). Based on these data, we questioned whether both enzymes colocalize in HEK293 cells. Immunofluorescence analysis was performed after transient coexpression of a PKCμ-GFP fusion protein with PKCε in HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 2, PKCμ was localized in perinuclear structures (Fig. 2, center panel) similarly as PKCε (left-hand panel). An overlay of both pictures shows colocalization indicated by the yellow color (Fig. 2,upper row, right-hand panel). PKCs are activated through a complex cascade involving lipids and the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase PDK1 (4Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Google Scholar, 16Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Google Scholar, 26Toker A. Newton A.C. Cell. 2000; 103: 185-188Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested in analyzing the role of PDK1 in PKC/PKCμ activation. First, we tested whether cellular colocalization can be demonstrated upon transient expression of PDK1 and PKCε. As shown in Fig. 2, second row, the colocalization of PKCε and PDK1 can be seen albeit to a lesser extent. These findings correlated with published data (4Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Google Scholar) demonstrating a complex between PDK1 and several PKC isotypes. This prompted us to test whether PKCη colocalizes with PDK1. Upon transient coexpression of PDK1 and PKCη-GFP, a weaker colocalization can be demonstrated compared with PDK1 and PKCε (Fig. 2, upper and center panels). Similarly, as demonstrated in HEK293 cells, colocalization could be shown in the mammary epithelial cell line MCF7 upon transient coexpression of PKCμ-GFP with PKCε and, to lesser degree, of PKCε with PDK1 (Fig. 2, fourth and fifth row). These data demonstrate an intracellular complex between PDK1 and PKCμ with PKC isozymes. Previous studies demonstrated phosphorylation of selected PKC isotypes by PDK1 at the activation loop as well as the presence of a complex between PKC and PDK1 (4Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Google Scholar, 16Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Google Scholar). Therefore, we further analyzed the association between PDK1 and PKCη using biochemical techniques. PKCη wild type and mutants were coexpressed with c-myc-tagged PDK1 and a kinase-dead mutant PDK1K112W. From the obtained cell lysates, 90% were used to immunoprecipitate PDK1 with an anti c-myc antibody to detect PDK1 (Fig. 3, center panel) and to detect associated PKCη (Fig. 3, upper panel). 10% of the lysates were used to estimate PKCη expression (Fig. 3, lower panel). Immunoprecipitation efficiency of PKCη was monitored using the same amount of cell lysate as used for coimmunoprecipitations (Fig. 3, right lane,upper panel). There was no endogenously expressed PKCη detectable in anti-c-myc immunoprecipitates, whereas kinase-dead PKCηK/R, constitutive active PKCηA/E, as well as transiently expressed wild-type PKCη were readily detected in PDK1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3,upper panel). Apparently, the association of PKCη/PDK1 is independent of PDK1 kinase activity. In immunoprecipitates of PDK1K112W as well as in wild-type PDK1, PKCη could be detected. Interestingly, kinase-dead PDK1 showed a faster migration in SDS-PAGE compared with wild-type PDK1, which may be attributed to the lack of autophosphorylation (Fig. 3, center panel). In addition, PKCη migration showed a shift in PDK1 immunoprecipitates, which is probably because of PDK1-dependent phosphorylation and which is absent in PDK1K112W immunoprecipitates (Fig.3, upper panel). PDK1/PKCη association is independent of phosphorylation/autophosphorylation as coimmunoprecipitates of kinase-dead mutants coprecipitate with the same efficiency as the wild-type enzymes. Expression levels of PKCηWT and of the mutants used were monitored by Western blot detection (Fig. 3,lower panel). As shown in Fig. 3, the differential migration of PKCη in PDK1 immunoprecipitates (upper panel) indicated a phosphorylation of PKCη through PDK1. Therefore, we further analyzed these findings using in vitro kinase assays of PKCη immunoprecipitates. PKCη was expressed as a GFP-fusion protein in HEK293 cells, migrating at a different size in SDS-PAGE as PDK1. This expression clearly enables a distinction to be made between PKCη phosphorylation from the PDK1 autophosphorylation signal. PKCη was immunoprecipitated using a COOH-terminal antiserum and in vitro phosphorylated with SF9-produced purified PDK1. As shown in Fig.4 A, upper panel, PDK1 incubation leads to an enhancement of the PKCη phosphorylation band demonstrating a direct phosphorylation by PDK1. Phosphorylation of immunoprecipitates from kinase-dead PKCηK/R by PDK1 was also monitored but could not be clearly distinguished from the strong autophosphorylation signal of PDK1, as both enzymes migrate at similar size in SDS-PAGE (data not shown). As a control, PKCη expression levels are shown using Western blot detection (Fig. 4 A,lower panel). We further estimated whether PKCη-mediated PDK1 phosphorylation leads to an enhanced substrate phosphorylation efficiency of PKCη. PKCη immunoprecipitates were incubated with the in vitrosubstrate MBP. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the enhancement of MBP phosphorylation could be shown approximately upon 5-min incubation, decreasing within a 1-h period. Under the same experimental conditions, the addition of purified PDK1 significantly enhances the substrate phosphorylation capacity of PKCη, which shows high activation levels after just 3 min decreasing to approximate basal levels within a period of 60 min (Fig. 4 B, lower panel). Using similar amounts of PKCη immunoprecipitates, a significant enhancement in substrate phosphorylation efficiency can be demonstrated upon incubation with PDK1, which demonstrates an in vitroactivation of PKCη through PDK1 in accordance with the phosphorylation data. PDK1 acts as an upstream kinase for PKCη (Fig. 4) and PKCε (4Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Google Scholar). Both enzymes activate PKCμ, predicting that a three-level activation cascade amplifies input signals and consequently enhancing PKCμ substrate phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we coexpressed PDK1, PKCη/ε, and PKCμ to measure PKCμ activation. The coexpression of PKCη or PKCε with PKCμ leads to stronger syntide 2 phosphorylation of PKCμ immunoprecipitates (Fig.5 A, lower panel) than from PKCμ-transfected HEK293 cells. Coexpression of PDK1, PKCε, and PKCμ also leads to the enhancement of syntide 2 phosphorylation of PKCμ immunoprecipitates and similarly of immunoprecipitates from PKCε/PKCη- and PKCμ-transfected cells. The expression of kinase-dead PDK1 with PKCε and PKCμ reversed this effect, showing an inhibition of PKCμ substrate phosphorylation (Fig.5 A, lower panel). PDK1 acts completely differently on PKCη-triggered PKCμ activation in HEK293 cells. The coexpression of PDK1 with PKCη and PKCμ leads to a significant reduction in syntide 2 phosphorylation of PKCμ immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5 A, lower panel). Coexpressing PKCη with kinase-dead PDK1K112W largely does not affect PKCμ activation. These data suggest a PDK1- and PKCε-dependent pathway leading to PKCμ activation. The coexpression of PDK1 and PDK1K112W does not notably influence the substrate phosphorylation efficiency of PKCμ immunoprecipitates (data not shown). Under the experimental conditions used here, i.e.coexpression of PKCμ with the indicated upstream kinases, the phosphorylation state of PKCμ immunoprecipitates only showed weak changes (Fig. 5 A, upper panel), representing most probably a basal autophosphorylation. Expression levels of PKCμ immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5 A, center panel) and transgenic expression (data not shown) were verified using Western blot analysis. Kinase activity and protein expression of all expression constructs used for cotransfection experiments were analyzed throughin vitro kinase assays and immunoblots (Fig. 5 A,right-hand panels). PDK1 is able to phosphorylate and activate PKCη in vitro(Fig. 4) in a similar way as PKCε (4Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Google Scholar). In contrast, upon transient expression of PDK1 with PKCη/PKCε and PKCμ, only PKCε is activated, thus leading to PKCμ phosphorylation. Therefore, we measured the activation state of PKCε and PKCη upon coexpression with PDK1 and/or PKCμ. As shown in Fig. 5 B by the autophosphorylation and MBP phosphorylation of PKC immunoprecipitates, PDK1 activates PKCε and PKCη. Upon additional coexpression of PKCμ, PKCε kinase activity is unaffected, whereas PKCη kinase activity is reduced. Expression levels of PKC immunoprecipitates used for in vitro kinase assays as well as transgenic expression were monitored using Western blot analysis (data not shown). Furthermore, we analyzed whether PKCη phosphorylates PKCμ at amino-terminal regulatory serine residues, serving as a binding domain for regulatory proteins as 14-3-3 (27Hausser A. Storz P. Link G. Stoll H. Liu Y.C. Altman A. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9258-9264Google Scholar). This could potentially result in the inhibition of PKCμ kinase activity, e.g. by binding of 14-3-3 proteins. The amino-terminal domain of PKCμ was transiently expressed as a GFP fusion protein and immunoprecipitated. The immunoprecipitates of constitutive active PKCηA/E, kinase-dead PKCηK/R (as a negative control), and PKCμ were used to phosphorylate PKCμ1–325GFP. As shown in Fig. 5 C, strong phosphorylation of PKCμ1–325GFP could be obtained using PKCμ immunoprecipitates but not with PKCηA/Eimmunoprecipitates. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot for the presence of the respected enzymes and fusion proteins (data not shown). In accordance with experiments showing phosphorylation-dependent shifts (19Hausser A. Link G. Bamberg L. Burzlaff A. Lutz S. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 65-74Google Scholar) upon coexpression of PKCη or PKCμ with PKCμ1–325GFP (data not shown), our data indicate that PKCη does not phosphorylate amino-terminal serine residues of PKCμ. These findings show that the inhibition of PKCη upon coexpression of PDK1 and PKCμ must occur via a different mechanism. Because in living cells, both novel PKC isozymes act differentially on the activation state of PKCμ, downstream effectors may be similarly influenced. Several laboratories have shown that PKCμ/PKD activation negatively interferes with the activation of the JNK pathway (13Brandlin I. Hubner S. Eiseler T. Martinez-Moya M. Horschinek A. Hausser A. Link G. Rupp S. Storz P. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6490-6496Google Scholar, 28Hurd C. Rozengurt E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 404-408Google Scholar, 29Bagowski C.P. Stein-Gerlach M. Choidas A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5567-5576Google Scholar). JNK has been shown to colocalize with PKD upon overexpression in COS cells (30Hurd C. Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2154-2160Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the PKCμ regulation of JNK activity is triggered via PDK1/PKCη or PDK1/PKCε. JNK activation was measured upon transfection of the indicated expression constructs (Fig.6) by the in vitrophosphorylation of glutathione S-transferase c-jun using JNK immunoprecipitates. As a positive control for JNK activity, cells were stimulated with tumor necrosis factor. As shown in Fig. 6, JNK activity is largely unaffected by the transfection of PKCμ. Transient expression of PKCε leads to a moderate effect on JNK activity, which can be strongly enhanced through the coexpression of PKCε with PDK1. These findings correspond with earlier studies showing PKCε activation of JNK in myocytes (31Li R.C. Ping P. Zhang J. Wead W.B. Cao X. Gao J. Zheng Y. Huang S. Han J. Bolli R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H1679-H1689Google Scholar). PDK1 expression leads to some enhancement of JNK activity. Interestingly, the coexpression of PDK1 with PKCε and PKCμ leads to a significant inhibition of JNK activity. This correlates with the activation state of PKCμ kinase activity (Fig. 5). Using the same experimental approach, PKCη leads to some JNK activity, whereas the expression of PKCη and PKCμ or PDK1/PKCη with PKCμ does not significantly affect JNK activity. As shown by Western blot analyses, endogenous PKCε is significantly expressed, but endogenous PKCη cannot be detected in HEK293 cells (Fig. 6, center panels). These findings clearly indicate PKCε as the biological relevant upstream kinase in HEK293 cells, triggering PKCμ downstream signaling pathways such as the JNK activation. At the same time, a PKCε-triggered pathway exists in HEK293 cells independently of PKCμ triggering JNK activation. The results of this study including published data (13Brandlin I. Hubner S. Eiseler T. Martinez-Moya M. Horschinek A. Hausser A. Link G. Rupp S. Storz P. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6490-6496Google Scholar) are shown in diagrammatic form in Fig. 7. In this study, we have demonstrated that PKCε acts as an upstream kinase in a similar way as previously shown for PKCη, directly phosphorylating PKCμ in vitro and enhancing its substrate phosphorylation efficiency. Using confocal analysis, we have also shown an intracellular colocalization of PKCε and PKCμ in different cell types and a colocalization of the upstream kinase PDK1 with PKCε and PKCη. The latter results were independently confirmed by biochemical coprecipitation. Although we are able to show a direct phosphorylation and activation of PKCη through PDK1 in vitro, PDK1 activation of PKCη does not lead to PKCμ activation in vivo in HEK293 cells. In contrast to PKCη, PDK1-mediated PKCε activation triggers in vivo PKCμ activation, resulting in an inhibition of JNK. This indicates a PDK1/PKCε/PKCμ activation cascade in HEK293 cells. In a recent study, we have demonstrated that PKCη acts as an activation loop kinase for PKCμ (13Brandlin I. Hubner S. Eiseler T. Martinez-Moya M. Horschinek A. Hausser A. Link G. Rupp S. Storz P. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6490-6496Google Scholar). These findings in accordance with earlier data from other laboratories (11Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Google Scholar, 12Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9224-9230Google Scholar) indicate a direct phosphorylation of PKCμ by PKCη and PKCε. In consequence, using purified PKCε/PKCη and PKCμ enzymes, we are able to demonstrate the direct phosphorylation of PKCμ, leading to an enhanced enzymatic activity (Fig. 1) (13Brandlin I. Hubner S. Eiseler T. Martinez-Moya M. Horschinek A. Hausser A. Link G. Rupp S. Storz P. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6490-6496Google Scholar). Similarly to PKCη, PKCε also colocalizes intracellularly with PKCμ (Fig. 2), indicating a functional relationship with the Golgi compartment as both enzymes were reported to be localized and involved in Golgi-specific functions (23Lehel C. Olah Z. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1406-1410Google Scholar, 24Prestle J. Pfizenmaier K. Brenner J. Johannes F.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1401-1410Google Scholar). The discovery of the intracellular colocalization of both PKC isotypes with PDK1 is of interest in terms of their functional relationship. For PKCε and PDK1, colocalization and activation has already been published previously (4Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate the biochemical colocalization for PKCη and PDK1 that is independent of either PDK1 or PKCη kinase activity (Fig. 3). The finding that kinase-dead PKCηK/R migrates with a slower relative molecular weight in PDK1 immunoprecipitates already indicates a shift attributed to PDK1 phosphorylation. Consequently, we have demonstrated a direct phosphorylation of PKCη by PDK1, which in turn activates PKCη (Fig.4). PKC activation is thought to be triggered by the initial phosphorylation of PDK1 at the activation loop followed by autophosphorylation in the hydrophobic motif, finally allowing cellular activation through lipids (for review see Ref. 17Storz P. Toker A. Front Biosci. 2002; 7: D886-D902Google Scholar). The data published until now predict that PDK1 acts as the activation loop kinase either for conventional PKCs (16Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Google Scholar), atypical PKC (32Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee M.H. Chen C.S. Newton A.C. Schaffhausen B.S. Toker A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1069-1077Google Scholar), or novel PKCs (4Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Google Scholar), which is corroborated by our data showing activation loop phosphorylation of PKCη (Fig. 4). These findings are not unexpected as the primary structure of the activation loop of PKC isotypes is significantly conserved (17Storz P. Toker A. Front Biosci. 2002; 7: D886-D902Google Scholar). The spatio temporal aspects of PKCμ activation are currently unclear. As activated enzyme is located at the Golgi, activation could occur by recruiting PKCs and PDK1 to the Golgi. PKCε has been reported to be localized via the C1 domain at the Golgi (23Lehel C. Olah Z. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1406-1410Google Scholar). PDK1 could be recruited via direct binding to PKC (Fig. 4) (4Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Google Scholar) or by binding to Golgi-generated phosphatidylinositol phosphate 2 (33Jones D.H. Morris J.B. Morgan C.P. Kondo H. Irvine R.F. Cockcroft S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13962-13966Google Scholar), which has been shown to bind the PH domain of PDK1 (34Currie R.A. Walker K.S. Gray A. Deak M. Casamayor A. Downes C.P. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Lucocq J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 575-583Google Scholar). Taking into account the in vitro data showing activation of PKCη by PDK1, it is of interest to note that upon transient expression of PDK1 with PKCε or PKCη and PKCμ, activation of PKCμ occurs only through PKCε (Fig. 5). Upon coexpression of PDK1 and PKCη with PKCμ, PKCη is inhibited (Fig. 5 B), which points to a negative regulation through PDK1 and PKCμ. As PKCμ is downstream PKCη, a negative feedback loop regulated by PKCμ can be postulated. We could further exclude the inhibition of PKCμ via direct phosphorylation of amino-terminal serines through PKCη (Fig.5 C). These serines are considered as binding domains for negatively regulatory proteins as 14-3-3 (27Hausser A. Storz P. Link G. Stoll H. Liu Y.C. Altman A. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9258-9264Google Scholar, 35Vertommen D. Rider M. Ni Y. Waelkens E. Merlevede W. Vandenheede J.R. Van Lint J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19567-19576Google Scholar). Selective activation of PKCμ through PKCε further acts on downstream signaling cascades such as JNK. The PDK1 dependence of PKCs explains our earlier findings of expressing a constitutive active mutant of PKCη with PKCμ and thus inhibiting JNK activity. This mutant (PKCηA/E) most probably bypasses the need for PDK1 activation, leading to PKCμ activation and inhibition of JNK (13Brandlin I. Hubner S. Eiseler T. Martinez-Moya M. Horschinek A. Hausser A. Link G. Rupp S. Storz P. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6490-6496Google Scholar). The finding that PDK1 and PKCε coexpression in HEK293 cells leads to enhanced JNK activation indicates a PKCε-dependent JNK activation, which has to be distinguished from the opposite effect, namely the PKCε/PKCμ mediated inhibition of JNK activity. PKCε is involved in several cellular functions in which the PKCμ-mediated effect seems to be dominant via PKCε-mediated JNK activation. A recent study reported a negative regulation of JNK through PKD by the physical interaction of activated PKD with JNK, leading to the inhibition of JNK and c-jun phosphorylation by the sterical blocking of substrate access (30Hurd C. Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2154-2160Google Scholar). In an earlier study, direct phosphorylation of Thr-654/Thr-669 of the EGF receptor via PKCμ has been suggested. This probably leads to negative interference with EGF-induced JNK activation through the PDGF-mediated activation of PKCμ (see Fig. 7) (29Bagowski C.P. Stein-Gerlach M. Choidas A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5567-5576Google Scholar). Both models complement each other, implicating a PDGF-induced activation of PKCμ/PKD via PDK1/PKCε and leading to the phosphorylation of the EGF receptor and, in parallel, the complexing of JNK with PKCμ/PKD. This would provide a potential parallel switch effectively shutting down JNK via PKCμ activation. PKCμ activation through distinct PKC subtypes probably reflects cell-type/tissue-specific functions. PKCη expression has been associated with the cellular differentiation of keratinocytes (36Ohba M. Ishino K. Kashiwagi M. Kawabe S. Chida K. Huh N.H. Kuroki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5199-5207Google Scholar), which do strongly express PKCμ (37Rennecke J. Rehberger P.A. Furstenberger G. Johannes F.J. Stohr M. Marks F. Richter K.H. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 98-103Google Scholar). In contrast, PKCη is not detected in HEK293 cells, whereas endogenous PKCε is expressed significantly higher (Fig. 6, center panel), pointing to an endogenous PKCμ activation via PKCε. Keratinocyte differentiation is dependent upon PKCη (38Cabodi S. Calautti E. Talora C. Kuroki T. Stein P.L. Dotto G.P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1121-1129Google Scholar) and is accompanied by the down-regulation of EGF receptor signaling (39Medema J.P. Sark M.W. Backendorf C. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7078-7085Google Scholar). These findings point to a role played by PKCη activated via PDK1, thus, phosphorylating the activation loop of PKCμ and resulting in the phosphorylation of the EGF receptor and to a role in initial signal events preceding cellular differentiation in this cell type.

In the setting of inflammation, not only is the ECM the target of inflammation, but its breakdown products modulate the magnitude and quality of an immune response. Fragments of the ECM component hyaluronan (HA) induce macrophage expression of chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors as well greatly enhance IFN-γ-induced MIG expression. In this report, we demonstrate that the synergistic induction of MIG by HA and IFN-γ occurs at the level of transcription via NF-κB. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and reporter assays, we have identified two NF-κB sites proximal to the IFN-γ-responsive element-1 (γRE-1) that mediate this effect. Interestingly, our experiments also revealed a critical role for NF-κB in mediating IFN-γ-induced MIG expression independent of HA.

During inflammation, there is increased production and degradation of ECM components such as fibronectin, collagen, and glycosaminoglycans. This results in the accumulation of lower molecular weight products (2Hance A.J. Crystal R.G. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1975; 112: 657-668PubMed Google Scholar).

HA is found in a high molecular weight form in the ECM of all tissues. In its native form, it exists as a nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan polymer made up of repeating disaccharide units of (β1-4)-d-glucuronic acid-(β1-3)-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine with a molecular mass in excess of 106 Da (7Laurent T.

Our data identify NF-κB activation as mediating the cross-talk between the ECM and IFN-γ. Furthermore, our studies have also uncovered a previously uncharacterized critical role for NF-κB in mediating IFN-γ-induced STAT activation of MIG independent of HA.DISCUSSIONLow molecular weight HA fragments can stimulate mouse macrophages to express numerous chemokines, and IFN-γ can regulate HA-induced chemokine expression (10Horton M.R.

Puré E. J. Immunol. 1997; 15: 2492-2500Google Scholar). Although HA alone does not induce MIG expression in murine macrophages, it does synergize with IFN-γ to further induce MIG expression at the level of transcription (17Horton M.R. McKee C.M. Bao C. Liao F. Farber J.M. Hodge-DuFour J. Pure E. Oliver B.L. Wright T.M. Noble P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35088-35094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).It is known that HA has the ability to activate NF-κB, and indeed, in the present studies, pharmacologic inhibition of this signal transduction pathway inhibited the ability of HA to synergize with IFN-γ to up-regulate MIG (12McKee C.

Med. 2002; 195: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of theMIG proximal promoter revealed two potential NF-κB-like binding sites at −129 and −154. Using EMSA, we found increased binding at these sites in extracts from HA-stimulated cells. Furthermore, transient transfection assays confirmed the functional role of these binding sites in mediating the synergistic effect between HA and IFN-γ as mutations in both sites were required to completely eliminate the synergy. Surprisingly, the −129 and −154 sites were also necessary for the full induction of MIG by IFN-γ alone. Mutations at either of these sites individually decreased IFN-γ-induced MIG expression. Mutations at both the −129 and −154 sites together dramatically inhibited IFN-γ-induced MIG. Thus, even in the absence of HA-induced NF-κB activation, our data suggest that NF-κB plays an important role in the full induction of MIG by IFN-γ.In general, it is felt that IFN-γ signaling acts via STAT-1α and does not activate NF-κB (40Imada K. Leonard W.J. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 41Ransohoff R.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 616-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 42Schindler C.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 6170-6180Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This concept is consistent with our own EMSA data that did not show an up-regulation of NF-κB binding upon stimulation with IFN-γ alone. However, our data suggest that upon stimulation with IFN-γ, NF-κB family members cooperate with IFN-γ-induced STAT-1α to induce MIG expression perhaps via the recruitment of a coactivator. Inhibition of the individual sites (−154 or −129) leads to a decrease in IFN-γ-induced MIG expression. Furthermore, mutating both the −129 and the −154 sites simultaneously completely inhibits NF-κB binding, resulting in marked diminution of IFN-γ-induced MIG expression. Upon stimulation with HA, IκB is degraded, and p50/p65 heterodimers are free to translocate to the nucleus and bind to the MIG promoter. We propose that the activated p50/p65 heterodimers account for HA-induced synergy of MIG expression (Fig. 7). Consistent with this model are our results using the drug PS-1, which inhibited HA-induced synergy but did not inhibit IFN-γ-induced MIG expression (Fig. 2). PS-1 acts by blocking the degradation of IκB and hence the ability of p50/p65 heterodimers to translocate to the nucleus. Based on the work of Wong et al. (34Wong P. Severns C.W. Guyer N.B. Wright T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), our results are somewhat surprising. Using transient transfection assays, this group determined that the γRE-1 was necessary and sufficient for IFN-γ-induced MIG expression (independent of the −129 and −154 sites) (34Wong P. Severns C.W. Guyer N.B. Wright T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). However, their reporter assays employed either multimers of the γRE-1 or the γRE-1 upstream of a thymidine kinase promoter, and perhaps such constructs served to emphasize the role of STAT-1α in MIG transcription, mitigating the potential role of NF-κB (34Wong P. Severns C.W. Guyer N.B. Wright T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar).It is becoming increasingly clear that coactivation molecules such as CREB-binding protein and p300 play important roles in integrating diverse signals leading to transcription (44Shenkar R.

In our system, we would propose that such coactivators serve to integrate cytokine signaling (IFN-γ) and environmental signals induced by the extracellular matrix (HA). Indeed, both CREB-binding protein and p300 bind to STAT and NF-κB to promote transcription (44Shenkar R. Yum H.K. Arcaroli J. Kupfner J. Abraham E. Am. J.

They have shown that IFN-γ-induced CD40 transcription requires both STAT-1α and NF-κB (48Nguyen V.T. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 13796-13803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In their model, however, NF-κB binding is the result of IFN-γ-induced TNF-α production that in turn leads to the activation of NF-κB (48Nguyen V.T. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23674-23684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar,49Nguyen V.T. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13796-13803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In our experiments, we do not believe TNF-α is playing a role inMIG activation since we have shown previously that IFN-γ-induced MIG and the synergy between HA and IFN-γ occur in the presence of TNF-α neutralizing antibodies as well as in experiments using macrophages from TNF-α knockout mice (17Horton M.R. McKee C.M. Bao C. Liao F. Farber J.M. Hodge-DuFour J. Pure E. Oliver B.L. Wright T.M. Noble P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35088-35094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).Interestingly, the necessity of the NF-κB binding sites in the IFN-γ-induced expression of MIG suggests that these NF-κB binding sequences are not empty but rather occupied by NF-κB family members, as suggested in Figs. 3, 4, and 6. Recently it has been shown that p50 homodimers can bind DNA and in fact are necessary for transcriptional activation of the bcl-2 gene (50Michalopoulos I. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 51Kurland J.F. Kodym R. Story M.D. Spurgers K.B. McDonnell T.J. Meyn R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45380-45386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, potentially constitutively expressed NF-κB family members such as p50 homodimers or p50 complexed with an as yet unidentified protein are playing a direct role in IFN-γ-induced transcription or an indirect role by bending the DNA in such a way that improves STAT-1α binding and allows for increased transcription. The faint bands binding to the −154 and −129 sites using extracts from unstimulated and IFN-γ-stimulated cells (Figs. 3 and 4) as well as the experiments using consensus NF-κB probe (Fig. 6) demonstrate that at the very least, p50 is available for binding in the IFN-γ-stimulated cells. Whether this binding is in the form of p50 homodimers or heterodimers consisting of p50 and other NF-κB family members is currently under investigation. Nevertheless, such a model might even predict a role for a coactivator even in the absence of NF-κB signaling. The marked induction of MIG in the presence of HA and IFN-γ, as opposed to IFN-γ alone, may be the result of cooperative induction of MIG by the HA-induced NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimers promoting more efficient coactivator binding or perhaps even a different co-activator. Experiments are underway to demonstrate the ability of p300 to not only mediate IFN-γ plus HA-mediated up-regulation of MIG but also the up-regulation of MIG by IFN-γ alone.NF-κB signaling is emerging as an important mechanism by which cells of the immune system detect foreign invaders. It has been shown that lipopolysaccharide, CpG DNA, and bacteria-derived flagelin all activate the innate immune response via toll-like receptors and NF-κB signaling (52An H., Yu, Y.

In our model, “degraded self” in the form of low molecular weight HA serves a similar role by activating NF-κB signaling and modulating macrophage function. The importance of low molecular weight HA in participating in the immune response has recently been dramatically demonstrated in a bleomycin model of lung injury in the CD44 knockout mice (55Teder P. Vandivier R.W. Jiang D. Liang J. Cohn L. Pure E. Henson P.M. Noble P.W. Science. 2002; 296: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). These mice are unable to remove degraded HA and thus accumulate low molecular weight HA in their lungs that results in uncontrolled inflammation and death after bleomycin lung injury (55Teder P. Vandivier R.W. Jiang D. Liang J. Cohn L. Pure E. Henson P.M. Noble P.W. Science. 2002; 296: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). In this light, ECM breakdown products are revealed as not only the targets of inflammation but as important modulators of the inflammatory process.

A complex array of proteins and high molecular weight proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans, the ECM in healthy tissues maintains homeostasis and matrix structure (1Hidenori K. Raines E.W. Bornfeldt K.E. Roberts J.M. Ross R. Cell. 1996; 87: 1069-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). During inflammation, there is increased production and degradation of ECM components such as fibronectin, collagen, and glycosaminoglycans. This results in the accumulation of lower molecular weight products (2Hance A.J. Crystal R.G. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1975; 112: 657-668PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the high molecular weight forms of these glycoproteins appear to be biologically inert to cells, the lower molecular weight ECM breakdown components activate inflammatory cells inducing proliferation, elaboration of cytokines and enzymes, and up-regulation of a variety of cell surface markers (1Hidenori K.

Our laboratory has focused on the biologic properties of the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA). HA is found in a high molecular weight form in the ECM of all tissues. In its native form, it exists as a nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan polymer made up of repeating disaccharide units of (β1-4)-d-glucuronic acid-(β1-3)-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine with a molecular mass in excess of 106 Da (7Laurent T.

High molecular weight HA is believed to have many functions in healthy tissue such as water homeostasis, plasma protein distribution, and matrix structuring (7Laurent T. Fraser J.

These lower molecular weight forms of HA stimulate macrophages to produce important mediators of tissue injury and repair such as macrophage inflammatory protein-1α, macrophage inflammatory protein-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), inducible nitric oxide synthase, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and macrophage metalloelastase (10Horton M.R.

Thus, cellular activation and regulation within the inflammatory milieu are influenced by the biologic activity of low molecular weight ECM breakdown products. We have shown that HA fragments can synergize with the cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ) to induce the antifibrotic chemokines monokine induced by interferon-γ (MIG) and interferon-inducible protein-10 (17Horton M.R.

https://openalex.org/W2072890392,"The pituitary-specific POU homeodomain factor Pit-1 likely interacts with other factors for cell-specific expression of prolactin. Here we identify the paired-like homeobox transcription factors Pitx1 and Pitx2 as factors functionally activating the proximal human prolactin promoter (hPRL-164luc). Using in vitrobinding assays and a series of site-specific mutations of the proximalhPRL promoter, we mapped the B1 and B2 bicoid sites involved in Pitx-mediated transactivation of the hPRL-164luc construct. In somatolactotroph GH4C1 cells, basal proximal hPRLpromoter activity was inhibited by a Pitx2 dominant-negative form in a dose-dependent manner, whereas binding disruptive mutations in the Pitx sites significantly reduced basal activity of the promoter. We also show that synergistic activation of hPRL-164luc by Pitx2 and Pit-1 requires the integrity of the B2 Pitx binding site, and at least one of the P1 and P2 Pit-1 response elements. In addition, mutation in the B2 Pitx site results in attenuation of the promoter's responsiveness to forskolin, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, and epidermal growth factor. Conversely, Pitx1 or Pitx2 overexpression in GH4C1 cells leads to an enhancement of the drugs stimulatory effects. Altogether, these results suggest that full responsiveness to several signaling pathways regulating the hPRL promoter requires the B2 Pitx binding site and that Pitx factors may be part of the proteic complex involved in these regulations. Finally, in situ hybridization analysis showing coexpression of thePRL and Pitx2 genes in rat and human lactotroph cells corroborates the physiological relevance of these results.

Martial J.A. Muller M. Neuroendocrinology. 2000; 71: 124-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Different parts of the hPRLpromoter are subjected to regulation by a variety of hormones and neuromediators. Dopamine (DA) is the main negative regulator of PRL expression: its binding to the dopamine type 2 receptor leads to reduction of intracellular cAMP levels and inhibition of cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA) activity, leading to decreased hPRL expression (2Van de Weerdt C. Peers B. Belayew A. Martial J.A. Muller M. Neuroendocrinology. 2000; 71: 124-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Conversely, hormones such as vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) are able to activate PRL expression by increasing the intracellular cAMP concentration (5Murdoch G.H. Waterman M. Evans R.M. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11852-11858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hormones and growth factors such as insulin and epidermal growth factor (EGF) lead to a stimulation of the promoter activity mediated by the transmembrane tyrosine kinases. Finally, factors such as thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) can induce another second messenger, Ca2+, which can stimulatePRL promoter activity (5Murdoch G.H. Waterman M. Evans R.M. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11852-11858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All these second messenger pathways converge to the nucleus where their effects are ultimately mediated by transcription factors. The most important and best studied of these transcription factors is Pit-1, a POU homeodomain factor governing temporal and spatial cell-specific expression of PRL, growth hormone (GH), and thyrotropin-stimulating hormone β (TSHβ) genes in response to diverse signaling cascades (6Li S.

Two binding sites for Pit-1 are located in the superdistal region of the hPRL promoter, 8 in the distal enhancer and 3 in the proximal promoter (2Van de Weerdt C. Peers B. Belayew A. Martial J.A.

DNA. 1989; 8: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Two of the three Pit-1 binding sites (P1 and P2) located in the proximal part of the promoter are sufficient to confer regulation of the humanPRL gene by cAMP and Ca2+-transducing pathways (14Peers B.

Two other important transcription factors, Jun-D and c-Fos interact to form the AP-1 complex, which cooperates with Pit-1 via binding to footprint P1 to synergistically activate both basalhPRL gene transcription and in response to activation of the MAP kinase pathway (15Caccavelli L.

Pitx1 and Pitx2 as well as their isoforms share the same binding specificities and activate the same rat pituitary promoters (38Tremblay J.J. Lanctôt C. Drouin J. Neuroendocrinology. 1999; 71: 277-286Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We recently evidenced that several human pituitary gene promoters and particularly hPRL, were targets for Pitx2 (39Quentien M.H. Pitoia F. Gunz G. Guillet M.P. Enjalbert A. Pellegrini I. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2839-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Here, we concentrated on the 164-bp fragment of the hPRL proximal promoter, previously shown to be sufficient to drive basal activity in somatolactotroph cells and to mediate the responses to almost all second messengers (13Lemaigre F.P.

We show that Pitx factors participate in the basal activity of the hPRL promoter, as well as in its activation by forskolin, TRH, or EGF treatments. Finally, the physiological relevance of these results is reinforced by demonstration that PRL and Pitx2 genes are coexpressed not only in rat but also in human lactotroph cells. The reporter plasmid hPRL-164luc was previously described (15Caccavelli L. Manfroid I. Martial J.A. Muller M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1215-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Human Pitx1 was provided by Dr. D. A. Clayton (Stanford University, CA). Human Pitx2 isoform a and Pit-1 full-length cDNA coding regions were cloned by PCR using normal pituitary tissues and specific oligonucleotide sequences, and subcloned into the CMV-driven eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The mutations of the P1 and P2 binding sites in the hPRL-164luc construct were as described elsewhere (15Caccavelli L. Manfroid I. Martial J.A. Muller M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1215-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mutations of the B1, B2 sites in the hPRL-164luc construct, the R91P and R271W mutations in the pcDNA3hX2 and pcDNA3hPit-1 constructs respectively were generated by PCR using the QuickChange Mutagenesis (Stratagene) and the following commercially synthetized oligonucleotides (Invitrogen), showing the mutations in bold: B1mut, 5′-GAAGATATCAAAGCGGTATAAAGCCAATATCTGGGAAAGAG-3′; B2mut, 5′-GAAATTATGGGGGTACGGTCAATGACGGAAATAGATGACC3′; R91P, 5′-GGT TCA AGA ATC GCC CGG CCA AAT-3′; R271W, 5′-GGCAGAGAGAAAAATGGGTGAAAACAAGTC-3′. Plasmid DNA was purified using the Qiafilter Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen), and all mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing (ABI Prism BigDye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit, Applied Biosystems). GH4C1 somatolactotroph pituitary cells were grown in HamF10 medium supplemented with 15% horse serum and 2.5% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected in serum-free medium using the liposome-based transfection kit Transfast (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were plated at 200,000 cells/well in 12-well plates 24 h prior to transfection and transfected with 1.5 μg of DNA (0.3 μg of reporter plasmid, 0.1–1 μg of effector plasmid(s), and 0.2 μg of CMV-β-galactosidase or 20 ng of pTK-Renilla luciferase as internal controls for transfection efficiency. Cells were incubated with the DNA/liposome complexes for 1 h and then supplemented with 1.5 ml of complete medium. For pharmacological treatments, GH4C1 cells were serum-starved 24 h after transfection for 8 h and further incubated with either 10 μm forskolin, 1 μm TRH, or 100 nm EGF for 18 h in serum-free medium. African green monkey kidney fibroblast-like CV1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. CV1 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method with the MBS mammalian transfection kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were plated at 100,000 cells/well in 6-well plates 24 h prior to transfection. Transfection were carried out using 3 μg of reporter plasmid, 0.1–1 μg of effector plasmid(s), and 0.3 μg of CMV-β-galactosidase as internal control for transfection efficiency. COS-7 cells were grown in DMEM 10% SVF. Transfections were carried out in 100-mm-diameter dishes using the liposome-based transfection kit Polyfect (Qiagen) and 5 μg of Pitx expression vectors. In all transfections, total DNA was kept constant and nonspecific effects of viral promoters were controlled by using the appropriate empty vectors. CV1 and GH4C1 cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed in 200 μl of Reporter or Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). After three sequential freeze-thaw cycles, cell debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C and 20-μl aliquots of the supernatant were used for subsequent luciferase (Luciferase or Dual Luciferase system, Promega) and β-galactosidase assays. For each control, the total luciferase activity normalized against β-galactosidase activity or Renilla luciferase activity was taken as 1, and results were expressed as -fold activation over control. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of three to five independent experiments using different plasmid preparations of each construct. Statistical significance was determined by Wilcoxon non-parametric paired test. Significance was declared atp < 0.05. TnT T7-coupled Reticulocyte Lysate system (Promega) was used for in vitrotranscription/translation. Reactions were carried out in a total volume of 50 μl with reticulocyte lysate, 1 μg of plasmid DNA, 1 mm amino acid mixture, RNasin (Invitrogen, 40 units/μl), T7 RNA polymerase, in the presence, or absence, of [35S]Met (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 10mCi/ml). [35S]Met-radiolabeled translation products were separated by SDS-PAGE and exposed to autoradiographic (ARG) film. Gel shifts were carried out using either the32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide 5′-ACCAGGATGCTAAGCCTGTGTC-3′, containing the CE3 Pitx specific binding site (in bold) of the POMCpromoter (28Lamonerie T. Tremblay J.J. Lanctôt C. Therrien M. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1284-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), or oligonucleotide 5′-GCAAAGGTTTATAAAGCCAATGC-3′ containing the B1 site (in bold), or oligonucleotide 5′-GCATTATGGGGGTAATCTCAATGC-3′) containing the B2 site (in bold). A hundred nanograms of annealed double-stranded DNA was 5′-end-labeled in a standard T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) reaction mixture containing 2 μl of [γ-32P]ATP and purified over a G-25 Sepharose column to remove free nucleotides and salt. Variable amounts of in vitro translated proteins or COS-7 cell nuclear protein extracts (39Quentien M.H. Pitoia F. Gunz G. Guillet M.P. Enjalbert A. Pellegrini I. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2839-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) were incubated on ice for 15 min in a 20-μl reaction of 1× binding buffer (20 mmHEPES, 400 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 20,000 cpm of the radiolabeled probe. Competition reactions were performed with 100 or 200 ng of CE3 itself, native and mutated B1 and B2, and the unrelated SP1-like oligonucleotides. In some cases, 1 μl of Pitx2 polyclonal antibody or preimmune serum was added to the reactions prior to addition of the probe (39Quentien M.H. Pitoia F. Gunz G. Guillet M.P. Enjalbert A. Pellegrini I. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2839-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The bound proteins were separated from the free probe on a 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 0,5% Tris borate/EDTA by PAGE at 180 V for 3 h at 4 °C, before exposure to autoradiographic film. Autoradiographic films were quantified by densitometry and analyzed with the Image computer program (MacIntosh). Pituitaries were obtained from male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 gbw, Le Genest Saint-Isle, France). Human normal pituitary tissues were obtained at the time of therapeutic abortion (20–32 weeks gestation), and tumoral pituitary tissues were obtained by trans-sphenoidal adenomectomies performed on patients who had undergone endocrine preoperative evaluation. 12-μm cryostat sections were either singled-labeled for Pitx2 or doubled-labeled for Pitx2 and PRL, as previously described (40Grino M. Zamora A.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The human or rat Pitx2 probe was a 540- or 720-bp fragment located in the 3′-untranslated region of the human or rat cDNA, respectively, subcloned into pPCR/script and labeled with [35S]UTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using T3 or T7 (human and rat antisense probe, respectively) or T7 or T3 (human and rat sense probe, respectively). The human or rat PRL antisense probe was a 588- or 580-bp fragment of the human or rat cDNA, respectively, subcloned into pPCR/script and labeled with digoxigenin-UTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using T3 or T7 (human and rat probe, respectively). Bright field or fluorescent images were captured with a color CDD video camera (Coolsnap, Princeton Instruments, France) attached to a Leica microscope equipped with a 100 watt mercury-arc lamp and an appropriate filter set. Composites were formed within Adobe Photoshop. Brightness and contrast were altered to generate photographic quality prints. Within the −164-bp part of the hPRL promoter (Fig. 1), footprint experiments have previously defined two protected regions (P1 and P2) containing Pit-1 binding sites (13Lemaigre F.P. Peers B. Lafontaine D.A. Mathy-Hartert M. Rousseau G.G. Belayew A. Martial J.A. DNA. 1989; 8: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, transfection studies identified a third region, named the A sequence, important for both basal and regulated activity of the promoter (18Peers B. Nalda A.M. Monget P. Voz M.L. Belayew A. Martial J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 19Berwaer M. Peers B. Nalda A.M. Monget P. Davis J.R. Belayew A. Martial J.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 92: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the 164-bp region and comparison with the consensus bicoid-related homeoprotein binding site TAATCC (41Wilson D.S. Sheng G. Desplan C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6886-6891Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) identified two putative bicoid binding sites, named B1 and B2 respectively, and localized at positions −27 (TAAACC, reverse orientation) and −110 (TAATCT) (Fig. 1). The ability of the B1 and B2 DNA elements within the hPRLproximal promoter to bind Pitx factors was investigated by gel retardation experiments using B1, B2, or the known bicoid CE3 element of the POMC promoter as probes, and Pitx1 and Pitx2 obtained from in vitro translation reactions. In agreement with other studies (38Tremblay J.J. Lanctôt C. Drouin J. Neuroendocrinology. 1999; 71: 277-286Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar), Pitx1 and Pitx2 were equally efficient at binding the CE3 consensus Pitx site of the POMC promoter (Fig.2 A,left panel), when both factors were present at similar amounts (Fig. 2 A,right panel). No complex was obtained when unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate was used (lane 2). Addition of anti-Pitx2 antiserum prevented the formation of the Pitx2 complex (lane 4), but not that of Pitx1 (lane 7), whereas the preimmune serum had no effect (lane 5). Analysis of the EMSA performed using B1 or B2 as probes was complicated by the presence of several nonspecific bands (Fig. 2 B). Indeed, for both probes, several bands were observed already in the negative controls (−), i.e. when binding was assessed using the products of a translation reaction performed with empty vector (lanes 5and 10). Nevertheless, as shown in Fig. 2 B with Pitx2, when increasing amounts of proteins were used (lanes 6–8 and 11–14), a Pitx2-specific complex that could be discriminated by addition of the anti-Pitx2 antiserum (lanes 8 and 14) was also detected, although superimposed on one of the nonspecific band. This complex ran at a similar position to that obtained with CE3 probe (lane 3).Figure 2DNA binding properties of Pitx factors. A, left panel, EMSA using the consensus CE3 Pitx binding site from the POMC gene as a probe and 5 μl ofin vitro translated Pitx1 or Pitx2. As control, probe alone or a translation reaction in the presence of empty vector was used. The binding of Pitx2 is abolished by addition of the Pitx2 anti-serum (AS), whereas the preimmune serum (PI) has no effect. The AS has no effect on Pitx1 binding.

https://openalex.org/W2094783057,"Minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins are essential components of pre-replication complexes, which limit DNA replication to once per cell cycle. MCM3 acetylating protein, MCM3AP, binds and acetylates MCM3 and inhibits cell cycle progression. In the present study, we examined inhibition of the cell cycle by MCM3AP in a cell-free system. We show here that wild type MCM3AP, but not the acetylase-deficient mutant, inhibits initiation of DNA replication, but not elongation. Both wild type and acetylase-deficient mutant MCM3AP, however, can bind to chromatin through interaction with MCM3. These results indicate that MCM3 acetylase activity of MCM3AP is required to inhibit initiation of DNA replication and that association of MCM3AP to chromatin alone is not sufficient for the inhibition. We also show that interaction between MCM3 and MCM3AP is essential for nuclear localization and chromatin binding of MCM3AP. Furthermore, the chromatin binding of MCM3AP is temporally correlated with that of endogenous MCM3 when cells were released from mitosis. Hence, MCM3AP is a potent natural inhibitor of the initiation of DNA replication whose action is mediated by interaction with MCM3.

In budding yeast, the origin recognition complex (ORC) is bound to the origins of DNA replication throughout the cell cycle (1Rowley A. Cocker J.H. Harwood J. Diffley J.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2631-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 2Liang C. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3375-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 3Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). After termination of mitosis, Cdc6 binds to ORC at replication origins and triggers the binding of a hexameric protein complex of MCM2–7. Recent studies indicate that another protein, Cdt1, is also required for the chromatin binding of the MCM protein complex (4Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. Nurse P. Nature. 2000; 404: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The proteins of the pre-RC, i.e. ORC, Cdc6, and the MCM protein complex, are conserved from yeast to mammalian cells, but metazoan systems have additional mechanisms to control the formation of pre-RCs. An example is geminin, which binds to Cdt1 and inhibits chromatin loading of the MCM protein complex (5Tada S., Li, A. Maiorano D. Mechali M. Blow J.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 6Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C. Dutta A.

MCM3 acetylating protein, MCM3AP, was isolated from a human cDNA library by two-hybrid screening using human MCM3 as bait (7Takei Y. Tsujimoto G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22177-22180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). MCM3AP can bind to and acetylate MCM3 (8Takei Y. Swietlik M. Tanoue A. Tsujimoto G. Kouzarides T. Laskey R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). When MCM3AP is overexpressed, the proportion of cells in S phase decreases and the acetylase activity of MCM3AP is required to establish this inhibition of proliferation (8Takei Y. Swietlik M. Tanoue A. Tsujimoto G. Kouzarides T. Laskey R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). An apparent splice variant of MCM3AP, GANP, has been isolated from mouse and human cDNA libraries (9Kuwahara K. Yoshida M. Kondo E. Sakata A. Watanabe Y. Abe E. Kouno Y. Tomiyasu S. Fujimura S. Tokuhisa T. Kimura H. Ezaki T. Sakaguchi N. Blood. 2000; 95: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Abe E. Kuwahara K. Yoshida M. Suzuki M. Terasaki H. Matsuo Y. Takahashi E.I. Sakaguchi N. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 255: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). GANP is a 210-kDa protein, and the entire sequence of MCM3AP is contained within the C-terminal of GANP (10Abe E. Kuwahara K. Yoshida M. Suzuki M. Terasaki H. Matsuo Y. Takahashi E.I. Sakaguchi N. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 255: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Like MCM3AP, GANP can bind to MCM3, and it does so through the C-terminal domain that is homologous to MCM3AP. However, acetylase activity of GANP has not been established. GANP is expressed during differentiation of a B cell line and its expression is concomitant with an increase of cell cycling time (9Kuwahara K. Yoshida M. Kondo E. Sakata A. Watanabe Y. Abe E. Kouno Y. Tomiyasu S. Fujimura S. Tokuhisa T. Kimura H. Ezaki T. Sakaguchi N. Blood. 2000; 95: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with the inhibitory effects of MCM3AP on cell cycle progression (8Takei Y. Swietlik M. Tanoue A. Tsujimoto G. Kouzarides T. Laskey R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recently Kuwaharaet al. (11Kuwahara K. Tomiyasu S. Fujimura S. Nomura K. Xing Y. Nishiyama N. Ogawa M. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Izuta S. Sakaguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10279-10283Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) reported that the N-terminal fragment of GANP has primase activity, suggesting a possibility that GANP and MCM3AP have different functions. The functional relationship between MCM3AP and GANP remains to be clarified. To determine how MCM3AP decreases the proportion of cells in S phase, we have now reconstituted in vitro the conditions under which MCM3AP can inhibit the cell cycle and asked which aspect of cell proliferation is inhibited. Using the in vitro system, we show that MCM3AP inhibits initiation of DNA replication, but not elongation. We also show here that binding to MCM3 is important for nuclear entry and chromatin binding of MCM3AP. Taken together, our results show that MCM3AP is a natural inhibitor of cell proliferation which targets the inhibition of DNA replication via interaction with MCM3. HeLa cells and 293T cells were cultured as monolayers in 10% fetal calf serum in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium. For examination of GFP-MCM3AP localization and in vivo DNA replication, 293T cells were grown on coverslips in 24-well plates. To analyze chromatin binding of endogenous MCM3AP and MCM3, cells were synchronized in mitosis by treatment with 2.5 mm thymidine for 25 h and then released into culture medium containing 0.04 μg/ml nocodazole for 12 h. Mitotic cells were shaken off plates, washed, and plated again. At specific time points after release from mitosis, cells were harvested and washed once with PBS and twice with hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.3, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors). Cells were resuspended in hypotonic buffer supplemented with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and incubated on ice for 15 min, followed by a 15-min centrifugation at 3000 rpm at 4 °C. The pellets were washed twice with hypotonic buffer and then resuspended in hypotonic buffer supplemented with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 500 mm NaCl. After incubation on ice for 15 min, samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C. Supernatants were frozen as chromatin-bound protein fractions. To isolate late G1 phase nuclei for in vitro DNA replication, HeLa cells were incubated with 0.5 mm mimosine in growth medium for 20 h. To isolate S phase nuclei, HeLa cells were incubated with 2.5 mm thymidine in growth medium. After incubation for 24 h, cells were washed and cultured for 24 h in growth medium followed by another thymidine incubation for 24 h. Then cells were harvested after 3-h culture. The nuclei were isolated from late G1 phase cells or S phase cells as described (12Krude T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13699-13707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Preparation of wild type and acetylase-deficient MCM3AP/pEGFP C2, MCM3/pGBT9, MCM3/pcDNA 3.1 His, and wild type MCM3AP/pGAD424 were described previously (7Takei Y. Tsujimoto G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22177-22180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 8Takei Y. Swietlik M. Tanoue A. Tsujimoto G. Kouzarides T. Laskey R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To generate an MCM3-binding-deficient mutant of MCM3AP we used a QuikChangeTM site directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the DNA sequence of the protein-coding region was confirmed by sequencing. The full-length cDNA of MCM2 was harbored in pcDNA3.1/His (Invitrogen) to express His6-tagged MCM2 in mammalian cells. For transfection of 293T cells, we used LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). After transfection, cells were incubated for 21 h and then washed and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, then blocked by antibody buffer (2% bovine serum albumin, 0.04% SDS, 0.02% Triton X-100) for 30 min at 37 °C. His6-tagged proteins were detected with anti-polyhistidine antibody (Sigma) and visualized with Texas Red-labeled secondary antibody. Microscopy images were obtained using a Bio-Rad confocal microscopy system. For in vivo DNA replication assays, we employed bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) labeling (8Takei Y. Swietlik M. Tanoue A. Tsujimoto G. Kouzarides T. Laskey R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Twenty hours after transfection, cells were labeled with 50 μm BrdUrd for 1.5 h, then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and denatured in 50 mm NaOH for 5 min. Incorporated BrdUrd was probed with anti-BrdUrd antibody (AmershamBiosciences) and visualized by Texas Red-labeled secondary antibody. The GFP-positive and BrdUrd-positive cells were counted to estimate the proportion of DNA-replicating cells. For in vitro DNA replication assays, mimosine-treated HeLa nuclei were prepared as described previously (12Krude T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13699-13707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The soluble protein fractions were prepared from asynchronous wild type or mutant MCM3AP-transfected 293T cells or from vector-transfected 293T cells. Twenty hours after the transfection, cells were washed with PBS and incubated in hypotonic buffer for 10 min at 4 °C. The cells were then homogenized in hypotonic buffer and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant obtained by the centrifugation was stored at −80 °C as the soluble protein fraction. The precipitates were extracted with phenol/chloroform, chloroform, and ether, sequentially, to obtain chromatin DNA. After ethanol precipitation, chromatin DNA was resuspended in TE buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA), and the concentration of DNA was calculated from the absorbance at 260 nm. Mimosine-treated HeLa nuclei and the soluble protein fractions were incubated as described (12Krude T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13699-13707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: 1) acetyl-CoA was added in the reaction mixture at a final concentration to 5 μm. 2) Digoxygenin-labeled dUTP was used instead of biotin-labeled dUTP. 3) After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C reaction mixtures were diluted by PBS, and an equal volume of 8% paraformaldehyde in PBS was added to fix nuclei. 4) The nuclei were spun down on poly-Lys-coated coverslips and incubated with Texas Red-labeled anti-digoxygenin antibody to detect incorporated digoxygenin-labeled dUTP and with TOTO3 (Molecular Probes) to stain the nuclei. To clarify the mechanism of MCM3AP- induced cell cycle inhibition, we analyzed DNA replication in vitro using nuclei prepared from HeLa cells arrested in late G1 phase with mimosine (13Krude T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 148-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Consistent with the report by Krude et al. (12Krude T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13699-13707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), in vitro initiation of DNA replication was observed in nuclei from mimosine-treated cells, incubated with a soluble protein fraction, whereas only elongation of existing forks occurred without the fraction. The soluble protein fractions were also prepared from transfected 293T cells, and their abilities to support DNA replication were assessed. When mimosine-arrested nuclei were incubated in protein extracts prepared from vector-transfected cells, DNA was replicated in more than 30% of nuclei, as opposed to less than 10% of nuclei replicating in the absence of the soluble protein fraction. When the soluble protein fraction containing wild type GFP-MCM3AP was used for in vitro DNA replication, no significant increase of replicating nuclei above the background was observed (Fig.1 A). However the protein fractions containing the acetylase-deficient mutant of MCM3AP, in which His471, Gly472, and Gly474 were substituted with alanines, failed to inhibit DNA replication in the cell free system (Fig. 1 A). In our previous transfection experiments (8Takei Y. Swietlik M. Tanoue A. Tsujimoto G. Kouzarides T. Laskey R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), this mutant failed to lower the proportion of whole cells in the S phase. This extends the results of whole cell transfection experiments (8Takei Y. Swietlik M. Tanoue A. Tsujimoto G. Kouzarides T. Laskey R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which showed a decreased proportion of cells in S phase after transfection with MCM3AP, but it does not show whether the effect is on the regulatory step of initiation of DNA replication or only elongation. To assess the effect of MCM3AP on elongation of DNA synthesis, we used S phase nuclei instead of late G1 phase nuclei. Unlike initiation, elongation of DNA replication in S phase nuclei occurs in the absence of the soluble protein fraction as long as nucleoside triphosphates and deoxynucleoside triphosphates are presents (“without soluble fraction” in Fig. 1 B and Ref. 12Krude T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13699-13707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast to mimosine-arrested nuclei, wild type MCM3AP-GFP did not have any effect on DNA replication in S phase nuclei (Fig. 1 B), indicating that it can only block the initiation step in DNA replication. The expression levels of MCM3APs were examined by Western blotting as indicated in Fig. 1 C. When soluble protein fractions were analyzed from similar numbers of transfected cells, the same amount of MCM3 was found in each fraction, and similar amounts of wild type or mutant GFP-MCM3APs were expressed in the transfectants. These results indicate that MCM3AP inhibits initiation, but not elongation of DNA replication, and that acetylase activity of MCM3AP is required for this inhibition. Fig.2 A shows that both wild type and acetylase-deficient GFP-MCM3AP bind to nuclei under the same conditions as those used for the in vitro DNA replication assay in Fig. 1 (except without added digoxygenin dUTP). Nuclear membranes were not required for binding of MCM3AP to nuclei, as it was still observed in the presence of detergent (Fig. 2 A). GFP-MCM3AP could be released from nuclei by DNase I treatment (Fig.2 B), indicating that it was bound to chromatin. To clarify the manner of MCM3AP binding on chromatin, soluble proteins were washed out after the in vitro binding of GFP-MCM3AP. GFP-MCM3AP was then released from the chromatin with DNase I and immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 C, MCM3 was co-precipitated with GFP-MCM3AP, demonstrating that MCM3AP can bind to chromatin-bound MCM3. These results suggest that MCM3AP can associate with chromatin through MCM3. To assess whether the chromatin binding of MCM3AP is correlated with that of MCM3 in vivo, we examined the behavior of endogenous proteins on chromatin during and after release from mitosis. Consistent with the results described above, binding of endogenous MCM3 and MCM3AP to chromatin occurred over the same time course. As expected from reports in the literature (2Liang C. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3375-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 3Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 14Krude T. Musahl C. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 309-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,15Young M.R. Tye B.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1587-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the amount of chromatin-bound MCM3 is increased after release from mitosis and reaches its peak at 7 h after release, decreasing thereafter (Fig. 2 D). The chromatin-bound MCM3AP also increased after release from mitosis in parallel to the increase of chromatin-bound MCM3, (Fig. 2 D). These results suggest that interaction with MCM3 correlates with chromatin binding of MCM3APin vivo as well as in vitro. The acetylase activity of MCM3AP is not required for chromatin binding as the acetylase-deficient mutant binds to chromatin equally well. Next, we examined the cellular localization of GFP-MCM3AP when overexpressed under the conditions that inhibit cell cycle progression (8Takei Y. Swietlik M. Tanoue A. Tsujimoto G. Kouzarides T. Laskey R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The localizations of overexpressed wild type and the acetylase-deficient mutant of MCM3AP are mainly cytoplasmic (Fig. 3 A). However, when cells were treated with leptomycin B, an inhibitor of CRM1-dependent nuclear export, both the wild type and the acetylase-deficient mutant of MCM3AP were localized in the nucleus (Fig. 3 A). These results indicate that overexpressed exogenous MCM3AP can be actively exported from the nucleus, while the smaller amounts of endogenous MCM3AP remain localized in nuclei (8Takei Y. Swietlik M. Tanoue A. Tsujimoto G. Kouzarides T. Laskey R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As MCM3AP can bind to MCM3, which is a constitutively nuclear protein, the effect of MCM3 on the localization of MCM3AP was examined. Fig.3 B shows that overexpression of MCM3 causes overexpressed MCM3AP to accumulate in the nucleus, instead of in the cytoplasm. Co-expression of GFP-MCM3AP with MCM2, another MCM protein that appears to contain an NLS, did not have any effects on GFP-MCM3AP localization (Fig. 3 B). Thus, MCM3AP is a protein that can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm and can accumulate in the nucleus in an MCM3-dependent manner. Two different effects of MCM3 binding could explain the results in Fig.3. One is that MCM3 binding is required for nuclear import of MCM3AP; the other is that nuclear import of MCM3AP is independent of MCM3, while nuclear binding and retention of MCM3AP depends on MCM3. To distinguish between these two alternatives, we used a mutant MCM3AP that could not bind to MCM3. Leu237, Val240, Val241, and Leu242 were substituted with alanines (Fig. 4 A). Although we were initially seeking a different phenotype, we found that this mutant MCM3AP could not interact with MCM3 in yeast, whereas wild type MCM3AP could (Fig. 4 A). Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 4 A, the MCM3-binding-deficient mutant also failed to bind to chromatin under conditions where wild type MCM3AP bound (Fig.4 B), and co-expression of MCM3 had no effect on the cytoplasmic localization of the mutant (Fig. 4 C) unlike its effect on wild type MCM3AP (Fig. 3 B). These results indicate that the binding-deficient mutant MCM3AP cannot associate with MCM3 in either mammalian cells or yeast. Fig. 4 D shows that even when export was blocked with leptomycin B, the mutant MCM3AP that fails to bind to MCM3 still failed to accumulate in the nucleus. These results indicate that MCM3 binding is required for both nuclear import and chromatin binding of MCM3AP. The MCM3-binding-deficient mutant was examined in DNA replication assays in vivo and in vitro. Overexpression of the MCM3-binding mutant of MCM3AP did not show any significant effects on incorporation of BrdUrd, whereas overexpression of wild type MCM3AP inhibits it (Fig. 4 E, left). In vitro DNA replication assays were performed with mimosine-arrested G1nuclei and soluble protein fractions containing either the MCM3-binding-deficient mutant of MCM3AP or wild type MCM3AP. The soluble protein fraction from cells expressing the MCM3-binding-deficient mutant MCM3AP supports in vitro DNA replication as efficiently as the soluble protein fraction obtained from vector transfected cells, whereas the soluble protein fraction containing wild type MCM3AP does not (Fig. 4 E,right). These results indicate that neither the MCM3-binding mutant of MCM3AP nor the acetylase-deficient mutant of MCM3AP inhibit DNA replication in the way that wild type MCM3AP inhibits. We have shown previously (8Takei Y. Swietlik M. Tanoue A. Tsujimoto G. Kouzarides T. Laskey R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) that MCM3AP is an acetylase that specifically acetylates MCM3 and that exogenous expression of MCM3AP decreases the number of cells in S phase. We have also shown that a mutation that blocks acetyltransferase function abolishes the effects on the cell cycle (8Takei Y. Swietlik M. Tanoue A. Tsujimoto G. Kouzarides T. Laskey R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Here we show that the decreased proportion of cells in the S phase is directly due to inhibition of the initiation of DNA replication and not just due to arrest at another point in the cycle. Thus, cytosolic extract from cells expressing wild type MCM3AP inhibits DNA replication of late G1 nuclei in vitro, whereas the mutant that lacks acetylase activity does not inhibit DNA replication. The inhibition is specific for initiation, but not elongation of DNA replication. Thus, the ability of S phase nuclei to continue elongation of DNA synthesis is not inhibited by extracts containing MCM3AP, whereas initiation in late G1 nuclei is inhibited. In addition to demonstrating an effect on the initiation of DNA replication by MCM3AP, the present study also demonstrates that the accumulation of MCM3AP in the nucleus is dependent upon interaction with MCM3. We showed that MCM3 is required for two phases of accumulation on chromatin. First, interaction is required for entry into the nucleus, and second, interaction with MCM3 is required for MCM3AP to bind to chromatin. MCM3 is a constitutive nuclear protein even when the protein is overexpressed, and it is known to contain a nuclear localization signal (7Takei Y. Tsujimoto G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22177-22180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 16Young M.R. Suzuki K. Yan H. Gibson S. Tye B.K. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). There is a precedent for MCM3 determining the nuclear localization of another protein that is bound to it. When mouse MCM5 is overexpressed, its localization is mainly cytoplasmic, but co-expression of exogenous MCM3 redirects the overexpressed MCM5 to the nucleus (17Kimura H. Ohtomo T. Yamaguchi M. Ishii A. Sugimoto K. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 977-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), in a similar manner to that shown for MCM3AP in the present paper. It is important to note that although overexpressed MCM3AP requires overexpressed MCM3 to localize it to the nucleus, the much smaller amounts of endogenous MCM3AP are likely to be constitutively localized to the nucleus by interaction with endogenous MCM3 in normal cells. MCM proteins are known to be essential for initiation of DNA replication throughout eukaryotes (see Ref. 18Tye B.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 649-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar for review), so they are attractive potential targets for a regulatory enzyme that can inhibit DNA replication. Our data show that the acetylase activity of MCM3AP inhibits initiation of DNA replication, but not its elongation. An important future question is the mechanism of this inhibition. Although we have shown that the intrinsic acetylase activity of MCM3AP is essential for the inhibition of DNA synthesis by MCM3AP and we have shown previously that MCM3 is acetylated in vivo, we have not yet shown the mechanism by which acetylation by MCM3AP induces the inhibition. DNA helicase activity has been reported for MCM complexes (19Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 20Kelman Z. Lee J.K.

A. 2000; 97: 1530-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and it will be interesting to determine any effect of MCM3AP-dependent MCM3 acetylation on helicase activity or on MCM loading on to the DNA template. In conclusion, we have established that MCM3AP directly inhibits initiation of DNA replication. We have also shown that interaction with MCM3 is essential for entry into the nucleus and for binding to chromatin by MCM3AP. The acetylase activity of MCM3AP seems not to be required for these localization steps but required for the inhibition of DNA replication. Thus, MCM3AP is a potent natural inhibitor of the initiation of DNA replication whose action is mediated by interaction with MCM3.

The structural features of this family include large N- and C-terminal domains that flank a central tyrosine kinase domain (1Schaller M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1540: 1-21Google Scholar). The sequences of FAK and CAKβ are 45% identical and 65% similar. The greatest homology exists between the catalytic domains (60% identity) and the extreme C termini, which corresponds to the region of FAK that directs subcellular localization (62% identity) (2Schaller M.D. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 150: 1-7Google Scholar). Regions within the N termini of both kinases have homology with the band 4.1/ERM family of proteins within a region known as the FERM domain (3Girault J.A. Labesse G. Mornon J.P. Callebaut I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 54-57Google Scholar). In addition, FAK and CAKβ share conserved phosphorylated tyrosines and C-terminal proline-rich regions that mediate interactions with SH2- and SH3-containing proteins (4Avraham H. Park S.Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Google Scholar). FAK is expressed in nearly all tissues and cell types, and in a wide variety of adherent cells FAK is discretely localized to focal adhesions (5Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Google Scholar, 6Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 705-710Google Scholar). In contrast, CAKβ expression is restricted mainly to the brain and hematopoetic cells, and its subcellular localization is cell type-specific (4Avraham H. Park S.Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Google Scholar). In some cells, CAKβ is localized to focal adhesions or focal adhesion-like structures (7Schaller M.D. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25319-25325Google Scholar, 8Li J. Avraham H. Rogers R.A. Raja S. Avraham S. Blood. 1996; 88: 417-428Google Scholar). CAKβ has also been localized to specialized actin-containing structures such as the podosomes of macrophages, the sealing zone of osteoclasts, and along stress fibers in smooth muscle cells (9Duong L.T. Rodan G.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 47: 174-188Google Scholar, 10Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Nagy R.M. Parsons J.T. Rodan G.A. Duong L.T. J. Biol.

It is also targeted to membrane ruffles and lamellipodia in some spreading and motile cells (12Williams L.M. Ridley A.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2028-2036Google Scholar, 13Watson J.M. Harding T.W.

Alternatively, CAKβ staining has been described as diffuse, perinuclear, or colocalized with the Golgi (7Schaller M.D. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25319-25325Google Scholar, 14Zheng C.

Sabatini D.D. Kam J. Plowman G. Randazzo P.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2338-2350Google Scholar). The differential subcellular localization of FAK and CAKβ may underscore important differences in biological function. Focal adhesion targeting of FAK is mediated by conserved sequences within the C terminus, designated the Focal Adhesion Targeting (FAT) sequence (18Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 993-1005Google Scholar), which shares extensive homology with the C terminus of CAKβ. The C-terminal non-catalytic domain of CAKβ localizes discretely to focal adhesions when autonomously expressed (7Schaller M.D. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25319-25325Google Scholar, 19Xiong W.C. Macklem M. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1981-1991Google Scholar). Since full-length CAKβ exhibits focal adhesion localization in only a subset of cells, a functional FAT sequence in the C terminus of CAKβ appears to be masked in some cell types. This suggests that focal adhesion localization may be regulated on multiple levels. FAK is primarily activated through integrin-mediated cell adhesion to an insoluble extracellular matrix. To a lesser extent, FAK is activated by growth factors, neuropeptides, and bioactive lipids (20Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Google Scholar). Conversely, activation of CAKβ occurs largely in response to soluble extracellular factors, including signals that act through G-protein-coupled receptors, cytokines, antigen receptors, and stress signals (4Avraham H. Park S.Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Google Scholar). CAKβ is maximally activated in response to integrin-mediated cell adhesion in only a subset of cells including hematopoetic cells (8Li J. Avraham H. Rogers R.A. Raja S. Avraham S. Blood. 1996; 88: 417-428Google Scholar, 21Astier A. Manie S.N. Avraham H. Hirai H. Law S.F. Zhang Y. Golemis E.A. Fu Y. Druker B.J. Haghayeghi N. Freedman A.S. Avraham S. J. Biol.

However, in many other cells, adhesion induces a slight increase in tyrosine phosphorylation (7Schaller M.D. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25319-25325Google Scholar, 14Zheng C. Xing Z.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21206-21219Google Scholar). Many of the stimuli that activate CAKβ also elevate intracellular calcium levels, and in fact, CAKβ activation is dependent upon the presence of calcium (24Huckle W.R. Dy R.C. Earp H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8837-8841Google Scholar, 25Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29993-29998Google Scholar). Interestingly, a chimeric protein consisting of the N terminus and catalytic domain of CAKβ fused to the C terminus of FAK was driven to focal adhesions and was strongly regulated by adhesion to fibronectin (14Zheng C. Xing Z. Bian Z.C. Guo C. Akbay A. Warner L. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2384-2389Google Scholar). The positive correlation between focal adhesion localization and activation by integrin-mediated adhesion has been reported in the literature and highlights a potential mechanism for differential regulation of FAK and CAKβ activity (27Shen Y. Schaller M.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2507-2518Google Scholar, 28Cooley M.A. Broome J.M. Ohngemach C. Romer L.H. Schaller M.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3247-3263Google Scholar). Although the signals that lie upstream of FAK family kinases may differ, many of the immediate consequences of activation are conserved. These include recruitment of SH2 domain containing signaling molecules such as Src and Grb2 into complex with the kinase, and tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoskeleton-associated adaptor proteins, such as paxillin and p130cas (1Schaller M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1540: 1-21Google Scholar). Signaling via FAK and CAKβ is also involved in the activation of MAP kinase family members (4Avraham H. Park S.Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Google Scholar, 20Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Google Scholar). These data suggest that differential regulation of common signaling events downstream of FAK and CAKβ are important for biological function. Since FAK and CAKβ trigger tyrosine phosphorylation of some common substrates, it may be predicted that the biological outcomes of FAK/CAKβ signaling would be similar as well. In fact, both kinases have been implicated in the processes of cell spreading, focal adhesion turnover, and migration (1Schaller M.D. Biochim. Biophys.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 181-195Google Scholar). Despite this commonality, FAK and CAKβ clearly have divergent functions as well. The two kinases have opposing effects on cell cycle progression, whereas FAK accelerates progression into S phase, CAKβ delays this transition (31Zhao J.H. Reiske H. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1997-2008Google Scholar, 32Zhao J. Zheng C. Guan J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3063-3072Google Scholar). In addition, FAK has been implicated in adhesion-dependent cell survival (33Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Google Scholar, 34Hungerford J.E. Compton M.T. Matter M.L. Hoffstrom B.G. Otey C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1383-1390Google Scholar), while CAKβ has been implicated in cell death pathways (35Xiong W. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 529-539Google Scholar, 36Chauhan D. Pandey P. Hideshima T. Treon S. Raje N. Davies F.E. Shima Y. Tai Y.T. Rosen S. Avraham S. Kharbanda S. Anderson K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27845-27850Google Scholar). In neurons, the integration of FAK and CAKβ-mediated signals may promote neurite outgrowth and differentiation, and CAKβ may play a unique role in maintenance of plasticity through modulation of ion channels (25Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Google Scholar, 37Ivankovic-Dikic I. Gronroos E. Blaukat A. Barth B.U. Dikic I.

These results suggest that FAK and CAKβ may have both common and distinct functions. Although FAK and CAKβ are highly homologous, bind to a common subset of proteins, and are capable of initiating a subset of common signaling pathways, they clearly have unique and perhaps complementary roles in the cell. Subtle differences in mode of activation, regulation, subcellular localization, catalytic activity, substrate preference, and/or scaffolding activity appear to be critical determinants of differential signaling. In order to define the molecular basis of these subtle yet critical differences, we have constructed, expressed, and characterized a complete set of six chimeric FAK/CAKβ proteins in chick embryo cells. CAKβ exhibited higher catalytic activity than FAK in an in vitro kinase assay. Furthermore, chimeric kinases revealed that coupling of the FAK N terminus and CAKβ catalytic domain yielded a highly active kinase, suggesting that the N terminus of FAK family kinases may be involved in regulation of catalytic activity. Substrate phosphorylation by chimeric kinases in vivo correlated perfectly with catalytic activity in vitro, providing a molecular basis for differential substrate phosphorylation by FAK and CAKβ in vivo. This analysis revealed a potential role for the N terminus in modulating subcellular localization, since chimeras with the FAK N terminus and CAKβ C terminus targeted to focal adhesions, whereas chimeras with both the N- and C termini of CAKβ did not. The CAKβ N terminus also mediated striking changes in cell morphology that were independent of changes RhoA activity. Although it was not strictly required, targeting to focal adhesions enhanced the ability of this domain to alter morphology. Chick embryo (CE) cells were isolated from 9-day-old embryos and maintained as described previously (39Reynolds A.B. Roesel D.J. Kanner S.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 629-638Google Scholar). For expression of exogenous proteins in CE cells, constructs were subcloned into a replication competent avian retroviral vector, RCAS A (40Hughes H.S. Greenhouse J.J. Petropoulos C.J. Sutrave P. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3004-3012Google Scholar). RCAS A constructs were transfected into CE cells using the calcium phosphate method as described (39Reynolds A.B. Roesel D.J. Kanner S.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 629-638Google Scholar) or LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Expression of RCAS A-encoded exogenous proteins was evaluated 7–9 days post-transfection. For co-expression with c-Src, cells expressing wild type or chimeric FAK family kinases were infected with RCAS B c-Src virus on day 5 post-transfection and lysed on day 10 post-transfection as described previously (41Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3489-3505Google Scholar). pCMV-Myc RhoA Q63L and pCMV-Myc RhoA T19N plasmids, which were the generous gifts of Dr. Krister Wennerberg, were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus and analyzed 3 days post-transfection. Cell cultures were viewed using a Nikon TMS inverted microscope and imaged using a Nikon CoolPix 950 digital camera (×100 magnification). The DNA sequence corresponding to the FAK N terminus (amino acids 1–332), catalytic domain (332–690), and C terminus (690–1038), and the CAKβ N terminus (1–336), catalytic domain (336–693), and C terminus (693–1009) were amplified using PCR. At the junctions of these domains, restriction sites were created. The N termini of FAK and CAKβ were amplified with N- and C-terminal BamH1 sites. The catalytic domains were flanked by an N-terminal BamH1 site and C-terminalEcoR1 site. The C-terminal fragments were flanked by an N-terminal EcoR1 site and C-terminal SalI site. pBluescript KS+/FAK and pBluescript SK−/CAKβ (7Schaller M.D. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25319-25325Google Scholar, 42Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Google Scholar) were used as templates, and VENT polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was used for PCR. Both template constructs had a C-terminal KT3 epitope tag, and therefore all resultant chimeric molecules were also C-terminal tagged. Fragments were ligated to generate sequences that encoded eight chimeric proteins, each maintaining the three-domain structure. The clones were named using a three-letter system corresponding to the three domains in the chimeric protein. The FFF and CCC clones were reconstituted FAK and CAKβ molecules that contained the restriction sites that were engineered using PCR. Chimeric constructs were subcloned into RCAS A for expression in CE cells. All amplified fragments were sequenced at the UNC-CH Automated DNA Sequencing Facility on a model 377 DNA Sequencer (PerkinElmer, Applied Biosystems Division) using the ABI PRISMTM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit with AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase, FS (PerkinElmer). Two unintended substitutions in FAK led to amino acid changes: amino acid substitutions R724W and A872G. These mutations, as well as the mutations engineered to create restriction sites, were inconsequential in our analysis since the FFF and CCC chimeras behaved like wild type FAK and CAKβ, respectively. The following antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and/or indirect immunofluorescence. The KT3 monoclonal antibody (43MacArthur H. Walter G. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 483-491Google Scholar), which recognizes the C-terminal KT3 epitope tag on FAK, CAKβ, and chimeric proteins, was the kind gift from Dr. J. T. Parsons (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA). A commercially available KT3 antibody was used for indirect immunofluorescence (Covance, Princeton, NJ). Monoclonal antibody RC20 (Transduction Labortatories, San Diego, CA) and polyclonal phosphospecific antibodies anti-PYK2 (pY402) and anti-PYK2 (pY579/580) (BIOSOURCE International,Camarillo, CA) were used to detect phosphotyrosine. Monoclonal antibody anti-RhoA was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-Src monoclonal antibody EC10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (clone 9E10) was purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal antibody 8605, which recognizes paxillin, was previously described (44Thomas J.W. Cooley M.A. Broome J.M. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Lombardo C.R. Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36684-36692Google Scholar). Rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse and fluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibodies were used for indirect immunofluorescence (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). The AlexaFluor 488-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used for analysis of cell cycle progression. Confluent monolayers of cells were lysed in ice-cold Triton X-100/radioimmune precipitation assay buffer as described (44Thomas J.W. Cooley M.A. Broome J.M. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Lombardo C.R. Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36684-36692Google Scholar). Lysates were clarified, and protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce). For immunoprecipitations, the paxillin antibody (2 ug), the KT3 antibody (6 ug), or the EC10 antibody (7 ug) were incubated with 0.2–0.8 mg of cell lysate at 4 °C for 1 h. Immune complexes were precipitated at 4 °C for 1 h with protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma), anti-mouse IgG-agarose beads (Sigma), or protein A-Sepharose beads coated with AffiniPure rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs). Immune complexes were washed twice with ice-cold lysis buffer, and once with ice-cold PBS. Beads were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and boiled to elute the proteins (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), and the samples were analyzed by Western blotting. Kinases were overexpressed in CE cells and immunoprecipitated as described above with minor modifications. To compensate for differences in expression level and to promote recovery of comparable amounts of each kinase, some chimeric proteins were immunoprecipitated from more lysate. Specifically, FAK, CAKβ, FFF, FFC, FCF, FCC, and CCC were immunoprecipitated from 0.4 mg of lysate, whereas mock, CCF, CFC, and CFF were immunoprecipitated from 0.8 mg of lysate. Immune complexes were washed two times with ice-cold lysis buffer, once with ice-cold PBS, and once with kinase reaction buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 7.2, 3 mmMnCl2). Each reaction was resuspended in 20 μl of kinase reaction buffer supplemented with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reactions were incubated at room temperature with periodic mixing for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 20 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and boiled to elute the protein. Samples were resolved on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dehydrated and exposed to film to reveal phosphorylated species. Glass coverslips were coated with 50 μg/ml bovine plasma fibronectin (Sigma) in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were plated onto the coated coverslips and maintained at 37 °C for 16 h. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in Universal Buffer (UB; 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl) for 8 min, washed twice in UB, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in UB for 5 min, and washed twice more in UB. Coverslips were incubated with primary antibody (KT3, 1:1000; 8605, 1:800) diluted in UB for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber, washed twice, and incubated with secondary antibody (anti-mouse rhodamine and anti-rabbit fluorescein, 1:1000) diluted in UB for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. Coverslips were washed twice in UB and once with distilled water, and mounted on slides for visualization using a Leitz Orthoplan fluorescence microscope. Images were captured using a Hamamatsu digital camera and Metamorph imaging software (Universal Imaging Corporation, West Chester, PA). The level of RhoA activity in CE cells was assessed as previously described (46Arthur W.T. Burridge K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2711-2720Google Scholar). Briefly, lysates made from confluent mock-transfected and CCF-expressing cells were incubated with a GST-Rhotekin RBD fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). Complexes were washed and Western blotted with anti-RhoA and anti-Myc antibodies to reveal the amount of precipitated RhoA. As controls, CE cells were transfected with Myc-tagged RhoA Q63L (constitutively active) or RhoA T19N (dominant negative) and analyzed in parallel. In order to assess apoptosis, the Apoptag Plus Fluorescein in situ apoptosis detection kit was used as recommended by the manufacturer (Intergen Company, Purchase, NY). Briefly, CE cells expressing wild type and chimeric kinases were plated on fibronectin-coated coverslips as described above and grown to confluence over 2 days. As a positive control for apoptosis, mock-transfected cells were treated with 1 μmstaurosporine (Sigma) for at least 4 h. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized in ethanol/acetic acid (2:1) at −20 °C. Coverslips were then incubated with a fluorescein-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody, and 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindone dihydrochloride (DAPI, 1 μg/ml, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to counterstain the nuclei. Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides and visualized as described for immunofluorescence experiments. In each experiment, 200 cells were counted, and the percentage of apoptotic cells was determined. Differences in the rate at which starved CE cells expressing wild type and chimeric constructs entered S-phase following serum stimulation was assessed. Briefly, cells were plated onto fibronectin-coated coverslips at low density (∼25% confluence) and incubated overnight in complete media. Cells were then starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) +0.2% chick serum (Invitrogen) for 48 h. After rinsing twice with DMEM, complete CE media (DMEM+5% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 1% chick serum) supplemented with 100 μm BrdUrd (5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine, Sigma) was added back to the cells. As a control, one coverslip was incubated in serum-free media supplemented with BrdUrd to verify that serum starvation had arrested the cell cycle. After 16 h, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. Coverslips were blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h and subsequently treated with 0.1 unit/μl DNase (Promega, Madison, WI) for 30 min at 37 °C. Slips were incubated serially with anti-BrdUrd antibody (1:20), KT3 (1:500), and finally, a mixture of rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:500) and DAPI (1 μg/ml) for 1 h each at 37 °C, with washing following each antibody step. Coverslips were then rinsed in water, mounted onto glass slides, and visualized as described for indirect immunofluorescence. In each experiment, 200 cells were counted, and the percentage of cells that had entered S phase was determined. In order to determine the molecular basis of the functional differences between FAK and CAKβ, a set of chimeric FAK/CAKβ molecules was constructed (Fig.1). The three major domains of FAK and CAKβ were individually amplified by PCR. Restriction sites were created at the N and C termini of each domain to allow for assembly of the domains into chimeric molecules (Fig. 1, upper panel). The central domains, which are referred to as the catalytic domains in this manuscript, include both the catalytic domains and the binding sites for the Src SH2 and SH3 domains (8Li J. Avraham H. Rogers R.A. Raja S. Avraham S. Blood. 1996; 88: 417-428Google Scholar, 47Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Google Scholar, 48Thomas J.W. Ellis B.

Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Google Scholar). A KT3 epitope tag was engineered at the C terminus of each construct. Domains were assembled to generate a full set of chimeric proteins that retain the overall size and structure of the kinase. Chimeric proteins were named using a three-letter system (Fig. 1, lower panel) corresponding to the three domains, where an F represents a FAK domain and a C represents a CAKβ domain. Creation of restriction sites resulted in amino acid substitutions at the joints of the chimeric proteins. To control for the presence of these substitutions, two constructs, FFF and CCC, were built. These correspond to wild type FAK and CAKβ except that they contain the engineered restriction sites at the domain joints. The chimeric constructs were subcloned into RCAS A, a replication-competent avian retroviral vector, for expression in chick embryo (CE) cells. In order to verify the domain structure of chimeric proteins, a panel of antibodies that recognized specific domains of FAK and CAKβ was used to probe Western blots of chimera-expressing CE cell lysates. 2J. Dunty and M. Schaller, unpublished observations. The results confirmed the predicted domain structure of chimeric FAK/CAKβ proteins. CAKβ expression in CE cells results in greater substrate phosphorylation than expression of FAK (7Schaller M.D. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25319-25325Google Scholar). To explore whether differences in intrinsic catalytic activity could explain this result, the catalytic activity of FAK, CAKβ, and FAK/CAKβ chimeric kinases was assessed in an in vitro immune complex kinase assay. From lysates made from confluent mock-transfected CE cells and cells expressing FAK, CAKβ, and the chimeric proteins, kinases were immunoprecipitated using the KT3 epitope tag antibody. One-half of each immune complex was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in kinase reaction buffer for 10 min and separated by SDS-PAGE. Incorporation of32P into the kinases was detected by autoradiography (Fig.2, upper panel). The other half o"

We have shown that the brain-specific β4 subunit modulates the voltage dependence, activation kinetics, and toxin sensitivity of the hSlo channel (Weiger, T. M., Holmqvist, M. H., Levitan, I. B., Clark, F. T., Sprague, S., Huang, W. J., Ge, P., Wang, C., Lawson, D., Jurman, M. E., Glucksmann, M. A., Silos-Santiago, I., DiStefano, P. S., and Curtis, R. (2000) J. Neurosci. 20, 3563–3570). We investigated here the N-linked glycosylation of the β4 subunit and its effect on the modulation of the hSlo α subunit. When expressed alone in HEK293 cells, the β4 subunit runs as a single molecular weight band on an SDS gel. However, when coexpressed with the hSlo α subunit, the β4 subunit appears as two different molecular weight bands. Enzymatic deglycosylation or mutation of theN-linked glycosylation residues in β4 converts it to a single lower molecular weight band, even in the presence of the hSlo α subunit, suggesting that the β4 subunit can be present as an immature, core glycosylated form and a mature, highly glycosylated form. Blockage of protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi compartment with brefeldin A abolishes the mature, highly glycosylated β4 band. Glycosylation of the β4 subunit is not required for its binding to the hSlo channel α subunit. It also is not necessary for cell membrane targeting of the β4 subunit, as demonstrated by surface biotinylation experiments. However, the double glycosylation site mutant β4 (β4 N53A/N90A) protects the channel less against toxin blockade, as compared with the hSlo channel coexpressed with wild type β4 subunit. Taken together, these data show that the pore-forming α subunit of the hSlo channel promotesN-linked glycosylation of its auxiliary β4 subunit, and this in turn influences the modulation of the channel by the β4 subunit. Large conductance Ca2+-dependent potassium (KCaor maxi K) channels are composed of a pore-forming α subunit and an auxiliary β subunit.

Glycosylation modulates the activity, intracellular trafficking and targeting, and cell surface expression of ion channels. For instance, glycosylation of a neuronal Na+ channel is developmentally regulated and modulates steady state inactivation of the channel (21Tyrrell L. Renganathan M. Dib-Hajj S.D. Waxman S.G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9629-9637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cell surface stability and expression of a Shaker potassium channel are determined largely by proper channel glycosylation. Glycosylation site mutant channels, although properly folded and assembled, are degraded through cytoplasmic proteasomes (22Khanna R. Myers M.P. Laine M. Papazian D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34028-34034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Similarly,N-linked glycosylation of the HERG channel is required for its cell surface expression (23Petrecca K. Atanasiu R. Akhavan A. Shrier A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 515 (Pt 1): 41-48Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar).The auxiliary subunits of ion channels are also modified by posttranslational processes. For example, the β subunits of some Kv channels and of L-type Ca2+ channels have been shown to be modulated by phosphorylation (24Bunemann M. Gerhardstein B.L. Gao T. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33851-33854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 25Kwak Y.G., Hu, N. Wei J. George A.L. Grobaski T.D. Tamkun M.M. Murray K.T. J. Biol.

The fast inactivation of the Kv1.5 channel conferred by Kvβ1.3 is modulated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation, and this effect of cAMP-dependent protein kinase involves phosphorylation of the Kvβ1.3 subunit (25Kwak Y.G., Hu, N.

Similarly, cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation increases L-type Ca2+ channel activity, and this modulation is at least partially mediated by the phosphorylation of the Ca2+ channel β2 subunit, because mutation of two serine residues in the β2 subunit blocked this modulation (24Bunemann M. Gerhardstein B.L. Gao T. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33851-33854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that the β4 subunit of the hSlo channel is phosphorylated and that phosphorylation of this β subunit dramatically alters its interaction with the hSlo α subunit (26Jin P. Weiger T.M., Wu, Y. Levitan I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10014-10020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The β4 subunit of the hSlo channel is an integral membrane protein with a large extracellular loop between its two transmembrane segments (1Weiger T.M. Holmqvist M.H. Levitan I.B. Clark F.T. Sprague S. Huang W.J., Ge, P. Wang C. Lawson D. Jurman M.E. Glucksmann M.A. Silos-Santiago I. DiStefano P.S. Curtis R. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3563-3570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two consensus N-linked glycosylation sites exist in this extracellular loop. We show here that β4 is glycosylated, as has been shown previously for the Slo β1 subunit (27Garcia-Calvo M. Knaus H.G.

Genomics. 1999; 55: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we find that the pore-forming α subunit of the hSlo channel promotes additional β4 glycosylation in the Golgi compartment. In turn, glycosylation of β4 influences its modulation of the toxin sensitivity of the hSlo channel. Thus, reciprocal modulation exists between the pore-forming α subunit of the hSlo channel and its auxiliary β4 subunit.DISCUSSIONTraditionally, the pore-forming α subunits of ion channels have been viewed as the central target of modulation. In this context, the α-β interaction of ion channels has largely been viewed as a one-way modulation of the α subunit. Indeed, the activity of the hSlo channel is modulated by its associated β subunits (1Weiger T.M. Holmqvist M.H. Levitan I.B. Clark F.T. Sprague S. Huang W.J., Ge, P. Wang C. Lawson D. Jurman M.E.

We demonstrate here that the β4 subunit of the hSlo channel is glycosylated and that the pore-forming α subunit of the hSlo channel promotes this β4 glycosylation. This glycosylation in turn affects the ability of β4 to modulate hSlo channels by protecting them against instantaneous toxin block. This experiment is the first demonstration of such reciprocal modulation between the pore-forming α subunit and the auxiliary β subunit of an ion channel. Our results demonstrate another level of complexity to ion channel modulation.Many ion channels are heavily glycosylated. Glycosylation of ion channels has been shown to affect the intracellular transport, cell membrane targeting/stability, and activity of ion channels (16Bennett E. Urcan M.S. Tinkle S.S. Koszowski A.G.

(Lond.). 1999; 515 (Pt 1): 41-48Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For example, the gating properties of a neuronal Na+ channel change as the glycosyl moiety of the channel protein changes during development (21Tyrrell L. Renganathan M. Dib-Hajj S.D. Waxman S.G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9629-9637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In their study of Shaker potassium channel biosynthesis, Khanna et al. (22Khanna R. Myers M.P. Laine M. Papazian D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34028-34034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) showed that glycosylation increases channel surface expression and stability. This increase may result from a glycosylation-dependent interaction of the channel with calnexin that may affect the kinetics of channel protein folding and exit from the ER (22Khanna R. Myers M.P. Laine M. Papazian D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34028-34034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Similar glycosylation-dependent surface expression is observed with HERG channels, GIRK1 potassium channels, and CFTR chloride channels (23Petrecca K. Atanasiu R. Akhavan A. Shrier A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 515 (Pt 1): 41-48Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 34Kennedy M.E. Nemec J. Corey S. Wickman K. Clapham D.E. J. Biol.

Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 1225-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Examples also exist in which glycosylation does not affect channel activity and expression. For example, inhibition ofN-linked glycosylation of the KCa channel in Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells does not affect the correct apical sorting of the channel nor does it alter channel activity (36Bravo-Zehnder M. Orio P. Norambuena A. Wallner M. Meera P. Toro L. Latorre R. Gonzalez A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13114-13119Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).Two consensus N-linked glycosylation sites are present in the large extracellular loop of the β4 subunit. By using enzymatic deglycosylation and mutagenesis, we showed that β4 is glycosylated. In addition, in the absence of the hSlo α subunit, the β4 subunit is only core glycosylated, being sensitive to endoglycosidase-H. However, when hSlo α subunit is coexpressed, β4 is further modified to a highly glycosylated form made up of complex oligosaccharide chains that are resistant to Endo-H treatment.The highly glycosylated β4 is seen specifically in the presence of hSlo α subunit. Coexpression with other ion channel α subunits does not lead to the appearance of the highly glycosylated β4. Thus, this promotion of β4 glycosylation by the hSlo α subunit is unlikely to be the result of a nonspecific binding of β4 to coexpressed membrane proteins, which might simply facilitate the transport of β4 through the ER and the Golgi compartment. This fact becomes even more evident with the finding that dSlo, a channel from the same calcium-activated potassium channel family as hSlo, binds to β4 but does not induce the highly glycosylated form of β4.Holmes et al. (37Holmes T.C. Berman K. Swartz J.E. Dagan D. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8964-8974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that Kv1.5 channels that are overexpressed in HEK293 cells cause a decrease in cellular tyrosine kinase activity. However, the increased glycosylation of β4 as found in our study is unlikely to be a result of nonspecific changes in overall cellular protein glycosylation. When total protein glycosylation was analyzed by using a biotin-based labeling system, we did not detect any change in overall protein glycosylation that might be related to channel overexpression. In addition, coexpression with a variety of other potassium channels does not induce the appearance of the highly glycosylated β4, suggesting that channel activity alone does not account for the modulation of β4 glycosylation. Our data with chimeras of the dSlo and hSlo channels suggest that a specific interaction between β4 and the first transmembrane segment of hSlo is responsible for the appearance of highly glycosylated β4. 4P. Jin, T. M. Weiger, and I. B. Levitan, unpublished observation. The interaction between the hSlo α subunit and the β4 subunit may create a recognition site for Golgi-specific glycosylation enzymes, which further process the core glycosylated β4. In the absence of the hSlo α subunit, the core-glycosylated β4 may not be recognized and further modified by the appropriate enzymes. In fact, the hSlo α and β4 subunits bind together early during their biosynthesis before reaching the medial Golgi compartment, as demonstrated by our co-immunoprecipitation data. This interaction is independent of Golgi-dependent maturation of β4, because blocking ER-to-Golgi transport with brefeldin A does not prevent the hSlo-β4 interaction.Our data with surface biotinylation indicate that glycosylation of β4 is not required for its cell surface expression. It is interesting that when β4 is coexpressed with hSlo α subunit, the mature highly glycosylated β4 is dramatically enriched in the biotinylated fraction. We have also observed similar enrichment of the mature, highly glycosylated β4 in hSlo immunoprecipitates. These observations suggest that, although not strictly necessary, the mature, highly glycosylated β4 is more efficient in trafficking to the cell membrane or is more stable once it reaches the membrane.Our electrophysiological data are in agreement with previous studies showing that short-term application of the specific hSlo channel blockers charybdotoxin or iberiotoxin is not effective in the presence of a β4 subunit (1Weiger T.M. Holmqvist M.H. Levitan I.B. Clark F.T. Sprague S. Huang W.J., Ge, P. Wang C. Lawson D. Jurman M.E. Glucksmann M.A. Silos-Santiago I. DiStefano P.S. Curtis R. J.

(7Meera P. Wallner M. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5562-5567Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) suggest that β4 might act as a shield to prevent the channel pore from being accessed by the toxins. We find that non-glycosylated β4 is less effective than wild type β4 in protecting the channel against toxin block. Our data show further that both glycosylation sites need to be present in order for β4 to fully prevent instantaneous toxin block at high toxin concentrations. This fact suggests that the complex oligosaccharide chains on the extracellular loop of β4 may compete with toxin binding and/or accessibility to the channel pore. Another possibility is that removal of the oligosaccharides causes a conformational change in the extracellular loop of β4, thereby altering toxin sensitivity. The physiological function of glycosylation-dependent structural differences in β4, manifested as a change in toxin accessibility, is yet to be determined.It has become increasingly clear that ion channels are present on the cell membrane in association with β subunits and other signaling/structural proteins (38Chung S.K. Reinhart P.H. Martin B.L. Brautigan D. Levitan I.B. Science. 1991; 253: 560-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 39Schopperle W.M. Holmqvist M.H. Zhou Y. Wang J. Wang Z. Griffith L.C.

These ion channel-associated proteins modulate not only channel activity but also other aspects of channel function such as subcellular localization and cell surface stability. For example, the β subunit of Kv channels has been shown to act as a chaperone-like protein during biosynthesis of channel protein, promoting cell surface targeting of the channel (8Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K.J. Schechter L.E. Trimmer J.S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). However, the function of the ion channel α subunit in this signaling complex, other than its role in ion conductance, has not been studied. We demonstrate here that the pore-forming α subunit of the hSlo channel modulates its auxiliary β4 subunit. It is conceivable that ion channels, through their interaction with and modulation of other signaling proteins, modulate cellular function in ways that have not yet been considered. Ion channels are composed of pore-forming α subunits and auxiliary subunits (2Isom L.L., De Jongh K.S. Catterall W.A.

(Lond.). 1999; 521: 327-336Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and they are insensitive to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and bicuculline (5Shimada S. Cutting G. Uhl G.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 683-687PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kusama T. Spivak C. Whiting P. Dawson V. Schaeffer J. Uhl G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 109: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Another important difference is their distribution in the central nervous system. GABAA receptors are broadly expressed in the central nervous system, whereas GABAC receptors are found mainly in the retina, with lower levels in the brain and spinal cord (7Wegelius K. Pasternack M. Hiltunen J.O. Rivera C. Kaila K. Saama M. Reeben M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 8Enz R. Brandstatter J.H. Wassle H. Bormann J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4479-4490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although both GABAA and GABAC receptors are found in bipolar cells of the retina, their different pharmacological and physiological properties suggest distinct roles in synaptic transmission. As for nAChR, the ligand binding domains of GABA receptors are most likely located at subunit-subunit interfaces. By mutational analysis, two domains have been identified in the β2 subunit of GABAA receptors important for activation of the receptor by GABA (9Amin J. Weiss D.S. Nature. 1993; 366: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). These domains correspond to loops B and C of the nAChR ligand binding sites (10Corringer P.-J., Le Novère N. Changeux J.P. Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Important amino acids in loop B of the GABAA β2 subunit are Tyr-157 and Thr-160, and in loop C, Thr-202 and Tyr-205. Mutagenesis and photoaffinity labeling studies of the α1 subunit of the GABAA receptor have also identified a phenylalanine at position 64 (loop D; Fig.1), which appears to be involved in agonist binding (11Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20380-20387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sigel E. Baur R. Kellenberger S. Malherbe P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2017-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The residues homologous to α1F64 in the β2 (Tyr-62) and γ2 (Phe-77) subunits do not seem to play a key role in agonist binding as mutation of β2Y62 and γ2F77 resulted in a negligible shift in GABA sensitivity (12Sigel E. Baur R. Kellenberger S. Malherbe P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2017-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, a complete loss of high affinity binding was reported when β2Y62 was mutated to serine (13Newell J. Davies M. Bateson A. Dunn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14198-14204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). They suggested that β2Y62 might be a component of the high affinity GABA binding site, but not part of the binding site linked to channel gating. For the ρ1 GABAC receptor, five residues have been identified as part of the GABA binding site (3Amin J. Weiss D.S. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 227-236PubMed Google Scholar). The role of the residue in the homologous position to α1F64 and β2Y62 for homomeric ρ1 receptors (Tyr-102) has yet to be evaluated. In the present study, via site-directed mutagenesis, oocyte expression, and the two-electrode voltage clamp technique, we examined the effect of mutating Tyr-102 on the activation properties of the GABAC receptor. Our results suggest that Tyr-102 is an important component of the GABA binding domain essential for channel gating. Furthermore, serine substitution of this position creates a receptor that opens in the absence of GABA. We speculate that Tyr-102 might be important for coupling agonist binding to channel opening. The human ρ1 cDNA was cloned into the pGEMHE vector (14Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar) and site-directed mutagenesis was achieved by the polymerase chain reaction overlap extension method (15Kammann M. Laufs J. Schell J. Gronenborn B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 12: 4445-4452Google Scholar). pGEMHE-ρ1 was linearized withNheI, and cRNA synthesis was carried out using standardin vitro transcription procedures as previously described (16Chang Y. Weiss D.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 511-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Integrity, as well as yield, of the cRNA was verified on a 1% agarose gel. FemaleXenopus laevis (Xenopus I, Ann Arbor, MI) were anesthetized by 0.2% MS-222 (3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, methanesulfonate salt), and oocytes were surgically removed from the frog and placed in calcium-free oocyte Ringers-2 (OR2) incubation solution consisting of 92.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmKCl, 5 mm HEPES, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmNa2HPO4, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin, pH 7.5. Oocytes were dispersed in this solution plus 0.3% collagenase A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with constant stirring at room temperature for 1.5–2 h. The dispersed oocytes were thoroughly rinsed with the above solution plus 1 mmCaCl2. After this, stage VI oocytes were isolated and incubated at 18 °C. Micropipettes for injecting cRNA were pulled from borosilicate glass (Drummond Scientific, Broomall, PA) on a Sutter P87 horizontal puller, and the tips were cut off with microscissors to a 40-μm outer diameter. cRNAs were diluted 10- to 50-fold with diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. The cRNA was injected into the oocytes with a Nanoject delivery system (Drummond Scientific) at a total injection volume of 40–50 nl (25–100 ng/μl). One to 3 days after injection, oocytes expressing ρ1 wild-type or mutant receptors were placed on a 300-μm nylon mesh suspended in a small volume chamber (< 100 μl). The oocyte, voltage-clamped at −70 mV, was continuously perfused at a rate of 150–200 μl/s with a solution consisting of (in mm): NaCl, 92.5; KCl, 2.5; HEPES, 5; CaCl2, 1; MgCl2, 1; pH 7.5, and briefly switched to the test solution that consisted of this same perfusion solution plus drug (e.g. GABA). Recording microelectrodes filled with 3m KCl had resistances of 1–3 MΩ. Standard two-electrode voltage clamp techniques were used to record currents in response to application of agonist. Dose-response and dose-inhibition relations were fit with the following forms of the Hill equation using a nonlinear least-squares method, ActivationI=Imax1+(EC50/[A])n(Eq. 1) InhibitionI=Imax1+([A]/IC50)n(Eq. 2) where I is the current amplitude,I max is the maximum current amplitude for that particular agonist or antagonist ([A]), EC50is the agonist concentration that induces a 50% maximal response, IC50 is the antagonist concentration that produces half-maximal inhibition, and n is the Hill coefficient. Stock solutions of 100 mm 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA; Toronto Research Chemicals Inc., Ontario, Canada) were prepared fresh in ice-cold water and maintained on ice. Working solutions were prepared in OR2 just before use. Originally, for GABA dose-response experiments, oocytes expressing ρ1 wild-type and Y102C receptors were treated for 10 min in 2.5 mm MTSEA, washed for 5 min with OR2, and returned to the recording chamber. For protection experiments, we used the lowest concentration of MTSEA to produce near maximal blockage. Hence, oocytes expressing Y102C were treated directly in the recording chamber for 105 s with 1 μm MTSEA in the absence or presence of 300 μm GABA, 1.5 mm3-APMPA (Tocris Cookson, Inc.), or 30 μm picrotoxin and then washed for 5 min with OR2 before recording. Wild-type receptors treated with 2.5 mm MTSEA showed no change in the EC50 and Hill coefficient, although there was a modest potentiation of the maximum current (∼16%). We do not know the mechanism of this increase in the maximum GABA-activated current induced by MTSEA incubation. We observed a time-dependent spontaneous recovery from Y102C MTSEA-modified receptors (data not shown). A similar recovery has been previously described for MTSEA modification of the acetylcholine receptor (17Akabas H.M. Stauffer D.A., Xu, M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). To assess the role of Tyr-102 in receptor activation, this residue was mutated to five different amino acids: phenylalanine, cysteine, serine, tryptophan, and glycine. Wild-type and mutant receptors were expressed in X. laevisoocytes, and GABA-activated currents were examined with the two-electrode voltage clamp. Fig.2 A shows the GABA-activated current traces from representative oocytes, and Fig. 2 Bpresents the normalized average dose-response relations. All mutants expressed functional receptors with robust current responses. The concentration of GABA necessary to produce half-maximal activation (EC50) was increased for Y102C, Y102S, Y102W, and Y102G mutants by 31-, 214-, 664-, and 8752-fold, respectively (TableI). The phenylalanine substitution, however, did not produce a significant change in the EC50. Excluding Y102F, this position has a low tolerance for substitution as mutations produced dramatic impairments of the GABA sensitivity.Table IEC50 values and Hill coefficients for Tyr-102 mutantsMutationEC50EC50 shiftHill coefficientNo. of oocytesμmfoldWild type0.87 ± 0.0812.74 ± 0.505Y102F0.74 ± 0.100.852.91 ± 0.144Y102C26.8 ± 6.7311.36 ± 0.276Y102S186 ± 262141.68 ± 0.085Y102W578 ± 356642.06 ± 0.044Y102G7614 ± 107887521.62 ± 0.196Values are mean ± S.D.

It has previously been shown that ρ1 homomeric GABAC receptors can be activated by several GABA agonists such a TACA and I4AA, which differ in their sensitivities and efficacies (6Kusama T. Spivak C.

Fig.3 A presents normalized average TACA dose-response relations in oocytes expressing wild-type, Y102C, and Y102S ρ1 receptors. The EC50 values for Y102C and Y102S were increased 83- and 582-fold, respectively. Fig. 3 Bshows normalized average dose-response relations for I4AA. The EC50 for I4AA increased 62- and 126-fold in the Y102C and Y102S receptors, respectively.

Open table in a new tab Values are mean ± S.D. It has been described that GABA and TACA have similar efficacies in the activation of ρ1 receptors, while the efficacy of I4AA is much lower (19Chang Y. Covey D. Weiss D.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Table II presents the maximum efficacy for these agonists for ρ1 wild-type, Y102S and Y102C receptors. Agonist efficacy was obtained from the maximum current normalized to theI max for GABA. (Efficacy could not be determined for the Y102W and Y102G mutants because the large shift in EC50 precluded the construction of a complete dose-response relation). Interestingly, the efficacy for I4AA relative to GABA was increased in the Y102S and Y102C receptors to 13.3 ± 4.0% and 61.0 ± 3.0%, respectively, compared with 6.6 ± 1.6% for wild-type receptors. The interpretation of this change in efficacy will be considered under “Discussion.” Nevertheless, if the mutations were purely impairing steps subsequent to agonist binding (e.g. gating of the pore), one might expect the EC50 shifts for the different agonists to be similar in a given mutant (20Zhang H.-G. ffrench-Constant R.H. Jackson M.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 479: 65-75Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 and Table II, the shifts were not similar suggesting, at the very least, that the receptor affinity has been decreased. By definition, a competitive antagonist binds to the same (or overlapping) site as the agonist. Alternatively, a noncompetitive antagonist is thought to allosterically inhibit the receptor by interacting at a site distinct from the binding domain. Therefore, simplistically, a mutation in the agonist binding site might be expected to alter the EC50 for agonists as well as the IC50 for competitive antagonists, but perhaps not alter the IC50 for noncompetitive antagonists. We compared the effect of the ρ1 competitive antagonist 3-APMPA and the noncompetitive antagonist picrotoxin on GABA-induced currents in oocytes expressing Y102S and wild-type receptors. Fig. 4,A and B show the effect of increasing concentrations of 3-APMPA on the current induced by a GABA concentration equal to the EC50; 0.9 μm and 200 μm for wild-type and Y102S, respectively. The Y102S mutation increased the IC50 for 3-APMPA from 0.267 ± 0.021 μm to 132.8 ± 15.9 μm, a 492-fold decrease in sensitivity. Note that in oocytes injected with Y102S, application of 1000 μm 3-APMPA resulted in a net outward current. As we will discuss in a subsequent section, this is due to inhibition of the spontaneously opening Y102S receptors. Fig. 4 C shows the effect of increasing concentrations of picrotoxin on GABA-activated currents for wild-type and Y102S receptors. The application of picrotoxin reduced, in a dose-dependent manner, the GABA-induced current. The ρ1 wild-type IC50 was 0.38 ± 0.05 μmcompared with 0.26 ± 0.08 for Y102S. As opposed to 3-APMPA, the sensitivity to picrotoxin was not altered. The data in Fig. 4 provide further evidence that Tyr-102 is associated with the agonist binding site. The substituted cysteine accessibility method has been successfully employed to identify functional domains of membrane receptors (21Karlin A. Akabas M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). This technique consists of mutating the amino acid of interest to cysteine and then studying the interaction of this cysteine with sulfhydryl-reactive compounds. Fig. 5 A shows GABA-mediated currents in a representative oocyte expressing the Y102C receptor before and after application of MTSEA. Fig. 5 B shows the corresponding GABA dose-response relations. The EC50 before modification was 22.9 μm (filled symbols). After modification, we observed a bimodal dose-response relation (open symbols). Fitting these data to the sum of two Hill equations yielded EC50 values of 38.5 and 9615 μm for this particular oocyte. The average EC5 values obtained after modification were 54.1 ± 19.8 and 8543.3 ± 2226.7 μm with 69.4 ± 4.3% of the total amplitude in the low sensitivity component (n = 6). Note that the decay of the current upon agonist removal was also bimodal after MTSEA treatment (Fig.5 A). The slower decay likely corresponds to the “high”-sensitivity component, and the faster decay likely corresponds to the “low”-sensitivity component. We interpret the bimodal dose-response data in Fig. 5 B as two populations of receptors; unmodified and MTSEA-modified. These two populations could be due to an incomplete modification by MTSEA, the time-dependent recovery from modification (see “Experimental Procedures”), or a combination of the two. Nevertheless, the main point is that this residue is accessible to modification, and this modification increased the EC50 an additional 160-fold above the cysteine mutation itself. If Tyr-102 is part of the agonist binding site, the interaction of Y102C with MTSEA should be prevented by co-treatment with agonist (GABA) or competitive antagonist (3-APMPA), but probably not by a non-competitive antagonist (picrotoxin). Oocytes expressing Y102C were treated for 105 s with 1 μmMTSEA either in the absence or in the presence of 300 μmGABA, 1.5 mm 3-APMPA, or 30 μm picrotoxin. These concentrations of GABA, 3-APMPA, and picrotoxin are 10-fold greater than the EC50 and IC50 for the respective agonist or antagonists. The current amplitude in response to 30 μm GABA, which detects mostly the high-affinity component, was compared before and after MTSEA treatment. Fig.6 shows the current amplitudes normalized to that obtained before the treatment. After treatment with MTSEA, MTSEA plus GABA, MTSEA plus 3-APMPA, or MTSEA plus picrotoxin the currents were 0.052 ± 0.02, 0.72 ± 0.12, 0.81 ± 0.052, and 0.051 ± 0.022, respectively, of the control value. Thus, both agonist and competitive antagonist, but not non-competitive antagonist, protected Y102C from chemical modification supporting the conclusion that Tyr-102 is part of the agonist binding site. The current remaining after MTSEA treatment in Fig. 6 (∼5%) was less than that in Fig. 5 (∼25%). The greater value seen in Fig. 5likely reflects the spontaneous recovery from modification since, in this case, the recording was initiated 20 min after MTSEA treatment (see “Experimental Procedures”). We have also examined the mutation and MTSEA modification of the residues immediately adjacent to Tyr-102: Leu-101 and Leu-103. The EC50 values for the L101C mutation were 1.32 ± 0.14 μm and 1.08 ± 0.10 μm(n = 3) before and after MTSEA modification. For L103C, the EC50 values were 0.76 ± 0.06 μm and 0.80 ± 0.09 μm before and after modification, respectively. The similarity between the agonist sensitivities of the Leu-101 and Leu-103 mutations and the wild-type receptor suggests that these neighboring residues do not play a key role in ligand binding. Since the mutation itself does not alter receptor sensitivity, we cannot rule out the possibility that the cysteine modification occurred, but did not alter, receptor sensitivity. Nevertheless, these data highlight a potentially important role for Tyr-102 in agonist-mediated activation. In oocytes expressing Y102S, we observed an uncharacteristically high resting conductance that was 15–25% of the maximum GABA-induced current. We speculated that this resting conductance might be due to spontaneously opening GABA receptors and tested this hypothesis by examining the effects of 3-APMPA and picrotoxin in the absence of GABA. Application of 3-APMPA reduced the resting conductance in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.7 A) with an IC50of 93.5 ± 15.4 μm, n = 7 (Fig.7 B). This value was close to the IC50 of 132.8 ± 15.9 μm for 3-APMPA determined in the presence of 200 μm GABA for the same mutant (Fig. 4). Application of picrotoxin to oocytes expressing Y102S also produced a decrease in the resting conductance in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 0.382 ± 0.113 μm, n = 5 (Fig. 7 B), which was not significantly different from that obtained for the wild-type receptor in the presence of 0.9 μm GABA (0.255 ± 0.083 μm, n = 3; Fig. 4). The abilities of picrotoxin and 3-APMPA to block the resting conductance supports the conclusion that the Y102S mutation produced spontaneously opening GABA receptors. We also examined whether the mutation of other ligand binding residues described previously in the ρ1 receptor (3Amin J. Weiss D.S. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 227-236PubMed Google Scholar) produced spontaneous opening when expressed in oocytes. The spontaneous current was studied by application of 30 μm picrotoxin to oocytes expressing the different mutants (data not shown). The outward current induced by this concentration of picrotoxin was considered the maximum. The percentage of picrotoxin-sensitive current (in the absence of GABA) relative to the maximum GABA-activated currents for wild-type, Y102S, Y198S, Y241S, and T244S receptors were 0.97 ± 0.29%, 19.19 ± 5.55%, 3.25 ± 2.05%, 0.13 ± 0.13%, and 0.045 ± 0. 064%, respectively. Although no current was detected with 30 mm GABA for Y200S and Y247S receptors (3Amin J. Weiss D.S. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 227-236PubMed Google Scholar), we still tested for spontaneous opening with 30 μm picrotoxin for which there was no effect. Although a small picrotoxin-sensitive current was observed for Y198S receptors, this was minor compared with that of the Y102S receptor. We have identified a residue of the homomeric ρ1 GABAC receptor that appears to be part of the ligand-binding site based on several findings. First, mutation of Tyr-102 increased the EC50 for activation by GABA, I4AA, and TACA. An increase in EC50 has to be interpreted with caution because a change in affinity or change in gating (or both) can impair agonist sensitivity (9Amin J. Weiss D.S. Nature. 1993; 366: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). An increase in the EC50 as a consequence of an alteration in gating could be accompanied by a decrease in the maximum for a low efficacy receptor, as is the case for ρ1 (22Chang Y. Weiss D.S. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A comparison of the maxima across receptors (mutant and wild-type) is difficult since there may be differences in the cRNA integrity and/or the mutation may affect assembly. However, we can examine the maximum current for Y102C both before and after MTSEA modification. Although cysteine modification imparted an ∼160-fold decrease in receptor sensitivity, the ratio of the current after modification to that observed before was 0.81 ± 0.09 (n = 5). These data suggest an impairment of affinity, with perhaps a slight alteration in efficacy. In addition, the Y102C mutation increased the efficacy for I4AA relative to that of GABA. However, the structural coupling between the ligand binding site and the portions of the receptor that transduce ligand binding into channel opening may obviate a pure mutational effect on binding. As we will consider in a later section, this change in efficacy is consistent with our postulation of this residue playing a pivotal role in coupling ligand binding to channel opening. A second argument in support of Tyr-102 being associated with the agonist binding site is that the sensitivity of the receptor for GABA, TACA, and I4AA were shifted by different degrees. If the mutation altered steps subsequent to agonist binding, then, simplistically, the mutation would have a roughly similar degree of an effect on the sensitivity to different agonists, which was clearly not the case (Table II). The participation of Tyr-102 in agonist binding is further supported by the observation that point mutations at Tyr-102 dramatically decreased the sensitivity of the receptor for the competitive antagonist 3-APMPA. Similarly, a decrease in sensitivity for the competitive antagonists bicuculline and SR95531 was observed for point mutations affecting the homologous residue in the α1 subunit (Phe-64) of GABAAreceptors (12Sigel E. Baur R. Kellenberger S. Malherbe P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2017-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutations at the ligand binding site should not affect the sensitivity of the receptor for a non-competitive antagonist such as picrotoxin, which was the case, as its site of action has been located in the M2 region of the ρ1 receptor (23Zhang D. Pan Z. Awobuluyi M. Lipton S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 121-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Modification of Y102C by MTSEA indicated that this residue is in an aqueous-accessible phase and also supports that Tyr-102 is part of the GABA binding site since modification of this cysteine increased the GABA EC50. Finally, this modification was protected by an agonist and a competitive antagonist but not protected by a non-competitive antagonist. We made multiple amino acid substitutions at Tyr-102 with the goal of providing information on the physical requirements for the residue at this position. Such correlation with amino acid properties such as hydrophobicity, charge, and size are difficult since any single substitution will change more than one physical property at that position. Nevertheless, in all cases except phenylalanine, amino acid replacement at Tyr-102 significantly increased the EC50. While there was no obvious relationship between the hydrophobicity of the substituted residue and the EC50 (not shown), the size of the amino acid at this position seemed critical. We note that as the side chain at position 102 was made smaller (Tyr > Cys > Ser > Gly) (data not shown), there was a strong inverse correlation with the EC50. Larger substitutions (tryptophan and modified cysteine) produced much more dramatic shifts in the EC50for relatively smaller changes in size indicating less of a tolerance for bulky side groups. The phenylalanine substitution at position 102 did not affect receptor properties. However, introduction of a serine residue, which conserves the hydroxyl group but removes the aromatic ring, increased the GABA EC50. Consistent with these data is that the homologous position in GABAA subunits is either a tyrosine or a phenylalanine (Fig. 1). It is well known that aromatic residues are part of the binding sites of this ligand-gated ion channel family (24Galzi J.L. Changeux J.-P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 554-565Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In addition to Tyr-102, other aromatic amino acids have been described at the agonist binding site of homomeric ρ1 receptors (3Amin J.

It has been suggested that cation-π interactions of the aromatic ring are important in the interaction between the ligand and its binding site (30Dougherty D. Stauffer D. Science. 1990; 250: 1558-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). However, we cannot discard the importance of other factors such as hydrogen bonding capability, charge, or hydrophobicity. An interesting finding was that the Y102S mutation can produce channel opening in the absence of GABA. There have been mutations described in the M2 region of GABA receptors that induce spontaneous channel opening both for GABA receptors (16Chang Y. Weiss D.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 511-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 31Buhr A. Wagner C. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. Sigel E. J. Biol.

Nature. 1995; 376: 514-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, however, this is the first study using conventional site-directed mutagenesis at a putative binding site of a ligand-gated ion channel that creates spontaneous opening receptors; although a constitutively active nAChR receptor has been obtained using the nonsense suppression method (36Zhong W. Gallivan J. Zhang Y., Li, L. Lester H. Dougherty D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12088-12093Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). In that study an unnatural amino acid with a quaternary ammonium ion tethered to a side chain was incorporated at the binding site residue Trp-149, and it was postulated that the substitution mimicked the ligand. They also observed that a competitive antagonist could close the spontaneously opening channel suggesting the antagonist does not simply prevent the binding of agonist but may induce a conformational change on its own and stabilize the receptor in a closed state. In support of this, crystallization of the glutamate receptor (GluR2) in the presence of the competitive glutamate antagonist, 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX), stabilized the binding cleft in an expanded conformation (37Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). At this point we cannot explain why only the serine substitution at Tyr-102, and not the other substitutions, produced spontaneous opening. We have no reason to believe that the serine serves as a weak agonist. It more likely depends upon the degree of perturbation in the binding site region, which could depend on a combination of physical characteristics of the substituted residue such as hydrophobicity, charge, size, and flexibility. While we have proposed that Tyr-102 is associated with the ligand binding site of the ρ1 GABAC receptor, there are some differences that distinguish Tyr-102 from the other ligand binding residues that have been identified in the GABAC receptor. First, is the promotion of a substantial spontaneous opening with a serine mutation at this position. The second distinguishing feature is the effect of the substitution at this position on the sensitivity to agonist-mediated activation. If we consider the phenylalanine substitutions for the four tyrosines previously postulated to play a role in agonist binding (Y198F, Y200F, Y241F, and Y247F) a 11.4-, 14.3-, 17.5-, and 47.5-fold decrease in GABA sensitivity was observed, respectively (3Amin J. Weiss D.S. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 227-236PubMed Google Scholar), as compared with no change in sensitivity for Y102F. If we consider the serine substitutions at these positions, a 2509-, >26,000-, 2672-, and >26,000-fold decrease, respectively, in GABA sensitivity was observed compared with only 214-fold for Y102S. Although the shifts are much less dramatic for Tyr-102, we still believe that this is a crucial residue in the agonist binding site based on the previously mentioned observations as well as the fact that Tyr-102 lines up with binding site residues of the GABAAand nACh receptor as well as a ligand binding residue in the recently crystallized acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP) from the snail Lymnaea stagnalis (38Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). In that case, Tyr-102 aligns with Trp-53 of AChBP and resides in loop D in the bottom half of the binding cavity. The afore mentioned tyrosines align with residues in loops B and C that form the wall of the binding cleft and are contributed by the subunit that neighbors loop D. In summary, we speculate that Tyr-102 may play a pivotal role in transducing the ligand binding event to the sequence of events that lead to channel opening. In this scenario, agonist binds in the cavity and is mainly stabilized via interactions with key ligand binding residues. Once the agonist is bound, the constriction (or expansion) of the binding site is favored, perhaps through interactions of the ligand with other residues (e.g. Tyr-102). This could set forth the cascade of events (conformational wave) that leads to channel opening (39Grosman C. Zhou M. Auerbach A. Nature. 2000; 403: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the mutation-induced spontaneous opening since a structural perturbation in this region could, similar to agonist in the wild-type receptor, initiate the sequence of events culminating in an open pore. Of course this must remain a working hypothesis until the open and closed (as well as unbound and bound) states of the GABA ligand binding domain have been structurally resolved."
https://openalex.org/W2025588093,"Phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) was purified to homogeneity from the supernatant fraction of rat testis homogenate. The purified 63-kDa enzyme did not require Ca(2+) ions for activity and exhibited both phosphatidic acid-preferring PLA(2) and monoacylglycerol lipase activities with a modest specificity toward unsaturated acyl chains. Anionic detergents enhanced these activities. Serine-modifying irreversible inhibitors, (p-amidinophenyl) methanesulfonyl fluoride and methylarachidonyl fluorophosphonate, inhibited both activities to a similar extent, indicating a single active site is involved in PLA(2) and lipase activities. The sequence of NH(2)-terminal 12 amino acids of purified enzyme was identical to that of a carboxylesterase from rat liver. The optimal pH for PLA(2) activity (around 5.5) differed from that for lipase activity (around 8.0). At pH 5.5 the enzyme also hydrolyzed bis(monoacylglycerol) phosphate, or lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA), that has been hitherto known as a secretory PLA(2)-resistant phospholipid and a late endosome marker. LBPA-enriched fractions were prepared from liver lysosome fractions of chloroquine-treated rats, treated with excess of pancreatic PLA(2), and then used for assaying LBPA-hydrolyzing activity. LBPA and the reaction products were identified by microbore normal phase high performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization ion-trap mass spectrometry. These enzymatic properties suggest that the enzyme can metabolize phosphatidic and lysobisphosphatidic acids in cellular acidic compartments."

The fate of E∼I depends on the relative values ofk i and k s, the rate constants for inhibitory and substrate pathways, respectively. However, both the formation of the inhibitory complex (E-I) and regeneration of the proteinase because of the substrate reaction (results in an inactive cleaved PAI-1 (Scheme FS1, I*)) yield RCL-inserted species of the inhibitor.

Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 215-221Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Human recombinant uPA was from Abbott Laboratories (North Chicago, IL). The concentrations of tPA and uPA were calculated from absorbance at 280 nm usingM r values of 63,500 and 54,000 and ε280 of 1.90 and 1.36 ml mg−1cm−1, respectively. The monoclonal mouse antibodies MA-55F4C12, MA-33H1F7, and MA-8H9D4 were selected from the panel raised against the human PAI-1·tPA complex (40Debrock S. Declerck P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1337: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The antibody concentration was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.3 ml mg−1 cm−1and M r of 150,000. The concentration of NBD P9 PAI-1 and the incorporation of the NBD group were determined from absorbances at 280 and 480 nm, respectively (43Shore J.D. Day D.E. Francis-Chmura A.M. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5395-5398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Active NBD P9 PAI-1 was determined by titration of the inhibitor with solutions of uPA or tPA of known concentration. The reaction of NBD P9 PAI-1 with uPA or tPA resulted in stoichiometric formation of a complex (26Lawrence D.A. Olson S.T. Muhammad S. Day D.E. Kvassman J.O. Ginsburg D. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5839-5844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and was accompanied by a significant increase in fluorescence (43Shore J.D. Day D.E. Francis-Chmura A.M. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5395-5398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This fluorescence enhancement was used to monitor completion of the reaction with uPA or tPA using an SLM 8000 spectrofluorimeter (excitation 480 nm, emission 529 nm). The increase in the fraction of the substrate reaction (Scheme FS1) can be expressed quantitatively by the stoichiometry of inhibition (SI = 1 +k s/k i), i.e. the number of moles of PAI-1 required for inactivation of one mole of proteinase (26Lawrence D.A.

Gettins P.G.W. Huntington J.A. Patston P.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9562-9570Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of mAbs on the distribution between inhibitory and substrate reactions, SI values were calculated as a ratio of the number of moles of NBD P9 PAI-1 required for complete titration of one mole of proteinase with and without mAb. The values of SI for NBD P9 PAI-1 and its complexes with mAbs were determined directly by titration of the same amount of inhibitor with tPA or uPA using SLM 8000 spectrofluorimeter. Complexes of NBD P9 PAI-1 with mAb were preformed under equilibrium conditions for at least 15 min at 25 °C. The limiting SI values for the reactions of all NBD P9 PAI-1·mAb complexes with tPA and uPA were determined from the dependence of relative SI versus mAb concentration. The fraction of the substrate reaction for complexes of wtPAI-1 with MA-55F4C12 and MA-33H1F7 were determined from gel scans as described elsewhere (25Kvassman J.O. Verhamme I. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15491-15502Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The SI values for wtPAI-1/MA-8H9D4 were estimated directly from the change in the intensity of bands of cleaved and uncleaved wtPAI-1 on PAGE gels after titration with proteinase. The samples of inhibitor and its complexes with MA-8H9D4 were incubated with decreasing amounts of tPA or uPA, and the reaction mixtures were analyzed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE using Mini-PROTEAN II (Bio-Rad) followed by Coomassie Blue staining (Pierce). The gels were scanned and analyzed as described previously (25Kvassman J.O. Verhamme I. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15491-15502Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The affinities of all three mAbs studied for active NBD P9 PAI-1 were estimated from the dependence of changes in k obs for reaction with tPA on mAb concentration. Different amounts of each mAb were incubated with 2.4 nm NBD P9 PAI-1 for 15 min, and thek obs values for the reaction with tPA were measured using SX-18MV micro-volume stopped-flow reaction analyzer (Applied Photophysics Ltd.) equipped with a fluorescence detector and thermostated cell. The excitation wavelength was 480 nm, and the reaction progress was monitored measuring an increase in fluorescence emission through a 500-nm cut-off filter. The data were fitted to a single exponential process, and determined k obsvalues were plotted against mAb concentration. The values ofK d were estimated from the midpoints of dependence of k obs versus the logarithm of mAb concentration. The displacement ofp-aminobenzamidine (PAB) (47Evans S.A. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3014-3017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14891-14895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to determine the effect of mAbs on proteinase binding to PAI-1 as described earlier (32Bijnens A.P. Gils A. Stassen J.M. Komissarov A.A. Knockaert I. Brouwers E. Shore J.D. Declerck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44912-44918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). uPA (0.08–0.16 μm) or tPA (0.15–0.5 μm) was preincubated with PAB (100 and 180–400 μm, respectively) for 10 min at 25 °C. PAI-1 (1.6 μm) or its complex with each mAb was reacted with proteinase/PAB complex using the SX-18MV (excitation wavelengths were 320 and 330 nm for uPA and tPA, respectively). The reaction progress has been monitored by a decrease in the fluorescent emission through a 335-nm cut-off filter. Data were fitted to a single exponential equation F t = A + B · e−k(obs)t whereF t is fluorescence at time t,A is an offset, B is the amplitude, andk obs is the pseudo first-order rate constant. The values of k obs for wtPAI-1 were compared with those for inhibitor/mAb complexes. Stopped-flow fluorimetry was employed to measure the rates of reaction between NBD P9 PAI-1·mAb complexes and tPA or uPA. The SX-18MV was used to monitor the changes in NBD fluorescence of NBD P9 PAI-1 as a result of the RCL insertion as described above. Measurements were performed under pseudo first-order conditions ([proteinase] > 5 [NBD P9 PAI-1] and a 50–100-fold excess of mAb) with a constant concentration of NBD P9 PAI-1·mAb complexes. The complexes were prepared by preincubation of 5.0–10.0 nm NBD P9 PAI-1 with 0.5–1.0 μmmAb at least 15 min prior to data collection. Traces of changes in fluorescence obtained were analyzed by nonlinear regression and fitted to a single exponential process: F t = A +B (1 − e−k(obs)t). Values ofk obs (average of 4–6 measurements) were plotted against proteinase concentration and fitted to the hyperbolic equationk obs = k lim · [E]/(K 0.5 + [E]) wherek lim is the rate-limiting constant at an infinite concentration of proteinase ([E]), andK 0.5 is the proteinase concentration at half-saturation. According to Scheme FS1, k lim =k 2 (k i +k s)/(k 2 +k −2 + k i +k s) (25Kvassman J.O. Verhamme I. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15491-15502Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 26Lawrence D.A. Olson S.T. Muhammad S. Day D.E. Kvassman J.O. Ginsburg D. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5839-5844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The affinities of MA-55F4C12 for RCL-inserted species of NBD P9 PAI-1 were determined by direct equilibrium titration using SLM 8000 spectrofluorimeter. Complexes of NBD P9 PAI-1 with tPA and uPA were obtained by mixing stoichiometric amounts of inhibitor and proteinase (10% excess). Catalytic amounts of elastase (usually 1.0–0.1% NBD P9 PAI-1) were used to produce RCL-inserted NBD P9 PAI-1 with a hydrolyzed P3–P4 bond (49Lawrence D.A. Olson S.T. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 2–3 h. Preformed acyl enzyme complexes and elastase-cleaved NBD P9 PAI-1 were titrated with MA-55F4C12 measuring the increase in fluorescence emission at 530 nm (excitation 480 nm). The K d values were calculated from binding isotherms generated by plotting changes in fluorescence emission versus mAb concentration. The mixtures of PAI-1 with two mAbs (MA-8H9D4 and MA-55F4C12, MA-8H9D4 and MA-33H1F7, or MA-55F4C12 and MA-33H1F7) have been separated by gel chromatography on a Superdex-200 column using the AktaPrime liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). Preformed samples (2.5 μmof each mAb were added to 2.0–10 μm PAI-1 in different order) were incubated for 10–15 min at 4 °C, and 0.1 ml was injected in the 10 × 30-cm column equilibrated with 0.05m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with 0.15 m NaCl. Elution was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. The column was calibrated with gel-filtration standard (Bio-Rad) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The values of the elution volume obtained for PAI-1, mAb, and PAI-1·mAb complexes were used for estimation of the relative molecular mass (M r) and the stoichiometry of PAI-1/mAb complexes formed. Stopped-flow fluorimetry was used to monitor the rates of increase in NBD fluorescence emission because of the interaction of RCL-inserted species with MA-55F4C12. NBD P9 PAI-1/proteinase complexes were preformed as described above. An excess (1.2 times) of MA-8H9D4 was added to the samples of NBD P9 PAI-1/proteinase and incubated 10–15 min prior to measurements. The RCL-inserted NBD P9 PAI-1·MA-8H9D4 complex has been obtained by incubation of NBD P9 PAI-1·MA-8H9D4 with 10–15% proteinase for 20–30 min at room temperature. Changes in NBD fluorescence attributed to MA-55F4C12 binding were detected over at least five half-lifetimes using the SX-18MV. The k obs values were calculated and plotted versus mAb concentration. The second-order rate constants of mAb association were determined from slopes of the linear dependence obtained. The reactions between MA-55F4C12 and NBD P9 PAI-1/proteinase/MA-8H9D4 and RCL-inserted NBD P9 PAI-1·MA-8H9D4 complexes were monitored and analyzed in the same manner. Changes in the fraction of the substrate pathway induced by binding of MA-55F4C12 and MA-33H1F7 have been estimated (TableI) directly from SDS-PAGE gels of wtPAI-1·mAb complexes incubated with a 1.5–2 molar excess of proteinase. Gels were scanned and analyzed to quantify the amounts of the inhibitory complex (Scheme FS1, E-I) and cleaved inhibitor (I*) as described previously (25Kvassman J.O. Verhamme I. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15491-15502Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of inhibition (SI) for wtPAI-1·MA-8H9D4 complex demonstrating an almost complete shift to the substrate reaction (Table I) was determined from SDS-PAGE gels of samples incubated with decreasing amounts of proteinase (Fig. 1).Table IFraction of the substrate pathway and SIaSI values were determined as limits of the dependence of the ratio of the number of moles of NBD P9 PAI-1 required for titration of 1 mole of proteinase with and without the addition of the antibody on mAb concentration., bThe fraction of the substrate reaction for complexes of wtPAI-1 with MA-55F4C12 or MA-33H1F7 was estimated from SDS-PAGE gels as described previously (25)., cThe fraction of the substrate reaction for complexes of wtPAI-1 with MA-8H9D4 was determined from SDS-PAGE gels of samples of PAI-1 · mAb complex incubated with decreasing proteinase concentrations as described under “Experimental Procedures.” for the reactions of wtPAI-1 and NBD P9 PAI-1/mAb complexes with tPA and uPAwtPAI-1NBD P9 PAI-1ProteinaseMA-55F4C12 substrate reactionMA-33H1F7 substrate reactionMA-8H9D4 substrate reactionMA-55F4C12MA-33H1F7MA-8H9D4SISubstrate reactionSISubstrate reactionSISubstrate reaction%%%%%%tPA9070>984.7 ± 0.579 ± 22.7 ± 0.462 ± 560 ± 1098.3 ± 0.3uPA8060>982.5 ± 0.360 ± 52.0 ± 0.250 ± 565 ± 1098.5 ± 0.3a SI values were determined as limits of the dependence of the ratio of the number of moles of NBD P9 PAI-1 required for titration of 1 mole of proteinase with and without the addition of the antibody on mAb concentration.b The fraction of the substrate reaction for complexes of wtPAI-1 with MA-55F4C12 or MA-33H1F7 was estimated from SDS-PAGE gels as described previously (25Kvassman J.O.

https://openalex.org/W2065098138,"The human Rad52 protein self-associates to form ring-shaped oligomers, as well as higher order complexes of these rings. We have shown previously that there are two experimentally separable self-association domains in HsRad52, one in the N terminus (residues 1–192) responsible for assembly of individual subunits into rings, and one in the C terminus (residues 218–418) responsible for higher order oligomerization of rings. Earlier studies suggest that the higher order complexes promote DNA end-joining, and others suggest that these complexes are relevant to in vivo Rad52 function. In this study we demonstrate that although inherent binding to single-stranded DNA depends on neither higher order complexes of Rad52 rings nor the ring-shaped oligomers themselves, higher order complexes are important for activities involving simultaneous interaction with more than one DNA molecule. This provides biochemical support for what may be an important in vivo function of Rad52.

Chromosomal double strand breaks (DSBs) 1The abbreviations used for: DSBs, double strand breaks; PEI, polyethyleneimine; ds, double-stranded; ss, single-stranded. 1The abbreviations used for: DSBs, double strand breaks; PEI, polyethyleneimine; ds, double-stranded; ss, single-stranded. occur both as a natural consequence of genome replication and division and through the damaging effects of ionizing radiation and environmental mutagens. Accurate repair of DSBs by homologous recombination is critical for the maintenance and propagation of genome integrity. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae members of the RAD52 epistasis group,RAD50, RAD51, RAD52, RAD54,RAD55, RAD57, MRE11, andXRS2 were identified as components of the homologous recombination repair pathway because of the sensitivity of mutants to ionizing radiation (1Game J. Mortimer R.K. Mutat. Res. 1974; 24: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). These gene products were also shown to play important roles in both mitotic and meiotic recombination (2Petes T.D. Malone R.E. Symington L.S. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W.

Mammalian counterparts for many of these RAD52 group genes have been discovered, and although there is substantial similarity between yeast and mammalian recombination pathways, both cellular and biochemical studies have revealed significant differences in the identity, regulation, and function of many of the component proteins (reviewed in Refs. 3Karran P.

The human Rad52 protein (HsRad52) shares many similarities with yeast Rad52 regarding both its structure and function in homologous recombination.

This map has been modified by our identification of a C-terminal self-association domain that mediates formation of higher order oligomerization of Rad52 rings (11Ranatunga W. Jackson D. Lloyd J.A.

Regarding the possible functional relevance of these higher order oligomers, Van Dyck et al. (9Van Dyck E. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. West S.C. Nature. 1999; 398: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) observed DNA end binding complexes consisting of multiple rings of HsRad52. In yeast, distinct Rad52 foci that undoubtedly contain multiple protein rings form under conditions that result in DSBs, e.g. during meiosis and in S phase mitotic cells, and following exposure to γ-irradiation (27Lisby M. Rothstein R. Mortensen U.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8276-8282Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Also, co-localization of RAD52 group proteins, including Rad51, Rad52, and Rad54, is observed following DNA damage in mammalian cells (28Raderschall E. Golub E.I. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1921-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 29Liu Y. Li M.-J. Lee E.Y.-H.P. Maizels N. Curr.

Therefore, it appears that the ability of Rad52 to form higher order oligomeric complexes may be important to its function in promoting homologous recombination, and it has been suggested that such complexes may be required as an early step in the efficient catalysis of DNA repair via homologous recombination (27Lisby M. Rothstein R. Mortensen U.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8276-8282Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Given the domain structure of the HsRad52 protein it may be that higher order oligomers of the protein are used in promoting complex formation among repair proteins and DNA through simultaneous interaction with multiple components. Additionally, the higher order oligomers may be important for optimization of a fundamental biochemical function of Rad52,e.g. events related directly to DNA binding. Therefore, in this work we asked whether the ability of HsRad52 to perform various activities related directly to DNA binding are affected by the oligomeric state of the protein. Using two truncation mutants, HsRad52 (1–212) and HsRad52 (1–85), which block formation of higher order oligomers and the 10-nm ring structure, respectively, we show that DNA binding depends on neither ring-shaped oligomers nor higher order oligomers but that formation of oligomers consisting of multiple Rad52 rings is important for activities involving simultaneous interaction with more than one DNA molecule. A wild type RAD52 expression plasmid, pET28-wt52, was a gift from Dr. Gloria E. O. Borgstahl. Plasmids expressing HsRad52 (1–212) and HsRad52 (1–85) with a six-histidine tag fused to the C terminus were constructed using standard polymerase chain reaction techniques. Cultures of transformed BL21(DE3) Codon Plus Escherichia coli(Stratagene) were grown at 37 °C in 4.5 liters of Superbroth and induced for 2.5 h with 3 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Wild typeRAD52 cells were resuspended in T-buffer (20 mmTris (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol) with 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm imidazole. Protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 mmbenzamidine) were used throughout the purification. Cells were lysed with 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme on ice followed by sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 90 min. Polyethyleneimine (PEI) was added to this supernatant (final concentration = 0.1%) followed by centrifugation at 18,500 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was then applied to a phosphocellulose column (20 ml) equilibrated in T-buffer, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mmimidazole, and the column was washed with 4 volumes of the same buffer. Protein was eluted with T-buffer, 750 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm imidazole. Salt was reduced to 500 mm NaCl with T-buffer, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mmimidazole, and the protein was mixed with 5 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). A column was poured and washed with 10 volumes of T-buffer, 1 m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm imidazole followed by 10 volumes of T-buffer, 1m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm imidazole, and protein was eluted with 5 volumes of T-buffer, 500 mmNaCl, 500 mm imidazole, 0.1%N-dodecylmaltoside. The sample was dialyzed against T-buffer, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and mixed with 1 ml of Q-Sepharose resin. This column was washed with 10 volumes of T-buffer, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Protein was eluted with 2 ml of T-buffer, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. The protein was dialyzed and stored in T-buffer, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. Purification of HsRad52 (1–212) was the same as for the wild type protein through the PEI step. The PEI supernatant was diluted with T-buffer, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm imidazole and applied to a phosphocellulose column equilibrated in T-buffer, 200 mmNaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm imidazole. The column was washed with 4 volumes each of T-buffer, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm imidazole and T-buffer, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm imidazole. Protein was eluted with 3 volumes of T-buffer, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm imidazole. The eluent was mixed with 5 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin equilibrated in T-buffer, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mmimidazole. The column was washed with 10 volumes each of T-buffer, 1 m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm imidazole and T-buffer, 1 m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm imidazole. Protein was eluted with 5 column volumes of T-buffer, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% N-dodecylmaltoside, 500 mm imidazole. The protein was dialyzed and stored in a buffer containing T-buffer, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 200 mm(NH4)2SO4. Cells expressing HsRad52 (1–85) were resuspended in 0.25 mTris, 25% sucrose. Samples were lysed with 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme followed by sonication. The lysate was then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 90 min. The cellular membrane was resuspended in 200 ml of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 6 m guanidine-HCl, 4 mm N-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 200 mm (NH4)2SO4followed by centrifugation at 18,500 rpm for 30 min. PEI was added to 0.1% followed by centrifugation at 18,500 rpm for 30 min. This supernatant was applied to a phosphocellulose column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 6 m guanidine-HCl, 4 mm N-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 200 mm (NH4)2SO4. The column flow through was then applied to a 5-ml nickel column (Novagen). The protein was renatured by washing the column with 20 volumes of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 100 mm(NH4)2SO4. The column was washed with 5 volumes each of T-buffer, 400 mm(NH4)2SO4 and T-buffer, 600 mm (NH4)2SO4. The protein was eluted with 4 volumes of T-buffer, 200 mm(NH4)2SO4, 0.1%N-dodecylmaltoside, 50 mm EDTA. Protein samples were concentrated and stored in T-buffer, 200 mm(NH4)2SO4. Proteins were prepared for electron microscopy by diluting to concentrations indicated in Fig. 1 using a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl. Samples were spread onto thin carbon films on holey carbon grids (400 mesh), stained with 1% uranyl acetate, and visualized by transmission electron microscopy using a Philips CM10 microscope. Wild type HsRad52 (1.5 mg/ml) was loaded onto a Superose 6 HR 10/30 gel filtration column equilibrated in T-buffer, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. The 1–212 and 1–85 proteins (2.0 mg/ml) were loaded onto a Superose 6 column equilibrated in T-buffer, 200 mmNH4(SO4)2, 1 mm EDTA. Analysis was performed using a BioLogic chromatography system (Bio-Rad) with an in-line UV detector and by running samples of collected fractions on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Reactions (25 μl) contained 20 mm triethanolamine-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 nm 5′-end-labeled 54-base oligonucleotide (concentration in bases), and the indicated amounts of protein. The oligonucleotide sequence is as follows: 5′-GGC GGA GGC CAG AAG GTG TGC TAC ATT GCG GCT GCT CGG GTA ATT AAT CTG GCC-3′. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min followed by the addition of gluteraldehyde to 0.2% and continued incubation at 22 °C for 15 min. Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 1.6% (w/v), and reactions were loaded onto a 0.8% agarose gel and electrophoresed at 100 mV in 0.5× TBE buffer with 15 mmMgCl2. Gels were analyzed using a Molecular Imager FX and QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad). The 54-base oligonucleotide used in the gel shift assays was made using an ABI 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer. Reactions (20 μl) contained 20 mm triethanolamine-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 nm 5′-end-labeled 54-base oligonucleotide (concentration in bases), and the indicated amounts of protein. The oligonucleotide is the same as that used in the gel shift assays (see above). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, a 105-base oligonucleotide containing a sequence complementary to the initial 54-base oligonucleotide was added to a final concentration of 50 nm (in bases), and incubation was continued for 10 min. The sequence of the 105-base oligonucleotide is as follows: 5′-GGC CAG ATT AAT TAC CCG AGC AGC CGC AAT GTA GCA CAC CTT CTG GCC TCC GCC GAT ATC GAC AAC CTG CTG TGC TCC CAG GAT ACG GGC GAG TTA GCT TGA ACG-3′. SDS and proteinase K were added to final concentrations of 0.5% and 0.5 mg/ml, respectively, and incubation was continued at 37 °C for 15 min. Products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel using 1× TBE. Gels were analyzed using a Molecular Imager FX and QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad). Proteins were incubated with 20 μm XhoI-digested, linearized φX174 dsDNA (concentration of base pairs) in 20 mm triethanolamine-HCl (pH 7.5) for 15 min at 37 °C. To this reaction 2 μl of 10× buffer (500 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mmMgCl2, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmATP, 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) was added followed by ligase (40 units), and the incubation was continued for an additional 2 h. SDS and proteinase K were added as in the annealing reaction, and incubation was continued at 37 °C for 15 min. Products were resolved on a 0.7% agarose gel using 1× TAE buffer and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. Electron micrographs of wild type HsRad52 and HsRad52 (1–212) show that both proteins form ring-shaped oligomers with an average diameter of 10 ± 1 nm (Fig.1). At low concentrations (1.0 μm), the wild type protein can be seen to form aggregates of the ring oligomers (Fig. 1 A) whereas the 1–212 mutant shows no higher order association of the rings (Fig. 1 D). At a 4-fold higher protein concentration, wild type HsRad52 again shows higher order oligomeric structures (Fig. 1 B) that are never seen with the 1–212 mutant protein (Fig. 1 E). Higher magnification of the images in Fig. 1, B and E (Fig. 1, C and F, respectively) shows in more detail specific side-by-side associations between rings of wild type HsRad52 (see arrow, Fig. 1 C) that are never observed with the 1–212 mutant protein (see Fig. 1 F). In counting more than 500 ring-shaped oligomers for the 1–212 protein at concentrations of 1 and 4 μm, we never observed the specific side-by-side associations as shown for wild type HsRad52 in Fig. 1, B and C. The observation of higher order oligomers for wild type HsRad52 is consistent with previous electron microscopic studies (7Shinohara A. Shinohara M. Ohta T. Matsuda S. Ogawa T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 15876-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Also, the lack of higher order oligomers for the 1–212 mutant is consistent with our previous identification of a new self-association domain in the C-terminal half of the protein that is responsible for the oligomerization of the 10-nm rings (11Ranatunga W.

Together with the gel filtration data presented below and the previous work cited here, these images argue strongly that the higher order oligomeric complexes observed for wild type HsRad52 are, in fact, specific structures whose formation is mediated by the C-terminal region of the protein no longer present in the 1–212 mutant. Electron microscopic analysis of HsRad52 (1–85) revealed no observable structures (not shown), indicating that this protein does not form ring-shaped structures like the wild type and 1–212 mutant proteins. Gel filtration was used to address the oligomeric distribution of the proteins. Using a Superose 6 column wild type HsRad52 shows a peak that begins at ∼10 ml and trails to 16 ml, with a distinct center at 11 ml (Fig. 2). Given a molecular mass of 48 kDa for the His-tagged HsRad52 protein this corresponds to particles that contain from 40 to 6 monomers, with the peak center corresponding to particles containing 20 monomers. The 1–212 mutant shows a homogeneous peak centered at 16.5 ml. Given a molecular mass of 23 kDa this corresponds to a particle containing ∼10 subunits. This is in excellent agreement with recent sedimentation analysis and x-ray crystallographic studies that show an 11-subunit ring-shaped oligomer for the 1–212 protein (32Kagawa W. Kurumizaka H. Ishitani R. Fukai S. Nureki O. Shibata T. Yokoyama S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 359-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). A similar gel filtration result was also observed for the HsRad521–237 mutant protein (16Kagawa W. Kurumizaka H. Ikawa S. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35201-35208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In contrast to both wild type HsRad52 and the 1–212 mutant, the 1–85 mutant shows a very broad profile beginning at the column void (8 ml) and continuing to ∼21 ml, with a distinct peak centered at 18.5 ml. Given a molecular mass of 10 kDa this peak corresponds to a particle containing ∼3 monomers. Therefore, it appears that the 1–85 mutant self-associates in both a specific and nonspecific manner (see “Discussion”). Of course, the mobility of these proteins on a gel filtration column is dictated by the Stokes radius of the particle, not the precise particle mass, and this assay is intended as a relative size estimate of these three proteins. To compare the ssDNA binding properties of wild type HsRad52, HsRad52 (1–212), and HsRad52 (1–85), gel mobility shift assays were performed. The gels in Fig.3 are representative of five different experiments, each of which gave similar results. The apparent difference in the intensity of the three gels results from different exposure times. Scans reveal a similar radioactive content in all lanes. K Dapp was estimated from the protein concentration that gives rise to 50% of the labeled ssDNA being in the bound state, including protein-DNA complexes trapped in the gel well. Wild type HsRad52 binds with a K Dapp of ∼8 nm, and the 1–212 mutant binds with aK Dapp of ∼5 nm. Interestingly, despite the fact that the 1–85 mutant forms no ring-shaped oligomers, it still shows a reasonably high affinity for ssDNA (K Dapp of ∼50 nm). At higher protein concentrations wild type HsRad52 (120 nm) and the 1–85 mutant (80 nm) result in a majority of the ssDNA being trapped in the gel wells. In contrast, at the same higher concentrations, e.g. 60 and 120 nm, although the 1–212 protein does result in smearing of the band representing the protein-DNA complex (B), it does not result in any significant trapping of DNA in the gel wells. This likely reflects the fact that the 1–212 protein does not form higher order oligomers, whereas wild type HsRad52 forms specific higher order oligomers, and the 1–85 mutant protein may aggregate in a nonspecific manner as shown by the gel filtration (see “Discussion”). Together these results demonstrate that the N-terminal 85 residues of HsRad52 are sufficient for specific binding to ssDNA and that this function of HsRad52, although optimized by formation of ring-shaped oligomers, does not require ring formation. Both the yeast and human Rad52 proteins promote annealing of complementary strands of DNA (7Shinohara A. Shinohara M. Ohta T. Matsuda S. Ogawa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 12Mortensen U.H. Bendixen C. Sunjevaric I. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To address the functional oligomeric form of HsRad52 required for this activity, we performed the following strand annealing assay using wild type HsRad52, HsRad52 (1–212), and HsRad52 (1–85). A 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide (54 bases) was incubated with increasing concentrations of each protein followed by addition of a 105-base oligonucleotide with 54 bases complementary to the initial oligonucleotide. The data in Fig.4, A and B show that at 1 nm, wild type HsRad52 performs strand annealing very efficiently, with 76% of the labeled oligonucleotide in the double strand form compared with 10% spontaneous annealing. With increasing protein concentration the annealing efficiency decreases, and we find that at 50 nm protein the efficiency has dropped to 47%. A similar protein concentration-dependent decrease in annealing efficiency has been observed by Van Dyck et al. (17Van Dyck E. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. West S.C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) for wild type HsRad52. In contrast, increasing the concentration of the 1–212 mutant protein over the same range, from 1 to 50 nm, results in a steady increase in the efficiency of strand annealing, from 31 to 57%. Despite the fact that the ssDNA binding affinity is equivalent or slightly better than wild type HsRad52, the efficiency of annealing by the 1–212 protein is significantly less. The 1–85 mutant protein also promotes strand annealing but at a much lower efficiency than both the wild type and 1–212 proteins. Over a range of protein concentrations from 25 to 200 nm the efficiency of annealing shows a steady increase from 26 to 42%. As for ssDNA binding, these results indicate that formation of ring-shaped oligomers is not necessary for strand annealing activity by HsRad52. However, optimal annealing efficiency requires higher order complexes of HsRad52 rings. Wild type HsRad52 has been shown to increase the efficiency of DNA ligation (9Van Dyck E. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. West S.C. Nature. 1999; 398: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). To determine the oligomeric requirements for this activity we tested each protein for its ability to promote DNA ligation. Addition of ligase to dsDNA that had not been incubated with HsRad52 resulted in ∼15% of the linear dsDNA appearing as linear dimers and <0.5% appearing as multimers (Fig. 5). Preincubation of the linear dsDNA with increasing concentrations of wild type HsRad52 (from 1 to 6 μm) before addition of ligase resulted in a modest increase in the amount of linear dimers and a significant increase in the amount of multimeric ligation products. In the presence of 1 μm HsRad52 the addition of ligase resulted in ∼15% of the linear dsDNA appearing as dimers and 37% appearing as multimers, and with 6 μm HsRad52 this increased to 21% dimers and 54% multimers. When the DNA is preincubated with the 1–212 protein a similar small increase in the amount of linear dimers over the control appears at higher protein concentrations (20% linear dimers with 6 μm protein). However, in contrast to wild type HsRad52 only a very small percentage of the ligation products are multimeric (∼13%), and this is observed only at the highest protein concentration used. When the DNA is preincubated with 1–85 protein, no increase in the amount of ligation product is observed. These data suggest that formation of higher order oligomers by the HsRad52 rings is important for the promotion of DNA end-joining. These results do not necessarily imply that HsRad52 binds specifically to DNA ends, thereby promoting DNA ligation. Rather they are most simply interpreted as an increase in the local concentration of DNA ends that occurs only when the protein can form higher order oligomers of the 10-nm rings. Both the yeast and human Rad52 proteins exist in heterogeneous oligomeric states including ring-shaped multimers ∼10 nm in diameter, as well as higher order associations of these ringed structures (7Shinohara A. Shinohara M. Ohta T. Matsuda S. Ogawa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 8Van Dyck E. Hajibagheri N.M.A. Stasiak A. West S.C. J. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 15876-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the functional relevance of these different oligomeric states has not been studied. In this work we sought to correlate the oligomeric properties of the HsRad52 protein with its biochemical functions related to DNA binding that are fundamental to its role in homologous recombination. We find that although neither the higher order oligomers nor the ring-shaped structures are necessary for inherent DNA binding, both are required to efficiently promote the interaction of more than one DNA molecule. Using both electron microscopy and gel filtration we find that the 1–212 mutant protein exists in a homogeneous oligomeric state relative to wild type HsRad52 and the 1–85 mutant. Its ring-shaped appearance and size are consistent with our previous studies of a 1–192 mutant protein (11Ranatunga W. Jackson D. Lloyd J.A. Forget A.L. Knight K.L. Borgstahl G.E.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15876-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), as well as the recently solved x-ray structure of the 1–212 protein. Also, the fact that the rings formed by the wild type and 1–212 proteins have a similar diameter (Fig. 1) is explained by comparing the three-dimensional reconstruction of wild type HsRad52 performed by Stasiak et al. (10Stasiak A.Z. Larquet E. Stasiak A. Müller S. Engel A. Van Dyck E. West S.C. Egelman E.H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 120: 337-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (156) Google Scholar) (∼130 Å in diameter, ∼110 Å in height) to the crystal structure of the 1–212 protein (∼120 Å in diameter, ∼65 Å in height; see Ref. 32Kagawa W. Kurumizaka H. Ishitani R. Fukai S. Nureki O. Shibata T. Yokoyama S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 359-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This shows that the C-terminal region of HsRad52 contributes to the height of the ring and not the diameter. Importantly, our electron micrographs show that the 1–212 rings do not interact in any way to form higher order oligomeric complexes. Even at the significantly higher protein concentration used for the gel filtration experiment (∼84 μm), the 1–212 protein shows no evidence of higher order oligomeric complexes. In contrast, electron micrographs of wild type HsRad52 show clearly that the protein rings form higher order complexes even at low concentrations (1.0 μm in Fig.1 A). This demonstrates that higher order oligomers formed by wild type HsRad52 result from specific interactions mediated by the C-terminal region of the protein. For the 1–85 mutant protein, although we see no distinct structures of any kind in electron micrographs, the broad trail from 8 to 16 ml in the gel filtration profile (Fig. 2) suggests that the protein aggregates in a nonspecific manner. It may be that a surface sequestered in the full-length 418-residue wild type protein is now exposed to solvent in the 1–85 protein and promotes nonspecific self-association. The distinct peak at 18.5 ml, which approximates a complex containing three subunits, also suggests some specific interaction between the 1–85 subunits. Our gel shift assays show the ssDNA binding affinities of the wild type and 1–212 proteins to be similar, ∼8 and 5 nm, respectively. However, an important difference is that the 1–212 protein shows no protein-DNA networks that get trapped in the gel well as does wild type HsRad52. This undoubtedly is because of the fact that the 1–212 protein lacks the C-terminal self-association domain and is therefore no longer able to form higher order complexes of Rad52 rings. Although the ss DNA binding affinity of the 1–85 mutant protein is ∼10-fold lower than the wild type and 1–212 proteins, it still shows formation of specific protein-DNA complexes (b in Fig. 3) with a reasonably strong affinity (∼50 nm). Like the 1–212 protein, the 1–85 protein is also missing the C-terminal self-association domain. Therefore, the nonspecific aggregation suggested by gel filtration is likely responsible for the protein-DNA complexes trapped in the gel well. Our previous data show that another truncation mutant protein, HsRad52 (218–418), maintains native protein structure but does not bind single-stranded DNA even at concentrations up to 2.0 μm (11Ranatunga W. Jackson D. Lloyd J.A. Forget A.L. Knight K.L. Borgstahl G.E.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15876-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Together, these data show that most, if not all, of the determinants for single-stranded DNA binding lie within the N-terminal 85 residues of HsRad52 and that effective DNA binding is accomplished without formation of ring-shaped or higher order oligomers. However, because ssDNA binding affinity increases ∼10-fold for the 1–212 and wild type proteins, it is likely that the rings are the fundamental oligomeric unit required for optimal DNA binding. Interestingly, the three proteins show significant differences in their abilities to promote strand annealing and DNA ligation. At low concentrations, 1–5 nm, wild type HsRad52 increases the level of strand annealing dramatically above background. At concentrations greater than 5 nm there is an inhibition of double strand product formation. Therefore, it appears that the ability of wild type HsRad52 rings to form higher order oligomers contributes to both the increased efficiency of strand annealing at lower protein concentration and the inhibition of annealing at higher protein concentrations. In contrast, despite the fact that the DNA binding affinity of the 1–212 protein is equivalent to or slightly better than wild type Rad52, its ability to promote strand annealing is significantly less at low protein concentrations and shows no inhibition as the protein concentration increases; rather it shows a steady increase in annealing efficiency. The 1–85 protein also shows a protein concentration-dependent increase in annealing efficiency but requires higher amounts of protein to achieve an overall lower percent of double strand product, in correspondence with its lower ssDNA binding affinity. An even greater discrepancy between the activities of the three proteins is seen in the DNA ligation assay. Over the same range of protein concentration, from 1 to 6 μm, wild type Rad52 shows a steady increase in the amount of ligation product whereas the 1–212 and 1–85 proteins show little, if any, product formation. Our data support a model in which activities of Rad52 that involve binding to multiple DNA substrates require the ability of Rad52 to form higher order oligomeric complexes consisting of at least several Rad52 rings. However, are these in vitro activities relevant toin vivo Rad52 function? In fact, Lisby et al.(27Lisby M. Rothstein R. Mortensen U.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8276-8282Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) have proposed that higher order Rad52 oligomers serve an important function in initiating recombinational DNA repair. Based on the small number of Rad52 foci formed relative to the expected number of DSBs following exposure to a particular dose of γ-rays, as well asin vitro data showing that multiple Rad52 rings bind to DNA (7Shinohara A. Shinohara M. Ohta T. Matsuda S. Ogawa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 8Van Dyck E. Hajibagheri N.M.A. Stasiak A. West S.C. J. Mol.

Nature. 1999; 398: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), they proposed that aggregates of Rad52 serve to attract multiple lesions for repair within one locus, thereby serving as centers of recombinational repair. Our data is consistent with this idea. We have shown that efficient Rad52-mediated strand annealing and DNA ligation correlates with the ability to form higher order oligomers. This undoubtedly results from the ability to interact effectively with multiple pieces of DNA, an activity that may reflect an important in vivo function. Additionally, mammalian Rad52 group proteins, including Rad51, Rad52 and Rad54, co-localize following DNA damage (28Raderschall E. Golub E.I. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15895-15904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Therefore, binding of Rad52 to single- and double-stranded DNA, as well as to Rad51 and RPA, may promote and/or stabilize the joint molecules that initiate the recombination pathway. Further investigation of the DNA binding properties of Rad52, as well as its ability to interact simultaneously with several components of a repair complex, e.g. single- and double-stranded DNA, Rad51, and RPA, will be important in establishing the biochemical mechanism by which Rad52 functions to mediate homologous recombinational DNA repair.

This increase in α1-AT synthesis results in an increase in peptides, like its carboxyl-terminal C-36 peptide (C-36), resulting from α1-AT cleavage by proteases. Atherosclerosis is a form of chronic inflammation, and one of the risk factors is elevated plasma cholesterol levels. Because of the correlation between atherosclerosis, plasma cholesterol content, inflammation, and α1-AT rate of synthesis, we investigated the effect of the C-36 serpin peptide on hepatic bile acid biosynthesis. We discovered that C-36 is a powerful and specific transcriptional down-regulator of bile acid synthesis in primary rat hepatocytes, through inhibition of the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase/CYP7A1 (7α-hydroxylase) promoter. Mice injected with the C-36 peptide also showed a decrease in 7α-hydroxylase mRNA. A mutated but very similar peptide did not have any effect on 7α-hydroxylase mRNA or its promoter. The sterol 12α-hydroxylase/CYP8B1 (12α-hydroxylase) promoter is also down-regulated by the C-36 peptide in HepG2 cells but not by the mutated peptide. The DNA element involved in the C-36-mediated regulation of 7α- and 12α-hydroxylase promoters mapped to the α1-fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF) site in both promoters. The C-36 peptide prevented binding of FTF to its target DNA recognition site by direct interaction with FTF. We hypothesize that the C-36 peptide specifically interacts with FTF and induces a conformational change that results in loss of its DNA binding ability, which results in suppression of 7α- and 12α-hydroxylase transcription. These results suggest that peptides derived from specific serum proteins may alter hepatic gene expression in a highly specific manner. α1-Antitrypsin (α1-AT) is a serum protease inhibitor that is synthesized mainly in the liver, and its rate of synthesis markedly increases in response to inflammation.

At sites of inflammation, proteolytic enzymes are released by neutrophils, platelets, mast cells, macrophages, or by any invading microorganisms. Because an uncontrolled proteolytic activity would result in serious unwanted destruction of surrounding tissues, the synthesis of serpins (i.e. α1-antichymotrypsin, α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT),1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor I) is markedly increased (1Rubin H. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 632-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) to restore homeostasis. Inhibitory serpins interact with their target proteases at a reactive site located within a loop structure of 30–40 amino acid residues from the carboxyl-terminal end (2Zhou A. Carrell R.W. Huntington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27541-27547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Formation of a stable complex between α1-AT and human leukocyte elastase results from the cleavage of the P1-P′1 bond in the reactive site loop, generating a 4-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment of 36 amino acids corresponding to residues 359–394 (C-36), that remains non-covalently bound to the cleaved α1-AT in complex with the protease (3Travis J. Salvesen G.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 655-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar). This reactive site loop is also susceptible to proteolysis by non-target proteases (4Desrochers P.E. Mookhtiar K. Van Wart H.E. Hasty K.A. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5005-5012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which can give rise to the carboxyl-terminal peptide fragments of the serpin. Both of these reactions cause a loss of inhibitor activity and, in the case of α1-AT, it results in a α1-AT molecule composed of two associated chains, a long amino-terminal fragment and a 36-residue carboxyl-terminal fragment, C-36 (5Whisstock J.C. Skinner R. Carrell R.W. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 651-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This cleaved form of α1-AT has been shown to have biological activities, such as chemotatic activity (6Joslin G. Griffin G.L. August A.M. Adams S. Fallon R.J. Senior R.M. Perlmutter D.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1150-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and regulation of native α1-AT synthesis (7Joslin G. Fallon R.J. Bullock J. Adams S.P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11282-11288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations support the notion that α1-AT may also act as a reservoir of these biological activities that are released upon cleavage of the native form. α1-AT is the archetype of the serpin superfamily and the most abundant serpin in plasma (20–53 μm) and is mainly synthesized by hepatocytes. Its hepatic synthesis increases during acute phase response due to stimulation by the release of interleukin 6 (8Perlmutter D.H. May L.T. Sehgal P.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). α1-AT concentration in serum can increase up to 8-fold during inflammatory events (9Galloway M.J. Mackie M.J. McVerry B.A. Thromb. Res. 1985; 38: 311-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The α1-AT-elastase complexes are cleared from the circulation by the low density lipoprotein (LDL)-related protein receptor or the serpin-enzyme complex receptor, located mainly on the surface of the hepatocytes (7Joslin G. Fallon R.J. Bullock J. Adams S.P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11282-11288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Poller W. Willnow T.E. Hilpert J. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2841-2845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A 5-amino acid peptide within C-36 is actually recognized by the receptor (7Joslin G. Fallon R.J. Bullock J. Adams S.P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11282-11288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It should be mentioned that free C-36 carboxyl-terminal fragment and other cleavage products have been isolated from plasma, bile, and the spleen (11Johansson J. Grondal S. Sjovall J. Jornvall H. Curstedt T. FEBS Lett. 1992; 299: 146-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).The acute phase response that is triggered by infection, inflammation, and trauma is associated with changes in plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels (12Hardardottir I. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) as well as in a variety of proteins, such as α1-AT (13Mackiewicz A. Kushner I. Aldred A. G. S. Mackiewicz A. Kushner I. Baumann H. Acute Phase Proteins: Molecular Biology, Biochemistry, and Clinical Applications. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 3-37Google Scholar). Plasma cholesterol also increases albeit more moderately than plasma triglycerides (14Cabana V.G. Siegel J.N. Sabesin S.M. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 39-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, in experimentally induced acute phase in rabbits, the lipoprotein profile distribution shifts dramatically toward a more atherogenetic profile (14Cabana V.G. Siegel J.N. Sabesin S.M. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 39-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These changes in cholesterol metabolism can also be induced by the administration of lipopolysaccharide, which mimics Gram-negative infections (12Hardardottir I. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Administration of lipopolysaccharide to rodents increases plasma cholesterol levels resulting in an increase in LDL (15Feingold K.R. Hardardottir I. Memon R. Krul E.J. Moser A.H. Taylor J.M. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 2147-2158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Atherosclerosis is a form of chronic inflammation resulting from interaction between modified lipoproteins, macrophages, and other cells (for a review see Ref. 16Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). High plasma cholesterol levels are unique in being sufficient to drive the development of atherosclerosis in humans and experimental animals, even in the absence of other known risk factors, and thus cholesterol homeostasis is important. One of the pathways that play a critical role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis is the bile acid biosynthetic pathway, because nearly 50% of the body cholesterol is catabolized to bile acids. Cholesterol conversion to bile acids occurs via the “classic” (neutral) or the “alternative” (acidic) bile acid biosynthesis pathways (17Javitt N.B. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid are the end products of these pathways and the major primary bile acids found in most vertebrates. Cholic acid is hydroxylated at position 12α, whereas chenodeoxycholic acid is not. There are two enzymes that play major regulatory roles in these two pathways. Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase/CYP7A1 (7α-hydroxylase) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the classic pathway. Sterol 12α-hydroxylase/CYP8B1 (12α-hydroxylase) is the specific enzyme for cholic acid synthesis and determines the ratio of cholic acid to chenodeoxycholic acid and thus the hydrophobicity of the circulating pool. Because chenodeoxycholic acid is a more potent suppressor of HMG-CoA reductase and 7α-hydroxylase than cholic acid (18Shaw R. Elliot W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7177-7182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Heuman D.M. Hylemon P.B. Vlahcevic Z.R. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1161-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the relative activity of 12α-hydroxylase may play an important role in the regulation of hepatic cholesterol homeostasis. The alteration of cholic/chenodeoxycholic acid ratio affects biliary cholesterol and phospholipid secretion, thus altering intestinal cholesterol absorption and receptor-mediated lipoprotein uptake by the hepatocyte (19Heuman D.M. Hylemon P.B. Vlahcevic Z.R. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1161-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Recent studies have delineated many of the factors involved in the expression and regulation of these two bile acid biosynthetic enzymes. Thus, liver receptor homolog-1, also known as CYP7A promoter-binding factor, NR5A2 (20Committee N.R.N. Cell. 1999; 97: 161-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar), or α1-fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF) (Genome Data base Nomenclature Committee) (21Galarneau L. Pare J.F. Allard D. Hamel D. Levesque L. Tugwood J.D. Green S. Belanger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3853-3865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has been proposed to be required for the transcription of the 7α-hydroxylase gene (22Nitta M., Ku, S. Brown C. Okamoto A.Y. Shan B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6660-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 23del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3587-3593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bile acids activate transcription of the small heterodimer partner 1 (SHP) via binding of the hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor to its binding site in the SHP promoter. In turn, it has been proposed that SHP dimerizes with FTF and diminishes its activity on the 7α-hydroxylase promoter by mechanisms not well understood yet (24Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R. Watson M.A. McKee D.D. Moore L.B. Galardi C. Wilson J.G. Lewis M.C. Roth M.E. Maloney P.R. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Mol.

Cell. 2000; 6: 507-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar).FTF also plays a key role in the expression and in the regulation of 12α-hydroxylase (26del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17793-17799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). FTF binds to two sites within the rat 12α-hydroxylase promoter and both sites are required for both promoter activity and bile acid-mediated regulation. We have also shown that SHP is involved in the down-regulation of the 12α-hydroxylase promoter (27del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4035-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SHP in HepG2 cells suppresses 12α-hydroxylase promoter activity. We also showed that SHP prevents binding of FTF to its binding sites within the 12α-hydroxylase promoter providing a mechanism of action for the SHP-mediated suppression of 12α-hydroxylase transcription (27del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4035-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). FTF is also the target for a specific sterol regulatory binding protein 2-mediated suppression of the 12α-hydroxylase promoter (28del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6750-6757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Because of the well documented dramatic increase in α1-AT levels in response to inflammation, which in turns gives rise to an increase in peptides resulting from α1-AT cleavage by proteases and the alteration in cholesterol metabolism during the acute phase response, we have investigated whether there is a connection between the inflammatory response and cholesterol homeostasis through a specific suppression of bile acid biosynthesis by the α1-AT-derived peptide C-36. We report here that the α1-AT C-36 peptide is a powerful inhibitor of the 7α- and 12α-hydroxylase promoters by specifically interacting with FTF, a positive-acting transcription factor.DISCUSSIONThe studies presented here establish a connection between inflammation and cholesterol homeostasis. We demonstrate that a α1-AT-derived peptide (C-36) decreases bile acid synthesis in rat primary hepatocytes. We also show that this suppression, at least in part, occurs through a decrease in 7α-hydroxylase promoter activity. C-36 also decreases 7α-hydroxylase mRNA expression in injected mice. Furthermore, this suppression of promoter activity seems to occur by preventing binding of FTF to its recognition site within the 7α-hydroxylase promoter. The regulation of hepatic gene expression by a specific peptide derived from a major serum protein is a novel mechanism of transcriptional regulation.Considering that 7α-hydroxylase is the rate-limiting step of bile acid synthesis through the “classic” pathway, which is responsible for about 50% of the total bile acid output (36Vlahcevic Z.R. Eggerten G. Björkhem I. Hylemon P.B. Redford K. Pandak W.M. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 599-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the decrease of about 3-fold in bile acid biosynthesis upon incubation of primary rat hepatocytes with the α1-AT-derived peptide C-36 (Fig. 1) correlates well with an almost complete suppression (10-fold) in 7α-hydroxylase mRNA expression (Figs. 2 and 3). Additionally, the suppression of 12α-hydroxylase expression by C-36 should result in a more hydrophobic bile, which has higher suppressor potency on 7α-hydroxylase (19Heuman D.M. Hylemon P.B. Vlahcevic Z.R. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1161-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) resulting in a further suppression of 7α-hydroxylase expression and bile acid synthesis. The effect of the C-36 peptide on 7α-hydroxylase mRNA levels was highly specific, because a very similar peptide, C-35 (F → A), has no effect (Fig. 4). The mutation in the C-35 (F → A) peptide is located within the sequence that has been reported to bind to the serpin-enzyme complex receptor (7Joslin G. Fallon R.J. Bullock J. Adams S.P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11282-11288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Joslin G. Wittwer A. Adams S. Tollefsen D.M. August A. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1886-1893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to mediate neutrophil chemotaxis (6Joslin G. Griffin G.L. August A.M. Adams S. Fallon R.J. Senior R.M. Perlmutter D.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1150-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and up-regulation of α1-antitrypsin mRNA (38Perlmutter D.H. Glover G.I. Rivetna M. Schasteen C.S. Fallon R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3753-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The C-36 peptide, but not the C-35 (F → A) control peptide, also suppressed 7α-hydroxylase mRNA expression in the entire animal, suggesting that this observation made in primary hepatocytes may be physiologically significant.The C-36 peptide also suppressed expression of other genes involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism (Fig. 5), although this effect was modest as compared with the effect on 7α-hydroxylase. We speculate that this effect on HMG-CoA reductase, HMG-CoA synthase, LDL receptor, and FAS is a secondary effect due to repression of 7α-hydroxylase. A decrease in bile acid synthesis should result in higher cellular cholesterol content that in turn should decrease the levels of the mature form for the sterol regulatory element binding proteins, which are transcriptional activators of all these four genes (39Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar).The α1-AT C-36 peptide regulates 7α-hydroxylase mRNA expression at the transcriptional level, at least in part, based on our promoter studies (Fig. 7). It is still possible that other mechanisms are also involved, because the C-36 peptide regulates 7α-hydroxylase promoter activity only 2.6-fold, compared with a 10-fold regulation of 7α-hydroxylase mRNA expression. Nevertheless, the C-36 peptide not only regulates the 7α-hydroxylase promoter, but also other promoters that are dependent on FTF for their expression, such as the 12α-hydroxylase (Fig. 8) and the AFP promoters.Several lines of evidence support the notion that the C-36 peptide targets FTF to suppress bile acid biosynthesis. First, FTF is the major factor required for 7α-hydroxylase expression, because mutations within its recognition element render an inactive promoter (22Nitta M., Ku, S. Brown C. Okamoto A.Y. Shan B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6660-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), whereas mutations anywhere else in the promoter have a relatively minor effect (23del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3587-3593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A strong suppression of 7α-hydroxylase, such as the 10-fold suppression caused by C-36, should work through a factor that plays a major role in 7α-hydroxylase promoter activity, such as FTF. Second, two other promoters also dependent on FTF for its activity, the 12α-hydroxylase promoter (26del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17793-17799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8) and the AFP promoter (21Galarneau L. Pare J.F. Allard D. Hamel D. Levesque L. Tugwood J.D. Green S. Belanger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3853-3865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown), are also regulated by C-36. Third, mutations of different parts of the 7α- and 12α-hydroxylase promoters, excluding the FTF sites, have no effect on the C-36-mediated regulation of their activity. Unfortunately we could not directly test whether mutation of the FTF sites would have an effect on the C-36 regulation, because those mutations inactivate both promoters (22Nitta M., Ku, S. Brown C. Okamoto A.Y. Shan B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6660-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 26del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17793-17799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (Figs. 7 and 8).Another line of evidence that adds further support to FTF being the factor involved in the C-36-mediated suppression of bile acid synthesis came from our in vitro binding studies of FTF to its recognition sites on both the 7α- and the 12α-hydroxylase promoters (Fig. 9). FTF binding to those sites correlates with promoter activities (22Nitta M., Ku, S. Brown C. Okamoto A.Y. Shan B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6660-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 26del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17793-17799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). When we included the C-36 peptide in the binding reaction, FTF binding to both promoters dramatically decreased, and this suppression was highly specific for both the peptide and the transcription factor, because a mutant peptide, C-35 (F → A), had no effect on FTF binding to either promoter (Fig. 10). Another nuclear receptor, HNF-4α, also binds to overlapping sequences with FTF within the 12α-hydroxylase promoter, and it plays a role in basal promoter activity (27del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G.

However, the C-36 peptide had no effect on binding of HNF-4α to the 12α-hydroxylase promoter probe (Fig. 11).The C-36-mediated inhibition of FTF binding to its DNA recognition site suggests that the C-36 peptide suppresses promoter activity by preventing FTF binding to its recognition site. This data could be explained either by direct binding of the C-36 peptide to the FTF recognition site or by direct interaction between FTF and C-36. We were unable to observe binding of the C-36 to the FTF recognition site (data not shown), but we did observe physical interaction between FTF and C-36 using an ELISA assay (Fig. 12). This interaction does not require the FTF DNA binding domain, because we used a GST-FTF-(141–501) fusion protein that has its DNA binding domain deleted, which suggests that the C-36 peptide inhibits FTF activity by inducing a conformational change in its structure such that it cannot bind to its DNA recognition site. This is reminiscent of the ligand-induced conformational changes that are believed to lead to the dissociation of multiprotein complex formed between the ligand binding domain of some nuclear receptors and hsp90, hsp70, p59, and other factors (40Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6292) Google Scholar, 41Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). It should be pointed out that, although there is no known ligand for FTF, it has a ligand domain similar to other nuclear receptors located at the same relative position with respect to its DNA binding domain. This proposed mechanism of action is similar to the one proposed for the SHP-mediated suppression of 12α-hydroxylase promoter activity that is involved in the bile acid-mediated suppression of its activity (27del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4035-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Whether the C-36 peptide and SHP interact with the same FTF domain has not been determined. It should be mentioned that attempts to show differential FTF binding activity in nuclear extracts prepared from cells treated with the C-36 peptide failed (data not shown), presumably due to loss of the C-36 peptide during nuclei isolation. Interestingly, differential FTF binding has not been demonstrated in liver nuclear extracts prepared from cells treated with bile acids.The physiological role and potential significance of the C-36-mediated suppression of bile acid synthesis is unknown at this point, but it is tempting to speculate that the increase in α1-AT synthesis that occurs during the acute phase response could play a role in the development of atherosclerosis. A decrease in 7α-hydroxylase expression and bile acid synthesis should result in higher plasma cholesterol levels due to less cholesterol being removed from the body. Consistent with this, plasma levels of α1-AT are correlated with the development of both early and advanced atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries (42Hollander W. Colombo M.A. Kirkpatrick B. Paddock J. Atherosclerosis. 1979; 34: 391-405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Other studies have previously shown a down-regulation of either the classic (43Miyake J.H. Wang S.L. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21805-21808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) or the alternative (44Memon R.A. Moser A.H. Shigenaga J.K. Grunfeld C.

Further studies on the role and mechanism of action of α1-AT-derived peptides on bile acid synthesis should provide answers to these questions and perhaps support the notion that, under the inflammatory conditions associated with atherosclerosis, α1-AT may play a role not only as a protease inhibitor, but also as a reservoir of physiologically active peptide degradation products. Serine protease inhibitors (serpins) are the most common protease inhibitors in mammals and are part of the acute phase response. At sites of inflammation, proteolytic enzymes are released by neutrophils, platelets, mast cells, macrophages, or by any invading microorganisms. Because an uncontrolled proteolytic activity would result in serious unwanted destruction of surrounding tissues, the synthesis of serpins (i.e. α1-antichymotrypsin, α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT),1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor I) is markedly increased (1Rubin H. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 632-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) to restore homeostasis. Inhibitory serpins interact with their target proteases at a reactive site located within a loop structure of 30–40 amino acid residues from the carboxyl-terminal end (2Zhou A. Carrell R.W. Huntington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27541-27547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Formation of a stable complex between α1-AT and human leukocyte elastase results from the cleavage of the P1-P′1 bond in the reactive site loop, generating a 4-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment of 36 amino acids corresponding to residues 359–394 (C-36), that remains non-covalently bound to the cleaved α1-AT in complex with the protease (3Travis J. Salvesen G.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 655-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar). This reactive site loop is also susceptible to proteolysis by non-target proteases (4Desrochers P.E. Mookhtiar K. Van Wart H.E. Hasty K.A. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5005-5012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which can give rise to the carboxyl-terminal peptide fragments of the serpin. Both of these reactions cause a loss of inhibitor activity and, in the case of α1-AT, it results in a α1-AT molecule composed of two associated chains, a long amino-terminal fragment and a 36-residue carboxyl-terminal fragment, C-36 (5Whisstock J.C. Skinner R. Carrell R.W. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 651-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This cleaved form of α1-AT has been shown to have biological activities, such as chemotatic activity (6Joslin G. Griffin G.L. August A.M. Adams S. Fallon R.J. Senior R.M. Perlmutter D.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1150-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and regulation of native α1-AT synthesis (7Joslin G. Fallon R.J. Bullock J. Adams S.P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol.

AMY-1 was also found to be associated with protein kinase A anchor protein 84/149 (S-AKAP84/AKAP149) in the mitochondria in somatic cells and sperm, suggesting that it plays a role in spermatogenesis. To determine the molecular function of AMY-1, a two-hybrid screening of cDNAs encoding AMY-1-binding proteins was carried out with AMY-1 as a bait using a human testis cDNA library, and a clone encoding a novel protein, AAT-1, was obtained. Three isoforms of AAT-1, AAT-1α, -β, and -γ, were found to be derived from an alternative splicing of the transcripts of the aat-1 gene, which was mapped at human chromosome 3q13–3q21. AAT-1 was found to be specifically expressed in the testis during the course of spermatogenesis and also to be present in the spermatid and mature sperm, as was AMY-1. AAT-1α was found to bind to and be colocalized in mitochondria with AMY-1 in human HeLa and mouse GC-1 cells. Furthermore, AAT-1α was found to bind to the N-terminal half of S-AKAP84/AKAP149 in a quaternary complex with AMY-1 and a regulatory subunit (RII) of cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA), in which AAT-1α was associated with RII via S-AKAP84/AKAP149, in rat testis and HeLa cells. It was then found that AAT-1α weakly stimulated a phosphorylation activity of PKA and also that AAT-1 itself was phosphorylated by PKA in vivo and in vitro.

These results suggest that both AAT-1 and AMY-1 play roles in spermatogenesis. We have reported that AMY-1 (associate of Myc-1) bound to Myc box II in the N-proximal region of c-Myc, a transcriptional activation region of c-Myc (1Taira T. Maëda J. Onishi T. Kitaura H. Yoshida S. Kato H. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 551-567Google Scholar), and stimulated E-box-dependent transcription activity of c-Myc (1Taira T. Maëda J.

Although two mRNAs, AMY-1S and AMY-1L, which are derived from the alternative usage of poly(A) adenylation signals, encode the same protein, AMY-1, AMY-1S and AMY-1L mRNAs are strongly expressed in the testis and ubiquitously in all the tissues, respectively (1Taira T.

AMY-1 was found to be a stimulating factor for the initial step of erythrocyte differentiation of human K562 cells, suggesting that AMY-1 is a trigger of differentiation of K562 cells into erythrocyte cells and that AMY-1 has a function independent of or different from that of c-Myc (2Furusawa M. Onishi T. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 6: 339-345Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have found that AMY-1 binds to AKAP149 and its splicing variant, S-AKAP84, which is expressed in the testis and is an anchor protein of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) 1The abbreviations used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; AKAP, A-kinase anchoring protein; RII, regulatory subunit II of A-kinase; GALAD, GAL4 activation domain; PP1, protein phosphatase 1; HA, hemagglutinin; RT, reverse transcriptase; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate.

AKAP is a protein that translocates PKA to the specific sites where the individual PKA works, and more than 10 AKAPs have so far been identified (4Feliciello A. Gottesman M.E. Avvedimento E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 99-114Google Scholar, 5Lin R.Y. Moss S.B. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7804-27811Google Scholar, 6Trendelenburg G. Hummel M. Riecken E.O. Hanski C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 313-319Google Scholar). Of the identified AKAPs, S-AKAP84 and AKAP149 have been found to anchor PKA to the mitochondria to phosphorylate the target proteins in the testis and other cells, respectively. Although some target proteins to be phosphorylated by PKA in the mitochondria have been identified, the physiological significance of their phosphorylation is not clear. It has been reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins plays a key role in the acquisition of fertilization activity and that tyrosine phosphorylation is stimulated by dibutyric cAMP, 8-bromo-cAMP, or inhibitors of phosphodiesterase during fertilization (7Glantino-Homer H.L. Visconti P.E. Kopf G.S. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 56: 707-719Google Scholar, 8Leyton L. Saling P. Cell. 1989; 57: 1123-1130Google Scholar, 9Naz R.K. Ahmad K. Kumar R. J.

Moore G.D. Bailey J.L. Leclerc P. Connors S.A. Pan D. Olds- Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development. 1995; 121: 1139-1150Google Scholar). It has also been reported that an inhibitor of PKA inhibits fertilization and that an inhibitor of serine/threonine-protein phosphatase stimulates both tyrosine phosphorylation and fertilization, suggesting that PKA plays a crucial role in tyrosine-phosphorylation-mediated fertilization (8Leyton L. Saling P. Cell. 1989; 57: 1123-1130Google Scholar, 12Aitken R.J. Paterson M. Fisher H. Buckingham D.W. van Duin M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2017-2025Google Scholar, 13Leclerc P. de Lamirande E. Gagnon C. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 643-656Google Scholar). AMY-1 was found to bind in vitro and in vivo to the RII binding region of AKAP149 and S-AKAP84. AMY-1 was also found to be expressed post-meiotically in the testis, as was S-AKAP84. Furthermore, S-AKAP84 and RII, a regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, were found to make a ternary complex in cells, and AMY-1 was shown to be localized in the mitochondria of HeLa and sperm in association with AKAP149 and S-AKAP84, respectively, suggesting that the function of AMY-1 is related to spermatogenesis. The molecular mechanism of AMY-1 function, however, remains to be clarified. In this study, to elucidate the functions of AMY-1, a two-hybrid screening of cDNAs encoding AMY-1-binding proteins was carried out, and a cDNA encoding a novel protein named AAT-1 was obtained. It was found that AAT-1 was specifically expressed in the testis and located in the mitochondria. Furthermore, it was found that AAT-1 made a quaternary complex in cells with AMY-1, S-AKAP-84/AKAP149, and RII and that AAT-1 was phosphorylated by PKA, suggesting that the function of AAT-1 is related to spermatogenesis. Human NEC8 and human NEC14 were purchased from the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources, and mouse TM3, mouse TM4, and mouse GC-1 cells were purchased from American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC). All of the cells used in this study were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. For pGLex-AMY-1, AMY-1 cDNA starting from the first ATG was inserted in-frame into theEcoRI-XhoI sites of pGlex, a modified version of the LexA-derived bait vector for yeast two-hybrid screening (14Ono T. Kitaura H. Ugai H. Mutara T. Yokoyama K.K. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31145-31154Google Scholar). For pcDNA3-FLAG-AAT-1α and pcDNA3-T7-AAT-1α, AAT-1α cDNA starting from the first ATG was inserted in-frame into theEcoRI-XhoI sites of pcDNA3-FLAG and pcDNA3-T7, respectively. Plasmids of various kinds of AMY-1, S-AKAP84, and RII have been described previously (3Furusawa M. Onishi T. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36647-36651Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae L40 cells containing the lacZ gene driven by the GAL1 promoter were transformed first with pGLex-AMY-1, which did not activate lacZtranscription by itself. The transformant cells were subsequently transformed with human testis MATCHMAKER cDNA (Clontech), a cDNA library expressing the GAL4 activation domain (GALAD) fused to the cDNAs from the human testis. Approximately 5.0 × 106 colonies were screened forlacZ expression, and the results indicated the association of a GALAD-fused protein with LexA DNA-binding domain-fused AMY-1. The plasmid DNAs in the lacZ-positive cells were extracted by the procedure described in the protocols from Clontech. Nucleotide sequences of the plasmids derived from positive colonies were determined by using a Li-Cor Long Reader 4200 autosequencer. 35S-Labeled S-AKAP84 or RII was synthesized in vitro using the reticulocyte lysate of the TnT transcription/translation-coupled system (Promega). Labeled proteins were mixed with GST or GST-AAT-1α expressed in and prepared from Escherichia coli at 4 °C for 60 min in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.05% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. After washing with the same buffer, the bound proteins were separated in a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS and visualized by fluorography. Ten μg of pcDNA3-FLAG-AAT-1α together with 10 μg of pEF-AMY-1-HA was transfected into human 293T cells (60% confluent) in a 10-cm dish by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique (15Graham F.L. Vander Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Google Scholar). Forty-eight h after transfection, the whole cell extract was prepared by the procedure described previously (1Taira T. Maëda J. Onishi T. Kitaura H. Yoshida S. Kato H. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 551-567Google Scholar). Approximately 2 mg of the 293T cell proteins was first immunoprecipitated with a mouse anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma) or with nonspecific mouse IgG under the same conditions as those of thein vitro binding assay as described above. After washing with the same buffer, the precipitates were separated in a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS, blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter, and reacted with a rabbit anti-HA antibody (Y11, Santa Cruz) or with the mouse anti-FLAG antibody. Human HeLa cells were fixed with a solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde and reacted with a rabbit anti-AMY-1 polyclonal antibody synthesized against the peptide corresponding to amino acid numbers 343–370, a rabbit anti-AAT-1α antibody synthesized against the peptide corresponding to amino acid numbers 38–51, or non-immune antiserum. The cells were then reacted with a FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and observed under a fluorescent microscope. At the same time, mitochondria in the cells were stained with MitoTracker Red CM-H2Xros (Molecular Probes). Primer extension analysis was carried out using a 27-mer oligonucleotide complementary to the human aat-1gene, the nucleotide sequence of which is 5′-CAGGCGCTGTTTTTCCACCTGGCGCCG-3′. A primer labeled at the 5′ end with IRDye800 was mixed with total RNA from human testis (Clontech) and subjected to the primer extension reaction as described previously (16Haigermoser C. Fujimoto M. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3856-3857Google Scholar). The reaction products were separated on an 8% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea sequencing gel along with a sequence ladder using the same primer as that used for the dideoxy sequencing of a 5′-genomic clone. Total testis RNAs were prepared by the acid guanidine thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method, and cDNA was synthesized using the oligo(dT) primer and BcaBEST polymerase (Takara Co., Ltd.). The first strand of cDNA products was amplified with specific primers for the first 5 min at 94 °C and then for 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 55 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C. The nucleotide sequences of the sense and antisense primers wereaat-1 sense (5′-GCGAATTCGAACAAGCCAGGGCAG-3′) andaat-1 antisense (5′-GCTCGAGGCTGTTGTTCTCATT-3′). The other nucleotide sequences of the sense and antisense primers for c-myc, c-kit, acrosin, protamine-1, and β-actin were described previously (3Furusawa M. Onishi T. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36647-36651Google Scholar). The amplified products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The nucleotide sequences of the sense and antisense primers were aat-1 sense (5′-GGAGGTGGCTGTTCACCATAGTAC-3′), aat-1 antisense (5′-GTACTATGGTGAACAGCCACCTCC-3′), amy-1 sense (5′-GCCGCCGACTCGAAGCGCGAGCAG-3′), and amy-1 antisense (5′-CTGCTCGCGCTTCGAGTCGGCGGC-3′). Testes were obtained from 10-week-old male mice of the ICR strain, and sections of 8 μm in thickness were prepared by digestion of the testes with a cryostat (CM3000, Leica). The sections were mounted on poly-l-lysine-coating slides; fixed with a solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 3 m NaCl, and 0.3m sodium citrate; treated with 3 μg/ml proteinase K; dehydrated; and hybridized with 35S-labeled oligonucleotide probes for 24 h at room temperature. After the sections for theaat-1 and amy-1 genes had been autoradiographed for 60 and 21 days, respectively, they were visualized under a microscope (IX70, Olympus). Sections of testes obtained from 10-week-old male mice of the ICR strain were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then embedded in paraffin. All of the procedures for immunostaining of the sections using anti-AAT-1α or AMY-1 antibodies have been described previously (17Fujimoto M. Matsumoto K. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 1067-1075Google Scholar). To screen cDNAs encoding AMY-1-associating proteins, a full-size AMY-1 starting from amino acid number 1 was fused to the LexA-DNA-binding domain and introduced into S. cerevisiae L40 cells. A human testis cDNA library cloned in pGADGH was then introduced into the transformant yeast cells, and the colonies resistant to a His marker followed by β-galactosidase expression were selected. Among a total of 5.0 × 106 transformant cells, 37 colonies were His- and β-galactosidase-positive, and 10 of the 37 positive colonies were identified as specific clones. Two of the 10 clones were identified as c-myc, whereas 3 clones correspond to S-AKAP84, which were also cloned in the former screening using human the HeLa cDNA library (3Furusawa M. Onishi T. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36647-36651Google Scholar). Two other clones were also identified as a AKAP74/RSP3 (accession no. AF353618) and a testis-specific AKAP (accession no. XM-088671), and the sequences of cDNAs of these AKAPs have recently been deposited in the data base. One of the three novel clones, which was found to be specifically expressed in the testis, was termed AMAP-1 (18Yukitake H. Furusawa M. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 126-132Google Scholar). In the present study, we characterized one of those novel clones, no. 1, named AAT-1 (AMY-1-associating protein expressed intestis-1). The isolated AAT-1 cDNA contained 1,266 nucleotides, encoding 98 amino acids with a poly(A) stretch at the 3′-terminal end and with the perfectly matched Kozak consensus sequence (19Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Google Scholar) at the 5′-terminal end (Fig. 1 A). After an expressed sequence tag data base search, two other types of cDNA containing the same nucleotide sequences as that of the central region of the cloned AAT-1 cDNA were found and obtained from Incyte Genomics Inc. These clones contained 460 and 533 nucleotides, both of which encode the C-terminal 31 amino acids of AAT-1 with different 5′- and 3′-untranslated region from those of clones cDNA, and were found to be derived from an alternative splicing in the same gene (Fig.1 C). The former of the original isolate was named AAT-1α, and the two splicing forms were named AAT-1β and AAT-1γ (Fig.1 B). Because there was an in-frame stop codon upstream of the first methionine of the AAT-1β and AAT-1γ cDNA clones obtained, it was thought that these cDNAs encode full-size AAT-1β and AAT-1γ. Furthermore, a mouse homolog of human AAT-1α cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR using mouse testis RNA as a template, and the amino acid sequence of mouse AAT-1α was found to identical to that of human AAT-1α. There were no unique structural motifs in any of the isoforms of AAT-1. An NCBI genomic DNA data base search revealed that the humanaat-1 gene was mapped at chromosome 3q13.33–3q21.1. To determine the transcriptional initiation site (CAP site) of theaat-1 gene on the sequences of chromosome 3q13.33–3q21.1, primer extension analysis was carried out with a labeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the cDNA sequence of 16–40 using total RNA from human testis as a template. As a result, an adenine located 17 nucleotides upstream of the first nucleotide of the cloned AAT-1α cDNA was identified as the CAP site, and this A has since been fixed at +1 in the human aat-1 gene (Fig.1 C). The exon-intron structure of the human aat-1gene, consisting of 8 exons spanning ∼22 kb, was then determined (Fig. 1 D). It was found that AAT-1α were transcribed from exons 1, 2, 4, and 6–8; AAT-1β were from exons 5–7; and AAT-1γ were from exons 3, 4, and 7 (Fig. 1 D). Each protein-coding exon of human aat-1, for instance, consisted of nucleotides 65–162, and exons 7 and 8 contained the same nucleotides (Fig.1 E). The reason for and the significance of this duplication of the gene are not known. Furthermore, the nucleotide sequences of the boundaries between exons and introns followed the GT-AG rule (20Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 456-467Google Scholar) (Fig.1 E). The expression of AAT-1 mRNA was examined by Northern blot analysis in various human and mouse tissues using a probe of 1,266-base AAT-1 cDNA. In human tissues, two major mRNAs of 0.6 and 1.42 kb, which may correspond to those of AAT-1α and AAT-1β or -γ, respectively, and three minor mRNAs of 1.8, 2.5, and 4.5 kb were expressed specifically or strongly in the testis, the patterns of which were similar to those of AMY-1S except for in the placenta (Fig.2 A, i). In mouse tissues, one major mRNA of 2.5 kb and two minor mRNAs of 0.46 and 1.15 kb were also expressed specifically or strongly in the testis (Fig. 2 A, ii). Because it is difficult to detect AAT-1β and AAT-γ in Western blotting because of their very small sizes, we focused on analyses of AAT-1α in this study. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against the peptide spanning amino acid numbers 38–52 of AAT-1α, which is not present in AAT-1β and -γ, was prepared In Western blot analysis using this anti-AAT-1 antibody, protein of ∼10.8 kDa was mainly detected with some minor bands in the mouse testis, whereas actin was ubiquitously expressed (Fig.2 B, i). When an excess amount of the peptide used for immunization in rabbits was added to the reaction with the antibody, the detected signal of the 10.8-kDa protein disappeared (data not shown), indicating that the 10.8-kDa protein was endogenous AAT-1α. Western blot analyses using the anti-AAT-1α antibody were further carried out on the extracts from spermatogenesis-related tissues and cultured cells (Fig. 2 B, ii andiii, respectively). AAT-1α was detected in all of the spermatogenesis-related tissues examined, including the testis, the epithelium of cauda and corpus epididymis, and sperm from human, mouse or rat (Fig. 2 B, ii). Expression of AAT-1α was also detected in all of the cultured cells examined, including cell lines of human prostate cancer NEC18 and NEC14, mouse Leydig TM3, mouse Sertoli TM4, SV40-transformed mouse early spermatocyte GC-1, mouse embryonal testicular teratoma F9, human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562, human cervical carcinoma HeLa, adenovirus 5 transformed-human embryonal kidney 293T, and mouse cells from NIH Swiss embryo NIH3T3 (Fig. 2 B, iii). RT-PCR analysis of mRNAs was then carried out to determine the timing of expression of AAT-1 and AMY-1S during spermatogenesis using total RNAs extracted from mice testis at various days after birth (Fig.3 A). Specific primers for the amplification of mRNAs of c-kit, acrosin, and protamine-1 were used to identify the times at which the expressions of spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and spermatids started (21Florke S. Phi-van L. Muller-Esterl W. Scheuber H.P. Engel W. Differentiation. 1983; 24: 250-256Google Scholar, 22Mali P. Kaipia A. Kangasniemi M. Toppari J. Sandberg M. Hecht N.B. Parvinen M. Reprod. Fertil. Dev. 1989; 1: 369-382Google Scholar, 23Sorrentino V. Giorgi S.M. Geremia R. Besmer P. Rossi P. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 149-151Google Scholar), respectively. The results showed that expression of AAT-1 began in 1-week-old mice and gradually decreased after the expression of spermatid, during which time AMY-1 was expressed. On the other hand, c-myc was found to be expressed from the time of expression of spermatogonia. To determine in which types of cells in the testis AAT-1α and AMY-1 were expressed, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses were carried out using sections of mouse testis (Fig. 3, B and C, respectively). The results of in situ hybridization using antisense oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the nucleotide sequences of AAT-1α or AMY-1 were the same as or similar to those of immunohistochemistry using the anti-AAT-1α or AMY-1 antibody; AAT-1 was observed in cells that appeared in periods during progression from spermatogonia to spermatids (Fig. 3, B (a) andC (i)), whereas AMY-1 was observed in cells after the appearance of spermatids (Fig. 3, B (c) andC (k)). Weak expression of AAT-1α was also observed in Leydig cells (Fig. 3, B (a) andC (i)), and no cells reacted with sense oligonucleotides of AAT-1 or AMY-1 or with preimmune serum (Fig. 3,B (b and d) and C(j and l)). These results indicate that both AAT-1 and AMY-1 are expressed in spermatogenesis-related cells in the testis. To determine the AAT-1α-binding region of AMY-1, three deletion constructs fused to the GALAD were used for the two-hybrid assay with AMY-1α as a bait (Fig.4 A). Both the wild type and the N-terminal fragment spanning amino acids 1–33 of AAT-1 bound to AMY-1, and the central and the C-terminal half fragment spanning amino acids 34–66 and 67–98, respectively, of AAT-1α did not bind to AMY-1, suggesting that the N-terminal 33 amino acids present in AAT-1α contribute to the AMY-1 binding activity. As suggested by the above results, AAT-1β and AAT-1γ that correspond to the C-terminal half fragment of AAT-1α spanning amino acids 67–98 were found not to bind to AMY-1 (data not shown). An in vitro binding assay was then performed by using a35S-labeled AAT-1α synthesized in vitro with GST-AMY-1 or GST expressed in and prepared from E. coli. After GST-AMY-1 or GST trapped in glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin had been mixed with labeled proteins, the bound proteins were separated on gel and visualized by fluorography (Fig. 4 B). As in the case of binding in yeast, the full-sized AAT-1α bound to GST-AMY-1, whereas no bindings of AAT-1α to GST alone was observed (Fig.4 B, lanes 3 and 2, respectively). To observe the complex formation of AAT-1α with AMY-1 in vivo, expression vectors for FLAG-tagged AAT-1α together with HA-tagged AMY-1 were transfected into human 293T cells. Forty-eight h after transfection, cell extract was prepared and the proteins in the extract were first immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody or nonspecific IgG. The anti-FLAG antibody did precipitate FLAG-AAT-1α (Fig. 4 C, lower panel). AMY-1-HA, on the other hand, was detected in the immunoprecipitate from FLAG-tagged AAT-1α-transfected cells with an anti-HA antibody but not with IgG (Fig. 4 C, upper panel,lanes 3 and 2, respectively). These results indicate that AMY-1 is associated with AAT-1α in ectopically expressed 293T cells. To determine the cellular localization of AAT-1α, human HeLa cells were transfected with expression vectors for FLAG-tagged AAT-1α alone or together with HA-tagged AMY-1. Forty-eight h after transfection, HeLa cells were stained with anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies, and the proteins were detected by FITC- and rhodamine-conjugated second antibodies, respectively, and then visualized under a confocal laser microscope (Fig. 4 D). In HeLa cells transfected with FLAG-AAT-1α alone, AAT-1α, like AMY-1, was found to be localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4 D (i)). In HeLa cells cotransfected with FLAG-AAT-1α and AMY-1-HA, AAT-1α was found to be still localized in the cytoplasm and colocalized with AMY-1-HA, as shown by the yellow color (Fig. 4 D(ii)). To examine the cellular localization of AAT-1α in a physiological condition, human HeLa cells were stained with an anti-AAT-1α antibody (Fig. 4 E). As in the case of the ectopically transfected cells, AAT-1α was found to be localized in the cytoplasm, and no staining of cells was observed by the anti-AAT-1α antibody preabsorbed with the corresponding peptide used as an immunogen (Fig. 4 E, i, indicating that the anti-AAT-1α antibody specifically stained AAT-1α in cells. Mitochondria were also stained with MitoTracker, which gives ared color (Fig. 4 E, ii). In HeLa cells, AAT-1α (green), like AMY-1, and mitochondria (red) were co-localized as shown by the yellowcolor (Fig. 4 E, ii, Merge), and these proteins were colocalized as shown in Fig. 7 B. The same localization pattern of AAT-1α was also observed in mouse GC-1 cells, in which few AAT-1α proteins were localized in the nucleus as indicated by the staining by DAPI (Fig. 4 E, iii). The mouse sperm extracted from epididymis was then stained with the anti-AAT-1α, and the proteins were detected by FITC-conjugated second antibody. Mitochondria were also stained with MitoTracker, which gives a red color (Fig. 4 F). In sperm, AAT-1α was localized in the neck of the sperm, which was identified as mitochondria by MitoTracker staining, and these two were colocalized as shown by the yellow color (Fig. 4 F,Merge). These results indicate that AAT-1α is abona fide AMY-1-binding protein. Because we have reported that AMY-1 binds to S-AKAP84 or AKAP149 (3Furusawa M. Onishi T. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36647-36651Google Scholar), it is possible that AAT-1α is in a complex with S-AKAP84 or AKAP149. S-AKAP84 is a splicing variant of AKAP149 and contains the same amino acids spanning 1–530 as does AKAP149 (23Sorrentino V. Giorgi S.M. Geremia R. Besmer P. Rossi P. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 149-151Google Scholar). Both proteins comprise at least three domains: an anchor region, a leucine zipper-like region and an RII-binding region; and AKAP149 additionally contains an hnRNP K-homology domain (Fig.5 A, right panel). To first determine the possibility that AAT-1α binds to S-AKAP84, in vitro pull-down assays using various35S-labeled fragments of S-AKAP84 synthesized in vitro with GST-AAT-1α or GST were carried out (Fig.5 A). The results showed that the wild type, the N-terminal fragment spanning amino acids 1–253, and the N-proximal fragment spanning amino acids 31–253 of S-AKAP84 bound to GST-AAT-1α, whereas the fragments spanning amino acids 253–524, one of which lacked the RII-binding region, did not have binding activity toward GST-AAT-1α (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3, 6,9, 12, and 15 in left panel). None of the proteins were observed to bind to GST alone (Fig. 5 A, lanes 2, 5,8, 11, and 14 in left panel). These results indicate that, in contrast to the case of AMY-1, which binds to the RII-binding region of S-AKAP84, AAT-1α directly binds to the N-terminal region of S-AKAP84. To observe the complex formation of S-AKAP84 with AAT-1α in vivo, expression vectors for FLAG-tagged AAT-1α together with T7-tagged S-AKAP84 were transfected into human 293T cells. Forty-eight h after transfection, the cell extract was prepared and the proteins in the extract were first immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody or nonspecific IgG. The precipitates were immunoblotted against the anti-T7 antibody (Fig. 5 B, i). The anti-FLAG antibody did precipitate FLAG-AAT-1α (Fig. 5 B,i, lower panel). T7-S-AKAP84, on the other hand, was detected in the immunoprecipitate from transfected cells with the anti-FLAG antibody but not with IgG (Fig. 5,B, i, lanes 3 and2, respectively). To examine the binding of AAT-1α to S-AKAP84 or AKAP149 in a physiological condition, the proteins in the extracts prepared from rat testes were first immunoprecipitated with an anti-AAT-1α serum or preimmune serum. The precipitates were immunoblotted against the anti-AKAP149 antibody that recognizes both S-AKAP84 and A"
https://openalex.org/W2172200126,"Polyglutamine expansion is the cause of several neurodegenerative diseases. An in vitro model of polyglutamine-induced neuronal cell death was developed using truncated mutant huntingtin (Htt) and PC12 cells. Cell death was specifically observed in cells expressing a truncated mutant huntingtin-green fluorescence protein (GFP) fusion protein with 118 glutamine repeats (Gln118), as demonstrated by the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). To gain further insights into the mechanisms of polyglutamine expansion-induced cell death, the Affymetrix rat genome array U34A was used to investigate gene expression changes associated with polyglutamine-mediated protein aggregation and cell death. Among the up-regulated genes, the increase of four protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) was further confirmed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Protein expression of mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP1) was also increased as demonstrated by Western blot. Furthermore, phosphorylation of MAP kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) was substantially reduced in association with protein aggregation, and two general PTP inhibitors, sodium orthovanadate and bpV(pic), dramatically rescued the cells from polyglutamine-induced cell death. These results suggest that one or more of the PTPs are involved in the polyglutamine-induced cell death. Polyglutamine expansion is the cause of several neurodegenerative diseases.

A growing number of neurodegenerative diseases result from the expansion of unstable trinucleotide CAG repeats, including Huntington's disease (HD), 1The abbreviations used are: HD, Huntington's disease; Htt, huntingtin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; 118Q, Htt·GFP protein with 118 Gln repeats (Gln118); 17Q, Htt·GFP protein with Gln17; bpV(pic), dipotassium bisperoxo(picolinato)oxovanadate (V); LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; PTP, protein tyrosine kinase; RT, reverse transcription; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MKP, MAP kinase phosphatase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; NLS, nuclear localization signal; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; NGF, nerve growth factor; Dox, doxycycline 1The abbreviations used are: HD, Huntington's disease; Htt, huntingtin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; 118Q, Htt·GFP protein with 118 Gln repeats (Gln118); 17Q, Htt·GFP protein with Gln17; bpV(pic), dipotassium bisperoxo(picolinato)oxovanadate (V); LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; PTP, protein tyrosine kinase; RT, reverse transcription; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MKP, MAP kinase phosphatase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; NLS, nuclear localization signal; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; NGF, nerve growth factor; Dox, doxycyclinespinobulbar muscular atrophy, spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 6, and 7, Machado-Joseph Disease, and dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy. Because the CAG trinucleotide encodes the amino acid glutamine, these disorders are often referred to as polyglutamine diseases, although the polyglutamine expansions occur in different proteins (1Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). One of the well studied examples is HD, an inherited progressive neurological disorder caused by CAG expansion in the Htt gene (2The Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group Cell. 1993; 72: 971-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6893) Google Scholar). Although research in the past several years has revealed many important characteristics of the mutant Htt, both the biological function of normal Htt and the pathogenesis of HD are still not fully understood. Normal Htt is a ∼350 kDa cytoplasmic protein with a short polyglutamine tract at the N terminus. It has multiple predicted caspase cleavage sites and is cleaved by caspase 1 and caspase 3in vitro (3Goldberg Y.P. Nicholson D.W. Rasper D.M. Kalchman M.A. Koide H.B. Graham R.K. Bromm M.

Studies in both cell cultures and transgenic mice indicate that truncated forms of mutant Htt are more toxic than the full-length mutant protein and that the toxicity is dependent on the degree of polyglutamine expansion (6Cooper J.K.

Although the use of truncated Htt may not fully recapture the disease process initiated by full-length mutant Htt, it is still a valuable approach to dissecting biochemical mechanisms associated with polyglutamine toxicity. The mechanisms of neurodegeneration in polyglutamine diseases are not fully known. Genome-wide gene expression has been evaluated in bothin vivo (15Luthi-Carter R. Strand A. Peters N.L. Solano S.M.

A study using a small panel cDNA array showed that some genes were down-regulated and that others were significantly up-regulated in the affected brain (16Iannicola C. Moreno S. Oliverio S. Nardacci R. Ciofi-Luzzatto A. Piacentini M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 830-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). DNA microarray analysis on a PC12 cellular model of polyglutamine toxicity (17Wyttenbach A. Swartz J. Kita H. Thykjaer T. Carmichael J. Bradley J. Brown R. Maxwell M. Schapira A. Orntoft T.F. Kato K. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 15: 1829-1845Crossref Google Scholar) identified 56 genes with significant changes in mRNA expression by comparing a mutant cell line with a control cell line at one time point. Yet, the role of each gene in polyglutamine toxicity was not further investigated in any reported study. Here, stable PC12 cell lines with inducible expression of Htt·GFP·NLS were developed and characterized. In mutant cells with Gln118, designated here as 118Q cells, protein aggregates developed predominantly in the cytoplasm and perinuclear area from 16 h after induction. Cell death followed expression of Gln118 Htt·GFP but not of the Gln17 Htt·GFP as measured by LDH release. Gene expression was examined at 8, 16, and 48 h after induction in both 17Q and 118Q cells using the Affymetrix U34A rat genome array. Among the up-regulated candidates were four PTPs. Their increased expressions were confirmed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR, and the protein levels of one, MKP1, was also increased. The functional importance of these phosphatases was demonstrated using pharmacological inhibitors that increased both the levels of activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase and cell survival. The DNA of full-length huntingtin with Gln17 or Gln118repeats (kindly supplied by Dr. Jean-Louis Mandel) was digested withAvrII and BamHI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The DNA fragments containing the truncated huntingtingene (corresponding to the 304- and 405-amino acid N-terminal fragment of the control and the mutant huntingtin, respectively) were purified and ligated to PCR products of GFP·NLS (nuclear localization signal), resulting in expression constructs of Htt·GFP·NLS. The NLS primer sequences are 5′-GATCTCCAAAAAAGAAGAGAAAGGTAG-3′ and 5′-TCGACTACCTTTCTCTTCTTTTTTGGA-3′. The NLS was first added into the GFP gene between the SalI andBglII sites. To amplify the GFP·NLSgene, a primer with the BamHI site (5′-TCCGGTGGATCCCTAGCCCGCGGTAC-3′) and a primer with theAvrII site (5′-CGCCACCCTAGGTAGCAAGGG-3′) were used. The PCR program was 94 °C (30 s), 55 °C (10 s), and 72 °C (1 min) for 25 cycles. All the clones of thehuntingtin gene were transformed into Escherichia coli SURE (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) competent cells, and the transformed strains were cultured at 30 °C to reduce the instability of CAG repeats. DNA was isolated using a Qiagen (Valencia, CA) plasmid DNA purification kit. PC12 Tet-Off cells (Clontech) were co-transfected with both the pTK-Hy DNA and the expression plasmid DNA (1:10, 1 μg/well of 6-well plates) using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 7.5% defined fetal bovine serum, 7.5% horse serum, 10 mm HEPES, and 1 μg/ml doxycycline for 4 days and then subjected to G418 (500 μg/ml) and hygromycin (200 μg/ml) selection after splitting the cells. The cells were fed with fresh media every 4 days for 3–4 weeks when single colonies appeared. Each clone was tested in low serum (0.18% fetal bovine serum/horse serum, 1:1) DMEM containing 50 ng/ml NGF (Sigma) for Htt·GFP·NLS induction and neuronal differentiation in the absence of doxycycline. Clones with a higher induction of GFP fusion proteins were selected and characterized further. All images were taken on a Nikon ECLIPSE TE300 inverted microscope with an ELWD 20x/0.45 lens using an Optronics Magnafire digital camera. PC12 stable cell lines were routinely cultured in DMEM growth media (7.5% defined fetal bovine serum, 7.5% horse serum, 100 μg/ml G418, and 100 μg/ml hygromycin) with 10 ng/ml doxycycline. For cell survival assays, the cells were seeded in doxycycline-free low serum (0.18%) DMEM with NGF (50 ng/ml) at low density (5 × 103 cells/well) in 96-well plates coated with laminin and poly-l-ornithine (Sigma). The media were collected at different time points after induction, and released LDH was measured according to the manufacturer's instruction (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Sodium orthovanadate or bpV(pic) (dipotassium bisperoxo(picolinato)oxovanadate (V)) were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Stock solutions were prepared in water and stored at −20 °C. Affymetrix rat genome array U34A contains probe sets representing all known rat genes and some expressed sequence tags. For gene expression analysis on an array, the procedure recommended by Affymetrix was followed. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) and purified by RNeasy spin column (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. RNA was eluted in nuclease-free water and stored at −80 °C. The first strand of cDNA was synthesized from T7-(dT)24 primer with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Each reverse transcription reaction included 8 μg of RNA and 200 units of transcriptase in a total volume of 20 μl. After the second strand synthesis, the cDNA was phenol/chloroform extracted and ethanol precipitated. The final cDNA pellet was dissolved in 12 μl of water. Biotinylated cRNA was synthesized using the BioArray high yield RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo Diagnostics, Farmingdale, NY) and fragmented according to Affymetrix protocol. Rat U34A array was hybridized, washed, stained, and scanned using a GeneChip fluidics station 400 (Affymetrix) and a GeneArray scanner (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The data of each array were collected and initially analyzed using Microarray Suite 4.0 software. Affymetrix empirical algorithms were used at default settings for both absolute and comparison analysis. For comparison of multiple arrays, the average signal intensity of each array was scaled to 250 target intensity. For further analysis of multiple comparisons, Affymetrix MicroDB and data mining tool (version 2.0) were used. Duplicate total RNA samples were prepared from both 17Q and 118Q cells cultured for 8, 16, and 48 h in doxycycline-free medium, respectively. Each RNA sample was converted to cDNA followed by cRNA synthesis, hybridization, and chip scanning. Four-pair comparison analysis was performed to identify differentially regulated genes at 16 and 48 h, using the expression at 8 h as a baseline by Affymetrix MS4.0 software. Genes scored as increased or decreased more than three times in all four-pair comparisons were considered high confidence changes. Other genes were considered unchanged. The -fold changes under “Results” are the mean of the four-pair comparisons. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed on the ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) by monitoring the increase of fluorescence by the binding of SYBR Green to double-stranded DNA. Dissociation analysis was performed at the end of each PCR reaction to ensure there was only specific product. The PCR primers were designed with PRIMER EXPRESS software (Applied Systems) at the default setting for a small amplicon of the PCR product. The first strand cDNA template was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT) and diluted into 500 μl of water. For a 50-μl PCR, a 5-μl cDNA template was mixed with forward and reverse primers (250 nm each primer at final concentration) and 2× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The reaction was run at the default setting program (95 °C (15 s), 60 °C (1 min), 40 cycles). Gene-specific PCR was performed in triplicate on each cDNA sample. The gene-specific primers, with GenBankTM accession numbers in parentheses, were as follows: MKP1 (U02553), 5′-TGAGGACTAACCGAGTGAAG-3′, 5′-TGCGGTCAAGTCATTGTTATG-3′; MKP3 (X94185), 5′-ATCACTGGAGCCAAAACCTG-3′, 5′-GAGAAACTGAAGGAATGAGAC-3′; MKP cpg21 (AF013144), 5′-GCTTACCTCATGAAGACCAAG-3′, 5′-TTGCACGGGTATGAAATGTC-3′; and TD14 (AF077000), 5′-GAGCAAGCAGAACTTTCTGC-3′, 5′-GTCAGGTTCCGCAAAGGAAG-3′. For quantification of gene expression changes, the ΔΔCt method was used to calculate relative -fold changes normalized against the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene as described in user bulletin number 2 (Applied Biosystems). After rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed in 150 μl of FRAK buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 30 μm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm Pefabloc, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm E-64) on ice for 30 min. The lysates were then collected and homogenized by passing through a 21-gauge needle attached to a syringe. After centrifugation (20 min at 14,000 rpm), the supernatants were collected, and an aliquot was taken for protein determination by BCA assay (Pierce). Specific phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibody (catalog no. 9101) and p44/42 MAP kinase antibody (catalog no. 9102) were purchased from Cell Signaling(Beverly, MA). The MKP1 antibody was purchased from Sigma and used at 1:1000 dilution. The previous protocol (18Bozyczko-Coyne D. O'Kane T.M., Wu, Z.-L. Dobrzanski P. Murthy S. Vaught J.L. Scott R.W. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 849-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) was followed with minor modifications. In brief, samples were mixed with 5× Laemmli buffer and heated for 2 min at 95 °C. Samples of equivalent total protein (usually 10 μg) were run in NuPage Bis-Tris 10% gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk, 0.05% Tween 20, and Tris-buffered saline and then incubated with antibody diluted in 0.05% Tween 20 and Tris-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. Following three 15-min washes, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat antibody (Southern Biotech) diluted 1:10,000 in 0.05% Tween 20/Tris-buffered saline. The blots were then washed three times. Enhanced chemiluminescence was used to detect signals developed on Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences). The images were analyzed using the FOTO/ANALYST® electronic documentation system (Fotodyne, Hartland, WI) and the Gel-Pro® analyzer (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Full-length huntingtin cDNA (6Cooper J.K. Schilling G. Peters M.F. Herring W.J. Sharp A.H. Kaminsky Z. Masone J. Khan F.A. Delanoy M. Borchelt D.R. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Hum. Mol.

Constructs were generated for tetracycline-regulated expression of Htt·GFP fusion proteins with an SV40 NLS. The NLS was engineered into the 3′-end of the GFP gene before the TGA stop codon. The NLS was added to increase cellular toxicity of the Htt·GFP protein according to published reports (19Peters M.F. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Kushi J. Seaman H.C. Cooper J.K. Herring W.J. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 14: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 20Saudou F. Finkbeiner S. Devys D. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1998; 95: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). The constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Fig. 1 A). PC12 Tet-Off cells were transfected, and stable cell lines were selected. Each cell line was examined by fluorescence microscopy for the presence of the Htt·GFP protein following induction in the absence of doxycycline (Dox). Clones with a higher induction of the fusion proteins were selected for further characterization. Among the cell lines expressing the Htt·GFP·NLS, a control cell line, 17Q, and a mutant cell line, 118Q, were used in this study. Each of these cell lines had the highest expression in its group. Expression and localization of the Htt·GFP·NLS fusion proteins was examined in live cells at different time points after induction by fluorescence microscopy. Both the 17Q and 118Q stable lines exhibited evenly distributed proteins throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus at 8 h after induction (Fig.1 B). Several small protein aggregates often appeared in the cytoplasm and/or the perinuclear region in the 118Q cells and became a single large aggregate at later time points following the Htt fusion protein induction. The aggregates were present in roughly 40 and 90% of the cells at 16 and 48 h, respectively (Fig.1 B). The cellular toxicity of the mutant proteins was assessed by release of LDH at various time points after induction. Across a 4-day time course (Fig. 1 C) there was a significant increase of released LDH by 2 days after induction in the 118Q cells. Compared with the 118Q cells cultured with Dox, the LDH release in the absence of Dox was increased by more than 5- and 10-fold at 3 and 4 days, respectively. In contrast, there was no significant difference of LDH release in the 17Q cells either in the presence or absence of Dox. Furthermore, the 118Q cells had 3–4-fold increase of LDH release at the equivalent level of Htt·GFP protein expression compared with the 17Q cells (data not shown). Thus, the cell death is caused by the mutant protein and not purely by protein overexpression. Based on the time course of the mutant Htt·GFP protein localization and aggregation (see Fig. 1 B), the 118Q cells at 8, 16, and 48 h were defined as early, middle, and late stages of the polyglutamine-induced cell death, respectively. In the early stage, the cells looked similar to normal cells; therefore, the gene expression at 8 h was used as the baseline to identify gene expression changes associated with protein aggregation and cell death at the middle and late stages. The mutant cells could be rescued by adding Dox up to 24 but not 48 h after the mutant protein expression (data not shown). By including a late time point (48 h) when the cells were committed to die, patterns of gene expression important for the execution of cell death can be revealed. Among the genes with high confidence changes, there were 111 up-regulated genes at 16 h and 253 at 48 h. Among them, 86 were found at both 16 and 48 h. The number of down-regulated genes was 210 at 16h and 480 at 48h. The down-regulated genes outnumbered the up-regulated genes at a ratio of ∼2:1 at each time point. The up-regulated PTP genes in the Affymetrix U34A array analysis are summarized in Table I. There are seven GenBankTM en-tries corresponding to four PTPs (MKP1, MKP3, CPG21, and TD14). Three of them are dual specificity protein phosphatases, also known as MAP kinase phosphatases or MKPs. In the 17Q cells, only MKP1 expression was increased. In the 118Q cells, MKP1, MKP3, and MKP cpg21 were increased at both 16 and 48 h. TD14 was up-regulated at 48 h only. Compared with the 17Q cells, MKP1 was induced more than 2-fold in the 118Q cells. The -fold changes at 16 and 48 h in the 118Q cells suggested that MKP1 and MKP3 were progressively increased from 8 to 48 h. This was the period of transition from a relatively normal state to aggregate formation and cell death. MKP cpg21 demonstrated a 9-fold increase at 16 and 48 h. The increase of TD14 by 34-fold was not confirmed by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 2 A). This large increase was likely due to inappropriate calculation by the Affymetrix software, because the signal intensity at both 8 and 16 h was below zero (data not shown).Table IUp-regulation of protein tyrosine phosphatases in 17Q control and 118Q mutant cells by Affymetrix U34A array analysisGeneAccession17Q118Q16h/8h*48h/8h*16h/8h*48h/8h*MKP1S743511.72.33.55.1S81478NC1.83.34.5U02553NC3.14.98.3MKP3X94185NCNC9.716.0U42627NCNC2.64.4CPG21AF013144NCNC8.99.1TD14AF077000NCNCNC34.0Asterisk denotes -fold change. NC, no change. Open table in a new tab Asterisk denotes -fold change. NC, no change. The up-regulation of the four PTPs was further investigated by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 2 A). In the 17Q cells, expressions of MKP1 and TD14 were increased 4- and 2-fold, respectively, at both 16 h and 48 h. The -fold changes of MKP1 were about 11- and 18-fold at 16 and 48 h in the 118Q cells, much greater than in the 17Q cells. This PCR result is consistent with the Affymetrix analysis, which also shows higher MKP1 induction at 48 than that at 16 h. This pattern of increase is also shown with MKP3 and TD14, but not with MKP cpg21. Both MKP3 and MKP cpg21 were increased in the 118Q cells, but not in the 17Q cells. This is also consistent with the data obtained by Affymetrix microarray analysis. To eliminate any effect of NGF on PTP induction and ensure that up-regulation of PTPs was caused by the mutant Htt·GFP protein and not clonal variation, the two independent cell lines, 118Q and 118Q-G, were cultured in growth media without NGF before real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Following gene induction in the absence of Dox, both cell lines showed a similar increase of MKP1 at 20 and 48 h against an 8-h baseline. The absence of the Gln118 Htt·GFP protein in both of the cell lines cultured in the presence of Dox had effect on MKP1 expression (Fig. 2 B). Protein expression of MKP1 was further analyzed by Western blot. There was no detectable MKP1 in the 17Q cells following the control Htt·GFP induction up to 48 h (data not shown). In contrast, an increase of the MKP1 protein was observed in the 118Q cells from 8 to 48 h following the mutant Htt·GFP induction (Fig.3). The lack of MKP1 protein in the 17Q cells on Western blot might be due to the low level of MKP1 expression and/or the low sensitivity of the antibody. Protein expressions of MKP3, cpg21, and TD14 were not investigated because of the lack of antibody reagents. A consequence of MKP enhancement would be the suppression of MAP kinase ERK1/2 activation. The activation of ERK1/2 was examined by Western blot using a specific anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody. At 24 and 36 h, respectively, the 118Q cells demonstrated a 60 and 80% decrease of ERK1 phosphorylation and a 40 and 70% decrease of ERK2 phosphorylation compared with that observed at 14 h (Fig. 4 A). This decrease of ERK1/2 activation from 14 to 36 h was coincident with the increase of protein aggregates in the 118Q cells (Fig.1 B). In contrast, such a decrease of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was not demonstrated in the 17Q cells (Fig. 4 B). This suggests that polyglutamine expansion leads to suppression of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, addition of PTP inhibitors enhanced ERK1/2 phosphorylation at 2 μm (Fig. 4 C). The PTP inhibitors were tested for their protective effects in the mutant 118Q cells. A significant decrease in LDH release was obtained with bpV(pic) or orthovanadate at concentrations equal to and greater than 2 μm (Fig. 5). After subtraction of the basal LDH release, there was 49 and 43% protection with bpV(pic) and orthovanadate at 2 μm, respectively. A greater protection of 81 and 71% was observed with 10 μmof bpV(pic) and orthovanadate, respectively. A general serine/threonine protein phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, did not show protection in the same survival assay (data not shown). In this study, an in vitro model of polyglutamine-mediated cell death associated with truncated mutant Htt was developed in a stable PC12 cell line. The induced cell death was highly significant and easily detected by LDH assay at 3 days after induction. To gain new insights regarding molecular mechanisms possibly contributing to the polyglutamine toxicity, gene expressions were evaluated using Affymetrix rat genome array U34A. As a result, 86 genes were found to be up-regulated at 16 and 48 h following induction, coincident with mutant Htt protein aggregation. Among the 86 up-regulated genes, four PTPs were especially interesting based on their role in the regulation of the MAP kinase signaling pathway (21Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The up-regulation of the four PTPs was further confirmed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. The increase of MKP1 was demonstrated both at the levels of mRNA and protein. A recently published study (22Seta K.A. Kim R. Kim H.W. Millhorn D.E. Beitner-Johnson D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44405-44412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) using a similar approach showed that MKP1 is also induced at both the mRNA and protein levels by hypoxia in PC12 cells. MKP1, MKP3, and MKP cpg21 can be induced by oxidative stress, heat shock, and growth factors. In fact, MKP1 was first identified as an immediate early gene induced rapidly in cultured cells within 30–120 min of exposure to these agents (23Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). MKP1 expression in PC12 cells is slightly increased by agents promoting neuronal differentiation such as NGF (22Seta K.A. Kim R. Kim H.W. Millhorn D.E. Beitner-Johnson D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44405-44412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this study, the induction of MKP1 in the 118Q cells is certainly much higher in magnitude compared with the 17Q cells by both Affymetrix rat U34A array analysis and real-time PCR. Therefore, the induction of MKP1 is significantly related to the mutant Htt·GFP expression. Furthermore, the induction of all four PTPs is sustained in the progression of protein aggregation in 118Q cells. It is unclear how the polyglutamine-expanded protein affects the transcriptional control of these PTPs. Interestingly, MAP kinase p38 was suggested to play a role in the induction of MKP1 in response to stress (22Seta K.A. Kim R. Kim H.W. Millhorn D.E. Beitner-Johnson D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44405-44412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 24Li J. Gorospe M. Hutter D. Barnes J. Keyse S.M. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 21: 8213-8224Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Perhaps the p38 kinase is also responsible in part for the induction of MKP1 in this PC12 model of polyglutamine toxicity. PTPs play an important role in the regulation of MAP kinase signaling pathways, which relay, amplify, and integrate signals from a diverse range of stimuli and elicit appropriate physiological responses including proliferation, differentiation, development, inflammation, and apoptosis (21Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Among the four PTPs identified by Affymetrix genome array analysis, three of them (MKP1, MKP3, and MKP cpg21) are dual-specificity (threonine/tyrosine) enzymes. They are known to dephosphorylate MAP kinase ERK1/2 both in vitro and in vivo (23Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 25Zheng C.F. Guan K.L.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29897-29902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TD14 is not well studied but may also be involved in the regulation of MAPK signaling based on its homology to yeast protein BRO1, which is involved in the MAP kinase signaling pathway (28Cao L. Zhang L. Ruiz-Lozano P. Yang Q. Chien K.R. Graham R.M. Zhou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21077-21083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because MKPs were up-regulated in our model of polyglutamine toxicity, it was reasonable to think that the MAP kinase ERK1/2 signaling pathway would be suppressed. Decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation was observed in the 118Q cells but not the 17Q cells from 14 to 36 h after induction of the Htt·GFP. Along this line, it was recently shown that MAP kinase ERK1/2 activation was attenuated in a stable PC12 cell line expressing mutant huntingtin (29Song C. Perides G. Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6703-6707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) in response to NGF treatment. Furthermore, in our study, inhibitors of PTP significantly reversed both the cell death and the reduction in phospho-ERK 1/2 associated with the truncated mutant Htt·GFP expression. Therefore, inhibition of the MAP kinase ERK1/2 pathway mediated by increased MKPs is likely an important part of polyglutamine toxicity. Further studies will be of interest to determine the role of individual MKPs in polyglutamine toxicity. In conclusion, a cellular model of polyglutamine-induced toxicity has been developed that recapitulates some of the pathological features of protein aggregation and neuronal cell loss found in the HD brain. The presented evidence shows that MKPs may be involved in the polyglutamine-induced cell death and may serve as therapeutic targets for polyglutamine diseases.

Our data also indicate a lack of correlation between linker histone affinity and chromatin condensation. Eukaryotic chromatin is a dynamic entity exhibiting different levels of compaction, and its intrinsic flexibility entails reversible switches between decondensed and condensed states for proper transcription and replication. The histone proteins, the core histones H2A, H2B, H3, H4, and the linker histones, commonly referred to as H1, interact with DNA to form nucleosomes and higher order structures of the chromatin fiber (1Wolffe A.P. Chromatin Structure and Function. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, 1998Google Scholar). The flexibility of this interaction enables histone participation in the modulation of transcriptional activity. H1 was considered initially to be a structural protein increasing the compaction of chromatin and, in addition, mediating global silencing of gene activity (2Weintraub H. Cell. 1984; 38: 17-27Google Scholar). Although its physiological function is still an enigma, evidence has been put forward emphasizing a gene-specific regulation, mostly involving gene silencing (3Wolffe A.P. Khochbin S. Dimitrov S. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 249-255Google Scholar). The H1 isoforms have in common a tripartite protein structure. The globular domain is the most conserved part whereas the N- and C-terminal tails contain the most variation in amino acid sequence and are thus responsible for the microheterogeneity of H1 histones (4Parseghian M.H. Hamkalo B.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 289-304Google Scholar). The tails are targets for several post-translational modifications of which phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues has been the most studied. Phosphorylation has been linked to both condensation and decondensation of chromatin (5Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 93-98Google Scholar), and recent results indicate that phosphorylation of linker histones regulates gene expression in vivo by causing their partial dissociation from chromatin (6Dou Y. Mizzen C.A. Abrams M. Allis C.D. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 641-647Google Scholar). Furthermore, linker histone phosphorylation and partial dissociation may be a first step in the regulation of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes (7Horn P.J. Carruthers L.M. Logie C. Hill D.A. Solomon M.J. Wade P.A. Imbalzano A.N. Hansen J.C. Peterson C.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 263-267Google Scholar). The number of linker histone subtypes and their amino acid composition varies among species, as well as tissues (8Cole R.D. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1987; 30: 433-449Google Scholar). The isoforms differ in the timing of expression during development, in the number of phosphate groups they can accept during cell division (4Parseghian M.H. Hamkalo B.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 289-304Google Scholar), and in their ability to condense chromatin (9Nagaraja S. Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1260: 207-214Google Scholar, 10Marion C. Roche J. Roux B. Gorka C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6328-6335Google Scholar). Their association to chromatin has been shown to be selective, forming stronger bonds upon association with AT-rich sequences (8Cole R.D. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1987; 30: 433-449Google Scholar, 11Zlatanova J. van Holde K. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 889-895Google Scholar, 12Zlatanova J. van Holde K. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 52: 217-259Google Scholar). Although it appears as if each of the linker histone subtypes may have a distinct function, elimination of certain subtypes by knockout experiments shows that they are dispensable and that the remaining subtypes can compensate for the lost ones (13Khochbin S. Gene. 2001; 271: 1-12Google Scholar, 14Fan Y. Sirotkin A. Russell R.G. Ayala J. Skoultchi A.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7933-7943Google Scholar). A specific subtype, H10, has been shown to accumulate in many terminally differentiated cells, and it has been suggested that H10 may contribute to cell differentiation (15Zlatanova J. Doenecke D. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1260-1268Google Scholar). In the nucleated erythrocytes present in avian and amphibian organisms the replacement linker histones, H5 and H10, respectively, play a key function in structuring the highly condensed and inert chromatin that is representative of this type of differentiated cells. InXenopus laevis erythrocytes, a 3-fold increase in the relative content of H10 was demonstrated during erythroid maturation (16Rutledge R.G. Neelin J.M. Seligy V.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 144: 191-198Google Scholar). The binding of H1 to chromatin is mediated mainly by ionic interactions, and it is weaker than that of core histones. A well established and gentle method to follow the dissociation of H1 from chromatin is the selective extraction of H1 using salt concentrations in the range of 0.35 to 0.7 m (17Bolund L.A. Johns E.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 35: 546-553Google Scholar, 18Kumar N.M. Walker I.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 3535-3551Google Scholar). We have combined this dissociation of H1 with the use of the DNA-binding fluorochrome DAPI 1The abbreviations used are: DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; HPCE, high performance capillary electrophoresis; RP-HPLC, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography; FI, fluorescence intensity; TLCK, N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone; HPMC, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose; EGME, ethylene glycolmonomethylether; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PFA, paraformaldehyde; PCA, perchloric acid.1The abbreviations used are: DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; HPCE, high performance capillary electrophoresis; RP-HPLC, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography; FI, fluorescence intensity; TLCK, N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone; HPMC, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose; EGME, ethylene glycolmonomethylether; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PFA, paraformaldehyde; PCA, perchloric acid. to establish an indirect cytochemical method to measure the affinity of linker histones for chromatin in situ (19Loborg H. Rundquist I. Cytometry. 1997; 28: 212-219Google Scholar, 20Loborg H. Rundquist I. Cytometry. 2000; 40: 1-9Google Scholar). In the present work we have applied this cytofluorometric method to define changes in chromatin structure between mature chicken and frog erythrocytes containing different subsets and amounts of H5 and H1. To verify the dissociation of linker histones at the protein level, samples isolated at different salt concentrations were analyzed by electrophoretic and chromatographic methods. Our results show a clear difference in the affinity of linker histones to chromatin between frog and chicken erythrocytes. These results implicate that the condensation of chromatin is not mediated solely by linker histones. Other key factors interacting with chromatin may be necessary to produce the inert state of highly condensed chromatin.

For linker histone analyses frog blood was obtained from animals anesthetized with 0.25% MS-222 by heart puncture and collected into heparinized tubes. Frog liver was removed immediately after heart puncture and rinsed with frog PBS to remove blood. The cells were fixed in 4% neutral buffered paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30 min (0.5–2 × 106 cells/ml), and aliquots (150–175 μl) of the cell suspension were placed on cover glasses pretreated with 0.005% protamine sulfate. The cells were allowed to adhere to the glasses for 10 min on ice and were then kept in 4% PFA for 2–5 days. Immediately before staining the cells were washed in a Tris-NaCl buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 150 mm NaCl), pH 7.4, for 30 min, permeabilized with 40 μg/ml digitonin in Tris-NaCl buffer for 10 min, and washed again for 1 min. Unfixed chicken erythrocytes were diluted in PBS (2.68 mm KCl, 1.47 mmKH2PO4, 8.1 mmNa2HPO4, and 137 mm NaCl), and unfixed frog erythrocytes were diluted in frog PBS (1.79 mmKCl, 0.98 mm KH2PO4, 5.4 mm Na2HPO4, and 91.3 mmNaCl). Cells in suspension (0.5–2 × 106 cells/ml) were allowed to adhere to cover glasses as indicated above and were subsequently permeabilized with 40 μg/ml digitonin in Tris-NaCl buffer for 10 min. The cells were either fixed directly in 4% PFA for 2–5 days or extracted with different concentrations (0.15 to 0.75m) of NaCl in Tris-NaCl buffer for 5 min and subsequently fixed in 4% PFA for 2–5 days. The salt extraction buffer was supplemented with 1 m sucrose to prevent disruption of the cells. All preparations were performed on ice. Before staining, the cells were washed with Tris-NaCl for 30 min at room temperature. A 0.5 mm stock solution of DAPI was prepared by dissolving the dye in sterile Millipore water. The solution was stored at 4 °C and used within one month. The cells were stained with 50 nm DAPI in Tris-NaCl buffer at room temperature until equilibrium was reached (i.e. at least 1.5 h). The volume of the staining solution was large enough to maintain a constant concentration of the stain. Immediately before cytofluorometry the cover glasses were mounted on a slide with printed rings (Erie Scientific, Portsmouth, NH) that constituted thin chambers filled with DAPI stain. The fluorescence intensity (FI) of the cells was measured by image cytofluorometry, using a Nikon Microphot FXA fluorescence microscope equipped with an Ultrapix 2000 cooled CCD camera (EG & G WALLAC LSR, Cambridge, United Kingdom). The microscope was equipped with a stabilized xenon arc lamp (Osram XBO 100 W) for incident fluorescence excitation. A standard filter set for DAPI (Nikon UV-2A) was employed that included a 330–380-nm excitation filter, a dichromatic beam splitter with 50% reflection at 400 nm, and a 420-nm barrier filter. A Nikon CF Fluor objective (10×, numerical aperture = 0.5) was used for the measurements. The integrated FI of each cell within the camera frame area (1392 × 1040 pixels, intensity resolution = 8 bits/pixel) was calculated using the image-processing program Image-Pro Plus 4.0 (Media Cybernetics). The camera gain parameters were set in such a way that pixel saturation was avoided and kept constant for each series of measurements. An average background fluorescence (10–12 units/pixel) was subtracted from each image, and a threshold of 5 units was then employed to delimit the fluorescent structures before the calculation of their integrated FI. The number of cells per frame was about 50 and their mean integrated fluorescence was used for the calculations of H1 affinity. Four frames on each cover glass were analyzed, and each experiment included data from duplicate glasses, which means that about 400 cells were measured for each data point within a series of measurements. The analysis of salt extraction curves was performed as described previously (19Loborg H. Rundquist I. Cytometry. 1997; 28: 212-219Google Scholar, 20Loborg H. Rundquist I. Cytometry. 2000; 40: 1-9Google Scholar) using a least-squares curve fitting to a linker histone binding equation (18Kumar N.M. Walker I.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 3535-3551Google Scholar). The salt extraction curves were normalized using the FI after extraction with 0.15 m NaCl as 100%. The NaCl concentration required to induce a 50% increase in FI was then calculated from the fitted equation and used as a measure of an apparent average linker histone affinity for chromatin in situ. The statistical significance of differences between results was analyzed using unpaired Student's t test. Images to be used as fluorescence micrographs were obtained from the CCD camera using a Nikon CF Fluor objective (40×, numerical aperture = 0.85). The following protease inhibitors were added to all buffers used for the isolation of H1 from frog blood: aprotinin (2 μg/ml), bestatin (40 μg/ml), E-64 (2 μg/ml), leupeptin (5 μg/ml), pepstatin (5 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm), and TLCK (50 μg/ml). For isolation of H1 from chicken erythrocytes only phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) was used. After collection, frog blood was washed three times (500 ×g, 10 min, 4 °C) in frog PBS with the addition of 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Chicken blood was washed three times in Tris-HCl NaCl buffer with the addition of 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol. After washing, the cells were permeabilized in STKM buffer (250 mm sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) including 0.2% Triton X-100. Nuclei were prepared by using 10 strokes for chicken erythrocytes and five strokes for frog erythrocytes in a Dounce homogenizer. The nuclei were centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and subsequently washed once in STKM buffer without detergent. Frog liver was homogenized in 2 volumes of STKM buffer and filtrated through several layers of gauze and centrifuged at 2000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed three times in STKM buffer and then homogenized with STKM buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100 in a Dounce homogenizer. H1 was extracted from blood and liver by the addition of one volume 10% perchloric acid (PCA) and 4 volumes of 5% PCA to the nuclear suspension, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h on ice. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. H1 was recovered from the supernatant by adding 100% trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 20%. To allow precipitation, the samples were left on ice for 1 h. The sample was centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was washed once in cold acidified acetone and then once with pure acetone (12,000 ×g, 10 min, 4 °C). The protein sample was dissolved in water with 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and lyophilized. To dissociate linker histones with different concentrations of sodium chloride, the erythrocytes were permeabilized with 40 μg/ml digitonin in Tris-NaCl buffer with the addition of 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol for 10 min on ice and centrifuged at 1500 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The permeabilized cells were treated with different concentrations of sodium chloride (0.35, 0.4, 0.45, 0.5, or 0.7 m) with the addition of 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol for 5 min on ice. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. To the supernatant, 40% trichloroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 2% and left on ice for 1 h. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and 100% trichloroacetic acid was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 20% in the presence of 10 mg/ml protamine sulfate. The sample was incubated for 1 h on ice and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed with acidified and pure acetone, dissolved in water with 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and lyophilized as described above. High performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE) was performed on a Beckman system P/ACE 2100 controlled by an AT486 computer. Data collection and post-run data analyses were carried out using P/ACE and System Gold software (Beckman Instruments). The capillary cartridge used was fitted with 75-μm internal diameter fused silica of 67 cm total length (60 cm to the detector). In all experiments an untreated capillary was used. Protein samples were injected by pressure, and detection was performed by measuring UV absorption at 200 nm. Separation of H1 was performed as described (21Lindner H. Wurm M. Dirschlmayer A. Sarg B. Helliger W. Electrophoresis. 1993; 14: 480-485Google Scholar, 22Lindner H. Helliger W. Dirschlmayer A. Jaquemar M. Puschendorf B. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 467-471Google Scholar, 23Lindner H.

Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 604-610Google Scholar). Linker histones from chicken erythrocytes were analyzed in 0.1 m phosphate buffer containing 180 mm HClO4 and 0.02% HPMC, and linker histones from frog erythrocytes and frog liver were analyzed in 0.1 m phosphate buffer containing 0.02% HPMC. All runs were carried out at a constant voltage (12 kV) and at a capillary temperature of 25 °C. A 127 Solvent Module and a Model 166 UV-visible-region detector (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) were used. The effluent was monitored at 210 nm, and the peaks were recorded using Beckman System Gold software. The separation of frog linker histones was performed on a Nucleosil 300–5 C4 column (8.0-mm internal diameter × 125 mm; 5-μm particle pore size; 30-nm pore size; end-capped; Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). The lyophilized proteins were dissolved in water containing 0.2 m 2-mercaptoethanol and injected onto the column. Separation of H1 was performed as described (25Lindner H. Wesierska-Gadek J. Helliger W. Puschendorf B. Sauermann G. J. Chromatogr. 1989; 472: 243-249Google Scholar, 26Lindner H. Helliger W. Puschendorf B. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 450: 309-316Google Scholar, 27Helliger W. Lindner H. Hauptlorenz S. Puschendorf B. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 23-27Google Scholar). Briefly, linker histones from frog erythrocytes were chromatographed at a constant flow of 1.0 ml/min with a acetonitrile gradient starting at 80% (v/v) solvent A and 20% (v/v) solvent B (solvent A, water containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and 15% (v/v) EGME; solvent B, 70% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, and 15% (v/v) EGME). The concentration of solvent B was increased from 20 to 50% (v/v) in 50 min and from 50 to 100% (v/v) in 15 min. Linker histones from frog liver were fractionated as described for erythrocytes. The histone fractions were collected, and after the addition of 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol the sample was lyophilized and stored at −20 °C. H10 (∼4 μg) obtained from frog erythrocytes by RP-HPLC fractionation (see Fig. 4) was digested with α-chymotrypsin (EC 3.4.21.1) (Sigma type I-S; 1:150 (w/w)) in 20 μl of 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) for 2 h at room temperature. The peptides obtained were separated using a Nucleosil 300–5 C18 column (150 × 2-mm inner diameter; 5-μm particle pore size; end-capped; Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). Samples of ∼4 μg were injected onto the column. Chromatography was performed within 70 min at a constant flow of 75 μl/min with a two-step acetonitrile gradient starting at solvent A:solvent B ratio of 90:10 (solvent A, water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B, 85% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The concentration of solvent B was increased linearly from 10 to 45% during 65 min and from 45 to 100% during 10 min. Fractions obtained in this way were collected and, after adding 20 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol (0.2m), lyophilized. Corresponding peptide fractions were redissolved in 20 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and spotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After washing the membrane twice with 20 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid the adsorbed peptide was sequenced using an Applied Biosystems Inc. (ABI) Model 492 Procise protein sequenator. Fluorescence was confined to nuclear chromatin, and background fluorescence was low in relation to nuclear fluorescence intensity. Although extraction with sodium chloride made the cells more fragile, careful handling during the preparation steps resulted in cells that were well suited to be measured by image cytofluorometry. Nuclei in intact erythrocytes from adult animals of both avian and amphibian origin were small and showed distinct heterogeneous DAPI staining. Permeabilization using digitonin in adequate concentration is supposed to be a gentle method, only affecting the plasma membrane (28Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Google Scholar). Phase contrast microscopy showed that the erythrocytes appeared to be relatively undamaged, independently of whether they were permeabilized before or after fixation. However, for both cell types permeabilization with digitonin increased the fluorescence intensity about 2-fold and resulted in a slightly larger nucleus with a more homogeneous staining pattern. Treatment with 0.15 m NaCl after permeabilization did not result in any change in the nuclear appearance or a further increase of erythrocyte fluorescence intensity in accordance with our previous results (20Loborg H. Rundquist I. Cytometry. 2000; 40: 1-9Google Scholar). The salt concentration needed to induce a half-maximal increase in FI in chicken erythrocytes (Fig.1 A) was 0.55 ± 0.02m NaCl (n = 5), which was higher than the concentrations needed for a similar increase in other cell types studied (20Loborg H. Rundquist I. Cytometry. 2000; 40: 1-9Google Scholar). The salt concentration needed to induce the corresponding increase in FI in frog erythrocytes (Fig. 1 B) was significantly lower, 0.374 ± 0.003 m NaCl (n = 5, p < 0.001) (Fig.1 B), than in chicken erythrocytes (Fig. 1 A). Chicken erythrocytes extracted by 0.4 m NaCl (Fig.2 B) showed an appearance similar to unextracted cells (Fig. 2 A) when examined by fluorescence microscopy, in accordance with the cytofluorometry data (Fig. 1 A). At 0.7 m NaCl DAPI-stained chromatin could be observed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2 C). Frog erythrocytes showed increased FI from about 0.3 m NaCl, and no further increase was detectable after 0.55 m NaCl (Fig.1 B), in accordance with our previous results (20Loborg H. Rundquist I. Cytometry. 2000; 40: 1-9Google Scholar). Also, in accordance with the corresponding cytofluorometry data (Fig.1 B), these cells showed leakage of DAPI-stained chromatin in the cytoplasm already at 0.4 m NaCl (Fig. 2 E). The total increase in FI was somewhat higher for chicken (about 30%) than frog (about 25%) erythrocytes (Fig. 1).Figure 2Fluorescence micrographs of mature chicken (A–C) and frog (D–F) erythrocytes permeabilized with digitonin and treated with 0.15 m NaCl (A and D), 0.4 mNaCl (B and E), and 0.7m NaCl (C andF). After salt treatment the cells were fixed in 4% PFA and stained with 50 nm DAPI.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) For the simultaneous separation of all six H1 variants and the replacement histone H5 present in chicken erythrocytes, separation conditions first described by Lindner and co-workers (24Lindner H. Helliger W. Sarg B. Meraner C. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 604-610Google Scholar, 29Sarg B. Helliger W. Hoertnagl B. Puschendorf B. Lindner H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 333-339Google Scholar) were applied. Excellent separation was obtained by using a buffer containing 0.02% of the coating agent HPMC, 100 mm H3PO4, and 180 mmHClO4. In the electropherogram obtained by analyzing PCA-extracted linker histones from chicken erythrocytes, the faster migrating peaks correspond to H5 non-acetylated and acetylated variants and the slower migrating six peaks correspond to the six H1 variants (Fig 3 A). H5 represented 59 ± 8% (n = 3) of the total amount of linker histones. The dissociation of the linker histone subtypes from chicken erythrocytes was also monitored by capillary electrophoresis after extraction with 0.7 (Fig. 3 B) and 0.5 msodium chloride (Fig. 3 C). As expected, H5 exhibited a stronger association with chromatin. It dissociated mainly at sodium chloride concentrations higher than 0.5 m, and at 0.7m NaCl H5 represented 51 ± 5% (n = 3) of the total amount of linker histones. Only small amounts of H5 (7 ± 6%, n = 3) were detected at 0.5m NaCl. Analyses of frog H1 revealed some unexpected obstacles. Frog linker histones were isolated initially by applying the same PCA extraction procedure used for the chicken erythrocyte linker histones. The material obtained was, however, not well separated when analyzed with HPCE (data not shown), probably as a result of proteolysis. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as the sole protease inhibitor was not efficient enough to repress the very aggressive proteolytic enzymes present in Xenopus (30Destree O.H. D'Adelhart-Toorop H.A. Charles R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 378: 450-458Google Scholar). The combination of the protease inhibitors described under “Experimental Procedures” resulted in the least degradation and was added to all buffers used to isolate H1. However, even then, using the same separation conditions as for chicken linker histones, the separation was not satisfying (data not shown). Very broad and not base-line separated peaks were obtained. A variety of buffers were tested with similar results. Accordingly, we changed the separation method and used RP-HPLC for the separation of frog histones. With this method a clear separation of H10 and the three other H1 variants present in X. laevis was possible (Fig.4 A). After PCA extraction H10 represented 13.3 ± 4.4% (n = 2) of the total amount of linker histones. Frog erythrocytes were also extracted with 0.7 (Fig. 4 B), 0.5 (Fig. 4 C), and 0.45 m NaCl (not shown). After extraction with 0.7 m NaCl H10represented 16.6 ± 1.3% (n = 2) of the total amount of linker histones, and at 0.5 m NaCl the relative amount of H10 was 6.2 ± 2.8% (n = 2). At 0.45 m NaCl it was about 3% of the total amount of H1. A question that arose during the separation of frog erythrocyte linker histones concerned the origin of the H10 peak (Fig. 4).X. laevis has two genes encoding the two isoforms H10-1 and H10-2 (31Brocard M.P. Triebe S. Peretti M. Doenecke D. Khochbin S. Gene. 1997; 189: 127-134Google Scholar), also designated H5B and H5A (32Rutledge R.G. Neelin J.M. Seligy V.L. Gene. 1988; 70: 117-126Google Scholar). One of these isoforms has been shown to be the predominant form in erythrocytes (33Risley M.S. Eckhardt R.A. Dev. Biol. 1981; 84: 79-87Google Scholar). To our knowledge, no conclusive determination has so far been made to identify the H10 in frog erythrocytes. To characterize frog erythrocyte H10and, in addition, to investigate whether the two H10variants can be separated with RP-HPLC we analyzed H1 from frog liver, which is known to contain both H10 isoforms in nearly equal amounts (33Risley M.S. Eckhardt R.A. Dev. Biol. 1981; 84: 79-87Google Scholar). The two H10 isoforms were separated successfully (Fig. 5), and fractions from the two peaks were collected and digested with chymotrypsin. The resulting peptide fragments were separated and isolated by RP-HPLC (data not shown), and the corresponding fractions were subjected to amino acid sequence analysis for characterization."

Understanding the mechanism by which a disordered polypeptide chain folds to a unique three-dimensional structure is one of the major challenges in molecular structural biology (1Dobson C.M. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2001; 68: 1-26Google Scholar, 2Matthews C.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 653-683Google Scholar, 3Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 499-503Google Scholar, 4Arai M. Kuwajima K. Adv. Protein Chem. 2000; 53: 209-282Google Scholar). It is elucidated that folding of moderate size proteins (>10-kDa) proceeds along well defined intermediates similar to a chemical reaction (5Jackson S.E. Fold. Des. 1998; 3: R81-R91Google Scholar, 6Mosavi L.K. Williams S. Peng Z.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 165-170Google Scholar, 7Fersht A.R. Daggelt V. Cell. 2002; 108: 573-582Google Scholar, 8Liu Z.P.

Formation of partially folded intermediate states during the protein-folding process is believed to aid in avoiding search of large conformation space on the energy landscape (10Dobson C.M. Karplus M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 92-101Google Scholar, 11Burton R.E. Myers J.K. Oas T.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5337-5343Google Scholar). In addition to their role in protein folding, partially structured intermediates are proposed to be involved in a number of biological processes such as interaction with molecular chaperones, translocation across biological membranes, formation of amyloid, and dissociation of supramolecular complexes (12Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 321-331Google Scholar, 13Vander Goot F.G. Gonzalez-Manas J.M. Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Nature. 1991; 354: 408-410Google Scholar, 14Ren J. Kachel K. Kim H. Malenbaum S.E. Collier R.J. London E. Science. 1999; 28: 955-957Google Scholar). Thus, investigation of the structural features of equilibrium folding/unfolding intermediates would not only enhance our understanding of the mechanism of protein folding but is also expected to provide strong clues on the interplay of molecular forces in many natural and disease-related processes. Dynamic information about a protein on different time and length scales is important to gain useful knowledge on the mechanism of the protein folding process (15Schwartz M.P. Huang S. Matouschek A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12759-12764Google Scholar, 16Cavagnero S. Nishimura C. Schwarzinger S. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14459-14467Google Scholar, 17Alexandrescu A.T. Evans P.A. Pitkeathly M. Baum J. Dobson C.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1707-1718Google Scholar). In addition, investigation of the conformational dynamics in the partially structured state(s) can provide valuable information about the interaction potential energy landscape, which is crucial for understanding protein stability and rationalizing protein design (18Dobson C.M. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 636-640Google Scholar). In this context, NMR spectroscopy is an apt technique to probe protein folding landscape, because it provides a unique opportunity to study the conformational dynamics of unfolded, partially folded, and native state(s) at the level of individual amino acids (3Dyson H.J.

Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahami O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. Lin Hardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Google Scholar). hFGF-1 lacks secretion signal sequence (upstream of the N terminus), which is crucial for insertion and translocation across cell membrane(s) (33Jaye M. Jowk R.

Biochem. 1997; 246: 328-335Google Scholar). Hence, the mechanism by which hFGF-1 (synthesized in the cytosol) transports itself across the cell membrane to bind to its cell surface receptor is still an enigma. Wiedlocha et al. (35Wiedlocha A. Madshus I.H. Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Olsnes Z. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4835-4842Google Scholar) proposed that hFGF-1 under physiological conditions exists in a partially unfolded state, which promotes its facile transport across cell membrane. Middaugh and co-workers (36Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9913-9920Google Scholar, 37Dabora J.M. Sanyal G. Middaugh C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23637-23640Google Scholar) showed that hFGF-1 exists in a partially structured state(s) that exhibits high affinity to bind to negatively charged phospholipid vesicles. Recently, Samuel et al. (38Samuel D. Kumar T.K.S. Srimathi T. Hsieh H.C. Yu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34968-34975Google Scholar) identified and characterized an obligatory partially unfolded intermediate state in the GdnHCl unfolding pathway of hFGF-1. In the present study, we investigate the structure and dynamic features of this obligatory intermediate state of hFGF-1 using a variety of techniques including multidimensional NMR. Ingredients for Luria Broth were obtained from AMRESCO. Aprotinin, pepstatin, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Triton X-100, 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate (magnesium salt), and β-mercaptoethanol were obtained from Sigma. Guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl, ultra pure) was purchased from Merck. Heparin-Sepharose was procured from Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals used were of high quality analytical grade. Unless specified, all solutions were made in 100 mm phosphate buffer. hFGF-1 was expressed inEscherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLys bearing the recombinant plasmid pET20a. Recombinant truncated human acidic fibroblast growth factor (with 21 residues at the N terminus deleted) expressed in E. coli was purified on a heparin-Sepharose affinity column using a stepwise sodium chloride gradient (0–0.85–1.5 m). Desalting of the purified protein was achieved by ultra-filtration using an Amicon (AmershamBiosciences) set-up. The purity of the protein was assessed using SDS-PAGE. The homogeneity was confirmed by electron spray mass analysis. 15N isotope labeling was achieved using M9 minimal medium containing 100 mg/liter 15NH4Cl. The expression host strainE. coli BL21(DE3)pLys is a vitamin B1-deficient host, and hence the medium was supplemented with thiamin (vitamin B1). The protein yields were in the range of 20–25 mg/liter. Purification procedure was the same as that explained earlier (27Samuel D. Kumar T.K.S. Balamurugan K. Chin D.H. Yu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4134-4141Google Scholar). The extent of labeling was verified by electron spray mass analysis, and the isotope incorporation was found to be more than 95%. Equilibrium unfolding of hFGF-1 was monitored by fluorescence and CD measurements as a function of GdnHCl concentration. Fluorescence spectra were measured on a Hitachi F-2500 fluorimeter at 2.5 or 10 nm resolution, using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. All fluorescence measurements were made using a protein concentration of 100 μg/ml. The sample temperature was maintained at 25 °C or at different temperatures using a Neslab RTE-110 circulating water bath. CD spectra were measured using a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter. CD spectra were collected with the slit width set to 1 nm, a response time of 1 s, and a scan speed of 20 nm/min. Each spectrum was an average of at least five scans. All far UV CD measurements were made using a 0.2-cm path length quartz cuvette. The protein concentration used for the far-UV CD measurements was 50 μm. These experiments on the native and the intermediate (in 0.96 m GdnHCl) states were carried out (at 35 ± 2 °C) using trypsin. The proteolytic digestions were performed at an enzyme (trypsin) to substrate (hFGF-1) molar ratio of 1:100. The protease activity was stopped after a desired time interval by the addition of the gel loading dye (Bio-Rad) at 80 ± 2 °C. The degree of proteolytic cleavage was measured from the intensity of the ∼16-kDa band corresponding to the uncleaved protein (hFGF-1) using a densitometer. The intensity of the ∼16-kDa band (corresponding to hFGF-1) not subjected to protease treatment was considered as a control for 100% protection against trypsin cleavage. Control trypsin cleavage experiments were carried out on hen egg white lysozyme and bovine serum albumin to assess the inactivation of the enzyme (trypsin) in 0.96 m GdnHCl. The difference in the enzyme (trypsin) activity on the control proteins (hen egg white and bovine serum albumin) in the absence and presence of 0.96 mGdnHCl was negligible (<2%). Hence, no corrections were applied for enzyme activation (0.96 m GdnHCl) in the estimation of the percentage of cleavage of the protein (hFGF-1). The estimates of the percentage of cleavage of the protein (hFGF-1) in the native and the intermediate state(s) (in 0.96 m GdnHCl) represent an average of five experiments. All NMR experiments were carried out on a Bruker DMX 600 MHz spectrometer at 25 °C. An inverse probe with a self-shielded z-gradient was used to obtain all gradient-enhanced 1H-15N HSQC spectra (39Palmer III, A.G. Cavanagh J. Wright P.E. Rance R. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 93: 151-170Google Scholar). 15N decoupling during acquisition was accomplished using the GARP sequence (40Shaka A.J. Barker P.B. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 64: 547-552Google Scholar). 2048 complex data points were collected in the 1H dimension of the 1H-15N HSQC experiments. In the indirect 15N dimension of the spectra, 512 complex data points were collected. The HSQC spectra were recorded at 32 scans at all concentrations of GdnHCl. The concentration of the protein sample used was 0.2 mm in 95% H2O and 5% D2O (containing 100 mm phosphate and 100 mm ammonium sulfate). 15N chemical shifts were referenced using the consensus ratio of 0.0101329118 (41Wishart D.S. Bigami C.G. Yao J. Abidgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Google Scholar). All spectra were processed on a Silicon Graphics work station using UXNMR and Aurelia software. The GdnHCl-induced unfolding was monitored by the disappearance of the cross-peaks (that solely correspond to the native state of the protein) using the procedure reported by Van Mierloet al. (42Van Mierlo C.P.M. van Danoever J.M.P. Steensma E. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 145-157Google Scholar). Cross-peak volumes instead of cross-peak intensities were determined to avoid artifacts arising (due to line broadening effect with increase in the viscosity of the solvent) upon addition of GdnHCl. 15N longitudinal transverse relaxation and NOE data were collected on Varian Inova 500 MHz and Bruker DMX 600 MHz NMR spectrometers. Protein samples for relaxation measurements were dissolved at a concentration of ∼1.5 mm in 100 mm phosphate buffer at pH 6.0 (containing 100 mm ammonium sulfate) prepared using 10% D2O and 90% H2O. The intermediate state sample was prepared by rapidly exchanging hFGF-1 with 100 mm phosphate buffer containing 100 mm ammonium sulfate and 0.96 m GdnHCl, pH 6.0, using a Centricon ultra filtration set-up. 15N longitudinal (R1) and transverse (R2) relaxation rates and heteronuclear 1H-15N NOE were measured using two-dimensional 1H-15N correlation pulse sequences (43Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay I.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Google Scholar). For the R1 and R2 experiments, 16 and 24 scans, respectively, were collected per t 1 point, and for the 1H-15N NOE experiments, 32 scans pert 1 point were acquired. The 15N R1 and R2 values at 600 and 500 MHz were obtained using 8 delays, namely 40, 60, 140, 240, 360, 520, 720, and 1200 ms for the R1 experiment and 16.2, 32.4, 48.6, 64.8, 81, 97.2, 113.4, and 129.6 ms for the R2 experiment. The 1H-15N steady-state NOE values at 500 and 600 MHz were obtained by acquiring spectra with and without a proton presaturation period (6 s) applied before the start of the 1H-15N HSQC experiment. The NOE spectra were acquired in an interleaved manner, in which each individual FID was collected with and without proton presaturation. All spectra were processed identically on a Silicon Graphics work station using the AURELIA and UXNMR software. The peak intensities in the two-dimensional spectra were measured using the peak picking subroutine. The R1 and R2 values were determined by fitting the peak intensities as a function of the relaxation interval (t) to a two-parameter (I o and R1,2) exponential decay function, I(T) = I oexp(−R1,2 t), using a non-linear least squares analysis (44Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. veHerling W.T. Numerical Recipes in Fortran. 2nd Ed. Cambridge University Press, UK1992Google Scholar). The average uncertainty values of R1,2 were determined from three data sets. The steady-state NOE values at 500 and 600 MHz were determined form the ratios of the peak intensities with and without presaturation. The standard deviation of the NOE was determined from the root mean square value of the background noise in the spectra. In all, three separate NOE data sets were collected at both 500 and 600 MHz. Analysis of R1, R2, and NOE data followed the procedure outlined by Mandel et al.(45Mandel A.M. Akke M. Palmer III, A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 144-163Google Scholar). The native hFGF-1 was lyophilized (1.5 mm in 0.5 ml of the buffer containing 100 mm phosphate, 100 mm ammonium sulfate, pH 6.0) and dissolved in 0.5 ml of D2O, immediately prior to data collection. Sample (in the intermediate state) for the H/D exchange experiment was prepared by repeatedly exchanging the protein with buffer containing 100 mmphosphate, 100 mm ammonium sulfate, 0.96 mGdnHCl (pH 6.0), using an Amicon set-up. The sample volume was reduced to 0.5 ml, lyophilized, and redissolved in 0.5 ml of D2O just before data acquisition. 1H-15N HSQC at different time points were collected on Varian Inova 500 MHz spectrometer. The time needed to dissolve the sample and collect the first spectrum was 40 min. For the native hFGF-1, 1H-15N HSQC spectra were collected continuously for 3 days for every 40 min. Since the exchange was almost complete in 540 min, in the intermediate state, data collection was stopped after 600 min of exchange. Amide proton delays were followed by measuring peak intensities in 1H-15N HSQC spectra. The intensities of the cross-peaks in the HSQC spectra collected at various refolding times were normalized based on the peak height of the Ile-70 γ-methyl protons (at 0.2 ppm) in the one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra collected each time prior to acquiring the HSQC spectra. The time courses of change in proton occupancies were fitted to a single exponential decay (y = Aexp−kt + C, where A is the amplitude of the phase, k is the apparent exchange rate constant, and C is the final amplitude) using the Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear least squares method. All data analysis was performed using Kaleidagraph software (Synergy software). The GdnHCl-induced unfolding of hFGF-1 is non-cooperative (38Samuel D. Kumar T.K.S. Srimathi T. Hsieh H.C. Yu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34968-34975Google Scholar). GdnHCl-induced unfolding of hFGF-1 was monitored by steady-state fluorescence (based on the 350/308 nm fluorescence changes) and far UV CD (using ellipticity changes at 228 nm). These spectral probes have been shown to reliably report the gross conformational changes occurring during the unfolding of hFGF-1 (26Chi Y. Kumar T.K.S. Wang H.M. Ho M.C. Chiu I.M. Yu C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7746-7753Google Scholar, 27Samuel D. Kumar T.K.S. Balamurugan K. Chin D.H. Yu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4134-4141Google Scholar, 34Sanz J.M. Gallego G.G. Eur. J.

The GdnHCl-induced unfolding curves monitored by fluorescence and far-UV CD spectroscopy do not superimpose, implying that the unfolding process is non-cooperative, involving the accumulation of equilibrium intermediate state(s) (Fig. 2) (38Samuel D. Kumar T.K.S. Srimathi T. Hsieh H.C. Yu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34968-34975Google Scholar, 46Brandts J.F. Timasheft S.N. Fasman G.D. Structure and Stability of Biological Macromolecules.

Udgaonkar J.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1702-1713Google Scholar, 50Soulages J.L. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 484-492Google Scholar). ANS is a popular hydrophobic dye to detect folding/unfolding intermediates with solvent-exposed hydrophobic surfaces (51Semisotnov G.V. Rodionova N.A. Razgulyaev O.I. Uversky V.N. Gripas A.F. Gilmanshin R.I. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 119-128Google Scholar, 52Kuwajima K. Proteins. 1989; 6: 87-103Google Scholar). GdnHCl-induced unfolding of hFGF-1 monitored by changes in ANS fluorescence revealed that a stable equilibrium intermediate state(s) accumulates maximally at 0.96 m GdnHCl (Fig.3). The ANS emission intensity (at 520 nm) of the protein (hFGF-1) in the presence of 0.96 mGdnHCl is at least twice that observed upon binding to the protein in the native conformation (in the absence of GdnHCl). In addition, the dye (ANS) upon binding to the protein (hFGF-1) in the intermediate state shows a 30 nm blue shift in the emission maxima (Fig. 3, 520 to 490 nm). These results clearly suggest that a stable equilibrium intermediate with non-polar solvent-exposed hydrophobic surface(s) accumulates maximally in 0.96 m GdnHCl. It would be interesting to examine if the transition from the intermediate state (populated maximally in 0.96 m GdnHCl) to the denatured state(s) involves accumulation of any other equilibrium intermediates. In this context, we studied the unfolding of the 0.96 m intermediate state to the denatured state(s) using fluorescence (the 350/308 nm emission) and far-UV CD (228 nm ellipticity changes) spectroscopy. The GdnHCl-induced unfolding curves (of the protein in the intermediate state) monitored by these spectroscopic probes are superimposable implying that the transition from the intermediate state (accumulated at 0.96 m GdnHCl) to the denatured state(s) is cooperative, and no additional intermediates populate between these two states of the protein (Fig.4, panel A). Thermal denaturation of native hFGF-1 probed by fluorescence and far-UV CD reveals that the unfolding profiles obtained (using these two spectroscopic techniques) are nonsuperimposable (Fig. 4,panel B), suggesting that the unfolding of the protein proceeds via the accumulation of stable intermediate(s). The apparent Tm (temperature at which 50% of the protein molecules exist in the unfolded state(s)) values estimated from the unfolding profiles monitored by the changes in the 350/308 nm fluorescence and 228 nm ellipticity are 51 ± 0.6 and 56 ± 0.8 °C, respectively. Interestingly, thermal unfolding curves of hFGF-1 in 0.96 mGdnHCl (monitored by steady-state fluorescence and far UV CD) are nearly superimposable, indicating that no stable intermediate(s) accumulate in the temperature-induced unfolding pathway of hFGF-1 in 0.96 m GdnHCl (Fig. 4, panel C). Similar observations were made recently by Blaber et al. (53Blaber S.I. Culajay J.F. Khurana A. Blaber M. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 470-477Google Scholar), who showed that the thermal denaturation of hFGF-1 is reversible and cooperative only in the presence of low concentrations (<1m) of GdnHCl. The irreversibility of the thermal unfolding process (in the absence of low concentrations of GdnHCl) is proposed to primarily stem from the accumulation and subsequent aggregation caused due to the coalescence of the stable intermediate (53Blaber S.I. Culajay J.F. Khurana A. Blaber M. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 470-477Google Scholar). Although it is difficult to judge if the intermediate realized in 0.96 mGdnHCl shares common structural features with the one(s) accumulated in the thermal-induced unfolding pathway, it may not be far-fetched to believe that the GdnHCl and temperature-induced unfolding of hFGF-1 mandatory proceeds via the formation of intermediate state(s) possessing conformational properties resembling the native state. Although fluorescence and CD spectroscopy provide valuable data on the structural transitions occurring during the unfolding of the protein, they yield limited information on the local folding/unfolding of a protein. NMR spectroscopy on the other hand enables the study of the conformational changes in the protein at the level of individual amino acids (20Schulman B.A. Kim P.S. Dobson C.M. Redfield C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 630-634Google Scholar). 1H-15N HSQC spectrum serves as a fingerprint of the conformational state of a protein. As the 1H and 15N backbone chemical shifts of hFGF-1 are available, the conformational changes occurring in the protein at various concentrations of GdnHCl could be reliably followed at high resolution based on the 1H-15N HSQC spectra (42Van Mierlo C.P.M. van Danoever J.M.P. Steensma E. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 145-157Google Scholar). The 1H-15N HSQC spectra of hFGF-1 are well dispersed and all the expected 126 cross-peaks could be identified in the spectrum (Fig. 5, panel A). 1H-15N HSQC spectra acquired at 0.2m intervals of the denaturant reveal that only small chemical shift changes of the 1H-15N correlations of native hFGF-1 occur up to 0.4 m GdnHCl (Fig. 5, panel A). However, 1H-15N HSQC spectra acquired beyond 0.4 m GdnHCl show few new cross-peaks that could potentially correspond with an hFGF-1 intermediate or unfolded state(s) of the protein. Although the chemical shift values of most of the 1H-15N HSQC cross-peaks remain unchanged in 0.96 m GdnHCl, there is a gradual decrease in the integrals of the cross-peaks corresponding to the native conformation of the protein (Fig. 5, panel A). The observed progressive decrease in the cross-peak volume with increasing concentration of the denaturant is possibly due to the depletion of the population of the native species (as the concentration of the denaturant increases). It is pertinent to mention that all the 1H-15N HSQC spectra are corrected for the GdnHCl concentration-dependent reduction in the NMR receiver coil quality factor (42Van Mierlo C.P.M. van Danoever J.M.P. Steensma E. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 145-157Google Scholar). The spectra acquired at and beyond 1.5 m GdnHCl show limited chemical shift dispersion in the 1H dimension and is typical for an unfolded protein (Fig.5, panel A). The GdnHCl-induced unfolding at the individual amino acid residue level was monitored by the change in the 1H-15N cross-peak volume. Site-specific change(s) in cross-peak volume could be monitored for 72 of 126 HSQC cross-peaks. These cross-peaks are isolated and mostly distributed uniformly all over the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum. The profiles obtained by monitoring the change(s) in the cross-peak volume are sigmoidal and resemble typical denaturant-induced protein unfolding curves (Fig. 5). About 44 residues located in the protein show curves reminiscent of a three-state unfolding process (Fig. 5, panel B, and Table I). These residues show a prominent plateau in the GdnHCl concentration range of 0.8 to 1.0m indicative of the accumulation of a stable intermediate species (Fig. 5, panel B, and Table I). Interestingly, several other residues in the protein show unfolding curves resembling a two-state transition (Fig. 5, panel B, and Table I). The non-uniform unfolding patterns of various residues suggest that hFGF-1 undergoes non-cooperative unfolding in GdnHCl.Table IClassification of residue level unfolding profiles monitored by changes in the 1H-15N cross-peak volumes at various concentrations of GdnHClResidues showing two-state (one step) unfolding curvesL14, S17, I25, V31, H4"

The UPR, in turn, helps restore normal ER function. Since fastidious N-linked glycosylation is critical for folding of most ER proteins, this study examined whether metabolic interconversions of precursors used for glycan assembly were controlled by the UPR. Thus, eight enzymes and factors with key roles in hexose phosphate metabolism were assayed in cytoplasmic extracts from primary dermal fibroblasts treated with UPR inducers. Stimulation of only one activity by the UPR was detected, AMP-independent glycogen phosphorylase (GP). GP activation required only 20 min of ER stress, with concurrent decreases in cellular glycogen and elevations of its metabolites Glc-1-P and Glc-6-P. Addition of phosphatase inhibitors to enzyme extracts from unstressed cells mimicked the effect of ER stress on GP activity, suggesting that phosphorylation of GP or a regulatory factor was involved. These data show that the UPR can modulate hexose metabolism in a manner beneficial for protein glycosylation. Since activation of GP appears to occur by a rapid post-translational process, it may be part of a general strategy of ER damage control, preceding the well-known transcription-dependent processes of the UPR that are manifested hours after the occurrence of ER stress.

The general paradigm of ER stress signaling is termed the unfolded protein response (UPR) (1Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-356Google Scholar, 2Mori K. Cell. 2000; 101: 451-454Google Scholar, 3Ma J. Hendershot L.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 827-830Google Scholar), which can be triggered by agents that cause misfolded proteins to accumulate within the ER lumen, such as dithiothreitol (DTT), tunicamycin (TN), thapsigargin, castanospermine (CSN), and azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (AZC) (4Shang J. Koerner C. Freeze H.H. Lehrman M.A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 307-317Google Scholar). Typically, ER stress activates the stress sensors Ire1p and ATF6 (3Ma J. Hendershot L.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 827-830Google Scholar) to cause transcription of genes encoding chaperones, folding enzymes, and other proteins that enhance ER function. Appearance of the respective gene products occurs several hours after initiation of ER stress. For such ER proteins, there is no evidence that regulation by the UPR involves post-translational import or activation. Additionally, ER stress can temporarily inhibit cellular protein synthesis, lessening the load of misfolded protein entering the lumenal space. This occurs within 10–20 min of the application of ER stress by rapid post-translational phosphorylation of eIF2α by the PKR-like ER kinase or PERK (5Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Google Scholar). Translation arrest is reversible (for example, lasting 2 h in fibroblasts, Ref. 4Shang J. Koerner C. Freeze H.H. Lehrman M.A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 307-317Google Scholar), allowing the subsequent translation of mRNAs encoded by UPR-responsive genes. Previous studies from this laboratory with primary dermal fibroblasts identified another rapid effect of the UPR, involvingN-linked glycosylation of ER proteins (4Shang J. Koerner C. Freeze H.H. Lehrman M.A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 307-317Google Scholar, 6Doerrler W.T. Lehrman M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13050-13055Google Scholar). ER quality control is highly dependent upon covalent attachment of the oligosaccharide Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 to specific asparaginyl residues of nascent ER proteins. This requires the synthesis of a lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO), Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol. TN is a specific inhibitor of the synthesis of this LLO and, as a result, its application with cells causes ER protein misfolding and ER stress. Conditions that cause accumulation of premature LLO intermediates also result in ER stress (7Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8623-8626Google Scholar). However, it was found that the UPR can compensate by promoting extension of such premature LLOs to Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol (6Doerrler W.T. Lehrman M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13050-13055Google Scholar). Of particular interest is DTT-induced stress, which stimulates LLO synthesis within 20 min, and is attenuated by adaptation of cells to ER stress (4Shang J. Koerner C. Freeze H.H. Lehrman M.A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 307-317Google Scholar). This suggests a form of stress relief in which one or more components of the pre-existing pathway for generation of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol is activated post-translationally, rather than being synthesized de novo. No evidence was obtained for UPR activation of hexose transport or transferases involved in synthesis of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol (6Doerrler W.T. Lehrman M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13050-13055Google Scholar). Since multiple undermannosylated intermediates (Man2–5GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol) were all extended by the UPR, it is feasible that the UPR acts by increasing synthesis of one or more precursors of the mannosyl residues. In this study we present evidence that AMP-independent glycogen phosphorylase (GP) can mediate enhanced LLO extension by the UPR. Activation of GP is rapid, and may be part of a general program of ER damage control that precedes transcriptional events regulated by the UPR. Human dermal fibroblasts, obtained from various sources (see below, Table II), were cultured and subjected to ER stress with DTT, TN, CSN, or AZC as described (6Doerrler W.T. Lehrman M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13050-13055Google Scholar). Cells were cultured continuously in medium containing 5 mm glucose in all experiments presented. To verify the effects of UPR inducing treatments (except TN) on LLO synthesis, controls (not shown) were performed with cells labeled with 40 μCi/ml [2-3H]mannose, in which case a 20-min incubation with medium containing 0.5 mm glucose was used. [3H]LLOs were extracted with chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:3), and [3H]oligosaccharides were released from dolichol-P-P and analyzed by HPLC as described (6Doerrler W.T. Lehrman M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13050-13055Google Scholar).Table IIEffects of DTT- and TN-induced ER stress on 5′-AMP-dependent and -independent glycogen phosphorylase activities in primary dermal fibroblastsFibroblast cultures:−AMP+AMPControlDTTTNControlDTTTNunits/min/mg prot. ± S.E.% control% controlunits/min/mg prot. ± S.E.% control% controlAdultCRL-19040.080 ± 0.005188 ± 27204 ± 230.299 ± 0.015110 ± 9100 ± 3(n = 8)(n = 6)(n = 4)bTN-treated CRL-1904 cultures had a set of controls (n = 6) different than those for DTT, with average activities of 0.082 ± 0.006 (−AMP) and 0.278 ± 0.006 (+AMP).(n = 8)(n = 6)(n = 4)bTN-treated CRL-1904 cultures had a set of controls (n = 6) different than those for DTT, with average activities of 0.082 ± 0.006 (−AMP) and 0.278 ± 0.006 (+AMP).CRL-18920.075 ± 0.003140 ± 9188 ± 200.200 ± 0.011113 ± 7137 ± 9(n = 7)(n = 5)(n = 5)(n = 7)(n = 5)(n = 5)CRL-19870.068 ± 0.0071391700.192 ± 0.006122135(n = 2)(n = 1)(n = 1)(n = 2)(n = 1)(n = 1)F-120.066 ± 0.008134 ± 6NDcNot determined.0.170 ± 0.01390 ± 4ND(n = 2)(n = 2)(n = 2)(n = 2)F21–30.068 ± 0.003152 ± 8ND0.178 ± 0.002109 ± 3ND(n = 2)(n = 2)(n = 2)(n = 2)PediatricaCRL-7514: 4-year-old Caucasian male, neuroblastoma.

Cell monolayers were treated with streptolysin-O (SLO (Murex brand, distributed by Corgenix, UK)) to selectively permeabilize the plasma membranes as described (8Martys J.L. Shevell T. McGraw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25976-25984Google Scholar, 9Anand M. Rush J.S. Ray S. Doucey M.A. Weik J. Ware F.E. Hofsteenge J. Waechter C.J. Lehrman M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 487-501Google Scholar), allowing collection of diffusable cytoplasmic components with minimal physical perturbation or organelle breakage. Each 100-mm dish contained ∼1 × 106 cells. After treatment with SLO on ice for 4 min, unbound SLO was removed by washing the monolayers with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. 2 ml of modified transport buffer (containing 78 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.4, but lacking DTT as originally formulated, Ref. 8Martys J.L. Shevell T. McGraw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25976-25984Google Scholar) prewarmed to 37 °C were added. After 15 min at 37 degrees, the dishes were placed on ice for an additional 5 min. The buffer was collected and used for measurements of hexose-metabolizing enzymes. Protein was measured with a dye binding assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Comparisons of extracts made this way with extracts made with 1% Triton X-100 showed that Triton X-100 recovered 5–6 times as much protein, but a similar amount of total GP (not shown). The various stress treatments described in this study did not influence the amount of total protein recovered in cytoplasmic extracts. Assays were linear over the incubation periods indicated. Except for PFK, all enzymes in 0.2 ml of cytoplasmic extract were assayed in 1 ml of buffer containing 50 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.2, 25 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2, reactions were performed in the presence of 1.5 units of glucose-6-P dehydrogenase (Sigma, catalog number G8529) and 0.2 mm NADP+ (Sigma, catalog number N0505), and product was assessed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm for the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH, as described (10Van Schaftingen E. Jaeken J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 318-320Google Scholar). Except for PFK, the incubation times at 37 °C, and other reaction components, are indicated below for each enzyme. In all cases, assay values with blank reactions lacking the enzyme substrate were subtracted out. All data were normalized to protein content. Hexokinase: reactions were incubated for 15 min with 1 mm d-glucose and 1 mm Mg-ATP. Phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI): reactions were incubated for 15 min with 1 mm fructose 6-phosphate. Phosphomannose isomerase (PMI): reactions were incubated for 2 h with 1 mm mannose 6-phosphate and 7.13 units PGI (Sigma, catalog number P5381). Phosphomannomutase (PMM): reactions were incubated for 2 h with 0.8 mm mannose 1-phosphate, 0.1 mm glucose 1,6-bisphosphate, 0.35 units PMI (Sigma P5153), and 7.13 units of PGI. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase: reactions were incubated for 15 min with 10 μm fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and 7.13 units of PGI. Phosphofructokinase (PFK): 0.2 ml of extract was mixed with 1 ml of buffer containing 1 mm fructose 6-phosphate, 0 or 1 mm Mg-ATP, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm Na3EDTA, 6 mm MgCl2,0.16 mm NADH, 0.4 units of aldolase (Roche Diagnostics cat. 102652), 2.4 units of triose-phosphate isomerase (Roche Diagnostics cat. 109762), and 0.4 units of α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (Roche Diagnostics cat. 127752), and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The ATP-dependent formation of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate was determined with an enzyme-linked method (11Furuya E. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7109-7112Google Scholar). Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (or similar activators) was measured by activation of PFK as described (12Van Schaftingen E. Lederer B. Bartrons R. Hers H.-G. Eur J Biochem. 1982; 129: 191-195Google Scholar,13Uyeda K. Furuya E. Luby L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8394-8399Google Scholar). Rabbit muscle PFK (Sigma cat. F2129) and PFK in extracts from control and stressed cells were tested. Activators were obtained by alkaline extraction as follows. 100-mm dishes were placed on ice and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline twice. 1 ml of 0.1m NaOH (ice-cold) was added, and cells were scraped, transferred to a glass tube, and sonicated for 20 s. The mixture was heated at 80 degrees for 5 min. Samples were cooled on ice and centrifuged for 20 min at 14,900 rpm in a microcentrifuge. The supernatants were neutralized using 1 m HEPES (free acid) and added to PFK assays. In our hands, PFK was activated 2–3-fold by extracts from control cells. Extracts prepared by SLO permeabilization (see above) were assayed for GP activity (14Robson R.L. Morris J.G. Biochem. J. 1974; 144: 513-517Google Scholar). A 0.2-ml extract was diluted into 1 ml of assay buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 2 mm MgSO4, 1–2 mmNADP+, 2 μg/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 3 units/ml rabbit muscle PGM, and 3 μm glucose 1,6-bisphosphate. When indicated, 5 mm 5′-AMP was included. The reaction was initiated by adding 100 μl of 10 mg/ml glycogen (Sigma cat. G1508). GP activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm over a period of 5 h at 37 °C, and values for blank reactions lacking extract were routinely subtracted out. Over this period assays were linear for both time and amount of extract. The reaction was strictly dependent upon the presence of glycogen, PGM, and orthophosphate (not shown). Data presented for GP activity in the presence of AMP represent the total activity measured, without subtraction of activity obtained in the absence of AMP. Cellular alkaline extracts containing hexose phosphates (see above) were used. Since some hexose phosphates can be modified by alkali, key results were corroborated (not shown) with 70% ethanol extracts. Assays (1 ml) included 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mmNADP+, and 0.2 ml of extract. 2 μg/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Sigma G7877) was added, and absorbance at 340 nm was measured after 15 min. Controls performed in the absence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were subtracted out. Cell monolayers were extracted by scraping into 70% ethanol. The extract was clarified by centrifugation, dried under N2(g), dissolved in water, and applied to a 1-ml column of Dowex AG1-X2 (formate form). After washing with 20 ml of water, which removed essentially all neutral hexose, hexose phosphates were eluted with 15 ml of 4 m formic acid (15Spiro M.J. Diabetologia. 1984; 26: 70-75Google Scholar) and dried under N2(g). Recovery of a Glc-6-P standard was greater than 90% (not shown). However, hexose 1-phosphates were highly sensitive to hydrolysis, and under these conditions more than 95% of Glc-1-P standard was recovered as glucose. Thus, glucose appearing in the 4 m formic acid eluate represented Glc-1-P. Hexoses and hexose phosphates were modified with 2-aminoacridone (AMAC) and separated with a modified monosaccharide composition gel (16Gao N. Lehrman M.A. Glycobiol. 2002; 12: 353-360Google Scholar) composed of a 20% acrylamide separating gel with 125 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3 and a 6% acrylamide stacking gel with 63 mm Tris borate, pH 6.8. The running buffer was 0.1 m Tris borate (pH 8.3). All other aspects of the electrophoresis were similar to those described for commercial monosaccharide composition gels (Glyko). AMAC-modified sugars were quantified with a BioScan fluorescence scanner as described (16Gao N. Lehrman M.A. Glycobiol. 2002; 12: 353-360Google Scholar). Glycogen was extracted from cell monolayers in 100-mm dishes, pre-chilled on ice, and washed with ice-cold PBS, by scraping with 1 ml of ice-cold 70% perchloric acid followed by sonication at 0 degrees (17Keppler D. Decker K. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods Of Enzymatic Analysis. 6. VCH, Weinheim, Germany1974: 1127-1131Google Scholar). After removal of insoluble material by centrifugation, aliquots were used for determination of glucose with or without prior enzymatic degradation of glycogen. Glycogen degradation was achieved by combining 0.4 ml of extract with 0.2 ml of 1 m KHCO3 and 2 ml of 1 mg/ml amyloglucosidase (Sigma A3514) solution, followed by shaking at 40 °C for 2 h. The incubation was stopped by adding 1 ml of 70% perchloric acid, neutralized with 2–3 mg solid KHCO3to a pH of 6.9–7.3, and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min. Glucose was assayed by mixing up to 0.1 ml of the supernatant with 1 ml of buffer containing 0.3 m triethanolamine chloride, pH 7.5, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mm NADP+, 4 mm MgSO4, and 5 μg/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. After incubation at 37 °C for 5 min, absorbance at 340 nm was determined. Hexokinase (Sigma H5625) was added to a final concentration of 1.4 units/ml. After an additional 5 min at 37 °C, absorbance at 340 nm was again determined, from which the first reading was subtracted to determine the glucose-specific change in absorbance. After subtraction of values obtained without amyloglucosidase treatment and comparison with standard glucose samples, the quantity of glycogen-derived glucose was determined. Compared with tissues such as liver, brain, and muscle, little is known about regulation of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, or glycogenolysis in dermal fibroblasts. A number of regulatory points in hexose metabolism with the potential to modulate LLO mannosylation were therefore evaluated to determine whether they might be regulated by the UPR (Fig. 1). ER stress conditions shown previously to stimulate LLO extension were chosen. These conditions did not cause cytoplasmic stress, itself a potential regulator of hexose metabolism. 2J. Shang and M. A. Lehrman, unpublished observations. DTT was particularly useful because it acted within 20 min of addition to cells, and its effects on LLO extension were due to an ER stress response rather than a direct chemical reduction of a regulatory enzyme (4Shang J. Koerner C. Freeze H.H. Lehrman M.A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 307-317Google Scholar). However, for the current study two significant modifications were made. First, cells were maintained continuously in medium with 5 mm glucose. In prior studies, a 20-min period in 0.5 mm glucose medium was necessary to provide a pool of truncated LLOs. Second, TN could not be used in prior studies since it directly inhibits LLO synthesis. TN was used in the present study since any UPR effectors should be activated by it. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared by gentle permeabilization of the plasma membrane with streptolysin-O (SLO) to minimize release of material from damaged intracellular organelles (8Martys J.L. Shevell T. McGraw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25976-25984Google Scholar). Thus, our assays were limited to readily diffusable components. No changes were observed for seven key enzymes and co-factors (TableI). There were no apparent stress effects on enzymes (phosphomannose isomerase, phosphomannomutase) that might divert Fru-6-P, a key intermediate in glycolysis, to mannosyl phosphates. No changes were detected in the enzymes (phosphofructokinase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase) or cytoplasmic activators of phosphofructokinase (such as Fru-2,6-bisP) that regulate interconversion of Fru-6-P and Fru-1,6-bisP, and thus possibly shift hexose units from glycolysis to glycoprotein synthesis. Consistent with the prior lack of evidence for enhanced uptake glucose and mannose from culture medium (6Doerrler W.T. Lehrman M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13050-13055Google Scholar), no measurable changes were detected for hexokinase. Phosphoglucomutatase, inhibition of which could prevent storage of imported hexose as glycogen, was also unaffected. Considering these and earlier (6Doerrler W.T. Lehrman M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13050-13055Google Scholar) results, it is clear that ER stress does not cause widespread changes in activities involved in hexose metabolism. As shown in Fig.2, panel A, GP activity was detectable in fibroblasts in both its more active (AMP-independent) and less active (AMP-dependent) forms. Although detailed information about this enzyme in fibroblasts is lacking, by extension from tissues such as liver and muscle it is possible that phosphorylation converts the less active form, GPb, to the more active form, GPa (18Johnson L.N. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2274-2282Google Scholar). Caffeine, which blocks AMP binding to GPb, inhibited the AMP- dependent activity but not the AMP-independent activity (Fig. 2, panel B). When cells were treated with DTT, TN (Fig. 2, panel C), or AZC (not shown) at concentrations known to cause ER stress (4Shang J. Koerner C. Freeze H.H. Lehrman M.A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 307-317Google Scholar), AMP-independent GP activity in extracts increased, but AMP-dependent activity was unaffected. Activation of GP occurred within 20 min of DTT addition. Direct addition of DTT to assays, or its inclusion during extract preparation, did not affect GP activity (not shown). Thus, stimulation by DTT was not due to a direct chemical reduction of GP or a modulator of GP, as expected since the cytoplasmic environment in which GP exists is highly reducing. In addition to the fibroblast culture used in the experiments displayed in the figures, ER stress with DTT or TN increased GPa but not GPb activities in seven other adult and pediatric dermal fibroblast cultures (Table II). The stimulation of GP by ER stress did not exceed 2-fold, but the following sections provide evidence that this stimulation was significant. Dermal fibroblasts contained, on average, 230 nmol of glycogen-derived glucose per 106 cells. In the presence of orthophosphate, GP converts glycogen into Glc-1-P. Small but consistent losses of glycogen were observed with DTT (23 ± 2%, n = 13) and TN (12 ± 2%, n = 3). For DTT, the decrease occurred after 15 min of addition. Since cellular glycogen loss may be counterbalanced by its synthesis, the apparently weaker effect of TN may be related to the fact that it acted more slowly (within 1 h). Thus, the resulting glycogenolysis would be more easily compensated by glycogen synthesis. These losses of glycogen, though small, were more than adequate to account for downstream effects on hexose phosphates and LLOs (Table III).Table IIIStoichiometry of hexose flux resulting from ER stressForm of hexoseType of ER stressnmolGlycogen-derived Glc-1-P produced2 mm DTT525 μg/ml TN18Glc-1-P detected2 mm DTT (FACE)2.4Glc-6-P detected2 mm DTT (FACE)4.52 mm DTT (assay)3.05 μg/ml TN (assay)3.8200 μg/ml CSN (assay)1.3Neutral hexose in Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol required0.02Estimates are based upon 106 cells.

Four different cell types were cultured on section and acellularized section substrata prepared from a bovine placenta. The labyrinth region of the substratum induced cell differentiation to elicit the formation of multicellular spheroids of BeWo cells (human choriocarcinoma cells), a capillary network-like structure for CPAE cells (bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells), and a neuronal network-like structure for PC-12 cells (rat pheochromocytoma cells). The substratum provided a microenvironment that maintained the viability of PC-12 cells in a serum-free culture. We also succeeded in preparing a multicellular mass of normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) involving acellularized section-derived components. This technology offers the novel investigation of cell behaviors induced by culturing different cell types on various tissue sections and will be a useful tool for identifying cell characteristics and clarifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate the behavior of each cell type."

In the presence of double-stranded RNA, they polymerize ATP to form 2–5 (A) oligomers that, in turn, activate the latent ribonuclease RNase L, causing mRNA degradation. These enzymes, unlike other nucleotidyl transferases, catalyze 2′-5′, not 3′-5′, phosphodiester bond formation between substrates bound to the acceptor and donor sites. Moreover, unlike other members of this extended family, the P69 isozyme of 2–5 (A) synthetase functions as a homodimer. Here, we report that the need for P69 dimerization is because of a crisscross enzyme reaction joining two substrate molecules bound to two opposite subunits. Consequently, although homodimers of mutants in the previously identified acceptor site, the donor site, or the catalytic site were inactive, selective heterodimers of the mutants were active because of subunit complementation. The catalytic site had to be present in the same subunit that contained the acceptor site, whereas the donor site had to be provided by the other subunit. These results allowed us to design a mutant protein that acted as a dominant-negative inhibitor of wt P69 but not of another isozyme of 2–5 (A) synthetase. 2′-5′ oligoadenylate (2–5 (A)) synthetases are major components of the antiviral pathways induced by interferons.

Interferon-inducible 2′-5′ oligoadenylate (2–5 (A)) 1The abbreviations used are: 2–5 (A), 2′-5′-oligoadenylate; wt, wild type; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid.1The abbreviations used are: 2–5 (A), 2′-5′-oligoadenylate; wt, wild type; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. synthetases are unique enzymes that catalyze 2′-5′ oligoadenylate formation from ATP in the presence of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as co-factor (1Sen G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 255-281Google Scholar, 2Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Google Scholar). 2–5 (A) can activate a latent ribonuclease, RNase L, by causing its dimerization (3Dong B. Silverman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4133-4137Google Scholar). Activation of 2–5 (A) synthetase enzymes by viral dsRNA causes the synthesis of 2–5 (A), activation of RNase L, and degradation of RNA, thus preventing the replication of certain viruses (4Ghosh A. Sarkar S.N. Sen G.C. Virology. 2000; 266: 319-328Google Scholar, 5Gribaudo G. Lembo D. Cavallo G. Landolfo S. Lengyel P. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1748-1757Google Scholar). Three major size classes of 2–5 (A) synthetases are found in humans: the large form, P100; the medium form, P69; and the small form, P42. In the medium and the small size classes, different isoforms exist because of alternative splicing. The different isozymes of 2–5 (A) synthetase are structurally related with extremely high sequence conservation among similar isozymes from different species (6Sarkar S.N. Sen G.C. Methods. 1998; 15: 233-242Google Scholar, 7Rebouillat D. Hovanessian A.G. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 295-308Google Scholar, 8Justesen J. Hartmann R. Kjeldgaard N.O. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1593-1612Google Scholar). The oligomeric composition of each form is different: the large form is active as a monomeric protein, the medium form as dimeric protein, and the small forms as tetrameric proteins. It has been shown that dimerization is necessary for the activity of P69 (9Sarkar S.N. Ghosh A. Wang H.W. Sung S.S. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25535-25542Google Scholar). We are interested in understanding the structure-function relationship of 2–5 (A) synthetases and have focused on the P69 isozyme. In this context, we would like to know why it catalyzes 2′-5′ bond formation, why it needs double-stranded RNA as a co-factor, and why it functions as a dimer. It is the last question that was addressed in the current study. Previously, we have identified the catalytic site, the acceptor binding site, and the donor binding site of P69 (10Sarkar S.N. Miyagi M. Crabb J.W. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24321-24330Google Scholar). These sites are highly conserved in other isozymes as well, and mutations in any of these three sites inactivate the enzyme. Here, we report that heterodimers of different mutant molecules are active, indicating that the two subunits of P69 participate in crisscross reactions, catalyzing the joining of two substrates bound to the opposite P69 monomer molecules. This information allowed us to design a dominant-negative mutant of P69 that was isozyme-specific. Site-directed mutagenesis to generate P69 mutants Y421P, R544A, and D408A/D410A and their expression in insect cells using baculovirus vectors has been described (10Sarkar S.N. Miyagi M. Crabb J.W. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24321-24330Google Scholar). The acceptor site mutant, Y421P (A*), was expressed as N-terminal His-tagged (His-A*) or C-terminal FLAG-tagged (A*-FLAG) protein. The donor site mutant, R544A (D*), was expressed as N-terminal His-tagged protein (His-D*). The catalytic site mutant, D408A, D410A (C*), was expressed as C-terminal FLAG-tagged (C*-FLAG) protein (9Sarkar S.N. Ghosh A. Wang H.W. Sung S.S. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25535-25542Google Scholar). The double mutant of P69 (A*D*) was constructed by combining the Y421P (A*) and R544A (D*) mutants and expressed as N-terminal His-tagged protein. We have used three different types of wt P69 constructs for different experiments: N-terminal His-tagged P69 (His-wt), C-terminal FLAG-tagged P69 (wt-FLAG), and N-terminal His-tagged and C-terminal FLAG-tagged P69 (His-wt-FLAG). The small isozyme of 2–5 (A) synthetase, 3–9, was expressed as a C-terminal FLAG-tagged protein (3–9-FLAG) (11Ghosh A. Sarkar S.N. Rowe T.M. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25447-25455Google Scholar). The various proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using Ni-chromatography for His-tagged proteins or anti-FLAG antibody for FLAG-tagged proteins or both in succession for doubly tagged proteins (10Sarkar S.N. Miyagi M. Crabb J.W. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24321-24330Google Scholar). Methods for Western blotting, enzyme activity measurements, and enzyme kinetic parameter calculations have been described before (9Sarkar S.N. Ghosh A. Wang H.W. Sung S.S. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25535-25542Google Scholar, 12Sarkar S.N. Bandyopadhyay S. Ghosh A. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1848-1855Google Scholar). Different mutant or wt proteins were expressed by simultaneously infecting high five cells with two recombinant baculoviruses carrying expression cassettes for different proteins. In the case of single infections, we used virus at 20 multiplicity of infection whereas, for co-infection experiments, 10 multiplicity of infection of each virus was used. Depending on experiments, proteins were either purified by Ni-NTA chromatography or anti-FLAG antibody-agarose immunoprecipitation. Ni-NTA binding was performed as described before (12Sarkar S.N. Bandyopadhyay S. Ghosh A. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1848-1855Google Scholar) except that at the end of the washing, instead of eluting the proteins beads were finally washed and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm magnesium acetate, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol. Part of the bead suspension was then boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The quantities of FLAG-tagged proteins were determined by densitometric scanning, normalized in all samples, and 2–5 (A) synthetase assay was performed with equivalent amounts of proteins. Anti-FLAG antibody-agarose (Sigma) binding was done with a protocol described earlier (9Sarkar S.N. Ghosh A. Wang H.W. Sung S.S. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25535-25542Google Scholar). For enzyme activity analysis, heterodimers were purified by a two-step purification process. First, a standard Ni-NTA purification was done (6Sarkar S.N. Sen G.C. Methods. 1998; 15: 233-242Google Scholar). The eluted proteins from this purification were dialyzed against FLAG binding buffer (300 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm betamercaptoethanol, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol). Dialyzed protein samples were then applied to the anti-FLAG antibody-agarose column, followed by washing five times with the same buffer. Proteins were eluted from the beads using synthetic FLAG peptide (Sigma) at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in the FLAG binding buffer. Purified proteins were then quantified by Coomassie Blue staining and Bradford assay before use in enzyme assay. Monomeric wt P69 does not have enzymatic activity, but its association with an inactive P69 molecule carrying a mutation in the catalytic (C) domain restores enzyme activity (9Sarkar S.N. Ghosh A. Wang H.W. Sung S.S. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25535-25542Google Scholar). We wondered whether similar restoration could be achieved by acceptor (A) site and donor (D) site mutants. For this purpose, the wt protein and the test mutant proteins were tagged with different epitopes, and the two proteins were co-expressed in insect cells by infecting them with the respective baculoviral vectors. In the co-infected cells, wt homodimers, mutant homodimers, and wt/mutant heterodimers were formed (Fig. 1 A). The heterodimers were separated from the active wt homodimers by affinity chromatography (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and 6). A wt homodimer carrying both epitope tags was purified efficiently (Fig.1 B, lanes 4 and 8) and was highly active (Fig. 1 C, lanes 4 and 8). In contrast, similarly purified A site mutant (A*) homodimers (Fig.1 B, lane 3) and D site mutant (D*) homodimers (Fig. 1 B, lane 7) were enzymatically inactive (Fig. 1 C, lanes 3 and 7). The heterodimers of the wt and the mutant proteins, wt/A* (Fig. 1C, lane 2) and wt/D* (Fig. 1 C, lane 6) were both active. The compositions of the products produced by the wt/mutant heterodimer (lanes 2 and 6) and the wt/wt homodimer (lanes 4 and 8) were slightly different because the substrate to active enzyme ratios, which affect the 2–5 (A) profile, were different (12Sarkar S.N. Bandyopadhyay S. Ghosh A. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1848-1855Google Scholar). To characterize these heterodimers further, they were purified away from the mutant homodimers, and their enzyme activity in the presence of increasing ATP concentrations was measured. These measurements allowed us to compare thekcat values of different proteins (Fig. 3). Thekcat values of the different wt/mutant heterodimers were approximately half that of the wt homodimer, indicating that only one catalytic unit was functional in the heterodimers. Under the conditions of the assays, there was no dissociation of the wt subunit from the heterodimers to form wt homodimers. This was tested by immunoprecipitating the mutant from the purified heterodimer preparation after the assay and testing the supernatant for the presence of wt molecule by activity assay and Western blot (data not shown).Figure 3Catalytic efficiency of active heterodimers. Purified heterodimeric proteins (0.01 mg/ml) were used for assay in the presence of increasing ATP concentrations to determine the k cat as described earlier (12Sarkar S.N. Bandyopadhyay S. Ghosh A. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1848-1855Google Scholar). The compositions of the active heterodimers are shown schematically in the second column, where squares (■) represent the N-terminal His tag. The circles (○) represent C-terminal FLAG tag. The x,Y, and the filled circle (●), respectively, mark the positions of A*, D*, and C* in the linear sequence of P69.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The observed enzyme activity of wt/mutant heterodimers can be explained in at least two ways. It is possible that binding of the mutant molecule changes the conformation of the wt molecule in the heterodimer and activates it. Alternatively, the two molecules may function in a crisscross fashion, i.e. the catalytic center of one molecule acting upon substrates bound to the other molecule. If the second model is right, one can expect complementation of activity between two molecules with mutations at different sites. This was indeed the case, as shown in Fig.2. Cells were co-infected with viruses expressing two mutant proteins with different epitope tags. His-tagged proteins purified from the extracts contained both homodimeric and heterodimeric proteins (Fig. 2 A). As expected, D*/D* (lane 1) or A*/A* (lane 2) had very little activity, whereas wt/wt was highly active (Fig. 2 B,lane 6). Different heterodimers containing two mutant subunits had different properties: A*/D* (lane 4) and C*/D* (lane 5) were active, whereas A*/C* was inactive (Fig.2 B, lane 3). Thus, in two of three combinations, there was restoration of enzyme activity by complementation of two inactive molecules. To further characterize the properties of the A*/D* and C*/D* proteins, these heterodimers were purified away from the homodimers by successive affinity chromatography using anti-FLAG antibody-agarose and Ni-agarose, and their activities were compared with that of similarly purified doubly tagged wt protein. The specific activities (kcat) of these heterodimers were about half that of the wt protein, indicating that, as anticipated from the crisscross model, only one catalytic unit was functional (Fig.3). The product profiles and the kinetics of reaction by the two active heterodimers and the wt protein were identical (data not shown). Although P69 functions as a dimer, the single site inactive mutants of P69 failed to act as dominant-negative inhibitors of the wt protein (Fig. 1). The reason for this failure became apparent from the results shown in Fig.2: for producing enzyme activity, the unmutated sites in the inactive molecule acted in conjunction with the site in the wt molecule that was mutated in the inactive molecule. These results, in turn, led to the successful design of a dominant-negative mutant of P69. Our results suggested that if both the acceptor and the donor sites are mutated in one subunit, the mutant protein should act as a dominant-negative inhibitor of the wt protein. This was indeed the case, as shown in Fig.4. A hexahistidine-tagged double mutant of P69 (A*D*) was co-expressed with a FLAG-tagged wt protein. The heterodimer was purified by successive affinity chromatography (Fig.4 A, lane 1, inset). As expected, the heterodimer was completely inactive, whereas the wt homodimer was highly active (Fig. 4 A). The ability of A*D* to inhibit the activity of wt P69 in vivo was tested by expressing a fixed amount of the wt protein and increasing amounts of A*D* and measuring the enzyme activity in cell extracts. Cells expressing the wt protein had a high activity (Fig. 4, B and C, lane 1), whereas there was no activity in cells expressing only A*D* (Fig. 4, B andC, lane 2). In the cells co-expressing the two proteins, comparable amounts of the wt protein were present (Fig.4 B, lanes 3–5). As increasing amounts of A*D* were expressed, the enzyme activity diminished gradually (Fig.4 C, lanes 3–5). These results demonstrated that A*D* P69 is an effective inhibitor of the wt P69 protein. In the next experiment, we tested the specificity of action of A*D* P69. For this purpose, we examined whether A*D* P69 could inhibit the activity of a different isozyme, 3–9, which is a small human 2–5 (A) synthetase isoform. A*D* was co-expressed with wt P69 or wt 3–9, and enzyme activity in the extracts was measured (Fig.5). Although, as expected, A*D* inhibited the activity of wt P69 (Fig. 5 B, lane 2), it could not inhibit 3–9 activity (Fig. 5 B, lanes 3and 4). This was because A*D* could not interact with 3–9, as revealed by the lack of their co-immunoprecipitation (Fig.5 A, lanes 3 and 4). Thus, although 3–9 and P69 have a high sequence homology (8Justesen J. Hartmann R. Kjeldgaard N.O. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1593-1612Google Scholar), their activities could be selectively blocked by A*D* P69. Previously, we had identified four functionally important sites of P69, a protein of 687 residues, that are required for its enzyme activity; mutations in any of these sites inactivated the protein. One site, containing the residues 668–670, mediates dimerization of P69 that is essential for its activity (9Sarkar S.N. Ghosh A. Wang H.W. Sung S.S. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25535-25542Google Scholar). Three Asp residues at 408, 410, and 481 are also essential because they form the ‘C’ site, the catalytic triad (9Sarkar S.N. Ghosh A. Wang H.W. Sung S.S. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25535-25542Google Scholar). Recently, using photoaffinity cross-linking of substrates followed by appropriate mutational studies, we have identified two substrate binding sites of this protein. The residue Tyr-421 is essential for binding the acceptor 2–5 (A) or ATP at the acceptor (A) site and the residue Arg-544 is essential for binding the donor ATP molecules at the done (D) site (10Sarkar S.N. Miyagi M. Crabb J.W. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24321-24330Google Scholar). Homodimers of P69 containing point mutations in any of the above sites are enzymatically inactive (10Sarkar S.N. Miyagi M. Crabb J.W. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24321-24330Google Scholar). However, heterodimers with one wt molecule and one mutant molecule were active. Moreover, these heterodimers had approximately half the specific activity of that of the wt homodimer (Fig. 3). These observations, along with the mutant complementation results (Fig. 2), led us to propose a model for P69 action (Fig. 6). The central feature of this model is that a dimeric protein is essential for enzyme activity because of the crisscross nature of the enzyme reaction. This implies that one active dimer of the protein simultaneously catalyzes two units of catalysis. In each of these reactions, the catalytic center (C) of the first subunit catalyzes the transfers of an AMP molecule from the donor bound to the D site of the second subunit to the elongating 2–5 (A) bound to the A site of the first subunit. In other words, the reaction involves the A and the C sites of one subunit and the D site of the other. In a normal wt/wt homodimer, two reciprocal reactions proceed, but in the wt/mutant or mutant/mutant heterodimers only one reaction occurs. Consequently, these heterodimers had half the specific activity of the wt protein (Fig. 3). Note that the model does not permit the A site and the C site to be contributed by the opposite subunits. This restriction reflects the observed failure of the A* and the C* mutants to complement (Fig. 2). It is conceivable that because of the physical proximity of the two sites (residues 408, 410, and 421), a mutation in one site also affects the structure of the other site to make it nonfunctional. In other words, both the A* and the C* mutants were functionally A*C* double mutants. In that case, according to our model, a homodimer containing two A*C* molecules is not expected to be active. In support of the view that mutations in the A site or the C site affect the unmutated site as well, we observed reduced cross-linking of the acceptor to the C* mutant protein (data not shown). Similar observations for DNA polymerases, that mutations in the catalytic center affect substrate binding to the protein, have been made by others (13Date T. Yamamoto S. Tanihara K. Nishimoto Y. Matsukage A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5286-5292Google Scholar). Crisscross enzymatic reactions involving different subunits of oligomeric enzymes have been noted before. For example, for aspartate transcarbamylase, active site complementation has been suggested (14Wente S.R. Schachman H.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 31-35Google Scholar). Similar models have also been proposed for orinithine decarboxylase, diacylglycerol kinase, and thymidylate synthetases (15Tobias K.E. Kahana C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5842-5847Google Scholar, 16Lau F.W. Chen X. Bowie J.U. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5521-5527Google Scholar, 17Saxl R.L. Changchien L.M. Hardy L.W. Maley F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5275-5282Google Scholar). However, a similar mechanism of catalysis has not been noted before for any other member of the class I nucleotidyl transferase superfamily to which P69 belongs (18Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 345-347Google Scholar). It remains to be seen whether this unique feature of P69 contributes to its property of catalyzing the 2′-5′ bond formation. It also remains to be examined whether the general feature of this model holds true for the other size classes of 2–5 (A) synthetases. The small isozymes, which appear to be active as tetramers, can easily accommodate some variations of the crisscross model. In contrast, the large isozyme functions as a monomer (19Marie I. Svab J. Robert N. Galabru J. Hovanessian A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18601-18607Google Scholar, 20Hovanessian A.G. Svab J. Marie I. Robert N. Chamaret S. Laurent A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4945-4949Google Scholar). However, because it contains three repeated units of the monomeric sequence (21Rebouillat D. Hovnanian A. Marie I. Hovanessian A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1557-1565Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the crisscross reaction in its case is intra-subunit. Future investigations along this line may also reveal the reason for the inability of the large isozyme to synthesize anything longer than a 2–5 (A) dimer. Once the nature of the crisscross reaction became apparent, it was clear that an A*D* mutant should inhibit the activity of the wt protein. As expected, the wt/A*D* heterodimer was completely inactive (Fig. 4 A). Moreover, when co-expressed, the mutant was able to inhibit the activity of the wt protein in the cell extract in a dominant-negative fashion. The degree of inhibition increased with increased expressions of the mutant, although the level of the wt protein remained constant (Fig. 4, B and C). This effect was isozyme-specific; the activity of 3–9, a small isozyme, was not affected by P69 A*D* because the two proteins did not interact (Fig. 5). These observations now provide us with tools to investigate isozyme-specific functions of 2–5 (A) synthetases both in cultured cells and in experimental animals.
