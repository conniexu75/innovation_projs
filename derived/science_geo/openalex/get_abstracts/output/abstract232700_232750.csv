https://openalex.org/W1983078193,"Mechanisms of mitochondrial superoxide formation remain poorly understood despite considerable medical interest in oxidative stress. Superoxide is produced from both Complexes I and III of the electron transport chain, and once in its anionic form it is too strongly charged to readily cross the inner mitochondrial membrane. Thus, superoxide production exhibits a distinct membrane sidedness or topology. In the present work, using measurements of hydrogen peroxide (Amplex red) as well as superoxide (modified Cypridina luciferin analog and aconitase), we demonstrate that Complex I-dependent superoxide is exclusively released into the matrix and that no detectable levels escape from intact mitochondria. This finding fits well with the proposed site of electron leak at Complex I, namely the iron-sulfur clusters of the (matrix-protruding) hydrophilic arm. Our data on Complex III show direct extramitochondrial release of superoxide, but measurements of hydrogen peroxide production revealed that this could only account for ∼50% of the total electron leak even in mitochondria lacking CuZn-superoxide dismutase. We posit that the remaining ∼50% of the electron leak must be due to superoxide released to the matrix. Measurements of (mitochondrial matrix) aconitase inhibition, performed in the presence of exogenous superoxide dismutase and catalase, confirmed this hypothesis. Our data indicate that Complex III can release superoxide to both sides of the inner mitochondrial membrane. The locus of superoxide production in Complex III, the ubiquinol oxidation site, is situated immediately next to the intermembrane space. This explains extramitochondrial release of superoxide but raises the question of how superoxide could reach the matrix. We discuss two models explaining this result."

Here we describe the high-fidelity teleportation of photons over a distance of 600 metres across the River Danube in Vienna, with the optimal efficiency that can be achieved using linear optics. Our result is a step towards the implementation of a quantum repeater, which will enable pure entanglement to be shared between distant parties in a public environment and eventually on a worldwide scale."

https://openalex.org/W2003189219,"Barley (Hordeum vulgare) has played a pivotal role in Old World agriculture since its domestication about 10,000 yr ago1. Barley plants carrying loss-of-function alleles (mlo) of the Mlo locus are resistant against all known isolates of the widespread powdery mildew fungus2. The sole mlo resistance allele recovered so far from a natural habitat, mlo-11, was originally retrieved from Ethiopian landraces and nowadays controls mildew resistance in the majority of cultivated European spring barley elite varieties2. Here we use haplotype analysis to show that the mlo-11 allele probably arose once after barley domestication. Resistance in mlo-11 plants is linked to a complex tandem repeat array inserted upstream of the wild-type gene. The repeat units consist of a truncated Mlo gene comprising 3.5 kilobases (kb) of 5′-regulatory sequence plus 1.1 kb of coding sequence. These generate aberrant transcripts that impair the accumulation of both Mlo wild-type transcript and protein. We exploited the meiotic instability of mlo-11 resistance and recovered susceptible revertants in which restoration of Mlo function was accompanied by excision of the repeat array. We infer cis-dependent perturbation of transcription machinery assembly by transcriptional interference in mlo-11 plants as a likely mechanism leading to disease resistance."

Interestingly, only one specific ceramide, C18:0-ceramide, was selectively down-regulated in the majority of HNSCC tumor tissues. On the other hand, in nonsquamous tumor tissues, this selectivity for C18-ceramide was not detected. These data suggested the hypotheses that decreased levels of C -ceramide might impart a growth advantage to HNSCC 18cells and that increased generation of C18-ceramide may be involved in the inhibition of growth. These roles were examined by reconstitution of C18-ceramide at physiologically relevant concentrations in UM-SCC-22A cells (squamous cell carcinoma of hypopharynx) via overexpression of mammalian upstream regulator of growth and differentiation factor 1 (mUOG1), a mouse homologue of longevity assurance gene 1 (mLAG1), which has been shown to specifically induce the generation of C18-ceramide. Liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy analysis showed that overexpression of the mLAG1/mUOG1 resulted in increased levels of only C18:0-ceramide by ∼2-fold, i.e. concentrations similar to those of normal head and neck tissues. Importantly, increased generation of C18-ceramide by mLAG1/mUOG1 inhibited cell growth (∼70–80%), which mechanistically involved the modulation of telomerase activity and induction of apoptotic cell death by mitochondrial dysfunction. In conclusion, this study demonstrates, for the first time, a biological role for LAG1 and C18-ceramide in the regulation of growth of HNSCC.

Global occurrence rate of HNSCC is estimated to be ∼5% of the total malignancies in the adult population, and in the United States there are ∼40,000 annual cases of HNSCC (1Dong G. Chen Z. Li Z.Y.

Parsa B. Close A. Magnusson B. Crowe D.L. Sinha U.K. Int. J. Oncol. 2003; 22: 1285-1290PubMed Google Scholar), delineation of pathogenic mechanisms is required for understanding the biology of these tumors, for designing optimized therapy, and for identification of specific diagnostic and prognostic markers. The bioactive sphingolipid ceramide, an emerging tumor suppressor lipid, mediates anti-proliferative responses such as apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and senescence (6Hannun Y.A.

Our recent studies have shown that ceramide is one of the upstream regulators of telomerase activity (8Ogretmen B. Schady D. Usta J. Wood R. Kraveka J.M. Luberto C. Birbes H. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M.

It is well established that telomerase is active in ∼80–90% of the tumor tissues of the HNSCCs, whereas it is not active in normal head and neck tissues (12Fabricius E.M. Gurr U. Wildner G.P. Anal.

These results suggested to us that endogenous levels of ceramide may also be misregulated in HNSCC. Endogenous ceramide levels can be altered by various mechanisms, including de novo synthesis of ceramide or activation of sphingomyelinases, which can regulate cell growth (16Marchesini N. Osta W.

One of the key enzymes of the de novo pathway is (dihydro)ceramide synthase, and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae longevity assurance gene 1 (LAG1) and its homologue Lac1 were identified as components of ceramide synthase activity (17D'mello N.P.

Recent studies have shown that one of the mouse homologues of LAG1, known as upstream of growth and differentiation factor 1 (mUOG1 or mLAG1) selectively regulates the synthesis of stearoyl (C18)-containing sphingolipids, including C18-ceramide (19Venkataraman K. Riebeling C. Bodennec J. Riezman H. Allegood J.C. Sullards M.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. Futerman A.H. J. Biol.

The human homologue of the mLAG1/mUOG1 (hLAG1, LAG1Hs, or LASS1) has recently been identified and has >80% amino acid homology with mLAG1 (20Jiang J.C. Kirchman P.A. Zagulski M. Hunt J.

Subsequently, two additional homologues of mammalian LAG1 family members, trh1 and trh4, were identified to regulate ceramide synthesis using different fatty acyl CoA donors (22Riebeling C.

Overexpression of trh1 increased mainly stearic acid and arachidic acid-containing sphingolipids, and trh4 overexpression elevated mainly palmitic acid-containing sphingolipids (22Riebeling C.

Because the clinical relevance of endogenous ceramide and its roles in the regulation of cell growth in HNSCC has not been established previously, this study first focused on examining the levels of endogenous ceramide in clinical samples obtained from patients with HNSCC. Unexpectedly, the data demonstrated that only C18-ceramide is down-regulated significantly in the majority of the HNSCC when compared with their adjacent normal tissues. However, in nonsquamous tumors, this selective down-regulation of C18-ceramide was not detected, suggesting a specific role for C18-ceramide in the pathogenesis/progression of HNSCC. Further evidence is presented to establish the role of LAG1/C18-ceramide in the inhibition of growth, modulation of telomerase activity, and induction of apoptosis in HNSCC cells in vitro. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating a biological role for LAG1 and C18-ceramide in the regulation of growth of HNSCC. Tissue Samples and Statistical Analysis—Tumors and their paired adjacent noncancerous tissues of HNSCC and nonsquamous head and neck cancer patients were obtained from the Tumor Bank at the Hollings Cancer Center (Medical University of South Carolina) with the permission of the Institutional Review Board. Normal adjacent tissues, which were mucosal tissues that were not grossly or histologically cancerous or precancerous, were excised at least 1 cm away from the main tumor mass of the patients. Some of the patients (HNSCC patients 1–17) have tissues from their tumor mass and from their normal adjacent part, which were referred as “paired” samples, and some patients (HNSCC patients 18–32) have only their tumor tissues without normal adjacent tissues. The type of disease and the levels of C18-ceramide in tumors as compared with normal tissues are summarized in Tables I and II. Ceramide measurements in these samples were performed by LC/MS as described below. Statistical analyses of the results were performed using Student's t test.Table IAlterations of C18-ceramide levels in human HNSCC tumor tissuesPatientType of squamous cell carcinomaC18-ceramide%1Tongue158 (5.1)2Oral cavity66 (1.7)3Oral cavity9 (0.3)4FOM207 (7)5FOM20 (0.6)6Tonsil30 (0.8)7Oral cavity2 (0.2)8Larynx7 (0.3)9Cheek88 (2.9)10Neck12 (0.5)11Tongue23 (1.2)12Cheek112 (4.5)13Tongue54 (2.2)14FOM18 (0.7)15Tongue67 (1.8)16Oral cavity110 (3.4)17Tongue74 (4.6)18Oral cavity11 (1.8)19Oral cavity67 (3)20Larynx46 (2.7)21Larynx60 (4)22Neck35 (1)23Neck25 (1.8)24Hypopharynx46 (2.1)25FOM25 (2)26Tongue86 (3)27Tongue69 (3)28Oropharynx67 (3.6)29Hypopharynx70 (4.5)30Tonsil-tongue84 (4.8)31Tongue174 (18)32Oropharynx36 (6.4)Normal (average of 1-17)100 (36) Open table in a new tab Table IIThe alterations of C- and C18-ceramides in nonsquamous head and neck cancer tumorsPatient #Type of diseaseC16-ceramideC18-ceramide%%1Thyroid (PC/A)18 (4.3)27 (3.6)2Thyroid (PC/A)28 (12)38 (5)3Thyroid (PC/A)1206 (130)710 (50)4Parotid (PA)156 (13)91 (10)5Parotid (PA)14 (2.7)12 (1.9)6Parotid (PA)1516 (387)655 (227)7Mandible (OS)1990 (105)740 (185)8Neck (GN)36 (6)28 (8)9Maxilla (CCC)5 (1.5)11 (1.8)10Oral cavity (CCC)38 (4.3)45 (11) Open table in a new tab Measurement of Ceramide Levels Using High Performance LC/MS— The cellular levels of endogenous ceramides were measured using normal phase high performance liquid chromatography coupled to atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) as described previously (9Kraveka J.M. Li L. Bielawski J. Obeid L.M. Ogretmen B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 419: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The ceramide levels were normalized to total protein levels (0.5 mg of protein/sample). Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—Human head and neck cancer cell lines UM-SCC-1 (SCC of retromolar trigone/floor of the mouth) and UM-SCC-22A (SCC of hypopharynx) cells (23Bradford C.R. Zhu S.

The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Detection of Growth Inhibition by MTT and Trypan Blue Assays— The concentrations of agents that inhibited cell growth by 50% (IC50) were determined from cell survival plots obtained by MTT or trypan blue assays as described (8Ogretmen B.

Triplicate wells were used for each treatment. Plasmids and Transfections—The complete cDNA (1.4 kb) for mammalian UOG1 (mLAG1/mUOG1) was cloned in the pCMVexSVneo plasmid and used for transfections of UM-SCC-22A and UM-SCC-1 cells using an Effectine transfection kit (Qiagen) as described previously (8Ogretmen B. Schady D. Usta J. Wood R. Kraveka J.M. Luberto C. Birbes H. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24901-24910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Quantitative Real Time (Q)-PCR and Conventional Semi-quantitative Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—One μg of total RNA, isolated using an RNA isolation kit (Qiagen), was used in reverse transcription reactions as described (8Ogretmen B.

The resulting total cDNA was then used in the Q-PCR or RT-PCR as described previously (8Ogretmen B. Schady D. Usta J. Wood R. Kraveka J.M. Luberto C. Birbes H. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol.

Analysis of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—The collapse of an electrochemical gradient across the mitochondrial membrane during apoptosis was measured using a JC-1 mitochondrial membrane potential detection kit (Cell Technology) by flow cytometry as described by the manufacturer. This kit uses a unique cationic dye, JC-1, to signal the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential. In healthy cells, the dye accumulates in the mitochondria as aggregates, which become fluorescent red. In apoptotic cells, the mitochondrial potential collapses, and the JC-1 cannot accumulate within the mitochondria and remains in the cytoplasm as a green fluorescent monomeric form. These different forms of JC-1 were then detected by flow cytometry as described by the manufacturer. Analysis of Ceramide Levels in HNSCC Tumor Tissues—The levels of endogenous ceramides in 17 pairs of HNSCC and 10 pairs of nonsquamous head and neck tumor tissues were measured and compared with their paired adjacent noncancerous tissues using LC/MS as described. Unexpectedly, as shown in Fig 1A, the results showed that the total ceramide levels were higher in the HNSCC tumor tissues as compared with their noncancerous tissues (2393 and 1505 pmol/0.5 mg protein, respectively). However, when individual ceramide species were examined in these paired samples (n = 17), the results demonstrated that only C18:0-ceramide was ∼50% lower in HNSCC tumor tissues as compared with their noncancerous counterparts (103 versus 196 pmol/0.5 mg protein), whereas the levels of all the other ceramides were generally higher in HNSCC tumors than their controls (Fig. 1B). When the levels of C18:0-ceramide were further evaluated in each patient sample, the results showed that 12 of 17 patients (70% of the patients, p < 0.01) had significantly lower levels of C18:0-ceramide in their tumor tissues compared with their adjacent noncancerous tissues (Fig. 2A and Table I, patients 1–17).Fig. 2The levels of C18-ceramide in HNSCC tumors as compared with their adjacent normal counterparts. Levels of C18-ceramide in 17 paired (normal versus tumor) tissues obtained from HNSCC patients were examined by LC/MS (A). The expression levels of human LAG1 mRNA in tumor (T) and normal (N) tissues obtained from patient 6 was measured using RT-PCR (B) or Q-PCR (C) and from patient 9 using Q-PCR (D). Lane 1 in B contains molecular weight markers. Statistical analysis of the data was done using Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. The error bars represent the standard deviations, and when not seen, they are smaller than the thickness of the lines on the graphs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate whether decreased levels of C18-ceramide are due to altered expression of hLAG1, a human homologue of mLAG1/mUOG1 that has been shown to specifically increase C18-ceramide generation, total RNA was isolated initially from normal and HNSCC tumor tissues of the patient 6, and then mRNA levels of hLAG1 were examined by RT-PCR and Q-PCR (Fig. 2, B and C, respectively). The results showed that hLAG1 mRNA expression was significantly decreased in the tumor as compared with its adjacent normal tissue (Fig. 2, B, lanes 3 and 2, respectively, and C), and this correlated with the decreased levels of C18-ceramide in the tumor tissue of this patient (Fig. 2A). However, mRNA levels of hLAG1 were similar in both the normal and tumor tissues of patient 9 (Fig. 2D), whose C18-ceramide levels were also comparable in these tissues. These data indicate that C18-ceramide levels might be regulated by the expression of LAG1 at the mRNA level in HNSCC; however, this needs to be determined in a larger cohort of patient samples, when they are available. The levels of C18:0-ceramide in noncancerous tissues obtained from patients with HNSCC were similar (∼11.5 pmol/500 μg protein/sample with a standard deviation of ±4). Therefore, the average level of C18:0-ceramide of these noncancerous tissues was used in the examination of ceramide levels in 15 additional HNSCC tumor tissues for whom matched noncancerous tissues were not available (Fig. 3A and Table I, patients 18–32). The results of the LC/MS analysis showed that 7 of 15 tumor tissues exhibited significantly lower levels of C18:0-ceramide as compared with controls (Fig. 3A and Table I, patients 18–32). Taken together, these results demonstrate that C18:0-ceramide levels are significantly lower in approximately 19 of 32 (∼60% of the patients, p < 0.01) HNSCC tumor tissues (Table I). In addition, the level of C18:0-ceramide in the serum of HNSCC patients were similar to that of their noncancerous head and neck tissues (the average value of C18:0-ceramide in the serum of these patients was ∼10.5 pmol/500 μg protein), suggesting that the amount of this ceramide in the tumor site, and not in the whole blood/serum, may be important for its regulatory roles in the pathogenesis/progression of the HNSCC. Interestingly, in nonsquamous tissues (n = 10), a selective decrease in the levels of C18-ceramide was not detected. Instead, lower levels of C16- and C18-ceramides (lower in 6 of 10 patients; p < 0.05), were observed in the tumor tissues as compared with their adjacent noncancerous tissues (Fig. 3, B and C, respectively, and Table II). Similar results were also observed in nonsquamous cell lung carcinomas, in which significantly reduced levels of C16-, C18-, and C24-ceramides were detected in the majority of the tumors (∼80%) as compared with their adjacent normal lung tissues (n = 10, p < 0.001, data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest an important and novel role for C18-ceramide and LAG1 in the pathogenesis/progression of the HNSCC, whereas in nonsquamous tumors (head and neck, and lung), decreased levels of major ceramides such as C16-, C18-, and C24-ceramides appear to be important. Analysis of the Role of C18:0-ceramide by Overexpression of the mLAG1/mUOG1 cDNA in the Regulation of Cell Growth in UM-SCC-22A Cells—Decreased levels of C18:0-ceramide in the majority of the HNSCC tumor tissues compared with their adjacent noncancerous tissues suggested the hypothesis that although altered levels of C18-ceramide might play important roles in the pathogenesis/progression of HNSCC, its increased generation/accumulation might regulate the growth of HNSCC cells. To test this hypothesis, mLAG1/mUOG1 was overexpressed in the human HNSCC cell line UM-SCC-22A (SCC of the hypopharynx) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Overexpression of mLAG1/mUOG1 was confirmed by Q-PCR (Fig. 4A). This resulted in an increase selectively in the levels of C18-ceramide from ∼6 to 11.5 pmol/0.5 mg protein (Fig. 4B), which are similar to the levels detected in normal head and neck tissues (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the levels of other major ceramides such as C14-, C24-, and dihydro-C16-ceramides (Fig. 4C, left panel) and C16-ceramide (Fig. 4C, right panel) were decreased significantly, when compared with vector-transfected controls. The Effects of mLAG1/mUOG1 on the Regulation of Growth, Telomerase Activity, and Apoptosis—The effects of overexpression of mLAG1/mUOG1 on cell growth were examined using the trypan blue exclusion assay. The results demonstrated that mLAG1/mUOG1 expression caused ∼82% inhibition of cell growth as compared with controls (Fig. 5A). Similar results were also obtained using MTT assays, in which overexpression of mLAG1/mUOG1 resulted in ∼80% decrease in cell growth in these cells (data not shown). Because ceramide is known to mediate the inhibition of telomerase in various human cancer cells (8Ogretmen B. Schady D. Usta J. Wood R. Kraveka J.M. Luberto C. Birbes H. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J.

Gurr U. Wildner G.P. Anal. Cell Pathol. 2002; 24: 25-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 13Patel M.M. Parekh L.J. Jha F.P. Sainger R.N. Patel J.B. Patel D.D. Shah P.M. Patel P.S.

Oncol. 2004; 86: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the role of C18-ceramide in the inhibition of telomerase was examined in UM-SCC-22A cells. The data showed that increased generation of C18-ceramide by mLAG1/mUOG1 resulted in a significant inhibition of telomerase activity (∼50%) when compared with controls (Fig. 5B, lanes 2 and 1, respectively). Interestingly, additional data using Q-PCR indicated that the inhibition of telomerase activity by LAG1/C18-ceramide may not be due to decreased mRNA expression of its catalytic human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) (shown in Fig. 5C) or human telomerase RNA (hTR) subunits (data not shown), suggesting a post-transcriptional regulation. In addition, analysis of cell cycle by flow cytometry showed that mLAG1/mUOG1 significantly increased the number of apoptotic cells in the sub-G0/G1, whereas there were no significant changes in the cell cycle profiles (Fig. 5D). To further evaluate whether mLAG1/mUOG1/C18-ceramide-induced apoptosis involves the mitochondrial death pathway, analysis of mitochondrial potential using JC-1 by flow cytometry was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data showed that mLAG1/mUOG1 expression resulted in a significant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, as determined by increased accumulation of JC-1 (∼39%) as green monomers in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5E), suggesting a role for LAG1/C18-ceramide in mediating the mitochondrial death pathway. To determine whether the role of increased generation of C18:0-ceramide by mLAG1/mUOG1 in the inhibition of growth is cell line-specific, mLAG1/mUOG1 was expressed in another human HNSCC cancer cell line, UM-SCC-1 (squamous cell carcinoma of the floor of the mouth), and the levels of ceramides and its effects on growth were determined using LC/MS and MTT assays, respectively. Expression of mLAG1/mUOG1, confirmed by RT-PCR (Fig. 6A, right panel), resulted in a significant increase (∼6-fold) in the generation of C18:0-ceramide (Fig. 6, A and B), whereas the levels of other ceramides, especially C16-ceramide, were significantly reduced as compared with controls (Fig. 6B, upper and lower panels). Increased levels of C18:0-ceramide in response to mLAG1/mUOG1 overexpression were also accompanied by a significant inhibition of cell growth (∼70%) in these cell lines (Fig. 6C). Thus, these results strongly demonstrate that inhibition of growth by mLAG1/mUOG1 and C18:0-ceramide is not cell line-specific but rather can be detected in other human HNSCC cell lines. The results presented in this study demonstrate that decreased levels of C18:0-ceramide might play a role in the pathogenesis/progression of the HNSCC; on the other hand, in nonsquamous tissues, this selectivity for C18-ceramide was not detected. These results suggest that decreased levels of C18-ceramide may impart a growth advantage to cancer cells, whereas increased generation/accumulation of C18-ceramide may lead to inhibition of growth of HNSCC cells. This was further supported by the data showing that increased generation of C18:0-ceramide via overexpression of mLAG1/mUOG1 results in the inhibition of growth, which involves the modulation of telomerase activity and induction of apoptosis in HNSCC cells. Taken together, these results provide evidence for the role of LAG1 and C18-ceramide in the regulation of telomerase and apoptosis in HNSCC cells. The anti-proliferative roles of endogenous ceramide have been demonstrated in various human cancer cells previously (reviewed in Ref. 7Ogretmen B. Hannun Y.A. Drug Resistance Updates. 2001; 4: 368-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrated that the total ceramide levels are inversely correlated with malignant progression and poor prognosis of astrocytomas (24Riboni L. Campanella R. Bassi R. Villani R. Gaini S.M. Martinelli-Boneschi F. Viani P. Tettamanti G. Glia. 2002; 39: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The results from the present study support these conclusions, and they further provide additional information that the levels of specific ceramide species, such as C18-ceramide, and not total ceramide levels might also be important in the pathogenesis and regulation of cell growth in some carcinomas such as HNSCC. Therefore, the identification of immediate down-stream targets of C18-ceramide, which are involved in the inhibition of cell growth in HNSCC cells, is extremely important and of great interest in our laboratory. In fact, the present study shows that overexpression of mLAG1/mUOG1 results in the inhibition of telomerase activity, which has been shown to be elevated in the majority of HNSCC tumor tissues and not in the normal tissues (12Fabricius E.M. Gurr U. Wildner G.P. Anal. Cell Pathol. 2002; 24: 25-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 13Patel M.M. Parekh L.J. Jha F.P. Sainger R.N. Patel J.B. Patel D.D. Shah P.M. Patel P.S.

Thus, these results support that telomerase is one of the cancer-specific targets of endogenous ceramide. Interestingly, inhibition of telomerase in response to C6-ceramide or daunorubicin was linked to the generation of endogenous C16- and C24-ceramides in the A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells (8Ogretmen B. Schady D. Usta J. Wood R. Kraveka J.M. Luberto C. Birbes H. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24901-24910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This inhibition, however, was mainly due to decreased mRNA expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase and correlated with cell cycle arrest but not apoptosis. However, in HNSCC cells, the inhibition of telomerase activity by LAG1/C18-ceramide pathway appears to be at the post-transcriptional level and correlates with apoptosis. Thus, these data suggest that specific ceramides might have distinct functions in the regulation of telomerase and apoptosis, and these functions might be cell type- or tissue-specific. LAG1 was discovered in yeast, and it has been shown that deletion of LAG1 extends the life span in yeast (17D'mello N.P. Childress A.M. Franklin D.S. Kale S.P. Pinswasdi C. Jazwinski S.M. J. Biol.

The mammalian homologues of yeast LAG1 were later identified in mice, called mammalian upstream of growth and differentiation 1, mUOG1 (19Venkataraman K. Riebeling C. Bodennec J. Riezman H. Allegood J.C. Sullards M.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35642-35649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and in human called human LAG1 (also referred to as LASS1, human longevity assurance homologue 1 of yeast LAG1) (17D'mello N.P. Childress A.M. Franklin D.S. Kale S.P. Pinswasdi C. Jazwinski S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15451-15459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Jazwinski S.M. Conzelmann A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 1491-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The mUOG1 and human LAG1 have been shown to have >80% amino acid homology (20Jiang J.C. Kirchman P.A. Zagulski M. Hunt J. Jazwinski S.M. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 1259-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Further studies showed that the biological activities of LAG member genes encode essential components of acyl-CoA-dependent (dihydro)-ceramide synthase (18Schorling S. Vallee B. Barz W.P. Riezman H. Oesterhelt D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3417-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mUOG1 has been shown to be involved in the synthesis of C18 (stearic acid) containing sphingolipids, including C18:0-ceramide (19Venkataraman K. Riebeling C. Bodennec J. Riezman H. Allegood J.C. Sullards M.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35642-35649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). However, the role for these LAG member proteins in the regulation of cell growth in mammals has not been shown previously. Therefore, our results presented here demonstrate that LAG1/C18-ceramide is involved in the regulation of cell growth in UM-SCC-22A and UM-SCC-1 cells. Interestingly, our data demonstrated that the levels of C16-ceramide is significantly up-regulated in HNSCC tumors as compared with their normal adjacent tissues. In parallel with these findings, the level of C16-ceramide is greatly reduced upon mLAG1/mUOG1 overexpression and increased generation of C18-ceramide in HNSCC cells (see Figs. 4 and 6). These results are surprising, because the role for increased C16-ceramide in apoptosis upon induction by IgM via de novo pathway in Jurkat cells, or in cell cycle arrest and the inhibition of telomerase activity in the A549 nonsquamous lung cancer cells, has been demonstrated previously (10Ogretmen B. Pettus B.J. Rossi M.J. Wood R. Usta J. Szulc Z. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 13606-13614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Therefore, determining the possible relationship, if any, between increased levels of C16-ceramide in HNSCC tumors and its decreased levels in response to mLAG1/mUOG1 expression in HNSCC cell lines is important and needs to be further explored. In light of this, specific downstream targets and subcellular localization/compartmentalization of these ceramides (C16- and C18-ceramides) might be involved in their distinct functions for the regulation of growth or apoptosis in various different types of cancer cells, and this is of great interest in our laboratories. It is also known that increased ceramide generation in response to various stress stimuli including radiation and chemotherapeutic agents can result in the inhibition of growth of various cancer cells (28Chalfant C.E.

Treatment of the Tu138 human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells with paclitaxel and C6-ceramide in combination synergistically inhibited cell growth (31Mehta S. Blackinton D. Omar I. Kouttab N. Myrick D. Klostergaard J. Wanebo H. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2000; 46: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), demonstrating a role for ceramide in the treatment of head and neck cancer cells in vitro. However, the clinical relevance of ceramide in HNSCC is still unknown. The results also indicate that the use of LC/MS (9Kraveka J.M. Li L. Bielawski J. Obeid L.M. Ogretmen B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 419: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 32Sullards M.C. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 32-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Pettus B.J. Kroesen B.J. Szulc Z.M.

Mass Spectrom. 2004; 18: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which can identify the levels of different ceramide species in a given sample, is a powerful tool to discover the roles for specific ceramide species (with different fatty acid chain length) in the pathogenesis of various carcinomas including HNSCC. In fact, metabolomic profiling of sphingolipids in human glioma cell lines have been performed previously (34Sullards M.C. Wang E. Peng Q. Merrill Jr., A.H. Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 49: 789-797PubMed Google Scholar). The results have shown that different glioma cell lines had differences in the amounts and types of sphingolipids, and the fatty acyl chain distributions of sphingolipids were also different among these cell lines (34Sullards M.C. Wang E. Peng Q. Merrill Jr., A.H. Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 49: 789-797PubMed Google Scholar). It is also interesting that our results specifically showed decreased levels of C18-ceramide selectively in the squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck tissues, whereas lower levels of C16- and C18-ceramides were detected in nonsquamous head and neck tumor tissues. The association of lower C18-ceramides, if any, with prognosis and/or survival in these patients with HNSCC could not be examined because of the high grades of the tumors and the lack of follow up information about the patients for a longer period of time. The clinical importance of C18-ceramide in overall survival and prognosis in HNSCC needs to be determined in studies with a larger cohort of patients."

https://openalex.org/W1981068296,"Seawater dissolved organic matter (DOM) is the largest reservoir of exchangeable organic carbon in the ocean, comparable in quantity to atmospheric carbon dioxide. The composition, turnover times and fate of all but a few planktonic constituents of this material are, however, largely unknown. Models of ocean carbon cycling are thus limited by the need for information on temporal scales of carbon storage in DOM subcomponents, produced via the 'biological pump', relative to their recycling by bacteria. Here we show that carbohydrate- and protein-like substances in the open Atlantic and Pacific oceans, though often significantly aged, comprise younger fractions of the DOM, whereas dissolved lipophilic material exhibits up to approximately 90 per cent fossil character. In contrast to the millennial mean ages of DOM observed throughout the water column, weighted mean turnover times of DOM in the surface ocean are only decadal in magnitude. An observed size-age continuum further demonstrates that small dissolved molecules are the most highly aged forms of organic matter, cycling much more slowly than larger, younger dissolved and particulate precursors, and directly links oceanic organic matter age and size with reactivity."

https://openalex.org/W2066389184,"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors induce growth arrest and apoptosis in a variety of human cancer cells. Sodium butyrate (NaB), a short chain fatty acid, is a HDAC inhibitor and is produced in the colonic lumen as a consequence of microbial degradation of dietary fibers. In order to dissect out the mechanism of NaB-induced growth inhibition of cancer cells, we carried out expression profiling of a human lung carcinoma cell line (H460) treated with NaB using a cDNA microarray. Of the total 1728 genes analysed, there were 32 genes with a mean expression value of 2.0-fold and higher and 66 genes with a mean expression value 3.0-fold and lower in NaB-treated cells. For a few selected genes, we demonstrate that their expression pattern by semiquantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) analysis is matching with the results obtained by microarray analysis. Closer view at the expression profile of NaB-treated cells revealed the downregulation of a total of 16 genes associated with cytokine signaling, in particular, interferon γ (IFNγ) pathway. In good correlation, NaB-pretreated cells failed to induce interferon regulatory factor 1, an INFγ target gene, efficiently upon IFNγ addition. These results suggest that NaB inhibits proinflammatory cytokine signaling pathway, thus providing proof of mechanism for its anti-inflammatory activity. We also found that NaB induced three genes, which are known metastatic suppressors, and downregulated 11 genes, which have been shown to promote metastasis. Upregulation of metastatic suppressor Kangai 1 (KAI1) by NaB in a time-dependent manner was confirmed by RT–PCR analysis. The differential regulation of metastasis-associated genes by NaB provides explanation for the anti-invasive properties of NaB. Therefore, our study presents new evidence for pathways regulated by NaB, thus providing evidence for the mechanism behind anti-inflammatory and antimetastatic activities of NaB."
https://openalex.org/W2075819408,"Defensins are cationic antimicrobial peptides that have a characteristic six-cysteine motif and are important components of the innate immune system. We recently described a β-defensin-related peptide (Defr1) that had potent antimicrobial activity despite having only five cysteines. Here we report a relationship between the structure and activity of Defr1 through a comparative study with its six cysteine-containing analogue (Defr1 Y5C). Against a panel of pathogens, we found that oxidized Defr1 had significantly higher activity than its reduced form and the oxidized and reduced forms of Defr1 Y5C. Furthermore, Defr1 displayed activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of 150 mm NaCl, whereas Defr1 Y5C was inactive. By using nondenaturing gel electrophoresis and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, we observed Defr1 and Defr1 Y5C dimers. Two complementary fragmentation techniques (collision-induced dissociation and electron capture dissociation) revealed that Defr1 Y5C dimers form by noncovalent, weak association of monomers that contain three intramolecular disulfide bonds. In contrast, Defr1 dimers are resistant to collision-induced dissociation and are only dissociated into monomers by reduction using electron capture. This is indicative of Defr1 dimerization being mediated by an intermolecular disulfide bond. Proteolysis and peptide mass mapping revealed that Defr1 Y5C monomers have β-defensin disulfide bond connectivity, whereas oxidized Defr1 is a complex mixture of dimeric isoforms with as yet unknown inter- and intramolecular connectivities. Each isoform contains one intermolecular and four intramolecular disulfide bonds, but because we were unable to resolve the isoforms by reverse phase chromatography, we could not assign each isoform with a specific antimicrobial activity. We conclude that the enhanced activity and stability of this mixture of Defr1 dimeric isoforms are due to the presence of an intermolecular disulfide bond. This first description of a covalently cross-linked member of the defensin family provides further evidence that the antimicrobial activity of a defensin is linked to its ability to form stable higher order structures.

This first description of a covalently cross-linked member of the defensin family provides further evidence that the antimicrobial activity of a defensin is linked to its ability to form stable higher order structures. β-Defensins are members of the antimicrobial peptide family that are important components of the mammalian innate immune response (1Zasloff M. Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6575) Google Scholar, 2Ganz T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (2272) Google Scholar). In addition to potent bactericidal activity, they can also act upon T lymphocytes and immature dendritic cells thus playing key roles in adaptive immunity (3Yang D. Biragyn A. Hoover D.M. Lubkowski J. Oppenheim J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 181-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). They are produced as prepropeptides and are processed to a mature secreted peptide, which have six canonical cysteine residues with spacing and intramolecular disulfide bridge connectivity (Cys1–Cys5, Cys2–Cys4, and Cys3–Cys6) distinct from the similar α-defensins (4Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). A recent bioinformatic analysis of the human and mouse genomes revealed a significantly higher number of β-defensin genes than previously thought, although the function of each individual defensin has still to be determined in vivo (5Schutte B.C. Mitros J.P. Bartlett J.A. Walters J.D. Jia H.P. Welsh M.J. Casavant T.L. McCray P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Two strong lines of evidence have demonstrated the significance of the antimicrobial activity of defensins in vivo. First, it was demonstrated that deleting the gene that encodes the enzyme matrilysin, which processes α-defensins in gut paneth cells, resulted in mice where orally administered bacteria survived in greater numbers and were more virulent (6Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Stratman J.L. Hultgren S.J. Matrisian L.M. Parks W.C. Science. 1999; 286: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Second, a human α-defensin gene expressed in mice resulted in transgenic animals that were markedly resistant to oral challenge with the virulent Salmonella typhimurium (7Salzman N.H. Ghosh D. Huttner K.M. Paterson Y. Bevins C.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). In addition, mice that are deficient in the β-defensin 1 gene have a phenotype consistent with a defect in microbial resistance (8Moser C. Weiner D.J. Lysenko E. Bals R. Weiser J.N. Wilson J.M. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3068-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The mature peptides of defensins are 30–45 amino acids in length and are amphipathic, i.e. they have discrete cationic and hydrophobic patches. Their net positive surface charge implies an initial electrostatic interaction between the peptide and negatively charged components of the bacterial cell wall, e.g. lipopolysaccharide or teichoic acid (9Hancock R.E.W. Chapple D.S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1317-1323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, reduction of the negative charge of these molecules by enzymatic covalent modification has been observed in antimicrobial peptide-resistant bacterial strains (10Peschel A. Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 179-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism of how defensins bind and disrupt the bacteria membrane is still the subject of intensive study, but it appears that active peptides must display an appropriate balance of hydrophobicity and net positive charge (11Shai Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar, 12Shai Y. Biopolymers. 2002; 66: 236-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the conserved disulfide bridges impart a structural core, and nonconserved residues on the surface are under selective pressure against rapidly evolving bacteria (13Morrison G.M. Semple C.A. Kilanowski F.M. Hill R.E. Dorin J.R. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2003; 20: 460-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 14Semple C.A. Rolfe M. Dorin J.R.

However, chemotactic properties of this peptide are dependent on disulfide bond formation. In another study, Nagaraj and co-workers (16Mandal M. Hagannadham M.V. Nagaraj R. Peptides. 2002; 23: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) showed peptide fragments of bovine neutrophil β-defensin BNBD-2 had antibacterial activities that were independent of the number and location of the disulfide bridges. Subdivision of the defensin family into the well known α- and β-classifications is based on gene organization, cysteine spacing, and disulfide bond connectivity (17Selsted M.E. Harwig S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4003-4007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Tang Y.Q. Selsted M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6649-6653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was hoped that structural studies would provide explanations for their diverse cellular properties, and over 10 years ago a crystallographic study of the human α-defensin hNP3 revealed that it forms a dimer containing a six-stranded β-sheet region (19Hill C.P. Yee J. Selsted M.E. Eisenberg D. Science. 1991; 251: 1481-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The first human β-defensin crystal structure was recently determined from two crystallographic forms of HBD2 (20Hoover D.M. Rajashankar K.R. Blumenthal R. Puri A. Oppenheim J.J. Chertov O. Lubkowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32911-32918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The monomer in each form had a central, three-stranded β-sheet fold, similar to the α-defensins, as well as a small α-helix at the N terminus. In one crystal form, monomers associated noncovalently into dimers by interaction of the first β-sheet of each monomer, and in the second form, HBD2 octamers were observed within the crystallographic unit cell. In contrast, the x-ray structure of the HBD1 monomer was very similar to the HBD2 monomer, but there was no evidence of higher order oligomerization (21Hoover D.M. Chertov O. Lubkowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39021-39026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that in the more dynamic environment posed by NMR, there is little indication of HBD1, HBD2, or BNBD-12 dimers or other higher order aggregate formation (22Sawai M.V. Jia H.P.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13663-13671Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In contrast, the observation of higher order structures of HBD3 by native gel electrophoresis coupled with the significant downfield NMR chemical shifts of charged residues allowed modeling of an HBD3 dimer mediated by noncovalent electrostatic interactions between residues on the second β-sheet (25Schibli D.J. Hunter H.N. Aseyev V. Starner T.D. Wiencek J.M. McCray P.B. Tack B.F. Vogel H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8279-8289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). To rationalize these observed structural differences across the family, we believe it is imperative to explore the effect of quaternary structure on the biological activity of β-defensins. We recently described a murine β-defensin gene in C57Bl6 mice that encoded a peptide with only five cysteine residues (Fig. 1, Defr1) but retained potent antimicrobial activity (26Morrison G.M. Rolfe M. Kilanowski F.M. Cross S.H. Dorin J.R. Mamm. Genome. 2002; 13: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This gene is a variant allele of Defb8 that encodes six cysteines and is found in all other inbred murine strains we have tested (27Maxwell A.I. Morrison G.M. Dorin J.R. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 40: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this study we describe striking differences between the antimicrobial properties of Defr1 in comparison with its six-cysteine analogue, Defr1 Y5C, against a panel of bacterial pathogens. We have attempted to rationalize these observations by investigating the structure of both peptides by using a combination of analytical techniques, and we reveal the presence of a novel structural feature in Defr1 that has not been observed previously in any other defensin. Materials—Defr1 and Defr1 Y5C were chemically synthesized by the standard solid phase methodology (Albachem Ltd.) and were refolded and oxidized in air as described previously (26Morrison G.M. Rolfe M. Kilanowski F.M. Cross S.H. Dorin J.R. Mamm. Genome. 2002; 13: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Antimicrobial Activity Assays—The strains of microbes used in this study are as follows: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, and Candida albicans J2922. Test organisms were grown to mid-logarithmic phase in Iso-Sensitest broth (Oxoid) growth media and then diluted to 1–5 × 106 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml in 10 mm potassium phosphate containing 1% (v/v) Iso-Sensitest broth, pH 7.4. Different concentrations of test peptide were incubated in 100 μl of cells (1–5 × 105 CFU) at 37 °C for 1 h. 10-Fold serial dilutions of the incubation mixture were plated on Iso-Sensitest plates, incubated at 37 °C, and the CFU determined the following day. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) is the concentration of peptide where we observed >99.99% killing of the initial inoculum. All assays were performed in duplicate and repeated on two independent occasions. The MBC was obtained by taking the mean of all the results, and experimental errors were within one doubling dilution. Reduction of the peptides was performed by adding 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and incubating at room temperature overnight. The oxidation state of each peptide prior to performing antimicrobial assays was determined by mass spectrometry. The effect of salt on antimicrobial activity was tested by incubating 100 μlof1–5 × 105 CFU of bacteria in 10 mm potassium phosphate, 1% (v/v) Iso-Sensitest, pH 7.4, which contained various concentrations of NaCl (0–300 mm). The bacteria were then challenged with peptide at a concentration four times the MBC. Native Gel Electrophoresis—Electrophoresis of Defr1 and Defr1 Y5C was performed under reduced and nonreduced conditions. 5 μg of peptide was dissolved in 10 μl of 0.01% acetic acid and 10 μl of 2× sample buffer (NOVEX Tricine/SDS sample buffer LC1676). Reduction of samples was performed by adding 2 μl of 500 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and incubating at room temperature for 1 h. The entire sample was loaded on a 16% Tricine gel (Invitrogen). The gel was fixed and stained with GelCode Blue Stain reagent (Pierce), and quantification of the bands was carried out by using ImageMaster TotalLab 1D software on an ImageMaster VD5 VD5-CC (Amersham Biosciences). Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectrometry analysis was conducted on several instruments. Characterization of the oxidation state of the synthetic peptides Defr1 and Defr1 Y5C was performed initially by using the accurate mass capabilities of a 9.4 Tesla Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) equipped with a nanospray source. Any minor partially reduced species was removed by acetylation and separation. Using this instrument, two dissociation methods were applied to isolated peptides. For sustained off resonance irradiation collision-induced dissociation (SORI-CID), a given charge state was isolated by sweep excitation and subjected to CID with argon as the collision gas for 500 ms. For electron capture dissociation (ECD), a given charge state was isolated by sweep excitation and subjected to electron irradiation for 50 ms using a barium oxide-coated high surface area (5 mm diameter) dispenser cathode (HeatWave, Watsonville, CA) This instrument was also utilized to determine the time scale necessary for full reduction of the peptides. The electrospray solution and source conditions were the same for accurate mass, SORI-CID, and ECD. All peptide samples were made up to a concentration of 50 μm with MeOH/H2O/CH3COOH (50:49:1 v/v). Solutions were ionized by nano-electrospray from gold/palladium-coated tips (Proxeon Biosystems). Ions were accumulated in a hexapole and transferred to the detection cell of the FT-ICR instrument. The predicted isotopic abundance was determined using published methods within the XMASS software (28He F. Hendrickson C.L. Marshall A.G. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 11: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Prior to antimicrobial assays, the oxidation state of the peptides was confirmed using a Micromass Platform II single quadrapole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ion source. Following our initial experiments on the FT-ICR, the platform had sufficient resolution to confirm that the peptides were fully oxidized or fully reduced. The spectrometer cone voltage was ramped from 40 to 70 V, and the source temperature was set to 140 °C. Protein samples were separated with a Waters HPLC 2690 with a Phenomenex C5 reverse phase column (5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm) directly connected to the spectrometer. The proteins were eluted from the column with a 5–95% acetonitrile (containing 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid) gradient at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The total ion count in the range 500–2000 m/z was scanned at 0.1-s intervals. The scans were accumulated and spectra combined, and the molecular mass was determined by the MaxEnt and Transform algorithms of the Mass Lynx software (MicroMass). Determination of Disulfide Bridges in Defr1 and Defr1 Y5C—The peptide mass mapping for Defr1 and Defr1 Y5C was conducted by using a MALDI-TOF (Tof-Spec 2E, Micromass, UK). Enzymatic digestion of Defr1 (500 μg/ml) with trypsin (100 μg/ml) and chymotrypsin (100 μg/ml) was performed at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm CaCl2, pH 8.2, and allowed to proceed for 4 h before termination by addition of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. For analysis of the reduced proteolytic digest, 1 μl of the peptide mixture was removed and reduced with 100 mm TCEP. For MALDI-MS analysis, oxidized and reduced peptide digests were desalted and concentrated using C18 ZipTips (Millipore Corp.). 1 μl of analyte and 1 μl of matrix solution (a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) were mixed and left to air-dry on a MALDI plate, and MALDI-MS results were obtained in the positive mode. For analysis of Defr1 Y5C, peptide of concentration 500 μg/ml was digested with trypsin (100 μg/ml). The reaction was performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1% sodium azide, 5 mm EDTA, pH 6.2, and was allowed to proceed for 4 h at 37°C before termination by addition of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Cleavage products were separated by HPLC using a Phenomenex C18 Jupiter column (5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm) and a 10–35% acetonitrile gradient, and the two major species were collected and freeze-dried. The resulting peptides were reconstituted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm CaCl2, pH 8.2, and each was split into 3 aliquots. The 1st aliquot was analyzed in its oxidized state; the 2nd aliquot was reduced with 20 mm TCEP; and the 3rd aliquot was digested with chymotrypsin (100 μg/ml) for 4 h at 37°C. All samples were purified and concentrated using C18 ZipTips and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS as described above. CID sequence analysis of the digested peptides was performed by using a Q-TOF tandem mass spectrometer (Micromass, UK) equipped with a nanospray source. Specific ions were mass selected by the quadrupole MS and subjected to CID using argon, and the resulting fragments were analyzed in the TOF MS. HPLC—Analytical HPLC was performed on a Beckman System Gold HPLC equipped with a Phenomenex C18 Jupiter column (5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm). The solvents used were water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent B) at 1 ml/min. Both oxidized and reduced Defr1 and Defr1 Y5C were analyzed using a linear gradient of 20–35% solvent B developed over 40 min. Peptides were detected at 215 and 280 nm. Antimicrobial Properties—In a previous study we showed that despite having only five cysteine residues, murine Defr1 displayed antimicrobial activity at nanomolar concentrations (26Morrison G.M. Rolfe M. Kilanowski F.M. Cross S.H. Dorin J.R. Mamm. Genome. 2002; 13: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Here we synthesized the six-cysteine analogue, Defr1 Y5C, and have determined the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of the oxidized and reduced forms of both peptides against a diverse panel of clinically relevant microbes (Table I). Numerous methods have been used in various laboratories to determine the antimicrobial activities of defensins (for example see Refs. 9Hancock R.E.W. Chapple D.S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1317-1323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wu Z. Hoover D.M. Yang D. Boulegue C. Santamaria F. Oppenheim J.J. Lubkowski J. Lu W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Typically, the test organism is exposed to the peptide (0–24 h), followed by growth on liquid or solid media and subsequent determination of optical densities and/or counting of surviving colonies relative to a control. Antimicrobial activities (μg/ml) are quoted as minimal inhibitory concentrations, MBCs, and LD50 or LD90 values (dose required to kill 50 or 90% bacteria). At the outset we incubated P. aeruginosa PAO1 with peptides for 0, 1, 4 and 24 h and noted that the MBCs (99.99% bacteria killed) were the same for each time point, indicating that the peptides killed within an hour of administration. We therefore carried all the reported assays with a 1-h incubation time.Table IAntimicrobial activity of oxidized and reduced (red) Defr1 and Defr1 Y5COrganismStrainMBCaMBC values are the minimum concentration required to kill 99.99% of initial inoculum.Defr1Defr1 Y5CDefr1 (red)Defr1 Y5C (red)μg/mlGram-negativeP. aeruginosaPAO165050100E. coliATCC 259228100>10050Gram-positiveS. aureusATCC 2592310>100>100>100E. faecalisATCC 292126100>100NDbND, not determined.FungiC. albicansJ29223252550a MBC values are the minimum concentration required to kill 99.99% of initial inoculum.b ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Defr1 exhibited broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, with MBCs ranging from 3 to 10 μg/ml against all organisms tested. These included the Gram-negative bacteria P. aeruginosa and E. coli as well as the Gram-positives S. aureus and E. faecalis. Defr1 also displayed antifungal activity against C. albicans. In contrast, the six-cysteine analogue Defr1 Y5C displayed MBCs in the range 50–100 μg/ml against Gram-negative bacteria, ≥100 μg/ml against Gram-positive bacteria, and 25 μg/ml antifungal activity. The increased MBCs of Defr1 Y5C compared with Defr1 highlight a significant increase in potency for the five-cysteine variant. Recent work by Wu et al. (15Wu Z. Hoover D.M. Yang D. Boulegue C. Santamaria F. Oppenheim J.J. Lubkowski J. Lu W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8880-8885Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that the activity of HBD3 is independent of the number and connectivity of disulfide bridges within the molecule. To test this hypothesis we repeated the antimicrobial assays with both peptides after complete reduction with excess DTT. Reduced Defr1 Y5C had similar MBCs to its oxidized form, supporting the hypothesis that its activity is independent of the presence of disulfide bonds. However, the MBCs of reduced Defr1 were significantly higher than its oxidized form and similar to the MBCs for Defr1 Y5C. Thus, in this instance, it appears that the presence of disulfide bonds does influence the antimicrobial activity of the five-cysteine containing peptide. For further comparison we also analyzed the effect of high salt concentrations on the antimicrobial activities of Defr1 and Defr1 Y5C against P. aeruginosa (Fig. 2). The activity of Defr1 Y5C was extremely salt-sensitive, killing only 10% of 1 × 105 bacteria in the presence of 25 mm NaCl and being completely inactive at 50 mm NaCl. In contrast, Defr1 displayed 100% killing at 25 and 50 mm NaCl, 84% killing at 150 mm NaCl, and 28% killing even at 300 mm NaCl. These salt sensitivity results further highlight the significant differences between the anti-microbial activity of the six-cysteine and the five-cysteine Defr1 peptides. Structural Analysis—To rationalize the striking differences that we observed in antimicrobial activity between Defr1 and Defr1 Y5C, we investigated the structure of the two peptides by a combination of native gel electrophoresis, high resolution mass spectrometry, and reverse phase chromatography. One advantage of using FT-ICR MS for studying defensin structure is that only microgram amounts of each peptide are required for analysis in contrast to both NMR and x-ray crystallography. Native Gel Electrophoresis—To analyze the structure of Defr1 and Defr1 Y5C, they were subjected to nondenaturing electrophoresis on 16% Tricine gels (Fig. 3). In their oxidized forms, the predominant forms of both peptides migrated with apparent molecular masses of ∼7 kDa, which suggests that they can dimerize under these conditions. Reduction of both peptides with excess DTT increased their apparent mobility to ∼4 kDa, which indicates they are present as monomers and that disulfide bonds are involved in maintaining their tertiary structure. Densitometry analysis of the stained gel gave the following monomer/dimer ratios for each of the peptides: Defr1-reduced (Fig. 3, lane 1), monomer/dimer (2:1); Defr1-oxidized (lane 2), monomer/dimer (1:5); Defr1 Y5C reduced (Fig. 3, lane 3), monomer/dimer (>100:1); Defr1 Y5C-oxidized (Fig. 3, lane 4), monomer/dimer (1:6). It is interesting to note the observation of significant amounts of Defr1 dimer even after incubation with DTT, which suggests increased stability of the Defr1 dimer over the Defr1 Y5C dimer under reducing conditions. Previous studies on various antimicrobial peptides have revealed that some, but not all, can dimerize. For example, HBD3 is a potent antimicrobial peptide isolated from human skin, which has been the subject of intensive structural and functional studies (29Harder J. Bartels J. Christophers E. Schröder J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5707-5713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). By native gel electrophoresis, dimeric HBD3 was observed under oxidizing conditions, whereas monomeric HBD3 was detected after reduction (25Schibli D.J. Hunter H.N. Aseyev V. Starner T.D.

Modeling studies predict that the dimer is formed through a combination of electrostatic salt bridges and H-bonding between amino side chains. Octomers, formed by amide backbone interactions, have also been observed in the crystal lattice of HBD2 (20Hoover D.M. Rajashankar K.R. Blumenthal R. Puri A. Oppenheim J.J. Chertov O. Lubkowski J. J.

NCAM and, in particular, PSA play important roles in cellular and synaptic plasticity. Here we investigated whether PSA modulates the activity of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) subtype of glutamate receptors (AMPA-Rs). Single channel recordings of affinity-purified AMPA-Rs reconstituted in lipid bilayers revealed that bacterially derived PSA, called colominic acid, prolonged the open channel time of AMPA-R-mediated currents by severalfold and altered the bursting pattern of the receptor channels but did not modify AMPA-R single channel conductance. This effect was reversible, concentration-dependent, and specific, since monomers of sialic acid and another negatively charged carbohydrate, chondroitin sulfate, did not potentiate single channel AMPA-R currents. Recombinant PSA-NCAM also potentiated currents mediated by reconstituted AMPA-Rs. In pyramidal neurons acutely isolated from the CA1 region of the early postnatal hippocampus, l-glutamate or AMPA (applied in the presence of antagonists blocking voltage-gated Na+ and K+ currents and N-methyl-d-aspartate and metabotropic glutamate receptors) induced inward currents, which were significantly increased by co-application of colominic acid. Chondroitin sulfate did not affect AMPA-R-mediated currents in CA1 neurons. The effect of colominic acid was age-dependent, since in pyramidal neurons from adult hippocampus, colominic acid failed to potentiate glutamate responses. Thus, our study demonstrates age-dependent potentiation of AMPA receptors by PSA via a mechanism probably involving direct PSA-AMPA-R interactions.

AMPA-Rs have received considerable attention due to their involvement in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. During this process, insertion of new AMPA-Rs and their posttranslational modifications may go hand-in-hand with structural modifications of synapses (12Luscher C. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. Muller D.

Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 640-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). PSA is a highly negatively charged homomeric polymer of sialic acid that can form an unusual α2,8-linkage in chains that can be up to 200 residues long. This polymer is predominantly carried by the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and modulates its functions during cell migration and axonal outgrowth (see Ref. 13Kiss J.Z. Rougon G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 640-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar for a review). Furthermore, delivery of PSA-NCAM to the cell surface in neurons and endocrine cells is activity-dependent (14Kiss J.Z. Wang C. Olive S. Rougon G. Lang J. Baetens D. Harry D. Pralong W.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5284-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 15Muller D. Wang C. Skibo G. Toni G. Cremer H. Calaora V. Rougon G. Kiss J.Z. Neuron. 1996; 17: 413-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Both NCAM protein backbone and PSA are expressed pre- and postsynaptically in a subset of spine synapses, as visualized by immunoelectron microscopy (16Schuster T. Krug M. Stalder M. Hackel N. Gerardy-Schahn R. Schachner M. J. Neurobiol. 2001; 49: 142-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of PSA-NCAM can be cleaved by the tissue plasminogen activator-plasmin system at the cell surface so that it becomes a soluble molecule (17Endo A. Nagai N. Urano T. Ihara H. Takada Y. Hashimoto K. Takada A. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 246: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18Hoffman K.B. Larson J. Bahr B.A. Lynch G. Brain Res. 1998; 811: 152-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The concentration of soluble NCAM is increased 10-fold after induction of long term potentiation in the dentate gyrus (19Fazeli M.S. Breen K. Errington M.L. Bliss T.V. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 169: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Several other observations provide strong evidence that PSA is required for long term potentiation and depression in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (20Becker C.G. Artola A. Gerardy-Schahn R.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5234-5244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying an increase in synaptic efficacy during long term potentiation in this region probably involve changes in the number and functional properties of AMPA-Rs (23Barria A. Muller D. Derkach V. Griffith L.C. Soderling T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 24Benke T.A. Luthi A. Isaac J.T. Collingridge G.L.

In this context, we set out to test the effects of bacterially derived PSA, colominic acid, on the activity of purified AMPA-Rs reconstituted in artificial lipid bilayers. This technique was used, since it allowed us to address the possibility of a direct modulation of AMPA receptors by PSA. Our single channel recordings in lipid bilayers demonstrate that colominic acid can dramatically prolong AMPA-R channel open time and increase its bursting activity. Colominic acid also increased AMPA-R currents in immature but not in mature CA1 pyramidal cells. Thus, our data reveal an age-dependent interaction between PSA and AMPA-Rs that may modulate neuronal transmission and plasticity in the developing central nervous system. Purification of AMPA Receptors—Membrane fractions were prepared according to methods described elsewhere (27Bahr B.A. Vodyanoy V. Hall R.A. Suppiramaniam V. Kessler M. Sumikawa K. Lynch G. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1979-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Brains from adult Sprague-Dawley rats were homogenized in 0.32 m sucrose, 5 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20 μg/ml N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethylketone (Sigma); 40 μg/ml calpain inhibitor I (Calbiochem); 1 mg/ml leupeptin (Chemicon, San Diego, CA); and 35 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Chemicon; added fresh) (pH 7.4, 4 °C). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,090 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged again at 14,600 × g for 20 min. The pellet was lysed in 10 mm Tris in the presence of the protease inhibitors described above, at pH 8.1, 4 °C, for 60 min and successively centrifuged at 11,400 × g with 10-min resuspension cycles. Final pellets were resuspended in buffer A (30 mm HEPES, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.4). Membrane Solubilization—Lysed membranes (1.5 mg of protein/ml) were solubilized in ice-cold buffer A with 4% (w/v) n-octyl-α-d-glucopyranoside, 10% (w/v) glycerol, and 0.12% (w/v) phosphatidylcholine (PC). The suspension was homogenized in an etched glass Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder for 30 s at high speed and then placed on ice for 1 h. After centrifugation at 50,400 × g for 40 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was stored at –80 °C. Receptor Purification—AMPA-Rs were partially purified by a sequence of chromatographic steps: DEAE anion exchange, wheat germ lectin affinity, and polyethyleneimine anion exchange as described below. Solubilized membranes were diluted with an equal volume of buffer A with 10% glycerol and applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated at 4 °C with buffer A containing 1% n-octyl-α-d-glucopyranoside, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% PC (buffer B). After the column was washed with 3 column volumes of buffer B at a flow rate of 2 ml/min, AMPA-Rs were eluted with a 500-ml linear salt gradient from 0 to 2000 mm KSCN in buffer B. The AMPA-R fractions were applied at a 1 ml/min flow rate to a wheat germ lectin affinity column in buffer B containing 0.1 m NaCl. The column was washed, and AMPA-Rs were eluted with 0.7 mN-acetylglucosamine in buffer B. An aliquot of AMPA-Rs was injected into the HPLC polyethyleneimine column in buffer B with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After wash with buffer B and a linear salt gradient from 0 to 350 mm KSCN, fractions were tested with anti-GluR1 immunoblotting (28Bahr B.A. Hoffman K.B. Kessler M. Hennegriff M. Park G.Y. Yamamoto R.S. Kawasaki B.T. Vanderklish P.W. Hall R.A. Lynch G. Neuroscience. 1996; 74: 707-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and the most GluR1-enriched fractions were pooled. Finally, equal volumes of buffer A were added to portions of each AMPA-R pool to dilute the n-octyl-α-d-glucopyranoside to 0.5%, and pure PC (1 mg/ml) and phosphatidylserine (50 μg/ml) were added. AMPA-Rs were immunoprecipitated from the solubilized membranes with anti-GluR1 antibodies, as previously described (28Bahr B.A. Hoffman K.B. Kessler M. Hennegriff M. Park G.Y. Yamamoto R.S. Kawasaki B.T. Vanderklish P.W. Hall R.A. Lynch G. Neuroscience. 1996; 74: 707-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Anti-GluR1 antibodies, covalently cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma), were incubated with solubilized membranes for 6–8 h at 4 °C. The immobilized receptors were washed thoroughly in 30 mm Tris, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100; extracted from the immunosupport with diethylamine/deoxycholate at pH 11.5; and immediately neutralized with 0.5 m Tris, pH 6. Purity of the preparation was verified by silver staining and Western blotting. The purified AMPA-Rs retained many of the properties of the receptors in their native membrane microenvironment (27Bahr B.A. Vodyanoy V. Hall R.A. Suppiramaniam V. Kessler M. Sumikawa K. Lynch G. J.

Like native AMPA receptors, reconstituted purified AMPA receptors are activated by glutamate and AMPA, although with higher affinity. They are potentiated by ampakine and blocked by CNQX. The open channel probability obtained for purified receptors is similar to that observed in native retinal cells, and their conductance corresponds to maximal conductances characteristic of native AMPA receptors (31Morkve S.H. Veruki M.L. Hartveit E. J. Physiol. 2002; 542: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 32Smith T.C. Wang L.Y. Howe J.R. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2073-2085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Production and Purification of PSA-NCAM-Fc—Mouse PSA-NCAM-Fc was produced according to Vutskits et al. (33Vutskits L. Djebbara-Hannas Z. Zhang H. Paccaud J.P. Durbec P. Rougon G. Muller D. Kiss J.Z. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a stably transfected TE671 cell line kindly provided by Dr. G. Rougon (Laboratoire de Genetique et Physiologie du Developpement, Marseille, France). Coomassie staining and Western blotting of purified molecules showed a single broad band with a molecular mass above 200 kDa that is immunopositive with NCAM and PSA antibodies (Fig. 1A). Acute Isolation of Hippocampal Neurons—Hippocampal neurons were freshly isolated as previously reported (34Weber M. Dietrich D. Gräsel I. Reuter G. Seifert G. Steinhäuser C. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1108-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 35Seifert G. Zhou M. Dietrich D. Schumacher T.B. Dybek A. Weiser T. Wienrich M. Wilhelm D. Steinhäuser C. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 931-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, FVB mice or Wistar rats (1–4 days old or 2 months old) were anesthetized and decapitated, and frontal brain slices of 300-μm thickness were cut with a vibratome (FTB, Plano, Marburg, Germany) in a solution containing 90 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 90 mm sucrose (4 °C, pH 7.4). Subsequently, slices were allowed to recover for at least 30 min in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (35 °C, pH adjusted to 7.4 by gassing with carbogen). Artificial cerebrospinal fluid contained 132 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 20 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm glucose. For enzymatic treatment, slices were transferred into a Pronase on PG1 (1–2 mg/ml)-supplemented HEPES-buffered solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES (O2 aeration). Incubation time varied between 5 and 6 min at 35 °C (juvenile mice) and 20 min at 35 °C plus 10 min at room temperature (21–24 °C, adult). After wash, the stratum pyramidale of the CA1 region of the hippocampus was dissected, and cells were isolated as described (35Seifert G. Zhou M. Dietrich D. Schumacher T.B. Dybek A. Weiser T. Wienrich M. Wilhelm D. Steinhäuser C. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 931-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological Analysis of Isolated Cells—Membrane currents were analyzed with the patch clamp technique in the whole-cell mode (room temperature, holding potential VH = –70 mV). Currents were filtered at 3 or 10 kHz and sampled at 10 or 100 kHz (EPC7; List, Darmstadt, Germany). Recording pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate capillaries (Hilgenberg, Germany) and had resistances of 2–4 MΩ. Pipette solution consisted of 120 mm CsCl, 10 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mm HEPES, and 3 mm Na2-ATP, pH 7.3. Membrane capacitance and series resistance were compensated (40–50%) to improve voltage clamp control. The bath solution contained 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, supplemented with 0.5 μm tetrodotoxin (TTX), 4 mm 4-AP, 0.5 mm (S)-α-methyl-carboxyphenylglycine, and 50 μm APV. Chemicals were of analytical grade. TTX was purchased from Alomone (Jerusalem, Israel), Na2-ATP was from Fluka (Taufkirchen, Germany), AMPA (hydrobromide salt) was from RBI (Natick, MA), GYKI 53655 was from Tocris (Bristol, UK), and colominic acid with a molecular mass of 23 kDa was from Fluka. Chondroitin sulfate A and all other reagents were from Sigma. The coefficient of variation was calculated for glutamate responses at –70 mV as the following ratio: CV = (variance(glutamate response) – variance(base line))½/(mean(glutamate response) – mean(base line)). Two hundred data points were used for calculation of mean and variance values. Reconstitution of AMPA Receptors in Lipid Bilayers—To reconstitute affinity-purified AMPA-Rs and analyze single channel currents, the “tip-dip” method was used (36Wilmsen U. Methfessel F. Hanke W. Boheim G. Spach G. Physical Chemistry of Transmembrane Ion Motions. Elsevier, Amsterdam1983: 479-485Google Scholar, 37Suarez-Isla B.A. Wan K. Lindstrom J. Montal M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2319-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 38Coronado R. Lattore R. Biophys. J. 1983; 43: 231-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The formation of artificial lipid bilayers was initiated by forming small bilayers on the tips of polished glass patch pipettes (World Precision Instruments Inc., Sarasota, FL). The BB-CH-PC electronic micropipette puller (Mechanex S.A., Switzerland) was used to pull patch pipettes with 100-MΩ resistance. The patch bilayer was formed in asymmetric saline conditions with the pseudoextracellular fluid (ECF) on one side, and the pseudointracellular fluid (ICF) on the other side. The ECF contained 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, and 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), whereas the ICF contained 110 mm KCl, 4 mm NaCl, 2 mm NaHCO3, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MOPS (pH 7.4) (Fisher). Lipid bilayers in the “outside-out” configuration were initiated by lowering both the patch pipette, which was filled with ICF, and the reference electrode into the bathing solution using the attached micromanipulator. The bathing solution consisted of 300 μl of the ECF. Formation of lipid bilayers was initiated by adding 5 μl of the synthetic phospholipid 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., Alabaster, AL) to the ECF. The synthetic phospholipid was prepared by dissolving it in anhydrous hexane (Aldrich) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml (39Vodyanoy V. Brand J.G. Teeter J.H. Receptor Events and Transduction Mechanisms in Taste and Olfaction. Marcel Dekker, New York1989: 319-345Google Scholar, 40Vodyanoy V. Hong F.T. Molecular Electronics: Biosensors and Biocomputers. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1989: 317-328Crossref Google Scholar). A suspension of affinity-purified AMPA-Rs was fused into the lipid bilayer on the tip of the patch pipette by gentle stirring of the extracellular fluid using a small magnetic stirring bar placed at the bottom of the microbeaker. Single Channel Recordings—Single channel activity evoked by 290 nm AMPA alone and in the presence of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 10 μg/ml colominic acid was recorded on a videotape (Sony Corp., New York) using a VR-10B Digital Data recorder (Instrutech Corp., Port Washington, NY). For single channel analysis, data were digitally lowpass filtered at 2 kHz and compressed to final sampling rates of 20 kHz and read in pClamp software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Data processing of the patch clamp recordings was essentially as described previously (41Sinnarajah S. Suppiramaniam V. Kumar K.P. Hall R.A. Bahr B.A. Vodyanoy V. Synapse. 1999; 31: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). All of the digitized traces were carefully inspected for artifacts and base-line drift before any quantitative analysis was performed. Transitions to and from the major conductance level were analyzed. The various peaks in the amplitude histogram were fitted with Gaussian curves to determine the maxima. AMPA-R currents were plotted as a function of membrane voltage. The channel conductance was determined according to the equation g = I/(V – V0), where I is the current, V is the voltage, and V0 is the reversal potential estimated from the I/V graph. To calculate the equivalent valence of the AMPA-R channel gate (z) in the presence and absence of colominic acid, we used the method described by Sinnarajah and co-workers (41Sinnarajah S. Suppiramaniam V. Kumar K.P. Hall R.A. Bahr B.A. Vodyanoy V. Synapse. 1999; 31: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), approximating the voltage dependence of channel open time as log (τopen) = –(zF/2.303RT)ΔV + log(τo). Open and closed time distributions (or the probability density functions, pdf) were assumed to be a sum of several exponential functions (i.e. pdf(t) = A1exp(–λ1t) + A2exp(–λ2t) + A3exp(–λ3t), where λ1, λ2, and λ3 are rate constants. The time constants for closed and open states t1 (equal to 1/λ1), t2 (equal to 1/λ2), and t3 (equal to 1/λ3) within bursts were derived from fits of the respective histograms by a sum of three or two exponential functions using the Marquardt least squares method (PSTAT module of Axon pClamp 6.0 software). For burst analyses, only experiments in which patches exhibiting single channel current levels were chosen. The full-size openings and the burst delimiter were determined from the plot of burst delimiter versus closings per burst as previously described (42Sigurdson W.J. Morris C.E. Brezden B.L. Gardner D.R. J. Exp. Biol. 1987; 127: 191-209Crossref Google Scholar). Burst duration time constants were derived from exponential fits obtained using the maximum likelihood method. The estimated rate constants λ1, λ2, and λ3 depend on fundamental transition rate constants k between connected states in the ion channel gating scheme. In order to derive individual rate constants for steps underlying activation of AMPA-Rs by colominic acid, we used the QuB program (available on the World Wide Web at www.qub.buffalo.edu). The digitized data were first idealized using the segmental k-means algorithm. Segmental k-means uses hidden Markov models to both find the most likely sequence of events in the data set and estimate model parameters. The maximum likelihood interval analysis program was used to compute the likelihood of the experimental series of open and closed times for a given set of trial rate constants and to search for the rate constants maximizing the likelihood (43Qin F. Auerbach A. Sachs F. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 264-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Modulation of AMPA Receptors Reconstituted in a Lipid Bilayer—To investigate the physiological properties of isolated AMPA-Rs, these were purified from brain homogenates by a sequence of chromatographic steps, culminating with immunoprecipitation using anti-GluR1 antibodies. Silver staining and Western blot analysis of purified proteins revealed a single band with a molecular mass of 105 kDa corresponding to the cognate molecular mass of the GluR1 subunit (Fig. 1B, arrow). A similar staining was found with anti-GluR2/3 antibody. Thus, the immunoprecipitated material probably represents the native heteromeric composition of AMPA-R subunits in the adult brain with an endogenous glycosylation pattern that makes it preferable to the use of recombinant AMPA receptors. Isolated receptors reconstituted in a lipid bilayer expressed single channel currents upon application of 290 nm AMPA (Fig. 2). This activity could be blocked by the antagonist of the AMPA/kainate glutamate receptors, CNQX (1 μm). When 290 nm AMPA was applied together with colominic acid (at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 10 μg/ml), a considerable increase in channel activity was observed (Figs. 2 and 3). The effect of colominic acid was reversible; the open probability increased from 0.23 ± 0.04 to 0.83 ± 0.03 after co-application of 2 μg/ml colominic acid and 290 nm AMPA and returned to 0.23 ± 0.05 after a 2-min washout of colominic acid (n = 6). Colominic acid induces no significant changes in the single channel conductance, but there was a profound increase in probability of channels to stay in the open state. Open probability, burst duration, and interburst intervals saturated at concentrations of colominic acid between 3 and 10 μg/ml (Fig. 4). To verify the specificity of colominic acid effects, we tested monomers of sialic acid (5 μg/ml) and another negatively charged polymeric carbohydrate, chondroitin sulfate A (5 μg/ml). Co-application of these compounds with 290 nm AMPA did not potentiate channel activity (open probability of 0.27 ± 0.06 (n = 5) for AMPA with sialic acid and 0.24 ± 0.05 (n = 4) for AMPA with chondroitin sulfate A versus 0.23 ± 0.04 (n = 9) for AMPA alone), implying that only polymers of sialic acid, and not monomers or any negatively charged sugar polymers, modulate AMPA-R activity.Fig. 3Concentration dependence of colominic acid effects on single AMPA-R channels reconstituted in lipid bilayers.A–F, traces (left) and amplitude histograms (right) representing the single channel fluctuations upon application of 290 nm AMPA without colominic acid (A) and in the presence of 0.5 (B), 1 (C), 2 (D), 3 (E), and 10 μg/ml (F) of colominic acid (CA). Channel openings are indicated by upward current deflections. The amplitude histograms show bimodal distributions with peaks corresponding to the stationary current levels (i.e. open and closed states). The maximum unitary current is 3.8 pA (VH = +71). The channel conductance and relative occurrence (in percent) of open states are as follows: 53 pS, 23% (A); 54 pS, 36% (B); 56 pS, 58% (C); 56 pS, 83% (D); 56 pS, 85% (E); 56 pS, 85% (F). The mean burst durations are 960 ms (A), 1523 ms (B), 2300 ms (C), 2850 ms (D), 2985 ms (E), and 3010 ms (F). The interburst intervals are 900 ms (A), 710 ms (B), 420 ms (C), 180 ms (D), 52 ms (E), and 48 ms (F).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 4Concentration dependence of colominic acid effects on open probability, burst duration, and interburst interval of AMPA-Rs reconstituted in lipid bilayers.A, open probabilities (□) of AMPA-R channels after co-application of 290 nm AMPA with 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 10 μg/ml of colominic acid (CA) are 0.23 ± 0.08, 0.35 ± 0.07, 0.58 ± 0.08, 0.83 ± 0.08, 0.85 ± 0.08, and 0.85 ± 0.09, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2009826908,"The tail of most sharks has an elongated upper lobe that differs from the externally symmetrical tail structure common among bony fishes, but the hydrodynamic purpose of this asymmetric tail shape is unclear. Here we quantify water flow patterns in the wakes of freely swimming dogfish sharks and find that they have a ring-within-a-ring vortex structure, in contrast to the single rings shed by symmetrical fish tails. The branched-ring vortex is generated by the inclined angle of the tail's trailing edge and by its motion at an angle to the horizontal body axis; the vortex directs water backwards and downwards, which may increase the shark's vertical manoeuvrability."
https://openalex.org/W2064666994,"Alterations in the expression of the recently discovered apolipoprotein A5 gene strongly affect plasma triglyceride levels. In this study, we investigated the contribution of APOA5 to the liver X receptor (LXR) ligand-mediated effect on plasma triglyceride levels. Following treatment with the LXR ligand T0901317, we found that APOA5 mRNA levels were decreased in hepatoma cell lines. The observation that no down-regulation of APOA5 promoter activity was obtained by LXR-retinoid X receptor (RXR) co-transfection prompted us to explore the possible involvement of the known LXR target gene SREBP-1c (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c). In fact, we found that co-transfection with the active form of SREBP-1c down-regulated APOA5 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. We then scanned the human APOA5 promoter sequence and identified two putative E-box elements that were able to bind specifically SREBP-1c in gel-shift assays and were shown to be functional by mutation analysis. Subsequent suppression of SREBP-1 mRNA through small interfering RNA interference abolished the decrease of APOA5 mRNA in response to T0901317. Finally, administration of T0901317 to hAPOA5 transgenic mice revealed a significant decrease of APOA5 mRNA in liver tissue and circulating apolipoprotein AV protein in plasma, confirming that the described down-regulation also occurs in vivo. Taken together, our results demonstrate that APOA5 gene expression is regulated by the LXR ligand T0901317 in a negative manner through SREBP-1c. These findings may provide a new mechanism responsible for the elevation of plasma triglyceride levels by LXR ligands and support the development of selective LXR agonists, not affecting SREBP-1c, as beneficial modulators of lipid metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2020081493,"The new bisphenazine anticancer drug MLN944 is a novel cytotoxic agent with exceptional anti-tumor activity against a range of human and murine tumor models both in vitro and in vivo. MLN944 has recently entered Phase I clinical trials. Despite the structural similarity with its parent monophenazine carboxamide and acridine carboxamide anticancer compounds, MLN944 appears to work by a distinct mechanism of inhibiting DNA transcription rather than the expected mechanism of topoisomerase I and II inhibition. Here we present the first NMR structure of MLN944 complexed with d(ATGCAT)2 DNA duplex, demonstrating a novel binding mode in which the two phenazine rings bis-intercalate at the 5′-TpG site, with the carboxamide amino linker lying in the major groove of DNA. The MLN944 molecule adopts a significantly unexpected conformation and side chain orientation in the DNA complex, with the N10 on the phenazine ring protonated at pH 7. The phenazine chromophore of MLN944 is very well stacked with the flanking DNA base pairs using the parallel base-stacking intercalation binding mode. The DNA sequence specificity and the groove recognition of MLN944 binding is determined by several site-specific hydrogen bond interactions with the central G:C base pair as well as the favorable stacking interactions with the 5′-flanking thymine. The specific binding site of MLN944 is known to be recognized by a number of important transcription factors. Our electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay results demonstrated that the c-Jun DNA binding to the AP-1 site is significantly inhibited by MLN944 in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, the exceptional biological activity of MLN944 may be due to its novel DNA binding mode leading to a unique mechanism of action. The new bisphenazine anticancer drug MLN944 is a novel cytotoxic agent with exceptional anti-tumor activity against a range of human and murine tumor models both in vitro and in vivo. MLN944 has recently entered Phase I clinical trials. Despite the structural similarity with its parent monophenazine carboxamide and acridine carboxamide anticancer compounds, MLN944 appears to work by a distinct mechanism of inhibiting DNA transcription rather than the expected mechanism of topoisomerase I and II inhibition. Here we present the first NMR structure of MLN944 complexed with d(ATGCAT)2 DNA duplex, demonstrating a novel binding mode in which the two phenazine rings bis-intercalate at the 5′-TpG site, with the carboxamide amino linker lying in the major groove of DNA.

The systemic therapies currently available for the treatment of various solid tumors of adult life, including those of lung, colon, breast, prostate, and ovary, remain primarily palliative, and there is an urgent need for more effective therapies. Although recently there has been a significant effort in developing molecular targeted therapies, cytotoxic agents remain the major form of therapy for the majority of cancers. Moreover, there is reason to believe that a therapeutic advantage remains to be gained from cytotoxic drugs with novel mechanisms of action, with improved safety profiles and different spectra of anti-tumor activity. The bisphenazine MLN944 (XR5944) (Fig. 1a) is a novel cytotoxic agent with exceptional anti-tumor activity against a range of human and murine tumor models both in vitro and in vivo (1Stewart A.J. Mistry P. Dangerfield W. Bootle D. Baker M. Kofler B. Okiji S. Baguley B.C. Denny W.A. Charlton P.A. Anti-Cancer Drugs. 2001; 12: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It has recently entered Phase I clinical trials. Although initial reports showed that MLN944 can bind strongly to DNA (2Gamage S.A. Spicer J.A. Finlay G.J. Stewart A.J. Charlton P. Baguley B.C. Denny W.A. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 1407-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and that it may interfere with the normal function of topoisomerase I and II in vitro (1Stewart A.J. Mistry P. Dangerfield W. Bootle D. Baker M. Kofler B. Okiji S. Baguley B.C. Denny W.A. Charlton P.A. Anti-Cancer Drugs. 2001; 12: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), recent studies have indicated that topoisomerase I and II may not be its primary cellular target and that it works by a novel mechanism of action. The mechanistic novelty of MLN944 is suggested by the fact that in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, modulation of topoisomerase I, II, and III levels did not alter the efficacy of the compound. Moreover, the functional genomics profiles of MLN944-treated yeast were unlike the profiles from yeast treated with known inhibitors of topoisomerase I and II (3Sappal D.S. McClendon A.K. Fleming J.A. Thoroddsen V. Connolly K. Reimer C. Blackman R.K. Bulawa C.E. Osheroff N. Charlton P. Rudolph-Owen L.A. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Studies in mammalian cells have also indicated a novel mechanism of action of MLN944. For example, exposure of human tumor cells to MLN944 causes arrest in both G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle, whereas compounds that inhibit topoisomerase I or II characteristically lead to cell cycle arrest in S/G2 phase even when cells are exposed to these agents simultaneously (3Sappal D.S. McClendon A.K. Fleming J.A. Thoroddsen V. Connolly K. Reimer C. Blackman R.K. Bulawa C.E. Osheroff N. Charlton P. Rudolph-Owen L.A. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). MLN944 also exhibits activity against both quiescent and proliferating tumor cells and has the ability to kill cells following only a brief exposure period (4Freathy C. Dangerfield W. Sappal D. Kovats S.G. Mistry P. Rudolph-Owen L. Charlton P. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 2003; 44Google Scholar) with a corresponding lack of schedule dependence in its in vivo anti-tumor efficacy, as is characteristic for topoisomerase inhibitors (1Stewart A.J. Mistry P. Dangerfield W. Bootle D. Baker M. Kofler B. Okiji S. Baguley B.C. Denny W.A. Charlton P.A. Anti-Cancer Drugs. 2001; 12: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The novel mechanism of action of MLN944 has recently been shown to be related to the inhibition of DNA transcription (5Blackman R.K. Pan J. Fleming J.A. Muir C. Bulawa C.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 6075Google Scholar, 6Byers S.A. Martinez B. Price D. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 6078Google Scholar). The parent compounds of MLN944, phenazine carboxamides (such as MLN576 and MLN612) as well as the closely related acridine carboxamides (such as N-(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)acridine-4-carboxamide (DACA), 1The abbreviations used are: DACA, N-(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)acridine-4-carboxamide; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility assay.1The abbreviations used are: DACA, N-(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)acridine-4-carboxamide; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility assay. are both DNA intercalators and dual DNA topoisomerase I/II inhibitors (7Finlay G.J.

Anti-Cancer Drugs. 2002; 13: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of 9-amino-DACA·DNA complexes showed that acridine rings intercalate duplex DNA at a CpG site (10Adams A. Guss J.M. Collyer C.A. Denny W.A. Wakelin L.P.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9221-9233Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 11Todd A.K. Adams A. Thorpe J.H. Denny W.A. Wakelin L.P.G. Cardin C.J. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). MLN944 has also been shown to be an efficient DNA intercalator by its induction of dose-dependent supercoiling of plasmid DNA. Moreover, MLN944 has been shown to bind doublestranded DNA with high affinity and to have a strong G-C sequence preference (2Gamage S.A. Spicer J.A. Finlay G.J. Stewart A.J. Charlton P. Baguley B.C. Denny W.A. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 1407-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is surprising that MLN944 works by a distinct mechanism of action other than that of topoisomerase I/II inhibition. It is possible that the exceptional biological activity of MLN944 may be related to a distinct DNA binding mode and hence its novel mechanism of action. In this study, we determined the structure of a complex between MLN944 and DNA duplex d(ATGCAT)2 using a combination of NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics calculation. The result shows that MLN944 does indeed have a novel binding mode with a duplex DNA. The drug bis-intercalates at the 5′-(TpG):(CpA) site, with the aminoalkyl linker lying in the major groove of the DNA. This not only is the first structure of a phenazine derivative binding with DNA but is also the first solution structure of a DNA complex among all of the closely related acridine carboxamide compounds. A number of novel features of drug binding with DNA in the solution state that have not been reported before are also shown in our study. Sample Preparation—The DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized using β-cyanoethylphosphoramidite solid-phase chemistry on an Expedite™ nucleic acid synthesis system (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) with the DMT-ON setting and were purified using C18 reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. MLN576 (XR11576) and MLN944 (XR5944) were provided by Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Cambridge, MA) and Xenova Ltd. (Slough, UK). The NMR samples were prepared by dissolving DNA oligonucleotide powder into 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7 in either pure D2O (98%) or D2O/H2O (10%/90%). The D2O samples were lyophilized and resuspended in 99.98% D2O two more times. The DNA-drug complexes were prepared by adding an appropriate amount of drug stock solution to the DNA sample, followed by lyophilization and redissolution in D2O. The final concentrations of DNA oligonucleotides were 1–4 mm. NMR Experiments—Both one- and two-dimensional NMR experiments were carried out on a Bruker Avance 600-MHz spectrometer. Standard homonuclear two-dimensional NMR experiments were used to assign the nonexchangeable proton chemical shifts of the complex, including DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY. The mixing times were set at 50, 100, 150, and 200 ms for NOESY and at 30 and 60 ms for TOCSY. The NMR experiments for samples in water solution were performed with WATERGATE or jump-return (NOE11) water suppression techniques. The relaxation delay was set to 2 s. The acquisition data points were set to 4096 × 512. The 60° shifted sine bell functions were applied to both dimensions of NOESY and TOCSY spectra. The 5 order polynomial functions were employed for the base-line corrections. The final data points were 4096 × 1024. Peak assignment and integration were achieved using Sparky (University of California, San Francisco). Distances between nonexchangeable protons were assigned based on the NOE cross-peaks integrated at 50–200-ms mixing times. The peak volumes were referenced using the distance H5–H6 of cytosine (2.45 Å). Unsolved protons were replaced by pseudoatoms, and the appropriate correction was applied to the measured distance. Distance-restrained Molecular Dynamics Simulation—Structure calculations were performed using NOE-restrained molecular dynamics simulation in the program X-PLOR (version 3.851) (12Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1: A system for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). The starting model of the DNA d(ATGCAT)-MLN944 complex was constructed in Insight II 2000.1 (Accelrys), with the intercalation site conformations deduced from the NOE data. The partial charges were obtained from X-PLOR or from the representative fragments in Insight II. The CHARMM force field was used for the calculation. The skewed biharmonic energy function was used for distance constraints from NOE data. A total of 161 distances were used in the NOE-restrained dynamics calculations. A distance-dependent dielectric constant was used in the calculations to simulate the aqueous environment. Noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were maintained throughout the computations for the 2-fold symmetry of the complex. Each cycle of restrained MD simulation was carried out at 300 K with a time step of 0.25 fs. The system was first equilibrated for 0.5 ps, with the force constants of 1 kcal/mol·A2 for all restraints. The force constants were gradually scaled to the final values of 30, 30, and 60 kcal/mol·A2 for NOE, noncrystallographic symmetry, and hydrogen bond restraints, respectively, during the subsequent 10-ps simulation. The system was then equilibrated for 12 ps. The coordinates saved during the last 5.0 ps were averaged. The resulting average structure was further subjected to 3000 steps of energy minimization. Electrophoretic Gel Mobility Shift Assays—The AP-1 binding probe 5′-AAAGATCCCATGAGTCAGGTACCAC (the core sequence is underlined) was custom-made (Qiagen, Alameda, CA) and purified through a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The upper strand was end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and applied to a Micro Bio-Spin 6 chromatography column (Bio-Rad). The labeled strand was annealed with an excess of the unlabeled complementary strand by heating to 90 °C for 5 min and then cooling slowly in annealing buffer (10 μm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Briefly, 1.5 footprinting units of recombinant human c-Jun (Promega, Madison, WI) was incubated with 25, 5, 0.5, 0.05, or 0.005 μm MLN944 in binding buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, and 4% glycerol for 15 min at room temperature, mixed with ∼20,000 cpm DNA probe, and subsequently incubated for a further 20 min. The samples were loaded on a 1.5-mm-thick 6% polyacrylamide native gel (50:1 acrylamide/bis) that was prerun for 30 min at 200 V. The reactions were resolved by electrophoresis at 240 V for 40 min in 0.5× TBE, followed by phosphor-imaging analysis. The specificity of inhibitory activity of MLN944 compared with other DNA intercalators was determined by using 25 μm ethidium bromide or 25 μm topotecan instead of MLN944 in the above assay. The activity of MLN944 against other DNA-binding proteins was examined by a similar assay using an NF-κB gel shift assay system with all components purchased from Promega. The reactions contained 2 gel shift units of NF-κB and 25 μm MLN944 incubated with 25,000 cpm NF-κB consensus DNA 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGG in a relevant dilution of gel shift binding 5× buffer. All experiments have been repeated at least three times. Sequence-specific Binding of MLN944 with d(ATGCAT)—It has been shown in initial DNA binding studies that MLN944 displays a strong sequence preference of poly(G-C) over poly(A-T) (2Gamage S.A. Spicer J.A. Finlay G.J. Stewart A.J. Charlton P. Baguley B.C. Denny W.A. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 1407-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and that the two planar phenazine chromophores of MLN944 allow for the possibility of bis-intercalation. Hence, we initially investigated the binding of MLN944 to a series of DNA sequences with two GpC or CpG binding sites by monitoring 1H NMR spectra. Over a dozen such DNA sequences were tested without detecting a specific binding site of MLN944. Broadening the DNA sequence range leads to the discovery of a strong sequence-specific binding of MLN944 to the DNA duplex d(ATGCAT)2 at pH 7 (Fig. 1b). A new set of resonances emerged in the 0.5:1 drug-DNA duplex mixture, and these co-existed with the resonances from free DNA. This indicated that a stable complex had formed between DNA and the drug and that the binding equilibrium is in the slow exchange process on the NMR time scale. In the 1:1 drug-DNA mixture, resonances from free DNA completely disappeared, leaving only one resonance per proton. The presence of a single set of resonances indicates that a strong binding of drug occurs to a specific binding site in the DNA duplex and that the unique drug-DNA complex retains the 2-fold symmetry for both drug and self-complementary DNA. The symmetrical complementary DNA strand is referenced using the prime sign (Fig. 1b). NMR Spectroscopic Analysis—All proton resonances of MLN944 and DNA have been assigned by using two-dimensional NOESY, TOCSY, and COSY data. Standard sequential assignment has been used to assign the resonances of DNA. The drug phenazine ring proton H8 (Fig. 1a) was assigned by a strong NOE cross-peak with the drug C9 methyl group. This led to the assignment of its vicinal proton H7 and then of H6. The drug H3 proton was clearly identified by having two COSY cross-peaks with both H2 and H4, whereas H2 was assigned by its NOE cross-peak with the carboxamide linker and was further confirmed by a number of NOE cross-peaks with its neighboring DNA bases. The exchangeable protons of both DNA and drug were assigned by using two-dimensional NOESY. The chemical shifts of all resonances are tabulated in Table I.Table I1H NMR chemical shift (ppm) of the 1:1 DNA-MLN944 complex and the free DNA d(ATGCAT)2 (in parentheses) at 15 °C The chemical shift of the exchangeable protons H1/H3 of DNA and HN, H10 of drug are assigned at 7 °C.

The exchangeable proton NMR spectrum in H2O revealed two clear imino proton resonances at 12.6 (G3HN1) and 13.65 (T2HN3) ppm, suggesting Watson-Crick type base pairing (Table I). The MLN944-DNA complex retains the 2-fold symmetry. The glycosidic torsion angles of all nucleotides are in the anti configuration in the d(ATGCAT)2-MLN944 complex, as indicated by the intraresidue H6/H8-H1′ NOE intensities (Fig. 2). However, there are a number of unusual features in the spectra. The sequential NOE cross-peak connectivities of the aromatic H6/H8 protons to the H1′/H2′/H2″ protons typical for double-helical B-DNA are interrupted at the T2pG3 and C4pA5 steps. Specifically, the cross-peaks of T2H1′/H2′/H2″-G3H8, G4H1′/H2′/H2″-C5H6 are very weak (Fig. 2). This indicates that the drug MLN944 bis-intercalates at the T2pG3 and C4pA5 steps in the complex (Fig. 1b), breaking the normal base-stacking interactions in free B-DNA at these positions by pushing the two adjacent base pairs apart. The imino protons are clearly observable in the exchangeable proton NMR spectra of DNA-drug complex, indicating that the base-pairing scheme is retained in the complex. Moreover, the imino proton G3HN1 is still detectable at 25 °C in the complex, whereas it is not observable at 15 °C in the free DNA, implying a more stable DNA duplex upon drug binding; this is also confirmed by the increase in the melting temperatures of DNA-drug complex in comparison with the free DNA (∼45 and ∼30 °C, respectively). Furthermore, both DNA imino protons T2HN3 and G3HN1, as well as A5H2 and G3H1′, are the DNA protons that are most affected by drug binding and undergo large upfield shifts (3.1, 2, 1.2, and 0.8 ppm, respectively) (Table I). Such upfield shifts, induced by the ring current effects of the MLN944 phenazine ring, are characteristic of an intercalative mode of drug binding. These data further confirm the bis-intercalation of MLN944 at the T2pG3(:C4′pA5′) and C4pA5(:T2′pG3′) sites of DNA. Protonation of MLN944 Phenazine Ring—The exchangeable proton NMR spectrum in H2O of the DNA-MLN944 complex at pH 7 also reveals a very interesting proton resonance in the imino region at 11.22 ppm. Inspection of the two-dimensional NOESY spectra indicates that this proton is not an imino proton of any DNA nucleotide. It has a much slower exchange rate with water than that of the DNA imino protons of both T2 and G3. This proton has NOE interactions with several other protons of MLN944, including 9-methyl protons (strong), linker proton Hα1 (medium to strong), and H8 (weak), and was thus assigned as HN10 on the N10 of ring B of MLN944. The presence of the HN10 at pH7 is quite remarkable, since the pKa value of the N10 is only 1.0–1.3 (13Palmer B.D. Rewcastle G.W. Atwell G.J. Baguley B.C. Denny W.A. J. Med. Chem. 1988; 31: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). 2W. Denny, personal communication. This unexpected drug phenazine conformation, which could not possibly exist in the bulk solution, is clearly induced and stabilized by the microenvironment of DNA binding pocket. MLN944 is formulated as the dimesylate salt, with the amino nitrogen N-γ protonated at pH 7 and positively charged (Fig. 1a). The amide proton HN is also observable and assigned in the exchangeable proton NOESY spectra (Table I). NMR Structure Determination—Many intermolecular NOE cross-peaks between MLN944 and DNA are observed in two-dimensional NOESY, as summarized in Fig. 3. The strong NOE interaction between C4H5 and MLN944-M9 places the methyl group of the drug phenazine ring position 9 (Fig. 1a) in the major groove of the DNA double helix. In the meantime, the NOE interactions between the DNA T2 methyl group and MLN944-Hα1 and H2 place the carboxamide aminoalkyl linker in the major groove as well. The aromatic protons H2, H3, and H4 on the drug display multiple NOE cross-peaks with the DNA T2 and G3 aromatic protons H8/H6/Me and sugar protons H1′/H2′/H2″, whereas the drug aromatic protons H6, H7, and H8 show similar NOE interactions with the C4 and A5 residues of DNA, indicating that the MLN944 phenazine ring intercalates between the (T2:A5′)-(G3:C4′) base pairs. The ring A of MLN944 stacks between the T2pG3 step, while the ring C of the drug stacks between the C4′pA5′ step of the complementary strand. These intermolecular NOEs suggest a parallel base-stacking intercalation of both phenazine rings of MLN944 at the two symmetric (T2pG3):(C4′pA5′) and (C4pA5): (T2′pG3′) steps, with the long axis of each phenazine parallel to the long axes of the flanking DNA base pairs and the aminoalkyl linker in the major groove of the DNA duplex. The stacking position of the phenazine rings is further defined by the intermolecular NOE interactions between drug aromatic ring protons and DNA residues. The MLN944 H2 and H3 are close to DNA T2H1′ and to a lesser extent G3H1′, which are both located in the DNA minor groove, indicating that the phenazine ring A is inserted deeply into the DNA base pair stack. H6/H7/H8 of MLN944 ring C show similar, but weaker, NOE interactions with DNA C4 and A5 residues, indicating that the drug phenazine ring is closer to the T2pG3 side than to the C4′pA5′ side of the complementary strand. Furthermore, the G3H1′ in the minor groove is one of the most upfield-shifted DNA proton resonances upon drug binding (Table I), as discussed before, indicating the close proximity of the MLN944 A ring with the T2pG3 sugar backbone. The same phenomenon was not observed between the drug C ring and C4pA5 backbone. In addition, MLN944-H4 has a strong NOE interaction with DNA A5H2, whereas MLN944-H6 does not have much NOE interaction with A5H2. These observations suggest that the MLN944 phenazine A ring end inserts more deeply toward the DNA minor groove and is closer to the DNA sugar backbone, whereas the C ring end is positioned farther from the DNA sugar backbone and more toward the DNA major groove. A starting model of the d(ATGCAT)2-MLN944 complex constructed using the above mentioned information was subjected to NOE-restrained molecular dynamics calculation in X-PLOR (12Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1: A system for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). A total of 161 distance restraints, of which 51 are from intermolecular NOE interactions between MLN944 and DNA, were incorporated into the restrained molecular dynamics calculation. The restrained molecular dynamics calculation produced a very stable, converged family of structures (Fig. 4 and Table II, Protein Data Bank accession number 1X95), indicating a well defined binding conformation.

The carboxamide aminoalkyl linker lies in the major groove of the DNA duplex. The 2-fold symmetry of both DNA and drug are retained. The linker runs diagonally across the major groove such that the drug has the appearance of a backward “Z” when viewed from the major groove. The drug exhibits a left-handed twist counter to the right-handed twist of the DNA helix. In the intercalation pocket, the rise between two intercalated T2:A5 and G3:C4 base pairs is ∼6.32 Å, much larger than that of the perpendicular intercalation binding site, as exemplified by anthracycline drugs (14Yang D.Z.

The DNA double helix is unwound throughout the DNA hexamer in the drug complex, compared with regular B-DNA with an average helical twist of 36° per step, with the overall extent of unwinding of the DNA hexamer in the drug complex of 48°. The TpG step at the intercalation site is unwound by 10°, and the terminal ApT step is unwound by 13°. The central G3pC4 steps, wrapped between the two phenazine rings of MLN944, maintain relatively good base pair conformation and hydrogen bonding interactions as observed in regular B-DNA. In contrast, conformational distortions at the intercalation site T2pG3 and C4pA5 steps are more significant, with the T2:A5′ base pairs displaying a significant large negative roll angle (-13°) and propeller twist (-8°) and buckling (6°). This is consistent with the fact that the TpG:CpA steps are particularly flexible (16Gorin A.A. Zhurkin V.B. Olson W.K. J. Mol.

The two central G3:C4 base pairs are pulled toward the major groove via interactions with the drug linker, making the major groove significantly shallower compared with that of the regular B-DNA. The DNA duplex is kinked by ∼10° toward the minor groove. The kinking and unwinding of the DNA in the complex induce a broad and shallow minor groove as well when compared with the regular B-DNA.

Yet, in contrast to the situation with all other second messengers, no one studying multicellular organisms has previously described a stimulus that acutely and specifically elevates cellular levels of PP-InsP5 or [PP]2-InsP4. We now show up to 25-fold elevations in [PP]2-InsP4 levels in animal cells. Importantly, this does not involve classical agonists. Instead, we show that this [PP]2-InsP4 response is a novel consequence of the activation of ERK1/2 and p38MAPα/β kinases by hyperosmotic stress. JNK did not participate in regulating [PP]2-InsP4 levels. Identification of [PP]2-InsP4 as a sensor of hyperosmotic stress opens up a new area of research for studies into the cellular activities of higher inositol phosphates.

Devreotes P. Snyder S.H. Cell. 2003; 114: 559-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) that many of the important cellular functions currently attributed to InsP6 may in vivo be more effectively performed by PP-InsP5 and [PP]2-InsP4. The Dictyostelids have uniquely exploited the physico-chemical properties of the inositol diphosphates by synthesizing near-millimolar levels of these molecules (8Laussmann T. Pikzack C. Thiel U. Mayr G.W. Vogel G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2447-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, animal cells have 300-fold lower levels of PP-InsP5 and [PP]2-InsP4 (1Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It has therefore generally been anticipated that, in animal cells, there should be substantial, stimulus-dependent increases in cellular levels of PP-InsP5 and [PP]2-InsP4 to elevate levels of these polyphosphates to a functionally significant threshold. However, no such phenomenon has been described previously. Instead, only quite small stimulus-dependent changes in PP-InsP5 and [PP]2-InsP4 turnover have been reported, and in each case the result was a decrease rather than an increase in cellular levels of the pyrophosphates. For example, depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores by thapsigargin transiently decreases PP-InsP5 levels by 50% (9Glennon M.C. Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Activation of β-adrenergic receptors decrease levels of [PP]2-InsP4 by up to 40% (10Safrany S.T. Shears S.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1710-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This absence of a substantial, regulatory context for PP-InsP5 and [PP]2-InsP4 has been addressed in the current study, in which we selected a biological paradigm of fundamental and widespread significance, namely, defense against osmotic stress. The maintenance of osmotic balance across plasma membranes is an ongoing cellular burden in the face of controlled changes in both cell size and intracellular hydration as well as exchange of metabolites and ions across plasma membranes (11Häussinger D. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). There are also clinically relevant osmotic challenges that can impose strain upon the cytoskeleton, perturb chromatin structure, damage DNA, and inhibit DNA repair (12Chiasson J.L. Aris-Jilwan N. Belanger R. Bertrand S. Beauregard H. Ekoe J.M. Fournier H. Havrankova J. Can. Med. Assoc. J. 2003; 168: 859-866PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kültz D. Chakravarty D. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2001; 130: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). One way to examine how cells sense and adapt to hyperosmotic stress is to add sorbitol to the medium (11Häussinger D. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that the addition of 0.2 m sorbitol can elevate [PP]2-InsP4 levels up to 25-fold, and we also study the molecular mechanisms that are involved. Cellular levels of inositol phosphates were determined as previously described (10Safrany S.T. Shears S.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1710-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). InsP6 and PP-InsP5 kinase activities were assayed as described (15Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24686-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Several colleagues kindly supplied the following cDNA constructs: DN-p38α and DN-p38β in pCDNA3 (Dr. J. Han, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA), PIPKH in pCMV2 (Dr. J. Chang, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA), DN-ERK1 and DN-ERK2 in pCMV5 (Dr. C. Der, University of North Carolina). Cells are constantly adapting to the osmotic challenges brought on by normal cellular activities, such as the breakdown of macromolecules, controlled changes in both cell size and intracellular hydration, as well as exchange of metabolites and ions across plasma membranes (11Häussinger D. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). We investigated whether inositol diphosphates might be regulated by hyperosmotic stress, which we introduced by the addition of 0.2 m sorbitol. It is notable that many earlier studies into hyperosomotic stress have frequently employed much higher doses of sorbitol (0.5–0.7 m). Cells adapt successfully to 0.2 m sorbitol, since it failed even after 24 h to affect viability of either HEK cells (101 ± 2%) or the DDT1 MF2 vas deferens smooth muscle line (96 ± 1%) compared with non-sorbitol controls. A novel, immediate and selective response of DDT1 MF2 cells and HEK cells to 0.2 m sorbitol is a dramatic elevation of [PP]2-InsP4 levels, in the range of 10–25-fold (Fig. 1). It is worth emphasizing the novelty of this observation; there is no previous report of any extracellular stimulus that can specifically and acutely increase levels of an inositol diphosphate. Both PP-InsP5 and [PP]2-InsP4 are hydrolyzed by DIPPs (14Safrany S.T. Caffrey J.J. Yang X. Bembenek M.E. Moyer M.B. Burkhart W.A. Shears S.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6599-6607Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 16Hua L.V. Hidaka K. Pesesse X. Barnes L.D. Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 81-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Any DIPP inhibition following osmotic stress should elevate both of the diphosphoinositol polyphosphates. On the contrary, a 26 ± 4% (n = 8) drop in PP-InsP5 accompanies the sorbitol-dependent increase in [PP]2-InsP4 levels (Fig. 1A). These effects are consistent with hyperosmotic stress elevating [PP]2-InsP4 levels by activating the PP-InsP5 kinase. However, it is possible that sorbitol stress inhibits an [PP]2-InsP4-specific phosphatase or [PP]2-InsP4-specific phosphorylation of proteins (5Luo H.R. Saiardi A. Yu H. Nagata E. Ye K. Snyder S.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2509-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Time course data indicated that [PP]2-InsP4 levels were elevated within 5–10 min of the initiation of hyperosmotic stress (Fig. 1B). As little as 0.05 m sorbitol promoted a severalfold [PP]2-InsP4 response (Fig. 1C). Within minutes of terminating the hyperosmotic challenge, [PP]2-InsP4 levels declined exponentially, although they did not return to pre-activated levels within the 2-h experimental time frame (Fig. 1D); instead, the cell's memory of their stress history persisted. To assess the mechanisms underlying the sorbitol-dependent increase in [PP]2-InsP4 levels, we considered how this enzyme might interface with other signaling entities. Hyperosomotic stress is known to activate Ser/Thr phosphoprotein phosphatases (17Meier R. Thelen M. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7294-7303Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and Tyr phosphoprotein phosphatases (18Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18114-18120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), but inhibitors of either pathway (20 nm okadaic acid or 10 μm phenylarsine oxide, respectively) did not modify the [PP]2-InsP4 response to sorbitol (data not shown). The JNK MAP kinase pathway can be activated by 0.5 m sorbitol (19Bagowski C.P. Besser J. Frey C.R. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 315-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In agreement with this earlier study, we also found that 0.5 m sorbitol activated JNK (Fig. 2A). However, JNK was not activated by 0.2 m sorbitol (Fig. 2A), yet this dose of sorbitol was sufficient to maximally elevate [PP]2-InsP4 levels (Fig. 1C). Thus, we conclude that JNK activation is not necessary for [PP]2-InsP4 levels to be increased by hyperosmotic stress. The ERK and p38 MAP kinase pathways are activated by osmotic stress (Fig. 2, B and C, and Refs. 20Cowan K.J. Storey K.B. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 1107-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar and 21Galcheva-Gargova Z. Derijard B. Wu I.H. Davis R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of cells with the MEK inhibitors U0126 (10 μm) or PD098059 (50 μm) inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2, B and C, and Ref. 22English J.M. Cobb M.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 40-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). This was accompanied by a 45–50% reduction of the sorbitol-dependent increase in [PP]2-InsP4 levels (Fig. 3A). The similarity of the results obtained with two structurally unrelated MEK inhibitors makes it unlikely that reversal of the sorbitol effect results from unsuspected nonspecific actions of U0126 or PD098059. Pretreatment of cells with SB203580 inhibited phosphorylation of p38α/β (Fig. 2C and Ref. 23Goedert M. Cuenda A. Craxton M. Jakes R. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) and also elicited a 23% attenuation of the sorbitol-dependent increase in [PP]2-InsP4 levels (Fig. 3A). The relatively mild effect of SB203580 when it was added alone may be in part explained by its ability to non-specifically activate ERK1/2 (Fig. 3A); a similar effect has been noted previously (24Liu Q. Hofmann P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: H2204-H2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The co-application of a single MEK inhibitor (50 μm PD098059) together with the p38 inhibitor (10 μm SB203580) yielded an approximately additive result (80% reversal of the effect of sorbitol upon [PP]2-InsP4 levels, see Fig. 3A). We eliminated the possibility that the MAP kinase inhibitors might non-specifically block synthesis of the diphosphoinositol polyphosphates: native preparations of PP-InsP5 kinase showed 103 ± 2% activity when incubated with 10 μm SB203580, 105 ± 3% with 10 μm U0126, and 103 ± 2% with 50 μm PD098059 (n = 3), all relative to vehicle controls. The recombinant InsP6 kinase showed 97 ± 6% activity when incubated with 10 μm SB203580, 105 ± 2% with 10 μm U0126 and 96 ± 5% with 50 μm PD098059 (n = 3–4), all relative to vehicle controls. Although MAP kinase inhibitors did not affect PP-InsP5 synthesis in vitro, the level of PP-InsP5 in cells treated with either PD098059 or UO1276 was 25% lower than control cells (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that the ERK activity that is ongoing even in resting cells (Fig. 2B) may weakly enhance InsP6 kinase activity. Consistent with this explanation, the sorbitol-dependent decrease in PP-InsP5 levels was not reversed by the MEK inhibitors (Fig. 3B). The absence of any significant effect of the MAP kinase inhibitors upon PP-InsP5 levels in sorbitol-treated cells (Fig. 3B) is of additional interest; this observation indicates that the attenuation of sorbitol-mediated increases in [PP]2-InsP4 levels by the MAP kinase inhibitors is not a secondary consequence of a reduction in substrate supply for the PP-InsP5 kinase. To substantiate the inhibitor experiments, we next transiently transfected cells with dominant negative (DN) MAP kinase cDNA constructs. It is first important to note that environmental stresses provide “lateral” as well as “top-down” input into MAP kinase responses (25Harrison J.C. Zyla T.R. Bardes E.S. Lew D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2616-2622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The DN-ERK constructs block the MAP kinase pathway at a point that is downstream of the site of action of the MEK inhibitors, so these two empirical approaches could yield quantitatively different degrees of attenuation of the sorbitol response if there were any lateral input between MEK and ERK. When co-expressed, DN-ERK1 (K71R) and DN-ERK2 (K52R) (26Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C.A. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5097-5106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reduced the effect of sorbitol upon [PP]2-InsP4 levels by 30% (Fig. 4). Neither DN construct had any significant effect when added alone (data not shown). Also when co-expressed, the TGY-to-AGF DN-p38α and DN-p38β proteins (27Wang X. McGowan C.H. Zhao M. He L. Downey J.S. Fearns C. Wang Y. Huang S. Han J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4543-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 28Huang S. Jiang Y. Li Z. Nishida E. Mathias P. Lin S. Ulevitch R.J. Nemerow G.R. Han J. Immunity. 1997; 6: 739-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) reduced the effect of sorbitol upon [PP]2-InsP4 levels by 30% (Fig. 4). Again, neither DN construct had any significant effect when added alone (data not shown). Transient transfection of DDT1 MF2 cells with all four DN constructs reduced by 50% the effect of hyperosmotic stress upon [PP]2-InsP4 levels (Fig. 4). This is approximately the maximum effect that could be anticipated, given the limited transfection efficiency (50%; determined by GFP co-transfection). We found that the activity of the native PP-InsP5 kinase was unaffected by recombinant, phosphorylated ERK1/2 (data not shown). It therefore seems likely that another signaling protein that lies downstream of ERK mediates its activation of cellular [PP]2-InsP4 accumulation. Nevertheless, [PP]2-InsP4 signaling offers a new repertoire for MAP kinase actions upon cellular physiology. Its unusual nature is also of interest; MAP kinases do not typically recruit diffusible second messengers. There is a growing appreciation that the inositol diphosphates can bind in a functionally significant manner to certain proteins through largely delocalized (i.e. nonspecific) electrostatic interactions, most notably to the majority of PH domains (2Luo H.R. Huang Y.E. Chen J.C. Sairardi A. Iijima M. Ye K. Huang Y. Nagata E. Devreotes P. Snyder S.H. Cell. 2003; 114: 559-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 29Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Abrams C.S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), but other protein domains are certainly involved (3Ye W. Ali N. Bembenek M.E. Shears S.B. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1564-1568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 4Couchman J.R. Vogt S. Lim S.-T. Lim Y. Oh E.-S. Prestwich G.D. Theibert A. Lee W. Woods A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49296-49303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In these circumstances, the addition of even just one pyrophosphate group to InsP6 can increase ligand affinity by at least 30–100-fold (2Luo H.R. Huang Y.E. Chen J.C. Sairardi A. Iijima M. Ye K. Huang Y. Nagata E. Devreotes P. Snyder S.H. Cell. 2003; 114: 559-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Elevations in [PP]2-InsP4 levels following hyperosmotic stress would therefore be expected to increasingly compete with PtdIns(4,5)P2, another important ligand for PH domains that helps recruit proteins into multimeric signaling complexes (signalosomes) (29Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Abrams C.S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Indeed, dynamic competition between soluble inositol pyrophosphates and membrane-bound inositol lipids has been shown by others to act as a logic gate to determine whether an inositide-binding protein is recruited to signalosomes (2Luo H.R. Huang Y.E. Chen J.C. Sairardi A. Iijima M. Ye K. Huang Y. Nagata E. Devreotes P. Snyder S.H. Cell. 2003; 114: 559-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 4Couchman J.R. Vogt S. Lim S.-T. Lim Y. Oh E.-S. Prestwich G.D. Theibert A. Lee W. Woods A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49296-49303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). If there were autonomous spatio-temporal regulation of the levels of the competing lipid and pyrophosphate ligands, this would facilitate stimulus-specific control over the membership of these multimeric complexes. We have evidence of this metabolic autonomy; [PP]2-InsP4 levels in either control or sorbitol-treated cells were unaffected by inhibition of PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis by 10 μm U73122, by inhibition of PI 3-kinases with100 nm wortmannin, or by specific activation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 synthesis through transient overexpression of PIPKH (data not shown). Thus, [PP]2-InsP4 turnover is completely independent of inositol lipid turnover. Of importance to the subject of stimulus specificity, MAP kinase activation by the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (10 ng/ml for 30 min) had no effect upon [PP]2-InsP4 (data not shown). Furthermore, even though EGF is well known to activate ERK and p38 (Fig. 5 and Ref. 20Cowan K.J. Storey K.B. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 1107-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), it barely elevated [PP]2-InsP4 levels (0.7-fold; Fig. 5) and had no effect upon PP-InsP5 levels (Fig. 5). These data indicate that activation of both ERK and p38 are not, by themselves, sufficient to elevate [PP]2-InsP4 levels. Perhaps [PP]2-InsP4 turnover is regulated downstream of yet another signaling pathway that is selectively activated by hyperosmotic stress and not by EGF. Alternately, hyperosmotic stress (but not EGF) may attenuate an inhibitory process that normally constrains [PP]2-InsP4 accumulation in cells. These questions touch on an enigma that pervades MAP kinase research: how does a cell elicit a specific output from the MAP kinase pathway when it is utilized by so many extracellular and intracellular stimulii? Much additional work may be required to solve this problem, but in any case, our data are still significant in their demonstration that it is stress-dependent and not agonist-initiated increases in [PP]2-InsP4 levels that provides a regulatory context for the actions of inositol pyrophosphates. It is intriguing that hyperosmotic shock can damage DNA and affect vesicle trafficking processes (13Kültz D. Chakravarty D. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2001; 130: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), since these are both processes that can be regulated by inositol pyrophosphates (see Introduction).

https://openalex.org/W2137171971,"The acid-sensing ion channel-3 (ASIC3) is a degenerin/epithelial sodium channel expressed in the peripheral nervous system. Previous studies indicate that it participates in the response to mechanical and painful stimuli, perhaps contributing to mechanoreceptor and/or H+-gated nociceptor function. ASIC3 subunits contain intracellular N and C termini that may control channel localization and function. We found that a PDZ-binding motif at the ASIC3 C terminus interacts with four different proteins that contain PDZ domains: PSD-95, Lin-7b, MAGI-1b, and PIST. ASIC3 and these interacting proteins were expressed in dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord, and PSD-95 co-precipitated ASIC3 from spinal cord. When expressed in heterologous cells, PSD-95 reduced the amplitude of ASIC3 acid-evoked currents, whereas Lin-7b increased current amplitude. PSD-95 and Lin-7b altered current density by decreasing or increasing, respectively, the amount of ASIC3 on the cell surface. The finding that multiple PDZ-containing proteins bind ASIC3 and can influence its presence in the plasma membrane suggests that they may play an important role in the contribution of ASIC3 to nociception and mechanosensation.

Séguéla P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It is expressed in the peripheral nervous system, including the dorsal root ganglia and trigeminal ganglia. Immunocytochemical studies have localized it to several different specialized sensory nerve endings of skin, suggesting it might participate in mechanosensation and nociception (3Price M.P. McIllwrath S.L. Xie J. Cheng C. Qiao J. Tarr D.E. Sluka K.A. Brennan T.J. Lewin G.R. Welsh M.J. Neuron. 2001; 32: 1071-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The importance of ASIC3 for sensory function was revealed by studies of mice bearing targeted disruptions of the ASIC3 gene (3Price M.P. McIllwrath S.L. Xie J. Cheng C. Qiao J. Tarr D.E. Sluka K.A.

In single fiber recordings from cutaneous nerves, loss of ASIC3 increased the sensitivity of mechanoreceptors detecting light touch but reduced the sensitivity of a mechanoreceptor responding to noxious pinch. In behavioral studies, ASIC3 modulated the response to noxious acid, heat, and mechanical stimuli. Moreover chronic mechanical hyperalgesia produced by intramuscular acid injections was prevented in ASIC3 null animals (5Sluka K.A. Price M.P. Breese N.M. Stucky C.L. Wemmie J.A. Welsh M.J. Pain. 2003; 106: 229-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Functional studies suggest that ASIC3 may also mediate the pain associated with myocardial ischemia (6Benson C.J. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 7Sutherland S.P. Benson C.J. Adelman J.P. McCleskey E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Thus, in different cellular contexts, ASIC3 may participate in the responses to both mechanical and acidotic stimuli to mediate normal touch and pain sensation. ASIC3, a member of the DEG/ENaC family, forms heteromultimers in neurons with other DEG/ENaC subunits, ASIC1 and ASIC2, to generate H+-gated cation channels (8Xie J. Price M.P. Berger A.L. Welsh M.J.

ASIC3 shares the overall structure of DEG/ENaC proteins, including two transmembrane domains, a large extracellular loop containing 14 conserved cysteines, and intracellular N and C termini (11Mano I. Driscoll M. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 568-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 12Benos D.J. Stanton B.A. J. Physiol. (Lond). 1999; 520: 631-644Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The intracellular domains of ASIC subunits might have several functions, including localizing the channels, controlling the number of channels on the cell surface, regulating channel function, and forming part of a scaffold important for the response to mechanical stimuli (11Mano I. Driscoll M. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 568-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 12Benos D.J. Stanton B.A. J. Physiol. (Lond). 1999; 520: 631-644Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 13Welsh M.J.

Two proteins have been shown to interact with the intracellular domains of ASIC channels. The C termini of ASIC1 and ASIC2 share homology with type II PDZ (PSD-95, Drosophila discslarge protein, zonula occludens protein-1)-binding domains and bind PICK1 (protein interacting with C kinase-1) (14Hruska-Hageman A.M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 5203-5208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). PICK1 may facilitate the interaction of ASIC2a with protein kinase C, and the interaction between ASIC1 and PICK1, regulated by phosphorylation, may provide a mechanism to control the cellular localization of ASIC1 (16Baron A. Deval E. Salinas M. Lingueglia E. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50463-50468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Leonard A.S. Yermolaieva O. Hruska-Hageman A. Askwith C.C. Price M.P. Wemmie J.A. Welsh M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2029-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The ASIC3 C terminus shares homology with type I PDZ-binding motifs. CIPP (channel-interacting PDZ domain protein), which contains four PDZ domains, is reported to interact with the ASIC3 C terminus and increase H+-gated current (18Anzai N. Deval E. Schaefer L. Friend V. Lazdunski M. Lingueglia E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16655-16661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The potential importance of protein-protein interactions for ASIC3 function led us to ask what proteins bind its intracellular domains. To identify interacting proteins, we used the yeast two-hybrid system and a candidate gene approach. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Construction of the bait plasmid, hASIC3 (residues 476–531), in the GAL4(DB) vector pAS2-1 (Clontech) was described previously (14Hruska-Hageman A.M. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This bait construct was transformed into the PJ692A yeast strain using the lithium acetate procedure and mated with yeast strain Y187 pretransformed with the human brain Match-maker cDNA library (Clontech). The mRNA source was a normal, whole brain from a 37-year old Caucasian male as reported on the Clontech product analysis certificate. Mated cells were plated on Leu-/Trp-/His- plates supplemented with 5 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and grown for 10 days at 30 °C before positive clones were picked and streaked on plates lacking adenine, His, Leu, and Trp. Library plasmids from clones that grew in the absence of adenine, His, Leu, and Trp and that tested positive for β-galactosidase expression were isolated. They were cotransformed with either the bait vector or the original pAS2-1 vector into PJ69-2A to confirm the interaction. Those that were specific for the bait were sequenced. DNA Constructs—hASIC3 (residues 476–531), hASIC1 (residues 459–528), hASIC2 (residues 470–512), hαENaC (residues 589–669), and hβENaC (residues 559–640) in the GAL4(DB) vector pAS2-1 and the full-length mASIC3 construct in pMT3 were described previously (14Hruska-Hageman A.M. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The hASIC3 deletion constructs used for the yeast two-hybrid experiments were made by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for residues 476–527 and subcloning using PCR to amplify and insert the C-terminal deletions of hASIC3 residues 476–523, 476–513, and 513–531 into the unique EcoRI and BamHI sites of the GAL(DB) vector. Point mutations in the C terminus of the hASIC3 (residues 476–531) in pAS2-1 (see Fig. 1C) were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The mASIC3Δ4 (mASIC3 minus the C-terminal 4 amino acids) construct in pMT3 was also made using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit. The GFP-tagged rat PSD-95 construct was a gift from David Bredt, the Myc-tagged mouse Lin-7b construct was a gift from Ben Margolis, the FLAG-tagged mouse MAGI-1b used in the coimmunoprecipitation experiments was a gift from Irina Dobrosotskaya, the Myc-tagged PSD-95 construct was a gift from Johannes Hell, and the HA-tagged mouse PIST (PDZ protein interacting specifically with TC10) was a gift from Ian Macara. The rat ASIC3 cDNA (used in the electrophysiology studies) was cloned by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR of RNA isolated from Sprague-Dawley rat dorsal root ganglia using the 5′ primer 5′-CCA TCG ATG GAG CCA TGA AAC CTC GCT CCG GAC TGG AGG AGG CCC AG-3′ and the 3′ primer 5′-TCC CAC CGT ACC TGT TAC CTC GTC ACA AGG CTC TAG GGG GTA CCC C-3′. Mouse ASIC1a was cloned as described previously (10Benson C.J. Xie J. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Henss J.M. Welsh M.J. Snyder P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2338-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The rat ASIC3Δ4 construct (rASIC3 minus the C-terminal 4 amino acids) and the mouse ASIC1vtrl construct in which the residues VTRL were substituted for the last 4 amino acids of ASIC1a were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and were cloned into pMT3 for expression in CHO cells. All plasmid constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Antibodies—Anti-mASIC3 (anti-DRASIC) and anti-hASIC1 (anti-hASIC) were described previously (3Price M.P. McIllwrath S.L. Xie J. Cheng C.

(Santa Cruz, CA), and mouse monoclonal anti-Myc (clone 9E10) was from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Iowa City, IA). COS-7 and CHO Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells were maintained in culture with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. COS-7 cells were transfected by electroporation using 107 cells with 20–30 μg of plasmid DNA at a 1:1 ratio (ASIC construct or empty vector:interacting protein construct or empty vector). CHO cells were cultured in F12 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C. CHO cells were transfected with cDNAs using cationic lipid (TransFast, Promega) following the manufacturer's recommendations. ASIC subunits (0.18 μg/1.5 ml) and PDZ proteins (or dsRed as a control cDNA) (1.82 μg/1.5 ml) were cotransfected at a 1:10 ratio. cDNA for green fluorescent protein (0.33 μg/1.5 ml) was also expressed to facilitate detection of transfected cells by epifluorescence. We have found that >90% of green cells generated ASIC-like current and <5% of non-green cells have acid-activated current. CHO cells were studied 48–72 h after transfection. Immunoprecipitation from COS-7 Cells—Transfected cells were lysed 48 h post-transfection at 4 °C in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A) for PSD-95-GFP and (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 1% Triton X-100, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A) for FLAG-MAGI-1b, Myc-Lin-7b, and HA-PIST as described previously (20Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27295-27300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We used 5% of the lysate for Western blot, and the remainder was incubated with the indicated antibody overnight at 4 °C. Proteins were separated on 8% (10% for Myc-Lin-7b) SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Western blots were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin and incubated first with primary antibody (anti-mASIC3 serum (1:5000), anti-hASIC serum (1: 5000), anti-PSD-95 (1:15,000), anti-MAGI-1 (1:250), anti-Lin-7 (1:2500), or anti-HA (1:7500)) and then with either a horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (1:5000) (Amersham Biosciences) or horseradish peroxidase-linked Protein A (1:10,000) (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Immunoflourescence—COS-7 cells were grown on chamber slides coated with collagen. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, blocked with SuperBlock (Pierce), and incubated with primary antibodies anti-mASIC3 serum (1:750) and anti-PSD-95 (1:8000), anti-Myc (1:1000), or anti-HA (1:250); guinea pig anti-ASIC3 (1:600) and anti-Myc (1:1000) followed by the secondary antibodies goat anti-rabbit Alexa 568 (1:1250) and goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 (1:1250); or goat anti-guinea pig Alexa 568 (1:1250) and goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 (1:1250) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Staining was visualized using a confocal microscope (Bio-Rad 1024). RT-PCR—For RT-PCR analysis, first strand cDNA was synthesized with Superscript II (Invitrogen) with random hexamer primers using mouse brain, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglion RNA. The following primers were used for PCR amplification: MAGI-1b, 5′-ATGATCCCTCCTAAAATCGCT-3′ and 5′-CTTCCGGAACTCCTTGTGCAC-3′ (138-bp band); PIST, 5′-GGACAGCCTGCGGATAGATGT-3′ and 5′-ACGATAGCGGTGTCCACTCTC-3′ (215-bp band); Lin-7b, 5′-AGCGGAGAGCTGCCCCCGCAG-3′ and 5′-ATGAGCCCGCACCTCGGCGCT-3′ (139-bp band); ASIC3, 5′-GGGGAGTTCCACCATAAGACCACC-3′ and 5′-CTTCCAGATGGGCAGATACTCCTC-3′ (450-bp band); PSD-95, 5′-TCAGGTCTGGGCTTCAGCATC-3′ and 5′-CCGGCGCATGACGTAGAGGCG-3′ (113-bp band). The cycling parameters using the RoboCycler thermocycler (Stratagene) consisted of 40 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. Immunoprecipitation from Tissue—Rat tissues (brain, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia) were isolated and frozen at -80 °C.

Protein A-Sepharose (Pierce) (3–5 mg, preswollen and washed three times with TBS (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) was added to the samples and mixed for 2.5 h. The immunocomplexes were sedimented by centrifugation and washed three times with 1% Triton X-100 in TBS and once with 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, before being extracted with 20 μl of SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 10% sucrose, 125 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8) for 20 min at 60 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in TBS (TBS-bovine serum albumin) and incubated with anti-PSD-95 (1:1000), anti-mASIC3 (1: 250), or anti-hASIC 6.4 (1:1000) affinity-purified antibody for 2 h. The blots were washed five times with TBS-bovine serum albumin, incubated with horseradish-peroxidase-labeled protein A (1:10,000), washed with 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS, and developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce). Electrophysiology—Whole-cell patch clamp recordings (at -70 mV) from CHO cells were performed with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and acquired and analyzed with Pulse/Pulsefit 8.30 (HEKA Electronics, Lambrecht, Germany) and Igor Pro 3.16 (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) software. Experiments were performed at room temperature. Currents were filtered at 5 kHz and sampled at 2 or 0.2 kHz. Series resistance was compensated by at least 50%. Micropipettes (2–5 megaohms) were filled with internal solution: 100 mm KCl, 10 mm EGTA, 40 mm HEPES, and 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4 with KOH.

Kinetics of desensitization were fit with single exponential equations, and time constants (τ) are reported. Statistical differences were assessed by two-tailed Student's t test. Surface Biotinylation—Surface proteins on 48-h post-transfected COS-7 cells were labeled with cell-impermeable EZ-Link sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin (Pierce), 0.25 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, at 4 °C for 20 min following the manufacturer's recommendations. After labeling, cells were washed two times with TBS and lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A). Cell surface proteins were isolated by incubating 500 μg of the lysate with immobilized neutravidin beads (Pierce) at 4 °C for 2 h. Total ASIC3 protein was isolated by incubating 500 μg of the same lysate as above with anti-mASIC3 antibodies at 4 °C for 2 h followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose (prewashed as above). The bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer (2% SDS, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 10% sucrose, 125 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8) for 20 min at 65 °C, subjected to SDS-PAGE, Western blotted with anti-mASIC3 antibodies, and developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce). We used 10 μg of the total lysate for Western blotting. Identification of MAGI-1b, Lin-7b, and PIST with a Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—To find proteins that interact with ASIC3, we used its intracellular C terminus as the bait to screen a human brain cDNA library in the yeast two-hybrid system. We identified three clones specific for the bait: MAGI-1b (amino acids 642–1287), Lin-7b (amino acids 40–207), and PIST (amino acids 46–462). Each clone was missing sequence that encoded the N-terminal portion of the protein but included the C-terminal end. All three clones encoded at least one PDZ domain. MAGI-1b is a membrane-associated guanylate kinase that contains two WW domains, a guanylate kinase domain, and five PDZ domains (22Dobrosotskaya I. Guy R.K. James G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31589-31597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The clone we identified contained PDZ domains 2–5. MAGI-1b is a member of a family of MAGI proteins, and several different splice variants of MAGI-1 have been identified including MAGI-1a, -1b, and -1c (22Dobrosotskaya I. Guy R.K. James G.L. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4189-4199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both Lin-7b and MAGI isoforms are thought to provide a scaffold linking receptors and channels with cytoskeletal proteins and enzymes at sites of cell-cell contact such as tight junctions in epithelial cells and synapses in neurons. PIST is an intracellular protein first identified by its interaction with TC10, a Rho GTPase (27Neudauer C.L. Joberty G. Macara I.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). PIST contains two coiled-coil domains, a leucine zipper domain embedded in the second coiled-coil domain, and a PDZ domain at its C terminus. Splice variants of PIST, such as CAL (CFTR-associated ligand) and FIG (fused in glioblastoma), are thought to participate in the trafficking of proteins out of the trans-Golgi network and retention of membrane proteins inside the cell (28Cheng J. Moyer B.D. Milewski M. Loffing J. Ikeda M. Mickle J.E. Cutting G.R. Li M. Stanton B.A. Guggino W.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 29456-29465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The interaction of MAGI-1b, Lin-7b, and PIST was specific for the ASIC3 C terminus; the C termini of ASIC1, ASIC2, αENaC, and βENaC failed to interact with these proteins (Fig. 1A). Deleting the distal half of the ASIC3 C terminus eliminated the interaction with all three proteins, whereas eliminating the N-terminal half had no effect (Fig. 1B). Moreover deleting the last 4 or 8 C-terminal residues also abolished the interaction. These results suggested that ASIC3 interacts with the three PDZ domain proteins via a PDZ-binding motif at its C terminus. The C-terminal 4 residues of hASIC3 (VTQL) correspond to a type I PDZ-binding motif (X(S/T)X(V/L/I) where X is any amino acid) (30Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Mutating the Leu at the 0 position to Ala abolished the interaction with MAGI-1b, Lin-7b, and PIST (Fig. 1C). In addition, mutating the Thr at the -2 position abolished the interaction with MAGI-1b and Lin-7b (PIST was not tested). In contrast, mutating the -3 Val had no effect on the interactions. Mutation of the -1 Gln did not alter the interaction with MAGI-1b or Lin-7b but disrupted the interaction with PIST. Thus, binding conforms to an interaction between the ASIC3 C terminus and PDZ domains in MAGI-1b, Lin-7b, and PIST most likely through their PDZ domains. ASIC3 Interacts with MAGI-1b, Lin-7b, and PIST in COS-7 Cells—To test the interaction between ASIC3 and these proteins, we transfected COS-7 cells with mouse ASIC3 and epitope-tagged MAGI-1b, Lin-7b, and PIST. Immunoprecipitating ASIC3 co-precipitated each of these PDZ proteins (Fig. 2). We used PIST to test the importance of the C-terminal 4 residues in the interaction with PDZ domain-containing proteins. Deleting the last 4 residues of ASIC3 (ASIC3Δ4) prevented co-precipitation of PIST. PSD-95 Interacts with ASIC3 and Requires Its PDZ-binding Domain—In addition to their interaction with ASIC3, previous studies showed that the PDZ domain-containing proteins MAGI-2 (the major neuronal MAGI protein) and Lin-7 interact with the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunits (26Jo K. Derin R. Li M. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4189-4199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Irie M. Yao I. Deguchi M. Toyoda A. Sudhof T.C. Takai Y. J. Biol.

Previous studies showed that the PDZ domain scaffolding protein PSD-95 also interacts with NR2 subunits (32Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar). PSD-95 contains a Src homology 3 domain, a guanylate kinase domain, and three N-terminal PDZ domains (33Cho K.O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). In addition, both MAGI-2 and PSD-95 interacted with shaker type K+ channels and the neuronal cell surface molecule neuroligin (31Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Irie M. Yao I. Deguchi M.

Supporting this hypothesis, we found that ASIC3 co-immunoprecipitated PSD-95, and PSD-95 co-precipitated ASIC3 in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3, A and B). As controls, neither ASIC1a nor ASIC3 missing its C-terminal 4 residues co-precipitated PSD-95 (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that ASIC3 interacts with PSD-95 through its PDZ-bi"

The extent of cholesterol esterification by the ER-resident protein, acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyl-transferase (ACAT), has become the standard method for monitoring cholesterol transport to the ER and is assumed to reflect the regulatory pool of ER cholesterol. The oxysterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), is thought to trigger intracellular cholesterol transport to the ER. In support of this contention, we confirmed previous reports that 25HC activates cholesterol esterification and is a potent suppressor of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) pathway. Processing of the ER membrane-bound SREBP into a soluble transcription factor is controlled by cholesterol levels in the ER. In this study, we addressed whether or not cholesterol esterification necessarily reflects cholesterol movement to the cholesterol homeostatic machinery in the ER as determined by SREBP processing. We found that three agents that inhibited the ability of 25HC to induce cholesterol esterification (progesterone, nigericin, and monensin) did not have a corresponding effect on 25HC suppression of SREBP processing. Moreover, ACAT inhibition did not alter the sensitivity of SREBP processing to 25HC. Therefore, cholesterol esterification by the ER-resident protein ACAT is dissociable from cholesterol transport to the cholesterol homeostatic machinery in the ER. In light of our results, we question the security of previous work that has inferred cholesterol transport to the ER regulatory pool based solely on cholesterol esterification.

Although cholesterol is essential in mammalian cells, excess unesterified cholesterol is toxic; therefore, cells maintain their concentrations within narrow limits. Low levels of cholesterol are sensed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; 25HC, 25-hydroxycholesterol; ACAT, acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyl-transferase; CHO-K1, Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells; INSIG, insulin-induced gene; LDL, low density lipoprotein; NBS, newborn calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PLAP, placental alkaline phosphatase; SCAP, SREBP-cleavage activating protein; SREBP, sterol-regulatory element binding protein; CMV, cytomegalovirus.1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; 25HC, 25-hydroxycholesterol; ACAT, acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyl-transferase; CHO-K1, Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells; INSIG, insulin-induced gene; LDL, low density lipoprotein; NBS, newborn calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PLAP, placental alkaline phosphatase; SCAP, SREBP-cleavage activating protein; SREBP, sterol-regulatory element binding protein; CMV, cytomegalovirus. and this information is transduced into the expression of multiple homeostatic genes (1Brown M.S.

Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 534-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Key to this system is a family of membrane-bound transcription factors, sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which control enzyme levels in cholesterol synthesis, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, as well as the synthesis of low density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptors, which mediate endocytosis of cholesterol-rich LDL particles (4Rawson R.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Newly synthesized SREBPs form a complex in the ER with the polytopic membrane protein, SREBP cleavage activating protein (SCAP). SCAP serves as both sterol sensor and escort protein for SREBP. When cellular cholesterol levels are sufficient, the SREBP·SCAP complex is tethered in the ER through interaction of SCAP with a retention protein, INSIG-1 (5Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12753-12758Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). When cholesterol levels fall, SCAP adopts a conformation that allows dissociation from INSIG proteins and allows the SREBP·SCAP complex to bud from the ER and move to the Golgi via COPII vesicles (7Brown A.J.

This cleavage event releases the soluble amino-terminal domain of SREBP, which then can enter the nucleus as an active, positive transcription factor. Negative feedback regulation by sterols occurs at the level of SCAP-mediated exit of SREBP from the ER (reviewed in Ref. 4Rawson R.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The ER is home to the principal effectors of cellular cholesterol homeostasis (10Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition to SCAP, INSIGs, and SREBPs, these include 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyl-transferase (ACAT). ACAT catalyzes the esterification of cholesterol, apparently in response to an expanded ER cholesterol pool. This esterification is believed to be activated as a means to detoxify excess free cholesterol, and the esters are deposited in cytosolic lipid droplets (11Simons K. Ikonen E. Science. 2000; 290: 1721-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). Because of the technical difficulties of directly determining cholesterol movement in the cell (12Scheidt H.A. Muller P. Herrmann A. Huster D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45563-45569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), indirect measures are usually employed. The extent of cholesterol esterification has become the standard method for monitoring cholesterol transport to the ER and is assumed to reflect the regulatory pool of ER cholesterol (e.g. Refs. 13Lange Y. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13103-13108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar and 14Debry P. Nash E.A. Neklason D.W. Metherall J.E. J. Biol.

Certain oxidized forms of cholesterol (so-called oxysterols) can be produced enzymically and contribute to cellular cholesterol homeostasis. These oxysterols possess oxygen-containing functional groups on their side chains and include 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol. These sterols are far more potent suppressors of SREBP processing when added to intact cells than cholesterol (15Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L.

Physiol. 2001; 281: G293-G301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, these oxysterols are not sensed directly by SCAP as SCAP undergoes a conformational change in response to cholesterol but not these side-chain oxygenated sterols (7Brown A.J. Sun L. Feramisco J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 237-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, we proposed that these oxysterols may inhibit SREBP processing by causing intracellular cholesterol transport to the ER, where cholesterol produces a conformational change in SCAP (7Brown A.J. Sun L. Feramisco J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 237-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The idea that oxysterols like 25HC trigger movement of cholesterol to the ER is based on the well-documented ability of 25HC to increase cholesterol esterification (13Lange Y. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13103-13108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 19Brown M.S. Dana S.E. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol.

In this study, we addressed whether or not cholesterol esterification by the ER-resident protein ACAT necessarily reflects cholesterol movement to the cholesterol homeostatic machinery in the ER as determined by SREBP processing. We employed 25HC, a commonly used model oxysterol, to elicit cholesterol transport, and a number of pharmacologic agents that inhibit 25HC-induced cholesterol esterification. Materials—All solvents were analytical reagent- or high performance liquid chromatography-grade (Crown Scientific). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1 mixture) was obtained from JRH Biosciences. l-Glutamine, newborn calf serum (NBS), and penicillin-streptomycin were obtained from Invitrogen. Lipoprotein-deficient newborn calf serum was prepared as described previously (22Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Cholesterol, compactin, dl-dithiothreitol, 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, mevalonate, monensin, nigericin, oleoylcoenzyme A, and Sandoz 58-035 were obtained from Sigma. 25-Hydroxycholesterol (cholest-5-en-3β,25-diol; 25HC) and progesterone were obtained from Steraloids.

Cell Culture—Chinese hamster ovary cells K1 (CHO-K1) were grown in monolayer in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells were grown in 1:1 (v/v) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:Ham's F-12 containing penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mm), supplemented with various sera. The different media used were supplemented as follows: Medium A, 10% (v/v) NBS; Medium B, 5% NBS; Medium C, 5% lipoprotein deficient NBS; Medium D, 5% lipoprotein-deficient NBS plus 5 μm compactin and 50 μm mevalonate. Compactin, mevalonate, sterols, and other test agents were added in ethanol. Within an experiment, the final ethanol concentration was kept constant between conditions and did not exceed 0.25% v/v. Cholesterol Esterification—The effect of different compounds on cholesterol esterification was tested using a method described by Lange and colleagues with minor modifications (10Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). On day 0, CHO-K1 cells were set up (in triplicate) at a density of 4 × 105 cells/60-mm dish in medium A. On day 1, cells were switched to medium C and incubated for 16 h. On day 2, cells were pulse-labeled with [3H]cholesterol complexed to 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (10 min, 4 °C). After washing with a 0.5 mg/ml solution of bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (3 × 1 ml, 4 °C), cells were incubated with medium C plus test agents (4 h, 37 °C). Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with 0.1 m NaOH (1 ml). Cell lysate was neutralized by 0.1 m HCl. Methanol was added to cell lysate, and lipids were extracted with hexane. Hexane was evaporated, and samples were redissolved in 60 μl of hexane for thin layer chromatography (TLC). [3H]Cholesteryl ester and [3H]cholesterol were separated on Silica Gel 60 F254 TLC plates (Merck) using heptane:diethyl ether:glacial acetic acid (90:30:1, v/v). Bands, visualized with iodine, were excised and eluted from the silica using methanol (1 ml) followed by diethyl ether (1 ml) with vortex mixing. Radioactivity was measured by β-scintillation counting (Packard Tri-Carb 2100TR Liquid Scintillation Analyzer) using Ultima Gold scintillation liquid (5 ml). Cholesterol esterification is expressed as [3H]cholesteryl ester as a percentage of total radioactivity ([3H]cholesterol plus [3H]cholesteryl ester). In some experiments with ACAT inhibition, cells were incubated for 16 h with medium D containing [3H]cholesterol (0.4 μCi/well added in ethanol), and the indicated concentrations of 25HC in the presence or absence of the ACAT inhibitor, Sandoz 58-035 (0.5 μg/ml). Cells were washed and harvested, lipids were extracted, and the extent of cholesterol esterification was determined as described above. ACAT Enzyme Activity—On day 0, CHO-K1 cells were plated at a density of 106 cells/100-mm dish in medium A (7 dishes per condition). On day 1, cells were switched to medium C and incubated for 16 h. On day 2, cells were incubated in medium C in the absence and presence of progesterone (10 μm) for 4 h. Cells were washed with PBS, harvested, and resuspended in 1 ml of Buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH at pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm sodium EDTA, 5 mm sodium EGTA, and 250 mm sucrose). Cells were lysed by passing through a syringe needle (22 gauge, 30 times), and then centrifuged (1,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). The post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged (20,800 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). The pellet was resuspended in Buffer B (0.1 m Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Microsomal protein was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). ACAT activity in microsomal fractions was determined by the method of Billheimer and colleagues (27Billheimer J.T. Tavani D. Nes W.R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 111: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The reaction contained 200 μg of microsomal protein in Buffer B plus 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg of cholesterol complexed to methyl-β-cyclodextrin (7Brown A.J. Sun L. Feramisco J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 237-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), and [14C]oleoyl-CoA (24 μm, 0.1 μCi). The reaction mixture was preincubated (30 min, 37 °C) in a shaking water bath. The reaction was started by the addition of [14C]oleoyl-CoA and stopped after 10 min by addition of ice-cold ethanol (1 ml). Lipids were extracted, and the extent of cholesterol esterification was determined as described above. ACAT activity was expressed as picomoles of [14C]cholesteryl ester formed per min per mg of microsomal protein. Analysis of SREBP Processing by Western Blotting—On day 0, CHO-K1 cells were set up at 8 × 105 cells/100-mm dish (in duplicate) in medium B. On day 2, cells were switched to medium D and incubated for 16 h. On day 3, cells were switched to fresh medium D and incubated with various additions (0–1 μg/ml 25HC with or without 10 μm progesterone) for 0–4 h. Cells were harvested, and membrane and nuclear extract fractions were prepared and analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described previously (7Brown A.J. Sun L. Feramisco J.D. Brown M.S.

On day 1, triplicate wells of cells were refed fresh medium A and then transfected with the indicated plasmids using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics). A ratio of 1:3 plasmid DNA to FuGENE 6 reagent was used. After incubation for 5–6 h, the cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated with medium D in the absence or presence of test agents as indicated in the figure legends. After incubation for 16 h, the medium was removed and centrifuged (20,800 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). An aliquot of supernatant (50 μl) was diluted, heat-treated (30 min, 65 °C) to inactivate non-placental alkaline phosphatase, and assayed for secreted alkaline phosphatase activity using the SEAP gene reporter assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 10–20 min, chemiluminescence was quantified on a Wallac Microbeta luminometer. Cells were lysed with 0.1 m NaOH (0.25 ml), and proteins were determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce) to normalize secreted alkaline phosphatase activity (expressed as relative light units). The regulatory pool of cholesterol is located in the ER and is key to how mammalian cells sense and respond to changes in cellular cholesterol levels. The aim of this study was to gain greater insight into how cellular cholesterol levels are regulated via transport of cholesterol to the cholesterol homeostatic machinery in the ER. We have focused on cholesterol transport induced by the oxysterol, 25HC. Although the precise mechanism remains obscure, the current view is that oxysterols like 25HC trigger intracellular cholesterol transport to the ER (29Soccio R.E. Breslow J.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1150-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In support of this contention, others have shown that 25HC activates cholesterol esterification (e.g. (13Lange Y.

Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Our results confirm these previous reports. When the plasma membrane of CHO-K1 cells was pulsed with [3H]cholesterol, 25HC stimulated esterification of the labeled cholesterol within an hour (Fig. 1A). 25HC suppressed SREBP processing to the mature nuclear form within a similar time-frame (Fig. 1B). SREBP processing is determined under conditions of sterol deprivation, i.e. in lipoprotein-deficient medium in the presence of a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor (compactin). Therefore, suppression of SREBP processing by 25HC is consistent with the idea that 25HC shifts an existing pool of cellular cholesterol to the cholesterol homeostatic machinery in the ER. To enable higher sample throughput and allow ready quantification, we adopted a reporter assay devised by Sakai et al. (25Sakai J. Rawson R.B. Espenshade P.J. Cheng D. Seegmiller A.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) to measure SREBP processing (Fig. 2A). In agreement with previous work (25Sakai J.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12675-12680Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), more PLAP was secreted when cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding the SREBP escort protein, SCAP (data not shown), whereas less PLAP was secreted when cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding the SREBP·SCAP retention protein, INSIG-1 (Fig. 2B). As predicted, more PLAP was secreted in the absence of sterols (active SREBP pathway) than in the presence of sterols (inactive SREBP pathway) (Fig. 2B). It was previously noted that 25HC was far more potent in suppressing SREBP processing than cholesterol added in ethanol (15Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). In support of that work, we found that the suppression of PLAP-BP2 processing was due to the addition of 25HC rather than cholesterol (Fig. 2C). The effect of various inhibitors of intracellular cholesterol traffic, especially transport to the ER, is gauged on the ability of these compounds to inhibit cholesterol esterification induced by LDL or 25HC. One of the commonly used compounds to disrupt intracellular traffic, particularly cholesterol movement from plasma membrane to ER, is the steroid hormone, progesterone (31Lange Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3411-3414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Wiegand V. Chang T.Y. Strauss 3rd, J.F. Fahrenholz F. Gimpl G. Faseb J. 2003; 17: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Previously (21Miller S.C. Melnykovych G. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 991-999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Zhang J.

Lipids. 2002; 37: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), progesterone was found to inhibit 25HC-induced cholesterol esterification, indicating that progesterone inhibits cholesterol delivery to the ER. The question is whether or not progesterone also inhibits the suppressive effect of 25HC on SREBP processing (Fig. 3A). If progesterone were to inhibit the expansion of 25HC of the ER regulatory pool of cholesterol, it would also be predicted to relieve 25HC-mediated suppression of SREBP-2 processing, causing increased nuclear SREBP-2. In accordance with previous reports (21Miller S.C. Melnykovych G. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 991-999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Zhang J. Ming L.J. Sjovall J. Cook H.W. Ridgway N.D.

Lipids. 2002; 37: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), we found that progesterone inhibited 25HC-induced cholesterol esterification (Fig. 3B). However, contrary to expectations, progesterone treatment tended to decrease the nuclear form of SREBP-2 (Fig. 3C). Moreover, there was no indication that the response of SREBP processing to 25HC was blunted (Fig. 3C). This result was confirmed using the PLAP-BP2 reporter assay, i.e. 25HC still inhibited PLAP-BP2 processing in the presence of progesterone (Fig. 3D). In further experiments, varying concentrations of progesterone and two other agents (nigericin and monensin) were tested for their ability to block the effect of 25HC on cholesterol esterification and suppression of PLAP-BP2 processing. Like progesterone, nigericin, a potassium ionophore, and monensin, a sodium ionophore, were shown previously to inhibit the ability of 25HC to stimulate cholesterol esterification (35Lange Y. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29371-29374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Underwood K.W. Jacobs N.L. Howley A. Liscum L. J. Biol.

Results in Fig. 4 are presented relative to the effect induced by 1 μg/ml 25HC, so that 0% signifies that this effect was completely blocked, whereas 100% signifies that the effect was unaltered. In agreement with previous studies (21Miller S.C. Melnykovych G. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 991-999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Zhang J. Ming L.J. Sjovall J. Cook H.W. Ridgway N.D.

Howley A. Liscum L. J. Biol.

Importantly, these agents did not inhibit the ability of 25HC to suppress PLAP-BP2 processing (Fig. 4, B, D, and F), indicating that cholesterol esterification does not necessarily reflect cholesterol transport to the regulatory pool in the ER. To validate our approach using pharmacologic agents, we performed positive control experiments. To date, the hypocholesterolemic agent, LY295427, is the only compound shown to block the effect of 25HC both in increasing cholesterol esterification and suppressing SREBP processing (37Janowski B.A. Shan B. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45408-45416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). LY295427 is a 3α-hydroxysteroid (4α-allylcholestan-3α-ol) and was identified for its ability to activate the LDL-receptor promoter in the presence of 25HC (38Lin H.S. Rampersaud A.A. Archer R.A. Pawlak J.M. Beavers L.S. Schmidt R.J. Kauffman R.F. Bensch W.R. Bumol T.F. Apelgren L.D. Eacho P.I. Perry D.N. McClure D.B. Gadski R.A. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Its 3β-isomer (LY306039) is inactive (37Janowski B.A. Shan B. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45408-45416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and was used as a control. We found that LY295427 (but not LY306039) inhibited 25HC-induced effects on cholesterol esterification at relatively high concentrations (Fig. 5A). In agreement with previous work (30Janowski B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12675-12680Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 37Janowski B.A. Shan B. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45408-45416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we found that the active isomer, LY295427, also inhibited the effect of 25HC of suppressing SREBP (PLAP-BP2) processing and that this effect was maximal at 20 μm (Fig. 5B). Therefore, our experiments with LY295427 confirm previous reports, and indicate the soundness of our pharmacologic approach to dissect the effects of 25HC on cholesterol esterification and SREBP processing. A trivial explanation of why a pharmacologic agent could have a different effect on cholesterol esterification by ACAT and on the cholesterol homeostatic machinery would be that the agent inhibits ACAT activity, and therefore may not directly influence cholesterol transport to the ER. Others have reported that nigericin and monensin do not inhibit ACAT activity (39Lange Y. Ye J. Strebel F. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1092-1097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, under some (40Goldstein J.L. Faust J.R. Dygos J.H. Chorvat R.J. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 1877-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 41Mazzone T. Krishna M. Lange Y. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 544-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but not all circumstances (31Lange Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3411-3414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Lange Y. Ye J. Strebel F. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1092-1097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), progesterone can inhibit ACAT activity. Therefore, we determined ACAT activity in membrane microsomes prepared from CHO-K1 cells treated with 10 μm progesterone for 4 h. We found no effect of progesterone (mean ± S.E.: 454 ± 17 versus 430 ± 22 pmol/min/mg of protein for ethanol control versus progesterone, respectively). This in vitro assay was performed under conditions of cholesterol excess, meaning that substrate delivery to the enzyme was not limiting. Therefore, the ability of progesterone to block 25HC stimulation of cholesterol esterification in intact cells is not due to a direct inhibitory effect on ACAT activation, supporting the view that progesterone inhibits intracellular cholesterol transport. ACAT is proposed to maintain the regulatory pool of ER cholesterol through esterification. Inhibition of ACAT might then be predicted to expand the regulatory cholesterol pool and hence to suppress SREBP processing. Under conditions employed in the PLAP-BP2 cleavage assay, 25HC induces cholesterol transport to the ER from an existing cellular pool, because the assay is performed in lipoprotein-deficient serum with cholesterol synthesis inhibited. Therefore, inhibition of ACAT might also be predicted to increase the sensitivity of the SREBP pathway to 25HC. The sensitivity of PLAP-BP2 processing to a range of 25HC concentrations was assessed in the presence and absence of the ACAT inhibitor, S58-035 (0.5 μg/ml). The ACAT inhibitor ablated the formation of cholesteryl esters during the 16-h incubation (Fig. 6A). However, ACAT inhibition did not significantly alter the sensitivity of PLAP-BP2 processing to 25HC (Fig. 6B), further indicating that ACAT is distinct from the SREBP·SCAP system in the ER. Mechanisms by which cholesterol is transported to the ER remain largely undefined. By questioning our current knowledge based on cholesterol esterification, we have made an initial and necessary step toward re-evaluating cholesterol transport to the regulatory pool in the ER. We present two lines of evidence that cholesterol esterification by the ER-resident protein, ACAT, is dissociable from cholesterol transport to the cholesterol homeostatic machinery in the ER. First, three agents that inhibited the ability of 25HC to induce cholesterol esterification did not have a corresponding effect on 25HC suppression of SREBP processing. We demonstrated that our approach is valid, because LY295427, shown previously to block the effect of 25HC on cholesterol esterification and SREBP processing (30Janowski B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12675-12680Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 37Janowski B.A. Shan B. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45408-45416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), did both in our hands. Second, inhibition of ACAT, which should in theory expand the cholesterol content of the ER regulatory pool, did not alter SREBP processing or its response to 25HC. Together, these data indicate that cholesterol transport to ACAT in the ER may be different from cholesterol transport to the homeostatic machinery where SREBP/SCAP resides. Therefore, cholesterol esterification by ACAT may not necessarily reflect cholesterol transport to the ER regulatory pool. Holtta-Vuori and colleagues (42Holtta-Vuori M. Tanhuanpaa K. Mobius W. Somerharju P. Ikonen E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3107-3122Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) arrived at a similar conclusion using a genetic approach. They examined cholesterol metabolism in cells overexpressing the small GTPase, Rab11, and compared it with reports of cholesterol metabolism in cells lacking a functional NPC1 gene. In NPC1-deficient cells, LDL-stimulated cholesterol esterification is impaired while cholesterol synthesis is increased (43Liscum L. Ruggiero R.M. Faust J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), consistent with a role for NPC1 in delivering LDL-cholesterol to the regulatory pool of ER. In Rab11 cells, cholesterol esterification was also impaired, but there was no corresponding change in cholesterol synthesis, which would be expected if cholesterol esterification reflects cholesterol homeostatic mechanisms. The authors concluded that several membrane-trafficking pathways may feed ACAT with cholesterol (42Holtta-Vuori M. Tanhuanpaa K. Mobius W. Somerharju P. Ikonen E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3107-3122Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that there may be more than one pool of ACAT. Subcellular fractionation studies of rat liver concluded that ACAT mostly resides in the rough ER (44Balasubramaniam S. Venkatesan S. Mitropoulos K.A. Peters T.J. Biochem. J. 1978; 174: 863-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 45Hashimoto S. Fogelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8678-8684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, Chang et al. (46Chang C.C. Chen J. Thomas M.A. Cheng D. Del Priore V.A. Newton R.S. Pape M.E. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29532-29540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) showed, by indirect immunofluorescent microscopy, that ACAT in melanoma cells was distributed in a typical ER-like pattern. However, more recently, Khelef et al. (47Khelef N. Buton X. Beatini N. Wang H. Meiner V. Chang T.Y. Farese Jr., R.V. Maxfield F.R. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11218-11224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 48Khelef N. Soe T.T. Quehenberger O. Beatini N. Tabas I. Maxfield F.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) observed in murine macrophages, that a significant fraction of ACAT was in a distinct undefined subcompartment of the ER, close to the trans-Golgi network and endocytic recycling compartment. Further work is required to determine if the dissociation between the effect of 25HC on cholesterol esterification and SREBP processing represents different cholesterol trafficking pathways and/or trafficking to a distinct pool of ACAT. How the ER gains access to the regulatory pool of cholesterol is an important unresolved issue in our understanding of cholesterol homeostasis. The recent finding that the ER is the site of cholesterol-induced cytotoxicity in macrophages (49Feng B. Yao P.M. Li Y. Devlin C.M. Zhang D. Harding H.P. Sweeney M. Rong J.X. Kuriakose G. Fisher E.A. Marks A.R. Ron D. Tabas I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar) further reinforces the importance of increasing our understanding of cholesterol traffic to and from the ER. In light of our results, we question the security of previous work that inferred cholesterol transport to the ER regulatory pool based solely on cholesterol esterification. We suggest that our current understanding of cholesterol transport to the ER, largely based on such studies, may need reassessing. We thank Drs. Michael S. Brown and Joseph L.

FXI circulates as a complex with the glycoprotein high molecular weight kininogen (HK). FXI binds to specific sites (Kd = ∼10 nm, Bmax = ∼1,500/platelet) on the surface of stimulated platelets, where it is efficiently activated by thrombin. The FXI Apple 3 (A3) domain mediates binding to platelets in the presence of HK and zinc ions (Zn2+) or prothrombin and calcium ions. The platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex is the receptor for FXI (Baglia, F. A., Badellino, K. O., Li, C. Q., Lopez, J. A., and Walsh, P. N. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 1662–1668). Using surface plasmon resonance, we determined that FXI binds specifically to glycocalicin, the extracellular domain of GPIbα, in a Zn2+-dependent fashion (Kd = ∼52 nm). We now show that recombinant FXI A3 domain inhibits FXI inbinding to glycocalicin in the presence of Zn2+, whereas the recombinant FXI A1, A2, or A4 domains have no effect. Experiments with full-length recombinant FXI mutants show that, in the presence of Zn2+, glycocalicin binds FXI at a heparin-binding site in A3 (Lys252 and Lys253) and not by amino acids previously shown to be required for platelet binding (Ser248, Arg250, Lys255, Phe260, and Gln263). However, binding in the presence of HK and Zn2+ requires Ser248, Arg250, Lys255, Phe260, and GLn263 and not Lys252 and Lys253. Thus, binding of FXI to GPIbα is mediated by amino acids in the A3 domain in the presence or absence of HK. This interaction is important for the initiation of the consolidation phase of blood coagulation and the generation of thrombin at sites of platelet thrombus formation.

We have previously demonstrated that in the presence of Zn2+ ions alone (i.e. in the absence of added HK), FXI binds to about half the number of sites on activated platelets (19Baglia F.A.

However, it is not clear whether the A3 domain mediates FXI binding to GPIbα and which specific FXI residues are involved in this interaction. Thus, the aim of the present study is to identify the amino acid sequences in FXI that interact with GPIbα under the conditions of Zn2+-dependent and HK and Zn2+-dependent binding of FXI to the activated platelet.

The radiolabeled FXI retained >98% of its biological activity. Preparation of Washed Platelets—Platelets were prepared from normal donors as described (9Greengard J.S. Heeb M.J. Ersdal E. Walsh P.N.

Platelet-rich plasma obtained from citrated human blood was centrifuged, and the platelets were resuspended in calcium-free Hepes-Tyrodes buffer (126 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.38 mm NaH2PO4, 5.6 mm dextrose, 6.2 mm sodium Hepes, 8.8 mm Hepes-free acid, 0.1% bovine serum albumin), pH 6.5, and gel-filtered on a column of Sepharose 2B equilibrated in calcium-free Hepes-Tyrodes buffer, pH 7.2.

All of the incubations were performed at 37 °C without stirring after an initial mixing of the reaction mixture. At various added FXI concentrations, the aliquots were removed (100 μl) and centrifuged through a mixture of silicone oils as described (8Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N.

Preparation of Glycocalicin—Glycocalicin was extracted from human platelets and purified as previously described (26De Cristofaro R. De Candia E. Landolfi R. Rutella S. Hall S.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13268-13273Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Solid Phase Binding of 125I-FXI to Glycocalicin—We utilized a modified method of De Cristofaro et al. (26De Cristofaro R. De Candia E. Landolfi R. Rutella S. Hall S.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13268-13273Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) to examine the binding of 125I-FXI to platelet-bound glycocalicin. Wheat germ lectin (10 μg/ml) was coated on the wells of a solid phase plate (96-well polystrene trays; immulon high protein capacity binding), incubated overnight at 4 °C in 50 mm carbonate buffer, pH 9.50, and removed. The wells were then incubated for 2 h with 1% bovine serum albumin in Hepes-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm Hepes, pH 7.3). After aspiration of the bovine serum albumin solution, purified glycocalicin was added to the wells at a concentration of 20 μg/ml and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After aspiration, the 125I-FXI was applied to the wells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Each sample and blank well was washed with Hepes-buffered saline seven times for 1 min each, dried, and counted in a 1470 Wallac Wizard Gamma Counter. Preparation of Wild Type and Mutant Human Factor XI—The procedures utilized to prepare wild type FXI and the FXI mutants rFXI(R250A), rFXI(K252A), rFXI(K253A), rFXI(K255A), rFXI(F260A), and rFXI(Q263A) were those described by Sun and Gailani (27Sun Y. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29023-29028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced into the wild type human FXI cDNA in vector pBluescript (SK+ version) using a Chameleon site-directed mutagenesis kit, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Proper introduction of the mutation was confirmed by conventional dideoxy chain termination DNA sequencing. cDNAs were subsequently ligated into a mammalian expression vector, pJVCMV, containing the cytomegalovirus promoter. Human fetal kidney fibroblasts (293 cells, 5 × 107 cells) were co-transfected with 40 μg of FXI cDNA/pJVCMV construct and 2 μg of a plasmid RSVneo, which contains a gene conferring resistance to neomycin. Transfection was by electroporation using an Electrocell Manipulator 600 (BTX, San Diego, CA). Transfected cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum for 24 h and then switched to the same medium supplemented with the neomycin analog, G418, at 500 μg/ml. Medium was exchanged every 48 h. G418-resistant clones were transferred to 24-well tissue culture plates, and culture supernatants were tested for protein expression by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, using goat anti-human FXI capture antibody and the same antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for detection, as recommended by the supplier. Clones expressing the highest levels of protein were expanded to confluence in 175-cm2 tissue culture flasks. When the cells had reached confluence, the medium was replaced with 75 ml of serum-free Cellgro complete medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml lima bean trypsin inhibitor, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. This mixture of protease inhibitors prevents activation or degradation of the recombinant protein in the conditioned medium. The medium was exchanged every 48 h. After collection, the conditioned medium was supplemented with benzamidine to a final concentration of 5 mm and stored at –20 °C pending purification. Purification of the Recombinant Proteins—One liter of conditioned medium was passed over a 3-ml column of murine anti-human FXI monoclonal antibody, 1G5.12, linked to Affi-Gel-10 as described previously (27Sun Y. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29023-29028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). After loading, the columns were washed with 10 column volumes of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl (Tris-buffered saline) supplemented with 5 mm benzamidine, followed by elution with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 m sodium thiocyanate, 5 mm benzamidine. Protein-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated in an Amicon concentrator, dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline, and stored at –70 °C. The concentration of recombinant proteins was determined using a dye binding assay (Bio-Rad). All of the recombinant proteins utilized in this study have been extensively characterized as previously reported (28Zhao M. Abdel-Razek T. Sun M.F. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31153-31159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). All of the proteins were shown to be homogeneous and >95% pure by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. ZnCl2-dependent Binding of Factor XI to Glycocalicin—The FXI-binding site on platelets is postulated to reside within the GPIbα subunit of the GPIb-IX-V complex (15Baglia F.A. Jameson B.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4149-4154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), because Bernard-Soulier platelets deficient in this complex are deficient in FXI binding, because two GPIbα ligands, SZ-2 (a monoclonal antibody) and bovine von Willebrand factor, both inhibit FXI binding to platelets, and because FXI was shown to bind specifically to glycocalicin in a Zn2+-dependent fashion (Kdapp = ∼52 nm) by surface plasmon resonance. To confirm and extend our understanding of this interaction, we developed a solid phase binding assay for examining FXI binding to glycocalicin. Fig. 1 demonstrates that FXI binding to glycocalicin in a solid phase assay (Kdapp = ∼20.4 nm ± 0.8) is dependent on the presence of ZnCl2 (25 μm). In the absence of ZnCl2 but the presence of prothrombin (1.2 μm) and 2 mm CaCl2 or in the presence of HK (636 nm), no binding of FXI to glycocalicin was observed. Thus, the binding of FXI to glycocalicin is dependent on physiological concentrations of ZnCl2 but independent of and unaffected by HK or prothrombin, either of which is required for optimal FXI binding to activated platelets. Effects of Recombinant Apple Domains on the Binding of Factor XI to Glycocalicin in the Presence of ZnCl2 (25 μm) or HK (636 nm) and ZnCl2 (25 μm)—Activated platelets expose specific, reversible, high affinity (Kdapp = ∼10 nm) FXI-binding sites (n = 1,500 sites/platelet) that require the presence of HK and ZnCl2, whereas in the presence of ZnCl2 without added HK, FXI binds to about half this number of sites with similar affinity (9Greengard J.S.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because the platelet-binding site resides within the FXI A3 domain (Asn235–Arg266) and comprises residues Ser248, Arg250, Lys255, Phe260, and Gln263 but not Lys252 and Lys253 (19Baglia F.A.

Blood. 2001; 98: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and because the FXI-binding site on platelets is in the GPIbα subunit of the GPIb-IX-V complex, we initially determined whether glycocalicin (the soluble form of GPIbα) interacts with the Apple domains by examining the capacity of each of the recombinant, expressed Apple domains of FXI to compete with FXI for binding to glycocalicin in our solid phase assay. Fig. 2A and Table I show that only the expressed rA3 domain inhibits the binding of FXI to glycocalicin (IC50 = 35 ± 2.5 nm) in the presence of 25 μm ZnCl2 whereas the expressed rA1, rA2, and rA4 domains had no effect. The same experiment was carried out in the presence of both HK (636 nm) and ZnCl2 (25 μm). Fig. 2B and Table I show that both the expressed rA3 domain (IC50 = 35 ± 3 nm) and the A1 domain (IC50 = 5 μm ± 0.3) inhibit the binding of 125I-FXI to glycocalicin in the presence of 25 μm ZnCl2 and 636 nm HK, whereas the expressed A2 and A4 domains had no effect. Thus, the A3 domain of FXI mediates Zn2+-dependent and HK-Zn2+-dependent binding of FXI to glycocalicin. The inhibitory capacity of the rA1 domain in the presence of HK is attributed to the presence of an HK-binding site in the A1 domain of FXI (17Baglia F.A. Jameson B.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol.

A detailed mutational analysis of the platelet and heparin-binding sites has been performed in our laboratory that provides definitive evidence that the amino acids that mediate binding of FXI to platelets (Ser248, Arg250, Lys255, Phe260, and Gln263) are different from those that mediate binding to heparin (Lys252 and Lys253) (21Ho D.H. Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Ho D.H. Badellino K. Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol.

Blood. 2001; 98: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To determine the specific amino acid residues in the A3 domain that mediate FXI binding to glycocalicin in the presence of Zn2+ ions, alanine substitutions were made for residues that comprise the heparin- or platelet-binding site in recombinant FXI, which were then examined for loss of function in the FXI-glycocalicin solid phase assay. Fig. 3A shows that in the presence of ZnCl2 (25 μm), alanine mutations made in the heparin-binding site (K252A and K253A) resulted in a loss of binding, whereas FXI with alanine mutations in the platelet-binding site (S248A, R250A, K255A, F260A, and Q263A) competed normally with 125I-FXI for binding to glycocalicin. The IC50 values for wild type FXI and FXI mutants are recorded in Table II. Thus, in the presence of 25 μm ZnCl2 alone (i.e. without added HK), the binding of FXI to glycocalicin is mediated by residues (Lys252 and Lys253) that comprise the heparin-binding site in the A3 domain of FXI. To corroborate our findings we performed similar experiments with activated platelets instead of glycocalicin. The results depicted in Fig. 3B and Table II demonstrate that in the presence of ZnCl2 (25 μm), alanine mutations made in the heparin-binding site (K252A and K253A) resulted in a loss of binding, whereas FXI with alanine mutations in the platelet-binding site (S248A, K255A, F260A, and Q23A) competed normally with 125I-FXI for binding to activated platelets. Thus, in the presence of 25 μm ZnCl2 alone, the binding of FXI to glycocalicin and to activated platelets is mediated by residues (Lys252 and Lys253) that comprise the heparin-binding site in the A3 domain.Table IIThe effect of factor XI mutants on the binding of factor XI to glycocalicin or gel-filtered platelets in the presence of 25 μm ZnCl2Factor XI mutationLocation of residue on factor XIIC50GlycocalicinPlateletsnmWild type35 ± 2.510 ± 0.9K252AApple 3 domain/heparin-binding site1000 ± 90300 ± 25K253AApple 3 domain/heparin-binding site1000 ± 110300 ± 28S248AApple 3 domain/platelet-binding site33.1 ± 1.510 ± 0.5R250AApple 3 domain/platelet-binding site34 ± 1.910.4 ± 0.6K255AApple 3 domain/platelet-binding site33.8 ± 2.110.5 ± 0.5F260AApple 3 domain/platelet-binding site32.1 ± 3.210.7 ± 0.4Q263AApple 3 domain/platelet-binding site34.8 ± 3.410.2 ± 0.8The results shown represent the mean values (± S.E.) of three experiments, each done in duplicate.

https://openalex.org/W2009768558,"A better understanding of signal transduction mechanisms is of critical importance. Methodologies that allow studies to be done while receptors are incorporated into lipid bilayers are advantageous. One such technique is plasmon-waveguide resonance (PWR) spectroscopy, which can follow changes in conformation accompanying protein-ligand, protein-protein, and protein-lipid interactions occurring in G-protein-coupled receptors in real time with high sensitivity and without the need for molecular labeling. Here we investigated several aspects of human δ-opioid receptor (hDOR)-G-protein interactions: 1) the effect of different types of agonists on the interaction with individual G-protein subtypes; 2) the affinities of the separate G-protein α and βγ subunits to different ligand-occupied states of the receptor; and 3) the effect of the presence of the G-protein on the interactions of the ligand with the receptor. To accomplish this we have incorporated the receptor into a solid supported lipid bilayer in the presence of ligand or G-protein and monitored the PWR spectral changes induced by the reciprocal G-protein or ligand interactions. We found a high degree of selectivity in the interactions of different agonist-bound states of the receptor with the different G-protein subtypes. This has important implications for agonist-directed trafficking and selective drug design. Studies with the separated α and βγ subunits show that cooperativity exists in these interactions. The high affinities of the separated subunits to the receptor point to the possibility of independent promotion of specific signaling events. The presence of G-proteins increased the affinity of agonists to the hDOR, and caused faster binding kinetics and different ligand-induced conformational changes. Because ligand also influences G-protein binding, reciprocity exists between these two binding processes. A better understanding of signal transduction mechanisms is of critical importance. Methodologies that allow studies to be done while receptors are incorporated into lipid bilayers are advantageous. One such technique is plasmon-waveguide resonance (PWR) spectroscopy, which can follow changes in conformation accompanying protein-ligand, protein-protein, and protein-lipid interactions occurring in G-protein-coupled receptors in real time with high sensitivity and without the need for molecular labeling.

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein coupled receptor; hDOR, human δ-opioid receptor; PWR, plasmon-waveguide resonance; GTPγS, guanosine triphosphate γS; DPDPE, c-[d-Pen2,d-Pen5]enkephalin; NTI, naltrindole; TMT-L-Tic, (2S, 3R)-β-methyl-2′, 6′-dimethyltyrosyltetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid; mdeg, millidegree.1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein coupled receptor; hDOR, human δ-opioid receptor; PWR, plasmon-waveguide resonance; GTPγS, guanosine triphosphate γS; DPDPE, c-[d-Pen2,d-Pen5]enkephalin; NTI, naltrindole; TMT-L-Tic, (2S, 3R)-β-methyl-2′, 6′-dimethyltyrosyltetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid; mdeg, millidegree. represent one of the largest families of proteins in mammals, with 5% of the total cell proteins belonging to this group. Together they constitute one of the principal targets of drugs used in pharmacology, especially in the central nervous system. A better understanding of the mechanisms of activation and signal transduction of these proteins seems imperative. Despite their crucial importance, however, very little is known about their structure/function relationships, mainly as a consequence of their low natural abundance and their membrane nature. The opioid receptors belong to this superfamily and consist of three receptor types: δ, μ, and κ (1Knapp R.J. Malatynska E. Collins N. Fang L. Wang J.Y. Hruby V.J. Roeske W.R. Yamamura H.I. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 516-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). These receptors transmit the signals induced by binding of opioid peptides and opiate alkaloids such as morphine and are involved in a plethora of biological events such as stress-induced analgesia, locomotive activity, blood pressure, gastrointestinal motility, learning, and memory. Studies to determine the G-protein subtypes that mediate the intracellular signaling of the opioid receptor systems have shown that functional coupling occurs to the Gi-Go family of G-proteins (2Roerig S.C. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 822-831PubMed Google Scholar, 3Prather P.L. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 997-1003PubMed Google Scholar, 4Prather P.L. McGinn T.M.

Such studies have usually been done using radiolabel assays, in which those interactions are monitored through GTPγS or cAMP assays that measure a downstream effect of the interaction and, most importantly, a response that comes from a mixture of G-protein subtypes. If one wants to monitor the interactions of a receptor with each G-protein subtype separately, one has to either do immunoprecipitation studies with an antibody against each subtype, to fluorescently label each subtype for optical spectroscopic studies, or to prepare different cell lines, each expressing solely one subtype of G-protein together with the receptor of interest. These methodologies in addition to being complex, time-consuming, and relying on the presence of labels, either fluorescent or radioactive, also suffer from the drawback of not providing complete information about these interactions, such as individual affinity constants and the nature of structural changes induced by binding. In our laboratories we have been using plasmon-waveguide resonance (PWR) spectroscopy to investigate the conformational changes occurring upon ligand and G-protein binding to the human δ-opioid receptor (hDOR) incorporated into a solid-supported lipid bilayer (5Salamon Z.

Because of its ability to obtain resonances with light polarized both perpendicular (p-polarization) and parallel (s-polarization) to the resonator surface, PWR can follow changes in conformation accompanying protein-ligand, protein-protein, and protein-lipid interactions occurring in GPCRs in real time with high sensitivity and without the need for molecular labeling. In the present studies we have used PWR to obtain a better understanding of several aspects of G-protein interaction with the hDOR. Thus, we have shown that different agonist-bound states of the hDOR have distinct and selective interactions with different G-protein subtypes. In addition, we have found that the separated α and βγ G-protein subunits are tightly bound to the hDOR, and that the activated receptor can stimulate GDP/GTP exchange in the α subunit in the absence of the βγ subunit. Finally, we have demonstrated that the presence of the G-protein affects ligand binding and conformational changes in the hDOR. We believe these studies provide new insights into the first part of the signal transduction pathway for the hDOR. They should also be important for rational drug design protocols whereby ligands could be designed that target specific pathways, in this way avoiding the known detrimental side effects of certain drugs. Receptor Purification and Characterization—A fully functional receptor, labeled at the C terminus with a myc epitope and His tag, was stably transfected into a Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO-K1) (8Okura T.

The receptor was purified by metal chelating and ligand affinity chromatography and characterized as published previously (6Alves I. Varga E. Salamon Z. Yamamura H.I. Tollin G. Hruby V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48890-48897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 8Okura T. Cowell S.M. Varga E. Burkey T.H. Roeske W.R. Hruby V.J. Yamamura H.I. Eur. J.

For the studies in which the receptor was pre-bound with ligand, the hDOR was preincubated with saturating amounts (at least 1 order of magnitude higher concentration than published binding affinities) of ligand, using two peptide agonists, DPDPE (American Peptide Co.) and deltorphin II (prepared in our laboratory by standard methods of solid phase peptide synthesis (9Misicka A. Lipkowski A.W. Fang L. Knapp R.J. Davis P. Kramer T. Burks T.F. Yamamura H.I. Carr D.B. Hruby V.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1290-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)), two non-peptide agonists, SNC80 (Tocris Inc., Elisville, MO) and (–)-Tan67 (Toray Industries, Kumakura, Japan), a partial agonist, morphine (Sigma), an antagonist, NTI (Sigma), and an inverse agonist, TMT-L-Tic (synthesized in Dr. Hruby's laboratory following published procedures (10Liao S. Lin J. Shenderovich M.D. Han Y. Hosohata K. Davis P. Qiu W. Porreca F. Yamamura H.I. Hruby V.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1997; 7: 3049-3052Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar)). The receptor was incubated with the respective ligand for 1–2 h at 4 °C prior to incorporation into the PWR cell that contained a previously deposited lipid bilayer on the resonator surface. The concentration of the solubilized receptor was determined using a BCA assay (Pierce). The purple reaction product was monitored at 560 nm using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (μQuant, Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.). Following purification, the quality of the receptor protein was assessed by determining the specific activity, i.e. the moles of functional receptor molecules (measured by ligand binding) per mol of receptor protein. This was performed by a radiolabel competition assay using [3H]naltrindole (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to a final concentration of about 0.1 nm DPDPE with concentrations ranging from 10–3 to 10–9m. Details of the methodology used have been published previously (6Alves I. Varga E. Salamon Z. Yamamura H.I. Tollin G. Hruby V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48890-48897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 7Alves I. Cowell S. Salamon Z. Devanathan S. Tollin G. Hruby V.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1248-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The results have shown that about 65% of the total protein corresponds to active hDOR as determined by its ability to bind ligand. Pertussis Toxin Treatment of G-proteins—Pertussis toxin obtained from Sigma was incubated with the G-protein mixture (Calbiochem) in a 1:1 ratio in Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor (1 ml/liter, Sigma), 5 mm ATP (Sigma), and 5 mm dithiothreitol (Sigma) for 90 min at 37 °C. Following that procedure, the G-protein mixture was separated from the pertussis toxin by size exclusion chromatography (Sephadex G-150, Sigma), and the fractions were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis. The fractions containing G-protein were combined and concentrated by ultrafiltration (YM 10.000, Centricon). Lipid Bilayer Formation—A solid-supported lipid membrane was assembled as described previously (5Salamon Z. Cowell S. Varga E. Yamamura H.I. Hruby V.J. Tollin G. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2463-2474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Salamon Z. Macleod H.A. Tollin G. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2791-2797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), using the same principles that govern the spontaneous formation of a freely suspended lipid bilayer membrane across a small orifice in a Teflon sheet that separates two aqueous compartments, the so-called black lipid membrane (11Mueller P. Rudin D.O. Tien H.T. Wescott W.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 979-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Such a bilayer is anchored to the orifice by an annulus of lipid solution (the Gibbs border) that allows lipid molecules to move into and out of the bilayer in response to protein insertion and/or conformation changes. The lipid films were formed on the hydrated silica surface of the PWR resonator from the following membrane-forming solutions: 7 mg/ml egg PC and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (Avanti Polar Lipids) (75:25 or 50:50 mol/mol) in squalene/butanol/methanol (0.05:0.95:0.5, v/v). hDOR Incorporation by Detergent Dilution and G-protein Addition—In order to investigate the influence of ligand binding on G-protein interaction with the hDOR, the following procedure was used (6Alves I. Varga E. Salamon Z. Yamamura H.I. Tollin G. Hruby V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48890-48897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The incorporation of the receptor into the lipid bilayer was accomplished by introducing the detergent-solubilized hDOR (pre-bound with the ligand to be investigated) into the aqueous compartment under conditions that dilute the detergent to below the critical micelle concentration, which allows the membrane protein to incorporate spontaneously into the lipid bilayer. In order to make sure that all receptor molecules had ligand bound before adding the receptor to the PWR cell sample, we have added that same ligand to the sample compartment at a concentration above the KD value for that ligand. In these experiments we only have access to the side of the lipid bilayer facing the aqueous compartment (i.e. no direct access is available to the side of the lipid bilayer facing the silica surface of the prism), and we think that neither the G-protein nor most ligands are able to cross the bilayer. However, because binding to both the G-proteins and ligands can occur after receptor incorporation (and those processes are known to occur in opposite faces of the receptor), it appears that the receptor inserts bi-directionally into the lipid bilayer, i.e. with the extracellular side facing both the silica surface and the aqueous compartment. Because we were interested in studying the ternary complex, i.e. ligand, receptor, G-protein, we have accomplished this, as we have done previously (6Alves I. Varga E. Salamon Z. Yamamura H.I. Tollin G. Hruby V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48890-48897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), by pre-binding the receptor with the ligand before incorporation into the lipid bilayer. In this way, some of the ligand-bound receptors will have their G-protein-binding sites accessible to the external aqueous medium. Small aliquots of the Gα-protein subtypes found in brain tissue, namely Goα, Giα1, Giα2, and Giα3, and the βγ subunit complex (a mixture of the different βγ subtypes present in brain) (Calbiochem) were incrementally added to the equilibrated proteolipid system (1:1 ratio of the α subunit to βγ dimer). After saturation was reached, GTPγS (Sigma) was added, and the PWR spectral changes were monitored. Kinetic experiments were performed by monitoring the PWR spectral changes as a function of time after the various ligands were added to the sample compartment. hDOR and G-protein Incorporation by Liposome Fusion and Ligand Addition—In order to investigate the influence of G-protein binding on ligand interactions with the hDOR, the following procedure was used. Large unilamellar vesicles (liposomes), with the same lipid composition as the bilayer, containing incorporated receptor were prepared by mixing the lipids with the detergent-solubilized and purified hDOR (in a mole ratio of ∼500:1), with or without the presence of the G-proteins (hDOR/G-protein in a 1:1 mole ratio) in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm KCl, followed by 10 freeze/thaw cycles and extrusion using polycarbonate membranes (200-nm pore size). Fusion of liposomes with the bilayer was then induced by the presence of calcium in the same buffer in the PWR sample cell compartment, and the resulting PWR spectral changes were monitored. Thus, by fusing liposomes containing both hDOR and G-proteins to a pre-formed bilayer, it was expected that some of the bound G-protein would be on the side of the bilayer facing the resonator prism surface. Subsequent addition of a ligand to the aqueous compartment would then allow its binding to the receptor that had G-protein bound to it. PWR Spectroscopy—The principles governing PWR spectroscopy have been described extensively in the literature (12Salamon Z. Macleod H.A. Tollin G. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2791-2797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 13Salamon Z. Tollin G. Lindon J.C. Tranter G.E. Holmes J.L. Encyclopedia of Spectroscopy and Spectrometry. 3.

Academic Press, New York1999: 2294-2302Google Scholar). The method is based upon the resonant excitation by polarized light from a continuous wave He-Ne laser (λ = 632.8 nm or λ = 543.5 nm), passing through a glass prism under total internal reflection conditions, of collective electronic oscillations (plasmons) in a thin metal film (silver) deposited on the external surface of the prism, which is overcoated with a dielectric layer (SiO2). The resonant excitation of plasmons generates an evanescent electromagnetic field localized at the outer surface of the dielectric film, which can be used to probe the optical properties of molecules immobilized on this surface (13Salamon Z. Tollin G. Lindon J.C. Tranter G.E. Holmes J.L. Encyclopedia of Spectroscopy and Spectrometry. 3. Academic Press, New York1999: 2311-2319Google Scholar, 14Salamon Z. Tollin G. Lindon J.C. Tranter G.E.

In these experiments, resonance was achieved by varying the angle, α at a fixed λ (543.5 nm excitation was used). Because the resonance coupling generates electromagnetic waves at the expense of incident light energy, the intensity of totally reflected light is diminished at a specific angle. Resonance can be excited with light polarized with the electric vector either parallel (p) or perpendicular (s) to the incident plane, thereby allowing for characterization of the molecular organization of uniaxially oriented anisotropic systems such as biomembranes containing integral proteins (15Salamon Z. Brown M.F. Tollin G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 213-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 16Salamon Z. Huang D. Cramer W.A. Tollin G. Biophys.

J. 2001; 80: 1557-1567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Under the experimental conditions employed in this work, the optical parameters obtained with the p-polarization refer to the perpendicular direction, and those obtained with s-polarization refer to the parallel direction, relative to the bilayer membrane surface. A PWR spectrum is obtained by plotting the reflected light intensity as a function of the incident angle and can be described by three parameters: the angular position, the width, and the depth. The spectrum is determined by the refractive index (n), extinction coefficient at the excitation wavelength (k), and the sample thickness (t). For nonspherical molecules oriented uniaxially on the resonator surface, which is the case with GPCRs, n and k will be different for s- and p-polarization, and this allows characterization of molecular orientation and conformational changes. In these experiments, the molecules deposited on the resonator surface did not absorb at the excitation wavelength, and thus only n and t values influenced the PWR spectra. These parameters are determined by the surface mass density and the mass distribution (orientation and conformation) of the deposited materials. We have used the angular position of the resonance as the primary indicator of the n and t values of the molecules present on the resonator surface, which is directly proportional to the amount of material bound to this surface. Resonance spectra were obtained using a Beta PWR instrument from Proterion Corp. (Piscataway, NJ) that records the relative reflectance versus the absolute angle with a resolution of 1 mdeg. Interaction of G-protein Subtypes with Different Agonist-bound States of the hDOR—Fig. 1, A and B, shows typical results from the PWR spectral measurements carried out in the present experiments, illustrated using the partial agonist morphine. Similar experiments have also been performed by using other ligands (see below). As can be seen, bilayer deposition, agonist-bound receptor incorporation, and addition of a G-protein solution to the aqueous compartment of the PWR cell lead to increases in the position of the resonance angle minimum and changes in the resonance depth for both p- and s-polarized exciting light. Increases in the resonance angle position are related to increases in the refractive index and thickness of the material deposited directly onto the resonator surface. Such resonance shifts are a consequence of increases in mass resulting from the deposition and interactions of molecules of high molecular weight such as the receptor and G-proteins. Changes in the resonance depth of the spectra are also correlated with alterations in the thickness and refractive index of the proteo-lipid film, again as a consequence of material deposition and distribution on the surface. It should be pointed out that the spectral changes observed upon lipid bilayer deposition and receptor incorporation into the bilayer are highly anisotropic (i.e. the changes in p-polarization are quite different from those for s-polarization) due to the highly anisotropic optical properties of oriented lipid bilayers and GPCRs. Previous results obtained upon incorporation of the hDOR into a lipid bilayer (5Salamon Z. Cowell S. Varga E. Yamamura H.I. Hruby V.J. Tollin G. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2463-2474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) have shown by theoretical fits to the PWR spectra (12Salamon Z. Macleod H.A. Tollin G. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2791-2797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) that the thickness of the proteolipid system increased from 5.3 nm in the absence of receptor to 6.8 nm after receptor incorporation (the latter value corresponds to the dimension of the incorporated protein molecule perpendicular to the membrane plane). This value for the thickness of the proteolipid layer after receptor incorporation correlates well with the size determined for rhodopsin from x-ray crystallography (18Palcczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5033) Google Scholar). Spectral shifts obtained upon receptor incorporation were larger for p-polarization than for s-polarization (indicating refractive index changes in the p-direction that were larger than for the s-direction), which is a consequence of the anisotropic structure (i.e. cylindrical shape) of the receptor molecules. This is also evidence for the uniaxial incorporation of the receptor into the bilayer with the expected orientation (i.e. long axis oriented perpendicular to the lipid bilayer), rather than just randomly adsorbed to the bilayer surface, clearly reflecting a corresponding increase of the average long range molecular order in the membrane resulting from receptor-lipid interactions. From this and previous results involving interactions of the hDOR with both ligands (5Salamon Z. Cowell S. Varga E. Yamamura H.I. Hruby V.J. Tollin G. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2463-2474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 7Alves I. Cowell S. Salamon Z. Devanathan S. Tollin G. Hruby V.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1248-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and with G-proteins (6Alves I. Varga E. Salamon Z. Yamamura H.I. Tollin G. Hruby V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48890-48897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we presume that the receptor is incorporated bi-directionally into the lipid bilayer, with either the ligand-binding site or the G-protein-binding site facing the aqueous compartment of the PWR cell sample. We do not, however, know the ratio between these two orientations. It should also be noted that in these experiments, we do not directly determine the concentrations of receptor and G-protein in the PWR cell. Affinities are obtained from the PWR spectral changes that occur because of mass increases in the proteolipid system upon incremental addition of G-protein to the cell. Because PWR is only sensitive to the optical properties of material that is deposited on the resonator surface, there is no interference from the material that is in the bulk solution. Furthermore, in titrations with G-proteins or with other ligands added to the sample cell, the amount of material bound is quite small compared with the amount present in the bulk solution, and it is assumed that the bulk material is able to freely diffuse and equilibrate with the membrane. Thus, because the spectral changes are proportional to the amount of G-protein bound to the receptor, plots of spectral shifts versus bulk G-protein (or ligand) concentration allow a direct determination of dissociation constants. In other words, a hyperbolic saturation curve corresponds to a plot of the total G-protein (or ligand) added to the aqueous compartment versus the amount bound, and fitting the experimental data to such a curve provides a value for KD. Determination of absolute concentrations of receptor or bound ligand are not required. We have reported previously (6Alves I. Varga E. Salamon Z. Yamamura H.I. Tollin G. Hruby V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48890-48897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) that even though the G-protein interacts nonspecifically with the lipid bilayer in the absence of receptor, the PWR shifts obtained in those experiments were less than 10% of those observed for the interaction of the G-protein with a lipid bilayer containing incorporated receptor. In the present study, we have also shown in the control experiments that the ligand-bound hDOR is not able to interact with pertussis toxin-treated (i.e. ADP-ribosylated) G-proteins, inasmuch as no significant PWR shifts were observed upon addition of up to 500 nm of G-protein (data not shown). As can be seen in Fig. 1, A and B, the addition of GTPγS to the cell sample compartment resulted in a decrease in the resonance position minimum for both p- and s-polarized light. We interpret this as a consequence of the disassembly and release of the G-protein that is known to occur upon GTP/GDP exchange, resulting in a decrease in deposited mass. It should be noted that upon addition of a saturating amount of GTPγS, the PWR spectrum did not go back to the resonance position observed before G-protein addition to the proteolipid system, suggesting that not all the G-protein was released from the membrane. Similar results have been observed previously by us (6Alves I. Varga E. Salamon Z. Yamamura H.I. Tollin G. Hruby V.J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2137796933,"Tonic inhibition plays a crucial role in regulating neuronal excitability because it sets the threshold for action potential generation and integrates excitatory signals. Tonic currents are known to be largely mediated by extrasynaptic γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors that are persistently activated by submicromo-lar concentrations of ambient GABA. We recently reported that, in cultured hippocampal neurons, the clustering of synaptic GABAA receptors significantly affects synaptic transmission (Petrini, E. M., Zacchi, P., Barberis, A., Mozrzymas, J. W., and Cherubini, E. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 16271–16279). In this work, we demonstrated that the clustering of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors modulated tonic inhibition. Depolymerization of the cytoskeleton with nocodazole promoted the disassembly of extrasynaptic clusters of δ and γ2 subunit-containing GABAA receptors. This effect was associated with a reduction in the amplitude of tonic currents and diminished shunting inhibition. Moreover, diffuse GABAA receptors were less sensitive to the GAT-1 inhibitor NO-711 and to flurazepam. Quantitative analysis of GABA-evoked currents after prolonged exposure to submicromolar concentrations of GABA and model simulations suggest that clustering affects the gating properties of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. In particular, a larger occupancy of the singly and doubly bound desensitized states can account for the modulation of tonic inhibition recorded after nocodazole treatment. Moreover, comparison of tonic currents recorded during spontaneous activity and those elicited by exogenously applied low agonist concentrations allows estimation of the concentration of ambient GABA. In conclusion, receptor clustering appears to be an additional regulating factor for tonic inhibition. Tonic inhibition plays a crucial role in regulating neuronal excitability because it sets the threshold for action potential generation and integrates excitatory signals.

Depolymerization of the cytoskeleton with nocodazole promoted the disassembly of extrasynaptic clusters of δ and γ2 subunit-containing GABAA receptors. This effect was associated with a reduction in the amplitude of tonic currents and diminished shunting inhibition. Moreover, diffuse GABAA receptors were less sensitive to the GAT-1 inhibitor NO-711 and to flurazepam. Quantitative analysis of GABA-evoked currents after prolonged exposure to submicromolar concentrations of GABA and model simulations suggest that clustering affects the gating properties of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. In particular, a larger occupancy of the singly and doubly bound desensitized states can account for the modulation of tonic inhibition recorded after nocodazole treatment. Moreover, comparison of tonic currents recorded during spontaneous activity and those elicited by exogenously applied low agonist concentrations allows estimation of the concentration of ambient GABA. In conclusion, receptor clustering appears to be an additional regulating factor for tonic inhibition. Similar to many other neurotransmitter receptors, γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) 1The abbreviations used are: GABAA, γ-aminobutyric acid type A; FZP, flurazepam; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; TTX, tetrodotoxin; IPSCs, inhibitory postsynaptic currents; mIPSCs, miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents; sIPSCs, spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents. receptors are localized at synaptic and extrasynaptic levels. Whereas synaptic GABAA receptors are involved in phasic inhibition (1Wall M.J. Usowicz M.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 533-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), extrasynaptic ones are responsible for tonic inhibition (2Staley K.J. Mody I. J.

Tonic inhibition is due to persistent inhibitory conductance that contributes to “signal integration” in the brain since it sets the threshold for action potential generation (10Hausser M.

This conductance is maintained by “ambient” GABA, which represents the amount of neurotransmitter present in the extracellular space. Ambient GABA originates from spillover of the neurotransmitter released at neighboring synapses (3Brickley S.G. Cull-Candy S.G. Farrant M. J. Physiol.

Persistent GABA conductance has also been identified in other brain regions, including the hippocampus (6Bai D. Zhu G. Pennefather P. Jackson M.F. MacDonald J.F. Orser B.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 814-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 8Nusser Z. Mody I. J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 87: 2624-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 9Stell B.M. Mody I. J.

Neuron. 1993; 10: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). However, in this structure, the subunit composition of the receptors involved has not been fully elucidated. In the past years, immunocytochemical and in situ hybridization approaches (20Nusser Z. Sieghart W. Somogyi P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Nusser Z. Roberts J.D.

Brain Res. 2002; 136: 157-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that GABAA receptors are clustered not only at the synaptic level, but also at the extrasynaptic level. However, at present, the influence of the clustering of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors on tonic current is still unclear, although it is well established that clustering of synaptic receptors ensures proper synaptic signaling. In line with a previous study (27Petrini E.M. Zacchi P. Barberis A. Mozrzymas J.W. Cherubini E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16271-16279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we have pharmacologically induced the declusterization of GABAA receptors using nocodazole, a microtubule-disrupting agent, and we have analyzed tonic inhibition in cultured hippocampal neurons. With immunocytochemical experiments, we found clusters of δ subunit-containing GABAA receptors exclusively at extrasynaptic locations, whereas clusters of γ2 subunit-containing receptors were detectable at both synaptic and extrasynaptic sites. Nocodazole treatment induced the disassembly of all the clusters, thus promoting a uniform distribution of δ and γ2 subunit-containing GABAA receptors on the cell surface. This effect was associated with a reduced tonic current. Moreover, diffuse GABAA receptors were less sensitive to the GAT-1 inhibitor NO-711 and to flurazepam (FZP). Model simulations suggest that a larger occupancy of a singly bound desensitized state of declustered receptors may account for the reduction of the tonic current after nocodazole treatment. Cell Culture—Hippocampal cell cultures were prepared as described previously (28Andjus P.R. Stevic-Marinkovic Z. Cherubini E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 504: 103-112Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2–4-day-old Wistar rats were decapitated after being anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of urethane (2 mg/kg). The hippocampus was dissected free, sliced, digested with trypsin, mechanically triturated, centrifuged twice at 40 × g, plated in Petri dishes, and cultured for up to 14 days. Experiments were performed on cells cultured for at least 7 days. Nocodazole Treatment—Nocodazole (purchased from Sigma, Milan, Italy) was used to disrupt microtubules. It was applied at a concentration of 10 μg/ml (29Bueno O.F. Leidenheimer N.J. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) from a 100% Me2SO stock solution. The final concentration of Me2SO in the working solutions was 0.1% (v/v). Nocodazole treatment consisted of incubating the neurons with the drug for at least 2 h in the culture medium. To verify whether Me2SO alone could affect GABAergic transmission, some electrophysiological experiments (n = 12) were also performed on cells incubated for 2 h with Me2SO alone. Me2SO (0.1%, v/v) did not produce any change in the kinetic properties of miniature inhibitory synaptic currents (data not shown). Immunofluorescence Staining and Confocal Microscopy—Immunofluorescence labeling (30Ebert V. Scholze P. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. Neurochem. Int. 1999; 34: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) of surface GABAA receptor subunits δ and γ2 was performed before fixation by incubation of living neurons for 15 min at 4 °C with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the extracellular N-terminal region of the corresponding subunits (i.e. region 1–44 of the δ subunit and region 1–33 of the γ2 subunit) and dilution in the external solution (also used in electrophysiological experiments; 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) with NaOH) supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). After washing with the same medium, hippocampal neurons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% (w/v) sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline, blocked with 10% normal serum, and sequentially incubated with biotinylated goat antirabbit IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled streptavidin. To evaluate the synaptic and extrasynaptic distribution of GABAA receptors, immunocytochemistry for synaptophysin was performed on the same hippocampal neurons. Cells were therefore permeabilized with 0.1% Nonidet P-40, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, blocked with 10% normal serum, and incubated with an anti-synaptophysin monoclonal antibody (Chemicon International, Inc.). The resulting immune complexes were visualized with TRITC-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). All secondary antibodies were from Sigma. These experiments were performed on both untreated and nocodazole-treated neurons. Because it is known that the microtubular network is temperature-sensitive (31Machu T.K. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), some control experiments were performed in parallel to our main immunocytochemical analysis to verify the cytoskeleton integrity after in vivo labeling. Briefly, the same protocol described above was followed with the exception that, after permeabilization, a rat anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody was used instead of synaptophysin. Confocal analysis performed on these neurons demonstrated that the typical branched microtubular bundles were intact after in vivo labeling and comparable with those in similar experiments performed at room temperature (data not shown). Moreover, the same type of control experiments were also performed on nocodazole-treated neurons to verify the expected (27Petrini E.M. Zacchi P. Barberis A. Mozrzymas J.W. Cherubini E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16271-16279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) drug-induced depolymerization of the microtubules (data not shown). Speciments were observed with a ×63 oil immersion objective, followed by ×2 and ×4.5 digital zoom magnification. Images were acquired on a Olympus BX51WI confocal system using sequential dual channel recording of double-labeled cells. Electrophysiological Recordings—Currents were recorded in the whole cell and nucleated patch configurations of the patch-clamp technique using an EPC-7 amplifier (List Medical, Darmstadt, Germany). The stability of the patch was checked by repetitively monitoring the input and series resistance during the experiments. Cells exhibiting >15% changes during the experiment were excluded from the analysis. The series resistance was 5–7 megaohms, and it was compensated by 70–80%. All the experiments were performed at room temperature (22–24 °C). The intrapipette solution contained 137 mm CsCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 m m MgCl2, 11 m m BAPTA, 2 mm ATP, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) with CsOH. The composition of the external solution was 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) with NaOH. During whole cell recordings, the holding potential was –70 mV. The external solution was supplemented with tetrodotoxin (TTX; 1 μm), kynurenic acid (1 mm), and CGP 55845 (1 μm) to block voltage-activated Na+ channels, ionotropic glutamate receptors, and GABA type B receptors, respectively. In some cases, TTX was omitted from the solution to allow action potentials to occur and thus promote a larger release of GABA. Currents were sampled at 50–100 kHz, digitized, low pass-filtered at 3.15 kHz with a Butterworth filter, and stored on the computer hard disk. The acquisition softwares used were Clampex 9 (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA) and WCP, kindly given by Dr. J. Dempster (Strathclyde University, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom). Control and drug-containing solutions were delivered to the recorded neurons with a perfusion system consisting of glass barrels positioned close to the soma of the recorded cell (multibarrel RSC-200 perfusion system, Bio-Logic, Grenoble, France). Judging from the onset of the liquid junction potentials, a complete exchange of the solution around the open tip electrode occurred within 10–20 ms. Because it has been observed previously that the amplitude of tonic GABAergic currents in the hippocampus can be reduced when the cells are perfused with a stream of saline (6Bai D. Zhu G. Pennefather P. Jackson M.F. MacDonald J.F. Orser B.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 814-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 32Valeyev A.Y. Cruciani R.A. Lange G.D. Smallwood V.S. Barker J.L. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 155: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), our experiments were performed at a constant low perfusion rate. However, in the experiments with NO-711, the perfusion was turned off to allow a larger accumulation of GABA. The drug was first injected into the recording chamber through the glass barrels described above. After the recording solution was completely replaced with the NO-711-containing solution (∼4 min), the perfusion system was turned off to prevent ambient GABA from being partially diffused away by the stream of fluids. Picrotoxin and CGP 55845 were purchased from Tocris (Bristol, United Kingdom). Flurazepam was a kind gift of Dr. S. Vicini. All other drugs were purchased from Sigma. In the nucleated patch configuration, the holding voltage was –30 mV. GABA-containing solutions were applied to nucleated patches using an ultrafast perfusion system based on a piezoelectric-driven theta glass application pipette (33Jonas P. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single-channel Recordings. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 231-243Google Scholar). The piezoelectric translator was from Physik Instrumente (Waldbronn, Germany), and the theta glass tubing was from Hilgenberg (Malsfeld, Germany). The open tip recordings of the liquid junction potentials revealed that the 10–90% exchange of the solution occurred within 40–80 μs. The speed of the solution exchange was also estimated around the excised patch by the 10–90% onset of the membrane depolarization induced by application of high potassium saline (25 mm). In this case, the 10–90% rise time value (60–90 μs) was very close to that found for the open tip recordings. Data Analysis—The amplitude of the tonic current was estimated by the outward shift of the base-line current after the application of the GABAA receptor antagonists bicuculline (100 μm) and picrotoxin (100 μm) (1Wall M.J. Usowicz M.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 533-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Four epochs of 500 ms each were pooled together to calculate the base-line current amplitude and its S.D. The resulting all-point histogram was fitted with a gaussian function. Only current recordings that exhibited a stable base line were included in the analysis. During the experiments in the whole cell configuration, spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) were recorded. In particular, depending on the presence or absence of TTX, spontaneous miniature (mIPSCs) or action potential-dependent synaptic (sIPSCs) GABAergic currents were identified. Synaptic currents were analyzed with the AxoGraph 4.9 program (Axon Instruments, Inc.). This program uses a detection algorithm based on a sliding template. The template did not induce any bias in the sampling of events because it was moved along the data trace one point at a time and was optimally scaled to fit the data at each position. The detection criterion was calculated from the template-scaling factor and from how closely the scaled template fit the data. The threshold for detection was set at 3.5 times the S.D. of the base-line noise. Using the same program, the decay time constant of averaged mIPSCs was taken from the biexponential fit of the decay time. The decaying phase of the IPSCs was fitted with exponential functions in the form shown in Equation 1,y(t)=∑i=1nAi⋅exp(−t/τi)(Eq. 1) where τi and Ai are the time constants and relative fractions of the respective components. In the case of analysis of normalized currents, the fractions of kinetic components fulfilled the normalization condition (Equation 2).∑i=1nAi=1(Eq. 2) The deactivation time courses of IPSCs were fitted with the sum of two exponentials (n = 2). The mean time constant, calculated as in Equation 3,τmean=∑i=1nAi⋅τi(Eq. 3) was used to estimate the speed of the decaying process. The goodness of fit was assessed by minimizing the sum of the squared differences. Analysis of variance of the base-line current (σ2) allowed estimation of the single channel current (i) and the single channel conductance (γ) of the receptors mediating tonic currents (I) (6Bai D. Zhu G. Pennefather P. Jackson M.F. MacDonald J.F. Orser B.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 814-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 32Valeyev A.Y. Cruciani R.A. Lange G.D. Smallwood V.S.

Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 2-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Plotting σ2versus I gives rise to a parabolic function (Equation 4),σ2=i(1−Po)I(Eq. 4) where Po is the channel open probability, which varies from 0 to 1. Assuming that, at extremely low concentrations of GABA (0.1–1 μm), the open probability of the channels mediating tonic currents is extremely small, a simplified Equation 4 suggests the following (Equation 5).i=σ2/I(Eq. 5) However, in the presence of GABAA receptor antagonist, there is still a variance in the base-line current (σ2bic, where “bic” is bicuculline). Therefore, Equation 5 must be adjusted for the intrinsic variability of tonic currents (Equation 6).i=(σ2−σ2bic)/I(Eq. 6) The single channel conductance of the receptors mediating tonic currents was estimated with Equation 7,γ=I/(|Vm|−|ECI−|)(Eq. 7) where Vm is the holding potential and ECl– is the reversal potential of Cl– (under our experimental conditions, these values were approximately –70 and 0 mV). Data are expressed as the means ± S.E., and all values included in the statistics represent recordings from separate cells. Statistical comparisons were made with the use of paired and unpaired t tests, the Wilcoxon signed rank test, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (p < 0.05 was taken as significant). Model Simulations—Simulation experiments were performed using the ChanneLab2 software (Synaptosoft). The ChanneLab2 software converted the kinetic model (see Fig. 8A) into a set of differential equations and solved them numerically. Since, in the absence of agonist, receptors can spontaneously open at very low probability (36Birnir B. Everitt A.B. Lim M.S. Gage P.W. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 174: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 37Birnir B. Eghbali M. Cox G.B. Gage P.W. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 181: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 38Bianchi M.T. Macdonald R.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9083-9091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), for simulation convenience, it was assumed as an initial condition, i.e. at t = 0, that no bound or open receptors were present. The solution of such equations yielded the time courses of probabilities of all the states assumed in the model. The fit of the experimental data was performed by optimizing the values of rate constants. The procedure for the rate constant optimization was based on the comparison of the time course of recorded currents and that of simulated responses. δ and γ2 Subunit-containing GABAA Receptors Are Clustered at Extrasynaptic Sites and Become Uniformly Distributed afterNocodazole Treatment—In this work, we analyzed the influence of the clustering of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors on tonic inhibition. Taking advantage of a previous demonstration that GABAA receptor clustering can be impaired by inducing the disassembly of the cytoskeleton with the microtubule-disrupting drug nocodazole (27Petrini E.M. Zacchi P. Barberis A. Mozrzymas J.W. Cherubini E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16271-16279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we first analyzed the distribution pattern and nocodazole sensitivity of δ subunit-containing receptors. In fact, there is much experimental evidence demonstrating that the δ subunit is exclusively expressed at extrasynaptic locations, even though, to our knowledge, its clustering has not yet been addressed. Immunocytochemical experiments were therefore performed to detect the surface distribution of δ subunit-containing receptors in untreated primary cultured hippocampal neurons. Interestingly, we found a clearly dotted staining of δ subunits (Fig. 1A). δ subunits never co-localized with the presynaptic marker synaptophysin (Fig. 1, B and C), thus suggesting a clustered arrangement of δ subunit-containing GABAA receptors at extrasynaptic sites. This punctate staining was significantly affected by nocodazole treatment. In fact, in nocodazole-treated neurons, δ subunits were almost uniformly distributed along the cell surface, although some residual puncta were still detectable (Fig. 1D, lower panel). The double staining of δ subunit/synaptophysin in nocodazole-treated neurons never showed a co-localization of the two proteins, suggesting that also declustered δ-containing receptors maintained their extrasynaptic localization (Fig. 1F, lower panel). Clusters of γ2 subunit-containing GABAA receptors have been recently identified at extrasynaptic sites (26Christie S.B. Li R.W. Miralles C.P. Riquelme R. Yang B.Y. Charych E. Wendou Y. Daniels S.B. Cantino M.E. De Blas A.L. Prog. Brain Res. 2002; 136: 157-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 39Danglot L. Triller A. Bessis A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 264-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), although their functional role has been poorly investigated. An antibody specific for the extracellular N-terminal domain of the γ2 subunit was used to decorate γ2 subunit-containing GABAA receptors on the cell surface. In untreated neurons, γ2 subunits displayed a punctate staining pattern over the neuronal somata and dendrites (Fig. 2A). Only some of the puncta were co-localized with synaptophysin, thus indicating that γ2 subunits were present at both synaptic sites (Fig. 2C, lower panel, arrowheads) and extrasynaptic sites (arrows). As expected from our previous work (27Petrini E.M. Zacchi P. Barberis A. Mozrzymas J.W. Cherubini E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16271-16279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), nocodazole treatment was associated with the declusterization of γ2 subunit-containing GABAA receptors. Most interestingly, we found that, under these conditions, co-localization between declustered γ2 subunits and synaptophysin was still detectable, thus indicating that nocodazole treatment affected both synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors (Fig. 2F, lower panel, crossed arrows). Tonic Current Amplitudes in Untreated and Nocodazole-treated Neurons—Currents were recorded from cultured hippocampal neurons in the whole cell configuration of the patchclamp technique at a holding potential of –70 mV in the presence of kynurenic acid (1 mm) and CGP 55845 (1 mm). Under these conditions, it was possible to record both sIPSCs and a persistent tonic current that was identified upon the application of GABAA receptor antagonists (see “Experimental Procedures”). The application of bicuculline (100 μm) produced the complete disappearance of sIPSCs and an outward shift of the base-line current (Fig. 3A). In an attempt to test whether nocodazole treatment could affect the amplitude of the tonic current, the shift of the baseline current after the application of bicuculline (100 μm) was measured in untreated and nocodazole-treated neurons. Under these two conditions, tonic currents were not significantly different. In untreated neurons, the base-line shift was 14.7 ± 5.3 pA, whereas in nocodazole-treated neurons, it was 12.7 ± 2.3 pA (n = 6; p > 0.05) (Fig. 3, A and E). The all-point histograms of the base-line currents in untreated and nocodazole-treated neurons exhibit overlapping distributions (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained upon the application of picrotoxin (100 μm). The base-line shifts were 15.4 ± 5.7 and 11.9 ± 3.5 pA in untreated and nocodazole-treated neurons, respectively (n = 4; p > 0.05) (data not shown). The similarity of the tonic current amplitudes in untreated and nocodazole-treated neurons suggests that the depolymerization of microtubules and the associated declusterization of GABAA receptors did not reduce the number of the receptors expressed on the cell surface. This hypothesis is further supported by our previous demonstration that also the ampl"

It has been previously demonstrated that repeated membrane disruptions reseal more quickly than the initial wound and that this facilitated response requires the transcription factor cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB). This study examines the signaling pathway between membrane disruption and CREB-dependent gene expression in 3T3 fibroblasts. A reporter gene assay using pCRE-d2EGFP revealed that membrane disruption induced CRE-mediated transcription. Immunofluorescence observations suggested that membrane disruption activated CREB, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), and MAPK kinase3/6, the kinase responsible for activation of p38 MAPK. CREB phosphorylation upon membrane disruption was inhibited by a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580. Both CRE-mediated transcription and long-term potentiation of membrane resealing and wound-induced exocytosis were suppressed when cells were wounded in the presence of either SB203580 or Gö-6976, a specific protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor. Furthermore, activation of MAPK kinase3/6 was impaired by PKC inhibition during membrane disruption. These results suggest that PKC mediates the stimulation of CREB-dependent gene expression through a p38 MAPK pathway upon membrane disruption. Ca2+-regulated exocytosis is required for rapid resealing of disrupted plasma membranes. It has been previously demonstrated that repeated membrane disruptions reseal more quickly than the initial wound and that this facilitated response requires the transcription factor cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB). This study examines the signaling pathway between membrane disruption and CREB-dependent gene expression in 3T3 fibroblasts. A reporter gene assay using pCRE-d2EGFP revealed that membrane disruption induced CRE-mediated transcription. Immunofluorescence observations suggested that membrane disruption activated CREB, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), and MAPK kinase3/6, the kinase responsible for activation of p38 MAPK. CREB phosphorylation upon membrane disruption was inhibited by a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580. Both CRE-mediated transcription and long-term potentiation of membrane resealing and wound-induced exocytosis were suppressed when cells were wounded in the presence of either SB203580 or Gö-6976, a specific protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor. Furthermore, activation of MAPK kinase3/6 was impaired by PKC inhibition during membrane disruption. These results suggest that PKC mediates the stimulation of CREB-dependent gene expression through a p38 MAPK pathway upon membrane disruption. Mechanical stress induces disruptions of plasma membranes in many animal tissues under physiological conditions, and a cell survives these disruptions by rapidly resealing its cell membrane (1McNeil P.L. Steinhardt R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 697-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Small disruptions on the order of micron-diameter evoke the Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of vesicles near the wound site, which is essential for successful membrane resealing (2Steinhardt R.A. Bi G.-Q.

It has been proposed that wound-induced exocytosis promotes resealing by decreasing membrane tension (10Togo T. Krasieva T.B. Steinhardt R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4339-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Expression of genes having a cAMP-response element (CRE) can be activated through a variety of signaling cascades that include protein kinase A (PKA), CaMK, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. These pathways are reported to be involved in complex and diverse processes such as learning, memory, synaptic plasticity, development, and stress responses (11Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar, 12Lonze B.E. Ginty D.D.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11024-11031Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Induction of these signaling pathways activates the transcription factor cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) by specifically phosphorylating amino acid Ser-133. Wound-induced exocytosis is potentiated following an initial wound so that subsequent cell membrane disruptions reseal more quickly (6Togo T. Alderton J.M. Bi G.-Q. Steinhardt R.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 719-731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Togo T. Alderton J.M. Steinhardt R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 93-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been indicated that the potentiation of membrane resealing and wound-induced exocytosis last at least 24 h after the initial wound and require CREB because a dominant-negative CREB mutant inhibited these processes (15Togo T. Alderton J.M. Steinhardt R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 93-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that inhibition of PKA during the initial wound does not affect long-term potentiation of membrane resealing (15Togo T. Alderton J.M. Steinhardt R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 93-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that other, PKA-independent pathways are used to activate CREB upon membrane disruption. The aim of the present study was to define which signaling pathways are involved in CREB activation and, therefore, CRE-mediated transcription after membrane disruption. To address this issue, a vector, pCRE-d2EGFP, containing a reporter gene encoding a destabilized variant of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (d2EGFP) under the control of a cAMP-response element promoter was transfected into 3T3 fibroblasts, and the changes of fluorescent intensity of d2EGFP upon membrane disruption were analyzed. Immunofluorescent analysis was also used to evaluate the phosphorylation state of CREB, p38 MAPK, and MAPK kinases (MEKs) upon membrane disruption. Membrane disruption was found to induce CREB phosphorylation and CRE-mediated transcription via a PKC- and p38 MAPK-dependent pathway. This signaling pathway was required for long-term potentiation of membrane resealing and wound-induced exocytosis. Cell Culture—Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% calf serum (Invitrogen) and 100 units/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Transfection—Vectors pCRE-d2EGFP and pPUR were purchased from BD Biosciences Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). These vectors were co-transfected into 3T3 cells using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After the transfected cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum without antibiotics for 48 h, the selective antibiotic puromycin (BD Biosciences Clontech) was added at 5 μg/ml. Culture medium containing puromycin was changed every third day. After 2 weeks, transfected clones were isolated and maintained with 5 μg/ml puromycin. Scratch Wound Protocol—pCRE-d2EGFP-transfected 3T3 cells were plated on coverslips and grown for 2–3 days before use. During wound experiments, the cells were maintained in 1.8 mm Ca2+ Ringer's solution. Ca2+-free Ringer's solution contained 138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.06 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm d-glucose, and 12.4 mm HEPES (pH 7.25). A stock solution of 100 mm CaCl2 was used to adjust the concentration of Ca2+. Tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-dextran, 10,000 MW (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was dissolved at a concentration of 1.0 mg/ml in 1.8 mm Ca2+ Ringer's solution. The 3T3 cells were rinsed with 1.8 mm Ca2+ Ringer's solution at 37 °C before adding the above rhodamine solution at 37 °C along with various protein kinase inhibitors. Then the cells were wounded by slowly scratching the coverslips multiple times with a sterile 27-gauge needle (16Swanson J.A. McNeil P.L. Science. 1987; 238: 548-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The cells were allowed to stand for 5 min and then were returned to normal culture conditions. Fluorescent images of d2EGFP were taken on a Leica DMR fluorescence microscope equipped with a SPOT RT camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). Exposure time and gain level of the camera remained constant during experiments. Immunofluorescent Staining—Anti-phospho-CREB antibody was purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Antibodies against phospho-p38 (D-8) and phospho-MEK3/6 (B-9) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser-217/221), phospho-SEK1/MKK4 (Ser-257/Thr-261), and phospho-MKK7 (Ser-271/Thr-275) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Non-transfected 3T3 cells were plated on the coverslips and were grown for 2–3 days before use. They were wounded by scratching in the presence of 1.0 mg/ml fluoro-emerald (fixable fluorescein-dextran, 10,000 MW; Molecular Probes) instead of TMR-dextran as described above and were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. The cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min and immunostained with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. TMR-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) was used for detection. Immunostaining was photographed using the Leica DMR fluorescence microscope and SPOT RT camera described above. Image Analysis—The fluorescent intensities of d2EGFP and immunostaining in digitized images were evaluated by ImageJ 1.30, public domain image processing software from the National Institutes of Health. A 25 × 25 pixel box was positioned over the fluorescent image of each cell, and the average intensity within the selection (the sum of the intensities of all the pixels in the selection divided by the number of pixels) was measured. Statistics were calculated by Student's t test using InStat 2 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Assay of Exocytosis by FM1–43 Destaining—Non-transfected 3T3 cells were plated on glass-inserted plastic dishes (Asahi Techno Glass, Tokyo, Japan) and were grown for 2–3 days before use. These cells were both wounded and marked by scratching in the presence of 1.0 mg/ml fura-dextran, 10,000 MW (Molecular Probes) in 1.8 mm Ca2+ Ringer's solution and were incubated with fresh culture medium containing 4 μm FM1–43 (Molecular Probes) overnight. FM1–43-loaded cells were then wounded again 24 h after the initial wound with a glass needle using an Eppendorf Injectman 5179 and Transjector 5246 mounted on an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope at room temperature (28 °C). Fluorescence changes were analyzed as described previously (9Togo T. Steinhardt R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 688-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) using MetaFluor 6.1 software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). Membrane Resealing Assay—Non-transfected 3T3 cells, plated on glass-inserted plastic dishes, were wounded and marked by scratching in the presence of 1.0 mg/ml fluorescein-dextran, 10,000 MW in 1.8 mm Ca2+ Ringer's solution. These cells were loaded with fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) 24 h after the wound. fura-2-loaded cells were then wounded with a glass needle, and membrane resealing was monitored as described previously (9Togo T. Steinhardt R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 688-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cell Membrane Disruption Induces CRE-mediated Transcription in 3T3 Fibroblasts—In a previous study, it was demonstrated that repeated cell membrane disruptions reseal more quickly than the initial wound and that this long-term potentiation of membrane resealing requires a transcription factor, CREB (15Togo T. Alderton J.M. Steinhardt R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 93-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study investigates the time course of CRE-mediated transcription in wounded cells using a reporter gene, pCRE-d2EGFP. As d2EGFP has a half-life of about 2 h, it reports transient activation of CRE-mediated transcription. pCRE-d2EGFP-transfected cells were wounded by scratching in the presence of the marker dye TMR-dextran in 1.8 mm Ca2+ Ringer's solution. They were observed live under a fluorescent microscope at various intervals after wounding. Up-regulation of d2EGFP expression was localized to cells containing TMR-dextran, and green fluorescence protein was observed uniformly distributed in wounded cells (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1B summarizes the results of a kinetic study of CRE-mediated transcription after membrane disruption. The fluorescent intensity of d2EGFP increased to 69.1 ± 5.6 (n = 7) from 25.0 ± 1.2 (n = 17) 1 h after membrane disruption. The intensity remained high for 12 h after membrane disruption and started to decrease after that. At 48 h after membrane disruption, the level of fluorescent signal from d2EGFP decreased to close to initial levels (32.6 ± 5.6, n = 4). The fluorescent intensity of d2EGFP in non-wounded cells plated on another coverslip did not show any significant changes throughout the experimental period (Fig. 1B), indicating that the increase in d2EGFP intensity observed in this study was induced by membrane disruption. The p38 MAPK Inhibitor SB203580 Suppresses CRE-mediated Transcription upon Membrane Disruption—CRE-mediated transcription can be activated through a variety of signaling pathways including PKA, CaMK, and MAPK (11Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar, 12Lonze B.E. Ginty D.D. Neuron. 2002; 35: 605-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar, 13Cowan K.J. Storey K.B. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 1107-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 14West A.E. Chen W.G. Dalva M.B. Dolmetsch R.E. Kornhauser J.M. Shaywitz A.J. Takasu M.A. Tao X. Greenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11024-11031Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). To identify the signaling pathways for CRE-mediated transcription after the disruption of plasma membrane, pCRE-d2EGFP-transfected 3T3 cells were wounded in the presence of either a PKA or p38 MAPK inhibitor together with TMR-dextran. Up-regulation of d2EGFP expression in wounded and TMR-dextran-containing cells was observed 3.5 h after membrane disruption (Fig. 2, A and B). When non-treated cells were wounded as a control, the fluorescent intensity of d2EGFP was 62.0 ± 4.9 (n = 11) in wounded cells and 27.0 ± 1.7 (n = 8) in non-wounded cells (p <0.0001, Student's t test). When cells were wounded in the presence of a PKA inhibitor, KT5720 (10 μm), the fluorescent intensity of d2EGFP was 55.7 ± 6.9 (n = 8) and was significantly higher than that of non-wounded cells (p = 0.0012, Student's t test). This is in agreement with a previous report (15Togo T. Alderton J.M. Steinhardt R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 93-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that showed that PKA was not involved in long-term potentiation of membrane resealing. In contrast, cells wounded in the presence of SB203580 (10 μm), a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK that blocks its ATP binding site (17Young P.R. McLaughlin M.M. Kumar S. Kassis S. Doyle M.L. McNulty D. Gallagher T.F. Fisher S. McDonnell P.C. Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. Seibel G. Porter T.G. Livi G.P. Adams J.L. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12116-12121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), showed only a slight increase in the intensity of d2EGFP to 35.3 ± 3.4 (n = 10), which is not significantly different from non-wounded cells (p = 0.0619, Student's t test). When cells were wounded in the presence of SB202474 (10 μm), an analogue of SB203580 that does not inhibit p38 MAPK activity, there was a significant increase in d2EGFP fluorescent intensity after membrane disruption. The fluorescent intensity of d2EGFP increased to 54.8 ± 3.4 (n = 10) (p < 0.0001, Student's t test). The effects of CaMK inhibitors could not be investigated in this study, as membrane resealing itself is dependent on CaMK activity (2Steinhardt R.A. Bi G.-Q. Alderton J.M. Science. 1994; 263: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). These results suggest that p38 MAPK is required for the activation of CRE-mediated transcription after membrane disruption. Stimulation of CRE-mediated transcription requires phosphorylation of CREB at Ser-133. To observe CREB phosphorylation in wounded cells, non-transfected cells were wounded by scratching in the presence of the marker dye fluoro-emerald (fixable fluorescein-dextran) in 1.8 mm Ca2+ Ringer's solution, fixed 1 h later, and then immunostained with anti-phospho-CREB antibody, which recognizes the amino acid sequences surrounding phosphorylated Ser-133 of CREB. Cell nuclei were immunopositive for anti-phospho-CREB antibody in wounded cells (Fig. 2C, arrow), whereas cell nuclei of non-wounded cells were not immunopositive (Fig. 2C, arrowheads). On the other hand, nuclear staining of anti-phospho-CREB antibody was absent when cells were wounded in the presence of 10 μm SB203580 (Fig. 2C, asterisk). As shown in Fig. 2D, membrane disruption resulted in a 2.4-fold increase in immunostaining intensity of phospho-CREB in the nuclear region in control experiments (p < 0.0001, Student's t test). On the other hand, when cells were wounded in the presence of 10 μm SB203580, the observed increase in immunostaining intensity was not significant (p = 0.2204, Student's t test). These results imply that CREB activation is achieved by the p38 MAPK pathway upon membrane disruption. Membrane Disruption Activates p38 MAPK Pathway in a PKC-dependent Manner—To observe the active form of p38 MAPK in wounded cells, non-transfected cells were wounded by scratching in the presence of fluoro-emerald in 1.8 mm Ca2+ Ringer's solution, fixed 30 min later, and immunostained with anti-phospho-p38 antibody (Fig. 3A). Cell nuclei were immunopositive for anti-phospho-p38 antibody in wounded cells (Fig. 3A, arrows). In control experiments, intensities of immunostaining were 24.6 ± 2.0 (n = 7) and 13.6 ± 2.0 (n = 10) in wounded and non-wounded cells, respectively (p = 0.0016, Student's t test) (Fig. 3B). When cells were wounded in the presence of the p38 MAPK catalytic site inhibitor SB203580 (10 μm), the immunostaining intensity was also significantly different between wounded and non-wounded cells (p < 0.0001, Student's t test). Intensities of immunostaining were 21.9 ± 1.9 (n = 13) and 13.2 ± 0.9 (n = 22) in wounded and non-wounded cells, respectively. These results suggest that phosphorylation of p38 MAPK is induced by membrane disruption and that p38 is not autophosphorylated (18Ge B. Gram H. Di Padova F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. Science. 2002; 295: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) but transphosphorylated by the up-stream kinases MEK3, MEK4, or MEK6 (19Nebreda A.R. Porras A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 257-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). To observe the activation of MEKs, non-transfected cells were wounded by scratching in the presence of fluoro-emerald in 1.8 mm Ca2+ Ringer's solution, fixed 30 min later, and immunostained with antibodies against phospho-MEK3/6, phospho-MEK4, phospho-MEK1/2, or phospho-MEK7. Phosphorylated MEK3/6 was mainly detected in the nuclear region in wounded cells (Fig. 4A, arrow), whereas it was absent in the nuclear region in non-wounded cells. Membrane disruption resulted in a significant increase in immunostaining intensity of phospho-MEK3/6 from 20.3 ± 0.6 (n = 75) to 32.9 ± 1.6 (n = 29) (p < 0.0001, Student's t test) (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, nuclear localization of phospho-MEK3/6 was inhibited when cells were wounded in the presence of a specific PKC inhibitor, Gö-6976 (20Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marmé D. Schächtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When cells were wounded in the presence of Gö-6976 (1 μm), the immunostaining intensity was increased only slightly to 21.9 ± 1.2 (n = 19) (p = 0.2008, Student's t test) (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, PKC stimulation by phorbol ester, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), induces phosphorylation of MEK3/6 (Fig. 4, A and B). There was no immunostaining with anti-phospho-MEK4 antibody upon membrane disruption, whereas cells stimulated with 0.5 m sorbitol showed phospho-MEK4 staining mainly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4C). Nuclear staining of phospho-MEK1/2 and phospho-MEK7 were induced by stimulation with PMA (100 nm); however, membrane disruption did not show any detectable nuclear staining (Fig. 4, D and E). These results suggest that membrane disruption preferentially activates MEK3/6 and that PKC regulates the activation of the p38 MAPK, most likely through MEK3 and -6, upon membrane disruption. PKC Is Involved in CRE-mediated Transcription and Long-term Potentiation of Wound-induced Exocytosis and Membrane Resealing—The effect of PKC inhibition on CRE-mediated transcription is shown in Fig. 5. Cells transfected with pCRE-d2EGFP were wounded in the absence or presence of a specific PKC inhibitor, Gö-6976 (1 μm), and up-regulation of d2EGFP expression was observed 3.5 h after membrane disruption. When non-treated cells were wounded as a control, the fluorescent intensity of d2EGFP was increased to 57.8 ± 3.7 (n = 40) from 24.8 ± 1.0 (n = 29). When cells were wounded in the presence of Gö-6976 (1 μm), the increase in the intensity of d2EGFP was suppressed to 33.1 ± 3.3 (n = 24). These results indicate that CRE-mediated transcription is activated by PKC upon membrane disruption. To investigate the effect of PKC inhibition on long-term potentiation of wound-induced exocytosis, cells were initially wounded and marked with fura-dextran. The cells were then loaded with 4 μm FM1–43 overnight. FM1–43 intercalates into the outer leaflet of lipid bilayers and is much more fluorescent in hydrophobic than in hydrophilic environments (21Cochilla A.J. Angleson J.K. Betz W.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). When cells are incubated with the dye and later washed, dye remaining in the plasma membrane rapidly diffuses away, leaving only dye that is trapped in the endocytosed membrane. Subsequent delivery of the FM1–43 into the plasma membrane by exocytosis allows diffusion of the dye into the external medium and results in a loss of cellular fluorescence near the wound site. As shown in Fig. 6A, a previous wound increased the amount of exocytosis at a second wound when measured 24 h later. The amount of local FM1–43 destaining at the second wound at 24 h increased to 9.7 ± 1.2% (n = 7) from 5.1 ± 0.78% (n = 9) for initial wounds. When cells were initially wounded in the presence of PKC inhibitor Gö-6976 (1 μm) or p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (10 μm), the amounts for a second wound were suppressed to 4.4 ± 0.85% (n = 7) or 4.1 ± 0.73% (n = 7), respectively. To investigate whether PKC inhibition suppresses long-term potentiation of membrane resealing at the second wound, cells were initially wounded and marked with the dye fluorescein-dextran. Then membrane resealing was monitored 24 h after the initial wound as described previously (9Togo T. Steinhardt R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 688-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, a membrane disruption (Fig. 6B, arrow) was indicated by a rise in the emission ratio of fura-2 excited at 380 and 360 nm, and the loss of the dye resulted in a decrease in the fluorescent intensity excited at 360 nm. When the cell membrane resealed, the decrease in fluorescent intensity stopped (Fig. 6B, bar). To compare the timing of membrane resealing in each condition, the resealing rate was defined as the inverse of the resealing time in seconds. For cells that failed to reseal, the rate was defined as zero. The resealing rate for a second wound increased to 0.1 ± 0.02 (n = 11) in control experiments (Fig. 6C) as reported previously (15Togo T. Alderton J.M. Steinhardt R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 93-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When cells were initially wounded in the presence of Gö-6976 (1 μm) or SB203580 (10 μm), the rates for a second wound were suppressed to 0.035 ± 0.004 (n = 12) or 0.036 ± 0.004 (n = 13), respectively. In the separate dishes, when unlabeled cells were initially wounded, the resealing rate was 0.042 ± 0.004 (n = 10). These results indicate that both p38 MAPK and PKC are indeed involved in long-term potentiation of wound-induced exocytosis and membrane resealing. Disruption of plasma membrane is a common form of cell injury in many animal tissues. Cells survive this disruption by delivering vesicles to the damaged plasma membrane through exocytosis, a ubiquitous Ca2+-triggered response to membrane disruption (1McNeil P.L. Steinhardt R.A. Annu.

It has been previously demonstrated that repeated membrane disruption reveals long-term potentiation of Ca2+-regulated exocytosis in 3T3 fibroblasts, which is closely correlated with faster membrane resealing rates at repeated wounds (15Togo T. Alderton J.M. Steinhardt R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 93-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This potentiation of exocytosis and membrane resealing is PKA-dependent in the early stages (minutes), in the intermediate-term (hours) requires protein synthesis, and for the long-term (24 h) depends on gene expression that is mediated by the transcription factor CREB. CREB activation is mediated by a variety of signaling cascades (11Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar, 12Lonze B.E.

A. 2001; 98: 11024-11031Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), and cell membrane disruption has been known to activate at least three protein kinases, CaMK, PKC, and PKA (2Steinhardt R.A. Bi G.-Q. Alderton J.M. Science. 1994; 263: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 6Togo T. Alderton J.M. Bi G.-Q. Steinhardt R.A. J.

Soughayer J.S. Allbritton N.L. Nature Biotech. 2000; 18: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 7). It has been demonstrated that CaMK is involved in wound-induced exocytosis and therefore in the membrane resealing itself (2Steinhardt R.A. Bi G.-Q. Alderton J.M. Science. 1994; 263: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Both PKC and PKA are involved in short-term potentiation of membrane resealing and wound-induced exocytosis (6Togo T. Alderton J.M. Bi G.-Q. Steinhardt R.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 719-731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Togo T. Alderton J.M. Steinhardt R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 93-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that inhibition of PKA during the initial wound does not affect long-term potentiation of membrane resealing, suggesting that other, PKA-independent pathways are used to activate CREB upon membrane disruption (15Togo T. Alderton J.M. Steinhardt R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 93-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study has identified the signaling pathway that converts the information of cell membrane disruption into CREB-dependent gene expression, i.e. PKC mediates CREB activation via a p38 MAPK pathway (Fig. 7). Nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated MEK3/6 (the kinases responsible for p38 MAPK activation) was observed in wounded cells. Inhibition of PKC function impaired the activation of MEK3/6 upon membrane disruption, and stimulation of PKC by PMA induces the phosphorylation of MEK3/6. In contrast, other MEKs, MEK1/2, MEK4, and MEK7, were not phosphorylated upon membrane disruption. These results suggest that PKC isozymes can indeed mediate wound-induced stimulation of MEK3/6-p38 MAPK pathway. It has also been demonstrated that PKC activates p38 MAPK in other systems (23Tanaka Y. Gavrielides M.V. Mitsuuchi Y. Fujii T. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33753-33762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), although the mechanisms by which PKC isozymes activate p38 MAPK have not yet been established. p38 MAPK has been reported to participate in the cellular responses to stress as well as in the control of survival of many cell types as both a positive and negative regulator (13Cowan K.J. Storey K.B. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 1107-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 19Nebreda A.R. Porras A. Trends Biochem.

The present study clearly indicates that p38 MAPK potentiates membrane resealing for long term. The phosphorylation of CREB at Ser-133 is not catalyzed directly by a MAPK family member, but other protein kinases that are activated by MAPK are involved in CREB phosphorylation (13Cowan K.J. Storey K.B. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 1107-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Although the downstream signaling of the p38 MAPK pathway leading to CREB phosphorylation upon membrane disruption remains to be demonstrated, it has been reported that mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinases MSK1 and MSK2 and MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 are activated by MAPK and then phosphorylate CREB in other systems (26Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 27Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R.

Biol. 2002; 22: 2871-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Previously it has been reported that CREB-dependent long-term potentiation of membrane resealing appears 6 h after membrane disruption and that the intermediate-term (3 h) potentiation of membrane resealing and wound-induced exocytosis is not dependent on CREB (15Togo T. Alderton J.M. Steinhardt R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 93-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the present study shows that CRE-mediated transcription is already active 1 h after membrane disruption. One explanation for this discrepancy is that CRE-mediated gene products might be involved indirectly in long-term (6–24 h) potentiation of membrane resealing and wound-induced exocytosis. The mitogen- and stress-induced phosphorylation of CREB family members has been linked to transcription of several immediate early genes, such as c-fos, junB, and egr1 (28Wiggin G.R. Soloaga A. Foster J.M. Murray-Tait V. Cohen P. Arthur J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2871-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been demonstrated that membrane disruption induces c-fos expression (29Grembowicz K.P. Sprague D. McNeil P.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1247-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has also been suggested that membrane disruption induces translocation of another transcription factor, NF-κB, into the nucleus (29Grembowicz K.P. Sprague D. McNeil P.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1247-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These events may increase the expression of numerous additional genes to potentiate wound-induced exocytosis at repeated wounds long term, although the details of the end products remain to be elucidated.

MMP-2 has been shown to play a critical role in invasion/metastasis and angiogenesis of malignant tumors (1Emmert-Buck M.R. Roth M.J. Zhuang Z. Campo E. Rozhin J. Sloane B.F. Liotta L.A.

MMP-2 is constitutively expressed by normal and transformed cells, and enhanced expression of MMP-2 is found in a variety of tumor cells that correlates with the malignancy grade of the original tumor (1Emmert-Buck M.R. Roth M.J. Zhuang Z. Campo E. Rozhin J. Sloane B.F. Liotta L.A. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 1285-1290PubMed Google Scholar, 2Brooks P.C. Stromblad S.

We have previously shown that the transcription factors Sp1, Sp3, and AP-2 are functionally important in regulating constitutive expression of the MMP-2 gene (3Qin H. Sun Y. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29130-29137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). However, how the MMP-2 gene is constitutively transcribed in the generally repressive chromatin context under the regulation of Sp1, Sp3, and AP-2 is unknown. The Sp family of transcription factors, including Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4, play a major role in regulating a large number of eukaryotic genes, which in turn, have indispensable effects in controlling development, differentiation, tumorigenesis, and viral infection (4Philipsen S. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2991-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 5Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Sp1 and Sp3 are ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotic cells, and both can recognize and bind GC boxes present in the promoters of a variety of constitutive or inducible genes (4Philipsen S. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2991-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 5Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Although Sp1 and Sp3 share a high degree of homology in structure, they have distinct functions in transcriptional regulation. Sp1 is generally a transcriptional activator, whereas Sp3 is considered as a relatively weak activator or a transcriptional repressor depending on the context of the gene and the assay system (5Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar, 6Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G.

Chem. 2002; 277: 9780-9789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, the ratio of Sp1/Sp3 that binds on the GC box of a specific gene is also dynamically changed in response to regulatory signals (9Apt D. Watts R.M. Suske G. Bernard H.U. Virology. 1996; 224: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 10Chadjichristos C. Ghayor C. Kypriotou M. Martin G. Renard E. Ala-Kokko L. Suske G. De Crombrugghe B. Pujol J.P. Galera P. J.

Therefore, differential binding between Sp1 and Sp3 to a target gene is another regulatory mechanism to refine the transcriptional output. However, the mechanisms that control the ratio of Sp1/Sp3 or switching of Sp1/Sp3 are unknown. The genomic DNA of eukaryotic cells is packaged into chromatin, which is composed of the basic structural unit of nucleosomes. Nucleosomes are formed by histone octamers wrapping around ∼147 bp of DNA in eukaryotes. Chromatin is generally a repressive structure for gene transcription; therefore, a central issue of eukaryotic gene transcription is to elucidate how transcription is regulated in the context of chromatin (12Wolffe A.P. Essays Biochem. 2001; 37: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 14Vignali M.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2339-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Two mechanisms contribute to the relaxation of chromatin structure to accommodate the binding of transcription complexes. One is by chemical modifications, such as acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation, of the histone tails of nucleosomes (16Berger S.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). The other is by disruption of histone-DNA contact by ATP hydrolysis-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes. Several ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes have been described, including the SWI/SNF complex. SWI/SNF is a protein complex of ∼2 MDa containing 10–15 subunits that is conserved among eukaryotes (17Iba H. Mizutani T. Ito T. Rev. Med. Virol. 2003; 13: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Two of the ATPase subunits of SWI/SNF, Brg-1 and Brm, have critical functions in SWI/SNF-mediated chromatin remodeling (14Vignali M. Hassan A.H. Neely K.E. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1899-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 15Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2339-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Homozygous inactivation of Brg-1 causes early embryonic lethality in mice (18Bultman S. Gebuhr T. Yee D. La Mantia C. Nicholson J. Gilliam A. Randazzo F. Metzger D. Chambon P. Crabtree G. Magnuson T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1287-1295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar), whereas deletion of Brm results in increased body weight in mice (19Reyes J.C. Barra J. Muchardt C. Camus A. Babinet C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6979-6991Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). It has been reported that a variety of human malignancies are associated with mutations of Brg-1, thus suggesting that Brg-1 may contribute to tumor suppression (20Klochendler-Yeivin A. Muchardt C. Yaniv M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Indeed, Brg-1 represses c-fos gene transcription, and Brg-1 also interacts with the corepressor complex Sin3A or the tumor suppressor RB to induce cell cycle arrest (21Murphy D.J. Hardy S. Engel D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2724-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 22Dunaief J.L. Strober B.E. Guha S. Khavari P.A. Alin K. Luban J. Begemann M. Crabtree G.R. Goff S.P.

Reconstitution of Brg-1 into cells that are Brg-1-deficient can reverse the transformed phenotype of tumor cells (25Wong A.K. Shanahan F. Chen Y. Lian L. Ha P. Hendricks K. Ghaffari S. Iliev D.

Because Brg-1 does not contain a sequence-specific DNA-binding domain, the selective recruitment of the SWI/SNF complex to target genes depends on protein-protein interactions through Brg-1 and other transcription factors or transcription regulators (26Kadam S.

Herein, we demonstrate that Brg-1, the ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, is responsible for regulating the constitutive expression of the MMP-2 gene by recruitment of Sp1, AP-2, and pol II to the MMP-2 promoter. In addition, the binding of Sp3 to the MMP-2 promoter is diminished in the presence of Brg-1. Therefore, Brg-1 can regulate gene transcription by modifying the DNA-binding capacity of Sp1 and Sp3. Cell Lines and Reagents—HeLa and SW-13 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) was purchased from Worthington Biochemicals (Lakewood, NJ). Antibodies against Sp1, Sp3, AP-2, pol II, Brg-1, and normal rabbit IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibody against actin was purchased from Sigma. Antibody against human MMP-2 was a generous gift from Dr. J. Engler (University of Alabama at Birmingham, AL). Plasmid DNAs—pREP was derived from pREP7 (Invitrogen). The fragment containing the RSV promoter and hygromycin coding sequence of pREP7 was released by SalI/BstBI digestion, then psREP7 was generated by ligation of the blunt-ended pREP7 backbone. The promoterless luciferase reporter gene from pGL3-basic was inserted into the ClaI site of psREP7, which generated pREP-luc. The episomal construct of the human MMP-2 gene was constructed by inserting the 1.7-kb fragment of the human MMP-2 promoter into pREP-luc. Total RNA Isolation and RNase Protection Assay (RPA)—Experiments were performed as described (38Ma Z. Qin H. Benveniste E.N. J.

Briefly, total cellular RNA was isolated from confluent monolayers of cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 324-bp fragment corresponding to 1500–1824 nucleotides of human MMP-2 cDNA was used to generate a radiolabeled antisense RNA probe. A pAMP-1 vector containing a fragment of human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA (corresponding to 43–531 nucleotides) was linearized with NcoI and used to generate a radiolabeled antisense RNA of 290 nucleotides with T7 polymerase. Twenty micrograms of total RNA was hybridized with MMP-2 (40 × 103 cpm) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (20 × 103 cpm) riboprobes at 42 °C overnight. The hybridized mixture was then treated with RNase A/T1 (1:200) at room temperature for 1 h and analyzed by 5% denaturing (8 m urea) PAGE. Quantification of protected RNA fragments was performed using the PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Gelatin Substrate Gel Zymography—Zymography was performed as described previously (38Ma Z. Qin H. Benveniste E.N. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5150-5159Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were incubated until ∼80% confluent, then the media was aspirated and fresh serum-free medium was added. Supernatants were collected after a 36-h incubation. Concentrated supernatants were mixed with SDS sample buffer without reducing agent, and proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 8% polyacrylamide gels that were copolymerized with 1.5 mg/ml gelatin. After electrophoresis, the gels were washed several times in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature to remove the SDS, and then incubated for 36 h at 37 °C in buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 1 μm ZnCl2. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue (0.25%) for 30 min, and then destained for 1 h in a solution of acetic acid and methanol. Proteolytic activity was evidenced as clear bands (zones of gelatin degradation) against the blue background of stained gelatin. Immunoblot Analysis of MMP-2—The same supernatants obtained for zymography were used in immunoblot analysis for MMP-2. Concentrated supernatants were boiled for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer and electrophoresed in 8% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and the membrane was then blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline with 0.01% Tween-20 for 1 h. The blots were incubated with anti-MMP-2 antibody (5 μg/ml) in antibody dilution buffer (0.5% Tween-20, 1% bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 1 m glucose in Tris-buffered saline) at 4 °C overnight. Blots were washed four times in Tris-buffered saline with 0.01% Tween-20, and subsequently incubated in sheep-anti-mouse peroxidase conjugated antibody (1:3000) in antibody dilution buffer. After a 45 min incubation at room temperature, the blots were washed four times, and ECL reagents used for development. In Vivo DSP Cross-linking, Immunoprecipitation, and Immuno blot—In vivo cross-linking and immunoprecipitation were performed as described by Liu et al. (39Liu H. Kang H. Liu R. Chen X. Zhao K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6471-6479Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). 108 HeLa cells or SW-13 cells transfected with Brg-1 or BJ-5 were cross-linked with 0.6 mg/ml DSP in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature. After extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the nuclei were purified as described below. Nuclei were lysed, and equal amounts of nuclear protein were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies against Brg-1, Sp1 or normal IgG as a negative control. Protein A/G-agarose beads were added for 2 h at 4 °C, and the immunoprecipitates were washed five times with washing buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100). Immuno-complexes were eluted from the agarose beads by boiling in 2× SDS-sample buffer with 0.2 m dithiothreitol, and subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and the membrane was detected with specific antibody against Sp1 by Western blot analysis. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assays—Transient transfection was performed by using LipofectAMINE as previously described (38Ma Z. Qin H. Benveniste E.N. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5150-5159Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were assayed in triplicate with the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The luciferase activity of each sample was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity before calculating the fold-induction value. The luciferase activity from the vector control was arbitrarily set at 1 for calculation of fold-induction. Preparation of Nuclei—Isolation of nuclei from HeLa and SW-13 cells was carried out as described previously (40Albert T. Wells J. Funk J.O. Pullner A. Raschke E.E. Stelzer G. Meisterernst M. Farnham P.J. Eick D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20482-20490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were spun at 1200 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The pelleted cells were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. After 5 min of incubation on ice, the lysate was spun at 1500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C then the nuclei were resuspended in MNase digestion buffer. Mapping of Nucleosomes by Micrococcal Nuclease and Southern Blotting—1 × 107 nuclei in 200 μl of MNase digestion buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.05 mm EDTA) were incubated with increasing amounts of MNase (0–50 units) at 30 °C for 10 min. The digestion reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 mm EDTA. Genomic DNA was purified as described previously (40Albert T. Wells J. Funk J.O. Pullner A. Raschke E.E. Stelzer G. Meisterernst M. Farnham P.J. Eick D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20482-20490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). 20 μg of purified genomic DNA or DNA isolated from MNase-digested nuclei was first digested by appropriate restriction enzymes and then separated in a 1.5% (v/v) agarose gel and transferred to a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The UV cross-linked blot was hybridized with random primer-labeled PCR probes as indicated. All the probes were generated by using specific MMP-2 primers and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. Hybridization was carried out for 24 h in Church buffer (7% (v/v) SDS, 0.5 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.1) at 65 °C. Blots were washed four times with 1% SDS in 2 × SSC for two times, and two times in 1% SDS in 0.1 × SSC before exposure to the PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Restriction Enzyme Hypersensitivity Analysis—Purified nuclei were digested with 10 units of AvaI per μg of DNA for 20 min at 25 °C. Genomic DNA was then purified and subjected to digestion by EcoRI, and Southern blotting was performed as described above. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—The ChIP assay was performed as previously described (41Ma Z. Shah R. Chang M. Benveniste E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5496-5509Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed by adding formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1% in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and nuclei were purified as described above. Nuclei were then resuspended in Tris-EDTA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors and sonicated until the size of DNA fragments were in the range of 500–1000 bp. Soluble chromatin was then clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C, and ∼1% of the sonicate was saved as input. The chromatin sample was adjusted in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and 140 mm NaCl) and precleared by protein A/G beads in the presence of sonicated λ DNA and bovine serum albumin. Two to four A260 units of precleared chromatin were immunoprecipitated with 2–5 μg of appropriate antibodies, and the immuno-complexes were absorbed with protein A/G beads. The immunoprecipitates were then washed four times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 0.3 mm NaCl, once with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer without NaCl, and a final wash with TE. Heating at 65 °C for 6 h reversed the DNA-protein cross-links; DNA was extracted by proteinase K digestion and phenol-chloroform extraction and, finally, precipitated by ethanol. Approximately one-fifth of the immunoprecipitated DNA was used for semi-quantitative PCR. Immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified by a primer pair corresponding to a 247-bp fragment (-233 to +13) from the human MMP-2 promoter, or a primer pair corresponding to a 331-bp fragment (-245 to +85) of the human U6 snRNA gene (42Nissen R.M. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2314-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), and subjected to semi-quantitative PCR. The PCR reaction included 26–32 PCR cycles. The PCR reaction products were resolved in 2% agarose gels in 1 × TAE buffer (40 mm Tris-acetate, 1 mm EDTA pH 8.3), and the gels were stained with ethidium bromide. In experiments with transfected SW-13 cells, PCR was performed for 25–28 cycles in the presence of 2.5 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP, and the products were fractionated in 4% polyacrylamide gels. The dried gels were analyzed with the PhosphorImager. Densitometry was used to quantify the PCR results, and all results were normalized by respective input values and then normalized to the intensity of the internal control U6 snRNA. Reconstitution of Brg-1 Potentiates Transcription of the Human MMP-2 Gene in SW-13 Cells—It has been shown that the SWI/SNF complex enhances the expression of ∼80 genes in SW-13 cells, which lack expression of both the Brg-1 and Brm subunits of SWI/SNF, or lack a functional SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex (29Liu R. Liu H. Chen X. Kirby M. Brown P.O. Zhao K.J. Cell. 2001; 106: 309-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). We initiated our study on the function of Brg-1 in MMP-2 gene transcription by reconstitution of Brg-1 or mutant Brg-1 (K798R), which lacks ATPase function, into SW-13 cells, and then evaluated the expression of MMP-2. As shown in Fig. 1A, SW-13 cells transfected with the empty vector (BJ-5) express very low levels of MMP-2, however, reconstitution of Brg-1 enhanced expression of the MMP-2 protein as evaluated by both zymography and immunoblotting. Reconstitution of Brg-1 (K798R) had only a modest effect on MMP-2 protein expression compared with transfection with the BJ-5 vector. Equivalent levels of Brg-1 and Brg-1 (K798R) were expressed upon transfection into SW-13 cells (Fig. 1B). We also examined MMP-2 mRNA levels expressed in Brg-1 and Brg-1 (K798R)-transfected SW-13 cells. Reconstitution of Brg-1 enhanced MMP-2 mRNA expression ∼5.2-fold compared with the control vector BJ-5, whereas Brg-1 (K798R) transfection had a minimal influence on MMP-2 mRNA expression (∼1.5-fold) (Fig. 1C). Similar to the data on MMP-2 protein, expression of MMP-2 mRNA is potentiated by Brg-1, but not by the mutant Brg-1 protein. HeLa cells were used as a positive control for these experiments, because they express high levels of Brg-1 and express MMP-2 mRNA and protein constitutively (Fig. 1D). Thus, our data suggest that Brg-1 is required for maximal expression of the MMP-2 gene. Proper Chromatin Context Is Required for Brg-1 to Potentiate MMP-2 Promoter Activity—To study the influence of Brg-1 on MMP-2 promoter activity, we cloned the 1.7-kb promoter of the human MMP-2 gene into both pGL3 and pREP vectors. This construct contains the Sp1/Sp3 site at -91 and AP-2 site at -61 that are critical for constitutive MMP-2 promoter activity (3Qin H. Sun Y. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29130-29137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The pREP vector is an episomal reporter vector that can form a proper chromatin structure when transfected into host cells (29Liu R. Liu H. Chen X. Kirby M. Brown P.O. Zhao K.J. Cell. 2001; 106: 309-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 31Huang M. Qian F. Hu Y. Ang C. Li Z. Wen Z. Nat. Cell.

Chem. 2000; 275: 697-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Both pGL3 and pREP-based MMP-2 luciferase vectors were transiently transfected into SW-13 cells with increasing amounts of BJ-5, Brg-1, or Brg-1 (K798R), then luciferase activity was determined 24 h later. Our results indicate that the MMP-2 promoter in the pREP episomal vector was enhanced by Brg-1 (∼5-fold), whereas Brg-1 (K798R) did not affect MMP-2 promoter activity (Fig. 2A). In contrast, Brg-1 did not enhance MMP-2 promoter activity in the pGL3-based vector (Fig. 2B), which can not form a regular-phased nucleosome structure in transfected cells. Thus, our data suggest that proper chromatin structure is required for Brg-1 to enhance MMP-2 promoter activity. Constitutive Accessibility of the Genomic Locus of the Human MMP-2 Promoter Region—The results above indicate that chromatin structure is important for Brg-1 to potentiate MMP-2 gene expression, thus, we next studied the chromatin structure and chromatin remodeling of the MMP-2 promoter in vivo. As we had previously shown that the"
https://openalex.org/W2078944494,"Flavodoxins are well known one-domain α/β electron-transfer proteins that, according to the presence or absence of a ∼20-residue loop splitting the fifth β-strand of the central β-sheet, have been classified in two groups: long and short-chain flavodoxins, respectively. Although the flavodoxins have been extensively used as models to study electron transfer, ligand binding, protein stability and folding issues, the role of the loop has not been investigated. We have constructed two shortened versions of the long-chain Anabaena flavodoxin in which the split β-strand has been spliced to remove the original loop. The two variants have been carefully analyzed using various spectroscopic and hydrodynamic criteria, and one of them is clearly well folded, indicating that the long loop is a peripheral element of the structure of long flavodoxins. However, the removal of the loop (which is not in contact with the cofactor in the native structure) markedly decreases the affinity of the apoflavodoxin-FMN complex. This seems related to the fact that, in long flavodoxins, the adjacent tyrosine-bearing FMN binding loop (which is longer and thus more flexible than in short flavodoxins) is stabilized in its competent conformation by interactions with the excised loop. The modest role played by the long loop of long flavodoxins in the structure of these proteins (and in its conformational stability, see López-Llano, J., Maldonado, S., Jain, S., Lostao, A., Godoy-Ruiz, R., Sanchez-Ruiz, Cortijo, M., Fernández-Recio, J., and Sancho, J. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 47184–47191) opens the possibility that its conservation in so many species is related to a functional role yet to be discovered. In this respect, we discuss the possibility that the long loop is involved in the recognition of some flavodoxin partners. In addition, we report on a structural feature of flavodoxins that could indicate that the short flavodoxins derive from the long ones.

In this respect, we discuss the possibility that the long loop is involved in the recognition of some flavodoxin partners. In addition, we report on a structural feature of flavodoxins that could indicate that the short flavodoxins derive from the long ones. The flavodoxins are electron transfer proteins involved in both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic reactions, which carry a molecule of non-covalently bound FMN as their only redox center (1Mayhew S.G.

Chemistry and Biochemistry of flavoenzymes. III. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 427-466Google Scholar). Soon after their discovery, it was realized that they could be isolated in two sizes and were accordingly divided in two classes: 1) the short-chain flavodoxins (i.e. Clostridium beijerincki and Desulfovibrio vulgaris flavodoxins) and 2) the long-chain ones (i.e. Synechococcus sp. (strain PCC 7942) and Anabaena sp. (strain PCC 7119) flavodoxins). Once the x-ray structures of representatives of the two groups became available (3Ludwig M.L. Andersen R.D. Mayhew S.G. Massey V. J.

Because many of the functional and thermodynamic properties of short and long flavodoxins are similar (redox potentials, affinity for the FMN redox cofactor, and so forth), it is not clear yet what role the extra loop of the long flavodoxins may play.

In this work, we investigate the influence of the long loop of Anabaena flavodoxin on the structure and cofactor binding of the apoprotein by deriving and studying two shortened variants where the long loop has been removed by site-directed mutagenesis. Although one of the shortened variants displays a somewhat altered structure compatible with some local unfolding, the second one is clearly well folded, indicating that the loop is not required for the correct folding of the long flavodoxins. Surprisingly, the affinity of the shortened protein for its cofactor is severely reduced despite the fact that the loop makes no contacts with the FMN in the structure of the holoflavodoxin. From a comparison of the structures of short and long flavodoxins, we propose that this could be related to a role played by the long loop in stabilizing the native conformation of the adjacent tyrosine-bearing loop involved in FMN binding. Additionally, a structural analysis of the conformation of the fifth β-strand in short and long flavodoxins points to the possibility that short flavodoxins derive from the long ones. Site-directed Mutagenesis, Protein Expression, Purification, and Quantitation—Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the flavodoxin gene cloned in the plasmid pTrc99a (21Amann E. Ochs B. Abel K.J. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 69: 310-315Google Scholar) was performed by a modification of the method of Deng and Nickoloff (22Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). The mutagenic oligonucleotide used to delete residues 119–139 to produce the shorter mutant flavodoxin, Δ(119–139), with Gly118 adjacent to Gly140 was 5′-GATTATCTTCATCAAGAGCTAGTCCGCCGACAGTTTTACCACCAC-3′. To delete residues 120–139 and produce Δ(120–139) with Tyr119 adjacent to Gly140, the oligonucleotide used was 5′-GATTATCTTCATCAAGAGCTAGTCCATAGCCGACAGTTTTACCAC-3′. Mutant plasmids were identified by direct sequencing. The expression and purification of flavodoxin mutants were done essentially as described for the wild type protein (23Fillat M.F. Borrias W.E. Weisbeek P. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The purity of each flavodoxin preparation was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mutants were purified as apoproteins, as they lost the FMN prosthetic group along the purification. The concentration of the mutants was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm (24Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar) using an extinction coefficient of 25,590 m-1 cm-1 for Δ(119–139) and of 27,000 m-1 cm-1 for Δ(120–139). Absorbance, Fluorescence, Circular Dichroism, and1H NMR Spectra—Absorbance spectra were recorded at 298.2 ± 0.1 K in a Kontron Uvikon 860 spectrophotometer. Corrected steady-state fluorescence emission at 298.2 ± 0.1 K in the 300–450-nm range was obtained on a SLM 8000D spectrofluorometer with excitation at 295 nm. Far-UV and near-UV circular dichroism spectra at 298.2 ± 0.1 K were recorded in a Jasco 710 spectropolarimeter using a 0.1- and 1-cm cuvette, respectively. 1H NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker AMX-600 pulse spectrometer operating at a proton frequency of 600.13 MHz. One-dimensional spectra were recorded at 298.2 ± 0.1 K using 32-K data points zero-filled to 64 K before performing the Fourier transformation. Water suppression was achieved by selective presaturation. The temperature of the NMR probe was calibrated with methanol. Samples for NMR experiments were prepared at 1–2 mm protein concentration in 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10% D2O. Sodium [3-trimethylsilyl 2,2,3,3-2H4] propionate (TSP) was the internal reference. Determination of the Apparent Molecular Weight of Δ(119–139) and Δ(120–139)—The apparent molecular weights of Δ(119–139) and Δ(120–139) apoflavodoxins were determined by automated molecular exclusion chromatography in fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) with a Superose 12HR 10/30 column equilibrated in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, containing 100 mm NaCl. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. FMN Binding to Δ(120–139) Apoflavodoxin—The interaction of the FMN cofactor with Δ(120–139) apoflavodoxin was studied fluorimetrically (the binding of FMN to apoflavodoxin strongly quenches its fluorescence emission) and by molecular exclusion chromatography. The FMN used was 98% pure according to reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The fluorescence experiments were carried out in a Kontron SMF 25 fluorimeter (excitation at 445 nm, emission from 500 to 600 nm) at 298.2 ± 0.1 K in the darkness. The cofactor (0.9 ml of 0.2 μm FMN in 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7) was mixed with 0.1 ml of 530 μm Fld Δ(120–139) in the same buffer, and the mixture was allowed to reach equilibrium for 5 min before an emission spectrum was recorded. In the molecular exclusion experiments, an fast protein liquid chromatography apparatus (Amersham Biosciences) was used, equipped with a Superose 12HR 10/30 column equilibrated in 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, containing 150 mm NaCl. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and the absorbance at 464 nm was followed. A mixture of 344 μm Δ(120–139) and 820 μm FMN preincubated in the same buffer for 90 min was loaded in the column. Time-resolved Fluorescence and Fluorescence Anisotropy Measurements—Time-resolved fluorescence intensity and depolarization measurements at 298.2 ± 0.1 K were performed in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, using the time-correlated single photon-counting technique. The experimental setup and analysis was similar to the one described previously (25Lillo M.P. Cañadas O. Dale R.E. Acuña A.U. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12436-12449Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Total fluorescence decays at different emission wavelengths were globally analyzed, assuming a four-exponential model. Anisotropy decays were described by a biexponential function. Details of the analysis will be described elsewhere. Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy provides a direct measurement of the hydrodynamic volume of proteins in solution, because the global rotational correlation times determined, φG, are related to hydrated molecular volumes, VH, and solution viscosities, η, by the Stokes-Einstein relationship: (ϕG=ηHv/kT) . Spectroscopically Based Structural Characterization of Δ(119–139) and Δ(120–139) Apoflavodoxins—Several spectroscopic and hydrodynamic properties of Δ(119–139) and Δ(120–139) apoflavodoxins have been compared with those of the entire protein. Because both the fluorescence and near-UV CD spectra of wild type apoflavodoxin seem dominated by contributions from Trp120 (13Irun M.P. Maldonado S. Sancho J. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and this residue is no longer present in the shortened flavodoxins, we will compare the spectroscopic properties of the shortened apoflavodoxins with those of the W120F apoflavodoxin mutant (termed pseudo wild type, pWT), 1The abbreviations used is: pWT, pseudo wild type; FNR, ferredoxin oxidoreductase. which is a more appropriate reference than wild type. We have first compared the fluorescence emission spectra of the shortened variants with that of pWT apoflavodoxin (Fig. 2A). The deletion mutants display a more quenched tryptophan emission, especially the Δ(120–139) variant, and slight differences in the emission spectra at λ <340 nm relative to pWT. The relative amplitudes, determined at different emission wavelengths, and the fluorescence lifetimes were used to resolve the emission spectra associated with individual decay constants. The decay-associated spectra (26Donzel B. Gauduchon P. Wahl P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1974; 96: 801-808Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar) displayed in all of the cases the same pattern (data not shown). The maximum of the emission spectra associated with the longest lifetime (5.1 ns for pWT and 4.7 ns for both deletion mutants) was ∼345 nm. This lifetime (that has been associated to Trp57) 2M. P. Lillo and J. Sancho, manuscript in preparation. is the one that contributes most to the slight differences observed for the three protein variants. The exposure of aromatic residues to solvent in the shortened and in the full-length pWT apoflavodoxin has been further investigated by recording absorbance difference spectra (native minus denatured) in the near-UV. The shape of the difference spectra (Fig. 2B) is the same in the three proteins, indicating a substantial aromatic residue burial in all of them. The two truncated apoflavodoxins show quite similar difference spectra, although the intensity of the shorter Δ(119–139) is a bit lower, which is suggestive of a greater exposure of its aromatic residues in the folded conformation. The far- and near-UV CD spectra of the short flavodoxins are compared with those of pWT in Figs. 2, C and D, respectively. The far-UV spectra indicate that the two shortened apoflavodoxins contain substantial helical structure with helical contents not very different from that of pWT. The greater (in absolute value) mean residue ellipticity of Δ(120–139), relative to pWT, is simply due to its reduced number of loop residues. In fact, its molecular ellipticity is almost the same (98% pWT). As for Δ(119–139), its helical content is 77% that of pWT and its deeper and blue-shifted minimum of around 207 nm confirms that it is somewhat less structured. This is also suggested by the near-UV CD data (Fig. 2D), whereas both pWT and Δ(120–139) display distinct spectra in this region, indicating that they present some well defined tertiary interactions involving aromatic residues, Δ(119–139) shows a flat spectrum deprived from any peak. However, Because, in a protein with few tryptophan residues, this is not conclusive evidence of a lack of well folded tertiary structure, we have acquired 1H NMR spectra of the two shortened apoflavodoxins (Fig. 3). The large dispersion of the NH amide protons (10.5–6.0 ppm) and the presence of signals at δ < 0.5 ppm and in the 5.0–6.0-ppm spectral region clearly indicate that the two shortened variants are substantially well folded and point to a loss of local interactions in Δ(119–139) rather than to a more global denaturation. Hydrodynamically Based Structural Characterization of Δ(119–139) and Δ(120–139) Apoflavodoxins—In addition to the spectroscopic characterization, molecular exclusion chromatography experiments have been performed. Both mutant flavodoxins are eluted from the gel filtration column as single peaks (data not shown) whose elution volumes are concentration-independent from 5 to 200 μm. This finding indicates that the truncated flavodoxins are monomeric. The elution volumes, slightly higher than that of pWT, indicate that the shortened proteins are similarly compact as the entire protein as much as gel filtration experiments can estimate. From a calibration of the column, we estimate the difference in molecular mass between the shortened apoflavodoxins and the pWT at 1.5 kDa, the theoretical difference being 2.5 kDa. To obtain a finer picture of the apparent size of the variants in solution, we have determined their rotational correlation times, which are linearly dependent on their hydrodynamic volume. Because the apoflavodoxin variants contain three tryptophan residues, their fluorescence emission will be depolarized by internal local motions, characteristic of each tryptophan microenvironment, and by the overall global protein rotation. To understand the contribution of individual tryptophans to the anisotropy decay, we have performed a complete fluorescence intensity and anisotropy characterization of the wild type protein and of a set of different tryptophan apoflavodoxin mutants.2 The size and shape of the apoflavodoxin variants then have been estimated from their global rotational correlation times. The φG measured for pWT (6.9 ns, data not shown) agrees well with that determined for wild type apoflavodoxin (7.1 ns) and with the theoretical predictions from the Stokes-Einstein relationship (assuming a hydrated volume of 3.2 nm3 estimated from the x-ray structure of the wild type protein). The global rotational correlation time for Δ(120–139) is also the same within the error (6.7 ns). In contrast, Δ(119–139) displays a correlation time of 8.1 ns, ∼20% higher than that of pWT, which confirms that the global structure of Δ(119–139) is less compact than that of Δ(120–139). FMN Binding to Fld Δ(120–139) Flavodoxin—Both Δ(119–139) and Δ(120–139) are purified as apoproteins, the FMN prosthetic group being lost in the purification. We have tried to reconstitute the holoform of the natively folded Δ(120–139) apoflavodoxin by adding FMN to it. When the binding of the cofactor was followed fluorimetrically at a 300 Δ(120–139)/FMN molar ratio, a small change in the emission maximum of FMN that shifted from 525 to 523 was observed (data not shown). This indicates that FMN can still bind to Δ(120–139) apoflavodoxin but that the affinity is much lower than in the wild type full-length protein. To estimate a value for the affinity of the complex, we performed size-exclusion experiments where a mixture of FMN and Δ(120–139) incubated for 90 min was filtered through a Superose 12HR 10/30 column. Two absorbance peaks at 464 nm were detected (Fig. 4), one corresponding to the elution of free FMN and a second minor one corresponding to the elution volume of Δ(120–139). Precise calculation of equilibrium binding constants from size-exclusion chromatography experiments is admittedly difficult, because the complex that is formed during sample incubation may dissociate during the chromatography unless the koff is very low. A lower limit for the Kb can nevertheless be estimated assuming that no significant dissociation has taken place in the column and that the concentrations of the different species calculated from the absorbance of their corresponding peaks represent those in the loaded sample. The fact that the elution volumes of the peaks observed in the chromatogram of the Δ(120–139)/FMN mixture are very similar to those of the separately loaded molecules suggests that the approximation is not too gross in this case. From the absorbance of the different peaks, we estimate that Kb is larger than 2849 m-1 (Kd < 350 μm), corresponding to an affinity of the complex greater than -4.7 kcal mol-1. Similar numbers are obtained if the areas of the peaks rather than their actual maximal absorbances are used in the calculation (data not shown). The affinity of the wild type apoflavodoxin/FMN complex is certainly greater (18Lostao A. El Harrous M. Daoudi F. Romero A. Parody-Morreale A. Sancho J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9518-9526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (approximately -12.5 kcal mol-1 at the same ionic strength). Insights into the Structure of Apoflavodoxin Lacking the Long Loop Characteristic of Long Flavodoxins—Among the long flavodoxins, the sequence of the long loop splitting the fifth β5 strand is similarly conserved as it is the sequence of the rest of the protein (data not shown). This finding suggests that the loop may play a role from either the structural or the functional point of view. To assess the structural relevance of the loop, we have constructed two shortened apoflavodoxins where either the Gly118 or the Tyr119 wild type residue has been connected to the wild type Gly140 residue, thus removing the long loop from the Anabaena apoflavodoxin. The expression yields of the two variants were high, and unlike other shortened apoflavodoxin fragments previously produced in the laboratory (15Maldonado S. Jimenez M.A. Langdon G.M. Sancho J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10589-10596Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), they can be purified in the conventional way used to purify wild type flavodoxin; although they are obtained in the apoform. The low resolution hydrodynamic characterization performed by size-exclusion chromatography indicates that both shortened forms are monomeric and that their apparent molecular weights are consistent with those of compact conformations rather than markedly unfolded ones. Their compactness is also evidenced by the tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra and the near-UV absorbance difference spectra (Fig. 2, A and B) that show that the aromatic residues, specifically the tryptophans, are not fully exposed to solvent. In addition, both shortened apoflavodoxins contain a substantial secondary structure (Fig. 2C). However, small differences are observed that indicate that Δ(119–139) is somewhat less compact, its absorbance difference spectrum is less intense, its helical content is reduced, and its near-UV CD spectra are flat. Consistent with this spectroscopic evidence, our analysis of the global rotational correlation times2 indicates that, although Δ(120–139) and pWT are similarly compact, Δ(119–139) is somewhat expanded. Nevertheless, we notice that, in the NMR spectra (Fig. 3), both shortened apoflavodoxins display low field resonances, peak dispersion, and line-widths similar to those of well folded proteins. This means that Δ(119–139) is mostly in a native-like conformation, probably not far from the one described for the wild type protein (7Genzor C.G. Perales-Alcon A. Sancho J. Romero A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 329-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 9Genzor C.G. Beldarrain A. Gomez-Moreno C. Lopez-Lacomba J.L. Cortijo M. Sancho J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1376-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and therefore, the greater size and lack of near-UV CD signal observed in Fld Δ(119–139) may be related to the local unfolding of a small region of the protein, possibly involving an α-helix. The way the two variants were designed may help to explain their structural differences. They were simply designed to provide alternative ways for the protein to accommodate the removal of the loop. In principle, the nitrogen of Gly140 is at very similar distances from the carbonyl carbons of Gly118 (5.16 Å) and of Tyr119 (5.00 Å). To make a canonical β-strand out of the two bits connected (strands β5a, 115–117, and β5b, 140–143) and make it pair with strand β4 (residues 81–89), only one spacing residue (Gly118) is required. In this respect, the shorter mutant Δ(119–139) contains all of the residues necessary to form a fifth strand of the appropriate length. The fact that it folds to a close to native but locally expanded conformation is the likely consequence of an insufficient stabilization of the hypothetical canonical fifth β-strand formed by splicing residues 118 and 140. This makes the shortened protein relax into a less compact conformation where, as judged from the reduced helical content, one α-helix is probably unwound. Helices 4 and 5 flanking the long loop are the likely candidates. In contrast, the native-like spectroscopic properties of the longer variant Δ(120–139) illustrate that even the connection is “too long” to form a canonical strand. The greater flexibility afforded by the extra residue allows the mutant protein to fold into a native conformation. In fact, the inspection of the available x-ray structures of short flavodoxins (from Desulfovibrio vulgaris, Protein Data Bank code 1J8Q, and from Clostridium beijerinckii, Protein Data Bank code 2FDX) shows that their fifth β-strand contains a bulge at precisely the same point where it appears split by the long loop in the long flavodoxins. Importantly, the correct folding of the shortened Δ(120–139) apoflavodoxin clearly illustrates the non-relevance of the extra loop of long flavodoxins for adopting a well folded conformation. Thus, this long loop appears to play a peripheral role from the structural point of view. The Long Loop, the Tyrosine-bearing Loop, and FMN Binding—We have investigated the interaction of FMN with shortened flavodoxin using the Δ(120–139) variant, which is natively folded. Somewhat surprisingly, the affinity of Δ(120–139) apoflavodoxin for the prosthetic group is drastically reduced, despite the fact that none of the residues of the loop make direct contact with FMN in holoflavodoxin. It should be noticed, however, that several long loop residues are in contact (Fig. 5) with the short loop that bears the highly conserved and functionally important tyrosine residue (Tyr94 in Anabaena flavodoxin) that lays on one face of the FMN in the vast majority of flavodoxins of the known structure (17Lostao A. Gómez-Moreno C. Mayhew S.G. Sancho J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14334-14344Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and stabilizes the functional complex (18Lostao A. El Harrous M. Daoudi F. Romero A. Parody-Morreale A. Sancho J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9518-9526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It is clear that even subtle changes around the tyrosine loop could produce the observed decrease in the affinity for FMN. The fact that the fluorescence of Trp57 located at the other loop involved in FMN binding (Figs. 1 and 5) is altered in the shortened apoflavodoxins may reveal a further propagation of conformational changes to this more distant FMN binding loop. Importantly, we notice that, in short flavodoxins, the tyrosine loop is shorter than in long flavodoxins (by one or two residues; see Fig. 5). This should reduce in short flavodoxins the conformational flexibility of the tyrosine loop to a point that no additional interactions with the missing long loop would be needed to fix the side chain of the redox active and FMN binding important tyrosine residue in its functional conformation. Thus, the long loop itself should not be regarded as an essential feature for the binding of the cofactor. Short flavodoxins that lack it manage to fold the tyrosine loop similarly to long flavodoxins (Fig. 5) and indeed bind FMN tightly. Nevertheless, the long loop seems to be used by long flavodoxins as a conformational helper to stabilize the FMN binding competent conformation of their longer tyrosine bearing loop, thus increasing the affinity of the functional complex. Work is in progress in our laboratory to try to increase the FMN affinity of Δ(120–139) by replacing its tyrosine loop by equivalent loops of short flavodoxins. A Structural Hint on a Possible Derivation of Short Flavodoxins from the Long Ones—So far, it is not clear which version of the flavodoxin gene (the long or the short one) is older. To investigate this issue, we have performed a phylogenetic analysis of the available short and long flavodoxin sequences (data not shown). The analysis indicates that horizontal transfer of the flavodoxin gene has been frequent, which complicates the interpretation. However, from a completely different perspective, we have noticed a structural feature of the short-chain flavodoxins that might be consistent with their derivation from the long ones. As has been mentioned, the fifth β-strand of short flavodoxins contains a bulge at precisely the point where the loop of the long flavodoxins departs from the β-sheet. We show in Fig. 6 a superimposition of the β-sheets of the long Anabaena flavodoxin (Protein Data Bank code 1FTG) and of the short flavodoxin from Desulfovibrio (Protein Data Bank code 1J8Q). The β-sheets are very similar and can be superimposed very well. Significantly, in the short flavodoxin, the hydrogen-bonding pattern between strands 4 and 5 is clearly distorted because the fifth strand contains a bulge. The short flavodoxin from Clostridium contains the same bulge at the same position (data not shown). We notice that the bulge is located exactly where the long flavodoxins display the long loop that split their fifth strand. In principle, it is possible that an ancient short flavodoxins would have contained a central β-sheet that was regular in all of them but in the presence of a bulge and that the long loop was later inserted precisely at the bulge. Nevertheless, we think more probably that the bulge simply represents a vestigial remain of the lost loop of the more ancient long flavodoxins. Is There Room for a Specific Role of the Flavodoxin Long Loop?—The presence of this fairly long loop in so many flavodoxins and the fact that its sequence is similarly conserved as that of the rest of the protein (data not shown) together with the small influence of the loop in the overall structure and stability of the protein (see also Ref. 37López-Llano J. Maldonado S. Jain S. Lostao A. Godoy-Ruiz R. Sanchez-Ruiz Cortijo M. Fernández-Recio J. Sancho J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47184-47191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar for details) suggests that the loop could play an unknown functional role rather than a structural one. Looking for hints, we have performed a BLAST search for short and nearly exact matches of the loop sequence in other proteins, but no close homologues of the loop are evident (data not shown). On the other hand, given the location of the loop in the structure, not very far from the redox active site of the protein, where the FMN group is tightly bound (Fig. 1), we speculate that one possible role of the loop could be that of providing binding residues for flavodoxin partner proteins. Several of these have been identified in the different metabolic pathways where the flavodoxins are involved. In Escherichia coli, flavodoxin is required for the reductive activation of cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase (27Osborne C. Chen L.M. Matthews R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1729-1737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), for biotin synthesis (28Sanyal I. Gibson K.J. Flint D.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and for the anaerobic activation of both ribonucleotide reductase (29Bianchi V. Eliasson V.R. Fontecave M. Mulliez E. Hoover D.M. Matthews R.G. Reichard P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and pyruvate-formate lyase (30Sawers G. Watson G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In nitrogen-fixing bacteria, such as Anabaena, flavodoxin is the electron donor for the nitrogenase iron-containing protein (31Fillat M.F. Sandmann G. Gomez-Moreno C. Arch. Microbiol. 1988; 150: 160-164Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, flavodoxins can replace ferredoxin under certain conditions and have been shown to be substrates of the NADPH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (FNR) of cyanobacteria (32Smillie R.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1965; 20: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and of E. coli (33Blaschkowski H.P. Never G. Ludwig-Festl M. Knappe J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), of the pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase of Clostridium pasteurianum (34Fitzgerald M.P. Rogers L.J. Rao K.K. Hall D.O. Biochem. J. 1980; 192: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and of the enzymes of dissimilatory sulfate reduction (35Peck Jr., H.D. LeGall J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1982; 298: 443-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Experimental evidence that the flavodoxin long loop could be involved in the interaction of E. coli flavodoxin with methionine synthase has already been provided by NMR mapping (36Hall D.A. Vander Kooi C.W. Stasik C.N. Stevens S.Y. Zuiderweg E.R.P. Matthews R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9521-9526Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). According to the chemical shift perturbations observed upon flavodoxin binding to methionine synthase, three residues of the flavodoxin long loop could be in contact with the enzyme in the complex. In the same study, the flavodoxin/FNR complex was also investigated. Significantly, a larger number of loop residues (six or more) were found to change their chemical shift upon binding to FNR. In fact, in the flavodoxin/FNR complex, the long loop is the flavodoxin region where the largest chemical shift changes take place upon complex formation (36Hall D.A. Vander Kooi C.W. Stasik C.N. Stevens S.Y. Zuiderweg E.R.P. Matthews R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9521-9526Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that the flavodoxin long loop could play an important role in the recognition of non-photosynthetic FNRs. In addition, our preliminary phylogenetic analysis (data not shown) indicates that photosynthetic FNR is consistently associated to long flavodoxin organisms. Thus, a possibility exists that the flavodoxin long loop is similarly involved in the recognition of photosynthetic FNRs. Although the loop splitting the fifth β-strand in long-chain flavodoxins does not contain FMN binding residues and it is not essential for the proper folding of the apoprotein, it seems very important to stabilize the adjacent Tyr94-bearing FMN binding loop to the extent that Anabaena apoflavodoxin no longer binds FMN with high affinity when the long loop is removed. This should not be taken to imply that the long loop chief role is to assist in FMN binding, because the short flavodoxins can also bind FMN very efficiently. Given the conservation of the long loop among flavodoxins and its small influence on the structure and stability of the protein (see also Ref. 37López-Llano J. Maldonado S. Jain S. Lostao A.

Chem. 2004; 279: 47184-47191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we suggest that it might serve to interact with flavodoxin partners."
https://openalex.org/W1963874747,"Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) contains three fibronectin type II (col) modules that contribute to its collagen specificity. We observed that the CD spectra of the separate col modules account for the CD and temperature profiles of the in-tandem col-123 construct. Thus, to the extent of not significantly perturbing the secondary structure and thermal stability characteristics of the neighboring units, the domains within col-123 do not interact. Via NMR, we investigated ligand binding properties of the three repeats within col-123: col-123/1 (the col-1 domain within col-123), col-123/2, and col-123/3. Interactions of col-123 with the collagen mimic peptide (Pro-Pro-Gly)6 (PPG6) and propeptide segment PIIKFPGDVA (p33–42) were studied. While col-123/1 and col-123/2 bound PPG6, they interacted more weakly with p33–42. In contrast, col-123/3 exhibited a higher affinity for p33–42 than for PPG6. Thus, despite their structural homology, the col repeats of MMP-2 differ in substrate specificity. Furthermore the binding affinities toward the three in-tandem col repeats were close to those determined for the individual isolated domains or for col-12/1, indicating that vis-à-vis these ligands each module interacts essentially as an autonomous unit. Interestingly the domains within col-123 exhibited enhanced affinities for Hel3, a construct that contains ((Gly-Pro-Pro)12)3 in triple helical configuration. Nevertheless the affinities were significantly higher for col-123/1 and col-123/2 relative to col-123/3 in line with their behaviors toward PPG6. This hints at a cooperative participation toward Hel3, which is a closer mimic of collagen, a hypothesis that is supported by the detected lower affinities of col-12/1, col-12/2, col-2, col-23/2, col-3, and col-23/3 for Hel3.

Tryggvason K. Garbisa S. Hart I. Foltz C.M. Shafie S. Nature. 1980; 284: 67-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). In particular MMP-2 and MMP-9 are considered critical in that they both degrade collagen IV, thus facilitating penetration of the basement membranes by tumor cells (2Mackay A.R. Hartzler J.L.

Moreover MMP-2 and MMP-9 play important roles in development, tissue remodeling, and inflammation (for a review, see Ref. 4Yu A.E. Murphy A.N. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 85-113Crossref Google Scholar). Besides the catalytic and hemopexin domains common to most MMPs, MMP-2 and MMP-9 also contain three in-tandem fibronectin type II (FN2) modules that are positioned within the protease in the vicinity of the active site. In MMP-2, the FN2 modules are ascribed affinities to gelatin, type I and IV collagens, elastin, and laminin (5Bányai L. Patthy L.

Bergman U. Isupov M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Tryggvason K. Science. 1999; 284: 1667-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). It has been shown that fragments containing two or three consecutive FN2 modules from MMP-2 bind immobilized gelatin stronger than any of the single domains. An earlier study considered the possibility that the three col modules could form a single continuous binding surface (6Bányai L. Tordai H. Patthy L. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, the x-ray structure of the latent MMP-2 (pro-MMP-2) shows that its FN2 domains turn outward so that the binding sites face away from each other, suggesting that each module might act independently. Furthermore NMR ligand binding studies on col-2, col-3, col-12, and col-23 with the gelatin-like octadecapeptide (Pro-Pro-Gly)6 (PPG6) and with the longer analog (Pro-Pro-Gly)12 (PPG12) preclude cooperativity (16Briknarová K.

It also has been shown that a peptide comprising segment 33–42 from the MMP-2 prodomain (p33–42) interacts with col-3 and, to a lesser extent, col-2 (17Briknarová K. Gehrmann M. Bányai L. Tordai H.

Here we report on a study of the ligand binding properties of the three col repeats in-tandem (col-123) (Fig. 1) toward the collagen mimics PPG6 and Hel3, the latter affording a triple helical form of peptide GPP12, where the three polypeptide chains are covalently tethered at the C terminus (20Lauer-Fields J.L. Broder T. Sritharan T. Chung L. Nagase H. Fields G.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5795-5803Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Finally we investigated the ligand binding of col repeats toward the peptides p33–42, WHWRHR (P225), the C-terminal hexapeptide sequence of a 15-mer originally identified using phage display (21Trexler M. Briknarová K. Gehrmann M. Llinás M. Patthy L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12241-12246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and the cyclic peptide CTTHWGFTLC (CTT), previously reported to inhibit the migration of human endothelial and tumor cells (22Koivunen E.

Expression and Purification of col Domains—15N-Labeled col-1, col-2, col-3, col-12, and col-23 belonged to batches described previously (16Briknarová K. Grishaev A. Bányai L. Tordai H. Patthy L.

Grishaev A. Bányai L. Tordai H. Patthy L. Llinás M. Structure (Lond.). 1999; 7: 1235-1245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Expression, isolation of inclusion bodies, and refolding of the proteins were performed essentially as published previously (5Bányai L. Patthy L. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 23-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Properly folded, functionally homogeneous modules were purified on a gelatin-Sepharose 4B column using a 0–8 m urea gradient (6Bányai L. Tordai H. Patthy L. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The N-terminal tag was partially removed by limited digestion with trypsin (16Briknarová K. Grishaev A. Bányai L. Tordai H. Patthy L. Llinás M. Structure (Lond.). 1999; 7: 1235-1245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The protein was purified by gelatin-Sepharose 4B chromatography as described above, desalted by Sephadex G-25 gel filtration, and lyophilized. Synthesis of Peptide Ligands—PPG6, p33–42, P225, and CTT were synthesized on a Model 431A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. The collagen-like homotrimeric, triple helical peptide Hel3 was synthesized using a covalent branching protocol described by Lauer-Fields et al. (20Lauer-Fields J.L. Broder T. Sritharan T. Chung L. Nagase H. Fields G.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5795-5803Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Our peptide is simpler than that described in the above paper inasmuch as the three individual chains are just 12-fold repeats of GPP. The three chains are covalently linked at the C terminus in the same way as described in the above publication. The overall structure of the triple helical peptide is shown in Structure 1. CD Analysis of col Domains—CD measurements were performed on a Jasco-715 spectropolarimeter equipped with a PFD 350S Peltier-type temperature controller. Far-UV CD spectra (260–185 nm) were recorded at 25 °C with protein concentrations of 6–17 μm using a 0.5-cm path length cell (Hellma). Melting curves were measured at 222 nm from 5–95 °C in a 1-cm cell for samples with protein concentrations of 30–50 μm. All FN2 constructs were dissolved in water (pH 7.0 and pH 8.0 adjusted with NaOH). Concentrations of col modules were determined spectrophotometrically based on tryptophan content. The temperature-dependent CD at 222 nm can be visualized as the population weighted average of folded and unfolded protein species, assuming cooperative, reversible two-state unfolding. On this basis, the measured melting curve CD(T) can be modeled as,CD(T)=FU(T)×CDU(T)+(1−FU(T))×CDN(T)(Eq. 1) where CDN(T) and CDU(T) account for the heat capacity-related temperature-dependent contribution of the native and unfolded forms, respectively, to the experimental thermogram. CDN(T) and CDU(T) can be modeled as second order polynomials in T (23Yadav S. Ahmad F. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 283: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). FU(T) denotes the fraction of protein unfolded at temperature T and can be written as, FU(T)=e−1RT(ΔHvH−TΔSvH)1+e−1RT(ΔHvH−TΔSvH)(Eq. 2) where ΔHvH and ΔSvH are the van't Hoff enthalpy and entropy, respectively, and R is the gas constant. We also obtain Tm ≡ ΔHvH/ΔSvH, the associated melting temperature. In the case of col-1, col-2, and col-3, the experimental data are non-linearly fit to Equation 1 via the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm using Origin 5.0 software (MicroCal). Assuming that in col-12, col-23, and col-123 the individual modules are autonomous physical domains, they fold independently, and it should be possible to model the experimental data CD(T) as a sum of the individual transitions, each partitioned as in Equation 1. In practice, it is unfeasible to numerically resolve CDN(T) and CDU(T) for each component of the multimodule constructs. However, one may assume that CDN(T) and CDU(T) are essentially the same for the homologous col domains. With this approximation for our multidomain constructs, we derive, FU(T)=∑i=1N(e−1RT(ΔHivH−TΔSivH)1+e−1RT(ΔHivH−TΔSivH)(Eq. 3) where N is the total number of domains; ΔHvHi and ΔSvHi are the van't Hoff enthalpy and entropy, respectively, of domain i; and the associated melting temperature of domain i is defined at Tmi = ΔHvHi/ΔSvHi. To obtain ΔHvHi and ΔSvHi, the experimental data were fit nonlinearly to Equation 3 via the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. We then assigned each domain i to a specific component of the multimodule array by reference to the thermal unfolding parameter of the isolated modules. NMR Spectroscopy and Data Processing—NMR data were acquired at 25 °C on 500 or 600 MHz Bruker Avance DRX spectrometers equipped with triple resonance z-gradient probes. The base line was corrected with a model-free algorithm developed by Friedrichs (24Friedrichs M.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). 1H chemical shifts were referenced using p-dioxane (δ = 3.75 ppm) as internal standard (25De Marco A. J. Magn.

NMR-monitored Peptide Titrations—Peptide ligands were weighed and dissolved in H2O, and pH was adjusted to 7.0. Because of a lower solubility of CTT at pH 7.0, titration of col-123 with this ligand was also performed at pH 8.0. The concentration of col-123 was determined spectrophotometrically. Small aliquots of the peptide stock solutions were added to samples of 15N-labeled col-123 (0.35 mm in 10:90 (v/v) 2H2O/1H2O, pH 7.0 or pH 8.0). At each step a 1H-15N HSQC experiment was recorded to monitor the ligand-induced resonance shifts. The equilibrium association constants Ka were determined by a combination of linear and non-linear least square fits of the chemical shift versus ligand profile as described previously (34Marti D.N. Hu C.-K. An S.S. von Haller P. Schaller J. Llinás M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11591-11604Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 35An S.S. Marti D.N. Carreño C. Albericio F. Schaller J. Llinás M. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1947-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). CD Spectroscopy of MMP-2 FN2 Modules—The far-UV CD spectra of col-1, col-2, and col-3 were recorded at pH 7.0 and 8.0 (Fig. 2, a, b, and c). Qualitatively little pH-dependent change for any of the traces over this range could be detected. Although each col module exhibited a unique CD trace, the positive lobe centered at ∼225 nm afforded a generic characteristic of FN2 domains. This broad peak is likely to stem from the Trp, Tyr, and Phe aromatic side chain dichroic contributions to the spectrum known to be of positive sign and to appear within the 220–226-nm range (36Krittanai C. Johnson W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Since aromatic side chain components are neglected in both the CDsstr version 1.8 (37Johnson W.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1999; 35: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) and Selcon3 (38Sreerama N. Venyaminov S.Y. Woody R.W. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) basis sets, it is not surprising that neither algorithm is able to quantitatively assess the col domain secondary structure content from the CD data. However, despite this short-coming, the CD spectrum provides a valuable fingerprint of the FN2 global fold. To gauge the extent to which the three MMP-2 FN2 domains are structurally autonomous units, we compared the CD traces of the various col constructs. Far-UV CD spectra of the intandem col-12, col-23, and col-123 were recorded at pH 7.0 (Fig. 2, d, e, and f). It was shown that, after proper normalization, combined spectra of the individual col modules (Fig. 2, a, b, and c) closely reconstruct the spectra of the respective multidomain constructs. The additive property of the col CD traces concurs with the NMR structural data for col-12 (18Gehrmann M. Briknarová K. Bányai L. Patthy L. Llinás M. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 137-147PubMed Google Scholar) and col-23 (17Briknarová K. Gehrmann M. Bányai L. Tordai H. Patthy L. Llinás M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27613-27621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) further bolstering the hypothesis that both the secondary structure and the global fold of each module are essentially unaltered in the constructs with two or three FN2 modules. The temperature-dependent CD amplitudes at 222 nm, CD(T), of col-1, col-2, col-3, col-12, col-23, and col-123 were also recorded at pH 7.0. To facilitate visual comparison of multidomain arrays with single isolated modules, the contributions of both CDN(T) and CDU(T) to the base line of CD(T) were removed (Equation 1). Also, to highlight the phase transition, the first derivatives of the processed data are shown (Fig. 3). For col-1, col-2, and col-3 we extracted values for the thermal un-folding parameters, namely Tm and ΔHvH, via Equations 1 and 2. The three FN2 domains have distinct melting points and enthalpies (Tm ∼ 56.5 °C and ΔHvH ∼ 130 kJ mol–1 for col-1, Tm ∼ 59.0 °C and ΔHvH ∼ 187 kJ mol–1 for col-2, and Tm ∼ 79.7 °C and ΔHvH 255 kJ mol–1 for col-3). The Tm values agree well with those reported earlier, namely ∼57.8, ∼60.8, and ∼82.0 °C for col-1, col-2, and col-3, respectively (39Bányai L. Tordai H. Patthy L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12003-12008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 40Tórdai H. Patthy L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For the multi-col arrays, the temperature-dependent CD trace was modeled as combinations of independent thermal transitions, two in the case of col-12 and col-23 and three for col-123. By reference to those of the individual col domains, Tm and ΔHvH values were essentially retained, within the experimental uncertainties, in col-12, col-23, and col-123 (Table I) further supporting the absence of domain-domain interactions among the three FN2 domains. Moreover, the second col repeat did not appear to be stabilized in the col-12 and col-123 constructs as suggested previously (39Bányai L. Tordai H. Patthy L. J. Biol.

The HSQC spectrum of col-123 (Fig. 4) concurs with the spectra of the two-domain constructs, consistent with the hypothesis that the three repeats maintain their individual structural characteristics within col-123 as discussed above. Interaction of col-123 with PPG6—With the aim of characterizing how the three consecutive FN2 modules bind gelatin, the interaction of col-123 with PPG6 was investigated. It was determined that the three domains interact with PPG6 with Ka values of ∼0.39, ∼0.26, and ∼0.12 mm–1 for col-123/1, col-123/2, and col-123/3, respectively (Table II). The binding constant for col-123/1 agrees well with the reported affinities of col-12/1 (Ka ∼ 0.42 mm–1) (18Gehrmann M. Briknarová K. Bányai L. Patthy L. Llinás M. Biol.

However, the association to col-123/2 was somewhat weaker than those measured for the isolated col-2 domain (Ka ∼ 0.36 mm–1), col-12/2 (Ka ∼ 0.38 mm–1), and col-23/2 (Ka ∼ 0.38 mm–1) (16Briknarová K.

The available data, which have not always been gathered under the same conditions for the different proteins, suggest (but do not prove) that the long flavodoxins could display a more complex equilibrium and folding behavior than the short ones. Here we compare the chemical and thermal stability of a well folded shortened apoflavodoxin (Δ(120–139) lacking the long loop) with that of the full-length Anabaena wild type one and show that the loop is essential for the formation of the previously characterized equilibrium intermediate of the thermal unfolding (8Irun M.P. Garcia-Mira M.M. Sánchez-Ruiz J.M. Sancho J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, we find that the loop is also related to the occurrence of the kinetic intermediate observed in the folding of the wild type protein (21Fernández-Recio J. Genzor C.G. Sancho J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15234-15245Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, the loop adds complexity to both the equilibrium and the folding behavior of the Anabaena long-chain flavodoxin. Despite these effects, we notice that the shortened protein is almost as stable as the full-length one, which means that the loop plays no significant role in the stabilization of the long-chain apoflavodoxin. The fact that the loop is neither required for a proper folding of the protein (36López-Llano J. Maldonado S. Bueno M. Lostao A. Ángeles-Jiménez M. Lillo M.P. Sancho J. J. Biol.

Site-directed Mutagenesis: Protein Expression; Purification; and Quantitation—The methods used to prepare and quantify the shortened apoflavodoxins studied in this work are described by us (36López-Llano J.

The Δ(119–139)-shortened variant is close to being natively folded but is somewhat expanded. The Δ(120–139) variant is natively folded. In the two variants, the 5a and 5b β-strands have been spliced and the characteristic long loop of long-chain flavodoxins has thus been removed. The stability of the shortened variants (that lack the Trp120 residue, important for the fluorescence and CD spectroscopic properties of wild type apoflavodoxin) is compared with that of the W120F Anabaena flavodoxin single mutant throughout this work. The W120F mutant is termed pseudo wild type (pWT). 1The abbreviations used are: pWT, pseudo wild type; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; ANOVA, analysis of variance. Urea Denaturation—Denaturing samples of different urea concentrations were prepared in 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Unfolding curves were obtained from the fluorescence emission of the samples at 320 nm (excitation at 280 nm) and from circular dichroism at 222 nm. The data were analyzed assuming a two-state equilibrium and a linear relationship between free energy and urea concentration (24Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Thomson J.A. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 311-330Google Scholar) using Equation 1,S=(SF+mFD)+(SU+mUD)e−(ΔGw−mD)/RT1+e−(ΔGw−mD)/RT(Eq. 1) where S is the observed signal, SF and SU are the signals of the folded and unfolded states (mF and mU are slopes that describe their dependences with denaturant concentration), ΔGw is the Gibbs energy difference between the folded and unfolded states in the absence of denaturant, D is the concentration of denaturant (urea), and m the slope of the linear dependence of ΔG on D. Thermal Denaturation—Thermal unfolding was followed by fluorescence emission (320/360 nm ratio; excitation at 280 nm) and by CD at 222 and 291 nm. The temperature was increased from 277.2 to 358.2 K at ∼1 K/min in a sealed cuvette and was measured with a thermocouple immersed in the cuvette. The buffer was 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, or, when indicated, 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0. The unfolding curves were analyzed using Equation 2 (25Privalov P.L. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1979; 33: 167-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar, 26Privalov P.L. Potekhin S.A.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) Measurements—DSC was performed using a DASM-4 microcalorimeter with digital control (cell volume 0.47 ml) at heating rates from 0.5 to 2 K/min and protein concentration in the range of 1.0–4.0 mg/ml. An extra pressure of 1.5 atm was maintained to prevent degassing of the solutions on heating. Each sample was extensively dialyzed against the buffer before measurement. The instrumental base line was routinely recorded before or after each experiment with both cells filled with buffer and was subtracted from the scan obtained with the sample. Reversibility of the unfolding was checked by sample reheating after cooling inside the calorimetric cell and by the independence of the thermograms on the scan rate. The analysis of DSC data was performed as described previously (27Beldarrain A. Lopez-Lacomba J.L. Furrazola G. Barberia D. Cortijo M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7865-7873Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) using Equation 3,Cp=Cpin+Cpex=ΔH2KeqRT2(1+Keq)2+Cp,0+Keq1+KeqΔCp(Eq. 3) where Cpin is the chemical or “internal” heat capacity of the protein in solution, Cpex is the excess heat capacity of the unfolding reaction, Cp,0 is the heat capacity of the protein in the native state, and ΔCp is the overall heat capacity change during the denaturation reaction. The values of ΔG°(T), ΔH(T), and ΔS(T) for the reversible two-state transition were calculated using Equations 4, 5, 6,ΔH(T)=ΔH(Tm)+ΔCp(T−Tm)(Eq. 4) ΔS(T)=ΔH(Tm)/Tm+ΔCPln(T−Tm)(Eq. 5) ΔG°(T)=ΔH(T)−TΔS(T)(Eq. 6) where Tm is the mid-denaturation temperature, and ΔCp was assumed to be independent of temperature. Some of the experiments were additionally performed using a VP-DSC calorimeter from Microcal (Northhampton, MA) and were analyzed assuming a linear dependence of the heat capacities of the native and unfolded states. Stopped-flow Kinetics of Unfolding and Refolding—Stopped-flow kinetics of Δ(120–139) urea unfolding and refolding were carried out in an Applied Photophysics stopped-flow instrument. In the unfolding experiments, one volume of the protein (22 μm in 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) was mixed with 10 volumes of denaturant (urea at different concentrations in 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0). In the refolding experiments, one volume of the protein (22 μm in 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, containing urea 4 m) was mixed with 10 volumes of urea at different concentrations in the same buffer. The time dependence of the change in fluorescence emission at wavelength >335 nm was recorded after excitation at 280 nm. Experimental relaxation rates and amplitudes were globally fitted as described for wild-type apoflavodoxin (21Fernández-Recio J. Genzor C.G. Sancho J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15234-15245Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) to the equations derived for all of the possible kinetic models of a three-state system. Statistical Analysis—To determine the statistical significance of the differences observed among the proteins studied, the equilibrium unfolding data were analyzed by paired Student's t tests, ANOVA, MANOVA, and correlation procedures using SPSS for Windows, release 10.0.6. Equilibrium Urea Denaturation of Δ(119–139)- and Δ(120–139)-shortened Apoflavodoxins—The conformational stability of Δ(119–139) and Δ(120–139) has been determined by urea denaturation monitored by fluorescence and far-UV CD. Both shortened flavodoxins refold after unfolding in a fully reversible manner (data not shown). In addition, the unfolding equilibrium is protein concentration-independent in the 1–10 μm range and shows the same urea dependence when monitored by fluorescence or by far-UV CD (see Fig. 1), which strongly suggests that it is a two-state process. The unfolding curves have thus been fitted to Equation 1, and the parameters obtained (ΔGw, m and U½) are reported in Table I. The two shortened apoflavodoxins have significantly different ΔGw values, and they are only slightly (although statistically significantly) less stable than the pWT protein (by ∼3.0 and 5.5 kJ mol-1). The m-slope values of the shortened apoflavodoxins are significantly smaller than those of pWT, as it is expected for smaller proteins since the m-values are related with the amount of protein surface exposed to solvent upon unfolding. The slightly expanded Δ(119–139) variant unfolds at a lower urea concentration, and therefore, it is less stable than the natively folded Δ(120–139) (see López-Llano et al. (36López-Llano J.

In addition, the thermal unfolding of Δ(120–139) has also been studied by near-UV absorbance and near-UV CD (Fig. 2B). Two different buffer conditions have been used: 5 mm sodium phosphate and 50 mm MOPS. The unfolding curves have been fitted to a two-state model (Equation 2) to obtain Tm and ΔH(Tm) values that are reported in Table II. Spectroscopically determined ΔCp values usually display large errors (24Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Thomson J.A. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 311-330Google Scholar) and are not reported. The thermal denaturation of the pWT protein, previously analyzed in 50 mm MOPS buffer (8Irun M.P. Garcia-Mira M.M. Sánchez-Ruiz J.M. Sancho J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 9Irun M.P. Maldonado S. Sancho J. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), has now been analyzed in 5 mm sodium phosphate to compare its stability with that of the shortened apoflavodoxins (Table II). For each of the three proteins, there are not statistically significant differences among the Tm and ΔH values obtained with the different techniques used, which implies that each protein unfolds in a two-state manner in 5 mm phosphate buffer. In addition, there is not statistically significant differences between the temperature of mid-denaturation and the unfolding enthalpies of the natively folded Δ(120–139) and of pWT, whereas Δ(119–139) is significantly less stable (as previously observed in urea denaturation). We notice that the two-state unfolding of pWT in 5 mm phosphate buffer is in contrast with the three-state unfolding in 50 mm MOPS shown by pWT (8Irun M.P. Garcia-Mira M.M. Sánchez-Ruiz J.M. Sancho J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and by over 30 full-length apoflavodoxin mutants previously analyzed in the laboratory (data not shown). To investigate a possible role of the long loop in the accumulation of the thermal intermediate that is observed in MOPS buffer for the wild type protein, we have determined the thermal unfolding curves of natively folded Δ(120–139) in 50 mm MOPS. In addition, we have reexamined the unfolding of the pWT in MOPS buffer. Our data indicate (Table II) that the unfolding of the shortened protein in 50 mm MOPS buffer is also two-state and confirms our previous report that, in contrast, the pWT thermal unfolding in this buffer is three-state as shown by the significantly different Tm (p < 0.05) values obtained from the near-UV CD curve compared with the Tm values derived from the other techniques (we notice that the near-UV CD and the absorbance curves are obtained simultaneously from a single unfolding experiment). The long differentiating flavodoxin loop, absent in Δ(120–139), is thus essential for the accumulation of the apoflavodoxin thermal intermediate.Fig. 3Thermal denaturation of Δ(119–139) apoflavodoxin in 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, followed by fluorescence (ratio of emission intensities 320/360 nm; excitation at 280 nm; open circles) and far-UV CD at 222 nm (open squares).

https://openalex.org/W2039820403,"This is the first report that describes the inhibition mechanism of xylanase from Thermomonospora sp. by pepstatin A, a specific inhibitor toward aspartic proteases. The kinetic analysis revealed competitive inhibition of xylanase by pepstatin A with an IC50 value 3.6 ± 0.5 μm. The progress curves were time-depended, consistent with a two-step slow tight binding inhibition. The inhibition followed a rapid equilibrium step to form a reversible enzyme-inhibitor complex (EI), which isomerizes to the second enzyme-inhibitor complex (EI*), which dissociated at a very slow rate. The rate constants determined for the isomerization of EI to EI* and the dissociation of EI* were 15 ± 1 × 10-5 and 3.0 ± 1 × 10-8 s-1, respectively. The Ki value for the formation of EI complex was 1.5 ± 0.5 μm, whereas the overall inhibition constant Ki* was 28.0 ± 1 nm. The conformational changes induced in Xyl I by pepstatin A were monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy, and the rate constants derived were in agreement with the kinetic data. Thus, the conformational alterations were correlated to the isomerization of EI to EI*. Pepstatin A binds to the active site of the enzyme and disturbs the native interaction between the histidine and lysine, as demonstrated by the abolished isoindole fluorescence of o-phthalaldehyde-labeled xylanase. Our results revealed that the inactivation of xylanase is due to the interference in the electronic microenvironment and disruption of the hydrogen-bonding network between the essential histidine and other residues involved in catalysis, and a model depicting the probable interaction between pepstatin A with xylanase has been proposed.

In recent years considerable research efforts have been expended in the design and synthesis of glycosidase inhibitors not only to understand about the active site structures and mechanisms of these interesting enzymes but also in generating new therapeutic agents. Specific inhibitors of glycosidases have proved valuable in a number of applications ranging from mechanistic studies (1Legler G. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1990; 48: 319-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 2Sinnot M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1497) Google Scholar) to possible therapeutic uses such as viral infectivity through interference with normal glycosylation of coat proteins (3Elbein A.D. Legler G. Trusty A. McDowell W. Schwarz R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 235: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), against cancer, bacterial infections, and as insecticides (4Leroy E. Reymond J.-L. Org. Lett. 1999; 1: 775-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Glycosidase inhibitors as therapeutics has been highlighted in recent years with the successful marketing of the α-amylase inhibitor acarbose for the control of blood glucose levels and of the sialidase inhibitor relenza as a treatment for influenza. Acarbose is one of the new classes of oral α-glucosidase inhibitors used in the treatment type II diabetes. It is a linear tetrasaccharide of α-d-glucose residues modified at the non-reducing end. The non-reducing end group saccharide residue has a nitrogen replacing the interglycosidic oxygen atom and a double bond between C-4 and C-5 positions (5Truscheit E. Frommer W. Junge B. Muller L. Schimdt D.D. Wingender W. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1981; 20: 744-761Crossref Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Relenza (4-guanidino-2,4-dideoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid; Zanamivir) is a potent and highly specific sialidase inhibitor with inhibitory activity in vivo against both influenza A and B viruses (6Fenton R.J. Morley P.J. Owens I.J. Gower D. Parry S. Crossman L. Wong T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 2642-2647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Xylanases (1,4-β-d-xylan xylanohydrolase) are glycosidases that catalyze the hydrolytic cleavage of β-1,4-linked polymers of d-xylose (7Biely P. Trends Biotechnol. 1985; 3: 286-290Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (809) Google Scholar). They have raised enormous interest in the past decade in view of their application in clarification of juices and wines, conversion of renewable biomass into liquid fuels, and in development of environmentally sound prebleaching processes in the paper and pulp industry (8Kulkarni N. Shendye A. Rao M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 23: 411-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although extensive studies have been carried out on the industrial applications of xylanases, there is a paucity of reports on their molecular enzymology and clinical implications. Recently, glycosidases have been studied with a clinical perspective of locating enzyme-allergens (9Tarvainen K. Keskinen H. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1991; 21: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Some of these enzymes including xylanases and cellulases have been found to cause occupational and non-occupational allergies, such as respiratory and irritant contact dermatitis. Therefore, from the biomedical point of view inhibitors of this class of enzymes will have tremendous importance in near future. In addition, inhibition of cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes have potential applications to prevent the degradation of wood and cloth by the action of the hydrolytic enzymes present in the gut of the termites. The three-dimensional structures of family 10 xylanases (10Harris G.W. Jenkins N.A. Connerton I. Cummings N. Lo Leggio L. Scott M. Hazlewood G.P. Laurie J.I. Gilbert H.J. Pickersgill R.W.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12546-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) have revealed the extended substrate binding cleft in which the surface residues are linked by an extensive hydrogen bond network. The clefts form deep grooves, consistent with their endo-mode action, and comprise a series of subsites, each one capable of binding a xylose moiety (12Davies G.J. Wilson K. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). The active site of xylanase contains two essential catalytic groups, one playing the role of acid/base and the other functioning as a nucleophile (13Royers J.C. Nakas J.P. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1989; 11: 405-410Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These two groups have been identified as carboxyl groups, and a covalent intermediate is formed that undergoes hydrolysis to afford hemiacetal with net retention of anomeric stereochemistry (14Ly H.D. Withers S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 316: 695-696Google Scholar). The transition states leading to and from the covalent intermediate have substantial oxacarbonium ion character, as indicated by kinetic isotope effects and by the effects of electron-withdrawing substituents on the sugar ring upon reaction rate (15White A. Tull D. Johns K. Withers S.G. Rose D.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Analysis of active site amino acids that play an important role in substrate binding and in catalysis has been greatly facilitated by solving the crystal structure of family 10 xylanases covalently linked to mechanism-based cellobiosyl (2-deoxy-2-fluorocellobiosyl) and xylobiosyl (2-deoxy-2-fluoroxylobiosyl) inhibitors (15White A. Tull D. Johns K. Withers S.G. Rose D.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the details of the hydrolytic mechanism of glycosidases, specific inhibitors are necessary that can act as mechanistic and structural probes. A diverse array of extremely potent, basic nitrogen-containing inhibitors has been developed over the years, and they have been found to be of great utility in the study of the glycosidase mechanism (7Biely P. Trends Biotechnol. 1985; 3: 286-290Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 16Stutz A.E. Immunosugars as Glycosidase Inhibitors: Nojirimycin and Beyond. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany1999: 95-120Google Scholar). However, there have been very few reports of naturally occurring inhibitors of xylanases. Pepstatin is a naturally occurring low molecular weight potent inhibitor specific for aspartic proteases (17Umezawa H. Aoyagi T. Morishima H. Hamed M. Takeuchi T. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1970; 23: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). The unusual potency of pepstatin toward aspartic proteases has been widely exploited as a research tool for unraveling the mechanism of this group of enzymes (18Sachdev G.P. Brownstein A.D. Fruton J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6292-6299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), its biological functions (19Barrett A.J. Dingle J.T. Biochem. J. 1972; 127: 439-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and in affinity chromatography (20Murakami K. Inagami T. Michelakis A.M. Cohen S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

It also has been tested as a therapeutic agent for experimental control of gastric ulcer (17Umezawa H. Aoyagi T. Morishima H. Hamed M. Takeuchi T. J. Antibiot.

FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To our knowledge there are no reports of pepstatin inhibition on xylanolytic enzymes. In this paper we present slow-tight binding inhibition of the thermostable xylanase (Xyl I) 1The abbreviations used are: Xyl I, xylanase from Thermomonospora sp.; IC50, 50% inhibitory concentration; OPTA, o-phthalaldehyde. from a Thermomonospora sp. by a specific aspartic protease inhibitor, pepstatin A. The steady-state kinetics revealed a two-step inhibition mechanism, and the conformational modes observed during the binding of inhibitor to the enzyme were conveniently monitored by fluorescence analysis. The mechanism of inactivation of Xyl I by pepstatin A was delineated by monitoring the isoindole fluorescence of the o-phthalaldehyde (OPTA)-labeled enzyme and a model for the probable interactions have been proposed. Materials—Oat spelled xylan, dinitrosalicylic acid, pepstatin A, and o-phthalaldehyde (OPTA) were obtained from Sigma. Sephadex A-50 and Sephacryl S-200 were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals used were of analytical grade. Microorganisms Growth Condition and Purification of Xyl I—Thermomonospora sp. producing Xyl I is an alkalothermophilic actinomycete having optimum growth at pH 9 and 50 °C. It was isolated from self-heating compost from the Barabanki district of Uttar Pradesh, India (26George S.P. Ahmad A. Rao M. Bioresour. Technol. 2001; 77: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The Thermomonospora sp. was grown at 50 °C for 96 h for the production of Xyl I. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity from the extracellular culture filtrate by fractional ammonium sulfate precipitation (35–55%), DEAE-Sephadex ion exchange chromatography, and Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration chromatography (27George S.P. Ahmad A. Rao M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Xylanase Assay and Inhibition Kinetics—Xylanase assay was carried out in phosphate buffer, 0.05 m, pH 6.0, by mixing a specified concentration of the enzyme with 0.5 ml of oat spelled xylan (10 mg/ml) in a reaction mixture of 1 ml and incubating at 50 °C for 30 min. The reducing sugar released was determined by the dinitrosalicylic acid method (28Miller G.L. Anal. Chem. 1959; 31: 426-428Crossref Scopus (22569) Google Scholar). One unit of xylanase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that produced 1 μmol of xylose equivalent per min using oat-spelled xylan as the substrate under assay conditions. Protein concentration was determined according to the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. For initial kinetic analysis the kinetic parameters for the substrate hydrolysis were determined by measuring the initial rate of enzymatic activity. The inhibition constant (Ki) was determined by Dixon method (30Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar) and also by the Lineweaver-Burk equation. The Km value was also calculated from the double-reciprocal equation by fitting the data into the computer software Microcal Origin. For the Lineweaver-Burk analysis Xyl I (2 μm) was incubated with pepstatin A at (1 μm) and (2 μm) and assayed at increased concentrations of xylan (1–10 mg/ml) at 50 °C for 30 min. The reciprocals of substrate hydrolysis (1/v) for each inhibitor concentration were plotted against the reciprocals of the substrate concentrations and the Ki was determined by fitting the resulting data. In Dixon's method (30Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar), xylanolytic activity of Xyl I (2 μm) was measured in the presence of 5 and 10 mg/ml xylan at concentrations of pepstatin A ranging from 0 to 7 μm at 50 °C for 30 min. The reciprocals of substrate hydrolysis (1/v) were plotted against the inhibitor concentration, and the Ki was determined by fitting the data using Microcal Origin. For the progress curve analysis assays were carried out in a reaction mixture of 1 ml containing enzyme, substrate, and inhibitor at various concentrations. The reaction mixture contained Xyl I (50 nm) in sodium phosphate buffer, 0.05 m, pH 6.0, and varying concentrations of pepstatin A (0.3–3 μm) and xylan (10 mg/ml). The reaction was initiated by the addition of Xyl I at 50 °C, and the release of products was monitored at different time intervals by estimating the reducing sugar at 540 nm. In each slow binding inhibition experiment, five to six assays were performed with appropriate blanks. For the kinetic analysis and rate constant determinations, the assays were carried out in triplicate, and the average value was considered throughout. Further details of the experiments are given in the respective figure legends. Evaluation of Kinetic Parameters—Initial rate studies for reversible; competitive inhibition was analyzed according to Equation 1,υ=VmaxSKm(1+I/Ki)+S(Eq. 1) where Km is the Michaelis constant, Vmax is the maximal catalytic rate at saturating substrate concentration S, Ki = (k4/k3) is the dissociation constant for the first reversible enzyme-inhibitor complex, and I is the inhibitor concentration (31Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). The progress curves for the interactions between pepstatin A and Xyl I were analyzed using Equation 2 (32Beith J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 59-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 33Morrison J.F. Stone S.R. Comments Mol. Cell. Biophys. 1985; 2: 347-368Google Scholar),[P]=υst+υ0−υsk(1−e−kt)(Eq. 2) where [P] is the product concentration at any time t, v0 and vs are the initial and final steady-state rates, respectively, and k is the apparent first-order rate constant for the establishment of the final steady-state equilibrium. As a prerequisite for tight binding inhibitors, corrections have been made for the reduction in the inhibitor concentration that occurs on formation of the enzyme inhibitor (EI) complex. This is because in the case of tight binding inhibition, the concentration of EI is not negligible in comparison to the inhibitor concentration, and the free inhibitor concentration is not equal to the added concentration of the inhibitor. The corrections of the variation of the steady-state velocity with the inhibitor concentrations were made according to Equation 3 and 4 as described by Morrison and Walsh (34Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 62: 201-302Google Scholar),υs=k7SQ2(Km+S)(Eq. 3) Q=[(Ki+It−Et)+4Ki'Et]1/2−(Ki'+It−Et)(Eq. 4) where Ki′ = Ki*(1 + S/Km), k7 rate constant for the product formation, It, and Et stands for total inhibitor and enzyme concentration, respectively. The relationship between the rate constant of enzymatic reaction k, and the kinetic constants for the association and dissociation of the enzyme and inhibitor was determined as per Equation 5.k=k6+k5[I/Ki1+(S/Km)+(I/Ki)](Eq. 5) The progress curves were analyzed by Equations 2 and 5 using nonlinear least-square parameter minimization to determine the best-fit values with the corrections for the tight binding inhibition. The overall inhibition constant is determined as given by Equation 6.Ki∗=[E][I][EI]+[EI∗]=Ki[k6k5+k6](Eq. 6) For the time-dependent inhibition, there exists a time range in the progress curves wherein formation of EI* is small. Within this time range, it is possible to directly measure the effect of the inhibitor on v0, i.e. to measure Ki directly. Values for Ki were obtained from Dixon analysis at a constant substrate concentration as described in Equation 7.1υ=1Vmax+KmVmaxS(1+I/Ki)(Eq. 7) The rate constant k6 for the dissociation of the second enzyme-inhibitor complex was measured directly from the time-dependent inhibition. Concentrated Xyl I and pepstatin A were incubated in a reaction mixture to reach equilibrium followed by large dilutions in assay mixtures containing near-saturating substrate. Xyl I (2 mm) was preincubated with equimolar concentrations of pepstatin A for 120 min in sodium phosphate buffer, 0.05 m, pH 6.0. 5 μl of the preincubated sample was removed and diluted 5000-fold in the same buffer and assayed at 50 °C using xylan at (150 mg/ml) at different time intervals. Fluorescence Analysis—Fluorescence measurements were performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50 luminescence spectrometer connected to a Julabo F20 water bath. Protein fluorescence was excited at 295 nm, and the emission was recorded from 300–400 nm at 25 °C. The slit widths on both the excitation and emission were set at 5 nm, and the spectra were obtained at 100 nm/min. For inhibitor binding studies, Xyl I (2 μm) was dissolved in sodium phosphate buffer, 0.05 m, pH 6.0. Titration of the enzyme with pepstatin A was performed by the addition of different concentrations of the inhibitor to a fixed concentration of enzyme solution. For each inhibitor concentration on the titration curve a new enzyme solution was used. All the data on the titration curve were corrected for dilutions, and the graphs were smoothened. The magnitude of the rapid fluorescence decrease (F0- F) occurring at each Pepstatin A concentration was computer-fitted to Equation 8 to determine the calculated value of Ki and ΔFmax (35Houtzager V. Oullet M. Falgueyret J.-P. Passmore L.A. Bayly C. Percival M.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10974-10984Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).(F0−F)=ΔFmax/{1+(Ki/[I])}(Eq. 8) The first order rate constants for the slow loss of fluorescence kobs, at each inhibitor concentration [I] were computer fitted to the Equation 9 (31Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar) for the determination of k5 under the assumption that for a tight binding inhibitor, k6 can be considered negligible at the onset of the slow loss of fluorescence.kobs=k5[I]/{Ki+[I]}(Eq. 9) Time course of the protein fluorescence after the addition of inhibitor was measured for 300 s with excitation and emission wavelengths fixed at 295 and 340 nm, respectively, with data acquisition at 0.1-s intervals. Corrections for the inner filter effect were performed as described by Equation 10 (36Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 180-195Google Scholar),Fc=F antilog[(Acx+Acm)/2](Eq. 10) where Fc and F stand for the corrected and measured fluorescence intensities, respectively, and Aex and Aem are the absorbances of the solution at the excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. Background buffer spectra were subtracted to remove the contribution from Raman scattering. Effect of Pepstatin A on the Isoindole Fluorescence of OPTA-labeled Xyl I—Fresh OPTA solution was prepared in methanol for each experiment. The modification was carried out by incubating Xyl I (2 μm) in 1 ml of 0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6, with 50 μm OPTA at 25 °C. Methanol had no effect on the activity of the enzyme and was always less than 2% (v/v). The formation of Xyl I-isoindole derivative was followed spectrofluorometrically by monitoring the increase in fluorescence with the excitation wavelength fixed at 330 nm. To monitor the effect of pepstatin A on the isoindole fluorescence of Xyl I, the enzyme was preincubated with pepstatin A (2 μm) for 20 min, and then OPTA was added, and the formation of isoindole derivative was monitored as described above. Kinetic Analysis of the Inhibition of Xyl I—The aspartic protease inhibitor (pepstatin A) was well documented for its inhibitory activity toward pepsin, renin, cathepsin D, and human immunodeficiency virus 1 protease (37Marciniszyn Jr., J.

Gurtler L. Eberle J. Deinhardt F. FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The bifunctional nature of pepstatin A was established by its potency toward Xyl I, the xylanase purified from the Thermomonospora sp. Xyl I, a member of family 10 xylanase, is highly thermostable with half-lives of 86, 30, and 15 min at 80, 90, and 100 °C, respectively, and is stable in an expansive pH range of 5–10 with more than 75% residual activity. Initial kinetic assessments revealed that pepstatin A is a competitive inhibitor of Xyl I with an IC50 value of 3.6 ± 0.5 μm (Fig. 1). In the absence of pepstatin A, the steady-state rate of xylanolytic activity of Xyl I was reached rapidly, whereas in its presence a time-dependent decrease in the rate as a function of the inhibitor concentration was observed. Examination of the progress curves revealed a time range where the initial rate of reaction did not deviate from linearity (Fig. 2), and the conversion of EI to EI* was minimal. For a low concentration of pepstatin A this time range was 10 min, within which classical competitive inhibition experiments was used to determine the Ki values (Equation 5). The value of the inhibition rate constant Ki, associated with the formation of the reversible enzyme-inhibitor complex (EI) determined from the fits of data to the reciprocal equation, was 1.5 ± 0.5 μm (Fig. 3A), which was corroborated by the Dixon method (Fig. 3B). The apparent rate constant k, derived from the progress curves when plotted versus the inhibitor concentration, followed a hyperbolic function (Fig. 4), revealing that a fast equilibrium precedes the formation of the final slow dissociating enzyme-inhibitor complex (EI*), indicating a two-step, slow-tight inhibition mechanism (Scheme I). Indeed, the data could be fitted to Equation 5 by non-linear regression analysis, which yielded the best estimate of the overall inhibition constant Ki* of 28.0 ± 1 nm.Fig. 2Time course of inhibition of Xyl I by pepstatin A. The reaction mixture contained Xyl I (50 nm) in sodium-phosphate buffer, 0.05 m, pH 6.0, and varying concentrations of pepstatin A and xylan (10 mg/ml). Reaction was initiated by the addition of Xyl I at 50 °C. The points represent the hydrolysis of substrate as a function of time, and the lines indicate the best fits of data obtained from Equations 2 and 5, with the corrections made as per Equations 3 and 4. Concentrations of pepstatin A were 0.365 μm (▪), 0.73 μm (•), 1.1 μm (▴), 1.5 μm (▾), and 3 μm (♦).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Initial rate of enzymatic reaction of Xyl I in the presence of pepstatin A. A, enzymatic activity of Xyl I was estimated using oat-spelled xylan in sodium-phosphate buffer, 0.05 m, pH 6.0, and the xylose equivalent was determined at 540 nm. Xyl I (2 μm) was incubated without (▪) or with the inhibitor at 1 μm (•) and 2 μm (▴) and assayed at an increased concentration of xylan (1–10 mg/ml) at 50 °C for 30 min. The reciprocal of substrate hydrolysis (1/v) for each inhibitor concentration was plotted against the reciprocal of the substrate concentration. B, xylanase (2 μm) was assayed using xylan at 5 mg/ml (•) and 10 mg/ml (▪) with increasing concentrations of pepstatin A at 50 °C for 30 min. The reciprocal of substrate hydrolysis (1/v) was plotted against inhibitor concentration. The straight lines indicated the best fits for the data obtained by non-linear regression analysis and analyzed by Lineweaver-Burk reciprocal equation (A) and the Dixon method (B), respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 4Dependence of Xyl I inhibition on pepstatin A concentration. The rate constants k were calculated from the progress curves recorded after the addition of Xyl I to the reaction mixture containing xylan and pepstatin A. The solid line indicates the best fit of the data obtained.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In an alternative method, the rate constant k6, for the conversion of EI* to EI, was determined by preincubating high concentrations of enzyme and inhibitor for sufficient time to allow the system to reach equilibrium. Dilution of the enzyme-inhibitor complex into a relatively large volume of assay mixture containing saturating substrate concentration causes dissociation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex and, thus, regeneration of enzymatic activity. Under these conditions, v0 and the effective inhibitor concentration can be considered approximately equal to 0, and the rate of activity regeneration will provide the k6 value. After preincubating Xyl I with pepstatin A, the enzyme inhibitor mixture was diluted 5000-fold into the assay mixture containing the substrate at 50 Km. By least-squares minimization of Equation 2 to the data for recovery of enzymatic activity, the determined k6 value was 3.0 ± 1 × 10-8 s-1 (Fig. 5), which clearly indicated a very slow dissociation of EI*. The final steady-state rate vS was determined from the control that was preincubated without the inhibitor. The value of the rate constant k5, associated with the isomerization of EI to EI*, was 15 ± 1 × 10-5 s-1, as obtained from fits of Equation 3 to the onset of inhibition data using the experimentally determined values of Ki and k6 (Table I). The overall inhibition constant Ki* is a function of k6/(k5 + k6) and is equal to the product of Ki and this function. The k6 value indicated a slower rate of dissociation of EI* complex and the half-life t½, for the reactivation of EI* as determined from k6 values was 64 ± 2 × 102 h, suggesting higher binding affinity of pepstatin A toward Xyl I. Where E stands for free enzyme, I is free inhibitor, EI is a rapidly forming preequilibrium complex, and EI* is the final enzyme-inhibitor complex. E may undergo inter-conversion into another form, E*, which bind"
