https://openalex.org/W3004731690,"The neuromodulator melatonin synchronizes circadian rhythms and related physiological functions through the actions of two G-protein-coupled receptors: MT1 and MT2. Circadian release of melatonin at night from the pineal gland activates melatonin receptors in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, synchronizing the physiology and behaviour of animals to the light-dark cycle1-4. The two receptors are established drug targets for aligning circadian phase to this cycle in disorders of sleep5,6 and depression1-4,7-9. Despite their importance, few in vivo active MT1-selective ligands have been reported2,8,10-12, hampering both the understanding of circadian biology and the development of targeted therapeutics. Here we docked more than 150 million virtual molecules to an MT1 crystal structure, prioritizing structural fit and chemical novelty. Of these compounds, 38 high-ranking molecules were synthesized and tested, revealing ligands with potencies ranging from 470 picomolar to 6 micromolar. Structure-based optimization led to two selective MT1 inverse agonists-which were topologically unrelated to previously explored chemotypes-that acted as inverse agonists in a mouse model of circadian re-entrainment. Notably, we found that these MT1-selective inverse agonists advanced the phase of the mouse circadian clock by 1.3-1.5 h when given at subjective dusk, an agonist-like effect that was eliminated in MT1- but not in MT2-knockout mice. This study illustrates the opportunities for modulating melatonin receptor biology through MT1-selective ligands and for the discovery of previously undescribed, in vivo active chemotypes from structure-based screens of diverse, ultralarge libraries."
https://openalex.org/W3004425213,"There is an increasing imperative for psychologists and other behavioral scientists to understand how people behave on social media. However, it is often very difficult to execute experimental research on actual social media platforms, or to link survey responses to online behavior in order to perform correlational analyses. Thus, there is a natural desire to use self-reported behavioral intentions in standard survey studies to gain insight into online behavior. But are such hypothetical responses hopelessly disconnected from actual sharing decisions? Or are online survey samples via sources such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) so different from the average social media user that the survey responses of one group give little insight into the on-platform behavior of the other? Here we investigate these issues by examining 67 pieces of political news content. We evaluate whether there is a meaningful relationship between (i) the level of sharing (tweets and retweets) of a given piece of content on Twitter, and (ii) the extent to which individuals (total N = 993) in online surveys on MTurk reported being willing to share that same piece of content. We found that the same news headlines that were more likely to be hypothetically shared on MTurk were also shared more frequently by Twitter users, r = .44. For example, across the observed range of MTurk sharing fractions, a 20 percentage point increase in the fraction of MTurk participants who reported being willing to share a news headline on social media was associated with 10x as many actual shares on Twitter. We also found that the correlation between sharing and various features of the headline was similar using both MTurk and Twitter data. These findings suggest that self-reported sharing intentions collected in online surveys are likely to provide some meaningful insight into what content would actually be shared on social media."
https://openalex.org/W3006598587,"The objective investigation of the dynamic properties of vocal fold vibrations demands the recording and further quantitative analysis of laryngeal high-speed video (HSV). Quantification of the vocal fold vibration patterns requires as a first step the segmentation of the glottal area within each video frame from which the vibrating edges of the vocal folds are usually derived. Consequently, the outcome of any further vibration analysis depends on the quality of this initial segmentation process. In this work we propose for the first time a procedure to fully automatically segment not only the time-varying glottal area but also the vocal fold tissue directly from laryngeal high-speed video (HSV) using a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach. Eighteen different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) network configurations were trained and evaluated on totally 13,000 high-speed video (HSV) frames obtained from 56 healthy and 74 pathologic subjects. The segmentation quality of the best performing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells to take also the temporal context into account, was intensely investigated on 15 test video sequences comprising 100 consecutive images each. As performance measures the Dice Coefficient (DC) as well as the precisions of four anatomical landmark positions were used. Over all test data a mean Dice Coefficient (DC) of 0.85 was obtained for the glottis and 0.91 and 0.90 for the right and left vocal fold (VF) respectively. The grand average precision of the identified landmarks amounts 2.2 pixels and is in the same range as comparable manual expert segmentations which can be regarded as Gold Standard. The method proposed here requires no user interaction and overcomes the limitations of current semiautomatic or computational expensive approaches. Thus, it allows also for the analysis of long high-speed video (HSV)-sequences and holds the promise to facilitate the objective analysis of vocal fold vibrations in clinical routine. The here used dataset including the ground truth will be provided freely for all scientific groups to allow a quantitative benchmarking of segmentation approaches in future."
https://openalex.org/W3006425563,"The rapid scale-up of HIV therapy across Africa has failed to adequately engage adolescents living with HIV (ALWHIV). Retention and viral suppression for this group (ALWHIV) is 50% lower than for adults. Indeed, on the African continent, HIV remains the single leading cause of mortality among adolescents. Strategies tailored to the unqiue developmental and social vulnerabilities of this group are urgently needed to enhance successful treatment.We carried out a five-year longitudinal cluster randomized trial (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01790373) with adolescents living with HIV (ALWHIV) ages 10 to 16 years clustered at health care clinics to test the effect of a family economic empowerment (EE) intervention on viral suppression in five districuts in Uganda. In total, 39 accredited health care clinics from study districts with existing procedures tailored to adolescent adherence were eligible to participate in the trial. We used data from 288 youth with detectable HIV viral loads (VL) at baseline (158 -intervention group from 20 clinics, 130 -non-intervention group from 19 clinics). The primary end point was undetectable plasma HIV RNA levels, defined as < 40 copies/ml. We used Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis and Cox proportional hazard models to estimate intervention effects.The Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis indicated that an incidence of undetectable VL (0.254) was significantly higher in the intervention condition compared to 0.173 (in non-intervention arm) translated into incidence rate ratio of 1.468 (CI: 1.064-2.038), p = 0.008. Cox regression results showed that along with the family-based EE intervention (adj. HR = 1.446, CI: 1.073-1.949, p = 0.015), higher number of medications per day had significant positive effects on the viral suppression (adj.HR = 1.852, CI: 1.275-2.690, p = 0.001).A family economic empowerment intervention improved treatment success for ALWHIV in Uganda. Analyses of cost effectiveness and scalability are needed to advance incorporation of this intervention into routine practice in low and middle-income countries."
https://openalex.org/W3006426847,"Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) is a foodborne pathogen and the etiologic agent of listeriosis, which can be disseminated within the agricultural environment particularly soil and irrigation water, contaminate farm produce and cause high mortality and morbidity among vulnerable individuals. This study assessed the incidence and antibiogram of L. monocytogenes recovered from irrigation water and agricultural soil samples collected from Chris Hani and Amathole District Municipalities (DMs) in Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. The distribution of presumptive L. monocytogenes in irrigation water and agricultural soil samples was done using the standard plate count method, while polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to identify the isolates. The confirmed isolates were screened for 9 key virulence markers using PCR after which they were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing against 18 antibiotics used for the alleviation of listeriosis using the disk diffusion method. Relevant putative antibiotic resistance genes in the resistant variants were screened for using PCR. The distribution of L. monocytogenes in irrigation water samples was statistically significant (P ≤ 0.05) and ranged from log10 1.00 CFU/100ml to log10 3.75 CFU/100 ml. In agricultural soil samples, the distribution ranged significantly (P ≤ 0.05) from log10 2.10 CFU/g to log10 3.51 CFU/g. Of the 117 presumptive L. monocytogenes recovered from irrigation water samples and 183 presumptive L. monocytogenes isolated from agricultural soil samples, 8 (6.8%) and 12 (6.6%) isolates were confirmed respectively. Nine virulence genes including inlA, inlB, inlC, inlJ, actA, hlyA, plcA, plcB, and iap were detected in all the isolates. The proportion of the isolates exhibiting phenotypic resistance against the test antimicrobials followed the order: tetracycline (90%), doxycycline (85%), cefotaxime (80%), penicillin (80%), chloramphenicol (70%), linezolid (65%), erythromycin (60%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (55%). The isolates exhibited multiple antibiotic resistance against 3 or more antibiotics and the MAR indices of all the multidrug isolates were ≥0.2. The isolates harboured antibiotic resistance genes including tetA, tetB, tetC, sulI, sulII, aadA, aac(3)-IIa and ESBLs including blaTEM, blaCTX-M group 9, blaVEB as well as AmpC. None of the isolates harboured the carbapenemases. We conclude that irrigation water and agricultural soil collected from Chris Hani and Amathole District Municipalities (DMs) in Eastern Cape Province of South Africa are reservoirs and potential transmission routes of multidrug-resistant L. monocytogenes to the food web and consequently threat to public health."
https://openalex.org/W3004720691,"Rodents’ ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) provide useful information for assessing their social behaviors. Despite previous efforts in classifying subcategories of time-frequency patterns of USV syllables to study their functional relevance, methods for detecting vocal elements from continuously recorded data have remained sub-optimal. Here, we propose a novel procedure for detecting USV segments in continuous sound data containing background noise recorded during the observation of social behavior. The proposed procedure utilizes a stable version of the sound spectrogram and additional signal processing for better separation of vocal signals by reducing the variation of the background noise. Our procedure also provides precise time tracking of spectral peaks within each syllable. We demonstrated that this procedure can be applied to a variety of USVs obtained from several rodent species. Performance tests showed this method had greater accuracy in detecting USV syllables than conventional detection methods."
https://openalex.org/W3005419768,"Objective Postpartum depression (PPD) is inversely correlated with women’s functioning, marital and personal relationships, mother-infant interaction quality, and children’s social, behavioural, and cognitive development. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of postpartum depression (PPD) in Riyadh and correlate them with possible predictors by a cross-sectional approach. Methods In this study, 174 mothers receiving treatments in different hospitals of Riyadh completed self-administered measures of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) along with a list of probable predictors. The data was analyzed by logistic regression analysis using SPSS-IBM 25. Results Of 174 participants of the study, 38.50% (n = 67) reported postpartum depression. Around (115) of the participants were in an age group of 25–45 years with most of them highly educated (101) but unemployed (136). Significant association was noted between occurrence of PPD with unsupportive spouse (P value = 0.023) and recent stressful life events (P value = 0.003). The significant predictors for PPD were unsupportive spouse (OR = 4.53, P = 0.049), recent stressful life events (OR = 2.677, P = 0.005), and Caesarean section as a mode of delivery (OR = 1.958, P = 0.049) Conclusion The prevalence of PPD among the study participants was high, especially those with recent stressful life event and unsupportive spouse. To promote health and wellbeing of mothers, it was recommended to screen all high-risk mothers for PPD, when they visit hospitals for postnatal follow ups. Prevention of PPD is not only essential for wellbeing of mothers but it is important to provide good conducive atmosphere for the new born."
https://openalex.org/W3004537452,"This study provides an overview of science from the Wikipedia perspective. A methodology has been established for the analysis of how Wikipedia editors regard science through their references to scientific papers. The method of co-citation has been adapted to this context in order to generate Pathfinder networks (PFNET) that highlight the most relevant scientific journals and categories, and their interactions in order to find out how scientific literature is consumed through this open encyclopaedia. In addition to this, their obsolescence has been studied through Price index. A total of 1 433 457 references available at Altmetric.com have been initially taken into account. After pre-processing and linking them to the data from Elsevier's CiteScore Metrics the sample was reduced to 847 512 references made by 193 802 Wikipedia articles to 598 746 scientific articles belonging to 14 149 journals indexed in Scopus. As highlighted results we found a significative presence of ""Medicine"" and ""Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"" papers and that the most important journals are multidisciplinary in nature, suggesting also that high-impact factor journals were more likely to be cited. Furthermore, only 13.44% of Wikipedia citations are to Open Access journals."
https://openalex.org/W3004642152,"This study aimed to assess the effects of restricting mobile phone use before bedtime on sleep, pre-sleep arousal, mood, and working memory.Thirty-eight participants were randomized to either an intervention group (n = 19), where members were instructed to avoid using their mobile phone 30 minutes before bedtime, or a control group (n = 19), where the participants were given no such instructions. Sleep habit, sleep quality, pre-sleep arousal and mood were measured using the sleep diary, the Pittsburgh sleep quality index, the Pre-sleep Arousal Scale and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule respectively. Working memory was tested by using the 0-,1-,2-back task (n-back task).Restricting mobile phone use before bedtime for four weeks was effective in reducing sleep latency, increasing sleep duration, improving sleep quality, reducing pre-sleep arousal, and improving positive affect and working memory.Restricting mobile phone use close to bedtime reduced sleep latency and pre-sleep arousal and increased sleep duration and working memory. This simple change to moderate usage was recommended to individuals with sleep disturbances."
https://openalex.org/W3006459350,"We study the number Nk of length-k word matches between pairs of evolutionarily related DNA sequences, as a function of k. We show that the Jukes-Cantor distance between two genome sequences-i.e. the number of substitutions per site that occurred since they evolved from their last common ancestor-can be estimated from the slope of a function F that depends on Nk and that is affine-linear within a certain range of k. Integers kmin and kmax can be calculated depending on the length of the input sequences, such that the slope of F in the relevant range can be estimated from the values F(kmin) and F(kmax). This approach can be generalized to so-called Spaced-word Matches (SpaM), where mismatches are allowed at positions specified by a user-defined binary pattern. Based on these theoretical results, we implemented a prototype software program for alignment-free sequence comparison called Slope-SpaM. Test runs on real and simulated sequence data show that Slope-SpaM can accurately estimate phylogenetic distances for distances up to around 0.5 substitutions per position. The statistical stability of our results is improved if spaced words are used instead of contiguous words. Unlike previous alignment-free methods that are based on the number of (spaced) word matches, Slope-SpaM produces accurate results, even if sequences share only local homologies."
https://openalex.org/W3005353053,"Human activities have greatly influenced the natural nitrogen cycle, causing dramatic degradation of ecosystem function. Net anthropogenic nitrogen input (NANI) is an important factor contributing to the impact of human activities on the regional nitrogen cycle. Here, we analyzed the temporal and spatial variation of NANI in the Pearl River Basin of China between 1986 to 2015, and found that the total amount of NANI significantly increased from 3,362.25 kg N km-2 yr-1 to 8,071.15 kg N km-2 yr-1. Application of nitrogen fertilizers was the largest component of NANI in the Basin, accounting for 55.53% in the total NANI, followed by food/feed net nitrogen input (21.26%), atmospheric nitrogen deposition (12.95%), and crop nitrogen fixation (10.26%). Over the last three decades, nitrogen inputs from atmospheric nitrogen deposition have become the second largest source of NANI due to rapid industrialization and urbanization in the region. Regression analysis showed that the rapid growth of both GDP and population density were the main contributors to the increase of NANI. In addition, the increase in the number of red tides in the Pearl River Estuary was strongly correlated with NANI discharge (R2 = 0.90, p<0.01), suggesting the NANI’s eutrophication effect. In total, this study provides a quantitative understanding of the temporal and spatial variations of NANI in the Pearl River Basin as well as the effects of NANI on estuarine waters, and offered key information for developing an integrated strategy for watershed nitrogen management."
https://openalex.org/W3004765867,"Cigarette smoking and tuberculosis are a significant cause of death worldwide. Several epidemiological studies have demonstrated cigarette smoking is a risk factor for tuberculosis. Electronic cigarettes have recently appeared as a healthier alternative to conventional smoking, although their impact in tuberculosis is not well understood. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of electronic cigarettes in phagocytosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and cytokines production. In vitro infection was carried out by exposing THP-1 macrophages to four electronic vapor extracts and the intracellular burden of M. tuberculosis was determined. The percentage of infection was evaluated by confocal microscopy and the cytokine production by Luminex. A reduction of intracellular M. tuberculosis burden in THP-1 macrophages was found after its exposure to electronic vapor extract; the same trend was observed by confocal microscopy when Mycobacterium bovis BCG-GFP strain was used. Electronic cigarettes stimulate a pro-inflammatory cytokine response. We conclude that electronic cigarettes impair the phagocytic function and the cytokine response to M. tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W3004956870,"Although the beneficial effects of probiotics in the prevention or treatment of metabolic disorders have been extensively researched, the precise mechanisms by which probiotics improve metabolic homeostasis are still not clear. Given that probiotics usually exert a comprehensive effect on multiple metabolic disorders, defining a concurrent mechanism underlying the multiple effects is critical to understand the function of probiotics. In this study, we identified the SIRT1-dependent or independent PGC-1α pathways in multiple organs that mediate the protective effects of a strain of Lactobacillus plantarum against high-fat diet-induced adiposity, glucose intolerance, and dyslipidemia. L. plantarum treatment significantly enhanced the expression of SIRT1, PPARα, and PGC-1α in the liver and adipose tissues under HFD-fed condition. L. plantarum treated mice also exhibited significantly increased expressions of genes involved in bile acid synthesis and reverse cholesterol transport in the liver, browning and thermogenesis of adipose tissue, and fatty acid oxidation in the liver and adipose tissue. Additionally, L. plantarum treatment significantly upregulated the expressions of adiponectin in adipose tissue, irisin in skeletal muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), and FGF21 in SAT. These beneficial changes were associated with a significantly improved HFD-induced alteration of gut microbiota. Our findings suggest that the PGC-1α-mediated pathway could be regarded as a potential target in the development of probiotics-based therapies for the prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3006483309,"Following endocytosis, receptors that are internalized to sorting endosomes are sorted to different pathways, in part by sorting nexin (SNX) proteins. Notably, SNX17 interacts with a multitude of receptors in a sequence-specific manner to regulate their recycling. However, the mechanisms by which SNX17-labeled vesicles that contain sorted receptors bud and undergo vesicular fission from the sorting endosomes remain elusive. Recent studies suggest that a dynamin-homolog, Eps15 homology domain protein 1, catalyzes fission and releases endosome-derived vesicles for recycling to the plasma membrane. However, the mechanism by which EHD1 is coupled to various receptors and regulates their recycling remains unknown. Here we sought to characterize the mechanism by which EHD1 couples with SNX17 to regulate recycling of SNX17-interacting receptors. We hypothesized that SNX17 couples receptors to the EHD1 fission machinery in mammalian cells. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments and in vitro assays provided evidence that EHD1 and SNX17 directly interact. We also found that inducing internalization of a SNX17 cargo receptor, low-density lipoprotein receptor–related protein 1 (LRP1), led to recruitment of cytoplasmic EHD1 to endosomal membranes. Moreover, surface rendering and quantification of overlap volumes indicated that SNX17 and EHD1 partially colocalize on endosomes and that this overlap further increases upon LRP1 internalization. Additionally, SNX17-containing endosomes were larger in EHD1-depleted cells than in WT cells, suggesting that EHD1 depletion impairs SNX17-mediated endosomal fission. Our findings help clarify our current understanding of endocytic trafficking, providing significant additional insight into the process of endosomal fission and connecting the sorting and fission machineries.

https://openalex.org/W3006336082,"Lyme disease (LD) diagnosis using the current two-tier algorithm is constrained by low sensitivity for early-stage infection and ambiguity in determining treatment response. We recently developed a protein microarray biochip that measures diagnostic serum antibody targets using grating-coupled fluorescent plasmonics (GC-FP) technology. This strategy requires microliters of blood serum to enable multiplexed biomarker screening on a compact surface and generates quantitative results that can be further processed for diagnostic scoring. The GC-FP biochip was used to detect serum antibodies in patients with active and convalescent LD, as well as various negative controls. We hypothesized that the quantitative, high-sensitivity attributes of the GC-FP approach permit: 1) screening of antibody targets predictive for LD status, and 2) development a diagnostic algorithm that is more sensitive, specific, and informative than the standard ELISA and Western blot assays. Notably, our findings led to a diagnostic algorithm that may be more sensitive than the current standard for detecting early LD, while maintaining 100% specificity. We further show that analysis of relative antibody levels to predict disease status, such as in acute and convalescent stages of infection, is possible with a highly sensitive and quantitative platform like GC-FP. The results from this study add to the urgent conversation regarding better diagnostic strategies and more effective treatment for patients affected by tick-borne disease."
https://openalex.org/W3004977687,"Introduction Obstructed labour (OL) is an important clinical and public health problem because of the associated maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Risk factors for OL and its associated obstetric squeal are usually context specific. No epidemiological study has documented the risk factors for OL in Eastern Uganda. This study was conducted to identify the risk factors for OL in Mbale Hospital. Objective To identify the risk factors for OL in Mbale Regional Referral and Teaching Hospital, Eastern Uganda. Methods We conducted a case control study with 270 cases of women with OL and 270 controls of women without OL. We consecutively enrolled eligible cases between July 2018 and February 2019. For each case, we randomly selected one eligible control admitted in the same 24-hour period. Data was collected using face-to-face interviews and a review of patient notes. Logistic regression was used to identify the risk factors for OL. Results The risk factors for OL were, being a referral from a lower health facility (AOR 6.80, 95% CI: 4.20–11.00), prime parity (AOR 2.15 95% CI: 1.26–3.66) and use of herbal medicines in active labour (AOR 2.72 95% CI: 1.49–4.96). Married participants (AOR 0.59 95% CI: 0.35–0.97) with a delivery plan (AOR 0.56 95% CI: 0.35–0.90) and educated partners (AOR 0.57 95% CI: 0.33–0.98) were less likely to have OL. In the adjusted analysis, there was no association between four or more ANC visits and OL, adjusted odds ratio [(AOR) 0.96 95% CI: 0.57–1.63)]. Conclusions Prime parity, use of herbal medicines in labour and being a referral from a lower health facility were identified as risk factors. Being married with a delivery plan and an educated partner were protective of OL. Increased frequency of ANC attendance was not protective against obstructed labour."

The objective of this study was to provide updated calorie trends through 2018 and examine trends in the macronutrient composition of menu items across this time period.Data were obtained from the MenuStat project and include 66 of the 100 largest revenue generating U.S. chain restaurants (N = 28,238 items) that had data available in all years from 2012 to 2018. Generalized linear models were used to examine per-item calorie and nutrient changes (saturated fat, trans fat, unsaturated fat, sugar, non-sugar carbohydrates, protein, sodium) among (1) items on the menu in all years (common items) and (2) newly introduced items (2013-2018). Overall, there were no significant changes in calories or nutrients among common items from 2012 to 2018. Among all newly introduced items, calories (-120 kcals, -25%, p = 0.01; p-for-trend = 0.02), saturated fat (-3.4g, -41%, p<0.01, p-for-trend = 0.06), unsaturated fat (-4.5g, -37%, p = 0.02; p-for-trend = 0.04), non-sugar carbohydrates (-10.3g, -40%, p = 0.02, p-for-trend = 0.69), and protein (-4.3g, -25%, p = 0.04, p-for-trend = 0.02) declined.Newly introduced menu items in large chain restaurants have continued to decline in calories through 2018, which may help to reduce calorie intake. Other changes in macronutrient content were sporadic and not clearly toward improved dietary quality."
https://openalex.org/W3006491262,"Background Diabetes is a metabolic disorder, characterized by hyperglycemic state of the body. A silent killer, which can take the lives of victims if undiagnosed at the earliest stage. Prediabetes has become an important health concern across countries due to its huge potential for the development of diabetes and other complications. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes and its associated factors among rural fishing communities in Penang, Malaysia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among fishing communities in Southwest District of Penang, Malaysia from August to November 2017. Blood sample (finger prick test) and physical examination were performed on sample of 168 participants consented in this study. Pre-validated Malay versions of International Physical Activity 7 (IPAQ-7) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) questionnaires were used to assess the level of physical activity and stress levels of the participants. Multinomial logistic regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with prediabetes and diabetes. Results The prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes were 19.6% (95% CI: 14.3, 26.4) and 10.12% (95% CI: 6.4, 15.7) respectively. The median physical activity (interquartile range) in MET-minutes per week for those with diabetes (1071.0 (2120.0)) and prediabetes (1314.0 (1710.0)) was generally lower as compared to non-diabetes. Majority reported moderate stress (57.3%) from PSS system. Abdominal obesity, family history of diabetes and being hypertensive were significant factors associated with diabetes; while older age, bigger waist circumference and self-perceived poor routine diet were factors associated with prediabetes. Conclusions The screening for prediabetes in this population gives the opportunity to implement lifestyle interventions at the earliest possible, which could prevent the development of diabetes. The identification of diabetic individuals provides an opportunity to conduct health promotion and education to ensure good metabolic control and hence reduce the risks of complications."
https://openalex.org/W3005188533,"The purpose of this study was to provide more insight into how the physical education (PE) context can be better tailored to the diverse motivational demands of secondary school students. Therefore, we examined how different constructs of student motivation in the context of PE combine into distinct motivational profiles, aiming to unveil motivational similarities and differences between students' PE experiences. Participants were 2,562 Dutch secondary school students, aged 12-18, from 24 different schools. Students responded to questionnaires assessing their perception of psychological need satisfaction and frustration, and perceived mastery and performance climate in PE. In order to interpret the emerging profiles additional variables were assessed (i.e. demographic, motivational and PE-related variables). Two-step cluster analysis identified three meaningful profiles labelled as negative perceivers, moderate perceivers and positive perceivers. These three profiles differed significantly with regard to perceived psychological need satisfaction and frustration and their perception of the motivational climate. This study demonstrates that students can be grouped in distinct profiles based on their perceptions of the motivational PE environment. Consequently, the insights obtained could assist PE teachers in designing instructional strategies that target students' differential motivational needs."
https://openalex.org/W3004834539,"Production of the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) by Staphylococcus aureus is mediated via the genes lukS-PV and lukF-PV which are carried on bacteriophage ϕSa2. PVL is associated with S. aureus strains that cause serious infections and clones of community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) that have additionally disseminated widely. In Western Australia (WA) the original CA-MRSA were PVL negative however, between 2005 and 2008, following the introduction of eight international PVL-positive CA-MRSA, PVL-positive WA CA-MRSA were found. There was concern that PVL bacteriophages from the international clones were transferring into the local clones, therefore a comparative study of PVL-carrying ϕSa2 prophage genomes from historic WA PVL-positive S. aureus and representatives of all PVL-positive CA-MRSA isolated in WA between 2005 and 2008 was performed. The prophages were classified into two genera and three PVL bacteriophage groups and had undergone many recombination events during their evolution. Comparative analysis of mosaic regions of selected bacteriophages using the Alignments of bacteriophage genomes (Alpha) aligner revealed novel recombinations and modules. There was heterogeneity in the chromosomal integration sites, the lysogeny regulation regions, the defence and DNA processing modules, the structural and packaging modules and the lukSF-PV genes. One WA CA-MRSA (WA518751) and one international clone (Korean Clone) have probably acquired PVL-carrying ϕSa2 in WA, however these clones did not disseminate in the community. Genetic heterogeneity made it impossible to trace the source of the PVL prophages in the other WA clones. Against this background of PVL prophage diversity, the sequence of one group, the ϕSa2USA/ϕSa2wa-st93 group, was remarkably stable over at least 20 years and associated with the highly virulent USA300 and ST93-IVa CA-MRSA lineages that have disseminated globally."
https://openalex.org/W3006535488,"The basal ganglia (BG) is a collection of nuclei located deep beneath the cerebral cortex that is involved in learning and selection of rewarded actions. Here, we analyzed BG mechanisms that enable these functions. We implemented a rate model of a BG-thalamo-cortical loop and simulated its performance in a standard action selection task. We have shown that potentiation of corticostriatal synapses enables learning of a rewarded option. However, these synapses became redundant later as direct connections between prefrontal and premotor cortices (PFC-PMC) were potentiated by Hebbian learning. After we switched the reward to the previously unrewarded option (reversal), the BG was again responsible for switching to the new option. Due to the potentiated direct cortical connections, the system was biased to the previously rewarded choice, and establishing the new choice required a greater number of trials. Guided by physiological research, we then modified our model to reproduce pathological states of mild Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases. We found that in the Parkinsonian state PMC activity levels become extremely variable, which is caused by oscillations arising in the BG-thalamo-cortical loop. The model reproduced severe impairment of learning and predicted that this is caused by these oscillations as well as a reduced reward prediction signal. In the Huntington state, the potentiation of the PFC-PMC connections produced better learning, but altered BG output disrupted expression of the rewarded choices. This resulted in random switching between rewarded and unrewarded choices resembling an exploratory phase that never ended. Along with other computational studies, our results further reconcile the apparent contradiction between the critical involvement of the BG in execution of previously learned actions and yet no impairment of these actions after BG output is ablated by lesions or deep brain stimulation. We predict that the cortico-BG-thalamo-cortical loop conforms to previously learned choice in healthy conditions, but impedes those choices in disease states."

In the present study, we investigated the presence of HEV among pigs in the Center and Littoral regions of Cameroon and performed the molecular characterization of positive strains. Methodology A total of 453 serum and stool samples were randomly collected from pigs in slaughterhouses in Obala, Douala and Yaounde. All samples were examined for the presence of anti-HEV IgG and IgM antibodies using ELISA assays. IgM positive stool samples were tested for HEV RNA using an RT-PCR assay, followed by a nested PCR assay for sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Results Overall, 216 samples (47.7%, 95% CI: 43.1%-52.3%) were positive for at least one of the serological markers of HEV infection. Amongst these, 21.0% were positives for anti-HEV IgM, 17.7% for anti-HEV IgG, and 9.1% for both. A total of eight stool samples (5.9%) were positive for HEV RNA by nested RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the retrieved sequences clustered within HEV genotype 3. Conclusion This study shows a high prevalence of anti-HEV antibodies and the circulation of genotype 3 in the swine population in Cameroon. Subsequent studies will be needed to elucidate the zoonotic transmission of HEV from pigs to humans in Cameroon."

In favour of whole-genome transcriptome profiling of Staphylococcus sp. strain P-TSB-70 (GenBank Accn. No. KP117091) which tolerated upto 20% NaCl stress, the strain was cultured in the laboratory condition with 20% NaCl stress. Transcriptome analyses were performed by SOLiD4.0 sequencing technology from which 10280 and 9612 transcripts for control and treated, respectively, were obtained. The coverage per base (CPB) statistics were analyzed for both the samples. Gene ontology (GO) analysis has been categorized at varied graph levels based on three primary ontology studies viz. cellular components, biological processes, and molecular functions. The KEGG analysis of the assembled transcripts using KAAS showed presumed components of metabolic pathways which perhaps implicated in diverse metabolic pathways responsible for salt tolerance viz. glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, glutathione metabolism, etc. further involving in salt tolerance. Overall, 90 salt stress tolerant genes were identified as of 186 salt-related transcripts. Several genes have been found executing normally in the TCA cycle pathway, integral membrane proteins, generation of the osmoprotectants, enzymatic pathway associated with salt tolerance. Recognized genes fit diverse groups of salt stress genes viz. abc transporter, betaine, sodium antiporter, sodium symporter, trehalose, ectoine, and choline, that belong to different families of genes involved in the pathway of salt stress. The control sample of the bacterium showed elevated high proportion of transcript contigs (29%) while upto 20% salt stress treated sample of the bacterium showed a higher percentage of transcript contigs (31.28%). A total of 1,288 and 1,133 transcript contigs were measured entirely as novel transcript contigs in both control and treated samples, respectively. The structure and function of 10 significant salt stress tolerant genes of Staphylococcus sp. have been analyzed in this study. The information acquired in the present study possibly used to recognize and clone the salt stress tolerant genes and support in developing the salt stress-tolerant plant varieties to expand the agricultural productivity in the saline system."
https://openalex.org/W3005721934,"Carbonyl sulfide (COS) has been proposed as a proxy for carbon dioxide (CO2) taken up by plants at the leaf and ecosystem scales. However, several additional production and removal processes have been identified which could complicate its use at larger scales, among which are soil uptake, dark uptake by plants, and soil and anthropogenic emissions. This study evaluates the significance of these processes at the regional scale through a top-down approach based on atmospheric COS measurements at Gif-sur-Yvette (GIF), a suburban site near Paris (France). Over a period of four and a half years, hourly measurements at 7 m above ground level were performed by gas chromatography and combined with 222Radon measurements to calculate nocturnal COS fluxes using the Radon-Tracer Method. In addition, the vertical distribution of COS was investigated at a second site, 2 km away from GIF, where a fast gas analyzer deployed on a 100 m tower for several months during winter 2015–2016 recorded mixing ratios at 3 heights (15, 60 and 100 m). COS appears to be homogeneously distributed both horizontally and vertically in the sampling area. The main finding is that the area is a persistent COS sink even during wintertime episodes of strong pollution. Nighttime net uptake rates ranged from -1.5 to -32.8 pmol m-2 s-1, with an average of -7.3 ± 4.5 pmol m-2 s-1 (n = 253). However, episodes of biogenic emissions happened each year in June-July (11.9 ± 6.2 pmol m-2 s-1, n = 24). Preliminary analyses of simulated footprints of source areas influencing the recorded COS data suggest that long-range transport of COS from anthropogenic sources located in Benelux, Eastern France and Germany occasionally impacts the Paris area during wintertime. These production and removal processes may limit the use of COS to assess regional-scale CO2 uptake in Europe by plants through inverse modeling."

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and is one of the primary endotoxins released by these organisms (11Dong H. Xiang Q. Gu Y. Wang Z.

LPS induces an inflammatory response in immunocompetent cells in human and mouse models (12Vaure C. Liu Y.

Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is an LPS receptor expressed on immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes (12Vaure C. Liu Y. A comparative review of toll-like receptor 4 expression and functionality in different animal species.Front. Immunol. 2014; 5 (25071777): 316Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), and activation of TLR4-associated signaling, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathways, induces synthesis of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 (13Guha M. Mackman N. LPS induction of gene expression in human monocytes.Cell. Signal. 2001; 13 (11257452): 85-9410.1016/S0898-6568(00)00149-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar). However, the relation of LPS with polyP in the inflammatory response in immune cells is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of polyP on LPS-induced inflammatory response in macrophages, focusing on the reaction between polyP and LPS in vitro. To investigate the effect of polyP on LPS-induced macrophage inflammatory response, THP-1–derived macrophages were reacted with LPS isolated from Escherichia coli with or without polyP-65 (chain length 60–70-mer). LPS induced the expression of inflammatory cytokine genes TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 in macrophages, as reported previously (14Schildberger A. Rossmanith E. Eichhorn T. Strassl K. Weber V. Monocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and THP-1 cells exhibit different cytokine expression patterns following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide.Mediators Inflamm. 2013; 2013 (23818743): 69797210.1155/2013/697972Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The addition of polyP-65 markedly enhanced cytokine expression (TNFα: polyP and LPS (7.16 ± 1.98) versus LPS alone (1.14 ± 0.55); IL-1β: polyP and LPS (5.70 ± 1.49) versus LPS alone (1.38 ± 0.22); IL-6: polyP and LPS (16.11 ± 8.63) versus LPS alone (0.92 ± 0.60), p < 0.05), whereas polyP-65 itself did not induce macrophage inflammatory response in the absence of LPS (Fig. 1, A–C). Consistent with gene expression, polyP-65 greatly amplified the production of cytokines from macrophages in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, D–F). The LPS-induced macrophage inflammatory cytokine production was also enhanced in a chain length–dependent manner within a range of 1–850 mer (Fig. 1, G–I). PolyP did not involve in cell viability in the reaction setting (Fig. S1). Cytokine production was also increased in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and J774.1 murine macrophages (Fig. S2). These results indicate that polyP amplified LPS-induced macrophage inflammatory response in a dose– and chain length–dependent manner. To examine the mechanism of polyP-mediated amplification of LPS-induced macrophage inflammatory response, intracellular signaling molecules related to inflammatory response were assessed. PolyP did not change the mRNA expression of TLR4 and the components of the complex, such as CD14 and myeloid differentiation protein-2 (MD-2) in THP-1 cells reacted with LPS (Fig. S3). LPS induced phosphorylation of JNK, NF-κB, and IκBα, but not p38, Erk1/2-MAPK. The phosphorylation was enhanced with the addition of polyP-65 (Fig. 2, A–E). In contrast, polyP-65 alone did not affect phosphorylation of these proteins. Furthermore, polyP-65 amplified LPS-induced NLRP3 protein expression in macrophages (Fig. 2F). These results suggest that polyP enhances LPS-induced MAPK, NF-κB, and NLRP3 activation in macrophages. To elucidate the mechanism of polyP-mediated enhancement of LPS-induced activation of downstream signaling of TRL4 in macrophages, we performed experiments using a receptor and a signal blocker associated with LPS. Both TAK242, an antagonist of TLR4, and BAY11-7082, an inhibitor of NF-κB, significantly inhibited the synergistic effect of polyP on LPS-induced cytokine synthesis (Fig. 3, A–F). To investigate the molecular interactions among polyP, LPS, and TLR4 on macrophages, we used immunofluorescent microscopy, flow cytometry, and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) analysis. When macrophages were incubated with biotinylated LPS, several dot signals emerged on the surface of cells, and polyP-65 enhanced biotinylated LPS staining on the surface of macrophages (fluorescence intensity: polyP with LPS (213.8 ± 55.7 A.U.) versus LPS alone (11.7 ± 6.3 A.U.), p < 0.01) (Fig. 4, A and B). Flow cytometry analysis showed that treatment with polyP significantly increased the abundance of LPS-FITC–positive macrophages compared with those treated with LPS alone (mean intensity: polyP with LPS (45.62 ± 1.07 A.U.) versus LPS alone (26.11 ± 0.36 A.U.), p < 0.01) (Fig. 4, C and D). Furthermore, to assess the effect of polyP on the interaction between LPS and TLR4, we performed QCM analysis (Fig. 4, E–J). A decrease in resonance frequency was observed when LPS was injected onto a sensor chip containing immobilized TLR4 (Fig. 4G). In this system, injection of polyP-65 plus LPS led to a higher reduction in the frequency than was observed after injection of LPS alone (Fig. 4, H–J), whereas injection of polyP-65 or buffer alone did not change the frequency (Fig. 4, E and F). To calculate the kinetic parameter, repetitive injection of LPS and polyP-65 was performed. The amount of change in frequency for each injection was greater in LPS with polyP-65 than in polyP-65 alone. (Fig. S4). The KD values of LPS to TLR4 were 2.07 μm (LPS) and 1.51 μm (LPS + polyP-65), respectively. We also examined the effect of polyP on the interaction between LPS and other TLR4 complexes, such as CD14 and MD-2, while there was no interaction with LPS (Fig. S5). These results indicate that polyP enhances the interaction between LPS and TLR4 on macrophages. To obtain additional information on the interaction between polyP and LPS, we measured the hydrodynamic diameter (Dh) of LPS micelles in the presence of varying concentrations of polyP-65 using dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Fig. 5A). A previous study indicated that LPS forms distinct types of micelles, depending on the concentrations (15Santos N.C. Silva A.C. Castanho M.A.R.B. Martins-Silva J. Saldanha C. Evaluation of lipopolysaccharide aggregation by light scattering spectroscopy.Chembiochem. 2003; 4 (12512082): 96-10010.1002/cbic.200390020Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar); specifically, premicelle oligomers and large aggregates were formed below and above, respectively, the apparent critical micelle concentration of 14 μg/ml LPS. The DLS measurement of LPS micelles in the absence of polyP-65 detected two primary components: component 1 at a Dh value of 26.4 nm and component 2 at a Dh value of 60.6 nm (Fig. 5A, 0 μm polyP-65). The fraction of component 1 increased and that of component 2 decreased following treatment with polyP-65 at concentrations higher than 2 μm (Fig. 5B). The Dh value of component 1 slightly decreased, but the Dh value of component 2 only slightly changed following treatment with polyP-65 (Fig. 5C). PolyP-65 alone did not show measurable scattering intensity at concentrations below 20 μm (data not shown). The interaction between the LPS micelle and polyP-65 shows that polyP-65 destabilizes the larger micelles and increases the proportion of smaller LPS micelles. To examine the affinity between polyP and LPS, we performed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments. The titration of polyP-65 with LPS showed endothermic heat, with a stronger interaction at 25 °C than at 37 °C (Fig. 5D). As a control, endothermic heat was not observed with LPS alone (Fig. S6A) or polyP-65 alone (Fig. S6B). We then analyzed the saturating titration curve at 25 °C (Fig. 5E). Parameters could not be assessed at 37 °C owing to poor curve fitting. The apparent stoichiometry of binding was as follows: 1 mol of LPS interacted with 0.036–0.072 mol of polyP-65 (14–28 mol of LPS interacted with 1 mol of polyP-65) when the molecular weight of LPS was assumed to be in the range of 3,000–6,000, with a Kd of 0.26 ± 0.05 μm. The ΔH, −TΔS, and ΔG values for binding were 199 ± 111, −208, and −8.81 kcal/mol, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters indicated that the driving force for favorable ΔG arises from the positive entropy change (ΔS). These results suggest that polyP-65 interacts with LPS micelles consisting of 14–28 molecules, leading to a net dehydration (i.e. removal of water molecules) around polyP-65 or LPS micelles, and converts the large micelles into smaller micelles. In this study, we report that inorganic polyP amplified LPS-induced macrophage inflammatory response in vitro by enhancing the binding affinity of LPS to TLR4 and promoting LPS micelle formation. Several studies have shown the role of polyP in inflammation and blood clotting cascades. For example, polyP amplifies the inflammatory response of nuclear proteins in human umbilical vein endothelial cells by enhancing multiple ligand-receptor signaling pathways (6Dinarvand P.

In our study, polyP significantly enhanced LPS-induced cytokine production in macrophages in a dose– and chain length–dependent manner (Fig. 1). In this experimental system, monophosphate did not promote macrophage inflammation, suggesting that polymerization of phosphate could be crucial for the reaction. The effect of polyP on LPS-induced macrophage inflammation was more prominent when the chain length was greater than 65 monomers (Fig. 1, G–I). Middle-length chain polyP (60–100-mer) is known to be stored in platelets and released into circulation during systemic inflammation (4Müller F. Mutch N.J. Schenk W.A. Smith S.A. Esterl L.

Thus, it is possible that circulating middle- and/or long-chain polyP was produced during sepsis and enhanced the reaction between LPS and immune cells. To understand the detailed mechanism of the effect of polyP on LPS-induced macrophage inflammatory response, we examined the reaction of polyP with LPS, which then reacted with TLR4 on the surface of immune cells. DLS measurements indicated that polyP induced the conversion of larger LPS micelles to smaller micelles in a polyP concentration–dependent manner (Fig. 5B). ITC measurements indicated that 14–28 mol of LPS interacted with 1 mol of polyP-65 by an entropy-driven reaction. LPS consists of three components, lipid A, O-specific chain, and core oligosaccharide, (11Dong H. Xiang Q. Gu Y. Wang Z. Paterson N.G. Stansfeld P.J. He C. Zhang Y. Wang W. Dong C.

Our QCM analysis and immunofluorescence studies (Figs. 4A and 5) revealed that the negatively charged polyP enhanced the interaction between TLR4 and LPS that accelerated micelle formation.

Based on our findings, we proposed a novel hypothesis for the role of polyP in LPS-induced macrophage inflammatory response (Fig. 6). PolyP is stored in serum, plasma, or platelets of individuals. Sepsis induces the release of polyP and LPS from bacteria or activates platelets to release their stored polyP. The released or stored polyP promotes LPS to form smaller micelles, which facilitate binding of LPS to TLR4 on immune cells with higher intensity than in the absence of polyP. Thus, the polyP-LPS complex amplifies the signaling from TLR4 to downstream molecules, such as MAPK and NF-κB, which enhance inflammatory cytokine production from macrophages. Excess cytokine production driven by polyP may exacerbate systemic inflammatory disease. Our results are limited to in vitro experiments, and further research is needed to elucidate the role of polyP and its metabolism in clinical sepsis. In conclusion, polyP amplified LPS-induced macrophage inflammatory response in vitro. PolyP promoted smaller micelle formation by LPS and accelerated the binding of LPS to TLR4 on macrophages. Our findings provide new perspectives and a novel therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases.

Anti-β-actin Ab-HRP-direct rabbit IgG was purchased from MBL (Aichi, Japan). THP-1 human monocytic leukemia cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 10 mm HEPES (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1× minimum Eagle’s medium vitamin (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 0.5 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in humidified air under 5% CO2. THP-1 cells at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml were differentiated into macrophages following incubation with 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma–Aldrich) for 72 h (THP-1 macrophages). Macrophage differentiation from monocytes was detected by their adherence to the culture plate. Cells were then washed with PBS and replaced with serum-free medium for 24 h before further experiments. THP-1 macrophages were incubated with LPS (1.0 ng/ml) with or without polyP-65 (50 μm) for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted from cells using the GenElute mammalian total RNA miniprep kit (Sigma–Aldrich) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocols. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the One-Step SYBR Plus RT-PCR kit on a thermal cycler Dice real-time system (TP900, Takara, Shiga, Japan). Primers for human TNFα (HA252960, Takara), IL-1β (HA106116, Takara), IL-6 (HA032507, Takara), TLR4 (HA216500, Takara), CD14 (HA154223, Takara), MD-2 (HA160690, Takara), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (HA067812, Takara) were used for this analysis. GAPDH was used as an internal control. THP-1 macrophages were incubated with or without LPS (1.0 ng/ml) and/or 0–200 μm polyP (mono P, polyP-15, polyP-65, polyP-100, and polyP-850) in FBS-free medium for 24 h. Concentrations of these polyPs are expressed in terms of orthophosphate monomers. Cell supernatants were collected, and the concentrations of TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 were measured using human TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), respectively, according to the manufacturer’s protocols. THP-1 macrophages were incubated with or without LPS (1.0 ng/ml) and/or polyP-65 (50 μm) for 6 h. Western blot analysis was performed to detect the phosphorylation of JNK, p38, Erk1/2-MAPK, NF-κB p65, and IκBα and the expression of NLRP3 in cells. Whole-cell lysates were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (FUJIFILM Wako, Osaka, Japan), supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Roche). The lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration was evaluated using a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The proteins were boiled in SDS sample buffer (TEFCO, Tokyo, Japan) and 10% 2-mercaptoethanol at 95 °C for 5 min. The sample was resolved using 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Atto, Tokyo, Japan). Membranes were blocked with Western Blocking Reagent (Roche), which was diluted with 50 μm Tris-buffered saline (TBS), and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washing with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated with HRP-linked secondary antibodies for 1 h at 20 °C. After incubation with secondary antibodies, signals were visualized as chemiluminescence by ECL Western blotting substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and detected using WSE-6100 LuminoGraph (Atto). Chemiluminescence intensity was calculated using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). All antibodies were diluted 1:1,000. To assess the viability of THP-1 macrophages reacted with LPS and polyP-65, we performed a cell viability assay using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) (DOJINDO, Kumamoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol (18Tominaga H. Ishiyama M. Ohseto F. Sasamoto K. Hamamoto T. Suzuki K. Watanabe M. A water-soluble tetrazolium salt useful for colorimetric cell viability assay.Anal. Commun. 1999; 36: 47-5010.1039/a809656bCrossref Scopus (456) Google Scholar). THP-1 macrophages were incubated with a 1.0 μm concentration of either the NF-κB inhibitor BAY11–7082 (Sigma–Aldrich) or the TLR4 inhibitor TAK-242 (Sigma–Aldrich) for 1 h before incubation with LPS and polyP. After incubation, levels of cytokines in cell supernatant were measured using ELISA kits as described above. THP-1 cells were seeded in 8-well culture slides (Corning, Inc., Corning, NY) and differentiated to macrophages as described above. Differentiated cells were incubated with or without 1.0 μg/ml biotinylated LPS (In vivo Gen, San Diego, CA) and/or polyP-65 (50 μm) for 3 h. Cells were then washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with FITC-labeled anti-biotin rabbit polyclonal antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 1 h at 20–25 °C (diluted 1:500). After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with rhodamine phalloidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to visualize F-actin. Stained cells were mounted with HardSet Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Images were acquired using a FV1200 confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The fluorescence intensity was quantified using ImageJ software. THP-1 macrophages were incubated with biotinylated LPS with or without polyP-65 (50 μm) for 3 h. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with FITC-labeled anti-biotin rabbit polyclonal antibody for 1 h at room temperature (diluted 1:500). After washing with PBS, cells were collected and washed with FACS buffer (3% FBS and 0.01% sodium azide in PBS). Flow cytometric analysis was performed with FACSCalibur using Cell Quest Pro software (BD Biosciences). Analysis was performed after 10,000 counting events. The mean fluorescence intensity value was used to estimate LPS levels in cells. Binding of LPS to TLR4 was assessed using a highly sensitive 27-MHz instrument (AFFINIX Q8, ULVAC, Kanagawa, Japan) as described previously (19Hori Y. Aoki N. Kuwahara S. Hosojima M. Kaseda R. Goto S. Iida T. De S. Kabasawa H. Kaneko R. Aoki H. Tanabe Y. Kagamu H. Narita I. Kikuchi T. Saito A. Megalin blockade with cilastatin suppresses drug-induced nephrotoxicity.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2017; 28 (28052987): 1783-179110.1681/ASN.2016060606Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, QCM sensor chips were prepared using the immobilization kit for AFFINIX (ULVAC) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Recombinant human TLR4 (50 μg/ml), MD2 (50 μg/ml), and CD14 (50 μg/ml) (R&D Systems) were then immobilized on the sensor chip. The sensor chips were soaked in distilled water in the incubation chamber. LPS was injected into the chamber in the presence or absence of polyP-65 for binding to TLR4. The resonance frequency of QCM at equilibrium was defined as the zero position. The stability and drift of the 27-MHz QCM frequency in solution were ±3 Hz. Binding affinity was determined by the frequency change following injection of each sample. Kinetic analysis between LPS and polyP-65 was performed using repetitive injection of LPS and LPS with polyP-65 as described previously (20Takakusagi Y. Kobayashi S. Sugawara F. Camptothecin binds to a synthetic peptide identified by a T7 phage display screen.Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2005; 15 (16122925): 4850-485310.1016/j.bmcl.2005.07.017Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). AQUA software (ULVAC) was used to calculate the kinetic parameters. DLS measurements were performed with 0.01 mg/ml LPS solutions containing varying concentrations of polyP-65, 10 mm NaPi (pH 7), and 150 mm NaCl at 37 °C using Zetasizer μV (Malvern Panalytical, Worcestershire, UK). Intensity distribution data were mathematically converted into volume distribution data, which were fitted by Gaussian curves to evaluate the fraction of distinct components. ITC measurements were performed using a VP-ITC instrument (MicroCal, Northampton, MA) at neutral pH (H2O) at 25 °C and 37 °C. Five microliters of 20 μm polyP-65 in a syringe was titrated into 0.01 mg/ml LPS in the ITC cell. For control experiments, 5 μl of 20 μm polyP-65 was titrated into H2O, or 5 μl of H2O was titrated into 0.01 mg/ml LPS. During ITC experiments, 20 successive injections were performed 180 s apart, and the cell was continuously stirred at 633 rpm. ITC data were analyzed using Origin software. The thermodynamic parameters were obtained from the integrated heat using a single set of binding sites model. Data were expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed by Student’s t test when only two value sets were compared. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni’s multiple-comparison test was used to compare three or more groups. The number of biological samples (n) for each group and the utilized statistical tests are indicated in the corresponding figure legends. Differences in means were considered statistically significant if p < 0.05. No exclusion criteria were incorporated in the design of the experiments for this study. T. I., S. Y., K. Y., M. S., Y.

https://openalex.org/W3004421631,"The prevalence of overweight and obesity, particularly among women, is increasing in Nepal. Previous studies in the South Asia have found television watching to be a risk factor for overweight and obesity among women of reproductive age. However, this association had not been studied in the context of Nepal. This study aims to identify the association between frequency of television watching and overweight and obesity among Nepalese women of reproductive age.This cross-sectional study utilized the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey 2016 (NDHS 2016) data. A total weighted sample of 6,031 women were included in the final analyses. The women were 15-49 years of age and were either not pregnant or had not delivered a child within the two months prior to the survey. Body mass index (BMI) was the primary outcome of this study, which was categorized using an Asia-specific cutoff value. Normal and/or underweight was defined as a BMI <23.0 kg/m2, overweight was defined as a BMI between 23.0 kg/m2 and <27.5 kg/m2, and obesity was defined as a BMI ≥27.5 kg/m2. Frequency of watching television was the main independent variable of this study, which was divided into the following three categories: not watching television at all, watching television less than once a week, and watching television at least once a week. Multilevel ordered logistic regression was conducted to find the factors associated with overweight and obesity. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant in the final model.Around 35% of the participants were overweight or obese (overweight: 23.7% and obese: 11.6%). A majority of the study participants was aged between 15 and 24 years (36.5%), and resided in an urban area (63.2%), Province No. 3 (22.3%), and the Terai ecological region (49.5%). Around one-third (34.0%) of the participants received no formal education while an almost similar proportion (35.5%) completed secondary education. Approximately half of the study participants (50.6%) reported watching television at least once a week, whereas more than a quarter (28.7%) of them did not watch television at all. Women who watched television at least once a day had a higher prevalence of overweight and obesity than the other groups (p-value <0.0001). Women who watched television at least once a week were 1.3 times more likely to be overweight or obese in comparison to women who never watched television (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 1.3, 95% CI: 1.0-1.7; p-value <0.05). In the urban areas, women who watched television at least once a week were 40% more likely to be overweight or obese than those who did not watch television at all (AOR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.7; p-value <0.01). No significant association between overweight and obesity and the frequency of viewing television was observed in the rural area.Watching television at least once a week is associated with overweight and obesity in women of reproductive age living in the urban areas of Nepal. Public health promotion programs should raise awareness among women regarding harmful health consequences of sedentary lifestyle due to television watching."
https://openalex.org/W3005890904,"Despite its high ecological importance, the commensal interactions at community level are poorly studied. In tropical dry forests (TDF) there is a great diversity of species adapted to the high seasonality that characterizes them; however, little is known regarding how the spatial and temporal availability of resources generates changes in the pattern of commensal interactions. We experimentally studied changes in the diversity, composition, and pattern of interactions in spatio-temporal associations between the saproxylophagous beetles and their host trees in a TDF in Morelos, Mexico. A total of 65 host tree species were selected, from which 16 wood sections were obtained per species. These sections were exposed in the field to allow oviposition by the cerambycids under four different (spatio-temporal) treatments. We analyzed the network structure and generated indices at species level (i.e., specialization, species strength, and effective partners) and those related to physical characteristics of the wood (hardness and degradation rate) and the cerambycids (body size). In total, 1,323 individuals of 57 species of cerambycids emerged. Our results showed that, independently of the space and time, the network presented a nested and modular structure, with a high specialization degree and a high turnover of cerambycid species and their interactions. In general, we found that the cerambycids are mostly associated with softwood species with a lower decomposition rate of wood, as well as with the most abundant host species. The commensalistic interactions between the cerambycids and their host trees are highly specialized but are not spatio-temporally static. The high turnover in the interactions is caused by the emergence patterns of cerambycids, which seem to restrict their use to certain species. The knowledge of the spatio-temporal variation in Cerambycidae-host tree interactions allows us to predict how environmental and structural changes in the habitat can modify the species ensemble, and therefore its interactions."

The best known mechanism of cell death in ARHL is apoptosis due to increased production of reactive oxygen species. In this context, it is hypothesized that melatonin, owing to its high antioxidant potential and its action in the mitochondria, helps prevent or delay outer hair cell dysfunction (HCD).To evaluate the effect of melatonin on the prevention of HCD dysfunction in the ARHL process in a susceptible murine C57BL/6J model.C57BL/6J animals were divided into two groups: control (CG) and melatonin (MG). The CG received a saline and ethanol solution and the MG, melatonin (10 mg/kg/day). The solutions were offered daily (50 μl) orally over a 10-month period. Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAE) measurements were conducted once a month.There was a decrease in DPOAE values in both groups over time and a differentiation between them from the 10th month of life onwards. At 10 months, the MG maintained higher DPOAE values than the CG at all frequencies tested.The use of melatonin has otoprotective effects on HCD in the ARHL process in the C57BL/6J model."
https://openalex.org/W3006450065,"Recent studies indicated that intramammary administration of active vitamin D3 hormone (1,25D3) inhibits the inflammatory process associated with mastitis. We hypothesized that attenuation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by 1,25D3 in mammary epithelial cells (MECs) is an important cellular mechanism contributing to this beneficial effect of intramammary treatment with 1,25D3. To test this hypothesis, the effect of 1,25D3 was studied on induction of ER stress in a transformed human MEC line, MCF-7 cells. Treatment with two different ER stress inducers, thapsigargin (TG) and tunicamycin (TM), caused a dose-dependent induction of ER stress as evident from up-regulation of protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK), heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 5 (HSPA5), activating transcription factor (ATF4), ATF6, DNA damage inducible transcript 3 (DDIT3) and spliced X-box binding protein 1 (sXBP1) and impaired cell viability and decreased expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR) in MCF-7 cells (P < 0.05). Treatment with 1,25D3 (100 nM) inhibited TG (10 nM)- and TM (1 μg/mL)-induced mRNA and/or protein levels of ATF4, ATF6, DDIT3 and HSPA5 in MCF-7 cells (P < 0.05). In addition, 1,25D3 (100 nM) antagonized the effect of TG (10 nM) and TM (1 μg/mL) on mRNA and protein levels of VDR and mRNA levels of genes involved in production and degradation of 1,25D3 in MCF-7 cells (P < 0.05). Moreover, 1,25D3 (100 nM) inhibited nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation in response to TM (10 nM) and TG (1 μg/mL) in MCF-7 cells. In conclusion, the present findings show that 1,25D3 is effective in attenuating ER stress and the NF-κB-driven inflammatory response in MCF-7 cells. This indicates that attenuation of ER stress by 1,25D3 in MECs may contribute to the recently observed inhibitory effect of intramammary treatment of dairy cows with 1,25D3 on the inflammatory process associated with mastitis."
https://openalex.org/W3006630734,"Objective To analyze the effect of adjuvant oral application of honey for treating postoperative pain after tonsillectomy. Design Single centre prospective cohort study. Setting Two cohorts of patients after tonsillectomy. Participants 56 patients treated with honey 8 times per day (honey group), 18 patients treated without honey (control group); baseline analgesia were non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) or coxibs; opioids were used as pro re nata (PRN) medication; mean age 34.4 ± 13.4 years; 36% women. Main outcome measures On first to fifth postoperative day, patients rated their pain using the validated questionnaire of the German-wide project Quality Improvement in Postoperative Pain Treatment (QUIPS) including a numeric rating scale (NRS, 0–10) for determination of patient's pain. QUIPS allows standardized assessment of patients' characteristics andpain-associated patient-reported outcomes (PROs). The influence of preoperative and postoperative parameters on patients' postoperative pain were estimated by univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. Results Average pain in activity in the control group was greater than 4 (NRS 4.4 ± 2.4) during the first five postoperative days, with a renewed increase in pain intensity on the fifth day (4.3 ± 2.5). In the honey group, the pain in activity decreased without any further pain increase and was only higher than 4 on the first three postoperative days (4.3 ± 2.1, all p>0.05). However; neither minimal nor maximal pain were significantly different between both groups on the first postoperative day (p = 0.217, p = 0.980). Over the five postoperative days, the minimal and maximal pain in the honey group decreased continuously and faster than in the control group. With regard to pain-related impairments on the first day, the honey group reported less pain-related sleep disturbance (p = 0.026), as well as significantly fewer episodes of postoperative oral bleeding (p = 0.028) than the control group. Patients without honey consumption had on the first and fifth postoperative day a higher risk of increased minimal pain (OR = -2.424, CI = -4.075 –-0.385). Gender was an independent factor for compliance of honey consumption on the second postoperative day (p = 0.037). Men had a lower probability for compliance of honey consumption (OR = -0.288, CI = -2.863 –-0.090). Conclusion There was a trend of reduced postoperative pain after oral honey application. Honey also seems to reduce pain-related impairments. The need for additional opioids on the first day could be reduced. A larger controlled trial is now needed to varify the effect of honey on pain after tonsillectomy. Clinical trial registration number German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00006153. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this drug/intervention are registered."

Compared to Western populations, the median age of diagnosis of breast cancer is much lower in Algeria. The objective of this study is to explore the expression of several miRNAs reported to be deregulated in breast cancer. The miRNAs miR-21, miR-125b, miR-100, miR-425-5p, miR-200c, miR-183 and miR-182 were studied on tumor and normal adjacent Algerian breast tissues using quantitative reverse transcription real time PCR, and the results were analyzed according to clinical characteristics. Compared to the normal adjacent tissues, miR-21, miR-183, miR-182, miR-425-5p and miR-200c were found to be upregulated while miR-100 and miR-125b were insignificantly deregulated. A positive correlation was noted among miR-183, miR-182 and miR-200c and among miR-425-5p, miR-183, miR-200c and miR-21. Further global miRNA microarray profiling studies can aid in finding ethnic specific miRNA biomarkers in the Algerian breast cancer population."
https://openalex.org/W3004762280,"Background Health care planners need to predict demand for hospital beds to avoid deterioration in health care. Seasonal demand can be affected by respiratory illnesses which in England are monitored using syndromic surveillance systems. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between syndromic data and daily emergency hospital admissions. Methods We compared the timing of peaks in syndromic respiratory indicators and emergency hospital admissions, between 2013 and 2018. Furthermore, we created forecasts for daily admissions and investigated their accuracy when real-time syndromic data were included. Results We found that syndromic indicators were sensitive to changes in the timing of peaks in seasonal disease, especially influenza. However, each year, peak demand for hospital beds occurred on either 29th or 30th December, irrespective of the timing of syndromic peaks. Most forecast models using syndromic indicators explained over 70% of the seasonal variation in admissions (adjusted R square value). Forecast errors were reduced when syndromic data were included. For example, peak admissions for December 2014 and 2017 were underestimated when syndromic data were not used in models. Conclusion Due to the lack of variability in the timing of the highest seasonal peak in hospital admissions, syndromic surveillance data do not provide additional early warning of timing. However, during atypical seasons syndromic data did improve the accuracy of forecast intensity."

This study investigates the influence of these shared illness narratives on patient’s working lives, by examining the impact of reading a positive work story versus negative work story on patients’ sustainable employability. We expected that this relationship would be mediated by positive emotions and the extent to which the story enhanced awareness of desires future selves, and moderated by identification with story character. An online field experiment with 166 people with Inflammatory Bowel Disease in The Netherlands showed that while reading a positive story of a patient with the same condition significantly increased positive emotions, these emotions did not influence sustainable employability. However, reading a positive story was related to higher sustainable employability when patients became more aware of their desired possible future work selves. Finally, identification with the story character moderated the impact of story type on sustainable employability. This study showed that personal engagement with a positive work story of a fellow patient is related to higher sustainable employability. Findings can be helpful for health professionals to empower employees with a chronic disease."
https://openalex.org/W3006568424,"Co-infection with Visceral Leishmaniasis (commonly known as Kala Azar, KA) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is increasingly being diagnosed among patients in Bihar. This qualitative study is the first assessment of self-reported quality of life among patients co-infected with KA-HIV in the Asian context.We conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews and adopted an inductive thematic analysis to generate evidence on the quality of life of patients co-infected with KA and HIV. Patients were purposively sampled until saturation was attained.We found that patients highly valued income or livelihood potential and health as indicators of a good quality life, and routinely went into debt accessing care in the private setup. This was due to perceptions of poor quality of care in the government setup and a lack of knowledge regarding available government services at the district level. KA symptoms were often misdiagnosed in the private sector as seasonal fever, while care providers found it difficult to disentangle the clinical symptoms of KA and HIV; hence, patients presented late to district hospitals. Patients perceived a high level of stigma, largely due to their HIV status, and routinely reported that HIV had ""destroyed"" their life.Inadequate social support and referral pathways that were not conducive to patient needs negatively impacted patients' quality of life. The dual burden of poverty interacting with the severity and chronicity of KA-HIV co-infection means financial support, increased community engagement, and collaborative decision making are crucial for co-infected patients. Increased provider awareness of co-infection and effective stigma-reduction interventions should be integrated to ensure that appropriate and effective access to care is possible for this vulnerable population. A sustainable long-term strategy requires a people-centered approach wherein the perceptions and life circumstances of patients are taken into account in the medical decision making process."
https://openalex.org/W3005151153,"In order to accomplish their physiological functions leukocytes have the capability to migrate. As a prerequisite they need to adopt a polarized cell shape, forming a leading edge at the front and a uropod at rear pole. In this study we explored the capability of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells to adopt this leukocyte-specific migration phenotype. Furthermore, we studied the impact of the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonists CpGs type A, B and C and the antagonist oligodesoxynucleotide (ODN) INH-18 on the cell polarization and migration process of primary human CLL cells. Upon cultivation, a portion of purified CLL cells adopted polarized cell shapes spontaneously (range 10–38%). Stimulation with CpG ODNs type B (ODN 2006) and CpGs type C (ODN 2395) significantly increased the frequency of morphologically polarized CLL cells, while ODN INH-18 was hardly able to act antagonistically. Like in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, in morphologically polarized CLL cells CXCR4 was redistributed to the leading edge and CD50 to the uropod. Coupled to the increased frequencies of morphologically polarized cells, CpGs type B and C stimulated CLL cells showed higher migration activities in vitro and following intravenous injection higher homing frequencies to the bone marrow of immunocompromised NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice. Thus, presumably independent of TLR-9 signaling, CpGs type B and C promote the cellular polarization process of CLL cells and their ability to migrate in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3005860003,"Neoantigens can be predicted and in some cases identified using the data obtained from the whole exome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing of tumor cells. These sequencing data can be coupled with single-cell RNA sequencing for the direct interrogation of the transcriptome, surfaceome, and pairing of αβ T-cell receptors (TCRαβ) from hundreds of single T cells. Using these 2 large datasets, we established a platform for identifying antigens recognized by TCRαβs obtained from single T cells. Our approach is based on the rapid expression of cloned TCRαβ genes as Sleeping Beauty transposons and the determination of the introduced TCRαβs’ antigen specificity and avidity using a reporter cell line. The platform enables the very rapid identification of tumor-reactive TCRs for the bioengineering of T cells with redirected specificity."
https://openalex.org/W3005919661,"Although sacrocolpopexy (SCP) can provide durable apical support, the use of mesh may give rise to various complications, including vaginal mesh erosion. The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors for vaginal mesh erosion after SCP in Korean women.This retrospective cohort study included 363 women who underwent SCP with type 1 polypropylene mesh. They were evaluated at 1, 4, and 12 months after surgery and then annually thereafter with respect to anatomy and complications. Univariate and multivariate analyses using the Cox proportional hazard model were performed to identify the risk factors for mesh erosion.During the median 2-year follow-up period, vaginal mesh erosion was found in 29 women (8.0%). Among them, 19 (65.5%) required surgical correction. Estrogenic status was the only independent risk factor for mesh erosion. The risk for mesh erosion was 4.5 times higher in premenopausal women than in menopausal women not on estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) (95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.9-10.9, p<0.01). Menopausal women on ERT also had an increased risk, with a statistically marginal significance (hazard ratio 2.5, 95% CI 0.9-6.6; p = 0.07).Premenopausal or menopausal women on ERT are at high risk for mesh erosion after SCP with type 1 polypropylene mesh, and two-thirds of mesh erosion cases require reoperation. This information should be incorporated into patient counseling and treatment decisions."
https://openalex.org/W3006314891,"A key challenge in the field of cognitive neuroscience is to identify discriminable cognitive functions, and then map these functions to brain activity. In the current study, we set out to explore the relationships between performance arising from different cognitive tasks thought to tap different domains of cognition, and then to test whether these distinct latent cognitive abilities also are subserved by corresponding “latent” brain substrates. To this end, we tested a large sample of adults under the age of 40 on twelve cognitive tasks as they underwent fMRI scanning. Exploratory factor analysis revealed 4-factor model, dissociating tasks into processes corresponding to episodic memory retrieval, reasoning, speed of processing and vocabulary. An analysis of the topographic covariance patterns of the BOLD-response acquired during each task similarity also converged on four neural networks that corresponded to the 4 latent factors. These results suggest that distinct ontologies of cognition are subserved by corresponding distinct neural networks."
https://openalex.org/W3006432124,"Counting chromosomes is the first step towards a better understanding of the karyotype evolution and the role of chromosome evolution in species diversification within Carex; however, the chromosome count is not known yet for numerous sedges. In this paper chromosome counts were performed for 23 Carex taxa from Armenia, Austria, the Czech Republic, and Poland. Chromosome numbers were determined for the first time in three species (Carex cilicica, 2n = 54; C. phyllostachys, 2n = 56; C. randalpina, 2n = 78), two subspecies (C. muricata subsp. ashokae, 2n = 58; C. nigra subsp. transcaucasica, 2n = 84) and two hybrids (C. ×decolorans, 2n = 74; C. ×walasii, 2n = 108). Among the taxa whose number of chromosomes had been known before, the largest difference was found in C. hartmaniorum (here 2n = 52) and C. aterrima subsp. medwedewii (here 2n = 52). A difference in the chromosome count was demonstrated for C. cilicica (2n = 54) versus the species of the section Aulocystis (2n = 30 to 40) and for C. tomentosa (2n = 48) versus the species of the section Acrocystis (2n = 18 to 38). The results of this study indicate that the position of C. cilicica in Aulocystis section may raise doubts. Attention was paid to the relationship between C. phyllostachys and taxa of the subgenus Carex section Gynobasidae."
https://openalex.org/W3004633898,"Perennial ryegrass is an important feed base for the dairy and livestock industries around the world. It is often infected with mutualistic fungal endophytes that confer protection to the plant against biotic and abiotic stresses. Bioassays that test their antibiotic effect on invertebrates are varied and range from excised leaves to whole plants. The aim of this study was to design and validate a “high-throughput” in-planta bioassay using 7-day-old seedlings confined in small cups, allowing for rapid assessments of aphid life history to be made while maintaining high replication and treatment numbers. Antibiosis was evaluated on the foliar and the root aphid species; Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko) and Aploneura lentisci (Passerini) feeding on a range of perennial ryegrass–Epichloë festucae var. Lolii endophyte symbiota. As expected, both D. noxia and A. lentisci reared on endophyte-infected plants showed negatively affected life history traits by comparison to non-infected plants. Both species exhibited the highest mortality at the nymphal stage with an average total mortality across all endophyte treatments of 91% and 89% for D. noxia and A. lentisci respectively. Fecundity decreased significantly on all endophyte treatments with an average total reduction of 18% and 16% for D. noxia and A. lentisci respectively by comparison to non-infected plants. Overall, the bioassay proved to be a rapid method of evaluating the insecticidal activity of perennial ryegrass–endophyte symbiota on aphids (nymph mortality could be assessed in as little as 24 and 48 hours for D. noxia and A. lentisci respectively). This rapid and simple approach can be used to benchmark novel grass–endophyte symbiota on a range of aphid species that feed on leaves of plants, however we would caution that it may not be suitable for the assessment of root-feeding aphids, as this species exhibited relatively high mortality on the control as well."
https://openalex.org/W3004905186,"There is no acknowledged reference interval of mesenteric lymph node size in healthy children, and the size criterion for mesenteric lymph node enlargement (MLNE) has long been controversial. This study aimed to explore the reference intervals of mesenteric lymph node size according to lymphocyte counts in asymptomatic children and to develop a more appropriate definition of MLNE. The asymptomatic children included were divided into five age strata: 2 to 3 yr; 3 to 4 yr; 4 to 5 yr; 5 to 6 yr; and 6 to 7 yr. Correlation analyses between lymphocyte counts and the long-axis diameter, short-axis diameter, and average diameter of the largest mesenteric lymph node (LMLN) were performed. A reference interval of the short-axis diameter of LMLN was established according to this correlation analysis in each age group. We also report a reference interval of lymphocyte count in each age group. This study revealed significant correlations between the short-axis diameter of LMLN and lymphocyte count in all age groups, as well as in subdivided boy groups and girl groups. The overall reference interval of the short-axis diameter of LMLN in children was 0.54 cm—1.03 cm, with mean value of 0.75 cm. This study supports the use of the short-axis diameter greater than 8–10 mm as the diagnostic criterion for primary mesenteric lymphadenitis based on the presence of a cluster of three or more mesenteric lymph nodes and in the absence of other abnormalities."
https://openalex.org/W3006479072,"Sterile protection against malaria, most likely mediated by parasite-specific CD8+ T cells, has been achieved by attenuated sporozoite vaccination of animals as well as malaria-naïve and malaria-exposed subjects. The circumsporozoite protein (CSP)-based vaccine, RTS,S, shows low efficacy partly due to limited CD8+ T cell induction, and inclusion of such epitopes could improve RTS,S. This study assessed 8-10mer CSP peptide epitopes, present in predicted or previously positive P. falciparum 3D7 CSP 15mer overlapping peptide pools, for their ability to induce CD8+ T cell IFN-γ responses in natural malaria-exposed subjects.Cryopreserved PBMCs from nine HLA-typed subjects were stimulated with 23 8-10mer CSP peptides from the 3D7 parasite in IFN-ɣ ELISpot assays. The CD8+ T cell specificity of IFN-γ responses was confirmed in ELISpot assays using CD8+ T cell-enriched PBMC fractions after CD4+ cell depletion.Ten of 23 peptide epitopes elicited responses in whole PBMCs from five of the nine subjects. Four peptides tested positive in CD8+ T cell-enriched PBMCs from two previously positive responders and one new subject. All four immunodominant peptides are restricted by globally common HLA supertypes (A02, A03, B07) and mapped to regions of the CSP antigen with limited or no reported polymorphism. Association of these peptide-specific responses with anti-malarial protection remains to be confirmed.The relatively conserved nature of the four identified epitopes and their binding to globally common HLA supertypes makes them good candidates for inclusion in potential multi-epitope malaria vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W3005889300,"Colorectal cancer incidence in Spain increased considerably between the early nineties and 2010. To reverse this tendency, screenings were progressively implemented starting the year 2001, targeting the population aged 50 to 69 years.This study aimed to update colorectal cancer incidence and mortality trends in Spain and provide a detailed analysis of disease management and risk factors involved in in-hospital mortality.To this aim, anonymised primary and specialised care admission records from 2011 to 2016 were extracted from a Spanish claims database representative of all Spanish regions.Primary care files from 37,317 patients and specialised care files from 192,048 patients were obtained, in which males represented the 56.17% and 60.70% of patients respectively. In-hospital mortality rate was 10.07% and remained stable during the study period, similarly to colorectal cancer incidence within the hospitalised population, which was 106 per 10,000 patients. Patients deceased during the hospitalisation presented an increased presence of metastatic tumours. Mean length of hospital stay decreased significantly over the study period from 13.43 days to 11.67 days (p<0.001), similarly to patients' 30-day readmission rate, which registered a decrease from the 15.29% to 13.58% (p<0.001). In consequence, the direct medical cost measured per patient, of €10,992, decreased over time. The implementation of colorectal cancer screening programmes caused a significant decrease in the number of new diagnoses in patients aged 75 to 79 years that may be attributable to the implementation of colorectal cancer screening programmes; however, in-hospital mortality was not reduced. Metastatic tumours and other conditions as anaemia are associated with higher in-hospital mortality rates."
https://openalex.org/W3005958819,"To estimate the prevalence and associated factors of rotator cuff tear (RCT) in patients with hand osteoarthritis (HOA).Between June 2013 and December 2015, we recruited 1150 participants in rural area of South Korea. Of the 1150 participants, 307 participants with HOA were analyzed. Plain radiography of both hands, magnetic resonance imaging of both shoulders, and serum levels of high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) were obtained for all patients. HOA and RCT were diagnosed by clinical and radiologic findings.The prevalence of RCT in patients with HOA (192/307, 62.5%) was higher than that in those without HOA (410/827, 49.5%, p<0.001). Among the 307 patients with HOA, the patients with RCT were older, and had higher hsCRP and lower HDL levels than the patients without RCT. Multiple logistic regression analysis confirmed significant associations of age (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.11), serum hsCRP levels ≥0.6mg/L (OR, 1.68; CI, 1.00-2.80), and low HDL levels (male, <50 mg/dL; female, <40 mg/dL) (OR, 1.93; CI, 1.05-3.56) with RCT in patients with HOA. For patients below 60 years old, the prevalence of RCT was 2.8-fold higher in the low HDL group than normal HDL group (p = 0.048). Finally, the prevalence of RCT was 2.6-fold higher in patients with HOA with both elevated hsCRP and low HDL levels compared with those with neither (p<0.05).Our findings suggest inflammation and metabolic factors were associated with the prevalence of RCT in HOA patients."
https://openalex.org/W3006429634,"To compare image quality and metal artifact reduction between virtual monochromatic spectral imaging (VMSI), linearly blended dual-energy (DE) and single-energy (SE) images, each with and without dedicated iterative metal artifact reduction (iMAR) for CT-guided biopsy.A biopsy trocar was positioned in the liver of six pigs. DE (Sn140/100kVp) and SE (120kVp/200mAs) acquisitions were performed with equivalent dose. From dual-energy datasets DE Q30-3 images and VMSI between 40-180 keV in steps of 20 keV were generated. From SE datasets I30-3 images were reconstructed. All images were reconstructed with and without iMAR. Objective image quality was analyzed applying density measurements at standardized positions (e.g. trocar tip and liver parenchyma adjacent to the trocar tip) and semi-automated threshold based segmentation. Subjective image quality was performed using semi-quantitative scores. Analyses were performed by two observers.At the trocar tip quantitative image analysis revealed significant difference in CT numbers between reconstructions with iMAR compared to reconstructions without iMAR for VMSI at lower keV levels (80 and 100 keV; p = 0.03) and DE (p = 0.03). For liver parenchyma CT numbers were significantly higher in VMSI at high keV compared to low keV (p≤0.01). VMSI at high keV also showed higher CT numbers compared to DE and SE images, though not the level of statistical significance. The best signal-to-noise ratio for VMSI was at 80 keV and comparable to DE and SE. Noise was lowest at 80 keV and lower than in DE and SE. Subjective image quality was best with VMSI at 80 keV regardless of the application of iMAR. iMAR significantly improved image quality at levels of 140 keV and 160 keV. Interreader-agreement was good for quantitative and qualitative analysis.iMAR improved image quality in all settings. VMSI with iMAR provided metal artifact reduction and better image quality at 80 keV and thus could improve the accurate positioning in CT-guided needle biopsy. In comparison, DE imaging did not improve image quality compared to SE."
https://openalex.org/W3004780484,"The manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum is widely distributed in the sandy mud sediments of tidal flats and plays a role in seawater purification by filtering suspended organic matter. This study was designed to evaluate differences in seawater purification based on the filtration rate of the manila clam in terms of particulate organic matter (POM) between two tidal flats with different hydrographic regimes. In situ experiments were carried out at Geunso and Sihwa tidal flats, along the west coast of Korea. The amount of POM removed from the water column by the feeding activity of the clam was measured in the field using a closed circulation chamber. The filtration rate of clams for POM at Sihwa tidal flat (2.86 for POC, 2.29 for PON and 5.46 L h-1 gDW-1 for Chl a) was higher than that at Geunso tidal flat (0.61 for POC, 0.89 for PON and 2.54 L h-1 gDW-1 for Chl a) which resulted from differences in the hydrographic regime, including tide characteristics, current speed and submergence time, and food quantity and quality. The current speed was much greater at Geunso tidal flat than at Sihwa tidal flat, but the submergence time by tide was longer at the latter site than the former, resulting in different feeding times for clams. The food quantity in terms of chlorophyll a was higher at Sihwa tidal flat than at Geunso tidal flat, and the food quality based on the C/N ratio of POM was better at the former site than the latter, with values of 12.8 and 15.6, respectively. These findings suggest that hydrographic regime could be important in understanding in situ filtration rates of R. philippinarum."
https://openalex.org/W3005811144,"Objective The need to align investments in health research and development (R&D) with public health needs is one of the most important public health challenges in Japan. We examined the alignment of disease-specific publicly competitive R&D funding to the disease burden in the country. Methods We analyzed publicly available data on competitive public funding for health in 2015 and 2016 and compared it to disability-adjusted life year (DALYs) in 2016, which were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 study. Their alignment was assessed as a percentage distribution among 22 GBD disease groups. Funding was allocated to the 22 disease groups based on natural language processing, using textual information such as project title and abstract for each research project, while considering for the frequency of information. Results Total publicly competitive funding in health R&D in 2015 and 2016 reached 344.1 billion JPY (about 3.0 billion USD) for 32,204 awarded projects. About 49.5% of the funding was classifiable for disease-specific projects. Five GDB disease groups were significantly and relatively well-funded compared to their contributions to Japan’s DALY, including neglected tropical diseases and malaria (funding vs DALY = 1.7% vs 0.0%, p<0.01) and neoplasms (28.5% vs 19.2%, p<0.001). In contrast, four GDB disease groups were significantly under-funded, including cardiovascular diseases (8.0% vs 14.8%, p<0.001) and musculoskeletal disorders (1.0% vs 11.9%, p<0.001). These percentages do not include unclassifiable funding. Conclusions While caution is necessary as this study was not able to consider public in-house funding and the methodological uncertainties could not be ruled out, the analysis may provide a snapshot of the limited alignment between publicly competitive disease-specific funding and the disease burden in the country. The results call for greater management over the allocation of scarce resources on health R&D. DALYs will serve as a crucial, but not the only, consideration in aligning Japan's research priorities with the public health needs. In addition, the algorithms for natural language processing used in this study require continued efforts to improve accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W3006348154,"DNAM-1 (CD226) is an activating immunoreceptor expressed on T cells and NK cells and involved in the pathogenesis of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). We previously reported that a soluble form of DNAM-1 (sDNAM-1) is generated by shedding from activated T cells. Moreover, higher serum levels of sDNAM-1 in patients before allo-HSCT is a predictive biomarker for the development of aGVHD based on the retrospective univariate and multivariate analyses in allo-HSCT patients. However, it remains unclear how the serum levels of sDNAM-1 are regulated after allo-HSCT and whether they are associated with the development of aGVHD. Here, we constructed a mathematical model to assess the dynamics of sDNAM-1 after allo-HSCT by assuming that there are three types of sDNAM-1 (the first and the second were from alloreactive and non-alloreactive donor lymphocytes, respectively, and the third from recipient lymphocytes). Our mathematical model fitted well to the data set of sDNAM-1 in patients (n = 67) who had undergone allo-HSCT and suggest that the high proportion of the first type of sDNAM-1 to the total of the first and second types is associated with high risk of the development of severe aGVHD. Thus, sDNAM-1 after allo-HSCT can be a biomarker for the development of aGVHD."
