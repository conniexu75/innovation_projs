https://openalex.org/W1975360381,"About 300 experiments have tried to determine the value of the Newtonian gravitational constant, G, so far, but large discrepancies in the results have made it impossible to know its value precisely. The weakness of the gravitational interaction and the impossibility of shielding the effects of gravity make it very difficult to measure G while keeping systematic effects under control. Most previous experiments performed were based on the torsion pendulum or torsion balance scheme as in the experiment by Cavendish in 1798, and in all cases macroscopic masses were used. Here we report the precise determination of G using laser-cooled atoms and quantum interferometry. We obtain the value G=6.67191(99) x 10^(-11) m^3 kg^(-1) s^(-2) with a relative uncertainty of 150 parts per million (the combined standard uncertainty is given in parentheses). Our value differs by 1.5 combined standard deviations from the current recommended value of the Committee on Data for Science and Technology. A conceptually different experiment such as ours helps to identify the systematic errors that have proved elusive in previous experiments, thus improving the confidence in the value of G. There is no definitive relationship between G and the other fundamental constants, and there is no theoretical prediction for its value, against which to test experimental results. Improving the precision with which we know G has not only a pure metrological interest, but is also important because of the key role that G has in theories of gravitation, cosmology, particle physics and astrophysics and in geophysical models."
https://openalex.org/W2073060607,"The emergence and spread of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogens is a global public health problem. The acquisition of metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) such as NDM-1 is a principle contributor to the emergence of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogens that threatens the use of penicillin, cephalosporin and carbapenem antibiotics to treat infections. To date, a clinical inhibitor of MBLs that could reverse resistance and re-sensitize resistant Gram-negative pathogens to carbapenems has not been found. Here we have identified a fungal natural product, aspergillomarasmine A (AMA), that is a rapid and potent inhibitor of the NDM-1 enzyme and another clinically relevant MBL, VIM-2. AMA also fully restored the activity of meropenem against Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas spp. possessing either VIM or NDM-type alleles. In mice infected with NDM-1-expressing Klebsiella pneumoniae, AMA efficiently restored meropenem activity, demonstrating that a combination of AMA and a carbapenem antibiotic has therapeutic potential to address the clinical challenge of MBL-positive carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W1984812591,"Nanopore sequencing of DNA is a single-molecule technique that may achieve long reads, low cost and high speed with minimal sample preparation and instrumentation. Here, we build on recent progress with respect to nanopore resolution and DNA control to interpret the procession of ion current levels observed during the translocation of DNA through the pore MspA. As approximately four nucleotides affect the ion current of each level, we measured the ion current corresponding to all 256 four-nucleotide combinations (quadromers). This quadromer map is highly predictive of ion current levels of previously unmeasured sequences derived from the bacteriophage phi X 174 genome. Furthermore, we show nanopore sequencing reads of phi X 174 up to 4,500 bases in length, which can be unambiguously aligned to the phi X 174 reference genome, and demonstrate proof-of-concept utility with respect to hybrid genome assembly and polymorphism detection. This work provides a foundation for nanopore sequencing of long, natural DNA strands."
https://openalex.org/W2019477751,"Polyketide natural products constitute a broad class of compounds with diverse structural features and biological activities. Their biosynthetic machinery, represented by type I polyketide synthases (PKSs), has an architecture in which successive modules catalyse two-carbon linear extensions and keto-group processing reactions on intermediates covalently tethered to carrier domains. Here we used electron cryo-microscopy to determine sub-nanometre-resolution three-dimensional reconstructions of a full-length PKS module from the bacterium Streptomyces venezuelae that revealed an unexpectedly different architecture compared to the homologous dimeric mammalian fatty acid synthase. A single reaction chamber provides access to all catalytic sites for the intramodule carrier domain. In contrast, the carrier from the preceding module uses a separate entrance outside the reaction chamber to deliver the upstream polyketide intermediate for subsequent extension and modification. This study reveals for the first time, to our knowledge, the structural basis for both intramodule and intermodule substrate transfer in polyketide synthases, and establishes a new model for molecular dissection of these multifunctional enzyme systems."
https://openalex.org/W2092317665,"To investigate the independent and interactive associations of physical activity (PA) and screen time (ST) with depression, anxiety and sleep quality among Chinese college students.A cross-sectional study was conducted in Wuhan University, China from November to December 2011. The students reported their PA, ST and socio-economic characteristics using self-administered questionnaires. Sleep quality was measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Depression and anxiety were assessed using the Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), respectively. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the independent and interactive relationships of PA and ST with depression, anxiety and sleep quality.A total of 1106 freshmen (471 females and 635 males) aged 18.9±0.9 years were included in the study. After adjustment for potential confounders, high PA and low ST were independently associated with significantly lower risks for poor sleep quality (OR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.30-0.78) and depression (OR: 0.67, 95%CI: 0.44-0.89), respectively. An interactive inverse association was observed for combined effects of PA and low ST on depression (OR: 0.62, 95%CI: 0.40-0.92) and sleep quality (OR: 0.51, 95%CI: 0.27-0.91). No statistically significant associations were found between PA, ST and anxiety among the participants.These findings suggest an independent and interactive relationship of high PA and low ST with significantly reduced prevalence of depressive problems and favorable sleep quality among Chinese college freshmen."
https://openalex.org/W1993107257,"The polyketide synthase (PKS) mega-enzyme assembly line uses a modular architecture to synthesize diverse and bioactive natural products that often constitute the core structures or complete chemical entities for many clinically approved therapeutic agents. The architecture of a full-length PKS module from the pikromycin pathway of Streptomyces venezuelae creates a reaction chamber for the intramodule acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain that carries building blocks and intermediates between acyltransferase, ketosynthase and ketoreductase active sites (see accompanying paper). Here we determine electron cryo-microscopy structures of a full-length pikromycin PKS module in three key biochemical states of its catalytic cycle. Each biochemical state was confirmed by bottom-up liquid chromatography/Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. The ACP domain is differentially and precisely positioned after polyketide chain substrate loading on the active site of the ketosynthase, after extension to the β-keto intermediate, and after β-hydroxy product generation. The structures reveal the ACP dynamics for sequential interactions with catalytic domains within the reaction chamber, and for transferring the elongated and processed polyketide substrate to the next module in the PKS pathway. During the enzymatic cycle the ketoreductase domain undergoes dramatic conformational rearrangements that enable optimal positioning for reductive processing of the ACP-bound polyketide chain elongation intermediate. These findings have crucial implications for the design of functional PKS modules, and for the engineering of pathways to generate pharmacologically relevant molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2097285525,"Heat-related mortality in US cities is expected to more than double by the mid-to-late 21st century. Rising heat exposure in cities is projected to result from: 1) climate forcings from changing global atmospheric composition; and 2) local land surface characteristics responsible for the urban heat island effect. The extent to which heat management strategies designed to lessen the urban heat island effect could offset future heat-related mortality remains unexplored in the literature. Using coupled global and regional climate models with a human health effects model, we estimate changes in the number of heat-related deaths in 2050 resulting from modifications to vegetative cover and surface albedo across three climatically and demographically diverse US metropolitan areas: Atlanta, Georgia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Phoenix, Arizona. Employing separate health impact functions for average warm season and heat wave conditions in 2050, we find combinations of vegetation and albedo enhancement to offset projected increases in heat-related mortality by 40 to 99% across the three metropolitan regions. These results demonstrate the potential for extensive land surface changes in cities to provide adaptive benefits to urban populations at risk for rising heat exposure with climate change."

https://openalex.org/W2008102732,"The RUNX1 transcription factor is widely recognised for its tumour suppressor effects in leukaemia. Recently a putative link to breast cancer has started to emerge, however the function of RUNX1 in breast cancer is still unknown. To investigate if RUNX1 expression was important to clinical outcome in primary breast tumours a tissue microarray (TMA) containing biopsies from 483 patients with primary operable invasive ductal breast cancer was stained by immunohistochemistry. RUNX1 was associated with progesterone receptor (PR)-positive tumours (P<0.05), more tumour CD4+(P<0.05) and CD8+(P<0.01) T-lymphocytic infiltrate, increased tumour CD138+plasma cell (P<0.01) and more CD68+macrophage infiltrate (P<0.001). RUNX1 expression did not influence outcome of oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive or HER2-positive disease, however on univariate analysis a high RUNX1 protein was significantly associated with poorer cancer-specific survival in patients with ER-negative (P<0.05) and with triple negative (TN) invasive breast cancer (P<0.05). Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression analysis of cancer-specific survival showed a trend towards significance in ER-negative patients (P<0.1) and was significant in triple negative patients (P<0.05). Of relevance, triple negative breast cancer currently lacks good biomarkers and patients with this subtype do not benefit from the option of targeted therapy unlike patients with ER-positive or HER2-positive disease. Using multivariate analysis RUNX1 was identified as an independent prognostic marker in the triple negative subgroup. Overall, our study identifies RUNX1 as a new prognostic indicator correlating with poor prognosis specifically in the triple negative subtype of human breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2095236629,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is currently the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in the western countries. It is more prevalent in older men with 75% of the incident cases above 65 years old. After radical prostatectomy, approximately 30% of men develop clinical recurrence with elevated serum prostate-specific antigen levels. Therefore, it is important to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying PCa progression to develop novel diagnostic/therapeutic approaches. In this study, it is aimed to compare the microRNA (miRNA) profile of recurrent and non-recurrent prostate tumor tissues to explore the possible involvement of miRNAs in PCa progression. Total RNA from 41 recurrent and 41 non-recurrent PCa tissue samples were used to investigate the miRNA signature in PCa specimens. First of all, 20 recurrent and 20 non-recurrent PCa samples were profiled using miRNA microarray chips. Of the differentially expressed miRNAs, miR-1, miR-133b and miR-145* were selected for further validation with qRT-PCR in a different set of 21 recurrent and 21 non-recurrent PCa samples. Data were statistically analyzed using two-sided Student's t-test, Pearson Correlation test, Receiver operating characteristic analysis. Our results demonstrated that miR-1 and mir-133b have been significantly downregulated in recurrent PCa specimens in comparison to non-recurrent PCa samples and have sufficient power to distinguish recurrent specimens from non-recurrent ones on their own. Here, we report that the relative expression of miR-1 and mir-133b have been significantly reduced in recurrent PCa specimens in comparison to non-recurrent PCa samples, which can serve as novel biomarkers for prediction of PCa progression."
https://openalex.org/W2100779008,"Background According to a recent report from the European Brain Council and the European Colleague of Neuropsychopharmacology the one year prevalence of some kind of mental disorder is around 27% among the adult population in Europe. Research has shown a lack of mental health literacy in the population in general and it is thus important to find ways to improve the public's knowledge and skills to provide first hand support to people with mental disorders. Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) is a training program that has shown positive changes in knowledge and helping behavior. This study investigates if MHFA training in a Swedish context provides a sustained improvement in knowledge about mental disorders, a better ability to be helpful in contacts with people who are ill and if it changes attitudes in a positive direction. Methods and Findings The introduction of the training program was made in accordance with the constructor's instructions. Participants were mainly public sector employees from a county in the west of Sweden. The study was a randomized controlled trial with an experiment group (n = 199) and a control group (n = 207) placed on a waiting list during a 6-month follow-up. A two-year follow-up was conducted for participants (n = 155) from both the intervention and waiting list group who had completed the training and during the follow-up been in contact with persons with mental disorders. The intervention group improved in knowledge as well as in confidence in providing help for someone in need. The two-year follow-up showed that the improvements were to a great extent maintained. Conclusions Mental Health First Aid might raise the level of awareness of mental disorders and have an influence on the number of people who can receive professional treatment for their problems."
https://openalex.org/W2054857273,"The composition of the bacterial communities in the contents of the foregut and hindgut of the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus and in the ambient surface sediment was surveyed by 16S rRNA gene 454-pyrosequencing. A total of 188,623 optimized reads and 15,527 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained from the ten gut contents samples and four surface sediment samples. The sequences in the sediments, foregut contents, and hindgut contents were assigned to 38.0±4.7, 31.2±6.2 and 27.8±6.5 phyla, respectively. The bacterial richness and Shannon diversity index were both higher in the ambient sediments than in the gut contents. Proteobacteria was the predominant phylum in both the gut contents and sediment samples. The predominant classes in the foregut, hindgut, and ambient sediment were Holophagae and Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria, respectively. The potential probiotics, including sequences related to Bacillus, lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Streptococcus) and Pseudomonas were detected in the gut of A. japonicus. Principle component analysis and heatmap figure showed that the foregut, hindgut, and ambient sediment respectively harbored different characteristic bacterial communities. Selective feeding of A. japonicus may be the primary source of the different bacterial communities between the foregut contents and ambient sediments."
https://openalex.org/W1984941589,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to function as key regulators of tumor progression and metastasis. Recent studies have indicated that the miRNAs comprising the miR-23b/27b/24 cluster might influence tumor metastasis, although the precise nature of this regulation remains unclear. Here, expression of the miR-23b/27b/24 cluster is found to correlate with metastatic potential in mouse and human breast cancer cell lines and is elevated in metastatic lung lesions in human breast cancer patients. Ectopic expression of the miRNAs in the weakly metastatic mouse 4TO7 mammary tumor cell line had no effect on proliferation or morphology of tumor cells in vitro but was found to increase lung metastasis in a mouse model of breast cancer metastasis. Furthermore, gene expression profiling analysis of miRNA overexpressing 4TO7 cells revealed the direct targeting of prosaposin (PSAP), which encodes a secreted protein found to be inversely correlated with metastatic progression in human breast cancer patients. Importantly, ectopic expression of PSAP was able to suppress the metastatic phenotype in highly metastatic 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 SCP28 cells, as well as in cells ectopically expressing miR-23b/27b/24. These findings support a metastasis-promoting function of the miR-23b/27b/24 cluster of miRNAs, which functions in part through the direct inhibition of PSAP."
https://openalex.org/W2053952967,"The verification of nuclear warheads for arms control involves a paradox: international inspectors will have to gain high confidence in the authenticity of submitted items while learning nothing about them. Proposed inspection systems featuring ‘information barriers’, designed to hide measurements stored in electronic systems, are at risk of tampering and snooping. Here we show the viability of a fundamentally new approach to nuclear warhead verification that incorporates a zero-knowledge protocol, which is designed in such a way that sensitive information is never measured and so does not need to be hidden. We interrogate submitted items with energetic neutrons, making, in effect, differential measurements of both neutron transmission and emission. Calculations for scenarios in which material is diverted from a test object show that a high degree of discrimination can be achieved while revealing zero information. Our ideas for a physical zero-knowledge system could have applications beyond the context of nuclear disarmament. The proposed technique suggests a way to perform comparisons or computations on personal or confidential data without measuring the data in the first place. Future rounds of nuclear arms control would ideally involve direct inspection of nuclear warheads using procedures that give inspectors high confidence about the authenticity of submitted nuclear items yet give no information about their design; this is now shown to be achievable using zero-knowledge protocols in neutron imaging of nuclear warheads. Future rounds of nuclear arms control will ideally involve direct inspection of nuclear warheads, but this process requires procedures that give inspectors high confidence about the authenticity of submitted nuclear items yet give no information about their design. This challenge has so far been addressed only partly, by using complex automated information barriers that rely on a large amount of trust from both parties. Alexander Glaser, Boaz Barak and Robert Goldston have now developed a 'zero-knowledge' neutron-imaging technique to determine the authenticity of nuclear warheads. Neutron radiographic images of warheads would contain highly classified information, but in this new protocol, data are not processed in the normal way but are recorded using detectors preloaded with a 'negative' of the radiograph of the target device as declared. The resulting comparison provides differential measurements of neutron transmission and emission that can detect small diversions of heavy metal from a representative test object."

Each of the vegetables was subjected to a foliar treatment with chlorpyrifos. Two analytical methods were developed using gas chromatography equipped with a micro-ECD detector (LOQ = 0.05 mg kg(-1)) and liquid chromatography with a tandem mass spectrometry (LOQ = 0.01 mg kg(-1)). The initial foliar deposited concentration of chlorpyrifos (mg kg(-1)) on the six vegetables followed the increasing order of brassica chinensis<lettuce<celery<asparagus lettuce<eggplant <pepper. The initial deposition of chlorpyrifos showed differences among the six selected vegetable plants, ranging from 16.5±0.9 mg kg(-1) (brassica chinensis) to 74.0±5.9 mg kg(-1) (pepper plant). At pre-harvest interval 21 days, the chlorpyrifos residues in edible parts of the crops were <0.01 (eggplant fruit), <0.01 (pepper fruit), 0.56 (lettuce), 0.97 (brassica chinensis), 1.47 (asparagus lettuce), and 3.50 mg kg(-1) (celery), respectively. The half-lives of chlorpyrifos were found to be 7.79 (soil), 2.64 (pepper plants), 3.90 (asparagus lettuce), 3.92 (lettuce), 5.81 (brassica chinensis), 3.00 (eggplant plant), and 5.45 days (celery), respectively. The dissipation of chlorpyrifos in soil and the six selected plants was different, indicating that the persistence of chlorpyrifos residues strongly depends upon leaf characteristics of the selected vegetables."
https://openalex.org/W2053583176,"Autapse plays an important role in regulating the electric activity of neuron by feedbacking time-delayed current on the membrane of neuron. Autapses are considered in a local area of regular network of neurons to investigate the development of spatiotemporal pattern, and emergence of spiral wave is observed while it fails to grow up and occupy the network completely. It is found that spiral wave can be induced to occupy more area in the network under optimized noise on the network with periodical or no-flux boundary condition being used. The developed spiral wave with self-sustained property can regulate the collective behaviors of neurons as a pacemaker. To detect the collective behaviors, a statistical factor of synchronization is calculated to investigate the emergence of ordered state in the network. The network keeps ordered state when self-sustained spiral wave is formed under noise and autapse in local area of network, and it independent of the selection of periodical or no-flux boundary condition. The developed stable spiral wave could be helpful for memory due to the distinct self-sustained property."
https://openalex.org/W1992363469,"CAPE is an active constituent of propolis which is widely used in traditional medicine. This hydroxycinnamic acid derivate is a known activator of the redox-active Nrf2 signalling pathway in mammalian cells. We used C. elegans to investigate the effects of this compound on accumulation of reactive oxygen species and the modulation of the pivotal redox-active pathways SKN-1 and DAF-16 (homologues of Nrf2 and FoxO, respectively) in this model organism; these results were compared to the effects in Hct116 human colon carcinoma cells. CAPE exerts a strong antioxidative effect in C. elegans: The increase of reactive oxygen species induced by thermal stress was diminished by about 50%. CAPE caused a nuclear translocation of DAF-16, but not SKN-1. CAPE increased stress resistance of the nematode against thermal stress and finally a prolongation of the median and maximum lifespan by 9 and 17%, respectively. This increase in stress resistance and lifespan was dependent on DAF-16 as shown in experiments using a DAF-16 loss of function mutant strain. Life prolongation was retained under SKN-1 RNAi conditions showing that the effect is SKN-1 independent. The results of CAPE obtained in C. elegans differed from the results obtained in Hct116 colon carcinoma cells: CAPE also caused strong antioxidative effects in the mammalian cells, but no activation of the FoxO4 signalling pathway was detectable. Instead, an activation of the Nrf2 signalling pathway was shown by luciferase assay and western blots. CONCLUSION: CAPE activates the insulin-like DAF-16, but not the SKN-1 signalling pathway in C. elegans and therefore enhances the stress resistance and lifespan of this organism. Since modulation of the DAF-16 pathway was found to be a pivotal effect of CAPE in C. elegans, this has to be taken into account for the investigation of the molecular mechanisms of the traditional use of propolis."
https://openalex.org/W2070123500,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent the most important drug targets. Although the smallest functional unit of a GPCR is a monomer, it became clear in the past decades that the vast majority of the receptors form dimers. Only very recently, however, data were presented that some receptors may in fact be expressed as a mixture of monomers and dimers and that the interaction of the receptor protomers is dynamic. To date, equilibrium measurements were restricted to the plasma membrane due to experimental limitations. We have addressed the question as to where this equilibrium is established for the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor type 1. By developing a novel approach to analyze single molecule fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy data for intracellular membrane compartments, we show that the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor type 1 has a specific monomer/dimer equilibrium that is already established in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It remains constant at the plasma membrane even following receptor activation. Moreover, we demonstrate for seven additional GPCRs that they are expressed in specific but substantially different monomer/dimer ratios. Although it is well known that proteins may dimerize in the ER in principle, our data show that the ER is also able to establish the specific monomer/dimer ratios of GPCRs, which sheds new light on the functions of this compartment.

https://openalex.org/W2022185453,Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme (C3) selectively inactivates RhoA/B/C GTPases by ADP-ribosylation. Based on this substrate specificity C3 is a well-established tool in cell biology. C3 is taken up by eukaryotic cells although lacking an uptake and translocation domain. Based on different approaches vimentin was identified as membranous C3-interaction partner by mass spectrometry. Vimentin in fact was partly localized at the outer surface of hippocampal HT22 cells and J744A.1 macrophages. Domain analysis identified the rod domain as binding partner of C3. Vimentin was also involved in uptake of C3 as shown by knock down of vimentin in HT22 and J774A.1 cells. The involvement of vimentin in uptake of C3 was further supported by the findings that the vimentin disruptor acrylamide blocked uptake of C3. Vimentin is not only a major organizing element of the intermediate filament network but is also involved in both binding and uptake of C3 exoenzyme.
https://openalex.org/W2065868087,"The metabolic enzyme fatty acid synthase (FASN) is responsible for the endogenous synthesis of palmitate, a saturated long-chain fatty acid. In contrast to most normal tissues, a variety of human cancers overexpress FASN. One such cancer is cutaneous melanoma, in which the level of FASN expression is associated with tumor invasion and poor prognosis. We previously reported that two FASN inhibitors, cerulenin and orlistat, induce apoptosis in B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells via the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Here, we investigated the effects of these inhibitors on non-tumorigenic melan-a cells. Cerulenin and orlistat treatments were found to induce apoptosis and decrease cell proliferation, in addition to inducing the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and activating caspases-9 and -3. Transfection with FASN siRNA did not result in apoptosis. Mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that treatment with the FASN inhibitors did not alter either the mitochondrial free fatty acid content or composition. This result suggests that cerulenin- and orlistat-induced apoptosis events are independent of FASN inhibition. Analysis of the energy-linked functions of melan-a mitochondria demonstrated the inhibition of respiration, followed by a significant decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and the stimulation of superoxide anion generation. The inhibition of NADH-linked substrate oxidation was approximately 40% and 61% for cerulenin and orlistat treatments, respectively, and the inhibition of succinate oxidation was approximately 46% and 52%, respectively. In contrast, no significant inhibition occurred when respiration was supported by the complex IV substrate N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD). The protection conferred by the free radical scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine indicates that the FASN inhibitors induced apoptosis through an oxidative stress-associated mechanism. In combination, the present results demonstrate that cerulenin and orlistat induce apoptosis in non-tumorigenic cells via mitochondrial dysfunction, independent of FASN inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2007185934,"Intact function of the Forkhead Box P2 (FOXP2) gene is necessary for normal development of speech and language. This important role has recently been extended, first to other forms of vocal learning in animals and then also to other forms of motor learning. The homology in structure and in function among the FoxP gene members raises the possibility that the ancestral FoxP gene may have evolved as a crucial component of the neural circuitry mediating motor learning. Here we report that genetic manipulations of the single Drosophila orthologue, dFoxP, disrupt operant self-learning, a form of motor learning sharing several conceptually analogous features with language acquisition. Structural alterations of the dFoxP locus uncovered the role of dFoxP in operant self-learning and habit formation, as well as the dispensability of dFoxP for operant world-learning, in which no motor learning occurs. These manipulations also led to subtle alterations in the brain anatomy, including a reduced volume of the optic glomeruli. RNAi-mediated interference with dFoxP expression levels copied the behavioral phenotype of the mutant flies, even in the absence of mRNA degradation. Our results provide evidence that motor learning and language acquisition share a common ancestral trait still present in extant invertebrates, manifest in operant self-learning. This 'deep' homology probably traces back to before the split between vertebrate and invertebrate animals."

https://openalex.org/W1995414363,"The enhanced AMPA receptor phosphorylation at GluA1 serine 831 sites in the central pain-modulating system plays a pivotal role in descending pain facilitation after inflammation, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We show here that, in the rat brain stem, in the nucleus raphe magnus, which is a critical relay in the descending pain-modulating system of the brain, persistent inflammatory pain induced by complete Freund adjuvant (CFA) can enhance AMPA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents and the GluA2-lacking AMPA receptor-mediated rectification index. Western blot analysis showed an increase in GluA1 phosphorylation at Ser-831 but not at Ser-845. This was accompanied by an increase in distribution of the synaptic GluA1 subunit. In parallel, the level of histone H3 acetylation at bdnf gene promoter regions was reduced significantly 3 days after CFA injection, as indicated by ChIP assays. This was correlated with an increase in BDNF mRNA levels and BDNF protein levels. Sequestering endogenous extracellular BDNF with TrkB-IgG in the nucleus raphe magnus decreased AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission and GluA1 phosphorylation at Ser-831 3 days after CFA injection. Under the same conditions, blockade of TrkB receptor functions, phospholipase C, or PKC impaired GluA1 phosphorylation at Ser-831 and decreased excitatory postsynaptic currents mediated by GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors. Taken together, these results suggest that epigenetic up-regulation of BDNF by peripheral inflammation induces GluR1 phosphorylation at Ser-831 sites through activation of the phospholipase C-PKC signaling cascade, leading to the trafficking of GluA1 to pain-modulating neuronal synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2061026903,"E1 enzymes activate ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubl) via an adenylate intermediate and initiate the enzymatic cascade of Ubl conjugation to target proteins or lipids. Ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (Ufm1) is activated by the E1 enzyme Uba5, and this pathway is proposed to play an important role in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. However, the mechanisms of Ufm1 activation by Uba5 and subsequent transfer to the conjugating enzyme (E2), Ufc1, have not been studied in detail. In this work, we found that Uba5 activated Ufm1 via a two-step mechanism and formed a binary covalent complex of Uba5∼Ufm1 thioester. This feature contrasts with the three-step mechanism and ternary complex formation in ubiquitin-activating enzyme Uba1. Uba5 displayed random ordered binding with Ufm1 and ATP, and its ATP-pyrophosphate (PPi) exchange activity was inhibited by both AMP and PPi. Ufm1 activation and Uba5∼Ufm1 thioester formation were stimulated in the presence of Ufc1. Furthermore, binding of ATP to Uba5∼Ufm1 thioester was required for efficient transfer of Ufm1 from Uba5 to Ufc1 via transthiolation. Consistent with the two-step activation mechanism, the mechanism-based pan-E1 inhibitor, adenosine 5′-sulfamate (ADS), reacted with the Uba5∼Ufm1 thioester and formed a covalent, tight-binding Ufm1-ADS adduct in the active site of Uba5, which prevented further substrate binding or catalysis. ADS was also shown to inhibit the Uba5 conjugation pathway in the HCT116 cells through formation of the Ufm1-ADS adduct. This suggests that further development of more selective Uba5 inhibitors could be useful in interrogating the roles of the Uba5 pathway in cells. E1 enzymes activate ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubl) via an adenylate intermediate and initiate the enzymatic cascade of Ubl conjugation to target proteins or lipids. Ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (Ufm1) is activated by the E1 enzyme Uba5, and this pathway is proposed to play an important role in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. However, the mechanisms of Ufm1 activation by Uba5 and subsequent transfer to the conjugating enzyme (E2), Ufc1, have not been studied in detail. In this work, we found that Uba5 activated Ufm1 via a two-step mechanism and formed a binary covalent complex of Uba5∼Ufm1 thioester. This feature contrasts with the three-step mechanism and ternary complex formation in ubiquitin-activating enzyme Uba1. Uba5 displayed random ordered binding with Ufm1 and ATP, and its ATP-pyrophosphate (PPi) exchange activity was inhibited by both AMP and PPi. Ufm1 activation and Uba5∼Ufm1 thioester formation were stimulated in the presence of Ufc1. Furthermore, binding of ATP to Uba5∼Ufm1 thioester was required for efficient transfer of Ufm1 from Uba5 to Ufc1 via transthiolation. Consistent with the two-step activation mechanism, the mechanism-based pan-E1 inhibitor, adenosine 5′-sulfamate (ADS), reacted with the Uba5∼Ufm1 thioester and formed a covalent, tight-binding Ufm1-ADS adduct in the active site of Uba5, which prevented further substrate binding or catalysis. ADS was also shown to inhibit the Uba5 conjugation pathway in the HCT116 cells through formation of the Ufm1-ADS adduct. This suggests that further development of more selective Uba5 inhibitors could be useful in interrogating the roles of the Uba5 pathway in cells. In humans, more than a dozen ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubls) 4The abbreviations used are: Ublubiquitin-like proteinNAENEDD8-activating enzymeHTRFhomogeneous time-resolved fluorescencePPipyrophosphateADSadenosine 5′-sulfamateAMP-PNPadenosine 5′-(β,γ)-imidotriphosphateERendoplasmic reticulumATP-CPPα,β-methyleneadenosine 5′-triphosphate. have been identified that participate in diverse biological processes (1.Burroughs A.M.

Mayer R.J. Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins as multifunctional signals.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Conjugation of these Ubls to substrate proteins is mediated by an enzymatic cascade commonly known as E1-E2-E3 (3.Burroughs A.M. Iyer L.M. Aravind L.

Ubiquitin-like protein activation by E1 enzymes: the apex for downstream signalling pathways.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). First, an E1 enzyme activates the C-terminal carboxylate group of the Ubl via an adenylate intermediate to form an E1-Cys∼Ubl thioester (∼ denotes the high energy thioester bond formed between the C-terminal carboxylate group of the Ubl and a conserved cysteine residue on E1) (5.Haas A.L.

Activation of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins.Subcell. Biochem. 2010; 54: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Second, E1 catalyzes transfer of the Ubl from its cysteine to a specific cysteine residue of a conjugating enzyme (also called E2) through a transthiolation reaction. Third, the resulting E2-Cys∼Ubl thioester transfers the Ubl to a lysine residue of the target protein with the help of a Ubl ligase, or E3, leading to the formation of a covalent isopeptide bond between lysine and the C-terminal carboxylate group of the Ubl. Finally, autophagy-related Ubls (human Atg8 homologs) are found to be exclusively conjugated to lipid substrates and play an essential role in autophagosome formation (8.Xie Z. Klionsky D.J. Autophagosome formation: core machinery and adaptations.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). So far, eight E1 proteins have been identified in humans, and each E1 has its cognate Ubl or Ubls and dedicated E2s and E3s to facilitate site-specific Ubl modification (3.Burroughs A.M. Iyer L.M.

Furthermore, there are deubiquitinases that catalyze removal of Ubls from the target proteins (9.Komander D. Clague M.J. Urbé S.

Furthermore, two Ufm1-specific proteases named UfSP1 and UfSP2 have also been identified and are responsible for processing the Ufm1 C-terminal sequences for activation and for removing Ufm1 from target proteins (15.Kang S.H. Kim G.R. Seong M. Baek S.H. Seol J.H. Bang O.S. Ovaa H. Tatsumi K. Komatsu M. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. Two novel ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (Ufm1)-specific proteases, UfSP1 and UfSP2.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5256-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that like ubiquitination the protein ufmylation is orchestrated by a sophisticated enzymatic pathway and represents a potentially novel mechanism to regulate protein interactions, stability, and/or localization. Several studies have linked Ufm1 to the cellular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response pathways. Tatsumi et al. (17.Tatsumi K. Sou Y.S. Tada N. Nakamura E. Iemura S. Natsume T. Kang S.H. Chung C.H. Kasahara M. Kominami E. Yamamoto M. Tanaka K. Komatsu M. A novel type of E3 ligase for the Ufm1 conjugation system.J. Biol.

Mei M. Tang Y. Li H. A novel C53/LZAP-interacting protein regulates stability of C53/LZAP and DDRGK domain-containing Protein 1 (DDRGK1) and modulates NF-κB signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 15126-15136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and Ufl1 were co-localized on the ER and that UFBP1 was possibly a target protein for ufmylation. Although no endogenous UFBP1 ufmylation was detected, overexpression of both Ufm1 and UFBP1 in HEK293 cells led to apparent ufmylation at Lys-267 of UFBP1 (17.Tatsumi K. Sou Y.S. Tada N. Nakamura E.

Chem. 2010; 285: 5417-5427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in a separate study, Ha et al. (14.Ha B.H. Jeon Y.J. Shin S.C. Tatsumi K. Komatsu M. Tanaka K. Watson C.M. Wallis G. Chung C.H. Kim E.E. Structure of ubiquitin-fold modifier 1-specific protease UfSP2.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 10248-10257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) demonstrated that one of the Ufm1-specific proteases, UfSP2, contained an N-terminal domain that interacted specifically with UFBP1 and was recruited to the ER in HeLa cells. Lemaire et al. (20.Lemaire K. Moura R.F. Granvik M. Igoillo-Esteve M. Hohmeier H.E. Hendrickx N. Newgard C.B. Waelkens E. Cnop M. Schuit F. Ubiquitin fold modifier 1 (UFM1) and its target UFBP1 protect pancreatic beta cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e18517Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) further showed that ER stresses induced expression of Ufm1, UFBP1, and Ufl1 in the pancreatic beta cell INS-1E. Genetic suppression of these proteins by siRNA sensitized INS-1E cells to ER stress and induced apoptosis (20.Lemaire K. Moura R.F. Granvik M. Igoillo-Esteve M. Hohmeier H.E. Hendrickx N. Newgard C.B. Waelkens E. Cnop M. Schuit F. Ubiquitin fold modifier 1 (UFM1) and its target UFBP1 protect pancreatic beta cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e18517Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The connection between Ufm1 and the ER stress response was further demonstrated by a recent study that suggested that Ufm1 was a target for Xbp-1, a transcription factor essential in mediating ER stress response (21.Zhang Y. Zhang M. Wu J. Lei G. Li H. Transcriptional regulation of the Ufm1 conjugation system in response to disturbance of the endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and inhibition of vesicle trafficking.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e48587Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). mRNA levels of both Ufm1 and other pathway components were shown to be up-regulated in multiple cancer cell lines when they were treated with ER stress inducers such as thapsgargin, tunicamycin, or brefeldin A (21.Zhang Y. Zhang M. Wu J. Lei G. Li H. Transcriptional regulation of the Ufm1 conjugation system in response to disturbance of the endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and inhibition of vesicle trafficking.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e48587Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Suppression of the Ufm1 pathway components by siRNA led to morphological changes of the ER network in U2OS cells (21.Zhang Y. Zhang M. Wu J. Lei G. Li H. Transcriptional regulation of the Ufm1 conjugation system in response to disturbance of the endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and inhibition of vesicle trafficking.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e48587Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The Uba5-Ufm1 conjugation pathway was also shown to be implicated in the ER stress response in Caenorhabditis elegans (22.Hertel P. Daniel J. Stegehake D. Vaupel H. Kailayangiri S. Gruel C. Woltersdorf C. Liebau E. The ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (Ufm1) cascade of Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 10661-10671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All these studies suggest that protein ufmylation is an important pathway that cells have evolved to maintain proper function of the ER and to mediate ER stress responses. In addition, Tatsumi et al. (23.Tatsumi K. Yamamoto-Mukai H. Shimizu R. Waguri S. Sou Y.S. Sakamoto A. Taya C. Shitara H. Hara T. Chung C.H. Tanaka K. Yamamoto M. Komatsu M. The Ufm1-activating enzyme Uba5 is indispensable for erythroid differentiation in mice.Nat. Commun. 2011; 2: 181Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) showed that murine fetuses lacking Uba5 were not viable and developed severe anemia, suggesting that the Uba5-Ufm1 pathway might play an essential role in hematopoiesis during development. Although the Ufm1 conjugation pathway has been implicated in important cellular functions, the mechanism of Ufm1 activation by Uba5 and its transfer has not been studied in detail. Here, we showed that, in contrast to “canonical” Ubl conjugation pathways, Ufm1 was activated by a two-step mechanism to form a binary, covalent complex of Uba5∼Ufm1 thioester. In addition, we found that adenosine 5′-sulfamate (ADS) was a mechanism-based inhibitor of Uba5. ADS was shown to react with the Uba5∼Ufm1 thioester to form a tight binding Ufm1-ADS adduct that occupied the adenylation site of Uba5 to prevent further substrate binding. [32P]PPi (catalog no.

N-terminally His6-tagged human Uba5 (and other E1s) and N-terminally glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged Uba5 fusion protein were expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified as described (25.Soucy T.A.

The purity of wild-type and C250A Uba5 was determined to be ∼90 and ∼93%, respectively, based on SDS-PAGE/Coomassie staining and densitometry analysis. Ufc1 was expressed as an N-terminally His-tagged protein. Expressed proteins were purified by affinity or conventional chromatography using standard buffers. Concentrations of purified E1 and E2 proteins were determined using Coomassie PlusTM protein assay (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, catalog no. 1856210) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard. Concentrations of purified Ufm1 were determined by its UV absorption at 280 nm (ϵ280 nm, 1.49 mm−1 cm−1). The ATP-PPi exchange assays were carried out using a modified protocol developed by Bruzzese et al. (26.Bruzzese F.J. Tsu C.A. Ma J. Loke H.K. Wu D. Li Z. Tayber O. Dick L.R.

Biochem. 2009; 394: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For titrations and K½ determination, substrates were serially diluted 1 in 2 or 1 in 3 on a 96-well plate. The reaction mixtures containing 50 nm wild-type Uba5 or 100 nm C250A Uba5 were incubated at 37 °C in 1× E1 Buffer (50 mm HEPES, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% BSA, 0.01% Tween 20, and 1 mm tricarboxyethyl phosphine, pH 7.5) for 30 min. For Ufm1 titrations, 0.5 mm ATP and 40 μm PPi (50 cpm/pmol [32P]PPi) were used. For ATP and PPi titrations, Ufm1 concentration was fixed at 25 μm for wild-type Uba5 and 0.2 μm for C250A Uba5 reactions. For AMP titrations, 50 μm ATP and either 5 or 250 μm PPi (50 cpm/pmol [32P]PPi) were used. As described previously, in the ATP-PPi exchange assay K½ was used instead of Km (5.Haas A.L. Rose I.A. The mechanism of ubiquitin activating enzyme. A kinetic and equilibrium analysis.J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). K½ values were estimated by fitting the data using the Michaelis-Menten equation. For kcat determinations, 25, 50, or 100 nm Uba5 was incubated at 30 °C for various time points in 1× E1 Buffer with 50 μm Ufm1, 0.5 mm ATP, and 50 μm PPi (50cpm/pmol [32P]PPi). kcat values were calculated using rates of the reactions and an [α-32P]ATP standard curve. For Uba5 inhibition studies, ADS was serially diluted into a 96-well assay plate in a mixture containing 40 nm Uba5, 100, or 1000 μm ATP, 50 μm PPi (50 cpm/pmol [32P]PPi), and 25 μm Ufm1 in 1× E1 Buffer. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. To study time-dependent inhibition of Uba5 by ADS and to measure the rate of inactivation, ATP-PPi reactions were monitored over time at room temperature with varying concentrations of ADS in 1× E1 Buffer containing 50 μm ATP.

The flow-through of the spin column containing the Uba5·Ufm1-ADS complex was then diluted 1 in 600 into 1× HEPES buffer. The final reaction mixture contained 0.5 nm Uba5, 75 nm FLAG-Ufm1, 35 nm biotinylated-Ufc1, and 2 mm ATP in 1× HEPES buffer. Reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature, and at various time points (between 0 and 240 min), HTRF signals were measured on a PHERAstar plus equipped with an HTRF optical module (BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany). The reaction mixtures contained 1 μm wild-type or C250A Uba5, 20 μm Ufm1, 50 μm ATP ([α-32P]ATP (1 μCi/nmol)), 200 μm ADS (where indicated), 5 mm MgCl2 in 1× HEPES buffer. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 5 min before being quenched with 25 mm EDTA. To measure the rate of adenylate formation, similar conditions were used as above except that reactions were quenched at varying time points. The reaction mixtures were analyzed, and the signals on the TLC plates were quantified as described previously (27.Chen J.J. Tsu C.A. Gavin J.M. Milhollen M.A. Bruzzese F.J. Mallender W.D.

Rates of Uba5∼Ufm1 formation were measured in reaction mixtures containing 1 μm Uba5, 40 μm untagged Ufm1, 400 μm ATP in 1× HEPES buffer. Reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature and quenched with 4× lithium dodecyl sulfate sample loading buffer (Invitrogen, catalog no. NP0007) at various time points. The samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions without boiling, transferred to a 0.2-μm InvitrolonTM PVDF membrane (Invitrogen, catalog no. LC2005), and probed with anti-Uba5 antibody. Alexa Fluor 680-labeled secondary anti-rabbit antibody (Invitrogen, catalog no. A21109) was then used, and quantitation of bands were performed on a Li-Cor Odyssey Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). To determine the rate of Ufc1∼Ufm1 thioester formation, 2 μm of Uba5 was preincubated with Ufm1 (3 μm) and ATP (400 μm) for 45 min at room temperature before diluting 1:2 into solution containing 1 μm Ufc1. Ufc1∼Ufm1 thioester was detected using the anti-Ufc1 antibody, and signal was quantified as described. To study the effect of Ufc1 on the rate of Uba5∼Ufm1 thioester formation, 20 nm Uba5, 1 μm untagged Ufm1, 100 μm ATP, and 200 nm wild-type Ufc1, C116A Ufc1, or pre-formed Ufc1∼Ufm1 in 1× HEPES buffer were incubated at room temperature. Pre-formed Uba5∼Ufm1 was generated by incubating 4 μm wild-type Ufc1 with 6 μm Ufm1, 25 nm Uba5 (300 μm ATP) for 1 h at room temperature before being desalted by a ZEBA desalt column as described above. Uba5∼Ufm1 thioester formation was monitored over time by Western blot analysis as described above. To study the effect of different adenosine nucleotide analogs on Uba5-Ufc1 transthiolation, pre-made Uba5∼Ufm1 was generated by incubating 2.15 μm Uba5, 2 μm Ufm1, 300 μm ATP in 1× HEPES buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After 1 h, 8 mm EDTA was added to chelate Mg2+ and release bound ATP before samples were desalted by a ZEBA spin column to remove ATP. The pre-formed Uba5∼Ufm1 sample was then incubated with Ufc1 in the presence of either buffer, 500 μm ATP, AMP, or a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-CPP. Reactions were monitored over time, and Ufc1∼Ufm1 thioester was detected and quantified by Western blot analysis as described above. To determine the rate of Ufm1-ADS adduct formation, a reaction mixture of 50 nm Uba5, 1 μm untagged Ufm1, and 100 μm ATP was incubated with 100 μm ADS (with or without 200 nm Ufc1) in 1× HEPES buffer at room temperature.

The major signaling components in the IFN pathway are expressed in mESCs. Therefore, the basic molecular mechanisms that mediate the effects of type I IFNs are functional in mESCs; however, these mechanisms may not yet be fully developed as mESCs express lower levels of IFN-stimulated genes and display weaker antiviral activity in response to type I IFNs when compared with fibroblasts. Further analysis demonstrated that type I IFNs do not affect the stem cell state of mESCs. We conclude that mESCs are deficient in type I IFN expression, but they can respond to and mediate the cellular effects of type I IFNs.

https://openalex.org/W2088714117,"Obesity-induced adipose tissue (AT) dysfunction results in a chronic low-grade inflammation that predisposes to the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. During the development of obesity, the AT-resident immune cell profile alters to create a pro-inflammatory state. Very recently, CD1d-restricted invariant (i) natural killer T (NKT) cells, a unique subset of lymphocytes that are reactive to so called lipid antigens, were implicated in AT homeostasis. Interestingly, recent data also suggest that human and mouse adipocytes can present such lipid antigens to iNKT cells in a CD1d-dependent fashion, but little is known about the lipid antigen presentation machinery in adipocytes. Here we show that CD1d, as well as the lipid antigen loading machinery genes pro-saposin (Psap), Niemann Pick type C2 (Npc2), α-galactosidase (Gla), are up-regulated in early adipogenesis, and are transcriptionally controlled by CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)-β and -δ. Moreover, adipocyte-induced Th1 and Th2 cytokine release by iNKT cells also occurred in the absence of exogenous ligands, suggesting the display of endogenous lipid antigen-D1d complexes by 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Furthermore, we identified microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, which we show is also under the transcriptional regulation of C/EBPβ and -δ, as a novel player in the presentation of endogenous lipid antigens by adipocytes. Overall, our findings indicate that adipocytes can function as non-professional lipid antigen presenting cells, which may present an important aspect of adipocyte-immune cell communication in the regulation of whole body energy metabolism and immune homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2064479765,"The correct spatial organization of microtubules is of crucial importance for determining the internal architecture of eukaryotic cells. Microtubules are arranged in space by a multitude of biochemical activities and by spatial constraints imposed by the cell boundary. The principles underlying the establishment of distinct intracellular architectures are only poorly understood. Here, we studied the effect of spatial confinement on the self-organization of purified motors and microtubules that are encapsulated in lipid-monolayered droplets in oil, varying in diameter from 5–100 μm, which covers the size range of typical cell bodies. We found that droplet size alone had a major organizing influence. The presence of a microtubule-crosslinking motor protein decreased the number of accessible types of microtubule organizations. Depending on the degree of spatial confinement, the presence of the motor caused either the formation of a cortical array of bent microtubule bundles or the generation of single microtubule asters in the droplets. These are two of the most prominent forms of microtubule arrangements in plant and metazoan cells. Our results provide insights into the combined organizing influence of spatial constraints and cross-linking motor activities determining distinct microtubule architectures in a minimal biomimetic system. In the future, this simple lipid-monolayered droplet system characterized here can be expanded readily to include further biochemical activities or used as the starting point for the investigation of motor-mediated microtubule organization inside liposomes surrounded by a deformable lipid bilayer.

The correct architecture of the microtubule cytoskeleton in living cells is essential for correct organelle positioning, cell division, and cell differentiation. The spatial organization of microtubules is determined by biochemical activities, for example from nucleators, microtubule dynamics regulators, cross-linkers and molecular motors, but also by the presence of the cell boundary (1.Deinum E.E.

The principles underlying the establishment of distinct intracellular architectures are only poorly understood. This is largely due to the complexity of the repertoire of activities involved and due to an underrepresentation of studies directly addressing the effects of spatial confinement. In vitro reconstitution approaches are useful for the investigation of the design principles of simpler model systems of known composition that consist of small sets of well characterized purified components. Previously, in vitro experiments with purified microtubule cross-linking and sliding motors showed under which conditions motors organize microtubules into bundles, asters, or networks of focused poles in quasi-two-dimensional unconfined environments (4.Hentrich C.

The interplay between a confining boundary and growing microtubules was first studied in vitro for individual microtubules that were encapsulated in small liposomes produced by a freeze-thaw method (8.Elbaum M.

Depending on geometrical constraints, straight microtubules either deformed the membrane or the microtubules were bent by the curved membrane (8.Elbaum M. Kuchnir Fygenson D. Libchaber A.

The positioning of asters consisting of multiple microtubules that were grown from microtubule-organizing centers was investigated in microchambers (11.Faivre-Moskalenko C. Dogterom M.

Micrometer-sized droplets in oil are an alternative system to encapsulate biochemical reactions (13.Griffiths A.D. Tawfik D.S. Miniaturising the laboratory in emulsion droplets.Trends Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 395-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to study the effects of confinement. Such droplets can be produced easily, and they can have lipid-monolayered boundaries that mimic the inner surface of the plasma membrane. Lipid-monolayered droplets can then be transformed into liposomes (14.Pautot S. Frisken B.J. Weitz D.A. Production of unilamellar vesicles using an inverted emulsion.Langmuir. 2003; 19: 2870-2879Crossref Scopus (414) Google Scholar). This method has been used recently for the reconstitution of an active actin cortex inside liposomes consisting of a defined set of purified proteins of the actin cytoskeleton (15.Pontani L.L. van der Gucht J.

Symmetry breaking in reconstituted actin cortices.eLife. 2014; 3: e01433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Comparable experiments for encapsulated active motor/microtubule assemblies produced with purified proteins are lacking. The droplets-in-oil method has been used to investigate self-organized microtubule assemblies in encapsulated Xenopus egg extract, an experimental system of a highly complex composition (17.Pinot M. Chesnel F. Kubiak J.Z. Arnal I. Nedelec F.J. Gueroui Z. Effects of confinement on the self-organization of microtubules and motors.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 954-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). When the microtubule stabilizer paclitaxel is added to such Xenopus egg extracts in the absence of confinement, microtubule asters are generated by a set of microtubule cross-linking and sliding activities, including the motor protein dynein (18.Merdes A.

Self-organization of microtubules into bipolar spindles around artificial chromosomes in Xenopus egg extracts.Nature. 1996; 382: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Aster formation in encapsulated extract has been shown to depend on confinement size. Spatial constraints led to microtubule bundling and bending in small droplets (17.Pinot M. Chesnel F. Kubiak J.Z.

Biol. 2009; 19: 954-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A systematic investigation, however, of how microtubules arrange in droplets of different sizes in the absence of any other proteins, and how the presence of a purified and well characterized microtubule sliding motor changes these arrangements, is currently lacking. Here we have studied the effect of confinement on the self-organization of purified motors and microtubules that are encapsulated in lipid-monolayered droplets in oil. We observed that a relatively large variety of microtubule arrangements is accessible in the absence of a microtubule cross-linking motor and that, in this case, droplet size had the major organizing effect. The bundling and sliding activity of a motor protein restricted access to several arrangements and, additionally, opened the motor-dependent pathway for aster organization, provided the droplets were of sufficient size. These results provide insight into the combined ordering effects of spatial constraints and cross-linking motor activities on microtubule organization in a minimal biomimetic system. Pig brain tubulin was purified and labeled with Atto633-N-hydroxy succinimidylester (Sigma) using standard methods (20.Hyman A. Drechsel D. Kellogg D. Salser S. Sawin K. Steffen P. Wordeman L.

In all experiments, the final labeling ratio of the tubulin mixture was adjusted to 0.1 fluorophores/tubulin dimer. Concentrations and labeling ratios were measured by absorbance at 280 and 629 nm using the appropriate extinction coefficients. Tubulin concentrations are tubulin dimer concentrations throughout. mCherry-tagged Xenopus laevis kinesin-14 XCTK2 (mCherry-kinesin-14) was produced essentially as described previously (4.Hentrich C.

Insect cells with baculovirus-overexpressed His6-mCherry-kinesin-14 were homogenized manually in buffer A (50 mm NaPO4 buffer, 300 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (pH 7)) supplemented with 30 mm imidazole, 0.5 mm ATP, and complete EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche). The protein was eluted from Protino nickel-tris(carboxymethyl)ethylene diamine) beads (Macherey-Nagel) using buffer A supplemented with 300 mm imidazole and 0.05 mm ATP. The buffer was then exchanged to buffer A supplemented with 0.05 mm ATP using a PD 10 desalting column (Fisher Scientific). The His tag was cleaved off by AcTEV protease (LifeTechnologies) overnight at 4 °C, producing mCherry-kinesin-14. The free His tag was removed using Protino nickel-tris(carboxymethyl)ethylene diamine beads, followed by gel filtration of the protein in buffer A supplemented with 0.05 mm ATP. The protein was concentrated using membrane ultracentrifugation (VivaSpin, molecular mass 30,000 Da), and aliquots were shock-frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. The kinesin concentration was determined by Bradford (Bio-Rad) using a BSA standard. The successful cleavage of the His tag was verified by an anti-histidine Western blot analysis. To generate lipid-monolayered droplets, we emulsified a solution containing proteins in a lipid/oil mixture (similar as in Refs. 14.Pautot S. Frisken B.J. Weitz D.A.

For the lipid/oil mixture, a total of 10 mg of purified lipids dissolved in chloroform (Avanti Polar Lipids) were mixed in a 25-ml round bottom glass. The following lipid mixtures were tested (Fig. 1): 100% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC); 3The abbreviations used are: DOPC1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholineDOPG1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerolDOPE1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolaminePCphosphatidylcholinePGphosphatidylglycerolPEphosphatidylethanolaminePDMSpolydimethylsiloxane. 90% DOPC and 10% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DOPG); 65% DOPC and 35% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE); and 55% DOPC, 35% DOPE, and 10% DOPG (all are mole percent). 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylglycerol phosphatidylethanolamine polydimethylsiloxane. The chloroform was allowed to evaporate under nitrogen flow, and the lipid mixture (see below) was redissolved in 200 μl of cyclohexane, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and lyophilized at −80 °C in a freeze dryer (Labconco) for at least 12 h to remove all solvent. The dried lipids were then dissolved in 10 ml of mineral oil at a total concentration of 1 mg/ml by sonicating in an ice-cold water bath for 30 min. Exposure to air was minimized by filling the flasks with nitrogen gas. The lipid/oil mixture was left to cool at room temperature for another 30 min and stored at 4 °C for a maximum of 2 days. To generate the final emulsion, 20 μl of a protein-containing solution (see below) was clarified by centrifugation for 3 min at 13,000 × g at 4 °C. 1.3 μl of clarified solution was added into 450 μl of lipid/oil mixture (prechilled to 4 °C) and sheared gently by pumping with a Microlance needle (Scientific Laboratory Supplies) fitted to a 1-ml glass syringe (Roth). For initial optimization experiments (Fig. 1), the protein-containing solution consisted of 40 μm Atto633-labeled tubulin in droplet buffer (44 mm PIPES, 10.3 mm MgCl2, 2.8 mm EGTA, 3 mm GTP, 5 mm ATP, 40 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm KCl, 1 μm paclitaxel, 20 mm glucose, 1 mg/ml glucose oxidase (Serva, catalog no. 22778), 0.5 mg/ml catalase (Sigma, catalog no. C40), 0.5 mg/ml BSA, and 0.25 mg/ml β-casein (pH 6.8)) without or with 10% (v/v) glycerol. For all remaining experiments (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7), the lipid mixture was always 55% DOPC, 35% DOPE, and 10% DOPG, and the protein-containing solution typically consisted of 40 μm labeled Atto-633 tubulin in standard droplet buffer (droplet buffer supplemented with 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 10% (v/v) XCTK2 gel filtration buffer) (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). In some experiments, the tubulin concentration was changed to 30 and 50 μm (Fig. 4, C and D), and in self-organization experiments, 200 (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7) or 400 nm mCherry-kinesin-14 was added to the protein-containing solution.FIGURE 3Time course of confined microtubule arrangements: characteristic examples for the different arrangement categories.

The matrices were prepared from PDMS (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning) gels using a 10:1 ratio (v/v) of elastomer:curing agent. Both components were mixed extensively for 1 min in a 50-ml Falcon tube, centrifuged at 4000 × g at 4 °C for 1 min to remove air bubbles, and then poured into a Petri dish (Falcon BD). The polymer was subsequently cured for 1 h in an oven at 75 °C, followed by 10 h at room temperature. Using a punch, round holes of 5 mm in diameter were stamped into the 3-mm-high gel. With a scalpel, 10 × 15 mm squares were cut out of the PDMS, each containing two holes separated by not more than 1.5 mm. A PDMS matrix was positioned in the middle, perpendicular to the long edge of a cleaned and Rain-X®-treated coverslip, and pressed gently onto it, allowing no gap between the glass and the PDMS gel. The PDMS chambers were placed on an ice-cold metal block, and 20 μl of the emulsion was added immediately into the wells after mixing. Droplets in oil were left to settle at 4 °C for 4 min before the sample was put under the microscope. Images were acquired with a spinning disk confocal microscope (3I, Intelligent Imaging Innovations) comprising a LaserStackTM (containing 488 nm, 50 milliwatt; 561 nm, 50 milliwatt; and 640 nm, 40 milliwatt) Yokogawa CSU M1 on a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 with a ×63 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective (Zeiss) and a charge-coupled device camera (Orca-Flash4.0 LT). The microscope was equipped with an environmental chamber (OKOlab) that was heated to 32 °C. Time-lapse imaging was started immediately after placing the slide into the heated environment box. To minimize alterations of the measured fluorescence intensities because of a lensing effect caused by the diffractive index mismatch of the droplet buffer and the oil, the droplets were imaged close to their equatorial planes. For microtubule polymerization assays, images at four to six different positions were recorded every 60 s with 300-ms exposure times (640 nm excitation, 30% laser intensity) for 20 min. For self-organization assays, images were recorded for 25 min using multipoint acquisition every 60 s with 300-ms exposure times for Atto633 (640 nm excitation, 30% laser intensity) and 400-ms exposure times for mCherry (561 nm excitation, 50% laser intensity). End state images of one focal plane per position or three-dimensional image stacks were taken immediately after the time course. Stacks were acquired in z steps of 500 nm (exposures as above for Atto633 and mCherry). All images were acquired using 2 × 2 pixel binning. For control purposes, microtubule polymerization and self-organization assays in bulk were performed in 10-μl flow chambers assembled from a poly-l-lysine-PEG-treated (SuSoS) coverslip and a glass slide using double-sided sticky tape (23.Bieling P. Telley I.A. Hentrich C. Piehler J. Surrey T. Fluorescence microscopy assays on chemically functionalized surfaces for quantitative imaging of microtubule, motor, and +TIP dynamics.Methods Cell Biol. 2010; 95: 555-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The chamber was placed on an ice-cold metal block and filled with 5% (w/v) Pluronic F-127 (Sigma). After 3 min, 30 μl of flow chamber buffer (40 mm PIPES, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml BSA (pH 6.8)) followed by 20 μl of clarified assay solution were flowed through the chamber. Clarification was achieved by centrifugation for 3 min at 13,000 × g and 4 °C in a tabletop centrifuge. For microtubule polymerization assays (supplemental Movie 1), the final assay solution contained 20 μm Atto633-labeled tubulin in droplet buffer. For motor/microtubule self-organization assays (supplemental Movie 8), the final assay solution contained 7 μm Atto633-labeled tubulin and 100 nm mCherry-kinesin-14 in standard droplet buffer. The chamber was sealed with a 1:1:1 (w/w) mixture of VALAP (Vaseline, lanolin, and paraffin wax, Sigma) and used immediately used for imaging. Imaging was done as described for droplets in oil, with the following modifications. A 40 × 1.3 numerical aperture oil immersion objective (Zeiss) was used without multipoint acquisition. For microtubule polymerization assays (supplemental Movie 1), images were recorded every 20 s with an exposure time of 100 ms (640 nm excitation) for 20 min. For self-organization assays (supplemental Movie 8), images were recorded every 20 s with 300-ms exposure times (561- and 644-nm excitation) for 20 min. Binning and laser intensities were as described above. All confocal microscopy images were acquired using Slidebook software (3I, Intelligent Imaging Innovations). For optimal visualization, they were processed (signal levels and contrast adjustment before conversion from 16- to 8-bit using ImageJ (Research Service Branch, National Institutes of Health, http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij). Three-dimensional projections and XZ plane pictures of droplets in oil were rendered from stacks in Imaris (Bitplane AG). For movies, time-lapse confocal microscopy images were corrected for bleaching by adjusting the mean intensity of each frame using the correct_bleach ImageJ macro. Time stamps and scale bars were added after processing using the ImageJ plugins. To identify the end state of microtubule polymerization and motor/microtubule self-organization (the time point of the reaction after which the microtubule arrangement did not change significantly), time-lapse confocal microscopy images, taken every minute, were analyzed manually from at least 10 time courses/condition. Microtubule arrangements inside droplets were analyzed and classified by eye on the basis of confocal slice stacks. For each condition, at least 70 stacks from 20 independent experiments over five different days (minimum) were considered. The diameter was measured using the distance between highest Atto633 dye intensities at the droplet rim from one pixel line plot in a lateral direction over the equatorial planes of the droplets. All droplets in a field of view with a diameter ≥ 2.5 μm were considered and assigned to one of the bins, each comprising a 5-μm diameter range around the indicated central value. For each droplet size category, a minimum of 10 droplets was analyzed. To investigate the self-organization of microtubules and purified motors in confined environments, we produced droplets of protein-containing solutions dispersed in mineral oil (see “Experimental Procedures”) (14.Pautot S.

This study extends a previously described non-small cell lung cancer prognostic model by the addition of chemotherapy and co-morbidities through the use of linked SEER-Medicare data.Data on 34,203 lung adenocarcinoma and 26,967 squamous cell lung carcinoma patients were used to determine the contribution of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) to prognostication in 30 treatment combinations. A Cox model including COPD was estimated on 1,000 bootstrap samples, with the resulting model assessed on ROC, Brier Score, Harrell's C, and Nagelkerke's R2 metrics in order to evaluate improvements in prognostication over a model without COPD. The addition of COPD to the model incorporating cancer stage, age, gender, race, and tumor grade was shown to improve prognostication in multiple patient groups. For lung adenocarcinoma patients, there was an improvement on the prognostication in the overall patient population and in patients without receiving chemotherapy, including those receiving surgery only. For squamous cell carcinoma, an improvement on prognostication was seen in both the overall patient population and in patients receiving multiple types of chemotherapy. COPD condition was able to stratify patients receiving the same treatments into significantly (log-rank p<0.05) different prognostic groups, independent of cancer stage.Combining patient information on COPD, cancer stage, age, gender, race, and tumor grade could improve prognostication and prediction of treatment response in individual non-small cell lung cancer patients. This model enables refined prognosis and estimation of clinical outcome of comprehensive treatment regimens, providing a useful tool for personalized clinical decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W1978721598,"Objective We prospectively investigate the relation between baseline circulating endothelial progenitor cells and the subsequent development of restenosis after angioplasty of hemodialysis vascular access. Background Effect of angioplasty for hemodialysis vascular access is greatly attenuated by early and frequent restenosis. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) play a key role in vascular repair but are deficient in hemodialysis patients. Method After excluding 14 patients due to arterial stenosis, central vein stenosis, and failed angioplasty, 130 patients undergoing angioplasty for dysfunctional vascular access were prospectively enrolled. Flow cytometry with quantification of EPC markers (defined as CD34+, CD34+KDR+, CD34+KDR+CD133+) in peripheral blood immediately before angioplasty procedures was used to assess circulating EPC numbers. Patients were followed clinically for up to one year after angioplasty. Results During the one-year follow-up, 95 patients (73%) received interventions for recurrent access dysfunction. Patients in the lower tertile of CD34+KDR+ cell count had the highest restenosis rates (46%) at three month (early restenosis), compared with patients in the medium and upper tertiles of CD34+KDR+ cell count (27% and 12% respectively, p = 0.002). Patients in the lower tertile of CD34+KDR+ cell count received more re-interventions during one year. Patients with early restenosis had impaired EPC adhesive function and increased senescence and apoptosis. In multivariate analysis, the CD34+KDR+ and CD34+KDR+CD133+ cell counts were independent predictors of target-lesion early restenosis. Conclusion Our results suggest that the deficiency of circulating EPCs is associated with early and frequent restenosis after angioplasty of hemodialysis vascular access."

Pretreatment records of 300 orthodontic patients (140 males and 160 females, 219 Malaysian Malay and 81 Chinese, average age was 16.27±4.59) were used. Third-molar agenesis was calculated with respect to race, genders, number of missing teeth, jaws, skeletal malocclusion patterns and sagittal maxillomandibular jaw dimensions. The Pearson chi-square test and ANOVA was performed to determine potential differences. Associations between various factors and M3 presence/agenesis groups were assessed using logistic regression analysis. The percentages of subjects with 1 or more M3 agenesis were 30%, 33% and 31% in the Malaysian Malay, Chinese and total population, respectively. Overall prevalence of M3 agenesis in male and female was equal (P>0.05). The frequency of the agenesis of M3s is greater in maxilla as well in the right side (P>0.05). The prevalence of M3 agenesis in those with a Class III and Class II malocclusion was relatively higher in Malaysian Malay and Malaysian Chinese population respectively. Using stepwise regression analyses, significant associations were found between Mx (P<0.05) and ANB (P<0.05) and M3 agenesis. This multivariate analysis suggested that Mx and ANB were significantly correlated with the M3 presence/agenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2093911514,"Wnt signaling and cadherin-mediated adhesion have been implicated in both processes of embryonic development and the progression of carcinomas. Recent experimental studies revealed that Wnt signaling and cadherin-mediated cell adhesion have close crosstalk with each other. A comprehensive model that investigates the dynamic balance of β-catenins in Wnt signaling and cell adhesion will improve our understanding to embryonic development and carcinomas. We constructed a network model to evaluate the dynamic interplay between adhesion and Wnt signaling. The network is decomposed into three interdependent modules: the cell adhesion, the degradation circle and the transcriptional regulation. In the cell adhesion module, we consider the effect of cadherin's lateral clustering. We found adhesion negatively contributes to Wnt signaling through competition for cytoplasmic β-catenins. In the network of degradation circle, we incorporated features from various existing models. Our simulations reproduced the most recent experimental phenomena with semi-quantitative accuracy. Finally, in the transcriptional regulation module, we developed a function selection strategy to analyze the outcomes of genetic feedback loops in modulating the gene expression of Wnt targets. The specific cellular phenomena such as cadherin switch and Axin oscillation were archived and their biological insights were discussed. Our model provides the theoretical basis of how spatial organization regulates the dynamics of cellular signaling pathways. We suggest that cell adhesion affects Wnt signaling in both negative and positive ways. Cadherins can inhibit Wnt signaling not only in a way as a stoichiometric binding partner of β-catenins that sequesters them from signaling, but also in a way through their clustering to impacts the rate at which β-catenins are involved in the destruction loop. Additionally, cadherin clustering increases the phosphorylation rate of β-catenins and promotes its signaling in nucleus."

The enzyme, comprised of 572 amino acids, shares high homology with PAF-AH proteins from T. koningii and other microbial species. The optimum enzymatic activity of PAF-AH occurred at pH 6 in the absence of Ca2+ and it localized in the cytoplasm, and we observed the upregulation of PAF-AH expression in response to carbon starvation and strong heat shock. Furthermore, PAF-AH knockout transformant growth occurred more slowly than wild type cells and over-expression strains grown in SM medium at 37°C and 42°C. In addition, PAF-AH expression significantly increased under a series of maize root induction assay. Eicosanoic acid and ergosterol levels decreased in the PAF-AH knockouts compared to wild type cells, as revealed by GC/MS analysis. We also determined stress responses mediated by PAF-AH were related to proteins HEX1, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, and cytochrome c. Finally, PAF-AH exhibited antagonistic activity against Rhizoctonia solani in plate confrontation assays.

This study used a prospective longitudinal design to test the bi-directional relationships between these constructs, by surveying 266 students with and without disabilities and their parents, 6-months before and after the transition to secondary school. Cross-lagged multi-group analyses found student perception of belongingness in the final year of primary school to contribute to change in their mental health functioning a year later. The beneficial longitudinal effects of school belongingness on subsequent mental health functioning were evident in all student subgroups; even after accounting for prior mental health scores and the cross-time stability in mental health functioning and school belongingness scores. Findings of the current study substantiate the role of school contextual influences on early adolescent mental health functioning. They highlight the importance for primary and secondary schools to assess students' school belongingness and mental health functioning and transfer these records as part of the transition process, so that appropriate scaffolds are in place to support those in need. Longer term longitudinal studies are needed to increase the understanding of the temporal sequencing between school belongingness and mental health functioning of all mainstream students."

However, Lgr5 is not expressed in adult hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Whether Lgr5 is expressed in the embryonic and fetal HSPCs that undergo rapid proliferation is unknown. Here we report the detection of Lgr5 expression in HSPCs in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) and fetal liver. We also found that a portion of Lgr5(+) cells expressed the Runx1 gene that is critical for the ontogeny of HSPCs. A small portion of Lgr5(+) cells also expressed HSPC surface markers c-Kit and CD34 in AGM or CD41 in fetal liver. Furthermore, the majority of Lgr5(+) cells expressed Ki67, indicating their proliferating state. Transplantation of fetal liver-derived Lgr5-GFP(+) cells (E12.5) demonstrated that Lgr5-GFP(+) cells were able to reconstitute myeloid and lymphoid lineages in adult recipients, but the engraftment was short-term (4-8 weeks) and 20-fold lower compared with the Lgr5-GFP(-) control. Our data show that Lgr5-expressing cells mark short-term hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, consistent with the role of Lgr5 in supporting HSPCs rapid proliferation during embryonic and fetal development."

The mechanical properties (stress and strain at rupture, Young's modulus, and toughness) of these plasticized polymeric films of acrylic (Eudragit RS, RL, and NE) and cellulosic materials (ethyl cellulose (EC), and Surelease) were examined by a dynamic mechanical analyzer. Results demonstrated that polymeric films prepared from Surelease and EC were brittle with less elongation compared to acrylic films. Eudragit NE films were very flexible in both the dry and wet states. Because plasticizer leached from polymeric films during exposure to the aqueous medium, plasticization of wet Eudragit RS and RL films with 15% triethyl citrate (TEC) or diethyl phthalate (DEP) resulted in less elongation. DEP might be the plasticizer of choice among the plasticizers examined in this study for Eudragit RL to provide muFDDSs with a short time for all pellets to float (TPF) and a longer period of floating. Eudragit RL and RS at a 1∶1 ratio plasticized with 15% DEP were optimally selected as the coating membrane for the floating system. Although the release of losartan from the pellets was still too fast as a result of losartan being freely soluble in water, muFDDSs coated with Eudragit RL and RS at a 1∶1 ratio might have potential use for the sustained release of water-insoluble or the un-ionized form of drugs from gastroretentive drug delivery systems."
https://openalex.org/W2061676606,"Background Intracranial aneurysm (IA) is significantly more prevalent in patients with coarctation of the aorta or bicuspid aortic valve than in the general population, suggesting a common pathophysiology connecting IA and aortopathy. Here, we analyzed echocardiographic aortic root dimension (ARD) in patients with IA to confirm this possibility. Methods From January 2008 to December 2010, 260 consecutive patients with IA who were admitted to our institution for coil embolization or for acute stroke management and who also underwent echocardiography were enrolled. We hypothesized that patients with large, ruptured, or multiple IAs are more likely to harbor co-prevalent aortopathy as measured by ARD compared to patients with small, isolated, unruptured IAs. Eccentric group was defined as patients aged <55 years with at least one ruptured aneurysm, an aneurysm ≥7 mm in size, or multiple aneurysms; the remainder was classified into a non-eccentric group. Clinical, angiographic, and echocardiographic findings of the two groups were compared. Results ARD was significantly larger in the eccentric group than in the non-eccentric group (P = 0.049), and the difference was confirmed by multivariable analysis (P = 0.02). Subgroup analysis of patients aged <55 years showed similar result for ARD (P = 0.03), whereas hypertension was more associated with the non-eccentric group (P = 0.01). In addition, height was inversely related to aneurysm size after adjustment for age, sex, weight, ARD, smoking status, and number of aneurysms (P = 0.004). Conclusions A certain group of IA patients share a common intrinsic wall defect with aortopathy. Shared neural crest cell origin may give rise to this phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2077346562,"Swedish double mutation (KM670/671NL) of amyloid precursor protein (APP) is reported to increase toxic amyloid β (Aβ) production via aberrant cleavage at the β-secretase site and thereby cause early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to AD pathogenesis remains largely unknown. Previously, our transcriptome sequence analyses revealed global expressional modifications of over 600 genes in APP-Swedish mutant-expressing H4 (H4-sw) cells compared to wild type H4 cells. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) is one gene that showed significantly decreased mRNA expression in H4-sw cells. In this study, we investigated the functional role of IGFBP3 in AD pathogenesis and elucidated the mechanisms regulating its expression. We observed decreased IGFBP3 expression in the H4-sw cell line as well as the hippocampus of AD model transgenic mice. Treatment with exogenous IGFBP3 protein inhibited Aβ1-42- induced cell death and caspase-3 activity, whereas siRNA-mediated suppression of IGFBP3 expression induced cell death and caspase-3 cleavage. In primary hippocampal neurons, administration of IGFBP3 protein blocked apoptotic cell death due to Aβ1-42 toxicity. These data implicate a protective role for IGFBP3 against Aβ1-42-mediated apoptosis. Next, we investigated the regulatory mechanisms of IGFBP3 expression in AD pathogenesis. We observed abnormal IGFBP3 hypermethylation within the promoter CpG island in H4-sw cells. Treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored IGFBP3 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. Chronic exposure to Aβ1-42 induced IGFBP3 hypermethylation at CpGs, particularly at loci -164 and -173, and subsequently suppressed IGFBP3 expression. Therefore, we demonstrate that expression of anti-apoptotic IGFBP3 is regulated by epigenetic DNA methylation, suggesting a mechanism that contributes to AD pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2146662219,"Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly used to project the potential distribution of introduced species outside their native range. Such studies rarely explicitly evaluate potential conflicts with native species should the range of introduced species expand. Two snake species native to eastern North America, Nerodia fasciata and Nerodia sipedon, have been introduced to California where they represent a new stressor to declining native amphibians, fish, and reptiles. To project the potential distributions of these non-native watersnakes in western North America, we built ensemble SDMs using MaxEnt, Boosted Regression Trees, and Random Forests and habitat and climatic variables. We then compared the overlap between the projected distribution of invasive watersnakes and the distributions of imperiled native amphibians, fish, and reptiles that can serve as prey or competitors for the invaders, to estimate the risk to native species posed by non-native watersnakes. Large areas of western North America were projected to be climatically suitable for both species of Nerodia according to our ensemble SDMs, including much of central California. The potential distributions of both N. fasciata and N. sipedon overlap extensively with the federally threatened Giant Gartersnake, Thamnophis gigas, which inhabits a similar ecological niche. N. fasciata also poses risk to the federally threatened California Tiger Salamander, Ambystoma californiense, whereas N. sipedon poses risk to some amphibians of conservation concern, including the Foothill Yellow-legged Frog, Rana boylii. We conclude that non-native watersnakes in California can likely inhabit ranges of several native species of conservation concern that are expected to suffer as prey or competing species for these invaders. Action should be taken now to eradicate or control these invasions before detrimental impacts on native species are widespread. Our methods can be applied broadly to quantify the risk posed by incipient invasions to native biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W2170770054,"Environmental legislation in the US (i.e. NEPA) requires defining baseline conditions on current rather than historical ecosystem conditions. For ecosystems with long histories of multiple environmental impacts, this baseline method can subsequently lead to a significantly altered environment; this has been termed a 'sliding baseline'. In river systems, cumulative effects caused by flow regulation, channel revetment and riparian vegetation removal significantly impact floodplain ecosystems by altering channel dynamics and precluding subsequent ecosystem processes, such as primary succession. To quantify these impacts on floodplain development processes, we used a model of river channel meander migration to illustrate the degree to which flow regulation and riprap impact migration rates, independently and synergistically, on the Sacramento River in California, USA. From pre-dam conditions, the cumulative effect of flow regulation alone on channel migration is a reduction by 38%, and 42-44% with four proposed water diversion project scenarios. In terms of depositional area, the proposed water project would reduce channel migration 51-71 ha in 130 years without current riprap in place, and 17-25 ha with riprap. Our results illustrate the utility of a modeling approach for quantifying cumulative impacts. Model-based quantification of environmental impacts allow scientists to separate cumulative and synergistic effects to analytically define mitigation measures. Additionally, by selecting an ecosystem process that is affected by multiple impacts, it is possible to consider process-based mitigation scenarios, such as the removal of riprap, to allow meander migration and create new floodplains and allow for riparian vegetation recruitment."

Erbb4 was not, however, a direct target gene for transcriptional regulation by HIF-1α in vitro. HIF-1α overexpression or HIF accumulating prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors reduced ErbB4 endocytosis, promoted transcriptional co-regulatory activity of ErbB4, and stimulated ErbB4-induced differentiation of mammary carcinoma cells. Consistently, RNA interference-mediated down-regulation of HIF-1α resulted in reduced ErbB4 protein amount and reduced mammary carcinoma cell differentiation. These findings indicate that HIF-1α is a physiologically relevant regulator of ErbB4 and that ErbB4 is involved in HIF-regulated differentiation of the mammary gland."
https://openalex.org/W2063638830,"Spastic diplegic cerebral palsy(SDCP)is a common type of cerebral palsy (CP), which presents as a group of motor-impairment syndromes. Previous conventional MRI studies have reported abnormal structural changes in SDCP, such as periventricular leucomalacia. However, there are roughly 27.8% SDCP patients presenting normal appearance in conventional MRI, which were considered as occult SDCP. In this study, sixteen patients with occult SDCP and 16 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects were collected and the data were acquired on a 3T MR system. We applied voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis to investigate whole brain grey and white matter injury in occult SDCP. By using VBM method, the grey matter volume reduction was revealed in the bilateral basal ganglia regions, thalamus, insula, and left cerebral peduncle, whereas the white matter atrophy was found to be located in the posterior part of corpus callosum and right posterior corona radiata in the occult SDCP patients. By using TBSS, reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) values were detected in multiple white matter regions, including bilateral white matter tracts in prefrontal lobe, temporal lobe, internal and external capsule, corpus callosum, cingulum, thalamus, brainstem and cerebellum. Additionally, several regions of white matter tracts injury were found to be significantly correlated with motor dysfunction. These results collectively revealed the spatial patterns of whole brain grey and white matter injury in occult SDCP."
https://openalex.org/W2133441752,"The overwhelming majority of bacteria live in slime embedded microbial communities termed biofilms, which are typically adherent to a surface. However, when several Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were cultivated in static liquid cultures, macroscopic aggregates were seen floating within the broth and also sedimented at the test tube bottom. Light- and electron microscopy revealed that early-stage aggregates consisted of bacteria and extracellular matrix, organized in sheet-like structures. Perpendicular under the sheets hung a network of periodically arranged, bacteria-associated strands. During the extended cultivation, the strands of a subpopulation of aggregates developed into cross-connected wall-like structures, in which aligned bacteria formed the walls. The resulting architecture had a compartmentalized appearance. In late-stage cultures, the wall-associated bacteria disintegrated so that, henceforth, the walls were made of the coalescing remnants of lysed bacteria, while the compartment-like organization remained intact. At the same time, the majority of strand-containing aggregates with associated culturable bacteria continued to exist. These observations indicate that some strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis are able to build highly sophisticated structures, in which a subpopulation undergoes cell lysis, presumably to provide continued access to nutrients in a nutrient-limited environment, whilst maintaining structural integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2109852132,"The disabling of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (F1NPP) resulted in the release of radionuclides, including 134Cs and 137Cs, into the air and the ocean. The unpredicted nuclear accident is of global concern for human health and the ecosystem. Although investigations of radionuclides in environments were performed shortly after the accident started, the temporal and spatial impacts and fluctuations on the releasing radionuclides to natural environment remain unclear. I focused on salmon, which migrate from inland to the open ocean globally, to reveal the three-year (May 2011 to February 2014) fluctuations and accumulations of 134Cs and 137Cs from terrestrial to open ocean environments after the F1NPP accident. The 134Cs and 137Cs concentrations in six salmonids exhibited lower temporal variations for three years after the F1NPP accident, suggesting that these radionuclides are widely distributed and these radionuclides remain in the natural environment globally with less convergence. The accumulation patterns were significantly different among the different salmon species. Fluvial (freshwater residence) type salmons exhibited significantly higher accumulation in 134Cs (25.3–40.2 Bq kg−1 in mean) and 137Cs (41.4–51.7 Bq kg−1 in mean) than did the anadromous (sea-run) type salmons (0.64–8.03 Bq kg−1 in mean 134Cs and 0.42–10.2 Bq kg−1 in mean 137Cs) suggesting widespread contamination in terrestrial environments versus the coastal and open ocean environments. Salmonids are the most highly migratory animals and are characterised by their strong tendency to return home to their natal site for reproduction. Salmonids have a potential to be a good indicator as an effective monitoring animal."
https://openalex.org/W2084232290,"In patients responding successfully to ART, the next therapeutic step is viral cure. An interesting strategy is antiviral vaccination, particularly involving CD8 T cell epitopes. However, attempts at vaccination are dependent on the immunogenetic background of individuals. The Provir/Latitude 45 project aims to investigate which CTL epitopes in proviral HIV-1 will be recognized by the immune system when HLA alleles are taken into consideration. A prior study (Papuchon et al, PLoS ONE 2013) showed that chronically-infected patients under successful ART exhibited variations of proviral CTL epitopes compared to a reference viral strain (HXB2) and that a generic vaccine may not be efficient. Here, we investigated viral and/or proviral CTL epitopes at different time points in recently infected individuals of the Canadian primary HIV infection cohort and assessed the affinity of these epitopes for HLA alleles during the study period. An analysis of the results confirms that it is not possible to fully predict which epitopes will be recognized by the HLA alleles of the patients if the reference sequences and epitopes are taken as the basis of simulation. Epitopes may be seen to vary in circulating RNA and proviral DNA. Despite this confirmation, the overall variability of the epitopes was low in these patients who are temporally close to primary infection."
