https://openalex.org/W2026661197,"Microorganisms from Hudson River sediments reductively dechlorinated most polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Aroclor 1242 under anaerobic conditions, thus demonstrating PCB dechlorination by anaerobic bacteria in the laboratory. The most rapid dechlorination was observed at the highest PCB concentration used; at 700 parts per million Aroclor, 53 percent of the total chlorine was removed in 16 weeks, and the proportion of mono- and dichlorobiphenyls increased from 9 to 88 percent. Dechlorination occurred primarily from the meta and para positions; congeners that were substituted only in the ortho position (or positions) accumulated. These dechlorination products are both less toxic and more readily degraded by aerobic bacteria. These results indicate that reductive dechlorination may be an important environmental fate of PCBs, and suggest that a sequential anaerobic-aerobic biological treatment system for PCBs may be feasible."

The origin of this pollution is widespread biomass burning in Africa. These measurements support satellite-derived tropospheric ozone data that demonstrate that ozone originating from this region is transported throughout most of the Southern Hemisphere. Seasonally high levels of carbon monoxide and methane observed at middle- and high-latitude stations in Africa, Australia, and Antarctica likely reflect the effects of this distant biomass burning. These data suggest that even the most remote regions on this planet may be significantly more polluted than previously believed."
https://openalex.org/W1973143059,"The marker bed at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary of the Beloc Formation (southern Haiti) contains abundant coarse-grained microtektites and minor amounts of shocked quartz grains in the basal part. The upper part is composed of medium-grained marl with amalgamated microtektite lenses and finer-grained marl lenses disseminated throughout. Field and petrographic observations, and the distribution of planktonic foraminifera suggest that the bed formed from a complex sequence of events. A bolide impact nearby produced microtektites that sett1led to form a nearly pure layer at the base. Vaporized materials with anomalously high extraterrestrial components settled last, along with carbonate sediments. The entire bed became sparsely consolidated. Subsequently, another major disruptive event, perhaps a giant tsunami, partly reworked the initial deposit. Cohesive fragments of the original marker bed mixed with exotic materials were redeposited as lenticular bodies. This process also may have caused further mixing of Cretaceous and Tertiary microfossils, as observed at Beloc and elsewhere."
https://openalex.org/W2053061017,"The chlorofluoromethanes (CFMs: CCl(2)F(2) and CCl(3)F), methyl chloroform (CH(3)CCl(3)), and carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) have been measured in deep waters of the Arctic Ocean. Oceanic and atmospheric inventories of these compounds result from known anthropogenic releases; because the CFMs and CCl(4) are also chemically nonreactive, they can be used as transient tracers of ocean circulation. The input history of CCl(4) is longer than that of any other transient tracer identified to date( approximately 70 years). This long input history, together with an e-folding time scale of increase(tau) of approximately 28 years, makes CCl(4) potentially the most useful tracer for calibrating models of the oceanic uptake of the fossil-fuel CO(2) transient(tau approximately 25 years). The bottom water of the Nansen Basin, Arctic Ocean, has detectable CCl(4) but undetectable CFM(s) and CH(3)CCl(3), which suggests either that the bottom water is approximately 50 years old, or that there is a small, nonanthropogenic component of atmospheric CCl(4)(<6 parts per trillion by volume)."

https://openalex.org/W1990849610,"An active fold-and-thrust belt in unchanging tectonic and climatic conditions attains a dynamic steady-state in which the influx of accreted material at the toe is balanced by the erosive efflux off the top. The overall balance of energy in such a steady-state fold-and-thrust belt is described by the equation E = W(G) + Q, where E is the rate at which both mechanical and heat energy are added from external sources, W(G) is the rate of work performed against gravitational body forces, and Q is the rate at which waste heat flows out of the upper and lower boundaries. The total amount of power being supplied to the active Taiwan fold-and-thrust belt by the subducting Eurasian plate and in situ radioactivity is 4.2 gigawatts. Because only 0.5 gigawatts are expended in doing useful work against gravity and the remaining 3.7 gigawatts are ejected as heat, the efficiency of brittle frictional mountain building in Taiwan is 11 percent."
