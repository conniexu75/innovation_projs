https://openalex.org/W2557946486,"The majority of the Earth's terrestrial carbon is stored in the soil. If anthropogenic warming stimulates the loss of this carbon to the atmosphere, it could drive further planetary warming. Despite evidence that warming enhances carbon fluxes to and from the soil, the net global balance between these responses remains uncertain. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of warming-induced changes in soil carbon stocks by assembling data from 49 field experiments located across North America, Europe and Asia. We find that the effects of warming are contingent on the size of the initial soil carbon stock, with considerable losses occurring in high-latitude areas. By extrapolating this empirical relationship to the global scale, we provide estimates of soil carbon sensitivity to warming that may help to constrain Earth system model projections. Our empirical relationship suggests that global soil carbon stocks in the upper soil horizons will fall by 30 ± 30 petagrams of carbon to 203 ± 161 petagrams of carbon under one degree of warming, depending on the rate at which the effects of warming are realized. Under the conservative assumption that the response of soil carbon to warming occurs within a year, a business-as-usual climate scenario would drive the loss of 55 ± 50 petagrams of carbon from the upper soil horizons by 2050. This value is around 12-17 per cent of the expected anthropogenic emissions over this period. Despite the considerable uncertainty in our estimates, the direction of the global soil carbon response is consistent across all scenarios. This provides strong empirical support for the idea that rising temperatures will stimulate the net loss of soil carbon to the atmosphere, driving a positive land carbon-climate feedback that could accelerate climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2559731208,"In eukaryotes, up to one-third of cellular proteins are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum, where they undergo folding, processing, sorting and trafficking to subsequent endomembrane compartments. Targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum has been shown to occur co-translationally by the signal recognition particle (SRP) pathway or post-translationally by the mammalian transmembrane recognition complex of 40 kDa (TRC40) and homologous yeast guided entry of tail-anchored proteins (GET) pathways. Despite the range of proteins that can be catered for by these two pathways, many proteins are still known to be independent of both SRP and GET, so there seems to be a critical need for an additional dedicated pathway for endoplasmic reticulum relay. We set out to uncover additional targeting proteins using unbiased high-content screening approaches. To this end, we performed a systematic visual screen using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and uncovered three uncharacterized proteins whose loss affected targeting. We suggest that these proteins work together and demonstrate that they function in parallel with SRP and GET to target a broad range of substrates to the endoplasmic reticulum. The three proteins, which we name Snd1, Snd2 and Snd3 (for SRP-independent targeting), can synthetically compensate for the loss of both the SRP and GET pathways, and act as a backup targeting system. This explains why it has previously been difficult to demonstrate complete loss of targeting for some substrates. Our discovery thus puts in place an essential piece of the endoplasmic reticulum targeting puzzle, highlighting how the targeting apparatus of the eukaryotic cell is robust, interlinked and flexible."

https://openalex.org/W2559307267,"Proper function of lysosomes is particularly important in neurons, as they cannot dilute accumulated toxic molecules and aggregates by cell division. Thus, impairment of lysosomal function plays an important role in neuronal degeneration and in the pathogenesis of numerous neurodegenerative diseases. In this work we analyzed how inhibition and/or loss of the major lysosomal proteases, the cysteine cathepsins B and L (CtsB/L), affects lysosomal function, cholesterol metabolism and degradation of the key Alzheimer's disease (AD) proteins. Here, we show that cysteine CtsB/L, and not the aspartyl cathepsin D (CtsD), represent a major lysosomal protease(s) that control lysosomal function, intracellular cholesterol trafficking and AD-like amyloidogenic features. Intriguingly, accumulation of free cholesterol in late endosomes/lysosomes upon CtsB/L inhibition resembled a phenotype characteristic for the rare neurodegenerative disorder Niemann-Pick type C (NPC). CtsB/L inhibition and not the inhibition of CtsD led to lysosomal impairment assessed by decreased degradation of EGF receptor, enhanced LysoTracker staining and accumulation of several lysosomal proteins LC3II, NPC1 and NPC2. By measuring the levels of NPC1 and ABCA1, the two major cholesterol efflux proteins, we showed that CtsB/L inhibition or genetic depletion caused accumulation of the NPC1 in lysosomes and downregulation of ABCA1 protein levels and its expression. Furthermore, we revealed that CtsB/L are involved in degradation of the key Alzheimer's proteins: amyloid-β peptides (Aβ) and C-terminal fragments of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and in degradation of β-secretase (BACE1). Our results imply CtsB/L as major regulators of lysosomal function and demonstrate that CtsB/L may play an important role in intracellular cholesterol trafficking and in degradation of the key AD proteins. Our findings implicate that enhancing the activity or levels of CtsB/L could provide a promising and a common strategy for maintaining lysosomal function and for preventing and/or treating neurodegenerative diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2557756284,"The cytokine IL-10 has potent antifibrotic effects in models of adult fibrosis, but the mechanisms of action are unclear. Here, we report a novel finding that IL-10 triggers a signal transducer and activator of transcription 3(STAT3)–dependent signaling pathway that regulates hyaluronan (HA) metabolism and drives adult fibroblasts to synthesize an HA-rich pericellular matrix, which mimics the fetal regenerative wound healing phenotype with reduced fibrosis. By using cre-lox-mediated novel, inducible, fibroblast-, keratinocyte-, and wound-specific STAT3-knockdown postnatal mice—plus syngeneic fibroblast cell-transplant models—we demonstrate that the regenerative effects of IL-10 in postnatal wounds are dependent on HA synthesis and fibroblast-specific STAT3-dependent signaling. The importance of IL-10-induced HA synthesis for regenerative wound healing is demonstrated by inhibition of HA synthesis in a murine wound model by administering 4-methylumbelliferone. Although IL-10 and STAT3 signaling were intact, the antifibrotic repair phenotype that is induced by IL-10 overexpression was abrogated in this model. Our data show a novel role for IL-10 beyond its accepted immune-regulatory mechanism. The opportunity for IL-10 to regulate a fibroblast-specific formation of a regenerative, HA-rich wound extracellular matrix may lead to the development of innovative therapies to attenuate postnatal fibrosis in organ systems or diseases in which dysregulated inflammation and HA intersect.—Balaji, S., Wang, X., King, A., Le, L.

https://openalex.org/W2558185744,"Modulation of T cell proliferation and function by immunoregulatory myeloid cells are an essential means of preventing self-reactivity and restoring tissue homeostasis. Consumption of amino acids such as arginine and tryptophan by immunoregulatory macrophages is one pathway that suppresses local T cell proliferation. Using a reduced complexity in vitro macrophage-T cell co-culture system, we show that macrophage arginase-1 is the only factor required by M2 macrophages to block T cells in G1, and this effect is mediated by l-arginine elimination rather than metabolite generation. Tracking how T cells adjust their metabolism when deprived of arginine revealed the significance of macrophage-mediated arginine deprivation to T cells. We found mTORC1 activity was unaffected in the initial G1 block. After 2 days of arginine deprivation, mTORC1 activity declined paralleling a selective down-regulation of SREBP target gene expression, whereas mRNAs involved in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and T cell activation were unaffected. Cell cycle arrest was reversible at any point by exogenous arginine, suggesting starved T cells remain poised awaiting nutrients. Arginine deprivation-induced cell cycle arrest was mediated in part by Rictor/mTORC2, providing evidence that this nutrient recognition pathway is a central component of how T cells measure environmental arginine."
https://openalex.org/W2557546772,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of the synthetic peptide hLF1-11 against biofilm produced by clinical isolates of Candida albicans with different fluconazole susceptibility. The antibiofilm activity of the peptide hLF1-11 was assessed in terms of reduction of biofilm cellular density, metabolic activity and sessile cell viability. The extent of morphogenesis in hLF1-11 treated and untreated biofilms was also investigated microscopically. Transcription levels of genes related to cell adhesion, hyphal development and extracellular matrix production were analysed by qRT-PCR in hLF1-11 treated and untreated biofilms. Exogenous dibutyryl-cAMP (db-cAMP) was used to rescue morphogenesis in cells exposed to the peptide. The results revealed that hLF1-11 exhibited an inhibitory effect on biofilm formation by all C. albicans isolates tested in a dose-dependent manner, regardless of their fluconazole susceptibility. Visual inspection of treated or untreated biofilm cells with an inverted microscope revealed a significant reduction in hyphal formation by hLF1-11 treated cells, as early as 3 hours of incubation. Moreover, hLF1-11 showed a reduced activity on preadherent cells. hLF1-11 induced the down-regulation of biofilm and hyphal-associated genes, which were predominantly regulated via the Ras1-cAMP-Efg1 pathway. Indeed, exogenous db-cAMP restored morphogenesis in hLF1-11 treated cells. The hLF1-11 peptide significantly inhibited biofilm formation by C. albicans mainly at early stages, interfering with biofilm cellular density and metabolic activity, and affected morphogenesis through the Ras1-cAMP-Efg1 pathway. Our findings provide the first evidence that hLF1-11 could represent a potential candidate for the prevention of biofilm formation by C. albicans."

Methylglyoxal is detoxified by the Glyoxalase system, consisting of two enzymes, Glo1 and Glo2, that act sequentially to convert MG into d-lactate. Recently, the Parkinsonism-associated protein DJ-1 was described in vitro to have glyoxalase activity, thereby detoxifying the MG metabolite, or deglycase activity, thereby removing the adduct formed by MG on proteins. Since Drosophila is an established model system to study signaling, neurodegeneration, and metabolic regulation in vivo, we asked whether DJ-1 contributes to MG detoxification in vivo. Using both DJ-1 knockdown in Drosophila cells in culture, and DJ-1β knock-out flies, we could detect no contribution of DJ-1 to survival to MG challenge or to accumulation of MG protein adducts. Furthermore, we provide data suggesting that the previously reported deglycation activity of DJ-1 can be ascribed to a TRIS buffer artifact.

https://openalex.org/W2557427824,"The environment surrounding the embryos has a profound impact on the developmental process and phenotypic outcomes of the organism. In species with temperature-dependent sex determination, gonadal sex is determined by the incubation temperature of the eggs. A mechanistic link between temperature and transcriptional regulation of developmental genes, however, remains elusive. In this study, we examine the changes in DNA methylation and histone modification patterns of the aromatase (cyp19a1) gene in embryonic gonads of red-eared slider turtles (Trachemys scripta) subjected to a temperature shift during development. Shifting embryos from a male-producing temperature (MPT) to a female-producing temperature (FPT) at the beginning of the temperature-sensitive period (TSP) resulted in an increase in aromatase mRNA expression while a shift from FPT to MPT resulted in decreased expression. DNA methylation levels at CpG sites in the promoter of the aromatase gene were high (70–90%) at the beginning of TSP, but decreased in embryos that were incubated at constant FPT and those shifted from MPT to the FPT. This decrease in methylation in the promoter inversely correlated with the expected increase in aromatase expression at the FPT. The active demethylation under the FPT was especially prominent at the CpG site upstream of the gonad-specific TATA box at the beginning of TSP and spread downstream of the gene including exon1 as the gonad development progressed. In embryos incubated at FPT, the promoter region was also labeled by canonical transcriptional activation markers, H3K4me3 and RNA polymerase II. A transcriptional repression marker, H3K27me3, was observed in temperature-shifted gonads of both temperature groups, but was not maintained throughout the development in either group. Our findings suggest that DNA hypomethylation and H3K4me3 modification at the aromatase promoter may be a primary mechanism that releases a transcriptional block of aromatase to initiate a cascade of ovarian differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2557522055,"Oleanolic acid (OA) is an active component of the traditional Chinese herb Olea europaea L. and has been found to exhibit a significant lipid-lowering effect; however, its direct molecular target is still unknown, which limits its clinical application and the possible structure modification to improve its beneficial functions. In this regard, we carried out the present study to identify potential hepatic targets of OA to mediate its lipid-lowering effect. We found that both acute and chronic OA treatments reduced serum levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol, and decreased hepatic expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1β (PGC-1β), which is an important regulator in maintaining hepatic lipid homeostasis, and its downstream target genes. Of note, liver-specific knockdown of PGC-1β recapitulated the hypolipidemic effects of OA. At the molecular level, OA accelerated mRNA degradation of PGC-1β. Microarray analysis revealed a host of micro-RNAs that potentially mediate OA-induced PGC-1β mRNA degradation, among which, miR-98-5p significantly inhibited activity of Pgc-1β 3′ UTR as well as PGC-1β expression and promoted its mRNA degradation. Conversely, miR-98-5p inhibitors blunted the inhibitory effects of OA on PGC-1β expression. Collectively, our data demonstrated that OA ameliorated hyperlipidemia, likely via regulation of the miR-98-5p/PGC-1β axis.—Chen, S., Wen, X., Zhang, W., Wang, C., Liu, J., Liu, C.

We have validated surgical and vector parameters to define a means to provide a robust over-expression of alpha-synuclein which is associated with Lewy-like pathology and robust degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, an AAV1/2 vector incorporating strong transcription and transduction regulatory elements was used to deliver the gene for the human A53T mutation of alpha-synuclein. When injected into 4 sites within each substantia nigra (7 μl per site, 1.7 x 1012 gp/ml), this vector provided expression lasting at least 4 months, and a 50% loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons and a 60% reduction in striatal dopamine. Further studies will be required to develop this methodology into a validated model of value as a drug development platform."

The recent decline of these agents in Europe and North America has aroused the concern of a potential global pollinator crisis. In order to prioritize efforts for pollinator conservation, we evaluated the extent to which food production depends on animal pollinators in Brazil-one of the world's agriculture leaders-by comparing cultivated area, produced volume and yield value of major food crops that are pollinator dependent with those that are pollinator non-dependent. In addition, we valued the ecosystem service of pollination based on the degree of pollinator dependence of each crop and the consequence of a decline in food production to the Brazilian Gross Domestic Product and Brazilian food security. A total of 68% of the 53 major food crops in Brazil depend to some degree on animals for pollination. Pollinator non-dependent crops produce a greater volume of food, mainly because of the high production of sugarcane, but the cultivated area and monetary value of pollinator dependent crops are higher (59% of total cultivated area and 68% of monetary value). The loss of pollination services for 29 of the major food crops would reduce production by 16.55-51 million tons, which would amount to 4.86-14.56 billion dollars/year, and reduce the agricultural contribution to the Brazilian GDP by 6.46%- 19.36%. These impacts would be largely absorbed by family farmers, which represent 74.4% of the agricultural labor force in Brazil. The main effects of a pollinator crisis in Brazil would be felt by the poorer and more rural classes due to their lower income and direct or exclusive dependence on this ecosystem service."

Here, we identify Ras/Rap1GAP Rasa3 (GAP1IP4BP) as a major phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate-binding protein in human platelets and a key regulator of integrin αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling. We demonstrate that cytosolic Rasa3 translocates to the plasma membrane in a PI3K-dependent manner upon activation of human platelets. Expression of wild-type Rasa3 in integrin αIIbβ3-expressing CHO cells blocked Rap1 activity and integrin αIIbβ3-mediated spreading on fibrinogen. In contrast, Rap1GAP-deficient (P489V) and Ras/Rap1GAP-deficient (R371Q) Rasa3 had no effect. We furthermore show that two Rasa3 mutants (H794L and G125V), which are expressed in different mouse models of thrombocytopenia, lack both Ras and Rap1GAP activity and do not affect integrin αIIbβ3-mediated spreading of CHO cells on fibrinogen. Platelets from thrombocytopenic mice expressing GAP-deficient Rasa3 (H794L) show increased spreading on fibrinogen, which in contrast to wild-type platelets is insensitive to PI3K inhibitors.

We investigated the effect of piceatannol on renal fibrosis and histone deacetylase (HDAC) expression in a mouse model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Fibrosis was established by UUO and piceatannol was intraperitoneally injected for 2 weeks. Piceatannol suppressed extracellular matrix (ECM) protein deposition including collagen type I and fibronectin as well as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in UUO kidneys. However, the expressions of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker genes, such as N-cadherin and E-cadherin, were not changed in the kidneys after UUO. Masson’s trichrome staining and fluorescence immunostaining showed that piceatannol administration attenuated collagen deposition in UUO kidneys. HDAC1, HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC6, and HDAC10 protein expression was upregulated in UUO kidneys, whereas that of HDAC8 was downregulated. Piceatannol treatment significantly reduced HDAC4 and HDAC5 protein expression. Further, piceatannol attenuated phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK) in UUO kidneys, but not that of transforming growth factor beta1-Smad2/3. These results suggest that class I HDACs and class IIa/b HDACs are involved in renal fibrosis development.

https://openalex.org/W2559323428,"Targeted inhibitors of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), such as trastuzumab and lapatinib, are among the first examples of molecularly targeted cancer therapy and have proven largely effective for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancers. However, approximately half of those patients either do not respond to these therapies or develop secondary resistance. Although a few signaling pathways have been implicated, a comprehensive understanding of mechanisms underlying HER2 inhibitor drug resistance is still lacking. To address this critical question, we undertook a concerted approach using patient expression data sets, HER2-positive cell lines, and tumor samples biopsied both before and after trastuzumab treatment. Together, these methods revealed that high expression and activation of a specific subset of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) was strongly associated with poor clinical prognosis and the development of resistance. Mechanistically, these RTKs are capable of maintaining downstream signal transduction to promote tumor growth via the suppression of cellular senescence. Consequently, these findings provide the rationale for the design of therapeutic strategies for overcoming drug resistance in breast cancer via combinational inhibition of the limited number of targets from this specific subset of RTKs."

With the exception of the region spanning α-helices F (residues 182–194) and G (residues 202–219), which is rich in arginine residues and thought to promote ribosome binding through electrostatic interactions, no other functionality has been ascribed to RTA’s secondary elements or solvent-exposed surface. Establishing a comprehensive molecular B cell epitope map of RTA is of importance in terms of facilitating design of more effective RTA-based immunotoxins for cancer therapy (8Castelletti D.

The camelid library (referred to as “HobJo”) has an estimated diversity of >107 independent clones and was generated from two animals that had been repeatedly immunized with a mixture of recombinant non-toxic RTA, RTB, and ricin toxoid (16Vance D.J.

Analysis to date has suggested that there are (at least) four immunodominant regions on RTA, which we refer to as epitope clusters I–IV. The four clusters are represented by the following toxin-neutralizing mAbs: PB10 (I), SyH7 (II), IB2 (III), and GD12 (IV) (14O'Hara J.M. Kasten-Jolly J.C. Reynolds C.E. Mantis N.J.

At the structural level, cluster I epitopes encompass α-helix B (residues 98–106), β-strand h (residues 113–117), and the C terminus of α-helix D (residues 154–156). In general, we found that within cluster I, ricin toxin neutralizing activity correlated with the degree of interaction between the VHH and RTA, particularly α-helix B (17Rudolph M.J. Vance D.J. Cassidy M.S. Rong Y. Shoemaker C.B. Mantis N.J.

Biol. 2014; 426: 3057-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Moreover, the interactions between the different VHHs and RTA were largely dictated by the CDR3 elements. Finally, our original assumption that neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies would occupy spatially distinct structural epitopes on the surface of RTA was proven incorrect. Instead, we found several examples in which non-neutralizing antibody epitopes were nested within the footprints of neutralizing antibodies. In this study, we have embarked on an effort to define structural B cell epitopes within cluster II. As noted above, cluster II is defined by SyH7, a toxin-neutralizing mAb that was first identified based on its reactivity with a peptide spanning RTA residues 187–198 (15O'Hara J.M. Neal L.M. McCarthy E.A. Kasten-Jolly J.A. Brey 3rd, R.N. Mantis N.J. Folding domains within the ricin toxin A subunit as targets of protective antibodies.Vaccine. 2010; 28: 7035-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition to its in vitro activities, SyH7 is able to passively protect mice against systemic 10× lethal dose 50 (LD50) ricin challenge. We subsequently identified three additional toxin-neutralizing mAbs, TB12, PA1, and PH12, that recognize discontinuous epitopes within cluster II (14O'Hara J.M. Kasten-Jolly J.C. Reynolds C.E. Mantis N.J. Localization of non-linear neutralizing B cell epitopes on ricin toxin's enzymatic subunit (RTA).Immunol. Lett. 2014; 158: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The epitopes recognized by SyH7, TB12, PA1, and PH12 are distinct from each other, as determined by HX-MS.5 Because all four cluster II mAbs neutralize ricin in vitro and in vivo, we have proposed that their epitopes represent a particular site of vulnerability on the toxin. We report here the X-ray crystal structures of three different cluster II VHHs in complex with RTA, including one VHH whose epitope possibly spans the interface between RTA and RTB. This study affords the first structural insight into the nature of epitope cluster II and reveals possible mechanisms by which antibodies directed against this region of RTA neutralize the toxin. As part of this study, the HobJo phage-displayed single domain VHH library was panned against several different ricin-derived targets, including RTA directly immobilized on polystyrene plates and ricin holotoxin captured via the surrogate receptor (ASF). However, to specifically enrich for cluster II-specific antibodies, the library was panned against ricin captured via JIV-F5 to broadly mask epitope cluster I and in the presence of saturating amounts of JIV-F6 to occlude epitope cluster III (16Vance D.J. Tremblay J.M. Mantis N.J. Shoemaker C.B. Stepwise engineering of heterodimeric single domain camelid VHH antibodies that passively protect mice from ricin toxin.J. Biol.

The screening approaches yielded three different RTA-specific VHHs as follows: E1, V1C7, and V5E1. The antibodies were unique from all other previously identified VHHs based on the primary amino acid sequence of their respective CDR1–3 elements (Fig. 1A). The VHHs also differed in binding affinities (KD) for ricin toxin, as determined by SPR; V5E1 had the highest affinity (KD 20 pm), followed by E1 (690 pm) and V1C7 (3.17 nm) (Table 1). In a cell-based toxin-neutralizing assay, V5E1 was a potent inhibitor of ricin (IC50 <1 nm), whereas E1 and V1C7 were classified as weak inhibitors (IC50 >100 nm) (Fig. 1B).TABLE 1Summary of RTA-VHH binding data and interface informationVHHKDaKD (× 10−9 m); Ka (1/ms); Kd (1/s); IC50 (× 10−9 m).KaaKD (× 10−9 m); Ka (1/ms); Kd (1/s); IC50 (× 10−9 m).KdaKD (× 10−9 m); Ka (1/ms); Kd (1/s); IC50 (× 10−9 m).IC50aKD (× 10−9 m); Ka (1/ms); Kd (1/s); IC50 (× 10−9 m).CDR3bAmino acid length of CDR3 is given.H-bondscH-bonds are between RTA and VHH (total) and CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3, respectively.BSATotalCDR1/2/3Å2E10.73.5 × 1052.4 × 10−41701916d16 and 22 refer to different RTA-E1 copies in the asymmetric units, as shown in the supplemental material.4/0/10163422d16 and 22 refer to different RTA-E1 copies in the asymmetric units, as shown in the supplemental material.8/0/122029V1C73.29.1 × 1042.9 × 10−4NDeAn actual IC50 value is not reported for V1C7 because at 330 nm (the highest antibody concentration tested) it displayed only 30–40% toxin neutralizing activity, as shown in Fig. 1.17120/5/71440V5E10.022.2 × 1054.2 × 10−60.519102/0/51133a KD (× 10−9 m); Ka (1/ms); Kd (1/s); IC50 (× 10−9 m).b Amino acid length of CDR3 is given.c H-bonds are between RTA and VHH (total) and CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3, respectively.d 16 and 22 refer to different RTA-E1 copies in the asymmetric units, as shown in the supplemental material.e An actual IC50 value is not reported for V1C7 because at 330 nm (the highest antibody concentration tested) it displayed only 30–40% toxin neutralizing activity, as shown in Fig. 1. Open table in a new tab The three VHHs, E1, V1C7, and V5E1, each recognized receptor-bound ricin, as well as ricin that had been captured with representative cluster I (PB10 and WECB2), III (IB2), and IV (GD12) mAbs (Fig. 2). However, the VHHs were inhibited from binding to ricin that had been captured by cluster II-specific antibodies SyH7, PA1, PH12, and TB12 (Figs. 2A and 3). V5E1 was interesting in this regard because binding to ricin holotoxin was inhibited by SyH7, PA1, and TB12 but not by PH12 (Fig. 2B), revealing a previously unrecognized spatial complexity within cluster II. In pairwise competition ELISAs, E1 and V1C7 inhibited each other from binding to ricin but had little or no effect on V5E1 (Fig. 4). Conversely, V5E1 had little or no effect on E1 or V1C7, although it did (of course) inhibit itself from binding ricin. In summary, the three cluster II-specific VHHs, E1, V1C7, and V5E1, likely represent two distinct structural epitopes within cluster II as follows: E1 and V1C7 bind epitope(s) associated with weaker toxin neutralizing activity and V5E1 binds an epitope associated with stronger neutralizing activity.FIGURE 3Characterization of epitope cluster II mAbs.

To test this hypothesis, SyH7, PA1, PH12, or TB12 was mixed with a molar excess of E1 or V1C7 and then tested in a cell-based toxin neutralizing assay. We observed that E1 and V1C7 interfered (to varying degrees) with the neutralizing activities of PA1, PH12, and TB12 but had only a marginal effect on SyH7 (Fig. 5). For example, Vero cell viability was 100% in the presence of ricin and 0.8 nm PA1. In contrast, upon addition of molar excess amounts of E1 and V1C7, Vero cell viability in the presence of 0.8 nm PA1 declined to <20% (Fig. 5B). For reasons that are not immediately apparent, SyH7 was largely refractory to the effects of E1 and V1C7, as evidenced by only a slight change in SyH7’s IC50 value upon addition of E1 and V1C7. To elucidate the exact epitopes recognized by the three cluster II VHHs, we solved the X-ray crystal structures of E1, V1C7, and V5E1 in complex with RTA, at 3.1, 1.8, and 1.7 Å, respectively (TABLE 1, TABLE 2; Fig. 6). In all three complexes, the VHHs assumed a classical immunoglobulin fold consisting of nine β-strands arranged in two β-sheets with all three CDRs on one face of the molecule (Fig. 7). E1 displayed the canonical disulfide bond between Cys-22 and Cys-96 that links FR1 to FR3 (20Muyldermans S. Cambillau C. Wyns L. Recognition of antigens by single-domain antibody fragments: the superfluous luxury of paired domains.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 230-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), whereas V1C7 did not (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 7). We postulate that the absence of this disulfide bond in V1C7 is due to the low pH (pH 4.6) of the crystallization conditions of the V1C7-RTA complex. Low pH is known to favor the reduction of disulfide bonds, and this was the only relative condition that differed among the three VHH-RTA complexes.TABLE 2Summary of RTA-VHH structuresE1aAll complexes were formed by co-crystallization.V1C7aAll complexes were formed by co-crystallization.V5E1aAll complexes were formed by co-crystallization.dmin (Å)3.11.81.7Space groupF222P3221P21RbR = Σ‖Fo| − |Fc‖/Σ‖Fo‖, where Fo and Fc denote observed and calculated structure factors, respectively./RfreecRfree was calculated using 5% of data excluded from refinement.

Two other potent ricin toxin-neutralizing VHHs, E5 and F5, exhibit this same secondary disulfide bond (17Rudolph M.J. Vance D.J. Cassidy M.S. Rong Y. Shoemaker C.B. Mantis N.J.

Biol. 2014; 426: 3057-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which makes it tempting to speculate that stabilizing CDR2-CDR3 through a covalent linkage positively impacts toxin neutralizing activity. Finally, we noted that RTA assumed a very similar conformation in all three RTA-VHH complexes, as evidenced by root mean square deviation values of 0.5 to 0.6 Å when Cα atoms of RTA (PDB code 1RTC) were superimposed onto each of the RTA-VHH crystal structures. Thus, RTA does not undergo any significant conformational changes upon complex formation with E1, V1C7, or V5E1. As an aside, shape complementarity is not a strong predictor of either relative binding affinity or toxin neutralizing activity, as evidenced by the fact that V5E1 had a shape complementarity score of 0.66, as compared with E1 and V1C7, which had higher shape complementarity scores of 0.76 and 0.75, respectively (data not shown). Thus, other factors must account for differences in toxin neutralizing activity observed among the three different VHHs. The region of RTA that contains SyH7’s linear epitope, residues 187–198, is in close proximity to secondary structural elements that are likely to constitute the epitopes of other cluster II mAbs like PA1, PH12, and TB12, as well as E1, V1C7, and V5E1 (Fig. 3). These structural elements include six α-helices (A and C–G), three loop regions between α-helices C-D, D-E, and F-G, a single 310-helix between α-helices C and D (referred to as 310-helix C-D), the loops between α-helix A and β-strand a, and β-strands e and d (referred to as loops A-a and e-d) (6Montfort W.

Analysis of the VHH-RTA crystal structures revealed that E1 and V1C7 recognize overlapping but distinct epitopes on RTA. E1 makes contact with α-helix C (residue 130), α-helix D (residues 142 and 145–147), and α-helix E (residues 166, 167, and 170). E1 also interacts with loops e-d (residues 65–67), C-D (residues 131–132), D-E (residues 156,158), F-G (residues 197,199), as well as the 310-helix C-D (residues 135–136) (Fig. 8A). V1C7’s interface with RTA is limited to α-helix D (residues 141–142, 145–146, 149, and 153) and α-helix E (residue 163), along with several additional interactions with loops e-d (residues 65–68), C-D (residue 138), D-E (residues 157–160), and F-G (residues 195, 197) (Fig. 8B). As compared with V1C7, E1 forms as many as 10 additional hydrogen bonds with RTA (12 versus 22), depending on which of the six RTA-E1 complexes within the asymmetric unit is used to analyze the RTA-E1 interface (Table 1; supplemental Fig. S1). E1 establishes a buried surface area (bsa) with RTA of ∼2,000 Å2, composed of 63% non-polar and 37% polar atoms. This is in contrast to V1C7, which has a bsa of 1,440 Å2 with RTA, consisting of 59% non-polar and 41% polar atoms (Fig. 8, D and E). Altogether, the larger E1-RTA interface with more H-bonds likely contributes significantly to the 5-fold stronger binding affinity of E1 for ricin toxin, as compared with V1C7 (Table 1). E1 and V1C7 each form one salt-bridge with RTA as follows: E1 residue Lys-114 interacts with Arg-166 of RTA, and V1C7 residue Asp-59 binds Arg-197 in RTA. It is unclear at this time whether the differences in toxin neutralizing activity between E1 and V1C7 are associated with E1’s greater degree of interaction with RTA, different contact residues on RTA, and/or its enhanced af"
https://openalex.org/W2558292076,"Understanding movement patterns and home range of species is paramount in ecology; it is particularly important for threatened taxa as it can provide valuable information for conservation management. To address this knowledge gap for a range-restricted endangered bird, we estimated home range size, daily movement patterns and habitat use of a granivorous subspecies in northeast Australia, the black-throated finch (Poephila cincta cincta; BTF) using radio-tracking and re-sighting of colour banded birds. Little is known about basic aspects of its ecology including movement patterns and home range sizes. From 2011–2014 we colour-banded 102 BTF and radio-tracked 15 birds. We generated home ranges (calculated using kernel and Minimum Convex Polygons techniques of the 15 tracked BTF). More than 50% of the re-sightings occurred within 200 m of the banding site (n = 51 out of 93 events) and within 100 days of capture. Mean home-range estimates with kernel (50%, 95% probability) and Minimum Convex Polygons were 10.59 ha, 50.79 ha and 46.27 ha, respectively. Home range size differed between two capture sites but no seasonal differences were observed. BTF home ranges overlapped four habitat types among eight available. Habitat selection was different from random at Site 1 (χ2 = 373.41, df = 42, p<0.001) and Site 2 (χ2 = 1896.1, df = 45, p<0.001); however, the preferred habitats differed between the two sites. BTF moved further than expected on the basis of current knowledge, with three individuals being resighted over 15 km from the banding location. However, BTF maintain small home ranges over short time-frames. Occasional long-distance movements may be related to resource bottleneck periods. Daily movement patterns differed between sites, which is likely linked to the fact that the sites differ in the spatial distribution of resources. The work provides information about home range sizes and local movement of BTF that will be valuable for targeting effective management and conservation strategies for this endangered granivore."
https://openalex.org/W2558508376,"T-cell cross-reactivity is essential for effective immune surveillance but has also been implicated as a pathway to autoimmunity. Previous studies have demonstrated that T-cell receptors (TCRs) that focus on a minimal motif within the peptide are able to facilitate a high level of T-cell cross-reactivity. However, the structural database shows that most TCRs exhibit less focused antigen binding involving contact with more peptide residues. To further explore the structural features that allow the clonally expressed TCR to functionally engage with multiple peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs), we examined the ILA1 CD8+ T-cell clone that responds to a peptide sequence derived from human telomerase reverse transcriptase. The ILA1 TCR contacted its pMHC with a broad peptide binding footprint encompassing spatially distant peptide residues. Despite the lack of focused TCR-peptide binding, the ILA1 T-cell clone was still cross-reactive. Overall, the TCR-peptide contacts apparent in the structure correlated well with the level of degeneracy at different peptide positions. Thus, the ILA1 TCR was less tolerant of changes at peptide residues that were at, or adjacent to, key contact sites. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms that control T-cell cross-reactivity with important implications for pathogen surveillance, autoimmunity, and transplant rejection. T-cell cross-reactivity is essential for effective immune surveillance but has also been implicated as a pathway to autoimmunity. Previous studies have demonstrated that T-cell receptors (TCRs) that focus on a minimal motif within the peptide are able to facilitate a high level of T-cell cross-reactivity. However, the structural database shows that most TCRs exhibit less focused antigen binding involving contact with more peptide residues. To further explore the structural features that allow the clonally expressed TCR to functionally engage with multiple peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs), we examined the ILA1 CD8+ T-cell clone that responds to a peptide sequence derived from human telomerase reverse transcriptase. The ILA1 TCR contacted its pMHC with a broad peptide binding footprint encompassing spatially distant peptide residues. Despite the lack of focused TCR-peptide binding, the ILA1 T-cell clone was still cross-reactive. Overall, the TCR-peptide contacts apparent in the structure correlated well with the level of degeneracy at different peptide positions. Thus, the ILA1 TCR was less tolerant of changes at peptide residues that were at, or adjacent to, key contact sites. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms that control T-cell cross-reactivity with important implications for pathogen surveillance, autoimmunity, and transplant rejection."

This pilot study aimed to test the effectiveness of an acute treatment with a long-chain omega-3 lipid emulsion (Omegaven 10%®, OGV) that contains fish oil (DHA 18 mg/ml; EPA 21 mg/ml) and α-tocopherol (0.2 mg/ml) in a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of ischemic stroke in mice. For this purpose, female CD-1 mice were anesthetized and subjected to 90 minutes of MCAO. To reflect a clinically relevant situation for an acute treatment, either after induction of stroke or after reperfusion, a single dose of OGV was injected intravenously into the tail vein (5 ml/kg b.w.). A neurological severity score was used to assess motor function and neurological outcome. Stroke-related parameters were determined 24 hours after MCAO. Microdialysis was used to collect samples from extracellular space of the striatum. Mitochondrial function was determined in isolated mitochondria or dissociated brain cells. Inflammation markers were measured in brain homogenate. According to control experiments, neuroprotective effects could be attributed to the long-chain omega-3 content of the emulsion. Intravenous injection of OGV reduced size and severity of stroke, restored mitochondrial function, and prevented excitotoxic glutamate release. Increases of pro-inflammatory markers (COX-2 and IL-6) were attenuated. Neurological severity scoring and neurochemical data demonstrated that acute OGV treatment shortly after induction of stroke was most efficient and able to improve short-term neurological outcome, reflecting the importance of an acute treatment to improve the outcome. Summarising, acute treatment of stroke with a single intravenous dose of OGV provided strong neuroprotective effects and was most effective when given immediately after onset of ischemia. As OGV is an approved fishoil emulsion for parenteral nutrition in humans, our results may provide first translational data for a possible early management of ischemic stroke with administration of OGV to prevent further brain damage."

To better understand the metabolism of triglyceride synthesis in algae, we examined their metabolic origins in the model species, Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C169, using stable isotopic labeling. Labeling patterns arising from [U-13C]glucose, 13CO2, or D2O supplementation were analyzed by GC-MS and/or LC-MS over time courses during nitrogen starvation to address the roles of catabolic carbon recycling, acyl chain redistribution, and de novo fatty acid (FA) synthesis during the expansion of the lipid bodies. The metabolic origin of stress-induced triglyceride was found to be a continuous 8:2 ratio between de novo synthesized FA and acyl chain transfer from pre-stressed membrane lipids with little input from lipid remodeling. Membrane lipids were continually synthesized with associated acyl chain editing during nitrogen stress, in contrast to an overall decrease in total membrane lipid. The incorporation rates of de novo synthesized FA into lipid classes were measured over a time course of nitrogen starvation. The synthesis of triglycerides, phospholipids, and galactolipids followed a two-stage pattern where nitrogen starvation resulted in a 2.5-fold increase followed by a gradual decline. Acyl chain flux into membrane lipids was dominant in the first stage followed by triglycerides. These data indicate that the level of metabolic control that determines acyl chain flux between membrane lipids and triglycerides during nitrogen stress relies primarily on the Kennedy pathway and de novo FA synthesis with limited, defined input from acyl editing reactions.

https://openalex.org/W2559645708,"The hallmark lesion of tuberculosis in humans and animals is the granuloma. The granuloma represents a distinct host cellular immune response composed of epithelioid macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells, often surrounding a caseous necrotic core. Within the granuloma, host-pathogen interactions determine disease outcome. Factors within the granulomas such as cytokines and chemokines drive cell recruitment, activity, function and ultimately the success or failure of the host's ability to control infection. Hence, an understanding of the granuloma-level cytokine response is necessary to understand tuberculosis pathogenesis. In-situ cytokine expression patterns were measured using a novel in situ hybridization assay, known as RNAScope® in granulomas of the lungs, tracheobronchial lymph nodes and caudal mediastinal lymph nodes of cattle experimentally infected with Mycobacterium bovis via aerosol exposure. In spite of microscopic morphological similarities, significant differences were seen between late stage granulomas of the lung compared to those of the tracheobronchial lymph nodes for IL-17A, IFN-γ, TGF-β, IL10 and IL-22 but not for TNF-α. Additionally, significant differences were noted between granulomas from two different thoracic lymph nodes that both receive afferent lymphatics from the lungs (i.e., tracheobronchial and caudal mediastinal lymph nodes) for TNF-α, IL-17A, IFN-γ, TGF-β and IL-10 but not for IL-22. These findings show that granuloma morphology alone is not a reliable indicator of granuloma function as granulomas of similar morphologies can have disparate cytokine expression patterns. Moreover, anatomically distinct lymph nodes (tracheobronchial vs caudal mediastinal) differ in cytokine expression patterns even when both receive afferent lymphatics from a lung containing tuberculoid granulomas. These findings show that selection of tissue and anatomic location are critical factors in assessing host immune response to M. bovis and should be considered carefully."
https://openalex.org/W2559063525,"Background Sex and age strongly influence the pathophysiology of human lungs, but scarce information is available about their effects on pulmonary gene expression. Methods We followed a discovery-validation strategy to identify sex- and age-related transcriptional differences in lung. Results We identified transcriptional profiles significantly associated with sex (215 genes; FDR < 0.05) and age at surgery (217 genes) in non-involved lung tissue resected from 284 lung adenocarcinoma patients. When these profiles were tested in three independent series of non-tumor lung tissue from an additional 1,111 patients, we validated the association with sex and age for 25 and 22 genes, respectively. Among the 17 sex-biased genes mapping on chromosome X, 16 have been reported to escape X-chromosome inactivation in other tissues or cells, suggesting that this mechanism influences lung transcription too. Our 22 age-related genes partially overlap with genes modulated by age in other tissues, suggesting that the aging process has similar consequences on gene expression in different organs. Finally, seven genes whose expression was modulated by sex in non-tumor lung tissue, but no age-related gene, were also validated using publicly available data from 990 lung adenocarcinoma samples, suggesting that the physiological regulatory mechanisms are only partially active in neoplastic tissue. Conclusions Gene expression in non-tumor lung tissue is modulated by both sex and age. These findings represent a validated starting point for research on the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed differences in the course of lung diseases among men and women of different ages."
https://openalex.org/W2559057397,"Assessing energy gain and expenditure in free ranging marine predators is difficult. However, such measurements are critical if we are to understand how variation in foraging efficiency, and in turn individual body condition, is impacted by environmentally driven changes in prey abundance and/or accessibility. To investigate the influence of oceanographic habitat type on foraging efficiency, ten post-breeding female southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina (SES) were equipped and tracked with bio-loggers to give continuous information of prey catch attempts, body density and body activity. Variations in these indices of foraging efficiency were then compared between three different oceanographic habitats, delineated by the main frontal structures of the Southern Ocean. Results show that changes in body density are related not only to the number of previous prey catch attempts and to the body activity (at a 6 day lag), but also foraging habitat type. For example, despite a lower daily prey catch attempt rate, SESs foraging north of the sub-Antarctic front improve their body density at a higher rate than individuals foraging south of the sub-Antarctic and polar fronts, suggesting that they may forage on easier to catch and/or more energetically rich prey in this area. Our study highlights a need to understand the influence of habitat type on top predator foraging behaviour and efficiency when attempting a better comprehension of marine ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2559516379,"Although the vast majority of patients with a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) suffer from cytopenias, the bone marrow is usually normocellular or hypercellular. Apoptosis of hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow has been implicated in this phenomenon. However, in MDS it remains only partially elucidated which genes are involved in this process and which hematopoietic cells are mainly affected. We employed sensitive real-time PCR technology to study 93 apoptosis-related genes and gene families in sorted immature CD34+ and the differentiating erythroid (CD71+) and monomyeloid (CD13/33+) bone marrow cells. Unsupervised cluster analysis of the expression signature readily distinguished the different cellular bone marrow fractions (CD34+, CD71+ and CD13/33+) from each other, but did not discriminate patients from healthy controls. When individual genes were regarded, several were found to be differentially expressed between patients and controls. Particularly, strong over-expression of BIK (BCL2-interacting killer) was observed in erythroid progenitor cells of low- and high-risk MDS patients (both p = 0.001) and TNFRSF4 (tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 4) was down-regulated in immature hematopoietic cells (p = 0.0023) of low-risk MDS patients compared to healthy bone marrow."
https://openalex.org/W2559333747,"Therapeutic advances have markedly prolonged overall survival in multiple myeloma (MM) but the disease currently remains incurable. In a panel of MM cell lines (MM.1S, OPM-2, H929, and U266), using CD138 immunophenotyping, side population staining, and stem cell-related gene expression, we demonstrate the presence of stem-like tumor cells. Hypoxic culture conditions further increased CD138low stem-like cells with upregulated expression of OCT4 and NANOG. Compared to MM cells, these stem-like cells maintained lower steady-state pro-oxidant levels with increased uptake of the fluorescent deoxyglucose analog. In primary human MM samples, increased glycolytic gene expression correlated with poorer overall and event-free survival outcomes. Notably, stem-like cells showed increased mitochondrial mass, rhodamine 123 accumulation, and orthodox mitochondrial configuration while more condensed mitochondria were noted in the CD138high cells. Glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) induced ER stress as detected by qPCR (BiP, ATF4) and immunoblotting (BiP, CHOP) and increased dihydroethidium probe oxidation both CD138low and CD138high cells. Treatment with a mitochondrial-targeting agent decyl-triphenylphosphonium (10-TPP) increased intracellular steady-state pro-oxidant levels in stem-like and mature MM cells. Furthermore, 10-TPP mediated increases in mitochondrial oxidant production were suppressed by ectopic expression of manganese superoxide dismutase. Relative to 2-DG or 10-TPP alone, 2-DG plus 10-TPP combination showed increased caspase 3 activation in MM cells with minimal toxicity to the normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. Notably, treatment with polyethylene glycol conjugated catalase significantly reduced 2-DG and/or 10-TPP-induced apoptosis of MM cells. Also, the combination of 2-DG with 10-TPP decreased clonogenic survival of MM cells. Taken together, this study provides a novel strategy of metabolic oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity of MM cells via 2-DG and 10-TPP combination therapy."

Streptomyces venezuelae is a soil-dwelling bacterium with a developmental life cycle that initiates with the germination of spores (1Bush M.J. Tschowri N. Schlimpert S. Flärdh K. Buttner M.J. Cyclic-di-GMP signalling and the regulation of developmental transitions in streptomycetes.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2015; 13: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Vegetative hyphae then form to generate a substrate mycelium. Finally, aerial hyphae form that differentiate into the next generation of spores. The spores contain trehalose as a carbon and energy source for germination (2Hey-Ferguson A. Mitchell M. Elbein A.D. Trehalose metabolism in germinating spores of Streptomyces hygroscopicus.J. Bacteriol. 1973; 116: 1084-1085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

This contrasts with OtsA enzymes from other bacteria, insects, yeasts, and fungi that most commonly utilize UDP-glucose as the donor substrate (EC 2.4.1.15, UDP-glucose:d-glucose-6-phosphate 1-α-d-glucosyltransferase). For example, the enzyme from Escherichia coli is UDP-glucose-specific, with crystal structures providing a clear understanding of the structural basis for its donor preference (20Gibson R.P. Turkenburg J.P. Charnock S.J. Lloyd R. Davies G.J. Insights into trehalose synthesis provided by the structure of the retaining glucosyltransferase OtsA.Chem.

In all cases, trehalose 6-phosphate is dephosphorylated by OtsB (EC 3.1.3.12, trehalose-6-phosphate phosphohydrolase) to give trehalose. Because OtsA enzymes in streptomycetes use GDP-glucose as the donor, it would be expected that these organisms possess a GDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.34, GTP:α-d-glucose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase) capable of forming GDP-glucose from GTP and glucose 1-phosphate. Such enzyme activity has been reported in mammalian cells, plant tissues, and streptomycetes (22Kawaguchi K. Tanida S. Matsuda K. Tani Y. Ogata K. Microbial synthesis of GDP-glucose.Agric. Biol.

We therefore determined the donor preference of OtsA from S. venezuelae both in vitro and in vivo, identified its structural basis, and characterized three candidate enzymes for the production of the preferred donor. The enzyme OtsA from S. hygroscopicus and other streptomycetes has been reported to have a preference for the donor GDP-glucose (15Elbein A.D. Carbohydrate metabolism in Streptomyces hygroscopicus. 1. Enzymatic synthesis of trehalose phosphate from guanosine diphosphate d-glucose-14C.J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1968; 96: 1623-1631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To establish whether the enzyme from S. venezuelae shares this donor preference, the recombinant enzyme was produced in E. coli. The theoretical size of the protein with its tag is 51 kDa, but the recombinant protein had an estimated molecular mass of 109 kDa according to size exclusion chromatography, consistent with it forming a homodimer in solution. By monitoring the generation of nucleotide sugar diphosphate in a coupled assay, it was clear that the affinity of the enzyme for glucose 6-phosphate was independent of the GDP-glucose or ADP-glucose donor substrate used (Table 1). However, the associated value of kcat was nearly 5-fold greater with GDP-glucose. Furthermore, the kcat and Km for GDP-glucose were more favorable than with ADP-glucose, giving a catalytic efficiency an order of magnitude greater (Table 1). No activity with UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, or GDP-mannose was detected. In addition, none of these three compounds inhibited enzyme activity when used at the same concentration as either GDP-glucose or ADP-glucose, implying that they do not bind to the enzyme active site. The preference for the donor substrates was confirmed using 1H NMR spectroscopy to monitor the reactions. Potential allosteric regulators of OtsA were tested (fructose 6-phosphate, glucose 1-phosphate, mannose 1-phosphate, GTP, ATP, pyrophosphate, and orthophosphate), but none showed any effect on enzyme activity with GDP-glucose. This contrasts with the activation of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis enzyme by fructose 6-phosphate (27Asención Diez M.D. Demonte A.M. Syson K. Arias D.G. Gorelik A. Guerrero S.A. Bornemann S.

Consistent with the size observed in solution, the biological unit appeared to be a dimer (Fig. 2). The two copies of the dimer within the asymmetric unit are essentially identical and had subunit interfaces of 1319 Å2 (30Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6804) Google Scholar). The subunit interface in VldE (PDB code 4F9F) is topologically equivalent but more extensive at 2080 Å2. Interestingly, E. coli OtsA is also known to form a dimer in solution, but it is topologically different (PDB code 1UQT), giving a subunit interface of 1038 Å2 (21Gibson R.P. Tarling C.A. Roberts S.

Despite differences in quaternary structures, superposition of the A chain of S. venezuelae OtsA with S. hygroscopicus VldE (PDB code 4F9F over 368 residues) and E. coli OtsA (PDB code 1UQT over 393 residues) showed that they each had a common fold with a root mean square deviation value of 2.00 Å. The fold comprised twin Rossman-like β/α/β domains in a GT-B configuration. A molecule of MES buffer is bound in a cleft between the two domains of S. venezuelae OtsA in what is likely to be the active site, by analogy with the E. coli enzyme (20Gibson R.P. Turkenburg J.P.

Attempts to obtain a structure of the S. venezuelae enzyme with either GDP or GDP-glucose bound were unsuccessful. Therefore, comparisons were made between the non-liganded structure and those of the closest structural homologues with nucleotides bound; E. coli OtsA with UDP-glucose bound (PDB code 1UQU) (21Gibson R.P.

Asamizu S. Neau D. Almabruk K.H. Mahmud T. Lee Y.-H. Mechanistic insights into validoxylamine A 7′-phosphate synthesis by VldE using the structure of the entire product complex.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e44934Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). First, the active sites were superposed on the basis of the α-carbons of Arg-263, Leu-365, and Glu-369 (S. venezuelae numbering), which were conserved in all three proteins. Then, the observed and potential hydrogen-bonding interactions between the ligands and proteins were assessed (Fig. 3). It was immediately apparent that amino acid side chains associated with binding the ribose diphosphate were almost completely conserved. The only exceptions were an additional Arg-341 side chain interaction to the ribose in E. coli OtsA and an additional Ser-388 side chain interaction with phosphate in VldE. With the exception of a hydrogen bond between a protein backbone NH and an oxygen of the base, the interactions with the base were quite different (Fig. 3). In the case of E. coli OtsA, there was an additional backbone CO interaction (from Phe-399) with an NH of the uridine base. By contrast, VldE formed hydrogen bonds between the side chains of Asn-361 and Thr-366 and the guanidine base together with a hydrophobic interaction involving a Val-363 side chain. All three of these interactions appear to be possible in S. venezuelae OtsA with its Asp-339, Ser-344, and Phe-341 side chains in equivalent positions to Asn-361, Thr-366, and Val-363 in VldE. Thus, the preference of S. venezuelae OtsA for GDP-glucose is evident from its structural similarity to VldE. Given the ability of S. venezuelae OtsA to utilize ADP-glucose to some extent as well as GDP-glucose, it was uncertain what the physiological donor would be, so we took a reverse genetic approach to address this. We had already established that blocking the GlgE pathway with a treS null mutation did not affect growth of S. venezuelae on complex or minimal media supplemented with maltose (8Miah F. Bibb M.J. Barclay J.E. Findlay K.C. Bornemann S. Developmental delay in a Streptomyces venezuelae glgE null mutant is associated with the accumulation of α-maltose 1-phosphate.Microbiology. 2016; 162: 1208-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This was because the product of TreS, maltose, bypassed the blockage (Fig. 1). Similarly, when the otsA gene was replaced by an apramycin resistance (apr) cassette, the resulting otsA null mutant was also able to grow on media supplemented with maltose, just like the wild-type strain. Metabolite analysis using NMR spectroscopy showed that trehalose levels were similar to the wild type (8Miah F. Bibb M.J. Barclay J.E. Findlay K.C. Bornemann S. Developmental delay in a Streptomyces venezuelae glgE null mutant is associated with the accumulation of α-maltose 1-phosphate.Microbiology. 2016; 162: 1208-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) throughout growth on maltose. Although the maltose level reached 4% dry cell weight during growth, a little higher than the 2.5% observed in wild-type cells (8Miah F. Bibb M.J. Barclay J.E. Findlay K.C. Bornemann S. Developmental delay in a Streptomyces venezuelae glgE null mutant is associated with the accumulation of α-maltose 1-phosphate.Microbiology. 2016; 162: 1208-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), it fell to zero during sporulation as normal. α-Glucan accumulated in pre-spore cells as normal, and spore morphology was like that of the wild-type strain, according to electron microscopy. No other changes in metabolite levels were apparent. Therefore, there the mutant strain did not show any significant phenotype on media supplemented with maltose. We then tested whether a phenotype could be observed when the mutant was grown on a minimal medium supplemented with a carbon source other than glucose, maltose, or any other intermediate of the GlgE pathway. Although no growth phenotype of the mutant was observed when using fructose, there was a developmental delay with galactose (Fig. 4), such that sporulation did not appear to occur. Interestingly, the growth phenotype of the mutant was dependent on cell density, allowing isolated colonies to grow more like the wild-type strain. To be able to isolate larger quantities of cells, the mutant was grown on a complex medium that contained both galactose and malt extract, the latter providing some maltose. A delayed growth phenotype was still observed, but sporulation did eventually occur (Fig. 4). With this growth medium, the mutant strain was able to generate some trehalose, most probably via TreY/TreZ or possibly via TreS (Fig. 1). However, the spores of the mutant strain contained less trehalose (5.4 ± 0.1% dry cell weight ± S.E., n = 3) than the wild-type strain (17.9 ± 0.4% dry cell weight ± S.E., n = 3). This suggested that the limited amount of maltose present in the medium was not sufficient to fully compensate for the lack of OtsA. Despite the lower level of trehalose, spore morphology was not affected, according to electron microscopy. Taken together, the mutant showed a delayed growth phenotype that was both galactose- and cell density-dependent. 1H NMR spectroscopy of cell-free extracts of the otsA mutant strain grown in the presence of galactose revealed the presence of a number of metabolites (Fig. 5A) that were also observed with the wild-type strain during growth (8Miah F. Bibb M.J. Barclay J.E. Findlay K.C. Bornemann S. Developmental delay in a Streptomyces venezuelae glgE null mutant is associated with the accumulation of α-maltose 1-phosphate.Microbiology. 2016; 162: 1208-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These included trehalose and maltose (and possibly glucose, given the overlap between the maltose and glucose resonances). There were, however, a number of other species that do not accumulate in the wild-type. For example, there were two sets of double doublets at 5.46 and 5.50 ppm (Fig. 5, A and B) that would be expected to arise from phosphosugars. Galactose is likely to be assimilated by S. venezuelae using a Leloir-type pathway in which galactose 1-phosphate is converted to glucose 1-phosphate via epimerization of an NDP-galactose (31Frey P.A. The Leloir pathway: a mechanistic imperative for three enzymes to change the stereochemical configuration of a single carbon in galactose.FASEB J. 1996; 10: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Indeed, adding the cell-free extract to authentic galactose 1-phosphate and glucose 1-phosphate enhanced these specific resonances, consistent with these two metabolites accumulating in the mutant. In addition, another double doublet at 5.60 ppm (Fig. 5, A and C), together with additional resonances at low field, was suggestive of the presence of a nucleotide sugar diphosphate. Indeed, the resonances associated with authentic GDP-glu"

These comorbidities indicate impaired blood flow; however, other than limited reports of increased plasma viscosity, surprisingly little is known regarding the physical properties of blood in PCOS. We aimed to investigate whether haemorheology was impaired in women with PCOS. We thus measured a comprehensive haemorheological profile, in a case-control design, of lean women with PCOS and age-matched healthy controls. A clinical examination determined similar cardiovascular risk for the two groups. Whole blood and plasma viscosity was measured using a cone-plate viscometer. The magnitude and rate of red blood cell (RBC) aggregation was determined using a light-transmission aggregometer, and the degree of RBC deformability was measured via laser-diffraction ektacytometry. Plasma viscosity was significantly increased in women with PCOS. Blood viscosity was also increased for PCOS at lower-to-moderate shear rates in both native and standardised haematocrit samples. The magnitude of RBC aggregation–a primary determinant of low-shear blood viscosity–was significantly increased in PCOS at native and 0.4 L·L-1 haematocrit. No difference was detected between PCOS and CON groups for RBC deformability measurements. A novel measure indicating the effectiveness of oxygen transport by RBC (i.e., the haematocrit-to-viscosity ratio; HVR) was decreased at all shear rates in women with PCOS. In a group of young and lean women with PCOS with an unremarkable cardiovascular risk profile based on clinical data, significant haemorheological impairment was observed. The degree of haemorheological derangement observed in the present study reflects that of overt chronic disease, and provides an avenue for future therapeutic intervention in PCOS."

With a goal to delineate the DNA damage signal transduction cascade, we systematically analyzed the human E2 ubiquitin- and ubiquitin-like-conjugating enzymes for their ability to mobilize the DNA damage marker 53BP1 onto ionizing radiation-induced DNA double strand breaks. An RNAi-based screen identified UBE2U as a candidate regulator of chromatin responses at double strand breaks. Further mining of the UBE2U interactome uncovered its cognate E3 RNF17 as a novel factor that, via the radiosensitivity, immunodeficiency, dysmorphic features, and learning difficulties (RIDDLE) syndrome protein RNF168, enforces DNA damage responses. Our screen allowed us to uncover new players in the mammalian DNA damage response and highlights the instrumental roles of ubiquitin machineries in promoting cell responses to genotoxic stress."

N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BBN) induces superficial bladder cancers with papillary morphology in rats and invasive bladder cancers with infiltrating phenotype in mice. In this study, we analyzed genomic landscapes of rodent BBN-induced bladder cancers using array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH). While no significant copy number alterations were detected in superficial bladder tumors in rats, copy number gains in chromosomal regions 2D-E1, 7qA3, 9F2, and 11C-D were detected in invasive bladder tumors in mice. Amplification of representative genes located on 2D-E1 and 7qA3 chromosomal regions was confirmed by quantitative PCR. Cyp2a22 and Cyp2a5 genes but not Cyp2g1, Cyp2a12, and Rab4b genes on mouse chromosome 7qA3 were amplified in invasive bladder cancers. Although the human ortholog gene of Cyp2a22 has not been confirmed, the mouse Cyp2a5 gene is the ortholog of the human CYP2A6 gene located in chromosomal region 19q13.2, and CYP2A6 was identified by database search as one of the closest human homolog to mouse Cyp2a22. Considering a possibility that this region may be related to mouse 7qA3, we analyzed CYP2A6 copy number and expression in human bladder cancer using cell lines and resected tumor specimens. Although only one of eight cell lines showed more than one copy increase of the CYP2A6 gene, CYP2A6 amplification was detected in six out of 18 primary bladder tumors where it was associated with the invasive phenotype. Immunohistochemical analyses of 118 primary bladder tumors revealed that CYP2A6 protein expression was also higher in invasive tumors, especially in those of the scattered type. Together, these findings indicate that the amplification and overexpression of the CYP2A6 gene are characteristic of human bladder cancers with increased malignancy and that CYP2A6 can be a candidate prognostic biomarker in this type of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2559446811,"Neonicotinoid insecticides are widely used to protect plants against pest insects, and insecticide residues remaining in the environment affect both target and non-target organisms. Whereas low doses of neonicotinoids have been shown to disturb the behaviour of pollinating insects, recent studies have revealed that a low dose of the neonicotinoid clothianidin can improve behavioural and neuronal sex pheromone responses in a pest insect, the male moth Agrotis ipsilon, and thus potentially improve reproduction. As male moth behaviour depends also on its physiological state and previous experience with sensory signals, we wondered if insecticide effects would be dependent on plasticity of olfactory-guided behaviour. We investigated, using wind tunnel experiments, whether a brief pre-exposure to the sex pheromone could enhance the behavioural response to this important signal in the moth A. ipsilon at different ages (sexually immature and mature males) and after different delays (2 h and 24 h), and if the insecticide clothianidin would interfere with age effects or the potential pre-exposure-effects. Brief pre-exposure to the pheromone induced an age-independent significant increase of sex pheromone responses 24 h later, whereas sex pheromone responses did not increase significantly 2 h after exposure. However, response delays were significantly shorter compared to naïve males already two hours after exposure. Oral treatment with clothianidin increased sex pheromone responses in sexually mature males, confirming previous results, but did not influence responses in young immature males. Males treated with clothianidin after pre-exposure at day 4 responded significantly more to the sex pheromone at day 5 than males treated with clothianidin only and than males pre-exposed only, revealing an additive effect of experience and the insecticide. Plasticity of sensory systems has thus to be taken into account when investigating the effects of sublethal doses of insecticides on behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2558884772,"RlmN, a bacterial radical SAM methylating enzyme, has the unusual ability to modify two distinct types of RNA: 23S rRNA and tRNA. In rRNA, RlmN installs a methyl group at the C2 position of A2503 of 23S rRNA, while in tRNA the modification occurs at nucleotide A37, immediately adjacent to the anticodon triplet. Intriguingly, only a subset of tRNAs that contain an adenosine at position 37 are substrates for RlmN, suggesting that the enzyme carefully probes the highly conserved tRNA fold and sequence features to identify its targets. Over the past several years, multiple studies have addressed rRNA modification by RlmN, while relatively few investigations have focused on the ability of this enzyme to modify tRNAs. In this study, we utilized in vitro transcribed tRNAs as model substrates to interrogate RNA recognition by RlmN. Using chimeras and point mutations, we probed how the structure and sequence of RNA influences methylation, identifying position 38 of tRNAs as a critical determinant of substrate recognition. We further demonstrate that, analogous to previous mechanistic studies with fragments of 23S rRNA, tRNA methylation requirements are consistent with radical SAM reactivity. Together, our findings provide detailed insight into tRNA recognition by a radical SAM methylating enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2558125964,"Placenta previa, one of the most severe obstetric complications, carries an increased risk of intraoperative massive hemorrhage. Several risk factors for intraoperative hemorrhage have been identified to date. However, the correlation between birth weight and intraoperative hemorrhage has not been investigated. Here we estimate the correlation between birth weight and the occurrence of intraoperative massive hemorrhage in placenta previa.We included all 256 singleton pregnancies delivered via cesarean section at our hospital because of placenta previa between 2003 and 2015. We calculated not only measured birth weights but also standard deviation values according to the Japanese standard growth curve to adjust for differences in gestational age. We assessed the correlation between birth weight and the occurrence of intraoperative massive hemorrhage (>1500 mL blood loss). Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to determine the cutoff value of intraoperative massive hemorrhage.Of 256 pregnant women with placenta previa, 96 (38%) developed intraoperative massive hemorrhage. Receiver-operating characteristic curves revealed that the area under the curve of the combination variables between the standard deviation of birth weight and intraoperative massive hemorrhage was 0.71. The cutoff value with a sensitivity of 81.3% and specificity of 55.6% was -0.33 standard deviation. The multivariate analysis revealed that a standard deviation of >-0.33 (odds ratio, 5.88; 95% confidence interval, 3.04-12.00), need for hemostatic procedures (odds ratio, 3.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.79-6.25), and placental adhesion (odds ratio, 12.68; 95% confidence interval, 2.85-92.13) were independent risk of intraoperative massive hemorrhage.In patients with placenta previa, a birth weight >-0.33 standard deviation was a significant risk indicator of massive hemorrhage during cesarean section. Based on this result, further studies are required to investigate whether fetal weight estimated by ultrasonography can predict hemorrhage during cesarean section in patients with placental previa."
