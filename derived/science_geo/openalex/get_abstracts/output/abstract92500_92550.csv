https://openalex.org/W1661233179,"Smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase was purified from turkey gizzards. The enzyme was extracted from washed myofibrils and the final step of purification was affinity chromatography using calmodulin coupled to Sepharose 4B. The purified enzyme was characterized with respect to its physical, chemical, and kinetic properties. It has a molecular weight of 130,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 124,000 by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation under nondenaturing conditions. It is an asymmetric molecule with a Stokes radius of 75 A, a sedimentation coefficient of 4.45 S, and a frictional coefficient of 1.85. Smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase is dependent on the calcium-binding protein calmodulin for activity. It has an apparent K0.5 for calmodulin of 10(-9) M and binds 1 mol of calmodulin/mol of myosin kinase in the presence of calcium. The binding of calmodulin increases the sedimentation coefficient from 4.45 S to 5.05 S, and the Stokes radius from 75 A to 79 A, and does not alter the frictional coefficient. The enzyme has a Km for ATP and the 20,000-dalton light chain of smooth muscle myosin of 50 microM and 5 microM, respectively. It phosphorylates the 20,000-dalton light chain of smooth muscle myosin more rapidly than the equivalent light chain from cardiac and skeletal muscles. It does not phosphorylate histones, alpha-casein, phosphorylase kinase, or phosphorylase b at a significant rate."
https://openalex.org/W2034878415,"Xanthine oxidase, an iron-sulfur molybdenum flavoprotein known to generate superoxide radical, was demonstrated in several bovine tissues. The enzyme (155 kd polypeptide) was purified from bovine milk lipid globules and antibodies were raised that allowed precipitation of the enzyme without inactivation of enzymatic activity. By immunolocalization techniques at light and electron microscope levels, the antigen was found in milk-secreting epithelial cells but not in epithelial cells of several other tissues. In a number of tissues, including mammary gland, liver, heart, lung and intestine, antibodies to xanthine oxidase stained only endothelial cells of capillaries, including sinusoids, but not endothelia of larger blood vessels and endocard. In both milk-secreting epithelial and capillary endothelial cells, xanthine oxidase was distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Results from biochemical and immunological studies suggest that xanthine oxidase is similar in the various tissues examined and may serve similar redox functions."
https://openalex.org/W1560970554,"We have isolated a previously unrecognized heparin-dependent inhibitor of thrombin from human plasma. The inhibitor, designated heparin cofactor II (HCII), was purified to homogeneity with sulfated-dextran, DEAE-Sepharose, heparin-Sepharose and Sephadex G-150. HCII is a glycoprotein consisting of a single polypeptide chain with a Mr = 65,600 as determined by sedimentation equilibrium analysis. Other physical properties include s20,w = 4.31 S; Stokes radius = 34 A; E280 1% = 11.7; and pI = 4.95 to 5.15. The purified inhibitor is not precipitated by antibodies directed against seven other plasma protease inhibitors, including antithrombin III (ATIII). HCII blocks the proteolytic and amidolytic activities of thrombin by forming a covalent, 1:1 molar complex with the protease. The second-order rate constant for inhibition of thrombin by purified HCII increases from 5.0 X 10(5) M-1 min-1 in the absence of heparin to 4.5 x 10(8) M-1 min-1 at optimal heparin concentrations of 0.8 to 1.0 unit/ml. In comparison with ATIII, HCII is a relatively ineffective inhibitor of coagulation factor Xa."
https://openalex.org/W2012260853,"We have isolated about 30 to 40 different BALB/c mouse sperm DNA genomic clones that hybridize to cDNA clones encoding proteins homologous to transplantation antigens. One of these clones (27.1) was selected for sequence because it was polymorphic in Southern blot analysis of the DNAs from BALB/c and CBA mice. A fragment of 5.7 kilobases of this clone was completely sequenced and found to contain a pseudogene whose sequence is highly homologous to the sequences of known transplantation antigens. Pseudogene 27.1 is split into eight exons that correlate with the structurally defined protein domains of transplantation antigens. Using Southern blot hybridization on the DNAs of different inbred mouse strains, we mapped the pseudogene to the Qa-2,3 region, a part of the Tla complex on chromosome 17 that is adjacent to the major histocompatibility complex. The Qa2,3 region encodes lymphoid differentiation antigens homologous to the transplantation antigens in size, in peptide map profiles and in their association with beta2-microglobulin. These mapping studies suggest that gene 27.1 may be a pseudogene for eigher a Qa antigen or an as yet undefined transplantation antigen. Accordingly, we may have isolate genes encoding lymphoid differentiation antigens of the Tla complex as well as those encoding transplantation antigens among the 30 to 40 different genomic clones isolated from our sperm library."

https://openalex.org/W2049670319,"We have analyzed the molecular basis of beta + thalassemia by studying the expression of a cloned beta-globin gene in HeLa cells. This beta-globin gene was isolated from a beta + thalassemic patient and differs from the normal beta-globin genes by only a single point mutation within the first intron. The beta + thalassemic and the normal beta-globin genes were cloned into an SV40-pBR328 vector and introduced into HeLa cells by calcium phosphate coprecipitation. We assayed the RNA from these transfected HeLa cells by S1 nuclease mapping and cDNA sequencing to detect the nature of the defect in beta-globin gene expression. While the transcripts of the normal beta-globin gene are processed correctly, the first intron of the beta + thalassemic beta-globin gene is incorrectly spliced in about 90% of the mRNA because of an additional 3; splice site that has been created by the point mutation. This incorrectly spliced mRNA is effectively exported to the cytoplasm, where it would conceivably be translated to give a truncated globin chain of 35 amino acids. The remaining 10% of the mRNA transcribed from the beta+ thalassemic globin gene is correctly spliced and can therefore be translated to give normal beta-globin. In addition to the incorrect splicing of the first intron, the splicing of both introns is retarded, which results in the accumulation of unspliced pre-mRNA. This suggests that removal of the first intron might facilitate splicing of the second intron."
https://openalex.org/W1570142843,"Fimbrin, previously recognized as a major structural protein of the microfilament core bundles of intestinal epithelial cell microvilli, has been purified to homogeneity and characterized. It is a nearly globular monomeric protein of apparent molecular weight 68,000 and has a single calcium binding site (Kd = 9 microM), for which magnesium ions compete. Fimbrin binds to F-actin and this interaction is characterized in detail. Under our optimal binding of conditions, fimbrin induces tightly packed F-actin bundles, similar to the bundles induced by villin, another microvillus structural protein. The formation of mixed fimbrin-villin-actin bundles provides a further step toward the full in vitro reconstitution of microvillus core filaments from its purified individual components. The reconstituted fimbrin-villin-actin bundles do not display the side arms characteristic of isolated microvillus cores. These results are discussed in terms of our current understanding of the organization of the microvillus core filaments and indicate that this structure contains two bundling proteins, villin and fimbrin. The results complement previous studies and now provide a minimal biochemical characterization of all four major actin-associated structural proteins so far identified in core filaments. Three of these (villin, fimbrin, and calmodulin) are calcium-binding proteins, emphasizing the concept of calcium control over submembranous microfilament organization."

https://openalex.org/W1605021123,"The cytotoxic test system for Shigella shigae toxin was improved and used to study the stability of the toxin to various pH values, temperature, and chemicals. Inhibition of protein synthesis is the first demonstrable effect in cells treated with Shigella toxin. This inhibition appears to be at the level of peptide chain elongation. An inhibition effect on cell-free protein synthesis is exhibited by toxin pretreated first with trypsin and then with dithiothreitol and 8 M urea or 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Ribosomes treated with toxin or its A1 fragment had lost most of their ability to polymerize [14C]phenylalanine in a poly(U)-dependent cell-free system. Salt-washed ribosomes in simple buffered solutions were inactivated at a rate of at least 40 ribosomes/(min) (A1 fragment). Addition of antitoxin immediately stopped further inactivation, but it did not reactivate the inactivated ribosomes. 60 S ribosomal subunits from toxin-treated ribosomes had a marked reduction in ability to support polyphenylanine synthesis, whereas 40 S subunits from toxin-treated ribosomes retained their activity. Toxin-treated ribosomes retained their ability to incorporate [3H]puromycin into growing peptide chains, indicating that the peptide bond formation is not the function inhibited."

https://openalex.org/W1507625951,"The oxidative half-reaction of xanthine oxidase is reexamined with regard to the generation of the superoxide anion. By using cytochrome c reduction to monitor superoxide, it is found that the stoichiometry of superoxide produced to enzyme reoxidized is 2:1, significantly greater than previously reported (Olson, J. S., Ballou, D. P., Palmer, G., and Massey, V. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 4350-4362). Furthermore, the kinetics of superoxide-dependent cytochrome c reduction exhibits a pronounced lag during the rapid phase of enzyme reoxidation and a limiting rate identical with that of the slow phase of enzyme reoxidation. This indicates that superoxide is generated only in the last steps of the sequential removal of reducing equivalents from the enzyme by molecular oxygen. Experiments with the two-electron-reduced enzyme indicate that it too produces two superoxide ions for each molecule of enzyme reoxidized, demonstrating that it is the last two electrons to leave the enzyme in the course of reoxidation that form superoxide. The sequential scheme for the oxidative half-reaction must therefore be 6 leads to 4 leads to 2 leads to 1 leads to 0, where the numbers reflect the number of reducing equivalents in each intermediate. Using this scheme, both enzyme reoxidation and cytochrome c reduction can be accurately simulated. Reasons for the different behavior of the two-electron-reduced xanthine oxidase compared to the six- and four-electron-reduced enzyme are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2164739217,"H5ts125, a temperature-sensitive mutant of adenovirus type 5, is restricted to the early phase of infection when grown at the nonpermissive temperature. One phenotype of the virus is the overproduction of early viral mRNA at the nonpermissive temperature relative to levels found in wild-type-infected cells, although normal levels are found at the permissive temperature. We have analyzed this phenomenon for the production of RNA from two specific early viral transcription units, E1A and E1B. Transcription rates from both of these regions were found to be the same in ts125-infected cells as in wild-type-infected cells at the nonpermissive temperature. However, when the cytoplasmic stabilities of the E1A and E1B mRNAs were measured in wild-type- and ts125-infected cells, it was found that at the nonpermissive temperature, the RNAs were 3 to 5 times more stable in a ts125 infection than in a wild-type infection. Since the mutation in ts125 maps to the gene for the 72 kd DNA-binding protein, these results imply that a functional 72 kd protein is required for the rapid turnover of early viral mRNA in wild-type-infected cells, indicating that the abundance of early viral mRNA is controlled by the 72 kd DNA-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W2136453624,"Blood coagulation Factor Xa and activated protein C are both serine proteases derived from circulating, vitamin K-dependent precursors. They express, respectively, procoagulant and anticoagulant properties through Ca2+ and phospholipid-dependent interactions with coagulation Factor Va. The present studies were undertaken to determine whether Factor Xa and activated protein C interact independently or competitively with Factor Va. The interactions were assessed by examining the activated protein C-catalyzed inactivation of Factor Va in the absence and presence of Factor Xa at various concentrations. The results indicated that the two proteins compete for Factor Va and that Factor Xa protects Factor Va from inactivation by activated protein C. The ability of Factor Xa to protect Factor Va was observed either in the absence of a Factor Xa substrate or under conditions in which the complex of Factor Va and Factor Xa was engaged in the conversion of substrate (prethrombin 1) to thrombin."

https://openalex.org/W1509897118,"An enzyme from porcine kidney converted leukotriene D4 into a less polar metabolite. The structure of this compound was 5-hydroxy-6-S-cysteinyl-7,9-trans-11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid (leukotriene E4). Analogous products, viz. 5-hydroxy-6-S-cysteinyl-7,9,11-eicosatrienoic acid (leukotriene E3), 5-hydroxy-6-S-cysteinyl-7,9,11-trans-14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid (11-trans-leukotriene E4), and 5-hydroxy-6-S-cysteinyl-7,9,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic acid (leukotriene E5) were formed from leukotrienes D3, 11-trans-D4, and D5, respectively. Leukotriene E4 induced slow reacting substance-like contractions of guinea pig ileum but was less potent (8-12 times) than leukotriene C4. The biological potency of 11-trans-leukotriene E4 was similar to that of leukotriene E4."
https://openalex.org/W1564480341,"A protein(s) which catalyzes the exchange of phosphatidylcholine and cholesteryl ester between plasma lipoproteins has been purified 10,000-fold from lipoprotein-free human plasma. The apparent molecular weight of the protein of the active fraction, designated lipid transfer complex (LTC), is approximately 61,000; when electrophoresed in 6 M urea, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate on a 3-20% polyacrylamide gradient, the protein appears as a doublet of molecular weights 58,000 and 63,000. The active material is a glycoprotein which binds to concanavalin A. Human LTC is a lipid-protein complex with phospholipid, cholesterol, cholesteryl ester, and glyceride comprising 7% of the total mass. A similar glycoprotein (or glycoproteins) exists in rat plasma, although the fold-purification thus far achieved is low: about 500-fold. Moreover, the rat preparation enhances exchange of phosphatidylcholine, but does not appreciably enhance exchange of cholesteryl ester. Partially purified LTC (less than or equal to 3500-fold) exists in a complex with lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase. Active lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase is not, however, required for exchange of phosphatidylcholine or cholesteryl ester facilitated by human LTC. The rates of exchange of phosphatidylcholine and cholesteryl ester facilitated by human LTC are equal. Coupled lipid exchange occurs at all stages of LTC purification, at values of pH between 5 and 10, and at ionic strengths as great as 0.9. Moreover, phosphatidylcholine and cholesteryl ester are exchanged with 1:1 stoichiometry in the presence of thiol group reagents such as 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid). Both lipid exchange activities are relatively resistant to elevated temperatures. Coupled exchange of phospholipid and neutral lipid is not dictated by the nature of the lipoprotein donor and acceptor substrates: bovine liver phospholipid exchange protein catalyzes exchange of phosphatidylcholine but not cholesteryl ester between low and high density lipoproteins under conditions identical with those in which human LTC facilitates exchange of both lipids."

https://openalex.org/W1982368633,"Proteins tightly bound to the DNA of mouse L cells were examined both in the regions of DNA attachment to the protein skeleton and in the DNA loops. The interphase nuclear matrix and the metaphase chromosomal scaffold, containing from 2 to 15% of the original DNA, as well as the material released from the skeleton were isolated by mild nuclease treatment. At least six proteins resistant to sarcosyl-Cs2SO4 treatment are associated exclusively with skeleton-attached DNA both in interphase nuclei and metaphase chromosomes. Two (p52 and p60) can be dissociated from the complex by mercapto-ethanol-sarcosyl treatment. Both skeleton-attached and released DNA fractions contain a group of tightly bound low molecular weight polypeptides consisting of a major p18 band and one or two minor bands. They seem to be randomly distributed throughout the whole DNA loop. Some of the specific proteins that are tightly associated with DNA at the site of its interaction with the skeleton may directly be responsible for DNA attachment to the skeleton."
https://openalex.org/W1512723738,"A Ca2+-insensitive myosin light chain kinase was prepared and used in experiments with skinned gizzard fibers. In the absence of Ca2+, this kinase activated isometric force development. The force development was associated with phosphorylation of the 20,000-dalton myosin light chains and addition of Ca2+ did not activate the fibers further. Pretreatment of the fibers with Ca2+-insensitive myosin light chain kinase and adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) in the absence of Ca2+ caused thiophosphorylation of the light chains and, on the addition of ATP, an activation of isometric tension was observed. The subsequent addition of Ca2+ did not increase force development. A comparison of Ca2+-activated tension in the skinned gizzard muscle fibers with Ca2+-insensitive myosin light chain kinase-activated tension suggests that the phosphorylation of the myosin light chains is the dominant factor in the development of tension in smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1601407886,"Cell-free translation and hybridization to cloned cDNA probes were used to study variations in fibrinogen mRNA levels in the livers of rats injected with Malayan pit viper venom and glucocorticoids. Animals defibrinated with Malayan pit viper venom showed a rapid and substantial increase in the relative abundance of hepatic mRNAs for the A alpha, B beta, and gamma chains of fibrinogen. The onset, rate, and maximal extent of message accumulation were virtually identical for each of the three fibrinogen polypeptide chains. This response was detectable 1-2 h after injection of venom and, by 12-16 h, fibrinogen species made up approximately 10% of the polyadenylated RNA compared to less than 1% in noninjected animals. Physiologic levels of glucocorticoids appeared to be necessary for maximal levels of message; adrenalectomized animals had a median 4.8-fold increase in fibrinogen mRNA species after defibrination compared with a 12.5-fold increase in normal animals. Although it is uncertain whether the changes in mRNA levels are a function of increased transcription or message stabilization, the similar kinetics of accumulation suggest that a common mechanism is responsible for coordinating the levels of each fibrinogen mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W2086242423,"Rat hepatoma clones whose cells do and do not produce albumin, as well as somatic hybrid between the two types of cells, have been examined for albumin mRNA. A direct proportionality between the rate of albumin production and the concentration of albumin mRNA sequences was found for all albumin-producing hepatoma and hybrid clones, indicating that rate of synthesis of the protein is determined by the concentration of its mRNA. Albumin-negative dedifferentiated variant and somatic hybrid cells contain fewer than one to five molecules of albumin mRNA per cell; the block in expression of the gene appears to be at the same (probably transcriptional) level in variants and their somatic hybrids."
https://openalex.org/W1498591074,"A new calcium-sensitive actin filament cross-linking protein has been purified from Acanthamoeba. By gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate, the apparent subunit molecular weight varies depending on the concentration of sulfhydryl reducing agent in the sample. The major band is 60,000 in 10% beta-mercaptoethanol, 85,000 in 1% mercaptoethanol, an 90,000 without beta-mercaptoethanol. By electron microscopy, the molecule is a rod about 3 nm wide and 55 nm long with a 5.5-nm globular region at one end, which accounts for its large Stokes radius of 8.5 nm. At low concentrations, the gelation protein cross-links actin filaments to form a solid gel. This gelation reaction is inhibited by micromolar concentrations of Ca2+, by cytochalasin B, and by capping protein and is promoted by ATP, MgCl2, and KCl."
https://openalex.org/W1512037014,"We present here a new method for inhibiting protein acetylation in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free protein-synthesizing system. This procedure utilizes S-acetonyl coenzyme A, a nonreactive acetyl-CoA analogue, as an inhibitor of the NH2-terminal protein acetyltransferase in this lysate. With this procedure, we can make, in vitro, Dictyostelium discoideum actin which is 85% nonacetylated but fully translated. With the fully translated but nonacetylated actin as a substrate, the actin can be almost completely acetylated post-translationally in an acetyl-CoA-dependent system after the actin has left the ribosome. Using formylated and nonformylated [35S]Met-tRNAfMet as a source of label and in conjunction with detailed peptide mapping experiments with trypsin and thermolysin, the in vitro acetylation is shown to occur at the NH2 terminus of the newly synthesized actin. Furthermore, the initiator methionine residue, contrary to expectation, is not cleaved off but remains stable for at lest 50 min. thus, in the acetylating reticulocyte lysate system, the primary complete translation product in actin synthesis is Ac-Met-Asp and not Ac-Asp."
https://openalex.org/W1515770408,"Covalently cross-linked actin dimer was isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle F-actin reacted with phenylenebismaleimide (Knight, P., and Offer, G. (1978) Biochem. J. 175, 1023-1032). The UV spectrum of the purified cross-linked actin dimer, in a nonpolymerizing buffer, was very similar to that of native F-actin and not to the spectrum of G-actin. Cross-linked actin dimer polymerized to filaments that were indistinguishable in the electron microscope from F-actin made from native G-actin and that were similar to native F-actin in their ability to activate the Mg2+-ATPase of myosin subfragment-1. The critical concentrations of polymerization of cross-linked actin dimer in 0.5 mM and 2.0 mM MgCl2, 2 to 4 microM, and 1 to 2 microM, respectively, were similar to the values for native G-actin. Cross-linked actin dimer contained 2 mol of bound nucleotide/mol of dimer. One bound nucleotide exchanged with ATP in solution with a t 1/2 of 55 min and with ADP with a t 1/2 of 5 h. The second bound nucleotide exchanged much more slowly. The more rapidly exchangeable site contained 10 to 15% bound ADP.Pi and 85 to 90% bound ATP while the second site contained much less, if any, bound ADP.Pi. Cross-linked actin dimer had an ATPase activity in 0.5 mM MgCl2 that was 7 times greater than the ATPase activity of native G-actin and that was also stimulated by cytochalasin D. These data are discussed in relation to the possible role of ATP in actin polymerization and function with the speculation that the cross-linked actin dimer may serve simultaneously as a useful model for each of the two different ends of native F-actin."

https://openalex.org/W1505607682,"The induction of heme oxygenase (EC 1.14.99.3) in response to various metal treatments was investigated in monolayer cultures of chick embryo liver cells maintained in a chemically defined serum-free medium. The most potent heme oxygenase-inducing action was exhibited by CO2+, Cd2+, Sb3+, As3+, and Au1+ followed by lesser induction observed with Cu2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+. Mn2+, Ni2+, Se4+, Sn2+, and Zn2+ were without effect. In contrast to the marked inducing effect of Co2+ on heme oxygenase, Co-protoporphyrin IX decreased the enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner. Addition of Zn2+ (20 microM) to Co2+-treated liver cell cultures revealed a striking ability of Zn2+ to block completely Co2+-induced heme oxygenase. Simultaneous addition of Mn2+ (50 microM) to Co2+-treated cells also blocked Co2+-induced heme oxygenase (approximately 50%). These findings in tissue culture confirm those made earlier in whole animals (Drummond, G. S., and Kappas, A. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 76, 5331-5335) and indicate that these effects of Zn2+ and Mn2+ are exerted directly in liver cells. Addition of cysteine (400 microM) to the cultures also inhibited heme oxygenase induction by Co2+ substantially. Cycloheximide and actinomycin D blocked the induction of heme oxygenase, indicating that increased heme oxygenase activity by metal treatment is dependent on fresh RNA and protein synthesis. The half-life of the enzyme was calculated to be approximately 15 h after treatment with cycloheximide. These findings provide further evidence that metal ions can regulate heme oxygenase synthesis directly in isolated liver cells and that the metal-metal interactions which lead to blockade of the enzyme induction do not involve extrahepatic tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1517285568,"The interaction of calmodulin with myosin light chain kinase produces an approximately 30% increase in myosin light chain kinase tryptophan fluorescence. This represents the first report of calmodulin-induced structural changes in a protein which it activates. We fund that the calmodulin-myosin light chain kinase interaction is: 1) dependent on [Ca2+] (half-maximal binding at pCa 6.2) and essentially independent of [Mg2+], 2) occurs before saturation of all four reported Ca2+-specific sites on calmodulin. 3) saturates with 1 mol of calmodulin bound per mol of kinase with an apparent affinity of approximately 2.0 X 10(7) M-1, 4) is specific for calmodulin over troponin-C, 5) is directly related to the activation of myosin light chain kinase for phosphorylation of myosin light chain. Fluorescence stopped flow studies of these calmodulin-induced fluorescence changes in myosin light chain kinase indicate that Ca2+ binding to calmodulin occurs very rapidly and is not rate-limiting while the calmodulin-induced fluorescence increase in myosin light chain kinase occurs as a biphasic process with rates of approximately 65 s-1 and 6 s-1. The fluorescence increase produced by calmodulin binding to myosin light chain kinase is completely reversed by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid at a rate of approximately 2 s-1."
https://openalex.org/W1540191428,"A segment of chick elastin cDNA cloned in the plasmid pBR322 was sequenced by the method of Maxam and Gilbert ((1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 74, 560-564) and the 192-base pair insert was found to be derived from the nontranslated region of the 3' end of the mRNA. The nick-translated cDNA was used to identify and to estimate the relative amounts of elastin mRNA in the developing chick embryo aorta by blot hybridization. A single species of 3.5 kilobases hybridized to the cDNA probe and this species increased greatly between day 7 and day 14 of embryonic development. This increase was paralleled by an increase in translatable aortic elastin mRNA and by the in vivo rate of elastin synthesis, demonstrating that the change in synthesis during development is largely controlled by the elastin mRNA content of the aorta."
https://openalex.org/W1594441347,"The locus of luteinizing hormone (LH) stimulation of steroidogenesis in the corpus luteum was studied in superovulated immature rat ovaries after injections of LH with and without aminoglutethimide or cycloheximide. When steroidogenesis was blocked by these inhibitors, LH caused the accumulation of cholesterol in mitochondria. A stimulation of mitochondrial cholesterol side chain cleavage activity by LH was observed in the aminoglutethimide-injected animals, but was suppressed in the cycloheximide-injected animals. LH alone caused an increase in cholesterol side chain cleavage activity even though the mitochondrial cholesterol content was significantly decreased. The effect of LH on mitochondrial cholesterol side chain cleavage was prominent in the initial rapid phase of the biphasic reaction, which may reflect the amount of steroidogenic cholesterol in the mitochondria. Mitochondria obtained from LH-treated animals could utilize exogenous cholesterol, but mitochondria derived from the cycloheximide-treated groups could not. In incubations of Ca2+swollen mitochondria with various concentrations of exogenous cholesterol, side chain cleavage activity was always found to be higher in LH-treated groups. This effect was not inhibited by the injection of cycloheximide. These findings indicate that there are at least three independent loci for LH action on steroidogenesis. The first locus is on or prior to cholesterol accumulation in mitochondria. The second locus involves a change in the form or distribution of cholesterol in mitochondria to increase the steroidogenic cholesterol pool, and this step is probably mediated by newly synthesized protein(s). The third locus is the direct activation of the cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme system by LH."

https://openalex.org/W1540328099,"The method for two-dimensional hybridization mapping of nucleosomes (Levinger, L., Barsoum, J., and Varshavsky, A. (1981) J. Mol. Biol. 146, 287-304) was used to analyze chromatin structure of the gene for dihydrofolate reductase (DHF reductase; 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate:NADP+ oxidoreductase (EC 1.5.1.3)) in L5178Y-R mouse cells. The DHF reductase gene in these cells is amplified about 350-fold as a result of selection for resistance to methotrexate. Dramatic overproduction of DHF reductase mRNA in L5178Y-R cells suggests that most of the DHF reductase genes in these cells are transcribed. We report that all major mononucleosomal species resolvable by two-dimensional fractionation are detected by both DHF reductase- and satellite DNA-specific hybridization probes. Although the DHF reductase and satellite hybridization patterns differ somewhat from each other and from the total mononucleosomal pattern, their overall similarity is very high. In particular, no large differences in the abundance of mononucleosomes containing high mobility group non-histone proteins (HMG) 14 and 17 are seen between the DHF reductase and satellite chromatin regions under a wide variety of conditions for chromatin isolation, digestion, and fractionation. Possible interpretations of the apparent lack of selectivity of HMG-chromatin interactions in this system are discussed. We also found that the amplified DHF reductase genes possess a wide range of nucleosomal repeat lengths close to that in the bulk chromatin. In contrast, the range of nucleosomal repeat lengths in the satellite chromatin is much narrower than in both DHF reductase and bulk chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2069933901,"When young rats are exposed to white fluorescent light the concentration of calcium in their serum decreases. This effect is prevented by shielding the occiput, by inhibiting corticosterone synthesis, and by exogenous melatonin. Furthermore, the expected hypocalcemic response to cortisol injection is prevented by melatonin. Light-induced hypocalcemia may result from increased calcium uptake by bone when the blocking effect of melatonin decreases after pineal inhibition by transcranial illumination."
https://openalex.org/W129931760,A strategy is presented for identification of putative neurohormones that were predicted by sequence analysis of recombinant cDNa molecules. The nucleotide sequence of a cloned calcitonin cDNA insert predicts that the proteolytic excision of calcitonin from a 136-amino acid precursor should generate two additional peptides derived from regions flanking the calcitonin sequence on the NH2 and carboxyl termini. The predicted 16-amino acid COOH-terminal cleavage peptide (NH2-Asp-Met-Ala-Lys-Asp-Leu-Glu-Thr-Asn-His-His-Pro-Thr-Phe-Gly-Asn-COOH) was chemically synthesized using solid phase procedures. Antibodies against this synthetic hexadecapeptide detect immunologically cross-reactive material in tissue extracts from normal thyroid glands and calcitonin-producing medullary thyroid carcinomas. Each of the four calcitonin mRNA-directed cell-free translation products contain the immunological determinants for both calcitonin and the COOH-terminal cleavage peptide.
https://openalex.org/W1582857238,"A new large scale purification procedure for a human damage-specific DNA binding protein is described. Physical characterization suggests that the protein can dissociate into active subunits. A maximum molecular weight of 400,000 was obtained using gel exclusion chromatography, while electrophoresis through a pH 8 polyacrylamide gradient gel suggested a minimum molecular weight for the active protein of 120,000. Binding to UV-irradiated DNA revealed a broad pH optimum, no temperature dependence between 0 and 37 degrees C, and inhibition by intercalating agents. The use of 254 nm irradiation and of 313 nm irradiation in the presence of a triplet state sensitizer with alternating copolymers indicated that the protein was recognizing singlet-state-derived thymine lesions as well as triplet-state-derived adenine lesions. Inhibition of protein binding by pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and NaBH4 suggested a role for lysine at the DNA binding site, while sulfhydryl group involvement was indicated by the sensitivity of the protein to p-hydroxymercuribenzoate inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1562757776,"Mouse Friend virus-transformed erythroleukemia cells in culture undergo erythroid differentiation when treated with a variety of compounds including iron protoporphyrin IX, i.e. hemin. Exogenous hemin is not only incorporated into hemoglobin in these cells but also stimulates heme biosynthesis (Granick, J. L., and Sassa, S. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 5402-5406). In this study, we examined whether metalloporphyrins other than hemin can also induce differentiation, and if so, whether they can also be incorporated into hemoglobin. Among eight metalloporphyrins examined in culture of these cells, i.e. Co, Mn, Cu, Mg, Ni, Zn, Sn, and Cd protoporphyrin IX, only Co protoporphyrin (10(-4) M) was found to significantly increase the biosynthesis of heme and hemoglobin. In contrast to hemin-mediated induction of erythroid differentiation, Co protoporphyrin was not incorporated into hemoglobin in Friend cells. These data indicate that Co protoporphyrin induces the formation of heme and hemoglobin in Friend cells and that these increases are due to the enhancement of heme biosynthetic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1589680933,"Extracts of frozen human pituitaries were mitogenic in a fetal rabbit chondrocyte bioassay. In the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum, a 10-fold increase in chondrocyte cell number was observed upon addition of the pituitary factor to the culture medium. After gel filtration, the chondrocyte growth factor eluted with proteins of approximately 40,000 molecular weight. These fractions were pooled and purified further upon ion exchange chromatography using DEAE-cellulose. The most active fraction stimulated cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner down to 10 ng/ml. The chondrocyte growth factor was trypsin- and heat-sensitive (100 degrees C, 10-15 min). Its isoelectric point (pI 7.9) was different from bovine brain and pituitary fibroblast growth factor (pI 4.8-5.8 and pI 9.5, respectively. Unlike the somatomedins and epidermal growth factor, it was acid-labile. Preparations of human growth hormone, prolactin, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone, as well as vasopressin and oxytocin, were inactive in the bioassay, demonstrating that the human pituitary contains a chondrocyte growth factor which appears to be distinct from these anterior and posterior pituitary hormones."

https://openalex.org/W1490839832,"We have isolated and characterized a monoglucuronide fraction of 9,10-secocholesta-5,7,10(19)triene-1 alpha, 3 beta, 25-triol, 5,6-cis isomer (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) from rat bile. Polar radioactive metabolites of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were purified by a sequence of chromatographic procedures which utilized Amberlite XAD-2, diethylaminohydroxypropyl Sephadex LH-20, liquid-liquid partition on paper, and reverse phase chromatography on C-18 microparticulate columns. A purified radioactive substance showed maximal absorbance at 264 nm, indicating the presence of a triene in the 5,6-cis configuration. Mass spectrometry by fast atom bombardment of the product demonstrated an ion at m/z 637 atomic mass units that is consistent with a natriated sodium salt of a monoglucuronide of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ([MNa]Na+). Following methylation of the carboxylic acid group and formation of trimethylsilyl ethers of the hydroxyl groups, the fragmentation pattern of the product was compatible with that of a monoglucuronide of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. The intact metabolite was treated with beta-glucuronidase and the aglycon was isolated by chromatography on microparticulate silica. The aglycon co-migrated with authentic 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 during chromatography and it gave a mass fragmentation pattern consistent with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. The aglycon was bound by an intestinal cytosol receptor with essentially the same affinity as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. These findings indicate that bile contains a monoglucuronide of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3."
https://openalex.org/W1482617332,"Two new vitamin D metabolites were isolated in pure form from incubations of 53 nM 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 with homogenates of small intestinal mucosa of vitamin D-replete chicks. The birds were injected intravenously with 8 to 9 nmol of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3/100 g body weight 5 to 8 h before death. The isolation involved methanol-chloroform extraction and four successive chromatographic procedures (Sephadex LH-20 and high performance liquid chromatography). Chemical structures of the metabolites are proposed on the basis of (a) their chromatographic behavior, (b) their mass spectra, and (c) ultraviolet absorption spectra. They are identified as 1 alpha,25-dihydroxy-23-oxo-vitamin D3 and 1 alpha,25,26-trihydroxy-23-oxo-vitamin D3. Neither of the two new metabolites is produced by the intestinal mucosa when 1,25S,26-trihydroxyvitamin D3 is used as a substrate."

https://openalex.org/W1531820594,"Abstract Changes in the Eu3+ luminescence decay constant observed for Eu3+ bound to prothrombin fragment 1 and the peptide containing residues 1-39 of prothrombin result solely from changes in the number of water molecules in the primary hydration sphere of the ion. Highly coordinated sites which bind Eu3+ in a different manner from simple Gla-containing peptides exist on both the fragment 1 and 1-39 molecules. Metal ions bound at some of these sites do not appear to undergo rapid exchange with metal ions in solution. The binding of other lanthanide ions and calcium ions in the presence of europium ions cause a change in the conformation of the macromolecules, resulting in even tighter coordination of fragment 1 or residues 1-39 to Eu3+. Hydrophilic groups other than the actual Eu3+ binding sites on fragment 1 help to maintain its water solubility when complexes to Eu3+ or Ca2+. Because the 1-39 peptide does not contain as many of these hydrophilic groups, the peptide precipitates upon binding to di- and trivalent cations. Self-association of the 1-39 molecules appears to occur at high peptide concentrations which result in a peptide concentration effect on Eu3+ binding not seen in fragment 1. pH titration yields results which suggest a role for Gla carboxyl groups in Eu3+ complexation to both fragments 1 and 1-39. Although the two molecules are not identical with regard to Eu3+ binding behavior, enough similarities exist that residues 1-39 appear to be a reasonable model of the fragment 1 molecule for the purposes of metal ion complexation studies."
https://openalex.org/W1605685650,"Steroid hormone receptors are DNA-binding proteins with distinct domains for the steroid ligand and for polydeoxyribonucleotides. The characteristics of the polynucleotide-binding sites of the mouse liver dexamethasone receptor, kidney testosterone and estradiol receptors, and uterine estradiol receptor were examined by using oligodeoxynucleotides covalently linked to cellulose as probes. Only dexamethasone receptor binding to oligodeoxynucleotides was dependent upon activation by increased salt concentrations or temperature. The dexamethasone and estradiol receptors required a distinct concentration of KCl for maximal binding to oligodeoxynucleotide-cellulose. In contrast, binding of mouse kidney testosterone receptor was not stimulated by KCl although it was decreased at 0.2 M KCl. The nucleotide affinities of the mouse receptors generally followed the order of binding to oligo(dG)- greater than oligo(dT)- greater than oligo(dC)- greater than oligo(dA)-cellulose. However, the liver dexamethasone receptor bound to oligo(dT)- more avidly than to oligo(dC)-cellulose, while neither the testosterone nor the estradiol receptors clearly differentiated between the oligodeoxypyrimidine celluloses. Although the binding of the kidney testosterone receptor was poorest of those studied, it bound to oligo(dA)-cellulose relatively more efficiently than did the other steroid receptors. Thus, differences were revealed in the requirements for activation, added salt for binding, and relative binding efficiencies to the ligands among different steroid receptors from the same tissue and among the same steroid receptors from different tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1548098344,"Goat antibody IgG produced against bovine corpus luteum mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 (P-450scc) associated with cholesterol side chain cleavage (CSCC) was used to compare immunological characteristics of mitochondrial cytochrome P-450s from the bovine adrenal cortex (BAM), bovine corpus luteum (BCLM), and human placenta (HPM). In Ouchterlony double diffusion, anti-P450scc produced a single band with BAM and BCLM P-450scc, but not with HPM P-450scc or BAM P-450 11 beta. Appropriate concentrations of this anti-P-450scc IgG inhibited the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone in BCLM and BAM preparations equivalently, but inhibition of placental P-450scc was considerably less. The addition of BCLM iron sulfur protein and iron sulfur protein reductase to HPM P-450scc increased CSCC approximately 5-fold. Under these conditions, anti-P-450scc inhibited CSCC in HPM. Solubilized and sonicated BCLM preparations were inhibited equivalently but more than whole mitochondria. Addition of anti-P-450scc IgG to BAM increased 11 beta-hydroxylation activity in concentration-dependent fashion. It appears that the cytochrome P-450sccs from BAM and BCLM are very similar if not identical, but immunologically different from HPM P-450scc. The BAM P-450 11 beta is immunochemically distinct from BCLM P-450scc. The CSCC and 11 beta-hydroxylation systems of the adrenal are intimately linked because inhibition of P-450scc markedly stimulated 11 beta-hydroxylation. Finally, the inhibition of CSCC activity of BAM, BCLM, and HPM P-450 indicates that the antigenic effect is directed toward the active site."
