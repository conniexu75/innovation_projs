The effects on plants and trees were determined to be primarily mechanical; i.e., prevention of gas exchange due to clogging of stomata. Removal of the dust by rainfall was negligible due to seasonal drought; frequent fogs tended to set or fix the dust, forming a crust. Market values and salability of land has been influenced by the excess of dust and the market for otherwise fine table grapes limited."

Sources indicate a two-pronged strategy will be proposed: spending $5 million a year to study the possibility of buying and converting a commercial nuclear reactor and nearly $50 million to begin developing a giant tritium producing accelerator - the APT or Accelerator Production of Tritium. The decision will provide years of APT development work for Los Alamos National Laboratory, but will disappoint backers of a huge special-purpose reactor to be built in South Carolina and proposed as a alternative tritium source. In addition the possibility of a giant new accelerator could offer some dangerous consolation for researchers still becoming the loss of the Advanced Neutron Source."

https://openalex.org/W1979336724,"When particles crash against each other in the heart of the world`s atom smashers, some bizarre events occur. In soft collisions two speeding particles such as protons strike each other with a glancing blow; often one breaks up in a shower of particles while the other travels on virtually unscatched. There are finally some hints about the character of these soft collisions coming from the HERA accelerator at Germany`s DESY high-energy physics lab. The entity apparently mediating the collisions is made up of pointlike particles whose distribution can be measured. This article describes the ramifications and debate surrounding these new discoveries."
