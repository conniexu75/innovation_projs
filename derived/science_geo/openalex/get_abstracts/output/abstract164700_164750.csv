https://openalex.org/W3122602071,"Many ``real-world'' networks are clearly defined while most ``social'' networks are to some extent subjective. Indeed, the accuracy of empirically-determined social networks is a question of some concern because individuals may have distinct perceptions of what constitutes a social link. One unambiguous type of connection is sexual contact. Here we analyze data on the sexual behavior of a random sample of individuals, and find that the cumulative distributions of the number of sexual partners during the twelve months prior to the survey decays as a power law with similar exponents $\alpha \approx 2.4$ for females and males. The scale-free nature of the web of human sexual contacts suggests that strategic interventions aimed at preventing the spread of sexually-transmitted diseases may be the most efficient approach."

https://openalex.org/W2330829715,"Constitutive activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins has been detected in a wide variety of human primary tumor specimens and tumor cell lines including blood malignancies, head and neck cancer, and breast cancer. We have previously demonstrated a high frequency of Stat3 DNA-binding activity that is constitutively-induced by an unknown mechanism in human breast cancer cell lines possessing elevated EGF receptor (EGF-R) and c-Src kinase activities. Using tyrosine kinase selective inhibitors, we show here that Src and JAK family tyrosine kinases cooperate to mediate constitutive Stat3 activation in the absence of EGF stimulation in model human breast cancer cell lines. Inhibition of Src or JAKs results in dose-dependent suppression of Stat3 DNA-binding activity, which is accompanied by growth inhibition and induction of programmed cell death. In addition, transfection of a dominant-negative form of Stat3 leads to growth inhibition involving apoptosis of breast cancer cells. These results indicate that the biological effects of the Src and JAK tyrosine kinase inhibitors are at least partially mediated by blocking Stat3 signaling. While EGF-R kinase activity is not required for constitutive Stat3 activation in breast cancer cells, EGF stimulation further increases STAT DNA-binding activity, consistent with an important role for EGF-R in STAT signaling and malignant progression. Analysis of primary breast tumor specimens from patients with advanced disease revealed that the majority exhibit elevated STAT DNA-binding activity compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues. Our findings, taken together, suggest that tyrosine kinases transduce signals through Stat3 protein that contribute to the growth and survival of human breast cancer cells in culture and potentially in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2048056602,"Magnetic interactions and magnetic impurities are destructive to superconductivity in conventional superconductors. By contrast, in some unconventional macroscopic quantum systems (such as superfluid 3He and superconducting UGe2), the superconductivity (or superfluidity) is actually mediated by magnetic interactions. A magnetic mechanism has also been proposed for high-temperature superconductivity. Within this context, the fact that magnetic Ni impurity atoms have a weaker effect on superconductivity than non-magnetic Zn atoms in the high-Tc superconductors has been put forward as evidence supporting a magnetic mechanism. Here we use scanning tunnelling microscopy to determine directly the influence of individual Ni atoms on the local electronic structure of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta. At each Ni site we observe two d-wave impurity states of apparently opposite spin polarization, whose existence indicates that Ni retains a magnetic moment in the superconducting state. However, analysis of the impurity-state energies shows that quasiparticle scattering at Ni is predominantly non-magnetic. Furthermore, we show that the superconducting energy gap and correlations are unimpaired at Ni. This is in strong contrast to the effects of non-magnetic Zn impurities, which locally destroy superconductivity. These results are consistent with predictions for impurity atom phenomena derived from a magnetic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2145532375,"Multi-component Bose-Einstein condensates provide opportunities to explore experimentally the wealth of physics associated with the spin degrees of freedom. The ground-state properties and line-like vortex excitations of these quantum systems have been studied theoretically. In principle, nontrivial spin textures consisting of point-like topological excitations, or skyrmions, could exist in a multi-component Bose-Einstein condensate, owing to the superfluid nature of the gas. Although skyrmion excitations are already known in the context of nuclear physics and the quantum-Hall effect, creating these excitations in an atomic condensate would offer an opportunity to study their physical behaviour in much greater detail, while also enabling an ab initio comparison between theory and experiment. Here we investigate theoretically the stability of skyrmions in a fictitious spin-1/2 condensate of 87Rb atoms. We find that skyrmions can exist in such a gas only as a metastable state, but with a lifetime comparable to (or even longer than) the typical lifetime of the condensate itself."

https://openalex.org/W1977154222,"The temperature anomalies in the Earth's mantle associated with thermal convection can be inferred from seismic tomography, provided that the elastic properties of mantle minerals are known as a function of temperature at mantle pressures. At present, however, such information is difficult to obtain directly through laboratory experiments. We have therefore taken advantage of recent advances in computer technology, and have performed finite-temperature ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of the elastic properties of MgSiO3 perovskite, the major mineral of the lower mantle, at relevant thermodynamic conditions. When combined with the results from tomographic images of the mantle, our results indicate that the lower mantle is either significantly anelastic or compositionally heterogeneous on large scales. We found the temperature contrast between the coldest and hottest regions of the mantle, at a given depth, to be about 800 K at 1,000 km, 1,500 K at 2,000 km, and possibly over 2,000 K at the core-mantle boundary."
https://openalex.org/W2057029503,"The cDNA of a novel human glutathione transferase (GST) of the Alpha class was cloned, and the corresponding protein, denoted GST A3-3, was heterologously expressed and characterized. GST A3-3 was found to efficiently catalyze obligatory double-bond isomerizations of Δ5-androstene-3,17-dione and Δ5-pregnene-3,20-dione, precursors to testosterone and progesterone, respectively, in steroid hormone biosynthesis. The catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) with Δ5-androstene-3,17-dione was determined as 5 × 106m−1 s−1, which is considerably higher than with any other GST substrate tested. The rate of acceleration afforded by GST A3-3 is 6 × 108 based on the ratio between k cat and the rate constant for the nonenzymatic isomerization of Δ5-androstene-3,17-dione. Besides being high in absolute numbers, the k cat/K m value of GST A3-3 exceeds by a factor of ∼230 that of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase, the enzyme generally considered to catalyze the Δ5-Δ4 double-bond isomerization. Furthermore, GSTA3-specific polymerase chain reaction analysis of cDNA libraries from various tissues showed a message only in those characterized by active steroid hormone biosynthesis, indicating a selective expression of GST A3-3 in these tissues. Based on this finding and the high activity with steroid substrates, we propose that GST A3-3 has evolved to catalyze isomerization reactions that contribute to the biosynthesis of steroid hormones.

Conway T.W. Spector A.A. Chappell D. Biochemistry: A Case-oriented Approach. 6th Ed. Mosby-Year Book, Inc., St. Louis1996: 587-618Google Scholar). In one of the chemical transformations, Δ5-androstene-3,17-dione (Δ5-AD)1isomerizes to Δ4-AD, the immediate precursor of testosterone. A steroid isomerase that catalyzes this double-bond isomerization with high efficiency was discovered originally in bacteria (2Talalay P. Wang V.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1955; 18: 300-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 3Kuliopulus A. Mildvan A.S. Shortle D. Talalay P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A similar efficient enzyme is not present in mammalian tissues, but some glutathione transferases (GSTs) have also been known since the 1970s to exhibit steroid isomerase activity (4Benson A.M. Talalay P. Keen J.H. Jakoby W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, GSTs differ from the bacterial isomerase in that they use the tripeptide glutathione (GSH) as a cofactor. The soluble GSTs occur as an enzyme superfamily of dimeric proteins playing a prominent role in the inactivation of numerous toxic electrophiles of both exogenous and endogenous origins. The majority of these detoxication reactions involve conjugation of GSH with the toxin via nucleophilic attack on the electrophilic center in the second substrate. The GSTs are grouped into different classes primarily based on primary structure (5Mannervik B. Ålin P. Guthenberg C. Jensson H. Tahir M.K. Warholm M. Jörnvall H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7202-7206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar, 6Mannervik B. Awasthi Y.C. Board P.G. Hayes J.D. DiIlio C. Ketterer B. Listowsky I. Morgenstern R. Muramatsu M. Pearson W.R. Pickett C.B. Sato K. Widersten M. Wolf C.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 305-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Variations of the amino acid residues that make up the electrophilic substrate-binding site (H-site) in different isoenzymes provide the GST family with the ability to catalyze reactions toward a large number of structurally diverse substrates. For example, in the Alpha class GST A4-4 exhibits high catalytic efficiency with biologically relevant alkenal substrates (7Hubatsch I. Ridderström M. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), whereas GST A1-1 and GST A2-2 efficiently catalyze the reduction of fatty acid and phospholipid hydroperoxides (8Zhao T.J. Singhal S.S. Piper J.T. Cheng J.Z. Pandya U. Clark-Wronski J. Awasthi S. Awasthi Y.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The isomerization of endogenous steroids differs from the ordinary type of GST-catalyzed reaction, because the GSH molecule serves as a base in the mechanism (9Pettersson P.L. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11698-11704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and is not consumed in the process. We have isolated a novel Alpha class glutathione transferase, GST A3-3, and discovered that it catalyzes essential Δ5-Δ4 isomerizations of intermediates in steroid hormone biosynthesis much more efficiently than any previously known GST or other human enzyme. The gene encoding GST A3-3 has been published (10Suzuki T. Johnston P.N. Board P.G. Genomics. 1993; 18: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), but isolation of the corresponding complete cDNA has not been reported previously, and evidence for the expression of the protein was lacking. Oligonucleotides that specifically would amplify the cDNA of GST A3-3 were designed based on the sequence of the GSTA3 gene (10Suzuki T. Johnston P.N. Board P.G. Genomics. 1993; 18: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These primers, 5′GSTA3NCEcoRIForw and 3′GSTA3NCBamHIRev with the sequences 5′-ATATGAATTCAACCTCCAGAAGACTGTTACCATGGC-3′ and 5′-AATAATGGATCCTTCTTAGCCTCCATGGCTGCT-3′, respectively (restriction sites are underlined), were purchased from Interactiva (Ulm, Germany). The GSTA3 cDNA was amplified in a standard PCR using cloned Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and Gene PoolTM cDNA derived from normal human placenta (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) as template. The PCR conditions were: 94 °C for 5 min and 94 °C for 1 min, 54 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min repeated 35 times followed by 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR product was purified from agarose gel using the Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and cloned into the cloning vector pGEM®-3Z (Promega, Madison, WI) using the EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites. The cDNA was propagated in Escherichia coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene) and subjected to sequencing on both strands using the Thermo Sequenase radiolabeled terminator cycle sequencing kit (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH). Gene PoolTMcDNA derived from human testis, ovaries, and adrenal gland, purchased from Invitrogen, and cDNA libraries derived from human liver, thymus, skeletal muscle, and fetal brain provided generously by Dr. Peter Gustavsson (Department of Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University) were used as templates in GSTA3-specific PCRs. Gene PoolTM cDNA from placenta was used as template in a positive control reaction, and PCRs using primers specific for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were run in parallel as a quality control of the cDNA libraries. For each primer pair, a negative control reaction lacking cDNA was also performed. The isolated cDNAs from all GSTA3-expressing tissues were cloned and sequenced. An expression clone of GST A3-3 was constructed in several steps. The cDNA was PCR-amplified using cloned Pfu DNA polymerase and the primers GSTA33′NCBamHIRev (described above) and GSTA35′EcoRI (5′-AATAATGAATTCATGGCAGGGAAGCCAAGCTT-3′), which introduces an EcoRI restriction site (underlined) just before the start codon. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI andBamHI and cloned into pGEM®-3Z. Because of the presence of many internal restriction sites in the GSTA3 cDNA, we eliminated an internal SalI site by introducing a silent mutation to be able to subclone the cDNA into the expression vector pKK-D (11Björnestedt R. Widersten M. Board P.G. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) using EcoRI and SalI. This was accomplished by using inverted PCR, cloned Pfu DNA polymerase, and the 5′-end phosphorylated primers GSTA3327Rev (5′-GCAGAAGAAGGATCATTTCATTCAAAT-3′) and GSTA3328Forw (5′-CCTTATGTCGTCCTGAGAAAAAGAT-3′) and pGEMGSTA3 as template. The following PCR program was used: 95 °C for 10 min followed by the cycle 95 °C for 1 min, 54 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 10 min repeated 35 times. Finally, the PCR product was extended at 72 °C for 30 min. The PCR product was subcloned into the expression vector pKK-D. The resulting expression clone named pKK-DGSTA3 was sequenced in its entirety to verify that no unwanted mutations had been introduced. E. coli XL-1 Blue carrying the expression clone pKK-DGSTA3 was grown in 2× TY (1.6% (w/v) tryptone, 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.5% (w/v) NaCl) at 37 °C overnight. The culture was diluted 200 times in 2× TY and grown to an A 600 of 0.35, and the protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. After 16 h of growth, the cells were harvested followed by lysing using ultrasonication. GST A3-3 was purified from the lysate by affinity chromatography (12Simons P.C. Vander Jagt D.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 82: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST A3-3 was eluted with buffer containing 10 mm GSH. The purity was determined using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and amino acid analysis after hydrolysis. The extinction coefficient 23,900 ± 540 m−1cm−1 at 280 nm for the protein subunit was determined on the basis of the absorption spectrum and the results of the amino acid analysis. The specific activities of GST A3-3 for the isomerization reactions with Δ5-AD and Δ5-PD, purchased from Steraloids, Inc. (Newport, RI), were determined at 248 nm with 1.0 mm GSH, pH 8.0 (25 mm sodium phosphate buffer), at 30 °C. Extinction coefficients used were 16.3 mm−1cm−1 for Δ4-AD (4Benson A.M. Talalay P. Keen J.H. Jakoby W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and 17.0 mm−1 cm−1 for Δ4-PD (13Thomas J.L. Berko E.A. Faustino A. Myers R.P. Strickler R.C. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1988; 31: 785-793Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The specific activity of GST A3-3 toward a panel of substrates comprised of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), ethacrynic acid, cumene hydroperoxide, and 2-cyano-1,3-dimethyl-1-nitrosoguanidine, commonly employed for characterizing GSTs, was determined by spectrophotometric assays at 30 °C under standard conditions (14Mannervik B. Widersten M. Pacifici G.M. Fracchia G.N. Advances in Drug Metabolism in Man. European Commission, Luxembourg1995: 407-459Google Scholar). In addition, the activity was measured with nonenal (7Hubatsch I. Ridderström M. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and the isothiocyanates phenethylisothiocyanate and sulforaphane (15Meyer D.J. Crease D.J. Ketterer B. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar,16Kolm R.H. Danielson U.H. Zhang Y. Talalay P. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The isomerization activity of GST A3-3 with Δ5-AD and Δ5-PD was monitored both at pH 7.4 in PBS (37 °C) and pH 8.0 in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (30 °C) at the saturating 1 mm concentration of GSH. The concentration of Δ5-AD was varied between 0.5 and 100 µm, and the concentration of Δ5-PD ranged between 2 and 20 µm. (It was not possible to use higher concentrations of Δ5-PD because of its limited solubility.) For comparison, the activity of GST A1-1 (17Stenberg G. Björnestedt R. Mannervik B. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with Δ5-AD was measured at pH 7.4 in PBS at 37 °C. The conjugation activity with CDNB was determined in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, at 30 °C in the presence of 5 mm GSH and by varying the concentration of CDNB between 25 and 1.5 mm. Data points were also collected at a constant concentration of Δ5-AD (200 µm) or CDNB (1.5 mm) at concentrations of GSH between 0.020 and 1.5 mm at 30 °C, pH 8.0 and pH 6.5, respectively. The steady-state kinetic parameters were determined by fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation to the data points using Prism 2.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). The inhibitory effect of the product Δ4-AD (50 µm) was measured at 1 mm GSH and by varying the concentration of Δ5-AD between 5 and 100 µm. TheK i value of Δ4-AD was determined by fitting the equation for competitive inhibition to the experimental data. cDNA libraries from various tissues were screened for GSTA3 expression using GSTA3-specific PCR. GSTA3 cDNA comprising 719 base pairs was amplified from the four tissues, placenta, ovary, adrenal gland, and testis. No expression of GST A3-3 could be detected in liver, thymus, skeletal muscle, or fetal brain (Fig. 1). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-specific PCR, run in parallel, amplified glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase sequences from all cDNA libraries, showing that all the cDNA libraries used were of high quality (results not shown). Sequencing of both strands of the isolated GSTA3 cDNA from the four different tissues derived from four different individuals demonstrated that the nucleotide sequences were identical. However, the isolated GSTA3 cDNA differed from the previously published partial cDNA (18Board P.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 827-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) in one position. C instead of A at nucleotide position 208 in the partial GSTA3 cDNA translates into a Leu instead of an Ile at residue 70 in the protein. Comparison with the sequence of the exons in the GSTA3 gene (10Suzuki T. Johnston P.N. Board P.G. Genomics. 1993; 18: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) showed a difference at six nucleotide positions, of which four result in differences in the amino acid sequence. Because the GSTA3 cDNA sequences isolated in the present study differ from the previously published partial cDNA (18Board P.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 827-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) in only one position, it is likely that most of the nucleotide differences as compared with the sequence of the GSTA3 gene are caused by errors in the analysis of the GSTA3 gene and not to a genetic polymorphism. Whether the sequence variation in codon 70 is caused by a true polymorphism needs to be investigated further. In addition to the amplified full-length GSTA3 cDNA, a 52-base pair shorter PCR product was obtained in all GSTA3-positive tissues (Fig.1). Sequencing demonstrated that the shorter sequences were identical in all tissues and that it differed from the full-length cDNA only in length because of the absence of exon 3 in the shorter cDNA. The GSTA3 transcript lacking exon 3, if translated, would give rise to a truncated protein consisting of 32 amino acids, because joining the 3′ end of exon 2 with the 5′ end of exon 4 results in a +1 frameshift. A different truncated transcript of the GSTA3 gene was isolated previously (18Board P.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 827-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this, a stretch of 26 nucleotides was attached to the 5′ end of exon 3. The isolation of several distinct GSTA3 transcripts suggests that the pre-mRNA of GSTA3 is subject to alternative splicing. GST A3-3 was purified successfully from an E. coli expression culture. A single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the results of a total amino acid analysis showed that the full-length protein was expressed. The finding that the enzyme could be stored on ice for several months without losing activity shows that the enzyme is stable. Polyclonal anti-GST A1-1 antibodies (19Hao X.-Y. Castro V.M. Bergh J. Sundström B. Mannervik B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1225: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) cross-reacted with purified GST A3-3 in a Western blot and produced a single band, indicating that GST A3-3 possesses a structure with epitopes similar to those of GST A1-1. The isoelectric point of GST A3-3 was determined as 9.3, which is the highest value determined for any cloned human Alpha class GST (7Hubatsch I. Ridderström M. Mannervik B. Biochem.

Open table in a new tab The specific activity with Δ5-AD was higher than with Δ5-PD partly because of a lower concentration of the latter substrate (caused by lower solubility) in the assay system. With other established GST substrates, the activity of GST A3-3 did not differ notably from that of GST A1-1. It is noteworthy that the specific activities of GST A3-3 with the other substrates were generally lower than those obtained with the steroids.K mGSH was determined to 110 ± 22 µm using either Δ5-AD or CDNB as second substrate, which is close to the K mGSHvalue determined for GST A1-1 (22Stenberg G. Board P.G. Carlberg I. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In tissues, GST A3-3 is therefore saturated with GSH, because intracellular GSH concentrations are in the millimolar range. Steady-state kinetic parameters of GST A3-3 with the steroid substrates and CDNB at 30 °C are given in TableII. The rate constant (k non) for the nonenzymatic isomerization of Δ5-AD is 1.7 × 10−7 s−1(23Hawkinson D.C. Eames T.C.M. Pollack R.M.

To obtain values for direct comparison of GST A3-3 with the 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase, catalytic activities were also determined in PBS at 37 °C (Table II, Fig. 3). The K i value of Δ4-AD, tested as a product inhibitor, was determined as 25 µm, which is not significantly different from theK m value of Δ5-AD (24 ± 4 µm). This K m value is approximately half of the K m value of GST A1-1 for Δ5-AD (K m = 49 ± 4 µm), indicating a higher affinity of GST A3-3 for the same substrate.Table IISteady-state kinetic parameters of recombinant human GST A3–3Substrate (conditions)k cat2-aActivity with Δ5-androstene-3,17-dione was measured at 1.0 mmGSH and at concentrations of Δ5-androstene-3,17-dione varying between 0.5 and 100 µm.

Open table in a new tab The metabolic pathways that lead from cholesterol to steroid hormones such as testosterone and progesterone proceed in multiple steps via the intermediate 3β-hydroxy-5-pregnene-20-one (1Montgomery R. Conway T.W. Spector A.A. Chappell D. Biochemistry: A Case-oriented Approach. 6th Ed. Mosby-Year Book, Inc., St. Louis1996: 587-618Google Scholar). This intermediate is transformed by oxidation of the 3β-hydroxy group followed by an obligatory isomerization of the resulting 3-keto-Δ5product into the 3-keto-Δ4 isomer (Fig.2). Oxidation and isomerization are common features of three alternative pathways distinguished by the processing of different portions of the pregnenone molecule (1Montgomery R. Conway T.W. Spector A.A. Chappell D. Biochemistry: A Case-oriented Approach. 6th Ed. Mosby-Year Book, Inc., St. Louis1996: 587-618Google Scholar). For example, dehydroepiandrosterone through oxidation forms Δ5-AD, which isomerizes to Δ4-AD, the immediate precursor of testosterone. Similarly, the isomerization of Δ5-PD to Δ4-PD is on the pathway to progesterone. The isomerization of 3-keto-Δ5 steroids to the Δ4 isomers is thermodynamically favored, but the nonenzymatic reaction is negligible under physiological conditions. The 3-keto compound is formed in a pyridine nucleotide-dependent 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase reaction (24Samuels L.T. Helmreich M.L. Lasater M.B. Reich H. Science. 1951; 113: 490-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The dehydrogenase has an associated steroid isomerase activity and is generally assumed to effect the isomerization of the primary product (1Montgomery R. Conway T.W. Spector A.A. Chappell D. Biochemistry: A Case-oriented Approach. 6th Ed. Mosby-Year Book, Inc., St. Louis1996: 587-618Google Scholar, 25Thomas J.L. Myers R.P. Strickler R.C. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1989; 33: 209-217Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, the catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) of GST A3-3 with Δ5-AD is 230 times higher than the isomerase activity of the dehydrogenase (Fig. 3). At identical protein concentrations the isomerase activity of the “bifunctional” dehydrogenase is therefore negligible in comparison with the activity of GST A3-3. It should be noted that GSTs from other classes have significantly lower specific activities, and the high activities are characteristic of Alpha class isoenzymes (14Mannervik B. Widersten M. Pacifici G.M. Fracchia G.N. Advances in Drug Metabolism in Man. European Commission, Luxembourg1995: 407-459Google Scholar). GST A1-1 was previously the enzyme with the highest steroid isomerase activity known in human tissues (9Pettersson P.L. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11698-11704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), but we find that the catalytic efficiency of GST A3-3 is ∼20 times higher with both Δ5-AD and Δ5-PD (Fig. 3). The k cat/K m values of GST A3-3 for the steroid substrates (5.0 × 106 and 1.7 × 106m−1s−1) are in the range of 106–108m−1 s−1, characterizing highly efficient enzymes acting on their natural substrates (26Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W.H. Freeman & Co., New York1999Google Scholar). The catalytic efficiency with Δ5-AD displayed by GST A3-3 is one of the highest reported for a GST with any substrate, suggesting that it is of physiological importance. To play a role in steroid hormone biosynthesis, GST A3-3 has to be expressed in steroidogenic tissues. We have demonstrated by GST A3-specific PCR that testis, ovary, adrenal gland, and placenta contain GST A3-3 mRNA. All these tissues are characterized by the active production of steroid hormones. In contrast, thymus, liver, skeletal muscle, and fetal brain did not express any detectable GST A3-3 message (Fig. 1). GST A1-1 is a major hepatic enzyme (2–3% of the total cytosolic protein) and is also found in significant amounts in kidney and testis (27Rowe J.D. Nieves E. Listowsky I. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 28Sherratt P.J. Pulford D.J. Harrison D.J. Green T. Hayes J.D. Biochem.

J. 1990; 269: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, GST A1-1 does not show the selective expression in steroidogenic tissues noted for GST A3-3. In human gonads, Alpha class GSTs have been immunohistochemically identified in cells relevant to hormone production, i.e.testicular interstitial Leydig cells and ovarian cells of the Graffian follicle and corpus luteum as well as cells in the reticular layer of the adrenal cortex (30Campbell J.A.H. Bass N.M. Kirsch R.E. Cancer. 1980; 45: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A similar Alpha class-specific distribution was found in rat gonads (31Fukai F. Ohtaki H. Ueda T. Katayama T. J. Clin. Biochem. Nutr. 1992; 12: 93-107Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Although the polyclonal antibodies used do not distinguish GST A3-3 from other Alpha class enzymes, this selective tissue expression provides support for a role of GSTs in steroid hormone biosynthesis. What is the structural basis behind the marked differences between the Alpha class GSTs in isomerization activity with the steroid substrates? A protein sequence alignment of the human Alpha class GSTs is shown in Fig. 4. The three-dimensional structure of human GST A1-1 has been determined, and the residues that form the GSH-binding site (G-site, highlighted in blue) and the H-site (highlighted in red) have been identified (32Sinning I. Kleywegt G.J. Cowan S.W. Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Huber R. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. Ji X. Board P.G. Olin B. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 192-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). A comparison of GST A3-3, GST A2-2, and GST A1-1 shows that the residues that make up the GSH-binding site are strictly conserved. 20 amino acids of 222 (including the initiator methionine) differ between GST A1-1 and GST A3-3 (91% identity); three are positioned in the H-site (Fig. 4). Five of the 26 residues that differ between GST A2-2 and GST A3-3 (88% identity) are situated in the H-site. The specific activity of GST A3-3 with Δ5-AD is 5- and 1000-fold higher than those of GST A1-1 and GST A2-2, respectively, despite the high sequence identity between these enzymes (Table I). This is a new example of how relatively small structural differences involving a few amino acid residues in Alpha class GSTs can exert a major effect on substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency. The introduction of a limited number of GST A4-4 residues into GST A1-1 has been shown previously to be enough for installing the high activity with alkenals that is characteristic of GST A4-4 (33Nilsson L.O. Gustafsson A. Mannervik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9408-9412Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the sequence identity between GST A3-3 and GST A4-4 is low (54%), and the specific activity of GST A3-3 with Δ5-AD is 6500 times higher than that of GSTA4-4. The high activity with well established metabolic precursors and the selective expression of GST A3-3 in steroidogenic tissues strongly suggest that GST A3-3 has evolved specifically to participate in the biosynthesis of steroid hormones. Previously, the soluble GSTs have been regarded mainly as detoxication enzymes. Membrane-associated GSTs and related proteins have been linked to the metabolism of eicosanoids such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins (34Jakobsson P.J. Thorén S. Morgenstern R. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7220-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). However, several of the soluble enzymes such as GST A2-2, GST M2-2, and GST M3-3 also display activity of physiological relevance with prostaglandins (35Burgess J.R. Chow N.-W.I. Reddy C.C. Tu C.-P.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 36Beuckmann C.T. Fujimori K. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Neurochem. Res. 2000; 25: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It should be noted also that 4-hydroxynonenal, which is a characteristic substrate for GST A4-4 (7Hubatsch I. Ridderström M. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), has chemotactic properties (37Müller K. Hardwick S.J. Marchant C.E. Law N.S. Waeg G. Esterbauer H. Carpenter K.L.H. Mitchinson M.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and activates the epithelial growth factor receptor (38Suc I. Meilhac O. Lajoie-Mazenc I. Vandaele J. Jürgens G. Salvayre R. Negre-Salvayre A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 665-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, the steroid isomerase activity of GST A3-3 adds to the emerging paradigm of GSTs being linked to various facets of biological signaling in addition to their role in cellular defense against electrophiles.

https://openalex.org/W2024937228,"p53 tumor suppressor is a subject of several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination and acetylation, which regulate p53 function. A new covalent modification of p53 at lysine 386 by SUMO-1 was recently identified. To elucidate the function of sumoylated p53, we compared the properties of wild type p53 and sumoylation-deficient p53 mutant, K386R. No differences were found between wild type p53 and K386R mutant of p53 in transactivation or growth suppression assays. Moreover, overexpression of SUMO-1 has no effect on p53-regulated transcription. Biochemical fractionation showed that sumoylated p53 is localized in the nucleus and is tightly bound to chromatin structures. p53 and SUMO-1 co-localized in PML nuclear bodies in 293 cells and the nucleoli in MCF7 and HT1080 cells. However, sumoylation-deficient p53 mutant showed a similar pattern of intranuclear localization, suggesting that SUMO-1 does not target p53 to subnuclear structures. These data indicate that SUMO-1 modification of p53 at lysine 386 may not be essential for p53's cellular localization, transcriptional activation, or growth regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1976048849,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. The HCV capside core is a multifunctional protein with regulatory functions that affects transcription and cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Here, we show that both HCV genotype 1a and 3 core proteins activate MEK1 and Erk1/2 MAP kinases and that the costitutive expression of the HCV core results in a high basal activity of Raf1 and MAP/kinase/kinase, as determined by endogenous Raf1 in vitro kinase assay and immunodetection of hyperphosphorylated Erk1 and Erk2 even after a serum starvation. Moreover, the activation of both Erk1/2 and the downstream transcription factor Elk-1 in response to the mitogenic stimulus EGF is significantly prolonged. The sustained response to EGF in cells expressing the HCV core occurs despite a normal induction of the MAP phosphatases MKP regulatory feedback and is likely due to the costitutive activation of Raf-1 activity. The ability of HCV core proteins to directly activate the MAP kinase cascade and to prolong its activity in response to mitogenic stimuli may contribute to the neoplastic transformation of HCV infected liver cells."
https://openalex.org/W2152415360,"Synemin is a large intermediate filament (IF) protein that has been identified in all types of muscle cells in association with desmin- and/or vimentin-containing IFs.

Furthermore, extensive assays utilizing the Gal4 yeast two-hybrid system demonstrate interactions of synemin with desmin and vimentin and additionally define more precisely the protein subdomains involved in the synemin/α-actinin and synemin/vinculin interactions. The C-terminal ∼300-amino acid region of synemin binds to the N-terminal head and central rod domains of α-actinin and the ∼150-amino acid C-terminal tail of vinculin. Overall, these interactions indicate that synemin may anchor IFs to myofibrillar Z-lines via interactions with α-actinin and to costameres at the sarcolemma via interactions with vinculin and/or α-actinin.

Science. 1998; 279: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), and novel members continue to be identified (10Fuchs E. Cleveland D.W.

Because of the diversity among members of the protein superfamily, it is possible that IFs within different cell types may be formed that have diverse functions (4Herrmann H. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Additionally, because the majority of IFs found in living cells are heteropolymeric in nature (i.e. composed of more that one IF protein member), even more diverse functionality of an individual IF is possible (4Herrmann H. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The IFs have long been considered to play an important role as mechanical integrators of cellular space (2Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar, 13Lazarides E. Nature. 1980; 283: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar, 14Coulombe P.A. Bousquet O. Ma L.

The actual mechanism by which this cytoskeletal integration occurs within cells, however, remains poorly understood. For IFs to connect cell components, some form or type of attachment of IFs to other cytoskeletal components is necessary. These attachments could be indirect, via a cross-linking protein such as plectin that binds to several cytoskeletal proteins (10Fuchs E. Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 279: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 15Wiche G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2477-2486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or direct, by linking IF proteins themselves to protein components within other cellular structures (12Bellin R.M. Sernett S.W.

Synemin was initially described as an IF-associated protein because it colocalized and copurified with the IF proteins desmin and vimentin (16Granger B.L. Lazarides E.

However, we recently demonstrated that synemin is, in fact, an IF protein because the sequence contains the ∼310-amino acid rod domain characteristic of IF proteins (12Bellin R.M. Sernett S.W.

Furthermore, we demonstrated that synemin (1,604 residues, 182,187 Da) is a novel member of the IF protein superfamily in that it contains an unusually large C-terminal tail domain (1,290 residues). Synemin has been localized with desmin- and/or vimentin-containing IFs in all types of developing chick (20Price M.G. Lazarides E. J.

Skalli O. Glia. 2000; 30: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because to date synemin has always been found in the presence of at least one major IF protein, and because it fails to form IFs by itself in vitro (21Bilak S.R. Sernett S.W. Bilak M.M. Bellin R.M. Stromer M.H. Huiatt T.W. Robson R.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and when transfected into cells that lack other IF proteins (12Bellin R.M.

We have shown previously by blot overlay assays that synemin interacts with both desmin and α-actinin (12Bellin R.M. Sernett S.W. Becker B. Ip W. Huiatt T.W. Robson R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29493-29499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We now show, by blot overlay assays, a direct interaction between synemin and the tail domain of vinculin. Furthermore, we demonstrate these interactions with α-actinin and vinculin and further define the specific binding sites for these interactions by using the Gal4 yeast two-hybrid system. These specific interactions further support a role for synemin, as a component of heteropolymeric IFs, in directly attaching these IFs to other cytoskeletal structures via direct protein/protein interactions involving synemin. Our major interest is to define how the cytoskeletal elements are organized and attached to each other within muscle cells. We present a schematic showing how synemin in striated muscle cells may serve as a cytoskeletal cross-linking component by enabling synemin-containing heteropolymeric IFs to (a) directly bind to myofibrillar Z-lines and thereby link all cellular myofibrils via synemin/α-actinin interactions and (b) help in anchoring the peripheral layer of cellular myofibrils to the costameric sites at the sarcolemma via synemin/vinculin and/or synemin/α-actinin interactions.

The precise cleavage site(s) in vinculin was determined by protein microsequencing from polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in the Iowa State University Protein Facility. The specific rod and tail domains of synemin were expressed in bacteria and purified (12Bellin R.M. Sernett S.W. Becker B. Ip W. Huiatt T.W. Robson R.M. J. Biol.

Constructs encoding the entire synemin molecule, as well as specific domains of synemin, α-actinin, and vinculin, were generated by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into both the pPC86 and pPC97 yeast two-hybrid vectors originally described by Chevray and Nathans (29Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar).

A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) was cotransformed with the Alkali-Cation Yeast Transformation kit (Bio101) by using the manufacturer's protocol. An empirically determined optimal amount of 400 ng of plasmid DNA was used for each construct. A fluorescence-based detection method was developed similar to that recently described by Meng and Ip (31Meng J.J. Ip W. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 161: 255-268PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitative determinations of all two-hybrid interactions were done by using the FluorAce β-galactosidase Reporter Assay Kit (Bio-Rad) modified for use with yeast cells as follows. Yeast cultures were started with 2 ml of double drop-out Leu− Trp− media and incubated in a rotary incubator at 180 rpm, 30 °C for 72 h, followed by 3 h of protein induction in galactose-containing Leu−Trp− media at 180 rpm, 30 °C. Yeast lysates were prepared by freezing the yeast pellet in liquid nitrogen for 5 min and resuspending it in 100 µl of Lysate Buffer (1 mmMgCl2, 0.1% NaN3, and 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0). An empirically determined amount of yeast lysate (20 µl) was mixed with 50 µl of the kit's 1× Reaction Buffer, which included β-methylumbelliferyl β-d-galactopyranoside and β-mercaptoethanol, directly in the wells of a black microtiter plate kept on ice. The plate was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, followed by the addition of 150 µl of the kit's 1× Stop Buffer. The plate was then read with a Titertek Fluoroskan fluorescent microplate reader with excitation at 355 nm and emission at 460 nm. The specificity of interactions was confirmed by performing vector-swap experiments for each protein pair. Both the original vector pair and the vector-swap pair were independently tested twice, with the numbers for each determination resulting from reaction wells set up in triplicate and averaged. The quantitative data reported in the figures were calculated by using an A 600 measurement of each individual culture to normalize the respective fluorescence reading. The resulting data were then used to calculate relative interaction affinities by comparing each reading with the value determined for the synemin rod/desmin interaction that was included with each set of assays. Analyses utilizing purified synemin and vinculin, as well as bacterially expressed rod and tail domains of synemin, and the proteolytic products of purified vinculin resulting from V8 protease treatment were conducted to identify interactions of specific protein domains. Vinculin was selected as a potential interaction partner for synemin because it is a key cytoskeletal protein potentially involved in signal transduction pathways (32Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12611-12619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Weekes J. Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and because it is a component of the costameres (34Pardo J.V. Siliciano J.D. Craig S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), one of the attachment sites for striated muscle cell IFs (35Craig S.W. Pardo J.V. Cell Motil. 1983; 3: 449-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). V8 protease digestion of vinculin resulted in the production of variable amounts of two low molecular mass bands (∼24 kDa and ∼22 kDa in Fig. 1). Protein microsequencing of these fragments revealed newly generated N termini having the sequences LAPPKPPLPE and GEVPPPRPPP. These sequences agree precisely with residue numbers 858–867 and 868–877, respectively, in the avian vinculin sequence (GenBankTM accession number Y00312), therefore showing that they both are tail fragments of vinculin. As shown in theControl buffer overlay blots lacking any probe protein in the overlay solution (Fig. 1, A and D), the synemin polyclonal antibody 2856 labeled synemin present in the gizzard homogenate (Fig. 1, A and D, lanes 1), purified synemin (Fig. 1 A, lane 2), and expressed synemin rod domain (Fig. 1 D, lane 2) but did not label purified vinculin (Fig. 1, A andD, lanes 3), the small amount of intact purified vinculin remaining after V8 protease treatment (Fig. 1, Aand D, lanes 4), or any other proteins in the gizzard homogenate (Fig. 1, A and D, lanes 1). As is shown in Fig. 1 B, probing blots of vinculin and V8-digested vinculin with purified intact synemin in the overlay revealed an interaction of synemin with purified intact vinculin (lane 3), the very small amount of intact vinculin remaining in the V8 protease digest of vinculin (lane 4), and the small tail domain fragment(s) of vinculin produced by the V8 protease digestion (lane 4), but not with the large head domain fragment of vinculin that migrated with an approximate size corresponding to 90 kDa. Additionally, an interaction between the probe synemin in the overlay solution and desmin in the gizzard homogenate lane (Fig. 1 B, lane 1) can be seen, as we reported previously (12Bellin R.M. Sernett S.W. Becker B. Ip W. Huiatt T.W. Robson R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29493-29499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Probing blots (Fig. 1) with expressed synemin tail (Fig. 1 C) and rod domains (Fig. 1 E) resulted in binding patterns similar to that seen when using intact synemin, although only weak binding to the vinculin tail domain is seen (Fig. 1,C and E, lanes 4). It is evident that synemin binds specifically to the vinculin tail domain because neither synemin (Fig. 1 B) nor synemin domains (Fig. 1, Cand E) bound to any of the other proteins (e.g.filamin, myosin heavy chains, and actin) present in the gizzard homogenate (Fig. 1 B, C, and E,lanes 1). The lack of binding to α-actinin in the gizzard homogenate (Fig. 1, B, C, andE, lanes 1) was also evident in the original blot overlay experiments depicting the synemin/α-actinin interaction (12Bellin R.M. Sernett S.W. Becker B. Ip W. Huiatt T.W. Robson R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29493-29499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In those studies, it appeared that the relatively large amount of desmin in the gizzard homogenate, in comparison to the amount of α-actinin, seemed to “bind up” the available synemin overlay protein, thereby obscuring the identification of the interaction between synemin and α-actinin. The synemin/α-actinin interaction was evident, however, with heavier loads of α-actinin (12Bellin R.M. Sernett S.W. Becker B. Ip W. Huiatt T.W. Robson R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29493-29499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Identification and analysis of interactions by the Gal4 two-hybrid system included sufficient controls to demonstrate that seemingly positive interactions are not due to false positives of the assay system. This is especially of concern when testing helical proteins, such as an IF protein rod domain, because a charged helix attached to the DNA-binding portion ofGal4 (as is present in the pPC97 vector) has been shown, in some cases, to activate β-galactosidase reporter gene expression (36Giniger E. Ptashne M. Nature. 1987; 330: 670-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The constructs used herein are shown in Fig.2. As demonstrated in Fig.3, when each of the constructs encoding a domain of synemin (see Fig. 2) is cotransfected with a negative control consisting of an empty two-hybrid vector (e.g. synemin rod insert in pPC86, but no insert in pPC97), the resulting values from the fluorescence assays were quite low, which indicates that none of the synemin constructs significantly activates transcription by itself.Figure 3Negative controls for two-hybrid assays of synemin constructs. The labels at the X axis refer to the construct names defined in the Fig. 2 legend.Vector refers to a two-hybrid vector without a cDNA insert, which is included as a negative control. All fluorescence values were calculated relative to the value (defined as 100) obtained in the interaction of synemin rod domain with desmin (column 9) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results from vector-swap tests (i.e. columns 1–9) of each interaction are shown as a pair of open and solid bars, with error bars representing the standard error of the mean. Open bars represent assays in which the synemin insert is in the pPC97 vector, and a control vector (columns 1–8) or desmin (column 9) is in the pPC86 vector.Solid bars represent assays in which the synemin insert is in the pPC86 vector, and a control vector (columns 1–8) or desmin (column 9) is in the pPC97 vector. Note that none of the synemin constructs tested with a control (empty) vector yielded significant amounts of transcription of the β-galactoside reporter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Results from two-hybrid assays testing synemin/desmin interactions are shown in Fig. 4. The rod domain of synemin interacts strongly with desmin (Fig. 4, column 1), as compared with the vector control (Fig. 4, column 9). The strong interaction between synemin and desmin was expected because other studies have shown that the rod domains of IFs are the primary interaction domains between IF protein pairs (reviewed in Ref. 4Herrmann H. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Results shown in Fig. 4 (columns 2-8) demonstrate that none of the tail domain constructs of synemin exhibit interactions with desmin in these assays. The results of the two-hybrid assays of the interactions between synemin and vimentin (Fig. 5) were very similar to those observed between synemin and desmin (Fig. 4), as may be expected because of the high sequence homology between the type III IF proteins vimentin and desmin (37Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 593-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar), which are the major IF proteins of developing and mature striated muscle cells, respectively (12Bellin R.M. Sernett S.W.

The rod domain of synemin reacts most strongly with vimentin (Fig.5, column 1), when compared with the vector control (Fig. 5,column 9). The results shown in Fig. 5 (columns 2-8) demonstrate that none of the tail domain constructs of synemin interact with vimentin, akin to the lack of synemin tail interactions with desmin (Fig. 4). Results from two-hybrid analysis of interactions between synemin and α-actinin are shown in Fig. 6. Analysis of these interactions must take into account that the full-length α-actinin pPC97 construct activated transcription by itself to a moderate degree (Fig. 6, column 9). When compared with the vector controls (Fig. 6, column 9), the interaction of synemin with α-actinin is specific for the tail domain of synemin (Fig. 6, column 2). Analysis of the constructs of the synemin tail domain split into four nonoverlapping parts indicates that SN tail IIb has the strongest interaction (Fig. 6, column 8), thus mapping the interaction domain to the last quarter of the C-terminal tail of synemin. Additionally, testing this tail domain construct with domains of α-actinin demonstrates interaction of the SN tail IIb with both the N-terminal head domain of α-actinin (Fig.6, column 10), which contains the actin-binding site, and the rod domain of α-actinin (Fig. 6, column 12), which contains four spectrin-like repeats (38Baron M.D. Davison M.D. Jones P. Critchley D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17623-17629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Arimura C. Suzuki T. Yanagisawa M. Imamura M. Hamada Y. Masaki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Each of these interactions is much stronger than the respective vector control results (cf. columns 10 and 11 andcolumns 12 and 13 of Fig. 6). Two-hybrid assays of the remaining synemin constructs with the three α-actinin constructs revealed no other strong interactions. 2R. M. Bellin and R. M. Robson, unpublished observations. The results of the two-hybrid assays of the interaction between synemin and vinculin are shown in Fig. 7. Because the head and tail domains within a single vinculin molecule are known to interact in a fashion that blocks some protein interaction sites in solution (26Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 40Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), interactions with vinculin were tested on subdomains of vinculin, rather than on the whole molecule. In agreement with the blot overlay assays shown earlier (Fig. 1), the synemin rod (Fig. 7,column 7) and synemin tail domains (Fig. 7, columns 8, 10, and 12) interact strongly with the vinculin tail domain in comparison with the vector control (Fig. 7,column 13). Within subdomains of the synemin tail domain, the strongest interaction with the vinculin tail was found with the SN tail IIb construct (Fig. 7, column 12). Thus, the end of the tail domain and the rod domain (Fig. 7, column 7) of synemin show affinity for the vinculin tail domain. Two-hybrid assays of the remaining tail domain constructs of synemin with the vinculin constructs revealed no other strong interactions.2 Identification of the interaction between synemin and vinculin is an important advance in understanding linkages within the cytoskeleton. Although it has long been recognized that IFs attach or insert into and are thus somehow linked to protein-rich cytoskeletal/membrane attachment sites, the only well established mechanism for cytoskeletal attachment of IFs involves members of the plakin family (30Meng J.J.

Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). The cell-matrix adhesion plaques include the membrane-associated dense bodies in smooth muscle, the neuromuscular and myotendenious junctions in skeletal muscle, and the costameres of striated muscle cells (34Pardo J.V.

The costameres, which are located proximal to the sarcolemma at sites adjacent to the myofibrillar Z-lines of the peripheral layer of myofibrils are, in fact, often defined by the presence of vinculin (46Imanaka-Yoshida K.

Expression of arrestin-green fluorescent protein (ARR2-GFP or ARR3-GFP) chimeras in HASM significantly attenuated isoproterenol (β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR)-mediated)- and 5′-(N-ethylcarboxamido)adenosine (A2b adenosine receptor-mediated)-stimulated cAMP production, with fluorescent microscopy demonstrating agonist-promoted redistribution of cellular ARR2-GFP into a punctate formation.

The pharmacological profile of various selective EP receptor ligands suggested a predominantly EP2 receptor population in HASM. Further analysis in COS-1 cells revealed that ARR2-GFP expression increased agonist-promoted internalization of wild type β2AR and EP4 receptors, whereas EP2 receptors remained resistant to internalization. However, expression of an arrestin whose binding to GPCRs is largely independent of receptor phosphorylation (ARR2(R169E)-GFP) enabled substantial agonist-promoted EP2 receptor internalization, increased β2AR internalization to a greater extent than did ARR2-GFP, yet promoted EP4 receptor internalization to the same degree as did ARR2-GFP. Signaling via endogenous EP4 receptors in CHO-K1 cells was attenuated by ARR2-GFP expression, whereas ARR2(R169E)-GFP expression in HASM inhibited EP2 receptor-mediated cAMP production.

Among these processes is the well defined phosphorylation of GPCRs by the family of serine-threonine kinases known as G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), originally defined by their capacity to specifically phosphorylate agonist-occupied GPCRs and promote receptor desensitization (1Penn R.B. Benovic J.L. Conn P.M. Handbook of Physiology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 125-164Google Scholar). GRK-mediated GPCR phosphorylation induces receptor binding to arrestin molecules, which serves to sterically inhibit GPCR-heterotrimeric G protein coupling and terminate G protein activation. Four members of the arrestin family have been identified: arrrestin-1 (also termed visual arrestin) and arrestin-4 (cone arrestin) are specifically expressed in the visual system and serve to regulate photoreceptors; arrestin-2 (β-arrestin1) and arrestin-3 (β-arrestin2) are more widely expressed and are involved in the regulation of nonvisual GPCRs (2Sterne-Marr R.

Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the capacity of arrestins to regulate properties of endogenously expressed GPCRs in intact cells is relatively unexplored. Initially, Iacovelli et al. (30Iacovelli L. Franchetti R. Masini M. De Blasi A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1138-1146PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that expression of wild type arrestin-2 in FRTL5 cells could attenuate cAMP production mediated via endogenous thyrotropin receptors. Two recent studies by Mundell et al. (31Mundell S.J. Loudon R.P. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8723-8732Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 32Mundell S.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12900-12908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) have provided the only analyses of arrestin specificity for endogenously expressed GPCRs to date. Expression of antisense mRNA targeting arrestin-2 and arrestin-3 in HEK293 cells resulted in an ∼50% decrease in cellular arrestin levels and an increase in signaling through endogenously expressed β2AR, A2bAR, m1 muscarinic, somatostatin, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptors, whereas signaling through P2y (1Penn R.B. Benovic J.L. Conn P.M. Handbook of Physiology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 125-164Google Scholar), P2y (2Sterne-Marr R. Benovic J.L. Vitam. Horm. 1995; 51: 193-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and AT1 angiotensin receptors was unaffected. By demonstrating that arrestins and arrestin expression levels can be important determinants of endogenous GPCR signaling, these studies represent an important step toward establishing the relevance of arrestins in regulating receptor-mediated functions in the in vivo condition. In this study we examined arrestin specificity for endogenously expressed GPCRs in a differentiated, physiologically relevant cell type-human airway smooth muscle (HASM), in which GPCRs regulate numerous cellular functions (33Ammit A.J. Hastie A.T. Edsall L.C. Hoffman R.K. Amrani Y. Krymskaya V.P. Kane S.A. Peters S.P. Penn R.B. Spiegel S. Panettieri Jr., R.A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1212-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Heterologous expression of arrestin-2- or arrestin-3-green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimeras in HASM significantly attenuated cAMP production mediated by endogenous β2ARs and A2bARs, and agonist-dependent subcellular redistribution of arrestin was consistent with a role for arrestins in mediating the internalization of activated β2ARs and A2bARs into clathrin-coated pits. Alternatively, PGE2-stimulated second messenger accumulation was independent of arrestin expression, and PGE2 failed to elicit arrestin redistribution in HASM cells. Further analysis using various cell lines expressing recombinant EP2 or EP4 PGE2 receptors revealed that internalization of the EP2 (but not of the EP4) subtype of PGE2 receptors was resistant to regulation by arrestins. This resistance could be attributed in part to EP2 receptor phosphorylation state, as a phosphorylation-independent arrestin-2 mutant was capable of promoting both EP2 internalization and desensitization. Interestingly, arrestin effects on GPCR signaling could not be observed in experimental models employing receptor overexpression, but were consistently observed in analyses of endogenous receptor signaling. These studies demonstrate the specificity of arrestins for endogenous GPCRs in a physiologically relevant cell type and reveal the disparate regulation of EP2 and EP4 receptors by arrestins that potentially contributes to the differences in receptor function. 125I-adenosine 3′,5′-cyclicphosphoric acid (2,200 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. cAMP antibody was a gift from Mario Ascoli (University of Iowa). pEGFPN1 was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA).

All other reagents were purchased from Sigma or from sources described previously (34DeGraff J.L. Gagnon A.W. Benovic J.L. Orsini M.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 19: 338-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). HASM cultures were established as described by Panettieri et al. (36Panettieri R.A. Murray R.K. DePalo L.R. Yadvish P.A. Kotlikoff M.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C329-C335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from human tracheae obtained from lung transplant donors, in accordance with procedures approved by the University of Pennsylvania Committee on Studies Involving Human Beings. Characterization of these cell lines with regard to immunofluorescence of smooth muscle actin and agonist-induced changes in cytosolic calcium has been reported previously (36Panettieri R.A.

Third to sixth passage cells were plated at a density of 104 cells/cm2 in either 24 or 48 well (for cAMP accumulation assays in intact cells) and maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Confluent cells were growth-arrested by refeeding cells with Ham's F-12 supplemented with 5 µg/ml each insulin and transferrin (IT medium) for 24 h prior to assay. Lines of HEK293-EBNA cells stably expressing either the human EP2 receptor (HEK293EP2) or human EP4 receptor (HEK293EP4) were obtained from J. Regan (University of Arizona) and maintained in 250 µg/ml G418 and 200 µg/ml hygromycin B. COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. CHO-K1 cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Constructs encoding ARR2-GFP, ARR3-GFP, and ARR2(R169E)-GFP were generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the open reading frames of bovine ARR2, ARR3, and ARR2R169E (38Kovoor A. Celver J. Abdryashitov R.I. Chavkin C. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6831-6834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) (all previously cloned into pcDNA3) and cloning in pEGFPN1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) such that the C-terminal GFP sequence was in frame to generate the intended chimera. Plasmids encoding the EP2 and EP4 receptors fused to an N-terminal 3-HA tag were generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the human EP2 and EP4 open reading frames from pCEP-EP2 and pCEP-EP4 (provided by B. Ashby, Temple University) and ligation of the resultantEcoRI/XbaI digests into a pcDNA3 vector containing a 3-HA cassette immediately upstream of the EcoRI site (provided by T. Som, Thomas Jefferson University). For all constructs, orientation, in frame alignment, and sequence were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. HASM cells seeded onto 15-cm plates were transfected as described previously (39Mundell S.J. Olah M.E. Panettieri R.A. Benovic J.L. Penn R.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 24: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) by addition of a HEPES-based CaPO4 mixture containing 10 µg of carrier DNA, and 30 µg of either pEGFP, pARR2EGFP, pARR3EGFP, or pARR2(R169E)EGFP. HASM cells expressing GFP were subsequently sorted to >99% purity by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using a Coulter Epics Elite ESP Flow Cytometer as described previously (39Mundell S.J. Olah M.E. Panettieri R.A. Benovic J.L. Penn R.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 24: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Following sorting, cells were plated at a density of 3 × 104 cells/cm2 in 48-well plates and grown in Ham's F-12, 10% FBS. 24 h later cells were refed IT medium for 24 h, then subsequently stimulated as described below. Determination of protein density per well was assessed in parallel wells using the Bradford assay (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar). HEK293EP2, HEK293EP4, and COS-1 cells were transfected in 60-mm plates with Fugene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described previously (34DeGraff J.L. Gagnon A.W. Benovic J.L. Orsini M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11253-11259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). 24 h later, cells were passaged into 24-well plates (for subsequent ELISA, cAMP assay), six-well plates (immunoblot analysis of EP receptor, arrestin expression), 60-mm dishes (immunoprecipitation studies), or onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips (immunocytochemical localization of EP receptors, arrestin-GFP chimeras). HASM cells transfected as described above were selected with 250 µg/ml G418 starting 48 h after transfection. Subcultures were screened for GFP or arrestin-2 expression. For one culture stably expressing ARR2-GFP (ARR2-GFP(A)), untransfected cells from the same culture were used for control cells in studies of cAMP accumulation. In a second culture stably expressing ARR2-GFP (ARR2-GFP(B)), cells stably expressing GFP (a subpopulation of the parent culture transfected with pEGPN1, grown and passaged in parallel with ARR2-GFP(B)) served as control cells. CHO-K1 cells were transfected with either pEGFP, pARR2EGFP, or pARR2(R169E)EGFP using Fugene as described above for COS-1 cells and subsequently selected with 250 µg/ml G418. Ten days later cells surviving selection were sorted by FACS for GFP expression and subsequently maintained in G418. Except where noted, cells grown in 24-well plates were growth-arrested for 24 h, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and subsequently stimulated with 500 µl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 300 µM ascorbic acid, 1 mm RO-20-1724 (phosphodiesterase inhibitor), and either vehicle (basal), (−)-isoproterenol (ISO), PGE2, butaprost, 11-deoxy-PGE1, 15-keto-PGE2, 5′-(N-ethylcarboxamido)adenosine (NECA), or forskolin at the indicated concentrations for 10 min at 37 °C. cAMP was isolated and quantified by radioimmunoassay as described previously (35Penn R.B. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Benovic J.L. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 338-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For CHO-K1 cells, to minimize promiscuous activation of receptors (other than the EP4) by PGE2, a slightly lower concentration (100 nm) of PGE2 was used, and cells were stimulated in the presence of 10 µM SC-19220, a specific EP1 receptor antagonist (41Zeng L. An S. Goetzl E.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7159-7164Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Effects of arrestins on PGE2-mediated cAMP production in either HASM or CHO-K1 cells were similar when cells were pretreated for 8 h with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin (data not shown). For all cAMP data, values represent cAMP generated per well in response to agonist minus basal (vehicle-stimulated) values, normalized to the maximal control value. Protein concentration per well was similar between CON and experimental conditions, and conclusions based on statistical analysis were not affected by normalization. Visualization of the agonist-induced translocation of arrestin-GFP chimeras in cells was performed in real-time using a Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescence microscope. Cells transfected with the arrestin-GFP chimeras were passaged onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, growth-arrested, then mounted on a temperature-regulated imaging chamber (Warner Instrument Corp.) equipped with an inlet port for introduction of media/agents. Cells were observed using a Plan-Apo 60 ×1.40 NA oil immersion objective. Images were captured using QED Camera software. Agonist-induced redistribution of antibody-labeled (HA-tagged) receptors and ARR-GFP chimeras was observed in fixed COS-1 cells as described previously (9Mundell S.J. Mathura A. Kelly E. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12828-12836Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Effects of ARR2-GFP or ARR2(R169E)-GFP expression on agonist-promoted internalization of HA-tagged (β2AR, EP2, and EP4) receptors were assessed in COS-1 cells by ELISA as described previously (9Mundell S.J. Mathura A. Kelly E. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12828-12836Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments examining the kinetics of β2AR, EP2, and EP4 receptor sequestration demonstrated that sequestration observed in all groups began to plateau at ∼15 min after agonist addition. Subsequent experiments therefore focused on the effects of 15-min agonist treatment. COS-1 cells transiently transfected to express GFP, ARR2-GFP, or ARR2(R169E)-GFP, and either HA-tagged EP2 or EP4 receptor, were stimulated for 5 min with vehicle or 1 µM PGE2. Cells were then scraped in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml leupeptin) and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, centrifuged at 30,000 rpms for 30 min in a TLA45 rotor, and the resultant supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with purified anti-arrestin-2 antibody 178. Samples were then incubated with protein A-agarose for 2.5 h at 4 °C, washed in lysis buffer, and resuspended in SDS-sample buffer for immunoblot analysis of co-precipitated receptors using anti-HA antibody 101R. Data points from individual assays represent the mean values from duplicate or triplicate measurements. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistically significant differences among groups were assessed by either analysis of variance with Fisher's post-hoc analysis (Statview 4.5, Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA) or by t test for paired samples, with p values < 0.05 sufficient to reject the null hypothesis. To assess the role of arrestins in GPCR signaling in HASM cells, cultures were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding GFP chimeras of arrestin-2 (ARR2-GFP) or arrestin-3 (ARR3-GFP) or with pEGFP (GFP). Because transfection efficiency in HASM cultures is low (presently optimized to 20–30%) (39Mundell S.J. Olah M.E. Panettieri R.A. Benovic J.L. Penn R.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 24: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), GFP-expressing cells were subsequently isolated by FACS, resulting in homogeneous populations of cells expressing the construct of interest (Fig.1A). Immunoblot analysis of sorted populations demonstrated high ARR2-GFP expression relative to the (low) endogenous arrestin-2 levels (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, ARR3-GFP expression was high, but no endogenous arrestin-3 could be detected in HASM cells. In addition, two separate cultures were established under G418 selection to express ARR2-GFP with repeated passage. One culture exhibited a low level of ARR2-GFP expression (∼3–4-fold that of endogenous arrestin-2), whereas the other exhibited high ARR2-GFP expression (Fig. 1 C). As shown in Fig. 2, A andC, expression of ARR2-GFP or ARR3-GFP significantly inhibited cAMP accumulation elicited by either ISO or NECA, implicating both arrestin-2 and arrestin-3 as effective uncouplers of β2AR and A2bAR signaling in HASM cells. However, neither ARR2-GFP nor ARR3-GFP inhibited PGE2-stimulated cAMP accumulation (Fig. 2 B). A significantly lower level of ISO- and NECA-stimulated cAMP generation was also observed in two separate lines of HASM stably expressing ARR2-GFP when compared with matched control values (Fig. 2, D and F), whereas levels elicited by PGE2 remained unaffected (Fig. 2 E). Interestingly, the reductions (relative to matched control levels) in cAMP accumulation exhibited in the two stable ARR2-GFP lines were similar, despite the difference in ARR2-GFP expression (Fig.1 C). Arrestin-GFP expression did not significantly alter cAMP accumulation stimulated by forskolin (a receptor-independent activator of adenylyl cyclase; data not shown). Subsequent experiments were performed to analyze ARR2-GFP translocation in transiently transfected HASM cells. Cells expressing ARR2-GFP were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and mounted in a temperature-regulated imaging chamber for observation of ARR2-GFP localization in real-time. Upon addition of ISO, ARR2-GFP underwent rapid redistribution into punctate vesicles (Fig.3A), suggesting a rapid internalization of ASM β2ARs with arrestin into clathrin-coated pits or early endosomes (42Kallal L. Gagnon A.W. Penn R.B. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 322-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A less profound but still clear redistribution of ARR2-GFP was observed upon addition of NECA (Fig. 3 B), suggesting an arrestin-mediated internalization of A2bARs. However, PGE2 failed to promote any redistribution of ARR2-GFP (Fig. 3 C); subcellular ARR2-GFP localization remained unchanged in cells observed up to 2 h following PGE2 introduction. Cells stimulated with PGE2 remained responsive to subsequent stimulation with ISO (Fig. 3 C,far right panel). Two different receptor subtypes of the PGE2 receptor family, EP2 and EP4, are known to couple to Gs and stimulate adenylyl cyclase (43Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1193-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). These subtypes are distinguished by their structural, pharmacological, and functional features. The human EP2 receptor possesses a short third intracellular loop and a short C-terminal tail, is responsive to the agonist butaprost, and is resistant to agonist-induced short term desensitization (44Regan J.W. Bailey T.J. Pepperl D.J. Pierce K.L. Bogardus A.M. Donello J.E. Fairbairn C.E. Kedzie K.M. Woodward D.F. Gil D.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 213-220PubMed Google Scholar, 45Nishigaki N. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1031-1037PubMed Google Scholar). The EP4 receptor possesses a long third intracellular loop and a long C-terminal tail, is unresponsive to the agonist butaprost, and undergoes rapid agonist-induced desensitization (45Nishigak"

https://openalex.org/W2312739661,"Integrin signaling is activated during epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation (EMT) and cell migration, processes serving as models for carcinogenesis. We have shown that paxillin and p130Cas become highly tyrosine phosphorylated during these processes in NMuMG cells. Here, we examined the regulation of Fak and Pyk2, kinases implicated in this phosphorylation. Pyk2 became phosphorylated at the major autophosphorylation site (Tyr-402) and the potential Grb2-binding site (Tyr-881) during EMT. In contrast, phosphorylation of Fak at the corresponding autophosphorylation site (Tyr-397) occurred even in sedentary epithelial cells, whereas phosphorylation at Tyr-407 and Tyr-861 was induced during EMT. During cell migration, these phosphorylation events, except Fak Tyr-397, were augmented further, and phosphorylation of Fak Tyr-577 and the corresponding Pyk2 Tyr-580, both within the kinase activation loops, was also induced. In all cases, phosphorylation of the putative Grb2-binding site in Fak (Tyr-925) was almost undetectable. Although Fak and Pyk2 have several phosphorylation sites in common, Tyr-407 and Tyr-861 are unique to Fak. Our results revealed that Fak and Pyk2 are non-equivalent in the tyrosine phosphorylation events and thereby likely to evoke different downstream signaling cascades during EMT and cell migration of NMuMG cells. We also show that Fak Tyr-397 phosphorylation occurs exclusively at the cytoplasm, but not at focal contacts, in the sedentary epithelial cells. In contrast, all other tyrosine phosphorylated forms of Fak and Pyk2 are predominantly localized to focal adhesions and the cell periphery in motile cells, all colocalized with paxillin and p130Cas."
https://openalex.org/W1990213899,"Thrombopoietin and its receptor (Mpl) support survival and proliferation in megakaryocyte progenitors and in BaF3 cells engineered to stably express Mpl (BaF3/Mpl). The binding of thrombopoietin to Mpl activates multiple kinase pathways, including the Jak/STAT, Ras/Raf/MAPK, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways, but it is not clear how these kinases promote cell cycling. Here, we show that thrombopoietin induces phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is required for thrombopoietin-induced cell cycling in BaF3/Mpl cells and in primary megakaryocyte progenitors. Treatment of BaF3/Mpl cells and megakaryocytes with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 inhibited mitotic and endomitotic cell cycl-ing. BaF3/Mpl cells treated with thrombopoietin and LY294002 were blocked in G1, whereas megakaryocyte progenitors treated with thrombopoietin and LY294002 showed both a G1 and a G2 cell cycle block. Expression of constitutively active Akt in BaF3/Mpl cells restored the ability of thrombopoietin to promote cell cycling in the presence of LY294002. Constitutively active Akt was not sufficient to drive proliferation of BaF3/Mpl cells in the absence of thrombopoietin. We conclude that in BaF3/Mpl cells and megakaryocyte progenitors, thrombopoietin-induced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity is necessary but not sufficient for thrombopoietin-induced cell cycle progression. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity is likely to be involved in regulating the G1/S transition. Thrombopoietin and its receptor (Mpl) support survival and proliferation in megakaryocyte progenitors and in BaF3 cells engineered to stably express Mpl (BaF3/Mpl). The binding of thrombopoietin to Mpl activates multiple kinase pathways, including the Jak/STAT, Ras/Raf/MAPK, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways, but it is not clear how these kinases promote cell cycling. Here, we show that thrombopoietin induces phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is required for thrombopoietin-induced cell cycling in BaF3/Mpl cells and in primary megakaryocyte progenitors. Treatment of BaF3/Mpl cells and megakaryocytes with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 inhibited mitotic and endomitotic cell cycl-ing. BaF3/Mpl cells treated with thrombopoietin and LY294002 were blocked in G1, whereas megakaryocyte progenitors treated with thrombopoietin and LY294002 showed both a G1 and a G2 cell cycle block.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity is likely to be involved in regulating the G1/S transition. thrombopoietin bromodeoxyuridine bovine serum albumin interleukin Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium megakaryocyte phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase propidium iodide recombinant human TPO Tris-buffered saline (pH 8.0) containing 0.05% Tween-20 Mature megakaryocytes are large, polyploid bone marrow cells that give rise to circulating platelets (1Kaushansky K. Blood. 1995; 86: 419-431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thrombopoietin (TPO)1 has been characterized as the primary hematopoietic cytokine regulating normal megakaryocyte (MK) development. The receptor for TPO is encoded by the c-mpl proto-oncogene, a member of the hematopoietic growth factor receptor family, which in altered form causes a myeloproliferative syndrome in mice (2Wendling F. Varlet P. Charon M. Tambourin P. Virology. 1986; 149: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition to its effects on MK development, TPO has been found to play a significant role in promoting stem cell survival, and in conjunction with other cytokines, it can support stem cell expansion (3Sitnicka E. Lin N. Priestley G.V. Fox N. Broudy V.C. Wolf N.S. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1996; 87: 4998-5005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Yagi M. Ritchie K.A. Sitnicka E. Storey C. Roth G.J. Bartelmez S. Proc.

Blood. 1996; 87: 2162-2170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Characterization of the pathways by which TPO signals to promote survival and proliferation in stem cells and developing MKs is critical to a better understanding of the physiologic, pathologic, and potentially therapeutic roles of the cytokine in stem cell expansion, myeloproliferative disorders, and states of bone marrow failure. Many of the effects of TPO on cell survival and proliferation have been ascribed to activation of the Jak/STAT and Ras/Raf/MAPK pathways (reviewed in Ref. 6Drachman J.G. Rojnuckarin P. Kaushansky K. Methods. 1999; 17: 238-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Activation of Jak2 leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of Mpl as well as STAT3 and STAT5 (7Bacon C.M. Tortolani P.J. Shimosaka A. Rees R.C. Longo D.L. O'Shea J.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 8Drachman J.G. Griffin J.D. Kaushansky K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4979-4982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and the phosphorylated STATs dimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they stimulate transcription. In addition, phosphorylation of distal tyrosine residues on Mpl creates docking sites for SHC, which undergoes phosphorylation and then recruits Grb2/SOS, thus activating the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway (8Drachman J.G. Griffin J.D. Kaushansky K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4979-4982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 9Yamada M. Komatsu N. Okada K. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Miura Y. Biochim.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6531-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Activation of the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway can also occur by an alternative, as yet undetermined mechanism, independent of the distal receptor phosphotyrosine residues (11Rojnuckarin P. Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1999; 94: 1273-1282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although these studies and others have shown that activation of the Jak/STAT and Ras/Raf/MAPK pathways is important for signaling by Mpl, other pathways likely contribute to the cellular response to TPO. One such pathway that may contribute to Mpl signaling is phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). PI3K has been shown to be activated by many growth factors involved in hematopoiesis, including stem cell factor, platelet-derived growth factor, erythropoietin, interleukin 3 (IL-3), IL-2, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, insulin-like growth factor 1, and TPO (12Corey S. Eguinoa A. Puyana-Theall K. Bolen J.B. Cantley L. Mollinedo F. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2681-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 13Sattler M. Salgia R.

Larner A.C. Blood. 2000; 95: 1656-1662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been well established that activation of PI3K plays an important role in promoting cell survival (17Kennedy S.G.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). However, although there are ample data supporting a requirement for PI3K in proliferation of nonhematopoietic cells (20Coughlin S.R. Escobedo J.A. Williams L.T. Science. 1989; 243: 1191-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 21Jhun B.H. Rose D.W. Seely B.L. Rameh L. Cantley L. Saltiel A.R. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell.

Studies in cell lines with IL-2, IL-3, and erythropoietin have supported a role for PI3K in the proliferative response (23Ahmed N.N. Grimes H.L. Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Importantly, the conclusions from studies performed in primary cells often differ from those performed in cell lines. For example, data from cell lines support the role of PI3K in erythropoietin-induced proliferation (24Jaster R. Bittorf T. Brock J. Cell Signal. 1997; 9: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 25Shigematsu H. Iwasaki H. Otsuka T. Ohno Y. Arima F. Niho Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14334-14340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), whereas a study done in primary erythroid progenitors concluded that the specific role of PI3K was to promote erythropoietin-induced survival (28Haseyama Y. Sawada K. Oda A. Koizumi K. Takano H. Tarumi T. Nishio M. Handa M. Ikeda Y. Koike T. Blood. 1999; 94: 1568-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies demonstrate that the role of PI3K in cell proliferation may be cytokine- and cell type-specific. Therefore, in this, work we examined TPO signaling both in a TPO-responsive cell line (BaF3/Mpl) and in primary murine MK progenitors, and we show that an intact PI3K pathway is necessary but not sufficient for cell cycling. BaF3/Mpl cells were obtained from Zymogenetics (Seattle, WA) and have been previously described (29Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2350-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Mpl expression was verified by FACS using a polyclonal rabbit anti-Mpl (Zymogenetics). BaF3/Mpl cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml fungizone (BioWhittaker), 2 mml-glutamine, 20 ng/ml recombinant human TPO (rhTPO) (Zymogenetics), and puromycin (1 μg/ml). MyrAktMpl cells were also cultured with G418 (500 μg/ml). All cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air. pcDNA-MyrAkt was the generous gift of Peter Vogt and has been described (30Aoki M. Batista O. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95 (11495): 14950Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). BaF3/Mpl cells were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA by electroporation and selected in G418 (500 μg/ml). A pooled line was obtained (MyrAktMpl). We verified that MyrAktMpl expressed constitutive Akt activity by performing Western blotting for phosphorylated Ser473 Akt and phosphorylated Ser9 GSK-3β (New England Biolabs) on protein lysates from cells cultured in the absence of TPO, with TPO, or with TPO and LY294002 (data not shown). Isolation of mouse MK progenitors was performed by modification of a protocol described previously (31Hodohara K. Fujii N. Yamamoto N. Kaushansky K. Blood. 2000; 95: 769-775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, BDF-1 female mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were injected subcutaneously with 2 μg of rhTPO for 7 consecutive days prior to bone marrow harvest. Mice were anesthetized by CO2 narcosis and sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and their femurs and tibiae were removed. Marrow cells from these bones were flushed into CATCH buffer (0.36% sodium citrate, 2 mm theophylline, and 1 mm adenosine in calcium-free Hanks' buffered salt solution) containing 3% BSA, 1 μg/ml prostaglandin E1 (Sigma) and 1 units/ml DNase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Red cells were removed by centrifugation through a Optiprep 1.080 (Nycomed, Oslo, Norway) gradient. Lineage depletion was performed using the rat anti-mouse antibodies 7/4 (Serotec, Raleigh, NC), TER119, CD-5, MAC-1, B220, and GR-1 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) followed by incubation with sheep anti-rat IgG magnetic beads (Dynabeads, Dynal, Lake Success, NY). Lineage-positive cells were removed by the application of a magnet, and lineage-negative cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h in IMDM/10% fetal bovine serum containing 10 μm Hoechst 33342. These cells were then labeled with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD41 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-Gr-1 (Pharmingen). The CD41-positive, Gr-1-negative cells were sorted into 2N and 4N populations using a Vantage fluorescence activated cell sorter (Becton-Dickinson San Diego, CA). All procedures involving animals and their care conformed to institutional guidelines. Mice were injected with rhTPO for 5 days, and marrows were flushed into CATCH buffer as described above. Whole bone marrow cells were cultured for 3 days in IMDM supplemented with 1% Nutridoma (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), fungizone, l-glutamine, and mouse recombinant TPO (5% v/v conditioned medium, about 37.5 ng/ml). Mature MKs were purified over a discontinuous BSA (fraction V, Sigma) density gradient (0/2/4% BSA). By this method, 90% of the cells that settle to the bottom over 40 min are mature MKs (11Rojnuckarin P. Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1999; 94: 1273-1282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BaF3/Mpl cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline to remove growth factor and serum. MKs were used as isolated from the discontinuous albumin gradient. Cells were starved for 6 h in RPMI containingl-glutamine, fungizone, and 0.5% BSA. Starved cells were preincubated for 30 min with 16 μm LY294002 dissolved in Me2SO (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) or an equivalent volume of Me2SO. Cells were then stimulated with rhTPO (250 ng/ml; equivalent to using 25 ng/ml mouse TPO, given the species difference) for 10 min. At the completion of the stimulation, ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline was added and a cell lysate was prepared by Triton X solubilization as previously described (8Drachman J.G. Griffin J.D. Kaushansky K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4979-4982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Protein/DC assay (Bio-Rad). For each sample, 25 μg of total protein was denatured by boiling for 10 min in loading buffer containing 50 μl/ml β-mercaptoethanol and separated on a 7.5% NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis minigel (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with Tris-buffered saline (pH 8.0) containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) and 5% nonfat dry milk. The membrane was then incubated overnight at 4 °C in TBST with 5% milk and a 1:2000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for Akt phosphorylated at Ser473 (New England Biolabs). After three 10-min washes in TBST, the membrane was incubated in TBST with 5% milk containing a 1:3000 dilution of secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit, Bio-Rad) for 1 h at room temperature. After three 10 min washes in TBST, the membrane was incubated with chemiluminescent reagents (Lumiglo, New England Biolabs) and exposed to film. After exposure, the antibodies were stripped from the membrane by washing in 62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% NaDodSO4, and 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol at 55 °C for 30 min. The blots were then washed with TBST, reblocked, and reprobed using a 1:2000 dilution of polyclonal rabbit antibody recognizing all forms of Akt (New England Biolabs), in order to verify equal loading. Unsynchronized BaF3/Mpl cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline to remove growth factor and serum and starved for 6 h in RPMI/0.5% BSA. Cells were preincubated for 30 min with 16 μmLY294002 and then stimulated with or without 20 ng/ml rhTPO. Cells were cultured for an additional 16 h prior to assay. Primary MK progenitors were effectively starved of growth factors during the ∼8-h purification process and subsequently plated into fresh IMDM/10% fetal bovine serum containing 16 μm LY294002 or the equivalent volume of Me2SO, with or without 20 ng/ml rhTPO. Cells were incubated for an additional 12 h prior to assay. At the time of assay, cell cultures were divided into two aliquots. The first aliquot was assayed for apoptotic cells using either Annexin V or Apotag (both obtained from Pharmingen). For Annexin V assays, cells incubated in Annexin V binding buffer (10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2) with 0.2 μl/ml Annexin V conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Pharmingen) for 15 min. The cells were then fixed in 80% ethanol at −20 °C. Annexin V specifically binds to phosphatidylserines externalized on apoptotic cells. For Apotag assays, cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 20 min on ice and then stored in 80% EtOH at −20 °C for at least 40 min, followed by incubation with terminal deoxynucleotide transferase and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dUTP per the manufacturer's directions. This reaction labels the double stranded DNA breaks characteristic of apoptotic cells. The second aliquot was pulsed for 30 min with 10 μm BrdUrd (supplied in BrdUrd Flow Kit, Pharmingen), and the cells were fixed and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody per the manufacturer's directions. BrdUrd is incorporated by the nuclei of cells actively synthesizing DNA. Cells labeled by these procedures were resuspended in solution containing 20 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) and 60 μl/ml DNase-free RNase for labeling of total DNA and analysis by flow cytometry. Cells were analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer. Data were analyzed by Student's two-tailedt test for paired values. Activation of PI3K leads to the phosphorylation and activation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt, and thus the phosphorylation state of Akt serves as a marker for PI3K activity. In order to assess whether exposure of BaF3/Mpl cells and primary MKs to TPO results in activation of PI3K, we assayed phosphorylation of Akt. BaF3/Mpl cells were starved in serum-free, growth factor-free medium for 6 h in order to allow for maximum dephosphorylation of cellular proteins. Cells were then preincubated with a 0 (Me2SO only), 8, or 16 μm PI3K inhibitor LY294002 in Me2SO. After 30 min, the cells were stimulated with rhTPO for 10 min, and whole cell protein lysates were prepared. Lysates were analyzed by Western blotting, using an antibody that is specific for the activated form of Akt that has been phosphorylated on Ser473. Blots were then reprobed with an antibody that recognizes all forms of Akt to verify equal loading. Although very little Akt was phosphorylated in unstimulated cells, treatment with TPO induced phosphorylation of Akt within 10 min. TPO-induced Akt phosphorylation was significantly reduced by preincubation with the specific PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Fig.1 A), confirming that phosphorylation of Akt was PI3K-dependent. Similar experiments were performed using primary MKs; because the numbers of purified MK progenitors that can be obtained are limiting, mature MKs were used for this assay. Whole murine bone marrow cultures were incubated with recombinant mouse TPO for 3 days, and mature MKs were purified on a discontinuous albumin gradient. These cells were starved in serum-free, growth factor-free medium for 6 h; pretreated with 0, 8, or 16 μm LY294002 for 30 min; and then stimulated for 10 min with rhTPO. Lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting as described above. Treatment with TPO again induced phosphorylation of Akt within 10 min; phosphorylation was inhibited by pretreatment with LY294002 (Fig. 1 B). Thus, both in a Mpl-bearing cell line and in primary MKs, TPO induced activation of PI3K, which led to the phosphorylation of Akt. Because TPO stimulation resulted in the activation of PI3K, we next determined whether PI3K activity was important for cell cycling in response to TPO. In order to determine the optimal timing to determine the impact of LY294002 on TPO-induced cell cycling, a series of time course experiments were performed. We determined that after starvation, BaF3/Mpl cells required 12 h to enter the G1/S transition in response to stimulation by TPO and had obtained maximal numbers of cells in S phase at about 16 h, whereas cells cultured for longer than 24 h in the presence of LY294002 showed significant apoptosis (data not shown). Therefore, BaF3/Mpl cells were washed of growth factor and serum, starved for 6 h in RPMI containing 0.5% BSA, and then pretreated with 16 μmLY294002 or Me2SO. At 16 h, cells were split into 2 aliquots and assayed in parallel for BrdUrd uptake and Apotag positivity as measures of cell cycling and viability. Apotag was chosen as a measure of apoptosis that would also yield information regarding DNA content and would be comparable in BaF3/Mpl cells and in MKs. Phosphatidylserine can be externalized in activated MKs, so there is a risk that it may not be specific for apoptosis in these cells. Fig.2 shows flow cytometry results from a representative experiment of three performed. In the absence of LY294002, TPO induced brisk BrdUrd uptake compared with cells cultured without TPO (31% versus 3%; p = 0.007). In the presence of LY294002, TPO-induced cell cycling was significantly inhibited, with only 12% of cells showing BrdUrd uptake (p = 0.044 with and without LY294002). Notably, at this time point, TPO-induced cell survival was not significantly impaired by LY294002 (5% of cells were Apotag-positive, compared with 1% with TPO alone; p = 0.42). From PI staining, it was determined that the majority of the BaF3/Mpl cells treated with LY294002 and TPO had a 2N DNA content (81% of surviving cells treated with TPO+LY294002 in G1 compared with 57% of cells treated with TPO alone;p = 0.002; Fig. 3). The DNA content of Apotag-positive cells did not demonstrate any survival bias for G1 cells (data not shown). Therefore in BaF3/Mpl cells, inhibition of PI3K blocks TPO-induced cell cycling in G1, and this is not secondary to decreased TPO-induced cell survival, as it can be observed at a time when nearly all of the cells are viable. This suggests that TPO signals to the cell cycle machinery by a pathway involving PI3K that is separate from the PI3K-dependent pathway signaling cell survival.Figure 3Inhibition of PI3K leads to G1arrest in TPO-treated BaF3/Mpl cells. BaF3/Mpl cells were starved of serum and growth factors and then cultured either without TPO or with TPO in the absence or presence of LY294002 for 16 h. Cells were then fixed and resuspended with PI to stain DNA and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell cycle histograms were generated, and gates were configured manually to determine the percentage of cells in G1, S, and G2/M phases based on DNA content. Data shown are compiled from seven independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to determine the importance of PI3K activity for TPO-induced cell survival and cell cycling in primary cells, we performed similar assays in MK progenitors. MK progenitors were chosen for analysis instead of mature MKs in order to examine TPO responses in cells of low ploidy classes, as cells in higher ploidy classes normally stop cycling and undergo physiologic apoptosis. Because MKs can undergo both mitotic and endomitotic cell cycling, which may be regulated differently, we sorted our starting population into 2N (mitotic) and 4N (potentially endomitotic) cells to more easily trace their progression in the cell cycle. CD41-positive cells were isolated from mouse marrow by lineage depletion and FACS and were sorted in to 2N and 4N populations based on Hoechst staining. Negative selection for Gr-1 improves ploidy distribution by excluding MKs with adherent neutrophils (62Carow C.E. Fox N.E. Kaushansky K. J. Cell Physiol. 2001; 188: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Diploid and 4N CD41+ cells were cultured in IMDM/10%FCS with 10 ng/ml rhTPO and 16 μm LY294002 or Me2SO for 12 h. Cells were assayed for BrdUrd uptake Apotag positivity, as described above for BaF3/Mpl cells. Fig. 4 shows flow cytometry results from a representative experiment (n = 3). TPO promoted both mitotic and endomitotic cell cycling in 2N and 4N MK progenitors respectively, which was significantly inhibited in the presence of LY294002. LY294002-treated cells showed little TPO-induced BrdUrd uptake in cells either progressing from 2N to 4N or from 4N to 8N. Staining for DNA content with PI additionally showed that the majority of 2N MKs remained as 2N (i.e. in G1), as seen in the BaF3/Mpl cells, whereas the majority of the 4N MKs remained as 4N, implying both a G1 and a G2/M block. Simultaneous assays for Apotag (Fig. 5) showed that the majority of the MK progenitors were viable, although the frequency of Apotag positive cells was greater in MKs than in BaF3/Mpl cells, whether they were treated with TPO alone or with TPO and LY294002. In addition, 4N MKs appeared to be more susceptible to LY294002-induced apoptosis than were 2N MKs, although this difference was not significant. Therefore, TPO induces PI3K-dependent signals that are important for cell cycling both in a TPO-responsive cell line and in primary MK progenitors, resulting in a G1 arrest in both cell types and possibly a G2/M arrest in MKs.Figure 5LY294002 leads to inhibition of TPO-induced cell cycling and survival in MK progenitors. CD41+ mouse marrow MKs were sorted into 2N and 4N populations based on Hoechst staining. Cells were then cultured without TPO or with TPO in the absence or presence of LY294002 for 12 h. Cells were then processed either for BrdUrd uptake or for Apotag staining as described under “Materials and Methods,” resuspended with PI, and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Using our experimental conditions, we did not see any effect of LY294002 on TPO-induced ERK phosphorylation (data not shown). In order to demonstrate that the effects of LY294002 were due to inhibition of PI3K, we stably transfected BaF3/Mpl cells to express a form of Akt that is constitutively active by virtue of the addition of a myristylation site that confers PI3K-independent association with the plasma membrane. We then starved these cells (MyrAktMpl) along with their parent BaF3/Mpl cells and cultured them for 16 h without TPO, with TPO, or with TPO and 16 μm LY294002. We then assayed for BrdUrd uptake and Annexin positivity as measures of cell cycling and apoptosis. In the absence of TPO, MyrAktMpl cells had only marginally improved survival and BrdUrd uptake compared with the parent cells, and in the presence of TPO, their survival and BrdUrd uptake was equivalent to that of the parent cell line. However, MyrAktMpl cells cultured with TPO and LY294002 showed no impairment of cell cycling compared with the parent cell line, the BrdUrd uptake of which had decreased by at least half (Fig.6 A, flow cytometry results of a representative experiment on MyrAktMpl cells; Fig. 6 B,summary of three experiments comparing MyrAktMpl cells and parental BaF3/Mpl cells). Thus, active Akt seems to be necessary but not sufficient for TPO-indu"
https://openalex.org/W1977995867,"Extracellular fibrinogen-binding protein (Efb) secreted by Staphylococcus aureus has previously been shown to contribute to pathogenesis in a rat wound infection model. Also antibodies against Efb exhibited a protective effect in a mouse mastitis model. The interaction between Efb and fibrinogen is divalent, with one binding site within the N-terminal repeat region in Efb and one at the C terminus. In this study we show that the distal D domain of fibrinogen contains at least one of the binding domains recognized by Efb. Efb stimulates fibrinogen binding to ADP-activated platelets. Furthermore, Efb inhibits ADP-induced, fibrinogen-dependent platelet aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner. This implies that Efb modifies platelet function by amplifying a non-functional interaction between fibrinogen and platelets. Efb recognizes the A alpha-chain of the D fragment of fibrinogen. The RGD sequence on the A alpha-chain is located close to the region recognized by Efb and contains a putative binding site for the platelet integrin GPIIb/IIIa receptor complex involved in platelet aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W2077801970,"Activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and its downstream target Akt are essential for the fibroblast transformation induced by many viral products. Tax, encoded by human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), has been demonstrated to induce the transformation of rat fibroblast Rat-1 cell through NF-kappaB activation. By stable transfection of Rat-1 cells with expressing constructs of Tax and its mutant M47, which is defective in HTLV-I LTR transactivation, we selected their transformed clones, which have characteristics of NF-kappaB activation and colony formation beyond the cell monolayer (a malignant phenotype). However, these two characteristics in the transformed clones of Tax and M47 disappear after these cells have been treated with wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of PI3K. Further, increased activity of the PI3K/Akt is observed in the transformed clones of Tax and M47 as compared to the clones of empty vector Neo and the M148, which is defective in NF-kappaB activation and cell transformation. Increased activity of PI5K is present in the transformed clones of both Tax and M47 and in the M148 clone as compared to that in the Neo cell. It is known that the efficiency of Tax-induced cell transformation is not high; a minority of Tax-expressing clones show transformation, although the majority of Tax-expressing clones show activated NF-kappaB. A Tax-expressing, nontransformed clone after transfection with an active form of the catalytic subunit of PI3K, p110alpha, becomes transformed. Consistent with these results, a Tax highly-expressing human T-cell line MT2 exhibits both higher polyphosphoinositide turnover and higher activities of PI3K and PI5K than those of Jurkat or MT1 and HTLV-I-negative and a Tax-unexpressing cell line, respectively. These results demonstrate that the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, excepting for the NF-kappaB, is also required for the cell transformation induced by Tax."

This reaction is catalyzed by 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenases (11-cis-RDHs), prior to the chromophore rejoining with the visual pigment apo-proteins. The RDH5 gene encodes a dehydrogenase that is responsible for the majority of RDH activity. In humans, mutations in this gene are associated with fundus albipunctatus, a disease expressed by delayed dark adaptation of both cones and rods. In this report, an animal model for this disease,11-cis-rdh−/− mice, was used to investigate the flow of retinoids after a bleach, and microsomal membranes from the retinal pigment epithelium of these mice were employed to characterize remaining enzymatic activities oxidizing 11-cis-retinol. Lack of 11-cis-RDH leads to an accumulation ofcis-retinoids, particularly 13-cis-isomers. The analysis of 11-cis-rdh−/− mice showed that the RDH(s) responsible for the production of 11-cis-retinal displays NADP-dependent specificity toward 9-cis- and 11-cis-retinal but not 13-cis-retinal.

Those enzymes are involved in redox reactions of such hydrophobic substances as steroids, retinoids, and prostaglandins (13Jornvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J.

They are often found as a dimer or tetramer and usually contain hydrophobic N-terminal tails thought to be involved in membrane anchoring. 11-cis-RDH is largely found associated with smooth endoplasmic reticulum, although some amount has also been found in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (15Mata N.L.

The stereospecificity of 11-cis-RDH has been shown to bepro-S-specific to both 11-cis-retinol and NADH (18Jang G.F. McBee J.K. Alekseev A.M. Haeseleer F. Palczewski K. J. Biol.

Mutations in theRDH5 gene have been found in patients with fundus albipunctatus, a disease characterized by profound delayed dark adaptation of cone and rod cells after a strong bleach (20Yamamoto H.

Despite some of these mutations in the RDH5 gene resulting in inactive enzyme, patients harboring null mutations ultimately recover their visual pigments. Therefore, 11-cis-retinal must be produced by alternative dehydrogenase-catalyzed oxidation of 11-cis-retinol that compensates for the loss of RDH5 (18Jang G.F. McBee J.K. Alekseev A.M. Haeseleer F.

In accord with these results, transgenic mice missing theRDH5 gene also display delayed dark adaptation, but only at very high bleach levels (23Driessen C.A. Winkens H.J. Hoffmann K. Kuhlmann L.D.

The molecular characterization of this other dehydrogenase(s), however, has not yet been carried out. A remarkable phenotype of 11-cis-rdh−/− mice is the accumulation of 11-cis-retinol/13-cis-retinol and 11-cis-retinyl/13-cis-retinyl esters. This has led to the suggestion that 11-cis-RDH could also be important in eliminating 13-cis-retinoids from the RPE (23Driessen C.A. Winkens H.J. Hoffmann K. Kuhlmann L.D. Janssen B.P. Van Vugt A.H.

Due to this wide expression, it has been hypothesized to catalyze the oxidation of 9-cis-retinol in tissues in which 11-cis-retinoids are not present. It is also worth noting that the expression levels are much lower in these tissues compared with the RPE, yet 11-cis-RDH has not been detected by immunocytochemistry in cells of the retina other than RPE using both polyclonal (22Cideciyan A.V.

Palczewski, unpublished data. 2K. Palczewski, unpublished data. antibodies. This observation, in conjunction with the fundus albipunctatus phenotype, suggests that the 11-cis-RDH present in the RPE is involved in the production of 11-cis-retinal for both rod and cone cells. 11-cis-RDH could be also important for the photochemical production of 11-cis-retinal from all-trans-retinal by the retinal G protein-coupled receptor (RGR) of RPE and Müller cells (28Tao L. Shen D. Pandey S. Hao W. Rich K.A. Fong H.K. Mol. Vis. 1998; 4: 25PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hao W. Chen P. Fong H.K. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 413-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Chem. 2001; 276: 21098-21104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) have shown that 11-cis-RDH co-purifies with RGR. The possible role 11-cis-RDH plays in this complex could be the reduction of 11-cis-retinal to 11-cis-retinol, which is stored in a form of 11-cis-retinyl esters.In this study, we investigated the effects of age and light conditions on 11-cis- and 13-cis-retinoid accumulations in11-cis-rdh−/− mice. We then evaluated the flow of retinoids in the eyes of these mice after an intense bleach. Isolated RPE membranes from 11-cis-rdh−/− mice were used to investigate the presence of an alternative oxidation enzyme(s), stereospecificity and isomeric retinoid preference, and the effect of the lack of 11-cis-RDH on the isomerization reaction. These studies revealed potential mechanisms by which 13-cis-retinol is produced and provide an extensive characterization of an alternative dehydrogenase enzyme responsible for 11-cis-retinal production. The production of 11-cis-retinal allows the regeneration of visual pigments in the vertebrate retina (1Okada T. Ernst O.P. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Trends Biochem.

Therefore, 11-cis-retinal must be produced by alternative dehydrogenase-catalyzed oxidation of 11-cis-retinol that compensates for the loss of RDH5 (18Jang G.F. McBee J.K. Alekseev A.M. Haeseleer F.

The molecular characterization of this other dehydrogenase(s), however, has not yet been carried out. A remarkable phenotype of 11-cis-rdh−/− mice is the accumulation of 11-cis-retinol/13-cis-retinol and 11-cis-retinyl/13-cis-retinyl esters. This has led to the suggestion that 11-cis-RDH could also be important in eliminating 13-cis-retinoids from the RPE (23Driessen C.A. Winkens H.J. Hoffmann K. Kuhlmann L.D. Janssen B.P. Van Vugt A.H.

Due to this wide expression, it has been hypothesized to catalyze the oxidation of 9-cis-retinol in tissues in which 11-cis-retinoids are not present. It is also worth noting that the expression levels are much lower in these tissues compared with the RPE, yet 11-cis-RDH has not been detected by immunocytochemistry in cells of the retina other than RPE using both polyclonal (22Cideciyan A.V. Haeseleer F. Fariss R.N. Aleman T.S. Jang G.F. Verlinde C.L. Marmor M.F. Jacobson S.G. Palczewski K. Visual Neurosci. 2000; 17: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and monoclonal 2K.

This observation, in conjunction with the fundus albipunctatus phenotype, suggests that the 11-cis-RDH present in the RPE is involved in the production of 11-cis-retinal for both rod and cone cells. 11-cis-RDH could be also important for the photochemical production of 11-cis-retinal from all-trans-retinal by the retinal G protein-coupled receptor (RGR) of RPE and Müller cells (28Tao L. Shen D. Pandey S. Hao W. Rich K.A. Fong H.K. Mol. Vis. 1998; 4: 25PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hao W. Chen P. Fong H.K. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 413-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

The possible role 11-cis-RDH plays in this complex could be the reduction of 11-cis-retinal to 11-cis-retinol, which is stored in a form of 11-cis-retinyl esters. In this study, we investigated the effects of age and light conditions on 11-cis- and 13-cis-retinoid accumulations in11-cis-rdh−/− mice. We then evaluated the flow of retinoids in the eyes of these mice after an intense bleach. Isolated RPE membranes from 11-cis-rdh−/− mice were used to investigate the presence of an alternative oxidation enzyme(s), stereospecificity and isomeric retinoid preference, and the effect of the lack of 11-cis-RDH on the isomerization reaction. These studies revealed potential mechanisms by which 13-cis-retinol is produced and provide an extensive characterization of an alternative dehydrogenase enzyme responsible for 11-cis-retinal production.

Different proteins and polypeptides can acquire the abnormal conformational changes that lead to amyloid formation, and at least 19 different proteins are now known to be involved in the generation of amyloid in vivo (1Westermark P. Araki S. Benson M.D. Cohen A.S. Frangione B. Masters C.L. Saraiva M.J. Sipe J.D. Husby G. Kyle R.A. Selkoe D. Amyloid. 1999; 6: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the case of dialysis-related amyloidosis the protein involved is β2-microglobulin (β2m),1which aggregates as amyloid fibrils in joints and tissues in ∼20% of patients with kidney failure within 2 years after the onset of hemodialysis treatment (2Jadoul M.

This type of amyloidosis does not seem to require a mutated, processed, or chemically modified precursor protein. Although the cause of the abnormal folding in vivois unknown, it has been reported recently that β2m can be induced to generate amyloid fibrils in vitro at low pH and high salt conditions (3McParland V.J.

Bray P. Vucelic D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8906-8915Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), i.e. it is a one-chain all β-protein with two antiparallel pleated sheets of β-strands linked together by a disulfide bridge (15Becker J.W. Reeke G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4225-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It is structurally homologous to constant domains of immunoglobulins (14Okon M. Bray P. Vucelic D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8906-8915Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In chronic renal failure β2m serum concentrations may increase 10–70 times despite dialysis, but there is no simple relationship between β2m serum concentrations and the extent of amyloidosis (16Gejyo F. Homma N. Suzuki Y. Arakawa M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 314: 585-586Google Scholar). The native protein can be cleaved C-terminally to Lys58 by activated complement component C1s to generate a variant β2m called Lys58-β2m. In serum the new C-terminal Lys58 residue is subsequently removed by a carboxypeptidase B-like activity (17Nissen M.H. Roepstorff P. Thim L. Dunbar B. Fothergill J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This β2m variant has been demonstrated in blood from different types of patients including patients in chronic hemodialysis treatment (18Ozasa H. Suzuki T. Ota K. Nephron. 1989; 53: 87Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), but it is unsettled how and if this variant contributes to β2m amyloid formation. The Lys58-β2m molecule is a two-chain disulfide-linked heterodimer, whereas the wild-type β2m is a monomer with an internal disulfide bridge. We here report that Lys58-β2m readily attains two conformations that are in equilibrium in aqueous solvents at neutral pH and that a distinct conformational intermediate also of wild-type β2m is present in acetonitrile and trifluoroethanol (TFE) at neutral pH. The relationship between the native and intermediate β2m conformations is characterized by capillary electrophoresis (CE). Affinity CE using Congo red (CR) and 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid (ANS) together with circular dichroism (CD) and refolding studies support the notion that conformational heterogeneity is induced by acetonitrile or TFE and that the intermediate folding structure has an increased binding to amyloid-specific probes. Monoclonal IgG antibodies against β2m, BBM.1 and L368, were from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). A marker peptide (M), acetyl-Pro-Ser-Lys-Asp-OH, was synthesized by Schafer-N (Copenhagen, Denmark). β2-microglobulin was purified from a pool of urine from uremic patients as described previously (19Nissen M.H. Thim L. Christensen M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and β2m cleaved at Lys58 was also prepared as reported before (20Nissen M.H. Johansen B. Bjerrum O.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 205: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was estimated using a bicinchoninic acid assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The β2m preparations only showed one band each at approximatelyM r = 15,000 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Mass spectrometry on an electrospray ionization/time-of-flight instrument (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) only showed the expected average molecular weight of 11,729 and an oxidation product with a mass addition of 16. The purified proteins at 5–10 mg/ml in PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, and 6.5 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.4) were kept at −20 °C. Far-UV CD analysis was performed on a Jasco model J-715 spectropolarimeter. Spectra (185–260 nm) were collected at a final β2m concentration of 0.5 mg/ml (43 µm) in PBS diluted 10-fold with water. The spectra were obtained in acetonitrile or TFE concentrations ranging from 0 to 50% by volume. The instrument was calibrated with (+)-camphor-10-sulfonic acid, and a 0.01-cm path length was used. After subtraction of the appropriate buffer blanks, the CD is expressed as Δε (m−1 cm−1) normalized to the molar concentration of peptide bond. The CD spectra were analyzed for secondary structures as described (21Johnson W.C. Proteins. 1999; 35: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). β2m samples (74 or 250 µg/ml, 6 or 21 µm) in 30–100× dilute PBS with 50% acetonitrile, 15% TFE, water or 50 mm sodium acetate/50 mm glycine, pH 4.4, with 400 mm NaCl were incubated at 37 °C for 72 h and then mixed with CR in solution as described (22Klunk W.E. Jacob R.F. Mason R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 285-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The final CR concentration was 17.7 µm. Absorption spectra (300–700 nm) were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1601 double-beam spectrophotometer. CE was performed on a Beckman P/ACE 2050 equipped with sample cooling. Conditions were as follows unless noted otherwise. The electrophoresis buffer was 0.1m phosphate, pH 7.4, and detection was at 200 nm. A 50-µm internal diameter uncoated fused silica capillary with 50 cm to the detector and of 57 cm total length was used. Separations were carried out at various field strengths with the anode at the sample injection end. The capillary was thermostated at 15 °C unless specified otherwise. Samples (10–20 µl) were usually kept at 15 °C and were protected against evaporation by a layer of mineral oil. The capillary was rinsed after electrophoresis for 1 min with 0.1 m NaOH, water, and electrophoresis buffer with or without added ligand (CR or ANS). This was followed by a 0.1-min rinse with plain electrophoresis buffer from a separate vial to minimize carry-over of electrophoresis buffer additives. The β2m samples (typically 0.17–1.70 mg/ml diluted in water from 5–10 mg/ml stock solutions in PBS) were pressure-injected into the capillary. Under the given conditions, the injected sample volumes were ∼0.9 nl/s. A peptide marker (M) normally was included in the sample. The samples were injected after a 2-s injection of water to minimize carry over of electrophoresis buffer into the sample. Electrophoresis took place from buffer vials that were not used for any washing/prerinse steps. Wild type and Lys58-β2m were separated by CE under native buffer conditions. Although wild-type β2m appeared as a single peak (Fig.1A), the analysis of Lys58-β2m showed two distinct peaks (Fig.1 B) that we designated fast (f) and slow (s). This heterogeneity was also observed for the form of cleaved Lys58-β2m, in which Lys58 is removed (des-Lys58-β2m, data not shown). After preadsorption with protein G-Sepharose-immobilized monoclonal anti-β2m antibodies (BBM.1 and L368), the two peaks of Lys58-β2m as well as the wild-type β2m peak were selectively removed from the CE profile (results not shown). Both wild-type β2m and Lys58-β2m contained oxidized molecules that were readily separated from nonmodified molecules by reversed-phase HPLC and subsequently identified by mass spectrometry (23Heegaard N.H.H. Sen J.W. Nissen M.H. J. Chromatogr. A. 2000; 894: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the heterogeneity of Lys58-β2m as detected by CE (Fig. 1 B) was not caused by the separation of oxidized from nonoxidized β2m, because the same heterogeneous profile was observed when the oxidized and nonoxidized peaks were isolated by HPLC and then analyzed separately by CE (results not shown). Also, wild-type β2m showed a single peak (Fig.1 A) despite containing 25–30% oxidized species (23Heegaard N.H.H. Sen J.W. Nissen M.H. J. Chromatogr. A. 2000; 894: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, we suggest that the two peaks of Lys58-β2m are caused by conformational heterogeneity. Because the slow peak of Lys58-β2m increased after exposure to organic solvent (e.g. after HPLC purification), we investigated the influence of acetonitrile and trifluoroethanol on wild-type β2m. As shown in Fig. 2, both TFE and acetonitrile induced the appearance of a slower peak (β2ms) and decreased the area of the native peak (β2mf), i.e. the same pattern as seen for Lys58-β2m. The secondary structure of β2m treated with acetonitrile and TFE was assessed by CD (Fig. 3). Secondary structural elements were estimated on the basis of the deconvolution approach outlined in Ref. 21Johnson W.C. Proteins. 1999; 35: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar (TableI). Approximately 50% of the native protein is involved in β-sheet formation and practically none in α-helices according to the CD measurements. Even though it is not possible to quantitatively correct for the presence of a mixture of wild-type and solvent-induced β2m species in the deconvolution of the CD spectra, it is clear from the data that the predominant β-structure of the native protein is partly lost, and helix structures are gained in both acetonitrile and TFE, most strikingly in TFE (Fig. 3 B and Table I). A transition point above which the structure changes considerably lies around 35% TFE and between 40 and 50% acetonitrile. The validity of the structural algorithm is supported by the close agreement of the crystallography data of bovine β2m (Table I) with the structure inferred from the CD measurements of native β2m.Table ISecondary structure of native β2m and β2m in 50% TFE or acetonitrile based on CD resultsα-helix3/10 helixExtended ββ-turnPolyproline like helixOtherNative β2m0.010.010.360.110.080.44X-ray β2m1-aStructural elements are based on X-ray crystallography of bovine β2-microglobulin (PDB ID code 1BMG).0.000.000.410.080.080.42Native + 50% TFE0.400.110.030.140.050.29Native + 50% MeCN0.070.060.170.170.080.451-a Structural elements are based on X-ray crystallography of bovine β2-microglobulin (PDB ID code 1BMG). Open table in a new tab The generation of the two wild-type β2m conformations was characterized further by CE. In the experiments of Fig.4, advantage is taken of the fact that the solvent and the β2m molecules have a different electrophoretic mobility. TFE has the lowest electrophoretic mobility (and accordingly is swept faster through the capillary by the electroosmotic flow). It is thus mixed electrophoretically on-line with β2m when the TFE plug is injected after the β2m plug. It is seen that increasing concentrations of TFE in a given plug length induce more and more of the β2ms form (Fig. 4,B–D). Under the given experimental conditions and disregarding diffusion and stacking effects, it can be estimated that the contact time for the analyte and solvent zone is ∼30 s,i.e. the average TFE contact time for β2m molecules was 15 s in these experiments. In another set of experiments it could be shown that more of the β2ms conformation was present when equilibrating the sample at increasing temperatures at a given TFE or acetonitrile concentration (Fig. 5). At a given TFE concentration the ratio between the fast and slow species was found to be constant and independent on the β2m concentration in the range of 0.1–0.6 mg/ml (data not shown). To further support the presence of a distinct conformational change in acetonitrile and TFE we used the hydrophobic dye ANS as an electrophoresis buffer additive (Fig.6A). ANS binds to the solvent-exposed hydrophobic surfaces that are found in partially unfolded proteins (24Mulqueen P.M. Kronman M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 215: 28-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). CE can readily be used to screen for ANS binding to the β2mf and β2ms species because ANS is a sulfonated molecule, and separations by CE are very sensitive to changes in analyte charge/mass ratios (25Gao J. Mammen M. Whitesides G.M. Science. 1996; 272: 535-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). As indicated by the results of Fig.6 A, ANS associates primarily with β2ms because this peak changes migration time as well as peak area with increasing ANS concentrations, whereas β2mf is largely unaffected. We could also show that the β2ms form bound more strongly to CR both with the sample in acetonitrile (23Heegaard N.H.H. Sen J.W. Nissen M.H. J. Chromatogr. A. 2000; 894: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and in TFE (Fig. 6 B). The analysis benefits from the fact that the electrophoresis removes the analyte from the solvent in which CR has a low solubility and does this with a speed that allows us to observe the β2m structured intermediate before it refolds. Interactions with the double-sulfonated CR dye lead to shifts to longer peak appearance times and decreased peak areas proportionally to the CR concentration. These effects are specific and detectable down to sub-micromolar CR concentrations. At the highest CR concentrations the appearance time of the native β2mf peak also begins to shift, because the native β2m also has an affinity, albeit considerably lower, for this dye (23Heegaard N.H.H. Sen J.W. Nissen M.H. J. Chromatogr. A. 2000; 894: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The results supported the existence of an equilibrium between two conformations of β2m in samples with TFE or acetonitrile. Because the electrophoresis is carried out in 0.1 m phosphate, pH 7.4, and the organics are removed from the sample at the onset of electrophoresis, we investigated whether refolding takes place in the electrophoresis buffer by running the analyses at different field strengths. This allows the analytes to spend more or less time in the nondenaturing electrophoresis buffer before they reach the detector (Fig. 7). The experiments indicate that the conformational transitions are reversible, because the double peak profile in both acetonitrile (Fig.7, A–C) and TFE (Fig. 7 D) gradually reverts to only one peak as the peak appearance time shifts from less than 8 min to more than 30 min. The refolding rate was sensitive to the ionic strength (Fig. 7 D), i.e. the refolding proceeded faster at lower ionic strength as it did with higher capillary temperature (data not shown). β2m samples in organic solvent were left at room temperature for 1–2 weeks, and the amount of soluble protein was monitored by CE that only consumes a few nanoliters of sample in each run. In β2m treated with TFE (data not shown) as well as with acetonitrile (Fig.8), the amount of soluble protein relative to the internal marker decreased over time. After 9 days, less than 25% of the original sample remained in solution. The ratio between the fast and slow species during this long-term incubation remained steady. It was not possible to detect a red shift in the absorbance spectrum of CR added to the aged solution according to the procedure of Klunk et al. (22Klunk W.E. Jacob R.F. Mason R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 285-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) despite the finding of a spectral shift in a control fibril solution of β2m at low pH and high salt (3McParland V.J. Kad N.M. Kalverda A.P. Brown A. Kirwin-Jones P. Hunter M.G. Sunde M. Radford S.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8735-8746Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Lys58-β2m is a two-chain disulfide-linked heterodimer, whereas wild-type β2m is a monomer with an internal disulfide bridge. Lys58-β2m is not conformationally constrained around the Lys58 residue (which is part of a very rigid loop from Phe56 to Phe62 (14Okon M. Bray P. Vucelic D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8906-8915Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)) and appears to readily adopt two conformations in neutral aqueous buffer as indicated by the CE experiments. Separations by CE mainly depend on the charge-to-mass ratio of a protein analyte, but hydrodynamic volume, shape, and local ionization equilibria (all conformationally sensitive) also influence migration (26Grossman P.D. Colburn J.C. Lauer H.K. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Accordingly, CE has been used to study conformational isomers of peptides (27Moore Jr., A.W. Jorgenson J.W. Anal. Chem. 1995; 67: 3464-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and proteins (28Hilser V.J. Freire E. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 465-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 29Verzola B. Chiti F. Manao G. Righetti P.G. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 282: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although it is possible that Lys58 cleavage may precede precipitation in vivo, the major part of β2m that forms amyloid is composed of wild-type protein because only one N terminus is found upon sequencing β2m-amyloid (30Campistol J.M. Bernard D. Papastoitsis G. Sole M. Kasirsky J. Skinner M. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 1262-1267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We therefore characterized the folding of wild-type β2m and found that a conformational equilibrium can be induced by treatment with organic solvent. TFE is a solvent that diminishes native tertiary interaction and induces partly folded states of polypeptides by favoring internal hydrogen bonds and disrupting hydrophobic interactions (31Gast K. Zirwer D. Muller-Frohne M. Damaschun G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It promotes α-helix formation in some amyloid polypeptides and stabilizes partially folded proteins that may eventually form amyloid (10Chiti F. Webster P. Taddei N. Clark A. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3590-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar, 32Thomas P.D. Dill K.A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 2050-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The CE approach allowed us to examine the effect of transferring β2m kept in organic solvent and dilute neutral buffer into the 0.1 m phosphate, pH 7.4, electrophoresis buffer. By mixing β2m and TFE on-line we show that TFE-mediated transition to the β2ms form occurs within seconds. The electrophoretic/electroosmotic separation removes the β2m from the TFE or acetonitrile, and accordingly, the equilibrium shifts back to that normally predominated by the native species with time constants that depend on the capillary buffer composition and temperature. The starting distribution of folding species directly depends on the concentration of organics and the temperature in the sample and involve monomeric species as indicated by the constant ratio between the two forms at different total protein concentrations. By running the analyses at different speeds, the refolding kinetics could be shown to be on the order of several minutes. The speed of the analyses also made it possible to probe the two analyte species for the binding of ANS, a negatively charged hydrophobic dye that binds to hydrophobic patches in proteins in molten globule states (33Brockwell D.J. Smith D.A. Radford S.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The outcome supports the notion that the β2ms form may represent a partially structured β2m conformation. Also, the amyloid indicator dye, CR, which structurally resembles an ANS dimer, was used as a buffer additive in the CE analyses and preferentially bound to the TFE and acetonitrile-induced β2ms folding variant (23Heegaard N.H.H. Sen J.W. Nissen M.H. J. Chromatogr. A. 2000; 894: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The binding was detectable at sub-micromolar CR concentrations. Migration-shift CE experiments in many cases lend themselves to binding constant estimates (34Heegaard N.H.H. Harding S.E. Chowdhry B.Z. Protein-Ligand Interactions: Hydrodynamics and Calorimetry. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2001: 171-195Google Scholar), and we recently reported the use of dye affinity CE to evaluate the CR affinity of β2m and β2m in acetonitrile (23Heegaard N.H.H. Sen J.W. Nissen M.H. J. Chromatogr. A. 2000; 894: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but no binding constants for the dye-protein interaction could be estimated reliably. One important reason for this is that in addition to the putative CR-β2ms binding equilibrium, the conformational equilibrium between β2mf and β2ms also shifts during electrophoresis, in which the protein is separated from the organic solvent. About 20 different precursor proteins are now known to form amyloidin vivo despite being of widely different sizes and having no obvious sequence similarities (1Westermark P. Araki S. Benson M.D. Cohen A.S. Frangione B. Masters C.L. Saraiva M.J. Sipe J.D. Husby G. Kyle R.A. Selkoe D. Amyloid. 1999; 6: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In a number of cases, amyloid fibril formation from these disease-associated proteins has been shown to be initiated in vitro under conditions that stabilize partially unfolded soluble intermediates of the native proteins (3McParland V.J. Kad N.M. Kalverda A.P. Brown A. Kirwin-Jones P. Hunter M.G. Sunde M. Radford S.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8735-8746Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 5Lashuel H.A. Lai Z. Kelly J.W.

Namba K. Yutani K. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). A growing list of additional proteins and peptides, including de novo designed synthetic proteins without known amyloid disease association, may also form amyloid fibrils in vitro under similar conditions (10Chiti F. Webster P. Taddei N. Clark A. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3590-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar, 12Lim A. Makhov A.M. Bond J. Inouye H.

Proteins. 2000; 39: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 38Fandrich M. Fletcher M.A. Dobson C.M. Nature. 2001; 410: 165-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Amyloid fibrils consist of stable and insoluble assemblies of proteins in stacked β-sheets (39Rochet J.C. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). These structures bind CR in a specific orientation that results in a diagnostic red shift in the absorption spectrum and an enhanced birefringence and dichroism in polarized light (40Ladewig P. Nature. 1945; 156: 81-82Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although a β-pleated sheet peptide backbone alone is not sufficient to form the optimal structure for CR binding (41Klunk W.E. Pettegrew J.W. Abraham D.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), it was shown for mutated transthyretin that soluble protofilaments bound CR, whereas actual fibril formation required manipulations of pH and/or ionic strength (5Lashuel H.A. Lai Z. Kelly J.W. Biochem. 1998; 37: 17851-17864Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This agrees with the results of the present study, in which it was not possible to demonstrate a change in the absorbance spectrum of CR incubated with the solvent-treated β2m samples even though an increased CR affinity of the β2ms variant was indicated clearly by the affinity CE experiments. The results together with the outcome of far-UV circular dichroism measurements support the conclusion that β2m in 40–50% acetonitrile and 25–35% TFE forms a partially structured intermediate or a distinctly different conformation that binds CR more strongly than the native form and precipitates out of solution over time. Transient intermediates of proteins with less β-structure and more α-helix have also been found in other studies of amyloid disease-related and unrelated proteins (10Chiti F. Webster P. Taddei N. Clark A. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3590-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar, 36Goda S. Takano K. Yamagata Y. Nagata R. Akutsu H. Maki S.

Proteins. 2000; 39: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 42Walsh D.M. Hartley D.M. Kusumoto Y. Fezoui Y. Condron M.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Selkoe D.J. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25945-25952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that a defined α-helix content in partially structured intermediates may favor the further transition to β-sheets and amyloid fibrillation (39Rochet J.C. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar, 43Kayed R. Bernhagen J. Greenfield N. Sweimeh K. Brunner H. Voelter W. Kapurniotu A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Although overt fibrillation in most cases requires acidic pH, high salt, and/or a high polypeptide concentration in vitro, we here characterize early and reversible folding events at neutral pH. It is not clear from the experimental data presented here that the observed structural intermediate is an early event on the pathway to β2m amyloid and thus a model for dialysis-related amyloidosis, but it may be suggested that β2m amyloid formation depends on a combination of a sustained increase in serum β2m concentration and changes in molecular conformation. The present results suggest that it is possible to separate the native form from an early folding intermediate of a pre-amyloid protein before fibrillation occurs. The approach facilitates the investigation of folding pathways that lead to pathologic polypeptide conformations and thus should also aid in the identification of a possible means of inhibiting such processes.

https://openalex.org/W2074163964,"Activation of MAP kinase leads to the activation of p53-dependent pathways, and vice-versa. Although the amount of p53 protein increases in response to MAP kinase-dependent signaling, the basis of this increase is not yet fully understood. We have isolated the mutant cell line AP14, defective in p53 expression, from human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, which have an activated ras allele. The expression of p53 mRNA and protein is approximately 10-fold lower in AP14 cells than in the parental cells. The high constitutive phosphorylation and activities of the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 in HT1080 cells are greatly reduced in AP14 cells, although the levels of these proteins are unchanged, suggesting that the defect in the mutant cells affects the steady-state phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2. Overexpression of ERK2 in AP14 cells restored both MAP kinase activity and p53 expression, and incubation of the mutant cells with the phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate resulted in strong coordinate elevation of MAP kinase activity and p53 expression. The levels of expression of the p53-regulated gene p21 parallel those of p53 throughout, showing that basal p21 expression depends on p53. The levels of p53 mRNA increased by 5-8-fold when activated ras was introduced into wild-type cells, and the levels of the p53 and p21 proteins decreased substantially in wild-type cells treated with the MEK inhibitor U0216. We conclude that MAP kinase-dependent pathways help to regulate p53 levels by regulating the expression of p53 mRNA."

To investigate leukemic transformation of these embryonic hematopoietic progenitors, we infected differentiating cultures of ES cells with the Chronic Myeloid Leukemia-specific BCR/ABL oncoprotein. Following a period of liquid culture, we isolated two transformed subclones, EB57 and EB67, that retained characteristics of embryonic hematopoietic progenitors and induced a fatal leukemia in mice characterized by massive splenomegaly and granulocytosis. Histopathology of the spleen revealed an abundance of undifferentiated blast-like cells. Investigation of the clonal origins of the granulocytes in the peripheral blood demonstrated that the injected donor cells contributed modestly to the granulocyte population while the majority were host-derived. EB57 secretes IL-3 and unidentified cytokines that can stimulate autocrine and paracrine cell proliferation, presumably accounting for the reactive granulocytosis in diseased mice. These BCR/ABL transformed hematopoietic derivatives of ES cells recapitulate the relationship of BCR/ABL expression to IL-3 production that has been described for primitive hematopoietic progenitors from human CML patients, and illustrates the potential for autocrine and paracrine effects of BCR/ABL-infected cells in murine models."

https://openalex.org/W2034711864,"Telomerase activation is crucial in human carcinogenesis. The limiting component of telomerase, the catalytic subunit (hTERT), is undetectable in normal somatic cells but present in most tumor cells, including the earliest stages of colon carcinoma. The mechanisms involved in the differential expression in normal and tumor cells are not understood. In normal cells hTERT expression is shut down by a repressor, and upregulation could be a consequence of cis-acting changes in the hTERT gene, making it resistant to repression. We have identified a polymorphic and a monomorphic minisatellite in the second intron of the hTERT gene, and polymorphic one in intron 6. The polymorphic minisatellite in intron 2 contains binding sites for c-Myc, which has been shown to upregulate hTERT transcription. Screening colon carcinoma DNAs for rearrangements of hTERT minisatellites we detected no changes in 33 samples from tumors, most of which express hTERT. This indicates that size rearrangements of the hTERT minisatellites are not required for telomerase expression in colon carcinomas. Minor changes and one LOH were seen in five tumors."
