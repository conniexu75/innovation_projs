https://openalex.org/W1631595783,"A new metabolite of arachidonic acid, 5-D-(S),12-D-(R)-dihydroxy-6,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid, was found upon incubation of the fatty acid with a suspension of rabbit peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes collected 4 h after injection of glycogen into the peritoneal cavity. The yield of the dihydroxy acid was 0.5 to 2%. The compound possesses three conjugated double bonds and was found to be stereochemically pure at C-5 and C-12. Incubation of the cells with 8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid did not lead to the formation of the analogous triunsaturated dihydroxy acid."

The movement of newly synthesized proteoglycans from inside the cells into the extracellular matrix and, finally, into the culture medium was examined by measuring the distribution of 35S-labeled proteoglycans in the medium, a 4 M guanidine HCl extract of the cell layer, and in the remaining residue for a number of chase times following a 5-min pulse with [35S]sulfate. When hyaluronate oligosaccharides containing greater than or equal to 10 monosaccharides were included in the chase media, a proportion of newly synthesized proteoglycans were displaced from the matrix (4 M extract) into the culture medium. This displacement was greatest when oligomers were in the chase media between 10 and 20 min after the pulse, approximately the time when the molecules are being secreted from the cells. The proportion of link-stabilized aggregate in the medium was examined by Sepharose 2B chromatography after adding an excess of unlabeled monomer which displaces labeled monomer from complexes with hyaluronate which are not link-stabilized. The proportion of link-stabilized aggregate increased from 12% to about 70% between 12 and 120 min of chase. The presence of 40 micron hyaluronate oligosaccharides of 16 monosaccharides in the chase media retarded but did not prevent aggregate formation. Oligomers of about 50 monosaccharides, which are large enough to bind both a monomer proteoglycan and a link protein, almost completely prevented the formation of the large link-stabilized aggregates. The results suggest: (a) newly synthesized proteoglycans are not bound into link-stabilized aggregates at the time of secretion; (b) hyaluronic acid oligomers which are long enough to interact only with the hyaluronic acid-binding site of proteoglycans will retard but not prevent link-stabilized aggregation; and (c) hyaluronic acid oligomers long enough to accommodate additionally a link protein form a link-stabilized ternary complex and prevent aggregation with larger hyaluronic acid molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2123552699,"1,1‘-Carbonyldiimidazole, a carbonylating reagent, has been shown to be suitable for the activation of cross-linked agaroses for affinity chromatography. The activated matrix (an imidazolyl carbamate) is relatively stable to hydrolysis but smoothly reacts with N-nucleophiles such as those present in either affinity chromatography ligands or leashes, e.g. ethylenediamine or 6-aminohexanoic acid. If butylamine was attached via the 1,1‘-carbonyldiimidazole method, the resulting product was devoid of charged groups and thus had the same titration curve as agarose. The suitability of this new matrix for affinity chromatography was demonstrated by the successful purification of trypsin by several different systems."

https://openalex.org/W1581960434,"One-dimensional and two-dimensional peptide-mapping techniques are used to identify the protein which gives rise to the 72,000 dalton alpha-chymotryptic fragment previously shown to be the membrane attachment site for spectrin. Peptide maps of the 72,000 dalton fragment are very different from maps of Bands 1, 2, 2.9, 3, 3.1, 4.1, and 4.2 and very similar to maps of the apparently closely homologous polypeptides, Bands 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.6. Limited proteolysis of erythrocyte membranes is shown to generate Band 3', another polypeptide which has been associated with spectrin-binding activity. Peptide maps of Band 3' are very similar to maps of Band 2.1, suggesting that Band 3' is also a proteolytic fragment of Band 2.1. It is concluded that Band 2.1 and possibly some or all of the other, related polypeptides which electrophorese in the 2 region is (are) the spectrin-binding protein(s) of the human erythrocyte."
https://openalex.org/W1628170781,"A simple two-dimensional electrophoretic method for peptide mapping of heterogeneous protein samples is presented. The reduced and denatured proteins of the mixture are separated in a first dimension by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis. After completion of the electrophoresis, the whole gel lane is equilibrated in stacking gel buffer and is transferred at right angles onto a second slab gel. A protease solution is overlayed on the gel lane and a partial proteolysis of the proteins to be analyzed is performed during the stacking phase of the second electrophoresis. The second electrophoresis resolves the characteristic pattern of peptides of each individual protein as a series of spots located below the original position of the undigested protein. The peptide maps of the following samples are presented as examples: protein P23 and P23* of bacteriophage T4, membranes of Dictyostelium discoideum, membranes of human erythrocytes, and 35S-labeled proteins of D. discoideum synthesized in vivo or in a cell-free wheat germ extract. In complex samples, up to 20 individual proteins can be analyzed at once and a protein comprising only 1% of the total sample generates a clearly identifiable peptide pattern. Good reproducibility of the patterns obtained allows the comparison of samples of different origins."

https://openalex.org/W1628236543,"A preparation containing the link proteins may be obtained from bovine nasal cartilage by extraction with 4 M guanidine hydrochloride and by equilibrium density gradient centrifugations of the extract as commonly employed in the isolation of proteoglycan monomers. In the present paper, protein-rich proteoglycans have been removed from such a preparation to give purified link proteins by chromatography on Sepharose CL-6B in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The individual link proteins, which in order of increasing electrophoretic mobility are termed link proteins 1, 2, and 3, have been separated and isolated in a subsequent preparative gel electrophoresis step. The link proteins present in largest amount, link proteins 1 and 2, have essentially the same amino acid compositions, and following partial digestion with the V8 protease from Staphylococcus aureus and analytical electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate, their peptide patterns closely resemble each other. Therefore,it is probable that link proteins 1 and 2 are structurally similar. Link protein 1 contains more carbohydrate than link protein 2 (9.5% and 3.0%, respectively) and it is suggested that the major difference between them is in carbohydrate content."

https://openalex.org/W1514411721,"The rotational behavior of a set of n-(9-anthroyloxy) fatty acid fluorescent probes is examined in two liquid paraffins and in liposomes composed of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine. As has been observed with other membrane fluorescent probes (Hare, F., and Lussan, C. (1977) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 467, 262-272), the degree of fluorescence depolarization for a given solvent viscosity is dependent on the solvent standard employed. In addition, when the anthroyloxy group is in the terminal position of the acyl chain, it has more rotational freedom than when it is conjugated to positions 6, 9, or 12 where the rotational motion of the fluorophore is similar. When incorporated into lipid bilayers, values of fluorescence polarization reflect the gradient of fluidity which extends from the surface to the center of the membrane. The nature of this polarization gradient is discussed in relation to the intrinsic differences between the probes and the anisotropic rotations responsible for depolarization."
https://openalex.org/W1485552751,"Preparations of low molecular weight porcine heparin with an average specific anticoagulant activity of 94 units/mg were fractionated into and forms of the mucopolysaccharide of approximately 6000 daltons each. The fraction was further subdivided into various species with descending but significant affinities for the protease inhibitor as well as decreasing but substantial anticoagulatn potencies. Highly active heparin (approximately 8% of the low molecular weight pool) possesses a specific anticoagulant activity of 350 +/- 10 units/mg. The relatively inactive fraction (67% of the low molecular weight pool) exhibits a specific anticoagulant activity of 4 +/- 1 units/mg. The binding of highly heparin to antithrombin is accurately described by a single-site binding model with a KHep-ATDISS of approximately 1 X 10(-7) M. Variations in this binding parameter secondary to changes in environmental variables indicate that charge-charge interactions as well as an increase in entropy are critical to the formation of the highly heparin-antithrombin complex. The interaction of relatively inactive heparin with the protease inhibitor is characterized by an apparent KHep-ATDISS of 1 X 10(-4) M. In large measure, this is due to small amounts of residual mucopolysaccharide (0.5%). The ability of the highly heparin to accelerate the thrombin-antithrombin interaction was also examined. We were able to demonstrate that the mucopolysaccharide acts as a catalyst in this process and is able to initiate multiple rounds of enzyme-inhibitor complex formation. The rate of enzyme neutralization is increased to a maximum of 2300-fold as the concentration of heparin is raised until the inhibitor is saturated with mucopolysaccharide. Further increases in heparin concentration result in a reduction in the speed of enzyme neutralization. This appears to be due to the formation of thrombin-heparin complexes. A mathematical model is given which provides a relationship between the initial velocity of enzyme neutralization and reactant concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1601827412,"The AUG-dependent formation of an 80 S ribosomal initiation complex was studied using purified rabbit reticulocyte initiation factors radiolabeled by reductive methylation. The radiolabeled initiation factors were as biologically active as untreated factors. Reaction mixtures containing a variety of components (AUG, GTP, Met-tRNAf, initiation factors, and 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits) were incubated at 30 degrees C and then analyzed on linear sucrose gradients for the formation of ribosomal complexes. The results show that both eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-3 and the ternary complex (eIF-2.GTP.Met-tRNAf) bind independently to the 40 S subunit and each of these components enhances the binding of the other. All of the polypeptides of eIF-2 and eIF-3 participate in this binding. Formation of an 80 S ribosomal complex requires eIF-5 and 60 S subunits in a reaction that is stimulated by eIF-4C. Both eIF-2 and eIF-3 are released from the 40 S preinitiation complex during formation of the 80 S initiation complex. Release of eIF-2 and eIF-3 does not occur and 80 S ribosomal complexes are not formed if GTP is replaced by a nonhydrolyzable analog such as guanosine 5'-O3-(1,2-mu-imido)triphosphate. Despite a variety of attempts, it has not yet been possible to demonstrate binding of eIF-4C, eIF-4D, or eIF-5 to either 40 S or 80 S ribosomal complexes."

https://openalex.org/W1547011251,"Inactivation of rat renal phosphate-dependent glutaminase by 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine occurs only under conditions where the enzyme is catalytically active. The glutaminase activity and the rate of inactivation by the diazoketone exhibit very similar phosphate concentration-dependent activation profiles. Because of this phosphate dependency, it was not possible to differentiate an apparent protection by glutamine from the strong inhibition of inactivation caused by glutamate. The ability of glutamate to protect the glutaminase against inactivation is reversed by increasing concentrations of phosphate. The observed characteristics of inactivation by 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine differ considerably from those reported for the inactivation by L-2-amino-4-oxo-5-chloropentanoic acid. In addition, the presence of o-carbamoyl-L-serine was found to stimulate inactivation by 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine, but to protect the glutaminase against inactivation by the chloroketone. Preinactivation of the glutaminase by the diazoketone only slightly reduced the stoichiometry of binding of [5-14C]chloroketone. These observations suggest that 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine and L-2-amino-4-oxo-5-chloropentanoic acid interact with different sites on the glutaminase which are specific for binding glutamine and glutamate, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2151748867,"Horseradish peroxidase and chlorite, NaC102, are able to catalyze chlorination of monochlorodimedone to form dichlorodimedone. Catalytic amounts of horseradish peroxidase act to disproportionate chlorite forming chlorine dioxide and chloride ion. The chlorine dioxide thus formed is responsible for the chlorination of monochlorodimedone. It was previously thought (Chiang, R., Rand-Meir, T., Makino, R., and Hager, L. P. (1976) J. Biol. Chem 251, 6340-6346) that the initial transient intermediate formed between horseradish peroxidase and chlorite was a halogenating intermediate and was called Compound X. However, complete transient state spectra of the enzyme species formed directly from horseradish peroxidase with chlorite shows this intermediate to be Compound II. This result is the first recognized example of direct oxidation of native horseradish peroxidase to Compound II. The disproportionation of chlorite by horseradish peroxidase was investigated in the absence of a halogen acceptor. At pH 5.05, 5 mol of chlorite are disproportionated to 4 mol of chlorine dioxide and 1 mol of chloride ion. Chlorine dioxide yields are limited by the inactivation of the enzyme by chlorine dioxide. A maximum yield of 2.5 x lo3 nmol of chlorine dioxide/nmol of horseradish peroxidase was obtained by optimizing the pH and optimizing the enzyme/chlorite ratio. Titration of horseradish peroxidase with chlorite showed a 1:l molar stoichiometry for the formation of Compound I. The reaction between the enzyme and excess chlorite failed to produce measurable quantities of hydrogen peroxide. The reaction of chlorine dioxide with monochlorodimedone was also studied in the absence of horseradish peroxidase and chlorite. Chlorine dioxide and monochlorodimedone react with a 1:l molar stoichiometry to form 1 mol of protons, 0.4 mol of dichlorodimedone, and 0.6 mol of chlorite."
https://openalex.org/W190447404,"The activity of glycogen phosphorylase is controlled by two nucleotide sites. We have found that organic solvents affect the regulatory properties of phosphorylase by altering the binding at these two sites. At the activator site, the Ka for AMP is lowered 10-fold in the presence of 10% 1,2-dimethoxyethane while, at the inhibitor site, the Ki for caffeine is increased 6-fold. The stimulation of activity by organic solvents is highly dependent on the enzyme's activity state. Phosphorylase b, which has a requirement for a nucleotide activator, loses this requirement in the presence of organic solvents, while the active form of the enzyme, phosphorylase a, is only slightly stimulated by organic solvents. The activation profile obtained with rabbit liver phosphorylase suggests that differences in the properties of this enzyme from rabbit muscle phosphorylase might be explained by a change in the relative affinity for AMP at the two nucleotide sites. The results also suggest that 1,2-dimethoxyethane may be useful to determine accurately the activities of different forms of liver phosphorylase."
https://openalex.org/W1646847750,"A procedure was developed to purify the Streptococcus faecium ATCC 12755 L-alpha-glycerophosphate oxidase. The molecular weight of the purified enzyme was 131,000 and the subunit molecular weight was 72,000. Two moles of FAD were bound/mol of enzyme. Apo-L-alpha-glycerophosphate oxidase displayed physical properties similar to the holoenzyme as judged by electrophoresis in 10% buffer gels at pH 8.5 and by centrifugation in a 5 to 20% linear sucrose gradient. The apoenzyme was completely reactivated by incubation with FAD. L-alpha-Glycerophosphate oxidase was specific for L-alpha-glycerophosphate when compared with several other pohsphorylated glycerol and sugar derivatives. Oxygen was the preferred electron acceptor. At 10 mM DL-alpha-glycerophosphate (below the Km of 26 mM for L-alpha-glycerophosphate), activity was increased from 2.6- to 10-fold by increasing the buffer concentration from 0.01 to 0.1 m. This buffer effect was observed with potassium phosphate and other anionic buffers. In 0.001 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, activity was increased by several divalent metal ions, including 10 mM CaCl2 (7.7-fold activation) and 10 mM MgCl, (6.8-fold activation). Fructose 6-phosphate and fructose1-phosphate were inhibitors of the L-alpha-glycerophosphate oxidase."

Columns with non-IgE proteins were used to remove cell constituents adhering nonselectively to protein-conjugated Sepha- rose and columns with IgE were used to specifically bind the receptor. Initially, attempts to elute receptor from IgE columns resulted in major losses of binding activity. Analysis of 3H radioactivity using polyacryl- amide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-PAGE) also showed that the receptor was still heavily contaminated. These contaminants were not labeled with “‘1 or 14C, indicating the desirability of utilizing an endogenous protein label when the purifi- cation of plasma membrane proteins is studied.

https://openalex.org/W1598902074,"A consistent pattern of insulin-like properties is expressed by a variety of glycoside inhibitors of concanavalin A (Con A), and is suggestive of a common mechanism of action to explain these effects. Various exogenously added glycoside derivatives inhibit the binding of insulin-Sepharose beads to insulin receptors on isolated intact rat fat cells with a specificity resembling that for Con A-Sepharose binding to these cells. A more limited number of glycosides tested were also found to inhibit the binding of 125I-insulin, although some enhancement of binding that preceded the inhibition was observed for some of these saccharides. The glycosides also antagonize insulin-stimulated glucose utilization by the cells, but in some cases also mimic the hormone by stimulating glucose utilization. A few glycosides mimic insulin without appearing to antagonize its bioactivity. Radiolabeled glycoside inhibitors fail to bind to insulin in equilibrium dialysis experiments although they readily bind to Con A, indicating that the glycosides act directly on the cell rather than on the insulin molecule. The latter observation is consistent with the ability of those glycosides that act like insulin to do so independent of the hormone. In view of the known insulin-like properties of Con A, the effects of the glycosides seen in the present study suggest roles for a membrane carbohydrate and a carbohydrate binding site in the mechanisms of action of both insulin and Con A. In addition to various alternative explanations, a working hypothesis is presented to rationalize the present observations. It proposes that the effects of the exogenously added glycosides (and Con A) may reflect the presence on the membrane of a native carbohydrate moiety by either mimicking or competitively inhibiting its ability to interact reversibly with a lectin-like carbohydrate binding site associated with the function of the insulin receptor.20"

https://openalex.org/W1569924666,"By isolation of a mixed disulfide product of glutathione and cysteine, glutathione peroxidase was shown to be highly specific for only one donor substrate. Using the coupled assay of NADPH and yeast glutatione reductase, which is highly specific for flutathione disulfide, it was shown that the apparent inhibition of glutathione peroxidase by mercaptoethanol can be described kinetically and that it is competitive with glutathione. Also, when limiting amounts of hydroperoxide were present in the reaction mixture with mercaptoethanol or cysteine, the total amount of glutathione disulfide produced decreased as compared with that in a reaction mixture without mercaptoethanol or cysteine. This finding is consistent with enzymatic formation of mixed disulfides. Data presented suggest that the selenium in glutathione peroxidase was oxidized to a seleninic acid in the absence of glutathione. These results can be explained by a mechanism for glutathione peroxidase wherein the selenium atom is the only atom in the enzyme that undergoes oxidation reduction."

While substantial agglutination activity is present in cell lysates, this activity is consistently lost upon affinity purification of discoidin. The lack of agglutination activity is not due to a mutational event or a nutritional deficiency. The carbohydrate binding site of the protein is functional, and dissociation of the oligomeric protein into subunits has not occurred. The addition of aqueous dispersions of a CHCl3/CH3OH extract of a slime-mold particulate fraction to the purified discoidin reconstitutes agglutination activity in a concentration-dependent manner. The reconstituted agglutination activity has the specificity of discoidin's carbohydrate binding sites. The reconstitutive ability of the CHCl3/CH3OH extract is due to a lipid component. Treatments of the lipid extract and fractionation of the active species suggest that it may be unsaturated fatty acid. Of many purified lipids tested, only high concentrations of cisvaccenic acid (C18:1 delta11) or oleic acid (C18:1 delta9) significantly reconstituted agglutination activity."

The apparent Km for cytidine in this reaction is about 80 to 90 mM which is more than 10(4) greater than the Km values for the natural substrates, tRNA lacking the terminal AMP (tRNA-C-C) and tRNA lacking the terminal pCpA (tRNA-C). The Vmax values for the model reaction are only 5% and 2% of those for the reaction with the natural tRNA substrates. Addition of the tRNA fragments, tRNA lacking the terminal XpCpCpA sequence (tRNA-(X - 1)p) and tRNA lacking the terminal CpCpA (tRNA-Xp), greatly stimulates the rate of nucleotide incorporation into cytidine. In the case of CMP incorporation into cytidine, tRNA-Xp stimulates the reaction about 60-fold, to a rate similar to that of the normal reaction with tRNA-C. The tRNA fragment has no effect on the apparent Km of either cytidine or CTP, but only alters the Vmax of the reaction. Stimulation of the model reactions is maximal with tRNA fragments of specific chain lengths.

Saturation reassociation of isolated middle repetitive DNA or the whole rat genome, of various fragment lengths, with an excess of bound DNA indicates 5% or less of the rat genome is complementary with the driver DNA. This finding confirms the previous observations that a subset of the repetitive sequences is concentrated by NHP-DNA interactions (Sevall, J. S., Cockburn, A., Savage, M., and Bonner, J. (1975) Biochemistry 14,782-789). Increasing the DNA fragment length to 3400 nucleotides enhanced the amount of NHP-retained DNA. Reassociation of sheared bound 3400 nucleotide-DNA resulted in two kinetic components, the slower component being nonrepetitive and the fast component being repetitive. The repetitive sequences displayed reassociation kinetics identical with those of the NHPbound 350-nucleotide fragments. The NHP-bound nonrepetitive component was 10% of the whole single copy sequence complexity. Rat liver polysomal RNA-driven hybridization of the protein-bound nonrepetitive component had a 4to 5-fold increase in complementary DNA fragments when compared with the whole rat genome nonrepetitive sequences even though this represents only 10% of the total genome."
