https://openalex.org/W1997828975,"Ankyrin repeats are an amino-acid motif believed to function in protein recognition; they are present in tandem copies in diverse proteins in nearly all phyla1. Ankyrin repeats contain antiparallel α-helices that can stack to form a superhelical spiral2. Visual inspection of the extrapolated structure of 24 ankyrin-R repeats2 indicates the possibility of spring-like behaviour of the putative superhelix. Moreover, stacks of 17–29 ankyrin repeats in the cytoplasmic domains of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels have been identified as candidates for a spring that gates mechanoreceptors in hair cells as well as in Drosophila bristles3,4,5. Here we report that tandem ankyrin repeats exhibit tertiary-structure-based elasticity and behave as a linear and fully reversible spring in single-molecule measurements by atomic force microscopy. We also observe an unexpected ability of unfolded repeats to generate force during refolding, and report the first direct measurement of the refolding force of a protein domain. Thus, we show that one of the most common amino-acid motifs has spring properties that could be important in mechanotransduction and in the design of nanodevices."

However, a large number of parameters that are essential for the development of these models are still missing and need to be set arbitrarily. Here, we aimed at collecting these missing parameters using fluorescent probes. First, the levels of the signaling molecules were quantitated. Second, to monitor both the activation and nuclear translocation of ERK, we developed probes based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Third, the dissociation constants of Ras·Raf, Raf·MEK, and MEK·ERK complexes were estimated using a fluorescent tag that can be highlighted very rapidly. Finally, the same fluorescent tag was used to measure the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling rates of ERK and MEK. Using these parameters, we developed a kinetic simulation model consisting of the minimum essential members of the Ras/ERK MAPK cascade. This simple model reproduced essential features of the observed activation and nuclear translocation of ERK. In this model, the concentration of Raf significantly affected the levels of phospho-MEK and phospho-ERK upon stimulation. This prediction was confirmed experimentally by decreasing the level of Raf using the small interfering RNA technique. This observation verified the usefulness of the parameters collected in this study.

MAPK cascade has been highly conserved throughout evolution and plays a pivotal role in many aspects of cellular events, including proliferation, differentiation, and survival (reviewed in Refs. 1Sturgill T.W.

The principal components of this Ras/ERK MAPK cascade include H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras, c-Raf, B-Raf, A-Raf, MEK1, MEK2, ERK1, and ERK2. In addition to these, a number of proteins regulate this signaling pathway either positively or negatively: A few examples include phosphatases and scaffold proteins that have been shown to play critical roles in the spatiotemporal regulation of ERK MAPK (reviewed in Refs. 6O'Neill E.

Furthermore, there are many positive and negative feedback loops that modulate the activity of each signaling component, rendering this signal transduction cascade ever more complicated. To comprehend the Ras/ERK MAPK cascade, many research groups have attempted to reconstruct this cascade in silico (10Markevich N.I. Hoek J.B. Kholodenko B.N. J.

These systems analyses are used to propose mechanisms to explain the ultra-sensitivity of ERK to the input signal (18Huang C.Y. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10078-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar), the stable response of the Ras/ERK signaling cascade to a wide range of epidermal growth factor (EGF) concentrations (15Schoeberl B. Eichler-Jonsson C. Gilles E.D. Muller G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar), and the different responses of PC12 pheo-chromocytoma cells upon stimulation by EGF or nerve growth factor (17Sasagawa S. Ozaki Y. Fujita K. Kuroda S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Each kinetic simulation model reported previously recapitulates the stimulus-induced ERK activation very nicely. Nevertheless, the parameters used therein are sometimes astonishingly different from each other. One apparent reason for this discrepancy is that many studies set parameters to fit experimental data using different algorithms (11Yamada S. Taketomi T. Yoshimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 314: 1113-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 12Hatakeyama M. Kimura S. Naka T. Kawasaki T. Yumoto N. Ichikawa M. Kim J.H. Saito K. Saeki M. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S.

Another reason may be ascribed to the fact that most parameters are derived from in vitro experiments: the parameters obtained in vitro might vary significantly depending on each experimental condition. In any event, the remarkable differences in the parameters used in each model clearly show that some aspects of the Ras/ERK MAPK cascade can be reproduced in silico, even when the model is based on non-physiological parameters. Recent advances in fluorescent protein technology have accelerated the trend to study protein dynamics in living cells. For example, the development of probes based on the principle of Förster/fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) has enabled us to monitor activity changes in enzymes, protein-protein interactions, and distribution of phospholipids in living cells (reviewed in Refs. 19Pollok B.A. Heim R.

Furthermore, a technique called “fluorescence recovery after photobleaching” in combination with fluorescent proteins is proving to be useful in characterizing the diffusion of proteins within the cells (reviewed in Refs. 26Lippincott-Schwartz J. Patterson G.H. Science. 2003; 300: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, 27Reits E.A. Neefjes J.J. Nat.

More recently, Ando et al. (29Ando R. Mizuno H. Miyawaki A. Science. 2004; 306: 1370-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) reported a fluorescent protein with the unique property of being able to be repeatedly highlighted and erased. This protein, named Dronpa, has been shown to be an extremely versatile tool for monitoring rapid protein dynamics such as the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of ERK. The aim of this study was to collect and evaluate the parameters for the development of a kinetic simulation model for Ras/ERK MAPK cascades. We prepared a FRET-based probe for ERK and Dronpa-tagged probes for Raf, MEK, and ERK. Using the parameters collected using these probes, we developed a kinetic simulation model consisting of the minimum number of signaling molecules. Even though this model lacks many important components and feedback loops that are known to regulate the Ras/ERK MAPK cascade, it could reproduce the essential features of the activation and nuclear translocation of ERK observed using FRET-based probes, verifying the usefulness of the collected parameters. FRET Probes—The FRET probes for ERK (named Miu2 for MAPK indicator unit ERK2) were constructed essentially as described previously (30Terai K. Matsuda M. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). From the N terminus, Miu2 comprised the following: yellow fluorescent protein (YFP; amino acids 1-239), a spacer (Leu-Asp), Xenopus ERK2, a spacer (Gly-Gly-Arg), and cyan fluorescence protein (CFP; amino acids 1-237). Full-length and mutant cDNAs of Xenopus ERK2 (amino acids 1-362) were all amplified by PCR-based methods, followed by sequence verification. Ala was substituted for both Thr188 and Tyr190 in Miu2-TAYA. Arg was substituted for Lys57 in Miu2-KR. Plasmids—cDNAs of wild-type Xenopus MEK1 and mutants were generated by PCR-based methods and subcloned into pCAGGS-FLAG. Ser was substituted for Lys97 in the MEK-KS mutant. Ala was substituted for both Ser218 and Ser222 in the MEK-SASA mutant. Asp and Glu were substituted for Ser218 and Ser222, respectively, in the MEK-SDSE mutant. pCAGGS-FLAG-H-RasV12 and pCAGGS-3HA-m1CFP-c-Raf-S621A-pm have been reported previously (30Terai K. Matsuda M. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For visualization of recombinant proteins, we used monomeric versions of YFP, CFP, and red fluorescent protein (RFP) (31Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar, 32Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7877-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar) or Dronpa, a fluorescent protein that can be highlighted by photoactivation (29Ando R. Mizuno H. Miyawaki A. Science. 2004; 306: 1370-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The plasmids fused to these fluorescent proteins were pCXN2-m1CFP-ERK2, pCAGGS-FLAG-ERK2-m1CFP, pCAGGS-FLAG-c-Raf-m1YFP, pCAGGS-FLAG-MEK1-m1YFP, pCAGGS-FLAG-ERK2-m1YFP, pCAGGS-FLAG-MEK1WT-mRFP-pm, pCAGGS-Dronpa-c-Raf, pCAGGS-FLAG-MEK1-Dronpa, and pCAGGS-FLAG-ERK2-Dronpa. Cells—HeLa cells were purchased from the Human Science Research Resources Bank (Sennan-shi, Japan). The COS-7 cells used in this study were COS-7/E3, a subclone of COS-7 cells established by Y. Fukui (University of Tokyo). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. 293F cells were purchased from Invitrogen and maintained according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cell imaging was performed in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 (Invitrogen). Reagents—Inhibitors against the EGF receptor and MEK (AG1468 and U0126, respectively) were purchased from Calbiochem. EGF was purchased from Sigma. Rabbit anti-green fluorescent protein serum was developed in our laboratory (33Ohba Y. Kurokawa K. Matsuda M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 859-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies M2 and M5 were purchased from Sigma. Anti-phospho-c-Raf (Ser338) monoclonal antibody, anti-c-Raf polyclonal antibody, anti-phospho-p44/42 ERK (Thr202/Tyr204) monoclonal antibody, anti-phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser217/Ser221) polyclonal antibody, anti-MEK1/2 polyclonal antibody, and anti-p44/42 ERK polyclonal antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody PY20, anti-c-Raf-1 monoclonal antibody, and anti-MEK1 monoclonal antibody were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories. Immunoblotting was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Small interfering RNA for human c-Raf was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology and introduced into HeLa cells according to the manufacturer's protocol. Imaging with Intramolecular FRET Probes—HeLa cells expressing the Miu2 probes were imaged every 30 s using an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope equipped with a cooled CCD CoolSNAP HQ camera (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ) and controlled by MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA) as described previously (30Terai K. Matsuda M. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For the dual-emission ratio imaging of the probe, we used a 440AF21 excitation filter, a 455DRLP dichroic mirror, and two emission filters (480AF30 for CFP and 535AF26 for YFP) (Omega Optical, Inc., Brattleboro, VT). After background subtraction, the ratio image of YFP/CFP was created with MetaMorph software, and the results were used to represent the level of FRET. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis of Intermolecular FRET Probes—293F cells expressing the fluorescent proteins were analyzed with a FACSAria (BD Biosciences) in FreeStyle 293 expression medium (Invitrogen) as described previously (34Kawai T. Sato S. Ishii K.J. Coban C. Hemmi H. Yamamoto M. Terai K. Matsuda M. Inoue J.I. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Fluorescence from the cells was analyzed using the following sets of laser lines and filters: a 407-nm laser and a 480AF30 emission filter for the CFP intensity, a 407-nm laser and a 535AF26 emission filter for the sensitized FRET intensity, a 488-nm laser and a 535AF26 emission filter for the YFP intensity, and a 488-nm laser and a 610BP10 emission filter (Omega Optical, Inc.) for dsFP595. Corrected FRET (cFRET) values were obtained using the following equation: cFRET = FRET - 0.5·CFP - 0.02·YFP. Imaging with Intermolecular FRET Probes—Imaging with intermolecular FRET probes was as described previously (30Terai K. Matsuda M. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 35Sorkin A. McClure M. Huang F. Carter R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1395-1398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Briefly, a pair of proteins fused to YFP and CFP was expressed in HeLa cells. CFP, FRET, and YFP images were obtained using the following pairs of excitation and emission filters, respectively: MX0420 (Asahi Spectra Co., Tokyo, Japan)/BP470-490 (Olympus Corp.), MX0420/535DF35 (Omega Optical, Inc.), and 510DF23/560DF15 (Omega Optical, Inc.). An XF2052 dichroic mirror (Omega Optical, Inc.) was used throughout the experiments. Exposure times were 200 ms for CFP and FRET images and 50 ms for YFP images. Under this condition, corrected FRET (cFRET) values were obtained by the following equation: cFRET = FRET - 0.34·CFP - 0.075·YFP. Quantitation of Endogenous Ras, Raf, MEK, and ERK—The protein concentrations of the endogenous Ras, Raf, MEK, and ERK proteins in HeLa cells were determined using glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused recombinant proteins as standards. GST-fused Ras was prepared in our laboratory (36Ohba Y. Mochizuki N. Yamashita S. Chan A.M. Schrader J.W. Hattori S. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20020-20026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). GST-c-Raf (truncated), GST-MEK1, and GST-ERK2 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The concentrations of these GST fusion proteins were verified by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Total cell lysates were prepared by the addition of SDS sample buffer directly to the culture dishes. Serial dilutions of total cell lysates and GST-fused recombinant proteins were applied to the same SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with specific antibodies. Bound antibodies were detected using the ECL chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and quantitated with an LAS-1000 image analyzer (Fujifilm). Calibration curves were obtained from the luminescence intensities of the standards and were used to quantitate the endogenous proteins. In some experiments, we also used FLAG-tagged proteins as standards. Calculation of the Fraction of Phosphorylated Miu2—The fraction of phosphorylated Miu2 was calculated as follows. Total cell lysates of Miu2-expressing cells were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with anti-ERK antibody. The intensities of slower migrating phosphorylated ERK2 (IpERK/αERK) and total Miu2 (IMiu/αERK), including both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms, were quantitated as described above. The same filter was reprobed with anti-phospho-ERK antibody, followed by measurement of the intensities of phosphorylated ERK2 (IpERK/αpERK) and phosphorylated Miu2 (IpMiu/αpERK). The fraction of phosphorylated Miu2 (F) was obtained using the following equation: F = (IpMiu/αpERK/IMiu/αERK)·(IpERK/αERK/IpERK/αpERK). Morphometric Analysis—HeLa and COS-7 cells expressing RFP fused to a nuclear localization signal were trypsinized, suspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and observed under an inverted microscope. Thirty cells for each were imaged for differential interference contrast and fluorescence to measure the diameters of cells and nuclei, respectively. The volumes of cells and nuclei were calculated assuming that they were spheres. The nuclear and cytoplasmic volumes of HeLa cells were 0.22 and 0.94 pl, respectively. Those of COS-7 were 0.14 and 2.4 pl, respectively. Nucleocytoplasmic Shuttling Analysis—Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the Dronpa-tagged proteins was analyzed essentially as described previously (29Ando R. Mizuno H. Miyawaki A. Science. 2004; 306: 1370-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The cells expressing Dronpa-fused proteins were observed under an Olympus FluoView FV500 confocal microscope equipped with an argon laser and a diode laser (405 nm). The fluorescence of Dronpa was erased at 488 nm for 20 s (20% laser power), followed by its photoactivation at the predetermined region by excitation at 405 nm for 400 ms (10% laser power). A decrease in the fluorescence of Dronpa at the predetermined region was monitored by weak excitation (1% laser power) at 488 nm using a BA505IF band-pass filter. The nuclear export rate was calculated from the initial decrease rate of the fluorescence. Here, we defined the export rate as the fraction exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm/s. After the time-lapse experiment, Dronpa was highlighted in the whole cell area, and its fluorescence images were obtained by Z-sectioning to create a stacked image. Using the stacked image, the ratio of the molecules of nuclear Dronpa and cytoplasmic Dronpa was calculated. Numerical Simulation of Biochemical Reactions and Block Diagram—All reactions including nucleocytoplasmic shuttling were represented by molecule-molecule interactions and enzymatic reactions. All steps are considered as taking place in either the cytosolic or nuclear compartment. GENESIS simulator (version 8.0) with a Kinetikit interface was used for solving the ordinary differential equations with a time step of 100 ms as described previously (14Bhalla U.S. Iyengar R. Science. 1999; 283: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar, 17Sasagawa S. Ozaki Y. Fujita K. Kuroda S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The GENESIS script of our in silico model is provided as supplemental material. Quantitation of Components of the ERK Signaling Cascade in HeLa Cells—Because molecule numbers used as parameters differ considerably among simulation models, we started our study by quantitating the concentrations of H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras, c-Raf, MEK1, MEK2, ERK1, and ERK2 in the HeLa and COS-7 cells used in this study. The concentrations of these proteins were determined using either GST- or FLAG-tagged proteins as standards (supplemental Figs. 1 and 2). The volumes for the whole cells and nuclei were calculated from the diameters of the suspended cells. These volumes were used to obtain the concentrations of the signaling molecules in the nucleus and cytoplasm (supplemental Table 1). The results are summarized in Table 1 with reference to previous reports. The concentrations of Ras, MEK, and ERK were in the range of 0.1-3 μm, whereas the concentration of Raf was as little as 0.013 μm.TABLE 1Concentrations of Ras, Raf, MEK, and ERKThis studyHuang and Ferrell (18Huang C.Y.

Open table in a new tab Development of a Probe for ERK2 Binding to MEK—Next, we developed a FRET-based probe for ERK to monitor its spatiotemporal regulation. The Miu2 probe comprised YFP, ERK2, and CFP from the N terminus (Fig. 1A). In the solved structure of ERK2, the N terminus is located in close proximity to the N terminus. Therefore, this probe is designed to detect global conformational changes in ERK2 that will alter the distance and orientation between the N and C termini. We first examined the effect of MEK on the distribution and FRET efficiency of the probe. The probe accumulated in the nucleus when expressed alone, but was excluded from the nucleus in the presence of MEK (Fig. 1B). This subcellular distribution demonstrated that MEK anchored the probe in the cytoplasm as efficiently as authentic ERK. The fluorescence intensities of YFP and CFP obtained from a whole cell region were used to evaluate FRET level in the probe-expressing cells. As shown in Fig. 1C, the FRET efficiency of the wild-type Miu2 probe was increased in the presence of MEK, suggesting that the conformational change induced by MEK binding increased the FRET level. Amino acid substitutions of the MEK phosphorylation sites of ERK (Thr188 and Tyr190)in the Miu2-TAYA mutant or the lysine residue critical for the kinase activity (Lys57) in the Miu2-KR mutant did not affect the FRET level in either the absence or presence of MEK. We could not coexpress the wild-type probe with constitutively active MEK (MEK-SDSE) because of its severe cytotoxicity. However, we could do so using the Miu2-TAYA and Miu2-KR mutants, probably because these mutants could not be activated by the MEK-SDSE mutant. MEK-SDSE could increase the FRET efficiency of the Miu2-TAYA mutant, but not the Miu2-KR mutant. Notably, the increase in FRET efficiency correlated perfectly with the retention of the probe in the cytoplasm. Thus, these observations indicated that the phosphorylation of Thr188 and Tyr190 triggered the dissociation of MEK from the Miu2 probe and that the FRET level reflected its binding to MEK. This finding was further confirmed by the co-immunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. 1D). Correlation of the Phosphorylation of the FRET Probe with That of Endogenous ERK2—To validate the use of the probe for monitoring ERK2 activation, we compared the time course of the phosphorylation of the probe and that of endogenous ERK2 in EGF-stimulated HeLa cells (Fig. 2, A, B, and D). The phosphorylation of Thr188 and Tyr190 of both the probe and endogenous ERK reached to its zenith in 5 min and returned slowly to the basal level in 30 min. The time course of MEK phosphorylation also correlated with this time course. Furthermore, we calculated the percentage of probe phosphorylation as described under “Materials and Methods.” The maximum phosphorylation level (<50%) and the overall time course were very similar between the Miu2 probe and endogenous ERK. Thus, we concluded that the phosphorylation of the probe and therefore the FRET efficiency of the probe could be used as an index of activation of endogenous ERK. We also examined the level of phosphorylated MEK using anti-phospho-MEK immunoprecipitates as a calibration marker (Fig. 2, C and 2E). In contrast to ERK, only 5% of MEK was phosphorylated, even in the presence of an excess of EGF. ERK Activation Analyzed Using the Miu2 Probe—Using the FRET probe described above, we visualized the activation of ERK in HeLa cells. Typical images and time courses of CFP intensity and FRET values of the probe are shown in Fig. 3. The data obtained from seven in depthanalyzed video images are summarized as follows. First, EGF stimulation immediately triggered a decrease in the FRET level in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Probably because we needed 30 s to apply EGF to the culture dish, we could not detect a time lag between EGF application and the decrease in the FRET level. Second, there was a time lag (2.8 ± 1.3 min) between the initiation of FRET change and the onset of a detectable increase in the level of ERK in the nucleus. Third, the FRET level reached its nadir first in the cytoplasm (5.5 ± 2.2 min) and then in the nucleus (5.9 ± 2.1 min). Nuclear accumulation of the probe reached its zenith in 7.8 ± 2.1 min (Fig. 3B). Interaction of ERK and MEK Visualized Using Intermolecular FRET Probes—To confirm the results obtained above and to examine the dynamics of MEK, we next visualized the interaction of ERK2 with MEK1 by the intermolecular FRET method. We first searched for an optimum pair of ERK and MEK tagged with monomeric CFP and monomeric YFP, respectively, by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. In a preliminary experiment, we found that MEK, if fused to the N terminus of YFP, did not bind to ERK; therefore, we excluded this construct from further analyses. Using MEK-YFP, we compared the FRET levels of CFP-ERK and ERK-CFP. As shown in supplemental Fig. 3(A-D), only CFP-ERK yielded significant FRET with MEK-YFP. This result m"

Here we show that overexpression of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1), an enzyme responsible for the production of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), in MCF-7 cells stimulates autophagy by increasing the formation of LC3-positive autophagosomes and the rate of proteolysis sensitive to the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine. Autophagy was blocked in the presence of dimethylsphingosine, an inhibitor of SK activity, and in cells expressing a catalytically inactive form of SK1. In SK1wt-overexpressing cells, however, autophagy was not sensitive to fumonisin B1, an inhibitor of ceramide synthase. In contrast to ceramide-induced autophagy, SK1(S1P)-induced autophagy is characterized by (i) the inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling independently of the Akt/protein kinase B signaling arm and (ii) the lack of robust accumulation of the autophagy protein Beclin 1. In addition, nutrient starvation induced both the stimulation of autophagy and SK activity. Knocking down the expression of the autophagy protein Atg7 or that of SK1 by siRNA abolished starvation-induced autophagy and increased cell death with apoptotic hallmarks. In conclusion, these results show that SK1(S1P)-induced autophagy protects cells from death with apoptotic features during nutrient starvation.

Stimulation of autophagy during the limitation of nutrient supply is a cell-defense mechanism by which amino acids and other intracellular nutrients are recycled to maintain survival (6Scott R.C.

The role of starvation-induced autophagy is vital for newborn mice after the maternal nutrient supply is interrupted (9Kuma A. Hatano M. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakaya H. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Tokuhisa T. Mizushima N. Nature. 2004; 432: 1032-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar). Several years ago, cell death was divided into three types (10Schweichel J.U. Merker H.J. Teratology. 1973; 7: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 11Clarke P.G.H. Anat. Embryol. 1990; 181: 195-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar, 12Bursch W.

Type I is apoptosis, type II is autophagic cell death, and type III is cytoplasmic cell death. Type II is characterized by the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles. Recent studies have shown that autophagic machinery plays a role in cell death occurring in the absence of pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (14Shimizu S. Kanaseki T. Mizushima N. Mizuta T. Arakawa-Kobayashi S. Thompson C.B. Tsujimoto Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar) and when caspases are inhibited (15Yu L. Alva A. Su H. Dutt P. Freundt E. Welsh S. Baehrecke E.H. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2004; 304: 1500-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). However, in many situations apoptosis and autophagy may both contribute to cell death making difficult to clearly distinguish type I from type II cell death (16Edinger A.L. Thompson C.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar, 17Baehrecke E.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 18Golstein P.

One characteristic of autophagy is its dependence on several tumor suppressor genes acting both in the formation of the autophagosome and in signaling pathways controlling autophagy (20Ogier-Denis E. Codogno P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1603: 113-128PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gozuacik D. Kimchi A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2891-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). Autophagy is thought to be a tumor suppressor mechanism, because cancer cells often display reduced autophagic capacities (20Ogier-Denis E. Codogno P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1603: 113-128PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gozuacik D. Kimchi A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2891-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). Beclin 1 is a tumor suppressor gene product that plays an important role, together with the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), during the formation of the autophagosome (22Liang X.H. Jackson S. Seaman M. Brown K. Kempkes B. Hibshoosh H. Levine B. Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2771) Google Scholar, 23Kihara A. Kabeya Y. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Beclin 1 haploinsufficiency induces a high level of tumor development in various mouse tissues (24Qu X. Yu J. Bhagat G. Furuya N. Hibshoosh H. Troxel A. Rosen J. Eskelinen E.-L. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Cattoretti G. Levine B. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1809-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (1889) Google Scholar, 25Yue Z.

The tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10), which deactivates the class I PI3K signaling pathway, has a stimulating effect on autophagy (26Arico S. Petiot A. Bauvy C. Dubbelhuis P.F. Meijer A.J. Codogno P. Ogier-Denis E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35243-35246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Its deletion favors the inhibition of autophagy by the class I PI3K signaling pathway by activating mTOR (target of rapamycin), a conserved nutritional sensor that represses autophagy (6Scott R.C. Schuldiner O. Neufeld T.P. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 167-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 27Blommaart E.F. Luiken J.J. Blommaart P.J. van Woerkom G.M. Meijer A.J. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3963-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). However, the role of autophagy during tumor progression is probably more complex, because autophagic vacuoles have been observed in several types of human tumors (29Alva A.S. Gultekin S.H. Baehrecke E.H. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 1046-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Whether these autophagic vacuoles are associated with cell survival or cell death remains to be clearly demonstrated. Numerous drugs have been reported to trigger cell death with autophagic features in cancer cells (20Ogier-Denis E. Codogno P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1603: 113-128PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gozuacik D. Kimchi A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2891-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar, 30Kondo Y. Kanzawa T. Sawaya R. Kondo S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 726-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar). However, the events that lead to the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles by cancer treatments have only begun to be identified (30Kondo Y. Kanzawa T. Sawaya R. Kondo S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 726-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar). The antiestrogen drug tamoxifen triggers autophagic cell death in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells (31Bursch W. Ellinger A. Kienzl H. Torok L. Pandey S. Sikorska M. Walker R. Hermann R.S. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 1595-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the sphingolipid ceramide is a downstream target of tamoxifen during autophagy in MCF-7 cells (32Scarlatti F. Bauvy C. Ventruti A. Sala G. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Ghidoni R. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18384-18391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Ceramide stimulates autophagy by relieving the class I PI3K/Akt/PKB pathway and provoking the accumulation of the autophagy gene product Atg6/Beclin 1. In line with these findings, a cell-permeable analog of ceramide has recently been shown to induce autophagic cell death in glioma cells by increasing the expression of the mitochondrial bound BH3-only BNIP3 protein (33Daido S. Kanzawa T. Yamamoto A. Takeuchi H. Kondo Y. Kondo S. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4286-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Sphingolipids are ubiquitous constituents of eukaryotic membranes. Their metabolism is a highly dynamic process generating second messengers, including ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) (34Mathias S. Pena L.A. Kolesnick R.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 35Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Argraves K.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4893-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 36Spiegel S.

Ceramide is deacylated by ceramidases to generate sphingosine, which is then phosphorylated by sphingosine kinases to produce S1P (36Spiegel S. Milstien S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar). It is now generally admitted that ceramide, sphingosine, and S1P have contrasting effects on the response to stress (34Mathias S. Pena L.A. Kolesnick R.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 35Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Argraves K.M.

Ceramide and sphingosine are often associated with cell-growth arrest and the induction of cell death, whereas S1P favors cell proliferation and cell survival. Thus, the dynamic balance between ceramide, sphingosine, and S1P is important in determining whether cells survive or die (36Spiegel S. Milstien S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar, 39Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.G. Coso O.A. Gutkind S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). The existence of this sphingolipid rheostat stress regulator led us to consider the role sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) that produces S1P, in the control of autophagy. In the present work we show that SK1 modulates two major players of autophagy: the mTOR signaling pathway and the expression of Beclin 1. Stimulation of autophagy by SK1 is dependent upon the production of S1P. In contrast to ceramide-induced autophagy, SK1(S1P)-induced autophagy did not induce cell death but has a protective effect toward apoptosis during nutrient starvation. These findings, and others in the literature (32Scarlatti F. Bauvy C. Ventruti A. Sala G. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Ghidoni R. Codogno P. J. Biol.

Cancer. 2004; 4: 604-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar) are able to trigger autophagy but with different outcomes on cancer cell survival and death.

Beclin 1 MCF-7/tet-off (MCF-7.beclin 1) cells kindly provided by B. Levine (University of Texas Southwest Medical Center, Dallas) were used during starvation-induced autophagy. Briefly, cells were maintained in DMEM with 200 μg/ml hygromycin B and 2 μg/ml tetracycline (41Liang X.H. Yu J. Brown K. Levine B. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3443-3449PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of Beclin 1 was analyzed by Western blotting 5 days after tetracycline withdrawal. Starvation was induced by incubating cells in nutrient-free medium (Hanks' balanced salt solution plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Cells were transfected by using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science), as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, cells (0.5 × 106 cells/well) were plated in 6-well plates. Two days later, 1 μg of plasmid and 3 μl of FuGENE 6 were suspended in 100 μl of DMEM and added to the culture medium. When cells were co-transfected with SK1, PLD1 (or empty vector), and GFP-LC3 vectors, the transfection efficiency was 40% as determined by counting GFP-positive cells. Cells were analyzed 24 or 48 h after co-transfection as detailed below. SK1 and Atg7 knockdowns were accomplished by transfecting MCF-7/GFP-LC3 cells with siRNAs. The RNAi target sequences were: sense, 5′-GGGCAAGGCCUUGCAGCUC-3′ for SK1 (42Bektas M. Jolly P.S. Muller C. Eberle J. Spiegel S. Geilen C.C.

GFP-LC3 Staining—GFP-LC3 staining was carried out essentially as described previously (43Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5509) Google Scholar). At the indicated time after transfection GFP-LC3 staining was visualized using an Axioplan Zeiss microscope, and the number of GFP-LC3-positive cells with GFP-LC3 dots was determined. Proteolysis—Proteolysis was determined as described previously (44Pattingre S. Petiot A. Codogno P. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 390: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in normal culture medium containing 7400 Bq/ml of [14C]valine. Cells were rinsed three times with PBS, pH 7.4, and then the cells were incubated for 1 h in complete medium supplemented with 10 mm valine. After incubating for 1 h, during which time short-lived proteins had been degraded, the medium was replaced by fresh chase medium for another 4 h. When required, C2-Cer (75 μm), FB1 (100 μm), DMS (1.5 μm), and 3MA (10 mm) were added to the chase medium. For the PLD1- or SK1-overexpressing cells, radiolabeling with [14C]valine was started 24 h after transfection. Cells and radiolabeled proteins from the 4-h chase medium were precipitated in trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration of 10% (v/v) at 4 °C. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Protein degradation was calculated by dividing the acid-soluble radioactivity recovered from both cells and medium by the radioactivity contained in the precipitated proteins from both cells and medium. Cell viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion test as previously described (32Scarlatti F. Bauvy C. Ventruti A. Sala G. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Ghidoni R. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18384-18391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). When required, 40 μm z-VAD-fmk was added prior to incubation in nutrient-free medium (Hanks' balanced salt solution plus 0.1% of bovine serum albumin). Cells were collected by centrifuging (10 min, at 1200 × g), washing with PBS, and resuspending in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Protease Inhibitor Mixture (PIC), 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF) for 1 h at 4°C. The cell lysate was centrifuged (20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was recovered. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method as recommended by the manufacturer. Extracted proteins were first separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking overnight with fat-free milk, the membranes were incubated with appropriate primary antibodies: anti-Beclin 1 (1/2000), anti-PARP (1/1000), anti-p70S6K (1/1000), anti-phospho-p70S6K Thr389 (1/1000), anti-phospho-S6 Ser235(1/1000), anti-4E-BP1 (1/1000), anti-FLAG (1/1000), anti-Atg7 (1/1000), and anti-PKB and anti-phospho-PKB Ser473 (1/1000). Primary antibodies were detected by chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies against rabbit, goat, or mouse immunoglobulins. Fluorographs were quantitatively scanned using the NIH image software. Ceramide levels were measured using the DGK assay as described previously (45Perry D.K. Hannun Y.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 226-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected, and lipids were extracted according to a previous study (46Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43126) Google Scholar). The organic phase was divided into 1/2 and 1/6 aliquots, dried, and used for ceramide and total phospholipid measurements (47Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Briefly, 30 nmol of extracted lipids was incubated at room temperature for 45 min in the presence of β-octylglucoside/dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol micelles, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg of proteins of DGK containing membranes (Calbiochem), and 1 mm ATP mixed with [γ-32P]ATP (4.8 × 105 Bq/ml) in a final volume of 0.1 ml. At the end of the reaction, lipids were extracted, and [32P]ceramide 1-phosphate was determined by TLC separation in chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (10:4:3:3:1, v/v). The radioactivity associated with ceramide 1-phosphate spots was determined after scraping and counting in a scintillation counter. Ceramide levels were expressed in terms of the total phospholipid content. Sphingosine kinase activity was determined as described previously (48Granata R. Trovato L. Garbarino G. Taliano M. Ponti R. Sala G. Ghidoni R. Ghigo E. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1456-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected and lysed by repeated freeze-thawing cycles in 200 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 15 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% PIC, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm 4-deoxypyridoxine). After centrifuging at 13,000 × g for 30 min, the protein concentration of supernatant was determined with a Coomassie Plus Protein Assay kit (Pierce). Proteins (100 μg) were then incubated with 25 μmd-erythrosphingosine dissolved in 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm ATP, and [γ-32P]ATP (3.7 × 105 Bq dissolved in 20 mm MgCl2) for 30 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 200 μl. The reaction was stopped by adding 20 μl of HCl, 1 n, followed by 800 μl of chloroform/methanol/HCl (100:200:1, v/v). After vigorous vortexing, 250 μl of chloroform and 250 μl of KCl 2 m were added, and phases were separated by centrifugation. The organic layer was dried and resuspended in chloroform/methanol/HCl 37% (100:100:0.2, v/v). Lipids were resolved on silica TLC plates (Whatman) in 1-butanol/acetic acid/water (3:1:1, v/v). Labeled S1P spots were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by scraping and counting in a scintillation counter. For quantification of S1P, MCF-7 cells were labeled for 7 h in serum-free medium with 0.3 μCi/ml d-erythro-[3-3H]sphingosine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After washing with PBS, cells were scraped and lysed in water. Radiolabeled S1P was extracted by phase partition as previously described (49Gijsbers S. Van der Hoeven G. Van Veldhoven P.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 50Vessey D.A. Kelley M. Karliner J.S. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 337: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and counted by liquid scintillation. Phospholipase D Activity—PLD activity was determined as described previously (51O'Luanaigh N. Pardo R. Fensome A. Allen-Baume V. Jones D. Holt M.R. Cockcroft S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3730-3746Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 2 × 106 cells were plated on 25-cm2 flasks for 24 h; when required, cells were transfected with PLD1 vectors (wild-type and K898R mutant). After 24 h, cells were preincubated in 0.5% fetal bovine serum containing DMEM for 1 h. After removing the preincubation medium, cells were labeled with [3H]myristic acid (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 1.11 × 105 Bq/ml in 0.5% fetal bovine serum containing DMEM. Cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated for 30 min in complete medium containing 0.5% butanol. Cells were rinsed with PBS and scraped in methanol/water (98:2, v/v). Cells were rinsed with methanol, and the lipids were extracted by adding equal amounts of chloroform and water. After centrifuging, the lower phase was collected and dried under vacuum before being redissolved in chloroform. Lipids were separated by TLC on silica-coated plastic sheets (Merck) in a solvent system of chloroform: methanol:acetic acid:water (75:45:3:0.4, v/v). Radioactive components were detected by autoradiography. PLD activity was determined by the [3H]phosphatidylbutanol/[3H]phosphatidylcholine ratio. Phosphatidylcholine (Avanti polar) and phosphatidylbutanol (Biomol) diluted in chloroform were loaded as standards and were visualized with iodine vapor. Statistical analysis of the differences between the groups was performed using Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Sphingosine Kinase 1 Overexpression Stimulates Autophagy—MCF-7 cells were transfected either with the cDNA encoding the wild-type SK1 (SK1wt) or that encoding a mutant inactive form (SK1G82D). The activity of SK was significantly increased in SK1wt-overexpressing cells when compared with that observed in control cells transfected with an empty vector or in SK1G82D-expressing cells (Fig. 1A). Accordingly, SK1wt-overexpressing cells displayed a higher level of S1P compared with control cells (Fig. 1A). In the presence of the SK inhibitor DMS, both S1P production and SK activity were dramatically reduced in these cells. In contrast, no change in the level of ceramide was detected in SK1wt-overexpressing cells at any time points after transfection (Fig. 1, A and B). Autophagy was first analyzed after transfection of GFP-LC3 (Fig. 2A). LC3 is a reliable marker of autophagosomes in mammalian cells, and its localization changes from a diffuse cytosolic pattern to a punctuate pattern representing its recruitment to the autophagosomal membrane"

Mutations in ABCA3, a member of the ABCA subfamily with unknown function, lead to fatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in the newborn. Using cultured human lung cells, we found that recombinant wild-type hABCA3 localized to membranes of both lysosomes and lamellar bodies, which are the intracellular storage organelles for surfactant. In contrast, hABCA3 with mutations linked to RDS failed to target to lysosomes and remained in the endoplasmic reticulum as unprocessed forms. Treatment of those cells with the chemical chaperone sodium 4-phenylbutyrate could partially restore trafficking of mutant ABCA3 to lamellar body-like structures. Expression of recombinant ABCA3 in non-lung human embryonic kidney 293 cells induced formation of lamellar body-like vesicles that contained lipids. Small interfering RNA knockdown of endogenous hABCA3 in differentiating human fetal lung alveolar type II cells resulted in abnormal, lamellar bodies comparable with those observed in vivo with mutant ABCA3. Silencing of ABCA3 expression also reduced vesicular uptake of surfactant lipids phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol but not phosphatidylethanolamine. We conclude that ABCA3 is required for lysosomal loading of phosphatidylcholine and conversion of lysosomes to lamellar body-like structures.

In the lung, development of structures for effective pulmonary gas exchange and production of pulmonary surfactant are necessary for successful adaptation to extrauterine life in the newborn infant. These key processes in lung maturation require differentiation of epithelium into ATII cells, the cellular source for surfactant. Pulmonary surfactant is a complex mixture of lipids, primarily phosphatidylcholine (60-70% of which is dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine) and specific proteins that line the alveolar surface of the lung, reducing surface tension at the air-liquid interface and preventing collapse of the lung on expiration (11Dobbs L.G. Annu. Rev. Med. 1989; 40: 431-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Surfactant is assembled and stored in lamellar bodies, the secretory organelles of ATII cells (11Dobbs L.G. Annu. Rev.

Two other members of the ABCA subfamily, ABCA1 and ABCA4, have been implicated in lipid transport leading to the hypothesis that ABCA3 transports lipid into the lamellar bodies of ATII cells (7Yamano G.

Recently, it has been reported that mutations in ABCA3 are associated with defective assembly of lamellar bodies and fatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in the newborn infant and interstitial lung disease (6Shulenin S Nogee L.M. Annilo T. Wert S.E. Whitsett J.A. Dean M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 10-17Crossref Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 10Bullard J.E Wert S.E Whitsett J.A Dean M. Nogee L.M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2005; 172: 1026-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). To study the potential role of ABCA3 in RDS, we examined the subcellular trafficking and substrate specificity of ABCA3 in hATII cells and mammalian cell lines using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged protein and fluorescent lipid analogs. Morphological and functional changes secondary to both loss- and gain-of-function experiments demonstrate that ABCA3 selectively transports phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol to lamellar bodies in hATII cells. Our findings indicate that lipid trafficking by ABCA3 across lamellar body membranes is necessary for lamellar body biogenesis as a key step in assembly of lung surfactant in hATII cells.

The yield and purity of RNA was spectrophotometrically determined. Real-time RT-PCR was performed on a LightCycler (Roche Applied Science) using a one-step LightCycler-RNA Master SYBR Green I Kit (Roche). The cycling condition for RT-PCR was as follows: 48 °C for 30 s, 95 °C for 10 s, followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Quantification of the target gene mRNA level was obtained as a threshold PCR cycle number (CT) when the increase in the fluorescent signal of the PCR product showed exponential amplification. This value was then normalized to the threshold PCR cycle number obtained for actin mRNA from a parallel sample. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using the following primers; hABCA3 (forward. 5′-TTCTTCACCTACATCCCCTAC-3′; reverse, 5′-CCTTTCGCCTCAAA TTTCCC-3′); Actin (forward, 5′-CTCCTCCTGA GCGCAAGTACTC-3′; reverse, 5′-TCGTCATACTCCTGCTTGCTGAT-3′). Liposome Preparation and Lipid Uptake—Liposomes were prepared from l-αDPPC, C12-NBD-PC, egg PC, egg phosphatidylglycerol, and cholesterol in molar ratios 5:5:5:3:2. C12-NBD-SM- and C12-NBD-PE-containing liposomes were prepared with l-αDPPC, egg PC, egg phosphatidylglycerol, cholesterol, and C12-NBD-SM or C12-NBD-PE in molar ratios 10:5:3:2:2. NBD-cholesterol-containing liposomes were prepared from αDPPC, egg PC, egg phosphatidylglycerol, and NBD-cholesterol in molar ratios 10:5:3:2. Lipid uptake experiments were performed as described previously (16Muller W.J. Zen K. Fisher A.B. Shuman H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L11-L19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Chinoy M.R. Fisher A.B. Shuman H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L713-L721PubMed Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopy Imaging of Live Cells—Untransfected cells or cells transfected with hABCA3-GFP, hABCA3-DsRed, hABCA3 siRNA, or nonspecific siRNA were loaded with LysoTracker Red (0.01 μm), ERTracker Red (0.01 μm), Nile-Red (0.1 μg/ml), NBD-labeled phospholipids, or cholesterol (150 μg/ml) and washed twice with fresh medium. Coverslips were affixed to a chamber and mounted in a PDMI-2 open perfusion microincubator (Harvard apparatus, Holliston, MA) maintained at 37 °C on a Nikon TE300 inverted microscope. Confocal imaging was performed using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 imaging system equipped with a krypton/argon ion laser source. After staining the live cells, images were collected under confocal microscopy, and 10 different images were taken from each sample. Images were Kalmanaveraged three times. Lipid Uptake—NBD-lipid in membrane fractions was measured as previously described (18Madesh M. Hajnoczky G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1003-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with NBD-lipid containing liposomes for 30 min and washed with ice-cold phosphatebuffered saline two times each for 5 min. Equal numbers of cells (1 × 107 cells) were permeabilized with 1 ml of intracellular medium composed of 120 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 20 mm Tris-HEPES, and 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, at pH 7.2, supplemented with 80 μg/ml digitonin (Sigma, 50% (w/w)). After 10 min of incubation, the intracellular medium was removed, and the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Fluorescence from the suspension was monitored in a multiwavelength excitation dual wavelength emission fluorometer (Delta RAM, Photon Technology International) using 460-nm excitation and 534-nm emission. Experiments were performed at 37 °C with constant stirring. Data are representative of four independent experiments. Electron Microscopy—For electron microscopy, cells cultured on glass slides were fixed with ice-cold 5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 2 h, followed by two steps of post-fixation: 1% OsO4 in cacodylate buffer and then 2% uranyl acetate in distilled water, 1 h for each step. The cells were then dehydrated in graded concentrations of ice-cold acetone, embedded on glass slides with electron microscopy bed 812 resin (EMS, Fort Washington, PA), and polymerized at 60 °C for 48 h. After the glass slides were removed with 48% hydrofluoric acid (Sigma) from the surface of the epon plastic blocks, the cells remaining in the plastic blocks were cut into ultrathin sections (70 nm), counter stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and imaged with a JEOL 100 CX microscope. hABCA3 Localizes to Lamellar Bodies and Lysosomes—ABCA3 was previously shown to localize to lamellar body membranes in ATII cells and to intracellular vesicles in lung-derived cell lines (7Yamano G.

FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hook G.E.R. Gilmore L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9211-9220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gibson K.F. Windnell C.C. Am.

We therefore hypothesized that lamellar bodies are lysosome-derived secretory organelles. hABCA3 fused to green fluorescent protein (hABCA3-GFP) was transiently expressed in A549 and hATII cells. In hormone-induced, differentiated human fetal lung ATII cells, which produce and secrete surfactant comparable with adult ATII cells (15Gonzales L.W. Guttentag S.H. Wade K.C. Postle A.D. Ballard P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L940-L951Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), confocal microscopy showed hABCA3-GFP in the membranes of vesicles that were labeled with the lysosomal marker Lyso-Tracker Red and the lamellar body membrane marker dendritic cell-specific lysosome-associated membrane protein (DC-LAMP) (Fig. 1, a-f)) (25Akasaki K. Nakamura N. Tsukui N. Yokota S. Murata S. Katoh R. Michihara A. Tsuji H. Marques Jr., E.T. August J.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 425: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In A549 cells, a lung-derived epithelial tumor cell line that neither contains lamellar bodies nor expresses DC-LAMP and surfactant proteins (26Li F. Rosenberg E. Smith C.I. Notarfrancesco K. Reisher S.R. Shuman H. Feinstein S.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L241-L247PubMed Google Scholar), hABCA3-GFP, was found in membranes of vesicles that were labeled with LysoTracker Red and two lysosomal membrane proteins, LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 (Fig. 1, g-o). These results further support a close relationship between lysosomes and lamellar bodies in ATII cells. hABCA3 Mutations Associated with RDS Alter Trafficking and Processing of the Protein—Missense mutations of ABCA3 linked to fatal surfactant deficiency and abnormal lamellar body formation have been found in different functional domains of hABCA3 (6Shulenin S Nogee L.M. Annilo T. Wert S.E. Whitsett J.A. Dean M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 10-17Crossref Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 10Bullard J.E Wert S.E Whitsett J.A Dean M. Nogee L.M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2005; 172: 1026-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). To determine whether these mutations lead to improper organelle targeting or loss of ATPase activity, constructs of hABCA3-GFP were engineered with representative missense mutations in residues conserved across species for ABCA3 (6Shulenin S Nogee L.M. Annilo T. Wert S.E. Whitsett J.A. Dean M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 10-17Crossref Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The first was in extracellular loop 1 (L101P), the second in the Walker A motif or P-loop (phosphate binding loop) of the N-terminal nucleotide binding domain (N568D), and the third in transmembrane domain 11 (G1221S) of hABCA3. These three mutant ABCA3 constructs (shown schematically in supplemental Fig. 1) were then expressed in A549 cells (supplemental Fig. 2). Fluorescence images of live cells stained with either LysoTracker Red or ERTracker Red indicated that the three constructs had graded trafficking defects. The construct containing mutation L101P of ABCA3-GFP failed to target the lysosomal membrane (Fig. 2A, d-f) and mainly remained in the ER (Fig. 2B, d-f)). The construct containing mutation G1221S occasionally localized to lysosomes (Fig. 2A, j-l, arrows) and otherwise remained in the ER (Fig. 2B, j-l). The construct containing mutation N568D often localized to the lysosomal membrane (Fig. 2A, g-i) and partially remained in the ER (Fig. 2B, g-i). Thus, single missense mutations of hABCA3 can alter its localization, suggesting that RDS in some affected infants is likely associated with improper intracellular trafficking of hABCA3. Western blotting with GFP antibody revealed that mutant protein is expressed at a lower overall level than wild-type protein and that wildtype and mutant fusion proteins (L101P, N568D, and G1221S) are processed differently (Fig. 2C). hABCA3 protein was found as two molecular mass forms by SDS-PAGE, a 190-kDa form (GFP fusion protein = 220 kDa) and a 150-kDa form (GFP fusion protein = 180 kDa) (Fig. 2C) (7Yamano G. Funahashi H. Kawanami O. Zhao L.X. Ban N. Uchida Y. Morohoshi T. Ogawa J. Shioda S. Inagaki N. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, the relative amount of the lower molecular mass protein band was markedly reduced in all of the mutants compared with wild type. Densitometry analysis of a 180/220-kDa ratio of Western blot (Fig. 2C) was 0.85 for the wild-type protein, 0.45 for the N568D mutant, 0.3 for the G1221S mutant, and essentially 0.0 for the L101P mutant. The higher molecular mass (full-length) bands (220 kDa) for wild-type and mutant proteins were shifted by ∼10 kDa to lower molecular masses after treatment with PNGase F (Fig. 2C, 210 kDa), whereas the positions of the lower molecular mass bands (180 kDa) were not affected by glycosidase, as shown previously for the wild-type protein (9Nagata K.

Effect of 4-PBA on Trafficking of hABCA3 Missense Mutations—Improper protein folding or trafficking is associated with a number of genetic diseases (27Nishibori Y. Liu L. Hosoyamada M. Endou H. Kudo A. Takenaka H. Higashihara E. Bessho F. Takahashi S. Kershaw D. Ruotsalainen V. Tryggvason K. Khoshnoodi J. Yan K.

Chemical or pharmacological chaperones can subsequently correct abnormal folding or trafficking of defective proteins (29Liu X.L. Done S.C. Yan K. Kilpelainen P. Pikkarainen T. Tryggvason K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 1731-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30Welch W.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Abnormal trafficking of the most common mutation of the cystic fibrosis gene (ABCC7), ΔF508-CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator), can be rescued by application of the chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) (31Lim M. McKenzie K. Floyd A.D. Kwon E. Zeitlin P.L. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 31: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To investigate whether trafficking of mutant hABCA3 could be restored, 4-PBA was applied to cells expressing the hABCA3-GFP missense mutants L101P hABCA3-GFP, and G1221S hABCA3-GFP and visualized by confocal microscopy. The addition of 1 mm 4-PBA to HEK239 cells stably transfected with G1221S hABCA3-GFP and L101P hABCA3-GFP markedly altered GFP localization from the ER to the membranes of punctate vesicles (Fig. 3, A and B, and supplemental Fig. 3), but it did not alter the localization of wild-type hABCA3-GFP (supplemental Fig. 4). Vesicles with G1221S hABCA3-GFP (Fig. 3B, b, d, and f)), but not L101P hABCA3-GFP (Fig. 3A, b, d, and f)), stained positively with LysoTracker Red. Western blots with GFP antibody showed that total hABCA3-GFP protein was increased in the presence of 4-PBA for both L101P and G1221S hABCA3-GFP (Fig. 3C) but that the ratio of 180/220 kDa protein bands increased only for the G1221S hABCA3-GFP mutant (Fig. 3D), providing further evidence that the lower molecular weight protein form correlates with lysosomal processing. ABCA3 Promotes Formation of Lamellar Vesicles—Mutations of hABCA3 protein are associated with abnormal lamellar body formation in hATII cells (6Shulenin S Nogee L.M. Annilo T. Wert S.E. Whitsett J.A. Dean M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 10-17Crossref Scopus (521) Google Scholar). To test whether ABCA3 is sufficient for biogenesis of vesicles containing lamellae, stable hABCA3-GFP expression was established in non-lung-derived HEK293 cells that normally express low levels of endogenous ABCA3. As with the other cells, hABCA3-GFP was localized to lysosomal membranes in HEK293 cells (supplemental Fig. 5). To examine the effects of ABCA3 expression on cell function and morphology, GFP/HEK293 or hABCA3-GFP/HEK293 cells"

We developed two distinct thiol-labeling approaches to identify oxidized cytoplasmic protein thiols in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Inone approach, we used N-(6-(biotinamido)hexyl)-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)-propionamide to purify oxidized protein thiols, and in the other, we used N-[14C]ethylmaleimide to quantify this oxidation. Both approaches showed a large number of the same proteins with oxidized thiols (∼200), 64 of which were identified by mass spectrometry. We show that, irrespective of its mechanism, protein thiol oxidation is dependent upon molecular O2. We also show that H2O2 does not cause de novo protein thiol oxidation, but rather increases the oxidation state of a select group of proteins. Furthermore, our study reveals contrasted differences in the oxidized proteome of cells upon inactivation of the thioredoxin or GSH pathway suggestive of very distinct thiol redox control functions, assigning an exclusive role for thioredoxin in H2O2 metabolism and the presumed thiol redox buffer function for GSH. Taken together, these results suggest the high selectivity of cytoplasmic protein thiol oxidation.

The amino acid cysteine subserves important biological functions due to the unique redox properties of the sulfur atom of its thiol side chain (1Jacob C. Giles G.I. Giles N.M. Sies H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 4742-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). By engaging in a wide variety of redox reactions and coordinating metals, cysteine serves as a key residue in enzyme catalysis, protein oxidative folding (2Frand A.R. Cuozzo J.W. Kaiser C.A.

Sci. 2004; 29: 351-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, these unique redox properties also make the cysteine residue vulnerable to reaction with a wide spectrum of non-physiological electrophiles, especially the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, potentially leading to unwanted redox modifications and protein loss of function (9Forman H.J. Fukuto J.M. Torres M. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C246-C256Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The cysteine residue exists in vivo in the fully reduced free thiol form (-SH or -S-) and in different oxidation forms: the thiyl radical (-S·); the disulfide bond (Cys-S-S-Cys); the sulfenic (-SOH), sulfinic (SO2H), and sulfonic (-SO3H) acid forms; and the S-nitrosylated form (-S-NO) (1Jacob C. Giles G.I. Giles N.M. Sies H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 4742-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 7Poole L.B. Karplus P.A. Claiborne A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

The cysteine thiyl radical and cysteine sulfenic acid are very unstable because of their highly reactive nature and thus cannot be easily identified biochemically. In contrast, the cysteine sulfinic and sulfonic acids are irreversible forms of protein oxidation, although the cysteine sulfinic acid that forms in the peroxide-reducing enzyme peroxiredoxin is enzymatically retroreduced by sulfiredoxin (11Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 12Woo H.A. Kang S.W. Kim H.K. Yang K.S. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47361-47364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Disulfide bonds are relatively stable, reversing to the reduced state by thioldisulfide exchange with kinetics depending on the protein context (10Gilbert H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 8-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Their occurrence is thought to be restricted to specific subcellular compartments. In the endoplasmic reticulum, disulfide bond formation drives the correct folding of secreted proteins and is catalyzed by a FAD-containing sulfhydryl oxidase (Ero1) and protein-disulfide isomerase (Pdi1) (2Frand A.R. Cuozzo J.W. Kaiser C.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 203-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 3Tu B.P. Weissman J.S. Mol.

Acta. 2004; 1699: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Protein import and folding in the mitochondrial intermembrane space are driven by disulfide bond formation by another recently identified redox relay involving the FAD-containing Erv1 oxidase and Mia40 (5Tokatlidis K.

Cell. 2005; 121: 1059-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In contrast, the cytoplasm is not thought to contain many proteindisulfide bonds due to its highly reducing nature caused by two potent NADPH-dependent thiol-reducing systems, the thioredoxin and GSH pathways (14Grant C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 15Toledano M.B. Delaunay A. Biteau B. Spector D. Azevedo D. Hohmann S. Mager W.H. Topics Current Genetics. 1. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2003: 241-303Google Scholar). Still, disulfide bonds are formed in this compartment at least in a few enzymes with a thiol oxidation step in their catalytic cycle such as ribonucleotide reductase and in redox-regulated proteins such as the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Yap1 and Escherichia coli OxyR H2O2 sensors (8Toledano M.B. Delaunay A. Monceau L. Tacnet F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 351-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic disulfide bonds are also found in the form of mixed disulfides between GSH and protein thiols, a modification referred to as S-thiolation (16Ghezzi P. Free Radic. Res. 2005; 39: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 17Klatt P. Lamas S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4928-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 18Shenton D. Grant C.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Protein S-thiolation protects oxidized protein thiols, whether in the thiyl or sulfenic acid form, from further irreversible oxidation and has been proposed to regulate protein function. The in vivo redox state of cysteine residues must reflect both their diverse redox functions and their potential modifications by oxidative and nitrosative stress. We sought to evaluate the scope of cytoplasmic protein thiol oxidation in S. cerevisiae with the aim of questioning the dogma of its reducing nature and of identifying new thiol redox-mediated physiological processes. We also evaluated the consequences of thiol redox pathway inactivation on protein thiol oxidation and questioned to what extent cysteine residues represent targets of oxidative stress caused by H2O2. Because of their intrinsic reactivity, cysteine residues can undergo redox modification upon cell lysis, making it difficult to evaluate their true in vivo redox state. This problem can be circumvented by quenching the reactivity of thiol groups by acid cell lysis (19Bardwell J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 42-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 20Delaunay A. Isnard A.D. Toledano M.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5157-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), followed by differential labeling of reduced versus oxidized thiols with thiol-specific reagents. We used this general thiol-trapping technique together with two different thiol-specific reagents.

We present our findings obtained from the combined use of these two redox proteomic approaches and discuss the possible cellular mechanisms underlying cytoplasmic disulfide bond formation. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—Experiments were performed with the S. cerevisiae wild-type strain Y252 (MATa ura3-52 lys2-801amber ade2-101ochre trp1-Δ1 leu2-Δ1), a derivative of YPH98 (21Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and isogenic derivatives. The Δgsh1PRO2-1Δglr1 (yeast SOGΔglr1) strain has been described (22Spector D. Labarre J. Toledano M.B.

Chromosomal gene inactivation was performed by oligonucleotide-mediated PCR replacement of entire coding regions and confirmed by PCR. Δtrr1,Δtrx2 and Δtdh3 were obtained by replacement with KANMX4, and Δtrx1 with URA3. The triple mutant Δtrr1Δtrx1Δtrx2 was obtained by a cross between Δtrr1 and Δtrx1Δtrx2 and sporulation of the triple heterozygous diploid. Cells were grown at 30 °C in 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 0.1% casamino acids, and 2% glucose supplemented with adenine, uracil, and tryptophan as required. For anaerobic growth, liquid medium supplemented with ergosterol (30 mg/ml) and Tween 80 (0.2%) was bubbled under a constant nitrogen flow for 8 h and inoculated with cells. The liquid culture was incubated at 30 °C with constant shaking in an anaerobic chamber in which oxygen had been removed using a Merck Anaerocult A cassette, as confirmed by a Merck indicator strip color change. Plasmid Constructions—The Myc-Tdh3 fusion protein (containing a C-terminal Myc tag epitope) was constructed by a two-step PCR amplification procedure with oligonucleotide sequences encoding the Myc epitope (5′-AAAGTTGATTTCTGAAGAAGATTTGTAAGTGAATTTACTTTAAATCTT and 5′-CTTCTTCAGAAATCAACTTTTGTTCAGCCTTGGCAACGTGTTCAA) and cloned into the EcoRI and NotI sites of the centromeric pRS316 plasmid. The Myc-Tdh3 mutant carrying serine substitutions of its two cysteines (Myc-Tdh3(C150S,C154S)) was created by PCR amplification with oligonucleotides 5′-TCCAACGCTTCTAGTACCACCAACAGTTTGGCTCCATTGG and 5′-CCAATGGAGCCAAACTGTTGGTGGTACTAGAAGCGTTGGA. Myc-T-sa1 was constructed as described (11Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Biotin-HPDP Labeling and Purification—Exponentially growing cells (A600 = 0.4-0.5) were lysed using trichloroacetic acid and glass beads as described (20Delaunay A. Isnard A.D. Toledano M.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5157-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 23Delaunay A. Pflieger D. Barrault M.B. Vinh J. Toledano M.B.

The air-dried trichloroacetic acid pellet was dissolved in denaturing buffer (8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.8), and 10 mm EDTA) (2v/v) containing iodoacetamide (50 mm) and incubated for 45 min at 30 °C. Aggregates were spun down by centrifugation, and the supernatant was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (10%). The trichloroacetic acid pellet was acetone-washed, air-dried, dissolved in denaturing buffer containing 20 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), incubated for 45 min at 30 °C, and trichloroacetic acid-precipitated to remove excess DTT. The resulting trichloroacetic acid pellet was dissolved in denaturing buffer containing 0.5 mm biotin-HPDP (Pierce) and incubated for 45 min at 30 °C in the dark. Extracts were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated to remove unbound biotin-HPDP, dissolved in denaturing buffer, and used for protein purification. Protein concentration was measured using the Micro BCA assay reagent kit (Pierce). Biotin-HPDP-reacted protein extracts (3-5 mg) precleared by a 3-h incubation at 4 °C in binding buffer (4 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.8), 5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm NaCl) containing Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with continuous tumbling in binding buffer containing streptavidin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The resin was washed once with binding buffer, twice with wash buffer A (8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 1 m NaCl, and 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.8)), three times with wash buffer B (8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, and 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.8)), and once with elution buffer (8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, and 7 mm Tris). Biotinylated proteins were eluted with elution buffer (400 μl) containing DTT (20 mm). Eluted proteins were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. [14C]NEM Protein Labeling—[14C]NEM thiol labeling was carried out as described above for biotin-HPDP labeling, except that biotin-HPDP was replaced with 2 mm [14C]NEM (37.5 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Extracts were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated to remove excess [14C]NEM, solubilized in elution buffer, and subjected to two- or one-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Where indicated, the denaturing buffer used was 100 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Extracts were adjusted to a 400-μl volume rehydration solution (8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 20 mm DTT, 1% immobilized pH gradient buffer, and bromphenol blue) and loaded onto strip holders (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were separated in the first dimension by isoelectric focusing using pH 3-10 nonlinear Immobiline DryStrip gels (18 cm) and run at 34 kV-h (50 μA/strip) for 20 h at 20 °C on an IPGphor unit (Amersham Biosciences). In the second dimension, focused immobilized pH gradient strips were equilibrated for 15 min in equilibration buffer (6 m urea, 2% SDS, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, and bromphenol blue) containing DTT (50 mm) and for 15 min in the same buffer containing iodoacetamide (100 mm). Immobiline DryStrip gels were washed with electrophoresis buffer (Tris/glycine/SDS), transferred onto 13% polyacrylamide gels, and embedded in 0.5% (w/v) agarose containing Tris/glycine/SDS. SDS-PAGE migration was performed using an Ettan DALTsix system for 18 h (1.5 watts/gel) at 30 °C. For [14C]NEM-labeled extracts, gels were fixed, dried, exposed to sensitive screens, and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). For biotin-HPDP-purified proteins, gels were stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue (Sigma). Western Blot Analyses—Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated extracts were solubilized in the presence of 50 mm NEM (Sigma). Protein extracts (20 μg) were dissolved in Laemmli buffer without β-mercaptoethanol, boiled, and loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (15%). Separated proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, probed with either anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 or horseradish peroxidaseconjugated streptavidin, and revealed using an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting reagent kit (Amersham Biosciences). Protein Identification by MALDI-TOF-MS—Protein spots of interest were excised from stained gels, cut into ∼1-mm3 pieces, washed with water, dehydrated in 100% acetonitrile, dried in a SpeedVac vacuum evaporator, and washed with ammonium bicarbonate (0.1 m) for 30 min at 56 °C to remove the dye. Gels pieces were rehydrated for 45 min on ice in a solution containing 25 mm NH4HCO3,5mm CaCl2, and 12.5 ng/μl trypsin. In-gel digestion was performed in the trypsin-free solution for 2 h at 37 °C. The digest solution (0.5-1 μl) was applied to a sample plate, and an equal volume of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 100% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (1:1, v/v) was added. Air-dried droplets were desalted twice with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Spectra were acquired using a Voyager-DE STR Biospectrometry workstation (Applied Biosystems) in positive ion reflector mode with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. Masses were calibrated with external standards (Sequazyme peptide mass standard kit, Applied Biosystems) and with internal autolysis tryptic peptides. Proteins were identified by searching the Swiss Protein Data Base (available at prowl.rockefeller.edu/profound_bin/WebProFound.exe). Among proposed peptide search options, we included the two following modifications: oxidation of methionines (peptide mass ± 16 Da) and carbamidomethylation of cysteines (peptide mass ± 57 Da). Calibrated monoisotopic peptide masses were searched against the Swiss Protein Non-redundant Protein Database using the Prowl program with a mass tolerance between 20 and 50 ppm. Identification was established by searches in all taxonomic categories with a Z-score ≥1.5, except for Prx1, Hsp60, Ado1, Guk1, Ubc1, Cpr1, and Tma19, which had lower Z-scores. Purification of Proteins with in Vivo Oxidized Thiols—We sought to identify yeast proteins bearing one or more oxidized cysteine residues (in the sulfenic acid or disulfide-bonded form) by adapting the biotin switch method aimed at S-nitrosylated proteins (24Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar, 25Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Sci. STKE 2001. 2001; : PL1Google Scholar). In brief, oxidized cysteine residues of crude yeast extracts were specifically labeled with biotin-HPDP and purified by streptavidin affinity chromatography (Fig. 1). HPDP is an absolute thiol-specific reagent that covalently and reversibly attaches to free thiol groups through a disulfide bridge. Two dimensional Coomassie Blue-stained gels showed that numerous proteins were purified from exponentially growing cells by streptavidin affinity chromatography (Fig. 2A). We performed several controls for establishing the method specificity. (i) When biotin-HPDP was substituted with iodoacetamide, no proteins were recovered, indicating the absolute specificity of the purification for biotinylated proteins (Fig. 2B). (ii) When the reduction of disulfide bonds by DTT prior to the biotin HPDP step was omitted in the purification scheme, only traces of proteins were eluted (Fig. 2C), indicating the HPDP labeling specificity for oxidized cysteine residues. The protein traces recovered may indicate unprompted disulfide bond reduction during the in vitro procedure and/or a low level of nonspecific HPDP protein labeling. We thus verified by Western blotting the extent of protein biotinylation of the same control extracts, i.e. iodoacetamide-blocked but not DTT-reduced, which showed the presence of minor trace signals, with the exception of a discrete 40-kDa band (Fig. 2F, lane 2) corresponding to Tdh3 (see below). Contrasting with the latter control is the heavy labeling of iodoacetamide-blocked extracts that had been reacted with biotin-HPDP after DTT reduction (Fig. 2F, lane 1). We also directly assayed cysteine residue selectivity by testing whether the abundant enzyme glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Tdh3) could still be purified if it lacked its two cysteine residues. Cysteine-less Tdh3 was not purified using this experimental procedure, attesting the high selectivity of the method for cysteine residues (Fig. 2E). (iii) Finally, when DTT was omitted in the elution step, no or only barely detectable protein traces were recovered (Fig. 2D), indicating that only proteins bound to beads by a DTT-sensitive biotin attachment could be eluted, and this represents another demonstration of the cysteine selectivity of the purification scheme.FIGURE 2Purification of oxidized protein thiols by the biotin-HPDP method. A-E, Coomassie Blue-stained two-dimensional gels of proteins purified from exponential growing wild-type cells in experimental (A) and control (B-E) experiments. A, the experiment followed the scheme shown in Fig. 1. B, biotin-HPDP was substituted with iodoacetamide (IAM). C, DTT was omitted prior to reaction of the extracts with biotin-HPDP. D, DTT was omitted during the elution procedure. E, the same experiment was performed as described for B, except that a strain with a TDH3 deletion and expressing either Myc-Tdh3 or Myc-Tdh3(C150S,C154S) was used as indicated. Shown is a two-dimensional gel enlargement of a portion corresponding to the boxed two-dimensional gel portion in A. Each of these experiments was reproduced at least twice. 3-mg protein extracts were used in A and C,and 5 m gin B, D, and E. F, visualization of the extent of protein biotinylation. Trichloroacetic acid extracts in equal amounts were iodoacetamide-blocked and reacted with biotin-HPDP (lane 2) or were reduced with DTT and reacted with biotin-HPDP (lane 1). Extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and revealed by Western blotting using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The purification method described here thus appears to be highly specific for proteins with oxidized cysteine residues. Furthermore, its protein yield is adapted to easy MS protein identification. Identification of the Oxidized Proteome of Unstressed Cells—Coomassie Blue-stained two-dimensional gels of proteins purified from exponentially growing cells contained ∼200 spots (Fig. 3A). We carried out an exhaustive MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of these proteins, thereby identifying about one-third of them (Fig. 3A and Table 1). The majority of the proteins identified were cytoplasmic (57/64), with very few residing in the endoplasmic reticulum (Pdi1) and mitochondria (Mdh1, Por1, Hsp60, Prx1, and Ilv5), a result consistent with the data obtained using our protein extraction protocol that eliminated membranous fractions. Purification assays using cytosolic fractions generated by differential centrifugation of yeast spheroplast extracts yielded similar proteome profiles, except for the few endoplasmic reticulum- and mitochondrion-resident proteins that were absent (data not shown). The proteins identified were sorted into functional classes that comprised reactive oxygen species scavengers and sulfur oxidoreductases, stress chaperones, carbohydrate and energy metabolism enzymes, amino acid biosynthetic enzymes, and protein translation factors (Table 1). We have also listed in Table 1 additional proteins identified in cells with an inactive thioredoxin pathway (see below).TABLE 1Oxidized protein identificationProtein Z-scoreLocationaC, cytoplasm; M, mitochondria; N, nucleus; R, ribosome; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; V, vacuole; P, proteasome.CysIox (WT)Iox ratiobIox ratio = Iox(H2O2)/Iox(WT) or Iox(Δtrr1Δtrx1Δtrr2)/Iox(WT) (values in boldface represent ratios >2).Previous identificationcPrevious identifications whether oxidized or S-thiolated (with the corresponding references).Reactive thiolsRef.H2O2Δtrr1Δtrx1Δtrx2Redox enzymesROS scavengersSod1 (copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase)2.43C/M21.221.161.32+Cys57 -Cys146 disulfide47Tsa1 (thiol-specific antioxidant)2.39C20.441.81.36+Cys47 -Cys170 disulfide44,45, 47-50Ahp1 (alkylhydroperoxide reductase)2.22C30.222.371.27+Cys62 -Cys120 disulfide44Yhb1 (flavohemoglobin, NO reductase/dioxigenase)2.43C/M4Tsa2dProteins identified in the Δtrr1Δtrx1Δtrx2 mutant.

https://openalex.org/W2020902595,"The key feature of metabolic syndrome, a cluster of metabolic and cardiovascular disorders, is systemic insulin resistance, which is associated with dysregulated endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS). Stress signaling induced by inflammation can inhibit insulin signaling. However, molecular mechanisms for the cross-talk between stress signaling and insulin resistance are only partially understood. Resistin, an adipokine/cytokine, is involved in inflammatory processes that could lead to insulin resistance status and vascular diseases. In the current study, we observed that resistin inhibited insulin signaling and eNOS activation in endothelial cells. Up-regulation of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten) expression by resistin may mediate the inhibitory effects. Activated stress signaling p38 MAPK, but not JNK, is involved in PTEN up-regulation. We further found that p38 target transcriptional factor activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2) bound to ATF sites in the PTEN promoter. The phosphorylation/activation of ATF-2 and its binding to PTEN promoter were increased by resistin treatment. In summary, up-regulation of PTEN is involved in the inhibitory effects of resistin on insulin signaling and eNOS activation in endothelial cells. Resistin induces PTEN expression by activating stress signaling p38 pathway, which may activate target transcription factor ATF-2, which in turn induces PTEN expression. Our findings suggest that resistin-mediated inhibition of insulin signaling and eNOS activation may contribute to cardiovascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1978429719,"The Polycomb group (PcG) encodes an evolutionarily conserved set of chromatin-modifying proteins that are thought to maintain cellular transcriptional memory by stably silencing gene expression1. In mouse embryos that are mutated for the PcG protein Eed, X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) is not stably maintained in extra-embryonic tissues2. Eed is a component of a histone-methyltransferase complex that is thought to contribute to stable silencing in undifferentiated cells due to its enrichment on the inactive X-chromosome in cells of the early mouse embryo and in stem cells of the extra-embryonic trophectoderm lineage3,4,5,6,7,8. Here, we demonstrate that the inactive X-chromosome in Eed−/− trophoblast stem cells and in cells of the trophectoderm-derived extra-embryonic ectoderm in Eed−/− embryos remain transcriptionally silent, despite lacking the PcG-mediated histone modifications that normally characterize the facultative heterochromatin of the inactive X-chromosome. Whereas undifferentiated Eed−/− trophoblast stem cells maintained XCI, reactivation of the inactive X-chromosome occurred when these cells were differentiated. These results indicate that PcG complexes are not necessary to maintain transcriptional silencing of the inactive X-chromosome in undifferentiated stem cells. Instead, PcG proteins seem to propagate cellular memory by preventing transcriptional activation of facultative heterochromatin during differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2046419063,"The exercise-induced interleukin (IL)-6 production and secretion within skeletal muscle fibers has raised the question of a putative tissue-specific function of IL-6 in the energy metabolism of the muscle during and after the exercise. In the present study, we followed the hypothesis that IL-6 signaling may directly interact with insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, a keystone in the insulin signaling cascade. We showed that IL-6 induces a rapid recruitment of IRS-1 to the IL-6 receptor complex in cultured skeletal muscle cells. Moreover, IL-6 induced a rapid and transient phosphorylation of Ser-318 of IRS-1 in muscle cells and in muscle tissue, but not in the liver of IL-6-treated mice, probably via the IL-6-induced co-recruitment of protein kinase C-δ. This Ser-318 phosphorylation improved insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation and glucose uptake in myotubes since transfection with an IRS-1/Glu-318 mutant simulating a permanent phospho-Ser-318 modification increased Akt phosphorylation and glucose uptake. Noteworthily, two inhibitory mechanisms of IL-6 on insulin action, phosphorylation of the inhibitory Ser-307 residue of IRS-1 and induction of SOCS-3 expression, were only found in liver but not in muscle of IL-6-treated mice.

Taga T. Kishimoto T. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 1-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since 1997, when the adipose tissue was recognized as a relevant IL-6 producing organ, accounting for 10–35% of circulating IL-6 plasma levels in humans (2Mohamed-Ali V. Goodrick S. Rawesh A.

It has been established in numerous clinical trials and association studies that IL-6 plasma concentrations increased with weight gain and are associated with the development of insulin resistance (3Fernandez-Real J.M.

Well in accordance with these clinical data, chronic IL-6 treatment of mice reduces insulin signal transduction in the liver and produces a mild state of insulin resistance in these animals (7Klover P.J.

However, there is overwhelming evidence that besides immune competent cells and adipose tissue, the skeletal muscle is a further important source of IL-6 (10Febbraio M.A. Pedersen B.K. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1335-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 11Pedersen B.K. Steensberg A. Schjerling P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 329-337Crossref Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Noteworthily, the IL-6 production in the muscle fibers is markedly increased by exercise, reaching interstitial IL-6 concentrations >1 ng/ml (i.e. 100-fold above physiological plasma concentrations) and, depending on the duration and intensity of the exercise, leading to elevated IL-6 plasma concentrations (12Steensberg A.

Since exercise is one of the most important therapeutic interventions to cope with weight gain and insulin resistance (14Hawley J.A. Diabetes-Metab. Res. Rev. 2004; 20: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), it is obvious to suggest that exercise-induced IL-6 expression may exert positive effects on insulin signal transduction in the skeletal muscle. In fact, moderate exercise has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, glucose uptake, and glycogen synthesis in muscle (15Wojtaszewski J.F. Hansen B.F. Gade Kiens B. Markuns J.F. Goodyear L.J.

An increasing number of reports suggest that IL-6 could act as a myocyte-derived “exercise factor” that improves the energy supply of the muscle by increasing the output of glucose and fatty acids from the energy-storing organs liver and fat and by enhancing glucose uptake, fatty acid oxidation, and glycogen synthesis in muscle (18Pedersen B.K.

Apparently, this argues for some muscle-specific insulin-sensitizing effects of IL-6, but the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. IRS-1 is a key player in insulin signaling in muscle, and its cross-talk with metabolic and mitogenic pathways is modulated in a very subtle and complex manner using the phosphorylation pattern of the Ser/Thr-phosphorylation sites of IRS-1 as a regulatory mechanism for the interaction with its important downstream mediators, e.g. phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) (22Gual P.

Since IL-6 regulates via the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3-Janus kinase (JAK) pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway several Ser/Thr-kinases shown to phosphorylate IRS-1 (29Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Haan S. Hermanns H.M. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2442) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that IL-6 could cross-talk with the insulin signaling cascade by phosphorylation of IRS-1. We showed in the present study that IL-6 induces the Ser-318 phosphorylation of IRS-1 in various muscle cell lines and in muscle tissue of mice but not in the liver, that IRS-1 coimmunoprecipitates with the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and protein kinase C (PKC)-δ in an IL-6-dependent manner, and that Ser-318 phosphorylation may improve insulin action.

In Vivo IL-6 Treatment of Mice—Ten-week-old male C57Bl/6 mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory and studied after 2 weeks of acclimatization. They were maintained on a normal light/dark cycle and kept on a regular diet. For short term IL-6 effects, mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg of body weight) and xylazine (10 mg/kg of body weight), and a total of 2.5 μg/kg of mouse recombinant IL-6 or 5 IU of insulin was injected into the inferior vena cava. Controls received a comparable amount of diluent. Tissues (liver, muscle) were removed at the indicated time points, and protein extracts were prepared as described (33Hennige A.M. Burks D.J.

Cell Culture and Transfection—Human primary skeletal muscle cells were grown from satellite cells obtained from percutaneous needle biopsies performed on the lateral portion of the quadriceps femoris (vastus lateris) muscle as recently described (34Krutzfeldt J. Kausch C. Volk A. Klein H.H. Rett K. Haring H.U. Stumvoll M. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 992-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). When myoblasts reached 80–90% confluence, the cells were fused for 5 days in α-MEM containing 5.5 mm glucose with 2% FCS and 2% antibiotic antimycotic solution (fusion medium). Stimulation of the myotubes with IL-6 was performed in fusion medium. C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose, 10% FCS, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. 1.0 × 105 cells/well of a 6-well plate were transfected using the Ca3(PO4)2-DNA-co-precipitation-method. Cells were lysed with 150 μl of lysis buffer/well (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Total protein (400 μg) was used for immunoprecipitation. L6 myoblasts were cultured in α-MEM containing 5.5 mm glucose, 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin as described (35Mitsumoto Y. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4957-4962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For differentiation, 0.5 × 105 cells/well of a 12-well plate or 2.0 × 105/well of a 6-well plate were seeded in differentiation medium (α-MEM containing 5.5 mm glucose, 2% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin and, 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Myotubes were used 7–8 days after cell seeding. To obtain stable expression of IRS-1 WT, Ala-318, and Glu-318, L6 Glut4Myc myoblasts were transfected with Effectene (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the instructions of the supplier. 2.0 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate received 0.8 μg of IRS-1 expression vector and 0.2 μg of pSVneo encoding neomycin resistance. Transfected cells were selected for their resistance to the antibiotic G418. G418-resistant clones were screened for IRS-1 expression and Ser-318 phosphorylation by Western blotting. Western Blotting—Cells were lysed with 600 μl of lysis buffer/10-cm dish (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Cytosolic extracts of myotubes were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide (7.5%) gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose by semi-dry-electroblotting, and immunodetection was performed as described in Ref. 36Weigert C. Brodbeck K. Staiger H. Kausch C. Machicao F. Haring H.U.

After stimulation with IL-6 and insulin, cells were washed with Hepes-buffered saline (containing 140 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes-sodium, pH 7.4, 5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2), and 300 μl/well of 2-deoxy-glucose mix (Hepes-buffered saline containing 0.25 μCi/ml 2-[3H]deoxy-glucose and 10 μm 2-deoxy-glucose) was added. After incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 7 min, cells were washed three times with 0.9% NaCl and lysed with 250 μl of lysis buffer. Total amounts of cell lysates were counted by liquid scintillation counting. Protein content of lysates generally varied <10%. Reverse Transcription-PCR and Real-time Quantitative PCR Analysis—Total RNA of muscle and liver was isolated with PeqGOLD TriFast (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany). Reverse transcription of total RNA (1 μg) was performed using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase with the first-strand cDNA synthesis kit for reverse transcription-PCR. Aliquots (2 μl) of the reverse transcription reactions were then submitted in duplicate to online quantitative PCR with the LightCycler system with SYBR® green using the FastStart DNA-MasterSYBR Green I as described (36Weigert C.

The following SOCS-3 primer pair was used: sense, 5′-gctggccaaagaaataacca-3′; antisense, 5′-agctcaccagcctcatctgt-3′, product of 224 bp. The PCR was performed in a volume of 20 μl: 2 μlof FastStart DNA-MasterSYBR Green I, 3 mm MgCl2, and primers according to a primer concentration of 1 μm. The instrument settings were: Denaturing at 95 °C for 10 min, 45× denaturing at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 66 °C for 10 s, elongation for 9 s. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—siRNA oligonucleotides targeting PKC-δ were designed and synthesized and annealed at Dharmacon Research, Lafayette, CO. An unrelated siRNA targeting firefly luciferase was used as control in all experiments. Transfection was performed with CellPhect (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) with 100 pmol of siRNA according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, 1 × 105 of C2C12 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose, 10% FCS without antibiotics. 24 h after the glycerol shock, cells were stimulated as indicated.

IL-6 Induces Ser-318 Phosphorylation of IRS-1 in Muscle and in Muscle Cell Culture Models—Since previous studies showed that serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 modulates insulin signal transduction, we studied whether IL-6 treatment of mice (2.5 μg/kg intravenously for 5 min) induces Ser phosphorylation of IRS-1 using phospho-site-specific antibodies against inhibitory serine residue 307 (23Rui L. Aguirre V. Kim J.K. Shulman G.I. Lee A. Corbould A. Dunaif A. White M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) and the Ser-318 phosphorylation previously reported from our group (24Moeschel K. Beck A. Weigert C. Lammers R. Kalbacher H.

We detected a rapid and significant increase in the phosphorylation of Ser-307 in liver but not in muscle of IL-6-treated mice (Fig. 1, A and C). Phosphorylation of Tyr-705 of STAT-3 demonstrated the activation of IL-6-dependent pathways. Insulin treatment resulted in a clear phosphorylation of Ser-307 in muscle (Fig. 1A) as reported previously (23Rui L. Aguirre V. Kim J.K. Shulman G.I. Lee A. Corbould A. Dunaif A. White M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). When we studied the phosphorylation of Ser-318 of IRS-1 in these animals, we found just the opposite; IL-6 induced a rapid (5 min) and significant phosphorylation of this serine residue in muscle but not in liver (Fig. 1, B and C). Noteworthily, we observed a clear although less pronounced phosphorylation of STAT-3 after IL-6 treatment in muscle when compared with liver tissue, indicating that the muscle responds to IL-6. To investigate the rapid and unexpected IL-6-induced phosphorylation of Ser-318 in skeletal muscle, we studied this effect in cultured skeletal muscle cells. Using three different cell models, we observed a rapid (2 min) and transient IL-6-induced phosphorylation of Ser-318 in human myotubes, murine C2C12 myoblasts, and rat L6 myotubes, which reached a maximum after 5–10 min of IL-6 stimulation, whereas the phosphorylation of STAT-3 proceeded (Fig. 2, A–C). Together the data show that IL-6 induces a very rapid phosphorylation of a distinct serine residue (i.e. Ser-318 in muscle) on IRS-1, an adaptor molecule previously described as an essential mediator in the signal transduction of insulin and IGF-1 (38White M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E413-E422Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The following questions arise from this novel finding. First, how are the IL-6 and the insulin signaling pathways linked to each other; second, which kinase is responsible for the IL-6-stimulated Ser-318 phosphorylation, and third, what is the physiological function of this serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in muscle? IL-6 Induces IRS-1 Association with IL-6 Receptor Complex—Our results showing an unexpectedly rapid, IL-6-induced Ser phosphorylation of IRS-1 indicated a possible interaction of proximal IL-6 signaling molecules and IRS-1. To test this hypothesis, we transfected C2C12 cells with IRS-1 and performed co-immunoprecipitation studies using antibodies both against IL-6 receptor subunit gp130, which is not unique for IL-6 signal transduction, and against the specific IL-6 receptor subunit IL-6R. IL-6 signal transduction as assessed by STAT-3 phosphorylation was similar in wild-type and IRS-1-transfected cells (Fig. 3A). In nontransfected cells, we detected a faint signal for endogenous IRS-1 in the gp130 immunoprecipitate that increased after short term IL-6 stimulation (Fig. 3B). In IRS-1-transfected cells, the basal and IL-6-stimulated IRS-1 association was much more pronounced (Fig. 3B). By immunoprecipitation of IL-6R, the amount of co-precipitated IRS-1 is also markedly enhanced in IRS-1-transfected cells after 10 min of IL-6 stimulation (Fig. 3C). The results indicate that ligand-induced IL-6 receptor complex stimulation rapidly recruits IRS-1. Co-recruited PKC-δ Phosphorylates Ser-318—The serine 318 residue of IRS-1 was previously identified by in vitro phosphorylation of IRS-1-GST fusion proteins and subsequent mass spectrometry-based sequencing as a PKC-dependent phosphorylation site (24Moeschel K. Beck A. Weigert C. Lammers R. Kalbacher H. Voelter W. Schleicher E.D. Haring H.U. Lehmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25157-25163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 39Beck A. Moeschel K. Deeg M. Haring H.U. Voelter W. Schleicher E.D. Lehmann R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 14: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Further studies using this in vitro approach revealed that all three classes of PKC isoforms, classical, novel and atypical PKCs, can phosphorylate Ser-318 (40Mussig K. Staiger H. Fiedler H. Moeschel K. Beck A. Kellerer M. Haring H.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32693-32699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Since an important role for PKC-δ in IL-6 signaling has been demonstrated (41Novotny-Diermayr V. Zhang T. Gu L. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49134-49142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that this PKC isoform could be responsible for IL-6-induced Ser-318 phosphorylation of IRS-1. To elucidate the possible participation of PKC-δ, we co-transfected active or kinasenegative PKC-δ and IRS-1 in C2C12 cells. Overexpression of active PKC-δ caused a very strong increase in Ser-318 phosphorylation in unstimulated cells, with no further obvious increase after IL-6 stimulation (Fig. 4A). In control cells, IL-6 treatment enhances Ser-318 phosphorylation as expected, whereas overexpression of the kinase-inactive PKC-δ caused no change in Ser-318 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). The data suggest that this serine residue can be phosphorylated by PKC-δ in skeletal muscle cells. To strengthen our hypothesis, we investigated the effect of IL-6 on Ser-318 phosphorylation in C2C12 cells after knock-down of PKC-δ using a siRNA silencing approach (Fig. 4B). The IL-6-induced phosphorylation of STAT-3 remained unaffected in siRNA oligonucleotides targeting PKC-δ (si-PKC-δ)-transfected cells, but phosphorylation of Ser-318 was blocked completely (Fig. 4B). Thus, we conclude that PKC-δ mediates the effect of IL-6 on Ser-318 phosphorylation. We then studied whether IL-6 stimulates the association of both IRS-1 and PKC-δ with the IL-6R. As shown in Fig. 4C, the minor coprecipitation of endogenous PKC-δ with IL-6R in wild-type cells is increased by IL-6 treatment, and this increase is similar in IRS-1-transfected cells. Transfection of C2C12 cells with PKC-δ or both PKC-δ and IRS-1 led to a comparable stimulation; the amount of endogenous as well as co-transfected PKC-δ was increased in the IL-6R immunoprecipitates in an IL-6-dependent manner (Fig. 4, C and D). The amount of co-precipitated IRS-1 was not enhanced by transfection of PKC-δ (Fig. 4D) or influenced by transfection of kinase-negative PKC-δ (data not shown). Of note, IL-6-induced phosphorylation of STAT-3 was comparable in control cells and after transfection of IRS-1 and PKC-δ (Fig. 4, A and E) or IRS-1 and kinase-negative PKC-δ (Fig. 4A). Moreover, when PKC-δ expression is down-regulated in siRNA-transfected C2C12 cells (Fig. 4B), the IL-6-induced recruitment of IRS-1 in the IL-6R complex is not affected (Fig. 4F). Thus, IL-6 induced the association of IRS-1 and IL-6R independent of PKC-δ. The data also suggest that IRS-1 and PKC-δ were in close proximity, thus enabling PKC-δ to phosphorylate Ser-318 of IRS-1. IL-6 Treatment Does Not Influence Tyrosine Phosphorylation of IRS-1—To study the biological function of the IL-6-stimulated recruitment of IRS-1 to the IL-6R complex and the subsequent Ser-318 phosphorylation of IRS-1, we investigated the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in IRS-1-transfected C2C12 cells after stimulation with IL-6 for 10 min or insulin for 5 min. Although IL-6 treatment of the IRS-1-transfected cells did not induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of total IRS-1 protein, stimulation with insulin led to the expected increase of this phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). Although a huge amount of IRS-1 was co-immunoprecipitated with the IL-6R, no tyrosine phosphorylation of this IRS-1 fraction was detectable in both IL-6- and insulin-stimulated cells (Fig. 5A). Similarly, we observed no tyrosine phosphorylation of co-precipitated IRS-1 in control cells (Fig. 5A). To further investigate the role of Ser-318, we transfe"

On the other hand, genes encoding several transcriptional factors, such as Fur, RcsA, SoxS, and ZraR, are up-regulated, and others, such as GadE, GadX, GcvA, and MetR, are down-regulated. Transcription of motility and cell division genes were altered, and consistent with this was the physiological analysis of cells overexpressing yddV,adiguanylatecyclase;thesecellsdisplayedanabnormalcelldivision process when high levels of c-di-GMP were present. We also show evidence that the diguanylate cyclase gene yddV is co-transcribed with dos,a heme base oxygen sensor with c-di-GMP-specific phosphodiesterase activity. A Δdos::kan mutation rendered the cells unable to divide properly,suggestingthatdosandyddVmaybepartofafine-tuningmechanism for regulating the intracellular levels of c-di-GMP. Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes use selected small molecules, commonly referred to as second messengers, to regulate cell function. The best known second messengers besides calcium are cyclic adenosine- and guanosine monophosphates, cAMP and cGMP, respectively. Prokaryotes and eukaryotes use cAMP, whereas cGMP is used primarily by eukaryotes. Recently, the guanine nucleotide, cyclic dinucleotide GMP (c-di-GMP 3The abbreviations used are: c-di-GMP, 3′,5′-cyclic diguanylic acid; PDE, phosphodiesterase; DGC, diguanylate cyclase(s); IPTG, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; RT, reverse transcription. 3The abbreviations used are: c-di-GMP, 3′,5′-cyclic diguanylic acid; PDE, phosphodiesterase; DGC, diguanylate cyclase(s); IPTG, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; RT, reverse transcription.; 3′,5′-cyclic diguanylic acid, cGpGp) (Fig. 1) was identified as a novel intracellular bacterial signaling molecule whose structure is known and consists of two cGMP molecules joined by a 3′,5′-phosphodiester bond (1Jenal U. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 2Ross P. Mayer R. Benziman M. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 35-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). c-di-GMP was first identified in Gluconacetobacter xylinus (formerly Acetobacter xylinum) and was shown to regulate cellulose production in this species (2Ross P. Mayer R. Benziman M. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 35-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ross P. Mayer R. Weinhouse H. Amikam D. Huggirat Y. Benziman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18933-18943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Amikam D. Benziman M. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6649-6655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which c-di-GMP binds to and activates the cellulose synthase BcsB. However, increasing evidence has demonstrated that c-di-GMP acts as an important signaling molecule in a variety of bacterial species influencing various aspects of physiology and behavior, such as motility, biofilm formation, virulence, and cell-cell interactions (for a review, see Ref. 5Romling U. Gomelsky M. Galperin M. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that c-di-GMP signaling is widespread and that, like cAMP and cGMP, it is a ubiquitous signaling molecule. However, little is known about the targets of this molecule in the cell or if it affects transcriptional regulation of certain genes. The intracellular levels of c-di-GMP are regulated by the opposing activities of two types of enzymes, diguanylate cyclases (DGC) and c-di-GMP phosphodiesterases (PDE) (3Ross P. Mayer R. Weinhouse H. Amikam D. Huggirat Y. Benziman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18933-18943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Tamayo R. Tischler A. Camilli A. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4774-4781Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). DGC converts two molecules of GTP via the linear intermediate diguanosine tetraphosphate (pppG3′p5′G) into c-di-GMP, and, by contrast, PDE hydrolytically cleaves the cyclic compound into GMP via the intermediate pG3′p5′G (2Ross P. Mayer R. Benziman M. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 35-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Tamayo R. Tischler A. Camilli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33324-33330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 7Schmidt A. Ryjenkov D. Gomelsky M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4774-4781Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The identification of two domains, GGDEF (the name of this domain is due to the conserved GG(D/E)(D/E)F amino acid sequence pattern) and EAL, shared by all of the DGC and PDE isoenzymes suggested that either or both domains were involved in the diguanylate cyclase activity (8Ausmees N. Mayer R. Weinhouse H. Volman G. Amikam D. Benziman M. Lindberg M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 204: 163-167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, the GGDEF domain is very abundant in the genomes of free living bacteria, but most of the GGDEF proteins have not yet been experimentally characterized (9Galperin M. Nikolskaya N. Koonin E. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 203: 11-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence by the groups of Römling and Gomelsky (7Schmidt A. Ryjenkov D. Gomelsky M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4774-4781Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 10Ryjenkov D. Tarutina M. Moskvin O. Gomelsky M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1792-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 11Simm R. Morr M. Kader A. Nimtz M. Romling U. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1123-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) unequivocally showed that GGDEF and EAL protein domains are involved in the c-di-GMP synthesis and hydrolysis, respectively. In addition, three very recent reports demonstrated that EAL domains are indeed Mg2+- or Mn2+-dependent cyclic diguanylate phosphodiesterases whose activity is inhibited by Ca2+ or Zn2+ (6Tamayo R. Tischler A. Camilli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33324-33330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 7Schmidt A. Ryjenkov D. Gomelsky M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4774-4781Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 12Christen M. Christen B. Folcher M. Schauerte A. Jenal U. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30829-30837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Interestingly, GGDEF and EAL domains are found only in bacteria and are not present in Archaea or Eukarya (13Galperin M. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 552-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that c-di-GMP-mediated signaling is an exclusive bacterial trait. It is noteworthy that proteins with GGDEF or EAL domains are reiterated in bacterial genomes; for example, Escherichia coli K-12 bears 19 proteins with the GGDEF domain and 17 with the EAL domain, but importantly, the GGDEF and EAL domains are usually found in multidomain proteins at the COOH-terminal end of often multiple sensory and signal transduction domains (5Romling U. Gomelsky M. Galperin M. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). In order to shed light on the regulatory mechanisms where c-di-GMP may be involved in the bacterial metabolism, here we report on the genome-wide transcriptional profile of Escherichia coli after an abrupt increase in c-di-GMP intracellular levels. It is shown that around 4% of the total genes are affected in their transcriptional activity and that high levels of c-di-GMP affect cellular processes, such as cellular division and motility. Based on these results, a phenotypic analysis of E. coli mutant strains with different levels of c-di-GMP was performed and revealed the existence of a mechanism for fine-tuning c-di-GMP levels. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, Phages, and Cell Growth—All of the strains used were E. coli K-12 derivatives with the exception of TOB1 strain, a fecal isolate (14Zogaj X. Nimtz M. Rohde M. Bokranz W. Romling U. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1452-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). The genotypes and sources of the relevant bacterial strains and plasmids are given in supplemental Table I. Luria-Bertani broth (LB) was prepared as previously described (15Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). A600 was determined in an Ultrospec 3100 Pro Amersham Biosciences spectrophotometer. Aerobic cultures were grown at 37 °C with shaking (200 rpm) in 250-ml flasks containing 10 ml of medium. The following antibiotic concentrations were used unless otherwise noted: ampicillin (200 μg ml-1) and kanamycin (100 μg ml-1). Cloning of yddV for Overexpression Experiments—Primers YddV-NcoI-5′ (5′-CCC AGC CTT ATA AGG GCC ATG GTT ATG GAG ATG TAT-3′) and YddV-SacI-3′(5-CTC TGA GCT CTG GCG CAT CTA AAG ACT GGC-3′) were used to PCR-amplify the whole yddV open reading frame to be inserted in frame into plasmid pSE420 (Invitrogen) previously cut with NcoI and SacI. Using this plasmid, the cloned yddV is under the regulation of the IPTG-inducible Ptrc promoter. To verify the cloned gene, the DNA sequence of all constructs was determined at the Molecular Biology Unit of the Cellular Physiology Institute (National University of Mexico). High Performance Liquid Chromatography—Cells were harvested at the indicated times from LB plus 1 mm IPTG cultures of strains with control vector or the expressing plasmid pYddV. Cells were extracted with 0.6 HClO4, denatured protein was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was neutralized with 5 m K2CO3 (16Amikam D. Steinberger O. Shkolnik T. Ben-Ishai Z. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 17Weinhouse H. Sapir S. Amikam D. Shilo Y. Volman G. Ohana P. Benziman M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The extracts were then filtered (throughout a 0.2-μm pore size). An equivalent to 150 mg of cells (wet weight) was subjected to HPLC analysis. HPLC was performed on a 250 × 4.6-mm LiChrosorb C-18 reversed-phase column at room temperature, detection at 252 nm on an HPLC Waters Millennium (Photo Diode Array, autosampler) apparatus. Running conditions were optimized using synthetic c-di-GMP as a reference. The c-di-GMP used as a standard was chemically synthesized in pure form by the use of a recently described novel synthesis method that produces a pure and high yield preparation of c-di-GMP diammonium salt (18Hayakawa Y. Nagata R. Hirata A. Hyodo M. Kawai R. Tetrahedron. 2003; 59: 6465-6471Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Before use, the purity and stability of lyophilized c-di-GMP were determined by first resuspending the molecule in 0.9% NaCl, creating a 2mm solution; the results were then confirmed by HPLC analysis and electrospray ionization-time-of-flight (mass spectrometry). Cell extract HPLC runs were carried out at 1 ml min-1, using a multistep gradient of acetonitrile. For the experiments on the kinetics of c-di-GMP synthesis (Fig. 4), samples were loaded on a 300 × 3.9-mm Waters Bondapack® C-18 reversed-phase column. RNA Extraction for DNA Microarray Experiments—Cultures of strains MG1655 transformed with plasmid pSE420 or pYddV were grown to midexponential phase on LB plus ampicillin (A600 = 0.3), IPTG (1 mm) was then added to the culture. After 2 h of incubation, cells were harvested by centrifugation, and total RNA was then extracted from the pellets using the hot acid phenol/chloroform method and treated with DNase I essentially as described on the World Wide Web at www.microarrays.org. Isolated RNA was quantified on the basis of its absorption at 260 nm, visualized on an agarose gel to check quality, and stored at -70 °C until further use. Microarray Procedures and Data Analysis—For microarray analyses, cDNA was synthesized and labeled using a protocol similar to that described by Rosenow et al. (19Rosenow C. Saxena R.M. Durst M. Gingeras T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: E112Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The labeled cDNA was hybridized to Affymetrix Gene Chip E. coli antisense genome arrays as recommended by the manufacturer (on the World Wide Web at www.affymetrix.com). Following 16 h of hybridization at 45 °C, the washing and stain of the array was automated by a GeneChip Fluidics Station controlled by Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 Software. For each condition, two biological replicates were done. The whole procedure was carried out at the Microarray facility of the National University of Mexico. Normalization of the data resulting from each array was performed using the Gen Arise software package (available on the World Wide Web at www.ifc.unam.mx/genarise/). The statistically significant variation of expression in response to high levels of c-di-GMP was obtained by filtering out those genes that had a log2 (expression ratio) higher or lower than two S.D. values of the average. Optical and Electron Microscopy—For optical microscopy, the samples were observed with a Nikon E-600 differential interference contrast microscope mounted with a Hamamatsu orca II camera using × 600 magnification. All images were processed using the Wasabi 1.4.0.2 and Adobe Photoshop 7.0 programs. For transmission electron microscopy, bacterial cell suspensions were applied on Formvar-coated grids. Samples were negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate and observed with a JEOL-1200EXII electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). Biofilm and Motility Assays—Biofilm assays were carried out at 37 °C using 96-well, non-tissue culture-treated polyvinyl chloride dishes (Costar, Cambridge, MA) or in borosilicate glass, as previously reported (20O'Toole G. Pratt L. Watnick P. Newman D. Weaver V. Kolter R. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 310: 91-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 21Corona-Izquierdo F. Membrillo-Hernández J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 211: 105-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Every experiment was performed in triplicate at least three times to confirm the results. To prevent evaporation, microtiter dishes were covered with a plastic box. Visualization of attached cells was performed by removing the cell culture, staining the wells with 1.0% crystal violet for 20 min, and rinsing the wells three times with distilled water. Similar results were obtained when nondistilled water or fresh LB medium was used for rinsing. Motility assays were performed on tryptone (1.3%), NaCl (0.7%), glucose (0.2%), agar (0.3%) plates as previously described (22Takeda S. Fujisawa Y. Matsubara M. Aiba H. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). DNA Manipulation—Bacterial genomic DNA was obtained using the Genomic DNA isolation kit (Promega). Plasmid DNA was purified using the Miniprep kit (Qiagen). DNA fragments were amplified by PCR using E. coli chromosomal DNA as template. Mutagenesis and Genetic Techniques—P1vir generalized transductions and transformations using the CaCl2 protocol were performed as described by Miller (15Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). In the gene inactivation experiments, the left flanking region of dos (1.1 kb) was PCR-amplified using primers MM11 (5′-GAT CGG GAA TTC TAC CAA TCA CCA GCA TAT C-3′) and MM12 (5′-ACG CAG GAT CCA CTG TCG CGT TAT TCA GG-3′). The right flanking region of dos (1.0 kb) was PCR-amplified using primers MM13 (5′-GAT TAG GAT CCC ATC CTG GCG CAT CTA AAG AC-3′) and MM14 (5′-GTT CGG ACT GCA GCG CCG CAG AAA AAC TTC AG-3′). The two PCR products were gel-purified using the QIAquick kit (Qiagen), digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes, repurified, and subjected to a four-fragment ligation mixture with a 1.3-kb BamHI-BamHI fragment containing the kanamycin resistance gene cassette from plasmid pUC4K-KIXX (Amersham Biosciences; supplemental Table I) and plasmid pTZ19R or pUC18 digested with EcoRI and PstI. T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen) was used under the conditions suggested by the manufacturer. After 18 h of incubation at 14 °C, the ligation mixture was used for transformation of strain XL1-blue (supplemental Table I), and selection was done on plates supplemented with ampicillin, kanamycin, and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). Plasmids from white colonies were purified, and those with the correct constructs, Δdos::kan, were linearized by digestion with EcoRI and used to transform strain JC7623 (supplemental Table I) to kanamycin resistance (Kanr). This strain efficiently recombines linear DNA into its chromosome (23Winans S. Elledge S. Krueger J. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 1219-1221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). P1vir lysates obtained from the selected Kanr recombinants were used to transduce the kan insertions into strains MC4100 and W3110. Chromosomal insertions were confirmed by PCR and by Southern blot (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). For the construction of a double ΔyddV-dos::kan mutant, the procedure of Chaveroche et al. (25Chaveroche M. Ghigo J. d'Enfert C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: E97Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) was followed using the following primers for the amplification of the adjacent sequences to the yddV-dos operon: YddV-GB-L3 (5′-GCA ATG TAA CAT CAG AGA TTT TGA GAC ACA ACG TGG CTT TCA TAA TTC ACA CCC TTA TAA GGC TGG G-3′) and YddV-GB-L3B (5′-CCG GAA CTG AAA AAG CAG CTC GAT CTT AAC G-3′) for the amplification of 0.5 kbp upstream from the translational start site of the yddV-dos operon and Dos-GB-L5 (5′-GCA ACA CCT TCT TCA CGA GGC AGA CCT CAG CGC CTG ACA AAT TCC TCT CGC CCG CAC TCG CGG GTT TTC-3′) and Dos-GB-L5B (5′-TTG CCA CAA CAT CGC CTG TGC TTG TTG TGG GCG-3′) for the amplification of 0.5 kbp downstream from the dos translational stop codon. The kanamycin cartridge was PCR-amplified from chromosomal DNA from strain JMH1232 (25Chaveroche M. Ghigo J. d'Enfert C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: E97Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) using Ampli-KAN-L5 (5′-GGG GGA AAG CCA CGT TGT GTC TCA A-3′) and Ampli-KAN-L3 (5′-GGG GGC GCT GAG GTC TGC CTC GTG A-3′). PCR products and plasmid DNA sequencing was carried out at the DNA sequencing facility of the Biomedical Research Institute (National University of Mexico). DNA Sequence Analyses—The GCG Wisconsin Package, NCBI BLAST (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/BLAST/), and the Colibri server (available on the World Wide Web at genolist.pasteur.fr/Colibri/) facilities were used for DNA sequence analyses. Isolation of RNA and RT-PCR Experiments—Total RNA was purified from late exponential phase cultures (RNAeasy kit Qiagen) of strain MC4100 grown aerobically on LB medium. Pure RNA preparations were treated with Sau3AI restriction enzyme for 1 h at 37°C, and the RNA was repurified. cDNA was synthesized using the OMNISCRIPT kit (Qiagen) with primers MM1 (5′-CGG GCT GAT ACC GCT GGC TTC GC-3′) or MM3 (5′-CGG TTG TGA CGA ATG TAT TCA GG-3′) (Fig. 6A). RT-PCR amplification was carried out using primers MM2 (5′-GAG GGG ATG AGT CGG GAG CTG C-3′) and MM4 (5′-CCG CCG TTT CCT ACC GAC TAT CT-3′), as described under “Results” (Fig. 6A). RT-PCR products were analyzed in a 1% agarose TBE 1× gel electrophoresis (Fig. 6B). Identification of yddV as a Diguanylate Cyclase—Genomic studies have identified 19 proteins with a GGDEF domain in E. coli (supplemental Table IV) (9Galperin M. Nikolskaya N. Koonin E. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 203: 11-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taking the amino acid sequence of DGC1 (diguanylate cyclase) from G. xylinus as template, we found that one of the closest matches (31% identical in the GGDEF domain) to this protein in E. coli was the product of the gene yddV, also named yhcK or b1490 (Fig. 2A). The main difference between YddV and DGC1 is the presence of a PAS (Drosophila period clock protein (PER), vertebrate aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), and Drosophila single-minded protein (SIM)) domain in DGC1 (2Ross P. Mayer R. Benziman M. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 35-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ausmees N. Mayer R. Weinhouse H. Volman G. Amikam D. Benziman M. Lindberg M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 204: 163-167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, two recent reports provided biochemical and genetic evidence that YddV has diguanylate cyclase activity, since it complemented a celR2 mutant of Rhizobium leguminosarum (8Ausmees N. Mayer R. Weinhouse H. Volman G. Amikam D. Benziman M. Lindberg M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 204: 163-167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and high levels of c-di-GMP were detected when a plasmid bearing yddV under the regulation of its native promoter was transformed into Salmonella enterica (11Simm R. Morr M. Kader A. Nimtz M. Romling U. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1123-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Then we decided to clone yddV under the control of an inducible promoter (Ptrc) in order to manipulate the intracellular c-di-GMP levels. yddV was cloned as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the DNA sequence of the cloned fragment was determined to check for any possible inserted mutations due to the PCR procedure (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2B, an increase in the expression of YddV was evident when 1 mm IPTG was added to the medium (lane 2). We determined that maximal YddV induction (as judged by the increase in the intensity of the band corresponding to YddV on a 10% SDS-PAGE) was observed when an exponentially growing culture (A600 = 0.3) was treated with 1 mm IPTG for 2 h (data not shown). To validate an increase in c-di-GMP levels, we performed HPLC of the cell extracts using chemically synthesized c-di-GMP as a standard (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 3A). As depicted in Fig. 3B, there was a clear increase of c-di-GMP levels in cell extracts of the E. coli strain overexpressing YddV. To confirm the identity of the major peak in our sample, we mixed the cell extract with the standard, and only one peak with a retention time of 8.7 was observed (Fig. 3C). No signals were detected when cell extracts from cultures of strains harboring the control vector were used (data not shown). To analyze the kinetics of c-di-GMP synthesis, we performed a similar HPLC analysis using extracts from cultures of strains bearing the plasmid vector pSE420 or the pYddV construct at different given times after the induction by IPTG. As shown in Fig. 4, a progressive accumulation of c-di-GMP was evident at 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 h after the addition of IPTG; by contrast, no c-di-GMP signal was detected in extracts from the strain bearing the control vector even after 5 h of induction (Fig. 4). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that our cloned gene yddV is indeed a diguanylate cyclase and that the induction of the gene yddV provokes an increase in c-di-GMP intracellular levels. In order to determine the transcription profile of E. coli under high levels of c-di-GMP, we decided to extract total RNA from cultures treated with IPTG for 2 h, since they were still in the exponential phase of growth (A600 = 0.7), in contrast to cultures with 3 or 5 h of induction that were already deep into the stationary phase (A600 = 1.8 and A600 = 2.1, respectively).FIGURE 3Detection and identification of c-di-GMP by HPLC. A, synthetic c-di-GMP used as a standard. B, cellular extracts of E. coli transformed with plasmid pYddV and treated with 1 mm IPTG for 2 h. C, a mixture of A and B. Samples were separated on reversed-phase HPLC. Extraction of nucleotides was carried out in cell extracts harvested as described for Fig. 1. See “Experimental Procedures” for details.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Genes Whose Transcription Is Altered by High Concentrations of c-di-GMP—Microarray analyses were carried out on RNA samples extracted from cultures of cells carrying the control vector or the plasmid bearing the yddV gene under the growth conditions described above (high levels of c-di-GMP). Results obtained from duplicate DNA microarray analyses were normalized and filtered for those genes with statistically significant variation of the transcription levels between the control and the high c-di-GMP conditions (i.e. log2 (expression ratio) higher or lower than 2 × S.D.). Of 4288 genes analyzed, 196 (4.5% of the genome) passed the filter and were further analyzed. These genes were divided into two groups, those that were induced and those that were repressed (109 and 87, respectively), and divided into functional categories based on NCBI, TIGR, and ECOCYC gene annotations and data base searches for identified homologues. The affected genes were dispersed through nearly all of the functional categories, the most striking being genes related to unknown proteins (divided into hypothetical conserved proteins, unclassified, and unknown; 35% of the total number of altered genes). The general metabolism was clearly affected; energy metabolism was the single functional category, with the highest number of genes showing significant transcriptional alteration (9%), closely followed by transport and binding proteins (8%). Genes involved in other metabolism, such as central intermediary metabolism or cellular processes, had percentages of 4 and 3%, respectively. A considerable number of genes involved in regulatory functions (4.5%) were affected, and the same was observed for biosynthesis of cofactors, prosthetic groups, and carriers (4%) and cell envelope-related proteins (6%). It is noteworthy that 25% of the altered genes (50 genes) code for membrane-bound proteins and that 6% are genes related to virulence. Genes Whose Transcription Is Induced by High Levels of c-di-GMP—Analysis of the genes induced by high c-di-GMP levels indicated that cell wall-modifying proteins were the highest induced under these culture conditions (supplemental Table II). Particularly interesting is the rcsA gene, encoding the transcriptional auxiliary protein RcsA involved in later stages of biofilm development and capsular polysaccharide synthesis (26Majdalani N. Gottesman S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 379-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 27Majdalani N. Heck M. Stout V. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6770-6778Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); the acrA gene, encoding a lipoprotein involved in cell wall biogenesis; b2056 (wcaD), a gene regulated by RcsA, involved in the regulation of colanic acid production (28Wehland M. Bernhard F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7013-7020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar); and nlpA, encoding for a putative surface antigen. This transcriptional profile may imply a dramatic change in the properties of the cell surface as a response to high levels of c-di-GMP (supplemental Table II). This is consistent with previous observations in S. enterica and Caulobacter crescentus (11Simm R. Morr M. Kader A. Nimtz M. Romling U. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1123-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 29Paul R. Weiser S. Amiot N. Chan C. Schirmer T. Giese B. Jenal U. Gen. Dev. 2004; 18: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2167938256,"UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UGDH) supplies the cell with UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcUA), a precursor of glycosaminoglycan and proteoglycan synthesis. Here we reported the cloning and the characterization of the UGDH from the amphibian Xenopus laevis that is one of the model organisms for developmental biology. We found that X. laevis UGDH (xUGDH) maintained a very high degree of similarity with other known UGDH sequences both at the genomic and the protein levels. Also its kinetic parameters are similar to those of UGDH from other species. During X. laevis development, UDGH is always expressed but clearly increases its mRNA levels at the tail bud stage (i.e. 30 h post-fertilization). This result fits well with our previous observation that hyaluronan, a glycosaminoglycan that is synthesized using UDP-GlcUA and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, is abundantly detected at this developmental stage. The expression of UGDH was found to be related to hyaluronan synthesis. In human smooth muscle cells the overexpression of xUGDH or endogenous abrogation of UGDH modulated hyaluronan synthesis specifically. Our findings were confirmed by in vivo experiments where the silencing of xUGDH in X. laevis embryos decreased glycosaminoglycan synthesis causing severe embryonic malformations because of a defective gastrulation process. UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UGDH) supplies the cell with UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcUA), a precursor of glycosaminoglycan and proteoglycan synthesis. Here we reported the cloning and the characterization of the UGDH from the amphibian Xenopus laevis that is one of the model organisms for developmental biology. We found that X. laevis UGDH (xUGDH) maintained a very high degree of similarity with other known UGDH sequences both at the genomic and the protein levels. Also its kinetic parameters are similar to those of UGDH from other species. During X. laevis development, UDGH is always expressed but clearly increases its mRNA levels at the tail bud stage (i.e. 30 h post-fertilization).

EC 1.1.1.22) catalyzes an NAD+-dependent, 2-fold oxidation of UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) to generate UDP-GlcUA (1Oppenheimer N.J. Handlon A.L. Enzymes. 1992; 20: 453-504Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In mammals, UDP-GlcUA is used in the biosynthesis of hyaluronan (HA) and the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (2Roden L. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans.in: Lennarz W.J. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1980Google Scholar). In addition, it is used in the liver where glucuronidation targets molecules for excretion (3Dutton G.J. Glucuronidation of Drugs and Other Compounds. CRC Press Inc, Boca Raton, FL1980Google Scholar). UDP-GlcUA also serves as a precursor to UDP-xylose, which provides a major component of the cell wall polysaccharides in plants (4D'Alessandro G. Northcote D.H. Biochem. J. 1977; 162: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and represents the initial sugar in GAG synthesis on proteoglycans. In many strains of pathogenic bacteria, such as group A streptoccoci and Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3, UDP-GlcUA is used in the construction of the antiphagocytic capsular polysaccharide (5Arrecubieta C. Lopez R. Garcia E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6375-6383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Dougherty B.A. van de Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7118-7124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). UGDH is of biochemical mechanistic interest because it belongs to a family of sugar nucleotidemodifying enzymes that catalyze a net four-electron oxidation and serve as both alcohol dehydrogenases and aldehyde dehydrogenases (7Ge X. Penney L.C. van de Rijn I. Tanner M.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The importance of UGDH is remarkable considering that its product, UDP-GlcUA, is critical for GAG synthesis. GAG chains of proteoglycans and HA are ubiquitous components of extracellular matrices and pericellular spaces, and an increasing body of information shows the role of GAGs in cell behavior, including signal transduction, cell proliferation, spreading, migration, cancer growth, and metastasis (8Iozzo R.V. San Antonio J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 9Selva E.M. Perrimon N. Adv.

Chem. 2002; 277: 4593-4596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Proteoglycans and HA have important roles throughout the development (11Princivalle M. de Agostini A. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 46: 267-278PubMed Google Scholar). As UGDH synthesizes UDP-GlcUA, one of the main UDP-sugar precursors, it is not surprising that alteration in UGDH expression causes evident phenotypes in developing embryos, as found by different authors in different model organisms. In particular, in Drosophila melanogaster UGDH is encoded by the sugarless gene and is required for heparan sulfate modification of proteins that control wing formation (12Hacker U. Lin X. Perrimon N. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 3565-3573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Caenorhabditis elegans, UGDH influences GAG synthesis, which is essential for vulval morphogenesis and embryonic development (13Hwang H.Y. Horvitz H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14224-14229Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14Hwang H.Y. Olson S.K. Esko J.D. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In Zebrafish, the enzyme is critical for normal cardiac development (15Walsh E.C. Stainier D.Y. Science. 2001; 293: 1670-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In mouse, UGDH mutants arrest growth during gastrulation with defects in migration of mesoderm and endoderm (16Garcia-Garcia M.J. Anderson K.V. Cell. 2003; 114: 727-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Moreover, a similar phenotype was found in mutants in the fibroblast growth factor pathway, highlighting that proteoglycans and GAGs facilitate signaling by mammalian growth factors. Another well known model organism extensively used in developmental biology is the amphibian Xenopus laevis. Although several papers report the critical role of proteoglycans in X. laevis development (17Galli A. Roure A. Zeller R. Dono R. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 4919-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Latinkic B.V. Mercurio S. Bennett B. Hirst E.M. Xu Q. Lau L.F. Mohun T.J. Smith J.C.

Dev. 1990; 32: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), very limited information is available on GAG functions in amphibian embryogenesis (23Mullegger J. Lepperdinger G. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2002; 61: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 24Koprunner M. Mullegger J. Lepperdinger G. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 25Haddon C.M. Lewis J.H. Development (Camb.). 1991; 112: 541-550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we have characterized the X. laevis UGDH (xUGDH), the key enzyme in GAG biosynthesis in this model organism, as suitable for developmental studies. Here we report the cDNA cloning of xUGDH, its biochemical kinetic parameters, its expression in developing embryos, and its genome organization. We have also extended our observations to Xenopus tropicalis, an organism of the same genus as X. laevis, but with interesting potential for genetic studies (26Beck, C. W., and Slack, J. M. (2001) Genome Biol. http://genomebiology.com/2001/2/10/reviews/1029Google Scholar). Our results show that the xUGDH expression in human cells increases their HA accumulation (and not that of other GAGs), whereas UGDH abrogation by siRNA reduced HA synthesis and cell-associated GAGs. Moreover, we have also demonstrated that UGDH has a crucial role during X. laevis development because xUGDH loss of function, by morpholino injection, causes lethal malformation. xUGDH Cloning—An X. laevis EST data bank was searched for homologies with human UGDH cDNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_003359) using the World Wide Web-based BLAST search engine (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/). IMAGE EST number 4202110 was found and was obtained from MRC geneservice (Cambridge, UK). DNA sequencing was done by an external service facility (BMR, Padua, Italy). Characterization of the xUGDH Gene—Introns of the X. laevis xUGDH gene were amplified with a pair of primers (Table 1) designed on the basis of mouse and human UGDH genomic sequences deposited in public data bases. PCR parameters were as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing for 30 s at the temperature indicated in Table 1, and elongation at 72 °C for 5 min for 35 cycles using 1.5 units of La-TAQ (a proofreading DNA polymerase from Takara) following the manufacturer's conditions. Amplification of intron 8 was done using Phusion™ polymerase (Finnzymes) in 6% Me2SO. PCRs were done on genomic DNA. Amplified intron lengths were determined by gel electrophoresis, and exon/intron boundaries were determined by sequencing the extracted bands from the gels.TABLE 1Sequence of the primers used in this work to amplify the indicated intronIntronPrimerSequence 5′-3′Annealing temperature °CIntron 1XEso1_upCGTGATTGCCCAAATGTGTC53XEso2_lowCAGCTTCCTGTATAGCTCCGTCTIntron 2XEso2_upGCCGAGGCAAGAATCTGTTT52XEso3_lowATCAAATATCCGCCGAATGCIntron 3XEso3_upTGCCAGAAGGATTGTCCAAA53XEso4_lowTCACATAGTGCACGCACAGCIntron 4XEso4_upACCGGGTGTTAATTGGTGGA53XEso5_lowTTCCTCCACATCTGCTCCTGIntron 5XEso5_upATGCTTTCCTTGCCCAGAGA53XEso6_lowTTGCCACTTCATGCAGGTTCIntron 6XEso6_upGCTGTTTCCAAAAGGATGTCTTG53XEso7_lowTGCAAAACCAAGGAGAGCAAIntron 7XEso7_upCAAGGATTATCGATTGCCTGTT53XEso8_lowCCCTTGGAACTTTGGGATCAIntron 8XEso8_upCCTCATGGATGAAGGTGCAA54XEso9_lowCCATTCGGTGCAGATAACCAIntron 9XEso9_upGCTGGTTCACATTTCTACGGATT53XEso10_lowTATTTTGCAGCTCGCCATGAIntron 10XEso10_upAGAATGATGTTGAAGCCAGCA53XEso11_lowGCAGGTCTTGCAAACCGAAT Open table in a new tab In silico determinations of the intron/exon structure of the human, mouse, and X. tropicalis UGDH genes were done by BLAST searches on the genomic data bases. Sequence manipulations and contig constructions were done using Vector NTI Suite 6 software. Recombinant xUGDH Expression and Purification—Cloning and transformation techniques were done essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A histidine-tagged xUGDH construct was generated by PCR. Briefly, the xUGDH ORF was amplified using Phusion DNA polymerase (Finnzymes) with the following primers: CCAAGGCTCGAGATGTTTCAGATTAAGAAGATTT and CCTTGGCTCGAGTTAAACTCTTTGTTTCTTATGAGGC (the sequences corresponding to XhoI recognition sites are underlined). The amplified product was digested with XhoI (Takara) and cloned into the XhoI-linearized pET-19b (Novagen) plasmid. This construct (pHisxUGDH) was then sequenced; it encodes the full-length xUGDH protein with an additional His6 tag sequence at the N terminus. For protein expression, the plasmid pHisxUGDH was transferred to the host BL21(DE3)pLysS E. coli strain (Promega). E. coli cells carrying the recombinant plasmid were cultivated at 37 °C in LB medium containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol (100 and 34 μg/ml final concentrations, respectively). After an overnight growth (A600 nm >2.5), IPTG was added at a final concentration of 1 mm. The temperature was reduced to 30 °C, and the cells were collected after 24 h. Cell extraction and His-tagged xUGDH purification were done using the B-Ter purification kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. Some determinations were done on crude extracts that were prepared lysing the bacterial cells in B-Ter solution (Pierce) and recovering the supernatant after centrifugation. xUGDH Assay—The enzymatic activity of purified His-tagged xUGDH was determined by monitoring the change in absorbance at 340 nm that accompanies reduction of NAD+ to NADH. The assay conditions were the same as those described previously by Sommer et al. (28Sommer B.J. Barycki J.J. Simpson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23590-23596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Gene Expression Studies—Total RNA from 21 X. laevis embryos (7 from three different females) at different stages of development were extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. One μg of total RNA from each extract was retrotranscribed using 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a (dT)16 primer at a concentration of 500 μg/ml. The reaction was done in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 500 μm of a dNTP mixture at 42 °C for 50 min. PCR amplifications of the cDNA samples were done using the first strand cDNA synthesis mixture, 25 pmol of primer xUGDH upper primer (CCCTTTGTGAGGCTACAGGA) and xUGDH lower primer (CGGTGCAGATAACCATAGCA), 200 μm dNTPs, and 1 unit of RedTaq polymerase (Sigma) in its own buffer. Reaction mixtures were subjected to eight touchdown cycles with annealing temperatures from 58 to 54 °C and subsequently with cycles using the following parameters: denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 53 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 40 s. As a control for genomic DNA contamination, all reactions were established with the control sample lacking reverse transcriptase. Normalization was done detecting cytoskeletal actin (upper primer, CTGAGTTCATGAAGGATCAC; lower primer, AAATTTACAGGTGTACCTGC) (29Vigetti D. Monetti C. Pollegioni L. Taramelli R. Bernardini G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 379: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) with the above described conditions. Quantitative real time RT-PCR was used in transfection experiments with aortic smooth muscle cells (AoSMC) (see below). Forty eight hours after transfections, total RNA samples were extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen) and retrotranscribed using the High Capacity cDNA synthesis kit (Applied Biosystems) for 2 h at 37°C. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on an ABi Prism 7000 instrument (Applied Biosystems) using the Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's instructions. Probe and primers were developed from TaqMan gene expression assay reagents (Applied Biosystems). The following human TaqMan gene expression assays were used: HAS1 (Hs00155410_m1), HAS2 (Hs00193435_m1), HAS3 (Hs00193436_m1), UGDH (Hs00163365_m1), and β-actin (Hs99999993_m1). Fluorescent signals generated during PCR amplifications were monitored and analyzed with ABi Prism 7000 SDS software (Applied Biosystems). Comparisons of the amounts of each gene transcript among different samples were made using β-actin as a reference. Standard curves were generated by serial dilution of cDNA, and as calculations of PCR efficiency were very similar (about 90%) for each gene assayed, the relative quantitative evaluation of target gene levels was determined by comparing ΔCt (Applied Biosystems user bulletin number 2). xUGDH Expression in Mammalian Cells—The xUGDH ORF was amplified using Phusion™ DNA polymerase (Finnzymes) with the following primers: TACTCGAGACCATGTTTCAGATTAAGAAGATTT and ATCTCGAGTTAAACTCTTTGTTTCTTATGAGGC. The boldface sequences correspond to XhoI recognition sites, and the underlined adenosine represents the typical -3 purine of the Kozak consensus sequence. The amplified product was purified, A-tailed using RedTaq (Sigma), and cloned into a pTarget (Promega) vector. Expression plasmids were selected to have the insert in the sense orientation to synthesize the complete xUGDH protein (pTarget-xUGDH sense) or to have the insert in the opposite direction used as the control vector (pTarget-xUGDH antisense). DNA sequencing and in vitro transcription and translation (TnT in vitro transcription/translation system, Promega) were done to check the constructs. AoSMCs (Cambrex) were grown in SmGm2 complete (supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum) culture medium (Cambrex). The cultures were maintained in an atmosphere of humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. 1 × 106 cells between passages 2 and 5 were transiently transfected by means of a Nucleofector apparatus (Amaxa) and the human aortic smooth muscle cells Nucleofector™ kit using 5 μg of either the sense or antisense expression plasmid. After 48 h, transfected cells and conditioned cell culture media were collected. Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with a protease inhibition mixture (Roche Applied Science) using a cell scraper. Protein contents in the cell lysates were determined using the Bradford method, and UGDH activities were measured as described above. Abrogation of Human UGDH—siRNA was used to reduce human UGDH expression in AoSMCs. UGDH siRNA (5′-GGACUAAAAGAAGUGGUAGGtt-3′) and negative control siRNA 1 kit (scramble, code 4611) were purchased from Ambion. Transfections were done using a Nucleofector™ apparatus (Amaxa) and the human AoSMC Nucleofector kit using an siRNA concentration of 50 μm of either UGDH siRNA or scramble siRNA. After 48 h of incubation, conditioned cell media were assayed for GAG contents by FACE analysis. The transfected cells were used for determination of UDP-sugars contents and UGDH activities. Quantitative real time RT-PCR was used to verify the reduction of UGDH mRNA expression. GAG Disaccharides and UDP-sugar Precursor Determinations—HA and chondroitin sulfate disaccharides were determined by FACE analysis as described previously (30Karousou E.G. Militsopoulou M. Porta G. De Luca G. Hascall V.C. Passi A. Electrophoresis. 2004; 25: 2919-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcUA were quantified by capillary zone electrophoresis using the methodology outlined by Lehmann et al. (31Lehmann R. Huber M. Beck A. Schindera T. Rinkler T. Houdali B. Weigert C. Haring H.U. Voelter W. Schleicher E.D. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, 106 AoSMCs were lysed in 0.1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100. After centrifugation, the supernatants were deproteinized by acetonitrile treatment, lyophilized, and resuspended in 90 mm borate buffer, pH 9. Analyses were done using a 75 cm × 50 μm column, 25-kV voltage, and detecting UDP-sugar absorbances at 262 nm. The peak identity was assessed by co-injecting the extracts with commercial UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcUA. GAG Determinations—To evaluate the amount of each GAG after induction or abrogation of UGDH, AoSMCs were transfected with pTarget-xUGDH constructs or siRNA, respectively, and labeled with [3H]glucosamine (25 μCi/ml) for 48 h in complete SmGm2 medium. Conditioned cell medium was recovered, and the unincorporated [3H]glucosamine was removed by gel filtration using a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences). The cell layer was washed with phosphatebuffered saline and scraped into 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The clear supernatant and the PD10 filtrated medium were digested with proteinase K (Finnzymes) at 50 °C. After 8 h of incubation, proteinase K was inactivated at 90 °C for 10 min. Each GAG solution was separated into 4 aliquots, precipitated by adding 4 volumes of ethanol at -20 °C for 18 h, and recovered by centrifugation. Two aliquots were resuspended in 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 7, and digested with 100 milliunits/ml of hyaluronidase SD from Streptococcus dysgalactiae (Seikagaku) and 100 milliunits/ml of chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku), respectively; one was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 4 mm CaCl2 and digested with 100 milliunits/ml of heparanase I, II, and III (Seikagaku). The last aliquot was used as an undigested control. After 16 h of incubation at 37 °C, which allow complete degradation of 20 μg/ml of standard GAGs, 50 μg of chondroitin sulfate A (Seikagaku) was added to each digested sample as carrier, and undigested GAGs were precipitated with ethanol. Specific GAGs were quantified by counting the radioactivity associated with digestion products (in the supernatant) and the undigested GAGs (pellet) with a liquid scintillation counter (Canberra Packard). xUGDH Silencing during X. laevis Development—Two antisense morpholino-oligonucleotides (MOs; Gene Tools LLC) were generated on the basis of the xUGDH cDNA sequence, xUGDH MO CATGGTTTATCTTGCTGAGAACAGA, which is complementary to the xUGDH translation start site and the adjacent coding sequence. A 5-mismatch MO, based on the xUGDH MO sequence, was used as a specificity control (CATcGTTTATgTTGgTGAcAAgAGA, where lowercase letters indicate mismatched nucleotides). The optimal morpholino concentration to inject per embryo was established by independent pilot experiments (not shown) and was determined to be in the range of 10-20 ng/embryo. The MOs were injected bilaterally at the two-cell stage to down-regulate the xUGDH activity in the whole embryo. All the experiments were performed by co-injecting the morpholino-oligonucleotide and the GFP mRNA (300 pg/embryo) as a tracer in order to select only the properly manipulated embryos for the subsequent analysis. Embryos were injected in 0.1× Modified Marc's Ringer solution (MMR) (100 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.8) supplemented with 4% Ficoll and then cultured in 0.1× MMR solution until the stage of analysis. xUGDH cDNA Cloning—In this study we focused our attention on UGDH, a pivotal enzyme in the production of UDP-GlcUA, an important precursor for GAG synthesis. It has been reported that UGDH is crucial in C. elegans and D. melanogaster morphogenesis (12Hacker U. Lin X. Perrimon N. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 3565-3573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hwang H.Y. Horvitz H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14224-14229Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and Zebrafish cardiac valve formation (15Walsh E.C. Stainier D.Y. Science. 2001; 293: 1670-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and is also involved in mouse gastrulation (16Garcia-Garcia M.J. Anderson K.V. Cell. 2003; 114: 727-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We reported previously the characterization of HA synthases (HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3) in X. laevis and showed their regulation during the early stages of development (34Vigetti D. Viola M. Gornati R. Ori M. Nardi I. Passi A. De Luca G. Bernardini G. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 35Nardini M. Ori M. Vigetti D. Gornati R. Nardi I. Perris R. Gene Expression Patterns. 2004; 4: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is also possible that UGDH, which provides one of the substrates for HAS, is regulated in the embryogenesis of this species. Therefore, we decided to clone X. laevis UGDH and characterize it. To obtain the sequence of the xUGDH mRNA, we initially performed a BLAST search using the human UGDH sequence against an X. laevis EST data base. This revealed several ESTs with a high degree of identity with the human sequences. We then obtained the largest EST (dbEST code 4202110) from MRC geneservice (Cambridge, UK); we completed the sequence and deposited in the public data base with GenBank™ accession number AY762616 (data not shown). This sequence has a 42-bp-long 5′-UTR and a 1482-bp-long ORF coding for a protein with 494 amino acids, a calculated molecular mass of 55,209.4 Da, and a calculated isoelectric point of 6.49. A PROSITE analysis (www.expasy.org/prosite/) and a NetPhos analysis (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos/) of the xUGDH amino acid sequence revealed several putative phosphorylation sites. Although we did not further investigate the possibility of posttranslation modifications in this enzyme, previous studies have reported that UGDH may be phosphorylated in prokaryotic cells (36Mijakovic I. Poncet S. Boel G. Maze A. Gillet S. Jamet E. Decottignies P. Grangeasse C. Doublet P. Le Marechal P. Deutscher J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4709-4718Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 37Grangeasse C. Obadia B. Mijakovic I. Deutscher J. Cozzone A.J. Doublet P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39323-39329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We searched for known signal peptides using the PSORT II program (www.psort.org/) without identifying any sorting sequence. xUGDH localization was predicted to be cytoplasmic with a 65.2% probability. Such a localization is consistent with a previous report that placed UGDH in the cytosol (13Hwang H.Y. Horvitz H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14224-14229Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequences of xUGDH and other known UGDH from several species are aligned (data not shown). The N-terminal region has the consensus sequence for NAD binding (i.e. GXGXXG) that is maintained with a high degree of identity among all the UGDH analyzed. The central region of the protein (i.e. GFGGSCFQKDVLN) has been proposed to be the catalytic domain (38Campbell R.E. Mosimann S.C. van de Rijn I. Tanner M.E. Strynadka N.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7012-7023Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and all the aligned sequences show a high degree of identity with only a minor amino acid substitution in the UGDH belonging to C. elegans, D. melanogaster, and soybean. Moreover, the critical cysteine residue, number 276 of xUGDH, is conserved in all sequences, and it has been shown to be involved during the second half-reaction of UGDH (i.e. conversion of UDP-aldehydroglucose to UDP-GlcUA) (28Sommer B.J. Barycki J.J. Simpson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23590-23596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). With respect to function/structure considerations, proline residues at positions 92 and 160 are believed to represent main bends in the protein structure (39Johansson H. Sterky F. Amini B.

Two lysine residues at positions 220 and 339 are also conserved, which correspond to lysine 219 and 338 of bovine UGDH. One of these lysine residues is probably catalytically involved in the first half-reaction of the enzyme (i.e. conversion of UDP-Glc to UDP-aldehydoglucose) (39Johansson H. Sterky F. Amini B.

Disaggregation of such aggregates is largely dependent on the Hsp100 and Hsp70 chaperones. The exact role of the Hsp70 chaperone machine (composed of DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE) in the Hsp100-dependent process remains unknown. In this study we focused on the Hsp70 role at the initial step of the disaggregation process. Two different aggregated model substrates, green fluorescent protein (GFP) and firefly luciferase, were incubated with the Hsp70 machine resulting in efficient fragmentation of large aggregates into smaller ones. Our data suggest that the observed fragmentation is achieved first by extraction of polypeptides from aggregates in Hsp70 chaperone machine-dependent manner and not by direct fragmentation of large aggregates. In the absence of Hsp100 (ClpB) these “extracted” polypeptides were not able to fold properly and promptly reassociated into new aggregates. The extracted GFP molecules were efficiently recognized and sequestered by a molecular trap, the mutant GroEL D87K, which binds stably to unfolded but not to native polypeptides. The binding of extracted GFP molecules to the GroEL trap prevented their reaggregation. We propose that the Hsp70 machine disentangles polypeptides from protein aggregates prior to Hsp100 action.

This phenomenon of acquired thermotolerance depends on the presence of the AAA+ (ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities) chaperones, e.g. ClpB in Escherichia coli (7Squires C.L.

AAA+ proteins self-assemble into oligomeric structures and use the energy from ATP hydrolysis to remodel their target substrates (11Vale R.D. J.

ClpB belongs to the Hsp100 family and consists of an N-terminal domain and two ATP binding domains, which are essential for ClpB hexamerization and chaperone function (12Krzewska J. Konopa G.

The first AAA+ domain contains an additional coiled-coil region called “middle domain” located C-terminally to ATP binding site that differentiates ClpB from other E. coli Hsp100 family members (17Schirmer E.C.

On the other hand, in vitro studies on the reactivation of aggregated proteins showed that ClpB or Hsp104 chaperones alone are not sufficient for disaggregation of aggregated substrates. The simultaneous presence of Hsp70 and co-chaperones is required for efficient substrate disaggregation and reactivation (20Glover J.R. Lindquist S.

Cell. 1990; 62: 939-944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar).The mechanism of Hsp100-Hsp70-dependent disaggregation of aggregated substrates is not fully understood yet. The requirement of ClpB protein in reactivation depends on aggregate properties and not necessarily on protein sequence. For some proteins (for example, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) varying denaturation conditions may lead to obtaining aggregates that are efficiently reactivated by Hsp70 system alone, or aggregates that require the presence of Hsp100 (29Diamant S. Ben-Zvi A.P. Bukau B. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21107-21113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Although those aggregates differ in size, it is not clear whether this is a factor determining ClpB requirement, or whether other physicochemical properties are involved. This ambiguity in ClpB requirement led initially to preliminary models that postulated interaction with ClpB as initial step that render ClpB-requiring aggregates into DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE-recognizable form (30Ben Zvi A.P. Goloubinoff P. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Only recently have our kinetic studies (31Zietkiewicz S. Krzewska J. Liberek K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44376-44383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and the elegant work from Bukau and co-workers (32Weibezahn J. Tessarz P. Schlieker C. Zahn R.

Additionally, the studies of the Bukau and co-workers (32Weibezahn J. Tessarz P. Schlieker C. Zahn R. Maglica Z. Lee S. Zentgraf H. Weber-Ban E.U. Dougan D.A. Tsai F.T.F. Mogk A. Bukau B. Cell. 2004; 119: 653-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) determined that polypeptides are translocated through the 16 Å axial channel present in the ClpB hexameric structure (33Lee S. Sowa M.E. Watanabe Y.H. Sigler P.B. Yoshida M. Tsai F.T. Cell. 2003; 115: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The importance of integrity of the channel for the disaggregating activity of ClpB was shown by mutagenesis studies (34Schlieker C. Weibezahn J. Patzelt H. Tessarz P. Strub C. Zeth K. Erbse A. Schneider-Mergener J. Chin J.W. Schultz P.G. Bukau B. Mogk A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 35Lum R. Tkach J.M. Vierling E. Glover J.M. J. Biol.

Lindquist S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 4-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For example, the role of the Hsp70 machine at the initial step of disaggregation reaction is unknown. One of the possible mechanisms assumes that the Hsp70 chaperone system is involved in proper positioning of ClpB at aggregates. Then the properly positioned ClpB uses its “crowbar” activity for remodeling of aggregates. The large coiled-coil middle domain of ClpB, characteristic for a subfamily of Hsp100 chaperones, was postulated to be important for such ClpB activity, because the mutagenesis studies (33Lee S. Sowa M.E. Watanabe Y.H. Sigler P.B. Yoshida M. Tsai F.T. Cell. 2003; 115: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) determined that the mobility of this domain is critical for ClpB-dependent disaggregation. In another scenario the Hsp70 machine performs a more active function at the initial step of disaggregation (31Zietkiewicz S. Krzewska J. Liberek K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44376-44383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).In this study we focus our attention into the role of the Hsp70 machine in these initial steps of protein disaggregation. To do this, two different substrates, whose disaggregation is dependent on the simultaneous presence of both the Hsp70 and Hsp100 chaperones, were incubated with the Hsp70 chaperone machine. In both cases this resulted in efficient fragmentation of large aggregates into much smaller ones. Taken together, our data suggest that the observed fragmentation of aggregates is achieved through the Hsp70-dependent extraction of polypeptides from aggregates. In the absence of ClpB these polypeptides are not able to fold properly and reassociate into new aggregates. We postulate that the Hsp70 machine disentangles polypeptides from protein aggregates prior to Hsp100 action.MATERIALS AND METHODSProtein Purification and Concentrations—Published protocols were used for the purification of E. coli DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE (37Zylicz M.

Protein concentrations were determined with the BioRad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Molar concentrations are given assuming a hexameric structure for ClpB, 14-mer for GroEL, heptameric for GroEL D87K, and a monomeric structure for the rest of proteins.Sedimentation Analysis—Experiments were performed essentially as previously described (27Liberek K. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11019-11023Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (100 μl) contained native or heat-aggregated GFP (2.2 μm) and chaperones, 4.4 μm DnaK, 0.34 μm DnaJ, 0.45 μm GrpE, and 3.3 μm ClpB as indicated, in buffer A (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 85 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm ATP or other indicated nucleotide), and were assembled on ice. After a 15-min incubation at 25 °C the reaction mixtures were applied on a 3.5-ml 15–45% (v/v) glycerol gradient in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol buffer containing 1 mm nucleotides, where indicated. Gradients were centrifuged at 4 °C in a Beckman SW 60 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 2 h; fractions were collected from the top. Proteins present in fractions and at the bottom of the centrifugation tube were separated by SDS-PAGE. GFP was visualized by Western blot using anti-GFP monoclonal mouse antibodies (Roche Applied Science) and a chemiluminescent detection system (SuperSignal West Pico, Pierce). Polyclonal rabbit antibodies (Sigma) were used for luciferase. Luciferase aggregates were obtained by incubation of 60 μm luciferase for 60 min at 30 °C in 2 m guanidine-HCl in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 15 mm Mg-acetate and subsequent dilution on ice into buffer without denaturant. Native or aggregated luciferase (1 μm) was used for reaction with chaperones and sedimentation.In the experiments presented in Figs. 3, 4, 5, gradients were centrifuged for 16 h. Reaction mixtures in Figs. 4 and 5 were incubated for 5 min with chaperone proteins (KJEB and KJE, respectively) before GroEL D87K (5.5 μm) was added. Incubation proceeded for another 40 min before the reactions were sedimented.FIGURE 4GroEL-trap inhibits K/J/E-ClpB-dependent disaggregation of thermally aggregated GFP by binding to GFP polypeptides.

Chromatography was carried out at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min at 4 °C. Fractions (400 μl) were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis for GFP. The column was characterized by sizing intact E. coli cells overproducing GFP for void volume determination, acetone for the total volume of the column, and dextran blue as the 2-MDa standard.Spontaneous Folding of Acid-denatured GFP—Twenty ml of acid-denatured GFP (in 10 mm HCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mm EDTA) were added to a cuvette (GFP at 25 nm final concentration) containing 400 ml of buffer B (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol) and, where indicated, GroEL or GroEL-trap (125 nm). After 2 min ATP was added to 10 mm concentration. Spontaneous folding of GFP, manifested by an increase in fluorescence, was measured in a PerkinElmer LS50B spectrofluorometer (excitation at 395 nm, emission recorded at 510 nm, 5.5 nm excitation and 10 nm emission slits). The fluorescence was proportional to the native GFP concentration.GFP Disaggregation Experiments—Experiments were performed as described previously (31Zietkiewicz S. Krzewska J. Liberek K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44376-44383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, disaggregation reactions were performed at 25 °C in a spectrofluorometric cuvette (final volume 450 μl) in buffer A with 5 mm ATP. The reactivation was started by the addition of thermally denatured GFP (0.5 μm) to the cuvette containing 1 μm DnaK, 0.2 μm DnaJ, 0.1 μm GrpE, 0.65 μm ClpB and, where indicated, GroEL (2.5 μm) and GroES (2.5 μm). GroEL D87K (“GroEL-trap,” 2.5 μm) was added after 5 min of reactivation by KJEB. GFP fluorescence was recorded as described above.Light Scattering Experiments—Light scattering experiments were essentially performed as described in Ref. 31Zietkiewicz S. Krzewska J. Liberek K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44376-44383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar. Light scattering was measured in a PerkinElmer LS50B spectrofluorometer with the excitation and emission set at 550 nm. The entrance and emission slits were set to 5 nm. The solution of chaperones was subjected to a short spin prior to addition to cuvette.RESULTSInfluence of the Hsp70 Chaperone Machine on the Macroscopic Properties of Aggregates—Recent reports on kinetic (31Zietkiewicz S. Krzewska J. Liberek K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44376-44383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and mechanistic (32Weibezahn J. Tessarz P. Schlieker C. Zahn R.

Cell. 2004; 119: 653-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) aspects of protein disaggregation placed the Hsp70 chaperone machine at a step prior to Hsp100 action during the initial stages of the reaction. We decided to investigate in detail the role of the Hsp70 chaperone machine (DnaK, DnaJ and GrpE; referred to as K/J/E) during these initial steps. We selected GFP as our model substrate because heat-induced aggregates require both K/J/E and ClpB chaperones for efficient disaggregation and reactivation (31Zietkiewicz S. Krzewska J. Liberek K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44376-44383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We started by first investigating the influence of the K/J/E chaperone machine on macroscopic properties of GFP aggregates. The sedimentation analysis conditions (15–45% glycerol gradient, 40,000 rpm, Beckman SW 60 rotor, 2 h) were chosen in such a way that soluble proteins barely enter the gradient because of their relatively low sedimentation coefficient and the short time of sedimentation. Conversely, these conditions allow separation of much larger structures such as protein aggregates. Consequently, the majority of heat-induced GFP aggregates reached the bottom of the tube while the rest were found in fractions close to the bottom (Fig. 1A). However, when GFP aggregates are incubated with K/J/E in the presence of ATP prior to sedimentation, their distribution pattern changes strikingly and nearly all GFP is found in fractions 4–9 (Fig. 1A) close to the top of the gradient. In contrast, incubation of aggregated GFP with ClpB alone does not change the sedimentation pattern (result not shown). Native GFP sediments at the top of the gradient under these conditions (fraction 1) (Fig. 1A), whereas the bacterial RNA polymerase, a multisubunit protein (β,β′,2α; Mw ∼ 400 kDa) is found in fraction 3.FIGURE 1Modulation of the macroscopic properties of aggregated proteins by the Hsp70 chaperone machine. A, GFP aggregates incubated with K/J/E chaperones sediment slowly. Aggregated GFP was incubated with DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE, and 5 mm ATP and subjected to sedimentation (2 h) in a glycerol gradient (GFPD + KJE). GFP in gradient fractions was visualized by Western blot following SDS-PAGE. The asterisk marks the position of the bacterial RNA polymerase, a marker protein.

The panel shows Western blots of gradient fractions for the native luciferase (LucN), aggregated luciferase (LucD), or LucD incubated with DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE, and 5 mm ATP, after sedimentation, as in A above. C, GFP aggregates are substantially smaller after incubation with K/J/E chaperones. Native, heat-aggregated GFP or heat-aggregated GFP incubated with DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE, and 5 mm ATP were subjected to sizing chromatography on Sephacryl S-500 HR. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and GFP was detected by a Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To extend our analysis to other substrates, a similar sedimentation was performed for firefly luciferase. Luciferase aggregates were obtained by denaturation in guanidine hydrochloride and dilution into the buffer without denaturant. Similarly to GFP, luciferase disaggregation depends on the presence of both K/J/E and ClpB. Following sedimentation, luciferase aggregates are found at the bottom of the tube (Fig. 1B). Incubation with K/J/E and ATP generates a pool of luciferase aggregates, which migrate slowly and are found in fractions 3–7 of the gradient (Fig. 1B). However, these aggregates sediment considerably faster than native luciferase (fractions 1 and 2) and the marker RNA polymerase (fraction 3) (Fig. 1B).Thus, experiments performed with two different aggregated substrates showed a similar change in sedimentation pattern. The incubation of GFP or luciferase aggregates with the Hsp70 chaperone machine generates aggregates that sediment substantially slower than the initial ones. Most likely this results from a decrease in the average size of aggregates. Alternatively, a major change in the surface properties of these aggregates could increase the frictional force, resulting in a change in the sedimentation pattern. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we performed sizing chromatography on a Sephacryl S-500 HR column, which according to manufacturer's specifications fractionates particles up to 20 MDa. The majority of aggregated GFP eluted in the void volume of the column (Fig. 1C). Incubation of GFP aggregates with K/J/E prior to sizing chromatography resulted in a substantial decrease in the size of aggregates (Fig. 1C). Thus, we concluded that following incubation with the Hsp70 chaperone machine the protein aggregates become substantially smaller. The combined results of sedimentation and filtration analysis allowed us to estimate that, following the action of the K/J/E chaperone machine, GFP aggregates (on average larger than 1 MDa) consisted of several GFP monomers.Conversion of Aggregates Relies on the ATP-dependent Action of the Complete Hsp70 Chaperone Machine—We next asked whether all three chaperones of the Hsp70 machine, namely DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE, are required for the observed transformation of aggregates. Heat-induced GFP aggregates, incubated in the presence of ATP and different combinations of chaperones (K/E or K/J or J/E), were sedimented as described above, and the pellet at the bottom of the gradient tube was analyzed. Only when all three K/J/E chaperones were present during incubation did the GFP aggregates efficiently fragment and were therefore missing from the bottom fraction (Fig. 2A). Omission of either DnaK or DnaJ blocked the fragmentation of aggregates (Fig. 2A). However, when GrpE was omitted from the reaction mixture, the fragmentation of GFP aggregates was observed, yet was less efficient (Fig. 2A). Replacement of DnaJ by the mutant DnaJ259 also prevented the fragmentation of aggregates (Fig. 2A). The DnaJ259 protein possesses an amino acid substitution (a conserved histidine to a glutamine) within the strictly conserved so-called “J domain.” The mutant is defective in stimulation of the ATPase activity of DnaK but not in interaction with substrate proteins (40Wall D.

In this study, we investigated the role of the AEA-degrading enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) in AEA-induced cell death in the liver. Primary hepatocytes expressed high levels of FAAH and were completely resistant to AEA-induced cell death, whereas primary hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) expressed low levels of FAAH and were highly sensitive to AEA-induced cell death. Hepatocytes that were pretreated or with the FAAH inhibitor URB597 isolated from FAAH<sup>-/-</sup> mice displayed increased AEA-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and were susceptible to AEA-mediated death. Conversely, overexpression of FAAH in HSCs prevented AEA-induced death. Since FAAH inhibition conferred only partial AEA sensitivity in hepatocytes, we analyzed additional factors that might regulate AEA-induced death. Hepatocytes contained significantly higher levels of glutathione (GSH) than HSCs. Glutathione depletion by dl-buthionine-(<i>S</i>,<i>R</i>)-sulfoximine rendered hepatocytes susceptible to AEA-mediated ROS production and cell death, whereas GSH ethyl ester prevented ROS production and cell death in HSCs. FAAH inhibition and GSH depletion had additive effects on AEA-mediated hepatocyte cell death resulting in almost 70% death after 24 h at 50 μm AEA and lowering the threshold for cell death to 500 nm. Following bile duct ligation, FAAH<sup>-/-</sup> mice displayed increased hepatocellular injury, suggesting that FAAH protects hepatocytes from AEA-induced cell death <i>in vivo</i>. In conclusion, FAAH and GSH are determinants of AEA-mediated cell death in the liver."

https://openalex.org/W2073838595,"RET is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) with roles in cell growth, differentiation and survival. Ligand-induced activation of RET results in stimulation of multiple signal transduction pathways, including the MAP kinase/Erk and PI3 kinase/Akt pathways. However, the mechanisms governing receptor internalization and signal down- regulation have not been explored. As other RTKs are internalized through the clathrin-coated pit pathway in a ligand-dependant manner, we have investigated whether RET is internalized through a similar process. Using a highly sensitive fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay, we have shown that RET is internalized from the plasma membrane in a ligand-dependant manner that requires RET kinase activity as well as the GTPase activity of the clathrin-coated vesicle scission protein dynamin 2. Further, we have demonstrated that RET colocalizes with Rab5a, a marker of clathrin-coated vesicles and early endosomes, after internalization. Finally, we demonstrated that RET internalization is required for complete activation of Erk1/2, but not for activation of Akt signaling. Our data suggest that ligand-induced internalization of RET not only plays an overall role in downregulation and termination of signaling, but also functions to traffic RET to subcellular locations where it can fully activate certain downstream signaling pathways."

The mucin-type core 2 beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (C2GnT-M) is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and catalyses the formation of core 2, core 4, and blood group I branches on O-glycans. In the present study, we evaluated the role of C2GnT-M in colorectal cancer. C2GnT-M downexpression was observed in 73.6% of the primary tumors from colorectal cancer patients (39 of 53) analysed by cancer profiling array. Consistently, the majority of colon cancer cell lines and primary colon tumors expressed lower levels of C2GnT-M than did normal colon tissues by RT-PCR. HCT116 cells stably transfected with C2GnT-M inhibited expression of the core 1 structure, Galbeta1,3GalNAcalpha1-Ser/Thr, on the cell surface. Moreover, C2GnT-M expression suppressed cell adhesion, motility, and invasion as well as colony formation ability. The growth of C2GnT-M-transfected HCT116 and SW480 cells was dramatically suppressed, and the cell death induced by C2GnT-M was demonstrated by an increase in the annexin V-positive cells. Interestingly, C2GnT-M inhibited cell adhesion to collagen IV and fibronectin, and decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, indicating that the changes in cancer behavior may be partly mediated by integrin-signaling pathways. Tumor growth in vivo was also significantly suppressed by C2GnT-M in the xenografts of nude mice. These results demonstrate that C2GnT-M is frequently downregulated in colorectal cancer and suppresses colon cancer cell growth."

As an alternative strategy for understanding the distinctive membrane biology of T. pallidum (2Cox D.L. Chang P. McDowall A. Radolf J.D. Infect.

Van Der Heide H.G. Van Embden J.D. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 3536-3546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have obtained structural and biochemical evidence that Tp0319 likely is a periplasmic purine nucleoside receptor in T. pallidum. Hence, Tp0319 (TmpC) has been renamed herein as purine nucleoside receptor A (PnrA). Furthermore, PnrA appears to be a member of the ABC superfamily and, as such, represents the first description of a periplasmic purine nucleoside-binding protein of its type in bacteria. The overall importance of PnrA as an ABC-type receptor tethered to the cytoplasmic membrane (via its lipid anchors) and implications of PnrA for treponemal survival within the human host are discussed. These findings add to our knowledge of key physiological functions for the treponemal membrane lipoproteins and their relationship to T. pallidum membrane biology. Construction of His6-tagged rTp0319—To create a non-acylated derivative of recombinant Tp0319 (rTp0319) in Escherichia coli, a fragment encoding amino acids 2-333 (residue 1 is the post-translationally modified N-terminal cysteine) was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA isolated from the virulent Nichols strain of T. pallidum. The PCR primers were 5′-ctaGAATTCTCTAAGAGCGACAGGCCG-3′ and 5′-cttCTCGAGTTATTAGTTCATCATTGCGTGCAGATC-3′. In the preceding sequences, the region of each primer complementary to the tp0319 sequence is underlined. The forward primer contained both a cta overhang and an EcoRI site (bolded); the reverse primer contained a ctt overhang and a XhoI site (boldface). PCR was performed using TaKaRa Ex Taq DNA polymerase at an annealing temperature of 55 °C. The amplification product was directionally cloned into the pProEX HTa vector (Invitrogen), which adds an N-terminal His6 tag followed by a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site. Ligations were transformed into E. coli XL1-Blue-competent cells (Stratagene); plasmids from colonies that tested positive by restriction digest were sequenced for verification. Expression and Purification of rTp0319—E. coli XL1-Blue cells harboring the cloned tp0319 gene fusion were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin until the cell density reached an A600 of 0.6. The temperature of the culture was then shifted to 30 °C, and overexpression of rTp0319 was achieved by induction for 5 h with 600 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed at room temperature for 30 min using 50 ml of B-PER II (Pierce) per liter of culture. After centrifugation at 25,000 × g, the supernatant was immobilized on a Ni2+ affinity column and washed with 10 column volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole (pH 8.5) (buffer A), followed by 10 column volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 m NaCl (pH 8.5) and 5 column volumes of buffer A. The rTp0319 protein was eluted from the column using 20 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole (pH 8.5). The sample buffer was exchanged to 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm octyl β-glucoside (buffer B) by using a MW 10,000 exclusion Amicon concentration device. Concentrated protein was further purified on an Äkta fast-performance liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) by size exclusion using a Superdex 75 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with buffer B (4 °C). Subsequent to elution, peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, which established that the protein was purified to apparent homogeneity. As a prelude to protein crystallization, fractions containing purified rTp0319 were pooled in buffer B and concentrated to 15 mg/ml. For the production of selenomethionine-labeled protein, the expression vector was transformed into the methionine auxotroph E. coli B834 (Novagen), which was then grown in 5% LB plus 95% M9 medium supplemented with 125 mg/liter each of adenine, uracil, thymine, and guanosine, 2.5 mg/liter thiamine, 4 mg/liter d-biotin, 20 mm glucose, 2 mm MgSO4, 50 mg/liter each of 19 l-amino acids (excluding methionine), and 50 mg/liter l-selenomethionine (Sigma). Protein purification was accomplished as described above with the addition of 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The concentration of purified protein was estimated from a calculated molar extinction coefficient of 24,300 m-1 cm-1 at 280 nm (20Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Prot. Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar). Protein N-terminal sequencing was performed by Edman degradation in an Applied Biosystem model 494 automated protein sequencer. Proteomic and sequence analysis tools, available at the ExPASy proteomics server, were used for protein and DNA sequence analyses. Preparation of Ligand-free Protein—To remove endogenously bound nucleoside from rTp0319, the protein was subjected to reversible denaturation/renaturation. Approximately 10 mg of purified protein immobilized on 2 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads was denatured for 2 h by gentle rocking in 100 ml of denaturation buffer containing 8 m urea, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min and then were washed with 100 ml of the above buffer to remove unbound ligands. This step was repeated with 100 ml each of 1:1 and 1:3 diluted denaturation buffer. For renaturation, protein bound to beads was suspended in 100 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole (pH 8.5) and incubated for1hwith gentle agitation. The slurry was then poured into a column, and the protein was eluted with the above buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. Protein buffer was exchanged with 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm octyl β-glucoside (buffer C) by using a Mr 10,000 size exclusion concentration device (Amicon). Refolded, concentrated protein was further purified by gel filtration chromatography (as described above) and designated as ligand-free (LF)-rTp0319. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Binding of ligands to LF-rTp0319 was analyzed by measuring heat changes during the titration of ligand into the protein solution (in buffer C) using a VP-ITC titration micro-calorimeter (Microcal, Inc.). The concentration of LF-rTp0319 and ligands were obtained spectrophotometrically using a calculated extinction coefficient for LF-rTp0319; extinction coefficients for the individual ligands were provided by the supplier (Sigma). The titrations were carried out at 20 °C with the 1.4-ml stirred reaction cell containing ∼20 μm protein in all experiments. A series of 30-32 injections (6-8 μl each) of ligand at concentrations ranging from 200 to 500 μm were applied to the cell, and the heat resulting from binding was monitored until the protein was saturated with ligand. Association constants and thermodynamic parameters were fitted to these data using the program Microcal-ORIGIN. The data reported are the average of at least three measurements. Protein Crystallization—Crystals of rTp0319 or LF-rTp0319 with various nucleosides, or the selenomethionyl variant of rTp0319, were obtained by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method (21Brunger A.T.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). Sparse matrix crystallization schemes (Hampton Research) were used to screen preliminary conditions. In some conditions, long, rod-shaped crystals with dimensions up to 0.1 mm × 0.1 mm × 1 mm appeared within 2-4 days. The most suitable crystals were routinely obtained in drops containing 2.5 μl of protein (starting concentration of 15 mg/ml in buffer B) and 2.5 μlof0.2 m ammonium acetate, 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 4.6), and 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 (20 °C). Crystals were cryoprotected in 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol-enriched crystallization reagent containing 32% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, flash-cooled in liquid propane, and were stored in liquid nitrogen. Crystals exhibited the symmetry of space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions of a = 56 Å, b = 69 Å, c = 70 Å and contained one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Structure Determination and Refinement—Diffraction data were collected at the beamlines 19-ID and 19-BM (Structural Biology Center Collaborative Access Team) at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL) and processed with HKL2000 software (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). To facilitate phase calculations, diffraction data were collected from a crystal of the selenomethionyl variant of rTp0319. These data were collected at two wavelengths that corresponded to the peak and inflection points of an x-ray fluorescence scan of a selenomthionyl rTp0319 crystal conducted near the K-edge of x-ray absorption of selenium. Using diffraction data to 4.0 Å, 12 of 14 possible selenium sites were located using the program CNS (21Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). Utilizing data to 2.01 Å, phase refinement and density modification were performed via the programs MLPHARE and dm (Collaborative Computational Project 4). A preliminary model for 289 residues was automatically generated using the program ARP/wARP (23Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 269-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), and 241 of these were docked to the sequence. A native data set was collected to a 1.71 Å resolution and employed for further model building via programs O (24Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) and XtalView (25McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar); refinement using CNS resulted in an Rwork of 18.1% and an Rfree of 21.1% for 316 total residues. Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. The initial electron density maps for the LF-Tp0319 loaded with exogenous adenosine (LF-A) or LF-Tp0319 loaded with exogenous guanosine (LF-G) were calculated after rigid-body refinement of the LF-Tp0319 model using the LF-A or LF-G data sets. Refinement proceeded as outlined above.

Immun. 1992; 60: 1568-1576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was extracted from the spirochetes using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). To remove residual contaminating DNA, the RNA was then subjected to further treatment with a TURBO DNA-free kit (Ambion). The quantity of RNA obtained was determined spectrophotometrically. RT-PCR was used to evaluate the potential transcriptional linkage of tp0319 to four downstream open reading frames (tp0320-0323). Oligonucleotide primer pairs for RT-PCR were designed (Table 2) to enable synthesis of PCR products in the range of 400 to 800 bp that would span one or more of the intergenic regions of the open reading frames (Fig. 7). The StrataScript two-tube RT-PCR system (Stratagene) was used first to synthesize treponemal cDNA via random priming. cDNA was generated by incubating ∼400 ng of T. pallidum RNA in a 50-μl reaction for 90 min at 44 °C. One μl of the cDNA was then used as template for the specific oligonucleotide primer pairs (Table 2). Each RT-PCR reaction was accompanied by a positive control reaction that utilized the same set of primers and 20 ng of T. pallidum genomic DNA. Template DNA was extracted from 5 × 1010 spirochetes using a Qiagen DNA extraction kit. An additional negative control reaction was also performed in which 10 ng of T. pallidum RNA was used as template in the absence of RT. All resulting PCR products were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide.TABLE 2Oligonucleotide primers used for RT-PCR in this studyPrimer name5′ to 3′ sequenceTp319–5′CGATCGTCGTCTCAATGGTCAGGACTp0320–3′CCGCAGAAGAAGAACGCATACTp0321–3′CGGACTACGGATGCACACACTp0321–5′GTACCCTTTCAGGAGGTAATCAGCTp322–3′CCTGAAGTTCCACACGGACCTGCCTp0322–5′GCAACGAGCATTTCGGGTATGTTp0323–3′CCTGCGTTCCCTGCTGC Open table in a new tab Expression and Purification of rTp0319—To obtain sufficient quantities of rTp0319 for crystallization, a recombinant (r) DNA-derived, soluble form of rTp0319 was generated lacking the N-terminal Cys acylation site. rTp0319 also contained an N-terminal His6 fusion peptide linked to the mature protein via 23 spacer residues. This soluble derivative was expressed at high levels in E. coli, and the protein was purified to greater than 95% homogeneity by nickel-affinity and size-exclusion chromatography; typical yields were in the range of 10-15 mg per liter of cell culture. Size-exclusion chromatography also revealed that rTp0319 exists as a monomer in solution (data not shown). Structural Overview of rTp0319—rTp0319 is comprised of 361 amino acid residues, 29 of which are vector derived. Crystals of rTp0319 were obtained readily and diffracted to a maximum resolution of 1.7 Å. After building a model into the electron density maps derived from x-ray diffraction data from rTp0319 crystals, it was apparent that a significant portion of the N-terminal part of rTp0319 was not present. To determine whether proteolytic processing and/or N-terminal disorder were responsible for this phenomenon, crystals of rTp0319 were dissolved and subjected to N-terminal sequencing. This analysis indicated that cleavage had occurred between residues 13 and 14 of the mature protein. The crystalline rTp0319 protein was therefore devoid of 41 N-terminal amino acid residues (12 of these from the mature rTp0319). In addition, residues 14-17 are not visible in electron density maps, presumably due to disorder. Residues 18-333 are visible in electron density maps and are included in the rTp0319 model. The crystal structure of rTp0319, which was refined using diffraction data to 1.7 Å, is shown in Fig. 1. The crystal structure obtained for residues 18-333 revealed a polypeptide with two domains, designated herein as “N” or “C”, which denote the domain that harbors either the N terminus or the C terminus, respectively (Fig. 1). The N and C domains are structurally similar; for 90 equivalent Cα positions, the root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation is 1.6 Å. The 130-residue N domain (residues 18-122 and 262-286) is slightly smaller than the 178-residue C domain (residues 124-260 and 293-333). At the centers of the two domains are six-stranded β-sheets. In the N domain, the strands are parallel to one another, whereas one of the strands (strand 12) of the C domain sheet is antiparallel to the other strands. The C-terminal ends of the strands of the β-sheets of the N and C domains are oriented toward one another. In each domain, four α-helices flank the central β-sheet. Outside of these common secondary structural elements, the C domain has an additional span of amino acids that comprise an α-helix (helix J) and a short 310 helix (helix 310-K) near the C terminus. The model was analyzed using a Ramachandran plot; all residues but six were in “favored” regions of the plot (28Lovell S.C. Davis I.W. Arendall W.B. de Bakker P.I. Word J.M. Prisant M.G. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Proteins. 2003; 50: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (3748) Google Scholar). The main-chain atoms of all but one of these six (A60) were in regions of well defined electron density. The N and C domains are connected by three regions in rTp0319 that likely comprise a hinge (Fig. 1; see below). These connector regions are termed CR1 (residue 123), CR2 (residue 261), and CR3 (residues 287-292). All of the connector regions are devoid of any regular secondary structure; CR3 is the largest, and it forms a loop that protrudes from the body of the protein. The N and C domains contact each other, burying about 1300 Å2 at their interface. Ligand Binding by rTp0319—During the course of building the molecular model from electron density maps, non-protein density was observed at the interface between the N and C domains of rTp0319. The high quality of the electron density facilitated the assignment of the ligand as a purine nucleoside (Figs. 2 and 3). rTp0319 apparently appropriated this molecule from the cytoplasm of the host expression organism, E. coli, inasmuch as exogenous nucleoside was not added to any solution during protein purification. The procurement of this molecule from E. coli and its retention by rTp0319 through chromatographic purification steps provided the initial indication that rTp0319 likely bound purine nucleosides at high affinity. The hydrogen bonding pattern around the nucleoside and the resolution of the structure did not allow the precise identification of the base moiety. However, based on the shape of the density, we surmised that the nitrogenous base was either adenine or hypoxanthine (the base moiety of the nucleoside inosine); the nucleoside was modeled as inosine, for reasons outlined below. A surface accessibility calculation revealed that the nucleoside was almost completely surrounded by protein (data not shown). The ribose moiety is not solvent-accessible, and the hypoxanthine has less than 1 Å2 of accessibility to the solvent. The ribose moiety of the nucleoside adopts the C3′-endo conformation, with the base assuming the anti conformation (Fig. 3). Numerous polar and non-polar contacts are present between the nucleoside and both domains of rTp0319 (Fig. 3). All oxygens of the ribose moiety of the nucleoside form polar interactions with the protein, except O4′. The side chains of Asp-108, Asp-238, and Lys-260 form hydrogen bonds with the exocyclic oxygen atoms of the ribose moiety. Additionally, the main chain nitrogen atom of Gly-212 makes a hydrogen bond with O5′ of the nucleoside. The base moiety of the inosine is sandwiched between the hydrophobic side chains of residue"

The expression of MstE and its subcellular distribution have been studied using a MstE-sGFP fusion protein. Concordant with data on mstE expression, MstE-sGFP is synthesized in the presence of repressing carbon sources, and fluorescence at the periphery of conidia and hyphae is consistent with MstE location in the plasma membrane. Deletion of mstE has no morphological phenotype but results in the absence of low affinity glucose uptake kinetics, the latter being substituted by a high affinity system.

For many filamentous fungi, the principal source of nutrients in the natural environment is dead and decaying plant material. Plant cell walls consist of two structural phases: the microfibrillar phase, the bulk of which is cellulose, and the much more heterogeneous matrix phase of which pectins and hemicelluloses are among the major constituents (1Brett C. Waldron K. Physiology and Biochemistry of Plant Cell Walls. Unwin Hyman, London1990: 4-57Crossref Google Scholar). Organic carbon is obtained from these materials by virtue of the action of cellulolytic enzymes secreted by the fungus that digest these polymers, resulting in the liberation of smaller compounds that can be assimilated. Studies in various filamentous fungi have shown that enzyme production is regulated in such a way that the nature of the activities secreted is appropriate for effective utilization of the substrate available, and whereas the monosaccharides released are principal sources of carbon and energy, they also play important roles in the induction and repression of gene expression (Ref. 2de Vries R.P. Visser J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 497-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar and references therein). In this regard the identification and characterization of the genes that encode catabolic enzymes and, in particular, their regulation have been major research interests for several decades, and relatively little attention has been focused on the fundamental physiological process of monosaccharide uptake in the filamentous fungi. Previous analyses of sugar uptake kinetics in the model filamentous fungi Aspergillus nidulans and Neurospora crassa provided evidence for the existence of energy consuming, carrier-mediated transport systems for d-glucose and some other sugars (3Scarborough G.A.

In contrast, studies conducted by a number of groups in the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae ultimately concluded that monosaccharide uptake was effected by at least two facilitated diffusion systems, whereas the uptake of disaccharides required the expenditure of energy (Refs. 8Lagunas R. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 10: 229-242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 9Weusthuis R.A. Pronk J.T. van den Broek P.J. van Dijken J.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 616-630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). The identification of hexose transporter genes in yeast commenced with the isolation of the sucrose non-fermenting mutant snf3 (10Neigeborn L. Carlson M. Genetics. 1984; 108: 845-858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) followed by the characterization of the SNF3 gene (11Celenza J.L. Marshall-Carlson L. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2130-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and progressed by various means until its rapid conclusion upon analysis of the whole yeast genome data (12Kruckeberg A.L. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 13Nelissen B. De Wachter R. Goffeau A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 114-134Crossref Google Scholar). A total of 34 proteins comprise the S. cerevisiae sugar permease homologues. This group forms part of the Sugar Porter family of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS), 4The abbreviations used are: MFS, major facilitator superfamily; GFP, green fluorescent protein; SMM, supplemented minimal medium; TM, transmembranal domain. the latter originally having been conceived as a result of sequence comparisons between the then known permeases of almost exclusively bacterial or mammalian origin (Ref. 14Marger M.D. Saier Jr., M.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 13-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar and references therein). Eighteen proteins form the yeast hexose transporter subgroup (Hxt1–17 and Gal2), and two (Snf3 and Rgt2) function as sensors of external glucose rather than transporters. The development of multiply deleted sugar transporter mutants and the subsequent reintroduction of individual transporter genes has greatly facilitated the characterization of the gene products, and by such means it has been established that Hxt1–4, -6, and -7 and Gal2 are the major physiologically relevant hexose transporters in budding yeast. In addition, it has been shown that apart from glucose, certain Hxts also mediate the uptake of d-fructose and d-mannose, and the d-galactose transporter Gal2 is able to transport glucose. Glucose uptake systems have also been described for other yeasts (15Boles E. Hollenberg C.P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 85-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Özcan S. Johnston M. Microbiol.

Only four functional sugar transporters have been identified to date, encoded by AmMst1 (19Nehls U. Wiese J. Guttenberger M. Hampp R. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1998; 11: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and HXT1 (20Voegele R.T. Struck C. Hahn M. Mendgen K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A putative glucose sensor gene (rco-3) has been identified in N. crassa (23Madi L. McBride S.A. Bailey L.A. Ebbole D.J.

In a recent reappraisal of the kinetics of glucose uptake in A. nidulans using germinating conidia, two energy-requiring glucose transport systems were identified: a high affinity glucose-repressible system and one of low affinity inducible by glucose (25MacCabe A.P. Miró P. Ventura L. Ramón D. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 2129-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The present report is the first to provide evidence for the identification of a filamentous fungal gene encoding a low affinity glucose transporter in glucose-germinating conidia. Fungal Strains and Culture Conditions—All strains used in this work are listed in Table 1.

Escherichia coli DH5-α (supE44, ΔlacU169 (ϕ80 lacZΔM15, hsdR17, recA1, endA1, gyrA96, thi-1, relA1)) was used as the host strain. All genomic DNAs were prepared using the method of Specht et al. (32Specht C.A. DiRusso C.C. Novotny C.P. Ullrich R.C. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 158-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). PCR reactions were generally performed using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Applied Science). DNA probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP using the random hexanucleotide priming method. Southern blot analysis was carried out using Hybond-N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences). DNA sequencing was done using both standard (e.g. universal and reverse) and custom oligonucleotides. Vector templates for sequencing reactions were prepared using the GenElute Plasmid Miniprep kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Sequencing reactions were performed as outlined in the Ready Reaction DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle sequencing Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and were analyzed using a 310 Applied Biosystems Automatic DNA Sequencer (ABI PRISM™ 310 Genetic Analyzer, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in this study are available on request. mstE cDNA and Genomic Clones—Total RNA was isolated (see below) from wild type mycelia grown for 6 h in shake flask culture (37 °C, 200 rpm) in SMM containing 1% (w/v) glucose as sole carbon source. RNA was made DNA-free by treating 1 μg of RNA with 1 unit of RNase-free DNase (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 30 min, and the DNase was subsequently denatured by heating at 75 °C for 5 min. First strand DNA synthesis was primed off a dT18 oligonucleotide using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Amersham Biosciences). Two independent cDNA clones (in pGEM-T Easy) were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR, sequenced, and found to be identical. One of these was used and named pGEM-cMstE. The mstE gene containing the entire coding region was obtained by PCR using wild type genomic DNA as template and cloned into pGEM-T Easy yielding pGEM-mst903. This clone was also sequenced. Sequence data have been lodged in GenBank™ under accession number AJ812567. Construction of the MstE-sGFP Fusion—The last 1131 bp of the mstE CDS were amplified and cloned into pENTR/d-TOPO (Invitrogen), yielding pENTR-mstE. Using the LR clonase enzyme mix (Invitrogen), this plasmid was recombined with psGFP1, a GATEWAY vector derived from pMT-sGFP that carries the A. nidulans argB gene as a selectable marker (33Toews M.W.

Genet. 2004; 45: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). psGFP1 was derived from pMT-sGFP by digesting with XbaI to eliminate the alcA promoter. Recombination between pENTR-mstE and psGFP1 yielded plasmid pMstE-sGFP, which carries the argB gene and an in-frame fusion between the 3′ terminus of the mstE CDS and the sequence encoding sGFP. A. nidulans strain SRF200 (Table 1) was transformed with this plasmid, and l-arginine prototrophs were selected. Procedures for mstE Deletion—Upstream and downstream sequences (>2 kilobases of each) flanking the mstE gene were amplified from A. nidulans wild type genomic DNA. A plasmid was constructed by sequentially cloning the two mstE flanking regions into pBluescript SK+ II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) followed by insertion between them of a functional PCR-generated A. nidulans panB gene (34Kurtov D. Kinghorn J.R. Unkles S.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) obtained by an appropriately primed PCR off genomic DNA. A. nidulans strain AN032 was transformed with a gel-purified linear product of a PCR primed off the plasmid, and d-pantothenate prototrophic transformants were selected on medium containing 1 m sorbitol as both the osmotic stabilizer and carbon source. AN032 was chosen for mstE deletion as it carries the sorA3 mutation (affects high affinity glucose uptake-25), and it was hypothesized that this could lead to an additive effect resulting in enhanced 2-deoxy-d-glucose resistance and, hence, a means to rapidly identify mstE-deleted transformants. This, however, was observed not to be the case,5 and mstE-deleted mutant strains resulting from single integrations of the linear transforming DNA (identified and characterized by PCR and Southern analysis) were obtained after elimination of the sorA3 mutation by out-crossing with AN033. RNA Isolation and Northern Analysis—For RNA preparations, mycelia were grown in SMM shake flask cultures in an orbital shaker (200 rpm) at 37 °C. For a given culture condition, the total amount of SMM needed was inoculated to a final titer of 5×106 conidia/ml, mixed, and subsequently distributed into the number of 300-ml lots required in 1 liter shake flasks. With the exception of samples taken before 6 h of growth, mycelia were recovered by filtration using Nytal mesh, rinsed with fresh SMM lacking a carbon source, and rapidly pressed dry between pads of absorbent paper and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples taken 0–6 h after inoculation were recovered by low speed centrifugation (3200 × g) for 6 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. All biological material was maintained at –70 °C until use. RNA isolation and northern blotting were performed as described previously (35Flipphi M. van de Vondervoort P.J.I. Ruijter G.J.G. Visser J. Arst Jr., H.N. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11849-11857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Agarose gels were loaded with 15 μg of total RNA per track. Membranes (Hybond-N, Amersham Biosciences) were stained with methylene blue as a loading control, washed, and hybridized. All expression experiments were repeated at least twice. Fluorescence Microscopy—Sterile coverslips were placed in a Petri dish, and spores were added in the appropriate SMM. Growth was carried out at room temperature overnight when 1% (w/v) glucose was used as the carbon source and for 2 days in the case of 1% (w/v) galactose. Media shift experiments were done by germinating conidia in glucose SMM on a “Dantridish” (courtesy of Daniel Veith, Angewandte Mikrobiologie, Institut für Angewandte Biowissenschaften, Universität Karlsruhe, Germany) overnight at room temperature. Medium was subsequently removed by aspiration, the attached mycelia were rinsed with SMM lacking a carbon source, and fresh galactose-SMM was added. Fluorescence was visualized with filter No. 9 (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) using an Axiophot microscope (Zeiss), and images were captured with a high-resolution Orca ER camera (Hamamatsu, Munich, Germany). Labeling of A. nidulans vacuoles was carried out with 7-amino-4-chloromethyl coumarin (Molecular Probes) as previously described (36Valdez-Taubas J. Harispe L. Scazzocchio C. Gorfinkiel L. Rosa A.L. Fungal Genet. Biol. 2004; 41: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Glucose Uptake Experiments—Glucose uptake measurements were done as described previously (25MacCabe A.P. Miró P. Ventura L. Ramón D. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 2129-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), except that filters were rinsed with 1.5 ml of ice-cold 200 mm glucose immediately before filtration of [14C]glucose-labeled conidia. d-Fructose uptake kinetics were determined using the appropriately modified protocol and measuring uptake rates at 10, 40, 100, 700, 2000, and 5000 μm fructose substrate concentrations. d-[U-14C]fructose (11.7 GBq mmol–1) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Glucose uptake rates in the presence of a 100-fold excess of potential competing substrates were determined by linear regression of plots of the amounts of glucose taken up after 30, 60, and 90 s of incubation of 4 h glucose-germinating conidia. All data were analyzed using SigmaPlot Version 8.02 (SSP Inc.). Identification and Characterization of mstE—In a BLAST screening (37Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) of the Oklahoma University A. nidulans EST database with the primary structures of sugar transporters from a variety of organisms, the lowest expectation (E) value (1e-40) noted occurred in an alignment between translations of tag o0f08a1 and a protein sequence (GenBank™ AAB65790), which is described as corresponding to an Aspergillus parasiticus hexose transporter (Hxt1). Contig ANI61C903 was subsequently identified upon probing a low coverage A. nidulans genomic sequence database in silico with the nucleotide sequence of this tag. By making comparisons between the potential translation products of ANI61C903 and the primary structures of known hexose transporters (e.g. the Hxt proteins of S. cerevisiae) and assuming classical intron/exon junctions, a hypothetical gene, mstE, containing three introns and encoding a 12-transmembranal (TM) domain protein (MstE) was deduced. After probing the NCBI database with the sequence of MstE, the most similar proteins detected whose physiological functions have been experimentally determined were the hexose transporters RAG1 from Kluyveromyces lactis (62% similarity, 45% identity (38Goffrini P. Wesolowski-Louvel M. Ferrero I. Fukuhara H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5294Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar)) and Hxt3 from S. cerevisiae (59% similarity, 42% identity (39Ko C.H. Liang H. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar)), both of which are described as low affinity glucose transporters. Using mstE-specific primers, a reverse transcription-PCR product was obtained from RNA isolated from a 6-h glucose grown culture of wild type A. nidulans, conditions under which glucose transport is known to take place with low affinity kinetics (25MacCabe A.P. Miró P. Ventura L. Ramón D. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 2129-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The corresponding genomic clone was also obtained by PCR. The translation product MstE (562 amino acids and a calculated molecular mass of 62 kDa) is encoded by a 1849-bp sequence interrupted by three introns (those previously predicted) and contains the five-element fingerprint (Ref. 40Attwood T.K. Bradley P. Flower D.R. Gaulton A. Maudling N. Mitchell A.L. Moulton G. Nordle A. Paine K. Taylor P. Uddin A. Zygouri C.

Twelve putative TM α-helices are predicted to be distributed as two groups of six (Fig. 1), as is common for proteins belonging to the MFS (42Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phylogenetic comparison with the primary structures of those fungal proteins for which experimental evidence of their physiological function as sugar transporters or sensors has been published (Fig. 2) shows that MstE segregates apart from the characterized filamentous fungal sugar transporters of A. muscaria, A. niger, T. harzianum, and U. fabae and the yeast sensor proteins and, instead, is more closely related to the hexose transporters of S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The alignment of sequences revealed 31 positions in which identical amino acids occur (see Fig. 1), some of which correspond to residues that have been demonstrated to be involved in either substrate (sugar) binding or specificity in other sugar transporters, summarized in Table 2.FIGURE 2Phylogenetic analysis of sequence similarities between MstE and physiologically functional fungal sugar transporters and sensors (#). A. muscaria (Am), A. nidulans (An), A. niger (Ag), Candida albicans (Ca), K. lactis (Kl), Pichia stipitis (Ps), S. cerevisiae (Sc), S. pombe (Sp), T. harzianum (Th), and U. fabae (Uf). The Homo sapiens (Hs) glucose transporter GLUT1 was used as the out-group. MEGA3 software (43Kumar S Tamura K Nei N. Brief.

The relative repressiveness of carbon sources refers to their impacts on l-proline and acetamide utilization (26Arst Jr., H.N. Cove D.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1973; 126: 111-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In germinating conidia (4 h) grown in the presence of glucose, mannose, sorbitol, or sucrose greater abundance of the mstE transcript was seen compared with the other repressing carbon sources at the same time point. As cultures progressed (24 and 36 h) and the repressing carbon sources depleted, the levels of both the mstE and gpdA (constitutively expressed control) transcripts reduced significantly and/or disappeared (this is shown only for glucose in Fig. 3 since the same effect was seen in all the other carbon sources); actin transcript abundance (not shown) paralleled that seen for gpdA. The only apparent exception to this was for mycelia growing in the presence of ethanol, for which a small amount of mstE transcript was detectable in the 24- and 36-h time points (data not shown). mstE expression was also studied in RNA isolated from dormant wild type conidia and conidia germinating for between 1 and 8 h in parallel cultures in SMM containing either glucose or lactose as the sole carbon sources. Although transcripts of mstE were not found in dormant conidia (0 h), mstE expression was detectable 1 h after inoculation of conidia into glucose SMM (activation phase (49d'Enfert C. Fungal Genet. Biol. 1997; 21: 163-172Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar)) and accumulated with time (Fig. 4). By contrast, no expression of mstE was detected in conidia growing on lactose (data not shown). To analyze the glucose inducibility of mstE, glucose (0.5%) was added to a 14-h culture of wild type mycelia growing on SMM in the presence of 0.5% lactose (Fig. 5A). Whereas mstE accumulation occurs over a prolonged period in continuous cultures containing glucose or other repressing carbon sources, the rapid accumulation of mstE transcript after the addition of glucose (1 h) to lactose-grown mycelia was followed by a rapid diminution over the course of the following hour despite the presence of 0.25% glucose in the medium (0.3% glucose after 1 h of induction and 0.25% after 2 h of induction).FIGURE 5Northern blot analysis of the expression of the mstE gene in the wild type strain growing on SMM with lactose (0.5%) for 14 h (NI) and 1 h (I1) and 2 h (I2) after induction with glucose (0.5%) (A) and SMM with lactose (Lac, 3%) plus glucose (0.5%) 4, 12, and 36 h after inoculation of conidia (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has been noted above that the amount of the control gpdA mRNA accumulated in wild type mycelia is very reduced by the 24-h time point compared with that seen at 12 h (shown only for glucose in Fig. 3 but also observed for the other carbon sources). To test whether this effect is related with exhaustion of the carbon source, conidia were inoculated into SMM supplemented with both 3% lactose and 0.5% glucose, and samples were taken after 4, 12, and 36 h of inoculation.

Some splicing mutations permit normal splicing as well as aberrant splicing, which can give a reduced level of normal β-globin synthesis causing mild disease (thalassemia intermedia). For other mutations, normal splicing is reduced to low levels, and patients are transfusion-dependent when homozygous for the disease. The development of therapies for β-thalassemia will require suitable mouse models for preclinical studies. In this study, we report the generation of a humanized mouse model carrying the common IVSI-110 splicing mutation on a BAC including the human β-globin (huβ-globin) locus. We examined heterozygous murine β-globin knock-out mice (muβth-3/+) carrying either the IVSI-110 or the normal huβ-globin locus. Our results show a 90% decrease in huβ-globin chain synthesis in the IVSI-110 mouse model compared with the mouse model carrying the normal huβ-globin locus. This notable difference is attributed to aberrant splicing. The humanized IVSI-110 mouse model accurately recapitulates the splicing defect found in comparable β-thalassemia patients. This mouse model is available as a platform for testing strategies for the restoration of normal splicing. Splicing mutations are common causes of β-thalassemia.

This mouse model is available as a platform for testing strategies for the restoration of normal splicing. Thalassemia is one of the common inherited genetic disorders affecting hemoglobin synthesis. Approximately 300,000 patients with clinically relevant hemoglobinopathies are born each year (1Olivieri N.F. Weatherall D.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1655-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the case of β-thalassemia a reduction or absence of β-globin chain synthesis results in free or unpaired α-globin chains, which aggregate and precipitate within red cells causing ineffective erythropoiesis and severe anemia. Over 200 different mutations have been found that cause β-thalassemia, with splicing mutations among the most common. Most of these mutations activate aberrant cryptic 5′-donor or 3′-acceptor splice sites without completely abolishing normal splicing. These mutations lead to the production of variable amounts of normal transcripts. Some mutations allow a significant level of normal splicing (such as IVSI-6), leading to thalassemia intermedia, whereas others reduce normal splicing to low levels (such as IVSI-110) or very low levels (such as IVSI-5 and IVSII-654), causing a transfusion-dependent disease in homozygotes. Because of the complex pathophysiology associated with the hemoglobinopathies, transgenic mouse models are an essential platform for delineating the pathological mechanisms and, as in vivo model systems, for validating future therapeutic strategies. The humanized mouse model approach, where the transgenic mouse model contains large human genomic fragment(s), has provided valuable insight into the regulatory elements required for the developmental expression of human globin genes (2Gaensler K.M.

We have recently reported the first humanized mouse model for a deletion mutation causing β-thalassemia at codons 41-42 (20Jamsai D. Zaibak F. Khongnium W. Vadolas J. Voullaire L. Fowler K.J. Gazeas S. Fucharoen S. Williamson R. Ioannou P.A. Genomics. 2005; 85: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Unlike the situation with the normal huβ-globin locus, these mice fail to show phenotypic complementation in heterozygous β-globin knock-out (KO) background (muβth-3/+), or homozygous β-globin knock-out mice (muβth-3/th-3). This mouse is a suitable in vivo model system to investigate gene correction strategies in hematopoietic stem cells and to identify HbF inducers. We describe the development and characterization of a humanized mouse model carrying the IVSI-110 splicing mutation in the context of the genomic huβ-globin locus. This mutation was first described in 1981 and is one of the most common splicing mutations found in the Eastern Mediterranean region (21Spritz R.A. Jagadeeswaran P. Choudary P.V. Biro P.A. Elder J.T. deRiel J.K. Manley J.L. Gefter M.L. Forget B.G. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2455-2459Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that this humanized IVSI-110 mouse model recapitulates the splicing defect that is typical for IVSI-110 in β-thalassemia patients. This mouse will serve as a platform for testing novel strategies for the restoration of normal splicing. Characterization of the 183-kb Genomic Fragment Containing the huβ-Globin Locus—The PAC clone 148O22 containing the huβ-globin locus in a 183-kb genomic fragment was first isolated from the RPCI I PAC library (22Ioannou P.A.

Williamson R. Ioannou P.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the 5′- and 3′-ends of the genomic insert (data not shown) and alignment with the human genome sequence (GenBank™ accession number NT_028310.10) revealed that the genomic insert is 183,039-bp long, with 122,076 bp upstream of the start codon of the ϵ-globin gene and 17,672 bp downstream of the stop codon of the β-globin gene. Introduction of the IVSI-110 Mutation into huβ-Globin Locus—Using GET recombination, an inducible homologous recombination system for Escherichia coli, the IVSI-110 mutation was introduced into the intact huβ-globin locus contained in a BAC vector (14Nefedov M. Williamson R. Ioannou P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: E79Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The β-globin locus containing the IVSI-110 mutation was purified from DH10B cells using the Qiagen BAC purification procedure (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The 183-kb genomic insert was prepared for microinjection as previously reported (25Vadolas J. Wardan H. Bosmans M. Zaibak F. Jamsai D. Voullaire L. Williamson R. Ioannou P.A. Biochim. Biophys.

In brief, transgenic founder mice and F1 progeny were screened by PCR using the following primer pair, huβ forward 5′-ACAAGACAGGTTTAAGGAGACCA-3′ and huβ reverse 5′-GTCTGTTTCCCATTCTAAACTGTA-3′. These primers amplified a 447-bp product of the huβ-globin gene. F1 progeny were bred with heterozygous knock-out mice (muβth-3/+) to generate transgenic mice on a heterozygous and knock-out background. The genotyping was performed by multiplex PCR using the following primer pairs: huβ forward/huβ reverse (as above); HPRT-forward, 5′-GATGGGAGGCCATCACATTGTAG-3′ and HPRT-reverse, 5′-GCGACCTTGACCATCTTTGGATTA-3′; and muβ-forward, 5′-TGAGAAGGCTGCTGTCTCTTG-3′ and muβ-reverse, 5′-CAGAGGATAGGTCTCCAAAGCTA-3′. The conditions used for the multiplex PCR were denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. After 30 cycles, the PCR products were resolved by 1.5% agarose gel-electrophoresis. Determination of Transgene Integrity—The long range integrity of the huβ-globin locus in transgenic lines was examined by Southern blot analysis after digestion of genomic DNA with the Cfr9I and SfiI restriction endonucleases (Fermentas, Hanover, MD). Cfr9I digestion of the huβ-globin locus yields a single 36-kb fragment that contains the γ-, δ-, and β-globin genes, whereas SfiI digestion cuts the genomic fragment twice in the middle of the fragment (see Fig. 1). To avoid shearing the genomic DNA, splenocytes from representative transgenic mice were suspended at a final concentration of 2 × 107 cells/ml in 0.5% InCert-agarose (Cambrex Bio Science). The solidified plugs were incubated overnight in buffered Proteinase K buffer (100 mm EDTA at pH 8.0, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 1% sodium lauryl sarcosine, 0.2 mg/ml of Proteinase K) at 50 °C. After several washes in 20 mm Tris, 50 mm EDTA at pH 8.8, the plugs were digested overnight with Cfr9I or SfiI. The plugs were loaded into the wells of a 1% agarose gel, and genomic DNA was separated in a CHEF-DRII pulsed-field gel electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad). The DNA was alkali-blotted onto a Hybond membrane (Amersham Biosciences) after partial depurination and hybridized with a PCR probe amplified from the huβ-globin locus using primers huβ-forward/huβ-reverse. Determination of Transgene Copy Number—Transgene copy number in mice was performed by quantitative radioactive PCR as previously reported (25Vadolas J. Wardan H. Bosmans M. Zaibak F. Jamsai D. Voullaire L. Williamson R. Ioannou P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1728: 150-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In brief, PCR was performed using the primer pair HM-forward 5′-GATGAAGTTGGTGGTGAGGCCCT-3′/HM-reverse 5′-CCTGAAGTTCTCAGGATCCA-3′ on mouse tail genomic DNA. These primers amplify the huβ-globin and muβ-globin sequences equally, yielding 381-bp and 367-bp products, respectively. The human and mouse products can be readily distinguished because the murine product contains a unique NcoI site that yields two fragments, 242 and 125 bp. The NcoI-digested PCR products were run on a 2.0% 3:1 Nusieve gel (BMA). The gel was washed for 45 min, in 7% trichloroacetic acid and vacuum-dried at 65° C onto blotting paper. The dried radioactive gel was exposed to a Low Energy Storage Phosphor Screen (Molecular Dynamics, Amersham Biosciences), and the Phosphor Screen was scanned using the Storm 840 Scanner (Molecular Dynamics). Each band corresponding to muβ-globin and huβ-globin PCR product was quantitated using Image Quant (Molecular Dynamics). Location of Transgene Integration Site—Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was used to examine transgene integration sites and confirm hemizygosity or homozygosity for the transgene in mice exclusively expressing huβ-globin. Fibroblasts isolated from tail biopsies, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The fibroblasts were harvested after exposure to colcemid for 2 h. Chromosome preparations were obtained using standard techniques and hybridized with a pEBAC/148β DNA probe. The probe was labeled with digoxigenin (Roche Applied Science) and detected with rhodamine-conjugated anti-digoxigenin to locate the inserted transgenes. The slides were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) containing DAPI 2The abbreviations used are: DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; RT-PCR, reverse transcription PCR; HPLC, high-pressure liquid chromatography; SR, serine/arginine-rich; AO, antisense oligonucleotide; BM, bone marrow. counterstain. The cells were examined and analyzed using a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope with appropriate filters, and images were captured using Cytovision imaging equipment and software (Applied Imaging Corp., Santa Clara, CA). Metaphase and interphase nuclei were analyzed for localized signals and chromosome identification achieved by analysis of the reversed DAPI banding pattern. RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was prepared using the Tri-Reagent BD system (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) as described by the manufacturer. cDNA was synthesized using random hexamers as primers. Primers used to amplify the sequence between exon 1 and exon 2 were: forward primer 5′-CGCCTCGAGGAGAAGTCTCCGTTAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CGCGAATTCCCCATAACAGCACAGGAGT-3′. The PCR was performed using the following conditions: denaturation at 94 °C for 30 min, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. After 30 cycles, the PCR products were resolved on a 2% Nusieve GTG-agarose gel. The above primers amplified a 170-bp and a 189-bp products from the huβ-globin gene, which correspond to the normal and aberrantly spliced mRNA, respectively. Sequencing of RT-PCR Products—The PCR-amplified products were digested with XhoI and EcoRI and cloned into the respective sites of pBluescript-KS+. Colonies were picked based on blue/white color selection and verified by sequencing using Big Dye Terminator Kit V3.1 (PerkinElmer) according to manufacturer's specifications and using the RT-PCR forward primer as above. In brief, sequencing PCR was performed using the following conditions: rapid thermal ramp to 96 °C, hold at 96 °C for 30 s, rapid thermal ramp to 50 °C, hold at 50 °C for 15 s, rapid thermal ramp to 60 °C, hold at 60 °C for 4 min. After 25 cycles, rapid thermal ramp to 4 °C. Hematological Analysis—Blood was collected from transgenic mice ≥8 weeks of age by retro-orbital bleeding. Full blood examination was performed on whole blood collected into tubes containing EDTA. Full blood examination was performed using an automated Roche Applied Science Cobas Helios hematological analyzer at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia. A minimum of 2 weeks was allowed between repeat samples, when such samples were necessary, to minimize the distortion of hematological parameters by frequent bleeding. Cellulose acetate gel electrophoresis was used to visualize hemoglobin tetramers. Samples containing approximately equal amounts of hemoglobin were run on cellulose acetate membranes (Helena Laboratories). Hemoglobin bands were visualized using Ponceau S stain. Measurement of Globin Chain Synthesis—The measurement of muβ-globin and huβ-globin chain synthesis was performed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described previously (25Vadolas J. Wardan H. Bosmans M. Zaibak F. Jamsai D. Voullaire L. Williamson R. Ioannou P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1728: 150-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Red blood cells (20 μl) were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 m HCl) and then made 1 ml with 500 μl of 50% aqueous acetonitrile. The lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was analyzed by HPLC. Globin chain separation was performed by loading 30 μl of lysed red cells onto a Vydac C4 column (Vydac, Hesperia). The proteins eluting from the column were measured at 220, 280, and 413 nm with an Agilent 1100 diode array detector. Peak protein fractions were collected and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry to confirm globin chain type. Creation and Characterization of BAC Transgenic Mice—In this study, our aim was to establish a humanized mouse model carrying the IVSI-110 splicing mutation and determine whether the huβ-globin pre-mRNA produced in mice was aberrantly spliced as in humans. Founder mice carrying either the normal or IVSI-110 genomic fragment were identified by screening genomic DNA by huβ-globin-specific PCR (data not shown) and mated with C57BL/6 mice to generate F1 germ-line transgene progeny. The transgenic mice containing two copies of the normalβ-globin locus or the IVSI-110 huβ-globin locus were bred with muβth-3/+ mice to generate mice hemizygous for the transgene on a heterozygous knock-out background (muβth-3/+,huβ+/0 or muβth-3/+,IVSI-110β+/0). Integrity of Transgene—The 183-kb fragment contains seven olfactory receptor genes upstream of the locus control region and the hypersensitive site 5′-HS-111 located ∼111 kb upstream of the ϵ-promoter (Fig. 1A). The integrity of the huβ-globin locus in the transgenic lines was determined by Southern blot analysis. Genomic DNA embedded in agarose was digested with Cfr9I or SfiI and resolved by pulse field gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1B). A 447-bp probe corresponding to the huβ-globin gene was used to demonstrate the integrity of the integrated transgene. The presence of a single 36-kb fragment following Cfr9I digestion in both transgenic lines correlated with the γ-, δ-, and β-globin genomic fragment as being intact. The presence of a single SfiI fragment ∼160 kb in size in the transgenic line containing the normal β-globin locus is consistent with the integration of two genomic fragments in a tail-to-tail orientation (Fig. 1C). The presence of two SfiI fragments, 140 and 175 kb in the IVSI-110 transgenic line, is consistent with the integration of two genomic fragments in a head-to-tail orientation (Fig. 1C). Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization Analysis of Transgenic Mice—Transgenic mice carrying the normal or the IVSI-110 huβ-globin transgene were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Metaphase spreads of fibroblast cells were prepared from F0 progeny. The transgenic founders were all found to contain a single integration site (Fig. 2A). The integrated BAC DNA was located using labeled insert DNA, and chromosome identification was made on the basis of the banding pattern obtained from the inverted DAPI metaphase image. In the founder containing the normal huβ-globin locus, the transgene was proximally located on chromosome 14, whereas in the founder containing the IVSI-110 locus the transgene was medially located on chromosome 1 (Fig. 2A). Genotype Determination—To determine the degree of hematological complementation of the huβ-globin locus in a thalassemic environment, transgenic mice were bred onto a muβth-3/+ and a muβth-3/th-3 background. The transgenic mice were genotyped by multiplex PCR using genomic DNA. Three genes were amplified by PCR (Fig. 2B). The bottom band represents the muβ-globin gene (198 bp), the middle band represents the HPRT knock-out cassette (315 bp), and the top band corresponds to the huβ-globin transgene (447 bp). Transgenic mice on a muβth-3/+ background were obtained for both transgenic lines, whereas viable transgenic mice on a muβth-3/th-3 could only be generated with the normal huβ-globin locus. We have previously reported that homozygosity for two copies of the normal locus was necessary to rescue the embryonic lethal muβth-3/th-3 mice, with the mice displaying normal hematological parameters as measured by full blood examination. We were unable to identify any IVSI-110 transgenic on a muβth-3/th-3 background at birth indicating that the level of globin expression is insufficient to support fetal growth to birth. This is because of the low level of huβ-globin expression caused by the IVSI-110 mutation. Transgene Copy Number Determination—Two transgenic lines were analyzed by quantitative radioactive PCR. Because the human and the mouse globin genes are very similar at the DNA sequence, the primers were designed to amplify both the huβ-globin and muβ-globin genes. However, only the amplified mouse PCR product contains an internal NcoI restriction site, which was used to differentiate between the mouse- and human-specific β-globin PCR product. The PCR products generated using the HM primers set were digested with NcoI and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2C). The two lower bands represent the two mouse-specific products, 125 and 242 bp, whereas the top band represents the undigested huβ-globin gene, 381 bp. As expected, the wild type NcoI-digested mouse control PCR produced two mouse-specific PCR products, whereas the human control PCR produced one human-specific PCR product. The relative intensity of the huβ-globin-specific PCR product was compared with the muβ-globin-specific PCR products on a wild type background (which contains four adult β-globin genes) and on a muβth-3/+ background (which contains two adult β-globin genes). Using this approach, the transgene copy number was determined. Both transgenic lines contained two copies of the huβ-globin locus (Fig. 2C). Expression of huβ-Globin in Adult Transgenic Mice—The transgenic lines containing the normal or IVSI-110 huβ-globin locus were bred with muβth-3/+ mice to generate mice hemizygous for the huβ-globin locus on a muβth-3/+ background. The expression level of the huβ-globin chain was 10% in wild type transgenic mice and 35% in muβth-3/+ mice. Importantly, further breeding produced viable muβth-3/th-3 mice expressing only the huβ-globin locus (muβth-3/+,huβ+/0) (Fig. 3A), thus confirming that the 183-kb genomic fragment, containing the huβ-globin locus, can fully complement muβth-3/th-3 mice. Measurement of globin chain synthesis in the humanized IVSI-110 mouse on wild type background was below measurable levels as seen by HPLC (data not shown); however huβ-globin chain synthesis by the humanized IVSI-110 mouse on muβth-3/+ background expressed huβ-globin at ∼3% relative to muα-globin chain. It was noted that the level of huβ-globin chain synthesis in the humanized IVSI-110 transgenic mouse was ∼90% lower compared with huβ-globin chain synthesis in the humanized normal huβ-globin transgenic mouse on a similar background. These results suggest that this mouse model accurately recapitulates the β-globin gene defect that is typical for IVSI-110 in β-thalassemia patients. In addition, there was a significant increase in the level of huβ-globin chain in the muβth-3/+ mice when compared with wild type transgenic mice as detected by HPLC globin chain separation and cellulose acetate gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3). This is thought to be because of post-translational events, where reduced synthesis of muβ-globin chain in the muβth-3/+ mouse results in reduced competitive binding between the huβ-globin chain for muα-globin resulting in an increase in the level of chimeric hemoglobin. Detection of Aberrant Splicing—Splicing of huβ-globin pre-mRNA in the humanized IVSI-110 mouse model was examined. RT-PCR was performed on RNA derived from whole blood, BM, and spleen from the humanized IVSI-110 mouse model and compared with RNA derived from blood isolated from a homozygous IVSI-110 β-thalassemia patient (Fig. 4). PCR primers specific for the huβ-globin gene were used to amplify the correctly spliced huβ-globin mRNA spanning the 3′-end of exon 1 to the 5′-end of exon 2 regions. As a control we used a transgenic mouse containing the normal huβ-globin (Fig. 4). As determined by RT-PCR transgenic mice that containing the IVSI-110 β-globin locus displayed one aberrantly spliced product. A detailed sequence analysis of cloned BM RT-PCR products revealed that the +110 mutation was recognized as the expected 3′-splice site. This aberrant splice product was identified in the BM, spleen, and blood of mice as well as in the blood of IVSI-110 β-thalassemia patients. We noted quantitative differences in the amount of aberrant RT-PCR splice products amplified by PCR. In the BM and spleen, the +110 splice product was present in greater amounts compared with correctly spliced β-globin mRNA, whereas in the blood of IVSI-110 mice and IVSI-110 β-thalassemia patients the normal splice product was the predominate mRNA species. Presumably the difference in relative mRNA levels is because of mRNA instability. We compared the strength of the authentic and aberrant splice sites using the Shapiro and Senapathy (S&S) matrix (26Senapathy P. Shapiro M.B. Harris N.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 252-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). The +110 3ss scored 80.1, whereas the natural 3ss scored 84.5 (Fig. 4). Although the +110 3ss scored lower than the natural 3ss, it is not clear how the spliceosome can selectively discriminate against the authentic 3ss in preference for the weaker aberrant splice site. There are several studies, which report that RNA sequence elements bound by serine/arginine-rich (SR) family of proteins promotes the use of 5′- and 3′-splice sites through protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. SR proteins can be either splicing activators or repressors, depending on where they bind to the pre-mRNA. Intronic binding of SR proteins has previously been reported to inhibit splicing (27Black D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1979) Google Scholar). Because the IVSI-110 mutation promoted intronic aberrant splicing, the exonic splice enhancer algorithm ESEfinder was used to investigate whether the IVSI-110 mutation interfered with four putative SR splicing factors; SR protein SF2/ASF, SC35, SRp40, and SRp55 (28Cartegni L. Wang J. Zhu Z. Zhang M.Q. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3568-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). Although other SR protein-binding sites have been reported, the ESEfinder predicted that the IVSI-110 mutation disrupted an SRp40 binding motif. At this stage, we can only speculate that the IVSI-110 mutation may have disrupted the activity of an SR protein repressor. Full Blood Examination—A full blood examination was performed on transgenic mice carrying the normal or IVSI-110 huβ-globin locus, including red blood cell count, total hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocyte indices, and reticulocyte counts. A summary of the results is shown in Table 1. The muβth-3/+ mice were found to be anemic, as"

We show here that at the ribosome, the molecular environment of a signal sequence depends on the nature of downstream sequence elements that can cause an alternate recruitment of signal recognition particle and the ribosome-associated chaperone Trigger factor to a growing nascent chain. While signal recognition particle and Trigger factor might remain bound to the same ribosome, both ligands are clearly able to displace each other from a nascent chain.

The data also imply that a signal sequence owes its molecular environment to the fact that it remains closely apposed to the ribosomal exit site during growth of a nascent secretory protein. In Escherichia coli, most exported proteins leave the cytoplasm via the SecYEG-translocon of the inner membrane (reviewed in Refs. 1de Keyzer J. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Cell. Mol.

Exported proteins, that remain resident in the cell, encompass periplasmic and outer membrane proteins, collectively termed secretory proteins, as well as inner membrane proteins. Targeting of both groups of proteins to the Sec-translocon occurs by two independent mechanisms. Inner membrane proteins are co-translationally targeted by the bacterial signal recognition particle (SRP) 4The abbreviations used are: SRP, signal recognition particle; DSS, disuccinimidyl suberate; INV, inside-out inner membrane vesicles; TF, Trigger factor; TM, transmembrane span; Tmd-Phe, l-4′-(3-[trifluoromethyl]-3H-diazirin-3-yl) phenylalanine; GMP-PNP, 5′guanylyl β,α-imidodiphosphate., composed of the Ffh protein and the 4.5 S RNA, in concert with the SRP receptor, FtsY (reviewed in Refs. 3Koch H.G.

SRP specifically recognizes the signal anchor sequences of inner membrane proteins when they emerge from the ribosome. Experimentally, this has been demonstrated by site-directed cross-linking of Ffh to the signal anchor sequences of nascent inner membrane proteins (5Valent Q.A. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G.

In contrast, secretory proteins do not seem to undergo a specific recognition event at the ribosome but rather are post-translationally targeted to the Sec-translocon by SecA and SecB. Accordingly, nascent secretory proteins are not found cross-linked to Ffh but, like most nascent polypeptides, to the ribosome-associated chaperone Trigger factor (TF) (5Valent Q.A. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G.

From the results of a number of experiments it has been concluded that it is the low overall hydrophobicity characteristic of cleavable signal sequences of secretory proteins that excludes an interaction with SRP (5Valent Q.A. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G.

Surprisingly, however, nascent secretory proteins exposing only the signal sequence from the ribosome have been found cross-linked to Ffh (13Eisner G. Koch H.G. Beck K. Brunner J. Müller M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14Chevalier N. Moser M. Koch H.G. Schimz K.L. Willery E. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F. Müller M. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2004; 8: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Only upon further growth of the nascent chain did the signal sequence move from a close contact with Ffh to one with TF. For the outer membrane protein A (OmpA), this transition was determined to occur, after 37–53 amino acids downstream of the signal sequence have exited the ribosome (13Eisner G. Koch H.G. Beck K. Brunner J. Müller M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A length-dependent change in the contact of a nascent signal sequence from Ffh to TF relates to the controversial issue if Ffh and TF can bind to the same ribosome at the same time. This question was raised by the disclosure of partially overlapping binding sites for both proteins at the ribosomal proteins L23 and L29 (15Gu S.Q. Peske F. Wieden H.J. Rodnina M.V. Wintermeyer W.

Biochimie (Paris). 2004; 86: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The finding that the vicinity of a signal sequence changes from Ffh to TF upon growth of the nascent chain might be explained by a change in the overall affinity of the nascent chain for the two ligands. In the case of a secretory protein like pOmpA, high affinity binding sites for TF following downstream of the signal sequence would recruit TF, which thereby sequesters the adjacent signal sequence from contacts with Ffh. We therefore asked if by the same token, a downstream recognition site for Ffh being exposed upon continued growth of the nascent chain would have an influence on the liganding behavior of a signal sequence. Our results show that distal sequence elements of the nascent chain in fact determine the molecular vicinity of a signal sequence and that Ffh and TF compete for binding to nascent secretory and membrane proteins.

Plasmid p717OmpA was linearized at an EcoRI site located at the 3′-end of ompA and subsequently cut with SpeI to remove the ompA sequence except for the nucleotides encoding the first 26 residues including the signal sequence.

Nascent chains of pOmtl-82, pOmtl-110, and pOmtl-169 were obtained using the same primers as those previously described for the synthesis of MtlA-102, MtlA-130, and MtlA-189, respectively (6Beck K.

If not stated otherwise, synthesis reactions were terminated after 30 min at 37 °C. Chemical cross-linking using disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), introduction of TAG stop codons by site-directed mutagenesis, incorporation of the site-specific cross-linker Tmd-Phe, and immunoprecipitation on 4-fold scaled-up reactions were performed as described (6Beck K.

Control cells were transformed with the vector plasmid pKSM717. Cells were grown to mid logarithmic phase in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and expression from plasmids was induced by adding isopropyl thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mm. After an additional hour of growth, cells were harvested, and a crude protein extract was obtained by sonication and low speed centrifugation (15 min, 5,000 × g) to remove debris. Extracts were further separated into soluble supernatant and membrane pellet by high speed centrifugation (1 h, 70,000 rpm, Beckman rotor TLA100.2). Ffh (13Eisner G. Koch H.G. Beck K. Brunner J. Müller M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and TF (14Chevalier N. Moser M. Koch H.G. Schimz K.L. Willery E. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F. Müller M. J. Mol.

Western blots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Correct Localization of a Polytopic Membrane Protein Harboring a Cleavable Signal Sequence at Its N Terminus—To construct a polypeptide in which a signal sequence is followed by an Ffh recognition site, i.e. a signal anchor sequence, we replaced the first 46 amino acid residues of the inner membrane protein mannitol permease (MtlA) by the signal sequence plus the four subsequent residues of pOmpA creating the fusion protein pOmtl (Fig. 1A). MtlA has six to eight predicted transmembrane spans (TMs) with the N and the C termini located in the cytoplasm (33Sugiyama J.E. Mahmoodian S. Jacobson G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9603-9607Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 34Vervoort E.B. Bultema J.B. Schuurman-Wolters G.K. Geertsma E.R. Broos J. Poolman B. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 733-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Despite the substitution of the first TM of MtlA for the signal sequence of pOmpA, the fusion protein pOmtl was recovered from the membrane fraction of pOmtl overexpressing E. coli cells to about the same extent as MtlA (Fig. 1B; even in wild type E. coli strains up to 20% of MtlA are found soluble following ultracentrifugation of cell extracts (35Aboulwafa M. Saier Jr., M.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when expressed in vitro by a cell-free transcription/translation system, pOmtl integrated into INV as indicated by the accumulation of proteinase K-resistant fragments when INV were present (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 6 and 8). A 30-kDa protease-resistant fragment (lane 4) is diagnostic for membrane integration of MtlA (36Werner P.K. Saier Jr., M.H. Müller M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24523-24532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of pOmtl, the appearance of more proteinase K fragments smaller than 30 kDa (compare lanes 4 and 8) are suggestive of a less stable membrane association when compared with MtlA, which was also seen in an in vivo time course experiment (Fig. 1D). Consistent with membrane integration, the addition of INV to the in vitro synthesis reaction also generated a smaller species of Omtl most likely due to signal sequence cleavage (Fig. 1C, lane 7, arrowhead). Although as expected pOmtl lacking the first TM of MtlA did not assemble into a functional permease (data not shown), it obviously was recognized and at least transiently localized to the membrane by the targeting machinery of the cell. A Downstream Signal Anchor Sequence Mediates Contact of the N-terminal Signal Sequence with Ffh—Next a series of elongation-arrested chains of pOmtl (Fig. 2) were synthesized in vitro. These nascent pOmtl chains carried a photoactivatable derivative of phenylalanine (Tmd-Phe; l-4′-(3-[trifluoromethyl]-3H-diazirin-3-yl)phenylalanine) either within the hydrophobic core of the pOmpA signal sequence (position 11) or within TM2 of MtlA (position 36; arrows). Fig. 2 also illustrates the various sequence portions of pOmtl being exposed from the ribosomal exit tunnel. Following synthesis in the presence of Ffh and TF, the various radioactively labeled pOmtl nascent chains were irradiated with UV light and the obtained cross-links were visualized by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging (Fig. 3). For comparison two short nascent chains of pOmpA carrying Tmd-Phe at position 11 in the signal sequence were also included (A). In the latter cases a prominent photoadduct of the pOmpA signal sequence was obtained (×) that was immunoprecipitated by anti-Ffh antibodies (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 6). When the shortest nascent chain of pOmtl (pOmtl-65) was UV-irradiated (Fig. 3A, lanes 7–10) a more discrete Ffh adduct (×), which was masked by an non-further characterized translation product (•), became visible after immunoprecipitation with anti-Ffh antibodies (lane 9). Thus the signal sequence of pOmpA contacts Ffh also when present in short nascent chains of pOmtl. As expected, pOmtl-65 nascent chains carrying the cross-linker at position 36 within TM2 of MtlA did not show this adduct (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–3), since this cross-linking site is predicted to be buried within the ribosomal exit tunnel (cf. Fig. 2). In pOmtl-82 exposing the entire TM2 of MtlA (cf. Fig. 2) the Ffh adduct of the signal sequence became more prominent (Fig. 3A, lanes 11–13, upper panel), whereas immunoprecipitation revealed also some faint contact with TF (asterisk, lane 14). The same ligands were picked up when the cross-linker was placed into TM2 of MtlA, now with a relative increase in number of TF adducts (Fig. 3B, lanes 4–7). Irrespective of the position of Tmd-Phe, nascent chains of pOmtl-110 exposing about 30 amino acids downstream of TM2 of MtlA (cf. Fig. 2) overwhelmingly cross-linked to TF (Fig. 3A, lanes 15–18, upper panel, and B, lanes 8–11). Hence in pOmtl, the signal sequence of pOmpA and the TM2 of MtlA share the same molecular environment as observed previously for the signal sequence of pOmpA (13Eisner G. Koch H.G. Beck K. Brunner J. Müller M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar): they loose contact to Ffh in favor of one with TF when the nascent chain increases in length. Extension of the pOmtl nascent chain by another 30 amino acids (pOmtl-140) did not change the predominant liganding of TM2 of MtlA to TF (Fig. 3B, cf. lanes 8–15), whereas the signal sequence of pOmtl-140 showed about as many contacts with Ffh as with TF (Fig. 3A, lanes 19–22). Remarkably, however, as soon as TM3 of MtlA, which by its topogenic information is a signal anchor sequence, became fully exposed in pOmtl-169 nascent chains (cf. Fig. 2), the preceding signal sequence almost exclusively cross-linked to Ffh (Fig. 3A, lanes 23–26, upper panel) and also TM2 of MtlA showed relatively many more Ffh adducts than in the shorter pOmtl-140 and pOmtl-110. Obviously the signal sequence regained contact to Ffh upon exposure of a downstream signal anchor sequence. Incidentally, incorporation of Tmd-Phe into TM3 of MtlA had revealed multiple Ffh binding sites (Ref. 30Beck K. Eisner G. Trescher D. Dalbey R.E. Brunner J. Müller M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar and data not shown). The cross-linking data illustrated in Fig. 3 therefore suggest that it is this late signal anchor TM3 that recruits SRP to the nascent chain of pOmtl-169 and that the signal sequence and TM2 must be so close that both resume contact to Ffh. The formation of such a helix bundle-type structure of nascent pOmtl-169 at the ribosomal exit site is supported by data shown in Fig. 3A (lanes 23–26); in addition to Ffh, the cross-linker placed in the signal sequence yields a strong adduct of pOmtl-169 with a 8 kDa protein (black star), which is immunoprecipitated with antibodies against ribosomal protein L29 (lower panel). Cross-linking to L29 was not observed for TM2 (Fig. 3B, lanes 16 and 17). On the other hand, also the shorter chains pOmtl-82 and pOmtl-110 were found to cross-link to ribosomal proteins L29 and L23 (Fig. 3A, lanes 11–18, black and white stars, respectively). These findings indicate that even after exposure of more than 130 amino acids the signal sequence of nascent pOmtl is not freely mobile but remains closely apposed to the ribosomal exit site. Ffh and TF Compete for the Same Nascent Chains—Among the various pOmtl nascent chains analyzed thus far, pOmtl-110 and pOmtl-169 display the most distinct liganding behavior. When the two species are synthesized in the presence of both Ffh and TF, the signal sequence present in pOmtl-110 picks TF as interaction partner (“TF binder”) and that of pOmtl-169 Ffh (“SRP binder”). Thus the molecular vicinity of the signal sequence in the folding pOmtl nascent chain appears to be determined by the nature of downstream sequence sections. These findings do, however, not allow for predicting the fate of the disfavored ligand; while it is virtually not found in contact with the nascent pOmtl chain, it might still remain bound to the synthesizing ribosome via L23/L29. In the experiments summarized in Fig. 3, cross-links of a given nascent chain obtained with either of the two positions of Tmd-Phe were not always entirely identical. Thus by comparison with the signal sequence, TM2 showed relatively more contacts with TF than with SRP (cf. pOmtl-82 and pOmtl-140 in A and B). While this finding could reflect a closer location of TM2 to the ribosome-bound TF, it raised the general question as to the influence of the sidedness of the cross-linker on the liganding pattern. In theory, the changing cross-linking partners of a growing pOmtl nascent chain could also be the result of a change in conformation of a folded nascent chain at the ribosomal exit site. To render the results less dependent on the orientation of a single cross-linker, we employed the NH2-group-specific cross-linker DSS, as the N-terminal part of pOmtl including TM2 contains five lysyl residues. Likewise it seemed to be important to address the influence of various concentrations of Ffh and TF on the cross-linking behavior of pOmtl nascent chains. In the particular cell-free transcription/translation system used here, the endogenous concentration of Ffh is so low that Ffh cross-links to MtlA and its SRP-dependent integration into membrane vesicles are only observed if purified Ffh is added (6Beck K. Wu L.F. Brunner J. Müller M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 134-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 32Koch H.G. Hengelage T. Neumann-Haefelin C. MacFarlane J. Hoffschulte H.K. Schimz K.L. Mechler B. Müller M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2163-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). On the contrary, sufficient depletion of the cell-free system of TF requires preparing its components from a TF knock-out mutant strain. Fig. 4 illustrates the cross-linking results obtained for pOmtl-110 and pOmtl-169 synthesized under these adapted conditions. In the absence of Ffh and TF, DSS did not give rise to any specific adduct (lanes 1 and 2; the ones marked with • were present under"

Here we report a molecular definition of the regulatory mechanisms governing the dynamic changes in iron balance in Pcm heterozygous mice between 3 and 12 weeks of age. Hepatic and/or duodenal response patterns of iron metabolism genes, such as Trfr, cybrd1, and Slc11a2, explained the transition from early postnatal iron deficiency to iron overload by 12 weeks of age. A significant delay in developmental up-regulation of hepcidin (Hamp), the pivotal hormonal regulator of iron homeostasis, correlated with high levels of Fpn1 expression in hepatic Kupffer cells and duodenal epithelial cells at 7 weeks of age. Conversely, upon up-regulation of Hamp expression at 12 weeks of age, Fpn1 expression decreased, indicative of a Hamp-mediated homeostatic loop. Hamp regulation due to iron did not appear dependent on transcription-level changes of the murine homolog of Hemojuvelin (Rgmc). Aged cohorts of Pcm mice exhibited low levels of Fpn1 expression in the context of an iron-deficient erythropoiesis and profound iron sequestration in reticuloendothelial macrophages, duodenum, and other tissues. Thus, similar to the anemia of chronic disease, these findings demonstrate decreased iron bioavailability due to sustained down-regulation of Fpn1 levels by Hamp.

Trans-acting iron regulatory proteins bind to the iron-responsive element stem-loop structure, inhibiting Fpn1 mRNA translation under low intracellular iron conditions in tissue culture cells (6Abboud S.

Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2002; 29: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Hepcidin (Hamp), the principal hormonal regulator of iron homeostasis (1Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M.U. Andrews N.C. Cell. 2004; 117: 285-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar), controls Fpn1 expression levels at the cell surface by a post-translational mechanism. Upon Hamp binding to cell surface-bound Fpn1, the iron exporter becomes internalized and degraded in lysosomes (16Nemeth E. Tuttle M.S. Powelson J. Vaughn M.B. Donovan A. Ward D.M. Ganz T. Kaplan J. Science. 2004; 306: 2090-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (3691) Google Scholar). Importantly, this implicates the Hamp-Fpn1 axis in a homeostatic loop wherein, under conditions of high intracellular iron in hepatic stores, Hamp-mediated degradation of Fpn1 decreases duodenal iron uptake and macrophage iron release, preventing organismal iron overload. Coding region mutations in human FPN1 cause the autosomal dominant ferroportin disease (also referred to as hemochromatosis, type IV) (17Pietrangelo A. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2004; 32: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Furthermore, two mutant mouse models for Fpn1 function were recently described (3Mok H. Jelinek J. Pai S. Cattanach B.M. Prchal J.T. Youssoufian H. Schumacher A. Development. 2004; 131: 1859-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 5Donovan A. Lima C.A. Pinkus J.L. Pinkus G.S. Zon L.I. Robine S. Andrews N.C. Cell Metabol. 2005; 1: 191-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Constitutive or conditional deletion of several transmembrane domains confirmed Fpn1 function in maternal-to-fetal iron transport, export from duodenal enterocytes, and iron release from RES macrophages (5Donovan A. Lima C.A. Pinkus J.L. Pinkus G.S. Zon L.I. Robine S. Andrews N.C. Cell Metabol. 2005; 1: 191-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). The other mouse model involves a regulatory allele of Fpn1 generated by radiation mutagenesis. Positional cloning identified a 58-bp microdeletion in the Fpn1 promoter in polycythaemia (Pcm) mutant mice (3Mok H. Jelinek J. Pai S. Cattanach B.M. Prchal J.T. Youssoufian H. Schumacher A. Development. 2004; 131: 1859-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Depending on the developmental stage, tissue, and genotype, the microdeletion caused dynamic dysregulation of Fpn1 expression, resulting in both hypo- and hypermorphic phenotypes (3Mok H. Jelinek J. Pai S. Cattanach B.M. Prchal J.T. Youssoufian H. Schumacher A. Development. 2004; 131: 1859-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 4Mok H. Mendoza M. Prchal J.T. Balogh P. Schumacher A. Development. 2004; 131: 4871-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). During late gestation, decreased Fpn1 protein expression in placental syncytiotrophoblast cells resulted in a severe neonatal iron deficiency and a hypochromic, microcytic anemia in Pcm homozygotes, providing the first definitive evidence for Fpn1 function in maternal-to-fetal iron transport in mammals (4Mok H. Mendoza M. Prchal J.T. Balogh P. Schumacher A. Development. 2004; 131: 4871-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Postnatally, aberrant transcription initiation eliminated the iron-responsive element in the 5′-untranslated region of Fpn1 mRNA, increasing hepatic and duodenal Fpn1 protein levels (3Mok H. Jelinek J. Pai S. Cattanach B.M. Prchal J.T. Youssoufian H. Schumacher A. Development. 2004; 131: 1859-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The latter governed augmentation of intestinal iron uptake, reversing the perinatal iron deficiency to a tissue iron overload by 12 weeks of age. Strikingly, the majority of Pcm heterozygous animals displayed a transient erythropoietin-dependent polycythaemia with peak hematocrits of up to 80% during young adulthood, eponymous of the mutant strain (3Mok H. Jelinek J. Pai S. Cattanach B.M. Prchal J.T. Youssoufian H. Schumacher A. Development. 2004; 131: 1859-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Here we report the molecular mechanisms underlying the iron homeostasis defects in Pcm mice. The “IronChip” microarray platform and real-time quantitative RT-PCR accurately defined the hepatic and duodenal gene response patterns that governed the transition from early postnatal iron deficiency to tissue iron overload in young adult Pcm mice. In support of a Hamp-Fpn1 homeostatic loop in vivo, Pcm mice manifested an inverse correlation between Hamp mRNA levels and Fpn1 expression in RES macrophages and duodenal epithelial cells. Aged cohorts of Pcm mutant mice exhibited an iron-deficient erythropoiesis in the context of profound iron sequestration in RES macrophages and other cell types, constituting the end point of Pcm disease pathogenesis. Mice and Genotyping—Pcm mice on a partially congenic A/J background (N5 and later) were used for analysis and genotyped as described previously (3Mok H. Jelinek J. Pai S. Cattanach B.M. Prchal J.T. Youssoufian H. Schumacher A. Development. 2004; 131: 1859-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cohorts of Pcm and wild-type animals were aged to 8–19 months and fed a standard chow. All animal experiments in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Baylor College of Medicine. Microarray Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from liver and duodenum samples using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and prepared according to standard methods. Pools of total liver RNA from 6 Pcm heterozygotes and 6 wild-type mice at 3, 7, and 12 weeks of age were analyzed using the Mouse Version 6.0 of the IronChip as described previously (11Muckenthaler M. Roy C.N. Custodio A.O. Minana B. deGraaf J. Montross L.K. Andrews N.C. Hentze M.W. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Likewise, pools of total duodenal RNA from 6 Pcm heterozygotes and 6 wild-type mice were analyzed at 7 and 12 weeks of age. Expression values were calculated from dye swap experiments (18Richter A. Schwager C. Hentze S. Ansorge W. Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M. BioTechniques. 2002; 33 (630): 620-628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genes were represented by either single or multiple clones on the microarray platform. In the latter case, the average ratios and standard deviations were determined. The entire data set representing the expression values of all genes represented on the IronChip cDNA microarray platform will be submitted to Array express (European Bioinformatics Institute). Real-time RT-PCR Analysis—Reactions and signal detection were performed on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) using the following primers: Fpn1 (Mm00489837_m1), Hamp (Mm00519025_m1), Trfr (Mm00441941_m1), Slc11a2 (Mm00435363_m1), and Rgmc (Mm00510148_s1) (all from Applied Biosystems). 18 S rRNA assay was conducted using primers 5′-TCGAGGCCCTGTAATTGGAA-3′ (forward), 5′-CCCTCCAATGGATCCTCGTT-3′ (reverse), and TaqMan MGB probe 5′-AGTCCACTTTAAATCCTT-3′ labeled with VIC (Applied Biosystems). mRNA levels were expressed as a difference of cycles to threshold (ΔCT) between the gene-specific probe and 18 S standard; mean wild-type values were centered at zero. Histology and Immunohistochemistry—Liver and duodenal samples from various stages were processed as described previously (3Mok H. Jelinek J. Pai S. Cattanach B.M. Prchal J.T. Youssoufian H. Schumacher A. Development. 2004; 131: 1859-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A polyclonal Fpn1 antibody was generated in rabbit against oligopeptide sequence GPDEKEVTDENQPNTS at the carboxyl terminus of Fpn1 and immunoaffinity purified. Immunohistochemistry for Fpn1 and F4/80 (clone CI:A3–1; Serotec) was performed as described (4Mok H. Mendoza M. Prchal J.T. Balogh P. Schumacher A. Development. 2004; 131: 4871-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For Trfr antigen retrieval, sections were boiled in 0.01 m citric acid, pH 6.0, and blocking was achieved with horse serum. Primary antibody incubation was performed overnight at 4 °C using mouse α-TfR at 1:1000 dilution (Invitrogen). Prussian blue staining for iron was accomplished using the Accustain iron staining kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For comparison of protein expression levels, wild-type and Pcm mutant samples were mounted side by side on the same slide. Images were acquired with a Sony 085 CCD color RGB sensor digital camera mounted on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope. Iron Determination and Blood Cell Analyses—Non-heme tissue and serum iron were determined as described previously (3Mok H. Jelinek J. Pai S. Cattanach B.M. Prchal J.T. Youssoufian H. Schumacher A. Development. 2004; 131: 1859-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Hematocrit (Hct) measurements, expressed as a percentage, were obtained by standard microcapillary determination. Red cell parameters, including mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, as well as white blood cell (WBC) counts were determined on the ADVIA 120 hematology system (Bayer). Statistical Analyses—All data are reported as the mean ± S.D. All comparisons were made versus wild-type cohorts and analyzed for significant differences using the Student's unpaired t-test. To elucidate the consequences of dynamic Fpn1 dysregulation on the genetic circuitry governing iron metabolism, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and inflammation we used a highly sensitive and accurate cDNA microarray platform, the IronChip (11Muckenthaler M. Roy C.N. Custodio A.O. Minana B. deGraaf J. Montross L.K. Andrews N.C. Hentze M.W. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The analysis focused on gene expression in liver and duodenum, respectively, as sites of iron storage and absorption at 3, 7, and 12 weeks of age. In the context of the striking polycythaemia phenotype by young adulthood, heretofore not described in animal models of dysregulated iron metabolism, molecular analyses were directed toward Pcm heterozygotes. In comparison with previous microarray studies on mouse models of iron balance abnormalities (11Muckenthaler M. Roy C.N. Custodio A.O. Minana B. deGraaf J. Montross L.K. Andrews N.C. Hentze M.W. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 19Muckenthaler M. Richter A. Gunkel N. Riedel D. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Hentze S. Falkenhahn M. Stremmel W. Ansorge W. Hentze M.W. Blood. 2003; 101: 3690-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), Pcm mice presented discrete but highly reproducible differences in hepatic and duodenal gene expression during postnatal development (Fig. 1). To validate the microarray findings based on pooled RNA, the individual samples were subjected to real-time RT-PCR analysis using the most relevant probes. The average changes of differential gene expression along with the respective standard deviations are shown in supplemental Table S1. The Hamp-Fpn1 Homeostatic Loop—Neither microarray analysis nor quantitative RT-PCR detected statistically significant differences in duodenal and hepatic Fpn1 transcript levels between Pcm heterozygous and wild-type mice at 3, 7, and 12 weeks of age (Figs. 1 and 2, A and B). The lack of Fpn1 transcript up-regulation in 7-week Pcm heterozygous liver demonstrated a post-transcriptional mechanism of Fpn1 protein up-regulation in polycythaemic Pcm heterozygotes (3Mok H. Jelinek J. Pai S. Cattanach B.M. Prchal J.T. Youssoufian H. Schumacher A. Development. 2004; 131: 1859-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Importantly, hepatic Hamp mRNA levels were significantly reduced in Pcm heterozygotes at 7 weeks of age (Figs. 1 and 2C). However, this reflected a delay in developmental Hamp up-regulation because at 12 weeks of age Hamp mRNA levels in Pcm heterozygotes were significantly higher (microarrays) or similar (RT-PCR) to wild-type levels (Figs. 1 and 2D). Thus, delayed developmental up-regulation of Hamp is conducive to persistent elevation in Fpn1 protein expression in polycythaemic 7-week Pcm heterozygotes (3Mok H. Jelinek J. Pai S. Cattanach B.M. Prchal J.T. Youssoufian H. Schumacher A. Development. 2004; 131: 1859-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These results underscore the responsiveness of Hamp regulation to the dynamic changes in hepatic iron levels in the context of the Fpn1 regulatory allele. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, the Pcm mouse model provides the strongest evidence to date for the Hamp-Fpn1 homeostatic loop in vivo. Interestingly, despite statistically significant down-regulation of hepatic Hamp levels in polycythaemic 7-week-old Pcm heterozygotes, no difference in mRNA expression of Rgmc, the mouse homolog of Hemojuvelin and potential upstream regulator of Hamp (20Celec P. J. Mol. Med. 2005; 83: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), was observed in liver (Pcm/+ ΔCT Rgmc 0.39 ± 0.46 (n = 6) versus +/+ ΔCT Rgmc 0 ± 0.83 (n = 6); p = 0.33). These results support recent evidence for differential regulation of Hamp and Rgmc in response to iron balance or erythropoietin application (21Krijt J. Vokurka M. Chang K.T. Necas E. Blood. 2004; 104: 4308-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Response Patterns of Iron Metabolism Genes—In good agreement with the severe neonatal iron deficiency in Pcm mice (3Mok H. Jelinek J. Pai S. Cattanach B.M. Prchal J.T. Youssoufian H. Schumacher A. Development. 2004; 131: 1859-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 4Mok H. Mendoza M. Prchal J.T. Balogh P. Schumacher A. Development. 2004; 131: 4871-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), microarray analysis detected increased hepatic Trfr (transferrin receptor) mRNA expression in 3- and 7-week-old Pcm heterozygotes (Fig. 1). Quantitative RT-PCR showed no statistically significant difference between Pcm heterozygotes and wild-type controls at 7 weeks (Fig. 2E). However, both the IronChip and quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated a strong decrease in Trfr mRNA expression by 12 weeks of age (Figs. 1 and 2F). This result is consistent with destabilization of Trfr mRNA by a mechanism dependent on iron regulatory proteins (1Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M.U. Andrews N.C. Cell. 2004; 117: 285-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar) in response to hepatic iron accumulation in Pcm liver at 12 weeks of age (3Mok H. Jelinek J. Pai S. Cattanach B.M. Prchal J.T. Youssoufian H. Schumacher A. Development. 2004; 131: 1859-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), obviating Trfr-dependent cellular iron uptake. Likewise, increased Hmox1 (heme oxygenase 1) mRNA levels in 7- and 12 week-old Pcm heterozygotes can be explained by the increased need for heme catabolism in polycythaemic animals, heralding hepatic iron accumulation (Fig. 1). Consistent with marked systemic iron requirement and low hepatic Hamp mRNA expression, duodenal Trfr, cybrd1 (duodenal cytochrome b), and Slc11a2 (solute carrier 11a2; also known as Nramp2, Dmt1) mRNA levels of Pcm heterozygotes at 7 weeks of age were increased (Figs. 1 and 2G). Increased expression of these iron transporters reverted to wild-type levels at 12 weeks of age (Figs. 1 and 2H). Therefore, coordinated shifts in transcriptional expression patterns of these genes are sufficient to explain the transitory iron loading in Pcm heterozygotes. Response Patterns of Selected Iron Metabolism Proteins in Liver and Duodenum—At 3 weeks of age, Trfr was expressed at moderate levels in wild-type liver, whereas Pcm heterozygotes displayed significant up-regulation of this protein (Fig. 3A; compare with mRNA results in Fig. 1). Inspection under high magnification suggested significant augmentation of Trfr levels in Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells, contrasting with a more subtle increase in expression in hepatocytes (data not shown). At 12 weeks, Pcm heterozygotes demonstrated significantly lower Trfr levels compared with wild-type liver (Fig. 3B), consistent with the mRNA results (Fig. 1). Elevated Trfr protein expression in duodenum from 7-week-old Pcm heterozygotes restored Trfr to levels indistinguishable from wild-type littermates at 12 weeks of age (Fig. 3, C and D; compare with mRNA results in Fig. 1). Thus, immunohistochemistry corroborated the Trfr mRNA response patterns in liver and duodenum. At 7 weeks of age, Pcm heterozygous duodenum exhibited significant elevation of Fpn1 expression compared with wild-type littermates (Fig. 3E). Increased expression was particularly evident at the basolateral membrane of the epithelial cells. Conversely, at 12 weeks of age, Pcm heterozygotes were remarkable for markedly lower Fpn1 expression levels compared with wild-type (Fig. 3F). Because Fpn1 mRNA levels were indistinguishable between Pcm heterozygotes and wild-type at both 7 and 12 weeks of age (Fig. 1), the changes in protein levels strongly supported the notion of Hamp-mediated post-translational regulation of Fpn1 expression. Down-regulation of Fpn1 Expression and Reticuloendothelial Iron Overload—We previously demonstrated a significant augmentation of Fpn1 protein expression in Pcm mutant liver during early postnatal development (3Mok H. Jelinek J. Pai S. Cattanach B.M. Prchal J.T. Youssoufian H. Schumacher A. Development. 2004; 131: 1859-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). By immunohistochemistry, increased Fpn1 expression localized predominantly to punctate, stellate-shaped cells at 3 weeks of age (Fig. 4A). Based on a similar staining pattern for F4/80 (data not shown), the antibody to which recognizes a macrophage-restricted glycoprotein of the epidermal growth factor 7 family (22McKnight A.J. Macfarlane A.J. Dri P. Turley L. Willis A.C. Gordon S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 486-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), marked up-regulation of Fpn1 in Pcm mutants localized to Kupffer cells. Likewise, persistent elevation of Fpn1 protein expression at 7 weeks of age localized predominantly to Kupffer cells in polycythaemic Pcm heterozygotes (data not shown). In contrast, the small subset of Pcm heterozygotes with normal hematocrit as well as Pcm homozygotes displayed wild-type levels of hepatic Fpn1 expression (data not shown). By 12 weeks of age, the Fpn1 expression pattern was indistinguishable between wild-type and Pcm mutant liver (Fig. 4B). This down-regulation of Fpn1 expression correlated with RES iron accumulation in Pcm homozygous liver by 12 weeks of age (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, hepatic Fpn1 expression remained near base-line levels in aged Pcm homozygotes (Fig. 4D), whereas significant iron accumulation persisted (Fig. 4E). Large accumulations of iron, consistent with hemosiderosis, were observed in cells staining against F4/80 (Fig. 4F). Notably, the overall number of macrophages appeared similar between aged wild-type and mutant livers (Fig. 4F), and collagen staining revealed no evidence of widespread fibrosis (data not shown). The Disease End Point in Aged Pcm Animals—Several parameters of iron homeostasis were determined in Pcm mice between 8 and 19 months of age. Analysis of age subgroups did not reveal any phenotypic difference, indicating that by 8 months of age all Pcm mice had reached the disease end point (data not shown). Hepatic iron levels remained many-fold elevated in aged Pcm animals (Fig. 5A) in a predominantly punctate pattern of distribution (Fig. 4E). Other tissues, including kidney (Fig. 5B), duodenum (Fig. 5C), and heart (Fig. 5D), also demonstrated significant elevation in iron content. Strikingly, no difference in brain iron levels was observed in aged Pcm mutants (Fig. 5E). This was also observed in the context of normal brain iron balance in humans with hereditary hemochromatosis or secondary iron overload (23Ponka P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1012: 267-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Importantly, serum iron levels were significantly reduced in aged Pcm homozygotes (Fig. 5F). Microcapillary determination of Hct revealed a graded severity of anemia in aged Pcm mutants (+/+ Hct 39.9 ± 1.8% (n = 19); Pcm/+ Hct 35.0 ± 3.4% (n = 16), p < 0.0001; Pcm/Pcm Hct 32.5 ± 2.2% (n = 22); p < 0.0001). Pcm homozygotes also displayed significant microcytosis (Pcm/Pcm mean corpuscular volume 41.5 ± 1.3 fl (n = 17) versus +/+ mean corpuscular volume 52.1 ± 4.0 fl (n = 15); p < 0.0001); no differences in mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration were observed (data not shown). Consistent with RES iron accumulation and reduced serum iron levels in aged animals, real-time RT-PCR analysis of hepatic Hamp transcript levels revealed a trend toward increased expression, albeit not at statistically significant levels (+/+ ΔCT Hamp 0 ± 3.27 (n = 8); Pcm/+ ΔCT Hamp 1.74 ± 0.61 (n = 7), p = 0.19; Pcm/Pcm ΔCT Hamp 1.84 ± 0.74 (n = 8); p = 0.14). Red cell parameters and white blood cell counts in aged cohorts of Pcm animals are shown in supplemental Table S2. A modest but significant elevation in WBC was observed in both heterozygotes (Pcm/+ WBC 1.2 ± 0.42 103 cells/μl (n = 10) versus +/+ WBC 0.87 ± 0.32 103 cells/μl (n = 15); p = 0.027) and homozygotes (Pcm/Pcm WBC 1.7 ± 0.99 103 cells/μl(n = 17); p = 0.0044). This was primarily reflective of an increase in absolute lymphocyte count and, to a lesser degree, neutrophil count. No statistically significant differences in monocyte, eosinophil, or basophil counts were observed. In the context of a semidominant defect in spleen development in Pcm animals (4Mok H. Mendoza M. Prchal J.T. Balogh P. Schumacher A. Development. 2004; 131: 4871-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the increased presence of circulating white blood cells in aged Pcm mice results from the defects in this significant repository site for immune cells. In recent years, positional cloning of iron disease loci in both humans and mutant mouse models, complemented by transgenic and gene knock-out studies in mice, have identified many genes involved in iron metabolism (1Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M.U. Andrews N.C. Cell. 2004; 117: 285-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). The challenge now resides in dissecting the function of the encoded proteins and their integration into the regulatory circuits governing cellular and organismal iron homeostasis. These investigations will benefit greatly from the availability of mouse strains, such as Pcm, with regulatory mutations in critical components of the pathways. The Pcm mouse mutant exhibits the gamut of iron balance disorders, ranging from iron deficiency at birth to tissue iron overload by young adulthood (3Mok H. Jelinek J. Pai S. Cattanach B.M. Prchal J.T. Youssoufian H. Schumacher A. Development. 2004; 131: 1859-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 4Mok H. Mendoza M. Prchal J.T. Balogh P. Schumacher A. Development. 2004; 131: 4871-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The present study defined, in molecular terms, the regulatory interferences underlying the dynamic changes in iron homeostasis in Pcm mice. For example, duodenal and/or hepatic expression of Fpn1 and Trfr protein, as well as Hamp, cybrd1 and Slc11a2 mRNA, explained the transition from early postnatal iron deficiency to iron overload in 12-week old Pcm mice. In comparison with previous studies (10Dupic F. Fruchon S. Bensaid M. Loreal O. Brissot P. Borot N. Roth M.P. Coppin H. Gut. 2002; 51: 648-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 11Muckenthaler M. Roy C.N. Custodio A.O. Minana B. deGraaf J. Montross L.K. Andrews N.C. Hentze M.W. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), these results demonstrate transcriptional responsiveness of the duodenal iron transport system to organismal and/or cellular iron balance. These changes in gene expression are likely to result directly or indirectly from alterations in Hamp signaling. Recently, it was shown that, under conditions of augmented erythropoiesis and decreased Hamp expression, mRNA and protein levels of Slc11a2 and Cybrd1 increased (24Latunde-Dada G.O. Vulpe C.D. Anderson G.J. Simpson R.J. McKie A.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1690: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, genetically Hamp-deficient mice demonstrated up-regulation of Slc11a2, Cybrd1, and Fpn1 expression (25Viatte L. Lesbordes-Brion J.C. Lou D.Q. Bennoun M. Nicolas G. Kahn A. Canonne-Hergaux F. Vaulont S. Blood. 2005; 105: 4861-4864Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that polycythaemic 7-week-old Pcm heterozygotes demonstrate decreased Hamp expression in the context of significant alterations in mRNA levels of iron-related genes, such as iron transporters. In addition, cellular regulation responsive to Fpn1-mediated elevated iron efflux from intestinal enterocytes leading to increased mRNA expression of iron transporters in Pcm heterozygotes must be considered (26Frazer D.M. Anderson G.J. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2003; 30: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence suggests that Rgmc, a second causative gene for juvenile onset hereditary hemochromatosis (type II), functions upstream of Hamp (20Celec P. J. Mol. Med. 2005; 83: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Conceivably, profound down-regulation of Hamp in polycythaemic Pcm heterozygotes at 7 weeks of age constitutes an appropriate in vivo context to discern expression differences in putative upstream regulators, including Rgmc. However, mRNA levels of Rgmc were indistinguishable between wild-type and 7-week old Pcm heterozygotes. Similarly, work by Krijt et al. (21Krijt J. Vokurka M. Chang K.T. Necas E. Blood. 2004; 104: 4308-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) revealed no differences in Rgmc transcript levels following treatment of mice with iron or erythropoietin, known regulators of Hamp expression. Thus, Hamp regulation in response to iron status is not likely to depend on changes in Rgmc transcription. Recently, it was shown that Hamp expression is regulated developmentally (21Krijt J. Vokurka M. Chang K.T. Necas E. Blood. 2004; 104: 4308-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Compared with fetal development, perinatal Hamp expression decreases by the order of several magnitudes, reaching lowest levels by P8. As postnatal development proceeds, Hamp levels gradually return to high levels by adulthood. Fig. 6 depicts a model wherein delayed up-regulation of Hamp in the context of increased Fpn1 mRNA translation from iron-responsive element-less transcripts (3Mok H. Jelinek J. Pai S. Cattanach B.M. Prchal J.T. Youssoufian H. Schumacher A.

Therein, dysregulated Fpn1-mediated duodenal uptake overcompensates for the perinatal iron deficiency and causes organismal iron overload. Upon up-regulation of Hamp by 12 weeks of age, Fpn1 levels decrease in a distinctly post-transcriptional manner, iron uptake ceases, and iron becomes increasingly sequestered in RES macrophages and duodenal epithelial cells. This heralds the Pcm disease end point at a fairly early stage, because aged cohorts of Pcm mutant mice exhibited an iron-deficient erythropoiesis in the context of marked iron sequestration in RES macrophages, duodenum, and other tissues, as well as reduced serum iron levels. Similar to the anemia of chronic disease caused by other disease mechanisms (27Jurado R.L. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1997; 25: 888-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), it remains an enigma why signaling through the iron-deficient erythron is insufficient to reverse Hamp up-regulation and thus ameliorate iron sequestration and anemia in aged Pcm mice. Nonetheless, iron-deficient erythropoiesis marks both the beginning and the end point of the hematopoietic defects in Pcm mice. However, whereas embryonic/perinatal anemia results from primary organismal iron deficiency (4Mok H. Mendoza M. Prchal J.T. Balogh P. Schumacher A. Development. 2004; 131: 4871-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), adult Pcm mice develop anemia because of decreased iron bioavailability despite organismal iron overload. The polycythaemia develops at the transition phase between the two disease states, governed by unimpeded erythropoietin signaling (3Mok H. Jelinek J. Pai S. Cattanach B.M. Prchal J.T. Youssoufian H. Schumacher A. Development. 2004; 131: 1859-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recent studies have described several mechanisms by which mutations in human FPN could lead to type IV hereditary hemochromatosis, including unresponsiveness to Hamp-mediated degradation, defects in cell surface localization, and dominant-negative effects on cellular processing of wild-type FPN (28Drakesmith H. Schimanski L.M. Ormerod E. Merryweather-Clarke A.T. Viprakasit V. Edwards J.P. Sweetland E. Bastin J.M. Cowley D. Chinthammitr Y. Robson K.J. Townsend A.R.

A. 2005; 102: 8955-8960Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Phenotypic and molecular analyses of Pcm mice support an additional disease mechanism wherein augmented Fpn1-mediated iron uptake earlier in life is followed by RES iron sequestration and microcytic anemia due to homeostatic Hamp signaling. Interestingly, a loss-of-function mutation in Fpn1 did not result in significant hepatic iron overload in heterozygous mice (5Donovan A. Lima C.A. Pinkus J.L. Pinkus G.S. Zon L.I. Robine S. Andrews N.C. Cell Metabol. 2005; 1: 191-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, Pcm represents the first in vivo model system demonstrating disease end points commonly detected in type IV hemochromatosis. Additionally, the present results suggest that, due to the dynamic nature of iron homeostasis, analyses of in vivo models should require consideration of various stages in pre- and postnatal development as the phenotypic richness and regulatory intricacies cannot be appreciated by the description of one or two stages alone.

Bioinformatic analysis suggests that YkuV is a homolog of membrane-anchored proteins and belongs to the thioredoxin-like protein superfamily containing the typical Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys active motif. However, the biological function of this protein remains unknown thus far. In order to elucidate the biological function, we have determined the solution structures of both the oxidized and reduced forms of B. subtilis YkuV by NMR spectroscopy and performed biochemical studies. Our results demonstrated that the reduced YkuV has a low midpoint redox potential, allowing it to reduce a variety of protein substrates. The overall structures of both oxidized and reduced forms are similar, with a typical thioredoxin-like fold. However, significant conformational changes in the Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys active motif of the tertiary structures are observed between the two forms. In addition, the backbone dynamics provide further insights in understanding the strong redox potential of the reduced YkuV. Furthermore, we demonstrated that YkuV is able to reduce different protein substrates in vitro. Together, our results clearly established that YkuV may function as a general thiol:disulfide oxidoreductase, which acts as an alternative for thioredoxin or thioredoxin reductase to maintain the reducing environment in the cell cytoplasm.

Together, our results clearly established that YkuV may function as a general thiol:disulfide oxidoreductase, which acts as an alternative for thioredoxin or thioredoxin reductase to maintain the reducing environment in the cell cytoplasm. Thioredoxins are small proteins (∼12 kDa) that are ubiquitously present in all kinds of life forms from archaebacteria to human (1Holmgren A. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 239-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Generally, they function as protein thiol:disulfide oxidoreductases for maintaining the reducing environment in cytoplasm, protecting cells against hydrogen peroxide (2Chae H.Z. Kim H.J. Kim K. Rhee S.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1478Google Scholar) and oxidative stress (3Smits W.K. Dubois J.Y. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Kuipers O.P. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3921-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition to the general function as a thiol:disulfide oxidoreductase, some thioredoxins from different organisms are also involved in various specified biological processes and therefore have specific biological functions. For example, thioredoxin is an essential subunit of bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase in Escherichia coli (4Mark D.F. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 780-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and in eukaryotes, thioredoxins facilitate the refolding of disulfide-containing proteins (5Lundstrom J. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9114-9120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and modulate the activity of certain transcription factors (6Schulze-Osthoff K. Schenk H. Droge W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Bloomfield K.L. Osborne S.A. Kennedy D.D. Clarke F.M. Tonissen K.F. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 319: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Moreover, thioredoxins have been considered as a possible target for drug development because of their roles in stimulating cancer cell growth and as an inhibitor of apoptosis (8Powis G. Mustacich D. Coon A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 312-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The thioredoxin fold was first characterized from E. coli thioredoxin, which consists of a central five-stranded mixed β-sheet surrounded by four α-helices (9Holmgren A. Söderberg B.O. Eklund H.

Subsequently, the structures of several thioredoxins from different species were determined (11Jeng M.-F. Campbell A.P. Begley T. Holmgren A. Case D.A. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J.

Structure (Lond.). 1994; 2: 503-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Notably, from E. coli to human, thioredoxins all share the same thioredoxin fold with the Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys active motif. In addition to thioredoxins, a large number of proteins comprising the basic thioredoxin fold with the Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys active motif in the active site have been characterized as thioredoxin-like proteins, which consist of a central four-stranded mixed β-sheet surrounded by three α-helices (17Qi Y. Grishin N.V. Proteins. 2005; 58: 376-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 18Martin J.L. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Although they adopt the similar thioredoxin-fold structure, these thioredoxin-like proteins have diverse target specificities, redox activities, and cellular localizations, suggesting their various biological functions (17Qi Y. Grishin N.V. Proteins. 2005; 58: 376-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Different from the Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, the Grampositive bacterium Bacillus subtilis does not have a glutaredoxin system because of the lack of enzymes for glutathione synthesis (19Kunst F. Ogasawara N. Moszer I. Albertini A.M. Alloni G. Azevedo V. Bertero M.G. Bessières P. Bolotin A. Borchert S. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3127) Google Scholar). So far, thioredoxin (TrxA) 2The abbreviations used are: TrxA, thioredoxin; TrxB, thioredoxin reductase; ArsC, arsenate reductase; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; DTT, 1,4-dithiothreitol; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; CMP, cytochrome maturation protein; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy. and thioredoxin reductase (TrxB) are the only enzymes identified in B. subtilis for maintaining the cytoplasmic thiol balance (3Smits W.K. Dubois J.Y. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Kuipers O.P. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3921-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is well known that TrxA encoded by the trxA gene is essential for B. subtilis. In addition to disulfide reduction, it is also involved in many important biological processes such as stress response (20Scharf C. Riethdorf S. Ernst H. Engelmann S. Völker U. Hecker M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1869-1877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), protein secretion, competence development, and sporulation (3Smits W.K. Dubois J.Y. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Kuipers O.P. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3921-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis revealed that there are at least seven genes (ykuV, ybdE, ydbP, ydfQ, yosR, ytpP, and yusE) in B. subtilis genome encoding cytoplasmic thioredoxin-like proteins (3Smits W.K. Dubois J.Y. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Kuipers O.P. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3921-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which leads to an open question: are any products of these genes also engaged in these biological processes? Protein YkuV encoded by the ykuV gene from B. subtilis was annotated as a hypothetical protein with unknown biological function (21Moszer I. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis suggested that it belongs to the thioredoxin-like protein superfamily (22Zhang X. Yu C. Xia B. Jin C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2005; 32: 258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Homology modeling showed that YkuV together with YbdE are structurally similar to the cytochrome maturation proteins (CMPs), such as the recently discovered ResA from B. subtilis (23Copley S.D. Novak W.R. Babbitt P.C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13981-13995Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). ResA is a membrane-anchored protein with an N-terminal trans-membrane helix and an outer membrane thioredoxin-like region (24Erlendsson L.S. Acheson R.M. Hederstedt L. Le Brun N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17852-17858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 25Crow A. Acheson R.M. Le Brun N.E. Oubrie A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23654-23660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Besides YkuV and YbdE, the other five cytoplasmic thioredoxin-like proteins in B. subtilis are structurally more similar to the canonical cytoplasmic thioredoxin (26Douguet D. Labesse G. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 752-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Among all these thioredoxin-like proteins, YkuV is the only one that shows response to environmental ethanol and heat stresses besides TrxA (27Petersohn A. Brigulla M. Haas S. Hoheisel J.D. Völker U. Hecker M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5617-5631Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), implying that its function may be important for B. subtilis to adapt to the environmental stress. In order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the biological function of this thioredoxin-like protein, we performed a series of studies, including kinetics, structure determinations, and protein dynamics. We have solved the solution structures of B. subtilis YkuV in the biologically relevant reduced and oxidized states by high resolution NMR spectroscopy. The solution structures reveal significant conformational changes between the redox states. In addition, we have also characterized the backbone dynamic properties of this protein, which provide further insights in understanding the low redox potential of the reduced YkuV. These results in conjunction with the in vitro experiments strongly suggest that YkuV may function as a general thiol:disulfide oxidoreductase in vivo. Sample Preparation—The B. subtilis ykuV gene was cloned into pET21a(+) expression vector and expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3). The cell culture was grown in 1000 ml of LB medium, centrifuged, and resuspended in 500 ml of M9 minimal medium at 37 °C with ampicillin and 15NH4Cl in the presence or absence of 13C6-glucose for the Preparations of 13C/15N-labeled or 15N-labeled samples, respectively (28Marley J. Lu M. Bracken C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). YkuV was purified by anion-exchange chromatography (DEAE) and gel filtration (Superdex 75) with the ÄKTA FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). The purity was determined to be greater than 95% as judged by SDS-PAGE. NMR samples were prepared with 1 mm YkuV dissolved in 90% H2O, 10% D2O buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate and 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.4) and were flushed with argon. The reduced form of YkuV was obtained by adding excess DTT (50 mm). The oxidized sample was prepared by incubating YkuV with an excess oxidized form of glutathione (10 mm) at room temperature for 3 h, followed by gel filtration to remove the oxidants. The redox state of the thiol groups was monitored using 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) incubations (29Riddles P.W. Blakely R.L. Zemer B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). The B. subtilis ykuU gene was cloned into pET24a(+) expression vector with a C-terminal His tag. The protein was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified by a His-Trap HP column (Amersham Biosciences). The reduced and oxidized forms of YkuU samples were obtained by adding excess DTT or H2O2, respectively. DTT or H2O2 were subsequently removed by gel filtration. The redox states of the thiol groups were confirmed by DTNB incubations. The protein was dissolved in the same buffer as for YkuV. The B. subtilis trxB gene encoding the thioredoxin reductase (TrxB) was cloned into pET21a(+) expression vector. TrxB protein was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified by using similar protocols as described for YkuV. The preparation of the oxidized B. subtilis arsenate reductase (ArsC) sample was reported previously (30Peng K. Su X.D. Xia B. Jin C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 29: 459-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The Midpoint Redox Potential—For determination of the redox potential, the reduced form of YkuV (5 μm) in deoxygenated buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.4) was incubated with 5 mm reduced DTT for 3 h at room temperature to generate the fully reduced YkuV. DTT was subsequently removed using gel filtration. We followed the common procedures for determination of the redox potential (24Erlendsson L.S. Acheson R.M. Hederstedt L. Le Brun N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17852-17858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, by varying the ratios of oxidized and reduced DTT while keeping the total concentration constant (5 mm), different potentials were generated, and each reaction was allowed to equilibrate for 4 h at room temperature. The fluorescence emission intensity at 337 nm was measured following the excitation at 280 nm. The measurements were repeated using the oxidized form of YkuV. During the calculations of the redox potential, the value of -330 mV for the standard redox potential of DTT (pH 7.0) and a correction coefficient of -59 mV per pH unit increment were used (31Hutchison R.S. Ort D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Protein Interactions—For YkuV-YkuU interaction, the oxidized YkuU containing the His tag was dissolved in 10 ml of deoxygenated buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate and 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.4). The reduced form of 15N-labeled YkuV was mixed with the oxidized YkuU. The mixture was allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for 1.5 h and subsequently loaded onto the His-Trap HP column with the ÄKTA FPLC system. The flow-through was collected and concentrated immediately for NMR analysis. A parallel control experiment was carried out while YkuU was absent in the system. For the YkuV-ArsC interaction, reaction 15N-labeled oxidized B. subtilis ArsC sample was prepared in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.4). Thiol group titration and two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC experiments were performed to examine the redox states of ArsC. Excess reduced YkuV (unlabeled) was added in the ArsC sample. Two-dimensional HSQC experiments were recorded to monitor the redox state of ArsC. In parallel, similar NMR experiments were performed using 15N-labeled YkuV and excess ArsC (unlabeled) to probe the redox state of YkuV. The reaction between thioredoxin reductase (TrxB) and the oxidized form of YkuV was performed under the same conditions as that used for YkuV-ArsC, except that 1 mm NADPH was added to provide the reducing power. HSQC spectra were recorded to monitor the redox state of YkuV. An experiment without TrxB was also performed as a control. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were performed at 25 °C on Bruker Avance 500-MHz (equipped with cryoprobe) and 800-MHz spectrometers equipped with triple-resonance probes with pulsed field gradients. The spectra were processed with the software package NMRPipe (32Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar) and analyzed by the program NMRView (33Johnson B.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 313-352PubMed Google Scholar). The two-dimensional 15N-edited HSQC, three-dimensional triple-resonance spectra HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCA, and HN(CO)CA were collected for the backbone assignments (34Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog. Nucl. Mag. Res. Sp. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional spectra HBHA(CO)NH, HCCH-COSY, (H)CCH-COSY, H(CC)(CO)NH-TOCSY, and (H)(CC)(CO)NH-TOCSY were recorded to assign the side chain atoms (35Kay L.E. Ikura M. Tshudin R. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 89: 496-514Google Scholar, 36Wittekind M. Müller L. J. Magn. Reson. 1993; 101: 201-205Crossref Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 37Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Biomol.

Driscoll P.C. Gronenborn A.M. Ikura M. Kay L.E. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 87: 620-627Google Scholar), which were confirmed with the three-dimensional 15N-edited TOCSY-HSQC (mixing time 80 ms) spectrum. The three-dimensional 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC (mixing times 50 and 100 ms) spectra were recorded to confirm the assignments and generate distance restraints for structure calculations. The three-dimensional HNHA experiment was performed to obtain the dihedral angle restraints (40Kuboniwa H. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Hydrogen-deuterium (H-D) exchange experiments were performed to obtain hydrogen-bonding information. Structure Calculations—The structures of the reduced and oxidized forms of YkuV were calculated using the program CYANA (41Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar) and refined by AMBER (42Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.R. Cheatham T.E. II I DeBolt S. Ferguson D. Seibel G. Kollman P. Comp. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2670) Google Scholar). The inter-proton nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) was employed to generate the distance restraints from threedimensional 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra. The backbone dihedral angle restraints were determined using the program TALOS (43Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bond restraints were generated from the H-D exchange experiments in conjunction with the intermediate range NOEs and the secondary structural information. The initial structures were calculated with the CANDID module of the CYANA program (41Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar, 44Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). In the first step, 50 structures were calculated, and the 10 lowest energy structures were selected as models for SANE to extend the NOE assignments (45Duggan B.M. Legge G.B. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 19: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In the next step, 200 structures were calculated with CYANA by the standard simulated annealing protocol using NOE distance restraints in conjunction with the dihedral angle and hydrogenbonding information. In the following step, 100 structures with the lowest target function were selected and further refined using the program AMBER (42Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.R. Cheatham T.E. II I DeBolt S. Ferguson D. Seibel G. Kollman P. Comp. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2670) Google Scholar). Finally, the 10 lowest energy structures were selected as representative of the final structure and were further inspected by the program packages MOLMOL (46Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 29-32Crossref Scopus (6490) Google Scholar) and PROCHECK_NMR (47Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4429) Google Scholar). Backbone Relaxation Parameters—The 15N longitudinal relaxation rates R1, transverse relaxation rates R2, and steady-state heteronuclear {1H}-15N NOE values of the reduced and oxidized forms of YkuV were determined using conventional pulse sequences (48Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar). The experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance 800-MHz NMR spectrometer at 25 °C. Spectral widths of 11160.7 Hz for 1H and 2432.8 Hz for 15N were used. For the R1 and R2 measurements, 512 (1H) and 128 (15N) complex data points were collected with 32 transients per increment and a recycle delay of 2.5 s. The delays used for the R1 experiments were 10 (×2), 100, 300, 500, 800, 1000, 1200, 1600, 2000, 2500, and 2800 ms, and those used for the R2 experiments were 8 (×2), 32, 56, 80, 104, 128, 152, 176, 200, and 240 ms. The relaxation rate constants were obtained by fitting the peak intensities to a single exponential function using the nonlinear least square method as described previously (49Fushman D. Cahill S. Cowburn D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 173-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The {1H}-15N NOE experiments were performed in the presence and absence of a 3-s proton presaturation period prior to the 15N excitation pulse and using recycle delays of 2 and 5 s, respectively (50Markley L.J. Horsley W.J. Klein M.P. J. Chem. Phys. 1971; 55: 3604-3605Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Forty eight transients were collected for each experiment. Accession Numbers—The chemical shift assignments of the reduced and oxidized forms of B. subtilis YkuV have been deposited in the BioMagResBank data base under accession numbers 6603 and 6847. The coordinates of the corresponding structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession numbers 2B5X and 2B5Y. Cloning and Expression—The B. subtilis ykuV gene has been reported to encode a putative 153-amino acid residue protein (19Kunst F. Ogasawara N. Moszer I. Albertini A.M. Alloni G. Azevedo V. Bertero M.G. Bessières P. Bolotin A. Borchert S. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3127) Google Scholar). We cloned ykuV from a B. subtilis cDNA library by PCR. DNA sequencing of the cloned ykuV gene revealed a deoxythymidylate insertion near the 3′ terminus, which is not present in the ykuV sequence in the data base. This insertion causes an open reading frameshift, which replaces the last 10 residues WLKRNRYLTK by five residues (LAETE). Sequencing of additional individual clones revealed identical DNA sequences with the deoxythymidylate insertion. In an effort to generate ykuV sequences as reported in the data base, we deleted the extra deoxythymidylate. The resulting protein appeared in the inclusion body in E. coli and could not be refolded. In contrast, the YkuV protein we cloned could easily be expressed in E. coli. In addition, the new protein sequence containing this difference is locally well aligned with its homolog, the YkuV protein from Bacillus licheniformis, which is considered the closest relative species of B. subtilis (51Rey M.W. Ramaiya P. Nelson B.A. Brody-Karpin S.D. Zaretsky E.J. Tang M. Lopez de Leon A. Xiang H. Gusti V. Clausen I.G. Olsen P.B. Rasmussen M.D. Andersen J.T. Jorgensen P.L. Larsen T.S. Sorokin A. Bolotin A. Lapidus A. Galleron N. Ehrlich S.D. Berka R.M. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: R77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the secondary structure prediction in combination with the homology modeling indicated that the altered residues do not change the secondary structures, and the extended residues have no effect on the global fold. Therefore, all our analyses were performed with the new YkuV protein sequence. Redox Potential—To determine whether YkuV belongs to the family of thiol:disulfide oxidoreductases, we measured its redox potential as shown in Fig. 1. The redox potential of -332 ± 5 mV (pH 7.4) was obtained by curve fitting (24Erlendsson L.S. Acheson R.M. Hederstedt L. Le Brun N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17852-17858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The value decreased to -308 mV (pH 7.0) when a correction of -59 mV per pH unit was used, which is characteristic for the involvement of two protons and two electrons in the redox process as expected for a thiol:disulfide oxidoreductase. The low redox potential suggests that YkuV belongs to the family of low potential, cytoplasmic thiol:disulfide oxidoreductases, such as TrxA from E. coli (24Erlendsson L.S. Acheson R.M. Hederstedt L.

Solution Structures of the Reduced and Oxidized Forms of B. subtilis YkuV—The chemical shift assignments for the reduced YkuV have been reported previously (22Zhang X. Yu C. Xia B. Jin C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2005; 32: 258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Briefly, nearly complete backbone and side chain resonance assignments were obtained, except for residues His42, Ser131, Met133, and Lys134. For the oxidized YkuV, more than 90% of the chemical shift assignments for backbone and side chain atoms were achieved with the exception of residues Cys41, Leu43, His42, Ser131, Met133, and Lys134. The YkuV structures were calculated using inter-proton NOE-derived distance restraints in combination with the dihedral angle and hydrogen bonding information. The superimposed representative structures (10 each), together with the ribbon diagrams of the mean structures, are shown in Fig. 2. The structural statistics for both the reduced and oxidized forms of YkuV is summarized in Table 1. For the reduced form, there are two distance restraint violations greater than 0.3 Å, and no dihedral angle restraint violations greater than 5°. From the PROCHECK_NMR analysis, 81.0% of residues are within the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot; 17.5% of residues are in the additionally allowed regions, and 0.8% of residues are in the disallowed regions. For residues 1-148, the overall backbone root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) from the mean structure is 0.45 ± 0.05 Å and that of the regular secondary structural elements is 0.35 ± 0.05 Å.TABLE 1Structural statistics of the reduced and oxidized B. subtilis YkuVReducedOxidizedDistance restraintsIntra-residue unambiguous NOEs15951445Sequential unambiguous NOEs882726Medium range unambiguous NOEs606425Long range unambiguous NOEs16131272Total unambiguous NOEs39523233Total ambiguous NOEs1160993Dihedral angles (φ and ψ)178160Hydrogen bonds5149S-S bond01r.m.s.d. from mean structureSecondary structure backbone atoms0.35 ± 0.050.40 ± 0.06Secondary structure heavy atoms0.86 ± 0.140.83 ± 0.05All backbone atoms0.45 ± 0.050.54 ± 0.09All heavy atoms0.92 ± 0.090.87 ± 0.08Energy (kcal/mol)Mean Amber energy−7802.06 ± 6.72−7789.10 ± 9.36NOE distance restraints violation energy37.11 ± 1.5237.92 ± 3.52Torsion angle restraints violation energy1.36 ± 0.223.86 ± 1.73Restraints violationsDistance (>0.3 Å)27Dihedral angle (>5°)04Hydrogen bonds00Ramachandran statisticsResidues in most favored regions (%)81.0%78.9%Residues in additional allowed regions (%)17.5%17.9%Residues in generously allowed regions (%)0.7%2.8%Residues in disallowed regions (%)0.8%0.4% Open table in a new tab For the oxidized form of YkuV, there are seven distance restraint violations greater than 0.3 Å and four angle restraint violations greater than 5°.

https://openalex.org/W2074812352,"How glycosylation affects the reactivity of proteins to trypsin is not well understood. Bovine and porcine pancreatic trypsins were discovered to bind to α-Man, Neu5Acα2,6Galβ1,4Glc, and α-galactose sequences by binding studies with biotinylated sugar-polymers. Quantitative kinetic studies supported that phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)-treated trypsin binds to glycolipid analogues possessing α-Man or α-NeuAc but not to those possessing β-galactose or β-GlcNAc residue. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that trypsin binds to six kinds of biotinylated glycoproteins possessing high mannose-type and complex-type N-glycans but not to bovine submaxillary mucin, which possesses only O-glycans. Further, the binding of trypsin to glycoproteins was differentially changed by treatments with sequential exoglycosidases, endoglycosidase H, or N-glycosidase F. Quantitative kinetic studies indicated that PMSF-treated trypsin binds with bovine thyroglobulin with the affinity constant of 1010 m–1, which was the highest among the glycoproteins examined, and that α-galactosidase treatment decreased it to 105 m–1. PMSF-treated trypsin bound to other glycoproteins, including ovomucoid, a trypsin inhibitor, with the affinity constants of 108-105 mol–1 and were markedly changed by glycosidase treatments in manners consistent with the sugar-binding specificities suggested by ELISA. Thus, the binding site for glycans was shown to be distinct from the catalytic site, allowing trypsin to function as an uncompetitive activator in the hydrolysis of a synthetic peptide substrate. Correspondingly the carbohydrate-binding activities of trypsin were unaffected by treatment with PMSF or soybean trypsin inhibitor. The results indicate the presence of an allosteric regulatory site on trypsin that sugar-specifically interacts with glycoproteins in addition to the proteolytic catalytic site.

The results indicate the presence of an allosteric regulatory site on trypsin that sugar-specifically interacts with glycoproteins in addition to the proteolytic catalytic site. Numerous biological phenomena are mediated by recognition of specific oligosaccharide signals. This recognition implies quality control in polypeptide folding, cellular interactions, and protein targeting (1Marth J.D. Varki A. Esko J.R.C. Freeze H. Hart G. Marth J.D. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Woodbury, NY1999: 85-100Google Scholar, 2Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar, 3Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4951) Google Scholar). In contrast, some functions of protein glycosylation seem to be widely applicable to various types of glycosylation, for example, protecting against proteolysis, stabilizing active conformations, and affording solubility to proteins (3Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4951) Google Scholar). These functions have been attributed to ambiguous steric effects of glycosylation in the absence of clear structural specificity, but the involvement of glycan recognition in achieving these functions has not yet been elucidated. Clarification of the molecular mechanism by which glycosylation plays a role in protecting or stabilizing the active conformation of proteins would enable the use of glycosylation in molecular engineering of recombinant products for therapeutic purposes. Trypsin is a principal pancreatic serine protease that plays a key role in digestion in the duodenum by activating zymogens and degrading dietary proteins. Trypsin acts specifically on peptide bonds of the carboxyl side of positively charged lysine and arginine and catalyzes the activation of many pancreatic proenzymes, such as trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, proelastase, and carboxypeptidase, and protease-activated receptors to control digestive efficiency in the intestines (4Chen J.M. Ferec C. Pancreas. 2000; 21: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 5Phillips M.A. Fletterick R.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 713-720Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). When, however, trypsin is activated in the pancreas, the activated proteinases induce the destruction of pancreatic cells. The modulation of trypsin activity is therefore important for controlling digestive efficiency and preventing pancreatitis.

Previously we reported that PPA exhibits carbohydrate-binding activity toward N-glycans of glycoproteins (6Matsushita H. Takenaka M. Ogawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4680-4686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the biological functions of the carbohydrate-binding activity found in PPA, we investigated whether other pancreatic digestive enzymes possess similar carbohydrate-binding activity. In this study, we found that trypsin exhibits remarkable carbohydrate-binding activities to the sequences present in the N-glycans of glycoproteins with a specificity distinct from PPA. This finding provides new insights into the interaction between the proteases and glycoproteins related to protease resistance and the biological functions of carbohydrate-specific interactions in the digestive organs.

Lactose was purchased from Kanto Kagaku, Tokyo, Japan. SDS-PAGE molecular weight standards were purchased from Bio-Rad. Preparation of Glycoprotein Probes—All biotinylated glycoprotein probes, their deglycosylated derivatives, and biotinyl lectins were prepared in our laboratory. Biotinylation was performed using EZ-link™ sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin according to the instruction manual. Briefly, 2 mg of each glycoprotein was dissolved in 1 ml of 50 mm sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5), and 74 μl of sulfo-NHS-biotin (1 mg/ml) was added. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the reactant was dialyzed against water to remove excess biotin. Asialoglycoproteins, asialoagalactoglycoproteins, and asialoagalactoahexosaminoglycoproteins were prepared from biotinylated glycoproteins by sequential glycosidase treatments with neuraminidase (0.1 units/mg glycoprotein) in 20 mm acetate-buffered saline (pH 5.5), β-galactosidase (0.14 units/mg glycoprotein) in 50 mm sodium-citrate buffer (pH 3.5) overnight, and then β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (1.43 units/mg of glycoprotein) in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.0) at 37 °C overnight. The glycan structures and carbohydrate concentrations of the glycoproteins used in this study are summarized in Scheme 1. Besides the sequential treatments described above, biotinylated bovine thyroglobulin was treated with α-galactosidase (0.14 unit/mg of glycoprotein) in 20 mm acetate-buffered saline (pH 5.5) for agalactosylation of the major oligosaccharide, Galα1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc. Fetuin was treated with N-glycosidase F (600 units/mg of glycoprotein) in 10 mm Tris-buffered saline (TBS) at pH 7, or de-O-glycosylated with a mixture of neuraminidase (0.1 unit/mg of glycoprotein) and O-glycosidase (2 milliunits/mg of glycoprotein) in 10 mm acetate buffer of pH 6 at 37 °C overnight. Biotinylated porcine thyroglobulin (20 μg) was denatured in glycoprotein denaturing buffer (5% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol) at 100 °C for 10 min, a 10% volume of 0.5 m sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.5) was added, and then it was incubated with 1500 units of endoglycosidase H at 37 °C overnight. Deglycosylation of all biotinylated glycoprotein probes was checked by ELISA for a change in reactivity with Ricinus communis agglutinin I for agalactosylation, Psathyrella velutina lectin for desialylation and ahexosaminylation, Galanthus nivalis lectin for endoglycosidase H treatment, and peanut lectin for de-O-glycosylation to recognize each carbohydrate structure, and by mobility on SDS-PAGE to demonstrate the decrease in molecular weight (data not shown). SDS-PAGE—To check the purity of trypsin, SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (8Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) using a 14% gel in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. The bovine and porcine trypsins (10, 20, or 40 μg of protein per lane) were loaded onto the gel together with a set of markers and run at 20 mA for 1.5 h. After electrophoresis, protein bands were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Binding Studies with Sugar-BP Probes or Biotinylated Glycoprotein Probes—PPT and BPT were preincubated in the presence or absence of 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm soybean trypsin inhibitor, or 5 mm EDTA in 10 mm TBS (pH 7.5) for 1 h and then immobilized at concentrations of 0.01–0.5μg/100 μl in wells of a microtiter plate (Immulon 1, Dynatech Laboratories) at 4 °C overnight. All other procedures were performed at room temperature using 10 mm TBS (pH 7.5) as the dilution buffer. After immobilization, the wells were blocked with 3% BSA for 2 h. Aliquots (100 μl) of various sugar-BP probes (shown in Scheme 1A) or biotinylated glycoprotein probes at concentrations of 10μg/ml were added to each well, followed by incubation for 1 h. After incubation, the wells were washed three times, and 100 μl of ABC complex (1 μg/ml) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h. After washing three times, color was developed by adding 200 μl of o-phenylenediamine/H2O2, and then 50 μl of 2.5 m H2SO4 was added to stop the reaction. Absorbance was measured with a microplate reader (Bio-Rad MPR-80) at 490 nm. Quantification of Interactions between Trypsins and Glycolipid Analogues by Surface Plasmon Resonance—For binding studies between trypsins and glycolipid analogues or various glycoproteins, a BIAcore 2000 SPR apparatus (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used. Structure of glycolipid analogues used in this study was illustrated in Scheme 2B, and their synthesis will be described elsewhere. Glycolipid analogues were immobilized on a HPA sensor chip (BIAcore AB) by preparing liposomes containing each glycolipid analogue/phosphatidylcholine at a molar ratio of 40/60 as described previously (9Azefu Y. Tamiaki H. Sato R. Toma K. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2002; 10: 4013-4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 10Sato R. Toma K. Nomura K. Takagi M. Yoshida T. Azefu Y. Tamiaki H. J. Carbohyd. Chem. 2004; 23: 375-388Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). PMSF-treated PPT was injected onto the sensor chip at various concentrations in 10 mm TBS buffer (pH 7.5) at a flow rate of 20 μl/min at 25 °C using a BIAcore biosensor. The reference cell was prepared by immobilizing phosphatidylcholine and used to correct for bulk effect. The chip was regenerated each time by injection of 20 μl of 0.1 m phosphoric acid. Quantification of Interactions between Trypsins and Various Glycoproteins by SPR—After equilibration of a CM5 sensor chip (BIAcore AB) with HEPES-buffered saline, the surface of the sensor chip was activated with an amine coupling kit. BPT or PPT (each 1.8 μm) in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 6) containing 0.1 mm PMSF and 0.2 m methyl α-d-mannoside was injected onto the activated surface, and then the remaining N-hydroxysuccinimide esters were blocked with 1.0 m ethanolamine hydrochloride (pH 8). Each step was performed for 14 min at a constant flow rate of 10 μl/min at 25 °C. The reference flow cell was prepared with BSA as a ligand. To determine the pH dependence of the binding, fetuin, or porcine thyroglobulin were dissolved at 30 μg/ml in buffers of various pH, 10 mm acetate (pH 4.5, 5.5, and 6.5), 10 mm TBS (pH 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0), or 10 mm bicarbonate buffer (pH 9 and 10), and injected onto the trypsin-immobilized sensor chip. To measure binding curves, various glycoproteins in 10 mm TBS (pH 7.5) were separately injected onto the trypsin-immobilized sensor chip at concentrations of 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, and 0.0625 μm for 150 s at a flow rate of 20 μl/min at 25 °C. The chip was regenerated each time by injection of 20 μl of 10 mm HCl. To assay inhibition, a trypsin-immobilized sensor chip was equilibrated with TBS containing 50 mm or 0.2 m methyl-α-mannoside, methyl-α-galactoside, or lactose for 15 min, and then the glycoprotein dissolved in the same buffer was injected. Kinetic parameters were calculated mainly by global analysis, or affinity analysis when necessary, using the BIAevaluation software version 3.1. Measurement of Enzyme Activity of Trypsin—Enzyme activity was measured in a test tube according to the method previously described using BAEE (11Schwert G.W. Takenaka Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1955; 16: 570-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar) or BAPA (12Erlanger B.F. Kokowsky N. Cohen W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1961; 95: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (2867) Google Scholar) as the substrate. To estimate the effect of sugar on the BAEE-hydrolytic activity, it was measured after preincubation of PPT in 100 μl of 1 mm HCl (0.02 mg/ml) with 100 μl of 0.2 m methyl-α-d-mannoside, 0.2 m methyl-α-d-galactoside, or 0.2 m lactose in 20 mm TBS (pH 7.6) for 10 min at 25 °C. A control experiment was done by preincubating PPT without sugar. After preincubation, the PPT solution was added to 500μl of 0.025 mm BAEE in 10 mm TBS (pH 7.6) and incubated at 25 °C for 1 min. Absorbance was immediately measured at 253 nm, and trypsin activity that increased absorbance by 0.003 at 25 °C for 1 min was regarded as 1 USP unit of trypsin. To analyze the effect of sugar by a double reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plot, the initial rates of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction were measured using BAPA as the substrate. The substrate stock solution was prepared by dissolving 0.0217 g of BAPA in 1.5 ml of Me2SO and then diluted to final concentrations of 0.1–0.5 mm with 100 mm TBS (pH 7.5) in the presence or absence of 0.2 m methyl-α-mannoside, methyl-α-galactoside, or lactose. The substrate solutions were heated for 5 min at 37 °C. The enzyme stock solution was prepared by dissolving 2.5 mg of PPT in 3 ml of 1 mm HCl containing 13 mg of CaCl2-2H2O. A 10-μl aliquot of the enzyme solution was added to 3 ml of the substrate solution, and absorbance was measured at 410 nm every 30 s. The carbohydrate-binding activities of BPT and PPT were analyzed using synthetic sugar-BP probes (Scheme 2A), and specificities toward sugar residues and oligosaccharides were determined. As shown in Fig. 1, both BPT and PPT exhibited high binding activity towardα-Man-,α-Man-6-phosphate-, NeuAcα2,6Galβ1,4Glc-, α-Gal-, and β-Glc-BP probes among the 17 kinds of sugar-BP probes tested. Both trypsins bound to NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4Glc- and NeuAc-BP to a lesser extent than to NeuAcα2,6Galβ1,4Glc-BP, indicating a preference for sialyl linkages. On the contrary, trypsin did not bind withα-GalNAc- or mucin core 2-type BP probes or with β-Gal, LacNAc, Lac, β-GlcNAc, or β-Gal3-sulfate-BP probes. None of the carbohydrate-binding activities of the trypsins was affected by preincubation with PMSF and EDTA or soybean trypsin inhibitor, suggesting that binding is independent of the catalytic site. The bound sugar residues other than β-d-Glc are components of N-glycans, demonstrating basic specificities toward monosaccharides or short sequences that include linkages for trypsin binding. To verify the carbohydrate-binding specificity of trypsin by quantitative measurement, interaction analyses were performed by SPR using five kinds of synthetic high sensitivity glycolipid analogues (Scheme 2B). The total amounts of immobilized glycolipid analogues containing α-Man, α-NeuAc, and β-Lac were 1593, 1560, and 1680 BIAcore resonance units (RU, 1000 RU = 1 ng/mm2), respectively. As shown in Fig. 2(A–C), PPT concentration-dependently bound to immobilized glycolipid analogues. The differential binding of PPT to the analogues clearly indicates its relative binding affinity toward sugar residues: PPT binds best with the analogues containing α-Man, then α-NeuAc, and to a lesser extent β-Lac. The binding and dissociation occurred rapidly at the start and end of injection of the glycolipid analogues except the α-Man derivative, demonstrating the specific binding of PPT to those glycolipid analogues with quick association and dissociation rates. PPT did not bind to other analogues containing β-galactose or β-GlcNAc even at 2 μm. The association constants (KA) were calculated to be 106-105 (m–1) for glycolipid analogues containing α-Man and α-NeuAc (Fig. 2D), which are comparable to the KA obtained for the interaction between ricin and the glycolipid analogues containing β-galactose 3H.

Ogawa, unpublished results. and higher than that obtained between concanavalin A and α-Man-derivatized glycolipid containing phosphatidylethanolamine aglycon (13Mann D.A. Kanai M. Maly D.J. Kiessling L.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 10575-10582Crossref Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The carbohydrate-binding specificity indicated by SPR corresponded with that obtained by using sugar-BP probes (Fig. 1) demonstrating that the affinity of trypsin for specific carbohydrates is comparable to those of known plant lectins. Therefore, the binding activity of trypsin for glycoproteins was examined. The carbohydrate-binding activities shown in Figs. 1 and 2 have never been reported for trypsin. To eliminate the suspicion that some contaminant in the trypsin preparation might exhibit such an activity, we analyzed the purity of the trypsin preparations used in this study by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 3, both BPT and PPT showed only a single band without any detectable contamination even if 40 μg of trypsin preparation was applied per lane to the polyacrylamide gel. Therefore, the carbohydrate-binding activities observed in this study were attributed to the trypsins. Interactions between the glycoprotein probes and PPT or BPT were studied by ELISA at pH 7.5, which is the physiological pH in the duodenum. Because the amount of biotin incorporated into each glycoprotein probe was almost equal, as judged by the color intensity of each probe developed with the ABC complex being within a 10% error, the value of A490 corresponds to the amount of probe bound. As shown in Fig. 4(A and B), BPT and PPT were found to bind to various glycoproteins with very similar binding patterns. The trypsins bound best to bovine thyroglobulin and to a lesser extent to fetuin, porcine thyroglobulin, ovomucoid, orosomucoid, and transferrin, in that order, but not to BSM. All the bound glycoproteins contain 5–30% (w/w) N-linked oligosaccharides, whereas BSM possesses up to 60% (w/w) O-linked glycans, which are mainly sialyl-Tn and core 3-type (Scheme 1). Combined with the finding that trypsins did not bind with α-GalNAc- and β-GlcNAc (Fig. 1), this indicates that trypsins do not interact with O-linked glycans. The involvement of the N-glycan structure in the binding with PPT and BPT was shown by deglycosylating the glycoprotein probes with endo-type glycosidases. As shown in Fig. 5C, de-N-glycosylation of fetuin by N-glycosidase F treatment markedly decreased the reactivity toward both trypsins (data not shown for PPT), showing that their binding was mostly due to the affinity for the sialylated complex-type N-glycans of fetuin. The reactivity of trypsins for porcine thyroglobulin (Fig. 5B), which contains almost equal amounts of high Man-type and complex-type glycans (Scheme 1), was decreased to about half that of intact porcine thyroglobulin by endoglycosidase H treatment as well as asialoagalactoahexosaminylation, indicating that trypsins bind with high Man-type N-glycans as well as the sialylated complex-type. As shown in Fig. 5, the effects of exo-type glycosidase treatments of the glycoprotein probes illustrate the contribution of each sugar residue to the interaction with BPT. Remarkably, binding of BPT with bovine thyroglobulin was found to be diminished by α-galactosidase treatment (Fig. 5A), clearly indicating that theα-galactosyl residue at the nonreducing terminal, which is unique to the N-glycan of bovine thyroglobulin (Scheme 1), is an epitope for BPT binding. Other exoglycosidase treatments of bovine thyroglobulin did not affect the binding. On the other hand, neuraminidase treatment of other glycoproteins that possess sialylated complex-type N-glycans, such as fetuin, ovomucoid, orosomucoid, and porcine thyroglobulin, considerably decreased the binding, as shown in Fig. 5 (B–E). For these glycoprotein probes β-galactosidase treatment subsequent to desialylation did not significantly change the binding, but exposure of α-mannosyl residues of the trimannosyl core of N-glycans by β-hexosaminidase treatment subsequent to degalactosylation restored the binding to trypsin. These results strongly indicate that α-NeuAc and α-mannosyl residues of complex-type multiantennary N-glycans contribute to the binding of trypsins, but β-galactose and β-GlcNAc residues of the lactosamine sequence do not. The biantennary complex type of transferrin did not show significant affinity for trypsins (Fig. 5F). As a whole, the sugar-binding specificities of BPT and PPT indicated in Fig. 1 coincide with and account for the binding specificities toward the glycoprotein probes. Preincubation of PPT and BPT with PMSF and EDTA or soybean trypsin inhibitor before the binding studies did not affect the binding activities toward glycoproteins (data not shown). Moreover, the binding of trypsin to ovomucoid, a natural inhibitor that blocks the catalytic site of trypsin, was found to be significantly affected by glycan trimming (Fig. 5D). The observations indicate that the trypsin binding to glycoproteins is independent of their catalytic activity. The total amounts of immobilized PPT, BPT, and BSA were 4,012, 4,028, and 4,031 RU, respectively. The responses are expressed as the change of resonance units induced by the binding of analytes to each flow cell, which was corrected for bulk effect by subtracting the change on the BSA-immobilized reference cell. pH Dependence of Interaction between Trypsin and Glycoproteins—Fetuin or porcine thyroglobulin was injected onto a trypsin-immobilized chip at pH 4.5–10. As shown in Fig. 6, the amounts of the glycoproteins bound to immobilized PPT and BPT changed within 30% in the pH range examined, showing a maximum at around pH 7.5–8.0. The weakly alkaline pH coincides with the enteric pH indicating that the carbohydrate-binding activity of trypsin is optimal in the milieu of the intestine. Based on this observation, 10 mm TBS at pH 7.5 was thereafter used for the binding studies. Effect of Sugars on Binding of Trypsin to Glycoproteins—Fig. 7 shows the effect of monosaccharide trypsin binding to glycoproteins. Me-α-Man and Me-α-galactoside, which showed the highest binding to trypsin (Fig. 1) were used as inhibitors in comparison with Lac, which showed relatively lower binding in the binding study with BP-sugars. The binding of both trypsins to fetuin and porcine thyroglobulins was decreased by 30–44% in 50 mm Me-α-Man and 56–64% in 0.2 m Me-α-Man, and binding to bovine thyroglobulin was decreased by 44–50% and 66–70% in 50 mm and 0.2 m Me-α-Gal, respectively. The binding of trypsins was decreased by only 10–18% even at 0.2 m Lac, indicating the weak inhibitory activity of Lac compared with those of Me-α-Man and Me-α-galactoside coinciding with the relative affinity of sugars shown by BP-sugar binding studies. The results strongly support the hypothesis that trypsins bind glycoproteins by sugar-specific interaction. Kinetic Parameters for Binding between Trypsins and Glycoproteins—The sensorgrams are shown in Fig. 8 (A and B), and the binding parameters were calculated for each glycoprotein. The binding of all glycoproteins except BSM fit best a 1:1 binding model among the fitting models in global analysis. The interaction between bovine thyroglobulin and trypsins was analyzed at concentrations lower than 0.25 μm (Fig. 8, A (panel e) and B (panel o)), because bovine thyroglobulin gave fluctuating, irregular-shaped binding curves at concentrations higher than 0.5 μm. The interaction between trypsins and BSM showed box-shaped binding curves suggesting high association and dissociation rates (Fig. 8, A (panel j) and B (panel t)) and was analyzed using affinity analysis. The kinetic data of the binding are summarized in Table 1.FIGURE 8Quantification of interaction between trypsins and glycoproteins by SPR. PPT and BPT were immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip as described in the text. Glycoproteins were injected onto a trypsin-immobilized sensor chip in 10 mm TBS (pH 7.5) for 150 s at a flow rate of 20 ml/min at 25 °C. The response was expressed as the change of resonance units induced by the binding of fetuin to the trypsinimmobilized flow cell, which was corrected for bulk effect by subtracting the change on the BSA-immobilized reference cell. Binding curves of glycoproteins on the sensor chip were immobilized with PPT (A) and BPT (B).View Large Image"
