https://openalex.org/W4229035861,"Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have attenuated cross-population predictive performance. As existing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted predominantly in individuals of European descent, the limited transferability of PRS reduces their clinical value in non-European populations, and may exacerbate healthcare disparities. Recent efforts to level ancestry imbalance in genomic research have expanded the scale of non-European GWAS, although most remain underpowered. Here, we present a new PRS construction method, PRS-CSx, which improves cross-population polygenic prediction by integrating GWAS summary statistics from multiple populations. PRS-CSx couples genetic effects across populations via a shared continuous shrinkage (CS) prior, enabling more accurate effect size estimation by sharing information between summary statistics and leveraging linkage disequilibrium diversity across discovery samples, while inheriting computational efficiency and robustness from PRS-CS. We show that PRS-CSx outperforms alternative methods across traits with a wide range of genetic architectures, cross-population genetic overlaps and discovery GWAS sample sizes in simulations, and improves the prediction of quantitative traits and schizophrenia risk in non-European populations. PRS-CSx is a polygenic risk score construction method that improves cross-population polygenic prediction by integrating GWAS summary statistics from multiple populations."
https://openalex.org/W4229010457,"We interrogate the joint genetic architecture of 11 major psychiatric disorders at biobehavioral, functional genomic and molecular genetic levels of analysis. We identify four broad factors (neurodevelopmental, compulsive, psychotic and internalizing) that underlie genetic correlations among the disorders and test whether these factors adequately explain their genetic correlations with biobehavioral traits. We introduce stratified genomic structural equation modeling, which we use to identify gene sets that disproportionately contribute to genetic risk sharing. This includes protein-truncating variant-intolerant genes expressed in excitatory and GABAergic brain cells that are enriched for genetic overlap across disorders with psychotic features. Multivariate association analyses detect 152 (20 new) independent loci that act on the individual factors and identify nine loci that act heterogeneously across disorders within a factor. Despite moderate-to-high genetic correlations across all 11 disorders, we find little utility of a single dimension of genetic risk across psychiatric disorders either at the level of biobehavioral correlates or at the level of individual variants."
https://openalex.org/W4229029310,"Recent research points towards age- and gender-specific transmission of COVID-19 infections and their outcomes. The effect of gender, however, has been overlooked in past modelling approaches of COVID-19 infections. The aim of our study is to explore how gender-specific contact behavior affects gender-specific COVID-19 infections and deaths. We consider a compartment model to establish short-term forecasts of the COVID-19 epidemic over a time period of 75 days. Compartments are subdivided into different age groups and genders, and estimated contact patterns, based on previous studies, are incorporated to account for age- and gender-specific social behaviour. The model is fitted to real data and used for assessing the effect of hypothetical contact scenarios all starting at a daily level of 10 new infections per million population. On day 75 after the end of the lockdown, infection rates are highest among the young and working-age, but they also have increased among the old. Sex ratios reveal higher infection risks among women than men at working ages; the opposite holds true at old age. Death rates in all age groups are twice as high for men as for women. Small changes in contact rates at working and young ages have a considerable effect on infections and mortality at old age, with elderly men being always at higher risk of infection and mortality. Our results underline the high importance of the non-pharmaceutical mitigation measures (NPMM) in low-infection phases of the pandemic to prevent that an increase in contact rates leads to higher mortality among the elderly, even if easing measures take place among the young. At young and middle ages, women's contribution to increasing infections is higher due to their higher number of contacts. Gender differences in contact rates may be one pathway that contributes to the spread of the disease and results in gender-specific infection rates and their mortality outcome. To further explore possible pathways, more data on contact behavior and COVID-19 transmission is needed, which includes gender- and socio-demographic information."
https://openalex.org/W4229010849,"Most genes in photosynthetic organisms remain functionally uncharacterized. Here, using a barcoded mutant library of the model eukaryotic alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we determined the phenotypes of more than 58,000 mutants under more than 121 different environmental growth conditions and chemical treatments. A total of 59% of genes are represented by at least one mutant that showed a phenotype, providing clues to the functions of thousands of genes. Mutant phenotypic profiles place uncharacterized genes into functional pathways such as DNA repair, photosynthesis, the CO2-concentrating mechanism and ciliogenesis. We illustrate the value of this resource by validating phenotypes and gene functions, including three new components of an actin cytoskeleton defense pathway. The data also inform phenotype discovery in land plants; mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana genes exhibit phenotypes similar to those we observed in their Chlamydomonas homologs. We anticipate that this resource will guide the functional characterization of genes across the tree of life."
https://openalex.org/W4229055907,"Plant growth promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR) designated as ZNP-4, isolated from the rhizosphere of Ziziphus nummularia, was identified as Enterobacter cloacae following 16S rRNA sequence analysis. The isolated strain exhibited various plant growth promoting (PGP) traits. The 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase (ACCD) activity was evaluated under diverse physiological conditions that could be useful for minimizing the abiotic stress-induced inhibitory effects on wheat plants. The strain showed resistance to salt (NaCl) and metal (ZnSO4) stress. The effect of E. cloacae ZNP-4 on the augmentation of plant growth was studied under salinity stress of 150 mM (T1 treatment) & 200 mM (T2 treatment) NaCl. The inoculation of strain ZNP-4 significantly improved the various growth parameters of wheat plant such as shoot length (41%), root length (31%), fresh weight (28%), dry weight (29%), photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll a (62%) and chlorophyll b (34%). Additionally, the strain was found to be efficient for minimizing the imposed Zn stress in terms of improving plant growth, biomass and photosynthetic pigments in pots containing different levels of metal stress of 150 mg kg-1 (treatment T1) and 250 mg kg-1 (treatment T2). Isolate ZNP-4 also improved the proline content and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) level under both salinity and metal stress, therefore maintaining the membrane integrity. Furthermore, bacterial inoculation increased the activities of antioxidative enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POX). The positive effects of PGPR occurred concurrently with the decrease in abiotic stress-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) molecules such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide (O2-) contents. Overall, the observed results indicate that use of bacteria with such beneficial traits could be used as bio-fertilizers for many crops growing under stress conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4229029367,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) are two fibrotic interstitial lung diseases that share the usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) injury pattern. Here, we report that RNA sequencing of lung biopsies from patients with RA-ILD and IPF revealed shared and distinct disease-causing pathways. Analysis of transcriptomic data identified a JAK2 related JAK/STAT signaling pathway gene signature that distinguishes RA-UIP from idiopathic UIP. This was further confirmed by immunohistostaining, which identified JAK2 phosphorylation with two distinct forms of activation: a cytoplasmic form of JAK2 activation in most IPF cases (13/20) and a nuclear form of p-JAK2 in RA-UIP (5/5) and a minority of IPF (6/20) cases. Further immunohistostaining identified STAT5A&B as the downstream transcriptional activator for JAK2-mediated canonical signal transduction and phosphorylation of Tyr41 on histone H3 (H3Y41ph) as the downstream epigenetic regulation site for JAK2-mediated noncanonical signal transduction. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of the RNA-Seq data further supported this shared pathogenic mechanism for the two diseases with the enrichment of STAT5A&B target gene sets as well as the JAK2 regulated H3Y41ph target gene set. This regulatory role of JAK2 in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis was further demonstrated by the attenuation of bleomycin-induced murine pulmonary fibrosis using a JAK2-selective pharmacological inhibitor CEP33779. In vitro studies with normal and IPF derived lung fibroblasts revealed a central role for JAK2 as an essential intermediary molecule in TGF-Î²-mediated myofibroblast trans-differentiation, proliferation, and extracellular matrix protein production. These observations support a crucial role for JAK2 as an intermediary molecule in fibrotic lung disease development."
https://openalex.org/W4229005067,"Chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of natural killer cells (CLPD-NK) is characterized by clonal expansion of natural killer (NK) cells where the underlying genetic mechanisms are incompletely understood. In the present study, we report somatic mutations in the chemokine gene CCL22 as the hallmark of a distinct subset of CLPD-NK. CCL22 mutations were enriched at highly conserved residues, mutually exclusive of STAT3 mutations and associated with gene expression programs that resembled normal CD16dim/CD56bright NK cells. Mechanistically, the mutations resulted in ligand-biased chemokine receptor signaling, with decreased internalization of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) for CCL22, CCR4, via impaired Î²-arrestin recruitment. This resulted in increased cell chemotaxis in vitro, bidirectional crosstalk with the hematopoietic microenvironment and enhanced NK cell proliferation in vivo in transgenic human IL-15 mice. Somatic CCL22 mutations illustrate a unique mechanism of tumor formation in which gain-of-function chemokine mutations promote tumorigenesis by biased GPCR signaling and dysregulation of microenvironmental crosstalk. Genomic and transcriptomic analyses of chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of natural killer cells identifies somatic gain-of-function mutations in the chemokine gene CCL22 with cell-extrinsic effects. Mutations caused biased signaling downstream of the G-protein-coupled receptor for CCL22 and deregulated interactions with the hematopoietic microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W4229049818,"Sex differences in post-stroke cognitive decline have not been systematically evaluated in a nationally representative cohort. We use a quasi-experimental design to investigate sex differences in rate of post-stroke cognitive decline.Utilizing the event study design, we use the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data (1996-2016) to evaluate the differences (percentage points [95% Confidence interval]) in the rate of change in cognitive function, measured using the modified version of the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS-m) score, before and after incident stroke, and among patients with and without incident stroke. We estimated this event study model for the overall study population and separately fit the same model for male and female participants.Of 25,872 HRS participants included in our study, 14,459 (55.9%) were females with an overall mean age (SD) of 61.2 (9.3) years. Overall, 2,911 (11.3%) participants reported experiencing incident stroke. Participants with incident stroke (vs. no stroke) had lower baseline TICS-m score (15.6 vs. 16.1). Among participants with incident stroke, the mean pre-stroke TICS-m score was higher than the mean post-stroke TICS-m score (14.9 vs. 12.7). Event study revealed a significant short-term acceleration of cognitive decline for the overall population (4.2 [1.7-6.6] percentage points, p value = 0.001) and among female participants (5.0 [1.7-8.3] percentage points, p value = 0.003). We, however, found no evidence of long-term acceleration of cognitive decline after stroke. Moreover, among males, incident stroke was not associated with significant changes in rate of post-stroke cognitive decline.Females, in contrast to males, experience post-stroke cognitive deficits, particularly during early post-stroke period. Identifying the sex-specific stroke characteristics contributing to differences in post stroke cognitive decline may inform future strategies for reducing the burden of post-stroke cognitive impairment and dementia."
https://openalex.org/W4229008858,"The Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Of Longitudinal Evolution (TADPOLE) Challenge is the most comprehensive challenge to date with regard to the number of subjects, considered features, and challenge participants. The initial objective of TADPOLE was the identification of the most predictive data, features, and methods for the progression of subjects at risk of developing Alzheimer's. The challenge was successful in recognizing tree-based ensemble methods such as gradient boosting and random forest as the best methods for the prognosis of the clinical status in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the challenge outcome was limited to which combination of data processing and methods exhibits the best accuracy; hence, it is difficult to determine the contribution of the methods to the accuracy. The quantification of feature importance was globally approached by all the challenge participant methods. In addition, TADPOLE provided general answers that focused on improving performance while ignoring important issues such as interpretability. The purpose of this study is to intensively explore the models of the top three TADPOLE Challenge methods in a common framework for fair comparison. In addition, for these models, the most meaningful features for the prognosis of the clinical status of AD are studied and the contribution of each feature to the accuracy of the methods is quantified. We provide plausible explanations as to why the methods achieve such accuracy, and we investigate whether the methods use information coherent with clinical knowledge. Finally, we approach these issues through the analysis of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, a technique that has recently attracted increasing attention in the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)."
https://openalex.org/W4229003322,"To determine the climate conditions that affect the incidence of atopic dermatitis from infancy to 3 years old.We analyzed 100,303 children born from 2011 to 2014 for follow-up until 3 years old using cohort data from the Japan Environment and Children's Study. The study included 15 Regional Centers, including 19 prefectures across Japan. We used meteorological data of the Japan Meteorological Agency. We calculated the hazard ratio (HR) of the standard deviation and low vs. high mean values of several climate conditions in children in their first 6 months of life to determine the incidence of atopic dermatitis.The Kaplan-Meier curve showed that children born in the months of October to December had the highest incidence of atopic dermatitis. Among climate conditions, a one standard deviation increase in the temperature (HR = 0.87), minimum temperature (HR = 0.87), and vapor pressure (HR = 0.87) showed the lowest HRs for the incidence of atopic dermatitis. These results were confirmed by an analysis by strata of the birth season. A low vapor pressure (HR = 1.26, p<0.0001) and the combination of a low mean temperature or low mean minimum temperature and low vapor pressure (HR = 1.26, p<0.0001) were associated with the highest incidence of atopic dermatitis. These results were consistent when they were adjusted for a maternal and paternal history of allergy and the prefecture of birth.Among climate conditions, a low vapor pressure is the most strongly associated with a high incidence of atopic dermatitis. Measuring vapor pressure may be useful for preventing atopic dermatitis."

https://openalex.org/W4229015589,"Pregnancy and postpartum are periods in which women develop psychosocially. However, becoming a mother is stressful, and mood disorders related to anxiety and depression often develop. In recent years, research on interoception-sensations related to the body's internal physiological state-has attracted attention. Interoception has multifaceted characteristics. It involves directly perceiving information in the body while also inferring and evaluating it. In this study, we examined interoception, anxiety, and depression in Japanese pregnant women. Empirical examinations and questionnaire surveys were used to measure interoception in 32 pregnant women not at high risk of pregnancy. A Japanese adaption of the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness was used to measure interoceptive sensibility, and a heartbeat counting task performance was used to measure interoceptive accuracy. Anxiety and depression were measured using the Japanese versions of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, respectively. A correlation analysis was performed between interoception, anxiety and depression and between differences between sensibility and accuracy of interoception, anxiety and depression. We revealed that interoceptive sensibility and differences between sensibility and accuracy of interoception were associated with anxiety. Based on results of this pilot study, it is necessary to investigate using longitudinal studies whether interoception might be an effective predictor tool for early detection of anxiety during pregnancy and postpartum."
https://openalex.org/W4229034483,"The COVID-19 pandemic has magnified the multiple vulnerabilities of people living in urban informal settlements globally. To bring community voices from such settlements to the center of COVID-19 response strategies, we undertook a study in the urban informal settlements of Dharavi, Mumbai, from September 2020-April 2021. In this study, we have examined the awareness, attitudes, reported practices, and some broader experiences of the community in Dharavi with respect to COVID-19. We have used a mixed-methods approach, that included a cross-sectional survey of 468 people, and in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with 49 people living in this area. Data was collected via a mix of phone and face-to-face interviews. We have presented here the descriptive statistics from the survey and the key themes that emerged from our qualitative data. People reported high levels of knowledge about COVID-19, with television (90%), family and friends (56%), and social media (47%) being the main sources of information. The knowledge people had, however, was not free of misconceptions and fear; people were scared of being forcefully quarantined and dying alone during the early days of COVID-19. These fears had negative repercussions in the form of patient-related stigma and hesitancy in seeking healthcare. A year into the pandemic, however, people reported a shift in attitudes from âextreme fear to low fearâ (67% reported perceiving low/no COVID risk in October 2020), contributing to a general laxity in following COVID-appropriate behaviors. Currently, the community is immensely concerned about the revival of livelihoods, that have been adversely impacted due to the lockdown in 2020 as well as the continued âotheringâ of Dharavi for being a COVID hotspot. These findings suggest that urban informal settlements like Dharavi need community-level messaging that counters misinformation and denial of the outbreak; local reinforcement of COVID-appropriate behaviours; and long-term social protection measures."
https://openalex.org/W4229065893,"Background Neonatal near-miss (NNM) cases refer to situations in which babies are on the verge of dying between the ages of 0 and 28 days due to severe morbidity that occurs during pregnancy, delivery, or extra-uterine life, but survive either by luck or due to high-quality health care. Identifying NNM cases and addressing their determinants is crucial for devising comprehensive and relevant interventions to tackle neonatal morbidity and mortality. Hence, this study aimed at finding out the determinants of NNM in neonates admitted to public hospitals in Hadiya zone, southern Ethiopia. Methods A hospital-based unmatched case-control study was conducted in three selected hospitals in southern Ethiopia from May 1 to June 30, 2021. A total of 484 participants took part in the study (121 cases and 363 controls). Controls were chosen using systematic sampling approaches, whereas cases were recruited consecutively at the time of discharge. Cases were selected based on the Latin American Centre for Perinatology (CLAP) criteria of an NNM. A structured interviewer-administered questionnaire and a data extraction checklist were used for data collection. The Data were entered into Epi-Data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. A multivariable logistic regression analysis with a p-value of &lt;0.05 was used to determine the determinants of NNM. Results Ninety-seven (80.1%) and 56 (46.2%) near-miss cases encountered at least one pragmatic and management criteria, respectively. The most common pragmatic and management criteria were gestational age less than 33 weeks (44.6%) and intravenous antibiotic usage up to 7 days and before 28 days of life (27.3%), respectively. A short birth interval [AOR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.29, 3.57], lack of ANC [AOR = 3.37; 95%CI: 1.35, 6.39], Caesarean mode of delivery [AOR = 2.24; 95%CI: 1.20, 4.16], the occurrence of a third maternal delay [AOR = 3.47; 95% CI: 2.11, 5.75], and poor birth preparedness and complication readiness (BPCR) plan[AOR = 2.50; 95% CI: 1.49,4.13] were identified as a significant determinants of NNM. Conclusion and recommendation The provision of adequate ANC should be a priority for health care providers at service delivery points. To avoid serious neonatal problems, mothers who deliver by Cesarean section should receive more attention from their families and health care providers. Health care providers in the ANC unit should encourage pregnant women to implement the WHO-recommended elements of the BPCR plan. To achieve optimal birth spacing, healthcare providers should focus on the contraceptive provision. Unnecessary delays in health facilities during childbirth should be avoided at all costs."
https://openalex.org/W4229000184,"Studies on the association between trust and oxytocin, a neuropeptide of the central nervous system, have not reached a consensus, thereby challenging the possibility of a direct association between the two. However, previous studies have not examined how oxytocin is correlated with trust, based on its categorization into different factors in the field of social science. For instance, based on Yamagishiâs trust theory, trust can be categorized into two factors: general trust and caution. General trust refers to beliefs about the trustworthiness of others, whereas caution refers to the belief that caution is needed when dealing with high social uncertainty. In this study, to examine the relationship between these two factors and oxytocin, we analyzed data of 197 adults (men = 98, women = 99; mean age = 41.7 years; standard deviation for age = 10.4 years) and examined the relationships between these two factors of trust and endogenous salivary oxytocin levels. We found that oxytocin was positively correlated with caution rather than with general trust thereby suggesting that oxytocin plays a role in regulating caution rather than general trust among the components of trust. The present study demonstrated that salivary oxytocin level can act as a biomarker that partially predicts oneâs trust, especially as reflected by caution."
https://openalex.org/W4229005031,"Heart failure (HF) is a serious health condition, associated with high health care costs, and poor outcomes. Patient empowerment and self-care are a key component of successful HF management. The emergence of telehealth may enable providers to remotely monitor patients' statuses, support adherence to medical guidelines, improve patient wellbeing, and promote daily awareness of overall patients' health.To assess the feasibility of a voice activated technology for monitoring of HF patients, and its impact on HF clinical outcomes and health care utilization.We conducted a randomized clinical trial; ambulatory HF patients were randomized to voice activated technology or standard of care (SOC) for 90 days. The system developed for this study monitored patient symptoms using a daily survey and alerted healthcare providers of pre-determined reported symptoms of worsening HF. We used summary statistics and descriptive visualizations to study the alerts generated by the technology and to healthcare utilization outcomes.The average age of patients was 54 years, the majority were Black and 45% were women. Almost all participants had an annual income below $50,000. Baseline characteristics were not statistically significantly different between the two arms. The technical infrastructure was successfully set up and two thirds of the invited study participants interacted with the technology. Patients reported favorable perception and high comfort level with the use of voice activated technology. The responses from the participants varied widely and higher perceived symptom burden was not associated with hospitalization on qualitative assessment of the data visualization plot. Among patients randomized to the voice activated technology arm, there was one HF emergency department (ED) visit and 2 HF hospitalizations; there were no events in the SOC arm.This study demonstrates the feasibility of remote symptom monitoring of HF patients using voice activated technology. The varying HF severity and the wide range of patient responses to the technology indicate that personalized technological approaches are needed to capture the full benefit of the technology. The differences in health care utilization between the two arms call for further study into the impact of remote monitoring on health care utilization and patients' wellbeing."
https://openalex.org/W4229012547,"The thalamus is a crucial subcortical hub that impacts cortical activity. Tracing experiments in animals and post-mortem humans suggest rich morphological specificity of the thalamus. Very few studies reported rodent thalamic activations by functional MRI (fMRI) as compared to cortical activations for different sensory stimuli. Here, we show different portions of the rat thalamus in response to tactile (forepaw, whisker) and non-tactile (visual, olfactory) sensory stimuli with high field fMRI (11.7T) using a custom-build quadrature surface coil to capture high sensitivity signals from superficial and deep brain regions simultaneously. Results demonstrate reproducible thalamic activations during both tactile and non-tactile stimuli. Forepaw and whisker stimuli activated broader regions within the thalamus: ventral posterior lateral (VPL), ventral posterior medial (VPM), lateral posterior mediorostral (LPMR) and posterior medial (POm) thalamic nuclei. Visual stimuli activated dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (DLG) of the thalamus but also parts of the superior/inferior colliculus, whereas olfactory stimuli activated specifically the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MDT). BOLD activations in LGN and MDT were much stronger than in VPL, VPM, LPMR and POm. These fMRI-based thalamic activations suggest that forepaw and whisker (i.e., tactile) stimuli engage VPL, VPM, LPMR and POm whereas visual and olfactory (i.e., non-tactile) stimuli, respectively, recruit DLG and MDT exclusively."
https://openalex.org/W4229015917,"Background Limited evidence are available regarding the influence of diabetes on periodontitis in hemodialysis patients, although the association between diabetes and periodontal disease is well-known. Objective This study aimed to investigate the influence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and its control level on periodontal disease and the number of missing teeth in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Subjects and methods A single-center cross-sectional study was conducted on 246 Japanese patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis. Comprehensive medical and dental examinations were performed. The association between severity of periodontitis and T2D was examined by multiple ordered logistic regression analysis. A multiple linear regression model was fitted to assess the association of periodontal probing depth (PPD) â¥4 mm and the number of missing teeth with T2D (n = 125). A subgroup analysis involving only the patients with T2D was performed to investigate the factors associated with missing teeth among them. Results After adjusting for confounders, the classification of periodontitis severity was significantly advanced in patients with T2D (odds ratio: 1.64, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02â2.65, p = 0.04). The proportion of PPDâ¥4 mm sites and the number of missing teeth was significantly associated with T2D (coefficient: 4.1 and 5.7, 95% CI: 0.2â8.0 and 3.4â8.0, p = 0.04 and &lt;0.001, respectively). Subgroup analysis of T2D patients revealed that glycoalbumin levels (coefficient: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.03â0.80, p = 0.03), but not hemoglobin A1c levels (coefficient: 0.8, 95% CI: -1.0â2.7, p = 0.37), were significantly associated with the number of missing teeth. Conclusion T2D was significantly associated with periodontitis and the number of missing teeth in hemodialysis patients. Moreover, it is first documented that poor glycemic control, as determined by glycoalbumin levels, was significantly associated with the number of missing teeth in hemodialysis patients with T2D."
https://openalex.org/W4229028156,"Turbidite successions can behave either as aquitards or aquifers depending on their lithological and hydraulic features. In particular, post-depositional processes can increase rock permeability due to fracture development in the competent layers. Thus, at a local scale, turbidite systems warrant further detailed investigations, aimed at reconstructing reliable hydrogeological models. The objective of this work was to investigate from the hydrogeological perspective a turbiditic aquifer located in southern Italy, where several perennial and seasonal springs were detected. Considering the complex hydrodynamics of these systems at the catchment scale, to reach an optimal characterization, a multidisciplinary approach was adopted. The conceptual framework employed microbial communities as groundwater tracers, together with the physicochemical features and isotopic signature of springs and streams from water samples. Meanwhile, geophysical investigations coupled with the geological survey provided the contextualization of the hydrogeological data into the detailed geological reconstruction of the study area. This modus operandi allowed us to typify several differences among the samples, allowing identification of sources and paths of surface water and groundwater, along with diffuse groundwater outflow along streams. As a final result, a hydrogeological conceptual model was reconstructed, underlining how at a very local scale the lithologic, hydraulic, and geomorphological heterogeneity of the studied relief can lead to an improved hydrogeological conceptual model compared to that of other turbidite systems. These results open new questions about the hydrogeological behavior of turbiditic aquifers, which could be pivotal in future research. In fact, these systems could support relevant ecosystems and anthropic activities, especially where climate change will force the research of new (and probably less hydrogeologically efficient) water sources."
https://openalex.org/W4229041790,"High-risk fertility behavior is a major public health concern in low and middle-income countries including Ethiopia. Some studies show that the relationship between high-risk fertility behavior and child mortality has analyzed each fertility behavior individually. Yet, there are limited studies that have analyzed outcomes associated with the joint impact of high-risk fertility behaviors. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the individual and combined influence of high-risk fertility behavior on under-five mortalities in Ethiopia.Data from the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey were used analyzed. A total of 10,773 mothers who gave live births were included in the final analysis. Both descriptive and bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed using STATA V.14.Overall, 62.1%, 24.0%, and 2.3% of women experienced at least one, two, and three high-risk fertility behaviors, respectively. In the multivariable analysis, under-five mortality was significantly associated with a combination of two or more maternal high-risk fertility behaviors. The odds of under-five mortality among children of women who were engaged in a combination of two high-risk fertility behaviors (AOR = 2.17, 95%CI: 1.52-3.08) and three high-risk fertility behaviors (AOR = 3.69, 95%CI:1.80, 7.55) was higher compared to children of women who have not engaged any high-risk fertility behaviors.This study revealed that a single high-risk fertility behavior was not associated with under-five mortality, yet the presence of two or more maternal high-risk fertility behaviors was an important factor that increased the likelihood of under-five child death. Thus, special emphasis should be given to children of women who engage in a combination of high-risk fertility behaviors. Furthermore, more emphasis should be placed on increasing access to family planning services and raising awareness about high-risk reproductive behaviors among Ethiopian women."

Phagocytosis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by pathogen-associated molecular pattern receptors and opsonin receptors was assessed. Superoxide anion production was evaluated. The control group showed a higher phagocytic index to monocytes and neutrophils than to the CF or CF+CRS with NP groups [Kruskal-Wallis p = 0.0025] when phagocytosis were evaluated by pathogen-associated molecular pattern receptors (5 yeasts/cell). The phagocytic index of the CF+CRS without NP group was higher than in the CF+CRS with NP group (Kruskal-Wallis p = 0.0168). In the control group, the percentage of phagocytes involved in phagocytosis and superoxide anion production (74.0 Â± 9.6%) were higher in all CF groups (p &lt; 0,0001). The innate immune response, represented by phagocytic activity and superoxide anion production by monocytes and neutrophils was more impaired in patients with CF related or not related to CRS than in the control group. However, the phagocytic function of patients without NP showed less impairment."
https://openalex.org/W4229083679,"In Maldivesâ primary schools, physical education (PE) is mainly taught by generalist classroom teachers who often lack knowledge and confidence to teach PE. Also, PE programs in primary schools are affected by a perceived lack of infrastructure, resources and equipment. Children in primary schools are allocated one 35 minute period of PE per week. Researchers have previously investigated interventions implemented by specialist PE teachers to enhance the motivation of secondary school students in PE classes. However, limited research has been conducted with generalist teachersâ implementing PE intervention with primary school children. In this study we applied self-determination theory to investigate the effects of a professional learning program and an associated resource support package, that was then delivered by the Maldives generalist teachersâ delivering PE. The participants were 30 primary school teachers (control group, n = 15; intervention group, n = 15), and their 725 primary school students aged 9â12 years (mean age of 10.5 years). The teachers in the group undertook eight hours of professional learning that focused on strategies and behaviours to support student satisfaction for the three main elements of self-determination theory: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. A repeated measure ANCOVA was carried out for each of the dependent variables. Overall results when compared to pre-intervention measures, the students of teachers in the intervention group significantly increased their post-intervention perceptions for autonomy, competence, and relatedness; and, increased their psychological need satisfaction. Moreover, intervention-students in the post-intervention phase reported reduced need frustration for autonomy, competence, and relatedness; and, experienced higher levels of self-efficacy, enjoyment and engagement. We contend that these results accentuate the usefulness of professional learning programs for generalist teachers delivering PE to promote studentsâ psychological need satisfaction, whilst reducing thwarting behaviours to enhance studentsâ self-determined motivation toward PE classes. The intervention program significantly enhanced the studentsâ perceived need support, and autonomous motivation, it also reduced teachersâ need frustrating behaviours within PE classes. Facilitating teachers to provide more moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and psychological need support could reduce the rate of non-communicable diseases that are currently prevalent in the Maldives."
https://openalex.org/W4228999818,"Molecular cloning, gene manipulation, gene expression, protein function, and gene regulation all depend on the introduction of nucleic acids into target cells. Multiple methods have been developed to facilitate such delivery including instrument based microinjection and electroporation, biological methods such as transduction, and chemical methods such as calcium phosphate precipitation, cationic polymers, and lipid based transfection, also known as lipofection. Here we report attempts to lipofect sea urchin coelomocytes using DOTAP lipofection reagent packaged with a range of molecules including fluorochromes, in addition to expression constructs, amplicons, and RNA encoding GFP. DOTAP has low cytotoxicity for coelomocytes, however, lipofection of a variety of molecules fails to produce any signature of success based on results from fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. While these results are negative, it is important to report failed attempts so that others conducting similar research do not repeat these approaches. Failure may be the outcome of elevated ionic strength of the coelomocyte culture medium, uptake and degradation of lipoplexes in the endosomal-lysosomal system, failure of the nucleic acids to escape the endosomal vesicles and enter the cytoplasm, and difficulties in lipofecting primary cultures of phagocytic cells. We encourage others to build on this report by using our information to optimize lipofection with a range of other approaches to work towards establishing a successful method of transfecting adult cells from marine invertebrates."

Recent studies have established that gut microbiota and their metabolites play important roles in the development and progression of cardiovascular disease; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The present study aimed to investigate endothelium plaque lesion formation in ApoE-deficient rats fed a normal chow diet under germ-free (GF) and specific-pathogen-free (SPF) conditions at various time points. There was no difference in serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels between SPF-rats and GF-rats. Histological studies revealed that the GF-rats developed endothelium plaques in the aorta from 26 to 52 weeks, but this was not observed in SPF-rats. GF-rat coronary arteries had moderate-to-severe endothelium lesions during this time period, but SPF-rat coronary arteries had only mild lesion formation. Immunohistochemical staining showed higher accumulation of CD68-positive and arginase-negative foamy-like macrophages on the arterial walls of GF-rats, and expression of TNF-Î± and IL-6 in foam cells was only observed in GF-rats. In addition, microbial metabolites, including equol derivatives, enterolactone derivatives, indole-3-propionate, indole-3-acrylic acid, cholic acid, hippuric acid, and isoquinolone, were significantly higher in the SPF group than in the GF group. In conclusion, our results indicate that gut microbiota may attenuate atherosclerosis development."
https://openalex.org/W4229015468,"Background Although Nigeria has made some progress in malaria control, there are variations across States. We investigated the factors associated with utilisation of long-lasting insecticide-treated net (LLIN) and parasitaemia among under-five children in 13 States with high malaria burden. Method Data from the 2015 Nigeria Malaria Indicator Survey and 2018 Demographic and Health Survey were obtained and analysed. The 2015 and 2018 data were compared to identify States with increase or reduction in parasitaemia. Analysis was done for all the 13 study States; four States with increased parasitaemia and nine States with reduction. Random-effects logit models were fitted to identify independent predictors of LLIN utilisation and parasitaemia. Results LLIN was used by 53.4% of 2844 children, while parasitaemia prevalence was 26.4% in 2018. Grandchildren (AOR = 5.35, CI: 1.09â26.19) were more likely to use LLIN while other relatives (AOR = 0.33, CI: 0.11â0.94) were less likely compared to children of household-heads. LLIN use was more common in children whose mother opined that only weak children could die from malaria (AOR = 1.83, CI: 1.10â3.10). Children whose mothers obtained net from antenatal or immunisation clinics (AOR = 5.30, CI: 2.32â12.14) and campaigns (AOR = 1.77, CI: 1.03â3.04) were also more likely to use LLIN. In contrast, LLIN utilisation was less likely among children in female-headed households (AOR = 0.51, CI: 0.27â0.99) and those in poor-quality houses (AOR = 0.25, CI: 0.09â0.72). Children aged 24â59 months compared to 0â11 months (AOR = 1.78, CI: 1.28â2.48), those in whom fever was reported (AOR = 1.31, CI: 1.06â1.63) and children of uneducated women (AOR = 1.89, CI: 1.32â2.70) were more likely to have parasitaemia. The likelihood of parasitaemia was higher among children from poor households compared to the rich (AOR = 2.06, CI: 1.24â3.42). The odds of parasitaemia were 98% higher among rural children (AOR = 1.98, CI: 1.37â2.87). Conclusion The key drivers of LLIN utilisation were source of net and socioeconomic characteristics. The latter was also a key factor associated with parasitaemia. These should be targeted as part of integrated malaria elimination efforts."
https://openalex.org/W4229034523,"Objectives Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a hyperinflammatory condition that is known to be secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) in patients with rheumatic disease. The aim of study was to evaluate the clinical manifestations and outcomes in patients with MAS with rheumatic disease. Materials and methods We performed a retrospective study of 20 adult patients who were diagnosed with MAS from 2012 to 2020. MAS was classified according to the HLH-2004 criteria. Patientsâ information, including clinical features, laboratory findings, and treatment regimens, was collected, and the overall survival rate was estimated by the KaplanâMeier method. Results Twenty patients (18 women, 35.6 Â± 18.3 years) who met the HLH-2004 criteria also fulfilled the 2016 EULAR/ACR/PRINTO classification criteria for MAS, and HScore was higher than 169 (mean, 241.1). Fourteen patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and 6 patients with adult-onset Stillâs disease were included. All patients were treated initially with corticosteroids, and 16 patients required additional immunosuppressants. The overall survival at 3 and 6 months was 75.2% and 64.3%. In survivors, renal impairment was less common (7.7% versus 71.4%, p = 0.007), the levels of AST (364.0 versus 81.0 IU/L, p = 0.019) and LDH (1346.0 versus 343.0IU/L, p = 0.014), and platelet count (90.0 versus 43.0 Ã 10 9 /L, p = 0.02) were higher in compared to non-survivors. Nine patients had opportunistic infections, five of whom died during admission. Conclusion The mortality of patients with MAS associated with rheumatic disease remains high. Renal impairment, levels of AST and LDH, and platelet count might be associated with prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W4229036927,"This study aims to investigate how young Chinese consumers make purchase intentions towards Western brands under the influence of two conflicting values and CSR, which is insufficiently discussed in the current literature. Both value-attitude-behavior (VAB) and consumer cultural theories are adopted to construct the research framework. Data was collected from undergraduate students studying at a public university located in Guangzhou via WeChat and Tencent QQ. A total of 314 usable responses were analyzed by the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The empirical findings indicated that cosmopolitanism has a significantly positive effect on brand attitudes and purchase intentions; ethnocentrism has a significantly negative effect on purchase intentions, but no significant impact on brand attitudes; and corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives positively affect brand attitudes rather than purchase intentions. The results also revealed that brand attitudes mediate the relationship between cosmopolitanism/CSR and purchase intentions, but it does not have a mediating effect on the relationship between ethnocentrism and purchase intentions. These findings provide essential insights to the body of knowledge of international marketing in emerging markets and shed light on understanding how young Chinese consumers make purchase decisions towards Western brands. The results are useful for Western brands to effectively adjust their marketing strategies and advertising/promoting campaigns for business development purposes in the Chinese market."

Being most common upper limb fracture in all age groups, the DRF peaks in young men and in post-menopausal women with incidence ratio of 1:4. Leap motion control based rehabilitation of patients with DRF is limited. This research aims to assess the efficacy of leap motion control based rehabilitation in patients with DRF. Methods In an randomized parallel group trial, subjects (n = 40) with DRF will be recruited. The participants will be enrolled into either experimental or control group with 1:1 allocation ratio. Following the primary assessment and allocation, the participants in experimental group will receive both leap motion control and conventional therapy over a period of six weeks. Participants in conventional group would undergo only conventional therapy. The primary outcome measures will be Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire and Universal goniometer however the grip strength and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) will be used as secondary outcome measures. Purpose of the study The findings of this trial will examine the impact of leap motion control in DRF patients with conventional therapy on improving the functional activity, range of motion (ROM), grip strength and pain. Expected clinical implications To conclude, this research seeks to examine the rapid and long term effects of leap motion control in DRF patients. The study findings would help prospective patients with DRF, which may include a newly designed approach of rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W4229046019,"RNA stability control contributes to the proper expression of gene products. Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in eukaryotic cells possess a 5' cap structure and the 3' poly(A) tail which are important for mRNA stability and efficient translation. The Ccr4-Not complex is a major cytoplasmic deadenylase and functions in mRNA degradation. The CLB1-6 genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae encode B-type cyclins which are involved in the cell cycle progression together with the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28. The CLB genes consist of CLB1/2, CLB3/4, and CLB5/6 whose gene products accumulate at the G2-M, S-G2, and late G1 phase, respectively. These Clb protein levels are thought to be mainly regulated by the transcriptional control and the protein stability control. Here we investigated regulation of CLB1-6 expression by Ccr4. Our results show that all CLB1-6 mRNA levels were significantly increased in the ccr4Î mutant compared to those in wild-type cells. Clb1, Clb4, and Clb6 protein levels were slightly increased in the ccr4Î mutant, but the Clb2, Clb3, and Clb5 protein levels were similar to those in wild-type cells. Since both CLB6 mRNA and Clb6 protein levels were most significantly increased in the ccr4Î mutant, we further analyzed the cis-elements for the Ccr4-mediated regulation within CLB6 mRNA. We found that there were destabilizing sequences in both coding sequence and 3' untranslated region (3' UTR). The destabilizing sequences in the coding region were found to be both within and outside the sequences corresponding the cyclin domain. The CLB6 3' UTR was sufficient for mRNA destabilization and decrease of the reporter GFP gene and this destabilization involved Ccr4. Our results suggest that CLB6 expression is regulated by Ccr4 through the coding sequence and 3' UTR of CLB6 mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W4229077607,"Public efforts to battle COVID-19 have been portrayed as a trade-off between health and the economy in the U.S. public discourse. We investigate how the U.S. general public prioritizes the health and the income dimensions amid COVID-19 using an incentivized instrument with real monetary consequences. We also employ between-subject information treatments highlighting negative health and income consequences of the pandemic. Specifically, participants have to divide monetary contributions between two charitable organizations representing either the health or the income dimension. An overwhelming majority of participants supports both dimensions, with higher monetary contributions to the health dimension (56%) compared to income (44%), but the difference is not large. Only a small fraction of respondents contributes exclusively to the health (10%) or income (5%) dimensions. Increasing the salience of negative health outcomes of COVID-19 raises differential token allocations in favor of the health-oriented charity. This finding is important since the course of COVID-19 will be shaped by the policies governments implement and how the general public reacts to these policies."
https://openalex.org/W4229000435,"Introduction Academia uses scholarly metrics, such as the h-index, to make hiring, promotion, and funding decisions. These high-stakes decisions require that those using scholarly metrics be able to recognize, interpret, critically assess and effectively and ethically use them. This study aimed to characterize educational videos about the h-index to understand available resources and provide recommendations for future educational initiatives. Methods The authors analyzed videos on the h-index posted to YouTube. Videos were identified by searching YouTube and were screened by two authors. To code the videos the authors created a coding sheet, which assessed content and presentation style with a focus on the videosâ educational quality based on Cognitive Load Theory. Two authors coded each video independently with discrepancies resolved by group consensus. Results Thirty-one videos met inclusion criteria. Twenty-one videos (68%) were screencasts and seven used a âtalking headâ approach. Twenty-six videos defined the h-index (83%) and provided examples of how to calculate and find it. The importance of the h-index in high-stakes decisions was raised in 14 (45%) videos. Sixteen videos (52%) described caveats about using the h-index, with potential disadvantages to early researchers the most prevalent (n = 7; 23%). All videos incorporated various educational approaches with potential impact on viewer cognitive load. A minority of videos (n = 10; 32%) displayed professional production quality. Discussion The videos featured content with potential to enhance viewersâ metrics literacies such that many defined the h-index and described its calculation, providing viewers with skills to recognize and interpret the metric. However, less than half described the h-index as an author quality indicator, which has been contested, and caveats about h-index use were inconsistently presented, suggesting room for improvement. While most videos integrated practices to facilitate balancing viewersâ cognitive load, few (32%) were of professional production quality. Some videos missed opportunities to adopt particular practices that could benefit learning."
https://openalex.org/W4229029678,"The translocator protein (TSPO) has been implicated in mitochondrial transmembrane cholesterol transport, brain inflammation, and other mitochondrial functions. It is upregulated in glial cells during neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease. High affinity TSPO imaging radioligands are utilized to visualize neuroinflammation. However, this is hampered by the common A147T polymorphism which compromises ligand binding. Furthermore, this polymorphism has been linked to increased risk of neuropsychiatric disorders, and possibly reduces TSPO protein stability. Here, we used immunoprecipitation coupled to mass-spectrometry (IP-MS) to establish a mitochondrial protein binding profile of wild-type (WT) TSPO and the A147T polymorphism variant. Using mitochondria from human glial cells expressing either WT or A147T TSPO, we identified 30 WT TSPO binding partners, yet only 23 for A147T TSPO. Confirming that A147T polymorphism of the TSPO might confer loss of function, we found that one of the identified interactors of WT TSPO, 14-3-3 theta (YWHAQ), a protein involved in regulating mitochondrial membrane proteins, interacts much less with A147T TSPO. Our data presents a network of mitochondrial interactions of TSPO and its A147T polymorphism variant in human glial cells and indicate functional relevance of A147T in mitochondrial protein networks."
https://openalex.org/W4229034684,"Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a significant condition associated with pregnancy and is considered as prognostic for the development of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI). However, treating all ASB increases the use of antibiotics and leads to the development of multidrug resistance (MDR). Therefore, this study aimed to identify the distribution of UPEC associated virulence genes and antibiotic susceptibility among phylogroups of E. coli isolated from ASB in pregnancy. Moreover, the gene expression of selected virulence genes was also compared among two E. coli isolates (with different pathogenic potential) to determine its pathogenicity. One hundred and sixty E. coli isolates from midstream urine samples of pregnant women with ASB were subjected to PCR-based detection for its phylogroups and virulence genes. The antibiotic susceptibility of isolated strains was determined by the disc diffusion method. Expression of the virulence genes were determined through microarray analysis and quantitative Real-Time PCR. The prevalence of ASB in this study was 16.1%. Within ASB isolates, the occurrence of phylogroup B2 was the highest, and isolates from this group harboured most of the virulence genes studied. Overall, the most identified virulence genes among all phylogroups in descending order were fimH, chuA, kpsMTII, usp, fyuA, hlyA, iroN, cnf, papC, sfa, ompT, and sat. In this study, higher resistance to antibiotics was observed for ampicillin (77.5%), amoxicillin-clavulanate (54.4%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (46.9%) and amikacin (43.8%) compared to the other tested antibiotics and 51.9% of the tested isolates were MDR. Furthermore, hierarchical clustering and gene expression analysis demonstrated extreme polarization of pathogenic potential of E. coli causing ASB in pregnancy necessitating the need for bacterial isolate focused approach towards treatment of ASB."
https://openalex.org/W4229051689,"Fetuin-A (Fet-A) is a liver-secreted phosphorylated protein, known to impair insulin signaling, which has been shown to be associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and incident diabetes. Fet-A interacts with the insulin-stimulated insulin receptor (IR) and inhibits IR tyrosine kinase activity and glucose uptake. It has been shown that high glucose increases Fet-A expression through the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. However, factors that downregulate Fet-A expression and their potential mechanisms are unclear. We examined the effect of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) on high-glucose induced Fet-A expression in HepG2 cells, Hep3B cells and primary rat hepatocytes. High glucose increased Fet-A and phosphorylated (Ser312) fetuin-A (pFet-A) expression, which are known to impair insulin signaling. AICAR-induced AMPK activation significantly down-regulated high glucose-induced Fet-A expression and secretion of pFet-A while treatment with Compound C (AMPK inhibitor), SB202190 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) or p38 MAPK siRNA transfection prevented AICAR-induced downregulation of Fet-A expression. In addition, activation of p38 MAPK, by anisomycin, decreased the hepatic expression of Fet-A. Further, we our studies have shown that short-term effect of AICAR-treatment on Fet-A expression was mediated by proteosomal degradation, and long-term treatment of AICAR was associated with decrease in hepatic expression of C/EBP beta, an important transcription factor involved in the regulation of Fet-A. Taken together, our studies implicate a critical role for AMPK-p38 MAPK-C/EBPb-ubiquitin-proteosomal axis in the regulation of the expression of hepatic Fet-A."
https://openalex.org/W4229056276,"Adipose tissue plays a central role in energy substrate homeostasis and is a key regulator of lipid flow throughout these processes. As hypoxia affects lipid metabolism in adipose tissue, we aimed to investigate the effects of high-altitude chronic hypoxia on lipid metabolism in the adipose tissue of rats using a lipidomic analysis approach. Visceral adipose tissues from rats housed in a high-altitude hypoxia environment representing 4,300 m with 14.07% oxygen (hypoxia group) and from rats housed in a low-altitude normoxia environment representing 41 m with 20.95% oxygen (normoxia group) for 8 weeks were analyzed using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-Orbitrap mass spectrometry system. After 8 weeks, the body weight and visceral adipose tissue weight of the hypoxia group were significantly decreased compared to those of the normoxia group (p < 0.05). The area and diameter of visceral adipose cells in the hypoxia group were significantly smaller than those of visceral adipose cells in the normoxia group (p < 0.05). The results of lipidomic analysis showed a total of 21 lipid classes and 819 lipid species. The total lipid concentration of the hypoxia group was lower than that in the normoxia group (p < 0.05). Concentrations of diacylglycerols and triacylglycerols in the hypoxia group were significantly lower than those in the normoxia group (p < 0.05). Using univariate and multivariate analyses, we identified 74 lipids that were significantly altered between the normoxia and hypoxia groups. These results demonstrate that high-altitude chronic hypoxia changes the metabolism of visceral adipose glycerides, which may potentially modulate other metabolic processes."

We aimed to identify and assess lesser known bone age assessment alternatives that may be applied retrospectively and without the need for extra imaging.After review of 2857 articles, nine bone age methods were selected and applied retrospectively in pilot study (thirteen individuals), followed by evaluation of EOS images of 934 4-24-year-olds. Difficulty of assessment and time taken were recorded, and reliability calculated.Five methods proved promising after pilot study. Risser 'plus' could be applied with no difficulty in 89.5% of scans (836/934) followed by the Oxford hip method (78.6%, 734/934), cervical (79.0%, 738/934), calcaneus (70.8%, 669/934) and the knee (68.2%, 667/934). Calcaneus and cervical methods proved to be fastest at 17.7s (95% confidence interval, 16.0s to 19.38s & 26.5s (95% CI, 22.16s to 30.75s), respectively, with Oxford hip the slowest at 82.0 s (95% CI, 76.12 to 87.88s). Difficulties included: regions lying outside of the image-assessment was difficult or impossible in upper cervical vertebrae (46/934 images 4.9%) and calcaneus methods (144/934 images, 15.4%); position: lower step length was associated with difficult lateral knee assessment & head/hand position with cervical evaluation; and resolution: in the higher stages of the hip, calcaneal and knee methods.Hip, iliac crest and cervical regions can be assessed on the majority of EOS scans and may be useful for retrospective application. Calcaneus evaluation is a simple and rapidly applicable method that may be appropriate if consideration is given to include full imaging of the foot."

It is essential to understand the effects of light intensity on water quality and fish metabolism before large-scale aquaculture is implemented. In this study, two low-intensity light levels, 0 lx and 100 lx, were used to stress Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), with a natural light level (500 lx) used as control. The pH, dissolved oxygen and ammonia contents were significantly lower in the water used in the 0 lx and 100 lx groups than in controls, while the levels of nitrite and total phosphorus were apparently higher. Moreover, the numbers of heterotrophic bacteria, Vibrio and total coliforms in aquaculture water were 157.1%, 314.2% and 502.4% higher, respectively, after 0 lx light stress for 15 days. The survival rate of Nile tilapia decreased significantly to 90.6% under 0 lx light on the 15th day. Of the immune-related genes, the expressions of IFN-Î³, IL-12 and IL-4 were 390.3%, 757.8% and 387.5% higher under 0 lx light and 303.3%, 471.2% and 289.7% higher under 100 lx light, respectively. These results indicate that low-intensity light changes the physicochemical parameters of aquaculture water and increases the number of bacteria it hosts while decreasing the survival rate and increasing the disease resistance of Nile tilapia."

We assessed the results of T790M mutation testing in liquid biopsy by Entrogen test and real-time PCR technique in routine clinical practice. Analysis was conducted in 73 plasma samples from 41 patients with locally advanced or metastatic lung adenocarcinoma treated with first- or second-generation of EGFR TKIs. We detected T790M mutation in 18 patients (43.9% of patients, 24.6% positive tests in 73 samples). The incidence of T790M mutation in liquid biopsy was significantly higher in patients with T3-T4 tumors compared to patients with T0-T2 tumors (p = 0.0368, Ï2 = 4.36). Median PFS at the time of progression according to RECIST was significantly (p = 0.0444) higher in patients with T790M mutation than in patients without this mutation (22.5 vs. 15 months). Our results confirmed that T790M mutation is more often detected in patients with a large tumor spreading in the chest and with the long duration of response to first- or second generation of EGFR TKIs. The low sensitivity of the real-time PCR technique in T790M mutation detection could be partially compensated by repeating the tests."
https://openalex.org/W4228997000,"Humanitarian actors involved in physical rehabilitation, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), usually provide their beneficiaries with lower-limb prostheses comprising Solid Ankle Cushion Heel (SACH) feet as these are considered appropriate (price, durability, low profile to fit a majority of patients, appearance) and reliable for all ambulation levels. However, individuals in low-resource settings having higher ambulation abilities would greatly benefit from dynamic prosthetic feet with improved biomechanics and energy storage and release. Some attempts tried to address this increasing need (e.g. Niagara Foot) but most products proposed by large manufacturers often remain unaffordable and unsuitable to the context of low-resource settings. The design requirements and a price target were defined in partnership with the ICRC according to their initial assessment and used as a starting point for the development process and related technological choices. Numerical simulation and modeling were used to work on the design and to determine the required materials properties (mechanical, chemical, wear), and a cost modeling tool was used to select suitable materials and relevant processing routes (price vs. performance). A prosthetic foot comprising an internal keel made of composite materials, a filling foam, and a cosmetic shell with a foot shape was developed. Manufacturing processes meeting the cost criteria were identified and prototype feet were produced accordingly. These were successfully tested using a compression testing system before gait analyses were performed in the laboratory with non-amputees wearing testing boots. After validation in laboratory conditions, the prototype foot was tested in the field (Vietnam) with 11 trans-tibial unilateral amputees, who showed an increased mobility compared with the SACH foot. The collaboration of different research fields led to the development of a prosthetic foot which met the technical requirements determined by the ICRCâs specific needs in its field of operation. The materials and selected production processes led to a manufacturing cost of less than 100 USD per part."
https://openalex.org/W4229005150,"COVID-19 remains a challenge worldwide, and testing of asymptomatic individuals remains critical to pandemic control measures. Starting March 2020, a total of 7497 hospital employees were tested at least weekly for SARS CoV-2; the cumulative incidence of asymptomatic infections was 5.64%. Consistently over a 14-month period half of COVID-19 infections (414 of 820, total) were detected through the asymptomatic screening program, a third of whom never developed any symptoms during follow-up. Prompt detection and isolation of these cases substantially reduced the risk of potential workplace and outside of workplace transmission. COVID-19 vaccinations of the workforce were initiated in December 2020. Twenty-one individuals tested positive after being fully vaccinated (3.9 per 1000 vaccinated). Most (61.9%) remained asymptomatic and in majority (75%) the virus could not be sequenced due to low template RNA levels in swab samples. Further routine testing of vaccinated asymptomatic employees was stopped and will be redeployed if needed; routine testing for those not vaccinated continues. Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 testing, as a part of enhanced screening, monitors local dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and can provide valuable data to assess the ongoing impact of COVID-19 vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 variants, inform risk mitigation, and guide adaptive, operational planning including titration of screening strategies over time, based on infection risk modifiers such as vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W4229008275,"Assessing levels of aggressionâspecifically reactive violenceâhas been a challenge in the past, since individuals might be reluctant to self-report aggressive tendencies. Furthermore, experimental studies often lack ecological validity. Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) offers a reliable, ethically safe environment, and is the most realistic virtual simulation method currently available. It allows researchers to test participantsâ aggressive responses to realistic provocations from virtual humans. In the current study, 116 participants completed our IVR aggression task, in which they encountered avatars who would either approach them in a friendly or provocative fashion. Participants had the option either to shake hands or hit the virtual human, in congruent and incongruent trials. In congruent trials, the response required of the participant matched the approach with the avatar (e.g., hitting the avatar after provocation). In incongruent trials there was a mismatch between the avatars approach and the participants required response. Congruent trials were designed to measure the immediate reaction towards the virtual human, and incongruent trials to assess response inhibition. Additionally, participants also completed traditional questionnaire-based measures of aggression, as well as reporting their past violent behaviour. We found that the immediate aggressive responses in the IVR task correlated with the established questionnaire measures (convergent validity), and we found that the IVR task was a stronger predictor of past violent behaviour than traditional measures (discriminant validity). This suggests that IVR might be an effective way to assess aggressive behaviour in a more indirect, but realistic manner, than current questionnaire assessment."
https://openalex.org/W4229014166,"Monocytes are a core component of the immune system that arise from bone marrow and differentiate into cells responsible for phagocytosis and antigen presentation. Their derivatives are often responsible for the initiation of the adaptive immune response. Monocytes and macrophages are central in both controlling and propagating infectious diseases such as infection by Coxiella burnetii and small ruminant lentivirus in sheep. Genotypes from 513 Rambouillet, Polypay, and Columbia sheep ( Ovis aries ) were generated using the Ovine SNP50 BeadChip. Of these sheep, 222 animals were subsequently genotyped with the Ovine Infinium Â® HD SNP BeadChip to increase SNP coverage. Data from the 222 HD genotyped sheep were combined with the data from an additional 258 unique sheep to form a 480-sheep reference panel; this panel was used to impute the low-density genotypes to the HD genotyping density. Then, a genome-wide association analysis was conducted to identify loci associated with absolute monocyte counts from blood. The analysis used a single-locus mixed linear model implementing EMMAX with age and ten principal components as fixed effects. Two genome-wide significant peaks (p &lt; 5x10 -7 ) were identified on chromosomes 9 and 1, and ten genome-wide suggestive peaks (p &lt; 1x10 -5 ) were identified on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 15, and 16. The identified loci were within or near genes including KCNK9 , involved into cytokine production, LY6D , a member of a superfamily of genes, some of which subset monocyte lineages, and HMGN1 , which encodes a chromatin regulator associated with myeloid cell differentiation. Further investigation of these loci is being conducted to understand their contributions to monocyte counts. Investigating the genetic basis of monocyte lineages and numbers may in turn provide information about pathogens of veterinary importance and elucidate fundamental immunology."
https://openalex.org/W4229022320,"Although neurotechnology careers are on the rise, and neuroscience curriculums have significantly grown at the undergraduate and graduate levels, increasing neuroscience and neurotechnology exposure in high school curricula has been an ongoing challenge. This is due, in part, to difficulties in converting cutting-edge neuroscience research into hands-on activities that are accessible for high school students and affordable for high school educators. Here, we describe and characterize a low-cost, easy-to-construct device to enable students to record rapid Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) behaviors during optogenetics experiments. The device is generated from inexpensive Arduino kits and utilizes a smartphone for video capture, making it easy to adopt in a standard biology laboratory. We validate this device is capable of replicating optogenetics experiments performed with more sophisticated setups at leading universities and institutes. We incorporate the device into a high school neuroengineering summer workshop. We find student participation in the workshop significantly enhances their understanding of key neuroscience and neurotechnology concepts, demonstrating how this device can be utilized in high school settings and undergraduate research laboratories seeking low-cost alternatives."
https://openalex.org/W4229023800,"Yawning is a long neglected behavioral pattern, but it has recently gained an increasing interdisciplinary attention for its theoretical implications as well as for its potential use as a clinical marker, with particular regard to perinatal neurobehavioral assessment. The present study investigated the factors affecting yawning frequencies in hospitalized preterm neonates (N = 58), in order to distinguish the effects of hunger and sleep-related modulations and to examine the possible impact of demographic and clinical variables on yawning frequencies. Results showed that preterm neonates yawned more often before than after feeding, and this modulation was not explained by the amount of time spent in quiet sleep in the two conditions. Moreover, second born twins, known to be more prone to neonatal mortality and morbidity, showed increased yawning rates compared to first born twins. Overall, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that yawning frequencies in preterm neonates are modulated by separate mechanisms, related e.g. to hunger, vigilance and stress. These findings, although preliminary and based only on behavioral data, might indicate that several distinct neuropharmacological pathways that have been found to be involved in yawn modulation in adults are already observable in preterm neonates."
https://openalex.org/W4229026768,"Using the Road Situation Video Test Paradigm and Eye-Tracking Analysis Method, according to the two-stage processing model of hazard perception (HP), this study divides HP into two stages: perception and behaviour response, and compares the different roles of sensation seeking level in two different processing stages of perception and behaviour response when adolescents are crossing the road. The results show that: (1) In the perception stage , adolescents with high sensation seeking, especially boys with high sensation seeking perceive danger faster than boys with low sensation seeking and girls, they are more aware of danger. Particularly, boys with high sensation seeking show a stronger advantage of attention processing to hazard in the early stage of perception processing from 8 th and 9 th grades. (2) In the behaviour response stage , adolescents with high sensation seeking, especially the boys are less sensitive, have stricter judgment criteria, and are more likely to make dangerous decisions when crossing the road. Girls with different sensation seeking levels are more sensitive and more cautious when crossing the road, make the probability of judging dangerous situation is higher, so they choose a more conservative way, and may be less likely to across the road."
https://openalex.org/W4229058418,"DNA methylation is closely related to senescence, so it has been used to develop statistical models, called clock models, to predict chronological ages accurately. However, because the training data always have a biased age distribution, the model performance becomes weak for the samples with a small age distribution density. To solve this problem, we developed the R package eClock , which uses a bagging-SMOTE method to adjust the biased distribution and predict age with an ensemble model. Moreover, it also provides a bootstrapped model based on bagging only and a traditional clock model. The performance on three datasets showed that the bagging-SMOTE model significantly improved rare sample age prediction. In addition to model construction, the package also provides other functions such as data visualization and methylation feature conversion to facilitate the research in relevant areas."
https://openalex.org/W4229063061,"Background Many schools have been cutting physical education (PE) classes due to budget constraints, which raises the question of whether policymakers should require schools to offer PE classes. Evidence suggests that PE classes can help address rising physical inactivity and obesity prevalence. However, it would be helpful to determine if requiring PE is cost-effective. Methods We developed an agent-based model of youth in Mexico City and the impact of all schools offering PE classes on changes in weight, weight-associated health conditions and the corresponding direct and indirect costs over their lifetime. Results If schools offer PE without meeting guidelines and instead followed currently observed class length and time active during class, overweight and obesity prevalence decreased by 1.3% (95% CI: 1.0%-1.6%) and was cost-effective from the third-party payer and societal perspectives ($5,058 per disability-adjusted life year [DALY] averted and $5,786/DALY averted, respectively, assuming PE cost $50.3 million). When all schools offered PE classes meeting international guidelines for PE classes, overweight and obesity prevalence decreased by 3.9% (95% CI: 3.7%-4.3%) in the cohort at the end of five years compared to no PE. Long-term, this averted 3,183 and 1,081 obesity-related health conditions and deaths, respectively and averted â¥$31.5 million in direct medical costs and â¥$39.7 million in societal costs, assuming PE classes cost â¤$50.3 million over the five-year period. PE classes could cost up to $185.5 million and $89.9 million over the course of five years and still remain cost-effective and cost saving respectively, from the societal perspective. Conclusion Requiring PE in all schools could be cost-effective when PE class costs, on average, up to $10,340 per school annually. Further, the amount of time students are active during class is a driver of PE classesâ value (e.g., it is cost saving when PE classes meet international guidelines) suggesting the need for specific recommendations."
https://openalex.org/W4229076429,"Dengue is caused by an arbovirus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family and there are four distinct, but close related, circulating serotypes. Dengue disease is of great importance for global public health, with vaccination being its main prophylactic measure. However, there is a paucity of biological models for evaluating tetravalent dengue vaccines. The aim of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of human cell lines HEK293T and THP-1 to a commercial dengue vaccine and test the feasibility of this approach in the development of a potency assay with human cell lines, as a methodological alternative to the golden standard potency assay with VERO cells. In this context, we used a batch of the commercial vaccine DengvaxiaÂ® (CYD-TDV) for the infection tests. We evaluated the presence of the vaccine virus in THP-1 cells, differentiated into macrophages (dTHP-1), and in HEK293T by confocal microscopy, using 4G2 pan-flavivirus antibody. Vaccine infectivity and potency were determined by immunocolorimetric assay using monoclonal antibodies specific for each serotype. The results indicated that the human strain HEK293T was responsive to the tetravalent vaccine, as shown by the presence of virus particles in the cell cytoplasm in a pattern similar to the one observed with VERO cells. Moreover, it was possible to determine the infectivity and potency values of each vaccine virus serotype in the HEK293T, with serotype 4 prevailing over the others. Thus, the human cell line HEK293T provides a potential candidate to be used in assays to determine potency and identity of tetravalent dengue vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W4229081441,"Progressive fibrous thickening of peritoneal membrane (PM) is a major complication of long-term peritoneal dialysis. TGF-Î²/SMAD pathway activation, inflammation and neoangiogenesis have an important role in PM changes induced by peritoneal dialysis. Here, we investigated the effects of paclitaxel (PTX) carried in lipid core nanoparticles (LDE) on the development of peritoneal fibrosis (PF) in rats.To induce PF, 21 male Wistar rats (300-350g) were injected with chlorhexidine gluconate for 15 consecutive days and randomly assigned to three groups: 1)PF, n = 5: no treatment; 2)LDE, n = 8: treated with LDE only, 3/3 days during 15 days; 3)LDE-PTX, n = 8: treated with PTX (4mg/kg) associated with LDE, 3/3 days during 15 days. A Control group without PF induction (n = 5) was designed, received saline solution, 3/3 days. Peritoneum function tests were performed, and anterior abdominal wall samples of the PM were collected for analyses of peritoneal thickness, immunohistochemitry, and gene expression.LDE-PTX treatment preserved the membrane function, maintaining the ultrafiltration rate and mass transfer of glucose at normal levels. LDE-PTX also prevented PM thickening induced by chlorhexidine gluconate injections. LDE-PTX treatment reduced the number of myofibroblasts infiltrating PM and inhibited the cell proliferation. Gene expression of fibronectin, FSP-1, VEGF, TGF-Î², and SMAD3 were reduced by LDE-PTX.LDE-PTX was effective to prevent development of PF and preserve the PM filtration capacity in this rat model, with clear-cut actions on pro-fibrotic mechanisms. Thus, LDE-PTX can be candidate for future clinical trials as adjuvant to peritoneal dialysis to prevent PF development, since this preparation is devoid of toxicity as shown previously."
