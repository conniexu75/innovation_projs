https://openalex.org/W2004290556,"Kinesin is a microtubule-activated ATPase thought to transport membrane-bounded organelles along MTs. To illuminate the structural basis for this function, EM was used to locate submolecular domains on bovine brain kinesin. Rotary shadowed kinesin appeared rod-shaped and approximately 80 nm long. One end of each molecule contained a pair of approximately 10 x 9 nm globular domains, while the opposite end was fan-shaped. Monoclonal antibodies against the approximately 124 kd heavy chains of kinesin decorated the globular structures, while those specific for the approximately 64 kd light chains labeled the fan-shaped end. Quick-freeze, deep-etch EM was used to analyze MTs polymerized from tubulin and cross-linked to latex microspheres by kinesin. Microspheres frequently attached to MTs by arm-like structures, 25-30 nm long. The MT attachment sites often appeared as one or two approximately 10 nm globular bulges. Morphologically similar cross-links were observed by quick-freeze, deep-etch EM between organelles and MTs in the neuronal cytoskeleton in vivo. These collective observations suggest that bovine brain kinesin binds to MTs by globular domains that contain the heavy chains, and that the attachment sites for organelles are at the opposite, fan-shaped end of kinesin, where the light chains are located."

A novel, aberrant Rb protein detected in J82 bladder carcinoma cells was not able to form a complex with E1A and was less stable than p105-Rb. By means of a rapid method for the detection of mutations in Rb mRNA, this defective Rb protein was observed to result from a single point mutation within a splice acceptor sequence in J82 genomic DNA. This mutation eliminates a single exon and 35 amino acids from its encoded protein product."
https://openalex.org/W2049611094,"The structure and function of kinesin heavy chain from D. melanogaster have been studied using DNA sequence analysis and analysis of the properties of truncated kinesin heavy chain synthesized in vitro. Analysis of the sequence suggests the existence of a 50 kd globular amino-terminal domain that contains an ATP binding consensus sequence, followed by another 50-60 kd domain that has sequence characteristics consistent with the ability to fold into an alpha helical coiled coil. The properties of amino- and carboxy-terminally truncated kinesin heavy chains synthesized in vitro reveal that a 60 kd amino-terminal fragment has the nucleotide-dependent microtubule binding activities of the intact kinesin heavy chain, and hence is likely to be a ""motor"" domain. Finally, the sequence data indicate the presence of a small carboxy-terminal domain. Because it is located at the end of the molecule away from the putative ""motor"" domain, we propose that this domain is responsible for interactions with other proteins, vesicles, or organelles. These data suggest that kinesin has an organization very similar to that of myosin even though there are no obvious sequence similarities between the two molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1581591459,"The binding of urokinase-type plasminogen activators (u-PA) to receptors on various cell types has been proposed to be an important feature of many cellular processes requiring extracellular proteolysis. We have investigated the effect of single-chain u-PA binding to the monocyte-like cell line U937 on plasminogen activation. A 16-fold acceleration of the activation of plasminogen was observed at optimal concentrations of single-chain u-PA. This potentiation was abolished by the addition of either 6-aminohexanoic acid or the amino-terminal fragment of u-PA, thus demonstrating the requirement for specific binding of both single-chain u-PA and plasminogen to the cells. The mechanism of the enhancement of plasmin generation appears to be due primarily to an increase in the rate of feedback activation of single-chain u-PA to the more active two-chain u-PA by cell-bound plasmin, initially generated by single-chain u-PA. This increased activity of the plasminogen activation system in the presence of U937 cells provides a mechanism whereby u-PAs may exert their influence in a variety of cell-associated proteolytic events."
https://openalex.org/W2048464939,"The role of cytoplasmic dynein in microtubule-based organelle transport was examined using a reconstituted assay developed from chick embryo fibroblasts. Factors present in a high-speed cytosol caused the movement of purified organelles on microtubules predominantly in the minus end direction. Inactivation of cytoplasmic dynein in the high-speed cytosol by vanadate-mediated UV photocleavage inhibited minus end-directed organelle motility by over 90%. Addition of purified cytoplasmic dynein to the inactive cytosol restored minus end-directed organelle motility, although purified cytoplasmic dynein by itself did not support organelle movement. We propose that cytoplasmic dynein is the motor for minus end-directed organelle movement, but that additional cytosolic factors are also required to produce organelle motility."

https://openalex.org/W1534240923,"Purified NMuMG mouse mammary epithelial cell surface proteoglycan (PG), a membrane-intercalated core protein bearing both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains, binds to a thrombospondin (TSP) affinity column and is eluted by a salt gradient. Double immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrates extensive co-localization of bound exogenous TSP and cells bearing exposed cell surface PG at their apical surface. The binding, as assayed by both methods, is heparitinase-sensitive, but not chondroitinase-sensitive. Alkali-released heparan sulfate chains bind to a TSP affinity column, similarly to native PG, whereas the chrondroitin sulfate chains do not. Core protein does not bind to TSP. These results indicate that NMuMG cells bind TSP via their surface PG and that the binding is mediated by the heparan sulfate chains."
https://openalex.org/W1480092133,"The receptor for fibronectin is a member of the integrin superfamily of cell surface adhesion receptors, many of which recognize the sequence RGD in their ligands. We have developed sensitive enzyme-linked and radioreceptor assays to examine the ligand specificity of the fibronectin receptor. The fibronectin receptor bound only to fibronectin of the various Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-containing proteins tested. The smallest amount of receptor detectable in the assay was about 10 ng. Mn2+ enhanced the binding of the receptor to fibronectin 3-10-fold as compared to Ca2+ and Mg2+. Scatchard analysis of the saturation plot from the radioreceptor assay gave a dissociation constant (Kd) of 3 x 10(-8) M for the binding of fibronectin receptor to fibronectin in the presence of Mn2+. Inhibition experiments showed that the affinities of the ligands for the receptor decreased in the order of fibronectin approximately 110-kDa fibronectin fragment greater than GRGDSP peptide greater than 11.5-kDa fragment. Peptides not containing an RGD were several hundred to several thousand-fold less inhibitory than GRGDSP. These included the closely related peptides GRADSP and GRGESP, as well as three peptides containing the reverse sequence DGR. A peptide from the fibrinogen gamma-chain, KQAGDV, which had about 0.5% of the inhibitory activity of the standard GRGDSP peptide, was the most active peptide not containing an RGD. These results document the exquisite specificity of the fibronectin receptor for the RGD sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1538531107,"Abstract Calcium filling of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles in the steady state is greatly increased by precipitation of lumenal calcium with oxalate. We find that low concentrations (1 mM) of Pi also allow greater loading by forming a soluble complex with lumenal calcium, an effect that is likely to be of physiological relevance. Furthermore, ADP scavenging by ATP regenerating systems favors calcium loading by preventing reversal of the pump. We also find that uncoupling of ATPase and transport activities is another factor limiting calcium loading. In fact, calcium uptake and ATP utilization occur with a molar ratio of 2:1 in the transient state following addition of ATP but decrease to much lower values in the steady state. Even in the absence of the highly conductive channel which is present only in heavy vesicles, light vesicles display calcium leakage which is inhibited by medium Ca2+ in the concentration range of ATPase activation and is likely related to an ATPase channel which is involved in calcium transport. It is apparent that, under conditions of ATPase turnover and in the presence of high lumenal Ca2+ and ADP, slippage of calcium through this channel produces true uncoupling of catalytic and transport activities. Coupling is improved by complexation of lumenal Ca2+ and by ATP regeneration and is influenced by the solvent characteristics of the reaction medium. The synergistic effects of lumenal Ca2+ and ADP, and the role of alternate pathways for phosphoenzyme cleavage, are clarified by steady state analysis of a multiple step reaction mechanism. It is concluded that the ideal (2:1) stoichiometric coupling of transport and ATPase activities is not insured by an obligatory pathway of catalysis (as predicted by all reaction schemes published so far); rather, coupling is influenced by the concentrations of ligands and their effects on second order reactions and the consequent distribution of intermediate states."
https://openalex.org/W1545013128,"Abstract Previous studies on lipopigment isolated from sheep affected with ceroid lipofuscinosis (Batten's disease) showed that the disease is a lysosomal proteinosis, involving specific storage of peptide(s) that migrate in dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an apparent Mr of 3500. This band is the dominant contributor to the lipopigment mass. When purified total lipopigment proteins were loaded onto a protein sequencer, a dominant sequence was found, identical to the NH2 terminus of the lipid-binding subunit of protein translocating mitochondrial ATP synthase. This sequence was determined to 40 residues and a minimum estimate of 40% made for its contribution to the lipopigment protein mass. The full lipid-binding subunit has physical and chemical properties similar to those of the specifically stored low Mr peptide, which may be the full protein or a large NH2-terminal fragment of it. Lipopigments in the human ceroid lipofuscinoses also contain a major component with similar physical and chemical properties. These and previous results indicate that the genetic lesion in ovine ceroid lipofuscinosis causes an abnormal accumulation of this peptide in lysosomes, i.e. the disease is a proteolipid proteinosis, specifically a lysosomal mitochondrial ATP synthase lipid-binding subunit proteinosis. The analogous human diseases are likely to reflect storage of the same or similar peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1565985941,"Although such solubility is uncommon among proteins generally, several bovine brain proteins were found to be soluble in 2.5% perchloric acid, and many of them were in vitro substrates for protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme). Two of the perchloric acid-soluble brain proteins were purified, p43 and p17. P43 and p17 could be phosphorylated by protein kinase C only in the presence of Ca2+ and phospholipids and neither was a substrate for protein kinase II. P43 was subsequently identified as the neurospecific, calmodulin-binding protein, neuromodulin (also designated P-57, GAP43, B50, or F1) (Alexander, K. H., Wakim, B. T., Doyle, G. S., Walsh, K. A., and Storm, D. R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 7544-7549). A rapid purification method for neuromodulin was developed taking advantage of its newly discovered property, solubility in 2.5% perchloric acid, and of its previously recognized calmodulin-binding property. Evidence was obtained that neuromodulin isolated from cytosolic extract exists as a mixture of molecular forms and that the Ca2+-binding S100 protein-beta discriminates among the different neuromodulin isoforms in forming covalent complexes via disulfide bridges; this discrimination may be explained by analogous differences observed between the NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of p57 and F1. Solubility in 2.5% perchloric acid was demonstrated for another rat brain protein kinase C substrate, p87. We suggest that perchloric acid solubility might be a common property of protein kinase C substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2006901072,"The adult form of Tay-Sachs disease, adult GM2 gangliosidosis, is an autosomal recessive disorder that results from mutations in the alpha chain of beta-hexosaminidase A. This disorder, like infantile Tay-Sachs disease, is more frequent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. A point mutation in the alpha-chain gene was identified that results in the substitution of Gly with Ser in eight Ashkenazi adult GM2 gangliosidosis patients from five different families. This amino acid substitution was shown to depress drastically the catalytic activity of the alpha chain after expression in COS-1 cells. All of these patients proved to be compound heterozygotes of the allele with the Gly to Ser change and one of the two Ashkenazi infantile Tay-Sachs alleles. These findings will aid in the diagnosis and understanding of beta-hexosaminidase A deficiency disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1573088096,"The peripheral (catalytic) sector of vacuolar H+-ATPases contains five different polypeptides denoted as subunits A-E in order of decreasing molecular masses from 72 to 33 kDa. The gene encoding subunit B (57 kDa) of yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase was cloned on a 5-kilobase pair genomic DNA fragment and sequenced. Four open reading frames were identified in the sequenced DNA. One of them encodes a protein of 504 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 56,557. Hydropathy plot revealed no apparent transmembrane segments. Southern analysis demonstrated that a single gene encodes this polypeptide in the yeast genome. The amino acid sequence exhibits extensive identity with the homologous protein from the plant Arabidopsis (77%). This polypeptide also contains regions of homology with the alpha subunits of H+-ATPases from mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria. However, less similarity was detected when it was compared with the beta subunits of those enzymes. The implication of these phenomena on the evolution of proton pumps is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2102626689,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) binds to specific high affinity receptors (EGF-Rs) and induces endosome-specific internalization and degradation of ligand-receptor complexes in lysosomes. We report here that EGF-R is down-regulated in an analogous manner during early infection of a variety of cell types by group C human adenoviruses. This effect is not a function of viral entry, nor is it due to a nonspecific increase in turnover of membrane proteins. Using a series of virus deletion mutants, the gene responsible for EGF-R down-regulation was mapped to the E3 transcription unit. The E3 gene product, a protein of MW 10,400 (10.4K), induces internalization and degradation of EGF-R, but does not affect synthesis of the EGF-R precursor. The 10.4K protein is not an EGF-like autocrine growth factor, but is similar in sequence to a region in EGF-R at the cytoplasmic face of the transmembrane domain. This suggests that down-regulation of EGF-R during adenovirus infection may occur by a novel mechanism that involves the formation of hetero-oligomers composed of 10.4K and EGF-R."
https://openalex.org/W1493642813,"Abstract The properties of detergents required to substitute the lipid environment of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase with retention of good functional properties were determined by the use of a large number of diverse detergents and delipidated enzyme. Detergents having an intermediate chain length (approximately equal to C12) and a polyoxyethylene glycol or carbohydrate polar group were optimal for Ca2+-ATPase function and stabilization, while detergents with short alkyl chain (C8) or bulky head groups and many zwitterionic detergents led to rapid inactivation. Under optimal conditions (including solubilization in the E1 state), stability of delipidated Ca2+-ATPase approximated that obtained by solubilization of Ca2+-ATPase with a layer of bound lipid. Some detergents (in particular long chain members of the Tween family) were characterized by an inadequate interaction with delipidated Ca2+-ATPase, resulting in biphasic inactivation. According to analytical ultracentrifugation and high performance liquid chromatography experiments, the rapid and slow components of biphasic inactivation were due to the formation of monomeric and oligomeric Ca2+-ATPase, respectively. It is concluded that both hydrophobic and polar interactions are important for the detergent effect and that solubilizing detergents of intermediate and short chain length may be bound as a monolayer, differently than the membrane lipid. Long chain detergents cause protein aggregation and, despite their resemblance to natural lipids, are inferior in their activity-retaining properties. The previous use of such detergents to prepare oligomeric Ca2+-ATPase with long term retention of activity (cf. Moller, J. V., Anderson, J. P., and le Maire, M. (1988) Methods Enzymol. 157, 261-270) is shown to depend on the presence of residual lipid in these preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1524248891,"Abstract The fidelity of DNA polymerase-alpha-primase from calf thymus has been analyzed by measuring mutagenesis in vitro and by site-specific nucleotide misinsertion and mispair extension. Using the phi X174 am3 DNA reversion assay errors are detected at the amber3 site only when both dATP and dCTP are significantly biased during in vitro copying reactions. Analysis of these products on DNA sequencing gels reveals pause sites due to the slow extension of mispaired 3' termini. Measurements of misinsertion rates opposite template A show that the rates of dAMP or dCMP misinsertion are similar and occur 40-50 times more rapidly than dGMP misinsertion. The rate of extension from an A:C mispair is 100- and 400-fold greater than from an A:A mispair and an A:G mispair, respectively. Nucleotide misinsertions to generate all 12 possible mispairs have been measured kinetically on phi X174 DNA templates that contain either A, C, G, or T at position 587. Misinsertion frequencies range from 1/4000 to 1/10(6) depending on the mispairs generated. Extension from all 12 different mispairs was examined by starting with oligonucleotide primers that contain different 3'-terminal mispairs. Rates of extension from mispairs are 10(3) to 10(6) times slower than from correctly paired bases. Extension frequencies were purine:pyrimidine greater than pyrimidine:pyrimidine greater than purine:purine. Lack of extension of misincorporated bases suggests the involvement of exonucleolytic proofreading to enable continued DNA synthesis and to guarantee the high fidelity of eucaryotic DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1585590389,"Abstract Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) specifically inhibits the F1F0-H+-ATP synthase complex of Escherichia coli by covalently modifying a proteolipid subunit that is embedded in the membrane. Multiple copies of the DCCD-reactive protein, also known as subunit c, are found in the F1F0 complex. In order to determine the minimum stoichiometry of reaction, we have treated E. coli membranes with DCCD, at varying concentrations and for varying times, and correlated inhibition of ATPase activity with the degree of modification of subunit c. Subunit c was purified from the membrane, and the degree of modification was determined by two methods. In the method, the moles of [14C]DCCD per total mole of subunit c was calculated from the radioactivity incorporated per mg of protein, and conversion of mg of protein to mol of protein based upon amino acid analysis. In the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) peak method, the DCCD-modified subunit c was separated from unmodified subunit c on an anion exchange AX300 HPLC column, and the areas of the peaks from the chromatogram quantitated. The shape of the modification versus inhibition curve indicated that modification of a single subunit c per F0 was sufficient to abolish ATPase activity. The titration data were fit by nonlinear regression analysis to a single hit mathematical model, A = Un(1 - r) + r, where A is the relative activity, U is the ratio of unmodified/total subunit c, n is the number of subunit c per F0, and r is a residual fraction of ATPase activity that was resistant to inhibition by DCCD. The two methods gave values for n equal to 10 by the specific radioactivity method and 14 by the HPLC peak area method, and values for r of 0.28 and 0.30, respectively. Most of the r value was accounted for by the observed dissociation of 15-20% of the F1-ATPase from the membrane under ATPase assay conditions. When the minimal, experimentally justified value of r = 0.15 was used in the equation above, the calculated values of n were reduced to 8 and 11, respectively. The value of n determined here, with a probable range of uncertainty of 8-14, is consistent with, and provides an independent type of experimental support for, the suggested stoichiometry of 10 +/- 1 subunit c per F1F0, which was determined by a more precise radiolabeling method (Foster, D. L., and Fillingame, R. H. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 2009-2015)."
https://openalex.org/W1641240062,"Abstract Equilibrium-binding data of highly purified 125I-labeled avian lipoprotein lipase to cultured avian adipocytes demonstrate the presence of a class of high affinity binding sites. Analysis of the binding function yielded an association constant of 0.62 x 10(8)M-1 and a maximum binding capacity of 2.1 micrograms/60-mm dish. From a time course of dissociation of 125I-lipoprotein lipase from adipocytes at 4 degrees C, a dissociation rate constant of 6.1 x 10(-5)s-1 was obtained. Pretreatment of cells with heparinase and heparitinase resulted in a quantitative suppression of the high affinity binding component, establishing that lipoprotein lipase is bound to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. At 37 degrees C, cell surface-bound 125I-lipoprotein lipase is internalized and either degraded or recycled to the medium. The degradation rate constant for 125I-lipoprotein lipase was estimated to be 0.78 h-1. The degradation rate constant was reduced 6-fold when cells were exposed to 100 microM chloroquine, indicating that most of the degradation occurs within the lysosomal compartment. By using cells that had been pulsed with Trans35S-label for 1 h, it was demonstrated that acute treatment with endoglycosidases for up to 1 h resulted in a new lipoprotein lipase secretion rate which was 6-fold higher than that of control cells. Degradation of newly synthesized lipoprotein lipase was essentially blocked 30 min after the initiation of the chase. In other studies it was observed that there were no additive effects of chloroquine and either endoglycosidase or heparin treatment on total lipoprotein lipase levels (intracellular, cell surface, and medium) in adipocyte cultures. These experiments support the hypothesis that the release of lipoprotein lipase from its receptor prevents its internalization and degradation and enhances enzyme efflux from the adipocyte. A new model of lipoprotein lipase secretion in cultured adipocytes is proposed: Newly synthesized lipoprotein lipase is transported to the cell surface where it binds to specific heparan sulfate proteoglycan receptors. The enzyme is either released to the medium or internalized via the receptor, in which case the enzyme is degraded or recycled to the cell surface. Major determinants of enzyme efflux from the cell surface include the number and integrity of receptors, the association constant of the enzyme-receptor complex, and the presence in the medium of competing molecules with high affinity for lipoprotein lipase. In this model, modulation of lipoprotein lipase degradation rate may be a significant mechanism for acute regulation of enzyme efflux independent of changes in the rate of enzyme synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1538717037,"We have previously reported that both 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) can stimulate the synthesis rate of EGF receptors. We now show that the MDA468 breast cancer cells express the mRNA for the EGF-like molecule, transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), and demonstrate that TPA or EGF cause an accumulation of both EGF receptor and TGF-alpha mRNA. The levels of EGF receptor mRNA paralleled our earlier protein data, with peak accumulations of 2-3-fold with 10(-9) M EGF and 3-5-fold with 100 ng/ml TPA seen between 6 and 8 h. A 7-fold accumulation of TGF-alpha mRNA was seen following 4 h of treatment with TPA, and a 2-fold accumulation was seen after 8 h with EGF. These changes in EGF receptor and TGF-alpha mRNAs were observed in the absence of any change in the mRNA level of the alpha-subunit of hexosaminidase A (a lysosomal enzyme), demonstrating some degree of specificity. Detectable quantities of immunoreactive TGF-alpha accumulated in the cell culture medium of MDA468 cell treated with the blocking anti-EGF receptor monoclonal antibody B1D8 while no immunoreactive TGF-alpha was detected in the medium of cells with unblocked receptors. The concentration of B1D8 used was sufficient to block the binding of exogenously added 125I-EGF to undetectable levels but had only minor effects on cell growth and no effect on the expression of the TGF-alpha and EGF receptor mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1952200222,Abstract The effects of cadmium (Cd2+) on transmembrane Ca2+ transport and on the membrane permeability for Ca2+ were studied in human erythrocytes. The erythrocyte Ca2+ pump is inhibited competitively by Cd2+ via interaction with the Ca2+ transport site of the carrier and not via interaction with its activator calmodulin. The affinity of the Ca2+ pump for Cd2+ is extremely high (KI = 2.0 nM Cd2+). Cd2+ (less than or equal to 10(-4) M) does not alter the membrane permeability for Ca2+. We conclude that the pivotal mechanism in the toxic action of Cd2+ is the inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase mediated Ca2+ extrusion. As a result Cd2+ disturbs intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and may increase cytosolic Ca2+ (Ca2+i) to toxic levels.
https://openalex.org/W1600235198,"Glucocorticoids have been shown to decrease prostaglandin I2 synthesis in human endothelial cells, suggesting the possible involvement of lipocortin in the inhibition of arachidonic acid liberation achieved by phospholipase A2 (De Caterina, R., and Weksler, B. B. (1986) Thromb. Haemostasis 55, 369-374). To test this hypothesis, human endothelial cells labeled with [14C]arachidonic acid were stimulated with thrombin (2 units/ml, 10 min), resulting in the secretion of free arachidonic acid together with various 14C-labeled metabolites, mainly 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, the stable derivative of prostaglandin I2. Under conditions where prior incubation of cells with dexamethasone reduced by 51% 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha production, phospholipid hydrolysis induced by thrombin remained unaffected. Using three rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against endonexin I, lipocortin I, and lipocortin II, evidence was obtained for the presence in human endothelial cells of equivalent amounts of lipocortin I and an immunologically unrelated 33-kDa protein, together with lower quantities of 67-kDa calelectrin/calcimedin. These Ca2+- and phospholipid-binding proteins were selectively extracted with [ethylene-bis(oxyethylene-nitrilo)]tetraacetic acid (EGTA) from cell membranes precipitated in the presence of Ca2+, and they displayed an inhibitory activity against pig pancreas phospholipase A2. However, the amounts of the three proteins were not changed by cell treatment with 2.5 microM dexamethasone, as detected upon polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by silver staining, immunoblotting, or autoradiography following [35S]methionine in vivo labeling. Since the antiphospholipase A2 activity of EGTA extracts was hardly modified, it was concluded that an increased synthesis of lipocortin cannot account for the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis brought about by dexamethasone, suggesting other biological functions for these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1579972668,"Like humans, baboons possess serum lipoprotein(a) that contains apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a], and baboon apo(a) also occurs in distinguishable glycoprotein isoforms. To investigate the molecular basis for isoform size variation, we isolated hepatic RNA from baboons possessing different apo(a) isoforms for Northern blot analyses with rhesus apo(a) cDNA probes. In a survey of 22 baboons, we detected a variety of sizes of apo(a) transcripts (5.2-11.2 kilobases) that corresponded with relative mobilities and numbers of serum apo(a) isoforms. In unrelated baboons possessing apo(a) isoforms of similar mobilities, we detected apo(a) transcripts with similar mobilities. In related baboons possessing apo(a) isoforms that were identical by descent, apo(a) transcripts were also identical in size. Using data from 22 baboons included in this study, we compared the sizes of 20 apo(a) isoforms and corresponding transcripts. Linear regression analysis established a highly significant correlation (p less than 0.001) between estimated apo(a) transcript size and glycoprotein mass (r2 = 0.996). From these results, we conclude that apo(a) glycoprotein isoforms are due to structural differences in apo(a) transcripts. However, we also noted exceptions to correspondence between apo(a) transcripts and isoforms that suggest the action of additional post-transcriptional control of serum apo(a) levels."
https://openalex.org/W1516498539,"When hepatocytes isolated from adult rats were cultured in the presence of 10 mM nicotinamide, insulin- and epidermal growth factor-induced DNA synthesis and cell proliferation were found to be greatly stimulated, and the cells were able to be kept alive for more than one month. In the nicotinamide-treated hepatocytes, albumin and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase mRNAs were present at much higher levels than in the untreated control, and the inducibility of tryptophan oxygenase gene expression by dexamethasone and glucagon was also preserved. Without nicotinamide, primary cultured hepatocytes were viable for only 5-7 days and the hepatocyte-specific phenotypes were rapidly lost. The intracellular NAD level was maintained in the nicotinamide-treated hepatocytes at or above the level in intact liver but depleted in hepatocytes without nicotinamide. These results suggest that the maintenance of the intracellular NAD level is essential for the growth and functioning of hepatocytes and that nicotinamide can preserve the NAD level by blocking NAD degradation as well as by acting as a precursor for NAD synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1495869497,"Phosphorylated rabbit cardiac alpha alpha-tropomyosin has been prepared either enzymatically (Montgomery, K., and Mak, A.S. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 5555-5560) or by fractionation of the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms on a Mono Q column in 9 M urea, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0. Although the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms showed no difference in their F-actin binding properties, the phosphorylated protein had substantially higher viscosities at low ionic strengths, indicating a greater propensity for head-to-tail interaction. Similar measurements showed the strengthening of this interaction by whole troponin to be substantially reduced by phosphorylation even though the binding of whole troponin and troponin T to tropomyosin was demonstrated by affinity chromatography to be, if anything, strengthened by phosphorylation. In a reconstituted actin (4 microM) plus myosin subfragment 1 ATPase assay (50 mM ionic strength), significantly higher activities over a range (1 to 8 microM) of subfragment 1 concentrations were observed with phosphorylated tropomyosin compared with the nonphosphorylated protein. In the fully reconstituted system with troponin, there was no significant difference in the inhibition of ATPase in the absence of Ca2+. However, in its presence, the activities were appreciably increased with the phosphorylated tropomyosin compared to those with the nonphosphorylated form. These differences were eliminated by treatment of the phosphorylated tropomyosin with alkaline phosphatase. This is the first demonstration of an effect of phosphorylation on the functional properties of tropomyosin."

Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were raised against the 53-kDa glycoprotein and found to cross-react with the 160-kDa glycoprotein. A combination of antibody and synthetic oligonucleotide screening was used to isolate a cDNA encoding the 53-kDa glycoprotein of rabbit fast-twitch skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum. The cDNA encodes a protein of 453 amino acids with Mr of 52,421 and a 19-residue amino-terminal signal sequence. The deduced sequence contains two potential glycosylation sites and is largely hydrophilic. The presence of a glycine-rich sequence in the glycoprotein with homology to mononucleotide binding domains supports earlier observations that the glycoprotein binds ATP with high affinity. Although two sequences appear to be hydrophobic on a hydropathy plot, they are not sufficiently long nor sufficiently hydrophobic to qualify unambiguously as transmembrane sequences. The glycoprotein, like calsequestrin, was shown to be inaccessible to trypsin in intact sarcoplasmic reticulum. It can be eluted from the sarcoplasmic reticulum by extraction with [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid under hypotonic conditions. Thus, the glycoprotein appears to be localized entirely in the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and to be associated with the inner membrane surface through Ca2+-dependent mechanisms. Cotransfection of COS-1 cells with cDNAs encoding the glycoprotein and the Ca2+-ATPase led to expression of both proteins with a common localization in the microsomal fraction. The Ca2+ pumping activity of the microsomes isolated from transfected cells was unaltered by the presence of the glycoprotein. Thus the glycoprotein does not appear to modulate Ca2+-ATPase function."
https://openalex.org/W1552200847,"Abstract Previous studies have indicated that the processing of oligosaccharide chains is necessary for lipoprotein lipase to become catalytically active and may be involved in the regulation of lipase release. Guinea pig adipocytes and perfused guinea pig hearts were labeled with [35S]methionine, and lipoprotein lipase was immunoprecipitated. Digestion with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo H) showed that the mature enzyme contains one high mannose and two complex oligosaccharide chains. Limited proteolysis indicated where in the molecule the chains are attached. Pulse-chase experiments showed that some lipase molecules were rapidly processed and appeared in the medium within 40 min. Other lipase molecules remained fully Endo H-sensitive for more than 2 h, and this form of the lipase did not appear in the medium. Both forms co-eluted with the sole lipoprotein lipase activity peak from heparin-Sepharose; this indicates that both were dimeric. Separation of the two forms was achieved by lectin chromatography and demonstrated that both were catalytically active. Cells treated with methyl-deoxynojirimycin or with deoxymannojirimycin produced and released active lipoprotein lipase which was fully Endo H-sensitive. These studies demonstrate that the trimming and processing of the oligosaccharide chains is not necessary for lipoprotein lipase to become catalytically active and be secreted, and they suggest that a comparatively large fraction of the lipase molecules is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. Whether they ever reach the processing apparatus in the Golgi or are degraded is not clear."
https://openalex.org/W1526563753,"Anti-Sm is an antibody specificity often associated with the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus. The polypeptides Sm-B'/B (estimated molecular mass 27 and 26 kDa, respectively) are primary targets of Sm antibodies. Sm-B'/B are part of the core polypeptides of small ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNP) involved in pre-mRNA splicing. Sm-B'/B share the same amino-terminal sequence as we determined by microsequence analyses of the purified polypeptides. Oligonucleotide probes based on that sequence were used to isolate seven clones from a human lymphoblastoid cDNA library in lambda gt10. The clones contained a single coding region for a protein of approximately 25 kDa. The predicted amino-terminal sequence was identical to that of the isolated Sm-B'/B polypeptides. In vitro translation experiments produced a protein immunoreactive with human polyclonal anti-Sm antibodies. The isolation of only one unique cDNA sequence suggests that Sm-B'/B may be post-translational variants encoded by a single message. The specific structural features which distinguish Sm-B' from Sm-B have yet to be determined. Northern blot analysis confirmed the diverse tissue and species distribution expected for these immunologically conserved polypeptides. The Sm-B'/B primary sequence is rich in proline (20%) and glycine (15%) residues. The prolines are concentrated in the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein and display a repetitive unit that is shared with other snRNP and nucleic acid binding proteins. Analysis of these arrays suggests an eight residue proline-rich consensus sequence with potential as either an RNA binding domain, or as a site of protein/protein interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1670688027,"In order to obtain a better understanding of the control mechanisms involved in asparagine-linked glycosylation, we developed conditions under which the glucosidase I and II inhibitor castanospermine and the mannosidase II inhibitor swainsonine were toxic to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells when cultured in the presence of low concentrations of the plant lectin concanavalin A. Cells resistant to castanospermine (CsR cells) and swainsonine (SwR cells) were obtained by gradual stepwise selections. These cells had normal levels of glucosidase II and mannosidase II and appeared to have no major structural alterations in their surface asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. Interestingly, the CsR and SwR cells were each pleiotropically resistant to castanospermine, swainsonine, and deoxymannojirimycin, an inhibitor of mannosidase I. This resistance was not due to the multiple-drug resistance phenomenon. Both the CsR and SwR cell populations synthesized Man5GlcNAc2 in place of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 as the major dolichol-linked oligosaccharide. This defect was not due to a loss of mannosylphosphoryldolichol synthetase. Furthermore, the Man5GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide was transferred to protein and appeared to give rise to normal mature oligosaccharides. Thus, the CsR and SwR cells achieved resistance to castanospermine, swainsonine, and deoxymannojirimycin by synthesizing altered dolichol-linked oligosaccharides that reduced or eliminated the requirements for glucosidases I and II and mannosidases I and II during the production of normal asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. We propose that this phenotype be termed PIR, for processing inhibitor resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1578091636,"Abnormal beta-hexosaminidase beta chain cDNA clones were isolated from a library constructed from cultured fibroblasts of a patient with a juvenile form of Sandhoff disease (genetic beta-hexosaminidase A and B deficiency). Sequence analysis of a cDNA clone isolated from these fibroblasts contained an extra 24-base segment between exons 12 and 13. This segment was identified as the 3' terminus of intron 12. The remainder of the coding sequence was completely normal. The same 24-base insertion was found in four additional clones by sequencing. Restriction mapping analysis of seven other clones was consistent with the presence of the same 24-base intron 12 segment. This insertion is inframe and adds 8 amino acids between amino acids 491 and 492 of the primary sequence of the normal enzyme protein. It is located only 5 amino acids away from a possible glycosylation site. The finding is consistent with the slightly larger than normal size of the beta subunit precursor protein observed by immunoprecipitation. No normally spliced mRNA was detected. Gene amplification by the polymerase chain reaction and subsequent sequencing of genomic DNA indicated that the patient was a compound heterozygote. In one allele, there was a single nucleotide transition from normal G to A at 26 bases from the 3' terminus of intron 12. This mutation generates a consensus sequence for the 3' splice site for an intron, CAG/G, and thus explains the abnormal mRNAs that retain 24 bases of the 3' terminus of intron 12. The intron 12 and flanking exons 12 and 13 sequences were normal in the other allele, which is a priori also genetically abnormal. The other mutant allele therefore is likely to be of an mRNA-negative type."
https://openalex.org/W1575082812,"Abstract The assembly pathway of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) particles in the cytoplasm of L929 mouse fibroblasts was analyzed by observing the nuclear accumulation of snRNP proteins. Immunoprecipitations of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions after a pulse label and chase indicate that the snRNP D, E, F, and G proteins assemble first, followed by the small nuclear RNA (snRNA), then the snRNP B protein and, in the case of the U1 snRNP, the A and C proteins. The snRNP B' protein is not detected in the L929 cells. The U1-specific A and C proteins can enter the nucleus in the absence of snRNP assembly, suggesting that these proteins exchange on the mature nuclear snRNP particles. Two-dimensional electrophoresis using nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis identifies the A, B, C, D, E, F, and G proteins in a distribution similar to that reported previously by immunoprecipitation (Sauterer, R. A., and Zieve, G. W. (1989) J. Biol. Chem., submitted for publication). The D protein appears in multiple isoelectric variants in the cytoplasm and shifts toward more basic variants during maturation. Kinetic experiments analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis indicate a quantitative maturation of the cytoplasmic B protein into nuclear particles. Quantitative densitometry of immunoprecipitated stable nuclear snRNPs labeled with [35S] methionine corrected for the published methionine content of the A, C, D, and E proteins indicates that the mature nuclear U1 snRNP probably contains four copies of D, two copies each of C, and A, and one copy of E."
https://openalex.org/W1492596311,"Abstract During ATP hydrolysis the K+-translocating Kdp-ATPase from Escherichia coli forms a phosphorylated intermediate as part of the catalytic cycle. The influence of effectors (K+, Na+, Mg2+, ATP, ADP) and inhibitors (vanadate, N-ethylmaleimide, bafilomycin A1) on the phosphointermediate level and on the ATPase activity was analyzed in purified wild-type enzyme (apparent Km = 10 microM) and a KdpA mutant ATPase exhibiting a lower affinity for K+ (Km = 6 mM). Based on these data we propose a minimum reaction scheme consisting of (i) a Mg2+-dependent protein kinase, (ii) a Mg2+-dependent and K+-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphatase, and (iii) a K+-independent basal phosphoprotein phosphatase. The findings of a K+-uncoupled basal activity, inhibition by high K+ concentrations, lower ATP saturation values for the phosphorylation than for the overall ATPase reaction, and presumed reversibility of the phosphoprotein formation by excess ADP indicated similarities in fundamental principles of the reaction cycle between the Kdp-ATPase and eukaryotic E1E2-ATPases. The phosphoprotein was tentatively characterized as an acylphosphate on the basis of its alkali-lability and its sensitivity to hydroxylamine. The KdpB polypeptide was identified as the phosphorylated subunit after electrophoretic separation at pH 2.4, 4 degrees C of cytoplasmic membranes or of purified ATPase labeled with [gamma-32P]ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1486048239,"We have synthesized a new class of ATP photo-affinity analogs, 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)-8-azido (TNP-8N3)-ATP, -ADP, and -AMP, and their radiolabeled derivatives, and characterized their interaction with sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. The nucleotides bind with high affinity (Kd = 0.04-0.4 microM) to the catalytic site of the Ca2+-ATPase. TNP-8N3-ATP and TNP-8N3-ADP, at low concentrations (less than 10 microM), accelerate ATPase activity 1.5- and 1.4-fold, respectively, indicating that they bind to a regulatory site. In the same concentration range, they all undergo a large increase in fluorescence (superfluorescence) during enzyme turnover in the presence of ATP and Ca2+, or on phosphorylation from Pi in a Ca2+-depleted medium. Irradiation at alkaline pH results in specific covalent incorporation of the nucleotide at the catalytic site on the A1 tryptic subfragment. The efficiency of catalytic site labeling is greatest (up to 80% of available sites/irradiation period) in the presence of ATP, Ca2+, and Mg2+, conditions in which the probe binds only to the regulatory and superfluorescent sites. The covalently attached nucleotide exhibits fluorescence enhancement on enzyme turnover in the presence of acetyl phosphate plus Ca2+ or on phosphorylation from Pi in a Ca2+-depleted medium, but not in the presence of ATP plus Ca2+. The results suggest that the catalytic, regulatory, and superfluorescent nucleotide sites are at the same locus and that the binding domain includes portions of the A1 subfragment. The high efficiency with which the site is photolabeled during turnover is ascribed to water exclusion and possibly cleft closure in E2-P."
https://openalex.org/W1480634264,"Abstract A monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibody (H10E4C9F) that interacts with the aldosterone receptors was generated using an auto-anti-idiotypic approach by immunizing a mouse with a 3-O-carboxymethyloxime of aldosterone coupled to bovine serum albumin. This antibody, an IgG1, displayed internal image properties of aldosterone and was considered as an Ab2 beta according to the following criteria. (i) H10E bound to Fab fragments of affinity-purified rabbit anti-aldosterone antibody that had high affinity for aldosterone (Kd = 5 x 10(-10) M). Binding was inhibited by aldosterone but not by estradiol. (ii) H10E inhibited [3H]aldosterone binding to rabbit polyclonal antibodies and also to murine monoclonal antibodies raised during the same fusion. Inhibition was concentration-dependent. These results are consistent with the antibody recognizing an interspecies cross-reacting epitope involved in the aldosterone combining site. (iii) The antibody could be affinity-purified on an immobilized monoclonal anti-aldosterone antibody. (iv) It inhibited [3H]aldosterone binding to rabbit kidney cytosolic aldosterone receptors but had no effect on glucocorticoid receptors. Additional evidence for the interaction of H10E with aldosterone receptors was provided by glycerol gradients analyses: the anti-idiotypic antibody displaced [3H]aldosterone and [3H]corticosterone from the native untransformed 9 S aldosterone receptor in the presence of RU 26988, a specific marker of glucocorticoid receptors. All of the above are consistent with the first successful production of a monoclonal antibody that mimics aldosterone and interacts specifically with the steroid binding domain of aldosterone receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1575122049,"Abstract Complexes formed from A13+ or Be2+ and fluoride inhibit the single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity of RecA protein. In contrast, poly(dT)-RecA-ADP complexes, which are inactive for cleavage of LexA protein, become fully active in the presence of AlF4- or BeF3- ions. These data suggest that fluoride complexes of aluminum and beryllium (called herein X) convert RecA-ADP complexes, which bind weakly to single-stranded DNA, into RecA-ADP-X complexes, which bind tightly to single-stranded DNA, the ADP-X moiety behaving as a nonhydrolyzable analogue of ATP. We propose that AlF4- and BeF3- ions act as analogues of inorganic phosphate by binding to the site of the gamma-phosphate of ATP on RecA-ADP complexes, hence mimicking the single-stranded DNA-RecA-ADP-Pi transition state. We conclude that the elementary reaction that switches RecA protein from a high affinity single-stranded DNA binding state to a low affinity single-stranded DNA binding state is not ATP hydrolysis per se but Pi release."
https://openalex.org/W1578637541,"Abstract We provide direct evidence for the presence of unsulfated, but fully elongated heparan glycosaminoglycans covalently linked to the protein core of a heparan sulfate proteoglycan synthesized by human colon carcinoma cells. Chemical and enzymatic studies revealed that a significant proportion of these chains contained glucuronic acid and N-acetylated glucosamine moieties, consistent with N-acetylheparosan, an established precursor of heparin and heparan sulfate. The presence of unsulfated chains was not dependent upon the exogenous supply of sulfate since their synthesis, structure, or relative amount did not vary with low exogenous sulfate concentrations. Culture in sulfate-free medium also failed to generate undersulfated heparan sulfate-proteoglycan, but revealed an endogenous source of sulfate which was primarily derived from the catabolism of the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine. Furthermore, the presence of unsulfated chains was not due to a defect in the sulfation process because pulse-chase experiments showed that they could be converted into the fully sulfated chains. However, their formation was inhibited by limiting the endogenous supply of hexosamine. The results also indicated the coexistence of the unsulfated and sulfated chains on the same protein core and further suggested that the sulfation of heparan sulfate may occur as an all or nothing phenomenon. Taken together, the results support the current biosynthetic model developed for the heparin proteoglycan in which unsulfated glycosaminoglycans are first elongated on the protein core, and subsequently modified and sulfated. These data provide the first evidence for the presence of such an unsulfated precursor in an intact cellular system."
https://openalex.org/W1527354670,"Abstract The proton-translocating ATPase of the thermophilic bacterium PS3 was reconstituted into planar phospholipid bilayers by the previously reported method (Hirata, H., Ohno, K., Sone, N., Kagawa, Y., and Hamamoto, T. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 9839-9843), and the relationship between the electric current induced by ATP and the concentration of ATP was examined. The magnitude of the electric current generated upon addition of ATP followed simple Michaelis-Menten type kinetics, and the Michaelis constant was found to be 0.14 mM under our conditions. This value is close to the values reported for F1- or F0F1-ATPase in its steady state catalytic cycle, indicating that the proton translocation is coupled to the steady state ATPase reaction. The relationship between the Km value and the membrane potential was also examined under the voltage-clamped condition, and we found that there was no apparent dependence of the Km on membrane voltage. These results together with the previous data suggest that the voltage dependence residues in some step that defines the apparent Vmax rather than Km in the reaction cycle, and proton translocation is not directly coupled to this ATP binding step."
https://openalex.org/W1529328011,"Two forms of protein kinase activity were isolated from crude extracts of Streptococcus pyogenes and partially purified by ion exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography. The phosphorylation activities were shown to be insensitive to cAMP, required the presence of divalent cations, and eluted from a Sephadex G-200 column with approximate molecular masses of 60 and 45 kDa, respectively. Both enzymes were capable of phosphorylating eukaryotic proteins and synthetic polypeptides in addition to endogenous and heterologous prokaryotic proteins at serine and tyrosine residues. Firm evidence for tyrosine kinase activity was obtained by the use of a tyrosine kinase-specific substrate, a 4:1 glutamate:tyrosine copolymer. Both protein kinases phosphorylated HPr, a phosphocarrier protein of the phosphotransferase system isolated from S. pyogenes and Bacillus stearothermophilus, but failed to phosphorylate HPr isolated from Escherichia coli. Both also phosphorylated a native polypeptide fragment (pep M24) as well as synthetic peptide copies of M protein, the major virulence determinant of group A streptococci. These results indicate that prokaryotic protein kinases are capable of phosphorylating eukaryotic proteins and suggest that the protein kinases of streptococci may play an important role not only in the phosphotransferase system but also in the virulence properties of these organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1505650038,"Abstract Arginine vasopressin (AVP)-induced formation of inositol phosphates and increased calcium efflux in smooth muscle cells (A-10) were inhibited by short term treatment with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), an activator of protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase) (Aiyar, N., Nambi, P., Whitman, M., Stassen, F. L., and Crooke, S. T. (1987) Mol. Pharmacol. 31, 180-184). Here we report that prolonged treatment of A-10 cells (48 h) with PDBu markedly enhanced AVP-induced calcium mobilization but inhibited ATP- and thrombin-induced calcium mobilization. PDBu (400 nM) doubled [Ca2+]i induced with 3 nM AVP, while the basal calcium concentrations before and after AVP were not different from those of untreated cells. The EC50 for a 24-h exposure was 2.3 nM PDBu. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was also effective, while 4-alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (48 h at 400 nM) was without effect. 4-alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate also did not affect inositol phosphate formation. PDBu markedly enhanced inositol phosphate formation induced by AVP but not by NaF. PDBu did not affect basal inositol phosphate and polyphosphoinositide levels, and cytosolic and membrane-associated phospholipase C activity. PDBu treatment (48 h, 400 nM) decreased membrane-associated and cytosolic protein kinase C activity by 80 and 90%, respectively. However, the dose response and time course of changes in protein kinase C activity did not correlate with the same curves for PDBu enhancement of AVP-induced calcium mobilization. We conclude that prolonged PDBu treatment selectively enhanced AVP-induced calcium mobilization and polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis. These effects were not caused by an increase in vasopressin receptor number and apparent affinity, an increase in phospholipase C activity, G-protein-phospholipase C coupling, formation of polyphosphoinositide, or inhibition of inositol phosphate metabolizing enzymes. Enhancement of the AVP responses did not correlate with desensitization or activation of protein kinase C. We suggest that prolonged PDBu treatment might sensitize a putative V1 receptor-G-protein-phospholipase C complex."
https://openalex.org/W1604530056,"We have isolated and characterized the gene coding for the alpha subunit of the rat mast cell high affinity IgE receptor. The gene comprises five exons and four introns and spans approximately 6.6 kilobases. The leader sequence is encoded by two exons, the second of which is only 21 base pairs long. The third and fourth exons each code for repeating immunoglobulin-like extracellular domains. A hydrophobic transmembrane domain and positively charged cytoplasmic tail are encoded by a single final exon. The sequence of the 5'-flanking region was determined, and the major transcription initiation site was mapped. The structure of the gene suggests that two minor species of RNA produced by rat basophilic leukemia cells are due to alternative splicing. In one case, the small second exon is removed entirely, and, in the other, 163 base pairs at the 3' end of the fourth exon are removed. The latter species of RNA suggests the possibility of a secreted form of the alpha chain of the receptor. A third variant species of RNA, lacking a leader sequence, may be due to use of an alternative transcription initiation site."
https://openalex.org/W2109845194,"Abstract Two point mutants of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, previously found by recombination and complementation analysis to map in the chloroplast atpB gene encoding the beta subunit of the CF1/CF0 ATP synthase, are here shown to be missense alterations near the 5' end of that gene. One mutant (ac-u-c-2-9) has a change at amino acid position 47 of the beta subunit from leucine (CTA) to arginine (CGA). In the second mutant (ac-u-c-2-29), the codon AAA (lysine) is changed to AAC (asparagine) at position 154. Spontaneous revertants of each mutant were isolated that restore the original wild type base pair. Northern analysis of total RNA and in vivo pulse labeling followed by immunoprecipitation reveals that both mutant atpB genes are transcribed and translated normally. However, immunoblots show that the amount of beta subunit associated with mutant thylakoids is only approximately 3% of that seen in wild type and that the CF1 alpha and gamma subunits are missing entirely. The disruption of ATP synthase complex assembly in these mutants is much more severe than in Escherichia coli beta subunit gene point mutants, which retain significant amounts of alpha and beta subunits on their membranes (Noumi, T., Oka, N., Kanazawa, H., and Futai, M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 7070-7075). These results support the hypothesis that there are differences in assembly of the ATP synthase between E. coli and chloroplasts. In particular they indicate that beta must be present for assembly of the alpha and gamma subunits of CF1 onto chloroplast membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1581366752,"Abstract We have previously shown that interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) induce surface IgM expression, stimulate Na+/H+ exchange, and activate protein kinase C in the murine pre-B lymphocyte cell line, 70Z/3. Because the two structurally different lymphokines induce similar effects, in this study we set out to compare the properties of the IL-1 and IFN-gamma surface receptors. In contrast to their similar cellular effects, we found that IL-1 alpha and IFN-gamma receptors have different properties. 70Z/3 have high (100 sites/cell) and low (900 sites/cell) affinity IL-1 receptors with dissociation constants (KD) 6 x 10(-11) and 10(-9) M, respectively. In contrast, IFN-gamma receptors are of one class with a KD of 3 x 10(-10) M and are at a higher number, 8000 sites/cell. After binding to their receptors both IL-1 alpha and IFN-gamma are internalized and intracellularly degraded, but the rate of internalization of IFN-gamma is greater than IL-1 alpha. The effective median concentrations (EC50) of IL-1 alpha- or IFN-gamma-induced surface IgM expression are similar (4-5 x 10(-12) M). However, at this concentration 10-fold more of IFN-gamma than IL-1 alpha molecules are bound per cell. Our studies indicate that structurally different lymphokines can induce similar biological events even though their signaling is mediated by surface receptors whose properties are different."
https://openalex.org/W2098440040,"The actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase of myosin II from Acanthamoeba castellanii is regulated by phosphorylation of 3 serine residues at the tip of the tail of each of its two heavy chains; only dephosphorylated myosin II is active, whereas the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms have identical Ca2+-ATPase activities and Mg2+-ATPase activities in the absence of F-actin. We have now chemically modified phosphorylated and dephosphorylated myosin II with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). The modification occurred principally at a single site within the NH2-terminal 73,000 Da of the globular head of the heavy chain. NEM-myosin II bound to F-actin and formed filaments normally, but the Ca2+- and Mg2+-ATPase activities of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated myosin II and the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of NEM-dephosphorylated myosin II were inhibited. Only filamentous myosin II has actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity. Native phosphorylated myosin II acquired actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity when it was co-polymerized with NEM-inactivated dephosphorylated myosin II, and the increase in its activity was cooperatively dependent on the fraction of NEM-dephosphorylated myosin II in the filaments. From this result, we conclude that the specific activity of each molecule within a filament is independent of its own state of phosphorylation, but is highly cooperatively dependent upon the state of phosphorylation of the filament as a whole. This enables the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of myosin II filaments to respond rapidly and extensively to small changes in the level of their phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1495307251,"Isozyme expression of phosphofructokinase (PFK), the key regulatory enzyme for glycolysis, was studied during differentiation of mouse C2 myoblasts to myotubes. The total PFK activity increased 20-fold during in vitro myogenesis. The rate of synthesis, relative to the rate of total protein synthesis, measured by pulse labeling and immunoprecipitation was lowest for muscle PFK (PFK-A), 0.008% in myoblasts, while those for liver (PFK-B) and brain (PFK-C) PFK were 0.017 and 0.014%, respectively. The relative rate of PFK-A synthesis increased sharply (5-fold) at an initial period of differentiation (8 h) and reached maximum of 10-fold at 48 h, to make PFK-A the major isoform synthesized in myotubes. The relative rates of synthesis for both PFK-B and PFK-C did not change drastically, decreasing slightly at 8 h, but were restored to 1.5-2-fold of myoblasts. cDNA sequences coding for mouse muscle PFK were cloned and used along with those for mouse liver PFK, which we have previously cloned, to measure by Northern blot analysis under highly stringent conditions the steady-state mRNA concentrations for muscle and liver PFK during C2 differentiation. The hybridizable mRNA level for PFK-A increased gradually, reaching 13-fold at 48 h when 80% of cells was fused to myotubes. The PFK-A mRNA level at 96 h was 90-fold of that for myoblasts. In contrast, the mRNA level for PFK-B increased slightly during differentiation, showing a maximum of 4-fold at 96 h. These results indicate isozyme-specific control of muscle PFK gene expression during C2 myoblast differentiation."
