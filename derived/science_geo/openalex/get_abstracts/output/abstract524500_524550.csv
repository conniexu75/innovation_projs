Single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) experiments quantify the copy number and location of mRNA molecules; however, the numbers of RNA species that can be simultaneously measured by smFISH has been limited. Using combinatorial labeling with error-robust encoding schemes, Chen et al. simultaneously imaged 100 to 1000 RNA species in a single cell. Such large-scale detection allows regulatory interactions to be analyzed at the transcriptome scale. Science , this issue p. 10.1126/science.aaa6090"

Montes et al. report that certain minerals of Panamanian provenance began to appear in South America during the Middle Miocene, 15 to 13 million years ago (see the Perspective by Hoorn and Flantua). The presence of the minerals indicates that rivers were flowing from the Panama Arc into the shallow marine basins of northern South America. One interpretation of this finding is that large-scale ocean flow between the Atlantic and Pacific had ended by then. If this is true, then many models of paleo-ocean circulation and biotic exchange between the Americas need to be reconsidered. Science , this issue p. 226 ; see also p. 186"

In the context of statistical mechanics, the higher the temperature, the more a system is removed from its lowest energy state. Things become more complicated in a nonequilibrium system governed by quantum mechanics and constrained by several conserved quantities. Langen et al. showed that as many as 10 temperature-like parameters are necessary to describe the steady state of a one-dimensional gas of Rb atoms that was split into two in a particular way (see the Perspective by Spielman).

https://openalex.org/W2043823611,"Protein phosphorylation regulates virtually all biological processes. Although protein kinases are popular drug targets, targeting protein phosphatases remains a challenge. Here, we describe Sephin1 (selective inhibitor of a holophosphatase), a small molecule that safely and selectively inhibited a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 in vivo. Sephin1 selectively bound and inhibited the stress-induced PPP1R15A, but not the related and constitutive PPP1R15B, to prolong the benefit of an adaptive phospho-signaling pathway, protecting cells from otherwise lethal protein misfolding stress. In vivo, Sephin1 safely prevented the motor, morphological, and molecular defects of two otherwise unrelated protein-misfolding diseases in mice, Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1B, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Thus, regulatory subunits of phosphatases are drug targets, a property exploited here to safely prevent two protein misfolding diseases."

One route proposed for converting its main component, methane, into a more readily transported liquid is conversion to benzene over zeolites containing molybdenum (Mo). However, this method suffers from low conversion efficiency. Gao et al. identified the active Mo nanostructures as well as deactivated carbide species that form during this reaction. They were also able to recover and even enhance the zeolite catalytic activity after oxygen treatments. Science , this issue p. 686"

We present a high-resolution seawater pH record across this interval, using boron isotope data combined with a quantitative modeling approach. In the latest Permian, increased ocean alkalinity primed the Earth system with a low level of atmospheric CO2 and a high ocean buffering capacity. The first phase of extinction was coincident with a slow injection of carbon into the atmosphere, and ocean pH remained stable. During the second extinction pulse, however, a rapid and large injection of carbon caused an abrupt acidification event that drove the preferential loss of heavily calcified marine biota."

Measurement of single fluorescent molecules in cell extracts can be used to trace the kinetics of such reactions. Lu et al. refined assay conditions to follow ubiquitination by an E3 ubiquitin ligase (see the Perspective by Komander). They visualized the activity of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), a ubiquitin ligase critical for control of the cell division cycle. The processive initial reaction catalyzed by the APC was replaced by slower reactions. The results show how small, commonly occurring recognition motifs can guide specific and highly controlled enzymatic events. In a companion paper, Lu et al. explored how the number and arrangement of added ubiquitin chains affected the interaction of ubiquitylated proteins with the proteasome (a protein complex that recognizes ubiquitylated proteins and degrades them). The extent of ubiquitylation determined the strength of interaction of a substrate protein with the proteasome, and the arrangement of the ubiquitin chains determined the movement of the protein into the proteasome and thus the rate of degradation.

https://openalex.org/W2046278771,"Identification of a memory drug target ISRIB is a potent inhibitor of the integrated stress response (ISR), which involves the activation of eIF2α-specific kinases, phosphorylation of eIF2α, and consequent down-regulation of global translation levels. ISRIB is also a candidate drug for treating certain memory disorders. ISRIB does not prevent eIF2α phosphorylation and must therefore act downstream of this step. Sekine et al. now report that ISRIB reverses the inhibitory effect of eIF2α phosphorylation on the activity of eIF2B, a dedicated guanine nucleotide exchange factor, enhancing its activity independently of phosphorylation (see the Perspective by Hinnebusch). The authors isolated ISRIB-resistant cells and identified a genetic lesion in a short N-terminal region of eIF2Bδ that appears to be responsible for the observed phenotype.

https://openalex.org/W2016183704,"Given the need for robust and cost-efficient in vitro models to study angiogenesis and reproducibly analyze potential pro- and antiangiogenic compounds in preclinical studies, we developed a 3-dimensional in vitro angiogenesis assay that is based on collagen gel-embedded, size-defined spheroids generated from cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Despite its wide distribution, limitations, sensitivity, robustness, and improvements, the capacity of this assay for functional screening purposes has not been elucidated thus far. By using time-lapse video microscopy, we show that tip cells lead the formation of capillary-like and partially lumenized sprouts originating from the spheroids. Angiogenic sprouting from spheroids generated from 5 different primary cultured human endothelial cell types was induced by physiologic concentrations of vascular endothelial cell growth factor 165. Based on this assay system, we determined the capacity of 880 approved drugs to interfere with or boost angiogenic sprouting, thereby assessing their putative angiogenesis-related side effects or novel applications. However, although this assay allowed for a rapid and reproducible determination of functional IC50 values of individual compounds, the sprouting results were partially affected by the HUVEC passage number and donor variability. To overcome this limitation, immortalized HUVECs (iHUVECs) showing a more homogenous response in terms of proliferation and sprouting over multiple population doublings were used in the course of this study. Collectively, the spheroid-based angiogenesis assay provides a sensitive and versatile tool to study the impact of pro- and antiangiogenic determinants on multiple steps of the angiogenic cascade. It is compatible with different endothelial cell types and allows use of iHUVECs to improve its overall robustness.—Heiss, M., Hellström, M., Kalén, M., May, T., Weber, H., Hecker, M., Augustin, H.

https://openalex.org/W1972674253,"To advocate for patients to be more actively involved with the healthcare services they receive, particularly patients living with chronic illness, the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Montreal and its affiliated hospitals developed the Patients as Partners concept where the patient is considered a full-fledged partner of the health care delivery team and the patient’s experiential knowledge is recognized. This study aims to show how patients view their engagement with healthcare professionals regarding their direct care. Using theoretical sampling, 16 semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients with chronic illness who were familiar with the concept of Patients as Partners. Data analysis followed a constructivist grounded theory approach. Patients describe themselves as proactively engaging in three types of practice, regardless of health professionals’ openness to their role as partners. The first is a process of continuous learning that allows them to acquire experiential knowledge about their health, as well as scientific information and technical know-how. The second involves their assessment of the healthcare they receive, in terms of its quality and how it aligns with their personal preferences. It includes their assessment of the quality of their relationship with the health professional and of the latter’s scientific knowledge and technical know-how. The third type, adaptation practices, builds on patients’ learning and assessments to compensate for and adapt to what has been perceived as optimal or non-optimal health or healthcare circumstances. Patients appear to play a more active and less docile role in their own direct care than suggested so far in the literature, regardless of the degree of reciprocity of the partnership or the degree to which the health professional seeks to encourage patient engagement."
https://openalex.org/W1971749790,"Acute viral bronchiolitis by Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the most common respiratory illness in children in the first year of life. RSV bronchiolitis generates large numbers of hospitalizations and an important burden to health systems. Neutrophils and their products are present in the airways of RSV-infected patients who developed increased lung disease. Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) are formed by the release of granular and nuclear contents of neutrophils in the extracellular space in response to different stimuli and recent studies have proposed a role for NETs in viral infections. In this study, we show that RSV particles and RSV Fusion protein were both capable of inducing NET formation by human neutrophils. Moreover, we analyzed the mechanisms involved in RSV Fusion protein-induced NET formation. RSV F protein was able to induce NET release in a concentration-dependent fashion with both neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase expressed on DNA fibers and F protein-induced NETs was dismantled by DNase treatment, confirming that their backbone is chromatin. This viral protein caused the release of extracellular DNA dependent on TLR-4 activation, NADPH Oxidase-derived ROS production and ERK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Together, these results demonstrate a coordinated signaling pathway activated by F protein that led to NET production. The massive production of NETs in RSV infection could aggravate the inflammatory symptoms of the infection in young children and babies. We propose that targeting the binding of TLR-4 by F protein could potentially lead to novel therapeutic approaches to help control RSV-induced inflammatory consequences and pathology of viral bronchiolitis."
https://openalex.org/W2149613436,"The sorting of proteins to the appropriate compartment is one of the most fundamental cellular processes. We found that in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, correct cotranslational endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transport required the suppressor activity of the nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC). NAC did not affect the accurate targeting of ribosomes to ER translocons mediated by the signal recognition particle (SRP) pathway but inhibited additional unspecific contacts between ribosomes and translocons by blocking their autonomous binding affinity. NAC depletion shortened the life span of Caenorhabditis elegans, caused global mistargeting of translating ribosomes to the ER, and provoked incorrect import of mitochondrial proteins into the ER lumen, resulting in a strong impairment of protein homeostasis in both compartments. Thus, the antagonistic targeting activity of NAC is important in vivo to preserve the robustness and specificity of cellular protein-sorting routes."

When examining aneuploid embryos during in vitro fertilization cycles, McCoy et al. found a large genomic region associated with defects in maternal chromosome number (see the Perspective by Vohr and Green). This region contains a gene, Polo-like Kinase 4 ( PLK4 ), that is known to affect chromosome segregation and has variants that correlate with an increased rate of maternal aneuploidy. Surprisingly, such variants occur at relatively high levels in human populations and may be under positive selection. Science , this issue p. 235 ; see also p. 180"
https://openalex.org/W2086087753,"To determine the proteomic-level responses of drought tolerant wild wheat (Triticum boeoticum), physiological and comparative proteomic analyses were conducted using the roots and the leaves of control and short term drought-stressed plants. Drought stress was imposed by transferring hydroponically grown seedlings at the 3-leaf stage into 1/2 Hoagland solution containing 20% PEG-6000 for 48 h. Root and leaf samples were separately collected at 0 (control), 24, and 48 h of drought treatment for analysis. Physiological analysis indicated that abscisic acid (ABA) level was greatly increased in the drought-treated plants, but the increase was greater and more rapid in the leaves than in the roots. The net photosynthetic rate of the wild wheat leaves was significantly decreased under short-term drought stress. The deleterious effects of drought on the studied traits mainly targeted photosynthesis. Comparative proteomic analysis identified 98 and 85 differently changed protein spots (DEPs) (corresponding to 87 and 80 unique proteins, respectively) in the leaves and the roots, respectively, with only 6 mutual unique proteins in the both organs. An impressive 86% of the DEPs were implicated in detoxification and defense, carbon metabolism, amino acid and nitrogen metabolism, proteins metabolism, chaperones, transcription and translation, photosynthesis, nucleotide metabolism, and signal transduction. Further analysis revealed some mutual and tissue-specific responses to short-term drought in the leaves and the roots. The differences of drought-response between the roots and the leaves mainly included that signal sensing and transduction-associated proteins were greatly up-regulated in the roots. Photosynthesis and carbon fixation ability were decreased in the leaves. Glycolysis was down-regulated but PPP pathway enhanced in the roots, resulting in occurrence of complex changes in energy metabolism and establishment of a new homeostasis. Protein metabolism was down-regulated in the roots, but enhanced in the leaves. These results will contribute to the existing knowledge on the complexity of root and leaf protein changes that occur in response to drought, and also provide a framework for further functional studies on the identified proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2040873252,"HLTF (helicase-like transcription factor) is a yeast RAD5 homolog found in mammals. HLTF has E3 ubiquitin ligase and DNA helicase activities, and plays a pivotal role in the template-switching pathway of DNA damage tolerance. HLTF has an N-terminal domain that has been designated the HIRAN (HIP116 and RAD5 N-terminal) domain. The HIRAN domain has been hypothesized to play a role in DNA binding; however, the structural basis of, and functional evidence for, the HIRAN domain in DNA binding has remained unclear. Here we show for the first time the crystal structure of the HIRAN domain of human HLTF in complex with DNA. The HIRAN domain is composed of six β-strands and two α-helices, forming an OB-fold structure frequently found in ssDNA-binding proteins, including in replication factor A (RPA). Interestingly, this study reveals that the HIRAN domain interacts with not only with a single-stranded DNA but also with a duplex DNA. Furthermore, the structure unexpectedly clarifies that the HIRAN domain specifically recognizes the 3′-end of DNA. These results suggest that the HIRAN domain functions as a sensor to the 3′-end of the primer strand at the stalled replication fork and that the domain facilitates fork regression. HLTF is recruited to a damaged site through the HIRAN domain at the stalled replication fork. Furthermore, our results have implications for the mechanism of template switching."
https://openalex.org/W2086032907,"The Yesso scallop Patinopecten yessoensis is an economically important marine bivalve species in aquaculture and fishery in Asian countries. However, limited genomic resources are available for this scallop, which hampers investigations into molecular mechanisms underlying their unique biological characteristics, such as shell formation and pigmentation. Mantle is the special tissue of P. yessoensis that secretes biomineralization proteins inducing shell deposition as well as pigmentation on the shells. However, a current deficiency of transcriptome information limits insight into mechanisms of shell formation and pigmentation in this species. In this study, the transcriptome of the mantle of P. yessoensis was deeply sequenced and characterized using Illumina RNA-seq technology. A total of 86,521 unique transcripts are assembled from 55,884,122 reads that passed quality filters, and annotated, using Gene Ontology classification. A total of 259 pathways are identified in the mantle transcriptome, including the calcium signaling and melanogenesis pathways. A total of 237 unigenes that are homologous to 102 reported biomineralization genes are identified, and 121 unigenes that are homologous to 93 known proteins related to melanin biosynthesis are found. Twenty-three annotated unigenes, which are mainly homologous to calmodulin and related proteins, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, adenylate/guanylate cyclase, and tyrosinase family are potentially involved in both biomineralization and melanin biosynthesis. It is suggested that these genes are probably not limited in function to induce shell deposition by calcium metabolism, but may also be involved in pigmentation of the shells of the scallop. This potentially supports the idea that there might be a link between calcium metabolism and melanin biosynthesis, which was previously found in vertebrates. The findings presented here will notably advance the understanding of the sophisticated processes of shell formation as well as shell pigmentation in P. yessoensis and other bivalve species, and also provide new evidence on gene expression for the understanding of pigmentation and biomineralization not only in invertebrates but also probably in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2051859841,"It is known that fluoride-resistant microorganisms are different from fluoride-sensitive ones in growth, adherence and metabolic activity. It was hypothesized that these phenotypic differences were due to stable genotypic changes in the fluoride-resistant strains. However, until now, no studies have reported these genotypic changes. The aim of this study is to identify such changes in a fluoride-resistant Streptococcus mutans strain (C180-2FR) using whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing and to examine the potential function of the identified mutations by comparing gene expression between the fluoride-sensitive (C180-2) and C180-2FR strains. We performed 50 bp paired-end Illumina shotgun sequencing for both strains. Through extensive bioinformatic analysis, we were able to identify 8 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genome of C180-2FR, which were further confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Expression of the genes containing or in proximity to the SNPs in C180-2 and C180-2FR was then quantified by real-time PCR. A gene cluster containing genes coding for fluoride antiporters was up-regulated 10-fold in C180-2FR when compared to that in C180-2, independent of growth phase. Two SNPs are located in this gene cluster, one in its promoter region and the other in its protein-coding region. In addition, one gene, which codes for a putative glycerol uptake facilitator protein, was found to be down-regulated by 60% in C180-2FR at an early growth phase. The promoter region of this gene contained a SNP. No difference in expression was found for the other SNP-containing genes. In summary, using WGS sequencing, we were able to uncover genetic changes in the genome of a fluoride-resistant strain. These findings can provide new insights into the mechanism of microbial fluoride resistance."

Studies of any population resident in India were included. Studies where outcomes were not yet available, not directly related to tobacco use, or not specific to India, were excluded. Pre-tested proformas were used for data extraction and quality assessment. Studies with reliability concerns were excluded from some aspects of analysis. The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) was use as a framework for synthesis. Heterogeneity limited meta-analysis options. Synthesis was therefore predominantly narrative.Additional to the Global Tobacco Surveillance System data, 80 studies were identified, 45 without reliability concerns. Most related to education (FCTC Article 12) and tobacco-use cessation (Article 14). They indicated widespread understanding of tobacco-related harm, but less knowledge about specific consequences of use. Healthcare professionals reported low confidence in cessation assistance, in keeping with low levels of training. Training for schoolteachers also appeared suboptimal. Educational and cessation assistance interventions demonstrated positive impact on tobacco use. Studies relating to smoke-free policies (Article 8), tobacco advertisements and availability (Articles 13 and 16) indicated increasingly widespread smoke-free policies, but persistence of high levels of SHS exposure, tobacco promotions and availability-including to minors. Data relating to taxation/pricing and packaging (Articles 6 and 11) were limited. We did not identify any studies of product regulation, alternative employment strategies, or illicit trade (Articles 9, 10, 15 and 17).Tobacco-use outcomes could be improved by school/community-based and adult education interventions, and cessation assistance, facilitated by training for health professionals and schoolteachers.

https://openalex.org/W2099343455,"Advances in neurotechnology will raise new ethical dilemmas, to which scientists and the rest of society must respond. Here I present a “toolbox” of concepts to help us analyze these issues and communicate with each other about them across differences of ethical intuition. Advances in neurotechnology will raise new ethical dilemmas, to which scientists and the rest of society must respond. Here I present a “toolbox” of concepts to help us analyze these issues and communicate with each other about them across differences of ethical intuition. It is a truism that science is a double-edged sword. 20th century atomic physics revolutionized our understanding of material world and gave us new forms of energy but also created the deadliest weapons of all time, which continue to threaten civilization. The 21st century’s most transformative science may well be neuroscience. We are living in a time of rapid progress, as neuroscientists gain new insights into the basic science of brain function and leverage them with a range of technologies from nanomaterials to machine learning. The articles in this issue of Neuron show the promise held by many of these methods for advancing basic science and treating neurological and psychiatric illness. In the midst of this rapid progress, how can we encourage the development of ethical technologies and applications? Of course we will not have complete control over the field’s development, and we will not even all agree on what constitutes an ethical use. Here I suggest that a constructive first step is to stock our ethics “toolbox.” These tools will help us recognize ethical issues, analyze them, and communicate with each other about them. The ethics toolbox presented here has two main compartments, for consequentialist and deontological tools. Consequentialism is the ethical framework most closely associated with philosophers Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, according to which an act can be judged right or wrong depending on the expected value of its outcomes. Talk of “risk-benefit ratios,” common in IRB (Internal Review Board) applications, is a use of consequentialist ethical reasoning. This weighing of expected value is such a natural and obvious way of approaching ethical decisions in science and technology that it may seem pedantic to give it an “ism” name and cite its 19th century roots. Indeed, I recall a bioethics meeting at which a Nobel laureate scientist impatiently asked, “What’s all this talk about? Just assess the benefits to patients against the risks and costs, and you’ll know the right thing to do.” But as this brilliant scientist came to appreciate, consequentialism alone does not fully accord with our ethical intuitions. For example, we would not be okay with sacrificing a healthy person to provide five lifesaving organ transplants, even though it seems right based on a simple calculation of aggregate benefits and costs. The other widely used approach, which captures our sense of the wrongness of using a human being as an involuntary organ donor, is deontology, often associated with the 18th philosopher Immanuel Kant. The name “deontology” comes from the Greek word for “duty,” and the approach determines what is ethical in relation to a set of moral principles that specify our duties and rights as persons. Our IRBs apply such principles as well as risk-benefit calculations. For example, even if risks are negligible and benefits are substantial, it would be a violation of a subject’s right to autonomy to be enrolled as a research subject without informed consent. Philosophers have attempted to reconcile the two approaches, for example, by considering the beneficial consequences of recognizing rights. This has never worked satisfactorily and so we are left with fundamentally different ethical systems. For many dilemmas the same decision is recommended regardless of which ethical system we use, but conflict can arise. Indeed, there are even cases in which different deontological principles conflict with one another or different ways of weighing consequences lead to different conclusions. What this means for the toolbox offered here is that it cannot be applied algorithmically to reach a determinate answer. What it can do is capture and highlight morally relevant considerations in a given situation, to make more explicit the grounds for various ethical positions and to facilitate discussion when disagreement occurs. Personhood. We all share an intuition that certain entities, including ourselves, are persons and hence have rights and duties, whereas others, including our furniture, are not and do not. These rights and duties are spelled out in the principles of deontological ethics. Many issues in bioethics have been analyzed in terms of personhood rights. For example, if a fetus is a person, then it has a right to life and abortion is wrong. What is a person? For Kant personhood was related to the cognitive wherewithal (or cognitive potential, for the immature) to think and act morally. Others have used broader criteria, such as rationality and self-consciousness, but bioethics still lacks explicit criteria that capture our intuitions about who or what is a person without being circular (Farah and Heberlein, 2007Farah M.J. Heberlein A.S. Am. J. Bioeth. 2007; 7: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Dignity. This concept was introduced into ethics by Kant as part of his explanation of how persons differ from objects. In Kant’s terms, objects have prices, such that one thing can be fairly replaced by another when the prices are equal. This is not true of persons; you would not entertain a trade for friends or family members regardless of the outstanding objective traits the proposed replacement has. Persons have what Kant called a “worth beyond value,” which he termed dignity. Recently, this term has been used in a related sense by socially conservative bioethicists (Pellegrino et al., 2009Pellegrino E.D. Schulman A. Merrill T.W. Human Dignity and Bioethics. University of Notre Dame Press, Notre Dame2009Google Scholar) to encompass a kind of deep appreciation of humanity in all its imperfection and has thus figured in arguments against neurotechnological enhancement of humans. Commodification. This concept refers to the extension of market value to parts of persons and their capabilities, including organs, reproductive capabilities, and cognitive capabilities. Rights. These are moral entitlements, “must-haves” rather than “nice-to-haves”; in the words of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, “inalienable” from persons. An example is the right to privacy. Beauchamp and Childress Principles of Bioethics. Bioethicists Thomas Beauchamp and James Childress crafted a set of specific principles to guide biomedical research and practice (Beauchamp and Childress, 2012Beauchamp T.L. Childress J.F. Principles of Biomedical Ethics.Seventh Edition. Oxford University Press, New York2012Google Scholar). They are: Respect for Autonomy, which emphasizes the right to control our own lives, Beneficence, which refers to the duty to help others, Nonmalfesience, the duty to “do no harm,” and Justice, which concerns broader duties to society, for example, promoting fairness and following the law. Other Commonly Invoked Principles. The toolbox has many special-purpose tools, in the form of ethical principles that capture ethical intuitions in very specific contexts. Among these are the wisdom of repugnance, natural is good, and the therapy-enhancement distinction, which will be explained as they become relevant later. The basic tools of consequentialism are fewer and simpler than deontology (see Holland, 2003Holland S. Bioethics, A Philosophical Introduction. Blackwell Publishing, Oxford2003Google Scholar, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2014Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (2014). The Metaphysics Research Lab, Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI), Stanford University, Zalta, E.N., ed. http://plato.stanford.edu/.Google Scholar to learn more about philosophical ethics and Farah, 2010Farah M.J. Neuroethics: An Introduction with Readings. MIT Press, Cambridge2010Google Scholar for an overview of the ethics of neuroscience). Here I will present a few concepts that are helpful in applying consequentialism to neurotechnology. Kinds of Consequences. In Bentham’s original hedonistic consequentialism, ethical actions are those that maximize everyone’s pleasure. Because this seems to make the nucleus accumbens the arbiter of too much, a common variant is preference or desire consequentialism, where we act to maximize fulfillment of our more considered preferences. Of course our preferences themselves might be mistaken, so other approaches have been considered, including perfectionist consequentialism, which tells us to maximize the perfection or full flourishing of human potential. Interests. These can be viewed as the consequentialist counterpart to rights, missing the obligatory nature of rights. They can be weighed relative to one another. Externalities. Economists coined this term, referring to the effects of actions by one party on others who are not directly involved. This broadens the range of possible consequences that must be considered. Sentience. To have interests, and thus figure in the consequentialist calculus, an entity must be sentient, that is, capable of experiencing perceptual and affective states. Humans are highly sentient, but at least some and perhaps all animals would also appear to be sentient. Human Subjects. A mix of consequentialist and deontological considerations guide our treatment of human subjects, including risk-benefit ratio and informed consent, the latter respecting subject autonomy. In research with neurological or neuropsychiatric patients, subjects may lack the competence needed for informed consent, and regulations then focus on protecting the person from harm, with nonmalfesience a particularly important principle. Animal Subjects. The ethics of animal research is generally understood in consequentialist terms. Animals are viewed as sentient and we therefore strive to protect their interests as much as possible while accomplishing worthy research. The 3Rs of humane animal research (Russell and Burch, 1959Russell W.M.S. Burch R.L. The Principles of Humane Experimental Technique. Methuen, London1959Google Scholar) are a consequentialist amelioration of the ethical downside of animal research, based on a quantitative approach to degrees of goodness and badness. Animal research in neuroscience may be more ethically freighted than other fields, at least for modeling disorders of emotion and pain. Also relevant to the consequentialist calculation on the benefits side, the validity and usefulness of some animal models have been questioned (Nestler and Hyman, 2010Nestler E.J. Hyman S.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1161-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). The idea of personhood and rights for some animals is an idea with some adherents (e.g., Regan, 1983Regan T. The Case for Animal Rights. University of California Press, Berkeley1983Google Scholar). Fetal and Embryonic Stem Cells. Those in favor of human fetal and embryonic stem cell research typically offer consequentialist arguments about the promise of these methods for curing disease. A deontological ethical analysis will depend mainly on whether fetuses and embryos are considered persons. If they are persons, then they have a right to life. Even if their fate would otherwise be the medical waste container, one would be commodifying them, or the reproductive functions of the parents, by using them. Although this is not my personal view, I think it is worth seeing that these objections arise from an approach to ethics that most of us have some sympathy for, even if we ultimately come down on the side of pursuing helpful new therapies. Humanized Animals. Human genes and cells can be introduced into animal brains to create human disease models. Psychological changes can likely be induced by humanization; after all, behaviors can be transferred across nonhuman species (Balaban, 2005Balaban E. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2005; 49: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Given how little we know about the likely psychology of nonhuman animals that have been humanized, it may be challenging to assess their levels of comfort, suffering, or frustration. This makes consequentialist analyses difficult to carry out. The primary deontological issue is which side of the person/nonperson line humanized animals are on. Sufficiently humanized primates might acquire mental capacities associated with highly developed sentience or even personhood (Greene et al., 2005Greene M. Schill K. Takahashi S. Bateman-House A. Beauchamp T. Bok H. Cheney D. Coyle J. Deacon T. Dennett D. et al.Science. 2005; 309: 385-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Repugnance is one motivator of ethical discussion of humanized animals, spurring us to question or, some might wish, limit the use of these methods. Brains in Dishes. Human neurons have been cultured in substrates that allow them to grow and connect in three dimensions, enabling the clumps of tissue to self-organize in surprisingly complex ways (Lancaster et al., 2013Lancaster M.A. Renner M. Martin C.A. Wenzel D. Bicknell L.S. Hurles M.E. Homfray T. Penninger J.M. Jackson A.P. Knoblich J.A. Nature. 2013; 501: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar). How these organoids develop and what functions they might eventually display have yet to be fully grasped. They are mentioned here as a reminder of the rapidly changing nature of neuroscience research, and the possibility that radically new ethical challenges could arise in the future. We can be confident that current cerebral organoids are tissue rather than brains, let alone animals, humans, or persons. One would not attribute interests, let alone rights, to them. But if they become larger and more organized, is there a point at which that might change? Repugnance, whether “wise” or not, may give us pause about the development of such entities and invites further analysis. Tissue grafting, brain computer interfaces with external or implanted components, deep brain stimulation, and noninvasive brain stimulation are all in clinical use or clinical trials. Some of the ethical issues they raise are familiar from other biomedical technologies, but others relate more specifically to the novel ways in which the technologies affect the brain and call for new ethical analyses. One such issue concerns privacy. The bioethics of privacy has traditionally concerned medical records. A novel issue that arises with brain-computer interfaces is the possibility of unauthorized access to patients’ mental processes, inferred from their neural activity. This concern does not assume a quantum jump in brain decoding ability. Even existing technologies can derive psychological information from continuously recorded brain activity when correlated to situational factors. For example, brain activity while watching the evening news could be analyzed for a patient’s responses to content associated with different political ideologies, personality traits, and all manner of other traits and states. Our communications, shopping habits, and other behaviors have already become more visible to others; our minds may also become more transparent in an era of devices that continuously read out brain activity. The autonomy of persons may also face new challenges from neurotechnology. DARPA’s RAM and SUBNETS programs (Ling, 2013Ling G. Science. 2013; 342: 1029-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) indicate that the prospect of control over cognitive and emotional processes is not mere science fiction. Whether by hackers or Big Brother, delivery of stimulation to the brain has the potential to manipulate thought, feeling, and behavior. The ethical analysis of clinical neurotechnology has similar outcomes whether approached with the tools of deontology, as above, or consequentialism. Focusing on consequences, it is clear that hijacking BCI and DBS systems could have extremely harmful consequences. Other applications of neurotechnology are nonmedical, aimed at enhancing quality of life or achievement in healthy individuals. As neurotechnologies are adopted more widely for therapeutic use, nontherapeutic uses will probably follow, just as they have for other medical therapies from plastic surgery to psychopharmacology. Indeed, noninvasive brain stimulation is already used by some with the goal of enhancing mood, concentration, and gaming skills (Miller, 2014Miller, G. (2014). Inside the strange new world of DIY brain stimulation. Wired, http://www.wired.com/2014/05/diy-brain-stimulation/.Google Scholar). It is worth noting that some of the neurotechnologies discussed here may prove more effective than the pharmacologic methods of cognitive enhancement currently in use, for example, the use of prescription stimulants by college students to increase attention (Smith and Farah, 2011Smith M.E. Farah M.J. Psychol. Bull. 2011; 137: 717-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Compared to the broad modulatory effects of most neuropsychiatric drugs, precisely targeted stimulation or augmentation by sensory, motor, and computational devices have the potential to more radically enhance human capabilities. It will be years, if not decades, before we know the impact of these technologies on healthy individuals and on society, but beginning an ethical analysis now will help us guide their development. Enhancement has been regarded as ethically dubious by those who believe that natural is good. One problem with this principle is that many natural things are plainly bad—for example, diseases—and we have no objections to intervening technologically in such cases. If we try to place reasonable limits on this principle, accepting the natural as an ideal to be surrendered only in case of medical need, we invoke another principle, namely that illness and health are distinct states and thus therapy and enhancement are also distinct. Conflicting with this are the many medical conditions that occur on a continuum with good health, such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes. If there is no objective therapy-enhancement distinction, then we cannot use it to determine which uses of neurotechnology are therapeutically justified and which are not. There are more fundamental ways in which neurotechnological enhancement grates against a deontological understanding of ethics. When we improve our psychological function by brain intervention, it is much like improving our car’s performance by making adjustments under the hood. In both cases, the goal is to improve function, and to the extent that we succeed without introducing problematic side effects, we may view the consequences as good. But in so doing, we are treating a person—our self in the case of voluntary brain enhancement—as an object. Rather than improving our abilities through the exercise of our own agency, by effortful practice and the like, we are short-circuiting that agency and hence, the argument goes, diminishing our personhood. In the words of the President’s Council on Bioethics, 2003President’s Council on Bioethics (2003). Beyond Therapy: Biotechnology and the Pursuit of Happiness, https://bioethicsarchive.georgetown.edu/pcbe/reports/beyondtherapy/index.html.Google Scholar under George W. Bush, “Personal achievements impersonally achieved are not truly the achievements of persons … [the problem] lies not in the fact that the assisting drugs and devices are artifacts, but in the danger of violating or deforming the nature of human agency and the dignity of the naturally human way of activity.” A related point is that a focus on improved mental function commodifies human abilities. A concern with justice calls attention to the likelihood that the benefits of brain enhancement will be enjoyed by the already privileged, a failure of distributive justice. But managed appropriately, enhancement could lessen the inequalities of genes and upbringing that gave some of us sharper eyes, higher IQs, and happier temperaments than others (Dunlop and Savulescu, 2014Dunlop M. Savulescu J. Monash Bioeth. Rev. 2014; 32: 189-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). From a consequentialist viewpoint, the ethics of enhancement might seem simple. In the words of John Harris, “If it were not good for you it would not be an enhancement” (Harris, 2007Harris J. Enhancing Evolution: The Ethical Case for Making Better People. Princeton University Press, Princeton2007Google Scholar). Julian Savelescu unpacks this a bit further and reminds us that some enhancements might be better than others: “Enhancement can be defined as something which makes our lives better … What makes a good life is subject to discussion; hedonists believe it is the pursuit of pleasure, others believe that it is found in desire fulfillment and others in the perfection of well-being … Enhancement can help achieve the good life by providing … qualities that increase the chances of us having a good life, such as health or intelligence” (Savelescu, 2009Savelescu J. Enhancement and fairness.in: Healey P. Rayner S. Unnatural Selection: The Challenges of Engineering Tomorrow’s People. Earthscan, Abingdon2009: 177-187Google Scholar). The consequentialist calculus includes negative as well as positive consequences. In addition to the possible health risks of brain enhancement there could be neural tradeoffs whereby the enhancement of one ability comes at the cost of another (e.g., Iuculano and Cohen Kadosh, 2013Iuculano T. Cohen Kadosh R. J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 4482-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). There may also be externalities of the choice to enhance. Widespread enhancement at school or work will redefine “normal.” Unenhanced workers who were once among the best performing will slip in their relative standing and what the boss expects from employees will be ratcheted up by each new enhancement that comes along. This creates pressure to enhance, which seems a clear negative consequence. Thus, consequentialism does not give generic support to the morality of enhancement; it will do its work case by case on the basis of the consequences. Carried to extremes, the brain enhancements of the distant future may result in beings so different from us that one would call them “transhuman.” There is no guarantee that continued enhancement will lead us all the way to transhumanism, but likewise there is no reason to assume it will not. Philosopher Nick Bostrom offers a primarily consequentialist argument for embracing transhumanism, emphasizing “the enormous potential for genuine improvements in human well-being and human flourishing that are attainable only via technological transformation” (Bostrom, 2005Bostrom N. Journal of Evolution and Technology. 2005; 14: 1-25Google Scholar). Others see negative consequences, including the possibility that humans like us may not fare well in a world with transhumans; we may be viewed as inferior life forms, much as we now regard chimpanzees, and treated accordingly (Warwick, 2003Warwick K. Ethics Inf. Technol. 2003; 5: 131-137Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This was echoed, in consequentialist and deontological terms, by political scientist Francis Fukuyama in nominating transhumanism as “the world’s most dangerous idea”: “If we start transforming ourselves into something superior, what rights will these enhanced creatures claim, and what rights will they possess when compared to those left behind?” (Fukuyama, 2004Fukuyama, F. (2004). Transhumanism. Foreign Policy, 144, pp. 42–43. http://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2004/09/01/transhumanism.Google Scholar). Brain-computer interfaces and dignity may seem like the proverbial fish and bicycle—the latter has nothing to offer the former. But consider the new ethical dilemmas that will accompany neurotechnological developments, and the need for scientists, clinicians and the rest of society to respond. The concepts of philosophical ethics are tools for bringing these issues into sharper focus, analyzing them according to more general and familiar considerations and communicating about them across differences of ethical intuition."
https://openalex.org/W2061534557,"Sour taste is detected by taste receptor cells that respond to acids through yet poorly understood mechanisms. The cells that detect sour express the protein PKD2L1, which is not the sour receptor but nonetheless serves as a useful marker for sour cells. By use of mice in which the PKD2L1 promoter drives expression of yellow fluorescent protein, we previously reported that sour taste cells from circumvallate papillae in the posterior tongue express a proton current. To establish a correlation between this current and sour transduction, we examined its distribution by patch-clamp recording. We find that the current is present in PKD2L1-expressing taste cells from mouse circumvallate, foliate, and fungiform papillae but not in a variety of other cells, including spinal cord neurons that express PKD2L1. We describe biophysical properties of the current, including pH-dependent Zn2+ inhibition, lack of voltage-dependent gating, and activation at modest pH values (6.5) that elicit action potentials in isolated cells. Consistent with a channel that is constitutively open, the cytosol of sour taste cells is acidified. These data define a functional signature for the taste cell proton current and indicate that its expression is mostly restricted to the subset of taste cells that detect sour.—Bushman, J.

https://openalex.org/W2090299571,"Ledipasvir, a direct acting antiviral agent (DAA) targeting the Hepatitis C Virus NS5A protein, exhibits picomolar activity in replicon cells. While its mechanism of action is unclear, mutations that confer resistance to ledipasvir in HCV replicon cells are located in NS5A, suggesting that NS5A is the direct target of ledipasvir. To date co-precipitation and cross-linking experiments in replicon or NS5A transfected cells have not conclusively shown a direct, specific interaction between NS5A and ledipasvir. Using recombinant, full length NS5A, we show that ledipasvir binds directly, with high affinity and specificity, to NS5A. Ledipasvir binding to recombinant NS5A is saturable with a dissociation constant in the low nanomolar range. A mutant form of NS5A (Y93H) that confers resistance to ledipasvir shows diminished binding to ledipasvir. The current study shows that ledipasvir inhibits NS5A through direct binding and that resistance to ledipasvir is the result of a reduction in binding affinity to NS5A mutants."
https://openalex.org/W2011068991,"Background Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) have been recognised as pathogens that cause a broad spectrum of diseases. The studies on HAdV infection among children with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) are limited. Objective To investigate the prevalence, epidemiology, and genotype of HAdV among children with SARI in China. Study Design Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) or induced sputum (IS) was collected from hospitalised children with SARIs in Beijing (representing Northern China; n = 259) and Zhejiang Province (representing Eastern China; n = 293) from 2007 to 2010. The prevalence of HAdV was screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by sequence typing of PCR fragments that targeted the second half of the hexon gene. In addition, co-infection with other human respiratory viruses, related epidemiological profiles and clinical presentations were investigated. Results and Conclusions In total, 76 (13.8%) of 552 SARI patients were positive for HAdV, and the infection rates of HAdV in Northern and Eastern China were 20.1% (n = 52) and 8.2% (n = 24), respectively. HAdV co-infection with other respiratory viruses was frequent (infection rates: Northern China, 90.4%; Eastern China, 70.8%). The peak seasons for HAdV-B infection was winter and spring. Additionally, members of multiple species (Human mastadenovirus B, C, D and E) were circulating among paediatric patients with SARI, of which HAdV-B (34/52; 65.4%) and HAdV-C (20/24, 83.3%) were the most predominant in Northern and Eastern China, respectively. These findings provide a benchmark for future epidemiology and prevention strategies for HAdV."
https://openalex.org/W2039591635,"Background As a marker for tumor cell proliferation, Ki67 has important impacts on breast cancer (BC) prognosis. Although immunohistochemical staining is the current standard method, variations in analytical practice make it difficult for pathologists to manually measure Ki67 index. This study was to develop a fluorescent spectrum-based quantitative analysis of Ki67 expression by quantum-dots (QDs) multiple imaging technique. Methods A QDs-based in situ multiple fluorescent imaging method was developed, which stained nuclear Ki67 as red signal and cytoplasmic cytokeratin (CK) as green signal. Both Ki67 and CK signals were automatically separated and quantified by professional spectrum analysis software. This technique was applied to tissue microarrays from 240 BC patients. Both Ki67 and CK values, and Ki67/CK ratio were obtained for each patient, and their prognostic value on 5-year disease free survival was assessed. Results This method simultaneously stains nuclear Ki67 and cytoplasmic CK with clear signal contrast, making it easy for signal separation and quantification. The total fluorescent signal intensities of both Ki67 sum and CK sum were obtained, and Ki67/CK ratio calculated. Ki67 sum and Ki67/CK ratio were each attributed into two grades by X-tile software based on the best P value principle. Multivariate analysis showed Ki67 grade (P = 0.047) and Ki67/CK grade (P = 0.004) were independent prognostic factors. Furthermore, area under curve (AUC) of ROC analysis for Ki67/CK grade (AUC: 0.683, 95%CI: 0.613–0.752) was higher than Ki67 grade (AUC: 0.665, 95%CI: 0.596–0.734) and HER-2 gene (AUC: 0.586, 95%CI: 0.510–0.661), but lower than N stage (AUC: 0.760, 95%CI: 0.696–0.823) and histological grade (AUC: 0.756, 95%CI: 0.692–0.820) on predicting the risk for recurrence. Conclusions A QDs-based quantitative and in situ multiple imaging on Ki67 and CK was developed to improve Ki67 assessment in BC, and Ki67/CK grade had better performance than Ki67 grade in predicting prognosis."

Logistic regression was used to evaluate alcohol consumption and pancreatic cancer risk; data was also stratified by sex and smoking status to assess interaction.Alcohol consumption was not associated with pancreatic cancer risk (age-adjusted odds ratio=0.78, 95% CI: 0.58, 1.05 for 1 - 3 drinks/week; age-adjusted odds ratio=0.86, 95% CI: 0.63, 1.17 for 4 - 20 drinks/week), however there was a non-significant increased risk for heavy drinkers consuming ≥ 21 drinks/week (age-adjusted odds ratio=1.35, 95% CI: 0.81, 2.27). Cigarette smoking modified the alcohol-cancer relationship; among current smokers, heavy alcohol consumption was associated with a significantly increased pancreatic cancer risk (age-adjusted odds ratio=4.04, 95% CI: 1.58, 10.37), whereas this significant association with heavy drinking was not observed among non-smokers (age-adjusted odds ratio=2.01, 95% CI: 0.50, 8.18). Furthermore, light - moderate alcohol intake was associated with increased pancreas cancer risk among current smokers.While alcohol was not significantly associated with pancreatic cancer risk, smoking status modified this relationship such that among current smokers, alcohol intake was associated with a greater than two-fold increased risk of pancreatic cancer. The results should be interpreted with caution due to small sample sizes within subgroups and correction for multiple comparisons should be considered. These findings should be replicated in larger studies where more precise estimates of risk can be obtained."
https://openalex.org/W2077928705,"Body movement influences the structure of multiple forms of ambient energy, including optics and gravito-inertial force. Some researchers have argued that egocentric distance is derived from inferential integration of visual and non-visual stimulation. We suggest that accurate information about egocentric distance exists in perceptual stimulation as higher-order patterns that extend across optics and inertia. We formalize a pattern that specifies the egocentric distance of a stationary object across higher-order relations between optics and inertia. This higher-order parameter is created by self-generated movement of the perceiver in inertial space relative to the illuminated environment. For this reason, we placed minimal restrictions on the exploratory movements of our participants. We asked whether humans can detect and use the information available in this higher-order pattern. Participants judged whether a virtual object was within reach. We manipulated relations between body movement and the ambient structure of optics and inertia. Judgments were precise and accurate when the higher-order optical-inertial parameter was available. When only optic flow was available, judgments were poor. Our results reveal that participants perceived egocentric distance from the higher-order, optical-inertial consequences of their own exploratory activity. Analysis of participants’ movement trajectories revealed that self-selected movements were complex, and tended to optimize availability of the optical-inertial pattern that specifies egocentric distance. We argue that accurate information about egocentric distance exists in higher-order patterns of ambient energy, that self-generated movement can generate these higher-order patterns, and that these patterns can be detected and used to support perception of egocentric distance that is precise and accurate."
https://openalex.org/W2019222382,"Although several site-speciﬁc nucleases (SSNs), such as zinc-ﬁnger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas, have emerged as powerful tools for targeted gene editing in many organisms, to date, gene targeting (GT) in plants remains a formidable challenge. In the present study, we attempted to substitute a single base in situ on the rice OsEPSPS gene by co-transformation of TALEN with chimeric RNA/DNA oligonucleotides (COs), including different strand composition such as RNA/DNA (C1) or DNA/RNA (C2) but contained the same target base to be substituted. In contrast to zero GT event obtained by the co-transformation of TALEN with homologous recombination plasmid (HRP), we obtained one mutant showing target base substitution although accompanied by undesired deletion of 12 bases downstream the target site from the co-transformation of TALEN and C1. In addition to this typical event, we also obtained 16 mutants with different length of base deletions around the target site among 105 calli lines derived from transformation of TALEN alone (4/19) as well as co-transformation of TELAN with either HRP (5/30) or C1 (2/25) or C2 (5/31). Further analysis demonstrated that the homozygous gene-edited mutants without foreign gene insertion could be obtained in one generation. The induced mutations in transgenic generation were also capable to pass to the next generation stably. However, the genotypes of mutants did not segregate normally in T1 population, probably due to lethal mutations. Phenotypic assessments in T1 generation showed that the heterozygous plants with either one or three bases deletion on target sequence, called d1 and d3, were more sensitive to glyphosate and the heterozygous d1 plants had significantly lower seed-setting rate than wild-type."

However, owing to the difficulties of access, little is known about the properties of epiphyte-host tree communities and the factors structuring them, especially in Asia. We investigated factors structuring the vascular epiphyte-host community and its network properties in a tropical montane forest in Xishuangbanna, SW China. Vascular epiphytes were surveyed in six plots located in mature forests. Six host and four micro-site environmental factors were investigated. Epiphyte diversity was strongly correlated with host size (DBH, diameter at breast height), while within hosts the highest epiphyte diversity was in the middle canopy and epiphyte diversity was significantly higher in sites with canopy soil or a moss mat than on bare bark. DBH, elevation and stem height explained 22% of the total variation in the epiphyte species assemblage among hosts, and DBH was the most important factor which alone explained 6% of the variation. Within hosts, 51% of the variation in epiphyte assemblage composition was explained by canopy position and substrate, and the most important single factor was substrate which accounted for 16% of the variation. Analysis of network properties indicated that the epiphyte host community was highly nested, with a low level of epiphyte specialization, and an almost even interaction strength between epiphytes and host trees. Together, these results indicate that large trees harbor a substantial proportion of the epiphyte community in this forest."

We use mitochondrial genes to discriminate among the previously known and a newly discovered species and to assess the connectivity among populations of the same species in the northern Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Our results generally validate the morphologically based distribution of the three previously known GoM species of Bathymodiolus, although we found that approximately 10% of the morphologically based identifications were incorrect and this resulted in some inaccuracies with respect to their previously assigned depth and geographical distribution patterns. These data allowed us to confirm that sympatry of two species of Bathymodiolus within a single patch of mussels is common. A new species of bathymodiolin, Bathymodiolus sp. nov., closely related to B. heckerae was also discovered. The two species live at the same depths but have not been found in sympatry and both have small effective population sizes. We found evidence for genetic structure within populations of the three species of Bathymodiolinae for which we had samples from multiple sites and suggest limited connectivity for populations at some sites. Despite relatively small sample sizes, genetic diversity indices suggest the largest population sizes for B. childressi and Tamu fisheri and the smallest for B. heckerae and B. sp. nov. among the GoM bathymodiolins. Moreover, we detected an excess of rare variants indicating recent demographic changes and population expansions for the four species of bathymodiolins from the Gulf of Mexico."

https://openalex.org/W2041595354,"Rationale Recent work in preclinical models suggests that signalling via the pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory cytokine, CXCL12 (SDF-1), plays an important pathogenic role in pulmonary hypertension (PH). The objective of this study was to establish whether circulating concentrations of CXCL12α were elevated in patients with PAH and related to mortality. Methods Plasma samples were collected from patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) and PAH associated with connective tissue diseases (CTD-PAH) attending two pulmonary hypertension referral centres (n = 95) and from age and gender matched healthy controls (n = 44). Patients were subsequently monitored throughout a period of five years. Results CXCL12α concentrations were elevated in PAH groups compared to controls (P<0.05) and receiver-operating-characteristic analysis showed that plasma CXCL12α concentrations discriminated patients from healthy controls (AUC 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.73-0.88). Kaplan Meier analysis indicated that elevated plasma CXCL12α concentration was associated with reduced survival (P<0.01). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model showed that elevated CXCL12α independently predicted (P<0.05) earlier death in PAH with a hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of 2.25 (1.01-5.00). In the largest subset by WHO functional class (Class 3, 65% of patients) elevated CXCL12α independently predicted (P<0.05) earlier death, hazard ratio 2.27 (1.05-4.89). Conclusions Our data show that elevated concentrations of circulating CXCL12α in PAH predicted poorer survival. Furthermore, elevated circulating CXCL12α was an independent risk factor for death that could potentially be included in a prognostic model and guide therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2045342379,"Recent evidence supports a role of microRNAs in cancer and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, through their regulatory role on the expression of multiple genes. The rather rare co-morbidity of cancer and schizophrenia is an old hypothesis which needs further research on microRNAs as molecules that might exert their oncosuppressive or oncogenic activity in the context of their role in psychiatric disorders. The expression pattern of a variety of different microRNAs was investigated in patients (N = 6) suffering from schizophrenia termed control, patients with a solid tumor (N = 10) and patients with both schizophrenia and tumor (N = 8). miRNA profiling was performed on whole blood samples using the miRCURY LNA microRNA Array technology (6th & 7th generation). A subset of 3 microRNAs showed a statistically significant differential expression between the control and the study groups. Specifically, significant down-regulation of the let-7p-5p, miR-98-5p and of miR-183-5p in the study groups (tumor alone and tumorand schizophrenia) was observed (p<0.05). The results of the present study showed that let-7, miR-98 and miR-183 may play an important oncosuppressive role through their regulatory impact in gene expression irrespective of the presence of schizophrenia, although a larger sample size is required to validate these results. Nevertheless, further studies are warranted in order to highlight a possible role of these and other micro-RNAs in the molecular pathways of schizophrenia."

https://openalex.org/W2042331443,"The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a non-invasive tool for the monitoring of gene therapy for muscular dystrophy. The clinical investigations for this family of diseases often involve surgical biopsy which limits the amount of information that can be obtained due to the invasive nature of the procedure. Thus, other non-invasive tools may provide more opportunities for disease assessment and treatment responses. In order to explore this, dystrophic mdx4cv mice were systemically treated with a recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector containing a codon-optimized micro-dystrophin gene. Multi-parametric MRI of T2, magnetization transfer, and diffusion effects alongside 3-D volume measurements were then utilized to monitor disease/treatment progression. Mice were imaged at 10 weeks of age for pre-treatment, then again post-treatment at 8, 16, and 24 week time points. The efficacy of treatment was assessed by physiological assays for improvements in function and quantification of expression. Tissues from the hindlimbs were collected for histological analysis after the final time point for comparison with MRI results. We found that introduction of the micro-dystrophin gene restored some aspects of normal muscle histology and pathology such as decreased necrosis and resistance to contraction-induced injury. T2 relaxation values showed percentage decreases across all muscle types measured (tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and soleus) when treated groups were compared to untreated groups. Additionally, the differences between groups were statistically significant for the tibialis anterior as well. The diffusion measurements showed a wider range of percentage changes and less statistical significance while the magnetization transfer effect measurements showed minimal change. MR images displayed hyper-intense regions of muscle that correlated with muscle pathology in histological sections. T2 relaxation, alongside diffusion and magnetization transfer effects provides useful data towards the goal of non-invasively monitoring the treatment of muscular dystrophy."
https://openalex.org/W1976852960,"Introduction and Aims The ASK1-JNK3 signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The specific binding of β-arrestin2 to JNK3 is essential for activation of the ASK1-JNK3 cascade, representing a potential therapeutic target for preventing dopaminergic neuronal death in PD. The aim of this study was to identify a novel strategy for the prevention of dopaminergic neuronal death in PD. Methods Based on the specific binding of β-arrestin2 to JNK3, a 21-amino-acid fusion peptide, termed JNK3-N-Tat, was synthesized. We evaluated the ability of this peptide to inhibit the binding of β-arrestin2 to its target domain in JNK3 in vitro and in vivo. Results The JNK3-N-Tat peptide inhibited activation of the ASK1-JNK3 cascade by disrupting the interaction between β-arrestin2 and JNK3. JNK3-N-Tat exerted beneficial effects through pathways downstream of JNK3 and improved mitochondrial function, resulting in attenuated MPP+/MPTP-induced damage. JNK3-N-Tat protected mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons against MPTP-induced toxicity. Conclusions JNK3-N-Tat, a JNK3-inhibitory peptide, protects dopaminergic neurons against MPP+/MPTP-induced injury by inhibiting the ASK1-JNK3 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1983914631,"Upon obesity, adipose tissue is excessively expanded and characterized by pathologic processes like hypoxia, fibrosis, and inflammation. Death ligands belonging to the TNF superfamily such as TNF-α are important contributors to these derangements and exert a pronounced influence on the metabolic and cellular homeostasis of adipose tissue. Here, we sought to identify the effect of the death ligand TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) on the adipose tissue precursor cell pool and therefore investigated its influence on preadipocyte proliferation. Treatment of human preadipocytes with TRAIL resulted in a time- and dose-dependent increase in proliferation (EC50 3.4 ng/ml) comparable to IGF-1. Although no apoptosis was observed, TRAIL triggered a rapid cleavage of caspase-8 and -3. Neither inhibition of caspase activity by zVAD.fmk (20 μM) nor ablation of caspase-8 expression by lentivirus-delivered small hairpin RNA (shRNA) abolished the proliferative response. TRAIL triggered a delayed and sustained activation of ERK1/2, leaving Akt, p38, JNK, and NF-κB unaffected. Importantly, inhibition of ERK1/2 activation by PD0325901 (300 nM) or AZD6244 (5 or 10 μM) completely abolished the proliferative response. We thus reveal a hitherto unknown function of TRAIL in regulating adipose tissue homeostasis by promoting the proliferation of tissue-resident precursor cells.—Funcke, J.-B., Zoller, V., Abd El Hay, M., Debatin, K.-M., Wabitsch, M., Fischer-Posovszky, P.

https://openalex.org/W2063706136,"Currently, there are no generally applicable noninvasive methods for defining the relationship between atherosclerotic vascular damage and risk of focal thrombosis. Herein, we demonstrate methods to delineate the progression and regression of vascular damage in response to an atherogenic diet by quantifying the in vivo accumulation of semipermeable 200-300 nm per-fluorocarbon core nanoparticles (PFC-NP) in ApoE null mouse plaques with [19F] magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Permeability to PFC-NP remained minimal until 12 weeks on diet, then increased rapidly following 12 weeks, but regressed to baseline within 8 weeks after diet normalization. Markedly accelerated clotting (53.3% decrease in clotting time) was observed in carotid artery preparations of fat-fed mice subjected to photochemical injury as defined by the time to flow cessation. For all mice on and off diet, an inverse linear relationship was observed between the permeability to PFC-NP and accelerated thrombosis (P = 0.02). Translational feasibility for quantifying plaque permeability and vascular damage in vivo was demonstrated with clinical 3 T MRI of PFC-NP accumulating in plaques of atherosclerotic rabbits. These observations suggest that excessive permeability to PFC-NP may indicate prothrombotic risk in damaged atherosclerotic vasculature, which resolves within weeks after dietary therapy.—Palekar, R.

https://openalex.org/W1974016721,"Background Short-term morbidity and mortality rates for HIV positive soldiers in the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) would inform decisions about deployment and HIV disease management. Risks were determined according to the latest CD4+ cell count and use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV positive individuals in the SANDF and their dependents. Methods and Findings A total of 7,114 participants were enrolled and followed for mortality over a median of 4.7 years (IQR: 1.9, 7.1 years). For a planned subset (5,976), progression of disease (POD) and grade 4, potentially life-threatening events were also ascertained. CD4+ count and viral load were measured every 3 to 6 months. Poisson regression was used to compare event rates by latest CD4+ count (<50, 50–99, 100–199, 200–349, 350–499, 500+) with a focus on upper three strata, and to estimate relative risks (RRs) (ART/no ART). Median entry CD4+ was 207 cells/mm3. During follow-up over 70% were prescribed ART. Over follow-up 1,226 participants died; rates ranged from 57.6 (< 50 cells) to 0.8 (500+ cells) per 100 person years (py). Compared to those with latest CD4+ 200–349 (2.2/100py), death rates were significantly lower (p<0.001), as expected, for those with 350–499 (0.9/100py) and with 500+ cells (0.8/100py). The composite outcome of death, POD or grade 4 events occurred in 2,302 participants (4,045 events); rates were similar in higher CD4+ count strata (9.4 for 350–499 and 7.9 for 500+ cells) and lower than those with counts 200–349 cells (13.5) (p<0.001). For those with latest CD4+ 350+ cells, 63% of the composite outcomes (680 of 1,074) were grade 4 events. Conclusion Rates of morbidity and mortality are lowest among those with CD4+ count of 350 or higher and rates do not differ for those with counts of 350–499 versus 500+ cells. Grade 4 events are the predominant morbidity for participants with CD4+ counts of 350+ cells."
https://openalex.org/W2015920307,"Excessive activation of gelatinases (MMP-2/-9) is a key cause of detrimental outcomes in neurodegenerative diseases. A single-dimension zymography has been widely used to determine gelatinase expression and activity, but this method is inadequate in resolving complex enzyme isoforms, because gelatinase expression and activity could be modified at transcriptional and posttranslational levels. In this study, we investigated gelatinase isoforms under in vitro and in vivo conditions using two-dimensional (2D) gelatin zymography electrophoresis, a protocol allowing separation of proteins based on isoelectric points (pI) and molecular weights. We observed organomercuric chemical 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate-induced activation of MMP-2 isoforms with variant pI values in the conditioned medium of human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells. Studies with murine BV-2 microglial cells indicated a series of proform MMP-9 spots separated by variant pI values due to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The MMP-9 pI values were shifted after treatment with alkaline phosphatase, suggesting presence of phosphorylated isoforms due to the proinflammatory stimulation. Similar MMP-9 isoforms with variant pI values in the same molecular weight were also found in mouse brains after ischemic and traumatic brain injuries. In contrast, there was no detectable pI differentiation of MMP-9 in the brains of chronic Zucker obese rats. These results demonstrated effective use of 2D zymography to separate modified MMP isoforms with variant pI values and to detect posttranslational modifications under different pathological conditions."

In this study, we identified LTV1 as a novel cell growth regulator in Drosophila. LTV1 mutant larvae exhibited developmental delays and lethality at the second larval stage. Using biochemical studies, we discovered that LTV1 interacted with ribosomal protein S3 and co-purified with free 40S ribosome subunits. We further demonstrated that LTV1 is crucial for ribosome biogenesis through 40S ribosome subunit synthesis and preribosomal RNA processing, suggesting that LTV1 is required for cell growth by regulating protein synthesis.

Cell growth is coordinated with cell differentiation and apoptosis in animal development. To control cell growth precisely, proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors are tightly regulated by developmental cues and environmental changes. To understand the molecular mechanism of cell growth, novel cell growth regulators should be identified, and their in vivo functions should be demonstrated in animal models. Although multiple cell growth regulators have been discovered and investigated (1Hariharan I.K. Bilder D. Regulation of imaginal disc growth by tumor-suppressor genes in Drosophila.Annu. Rev.

Cancer. 2003; 3: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). The ribosome is generated through coordinated multiple processes occurring in the nucleolus, nucleoplasm, and cytosol (4Tschochner H. Hurt E.

Hurt E. Pre-ribosomes on the road from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm.Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 255-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The 35S pre-rRNA, the longest precursor, contains 18S, 5.8S, and 25S mature rRNAs that are separated by internal transcribed spacers (ITSs) and flanked by external transcribed spacers. These extra spacer sequences are sequentially removed by endo- and exonucleases to make mature rRNAs (7Henras A.K. Soudet J. Gérus M. Lebaron S. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Mougin A. Henry Y. The post-transcriptional steps of eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 2334-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). In the nucleolus, an internal cleavage of ITS in pre-rRNA separates pre-90S ribosomes into pre-40S and -60S ribosome subunits. Both of these precursor ribosome subunits in the nucleus are exported to the cytosol in a Crm1-Ran GTPase-dependent manner (8Zemp I. Kutay U.

There are ∼200 non-ribosomal proteins that associate and dissociate dynamically with preribosomes during ribosome biogenesis (10Karbstein K. Inside the 40S ribosome assembly machinery.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2011; 15: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These proteins have indispensable roles in ribosome biogenesis by assisting pre-rRNA processing and modifications, ribosomal protein folding and association, etc. For the synthesis of fully matured 40S ribosome subunits, multiple non-ribosomal proteins, such as Rio2p, Tsr1p, Ltv1p, Enp1p, Nob1p, Hrr25p, Dim1p, and Dim2p, interact with pre-40S ribosome subunits (11Schäfer T.

They have various protein domains such as methyltransferase, protein kinase, endoribonuclease, and GTPase, implicating that they are involved in 40S ribosome biogenesis in diverse ways. These non-ribosomal proteins are structurally highly conserved, suggesting that they have similar functions in ribosome biogenesis from yeast to multicellular animals.

In this study, we attempted to discover a novel cell growth regulator using a fruit fly system and successfully identified low temperature viability protein 1 (LTV1). LTV1 specifically interacted with ribosomal protein S3 (RpS3) and co-purified with free 40S ribosome subunits. We found that LTV1 is crucial for the biogenesis of 40S ribosome subunits by affecting pre-rRNA processing and the nuclear export of pre-40S ribosome subunits. Furthermore, we showed that LTV1 was transcriptionally regulated by dMyc and was required for dMyc-dependent ribosome biogenesis, cell growth, and endoreplication. Together, our results strongly suggested that dMyc controls ribosome biogenesis and cell growth by directly regulating the gene expression of LTV1 in Drosophila. The following fly lines were used in this study: Cg-GAL4 (Bloomington, 7011), Patched (Ptc)-GAL4 (Bloomington, 2017), UAS-dMyc (Bloomington, 9674), Act>CD2>GAL4 (Bloomington, 4780), UAS-LTV1 RNAi (Vienna Drosophila Resource Center, 33650), UAS-Crm1 RNAi (Vienna Drosophila Resource Center, 3347), UAS-RpI135 RNAi (Vienna Drosophila Resource Center, 37581), UAS-RpS2-3xHA (FlyORF, F000781), and dm4 and the revertant for dm4 (a gift from Dr. Robert Eisenman). LTV1E1 was generated in this study through imprecise excision of the P-element from CG7686CB-6202-3 (Kyoto Drosophila Genetic Resource Center, 123972). LTV1 cDNA was amplified by PCR from expressed sequence tag (Drosophila Genomics Resource Center, LD21529) and subcloned into the EcoRI and XbaI sites followed by HA sequences in pUAST vector. pUAST LTV1-HA plasmid was microinjected into w1118 embryo. Homozygous LTV1E1 fat body cells were generated by the FRT/FLP-mediated mitotic recombination (21Xu T. Rubin G.M. Analysis of genetic mosaics in developing and adult Drosophila tissues.Development. 1993; 117: 1223-1237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Embryos with proper genotypes were collected for 6 h and subsequently incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. To generate transgene-expressing clones, the FRT/FLP-mediated flip-out technique was used (22Pignoni F. Zipursky S.L. Induction of Drosophila eye development by decapentaplegic.Development. 1997; 124: 271-278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Generation of the flip-out clones in the fat body cells did not require heat shock. To induce the flip-out recombination in wing discs, larvae were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min at second instar stage. To induce gene expression of dMyc in the whole body, the third instar larvae with genotypes of Heat shock (Hs)-GAL4, Hs>dMyc (on second chromosome), and Hs>dMyc (on third chromosome) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After recovery for 6 h at 25 °C, the larvae were collected to isolate RNA. For extracting RNA from control and dMyc mutant, first instar larvae of the revertant and dm4 were collected. Total RNA was extracted by TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's manual. RNA (3 μg) was reverse transcribed by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). For quantitative real time PCR (qPCR), the synthesized cDNA was mixed with SYBR Green (Enzynomics, South Korea, RT500) and appropriate primers (300 nm) and then applied to the Bio-Rad iQ5 real time PCR detection system. The following primers were used to amplify cDNA: LTV1 cDNA, 5′-CAGCAGGCACATGTGTTTCTCTGTATTTAC-3′ and 5′-CACGTTTCTTCAGATGCTGCATGTAATCATAG-3′; actin cDNA, 5′-CACACCAAATCTTACAAAATGTGT-3′ and 5′-AATCCGGCCTTGCACATG-3′. Student's unpaired t test and one-way analysis of variance Dunnett's test (GraphPad Prism 5) were used for statistical comparison. Wandering larvae (for the salivary gland cells) or third instar larvae (for the fat body cells) were cut and turned inside out in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then directly fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. After washing for 10 min twice with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST), the samples were permeabilized in PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature and washed once with PBST. The samples were blocked with PBST containing 3% BSA. Primary antibodies and TRITC-labeled phalloidin (Sigma) were applied, and the samples were incubated at 4 °C overnight on a rotator. After three washes for 10 min in PBST, the samples were incubated at room temperature for 2 h with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies and Hoechst 33258 (Invitrogen). Larvae were washed for 10 min three times with PBST. The salivary glands or the fat body cells were isolated and mounted in 80% glycerol, PBS solution on slide glass. The samples were observed with an LSM710 confocal microscope (Zeiss). Primary antibodies used in this study were as follows: anti-fibrillarin mouse monoclonal antibody (1:200; Abcam, 4566), anti-HA rabbit monoclonal antibody (1:100; Cell Signaling Technology, 3724), and anti-cleaved caspase-3 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:100; Cell Signaling Technology, 9661). To measure cell size, the fat body cells of third instar larvae were dissected, fixed, and stained by phalloidin and Hoechst to visualize cell boundary and the nucleus, respectively. The samples were mounted with 80% glycerol, PBS solution and then observed by an LSM710 confocal microscope. The cell area was measured by ImageJ. Wandering larvae (for the salivary glands) or mid-third instar larvae (for the fat body cells) were dissected on Shields and Sang M3 medium (Sigma, S8398) and then incubated in M3 medium containing 0.1 mg/ml BrdU (Roche Applied Science, 10 280879 001) for 30 min on a rotator at room temperature. After three brief washes with PBS, larvae were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. The fat body samples were washed three times in PBST and then incubated with 5 units of DNase I (Promega, M6101) in 200 μl of PBS containing DNase I buffer for 1.5 h at 37 °C. The salivary gland samples were washed three times in PBST and then incubated in 2 n hydrochloric acid for 30 min. Larvae were washed three times in PBST followed by incubation with anti-BrdU mouse monoclonal antibody (1:100; BD Biosciences, 555627) in blocking solution. Wing discs were dissected on PBS and subsequently fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. After washing with PBST three times, discs were incubated in 0.1% sodium citrate in PBST for 30 min at 65 °C. The samples were washed three times in PBST followed by incubation in 3% BSA, PBST blocking solution and then incubated with labeling and enzyme solution (In Situ Cell Death Detection kit, Fluorescein, Roche Applied Science, 11 684 795 910) for 2 h at 37 °C. After staining with Hoechst and washing with PBST, wing discs were mounted in 80% glycerol, PBS. Drosophila S2-DRSC cells were obtained from Drosophila Genomics Resource Center and maintained in Shields and Sang M3 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and 10% insect medium supplement (Sigma, 17267) at 25 °C. Transfection was performed using Effectene (Qiagen, 301425) according to the manufacturer's instructions on 6-well plates. The RpS3-specific antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with the peptide MNANLPISKKRKFVS. To generate the C-terminal V5-tagged LTV1 plasmid, LTV1 cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of pAc5.1-V5/His vector (Invitrogen). For the C-terminal HA-tagged LTV1 plasmid, LTV1-HA containing a stop codon was amplified by PCR from the template pUAST LTV1-HA (see above) and cloned into the EcoRI and NotI sites of pAc5.1-V5/His vector. The RpS3 ORF was amplified by PCR from expressed sequence tag (Drosophila Genomics Resource Center, LD21061). To generate the C-terminal mCherry-tagged RpS3 plasmid, the RpS3 ORF without a stop codon was subcloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pAc5.1-V5/His vector. Subsequently, the mCherry ORF containing a stop codon was subcloned into the XhoI and XbaI sites of pAc5.1-RpS3-V5/His plasmid. The C-terminal V5-tagged RpS3 plasmid was generated by subcloning RpS3 ORF into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pAc5.1-V5/His vector. For synthesis of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), double-stranded DNA was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA that was extracted from w1118 with primers containing a T7 polymerase binding site (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGA-3′) at the 5′-end. dsRNA was transcribed using PCR product as a template with the MEGAscript T7 kit (Ambion, AM1334). Synthesized dsRNA was purified using the MEGAclearTM kit (Ambion, AM1908). The following primers were used for dsRNA synthesis: luciferase dsRNA, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAGGCCCGGCGCCATTCTATC-3′ and 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAGATTGGGAGCTTTTTTTGCACG-3′; LTV1 dsRNA, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACGGAACTGGGCGACTTGGCTCT-3′ and 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAACCCCACCACGCAGGACATT-3′; dMyc dsRNA, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACAAAGTGACGCATAGCTCCA-3′ and 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAGGTTATCCTAGCCCTACGCC-3′. For bathing dsRNA, culture medium was replaced by serum-free M3 medium, and S2 cells were diluted to a proper concentration. 1 × 106 cells were applied to a 6-well plate, and 16 μg of dsRNA was added. After incubation for 45 min at 25 °C, serum-containing M3 medium was supplied. S2 cells were lysed after 4 days of incubation at 25 °C. To generate stably expressing S2 cell lines, each pAc5.1-V5/His or pAc5.1 LTV1-V5/His vector was co-transfected with pCoHygro plasmids (Invitrogen) by Effectene in 6-well plates. Fresh M3 medium containing serum and 300 μg/ml hygromycin (Sigma, H0654) were replaced every 4 days. After 1 month, surviving hygromycin-resistant cells began to proliferate, and they were used for further experiments. S2 cells stably expressing each empty vector and pAc5.1 LTV1-V5/His were cultured in s T-75 flask, and 1 × 108 cells were collected. After washing twice with 20 ml of cold PBS, S2 cells were lysed with 4 ml of lysis buffer 1 (25 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 150 mm sodium chloride, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C on a rotator. After centrifugation at 13,200 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, the clarified lysates were transferred. Protein concentration in lysates was measured by Bradford assay. 80 μl of protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare, 17-0618-02) was applied to the same concentration of lysates, and then the samples were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C to remove nonspecifically proteins bound to Sepharose. After brief centrifugation, the supernatant was collected. 80 μl of V5-agarose (Sigma, A7345) in a 50% slurry was applied and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C on a rotator. The beads were washed sequentially once with 1 ml of BC150 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 15% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm potassium chloride (KCl)), once with 1 ml of BC300 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 15% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 300 mm KCl), twice with 1 ml of BC500 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 15% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 500 mm KCl), and once with 1 ml of BC150. The sample buffer (70 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% glycerol, 0.002% bromophenol blue, 3% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 25% β-mercaptoethanol) was directly applied to the washed beads. The samples were boiled and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining. Excised gels were sequenced by LC/MS/MS in the Taplin Mass Spectrometry Facility (Harvard Medical School). S2 cells were grown to a density of 6 × 106 cells/ml, and 1 × 107 cells were collected by pipetting and washed twice with 1 ml of cold PBS. S2 cells were lysed in lysis buffer 1 (described above). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,200 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The whole cell lysates for Western blotting were mixed with the sample buffer and boiled at 95 °C. Anti-HA (MBL International), -V5 (Invitrogen), or -RFP (Abcam) antibody was added to the remaining lysates for immunoprecipitation. The mixture was incubated for 3 h on a rotator at 4 °C. 35 μl of protein G-Sepharose in a 50% slurry was added followed by incubation for 1 h on a rotator at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were washed five times with 500 μl of washing buffer BC150 (described above). After washing, the immunoprecipitate was boiled with the sample buffer. For immunoblotting of the lysates from flies, 15 adult flies were collected in a tube and homogenized in 150 μl of lysis buffer 1. After centrifugation at 13,200 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, the cleared lysates were carefully transferred and boiled with the sample buffer. For the treatment with RNase A, the lysates were incubated with 0.1 μg/ml RNase A for 2 h at room temperature, and immunoprecipitation was further conducted. To confirm 18S rRNA degradation, total RNA was extracted by TRIzol-LS (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). Synthesized cDNA was amplified by PCR with the following primers: 5′-CATTCATGTTGGCAGTAAAATGCTTATTGTGTTTG-3′ and 5′-GATCCTTCCGCAGGTTCACCTACG-3′. For immunoblotting, primary antibodies were applied as follow: anti-V5 mouse monoclonal antibody (1:5,000; Invitrogen, 46-0705), anti-HA 3F10 rat monoclonal antibody (1:1,000; Roche Applied Science, 11867423001), anti-β-tubulin mouse monoclonal antibody (E7; 1:500; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), and anti-RFP rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1,000; Abcam, Ab62341). After 200 μg/ml cycloheximide treatment for 10 min at 25 °C, 1 × 107 of S2 cells were washed twice with 1 ml of cold PBS and lysed by incubation for 10 min at 4 °C with 900 μl of lysis buffer 2 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem, 535140), 200 units of Superase-In RNase inhibitor (Ambion, AM2696)). For analysis of ribosome content in LTV1-HA-overexpressing larvae, 30 third instar larvae were collected and washed twice with 1 ml of cold PBS and then homogenized in 900 μl of lysis buffer 2. After centrifugation at 10,000 relative centrifugal force for 15 min at 4 °C, 850 μl of the cleared lysates was transferred. Protein concentration in the lysates was measured by Bradford assay, and the samples were adjusted to the same protein concentration and volume. 10 ml of 10–50% sucrose gradient in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide was prepared 1 day before cell harvest. 800 μg of the lysates was carefully applied on the top of the sucrose gradient and then separated by centrifugation at 32,000 rpm for 3.5 h at 4 °C using an SW41Ti rotor (Beckman). The fractions were collected by a fraction collector (Bio-Rad), and UV absorbance at 260 nm was measured for each fraction. The dsRNA for luciferase and dMyc were bathed in 1 × 106 cells in 6-well plates. After 4 days, S2 cells were incubated in 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 25 °C for cross-linking. The reaction was terminated by incubation in 0.24 m glycine for 5 min at room temperature. S2 cells were washed twice by 1 ml of cold PBS, collected in a 1.5-ml tube, and lysed with 500 μl of freshly prepared SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, protease inhibitor mixture). The samples were incubated for 5 min at 4 °C and sonicated 10 times with 5-s/30-s pulses in cold ice water slurry to be sheared to 200–1,000-bp genomic fragments. The samples were clarified by centrifugation at 13,200 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. 10 μl of the lysates was kept for input, and 400 μl of the lysates was mixed with 3.6 ml of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl, protease inhibitor mixture). 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare, 17-0974-04) was applied to the diluted lysates followed by incubating on a rotator for 30 min at 4 °C to remove proteins nonspecifically bound to Sepharose in the lysates. After brief centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred, and 1.2 μg of dMyc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-28208) was added. The same amount of rabbit immunoglobin G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2027) was added as a control. The samples were incubated on a rotator overnight at 4 °C. 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added to the samples and incubated on a rotator for 1 h at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were sequentially washed using the following washing buffers: once with low salt washing buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl, protease inhibitor mixture), once with high salt washing buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl, protease inhibitor mixture), once with lithium chloride (LiCl) washing buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, protease inhibitor mixture), and twice with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture). The immunoprecipitates were eluted twice by incubating in elution buffer (0.1% SDS, 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate) on a rotator for 15 min at room temperature. The DNA fragments of input and immunoprecipitate were reverse cross-linked in 200 mm NaCl for 4 h at 65 °C. The samples were further incubated in 10 mm EDTA, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 40 μg/ml proteinase K for 1 h at 65 °C. The DNA fragments were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction. The contents of DNA fragments were amplified by qPCR. The results were quantified by the ΔCt method and normalized to the input control. The following primers were used for qPCR: LTV1 region A, 5′-CAAATTTGTCTTTCCATACTTATTTCAGACTTG-3′ and 5′-CATGAAATTAATAGTTTTTGAGATTTTGTTCTG-3′; LTV1 region B, 5′-GGCGCCTTTTTTCGAATTTGAGTGTGC-3′ and 5′-ATTGGATTGTTTTCGTAAAATCTTTTGTAAATAC-3′; RpI135, 5′-CTTTTATACAACTTGGATACAATTCAAAATTGG-3′ and 5′-CAGATTAATAGAACACACTAAAATAACCTTAAAG-3′. Total RNA was isolated from second instar larvae by TRIzol. An equal amount of denatured RNA (4 μg) was loaded on a 1.5% agarose gel. The separated RNA was transferred by the capillary method to Hybond N membrane (GE H"
https://openalex.org/W2042469805,"The gas phase pyrolysis of trichlorfon was investigated by the on-line gas chromatography – mass spectrometry (GC-MS) pyrolysis and theoretical calculations. Two reaction channels were proposed in the pyrolytic reaction, by analyzing the detected pyrolytic products in the total ion chromatography, including 2,2,2-trichloroacetaldehyde, dimethyl phosphite, and dichlorvos. Theoretical calculations showed that there is an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group and the phosphate O atom in trichlorfon, through which the hydroxyl H atom can be easily transferred to phosphate O atom to trigger two pyrolytic channels. In path-a, migration of H atom results in direct decomposition of trichlorfon to give 2,2,2-trichloroacetaldehyde and dimethyl phosphite in one step. In path-b, migration of H atom in trichlorfon is combined with formation of the O-P bond to give an intermediate, followed by HCl elimination to afford dichlorvos. Path-a is kinetically more favorable than path-b, which is consistent with the GC-MS results."
https://openalex.org/W1975866104,"Cluster-based descriptions of biological networks have received much attention in recent years fostered by accumulated evidence of the existence of meaningful correlations between topological network clusters and biological functional modules. Several well-performing clustering algorithms exist to infer topological network partitions. However, due to respective technical idiosyncrasies they might produce dissimilar modular decompositions of a given network. In this contribution, we aimed to analyze how alternative modular descriptions could condition the outcome of follow-up network biology analysis. We considered a human protein interaction network and two paradigmatic cluster recognition algorithms, namely: the Clauset-Newman-Moore and the infomap procedures. We analyzed at what extent both methodologies yielded different results in terms of granularity and biological congruency. In addition, taking into account Guimera cartographic role characterization of network nodes, we explored how the adoption of a given clustering methodology impinged on the ability to highlight relevant network meso-scale connectivity patterns. As a case study we considered a set of aging related proteins, and showed that only the high-resolution modular description provided by infomap, could unveil statistically significant associations between them and inter-intra modular cartographic features. Besides reporting novel biological insights that could be gained from the discovered associations, our contribution warns against possible technical concerns that might affect the tools used to mine for interaction patterns in network biology studies. In particular our results suggested that sub-optimal partitions from the strict point of view of their modularity levels might still be worth being analyzed when meso-scale features were to be explored in connection with external source of biological knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W1991466693,"Long-tailed pygmy rice rats (Oligoryzomys longicaudatus) are principal reservoir hosts of Andes virus (ANDV) (Bunyaviridae), which causes most hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome cases in the Americas. To develop tools for the study of the ANDV-host interactions, we used RNA-Seq to generate a de novo transcriptome assembly. Splenic RNA from five rice rats captured in Chile, three of which were ANDV-infected, was used to generate an assembly of 66,173 annotated transcripts, including noncoding RNAs. Phylogenetic analysis of selected predicted proteins showed similarities to those of the North American deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), the principal reservoir of Sin Nombre virus (SNV). One of the infected rice rats had about 50-fold more viral burden than the others, suggesting acute infection, whereas the remaining two had levels consistent with persistence. Differential expression analysis revealed distinct signatures among the infected rodents. The differences could be due to 1) variations in viral load, 2) dimorphic or reproductive differences in splenic homing of immune cells, or 3) factors of unknown etiology. In the two persistently infected rice rats, suppression of the JAK-STAT pathway at Stat5b and Ccnot1, elevation of Casp1, RIG-I pathway factors Ppp1cc and Mff, and increased FC receptor-like transcripts occurred. Caspase-1 and Stat5b activation pathways have been shown to stimulate T helper follicular cell (TFH) development in other species. These data are also consistent with reports suggestive of TFH stimulation in deer mice experimentally infected with hantaviruses. In the remaining acutely infected rice rat, the apoptotic pathway marker Cox6a1 was elevated, and putative anti-viral factors Abcb1a, Fam46c, Spp1, Rxra, Rxrb, Trmp2 and Trim58 were modulated. Transcripts for preproenkephalin (Prenk) were reduced, which may be predictive of an increased T cell activation threshold. Taken together, this transcriptome dataset will permit rigorous examination of rice rat-ANDV interactions and may lead to better understanding of virus ecology."
https://openalex.org/W2005770341,"The topography of the auriculotemporal nerve (ATN) root system is the main criterion of this nerve classification. Previous publications indicate that ATN may have between one and five roots. Most common is a one- or two-root variant of the nerve structure. The problem of many publications is the inconsistency of nomenclature which concerns the terms ""roots"", ""connecting branches"", or ""branches"" that are used to identify the same structures. This study was performed on 80 specimens (40 adults and 40 fetuses) to propose a classification based on: (i) the number of roots, (ii) way of root division, and (iii) configuration of interradicular fibers that form the ATN trunk. This new classification is a remedy for inconsistency of nomenclature of ATN in the infratemporal fossa. This classification system has proven beneficial when organizing all ATN variants described in previous studies and could become a helpful tool for surgeons and dentists. Examination of ATN from the infratemporal fossa of fetuses (the youngest was at 18 weeks gestational age) showed that, at that stage, the nerve is fully developed."
https://openalex.org/W2069919346,"A group of papers investigates functional regulatory elements in genomes from human tissue samples and cell lines. What can neuroscientists learn from the gigantic data set and how will it affect the direction of neuroepigenetics? A group of papers investigates functional regulatory elements in genomes from human tissue samples and cell lines. What can neuroscientists learn from the gigantic data set and how will it affect the direction of neuroepigenetics? A striking and unexpected conclusion that emerged from the completion of the Human Genome Project (Figure 1A) was that the number of genes in the human genome is no more than that of C. elegans (Lander et al., 2001Lander E.S. Linton L.M. Birren B. Nusbaum C. Zody M.C. Baldwin J. Devon K. Dewar K. Doyle M. FitzHugh W. et al.International Human Genome Sequencing ConsortiumNature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (17711) Google Scholar, Venter et al., 2001Venter J.C. Adams M.D. Myers E.W. Li P.W. Mural R.J. Sutton G.G. Smith H.O. Yandell M. Evans C.A. Holt R.A. et al.Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (10576) Google Scholar). Further, we learned that over 95% of the human genome exhibits no protein-coding information. These discoveries shifted our focus from genomes to epigenomes to explain how the complex variegation of human cells and tissues may arise from a precise orchestration of this limited number of genes. The modern definition of epigenome is reversibly encoded information to the genome without altering the underlying DNA sequences. The epigenome works as landmarks for each cell to correctly interpret the invariable scriptio continua of DNA-based genome. There are ever-expanding facets of the epigenome, each of which requires specific experimental modalities to assess—DNase-seq for open chromatin, Hi-C for chromatin long-range interaction, ChIP-seq for transcription factor binding or histone post-translational modifications, and bisulfite-seq for 5-methylcytosine modifications (Figure 1B). All of the epigenomic information is marked on a single string of genomic DNA, but most epigenetic studies often pick a subset of epigenomic features due to the economical reason. Thus, the interdisciplinary Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project was launched to achieve holistic and comprehensive understanding of human epigenomes (Figure 1A) (ENCODE Project Consortium, 2004ENCODE Project ConsortiumScience. 2004; 306: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (1691) Google Scholar). Over the last decade, the ENCODE project has successfully generated a large amount of epigenomic data from over a hundred cell or tissue types (ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012ENCODE Project ConsortiumNature. 2012; 489: 57-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (11031) Google Scholar, ENCODE Project Consortium, 2007ENCODE Project ConsortiumNature. 2007; 447: 799-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (4118) Google Scholar). Very recently, the Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium had their first large-scale release, which focused on epigenomes of human primary cells and tissue samples, including nine human adult brain structures (Figure 1C) (Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium et al., 2015Kundaje A. Meuleman W. Ernst J. Bilenky M. Yen A. Heravi-Moussavi A. Kheradpour P. Zhang Z. Wang J. Ziller M.J. et al.Roadmap Epigenomics ConsortiumNature. 2015; 518: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (3578) Google Scholar). Now there is substantial evidence that epigenetic regulation is especially crucial for brain function and the mammalian brain exhibits a particularly plastic epigenetic landscape (Guan et al., 2009Guan J.S. Haggarty S.J. Giacometti E. Dannenberg J.H. Joseph N. Gao J. Nieland T.J. Zhou Y. Wang X. Mazitschek R. et al.Nature. 2009; 459: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar, Guo et al., 2011Guo J.U. Ma D.K. Mo H. Ball M.P. Jang M.H. Bonaguidi M.A. Balazer J.A. Eaves H.L. Xie B. Ford E. et al.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1345-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Here we highlight the value, application, limitation, and future of large-scale epigenomic studies from the viewpoint of the emerging field of neuroepigenetics. Since the ENCODE consortium was launched in 2003, we have experienced an exponential growth in the epigenome database. Several major releases have significantly advanced our understanding of the human epigenome (Figure 1A). First, the ENCODE consortium revealed 1% of the human epigenome and transcriptome using microarray technologies in 2007. This pilot release provided a number of groundbreaking discoveries and insights, including the identification of pervasive genome-wide transcriptional activity and characterization of distal regulatory elements and mega-base-scale chromatin domains (ENCODE Project Consortium, 2007ENCODE Project ConsortiumNature. 2007; 447: 799-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (4118) Google Scholar). Second, the ENCODE consortium released 30 publications with massive data sets in 2012, which provided a far more comprehensive view of the epigenetic landscape and additional insights (ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012ENCODE Project ConsortiumNature. 2012; 489: 57-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (11031) Google Scholar). Using 147 cell types from mostly cultured cell lines, these studies sought to establish generally applicable principles of the human epigenome, which included a hierarchical network of transcription factor (TF) binding, predicting TF binding using known TF motifs and DNase I footprinting, and predicting functional chromatin states by integrating histone modifications and chromatin accessibility (Figure 1B) (ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012ENCODE Project ConsortiumNature. 2012; 489: 57-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (11031) Google Scholar, Ernst and Kellis, 2010Ernst J. Kellis M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, Ernst et al., 2011Ernst J. Kheradpour P. Mikkelsen T.S. Shoresh N. Ward L.D. Epstein C.B. Zhang X. Wang L. Issner R. Coyne M. et al.Nature. 2011; 473: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar, Thurman et al., 2012Thurman R.E. Rynes E. Humbert R. Vierstra J. Maurano M.T. Haugen E. Sheffield N.C. Stergachis A.B. Wang H. Vernot B. et al.Nature. 2012; 489: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). Third, the Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium released an even greater amount of data focused on human primary cells and tissues (Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium et al., 2015Kundaje A. Meuleman W. Ernst J. Bilenky M. Yen A. Heravi-Moussavi A. Kheradpour P. Zhang Z. Wang J. Ziller M.J. et al.Roadmap Epigenomics ConsortiumNature. 2015; 518: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (3578) Google Scholar), which revealed more comprehensive and fundamental epigenetic principles with potential for widespread biological relevance. For example, Ziller et al. attributed key transcription factors to regional epigenomic transition throughout consecutive stages of in vitro neural differentiation (Ziller et al., 2015Ziller M.J. Edri R. Yaffe Y. Donaghey J. Pop R. Mallard W. Issner R. Gifford C.A. Goren A. Xing J. et al.Nature. 2015; 518: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Gjoneska et al. showed that epigenome changes in a mouse Alzheimer disease model occur at conserved regulatory elements for immune cells (Gjoneska et al., 2015Gjoneska E. Pfenning A.R. Mathys H. Quon G. Kundaje A. Tsai L.H. Kellis M. Nature. 2015; 518: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Currently, the growth of the epigenome database derived from these consortiums has three immediate benefits. First, these large data sets can be probed for epigenetic marks of interest at specific loci by individual researchers to guide their own studies. Second, it allows targeted approaches for genome-wide analyses. Recent works by Lunnon et al. and De Jager et al. are excellent examples of how epigenetic perturbations in human brain disorders can be identified using targeted approaches (De Jager et al., 2014De Jager P.L. Srivastava G. Lunnon K. Burgess J. Schalkwyk L.C. Yu L. Eaton M.L. Keenan B.T. Ernst J. McCabe C. et al.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, Lunnon et al., 2014Lunnon K. Smith R. Hannon E. De Jager P.L. Srivastava G. Volta M. Troakes C. Al-Sarraj S. Burrage J. Macdonald R. et al.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1164-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). These studies employed microarray-based methylation analysis, which covers only 1.5% of CpGs in the genome but included most identified promoters and functional genomic elements based on previous genome-wide studies. Designing assays that could specifically target only functional elements would be a very powerful tool for large-scale screening of brain-specific epigenomic perturbations. Third, we can infer chromatin state information using only key epigenomic features (Figure 1B, bottom). The roadmap project consortium reported that a combination of a subset of histone modifications is sufficient to define the nearby transcription levels and even to impute the chromatin accessibility and local DNA methylation levels (Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium et al., 2015Kundaje A. Meuleman W. Ernst J. Bilenky M. Yen A. Heravi-Moussavi A. Kheradpour P. Zhang Z. Wang J. Ziller M.J. et al.Roadmap Epigenomics ConsortiumNature. 2015; 518: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (3578) Google Scholar). Therefore, if such an assumption holds true for other tissues of interest, we can achieve a similar level of precision as large-scale epigenomic projects using a fraction of epigenomic assays. Is there an endpoint to the trend of massive data accumulation in epigenetics? Clearly, epigenome projects would not achieve “completion” in the same way as the Human Genome Project. First, unlike the largely invariable genome, the epigenome varies along multiple and interacting dimensions that include different cell and tissue types, specific developmental stages, and physiological or pathological perturbations (Figures 1C–1F). Second, there has been a rapid expansion of identified epigenetic features, such as different DNA base modifications, hundreds of histone posttranslational modifications and binding of transcription factors, nucleosome occupancy, and 3-dimensional chromatin architectures (Figures 1A and 1B). If the variability of the epigenome among tissue and cell types with different developmental, physiological, or pathological conditions, combined with the myriad facets of epigenetic features, precludes the identification of all possible reference epigenomes, then what is the future of the epigenome project, especially from the neuroepigenetics point-of-view? First, we expect to identify generally applicable rules defining chromatin states using a minimal number of epigenetic features. There are a few tools defining chromatin features using a subset of histone modifications without bias. Moreover, the Roadmap Epigenomics project showed the possibility of computing the distribution of missing epigenetic marks with precision based on other observed epigenetic data sets (Ernst and Kellis, 2015Ernst J. Kellis M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; (Published online February 18, 2015)https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). It suggests that certain epigenetic marks are dependent variables, and thus not necessary to be assayed for all biological conditions. Eventually, utilizing the simplest rules to distinguish the distribution and rearrangement of underlying chromatin functional segments would become possible. Second, we expect to see the emergence of single-cell epigenomics to address the heterogeneity issue (Figures 1C–1F). Heterogeneity is indeed a very imminent challenge for neuroepigenetics (Shin et al., 2014Shin J. Ming G.L. Song H. Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1463-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). There are two types of heterogeneity: cell-type/static heterogeneity and temporal/dynamic heterogeneity. Static heterogeneity indicates cells with distinct functions, such as neurons and astrocytes, which are therefore expected to exhibit distinct basal epigenomes. Dynamic heterogeneity indicates a change of the epigenome within the same cell population resulting from changes in activity, a critical property of dynamic brain circuits and function (Guo et al., 2011Guo J.U. Ma D.K. Mo H. Ball M.P. Jang M.H. Bonaguidi M.A. Balazer J.A. Eaves H.L. Xie B. Ford E. et al.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1345-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Static heterogeneity can be partially addressed by cell selection through methods such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting, yet these approaches may preclude identification of unappreciated heterogeneity among the seemingly homogenous population. Dynamic heterogeneity can only be tackled by single-cell epigenetic assays because of the continuous nature of the process. Third, we expect to achieve allelic information of various epigenomic features via sequential profiling of different epigenetic marks in the same sample, such as Chip-bisulfite sequencing (Guo et al., 2014Guo J.U. Su Y. Shin J.H. Shin J. Li H. Xie B. Zhong C. Hu S. Le T. Fan G. et al.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Fourth, we need to know the causal and temporal relationships between different epigenetic marks. These mechanistic insights will be tremendously helpful in understanding which epigenomic assay to use when we study more specific developmental or disease conditions. Epigenetic mechanisms are emerging as an important component in human brain function and dysfunction (De Jager et al., 2014De Jager P.L. Srivastava G. Lunnon K. Burgess J. Schalkwyk L.C. Yu L. Eaton M.L. Keenan B.T. Ernst J. McCabe C. et al.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, Guan et al., 2009Guan J.S. Haggarty S.J. Giacometti E. Dannenberg J.H. Joseph N. Gao J. Nieland T.J. Zhou Y. Wang X. Mazitschek R. et al.Nature. 2009; 459: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar, Lunnon et al., 2014Lunnon K. Smith R. Hannon E. De Jager P.L. Srivastava G. Volta M. Troakes C. Al-Sarraj S. Burrage J. Macdonald R. et al.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1164-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The mammalian brain also exhibits unique epigenetic features, such as high levels of hydroxymethylcytosine (Kriaucionis and Heintz, 2009Kriaucionis S. Heintz N. Science. 2009; 324: 929-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar) and nonCpG methylation (Guo et al., 2014Guo J.U. Su Y. Shin J.H. Shin J. Li H. Xie B. Zhong C. Hu S. Le T. Fan G. et al.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Moreover, over 90% of disease alleles are located at non-coding distal regulatory elements, suggesting the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in the brain. The immense complexity of neural structures and circuitry, in conjunction with both static and dynamic heterogeneity of cellular populations, make it challenging to understand the mechanisms and consequences of epigenetic modifications. However, considering the relatively short history of the large-scale epigenomic projects and the rapid advancement of supporting technologies that include assays for novel epigenomic features, next-generation sequencing technology, and bioinformatics makes us optimistic for the future of neuroepigenetics."

Considering unexplained risk for specific populations, places and times can reveal the signature of unidentified risk factors and risk factors not fully accounted for in the case-control study. This potentially can lead to new hypotheses regarding disease causation. Methods Global, local and focused Q-statistics are applied to data from a population-based case-control study of 11 southeast Michigan counties. Analyses were conducted using both year- and age-based measures of time. The analyses were adjusted for arsenic exposure, education, smoking, family history of bladder cancer, occupational exposure to bladder cancer carcinogens, age, gender, and race. Results Significant global clustering of cases was not found. Such a finding would indicate large-scale clustering of cases relative to controls through time. However, highly significant local clusters were found in Ingham County near Lansing, in Oakland County, and in the City of Jackson, Michigan. The Jackson City cluster was observed in working-ages and is thus consistent with occupational causes. The Ingham County cluster persists over time, suggesting a broad-based geographically defined exposure. Focused clusters were found for 20 industrial sites engaged in manufacturing activities associated with known or suspected bladder cancer carcinogens. Set-based tests that adjusted for multiple testing were not significant, although local clusters persisted through time and temporal trends in probability of local tests were observed. Conclusion Q analyses provide a powerful tool for unpacking unexplained disease risk from case-control studies. This is particularly useful when the effect of risk factors varies spatially, through time, or through both space and time. For bladder cancer in Michigan, the next step is to investigate causal hypotheses that may explain the excess bladder cancer risk localized to areas of Oakland and Ingham counties, and to the City of Jackson."
https://openalex.org/W1993452650,"RAP1 (RAS proximate 1), a small GTP-binding protein of the RAS superfamily, is a putative oncogene that is highly expressed in several malignant cell lines and types of cancers, including some types of squamous cell carcinoma. However, the participation of RAP1 in cervical carcinogenesis is unknown. We conducted a cross-sectional study of paraffin-embedded cervical biopsies to determine the association of RAP1 with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Standard and quantitative immunohistochemistry assessment of RAP1 expression in fixed tissue was performed on 183 paraffin-embedded cervical biopsies that were classified as normal or non-dysplastic mucosa (NDM) (n = 33); CIN grade 1 (n = 84) and CIN grade 2/3 (n = 66). A gradual increase in RAP1 expression in NDM < CIN 1 < CIN 2/3 (p<0.001) specimens was observed and was in agreement with the histopathologic diagnosis. A progressive increase in the RAP1 expression levels increased the risk of CIN 1 [odds ratio (OR) = 3.50; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30-10.64] 3.5 fold and the risk of CIN 2/3 (OR = 19.86, 95% CI 6.40-70.79) nearly 20 fold when compared to NDM. In addition, stereotype ordinal regression analysis showed that this progressive increase in RAP1 expression more strongly impacted CIN 2/3 than CIN 1. Our findings suggest that RAP1 may be a useful biomarker for the diagnosis of CIN."
