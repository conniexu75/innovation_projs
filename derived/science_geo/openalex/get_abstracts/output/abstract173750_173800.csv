https://openalex.org/W2036973053,"The mouse ortholog of human FACE-1, Zmpste24, is a multispanning membrane protein widely distributed in mammalian tissues and structurally related to Afc1p/ste24p, a yeast metalloproteinase involved in the maturation of fungal pheromones. Disruption of the gene Zmpste24 caused severe growth retardation and premature death in homozygous-null mice. Histopathological analysis of the mutant mice revealed several abnormalities, including dilated cardiomyopathy, muscular dystrophy and lipodystrophy. These alterations are similar to those developed by mice deficient in A-type lamin, a major component of the nuclear lamina, and phenocopy most defects observed in humans with diverse congenital laminopathies. In agreement with this finding, Zmpste24-null mice are defective in the proteolytic processing of prelamin A. This deficiency in prelamin A maturation leads to the generation of abnormalities in nuclear architecture that probably underlie the many phenotypes observed in both mice and humans with mutations in the lamin A gene. These results indicate that prelamin A is a specific substrate for Zmpste24 and demonstrate the usefulness of genetic approaches for identifying the in vivo substrates of proteolytic enzymes."

Insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) has been implicated in islet development and differentiated function, but the factors controlling this process are poorly understood. Pancreatic islets produce Igf1 and Igf2, which bind to specific receptors on beta-cells. Igf1 has been shown to influence beta-cell apoptosis, and both Igf1 and Igf2 increase islet growth; Igf2 does so in a manner additive with fibroblast growth factor 2 (ref. 10). When mice deficient for the Igf1 receptor (Igf1r(+/-)) are bred with mice lacking insulin receptor substrate 2 (Irs2(-/-)), the resulting compound knockout mice show a reduction in mass of beta-cells similar to that observed in pancreas of Igf1r(-/-) mice (ref. 11), suggesting a role for Igf1r in growth of beta-cells. It is possible, however, that the effects in these mice occur secondary to changes in vascular endothelium or in the pancreatic ductal cells, or because of a decrease in the effects of other hormones implicated in islet growth. To directly define the role of Igf1, we have created a mouse with a beta-cell-specific knockout of Igf1r (betaIgf1r(-/-)). These mice show normal growth and development of beta-cells, but have reduced expression of Slc2a2 (also known as Glut2) and Gck (encoding glucokinase) in beta-cells, which results in defective glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and impaired glucose tolerance. Thus, Igf1r is not crucial for islet beta-cell development, but participates in control of differentiated function."

https://openalex.org/W2123934552,"Many transcription factors regulate specific temporal-spatial events during cardiac differentiation; however, the mechanisms that regulate such events are largely unknown. Using a modified subtractive hybridization method to identify specific genes that influence early cardiac development, we found that Bop is expressed specifically in cardiac and skeletal muscle precursors before differentiation of these lineages. Bop encodes a protein containing MYND and SET domains, which have been shown to regulate transcription by mediating distinct chromatin modifications. We show that m-Bop is a histone deacetylase-dependent transcriptional repressor. Targeted deletion of Bop in mice disrupted maturation of ventricular cardiomyocytes and interfered with formation of the right ventricle. Normal expression of Hand2, a transcription factor essential for right ventricular development, in cardiomyocyte precursors is dependent upon m-Bop. These results indicate that m-Bop is essential for cardiomyocyte differentiation and cardiac morphogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2074278201,"Screening of cDNA expression libraries derived from plants exposed to stress, with35S-labeled recombinant calmodulin as a probe, revealed a new family of proteins containing a transcription activation domain and two types of DNA-binding domains designated the CG-1 domain and the transcription factor immunoglobulin domain, ankyrin repeats, and a varying number of IQ calmodulin-binding motifs. Based on domain organization and amino acid sequence comparisons, similar proteins, with the same domain organization, were identified in the genomes of other multicellular organisms including human, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis, whereas none were found in the complete genomes of single cell eukaryotes and prokaryotes. This family of proteins was designated calmodulin-binding transcription activators (CAMTAs). Arabidopsis thalianacontains six CAMTA genes (AtCAMTA1–AtCAMTA6). The transcription activation domain of AtCAMTA1 was mapped by testing a series of protein fusions with the DNA-binding domain of the bacterial LexA transcription factor and two reporter genes fused to LexA recognition sequences in yeast cells. Two human proteins designated HsCAMTA1 and HsCAMTA2 were also shown to activate transcription in yeast using the same reporter system. Subcellular fractionation ofArabidopsis tissues revealed the presence of CAMTAs predominantly in the nucleus. Calmodulin binding assays identified a region of 25 amino acids capable of binding calmodulin with high affinity (Kd = 1.2 nm) in the presence of calcium. We suggest that CAMTAs comprise a conserved family of transcription factors in a wide range of multicellular eukaryotes, which possibly respond to calcium signaling by direct binding of calmodulin.

Transcription factors play a crucial role in regulating every aspect of the organism's life cycle and are fit to respond to signals originating from within and without the organism. Not surprisingly, a high proportion of eukaryote genomes encode transcription factors, estimated to be ∼2,000 in humans (roughly 5% of the genome) where the gene expression machinery seems to be particularly complex (1Tupler R. Perini G. Green M.R. Nature. 2001; 409: 832-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, a remarkable estimate of 3,000 genes (11.8% of the genome) were suggested to be involved in different aspects of transcription regulation (2The Arabidopsis Genome InitiativeNature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (7199) Google Scholar). These include many new factors whose roles in gene expression are unknown. In mammalian cells, Ca2+ and the Ca2+ receptor calmodulin are involved in regulating gene transcription. For example, expression of the c-fos gene is mediated by Ca2+signals through two DNA regulatory elements, the cyclic AMP-response element and the serum-response element. Increase in nuclear Ca2+ concentration stimulates cyclic AMP-response element-dependent gene expression, whereas elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ activates transcription via the serum-response element (3Hardingham G.E. Chawla S. Johnson C.M. Bading H. Nature. 1997; 385: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Thus, nuclear and cytoplasmic Ca2+ control transcription by distinct mechanisms. Certain transcription factors are selectively activated in response to distinct Ca2+ signal duration and amplitude. NF-κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase are activated by a large transient cytoplasmic Ca2+ rise, whereas NFAT is activated by a low, sustained plateau (4Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). Therefore, different types of oscillating Ca2+signals can modulate downstream transcription factor activity. Ca2+ can also directly bind and regulate transcription factors. For example, the DREAM protein contains four EF-hand motifs and represses transcription (5Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) as DREAM affinity for DNA is reduced upon binding to Ca2+. Calmodulin modulates the nuclear activity of various proteins, like the mammalian family of nuclear Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (6Heist E.K. Schulman H. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). When activated by Ca2+/calmodulin, calmodulin-kinase II can specifically decode the frequency of Ca2+ spikes into distinct levels of kinase activity (7de Koninck P. Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar) and phosphorylates a large number of target proteins. In plants, recent advances revealed that post-translational modifications of CaM53, a novel petunia calmodulin isoform, could modify the subcellular localization of the protein and direct it to the nucleus or the plasma membrane (8Rodriguez-Concepcion M. Yalovsky S. Zik M. Fromm H. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1996-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In addition, certain transcription factors of the basic helix-loop-helix family were shown to bind calmodulin, thus inhibiting their DNA-binding properties by masking the DNA-binding domain (9Onions J. Hermann S. Grundstrom T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4366-4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 10Onions J. Hermann S. Grundstrom T. J. Biol.

Nature. 1994; 368: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Therefore, interaction of calmodulin with transcription factors is a mechanism by which transcriptional activity may be regulated in response to Ca2+ signals originating from a variety of stimuli. We used protein-protein interaction for library screenings to identify plant calcium/calmodulin-binding proteins. One family of calmodulin-binding proteins, designated the calmodulin-binding transcription activator (CAMTA)1 family, which has been identified in the course of this study, resembles a group of putative transcription activators recently identified in the human genome (12Lander E.S. Linton L.M. Birren B. Nusbaum C. Zody M.C. Baldwin J. Devon K. Dewar K. Doyle M. FitzHugh W. Funke R. Gage D. Harris K. Heaford A. Howland J. et al.Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (17950) Google Scholar). These were reported to contain a novel DNA-binding domain termed CG-1, a transcription factor immunoglobulin (TIG)-like DNA-binding domain, and ankyrin repeats. However, the properties of these proteins as transcription activators have never been tested, and the extent of their distribution in eukaryotes has not been investigated. Here we investigated the properties of members of this family of putative transcription factors from Arabidopsisand humans, demonstrating the ability of both to activate transcription in yeast cells. We also expanded the bioinformatic analysis of this protein family to reveal their occurrence and domain organization in multicellular organisms. A Brassica napus library from leaves of drought-stressed plants (13Downing W.L. Mauxion F. Fauvarque M.O. Reviron M.P. de Vienne D. Vartanian N. Giraudat J. Plant J. 1992; 2: 685-693PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by J. Giraudat (Institut des Sciences Végétales, CNRS, Gif-sur-Yvette, France). Expression library screening was performed with35S-labeled recombinant calmodulin from petunia (CaM81; GenBankTM accession number S70768) as a probe (14Baum G. Chen Y. Arazi T. Takatsuji H. Fromm H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19610-19617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several databases were used to retrieve and compare sequences: the GenBankTM data base (NCBI server; www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative data base (TAIR server; www.arabidopsis.org), and the Berkeley fly data base (BDGP server; www.fruitfly.org). Domain identification and comparisons were done with the InterPro data base (www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro; Ref. 15Apweiler R. Attwood T.K. Bairoch A. Bateman A. Birney E. Biswas M. Bucher P. Cerutti L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments were assembled with the ClustalX program (16Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35598) Google Scholar). Intron/exon junctions were predicted with the NetGene2 program in Arabidopsis thaliana (17Hebsgaard S.M. Korning P.G. Tolstrup N. Engelbrecht J. Rouze P. Brunak S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3439-3452Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) and NNSPLICE0.9 program in Drosophila melanogaster (18Reese M.G. Eeckman F.H. Kulp D. Haussler D. J. Comput. Biol. 1997; 4: 311-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) corresponding to complete cDNA clones were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC at TAIR server) for AtCAMTA1 (clone H9D3T7) and AtCAMTA5 (clone 4G3T7P) and the Kazusa DNA Research Institute for AtCAMTA2 (clone AV528637), HsCAMTA1 (clone KIAA0833), and HsCAMTA2 (clone KIAA0909). TheSf9 cell line of Spodoptera frugiperda(19O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar) was maintained as a monolayer culture at 27 °C in Grace medium (19O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biological Industries). Cells were recultured every 4 days to maintain a density ranging from ∼5 × 105 to 2.5 × 106 cells/ml. The full-length AtCAMTA1 was excised from the EST clone H9D3T7 (ABRC) with SalI and XbaI and inserted in a pFastBac1 donor plasmid (Invitrogen; Ref. 20Luckow V.A. Lee S.C. Barry G.F. Olins P.O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4566-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) downstream of the promoter of the viral polyhedrin gene. Similarly, the BnCAMTA cDNA sequence, coding for a partial BnCAMTA protein (Ile1–Lys688), was amplified by PCR with aPfu DNA polymerase (Promega) and cloned into theEcoRI and SalI sites of pFastBac1. Plasmids were then transformed into DH10BAC Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen) for transposition into the Bacmid. The screening and isolation of recombinant Bacmid DNA were done according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sf9 cells were transfected with recombinant Bacmid DNA using CellFECTIN (Invitrogen). Recombinant baculoviruses were harvested 72 h after the start of transfection. Sf9 cells were layered at a density of 5 × 106 cells/90-mm plate and infected with high titer recombinant baculoviruses. After 3 days of incubation at 27 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 500 ×g for 10 min, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g and resuspended (1 ml/plate) in extraction buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm PMSF. Cells were broken in liquid nitrogen, or by the addition of 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C, 14,000 ×g for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentrations were determined with a Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). To prepare polyclonal antibodies against the N-terminal part of AtCAMTA1, the CG-1 domain of AtCAMTA1 (Val2–Lys148) was fused in frame to the GST coding sequence in the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pGEX-3X vector (Amersham Biosciences). To prepare antibodies against the ANK-repeat region, the corresponding sequence from BnCAMTA (Gln588–Gly687) was amplified as described above and subcloned in the NdeI and SalI sites of a pET12c vector (Novagen, Inc.). These constructs were introduced in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS to produce the recombinant proteins as described (14Baum G. Chen Y. Arazi T. Takatsuji H. Fromm H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19610-19617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inclusion bodies from the insoluble fraction of the bacterial cells, containing most of the recombinant proteins, were purified and solubilized in sample buffer (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar), and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. An acrylamide band containing the recombinant protein (either the ANK repeat region or the N-terminal part of AtCAMTA1 fused to GST) was excised from the gel, crushed, and mixed (1:1) with complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma). Three ml of the mixture containing 100 μg of recombinant protein were injected into two rabbits. Each rabbit was given four booster injections about 2 weeks apart. The rabbits were bled about 10 days after each injection. The serum containing anti-CG-1 antibodies was depleted from the antibodies against GST by passing it on a GST column (Pierce). Double stranded calf thymus DNA-cellulose (Sigma) and heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Biosciences) were pre-equilibrated with the following buffer: 25 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 40 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm PMSF. Soluble fraction proteins obtained from Sf9 insect cells were dialyzed against this buffer at 4 °C using VSWP-25 filters (Millipore Corp.) and loaded on either column. After washing with 10 column volumes of buffer, proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing KCl as indicated. Aerial parts from 4-week-old A. thaliana Columbia ecotype plants were grown in vitro under the following conditions: photoperiod, 16-h day (100–150 microeinsteins/m2/s)/8-h night; temperature, 20 °C day/15 °C night; humidity, 70%. They were frozen and ground in liquid nitrogen to a fine powder with a mortar and pestle. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Part of this powder was homogenized with plant extraction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). This extract was filtered through two layers of Miracloth and centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 15 min. The insoluble and soluble fractions were collected. The rest of the powder was mixed with nuclei isolation buffer (22Foster R. Gasch A. Kay S. Chua N.-H. Koncz C. Chua N.-H. Schell J. Methods in Arabidopsis Research. World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd., Singapore1992: 378-392Crossref Google Scholar) (1m hexylene glycol, 10 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 7, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm PMSF) and filtered through two layers of Miracloth and one 100-μm nylon mesh. The extract was centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in nuclei wash buffer (0.5 m hexylene glycol, 10 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 7, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm PMSF) and centrifuged again at 3,000 ×g for 10 min. The pellet was then washed two more times and finally resuspended in 5 ml of nuclei wash buffer. Nuclei were further purified in a discontinuous Percoll gradient (23Luthe D.S. Quatrano R.S. Plant Physiol. 1980; 65: 305-308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gradient contained 5-ml layers of 40, 60, and 80% (v/v) Percoll on a 5-ml layer of 2 m sucrose cushion. The Percoll contained 0.5m hexylene glycol, 10 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 7, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.2% Triton X-100. The gradient was centrifuged at 4,000 × g in a Sorvall HB4 swinging bucket rotor for 30 min. Most of the nuclei banded in the 80% Percoll, just above the sucrose cushion. They were removed with a Pasteur pipette, washed twice with 15 ml of nuclei wash buffer to remove Percoll, and centrifuged again at 3,000 × g for 10 min. This nuclei-enriched fraction was resuspended in protein sample buffer (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar) to be loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels for Western blot analysis. The completeAtCAMTA1, HsCAMTA1, and HsCAMTA2cDNA plus 12 different AtCAMTA1 regions (corresponding to residues 1–147, 1–230, 1–680, 1–820, 148–1008, 231–1008, 681–1008, 821–1008, 231–680, 231–397, 398–566, and 567–680 for constructs 2–13, respectively) were fused in frame with the coding sequence of the DNA-binding domain of LexA in the pEG202 vector (OriGene) carrying the HIS3 selectable marker. These plasmids were then introduced in EGY48 yeast strain (MATa trp1 ura3 his3 LEU2::plexAop6-LEU2; Ref. 24Estojak J. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5820-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) by lithium acetate transformation, together with the pSH18.34 vector (OriGene) carrying the URA3 selectable marker and the lacZreporter gene fused to eight lexA operators. Yeast transformants were selected on plates containing complete minimal (CM) dropout medium without Ura and His but with Glc as a unique carbon source. Individual yeast colonies were then transferred to liquid medium (CM dropout +Glc, −His, −Ura) and grown to late log phase. These single-colony-derived cultures were tested for the production of β-galactosidase with the chromogenic substrateo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside (ONPG) or for their ability to grow on plates containing CM dropout medium without uracil, histidine, and leucine. To study the interaction between calmodulin and the calmodulin-binding domain of AtCAMTA1 in vivo, a petunia calmodulin (CaM81; GenBankTM accession number S70768) was fused in frame to the B42 transcription activator domain in the pJG4–5 vector (Origene) that carries the TRP1 selectable marker. This construct was introduced into a EGY48 yeast strain, and transformants were selected as previously described, except that Trp was omitted from the medium. 3 ml of selective medium were inoculated with 15–30 μl of saturated culture grown to late log phase. Yeast cells were grown overnight at 28 °C, under agitation. Cells were then centrifuged 5 min at 2,500 rpm and resuspended in 3 ml of Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4·7H2O, 40 mm NaH2PO4·H2O, 10 mm KCl, 1 mmMgSO4·7H2O, 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol final concentrations; adjusted to pH 7.0) and then placed on ice. A600 was determined for each sample, and the following two reaction tubes were set up (1 ml each) by mixing (a) 100 μl of cells with 900 μl of Z buffer and (b) 50 μl of cells with 950 μl of Z buffer. To break the cells, one drop of 0.1% SDS and two drops of chloroform were added to each sample, which were then vortexed 10–15 s and incubated for 15 min in a 30 °C water bath. 0.2 ml of 4 mg/ml ONPG were added, and samples were vortexed for 5 s and placed in a 30 °C water bath, at which point timing was begun. When a medium yellow color had developed, the reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 ml of 1 m Na2CO3, and the time was noted. Cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 2,500 rpm, and A420 plus A550 of the supernatant were determined. To calculate β-galactosidase units, the following equation was applied, U=(1000∗(A420−(1.75∗A550)))/(t∗v∗A600)(Eq. 1) where t represents the time of reaction (min), v is the volume of culture used in the assay (ml), A600 represents the cell density at the start of the assay; A420 is a combination of absorbence by o-nitrophenol and light scattering by cell debris, and A550 is the light scattering by cell debris. All of the measurements were done in triplicate, and the β-galactosidase units counted results from an average number. Controls used are encoded by plasmids pSH17.4 (positive control) and pRFHM1 (negative control) commercialized by OriGene. To confirm that proteins were expressed at the same level in yeast, cells were disrupted with glass beads (Sigma), and total proteins were extracted and separated on SDS-PAGE. LexA DNA-binding domain fusions were detected by Western blots using a monoclonal antibody raised against LexA (CLONTECH). DNA fragments derived from the AtCAMTA1 cDNA from residues 682–1007, 682–897, 682–869, 863–1007, 913–1007, 823–897, 823–869, and 863–897 (constructs 1–8, respectively) were fused in frame to the coding sequence of GST in a pGEX-3X vector (Amersham Biosciences). Fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli XL1-Blue strain. After induction of the expression, total proteins were extracted, separated by SDS-PAGE, and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. [35S]Calmodulin was prepared and used as described (25Arazi T. Baum G. Snedden W.A. Shelp B.J. Fromm H. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Following autoradiography of blots, immunodetection of proteins by anti-GST antibodies on the same blots was performed as described (25Arazi T. Baum G. Snedden W.A. Shelp B.J. Fromm H. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For nondenaturing PAGE, samples containing 120 pmol of bovine brain calmodulin (Sigma) and different quantities of high pressure liquid chromatography-purified synthetic peptides in 100 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.2), and 0.1 mm CaCl2, making a total volume of 30 μl, were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were analyzed by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis as previously described (25Arazi T. Baum G. Snedden W.A. Shelp B.J. Fromm H. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For fluorescence measurements of peptide interactions with dansyl-calmodulin, dansylated bovine calmodulin (400 nm; Sigma) was incubated with different concentrations of synthetic peptide in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm CaCl2. After each addition of peptide, the calmodulin/peptide solution was mixed and incubated for 5 min at 23 °C. Emission fluorescence at 480 nm was then measured using a SLM AMINCO 8000 fluorimeter (SLM Instruments); excitation wavelength was at 340 nm. Each measurement was the average of three readings. The apparent dissociation constant (Kd) was determined as described (26Arazi T. Kaplan B. Fromm H. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Plant adaptation to environmental stresses is mediated by Ca2+-signaling (27Knight H. Knight M.R. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 262-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar) and Ca2+-responsive proteins, among them calmodulin and calmodulin-related proteins (28Snedden W.A. Fromm H. New Phytol. 2001; 151: 35-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). To isolate cDNAs encoding calmodulin-binding proteins with a possible role in plant response to abiotic stress, we used 35S-labeled recombinant calmodulin as a probe to screen cDNA expression libraries derived from plants exposed to various stress conditions. In particular, screening of a cDNA library from Brassica napus leaves (see “Experimental Procedures”) resulted in the isolation of one clone that contained putative domains with DNA-binding properties and a domain that proved to function as a transcription activator, as will be shown. This clone was designated BnCAMTA (for B. napus calmodulin-binding transcription activator). Based on the domain organization and amino acid sequence of BnCAMTA, we identified members of the CAMTA family in various eukaryotes (Fig.1A): in nematodes, flies, and humans and also in other plants, including Arabidopsis. The latter's genome has six highly similar CAMTA genes designated AtCAMTA1–AtCAMTA6. In human, two homologous cDNA clones have been identified, designated HsCAMTA1(GenBankTM accession number XM_042323) and HsCAMTA2 (GenBankTM accession number XM_053753). These were isolated from a population of size-fractionated human brain mRNAs (29Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Suyama M. Kikuno R. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Gene expression profiles revealed that they are expressed in all human organs tested but highly expressed in the brain (29Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Suyama M. Kikuno R. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Interestingly, only one CAMTA gene was identified in the complete genomes of both Caenorhabditis elegans and D. melanogaster. In contrast, no members of the CAMTA family have been found in the complete genomes of S. cerevisiae and prokaryotes. Importantly, to date, no function has been attributed to any of the CAMTA genes identified in any organism, although based on domain organization, their relationship to transcription factors has been suggested (12Lander E.S.

The conserved domains include the following: (a) a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the N-terminal part of all CAMTA proteins; (b) a TIG domain reported to be involved in nonspecific DNA contacts in various transcription factors, like those of the Rel/NF-κB family or NFAT (30Aravind L.

Although spacing is highly variable, overall domain organization is conserved in all proteins. We also identified a highly conserved uncharacterized domain of about 130 amino acid residues designated CG-1, containing the predicted bipartite NLS (Fig. 1B). The CG-1 domain is named after a partial cDNA clone isolated from parsley (Petroselinum crispum L.) encoding a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein (35da Costa e Silva O. Plant Mol.

Certain stresses such as ultraviolet light stimulate the rapid and selective destruction of Cdc25A protein through a Chk1 protein kinase-dependent pathway. We demonstrate that in contrast to cellular stresses previously examined, hydrogen peroxide exposure affects Cdc25C but not Cdc25A levels. Pharmacological inhibition of Chk1 activity or a mutant of Cdc25C that lacks the Chk1 phosphorylation site still undergoes degradation in response to oxidants. We also demonstrate that in vitro hydrogen peroxide stimulates an intramolecular disulfide bond between the active site cysteine at position 377 and another invariant cysteine at position 330. The in vivo stability of Cdc25C is substantially reduced by the mutation of either of these two cysteine residues. In contrast, a double (C2) mutant of both cysteine 330 and cysteine 377 results in a protein that is more stable than wild type Cdc25C and is resistant to oxidative stress-induced degradation. In addition, the C2 mutant, which is unable to form an intramolecular disulfide bond, has reduced binding to 14-3-3 in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that oxidative stress may induce cell cycle arrest in part through the degradation of Cdc25C.

These results suggest that oxidative stress may induce cell cycle arrest in part through the degradation of Cdc25C. Three different human Cdc25 family members exist with Cdc25A regulating the G1/S transition and Cdc25B and Cdc25C involved in G2/M progression. Evidence suggests that two critical amino acids, threonine 14 and tyrosine 15, located within the cyclin-dependent kinases represent the major target for the Cdc25 family of protein phosphatases. Dephosphorylation of these two critical amino acid residues is essential for proper cell cycle progression and the subsequent association of cyclin-dependent kinases with their associated cyclins (1Obaya A.J. Sedivy J.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 126-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Given their crucial role in cell cycle progression and checkpoint control, the regulation of the activity of the various Cdc25 family members has been the subject of numerous investigations. For the case of Cdc25C, enzymatic activity has been demonstrated to be low during interphase, in part because the phosphatase is phosphorylated on serine 216. Various intracellular kinases including Chk1 appear to be capable of phosphorylating Cdc25C on this residue (2Walworth N.C. Davey S. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 363: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 3Walworth N. Bernards R. Science. 1996; 271: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 4Peng C.Y. Graves P.R.

Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). One of the important functional consequences of phosphorylation of Ser-216 is to create a consensus binding site for 14-3-3 protein binding (4Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S., Wu, Z. Shaw A.S. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). A variety of evidence suggests that in human cells, the binding of 14-3-3 increases the cytoplasmic localization of the protein (7Dalal S.N. Schweitzer C.M. Gan J. DeCaprio J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4465-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 8Graves P.R., Yu, L. Schwartz J.K. Sausville E.A. O'Conner P.M. Piwnica-Worms H. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2000; 20: 1839-1851Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In addition to 14-3-3 binding, Cdc25C is also actively transported from the nucleus through a leptomycin B-sensitive pathway that requires an N-terminal nuclear export sequence (9Graves P.R. Lovly C.M. Uy G.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Oncogene. 2000; 20: 1839-1851Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests the existence of an additional mechanism besides the phosphorylation and subcellular localization for regulation of Cdc25 activity. Three recent reports (10Mailand N. Flack J.

Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar) have described the targeted degradation of Cdc25A in response to UV light, ionizing radiation, or stalled replication. For the case of UV light and stalled replication, both studies demonstrated that inhibiting Chk1 kinase by agents such as caffeine abolished stress-induced Cdc25A proteasomal-mediated degradation. Interestingly, targeted degradation under these conditions was specific for the Cdc25A gene product, because levels of Cdc25B and Cdc25C were not affected by these stresses. All members of the Cdc25 family and indeed all protein tyrosine phosphatases possess a cysteine residue in their active site. This cysteine is extremely reactive with p Ka generally below a pH of 5.0. This low p Ka stands in contrast to most other cysteine residues in proteins that have a p Ka greater than 8.0. As such, at a physiological pH, the active site of most tyrosine phosphatases is rapidly ionized to a thiolate anion. Further oxidation can convert this thiolate anion to a sulfenic acid intermediate that is enzymatically inactive (13Clairborne A. Yeh J.I. Mallet T.C. Luba J. Crane E.J. Charrier V. Parsonage D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15407-15416Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Indeed, initial studies with purified Cdc25 phosphatases demonstrated that enzymatic activity absolutely required the presence of a millimolar concentration of reducing agents such as DTT 1The abbreviations used are: DTTdithiothreitolC2double mutant of both cysteine 330 and cysteine 377PBSphosphate-buffered salineGSTglutathione S-transferaseWTwild type1The abbreviations used are: DTTdithiothreitolC2double mutant of both cysteine 330 and cysteine 377PBSphosphate-buffered salineGSTglutathione S-transferaseWTwild type (14Dunphy W.G. Kumagai A. Cell. 1991; 67: 189-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Given the reactive nature of the active site cysteine and the fact that the sulfenic form of the cysteine is enzymatically inactive, the potential exists in that members of the Cdc25 family may be in fact partially regulated by the intracellular redox state. This notion is further supported by the published structure of two Cdc25 family members demonstrating that the active site cysteine could readily form an intramolecular disulfide bond with another conserved cysteine in the molecule (15Fauman E.B. Cogswell J.P. Lovejoy B. Rocque W.J. Holmes W. Montana V.G. Piwnica-Worms H. Rind M.J.

No information is presently available regarding the physiological role, if any, for this disulfide bond formation. dithiothreitol double mutant of both cysteine 330 and cysteine 377 phosphate-buffered saline glutathione S-transferase wild type dithiothreitol double mutant of both cysteine 330 and cysteine 377 phosphate-buffered saline glutathione S-transferase wild type One potential benefit of having two reactive cysteines within the Cdc25 structure would be that an additional cysteine would facilitate the formation of a disulfide bond that could potentially rescue the active site cysteine from irreversible oxidation. Although it is generally believed that cysteine sulfenic acid intermediates are readily reversible by thiol reduction, the formation of higher oxidation states such as sulfinic acid intermediates are thought to represent permanent irreversible modifications. Because the active site cysteine is by its very nature highly reactive and hence subject to oxidation, the ability to form an intramolecular disulfide could represent a safety valve mechanism to prevent irreversible cysteine oxidation. In this report, we have examined the effects of oxidative stress on the Cdc25 family of phosphatases. In contrast to other stresses examined to date (10Mailand N. Flack J. Lukas C. Syljuasen R.G. Welcker M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Science. 2000; 288: 1425-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 11Molinari M. Mercurio C. Dominguez J. Goubin F. Draetta G.F. EMBO J. 2000; 1: 71-79Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 12Flack J. Mailand N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar), oxidative stress does not affect Cdc25A levels. However, we do observe that hydrogen peroxide results in the rapid degradation of Cdc25C. We show that this degradation appears to be independent of Chk1 activity but requires the presence of two cysteine residues previously shown to be involved in disulfide bond formation. Interestingly, our data also suggest that these cysteine residues are important for the binding of Cdc25C to 14-3-3 and hence the subcellular localization of the protein. These results suggest how alterations in the intracellular redox state may potentially function in the G2/M checkpoint as well as in normal cell cycle progression. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell transfection was routinely performed in a 6-cm dish using 5 μg of DNA and 15 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). For oxidative challenge, we noted that the most reproducible results were obtained under serum-free conditions. This may be a result of the presence of high levels of catalase and other peroxidases in serum. As such, transfected HeLa cells were first washed several times with serum-free medium and then exposed to the indicated concentration of H2O2. Except where noted, cells were routinely treated with 1 mm H2O2 for three hours prior to harvest. At the end of the treatment time, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and subsequently harvested in radioimmune precipitation buffer (PBS, 1% Tween 20, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitors (CompleteTM Mixture, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Lysates were subsequently run on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed using anti-Cdc25A (F6) or anti-Cdc25C (H6) mouse monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Pharmacological inhibition of Chk1 was achieved by pretreatment with 10 mm caffeine for one hour prior to hydrogen peroxide exposure (10Mailand N. Flack J. Lukas C. Syljuasen R.G. Welcker M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Science. 2000; 288: 1425-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). For analysis of endogenous Cdc25C, HeLa cells were grown to 80% confluence in 15-cm dishes. Following exposure to hydrogen peroxide (1 mm for 3 h), protein lysate was immunoprecipitated with 5 μl of a mouse monoclonal anti-Cdc25C (H6) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and processed for Western blot analysis as above. Full-length human Cdc25A cDNA was amplified from a commercially available IMAGE:3633880 clone (Incyte Genomics) (GenBankTM accession number BE513548) and subsequently subcloned into a mammalian expression vector (pcDNA3.1/HisA, Invitrogen). The Myc-tagged human Cdc25C cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. H. Piwnica-Worms. This cDNA was subcloned as described above into pcDNA3.1. Various mutants of Cdc25C were prepared by a two-step PCR method (17Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). Single cysteine to serine substitutions were created at positions 330 and 377, and a double (C2) mutant containing both cysteine substitutions was also constructed. A similar strategy was employed to create a serine to alanine position 216 mutant. All constructs were verified by direct DNA sequencing of the entire gene. For bacterial expression of the C-terminal portion (amino acids 200–473) of wild type and C330S Cdc25C, constructs were subcloned into the pET15b bacterial expression vector (Novagen). Protein was purified from bacterial lysates using a Ni-affinity column. GST fusion proteins were constructed by amplification of full-length wild type and C2 mutant genes and subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-6P-3 (Amersham Biosciences). One day after transfection, HeLa cells were incubated in cysteine and methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (labeling medium) for 1 h. Cells were then exposed to fresh labeling medium supplemented with 0.1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h. Following the labeling period, cells were washed twice and subsequently incubated in chase medium (10 mg/liter l-methionine, 10 mg/liter l-cysteine in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with cycloheximide at 10 μg/ml) for the indicated time. Following the chase period, cells were lysed in 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors followed by overnight immunoprecipitation using 5 μl of anti-Cdc25C (H6) mouse monoclonal antibody per sample. Samples were run on a 12% PAGE-SDS gel and subsequently fixed for 30 min (50% MeOH, 10% glacial acetic acid) and then exposed to x-ray film overnight. Bands were analyzed by Scion Image software (Scion Corporation). Results are representative of two independent experiments. HeLa cells were seeded at a density of 7.5 × 104 cells/well in Lab-Tek II Chamber Slide (Nunc) prior to transfection. One day after transfection, cells were treated by leptomycin B (10 ng/ml for 3 h). Cells were washed four times with PBS and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were subsequently washed four times with PBS and permeabilized for 1 h in PBS containing 5% goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were then exposed for 1 h to a 1:200 dilution of mouse monoclonal anti-Cdc25C (H6) antibody in the above permeabilization buffer. Cells were again washed four times with PBS and subsequently exposed for 1 h to a 1:200 dilution of AlexaFluor secondary goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes). Subcellular distribution of Cdc25C was analyzed using a Zeiss confocal microscope (LSM-510). GST-Cdc25C fusion wild type and C2 mutant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli as full-length proteins and purified by standard methods using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). HeLa cell protein lysate was prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, proteasomal inhibitor Complete mixture). HeLa cell protein lysate (100 μg) was then incubated with Sepharose-bound GST-Cdc25C wild type or C2 mutant protein either in the presence or absence of 10 mm DTT. After 30 min at room temperature, Sepharose beads were washed four times in lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted using 10 mm reduced glutathione in PBS, pH 8.0. Eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blot for the amount of associated 14-3-3 protein using an antibody that recognizes all 14-3-3 family members (anti-14-3-3 mouse monoclonal antibody, clone H-8, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Previous studies have demonstrated the targeted destruction of Cdc25A in response to ultraviolet light or other checkpoint-inducing stresses (10Mailand N. Flack J. Lukas C. Syljuasen R.G. Welcker M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Science. 2000; 288: 1425-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 11Molinari M. Mercurio C. Dominguez J. Goubin F. Draetta G.F. EMBO J. 2000; 1: 71-79Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 12Flack J. Mailand N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). In addition, a number of reports have demonstrated that exposure to exogenous reactive oxygen species induces cell cycle arrest (18Kugamai A. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 19Yang J. Wonkler K. Yoshida M. Kornbluth S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 25487-25495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To understand whether cell cycle arrest under oxidative stress conditions triggered degradation of Cdc25A, we analyzed levels of the phosphatase following exposure to hydrogen peroxide. As seen in Fig. 1, the levels of Cdc25A were not noticeably affected by the treatment of cells with 1 mm hydrogen peroxide. In contrast to the lack of effect seen with Cdc25A, the levels of Cdc25C rapidly decreased following exposure to exogenous hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 2A). This decrease in protein level was evident as soon as 30 min following oxidant challenge. Lower concentrations of hydrogen peroxide were also effective in reducing Cdc25C levels. As noted in Fig. 2B, hydrogen peroxide concentrations as low as 250 μm resulted in noticeable decreases in Cdc25C levels. Given that under these conditions Cdc25A and Cdc25C were expressed off the same heterologous promoter, the most likely explanation for these results is that hydrogen peroxide results in a change in protein stability. To further confirm this finding, we measured protein stability of wild type Cdc25C in the presence or absence of hydrogen peroxide. Pulse-chase analysis demonstrated that protein half-life was significantly reduced in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 2C). Similar results were also observed with endogenous protein. As seen in Fig. 2D, the levels of endogenous Cdc25C fell significantly following brief oxidative stress.Figure 2Effects of hydrogen peroxide on Cdc25C levels.A, cells were exposed to 1 mmhydrogen peroxide and harvested at the indicated times.

In particular, the treatment of cells with caffeine, an agent that inhibits Chk1 activity, blocked UV-mediated Cdc25A degradation. To test whether similar mechanisms existed for oxidant-induced Cdc25C-mediated degradation, we treated cells with caffeine prior to hydrogen peroxide treatment. As evident in Fig. 3A, caffeine treatment had no effect on hydrogen peroxide-mediated destruction of Cdc25C. To further pursue this notion, we made use of the fact that serine 216 is a site of Chk1 phosphorylation on Cdc25C. Therefore, we next analyzed the effects of hydrogen peroxide on a Cdc25C site-directed mutant that replaced serine 216 with an alanine residue. Although for unclear reasons the S216A mutant ran with an appreciably faster electrophoretic mobility than wild type (WT) protein, the mutant retained sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide-induced degradation (Fig. 3B). A structural analysis of Cdc25 family members has demonstrated that the active site cysteine is able to form an intramolecular disulfide bond with another invariant cysteine residue (15Fauman E.B. Cogswell J.P. Lovejoy B. Rocque W.J. Holmes W. Montana V.G. Piwnica-Worms H. Rind M.J. Saper M.A. Cell. 1998; 93: 617-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 16Reynolds R.A. Yem A.W. Wolfe C.L. Deibel M.R. Chidester C.G. Watenpaugh K.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). For the case of Cdc25C, the active site cysteine is at position 377 and the other invariant cysteine is at position 330. To assess whether in vitro hydrogen peroxide treatment was sufficient to induce disulfide bond formation, we measured the electrophoretic mobility of bacterially expressed WT Cdc25C protein in a non-reducing gel. As seen in Fig. 4A, consistent with disulfide bond formation, wild type Cdc25C that was exposed in vitro to as little as 10 μm hydrogen peroxide had a noticeable shift in electrophoretic mobility. The addition of the reducing agent DTT reversed these changes in mobility. A similar analysis with a cysteine to serine mutation at position 330 resulted in a protein that is incapable of disulfide bond formation. An analysis of this protein demonstrated that, as expected, there was no detectable mobility shift in a non-reducing gel in response to in vitro hydrogen peroxide exposure (Fig. 4B). We next sought to further assess the role of cysteine 330 and cysteine 377 in the hydrogen peroxide-mediated degradation of Cdc25C. To attempt these studies, we created full-length single (position 330 or 377) and double (positions 330 and 377) cysteine mutants. As seen in Fig. 5A, the levels of these expressed proteins varied dramatically in transfected cells. Whereas the levels of wild type and the C2 mutant were similar, the levels of the 330 and especially the 377 mutant were significantly reduced. Because for all these mutants, expression was derived from an identical heterologous promoter, the differences in protein levels presumably reflect inherent differences in stability. To confirm this observation, we directly measured protein half-life with pulse-chase analysis. As it is evident in Fig. 5B, both single cysteine mutants were significantly less stable than the wild type protein. In contrast, the double mutant appeared slightly more stable than the wild type Cdc25C under these conditions. We next assessed the effects of the single or double cysteine mutants on protein stability following hydrogen peroxide treatment. As seen in Fig. 6, as expected, the exposure of cells to hydrogen peroxide led to a dramatic fall in the level of wild type Cdc25C. Qualitatively, similar results were seen with the 330 mutant, although the initial levels were substantially less. Levels of the 377 were so low under basal conditions that it was difficult to assess the effects of hydrogen peroxide. Finally, in contrast to either wild type protein or the single cysteine mutants, the levels of the C2 mutant did not change significantly following hydrogen peroxide challenge. To further pursue the physiological relevance of the intramolecular disulfide bond in Cdc25C, we were intrigued by the observation that in our experimental conditions both the S216A mutant and the C2 mutant had significantly faster electrophoretic mobility on standard SDS-PAGE analysis. Given that the S216A mutant cannot bind 14-3-3 protein, we wondered whether the C2 mutant might also have altered 14-3-3 binding. Perhaps even more physiologically relevant, given that the wild type protein can apparently adopt an open configuration when reduced and a closed disulfide bond-containing configuration when oxidized, we wondered whether such conformational shifts could regulate 14-3-3 interactions. To begin testing this hypothesis, we measured the in vitro interaction of wild type Cdc25C and the C2 mutant with 14-3-3 under both non-reducing and reducing conditions. As seen in Fig. 7, under non-reducing conditions, wild type Cdc25C was able to interact with 14-3-3. Interestingly, if Cdc25C was exposed to DTT to produce a fully reduced form, no interaction with 14-3-3 was detected. This observation suggests that in the open enzymatically active state, the interaction of Cdc25C with 14-3-3 proteins is significantly reduced. To further validate this conjecture, we measured the interaction of the C2 mutant with 14-3-3 proteins. This mutant is unable to form an intramolecular disulfide bond and hence should always be locked in the open configuration. As seen in Fig. 7, in the presence or absence of DTT, there is no apparent interaction of the C2 mutant with 14-3-3. These results suggest that in vitro, the reduced or open configuration of Cdc25C has a significantly attenuated capacity to interact with 14-3-3. Previous evidence in Xenopus and human cells suggest that the binding of 14-3-3 represents an important regulatory mechanism for Cdc25C and that it is responsible in part for maintaining the protein in the cytosol (7Dalal S.N.

Another mechanism for localization is the leptomycin B-sensitive export of the protein from the nucleus. Both mechanisms contribute to the regulation of Cdc25C subcellular distribution (9Graves P.R. Lovly C.M. Uy G.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Oncogene. 2000; 20: 1839-1851Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To understand whether the results demonstrated in Fig. 7 play a role in vivo, we reasoned that because the C2 mutant would have reduced or absent the binding to 14-3-3, the localization of this mutant should be significantly more dependent on the remaining intact leptomycin B-sensitive nuclear export pathway. As demonstrated in Fig. 8, A and B, under normal conditions in unsynchronized cells, both wild type and C2 mutant forms of Cdc25C had a predominantly cytosolic localization. The treatment with leptomycin B, which in time renders localization solely dependent on 14-3-3 binding, results in a shift in wild type protein distribution to include both a nuclear and cytoplasmic localization. In contrast, under these leptomycin treatment conditions, the C2 mutant was predominantly nuclear (see Fig. 8, C and D). These results are consistent with the C2 mutant being more dependent than wild type Cdc25C on leptomycin B-dependent export. In addition, it has been recently demonstrated that leptomycin B-dependent nuclear export can also be inhibited by oxidant challenge such as hydrogen peroxide treatment (20Saydam N. Georgiev O. Nakano M.Y. Greber U.F. Schaffner W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25487-25495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Similarly, we found that hydrogen peroxide treatment resulted in increased C2 nuclear accumulation when compared with wild type protein (data not shown). Checkpoint control in response to environmental stresses represents a fundamental mechanism to protect genomic integrity. The family of Cdc25 phosphatases represents an essential component in checkpoint control as well as in normal cell cycle progression. Our data suggest that a rise in intracellular hydrogen peroxide is sufficient to induce the degradation of Cdc25C protein, and that this oxidant-mediated degradation requires the presence of two reactive cysteine residues within the protein. In the absence of these two critical cysteine residues, the protein is not subject to oxidant-mediated degradation. In addition, our data suggest that the presence of an intramolecular disulfide within the protein may also be important for the interaction of Cdc25C with 14-3-3 protein, because the C2 mutant is unable to bind 14-3-3 in vitro and under certain conditions has altered subcellular localization in vivo. Therefore, these data suggest that wild type Cdc25C may potentially regulate its interaction with 14-3-3 in a disulfide-dependent manner. An analysis of single cysteine mutants reveals that these constructs have decreased protein stability. Generally, it is believed that oxidation of a cysteine beyond the sulfenic form is unstable. One practical role for an intramolecular disulfide bond therefore would be to protect the active site cysteine from an irreversible oxidation. In particular, if the active site cysteine is oxidized to a sulfenic ion, subsequent disulfide bond formation with cysteine 330 could rescue the protein and prevent the formation of a terminal sulfinic species. Under these conditions (see Fig. 9), mutants that lack either cysteine 330 or 377 would in turn lack this protective mechanism. Interestingly, it has recently been observed that some low molecular tyrosine phosphatases can also form intramolecular disulfide bonds following direct hydrogen peroxide treatment or after growth factor induced hydrogen peroxide generation (21Chiarugi P. Fiaschi T. Taddei M.L. Talini D. Giannoni E. Raugei G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33478-33487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In these cases, oxidation leads to disulfide bond formation and enzymatic inactivation, suggesting that redox regulation through disulfide bond formation may be a common mechanism for regulating the activity of both protein tyrosine phosphatases and dual-specific phosphatases. Numerous studies have demonstrated that oxidative stress induces cell cycle arrest often but not always at the G2/M checkpoint (22Flattery-O'Brien J.A. Dawes I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8564-8571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Arrington E.D. Caldwell M.C. Kumaravel T.S. Lohani A. Joshi A. Evans M.K. Chen H.T. Nussenzweig A.

Blood. 2001; 98: 3315-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The observation that the binding of 14-3-3 to Cdc25C at least in vitro is dependent on whether or not Cdc25C is reduced or oxidized, raising the possibility that redox regulation of the phosphatase activity may be important for normal cell cycle regulation. Several previous lines of evidence have indirectly raised this possibility. For instance, earlier reports have demonstrated that the disulfide reductase thioredoxin is able to rescue mouse embryos arrested in mitosis at the two-cell stage (25Natsuyama S. Noda Y. Yamashita M. Nagahama Y. Mori T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1176: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The exogenous addition of thioredoxin under these conditions increases cyclin-dependent kinases activity, consistent with thioredoxin potentially regulating Cdc25C activity. In addition, in plants there appears to be a glutathione-dependent checkpoint, although the precise mediator of this checkpoint remains unknown (26den Boer B.G.W. Murray J.A.H. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Finally, an analysis of antioxidants as a function of cell cycle in mammalian cells revealed that the levels of glutathione rise dramatically in M-phase to levels ∼3-fold higher then in S-phase (27Li N. Oberley T.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 148-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The basis for this increase in cellular-reducing equivalents is again unknown. To date, there is no evidence to suggest that such a rise in glutathione levels is essential for G2/M progression. Nonetheless, it is tempting to speculate that such a rise might be important to maintain Cdc25C in the reduced and hence active form. Finally, a number of questions remain unanswered. Presently, it is unclear why the effects of oxidants are specific for the Cdc25C isoform. This is particularly unclear, because all other members of the Cdc25 phosphatase family have a similar cysteine configuration and have been shown to be able to undergo disulfide bond formation (15Fauman E.B. Cogswell J.P. Lovejoy B. Rocque W.J. Holmes W. Montana V.G. Piwnica-Worms H. Rind M.J. Saper M.A. Cell. 1998; 93: 617-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 16Reynolds R.A. Yem A.W. Wolfe C.L. Deibel M.R. Chidester C.G. Watenpaugh K.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These differences in sensitivity may relate to whether the protein in vivo exists predominantly in an open or closed configuration. In general, only the open fully reduced protein would be predicted to undergo a significant amount of oxidant-mediated degradation. In addition, differences in the reactivity of the active site cysteine or the other invariant cysteine in Cdc25A versus Cdc25C may play a role in this observed specificity to oxidant challenge. Similarly, although the levels of Cdc25C declines dramatically following hydrogen peroxide treatment, to date the treatment of cells with either proteasomal inhibitors or with inhibitors of lysosomal degradation do not appear to rescue the protein. 2P. A. Savitsky and T. Finkel, unpublished observations. Thus, the mechanism by which Cdc25C is degraded remains unclear. Nonetheless, these results do strengthen the conclusion that the destruction of Cdc25C by oxidants differs significantly from either the UV or ionizing radiation-induced degradation of Cdc25A, which is proteasomal-dependent (10Mailand N.

Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Future studies addressing these and other related issues should hopefully provide significant insight into how oxidative stress regulates cell cycle arrest and what role the intracellular redox state plays in normal cell cycle progression.

After completion of the C. elegans genome, two additional homologous genes were identified, which comprised a gene family of nine distinct putative polypeptide GalNAc-transferases (2Hassan H.

It is predicted that most of the mammalian GalNAc-transferase isoforms have different functions. Analysis of mammalian polypeptide GalNAc-transferases has demonstrated that different isoforms have different kinetic properties, and unique substrate specificities have been identified for many isoenzymes (2Hassan H.

Kurosaka A. Glycoconj. J. 1999; 16: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Some isoforms can be classified into subfamilies of closely homologous GalNAc-transferases, and as shown for the human subfamily composed of GalNAc-T3 and -T6, such isoforms share unique kinetic properties (10Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Mandel U. Hollingsworth M.A. Akisawa N. Ikematsu Y. Merkx G. Geurts van Kessel A. Olofsson S. Clausen H. J. Biol.

Our understanding of the enzymatic functions of individual GalNAc-transferase isoforms is mainly derived from in vitro studies. The limited number ofin vivo studies have confirmed the in vitroresults (14Nehrke K. Hagen F.K. Tabak L.A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15de Haan C.A.

In addition to different enzymatic properties, each isoform has different cell and tissue expression patterns. Despite these findings, it is still not possible to define the in vivo catalytic functions of individual GalNAc-transferase isoforms with respect to characteristic acceptor sequence motifs, range of acceptor proteins, and in vivo biological function. Thus, definition of specific in vivo functions for unique GalNAc-transferase isoforms remains to be defined. It is presently unclear why such a large enzyme family evolved early and to what degree the diversity and number of genes reflects redundancy rather than functional requirements. The existence of large and similarly numerous GalNAc-transferase gene families in nematodes, insects, and mammals suggests that there is a profound functional requirement for multiple enzymatic isoforms and implies that important biological functions are associated with individual isoforms. This hypothesis is supported by studies of mannosyl-O-glycosylation in yeast, where multiple polypeptide O-mannosyltransferases were found to be essential for growth and survival of yeast cells (17Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The first gene ablation of a putative GalNAc-transferase in mice did not lead to significant phenotypic changes, although it is still unproven that a functional GalNAc-transferase gene was targeted (18Hennet T. Hagen F.K. Tabak L.A. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12070-12074Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). A recent preliminary report on targeted inactivation of the murine GalNAc-T1 gene found evidence of minor changes in O-glycosylation (19Westerman E.L. Ellies L.G. Hagen F.K. Marek K. Sutton-Smith M. Dell A. Tabak L.A. Marth J.D. Glycobiology. 1999; 9 (Abstr. 80): 1121Google Scholar). One explanation for the finding that there are only minor phenotypes associated with inactivation of single polypeptide GalNAc-transferases may be deduced from phylogenetic analyses of the GalNAc-transferase gene family, which indicates the existence of subfamilies of closely related genes that are hypothesized to provide functional redundancy (2Hassan H.

It remains to be determined whether individual GalNAc-transferase isoforms have unique functions in vivo that are conserved through evolution, as suggested by sequence analysis indicating conservation of subfamilies. Recent genetic studies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster have extended our understanding of glycan synthesis and functions in developmental biology. The signaling moleculeFringe is a glycosyltransferase that determines dorso-ventral cell interactions during wing formation through modulation of Notch receptor activity (20Irvine K.D. Wieschaus E.

A developmental disorder resulting in rotated abdomen of adult flies is assigned to a defect in the putative polypeptideO-mannosyltransferase encoded by the rt gene (23Martin-Blanco E. Garcia-Bellido A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6048-6052Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar,24Jurado L.A. Coloma A. Cruces J. Genomics. 1999; 58: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Flores and Engels (25Flores C. Engels W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2964-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have reported that a gene homologous to mammalian polypeptide GalNAc-transferases, the l(2)35Aagene, is likely to be essential for development of D. melanogaster. Transgenic flies expressing an ectopic 5-kb fragment containing the l(2)35Aa gene were found to be viable and fertile (25Flores C. Engels W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2964-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The 5-kb rescue fragment contains essentially only one predicted intact open reading frame, and this encodes a protein with homology to GalNAc-transferases. In this report, sequence analysis of three lethal l(2)35Aa alleles showed alterations in the putative GalNAc-transferase coding region of l(2)35Aa. Combined with data showing that the l(2)35Aa gene in fact encodes a functional GalNAc-transferase, this represents the first example of a polypeptide GalNAc-transferase gene conclusively shown to play an essential role in normal development of an organism. Why is a single GalNAc-transferase isoform essential to development in an organism having 13–15 putative GalNAc-transferase genes? To address this question, we have classified the phylogenic traits of GalNAc-transferase families in the nematode, fly, and mammals. A survey of the completed genome of Drosophila led to identification of 13–15 putative GalNAc-transferase genes. Phylogenetic analysis of the putative catalytic domains of the homologous mammalian, C. elegans, and Drosophila genes indicated a common horizontal pattern of evolution of GalNAc-transferases with a variable degree of species specific gene duplications and divergence. The prediction of evolutionary conservation of subfamilies of GalNAc-transferase genes was confirmed by functional analysis of members of two distinct subfamilies found in Drosophila and humans. In both cases, the subfamilies were shown to encode enzymes with unique and identical functions. These data provide strong evidence for an evolutionary conservation of distinct kinetic properties and substrate specificities within GalNAc-transferase subfamilies. ThedGalNAc-T1 fly gene l(2)35Aa is the first GalNAc-transferase gene shown to have a required function in vivo. The orthologous human GalNAc-T11 is predicted to have important in vivo functions. Human GalNAc-T11 displayed a unique expression pattern that was largely limited to kidney. tBLASTn analysis with human GalNAc-transferases was used to search the entire D. melanogaster genome released by the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (26Adams M.D. Celniker S.E.

Multiple sequence alignments were revised for maximal residue conservation and minimal gaps in conserved amino acid sequence motifs. Distance analyses of the amino acid alignments were performed using the PHYLIP software package with PAM250 substitution matrix of PROTDIST, and phylograms were generated using neighbor joining and least square algorithms with 1000 bootstrap replicates (51Felsenstein J. PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference Package), Version 3.573c. Department of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA1986Google Scholar). The l(2)35Aa gene was originally identified and sequenced in a detailed analysis of the genomicAdh region of D. melanogaster chromosome 2 (30Ashburner M. Misra S. Roote J. Lewis S.E. Blazej R.

EST clones LD24449 and SD08641 representing l(2)35AacDNA (5′-EST GenBank™ accession numbers AA941044 and AI542350) were obtained from Research Genetics. An open reading frame of 1896 base pairs as well as the sequence of the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of l(2)35Aa mRNA was represented in both clones and fully sequenced. The coding region of l(2)35Aa was previously found to be organized in one exon (30Ashburner M. Misra S. Roote J. Lewis S.E. Blazej R. Davis T. Doyle C. Galle R. George R. Harris N. Hartzell G.

Confirmatory sequencing was performed on a genomic clone obtained by PCR (35 cycles at 95 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 15 s, and 68 °C for 2 min 30 s) on D. melanogaster (Canton S) genomic DNA (CLONTECH) with the sense primer TSHC1 (5′-AGCGGATCCATGATGCAAATCAAGC-3′) and the antisense primer TSHC3 (5′-AGCGGATCCTCGCTCACAGCGCCTTGTCCG-3′). The gene CG6394 was identified and sequenced in the D. melanogaster genome sequence project. Embryonal D. melanogaster cDNA was generated using the SMART RACE cDNA Amplification Kit with embryonal poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA fordGalNAc-T2 was obtained by PCR (25 cycles at 95 °C for 10 s; 54 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 2 min 30 s) with primer pair TSHC254 (5′-CTGGCCACCTAGACACGTC-3′) and TSHC263 (5′-GATCCATTCCTTGATCCTC-3′). An open reading frame of 1773 base pairs as well as partial sequences of the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of CG6394 mRNA were cloned into pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen) and fully sequenced. The predicted mammalian orthologs ofdGalNAc-T2, human and rodent GalNAc-T7, were reported previously (9Ten Hagen K.G. Tetaert D. Hagen F.K. Richet C. Beres T.M. Gagnon J. Balys M.M. VanWuyckhuyse B.

A novel human gene designated GALNT11, predicted to represent an ortholog of dGalNAc-T1, was originally identified in the course of a positional cloning approach to isolate the DNA repair gene XRCC2 (31Tambini C.E. George A.M. Rommens J.M. Tsui L.C. Scherer S.W. Thacker J. Genomics. 1997; 41: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A cDNA clone (cDNA25L) containing a partial open reading frame with sequence similarity to human polypeptide GalNAc-transferases was found. Based on the sequence of cDNA25L, primers EBHC600 (5′-AGCGGATCCAACACACAACTCTTTGCGGCTG-3′) and EBHC602 (5′-AGCGGATCCGACAAAAATGGGTTGTTGGGG-3′) were designed and used in a PCR strategy to screen a gastric λgt11 cDNA library (MKN45) using the rapid cDNA library screening procedure previously described (5Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17006-17012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In brief, using a combination of λ-vector primers and EBHC600 or EBHC602, 20 aliquots derived from a MKN45 cDNA library were screened by PCR. Three sublibraries (numbers 19, 7, and 13) were found to contain clones with 2-, 1.5-, and 0.8-kbp inserts, respectively. PCR products were blunt end-cloned and sequenced. The 3′ sequence contained an in-frame stop codon, and the 5′ sequences contained a potential open reading, including both a hydrophobic transmembrane domain and an in-frame initiating methionine codon that was downstream of a Kozak sequence. Using the human sequence as a query for BLASTn analysis of the dEST data base, one single murine EST clone (GenBankTM accession AA104499), predicted to represent an orthologous isoform, was identified, and the full coding region was sequenced. The murine open reading frame predicted a protein sequence with 87% identity to the human protein, which is in agreement with other rodent-human orthologs. The genomic organization of humanGALNT11 was determined from a P1 clone DMPC-HFF#1–1321(E8) (P114808) isolated from a human foreskin genomic library (DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co. Human Foreskin Fibroblast P1 Library) using the primer pair EBHC616 (5′-GCGAATTCAGTGAAGTGACTCAGCCAC-3′)/EBHC619 (5′-CACGACTGTCTATCACATCGTC-3′) for screening. The entire sequence of the open reading frame, compiled from the cDNA sequence, was sequenced. During the course of this study, a human genomic PAC clone, RP5-98107 (GenBankTM accession number AC006017), was sequenced, and an open reading frame for a homologous putative GalNAc-transferase was identified (GenBankTM accession number AAD45821). This sequence is identical to the sequence reported here as well as to a recently deposited cDNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number AK025287) derived from colon as part of a cDNA sequencing project. An expression construct encoding amino acid residues 40–632 of dGalNAc-T1 was prepared by PCR usingD. melanogaster genomic DNA and the primer pair TSHC2 (5′-AGCGGATCCTCGCTCACAGCGCCTTGTCCG-3′) and TSHC3 with BamHI restriction sites. A dGalNAc-T2 expression construct encoding amino acid residues 39–591 was prepared by PCR using pCR4-CG6394 and the primer pair TSHC264 (5′-CAGCGGATCCAGGAGGCGTATCACACG-3′) and TSHC265 (5′-GAGCGAATTCTTACCAGCGTGGGCGTATC-3′) with BamHI andEcoRI restriction sites, respectively. Expression constructs of the secreted forms (amino acids 32–608) of the putative human and murine GALNT11 genes were prepared using the following primer set for the human construct: EBHC629 (5′-GCGAATTCGTGAAGTGACTCAGCCACTTAAG-3′) and EBHC631 (5′-GCGGAATTCCACCTTAACCTTCCAAATGC-3′); and the following for the murine construct: EBHC711 (5′-GCGGAATTCGTGAAGTGACTCAGCCCCTTAGG-3′) and EBHC710 (5′-GCGGAATTCAATTATGTTGTGTCCAGCCAGGG-3′). MKN45 mRNA was used as template for human RT-PCR, whereas cDNA from the identified EST clone (GenBankTM accession number AA104499) was used as template for the murine PCR. The products were cloned into the vector pAcGP67 (Pharmingen) and fully sequenced. Plasmids pAcGP67-dGalNAc-T1-sol, pAcGP67-dGalNAc-T2-sol, and pAcGP67-GalNAc-T11-sol were cotransfected with Baculo-Gold™ DNA (PharMingen), and recombinant baculovirus was obtained after two successive amplifications in Sf9 cells, as described previously (5Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17006-17012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Assays were performed with media harvested 3 days after infection of Sf9 cells, or when indicated with enzymes purified from infected High Five™ cells grown in serum-free media (Invitrogen). Purification was performed essentially as described previously with consecutive ion exchange chromatographies as described below (32Wandall H.H. Hassan H. Mirgorodskaya E. Kristensen A.K.

Quantification of enzyme protein concentration was performed by comparative SDS-PAGE Coomassie-stained gels using bovine serum albumin and transferrin as standards. Enzyme activities were analyzed by two methods: (i) initial velocity assays where consumption of substrates was limited to less than 10% and (ii) a product development assay where the reactions were exhaustive/terminal using two additions of enzyme and sugar nucleotides in order to evaluate the final number of acceptor sites utilized by the enzymes. Standard reaction mixture (50-μl final volume) contained 25 mm cacodylate (pH 7.4), 10 mmMnCl2, 0.25% Triton X-100, 100–200 μmUDP-[14C]GalNAc (2000 cpm/nmol) (Amersham Biosciences), and 0.006–800 μm acceptor peptides. Products were quantified by scintillation counting after chromatography on Dowex 1X8. In assays designed to determine acceptor sites in peptides used by the various isoforms, the reaction mixtures were modified to include 1.7 mm cold UDP-GalNAc (Sigma). Reactions were incubated for 12 h, followed by the addition of 50% more enzyme and UDP-GalNAc and a 4-h incubation. The glycosylation as determined by moles of GalNAc incorporated into peptide was monitored at 2–4-h intervals by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as previously described (33Hassan H. Reis C.A.

Partial purification was performed by consecutive chromatography on Amberlite IRA-95, DEAE-Sephacryl, and SP-Sepharose essentially as described (32Wandall H.H. Hassan H. Mirgorodskaya E.

The purification scheme does not involve affinity chromatography, and a low level endogenous activity secreted from insect cells can be found, depending on substrates. MALDI mass spectrometry of glycosylated peptides was performed on a Voyager-Elite MALDI time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA), equipped with delayed extraction. The MALDI matrix was 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid 10 g/liter (Aldrich) dissolved in a 2:1 mixture of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 30% aqueous acetonitrile (Rathburn). Samples dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to a concentration of ∼2 pmol/ml were prepared for analysis by placing 1 μl of sample solution on a probe tip followed by 1 μl of matrix. All mass spectra were obtained in the linear mode. Data processing was carried out using GRAM/386 software. Acceptor sites utilized were determined in MUC1-, MUC4-, and EA2-derived peptides as follows: Glycopeptide products of exhaustive reactio"
https://openalex.org/W2016406151,"BRCA1 is a tumor suppressor with several important nuclear functions. BRCA1 has no known cytoplasmic functions. We show here that the two previously identified nuclear localization signals (NLSs) are insufficient for nuclear localization of BRCA1 due to the opposing action of an NH2-terminal nuclear export signal. In transfected breast cancer cells, BRCA1 nuclear localization requires both the NLSs and NH2-terminal RING domain region; mutating either of these sequences shifts BRCA1 to the cytoplasm. The BRCA1 RING element mediates nuclear import via association with BARD1, and this is not affected by cancer-associated RING mutations. Moreover, BARD1 directly masks the BRCA1 nuclear export signal, and the resulting block to nuclear export is requisite for efficient import and nuclear localization of ectopic and endogenous BRCA1. Our results explain why BRCA1 exon 11 splice variants, which lack the NLSs but retain the RING domain, are frequently detected in the nucleus and in nuclear foci in vivo. In fact, co-expression of BARD1 promoted formation of DNA damage-induced nuclear foci comprising ectopic wild-type or NLS-deficient BRCA1, implicating BARD1 in nuclear targeting of BRCA1 for DNA repair. Our identification of BARD1 as a BRCA1 nuclear chaperone has regulatory implications for its reported effects on BRCA1 protein stability, ubiquitin ligase activity, and DNA repair.

BRCA1 contains two SV40-like nuclear localization signals (NLSs1;503KRKRRP508 and606PKKNRLRRKS615) that facilitate nuclear import by the importin α/β receptor pathway (10Chen C.-F., Li, S. Chen Y.

Although BRCA1 locates predominantly to the nucleus, it contains an NH2-terminal nuclear export signal (NES) and can shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm (12Rodriguez J.A. Henderson B.R. J. Biol.

Given the importance of nuclear targeting for BRCA1 function, we have searched for alternative BRCA1 nuclear import pathways that act independent of its nuclear import signals. In this study, we show that transiently expressed BRCA1 splice variant and full-length forms of BRCA1 that lack an NLS can enter the nucleus. This novel NLS-independent import process is dependent on the NH2-terminal RING domain region of BRCA1, a sequence well conserved in all BRCA1 splice variants. The RING-mediated import pathway is facilitated by the BRCA1-binding partner, BARD1. BARD1 not only translocates BRCA1 into the nucleus, but retains it there by masking its nuclear export signal, which lies buried within the BRCA1-BARD1 binding interface (31Brzovic P.S. Rajagopal P. Hoyt D.W. King M.C. Klevit R.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Our findings identify a key “chaperone” role for BARD1 in promoting BRCA1 nuclear entry and formation of DNA damage-inducible BRCA1 nuclear foci, and provide an explanation for the DNA damage response observed for cellular BRCA1 splice variants (30Huber L.J. Yang T.W. Sarkisian C.J. Master S.R. Deng C.X. Chodosh L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4005-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), which contains a RING domain but no NLS sequence. Our results also help resolve much of the controversy concerning BRCA1 subcellular localization, and shed light on a new and unexpected regulatory role of BARD1. MCF-7 and T47D human breast cancer cells, and HBL100 immortalized human breast epithelial cells, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. All cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were seeded onto sterile glass coverslips and transfected at 50–60% confluency with 1 to 2 μg of plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 6 h post-transfection, the transfection mixture was removed and replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were fixed and processed 30 h post-transfection for fluorescence microscopy. When required, transfected cells were treated with leptomycin B at a final concentration of 6 ng/ml for 4 h prior to fixation. Construction of the expression vectors pF-BRCA1, pYFP-BRCA1, pYFP-BRCA1(Δ306–1312), pBRCA1-NESm, pBRCA1(Δ1–70), and pYFP-CRM1 were described previously (12Rodriguez J.A. Henderson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38589-38596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The YFP cDNA was excised as aNotI fragment from the above YFP-fusion constructs to create untagged pBRCA1(Δ306–1312), pBRCA1(Δ1–70), and pBRCA1-NESm plasmids. To create pF-CRM1, the CRM1 cDNA was excised from the CRM1.pET16b plasmid (provided by Dr. M. Yoshida, Tokyo) and inserted into the pFlag-CMV2 vector (Eastman Kodak Co.) as aKpnI/BamHI fragment. We used a PCR strategy to introduce site-directed mutations into the two nuclear localization signals of BRCA1 cDNA. The first PCR introduced mutations into NLS1 in wild-type BRCA1 using primers MF1 (forward) and MF2 (reverse; codons in bold represent the amino acids Lys503, Arg504, Lys505, and Arg506 that were mutated to alanine). The primer sequences are shown in Table I. A second overlapping PCR product was generated using primers MF6 (forward) and MF7 (reverse). The two DNA products (MF1/2 and MF6/7) were then annealed and amplified with primers MF1 and MF7, and the resulting PCR fragment was gel purified and inserted into wild-type BRCA1 as anAflII/KpnI fragment, to generate pBRCA1-NLSm1.Table ISequence of the oligonucleotides used in plasmid constructionPlasmidOligonucleotide5′→3′ sequenceBRCA1-NLSmMF1CACTCCAAATCAGTAGAGMF2GCCTGATGTAGGTCTCGCTGCAGCCGCTAATTTATTTGTGAGGGGMF3AAGCACCTAAAGCGAATGCGCTGGCGGCGAAGTCTTCTACCAGGCMF5TATCAATTTGCAATTCAGMF6ATCGGAAGAAGGCAAGCCMF7CTAGAGTGCTAACTTCCCBRCA1(C61G)BH986TCTGCAGCGGCCGCCTCGAGAATGGATTTATCTGCTCTTBH9865GGGCCTTCACAGGGTCCTTTATGTAAGBH9849TTGACTAAAACGCGTACTTTCTTGTAGBH9832AACGGTATCTTCAGABRCA1-(1–304)MF17AATTCGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAGTGACATMF18CGATGTCACTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCGBRCA1(NESmC)MF14CTAGCCTTGTTGAAGAGCTATTGAAAATCATTTGTGCTTTTCAGCTTGACACAGGTTTGCMF15TAGCCCAACCTGTGTCAAGCTGAAAAGCACAAATGATTTTCAATAGCTCTTCAACAAGCBARD1(Δ1–95)JR35TACTAAGCGGCCGCCTTGAAGATAAATAGACBH9882GTGGGCACTGGAGTGGCA Open table in a new tab BRCA1-NLSm1 was used as template for two PCR reactions using primers MF3 (forward) and MF7 (reverse), where the codons in bold in the MF3 sequence represent amino acids Lys608, Arg610, Arg612, and Arg613 changed to alanine. A second PCR (primers MF1 and MF5) was annealed with the first and amplified with primers MF1 and MF7. This large PCR fragment was inserted into wild-type BRCA1 as anAflII/KpnI fragment. This finally generated the plasmid pBRCA1-NLSm, which contains mutations in the two BRCA1 NLSs. A PCR-based strategy was also used to introduce the C61G mutation into the RING domain of BRCA1. Two PCR fragments were generated. First, we PCR amplified a fragment at the NH2 terminus of wild-type BRCA1, using primers BH986 (forward) and BH9849 (reverse, see Table I). A second PCR product was amplified with primers BH9865 (forward) and BH9832 (reverse). In the BH9865 sequence, the codon in bold represents the C61G amino acid mutation. The two PCR products were annealed and amplified with BH986 and BH9832 to generate a fragment that was inserted into pCR-SCRIPT-BRCA1 (provided by Dr. J. Holt, Nashville) as a NotI/AatII fragment. The NotI restriction site is underlined in the BH986 sequence (see Table I). ANotI/EcoRI fragment containing the C61G mutation was then subcloned into pF-BRCA1 to produce pBRCA1(C61G). pBRCA1-(1–304) was made by replacing theEcoRI/ClaI fragment of BRCA1 cDNA with a 27-bp linker sequence, generated by annealing the two oligonucleotides MF17 and MF18. The EcoRI and ClaI restriction sites are underlined in the oligonucleotide sequences (see Table I). pBRCA1(NESmC) is a mutant in which the BRCA1 NES (two annealed complimentary oligonucleotides MF14 and MF15) was inserted in-frame into the NheI site (underlined in MF14 and MF15) of pBRCA1-NESm (see Table I). To inactivate the nuclear export signal in pBRCA1-NLSm, pBRCA1(Δ306–1312), and pBRCA1-(1–304), a BRCA1 mutated NES sequence (L86A,I90A) was subcloned as aNotI/EcoRI fragment into these constructs (see Fig. 1A). Full-length BARD1 cDNA and CtIP cDNA were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector, pFlag-CMV2, asNotI/XbaI and NotI/NheI fragments, respectively. An NH2-terminal deletion mutant of BARD1-(Δ1–95) was created by replacing aNotI/NheI DNA fragment from the BARD1 cDNA with a PCR fragment generated with the oligonucleotides, JR35 (forward primer) and BH9882 (reverse primer). The NotI restriction site is underlined in the JR35 sequence (Table I). YFP-tagged BRCA1-NLSm and CtIP expression vectors were generated by inserting the YFP cDNA as a NotI fragment (in-frame) at the 5′ end of the cDNA. The YFP gene was also inserted into the pFlag-CMV2 vector as a NotI fragment to generate the expression plasmid referred to as “YFP” in Fig. 3D. All plasmid mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Immunostaining was carried out as described (12Rodriguez J.A. Henderson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38589-38596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Cells expressing YFP-tagged proteins were fixed in 3.7% formalin/phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature, washed, and then mounted for direct detection of the autofluorescent protein. Untagged ectopic BRCA1 was detected by immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies Ab-1 and Ab-4 (Oncogene Research), which recognize an epitope in the amino terminus and the central portion of BRCA1, respectively. BRCA1-bound antibody was detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Sigma). BARD1, HA-c-Myc, p53, and HA-Rad51 were detected with polyclonal antibodies 699D (20Jin Y., Xu, X.L. Yang M.-C.W. Wei F. Ayi T.-C. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rb was detected with the monoclonal antibody anti-Rb 14001A (Pharminogen) diluted 1:300 in blocking solution, respectively. Antibody bound to BARD1, c-Myc, p53, Rb, or Rad51 was detected with biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz) and Texas Red-avidin D (Vector Laboratories). Cell nuclei were counterstained with the chromosome dye Hoechst 33285 (Sigma). The subcellular localization of each ectopic protein was determined by scoring cells using an Olympus BX40 epifluorescence microscope. Confocal cross-sections were captured using an Optiscan confocal microscope, and image processing and quantification of nuclear fluorescence using the NIH Image software was carried out as previously described (32Henderson B.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Cells expressing YFP-BRCA1 and BARD1 proteins were detected by immunostaining as described above. One hour before fixation the appropriate samples were treated with 0.01% methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). YFP-BRCA1 transfected cells were assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy and scored as containing either no nuclear foci, <10, or >50 BRCA1 nuclear foci. At least 90 YFP-BRCA1 transfected cells were scored. HBL100, MCF-7, and T47D cells were separated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions by using the NE-PER extraction kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were determined using the Bio-Rad dye binding assay. Cell extracts were denatured, separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The Western blot filters were blocked in blocking buffer (1% fetal calf serum, 5% dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20) and probed with the primary antibody. BRCA1 was detected with either the monoclonal antibody Ab-1 diluted 1:200 or Ab-4 diluted 1:200, followed by incubation with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000). BARD1 was detected with either the monoclonal antibody EE#6 (Baer Lab) diluted 1:800 or the polyclonal antibody 42C (17Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A., Xu, X.L. Yang M.C.

This prompted us to re-investigate the contribution of the BRCA1 NLS sequences in nuclear import. We first examined the subcellular localization of two NLS-deficient forms of BRCA1: a deletion mutant (Δ306–1312) that lacks exon 11 and full-length BRCA1 carrying site-directed mutations that inactivate both NLSs (BRCA1-NLSm) (see Fig. 1B). In transfected breast epithelial cells, the localization of ectopic BRCA1 was scored as nuclear (N), nuclear/cytoplasmic (NC), or cytoplasmic (C). Wild-type BRCA1 consistently displayed a mixed nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution (>80% NC) in different cell lines (see Table II and Fig. 1C). In contrast, BRCA1(Δ306–1312) was exclusively cytoplasmic in >90% of MCF-7 and HBL100 cells, but displayed partial nuclear staining in >40% of T47D cells (Table II). BRCA1-NLSm showed a similar distribution pattern to Δ306–1312, confirming that BRCA1 can enter the nucleus, albeit less efficiently, in the absence of an NLS.Table IISubcellular localization of wild-type and mutant forms of BRCA1 in breast epithelial cell linesBRCA1HBL100MCF-7T47D%N%NC%C%N%NC%C%N%NC%CWild type12.283.34.58.285.56.314.882.52.7NESm64.535.5076.123.00.919.577.92.4NLSm03.596.504.695.44.633.562.0NLSm/NESm1.293.35.50.292.96.91.694.63.8Δ306–131204.595.507.792.30.841.457.8Δ306–1312/NESm043.856.2043.556.5065.834.2 Open table in a new tab To test for nuclear import of BRCA1 in the absence of opposing nuclear export activity, we introduced a site-directed NES mutation (L86A and I90A) (12Rodriguez J.A.

https://openalex.org/W2065310164,"Huntington disease is caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine repeat in the Huntingtin protein (Htt) that leads to degeneration of neurons in the central nervous system and the appearance of visible aggregates within neurons. We have developed and tested suppressor polypeptides that bind mutant Htt and interfere with the process of aggregation in cell culture. In a Drosophila model, the most potent suppressor inhibits both adult lethality and photoreceptor neuron degeneration. The appearance of aggregates in photoreceptor neurons correlates strongly with the occurrence of pathology, and expression of suppressor polypeptides delays and limits the appearance of aggregates and protects photoreceptor neurons. These results suggest that targeting the protein interactions leading to aggregate formation may be beneficial for the design and development of therapeutic agents for Huntington disease."

PKC activation by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate induces the disassembly of actin stress fibers concomitant with the appearance of membrane ruffles. PKC also induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation in these cells. As we could show, utilizing the Src-specific inhibitor PP2 and a kinase-deficient c-Src mutant, actin reorganization is dependent on PKC-induced Src activation. Subsequently, the activity of the small G-protein RhoA is decreased, whereas Rac and Cdc42 activities remain unchanged. Disassembly of actin stress fibers could also be observed using the Rho kinase-specific inhibitor Y-27632, indicating that the decrease in RhoA activity on its own is responsible for actin reorganization. In addition, we show that tyrosine phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP is increased upon 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate stimulation, directly linking Src activation to a decrease in RhoA activity.

To provide cell motility and adhesion and to allow cell division, the cell needs a tightly regulated and highly coordinated system of actin polymerization and depolymerization. The Rho (Ras homology) family of small GTP-binding proteins plays a central role in regulating the dynamic modulation of the actin cytoskeleton; the activity of Rho is thought to be responsible for the assembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, whereas Rac is thought to be involved in the generation of lamellipodia and focal complexes, and Cdc42 is thought to be involved in microspike formation (reviewed in Refs. 1Bar-Sagi D.

GTPase-activating protein protein kinase C diacyl glycerol 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate enhanced green fluorescence protein phosphate-buffered saline radioimmune precipitation buffer kinase-inactive Src protein tyrosine phosphatase Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine kinases comprising 10 isoenzymes differing in their molecular domain organization of up to four variable and three constant regions and in their functions. These PKC isoenzymes are subdivided into three classes: (i) the “conventional” PKCs PKCα, PKCβ (βI and βII), and PKCγ, which can be activated by phosphatidylserine, diacyl glycerol (DAG), or phorbolesters through binding to the C-1 domain and Ca2+ through binding to a Ca2+-binding site in their second constant region, C-2; (ii) the “novel” PKCs PKCδ, PKCε, PKCη, and PKCθ lack the C-2 region and thus are calcium-independent but still DAG-, phosphatidylserine-, and phorbolester-responsive; and (iii) the “atypical” PKCs PKCλ/ι and PKCξ also lack the C-2 region and, in addition, are devoid of a functional DAG-binding site; hence they are only responsive to phosphatidylserine but not to DAG or phorbolester (reviewed in Refs. 5Newton A.C.

PKCs reside in the cytosol in an inactive conformation and translocate to the membrane (or other subcellular sites) upon activation where they modify various cellular functions through phosphorylation of target substrates. Among other kinases, PKCs were found to be involved in intracellular signal transduction pathways that regulate cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, and they have been implicated in the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton and migration. PKCs were also described as important regulators of cytoskeletal function in numerous studies (reviewed in Ref. 7Keenan C. Kelleher D. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, PKCθ was described to be essential for the development of actin stress fibers (8Tang S. Morgan K.G. Parker C. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28704-28711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and PKCα was reported to display a positive effect on endothelial cell migration (9Harrington E.O.

The relevance of all these findings for PKC-induced actin reorganization, however, remains mostly unclear. In addition, several groups have described the involvement of atypical, TPA-unresponsive PKC isoforms in migration and cytoskeletal rearrangements (20Coghlan M.P. Chou M.M. Carpenter C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 20: 2880-2889Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 21Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Cell. 2001; 106: 489-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 22Uberall F.

One of the most prominent effects of the TPA-responsive PKC isozymes is the disruption of actin stress fibers and the appearance of ruffles in a wide variety of cells (23Arber S. Barbayannis F.A.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4055-4066Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of this reorganization, however, has yet not been elucidated. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the PKC-induced actin reorganization, we examined the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton upon TPA treatment in the rat aortic smooth muscle cell line A7r5. Our results indicated that the actin reorganization was mediated through PKC-induced activation of Src kinase activity, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP and subsequent down-regulation of Rho activity, whereas Rac and Cdc42 activity remained unaffected. Monoclonal antibodies against Rho1, Rac1, Cdc42, and p190RhoGAP were from Transduction Laboratories. The monoclonal Src antibody (Ab-1) was from Oncogene, and the 2-17 monoclonal Src-specific antibody was a generous gift from Suzanne Simon (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). The phosphotyrosine-specific antibody (pTyr-100) was obtained from Cell Signaling. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the Cy-2-conjugated anti-mouse antibody were from Dianova. TPA, GF109203X, and PP2 were obtained from Calbiochem. Enolase,para-formaldehyde, Triton X-100, and proteinase and phosphatase inhibitors were obtained from Sigma. Alexa 488- and Alexa 568-conjugated phalloidin was obtained from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Polyvinylidene difluoride and nitrocellulose membranes, ECL, and [γ-32P]ATP were from AmershamBiosciences. All of the cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. The vascular smooth muscle cell line A7r5 was used for all experiments. The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. The medium was changed every 3 days. For transfection, A7r5 cells were seeded freshly in glass bottom chamber slides (Nunc) or on glass coverslips (Marienfeld), and transfections were performed after about 24 h of culture or when cells were grown to 50–70% confluence.

Transfected cells were examined 2 days after transfection by confocal laser scanning microscopy or fluorescence microscopy. The cells were seeded on glass coverslips overnight and stimulated with TPA for the indicated time points. The cells were fixed in 4%para-formaldehyde for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 min and washed several times with PBS. The permeabilized cells were incubated with phalloidin for 1 h and washed several times with PBS before imaging. Where indicated, the cells were transfected with Src expression constructs, treated with TPA, fixed, and permeabilized. Src was visualized using 2-17 monoclonal antibody diluted in PBS with 10% goat serum at 1:300 and actin filaments with phalloidin, followed by staining with Cy-2-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in PBS at 1:50. The fluorescent images were recorded on a Zeiss Axioscope equipped with an Axiocam driven by the manufacturer's software package (Zeiss, Vienna, Austria) using a 63× oil immersion lens. Confocal images were taken on a Zeiss Axiovert 35M equipped with a Bio-Rad MRC 600 Argon Laser. The cells were examined in chamber slides (Nunc) using 100× magnification. The images were visualized using the “confocal assistant” software. Affinity precipitations of cellular G-proteins were performed as described previously (28Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

Briefly, A7r5 cells were washed with PBS and lysed on ice in RIPA buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mmNaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmNaF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were centrifuged for 2 min at 14,000 ×g. Cleared lysates were incubated for 45 min at 4 °C with glutathione S-transferase-p21-activated kinase or glutathione S-transferase-rhotekin coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads to precipitate GTP-bound Rac1, Cdc42, or RhoA. The precipitated complexes were washed with RIPA buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer. The total lysates and precipitates were analyzed on Western blot using monoclonal antibodies against Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA (Transduction Laboratories). The proteins reacting with these antibodies were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). c-Src was immunoprecipitated from lysates of stimulated or unstimulated cells prepared in RIPA buffer (see above) using an anti-Src antibody (Ab-1), coupled to protein G-Sepharose. The precipitates were washed three times in RIPA buffer and twice in kinase buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4 as described elsewhere (31Sabe H. Shoelson S.E. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31219-31224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The samples were subjected to in vitro kinase assay in 50 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 5 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mm; AmershamBiosciences) using 2 μg of acid-denatured enolase (Sigma) as a exogenous substrate. The kinase reactions were performed for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped with 10 μl of 6× SDS sample buffer and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (10%) and exposed to x-ray film. Equal volumes of the sample were separated in parallel on an SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis using the anti-Src antibody (Ab-1) to quantitate the levels of c-Src protein. TPA-stimulated or unstimulated cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer, containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mg/ml leupeptine, and 1 mm each phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, NaF, β-glycerophosphate, and Na3VO4. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant was incubated with 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads and 5 μg of anti-p190RhoGAP antibody (Transduction Laboratories) for 4h at 4 °C. Subsequently, the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were released from the beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer and electrophoresed in 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (to detect p190RhoGAP-protein) or nitrocellulose (to detect tyrosine phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP) membranes. The blots were blocked and probed with anti-p190RhoGAP monoclonal antibody or pTyr-100 (Cell Signaling). To investigate the role of PKC in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, we utilized the rat aortic smooth muscle cell line A7r5. These cells express most of the TPA-responsive PKC isozymes (PKCα, PKCβ, PKCδ, PKCη, and PKCθ) (32Fukumoto S. Nishizawa Y. Hosoi M. Koyama H. Yamakawa K. Ohno S. Morii H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13816-13822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In addition, they show a well developed actin stress fiber network, crossing the whole cell body when resting (Fig1 A). Upon PKC activation via TPA stimulation, a complete reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton could be observed. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the visible disassembly of the actin stress fibers started as soon as 30 min after TPA stimulation. After 2 h, most of the cells had completely lost their stress fibers. As evident, actin was reorganized in ruffles, and reorganization was essentially completed after 2 h. It has to be noted that not all cells showed the same behavior. We could observe that after only 30 min of TPA stimulation some cells showed a complete loss of stress fibers, whereas a few cells (less than 5%) maintained some stress fibers even after 2 h of stimulation. Phorbolesters do not activate only PKC but also other signaling molecules like chimaerin (33Caloca M.J. Wang H. Delemos A. Wang S. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18303-18312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and Ras-guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein (34Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y. Stang S.L. Dunn R.J. Stone J.C. Science. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). In addition, these proteins have been implied in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Hence, it was essential to prove that the PKC kinase activity was in fact responsible for the observed effects on actin. To this end, we utilized the specific PKC inhibitor GF 109203X (35Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were preincubated with 2 μm GF109203X for 10 min before TPA stimulation. As evident from Fig. 1 B, no significant reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton could be induced by TPA stimulation in the presence of the PKC inhibitor. Therefore, the PKC kinase activity is responsible for the observed TPA effects. To further confirm our findings, we also utilized cells expressing EGFP-β-actin. As evident from Fig. 1 C, EGFP-actin revealed behavior identical to that of the endogenous protein: complete disintegration of the stress fibers and the appearance of ruffles within 2 h after TPA treatment. Again, the reorganization could be completely blocked by the use of GF109203X. The relatively long time required for the TPA-induced actin reorganization suggested that not only post-translational modifications but also de novo protein synthesis might be involved. To examine whether the TPA-induced actin reorganization does in fact require translation of new proteins, the cells were preincubated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide. This did not influence actin reorganization (not shown), and it is obvious that this process occurred independently of protein synthesis. This is in agreement with the observation of Imamura et al. (24Imamura H. Takaishi K. Nakano K. Kodama A. Oishi H. Shiozaki H. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2561-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), who also described a translationally independent TPA-mediated loss of actin stress fibers in MDCK cells. The dynamics of the cytoskeleton is regulated through the small G-proteins Rac, Rho, and Cdc42. To investigate the role of the small G-proteins in our experimental setting, we analyzed their activation state after TPA stimulation. The activity of these proteins was examined using activation state-specific binding proteins. Surprisingly, the activity of Rac1 and Cdc42 remained unchanged after TPA stimulation (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, the activity of RhoA showed a slight decrease after 30 min of TPA stimulation and a dramatic reduction after 60 min, indicating that the reduced RhoA activity might be the cause of the changes in the actin cytoskeleton. To prove that PKC kinase activity was responsible for the reduction of Rho activity, we preincubated the cells with GF109203X before TPA treatment. As expected from our previous data, the TPA-induced decrease in RhoA activity could be inhibited by GF109203X (Fig. 2 B). To investigate whether the down-regulation of RhoA activity was responsible for the observed actin rearrangements, we utilized an expression vector encoding RhoV14 fused to EGFP. Cells expressing this constitutively active variant of Rho (as indicated by the green fluorescence) displayed massive actin stress fibers even after 2 h of TPA treatment, whereas the surrounding cells had completely lost their stress fibers (Fig. 2 C). The down-regulation of RhoA activity resulted in reduced activity of the downstream kinase Rho-activated kinase, and hence inhibition of Rho-activated kinase activity was expected to result in a phenotype similar to that of the PKC activation. To test this hypothesis, Rho-activated kinase activity was inhibited utilizing the specific inhibitor Y27632. As has been described by several others (36Narumiya S. Ishizaki T. Uehata M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 325: 273-284Crossref Google Scholar, 37Sinnett-Smith J. Lunn J.A. Leopoldt D. Rozengurt E. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 266: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), treatment of the cells with 10 μm Y27632 for 1 h resulted in a similar phenotype with respect to actin organization as PKC activation: a complete loss of stress fibers (not shown). These data indicate that the down-regulation of Rho and hence the disturbance of the balance between small G-proteins on its own is sufficient to induce a Rac-like phenotype. Because inactivation of Rho, but not activation of Rac or Cdc42, contributes to the observed phenotype after PKC activation, we hypothesized that p190RhoGAP might be involved in this process. P190RhoGAP is a GTPase-activating protein with high specificity for Rho (38Ridley A.J. Self A.J. Kasmi F. Paterson H.F. Hall A. Marshall C.J. Ellis C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5151-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The activity of p190RhoGAP itself is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, and several studies have described Src as one of the kinases responsible for phosphorylation of this upstream regulator of GTPase signaling (39Brouns M.R. Matheson S.F. Settleman J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 40Ellis C. Moran M. McCormick F. Pawson T. Nature. 1990; 343: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 41Fincham V.J. Chudleigh A. Frame M.C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 947-956Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This led us to investigate the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in our system. As evident from Fig. 3 A, we were able to show that TPA stimulation led to an overall increase of tyrosine phosphorylation in whole cell lysates as detected by Western blot analysis. These data indicated that PKC could induce activation of a tyrosine kinase like Src. To test this, Src was immunoprecipitated from serum-starved A7r5 cells, and the kinase activity was examined before and after TPA stimulation using acid denatured enolase as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 3 B, Src activity is robustly induced upon TPA stimulation. To further test the hypothesis that Src activation was necessary for PKC-induced actin rearrangement, we utilized the inhibitor PP2, which is specific for the Src family kinases. A7r5 cells were preincubated with 50 μm PP2 for 10 min and subsequently stimulated with TPA. As a control, cells that had not been treated with PP2 were used. Although the disassembly of stress fibers and the appearance of ruffles were easily visible in the control cells, only a small effect of the PKC activation could be observed when Src activity was inhibited (Fig. 3 C). We also showed that PKC-mediated Rho inactivation could be inhibited with the Src-specific inhibitor. The cells were pretreated with 50 μm PP2 prior to TPA stimulation, and the Rho activity was determined. As shown in Fig. 3 D, the decrease in Rho activity observed in control cells after 1 h could be inhibited in cells that were pretreated with PP2. After 2 h, we could detect a moderate yet reproducible and significant decrease of Rho activity in cells prestimulated with PP2, which is in agreement with our morphological studies, where a small number of dorsal microruffles could be observed. Hence, PKC-induced Src activation is essential for the TPA-induced cytoskeletal changes. To confirm our results with the Src inhibitor PP2, we utilized an expression vector for kinase-inactive Src (Src K/M). Cells overexpressing Src K/M were visualized with the Src-specific antibody 2-17. Expression of Src K/M did not result in any significant differences in the actin cytoskeleton in the absence of TPA (data not shown). Upon stimulation with TPA for 2 h, the Src K/M-expressing cells retained thin stress fibers, whereas the surrounding untransfected cells had almost completely lost their actin stress fibers (Fig. 4). As is evident, the Src K/M-expressing cells reveal partial actin reorganization, most likely because of the activity of the endogenous c-Src. This further substantiated our hypothesis that the PKC-induced changes in actin cytoskeleton are dependent on Src activation. As controls, expression vectors encoding wild type or constitutively active Src were used. As expected, overexpression of c-Src was without effect with regard to PKC mediated actin reorganization. As has been described by several others (41Fincham V.J. Chudleigh A. Frame M.C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 947-956Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Beug H. Caviez M. Jokusch B. Graf T. Cell. 1978; 14: 834-856Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the expression of the constitutively active variant led to a complete loss of stress fibers without TPA stimulation (not shown). As noted above, the link between Src activity and Rho could be p190RhoGAP. To test our hypothesis, p190RhoGAP was immunoprecipitated from the cells before and after TPA stimulation, and the level of tyrosine phosphorylation was measured using the phosphotyrosine-specific antibody pTyr-100. As evident from Fig. 5 A, PKC activation resulted in an increase of tyrosine phosphorylation in p190RhoGAP, indicating activation of this protein in the A7r5 cells. Moreover, using specific inhibitors, we were able to show that the TPA-mediated increase in tyrosine phosphorylation depended on both PKC and Src kinase activity (Fig. 5 B). A schematic summary of our results is shown in Fig. 6. TPA treatment of A7r5 cells leads to a disassembly of actin stress fibers and a redistribution of actin in ruffles within 2 h. This process was dependent on the PKC-induced activation of Src, as shown by the use of the specific inhibitors for PKC (GF109203X) and Src (PP2) and with kinase-inactive Src. Activation of c-S"

Based upon clinical evidence that CADASIL arteriopathy results in degeneration and loss of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from the arterial wall, we postulated that Notch3 signaling is a critical determinant of VSMC survival. We initially established that both transient and constitutive Notch3 signaling promoted VSMC survival in response to the proapoptotic Fas ligand (FasL). Resistance to FasL-induced apoptosis was associated with the induction of c-FLIP, a primary inhibitor of the FasL signaling pathway. We determined that Notch3's regulation of c-FLIP was independent of the activity of the classical DNA-binding protein, RBP-Jk, but dependent upon cross-talk activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway. We extended our observations to the in vivocontext by determining a coordinate regulation of Notch3and c-FLIP within the arterial wall in response to injury. Furthermore, we defined that expression levels ofNotch3 and c-FLIP are coordinately up-regulated within the neointima of remodeled arteries. Taken together, these findings provide initial evidence that Notch3 signaling may be a critical determinant of VSMC survival and vascular structure by modulating the expression of downstream mediators of apoptosis via signaling cross-talk with the ERK/MAPK pathway.

However, the factors that regulate these programs within the vasculature remain poorly defined. Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephelopathy (CADASIL)1 is a heritable syndrome characterized by a predisposition to stroke due to an underlying arteriopathy. This diffuse arteriopathy is characterized by prominent degeneration and eventual loss of VSMC from the vessel wall (3Joutel A. Corpechot C. Ducros A. Vahedi K. Chabriat H. Mouton P. Alamowitch S.

These findings suggest that the Notch pathway may be an important determinant of VSMC fate and vascular structure in human health and disease. The Notch family of receptors has been characterized as critical determinants of cell fate in a variety of organisms. In mice, Notch1 and Notch2 gene deletions are characterized by perturbations in organogenesis that result in embryonic lethality (8Conlon R.A. Reaume A.G. Rossant J. Development. 1995; 121: 1533-1545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hamada Y. Kadokawa Y. Okabe M. Ikawa M. Coleman J.R. Tsujimoto Y. Development. 1999; 126: 3415-3424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mechanistic studies performed in cell culture models in other cell types indicate that the Notch pathway influences cell fate by regulating programs governing growth, apoptosis, and differentiation (10Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar, 11Lewis J. Semin. Cell Dev.

However, the functional role of the Notch signaling pathway in VSMC in vitro and in vivo remains to be defined. The Notch receptor family is activated via a proteolytic cleavage of the intracellular domain (IC) of Notch. In certain contexts, the Notch IC portion translocates to the nucleus together with Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H)) (mammalian orthologue, RBP-Jk/CBF-1). RBP-Jk provides DNA binding specificity through recognition of the consensus sequence, whereas Notch IC functions as an activation domain. In support of this notion, several studies have demonstrated the utility of overexpressing a dominant negative RBP-Jk (associates with Notch IC but lacks DNA binding) in the context of Notch IC expression to determine whether Notch-induced cellular events occur via an RBP-Jk-dependent or independent transcriptional pathway (15Nakagawa O. McFadden D.G. Nakagawa M. Yanagisawa H., Hu, T. Srivastava D. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13655-13660Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 16Beatus P. Lundkvist J.

In the classic model, in response to Notch signaling, RBP-Jk activates transcription of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors such as hairy-and-enhancer of split 1 (18Jarriault S., Le Bail O. Hirsinger E. Pourquie O. Logeat F. Strong C.F. Brou C. Seidah N.G. Israël A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7423-7431Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and the Hairy-related transcription factor (HRT) genes (19Iso T. Sartorelli V. Chung G. Shichinohe T. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6071-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Zebrafish embryos harboring a mutation in Gridlock, an orthologue of HRT2, show dramatic impairment of vascular formation (20Weinstein B.M. Stemple D.L. Driever W. Fishman M.C. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1143-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent evidence has established that Gridlock expression is a critical determinant of arterial versus venous cell fate within the developing vasculature (21Zhong T.P. Rosenberg M. Mohideen M.A. Weinstein B. Fishman M.C. Science. 2000; 287: 1820-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 22Zhong T.P. Childs S. Leu J.P. Fishman M.C. Nature. 2001; 414: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). In addition to the classical model of Notch signaling via RBP-Jk-dependent transcriptional events, Notch may engage other signaling cascades in a cross-talk fashion. Recent studies indicate that in certain contexts, the Notch signaling pathway may modulate Src and Ras signal transduction (23Berset T. Hoier E.F. Battu G. Canevascini S. Hajnal A. Science. 2001; 291: 1055-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 24Small D. Kovalenko D. Kacer D. Liaw L. Landriscina M., Di Serio C. Prudovsky I. Maciag T. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4191-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, the elucidation of Notch3 signaling via RBP-Jk-dependentversus signal transduction cross-talk and the activation of downstream target genes in adult VSMC remains to be defined. Studies from our laboratory and several other laboratories have suggested that apoptosis may play an essential role in atherogenesis and vascular remodeling (26Han D.K. Haudenschild C.C. Hong M.K. Tinkle B.T. Leon M.B. Liau G. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 267-277PubMed Google Scholar, 27Pollman M.J. Hall J.L. Mann M.J. Zhang L. Gibbons G.H. Nat.

VSMC apoptosis is a prominent feature of the response to injury and the consequent formation of the neointima. A growing body of evidence indicates that the selection and accumulation of intimal VSMC in a context involving a coordinate up-regulation of antiapoptotic genes and a down-regulation of proapoptotic mediators might be an essential survival mechanism for maintaining intimal lesion stability and progression over the long term course of vascular disease (29Gibbons G.H. Pollman M.J. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Fas is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues including the vessel wall (30Cai W. Devaux B. Schaper W. Schaper J. Atherosclerosis. 1997; 131: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Activation of Fas by its ligand (FasL) rapidly induces cell death through recruitment and activation of caspase-8 via the adapter protein Fas-associated death domain protein (31Kataoka T. Budd R.C. Holler N. Thome M. Martinon F. Irmler M. Burns K. Hahne M. Kennedy N. Kovacsovics M. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 640-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). c-FLIP competitively inhibits binding of caspase-8 to the Fas receptor complex, thus shuffling off the downstream Fas-signaling pathway. It is reported that c-FLIP is widely expressed in the normal vessel wall and may contribute to an apoptosis-resistant state of VSMC and that down-regulation of c-FLIP may render VSMC susceptible to apoptosis (32Imanishi T. Hano T. Nishio I. Liles W.C. Schwartz S.M. Han D.K. J. Vasc. Res. 2000; 37: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). c-FLIP is up-regulated in the intima and media after arterial injury and remodeling (33Imanishi T. McBride J., Ho, Q. O'Brien K.D. Schwartz S.M. Han D.K. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 125-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there are additional reports suggesting that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade functions as a survival pathway by regulating c-FLIP expression (34Aoudjit F. Vuori K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 633-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 35Holmstrom T.H. Schmitz I. Soderstrom T.S. Poukkula M. Johnson V.L. Chow S.C. Krammer P.H. Eriksson J.E.

The present study tested the hypothesis that Notch3 signaling is a critical determinant of VSMC survival. We employed both in vitro and in vivo model systems to investigate the relationship between the Notch3 signaling pathway and the inhibition of FasL-induced apoptosis in VSMC and define downstream mediators responsible for the survival-promoting function. In accord with this hypothesis, our findings indicate that Notch3 signaling inhibits FasL-induced cell death through the up-regulation of c-FLIP via an ERK/MAPK-dependent pathway, suggesting a mechanism through which Notch3 in a cross-talk fashion governs VSMC fate and ultimately vascular structure. Rat embryonic aorta A7r5 cells (ATCC, passages 3–20) and primary rat aortic smooth cells (passages 4–15) were used in our study. Stable cell lines overexpressing the Notch3 intracytoplasmic domain (N3IC; pCMX-PL2-N3IC; a kind gift from Dr. U. Lendahl, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden) and HRT1 (PIRES2-EGFP-HRT1; a kind gift from Dr. C. C. W. Hughes, University of California, Irvine, CA) were generated from A7r5 cells by transduction with a retroviral vector (pLNCX2; CLONTECH) and selection in the presence of geneticin (500 μg/ml; GLT). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (350–400 g) were balloon-injured using previously described methods (44Morishita R. Gibbons G.H. Ellison K.E. Nakajima M. Zhang L. Kaneda Y. Ogihara T. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8474-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) in accordance with a protocol approved by the Standing Committee on Animals, Morehouse School of Medicine. Rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of xylazine (5 mg/kg of body weight) and katamine hydrochloride (90 mg/kg of body weight). The left common carotid artery was injured with a 2-French Fogarty embolectomy balloon catheter, and vessels were harvested 14 (n = 5) and 28 days later for mRNA and/or protein analysis. Injured vessels were compared with their contralateral controls. Total RNA from cell pellets or pulverized arteries was extracted (Rneasy kit; Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA), and a reverse transcriptase reaction (Advantage RT for PCR kit; CLONTECH) was performed with 0.5–1 μg of DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX)-treated RNA. QRTPCR was carried out using the LightCycler thermocycler and the SYBR green I kit (Roche Diagnostics Corp.), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cycle numbers obtained at the log-linear phase of the reaction were plotted against a standard curve prepared with serially diluted control samples. Expression levels of target genes were normalized by GAPDH mRNA levels measured concurrently. Ten to 60 μg of protein/sample from cell cultures or rat carotid arteries were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Goat anti-rat Notch3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-FLIP (F9800; Sigma), and phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody (9101; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) as well as anti-pan-ERK (610123; BD Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA) were employed for the immunoblots. Membranes were developed through the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Ecl-Luminol kit; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein loading was systematically verified by Ponceau S staining and/or staining rat actin immunoblotting. Quantitative nuclear chromatin morphology was employed for the apoptosis counting. Cells to be analyzed for apoptosis by nuclear chromatin morphology were stained with Hoechst 33342 and assessed for the characteristic condensed, coalesced chromatin pattern of apoptotic cells as previously described by our laboratory (27Pollman M.J. Hall J.L. Mann M.J. Zhang L. Gibbons G.H. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 28Pollman M.J. Hall J.L. Gibbons G.H. Circ.

For Fas ligand-induced apoptosis, 70% confluent cells in 2% FBS were treated with 25 ng/ml Fas ligand (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) versusvehicle control for 24 h prior to harvest and determination of percentage of apoptotic nuclei as described above. N3IC and HRT1 were released from their expression vectors (pCMX-PL2-N3IC and PIRES2-EGFP-HRT1 were kind gifts from Dr. U. Lendahl and Dr. C. C. W. Hughes, respectively.) and subcloned to a retroviral vector, pLNCX2 (CLONTECH), and a mammalian expression vector, pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen). A dominant negative construct (R218H) for RBP-Jk was also employed in this study. It carries an arginine-to-histidine substitution at position 218, which is critical for the DNA binding activity of RBP-Jk. R218H in pCMX was a kind gift from Dr. Tasuku Honjo (Department of Medical Chemistry, Kyoto University). Native A7r5 cells were transfected with N3IC versus empty vector control (Effectene transfection reagent; Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions for 24 h prior to the apoptosis experiments. In a similar manner, A7r5 cells overexpressing N3IC versus empty cassette control were transfected with the dominant negative construct for RBP-Jk, R218H, or empty vector control 24 h prior to the determination of HRT1 and c-FLIP expression levels by QRTPCR. The mRNA expression levels of Notch3 as well as c-FLIP in rat carotid arteries were studied by QRTPCR at 5 and 28 days post-balloon injury. For determining the mediator role of the ERK/MAPK pathway, cells in serum-free medium for 6 h were exposed to U0126 (10 μmol/liter; Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA) versus vehicle control for an additional 1 h prior to harvest for c-FLIP mRNA and protein expression analysis. All experiments, including the immunoblots, were independently repeated at least three times. Comparisons between two groups were analyzed via a Student'st test, and values of p < 0.05 were considered to be significant. Results were presented as means ± S.E. At least three different samples were analyzed in each experimental group. To define the functional role of Notch3 signaling in VSMC, we initially established an in vitro model system. We generated a VSMC stable cell line expressing the constitutively active intracellular portion of Notch3 (N3IC) by retroviral transfection and marker selection. The selected cell line, N3ICSMC, exhibited a 35-fold up-regulation of Notch3 mRNA compared with its control cell line (Fig 1, left) and a correspondingly dramatic increase in Notch3 IC protein (Fig. 1, right). In addition, we confirmed that N3ICSMC exhibited significant tonic up-regulation of the HRT1 and -2 genes, previously described as downstream target genes of Notch signaling in other cell types (data not shown). To determine the functional role of Notch3 signaling on VSMC fate, we investigated the effect of Notch3 on promoting VSMC survival. We defined the antiapoptotic effect of Notch3 signaling in N3ICSMC by quantitative nuclear chromatin morphology analysis as previously described by our laboratory (27Pollman M.J. Hall J.L. Mann M.J. Zhang L. Gibbons G.H. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 28Pollman M.J. Hall J.L. Gibbons G.H. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 37Pollman M.J. Yamada T. Horiuchi M. Gibbons G.H. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 748-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Initially, we determined that constitutive Notch3 signaling in the N3ICSMC line promoted VSMC survival in response to serum deprivation (data not shown). To better define distinct apoptotic pathways that Notch3 signaling may modulate, we examined the effect of Notch3 signaling on mediating FasL-induced apoptosis. We demonstrated that constitutive Notch3 signaling in the N3ICSMC promoted a 2-fold increase in VSMC survival in response to FasL-induced apoptosis versus its control cell line (Fig. 2A). We confirmed these findings in native A7r5 by transient transfection of Notch3 IC. In accord with the data obtained in the stable N3ICSMC cell line, an approximate 2-fold survival increase in response to FasL was observed in VSMC transiently transfected with N3IC versusempty vector control (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2C depicts representative ultraviolet fluorescent photomicrographs of VSMC transfected with control (panels I and II) versus N3IC (panels IIIand IV) plasmid in 2% FBS in the absence (panels I and III) or presence of FasL (panels II and IV). Taken together, these data suggest that Notch3 signaling modulates VSMC response to the well defined Fas signaling pathway.FIG. 2Notch3 signaling promotes VSMC survival in response to FasL. A, constitutive Notch3 intracellular domain (N3IC) signaling in a retroviral stably transfected VSMC line (N3ICSMC) promotes survival in response to FasL-induced apoptosis compared with the empty vector control cell line, pLNCXSMC.

In the N3ICSMC cells, we examined the mRNA and protein expression levels of c-FLIP, IAP, and Bcl-2 compared with the control cell line. We established that resistance to FasL-induced apoptosis was associated with the induction of c-FLIP, a primary inhibitor of the Fas signaling pathway, as quantitated by real time RT-PCR and immunoblotting (Fig.3). As depicted in Fig. 3, steady state mRNA levels of c-FLIP were up-regulated about 2-fold in N3ICSMCversus the control cell line. Accordingly, the Notch3-induced up-regulation of c-FLIP was defined by a corresponding increase in protein expression confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 3, right panel). After establishing that Notch3 signaling induced c-FLIP expression in association with promoting VSMC survival, it remained to be determined whether c-FLIP was a direct downstream target gene of the classic Notch-RBP-Jk signaling in VSMC. To address this question, we performed transient overexpression experiments with a well described dominant negative inhibitor of RBP-Jk, R218H, and determined the effect of inhibiting the tonic Notch3—RBP-Jk signaling in the N3ICSMC stable cell line. The mRNA expression levels of c-FLIP and a previously established downstream target gene, HRT1, were determined by QRTPCR. As depicted in Fig.4, blockade of RBP-Jk activity with the dominant negative inhibitor R218H markedly attenuated both the basal mRNA expression levels of HRT1 in the control cell line and the induced HRT1 mRNA expression levels in the N3ICSMC cell line. In contrast, inhibition of Notch3—RBP-Jk activity had no effect on either the basal or the induced expression levels of c-FLIP. Therefore, these results suggest that Notch3 modulated c-FLIP expression through an RBP-Jk-independent pathway. After determining that Notch3 modulated c-FLIP through an apparent RBP-Jk-independent pathway, we investigated the potential role of other putative mediator pathways. Based upon previous reports in other cell types suggesting that the ERK/MAPK cascade may modulate c-FLIP expression (34Aoudjit F. Vuori K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 633-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 35Holmstrom T.H. Schmitz I. Soderstrom T.S. Poukkula M. Johnson V.L. Chow S.C. Krammer P.H. Eriksson J.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5418-5428Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), we postulated that Notch3 signaling activates the ERK/MAPK pathway in a cross-talk fashion. To test this postulate, we initially determined the steady state protein expression levels of both the total and active (phosphorylated) forms of p42/p44 ERK/MAPK in the N3ICSMC stable cell line via immunoblotting. As depicted in Fig. 5, without affecting the levels of total ERK/MAPK, constitutive Notch3 signaling promotes a marked increase in ERK/MAPK pathway activation in VSMC via an undefined cross-talk mechanism. To establish the mediator role of the Notch3-induced ERK/MAPK activation in regulating c-FLIP expression in VSMC, we examined the effect of inhibiting ERK/MAPK pathway activation on the Notch3-induced c-FLIP mRNA expression by QRTPCR analysis. As demonstrated in the histogram in Fig.6, steady state mRNA expression levels of c-FLIP in the control cell line are reduced in the absence of serum stimulation but are not further reduced after blockade of ERK/MAPK pathway activation via administration of U0126, a specific inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase. In contrast, while c-FLIPexpression levels were moderately reduced in the absence of serum stimulation, tonic Notch3 signaling in the N3ICSMC cells promoted the preservation of elevated c-FLIP expression levels compared with the control cells. However, the elevated c-FLIPexpression levels in the N3ICSMC cells were reduced to base-line control levels after blockade of the previously defined tonic ERK/MAPK pathway activation. Similar results were obtained in the setting of transient expression of Notch3 IC in VSMC (data not shown). Furthermore, we determined that inhibition of the ERK/MAPK pathway specifically attenuated c-FLIP expression, while levels of other antiapoptotic factors such as IAP, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL were unaffected (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that Notch3 mediates c-FLIP expression via cross-talk activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway in VSMC. After defining that Notch3 signaling promotes VSMC survival by inducing c-FLIP expression in vitro, we further postulated that the well described modulation of VSMC fate in vascular lesion formation involves a coordinate regulation of Notch3 and c-FLIP. To test this postulate, we examined the coordinate expression levels of Notch3 and c-FLIP in rat carotid arteries following standard balloon injury. As depicted in Fig.7A, as we have previously reported (38Wang W. Campos A.H. Gibbons G.H. Pollman M.J. Circulation. 2001; 104: II-89Google Scholar), Notch3 is acutely down-regulated within 1 week postinjury, exhibiting approximately a 6-fold change in mRNA expression levels at day 5. This down-regulation is seen at both the mRNA and protein level by QRTPCR and immunoblotting, respectively. When we examined the expression levels of c-FLIP at the same time point, we observed a similar, coordinate down-regulation of mRNA and protein by QRTPCR and immunoblotting, respectively (Fig.7B). Similar findings with Notch3 and c-FLIP were observed at day 3 postinjury. By day 7, the expression levels of both Notch3 and c-FLIP genes returned to preinjury levels (data not shown). We further postulated that an up-regulation of Notch3expression is a characteristic of the altered growth and apoptosis phenotype associated with neointimal cells. Previous reports indicate that c-FLIP expression is elevated within intimal cells of remodeled arteries (26Han D.K. Haudenschild C.C. Hong M.K. Tinkle B.T. Leon M.B. Liau G. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 267-277PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, as indicated in Fig.8A, c-FLIP mRNA and protein levels were increased within tissue selectively isolated from the intima of carotid arteries 4 weeks after carotid balloon injury compared with the paired contralateral uninjured vessel. When we examined Notch3 mRNA and protein levels within the same neointimal tissue, we observed significantly elevated expression levels coordinate with increased c-FLIP expression (Fig.8B). Taken together, these findings establish a coordinate pattern of Notch3 and c-FLIP expression in response to arterial injury and within intimal cells of remodeled arteries. Although it is well documented that the Notch pathway is a potent modulator of cell function and fate during organogenesis and vascular ontogeny, the role of this signaling pathway within the adult vasculature remains to be elucidated. Intriguingly, the human CADASIL syndrome, caused by mutations in the Notch3 receptor, is characterized by a systemic arteriopathy featuring degeneration and eventual loss of VSMC. Based upon these distinguishing clinicopathological features, we postulated that Notch3 signaling may be a critical determinant of VSMC survival. This present study provides initial insight into Notch3 signaling and function as a determinant of VSMC fate through the modulation of critical molecular mediators of VSMC apoptosis. In addition, the study provides an initial description of elevatedNotch3 expression as a characteristic feature of neointimal cells. We have previously shown that neointimal cells are relatively resistant to the induction of apoptosis in association with the up-regulation of antiapoptotic mediators (27Pollman M.J. Hall J.L. Mann M.J. Zhang L. Gibbons G.H. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 28Pollman M.J. Hall J.L. Gibbons G.H. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 29Gibbons G.H. Pollman M.J. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Utilizing models of transient and stable transgene expression, we demonstrated that constitutive Notch3 receptor activation induced an antiapoptotic phenotype in VSMC. It is recognized that the regulation of apoptosis is a complex process potentially involving a number of different cellular mediator pathways. It is conceivable that Notch3 may inhibit VSMC apoptosis by pathways independent of c-FLIP. In support of this notion, our study suggests that Notch3 signaling promotes survival in response to serum deprivation in addition to the administration of FasL. However, the mechanisms of serum deprivation-induced apoptosis are complex and poorly defined. Numerous, plausible antiapoptotic mechanisms can be hypothesized: interaction with nuclear receptors of the steroid/thyroid/retinoid/orphan superfamily; regulation of the expression of antiapoptotic members of the Bcl family; regulation of NF-κB family members' expression or function; and regulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity. It is entirely possible that several or all of these mechanisms may be used by a Notch receptor, simultaneously or alternatively, depending on the cellular context (39Miele L. Osborne B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 393-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, our studies establish that Notch3 signaling promotes resistance to FasL-induced apoptosis. Increasing evidence suggests that Fas-mediated death plays a critical role in VSMC biology and pathobiology in vitro and in vivo (40Chan S.W. Hegyi L. Scott S. Cary N.R. Weissberg P.L. Bennett M.R. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1038-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 41Boyle J.J. Bowyer D.E. Weissberg P.L. Bennett M.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Med. 2000; 6: 790-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Based upon this finding, we postulated that Notch3 signaling in VSMC regulates the expression of antiapoptotic genes known to modulate the Fas signaling pathway. The phenotype of Fas resistance in VSMC may result from reduced expression of proapoptotic proteins involved in Fas signaling, including FasL, Fas-associated death domain protein, and caspase-3, -7, and -8, and increased expression of antiapoptotic proteins such as c-FLIP, Bcl-2, and c-IAP-1 (28Pollman M.J. Hall J.L. Gibbons G.H. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 29Gibbons G.H. Pollman M.J. Circ.

We investigated the expression levels of the above antiapoptotic proteins as well as the Fas receptor. Our findings further establish that Notch3 signaling promotes the expression of the antiapoptotic mediator, c-FLIP, a direct inhibitor of the Fas signal transduction pathway. Intriguingly, it is reported that c-FLIP is expressed in the neointima in animal models and in human atherosclerosis (32Imanishi T. Hano T. Nishio I. Liles W.C. Schwartz S.M. Han D.K. J. Vasc. Res. 2000; 37: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 33Imanishi T. McBride J., Ho, Q. O'Brien K.D. Schwartz S.M. Han D.K. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 125-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In accord with these previous descriptions, the present study demonstrates that c-FLIP is coordinately up-regulated with Notch3 within the neointima. Whereas this observation suggests a possible mechanistic link between Notch3 signaling and c-FLIP expression in vivo, further in vivo studies are necessary to define this relationship. Taken together, these studies are the first to establish the essential survival-promoting role of Notch3 and its modulation of c-FLIP as a putative downstream effector of this function in VSMC. The present study investigated potential mechanisms by which Notch3 signaling modulates c-FLIP expression in VSMC. In addition to the classical model of Notch signaling via RBP-Jk-dependent transcriptional events, Notch may engage other signaling cascades in a cross-talk fashion (23Berset T. Hoier E.F. Battu G. Canevascini S. Hajnal A. Science. 2001; 291: 1055-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 24Small D. Kovalenko D. Kacer D. Liaw L. Landriscina M., Di Serio C. Prudovsky I. Maciag T. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4191-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, the elucidation of Notch3 signaling via RBP-Jk-dependent versus signal transduction cross-talk and the activation of downstream target genes in adult VSMC is poorly defined. Our findings suggest that Notch3 modulates c-FLIP expression in a manner largely independent of RBP-Jk activity. The well described dominant negative mutant of RBP-Jk, R218H, inhibited VSMC expression of an established downstream Notch-RBP-Jk target gene, HRT1, but failed to inhibit the expression of c-FLIP. Furthermore, preliminary studies in our laboratory indicate that VSMC expression of HRT1 does not promote the induction of c-FLIP. Taken together, these studies provide supportive evidence that suggests Notch3 modulates c-FLIP through a mechanism largely independent of the RBP-Jk—HRT pathway. Our findings indicate that Notch3 signaling modulates c-FLIPexpression through activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway in a yet undefined cross-talk fashion. In support of this notion, recent studies in other cell types indicate that in certain contexts, the Notch signaling pathway may modulate Src and Ras signal transduction by as yet undefined mechanisms (23Berset T. Hoier E.F. Battu G. Canevascini S. Hajnal A. Science. 2001; 291: 1055-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 24Small D. Kovalenko D. Kacer D. Liaw L. Landriscina M., Di Serio C.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4191-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Future studies are needed to define the means by which Notch3 signaling cross-talks with the ERK/MAPK signal transduction cascade. Possible mechanisms include a direct interaction of the Notch3 receptor with upstream elements of the ERK cascade or an indirect autocrine/paracrine induction of ERK-activating growth factors. We speculate that cross-talk activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway may represent an additional novel mechanism through which Notch3 signaling determines VSMC fate. In summary, these studies are the first to establish the essential survival-promoting role of Notch3 signaling in VSMC. The working model defined by our data suggests that as part of a survival-promoting phenotype in response to Fas activation, Notch3 induces c-FLIP expression through an ERK/MAPK-dependent mechanism. It is intriguing that mutations of the Notch3 receptor are postulated to result in a loss of Notch3 function primarily affecting the fate of VSMC in the CADASIL syndrome (3Joutel A. Corpechot C.

Sci. 1997; 826: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We speculate that a loss of the survival-promoting influence of Notch3 may render VSMC more susceptible to signals from Fas and other related proapoptotic signaling pathways. Conversely, increased Notch3 signaling may induce resistance to proapoptotic signals and contribute to the abnormal accumulation of VSMC seen within the intima. It is anticipated that further elucidation of Notch3 signaling, target gene induction, and function in VSMC will provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of vascular disease and complications."

Mutation of conserved amino acids in the linker at Ser261 and Leu264, which bridges the S9–S10 β-sheets, stimulated p53 activity from reporter templates and increased MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of p53.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36031-36034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The biochemical activity of p53 linked with tumor suppression is its function as a sequence-specific DNA binding protein and transcription factor that controls the expression of a large panel of gene products implicated in normal growth control, DNA repair, cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and angiogenesis (2Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5850) Google Scholar). The stress-regulated transactivation function of p53 is driven by its sequence-specific DNA binding domain and is coordinated by specific protein·protein interactions that can in turn be modulated by covalent and non-covalent modifications. The central core domain of p53 from amino acids 90–295 contains the sequence-specific DNA binding domain (3Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar). Inactivating mutations in p53 at over 200 different amino acid positions within this core DNA binding domain have been detected in human cancers (4Hollstein M. Hergenhahn M. Yang Q. Bartsch H. Wang Z.Q. Hainaut P. Mutat. Res. 1999; 431: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and the mutation often results in the unfolding and accumulation of p53 protein in the nucleus of the cancer cell (5Gannon J.V. Greaves R. Iggo R. Lane D.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1595-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). An oligomerization domain from amino acids 320–356 flanks the conserved core sequence-specific DNA binding domain and is required to assemble p53 into its tetrameric structure (6Mateu M.G. Fersht A.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2748-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,7Mateu M.G. Sanche Zdel Pino M.M. Fersht A.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Regulatory domains at the N and C termini of p53 modulate protein·protein interactions and DNA·protein interactions that affect the rate of p53-dependent transcription (8Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Ball K.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The C terminus of p53 contains a negative regulatory domain whose phosphorylation at Ser315 by cyclin-dependent kinases (9Blaydes J.P. Luciani M.G. Pospisilova S. Ball H.M. Vojtesek B. Hupp T.R. J.

The N-terminal regulatory domain of p53 contains the highly conservedBOX-I domain that directs the binding of p53 to proteins, including the positive effector p300 and the inhibitor MDM2, the balance of which regulates the tumor suppressor activity of p53. Phosphorylation at Ser15, Thr18, and Ser20 can either reduce MDM2 binding (11Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sakaguchi K.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), resulting in a net activation of p53 function. Thus, the concerted activation of the sequence-specific DNA binding function of p53 by post-translational modification of its C-terminal domain and the kinase-dependent stabilization of the p53·p300 complex provide a working model to explain the basic mechanism of how p53-dependent gene expression can be activated. By contrast to p53 activation reactions, inhibition of p53 activity is less understood but involves an MDM2-dependent pathway that functions in cycling cells to degrade p53 and keep its transcriptional activity relatively low. MDM2 protein contains at least four independent functional domains, including: 1) an N-terminal domain that recognizes the BOX-I domain of p53 (14Lin J. Chen J. Elenbaas B. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar); 2) a central domain that binds to the tumor suppressor protein p14ARF; 3) a putative zinc binding domain (15Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Taneyhill L. Piette J. Mechali M. Nicolas J.C. Levine A.J. Moreau J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1427-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); and 4) a RING-finger RNA binding domain (16Elenbaas B. Dobbelstein M. Roth J. Shenk T. Levine A.J. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 439-451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The original localization of the primary MDM2 docking site on p53 protein in the N-terminal BOX-I domain was defined using small peptide-mimetics (17Picksley S.M. Vojtesek B. Sparks A. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2523-2529PubMed Google Scholar), crystallographic analysis (18Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1812) Google Scholar), and mutational studies (15Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Taneyhill L. Piette J. Mechali M. Nicolas J.C. Levine A.J. Moreau J.

Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). These studies revealed that a highly conserved hydrophobic series of amino acids within the N-terminal region of p53 from amino acids 14–27 interact with a hydrophobic binding pocket in the N-terminal domain of MDM2 protein. The microinjection of monoclonal antibodies to the p53 binding interface of MDM2 protein can activate p53-dependent expression providing direct evidence that MDM2 is normally a negative regulator of p53 function in vivo (20Blaydes J.P. Gire V. Rowson J.M. Wynford-Thomas D. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1859-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 21Blaydes J.P. Wynford-Thomas D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3317-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Scaffold proteins fused to the BOX-I domain of p53 can activate p53 function by virtue of binding to MDM2 protein (13Dornan D. Hupp T.R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 22Bottger A. Bottger V. Sparks A. Liu W.L. Howard S.F. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 860-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), providing additional evidence for the importance of this small BOX-I domain as an independent binding motif that is recognized by MDM2 protein in vivo. Although MDM2 binding to the p53 tetramer results in polyubiquitination of the C-terminal domain of p53 and subsequent degradation, theBOX-I motif is itself sufficient for targeting a heterologous fusion protein for degradation by MDM2 protein (23Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar). These latter data identify the minimal polypeptide fragment that can be modified by MDM2-dependent degradation machinery in vivo, but how MDM2 protein interacts with the native p53 tetramer is undefined. For example, although the BOX-I motif can promote degradation of a heterologous fusion protein in cells (13Dornan D. Hupp T.R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar), monomeric p53 protein, paradoxically, is not degraded by MDM2 (59Marston N.J. Jenkins J.R. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1709-1715PubMed Google Scholar) indicating that other determinants in the p53 tetramer regulate MDM2 binding in cells. A more recent study has shown that MDM2 protein, when complexed to RNA in vitro, can bind to p53 lacking theBOX-I domain, suggesting that RNA can induce a conformational change in MDM2 that directs its binding to a novel site in p53 (25Burch L.R. Midgley C.A. Currie R.A. Lane D.P. Hupp T.R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to use a biochemical approach to begin to reconstitute the MDM2·p53 tetramer complexin vitro and determine whether co-factors can modulate thein vitro stability of the MDM2·p53 complex. We provide direct evidence for a secondary docking site for MDM2 within the core domain of p53 that resides within a conformationally flexible S9–S10 β-sheet region flanked by conserved domains BOX-IV andBOX-V. Mutant forms of p53 that contain single point mutations at conserved amino acids within this S9–S10 β-sheet region have increased levels of MDM2-dependent ubiquitination in cells. This conformationally flexible motif is interestingly constrained in the wild-type p53 protein·DNA complex (3Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar), but the S9–S10 β-sheet region is unfolded or denatured in mutant p53 protein within human cancers (5Gannon J.V. Greaves R. Iggo R. Lane D.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1595-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 35Vojtesek B. Dolezalova H. Lauerova L. Svitakova M. Havlis P. Kovarik J. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 389-393PubMed Google Scholar). The denaturation or unfolding of p53 protein defined the first molecular defect of the p53 pathway in human cancer cells, and the refolding of p53 protein by small molecules has been the subject of recent screening programs aimed at reactivating mutant p53 protein function (60Xirodimas D.P. Lane D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28042-28049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 61Nikolova P.V. Henckel J. Lane D.P. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Together, these data, identifying the conformationally flexible linker within the S9–S10 β-sheet region of p53 protein as a novel MDM2 binding interface, suggest an interplay may exist between p53 protein unfolding and factors that modulate the rate of MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of p53in vivo. All reagents were from Sigma Chemical Co. unless indicated otherwise. Bacterially expressed p53 was purified as described previously (24Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Full-length human MDM2 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells (25Burch L.R. Midgley C.A. Currie R.A.

Harvested cells were washed with ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and the final pellet was resuspended at 0.66 g/ml in 10% sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), followed by the addition of lysozyme (150 μg/ml final concentration) and NaCl (0.15m final concentration). The cell suspension was incubated in an ice bath for 45 min, then warmed to 37 °C for 1 min and returned to 0 °C. The cells were lysed on ice by sonication, after the addition of Pefabloc (2 mm, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), DTT1 (5 mm, BDH Laboratory Supplies), and benzamidine (1 mm). The lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was fractionated on a 5-ml HiTrap-SP column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with buffer A (15% glycerol, 25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.02% Triton X-100, 5 mm DTT, and 1 mmbenzamidine). The supernatant was diluted with buffer A prior to application onto the column, and bound protein was eluted in a linear gradient in buffer A from 0.05 to 1.0 m KCl. Aliquots (1 μl) of the fractions from the column were assayed for the purity of MDM2 by SDS gel and presence of MDM2 by Western blotting. To determine the oligomerization state of p53, purified MDM2 protein was applied onto size-exclusion chromatography (Superose 12 HR 10/30, AmershamBiosciences, Inc.) with buffer B (10 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to create p53 mutants, with primers designed to change Phe19, Ser261, Leu264, and Phe270 into alanine. The peptide or p53 tetramer binding activity of MDM2 was examined by ELISA, as described previously (25Burch L.R. Midgley C.A. Currie R.A. Lane D.P. Hupp T.R.

Essentially, 96-well plates (Dynex Microlite 2) were first coated with p53, MDM2, or streptavidin and the indicated biotinylated peptide for 16 h, as described previously (13Dornan D. Hupp T.R.

This was followed by titrating increasing amounts of p53, MDM2, peptides, or RNA (polyG) in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS-Tween 20 (0.02% v/v) for 1 h, followed by an extensive wash, and incubation with the indicated IgG. All reactions were carried out at 4 °C and detected by the appropriate secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase from DAKO. The signal detection by enhanced chemiluminescence was developed using Fluoroscan Ascent FL. The human p14ARF domain peptide contained the sequence MVRRFLVTLRIRRACGPPRV (27Midgley C.A. Desterro J.M.

The DO-12 epitope peptide used contained the sequence SGNLLGRNSFEVRVCACPGRDR. Phage-peptide display, on antibody-captured bacterially expressed MDM2 protein or bacterially expressed MDM2 protein reconstituted with RNA (polyrG), was carried out using three rounds of phage-peptide selection as described previously for purified phospho-specific monoclonal antibodies toward phospho-epitopes of p53 (9Blaydes J.P.

Immunoprecipitation was performed using 5 μl of wild-type or mutant p53 proteins translated in TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation systems (Promega) with 10 μl of MDM2, which was purified by the method indicated above (SP-fraction). Rabbit reticulocyte lysates containing translated p53 protein were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 500 μl of Immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors) with Protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), the p53 monoclonal antibody PAb421, in the absence or presence of MDM2 protein (SP-fraction) and in the absence or presence of 1 μg of RNase (Sigma). The Protein G was washed four times with immunoprecipitation buffer, and bound proteins were eluted in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer. The eluted samples (10 μl) were loaded onto SDS-acrylamide gel and blotted for MDM2 using the monoclonal antibody 2A10. H1299 p53−/− cells and SAOS-2 p53−/− cells were incubated in RPMI 1640, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. 1 × 106 of H1299 cells, A375 cells, or 4.5 × 106 of SAOS-2 cells were seeded on 6-cm tissue culture plates and transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacture's protocol, and p53-dependent transcription was carried out as described previously (13Dornan D. Hupp T.R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, SAOS-2, H1299, or A375 cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection and lysed in reporter lysis buffer. The corresponding luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). The exact quantity of DNA transfected is indicated in each experiment, and, where necessary, carrier DNA was transfected to keep the same amount of DNA consistent in each transfection. For detection of protein by Western blot analysis, 24 h post transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) containing a protease inhibitor mixture). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay, and an equal amount of total protein was loaded onto the SDS gels. p53-ubiquitination assays using p53 transfected into H1299 cells were carried out as described previously (29Berger M. Vogt Sionov R. Levine A.J. Haupt Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3785-3790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For detection of ubiquitinated p53, 24 h-post transfection, H1299 cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal at a final concentration of 50 μm for 4 h prior to lysis using lysis buffer HS (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 100 mm DTT, containing a protease inhibitor mixture). When the half-life of p53 protein (and indicated mutants) was examined, H1299 cells were transfected with 1 μg of p53 DNA (wild-type or mutant p53) in the absence or presence of 1 or 3 μg of MDM2 expression DNA. Cells were treated with 1.33 mm of the protein-synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (SPELCO) 24 h post-transfection and harvested at the indicated time points. Human MDM2 protein contains an N-terminal domain that binds to the N-terminalBOX-I domain of p53 and C-terminal sub-domains that interact with zinc, RNA, and the tumor suppressor protein p14ARF(30Woods D.B. Vousden K.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Although MDM2 protein is known to bind to the N-terminalBOX-I domain of p53, a recent study has shown that RNA binding by MDM2 can promote MDM2 protein interaction with aBOX-I deletion mutant of p53 protein using surface plasmon resonance (25Burch L.R. Midgley C.A. Currie R.A. Lane D.P. Hupp T.R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These latter data suggest that RNA induces a conformational change in MDM2 protein via the RING finger domain and that this promotes an interaction with p53 outside the canonicalBOX-I motif. This current study was set up initially to determine in fact whether ligand binding to the C-terminal domain of MDM2 could change its conformation and whether this change directs MDM2 to interact with a previously unidentified motif within the core domain of p53. To begin to address this possibility, full-length human MDM2 protein was first purified in a native state from bacterial expression systems. Following lysis using gentle perturbations that can maintain recombinant protein conformational integrity, a purification of MDM2 protein was developed using standard chromatographic methods. The best purification was obtained using cation exchange chromatography, where MDM2 protein eluted as a triplet of three protein bands at a conductivity equivalent to 0.4–0.5 m KCl (Fig.1 A, lanes 1–4). Immunoblotting of the peak fractions using distinct monoclonal antibodies confirms that the triplet protein bands of interest are MDM2 protein (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–4). It is not known whether the three protein bands stem from alternative translational reading and termination of the mdm2 transcript in E. coli or from proteolysis of MDM2 protein. In addition, because MDM2 protein has a predicted molecular mass of ∼55 kDa yet migrates in a denaturing gel at a molecular mass of greater than 90 kDa, altered protein-folding pathways utilized during its translation may produce isoforms that migrate anomalously in a denaturing SDS-gel. The MDM2 protein eluted as a monomer on gel filtration (data not shown) indicating that native MDM2 protein purified from bacteria is not a large oligomeric inclusion body intermediate. The specific activity of the native fraction of full-length MDM2 protein was tested in aBOX-I peptide binding assay and in a p53-tetrameric binding assay to determine whether MDM2 was active when purified under these conditions. When MDM2 was titrated into streptavidin-ELISA wells pre-coated with a biotinylated BOX-I domain peptide, a dose-dependent increase in MDM2 binding can be observed using two different monoclonal antibodies as a detection system (Fig.1 C). MDM2 protein was also active in binding to native p53 tetramers (Fig. 1 D), indicating that this fraction of monomeric MDM2 is fully competent in peptide or protein binding assays. However, differences in the specific activity of MDM2 protein toward p53 tetramers, but not the BOX-I peptide, depend on the monoclonal antibody used as the detection system (Fig. 1, D versus C). These latter data suggest that either mAb 4B2 de-stabilizes the p53 tetramer·MDM2 protein complex or that mAb 2A10 stabilizes the p53 tetramer·MDM2 protein complex. The functional domains of MDM2 protein include: (i) the N-terminal p53 binding site (amino acids 19–102); (ii) the N-terminal p14ARF binding site (amino acids 212–244); (iii) the nuclear localization signal (amino acids 181–185); (iv) the nuclear export sequence (amino acids 197–205); (v) a C-terminal zinc finger; (vi) a C-terminal RING finger domain; and (vii) a nucleolar localization signal sequence (amino acids 466–473). A quantitative ELISA was used to determine whether ligands that bind to the C-terminal domain of MDM2 change the stability of the tetrameric p53·MDM2 protein complex. Ligands included RNA (polyrG) that binds to the extreme C-terminal RING finger domain, zinc that binds to the more N-terminal zinc binding site, and p14ARF, which binds to the central domain of MDM2. The first sequence of events involved analyzing the affects of RNA on the specific activity of MDM2 protein, which included adsorption of MDM2 protein onto the solid phase, followed by the incubation of MDM2 protein with RNA, and ending with the incubation of the ligand-free form of MDM2 or the MDM2·RNA complex with native p53. The RNA used was the homopolyribonucleotide polyrG, which binds with a high affinity to MDM2 protein (16Elenbaas B. Dobbelstein M. Roth J. Shenk T. Levine A.J. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 439-451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, a dose-dependent increase in the amount of p53 bound to MDM2 occurs after the addition of 100 pg to 100 ng of RNA (Fig.2 A). When the sequence of events was changed by first capturing MDM2 protein with the 4B2 monoclonal antibody, a similar trend was observed in that the addition of RNA to MDM2 enhanced the stability of the p53·MDM2 protein complex (Fig. 2 B). However, an increase in the amount of p53 bound to MDM2 increases after the addition of 100 ng to 10 μg of RNA, resulting in a 1000-fold reduction in the sensitivity of MDM2 to RNA. Because the mAb 4B2 was also less intrinsically efficient in capturing the p53·MDM2 protein complex than mAb 2A10 (Fig. 1), the 4B2 capture method of quantitating the MDM2·p53 complex was not used further. Because the conformation of p53 is known to change upon binding to nucleic acid (31Halazonetis T.D. Davis L.J. Kandil A.N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 32Hansen S. Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3917-3924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), a control was performed to determine whether the effects of RNA were due to changes in MDM2 conformation rather than that of p53. The sequence of events included adsorption of p53 tetramers onto the solid phase, followed by the incubation of p53 protein with RNA, and ending with the incubation of the p53·RNA complex with native MDM2 protein. Under these conditions, a decrease in the amount of MDM2 bound to p53 occurs after the addition of 100 pg to 10 ng of RNA (Fig. 2 C). These data contrast with the affects of RNA on stabilizing the MDM2·p53 complex (Fig. 2, A andB) and are consistent with the observation that p53·DNA complexes exhibit reduced binding to MDM2 (25Burch L.R. Midgley C.A. Currie R.A. Lane D.P. Hupp T.R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Experiments were next carried out to determine whether stabilization of the MDM2·p53 complex by RNA involves changes in the interaction of MDM2 protein with the BOX-I domain of p53 and/or an interaction of MDM2 with a novel site in the core domain of p53. For example, RNA may stabilize the MDM2·p53 complex by increasing the affinity of MDM2 protein for the N-terminalBOX-I domain of p53. The specific activity of MDM2 protein was thus subsequently tested in a BOX-I peptide binding assay, because the use of a small p53-derived peptide also minimizes the affects other regions of p53 that bind either RNA, zinc, or p14ARF. Strikingly, a preincubation of MDM2 protein with RNA reduced substantially the formation of the MD"

LIM motif-containing protein kinase 1 (LIMK1) regulates actin reorganization by phosphorylating and inactivating cofilin, an actin-depolymerizing and -severing protein. To examine the role of LIMK1 and cofilin during the cell cycle, we measured cell cycle-associated changes in the kinase activity of LIMK1 and in the level of cofilin phosphorylation. Using synchronized HeLa cells, we found that LIMK1 became hyperphosphorylated and activated in prometaphase and metaphase, then gradually returned to the basal level as cells entered into telophase and cytokinesis. Although Rho-associated kinase and p21-activated protein kinase phosphorylate and activate LIMK1, they are not likely to be involved in mitosis-specific activation and phosphorylation of LIMK1. Immunoblot and immunofluorescence analyses using an anti-phosphocofilin-specific antibody revealed that the level of cofilin phosphorylation, similar to levels of LIMK1 activity, increased during prometaphase and metaphase then gradually declined in telophase and cytokinesis. Ectopic expression of LIMK1 increased the level of cofilin phosphorylation throughout the cell cycle and induced the formation of multinucleate cells. These results suggest that LIMK1 is involved principally in control of mitosis-specific cofilin phosphorylation and that dephosphorylation and reactivation of cofilin at later stages of mitosis play a critical role in cytokinesis of mammalian cells.

In animal cells in culture, flat and adherent cells in interphase become spherical and weakly adherent in mitosis. At later stages of mitosis, cortical actin filaments are reorganized and recruited to the cleavage furrow, and an actomyosin-based contractile ring is formed around the equator of dividing cells, constricted to lead to cell cleavage, and disappears at the end of cytokinesis. Actin filament dynamics, reorganization, and redistribution play a principal role in these processes (1Fishkind D.J. Wang Y.L. Curr. Opin.

Cofilin and its close relative, actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF),1 bind to actin monomers and filaments and play a critical role in regulating actin filament dynamics and reorganization by stimulating depolymerization and severance of actin filaments (4Moon A.

In addition to functions in actin cytoskeletal remodeling in interphase cells, cofilin/ADF seems to be involved in processes related to mitosis and cytokinesis. Cofilin/ADF is concentrated at the cleavage furrow and the midbody during cytokinesis of cultured mammalian cells (23Nagaoka R. Abe H. Kusano K. Obinata T. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 30: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and cleavage of Xenopus fertilized eggs (24Abe H. Obinata T. Minamide L.S. Bamburg J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 871-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Injection of the antibody that inhibits the activity of cofilin/ADF intoXenopus blastomeres blocks the cleavage of the blastomeres (24Abe H. Obinata T. Minamide L.S. Bamburg J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 871-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In addition, Drosophila twinstar mutants, in which expression of the twinstar gene encoding aDrosophila cofilin/ADF ortholog is repressed, exhibit frequent failures in cytokinesis in larval neuroblasts and in testicular meiotic cells (25Gunsalus K.C. Bonaccorsi S. Williams E. Verni F. Gatti M. Goldberg M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1243-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that cofilin/ADF plays a critical role in cytokinesis. Furthermore, injection into Xenopus blastomeres of a nonphosphorylatable (constitutively active) form of cofilin/ADF blocks cytokinesis, but injection of wild-type cofilin/ADF that can be phosphorylated has no apparent effect (24Abe H. Obinata T. Minamide L.S. Bamburg J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 871-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), thus indicating that excess activity of cofilin/ADF also prevents cytokinesis, and the proper control of cofilin/ADF activity by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is important for progression of mitosis. We thus assumed that LIM kinases play a role in mitosis and cytokinesis by phosphorylating and regulating the activity of cofilin/ADF. We have now examined changes in the kinase activity of LIMK1 and the level of cofilin phosphorylation during the cell cycle, and we found that LIMK1 becomes activated and hyperphosphorylated in the early stages of mitosis and then gradually reverts to basal levels in late stages. Mitotic activation of LIMK1 is induced by a mechanism distinct from that of Thr-508 phosphorylation by ROCK or PAK. We also noted cell cycle-associated changes in the level of cofilin phosphorylation which are similar to those seen with LIMK1 activity. Ectopic expression of LIMK1 induces increases in the level of cofilin phosphorylation throughout the cell cycle and leads to the formation of multinucleate cells. We propose that LIMK1 plays an important role in regulating cofilin/ADF activity during mitosis and that cofilin dephosphorylation in the late stages of mitosis is critical for cytokinesis. To generate a pMYC-C1 vector containing the Myc epitope sequence (EQKLISEEDL), a pEYFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was digested withNheI and BglII, and the oligonucleotides coding for Myc epitope peptide were inserted in place of the cDNA for yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). Expression plasmids coding for N-terminally Myc-tagged LIMK1 and LIMK2 were constructed by inserting full-length human LIMK1 and LIMK2 cDNAs (9Mizuno K. Okano I. Ohashi K. Nunoue K. Kuma K. Miyata T.

Plasmids coding for Myc-LIMK1(D460A) and Myc-LIMK1(T508V), in which Asp-460 and The-508 in Myc-LIMK1 were replaced by Ala and Val, respectively, were constructed, using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH). To construct the plasmid coding for Myc-LIMK1(PK) containing amino acid residues 267–647, the cDNA fragment was amplified by PCR, using primers 5′-CTAGCTCGCCACCATGGGATACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCTGGATCCAGATCTGGGCCTGAGACCAGCCCC-3′ and 5′-TCCCGCGGAGGAATCTGG-3′.

Chem. 2000; 275: 3577-3582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The authenticity of plasmids was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Cells were synchronized at beginning of the S phase using the double thymidine block method (26Hirota T. Morisaki T. Nishiyama Y. Marumoto T. Tada K. Hara T. Masuko N. Inagaki M. Hatakeyama K.

In brief, cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS and 1 mm thymidine for 24 h, incubated in fresh DMEM containing 10% FCS for 8 h, and again cultured in thymidine-containing medium for 16 h. For cell cycle progression, cells synchronized at the beginning of S phase were then released for 6–12 h in fresh DMEM containing 10% FCS. To synchronize cells at mitosis, cells were synchronized at the beginning of S phase by a single thymidine block and cultured in fresh DMEM containing 10% FCS for 6 h and then cultured for 6 h in the presence of 100 ng/ml nocodazole. For transient transfection experiments, HeLa cells were transfected using the LipofectAMINE method (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's protocol, cultured in the thymidine-containing medium for 24 h, and released for 6 h in fresh DMEM containing 10% FCS. Nocodazole, a microtubule-depolymerizing agent, was added to the medium, and the culture was continued for another 6 h. Mitotic cells that rounded up and adhered weakly on the culture dish were collected selectively by the mechanical shake-off procedure, whereas the attached interphase cells were harvested by scraping them off. To prepare cells synchronized at later stages of mitosis, mitotic cells collected by nocodazole arrest were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove nocodazole, suspended in DMEM containing 10% FCS, plated into poly-l-lysine-coated culture dishes or coverslips then incubated at 37 °C to allow for cell cycle progression. At 0, 45, 90, 180 min after release from nocodazole arrest, the cells were harvested and subjected to analyses. For flow cytometry, cells were trypsinized, fixed with 70% methanol, stained with propidium iodide, and analyzed by a flow cytometer EPICS XL-MCL (Beckman Coulter). COS-7 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE. Three h after transfection, the medium was changed to normal cultivation medium. After an additional 36 h culture, cells were harvested and subjected to analyses. Rabbit anti-LIMK1 antibody (C-10) was raised against the C-terminal peptide of LIMK1, as described (10Okano I.

An anti-cofilin antibody (COF-1) was prepared by immunizing rabbits with His6-cofilin, which was purified from lysates ofEscherichia coli expressing it, using as nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Rabbit anti-P-cofilin antibody specific to the Ser-3-phosphorylated forms of cofilin and ADF was raised against the phosphopeptide acetyl-A(pS)GVAVSDC and purified, as described (28Toshima J. Toshima J.Y. Amano T. Yang N. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1131-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Anti-Myc epitope monoclonal antibody (9E10) and anti-HA epitope monoclonal antibody (12CA5) were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, suspended in the lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A), and incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation, protein concentrations in cell lysates were determined in a Micro BCA protein assay (Pierce), and equal amounts of protein were precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1 h. The supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-LIMK1 (C-10) antibody or 9E10 anti-Myc antibody, and protein A-Sepharose. After centrifugation, the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and used for in vitro kinase reaction and immunoblot analysis. For immunoblot analysis, cell lysates or immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked overnight with 4% nonfat dry milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with primary antibody diluted in PBS containing 1% nonfat dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20. After washing in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG or sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoreactive protein bands were visualized using an ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and then three times with kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.2, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A) and incubated for 1 h at 30 °C in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 50 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) and 2 μg of His6-cofilin. The reaction mixture was solubilized in Laemmli's sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1% SDS, 0.002% bromphenol blue) for 5 min at 95 °C, and aliquots were separated on SDS-PAGE, using 15 and 8% gels. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membrane from a 15% gel was subjected to autoradiography to measure 32P-labeled cofilin, using the BAS1800 Bio-Image Analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan), and Amido Black staining. The membrane from the 8% gel was analyzed by immunoblotting with the C-10 anti-LIMK1 antibody or the 9E10 anti-Myc antibody to detect LIMK. The kinase activity was normalized by dividing the radioactivity incorporated into cofilin by the immunoreactive density of LIMK estimated using a densitometer. Anti-LIMK1 immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer without phosphatase inhibitors and then three times with phosphatase buffer (1 mmMgSO4 and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and treated for 1 h at 25 °C with 20 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Takara Biochemicals, Tokyo) in 30 μl of phosphatase buffer, then the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors and three times with kinase buffer and subjected to in vitro kinase reaction, as described above. HeLa cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min and permeabilized with absolute methanol for 10 min at −20 °C. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min, cells were stained with anti-P-cofilin antibody followed by staining with rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Chemicon). 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Molecular Probes) was used for DNA staining. After washing with PBS, coverslips were mounted on a glass slide and images were obtained using a Leica DMLB fluorescence microscope. To investigate the role of LIMK1 during the cell cycle, we first examined the kinase activity of LIMK1 in different stages of the cell cycle. For cell cycle analysis, HeLa cells were synchronized at the beginning of S phase by double thymidine block. At different times after release from double thymidine block, cells were lysed, and endogenous LIMK1 was immunoprecipitated and subjected to in vitro kinase assay, using His6-cofilin as a substrate. Cell cycle progression was monitored by flow cytometry (Fig.1A) and DAPI staining (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1B, LIMK1 prepared from cells at 9 h after release from the thymidine block, when about 40% of the cells were in mitotic phase (as measured by DAPI staining), had 2.6-fold higher kinase activity than that of LIMK1 from cells at 6 h after release, when about 90% of the cells were in S phase (as determined using flow cytometry). At 12 h after release, about 80% of the cells had gone through cytokinesis and entered the G1 phase, and here the kinase activity of LIMK1 reverted to the level seen in LIMK1 in cells at 6 h. Immunoblot analysis revealed that slow migrating bands of LIMK1 appeared at 9 h, although the total amount of LIMK1 remained unchanged throughout the cell cycle. The gel migration shift and activation of LIMK1 became prominent when cells were more stringently synchronized at the early mitotic phase by treatment with the microtubule-depolymerizing agent, nocodazole (Fig.1C). LIMK1 from cells in the early mitotic phase had a 5.8-fold higher kinase activity than in the interphase. Mitotic LIMK1 significantly retarded mobility on gel electrophoresis compared with interphase LIMK1 (Fig. 1C). To determine whether the activation and mobility shift of mitotic LIMK1 were related to the phosphorylation, LIMK1 was treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. This treatment abrogated the mobility shift and activation of mitotic LIMK1 (Fig. 1D). Effects of phosphatase were nil when phosphatase inhibitors were present (data not shown). These results suggest that the slow migrating bands are the phosphorylated forms of LIMK1 and that LIMK1 is specifically activated and phosphorylated in the mitotic phase. To search for the mechanism of mitosis-specific activation and gel mobility shift of LIMK1, Myc-tagged wild-type LIMK1 and its kinase-inactive mutant LIMK1(D460A), in which the catalytic residue Asp-460 is replaced by alanine, were transiently expressed in HeLa cells, and these cells were synchronized at the mitotic phase, using nocodazole. As shown in Fig.2A, the transiently expressed Myc-LIMK1 in mitotic cells showed a gel mobility shift and a 6.4-fold increase in the kinase activity compared with Myc-LIMK1 in interphase cells. Thus, the transiently expressed Myc-LIMK1 behaves similarly to endogenous LIMK1. In both interphase and mitotic cells, Myc-LIMK1(D460A) immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells exhibited no cofilin phosphorylating activity, which suggests that Myc-LIMK1 immunoprecipitates were probably not contaminated with other cofilin-phosphorylating kinases. Similar to Myc-LIMK1, Myc-LIMK1(D460A) was retarded on gel electrophoresis, which means that autophosphorylation of LIMK1 may not be involved in mobility shift of mitotic LIMK1. Myc-LIMK2 transiently expressed in HeLa cells exhibited a 1.8-fold increase in the kinase activity in mitotic phase, but the gel mobility shift of Myc-LIMK2 was not visible after cells had been treated with nocodazole (Fig. 2B). Thus, it is likely that LIMK2 is at least in part involved in cofilin phosphorylation during mitosis. To determine the region involved in the mitosis-specific phosphorylation and activation of LIMK1, an expression plasmid coding for an N-terminally truncated mutant of LIMK1, Myc-LIMK1(PK) (Fig.2C), was constructed and transfected into HeLa cells. As reported (29Nagata K. Ohashi K. Yang N. Mizuno K. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 99-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in interphase cells, LIMK1(PK) exhibited significant increases in kinase activity compared with the activity of wild-type LIMK1 (Fig. 2D). Although the LIMK1(PK) mutant was activated further by ROCK in in vitro experiments (17Ohashi K. Nagata K. Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3577-3582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), it was not activated further in mitotic phase, and a gel mobility shift of mitotic LIMK1(PK) mutant was never observed (Fig. 2D). Thus, the N-terminal region of LIMK1 containing LIM and PDZ domains may be involved in the mitosis-specific mobility shift (phosphorylation) and activation of LIMK1. We attempted to show the gel mobility shift of the N-terminal fragment of LIMK1 in mitosis, but it was not successful because the protein band of the fragment expressed in HeLa cells was not detectable in mitotic cell lysates, probably because of its instability. Previous studies revealed that LIMK1 is activated by protein kinases, ROCK and PAK, through phosphorylation at Thr-508 within the kinase domain of LIMK1 (15Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 16Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 3577-3582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether ROCK and/or PAK is involved in the activation and mobility shift of LIMK1 in mitosis. To examine the role of ROCK in this regard, HeLa cells were treated with Y-27632, a specific inhibitor of ROCK (30Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar), and the activity and gel mobility of mitotic LIMK1 were analyzed using in vitro kinase assay and immunoblotting. Gel retardation of mitotic LIMK1 was observed in the presence of Y-27632 (Fig. 3A).In vitro kinase assay revealed that the kinase activity of mitotic LIMK1 was only faintly reduced by Y-27632 treatment (Fig.3A). Thus, a protein kinase(s) other than ROCK seems to be involved in the mitosis-specific mobility shift and activation of LIMK1. We next examined the role of PAK in mitosis-specific activation and mobility shift of LIMK1. As an inhibitor for PAK, we used an autoinhibitory domain of PAK (PAK-AI). As reported (15Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), expression of PAK-AI inhibited the activation of LIMK1 induced by RacV12, a constitutively active form of Rac (Fig. 3B), thereby indicating that PAK-AI has the potential to inhibit PAK activity in cultured cells. Because the coexpression of PAK-AI and LIMK1 into HeLa cells did not interfere with mobility shift or activation of LIMK1 in mitosis (Fig. 3C), PAK does not appear to have a role in this regard. To determine further whether phosphorylation of Thr-508 by ROCK, PAK, or other protein kinases is involved in the mitotic mobility shift and activation of LIMK1, we expressed in HeLa cells LIMK1(T508V), in which Thr-508 is replaced by nonphosphorylatable valine, and analyzed its gel mobility and kinase activity in mitotic phase. Similar to wild-type LIMK1, LIMK1(T508V) in mitosis migrated slowly on the gel (Fig.3D), thereby clearly indicating that phosphorylation at Thr-508 is not related to the mobility shift of mitotic LIMK1 and that phosphorylation of residue(s) other than Thr-508 is responsible for the gel retardation. As reported (31Edwards D.C. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11352-11361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), replacing Thr-508 by Val significantly reduced the kinase activity of LIMK1 (Fig.3D). However, kinase activity of the LIMK1(T508V) mutant increased about 3-fol"

These effects resulted in decreased secretion of apoB-100-very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and an increased secretion of apoB-100 on low density lipoproteins/intermediate density lipoproteins. ApoB-48-VLDL was also replaced by more dense particles. The proteasomal inhibitor lactacystin did not influence the recovery of apoB-100 or apoB-48 in primary rat hepatocytes, indicating that co-translational (proteasomal) degradation is of less importance in these cells. Treatment with WY 14,643 made the recovery of apoB-100 sensitive to lactacystin, most likely reflecting the decreased biosynthesis of triglycerides. The PPARα agonist induced a significant increase in the accumulation of pulse-labeled apoB-100 even after a short pulse (2–5 min). There was also an increase in apoB-100 nascent polypeptides, indicating that the co-translational degradation of apoB-100 was inhibited. However, a minor influence on an early posttranslation degradation cannot be excluded. This decreased co-translational degradation of apoB-100 explained the increased secretion of the protein. The levels of apoB-48 remained unchanged during these pulse-chase experiments, and albumin production was not affected, indicating a specific effect of PPARα agonists on the co-translational degradation of apoB-100. These findings explain the difference in the rate of secretion of the two apoB proteins seen after PPARα activation. PPARα agonists increased the expression and biosynthesis of liver fatty acid-binding protein (LFABP). Increased expression of LFABP by transfection of McA-RH7777 cells increased the secretion of apoB-100, decreased triglyceride biosynthesis and secretion, and increased PPARα mRNA levels. These findings suggest that PPARα and LFABP could interact to amplify the effect of endogenous PPARα agonists on the assembly of VLDL.

Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar). PPARα is also activated by so-called peroxisome proliferators, a group of compounds that includes the lipid-lowering fibrates (1Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The activation of PPARα results in important and diverse effects on lipid metabolism, such as an increase in the transcription of genes involved in mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation, and the regulation of the expression of apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, apoC-III (2Schoonjans K.

Moreover, PPARα regulates the transcription of LFABP, and the LFABP gene promotor has a PPAR-responsive element (2Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. J.

LFABP serves as an intracellular acceptor of LCFAs, which can enhance both the cellular uptake and the intracellular diffusion of these fatty acids (Refs. 12Luxon B.A. Weisiger R.A. Am. J.

This function of LFABP may be reflected in the observations that the protein stimulates enzyme activities and processes that depend on fatty acids (9Bass N.M. Int. Rev.

Metab. 2000; 11: 175-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and seems to participate in the trafficking of PPARα ligands, such as LCFAs, to the nucleus (21Lawrence J.W. Kroll D.J. Eacho P.I. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1390-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, LFABP may have an important role in the regulation of the ligand-dependent transactivation of PPARα via a direct protein-protein interaction with PPARα in the nucleus (22Wolfrum C. Borrmann C.M. Borchers T. Spener F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2323-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). In summary, the available results indicate that LFABP has a role in a fatty acid-driven regulation of the transcription of PPARα-regulated genes. Because LCFA has a key role in the biological activities of the two proteins, it is possible that PPARα and LFABP have important roles in the regulation of the assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins, processes that are highly dependent on LCFAs.The process involved in the assembly of these lipoproteins has recently been reviewed (23Olofsson S.-O. Asp L. Borén J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 24Olofsson S.-O. Stillemark-Billton P. Asp L. Trends Cardiovasc.

This lipidation is followed by the uptake of the major amount of triglycerides in a second step of assembly (26Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The process is highly dependent on lipid biosynthesis and the availability of fatty acids (for review, see Refs.23Olofsson S.-O. Asp L. Borén J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar and 24Olofsson S.-O. Stillemark-Billton P. Asp L. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It is also well known that the regulation of apoB production involves a variation in the co-translational or posttranslational degradation of the protein (for reviews with references, see Refs. 23Olofsson S.-O. Asp L. Borén J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 24Olofsson S.-O. Stillemark-Billton P. Asp L. Trends Cardiovasc.

Thus, it has recently been demonstrated that apoB undergoes degradation at three levels: (i) co-translationally, most likely from the translocon, a process that involves proteasomes (28Fisher E.A.

Chem. 1990; 265: 16741-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The size of the assembled very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) has been demonstrated to be of importance for the size, turnover, and atherogenicity of the LDLs formed during the intravascular degradation of VLDL. Factors that influence the size of the assembled VLDL could therefore be of great importance for the atherogenicity of LDL. It has previously been shown that insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes give rise to large VLDLs that are converted to small dense LDLs with a half-life of 5 days (see Ref. 31Taskinen M.R. Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 2001; 109: S180-S188Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar for review). The role of PPARα for the size of apoB-containing lipoproteins has not been elucidated in detail; however, it has been demonstrated that PPARα agonists induce a dramatic decrease in the apoB-48-containing VLDL particles secreted from rat hepatocytes. Instead, apoB-48 is secreted on particles that band in the HDL density range (32Okochi E. Nishimaki-Mogami T. Suzuki K. Takahashi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).We have used primary rat hepatocytes as well as the rat hepatoma cell line McA-RH7777 to investigate the importance of PPARα activation and LFABP for the assembly and secretion of the apoB-containing lipoproteins.DISCUSSIONThe results presented in this study indicate that the activation of PPARα by known agonists increased the secretion of apoB-100, but not that of apoB-48. Our observations that neither the expression of apoB mRNA nor the editing of this mRNA was changed when primary hepatocytes were treated with PPARα agonists indicate that the increased production of apoB-100 reflects a decreased degradation of the protein rather than an increased biosynthesis. It is well known that co-translational or posttranslational degradation has an important role in the regulation of apoB-100 production (for reviews with references, see Refs. 23Olofsson S.-O. Asp L. Borén J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 24Olofsson S.-O. Stillemark-Billton P. Asp L. Trends Cardiovasc.

Nutr. 2000; 20: 169-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and apoB seems to undergo degradation at three levels: (i) co-translational or early posttranslational degradation involving proteasomes (this degradation has been referred to as endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation) (28Fisher E.A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 27855-27863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar); and (iii) postsecretory degradation via the LDL receptor (28Fisher E.A. Pan M. Chen X., Wu, X.

The activation of PPARα had a complex influence on the intracellular degradation of apoB-100. Because the PPARα agonists decreased the rate of triglyceride biosynthesis, these agonists gave rise to an increase in the proteasomal degradation of apoB-100 (28Fisher E.A. Pan M. Chen X., Wu, X.

This conclusion is based on the finding of an increased recovery of apoB-100 when PPARα agonist-treated cells were incubated with the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. This effect of lactacystin was only seen after the pulse, when apoB-100 was still in or close to the translocon, and disappeared when apoB-100 had moved away from the site of synthesis after a 15-min chase. This is in agreement with the proposed involvement of proteasomes in the co-translational or early posttranslational degradation of apoB-100. Our results also indicate that the extra protein saved by the inhibition of the proteasomes was lost during the chase. Thus, the protein that escapes proteasomal degradation due to treatment with lactacystin will be removed by another mechanism during the transfer through the secretory pathway. Interestingly, the PPARα agonist treatment did not result in lactacystin sensitivity for apoB-48. This difference between apoB-100 and apoB-48 may reflect a difference in the need for co-translational lipidation.Based on the failure of lactacystin to influence the recovery of apoB in control cells, we conclude that there is virtually no proteasomal degradation of apoB-100 or apoB-48 in primary hepatocytes. This is in contrast to the observations in commonly used hepatoma cell lines (28Fisher E.A. Pan M. Chen X., Wu, X. Wang H. Jamil H. Sparks J.D. Williams K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27855-27863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar,48Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M., Wu, X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20427-20434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and could indicate that co-translational degradation is of no importance in normal hepatocytes. However, the observation that the PPARα agonist induced an increase in proteasome-dependent degradation of apoB-100 (by inhibiting the rate of biosynthesis of triglycerides) indicates that proteasomal co-translational degradation is functional and also participates in the regulation of production of apoB-100 in normal hepatocytes.The major effect of the PPARα agonists was a decreased intracellular degradation of apoB-100, an effect that was not seen for apoB-48 or albumin. Thus, there is a fundamental difference in the intracellular turnover of apoB-100 and apoB-48. The increase in apoB-100 was already seen after a short pulse when the protein was close to the translocon, indicating that the influence of the PPARα agonist on the secretion of apoB-100 occurs early during the intracellular transfer,i.e. during the co-translational period and/or the very early posttranslational period. The observation of a significant (1.7-fold) increase in the longer apoB-100 nascent chains in the agonist-treated cells supports this conclusion and indicates that a significant part of the effect of the PPARα agonist could be explained by an inhibition of the co-translational degradation of apoB-100. Together, our results indicate that the effect of the PPARα agonist on the co-translational degradation and perhaps also on a very early posttranslational degradation explains the increased secretion of apoB-100 that is induced by the PPARα agonists.The results presented in this study also indicate that PPARα is of importance for regulation of the type of apoB-containing particles that are assembled and secreted. In the case of apoB-48, the secretion of VLDL virtually disappeared; instead, there was an increase in the secretion of the dense apoB-48-containing particles. This finding confirms results by other authors (32Okochi E. Nishimaki-Mogami T. Suzuki K. Takahashi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and agrees well with our previous results, indicating that the assembly of apoB-48-VLDL is highly dependent on the availability of fatty acids and the biosynthesis of triglycerides (26Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Lindén D. Sjöberg A. Asp L. Carlsson L. Oscarsson J. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 279: E1335-E1346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Sjöberg A. Oscarsson J. Borén J. Edén S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 275-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the production of apoB-48 is not influenced, the decrease in the rate of triglyceride biosynthesis most likely explains the change in density of the secreted particles.The secretion of apoB-100-VLDL also decreased; instead, there was a significant increase in the secretion of particles banding in the IDL and LDL density ranges. This change in density of the particles could be explained by the increased production of apoB-100 and the decrease in both the biosynthesis and secretion of triglycerides. Thus, the activation of PPARα gave rise to more apoB-100 particles with less triglycerides and higher density, in turn indicating that the size and triglyceride load of the VLDL particles can be regulated by PPARα. Our observations may therefore give some insight into the mechanism of the hypolipidemic action of fibrates. Thus, the well known lowering of the plasma triglycerides could be explained, at least in part, by the decreased secretion of triglycerides. The cholesterol-lowering and antiatherogenic effect may be explained by the change toward a secretion of smaller, less triglyceride-rich apoB-containing lipoproteins. It has been shown that smaller, less triglyceride-rich VLDLs promote the formation of less atherogenic LDL particles with shorter half-lives than those generated when large triglyceride-rich VLDLs are secreted (see Ref. 31Taskinen M.R. Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 2001; 109: S180-S188Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar for review).It has been shown previously that PPARα agonists induce the transcription of LFABP, and this was confirmed in the present study. LFABP could influence the assembly and secretion of apoB-100-containing lipoproteins in at least two ways. First, LFABP is an acceptor of long-chain fatty acids, which enhances their uptake and intracellular transport (12Luxon B.A. Weisiger R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G831-G841PubMed Google Scholar, 13Luxon B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G113-G120PubMed Google Scholar, 51Murphy E.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G244-G249PubMed Google Scholar, 52Luxon B.A. Milliano M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G361-G366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the assembly and secretion of apoB have been demonstrated to be highly dependent on fatty acids. Secondly, LFABP may enhance the transactivating activity of PPARα (22Wolfrum C. Borrmann C.M. Borchers T. Spener F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2323-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), which in turn could influence the assembly and secretion of apoB-100. We observed that the expression of LFABP gave rise to a 2- to 3-fold increase in the intracellular pool and the secretion of apoB-100. The magnitude of this increase is in the order of that seen after treatment of hepatoma cells with oleic acids (Refs. 26Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 33Boström K. Borén J. Wettesten M. Sjöberg A. Bondjers G. Wiklund O. Carlsson P. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4434-4442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; see Ref. 24Olofsson S.-O. Stillemark-Billton P. Asp L. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar for review with references), a well-known inducer of apoB secretion in such cells. However, this increase in the apoB-100 secretion is also of the same magnitude as that seen after treatment of the McA-RH7777 cells (and primary rat hepatocytes) with PPARα agonists. In contrast to what could be expected from an increased supply of fatty acids and from the observations in in vitro studies (14Murphy E.J. Prows D.R. Jefferson J.R. Schroeder F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 20Prows D.R. Murphy E.J. Schroeder F. Lipids. 1995; 30: 907-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), overexpression of LFABP gave rise to a decrease in the secretion of triglycerides. Thus, in this way, the effect of the overexpression of LFABP is reminiscent of the changes induced by the PPARα agonists, and, indeed, we observed that an increase in the intracellular levels of LFABP gave rise to an increase in the expression of PPARα. One explanation for this observation is the above-mentioned LFABP-dependent increase in the transacting activity of PPARα (22Wolfrum C. Borrmann C.M. Borchers T. Spener F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2323-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Such an increase may lead to an increased expression of PPARα itself because this gene is activated by PPARα (3Gebel T. Arand M. Oesch F. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Our observation may therefore suggest a mechanism that amplifies the effect of a PPARα agonist on the assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins. Thus, the ligand increases the expression of LFABP, which enhances the transacting activity of PPARα. This effect gives rise to an increase in the transcription of PPARα itself, which influences the genes involved in inhibition of the co-translational and/or early posttranslational degradation of apoB-100 and the biosynthesis of triglycerides.The observation that overexpression of LFABP failed to induce the change in density of the secreted apoB-100 particles that was seen in the agonist-treated primary rat hepatocytes may argue against the hypothesis that LFABP exerts its influence on VLDL assembly by increasing PPARα levels. One reason could be that neither the decrease in triglyceride biosynthesis nor the decrease in secretion of triglycerides was as large as that seen in the agonist-treated cells. This finding may reflect a lack of a strong PPARα agonist in these experiments. The addition of a PPARα agonist would have obscured the effects of the overexpression of LFABP.The expression of LFABP in the McA-RH7777 cells resulted in an increased secretion of apoB-48. This was not observed in the PPARα agonist-treated primary hepatocytes. When evaluating this result, it should be kept in mind that there were differences in the regulation of secretion of apoB-48 between primary cells and McA-RH7777 cells, differences that were not seen for apoB-100. Thus, apoB-48 is not secreted as VLDL from the McA-RH7777 cells unless they are cultured in the presence of oleic acid (data not shown) (26Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primary cells, on the other hand, also secrete apoB-48 on VLDL particles in the absence of oleic acid (36Lindén D. Sjöberg A. Asp L. Carlsson L. Oscarsson J. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 279: E1335-E1346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Sjöberg A. Oscarsson J. Borén J. Edén S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 275-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, under the conditions needed to investigate the effect of overexpression of LFABP, the second step in the assembly of apoB-48-VLDL was not active. Moreover, clofibrate induced an increase in secretion of apoB-48 in McA-RH7777 cells (data not shown), whereas such an increase was not observed in primary cells. We have therefore confined the comparison between the primary cells and McA-RH7777 cells to apoB-100. However"
https://openalex.org/W2029452465,"Once a mutation in the gene tub was identified as the cause of obesity, retinal degeneration and hearing loss in tubby mice, it became increasingly evident that the members of the tub gene family (tulps) influence maintenance and function of the neuronal cell lineage. Suggested molecular functions of tubby-like proteins include roles in vesicular trafficking, mediation of insulin signaling and gene transcription. The mechanisms through which tub functions in neurons, however, have yet to be elucidated. Here we report the positional cloning of an auditory quantitative trait locus (QTL), the modifier of tubby hearing 1 gene (moth1), whose wildtype alleles from strains AKR/J, CAST/Ei and 129P2/OlaHsd protect tubby mice from hearing loss. Through a transgenic rescue experiment, we verified that sequence polymorphisms in the neuron-specific microtubule-associated protein 1a gene (Mtap1a) observed in the susceptible strain C57BL/6J (B6) are crucial for the hearing-loss phenotype. We also show that these polymorphisms change the binding efficiency of MTAP1A to postsynaptic density molecule 95 (PSD95), a core component in the cytoarchitecture of synapses. This indicates that at least some of the observed polymorphisms are functionally important and that the hearing loss in C57BL/6J-tub/tub (B6-tub/tub) mice may be caused by impaired protein interactions involving MTAP1A. We therefore propose that tub may be associated with synaptic function in neuronal cells."

UDP-GalNAc:polypeptideN-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase green fluorescent protein N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine O-Linked protein glycosylation is initiated by the action of a family of enzymes known as the UDP-GalNAc:polypeptideN-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (ppGaNTases)1 (EC 2.4.1.41). The members of this enzyme family catalyze the transfer of GalNAc from the nucleotide sugar UDP-GalNAc to the hydroxyl group of either serine or threonine in protein substrates, performing the first committed step in the synthesis of mucin-type O-glycans.

A number of functional roles have been proposed for mucin-typeO-glycans (13Van den Steen P. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Opdenakker G. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 151-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar); however, direct evidence implicating this enzyme family in biological functions as well as demonstrating their necessity for mammalian viability is still lacking. While ablation of members of this gene family in mice is ongoing, no definitive phenotypes are yet evident. A strain deficient in ppGaNTase-T1 (14Westerman E.L. Ellies L.G. Hagen F.K. Marek K.W. Sutton-Smith M. Dell A. Tabak L.A. Marth J.D. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1121Google Scholar), while displaying altered lectin staining patterns, is viable and fertile, as is a knockout of another putative isoform (15Hennet T. Hagen F.K. Tabak L.A. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12070-12074Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Through sequence homology searches of the Drosophila melanogaster genome data base and text searches of FlyBase, potential members of the ppGaNTase enzyme family are readily recognized. One putative isoform (l(2)35Aa; hereafter referred to as pgant35A) is documented in FlyBase as having lethal allelic mutations generated by ethylmethanesulfonate mutagenesis (16Ashburner M. Misra S. Roote J. Lewis S.E. Blazej R. Davis T. Doyle C. Galle R. George R. Harris N. Hartzell G. Harvey D. Hong L. Houston K. Hoskins R. Johnson G. Martin C. Moshrefi A. Palazzolo M. Reese M.G. Spradling A. Tsang G. Wan K. Whitelaw K. Kimmel B. Celniker S. Rubin G.M. Genetics. 1999; 153: 179-219PubMed Google Scholar). These mutations are recessive lethal, arresting during early pupal development (16Ashburner M. Misra S. Roote J. Lewis S.E. Blazej R. Davis T. Doyle C. Galle R. George R. Harris N. Hartzell G. Harvey D. Hong L. Houston K. Hoskins R. Johnson G. Martin C. Moshrefi A. Palazzolo M. Reese M.G. Spradling A. Tsang G. Wan K. Whitelaw K. Kimmel B. Celniker S. Rubin G.M. Genetics. 1999; 153: 179-219PubMed Google Scholar), and are rescued by a genomic fragment containing the putative pgant35A gene (17Flores C. Engels W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2964-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). While these studies suggest that the mutations responsible for the recessive lethal phenotype may lie in the pgant35A gene, the molecular nature of these mutations was not defined, and it remains possible that other open reading frames within this genomic fragment may have been responsible for the rescue. To begin to address its role in the lethal phenotype observed, we have cloned pgant35A from a D. melanogaster embryonic cDNA library and expressed it as a recombinant protein, demonstrating that it encodes a biochemically active transferase. Sequencing of the pgant35A gene from homozygous mutant embryos of three independent mutant strains revealed unique mutations within the coding region of pgant35A, all of which would result in the production of truncated or enzymatically compromised proteins. This study demonstrates that the molecular defect resulting in the lethal phenotype of these mutants lies within thepgant35A gene and provides the first direct evidence for the involvement of a member of the ppGaNTase family in normal eukaryotic development. The amino acid consensus sequence SPTMAGGLFAVNRKYFQHLGEY, derived from the conserved region of previously characterized mammalian ppGaNTases, was used to perform a tBLASTn search against the existing D. melanogaster genome data base present in NCBI to identify all potential members of this enzyme family. The 14 predicted D. melanogaster ppGaNTase gene sequences obtained were aligned to identify highly conserved regions on which to base degenerate probes to screen cDNA libraries. The primers MAGGLF-S (dATGGCCGGCGGNCTGTTTGCCAT) and WGGEN-AS (dATCTCCANATTCTCGCCGCCCCA) were used to amplify a 100-bp fragment from D. melanogastergenomic DNA. This amplified genomic fragment was then radioactively labeled using the Random Primers DNA Labeling System (Invitrogen) and used to probe a D. melanogaster Canton-S embryo (2–14-h-old) UniZap cDNA library (Stratagene; catalog no. 937602). Hybridizations were performed in 5× SSPE plus 50% formamide at 42 °C with washes in 2× SSC plus 0.5% SDS for 5 min at room temperature and for 15 min at 65 °C. Positively hybridizing clones were further screened with a pgant35A isoform-specific primer, FlyH-762S (dTGCACGCGAGGCCGTGGGCGATG), hybridizing in 5× SSPE, 50% formamide at 30 °C with washes in 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS for 5 min at room temperature and 15 min at 42 °C. From this second round of screening, two independent cDNAs were isolated corresponding topgant35A. One clone (FlyH-2a) containing a complete open reading frame was completely sequenced on both strands (Lark Technologies, Inc.). In FlyBase, the locus occupied by pgant35A (l(2)35Aa) is documented as having three potential mutant alleles generated through ethylmethanesulfonate mutagenesis (16Ashburner M. Misra S. Roote J.

Embryos and larvae from these three balanced mutant stocks were screened on a fluorescent microscope, and those displaying no GFP fluorescence (and therefore homozygous for the mutant chromosomes) were isolated. DNA was extracted using DNAzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers within the genomic region flanking the pgant35A gene (FlyH-408-S (dTAGCATCTTCGGTGGCATC) and FlyH-2691-AS (dATATGCAGACATAACATATTCGTACAC)) were used to amplify a 2.3-kb fragment containing the pgant35a gene from the isolated genomic DNA. PCR products obtained from the DNA of each homozygous mutant were directly sequenced on both strands (ACGT, Inc.). Amino acid sequences were aligned, one pair at a time, using the pairwise ClustalW (1.4) algorithm in MacVector (Oxford Molecular Group). The following alignment modes and parameters were used: slow alignment, open gap penalty = 10, extended gap penalty = 0.1, similarity matrix = blosum, delay divergence = 40%, hydrophilic penalties and residue-specific penalties. The percentage of amino acid sequence similarity displayed in Table I represents the sum of the percentages of identities and similarities. A tBLASTn search of the human genome data base (NCBI) was performed with the entire predicted amino acid sequence of PGANT35A to identify the putative human orthologue, FLJ21634.

Primers from within the coding region of pgant35A, FlyH-1330-S (dCCTCATCAAGTCGGAGAACG) and FlyH-2175-AS (dAGGCACAGCAACTTGTCCAG), were used to specifically amplify an 845-bp product under the following conditions: 35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 67 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min followed by one cycle of 72 °C for 10 min. rp49 control PCR amplifications were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reaction products were electrophoresed in a 1% TAE-agarose gel and photographed on a Bio-Rad Fluor-STMMultiImager. Poly(A)+ RNA from Drosophila embryos, larvae, and adults (CLONTECH) was electrophoresed in a 0.7% formaldehyde agarose gel and transferred to Hybond-NX membranes (Amersham Biosciences) according to Sambrook et al. (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.43-7.52Google Scholar). A unique 520-bp segment of the pgant35A cDNA region was amplified from the FlyH-2a plasmid using the primers FlyH-IS+ (dATAGGTACCAAGCTTATCTAATTTATTCCGATC- ATCATGAAAGTGAC) and FlyH-IS- (dATAGAGCTCGAGTCCGCTTCCGTGGTCTCCTG). The PCR product was cut withKpnI/SacI and cloned into theKpnI/SacI sites of pBluescript KS+ to generate the vector pBSFlyH-IS. pBSFlyH-IS was digested with HindIII, and the antisense strand of the pgant35A insert was radiolabeled with [32P]UTP using the MAXIscriptTM In Vitro Transcription Kit (T7 RNA polymerase) (Ambion). Hybridizations with the riboprobe were carried out in 5× SSPE plus 50% formamide at 68 °C with a final wash in 2× SSC plus 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 20 min.

An MluI site was introduced into a fragment of the FlyH-2a cDNA by PCR amplification using the primers FlyH-305S (dTCTACGCGTACAGCCTGCGC) and FlyH-BglII-AS (dGAAGATCTTCCGCTTCCGTGGTCTCCTG). This amplified product was digested with MluI and BglII and cloned into the vector pIMKF4 to create the vector, pF4-FlyH-349. Sequencing was performed to verify that no PCR-induced mutations had been sustained in the cloned product. A 1.8-kb BstEII/BamHI fragment from the FlyH-2a cDNA was then cloned into theBstEII/BglII sites of pF4-FlyH-349 to generate the mammalian expression vector, pF4-f35A. pF4-f35A is an SV40-based expression vector that generates a fusion protein containing the following, in order: an insulin secretion signal, a metal binding site, a heart muscle kinase site, a FLAGTM epitope tag, and the truncated pgant35A gene. The SF32 mutant allele of pgant35A was cloned into the pIMKF4 expression vector by using the genomic amplification product obtained from the homozygous mutant embryos from the GFP balancer/SF32 stock described above. Because this gene contains no introns, we were able to clone directly from the genomic PCR product. The 2.3-kb PCR fragment was digested with BstEII to generate a cloning fragment with a 5′ BstEII end and a blunt 3′ end; this fragment was then cloned into theBstEII/NotI(blunt) sites of pF4FlyH-349 to generate the SV40-based recombinant expression vector, pF4-SF32.

Degenerate PCR probes, based on amino acid consensus sequences derived from putative D. melanogaster ppGaNTases found in the data base, were used to isolate the pgant35A cDNA from a D. melanogaster Canton S embryonic cDNA library (Stratagene). As shown in Fig. 1, conceptual translation of the pgant35A cDNA reveals a type II membrane protein consisting of an 8-amino acid N-terminal cytoplasmic region, a 23-amino acid hydrophobic/transmembrane region, an 82-amino acid stem region, and a 519-amino acid putative catalytic region. The nucleotide sequence within the coding region of this cDNA clone differs from that of the predicted cDNA sequence found in FlyBase at 13 positions; one of these differences results in a threonine at amino acid position 72 (within the stem region) in place of the isoleucine found in the FlyBase predicted protein. TableI summarizes the degree of amino acid similarity (within the conserved region) between the conceptually translated PGANT35A protein from Fig. 1 and each of the functionally characterized mammalian isoforms. PGANT35A displays the greatest degree of similarity within this region to ppGaNTase-hT2 and the lowest degree of similarity to ppGaNTase-rT7, the previously characterized glycopeptide transferase. The PGANT35A amino acid sequence was also used to search the public human genome data base (NCBI) for putative orthologues. One putative human ppGaNTase (FLJ21634) shares the greatest degree of amino acid similarity to PGANT35A (71%) of all isoforms identified (Table I).

https://openalex.org/W1995691954,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a promising vector for gene transfer in cystic fibrosis. AAV4 and AAV5 both bind to the apical surface of differentiated human airway epithelia, but only AAV5 infects. Both AAV4 and AAV5 require 2,3-linked sialic acid for binding. However, AAV5 interacts with sialic acid onN-linked carbohydrates, whereas AAV4 interacts with sialic acid on O-linked carbohydrates. Because mucin is decorated with O-linked carbohydrates, we hypothesized that mucin binds AAV4 and inhibits gene transfer. To evaluate the effect of secreted mucin, we studied mucin binding and gene transfer to COS cells and the basolateral membrane of well differentiated human airway epithelia. AAV4 bound mucin more efficiently than AAV5, and mucin inhibited gene transfer with AAV4. Moreover,O-glycosidase-pretreated mucin did not block gene transfer with AAV4. Similar to secreted mucin, the transmembrane mucin MUC1 inhibited gene transfer with AAV4 but not AAV5. MUC1 inhibited AAV4 by blocking internalization of the virus. Thus, O-linked carbohydrates of mucin are potent inhibitors of AAV4. Furthermore, whereas mucin plays an important role in innate host defense, its activity is specific; some vectors or pathogens are more resistant to its effects. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a promising vector for gene transfer in cystic fibrosis. AAV4 and AAV5 both bind to the apical surface of differentiated human airway epithelia, but only AAV5 infects. Both AAV4 and AAV5 require 2,3-linked sialic acid for binding. However, AAV5 interacts with sialic acid onN-linked carbohydrates, whereas AAV4 interacts with sialic acid on O-linked carbohydrates. Because mucin is decorated with O-linked carbohydrates, we hypothesized that mucin binds AAV4 and inhibits gene transfer. To evaluate the effect of secreted mucin, we studied mucin binding and gene transfer to COS cells and the basolateral membrane of well differentiated human airway epithelia. AAV4 bound mucin more efficiently than AAV5, and mucin inhibited gene transfer with AAV4. Moreover,O-glycosidase-pretreated mucin did not block gene transfer with AAV4. Similar to secreted mucin, the transmembrane mucin MUC1 inhibited gene transfer with AAV4 but not AAV5. MUC1 inhibited AAV4 by blocking internalization of the virus. Thus, O-linked carbohydrates of mucin are potent inhibitors of AAV4.

Surprisingly, both AAV4 and AAV5 require 2,3-linked sialic acid for binding and infection (28Walters R.W., Yi, S.M. Keshavjee S. Brown K.E. Welsh M.J. Chiorini J.A. Zabner J. J. Biol.

Virol. 2000; 74: 3852-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Because both AAV4 and AAV5 require 2,3-linked sialic acid to infect cells but differ with respect to other aspects of the carbohydrate (i.e. O-linkedversus N-linked), we conclude mucin has a specific binding function. This finding is relevant both for the development of airway and intestine-targeted vectors and for understanding innate host defenses against invading microorganisms.Implications for Gene TransferRational development of gene transfer vectors requires an understanding of the steps required and barriers that prevent efficient delivery of genes. Recent work has focused on elucidating the barriers that prevent gene transfer from the apical membrane of airway epithelia. For instance, AAV5 is better than AAV2, because there are more apical receptors for AAV5. However, other barriers that precede receptor binding may also be important. For example, mucin seems to have activity against several candidate gene transfer vectors including adenovirus (41Arcasoy S.M. Latoche J. Gondor M. Watkins S.C. Henderson R.A. Hughey R. Finn O.J. Pilewski J.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 422-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition, previous work showed that mucin can be used to purify AAV5 (42Auricchio A. O'Connor E. Hildinger M. Wilson J.M. Mol. Ther. 2001; 4: 372-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Given that AAV5 binds N-linked carbohydrates, these two points raise the question of whether AAV5 binds mucin specifically and whether mucin affects AAV5 function in vivo. We observed that mucin inhibits AAV4 greater than AAV5, and AAV5 infects differentiated airway epithelia even in the presence of endogenous mucin/mucus both in vitro and in vivo as described above and previously (26Zabner J. Seiler M. Walters R. Kotin R.M. Fulgeras W. Davidson B.L. Chiorini J.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3852-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Hence, mucin specifically blocks vectors that interact withO-linked carbohydrates such as AAV4, and its impact on other vectors (i.e. AAV5) may not be therapeutically significant. These observations should aid in our understanding, development, and use of gene transfer vectors.Implications for Innate Host Defense and Viral PathogenesisWhereas mucin clearly plays a role in innate host defense, we do not understand the exact nature of its role. Mucin can inhibit pathogens that interact with O-linked carbohydrate (one example is rotavirus (13Willoughby R.E. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)). To circumvent this barrier, rotavirus evolved specific enzymatic activity that allows the virus to digest its way through the mucin layer (43Bisaillon M. Senechal S. Bernier L. Lemay G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 759-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition to this complex mechanism, our work suggests a different and perhaps simpler evolutionary mechanism for evading the mucin barrier. More specifically, recognizing N-linked carbohydrate as opposed to O-linked carbohydrate seems a significant step forward with respect to the ability of AAV to infect airway epithelia. In addition to its importance for this gene transfer vector, we speculate that this mechanism generally may be more applicable to pathogen evolution, possibly accounting for variability in virulence of viruses such as influenza.

Recent work has focused on elucidating the barriers that prevent gene transfer from the apical membrane of airway epithelia. For instance, AAV5 is better than AAV2, because there are more apical receptors for AAV5. However, other barriers that precede receptor binding may also be important. For example, mucin seems to have activity against several candidate gene transfer vectors including adenovirus (41Arcasoy S.M. Latoche J. Gondor M. Watkins S.C. Henderson R.A. Hughey R. Finn O.J. Pilewski J.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 422-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition, previous work showed that mucin can be used to purify AAV5 (42Auricchio A. O'Connor E. Hildinger M. Wilson J.M. Mol. Ther. 2001; 4: 372-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Given that AAV5 binds N-linked carbohydrates, these two points raise the question of whether AAV5 binds mucin specifically and whether mucin affects AAV5 function in vivo. We observed that mucin inhibits AAV4 greater than AAV5, and AAV5 infects differentiated airway epithelia even in the presence of endogenous mucin/mucus both in vitro and in vivo as described above and previously (26Zabner J. Seiler M. Walters R. Kotin R.M. Fulgeras W. Davidson B.L. Chiorini J.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3852-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Hence, mucin specifically blocks vectors that interact withO-linked carbohydrates such as AAV4, and its impact on other vectors (i.e. AAV5) may not be therapeutically significant. These observations should aid in our understanding, development, and use of gene transfer vectors.Implications for Innate Host Defense and Viral PathogenesisWhereas mucin clearly plays a role in innate host defense, we do not understand the exact nature of its role. Mucin can inhibit pathogens that interact with O-linked carbohydrate (one example is rotavirus (13Willoughby R.E. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)). To circumvent this barrier, rotavirus evolved specific enzymatic activity that allows the virus to digest its way through the mucin layer (43Bisaillon M. Senechal S. Bernier L. Lemay G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 759-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition to this complex mechanism, our work suggests a different and perhaps simpler evolutionary mechanism for evading the mucin barrier. More specifically, recognizing N-linked carbohydrate as opposed to O-linked carbohydrate seems a significant step forward with respect to the ability of AAV to infect airway epithelia. In addition to its importance for this gene transfer vector, we speculate that this mechanism generally may be more applicable to pathogen evolution, possibly accounting for variability in virulence of viruses such as influenza.

Using a p73α fragment consisting of amino acids 49–636 as bait, we found that p73α is functionally associated with the human homologue of mouse and hamster homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2). The hamster homologue, also known as haHIPK2 or PKM, was used for further characterization of interactions between HIPK2 and members of the p53 protein family. Systematic yeast two-hybrid assays indicated a physical interaction between the oligomerization domains of p73α and p53 (amino acid regions 345–380 and 319–360, respectively) and amino acid region 812–907 of haHIPK2. This region of haHIPK2 includes a PEST sequence, an Ubc9-binding domain, and a partial speckle retention sequence and is identical to amino acid residues 846–941 of human HIPK2 (hHIPK2). The interaction was confirmed by glutathioneS-transferase pull-down assays in vitro and immunoprecipitation assays in vivo. HIPK2 colocalized with p73 and p53 in nuclear bodies, as shown by confocal microscopy. Overexpression of HIPK2 stabilized the p53 protein and greatly increased the p73- and p53-induced transcriptional repression of multidrug-resistant and collagenase promoters in Saos2 cells but had little effect on the p73- or p53-mediated transcriptional activation of synthetic p53-responsive and p21WAF1 promoters. Stable expression of HIPK2 in U2OS cells enhanced the cisplatin response of sub-G1 and G2/M populations, and it also increased the apoptotic response to cisplatin and adriamycin as demonstrated by fluorescence-activated cell sorter and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-staining analyses. HIPK2 potentiated the inhibition of colony formation by p73 and p53. These results suggest that physical interactions between HIPK2 and members of the p53 family may determine the roles of these proteins in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.

Shomer B. Greenblatt M. Soussi T. Hovig E. Montesano R. Harris C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Some human tumors containing a normal p53 gene nonetheless exhibit functional inactivation of p53 at the protein level by cellular MDM2 or by viral oncoproteins, such as human papilloma virus E6, SV40 T antigen, and adenovirus E1B. As a transcriptional regulator, p53 modulates expression of various genes in response to cellular genotoxic stresses including DNA damage, oncogene activation, and hypoxia (2Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6670) Google Scholar). The effect of p53 on transcription is dependent upon the promoter context, type of stimulus, and cellular environment, so that it can function both as an activator and as a repressor (3Zhao R. Gish K. Murphy M. Yin Y. Notterman D. Hoffman W.H. Tom E. Mack D.H. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). One gene activated by p53 is p21WAF1, which encodes an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases and thus can initiate cell cycle arrest (4El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer E.W. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7869) Google Scholar). Other positively regulated targets include the GADD45, MDM2, cyclin G, KILLER/DR5, IGF-BP3, and Bax genes, whose products function as regulators of several aspects of cell growth (5Somasundaram K. El-Deiry W.S. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D424-D437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of p53 represses transcription of the MDR1 gene, which encodes a transmembrane glycophosphoprotein that mediates resistance to chemotherapeutic agents (6Chin K.V. Ueda K. Pastan I.

Recently, several groups identified p73 and p63 (also known as p51, KET, p40, p73L, and p53CP) as members of the p53 tumor suppressor family (28Kaelin Jr., W.G.

Like p53, both p73 and p63 can form homo-oligomers, bind to canonical p53 DNA binding sites, modulate transcription of p53-responsive genes, and suppress growth or induce apoptosis when overexpressed in certain human tumors (34Jost C.A.

Furthermore, their polypeptide sequences appear to contain the three principal domains of p53: (a) an N-terminal transcriptional activation domain (AD), (b) a sequence-specific DNA-binding domain (DBD), and (c) an OD that mediates tetramerization. The p73 and p63 proteins are unlike p53 in certain notable ways, however. First, p73 and p63 undergo alternative splicing, giving rise to a family of isoforms of unknown physiological significance (38Chen X. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 387-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 39Levrero M., De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Gong J. Wang J.Y. Melino G. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1661-1670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the C-terminal regions of the p73α and p63α isoforms harbor a sterile α motif (SAM) domain that is not found in p53 and may be involved in protein-protein interactions or developmental regulation (30Thanos C.D. Bowie J.U. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1708-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Differences in the SAM domains of the different family members may reflect significant divergence in signaling and function (40Ozaki T. Naka M. Takada N. Tada M. Sakiyama S. Nakagawara A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5902-5907PubMed Google Scholar, 41McGrath J.A. Duijf P.H. Doetsch V. Irvine A.D. de Waal R. Vanmolkot K.R. Wessagowit V. Kelly A. Atherton D.J. Griffiths W.A.

Third, distinct developmental abnormalities were observed in mice lacking either p73 or p63 (42Mills A.A. Zheng B. Wang X.-J. Vogel H. Roop D.R. Bradley A. Nature. 1999; 398: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar, 43Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C. Bonnet H. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D. Nature. 2000; 404: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar) and in humans with germ-line p63 mutations (44Celli J. Duijf P. Hamel B.C.J. Bamshad M. Kramer B. Smits A.P.T. Newbury-Ecob R. Hennekam R.C.M. Van Buggenhout G. van Haeringen A. Woods C.G. Van Essen A.J. de Waal R. Vriend G. Haber D.A. Yang A. McKeon F. Brunner H.G. van Bokhoven H. Cell. 1999; 99: 143-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Finally, p73 and p63 are rarely mutated in tumors and are thus unlikely to be classical tumor suppressors (45Strano S. Rossi M. Fontemaggi G. Munarriz E. Soddu S. Sacchi A. Blandino G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, although certain characteristics of p73 and p63 are similar to those of p53, they cause some different physiological responses to extracellular signals and developmental cues. Here, we report our investigation into the molecular bases for the differences in function among these three proteins of the p53 family. To study the biological role of p73, we first performed yeast two-hybrid screening of a human cDNA library with a p73 and found that p73 is functionally associated with the human homologue of mouse and hamster homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2). This protein has been identified previously as a nuclear serine/threonine kinase that interacts with the NK homeodomain transcription factor (46Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Lee S.J. Conti M.A. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25875-25879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), acts as a corepressor for the NK homeodomain, and cooperates with Groucho and HDAC-1 in enhancing transcriptional repression (47Choi C.Y. Kim Y.H. Kwon H.J. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33194-33197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SUMO-1 modification of HIPK2 correlates with its localization to nuclear speckles (dots) or nuclear bodies (48Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Kim Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12350-12355Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid screens have shown that HIPK2 also interacts with various other proteins including interferon type I-induced MxA (49Trost M. Kochs G. Haller O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7373-7377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), Fas/CD95 (50Wang Y. Hofmann T.G. Runkel L. Haaf T. Schaller H. Debatin K. Hug H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1518: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and HMGI(Y) (51Pierantoni G.M. Fedele M. Pentimalli F. Benvenuto G. Pero R. Viglietto G. Santoro M. Chiariotti L. Fusco A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6132-6141Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The biological significance of these interactions has not been determined. The human homologue of HIPK2 (hHIPK2) was recently cloned and mapped to chromosome 7q32-q34 (52Hofmann T.G. Mincheva A. Lichter P. Droge W. Schmitz M.L. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 1123-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). HIPK2 has very recently been reported to activate p53-mediated transcription through down-regulation of MDM2, which may result in enhanced p53 protein levels (53Wang Y. Debatin K.M. Hug H. BMC. 2001; 2: 8-16Google Scholar). The two-hybrid results of our two-hybrid described here provide strong evidence for a functional association between other p53 family proteins and HIPK2. We have examined the sites of interaction on these proteins, the biological significance of these interactions, and whether association with HIPK2 stabilizes p53 family proteins. Using the hamster HIPK2 homologue (haHIPK2), also known as PKM, for further characterization bothin vivo and in vitro, we have found evidence for a physical interaction between the OD of p53 family proteins and a region of haHIPK2 near a PEST sequence. These proteins colocalize in nuclear bodies, and the repressor functions of p73 and p53 are enhanced by HIPK2 in a dose-dependent manner. The corepressor activity of HIPK2 is abrogated in the presence of trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of HDAC-1. Finally, modulation of transcription of p53 family proteins by HIPK2 correlates with inhibition of colony formation, suppression of the cell cycle, and induction of apoptosis. All cells used in our experiments were routinely maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (all from Invitrogen). Stock solutions of G418 (neomycin) (Invitrogen), adriamycin (Sigma), and cisplatin (Amersham Biosciences) were 2 mg/ml in H2O. All cDNAs were made according to standard methods (54Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar) and verified by sequencing. The multicopy yeast expression plasmids used in the two-hybrid assays were pBTM116 (a Trp1-LexA DBD vector) and pASV3 (a Leu2-VP16 acidic transactivation domain vector). In these plasmids the target fusion genes are expressed under control of the ADH1 and phosphoglycerate kinase promoters, respectively (55Park J.S. Kim E.J. Kwon H.J. Hwang E.S. Namkoong S.E. Um S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6764-6769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Deletion and point mutants of the desired genes were created by PCR amplification and subcloned into the pBTM116 or pASV3. Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged p73α, p73β, and p53 expression plasmids were described previously (56Park J.S. Kim E.J. Lee J.Y. Sin H.S. Namkoong S.E. Um S.J. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 91: 822-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and modified by subcloning into yeast vectors for two-hybrid assays and pEGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) for colocalization assays, respectively. Expression plasmids for p53 point and deletion mutants were kindly provided by Drs. K. Roemer (Hamburg, Germany) and C. C. Harris (Bethesda, MD). HA-tagged p63α (or p51B) and p63γ (or p51A) expression plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Y. Ikawa (Tokyo, Japan) and modified by subcloning into yeast vectors for two-hybrid assays. haHIPK2 cDNA (a kind gift from Otto Haller, Freiburg, Germany) was PCR-amplified to construct HA-tagged haHIPK2 in pCDNA-HA, a derivative of vector pCDNA3 encoding HA tag, and GFP-tagged haHIPK2 in pEGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH) for colocalization assays. MDR1-CAT reporter plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. S. L. Doong (Taiwan, Taipei Republic of China). An expression plasmid for a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-haHIPK2 fusion protein was created by the subcloning of PCR-amplified haHIPK2 into vector pGEX2T (Amersham Biosciences). Details of plasmid constructions are available upon request. A human liver cDNA library (Matchmaker, CLONTECH) in the prey plasmid pGAD10 (CLONTECH) was screened for proteins that interact with p73 using yeast reporter strain L40 (MATa, his3Δ200, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, ade2, LYS:: (lexAop)4-HIS3, URA3::(lexAop)8-lacZ) (55Park J.S.

The transactivation domain of p73 was deleted so that amino acids 49–636 of p73 were encoded as a fusion with LexA on the bait plasmid pBTM116. The prey and bait plasmids were cotransformed into L40 using lithium-acetate. Transformed cells were spread directly on minimal medium lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan and supplemented with 5 mm 3-aminotriazole. Positive clones were isolated and then retested for β-galactosidase activity on permeabilized cells. Library plasmids from positive isolates were transformed into and recovered from Escherichia coli strain HB101 (leu2−) and were then analyzed by restriction digests. Unique inserts were sequenced and analyzed by comparison to the GenBankTM sequence data bank. The longest insert was systematically tested for interactions with a protein containing the LexA DBD fused to p73α-(49–636) or to other p53 family proteins by β-galactosidase assays (56Park J.S. Kim E.J. Lee J.Y. Sin H.S. Namkoong S.E. Um S.J. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 91: 822-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To precisely map the p73 interaction domain on the haHIPK2 insert, full-length and deletion derivatives of haHIPK2 were fused with a VP16 AD by subcloning into vector pASV3. The resulting VP16 AD-haHIPK2 fusion vectors were cotransformed with a pBTM116 derivative encoding the LexA DBD-p73α-(49–636) fusion protein. GST fusions of p53-(319–393) and haHIPK2-(812–907) were created by cloning the appropriate coding sequences into pGEX2T. Proteins were expressed inE. coli and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) by standard methods. Full-length haHIPK2, p53, p73α, p73β, p63α, and p63γ proteins were in vitrotranslated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI) supplemented with [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences).In vitro binding experiments were performed as described previously (56Park J.S. Kim E.J. Lee J.Y. Sin H.S. Namkoong S.E. Um S.J. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 91: 822-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). After transfection with plasmid DNA, U20S osteosarcoma cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and cell lysates were prepared by adding 1 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Lysates were precleared by pre-incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose beads and a 1:200 dilution of either a mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody (mAb) 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibody sc-8334 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The beads were washed five times in RIPA buffer and twice with PBS, and the immune complexes were released from the beads by boiling in sample buffer for 5 min. Following electrophoresis on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, immunoprecipitation products were analyzed by Western blotting using either rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody sc-8334 (1:200), mouse anti-p53 mAb NCL-p53P (Novocastra, Burlingame, CA) (1:100), or mouse anti-p73 mAb Ab-2 (Neomarkers, Fremont, CA) (1:100). Saos2 cells seeded on glass coverslips in 6-cm plates were transfected with pCDNA3 containing a gene for HA-p73α or HA-p53, pEGFP-N1 containing the gene for a GFP-haHIPK2 fusion protein, or both plasmids together. Two days later, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, and permeabilized for 4 min at 4 °C in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 10% goat serum. Subsequent incubations were performed at room temperature. After washing, cells were blocked for 60 min in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin and then incubated for 2 h with mouse anti-HA mAb 12CA5 diluted 1:200 in blocking buffer. Cells were then incubated with Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG N2031 (Amersham Biosciences) (1:50) for 1 h and mounted with 50 μl of VectaShield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Microscopy was performed on a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 MP confocal microscope. Saos2 cells were transiently transfected in 6-well plates using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total amount of transfected DNA including an SV40-driven β-galactosidase internal control plasmid, was maintained at 2 μg by including appropriate control plasmids lacking inserts as indicated. After overnight transfection, cells were washed, fed with complete medium, and incubated for an additional 24 h. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS, collected, resuspended in 100 μl of 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation (12,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C), and protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent. β-Galactosidase activity was determined in 96-well plates. Aliquots (30–70 μl) of the cleared lysates were assayed for CAT by a CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The CAT concentration of each sample was normalized with respect to β-galactosidase activity. An expression vector for haHIPK2 was constructed by subcloning PCR-amplified cDNA into the G418-resistant plasmid pCDNA3. U2OS cells were transfected with either this vector (pCDNA3-haHIPK2) or pCDNA3 in the presence of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) for 48 h and treated with 500 μg/ml G418. After 5–7 days, cells were incubated with fresh culture medium containing G418, and G418-resistant colonies were selected for 2 months. Cell growth was followed by direct cell counting with a hemocytometer. Cells were grown in 6-well culture plates at an initial density of 105 cells in 2 ml of medium per well. Results were expressed as mean values of cell numbers for at least four duplicate wells. For immunoblotting, transfected cells containing the indicated expression vectors were lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 8–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with primary mouse mAbs against HIPK2 (a gift from Dr. Lienhard Schmitz) at 1:100, against p53 (NCL-p53BP) at 1:100, against p21 (SC-817; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:200, or anti-β-actin (AC-15; Sigma) at 1:5000. Nitrocellulose blots were further incubated with peroxidase-conjugated mouse or rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). All antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 5% skim milk and 0.1% Tween 20. Protein bands were detected with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). U2OS stable cells were treated with 0.2 μg/ml adriamycin (or doxorubicin) or 25 mm cisplatin for 72 h, washed with 1× PBS, fixed with 70% ethanol for 20 min at room temperature, and washed again with 1× PBS. Cells were then treated with DAPI (1 μg/ml) (Sigma) for 12 min, washed with 1× PBS for 5 min, and treated with 50 μl of VectaShield (Vector Laboratories). DAPI staining of the cells was observed by fluorescence microscopy using a Provis AX70 microscope (Olympus Optical Co.). After adriamycin or cisplatin treatment, adherent and detached cells were combined and fixed overnight in 70% ethanol in wash buffer (PBS containing 5 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 1 min, cell pellets were incubated for 30 min with 500 μl of wash buffer and 50 μl of RNase A (10 mg/ml). Cells were then stained in 500 μl of PBS containing 100 μg/ml propidium iodide. A total of 1 × 106 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS-vantage; Becton Dickinson Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Saos2 or U2OS cells (5 × 105 cells/dish) were transfected with 2 μg of a pCDNA3 derivative carrying wild-type p53 or p73α and/or haHIPK2 using Effectene (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. G418-resistant colonies were selected by growth in 400 μg/ml G418 for 2 weeks. The G418-resistant colonies were then stained with Coomassie Blue and counted. The experiments were repeated at least three times. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify proteins that interact with p73α-(49–636), which lacks the transactivation domain of p73α (Fig. 1A). We isolated 285 His gene-positive clones from a screen of a human liver cDNA library fused to the GAL4 AD. When tested for activation of aGAL1-lacZ reporter gene, which contains eight LexA-binding sites in the promoter region, 73 of the clones exhibited high-level expression of lacZ. We isolated and amplified the plasmids from these clones and subjected them to agarose gel electrophoresis. The insert sequences from a total of 42 unique library plasmids were used in a GenBank search, and five of these clones were found to be human homologues of mouse HIPK2 (mHIPK2) (46Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y.

Plants are continually under attack by a variety of pathogens and have developed a wide array of defense mechanisms to protect themselves. Genetic analyses of plant-pathogen interactions have revealed that the resistance reactions, in many cases, are controlled by two dominant loci: an avirulence (avr) gene in the pathogen and a corresponding resistance (R) gene in the plants. Lack of either gene results in the development of disease symptoms. These genetic interactions are defined by the gene-for-gene theory (1Flor H.H. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1971; 9: 275-296Crossref Google Scholar). A number of plant R genes, which confer gene-for-gene type resistance, have been cloned and characterized from diverse plants.

The putative extracellular domain is composed of 23 LRRs, whereas the putative intracellular domain (XA21K) contains all the invariant amino acid residues characteristic of serine/threonine protein kinases. Based on the mode of action of animal receptor-tyrosine kinases (RTKs), we have hypothesized that the XA21 LRR domain acts as receptor for a plant or pathogen-produced ligand and that upon ligand binding, XA21K undergoes autophosphorylation by an intra- or intermolecular mechanism (16Ronald P.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 179-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that XA21K is an active serine/threonine kinase, that autophosphorylation of multiple residues occurs exclusively via an intramolecular mechanism, and that the XA21K region corresponding to the RD kinase activation domain is not phosphorylated. XA21K (amino acids 677–1025) (15Song W.-Y. Wang G. Chen L. Kim H., Pi, L. Gardner J. Wang B. Holsten T. Zhai W. Zhu L. Fauquet C. Ronald P.C. Science. 1995; 270: 661-667Crossref Scopus (1743) Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified with primer 1 (5′-GGATCCGCACAAGAGAACTAAAAAGGGAGC-3′) and primer 2 (5′-CAGAAGTCGATCTGAAGTGTGGCA-3′), cloned, sequenced to confirm that no PCR error was introduced, and subcloned into the pGTK vector, which was modified from pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) (17Braun D.M. Stone J.M. Walker J.C. Plant J. 1997; 12: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was designated as pGST-XA21K and used for protein expression. A single amino acid mutation in XA21K was introduced using the method of Deng and Nickoloff (18Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Two primers (primer 3, 5′-GGACTTGGTTGAATACTCACCAG-3′; primer 4, 5′-AAGCTTTAGTACCTCCACTGCAACA-3′) were designed to introduce mutations in the vector for mutant selection and also to substitute the lysine 736 (Lys-736) codon of XA21K. The lysine mutation creates a single substitution of glutamic acid for Lys-736. Candidates were confirmed by DNA sequencing and cloned into the pGTK vector. The resulting construct, designated pGST-XA21K-K736E, was used to express the kinase-deficient form of XA21K. To express XA21K as a maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion protein, plasmids pMBP-XA21K and pMBP-XA21K-K736E were created. Primer 5 (5′-GGATCCGTCGACCACAAGAGAACTAAAAAGGGAGC-3′) and primer 6 (5′-GGATCCGTCGACCCCGGGCAGAAGTCGATCTGAAGTGTGGCA-3′) were used to amplify XA21K and its kinase-deficient mutant using pGST-XA21K and pGST-XA21K-K736E as templates. The PCR products were cloned into the pMal-c2X expression vector (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and confirmed by sequencing. All other XA21K mutants used in this study were created according to the methods from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). pGST-XA21K was used as a template. Primer pairs S(−8)A-For (5′-GCAAGAAGAGCAGCTGTGGAATTCCCG-3′)/S(−8)A-Rev (5′-CGGGAATTCCACAGCTGCTCTTCTTGC-3′), S(−21)A-For (5′-GATCTGGTTCCGCGGGGAGCCGACTACAAAGAC-3′)/S(−21)A-Rev (5′-GTCTTTGTAGTCGGCTCCCCGCGGAACCAGATC-3′), R865H-For (5′-GATTTTGGGCTTGCACACATACTAGTTGATGGGACCTC-3′)/R865H-Rev (5′-GAGGTCCCATCAACTAGTATGTGTGCAAGCCCAAAATC-3′), and H903R-For (5′-GCTCATTGCATCAACGCGTGGAGATATTTACAGC-3′)/H903R-Rev (5′-GCTGTAAATATCTCCACGCGTTGATGCAATGAGC-3′) were used to generate the S(−8)A, S(−21)A, R865H, and H903R mutants, respectively. pMBP-XA21K and pMBP-XA21K-K736E were transformed into Escherichia coli strain ER2566 (New England Biolabs). Bacterial cells were grown in 50 ml of LB supplemented with glucose (2 g/liter) and ampicillin (50 μg/ml) to A600 of 0.5–0.6. To induce expression of the fusion proteins, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.4 μm and incubated for 8 h at room temperature. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended into column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), supplemented with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm) and dithiothreitol (1 mm), and lysed by sonication followed by gentle agitation at 4 °C for 10 min. The lysate was centrifuged (14,000 ×g) for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed with 60 μl of amylose resin (New England Biolabs) followed by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing with column buffer extensively, the fusion protein was eluted with column buffer containing 3.6 mg/ml maltose. A similar protocol was used to express and purify GST-XA21K and GST-XA21K-K736E except that a shorter time period (40 min) was used for isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction and that the GST buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) were used for purification. The resin-bound fusion proteins purified above were washed with kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Autophosphorylation experiments were carried out in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 20 μl of resin-bound protein (5 μg) and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Science, Boston, MA). The reaction was stopped after 30 min by adding 10 μl of Laemmli loading buffer (×4) and boiling for 5 min. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5 or 10%). After staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, the gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. To dephosphorylate the phosphorylated fusion proteins, the32P-labeled XA21K proteins were washed with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) buffer and incubated with PP1 (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The resulting proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE as described above. For the divalent cation dependence and time course assays, the indicated amount of MBP-XA21K was mixed with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a total volume of 20 μl of kinase buffer and divalent cation-containing buffer, respectively. For ATP dependence assays, 2 μg of fusion protein was incubated with 0.1–50 μm cold ATP containing 3.75 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a total volume of 30 μl of kinase buffer and stopped at 15 min by adding 10 μl of Laemmli loading buffer (×4). One-half of the reaction was separated by SDS-PAGE. The Coomassie Blue-stained protein bands were recovered and then measured using a scintillation counter. ATP incorporation was calculated based on the radioactivity counts and the concentration of cold ATP.Km and Vmax were estimated according to the double-reciprocal plot and linear regression using SigmaPlot 2000 V6 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The intramolecular phosphorylation assays were performed according to the method described by Sessa et al. (11Sessa G. D'Ascenzo M. Loh Y.-T. Martin G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15860-15865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Increased amounts of fusion proteins (from 0.7 to 44.8 μm) were used to incubate with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were stopped at 10 min by adding an equal volume of 75 mm H3PO4. One-half of the reaction was spotted on P-81 phosphocellulose paper. The incorporated32P was determined as described above. Van't Hoff analysis and linear regression was carried out using SigmaPlot 2000 V6 software (SPSS Inc.). The phosphoamino acid assay was carried out according to Horn and Walker (19Horn M.A. Walker J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1208: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The autophosphorylated GST-XA21K was excised from the gel and extracted with 50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 8.3), 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% 2-mercaptoethanol. The recovered protein was then precipitated with 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The 32P-labeled fusion protein was hydrolyzed in 50 μl of 6 n HCl (Pierce) for 1 h at 110 °C. HCl was removed by vacuum centrifugation and the pellet was dissolved in pH 1.9 buffer (2.2% formic acid, 7.8% acetic acid, and 100 μg/ml each phosphoamino acids standards (Ser(P), Thr(P), and Tyr(P)) (Sigma)). The sample was loaded onto a 20 × 20-cm thin-layer cellulose (TLC) plate (C.B.S. Scientific Co., Del Mar, CA) and subjected to electrophoresis (horizontally at pH 1.9, 1.5 kV for 30 min and vertically at pH 3.5, 1.3 kV for 25 min) using a Hunter thin layer electrophoresis system, model number HTLE7000 (C.B.S. Scientific Co.). After spraying with 0.25% ninhydrin in acetone to visualize the standard phosphoamino acids, the plate was subjected to autoradiography. For phosphopeptide mapping, the recovered 32P-labeled fusion protein was oxidized in 50 μl of cold performic acid for 60 min. The performic acid was removed with vacuum centrifugation and the pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 8.3), and digested overnight with l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Worthington) at 37 °C. After repeated drying and resuspension in water for three times, the sample was dissolved in pH 1.9 buffer and loaded onto a TLC plate. The tryptic phosphopeptides were resolved by electrophoresis in the first dimension (pH 1.9, 1.5 kV, 40 min) followed by ascending chromatography about 12 h in phosphopeptide buffer (75:50:15:60,n-butanol:pyridine:acetic acid:water). The plate was subjected to autoradiography to visualize the phosphopeptides. To test the hypothesis that Xa21 encodes a protein kinase, we expressed and purified XA21K as a MBP recombinant fusion protein and assayed for autophosphorylation. Fig. 1 shows that the fusion protein (MBP-XA21K) is capable of autophosphorylation. To confirm that the phosphorylated protein was MBP-XA21K rather than a contaminating bacterial protein, a mutated MBP-XA21K construct was generated using the site-directed mutagenesis approach. A single base substitution replaced Lys-736 with a glutamic acid residue. Because Lys-736 is essential for phosphotransfer and highly conserved in all protein kinases, the K736E mutation is expected to inactivate XA21K. Indeed, autophosphorylation analysis of the MBP-XA21K-K736E mutant revealed no autophosphorylation activity (Fig. 1). Similar results were observed when XA21K was expressed as GST fusion protein (data not shown). Because MBP and GST alone do not have any detectable kinase activity, these results indicate that Xa21 encodes an active kinase capable of autophosphorylation in vitro. The kinase activity of XA21K requires the presence of divalent cations. A linear increase in the enzymatic activity of XA21K was observed in the range of 0.1–5 mm MnCl2, followed by a plateau of the autophosphorylation when the concentration of MnCl2 was further increased (Fig. 2 A). Magnesium chloride maintains the linear increase of the autophosphorylation up to the highest concentration (20 mm) used in this assay (Fig. 2 B). The kinase activity of XA21K was, however, at least 15 times higher in the presence of MnCl2 than in MgCl2 (Fig. 2 C). No detectable kinase activity was observed when CaCl2 was used as a source of divalent cation. Time course experiments with 10 mm MnCl2 and MgCl2 indicated that the autophosphorylation of XA21K reached a plateau after 30–40 min (Fig. 2 D). MBP-XA21K exhibits standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to ATP. The Km and Vmax values for ATP, determined by a double-reciprocal plot, are 0.3 μm and 8.4 nmol/mg/min, respectively (Fig. 2 E). Based on the sequence of amino acids in kinase subdomains VI and VIII, Xa21 was presumed to encode a serine/threonine protein kinase (15Song W.-Y. Wang G. Chen L. Kim H., Pi, L. Gardner J. Wang B. Holsten T. Zhai W. Zhu L. Fauquet C. Ronald P.C. Science. 1995; 270: 661-667Crossref Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). To confirm the serine/threonine specificity of XA21K, phosphoamino acid assays were performed. In these assays, serine and threonine residues were phosphorylated, whereas no detectable tyrosine residues were labeled (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, the autophosphorylated XA21K can be dephosphorylated by the serine/threonine phosphatase PP1 (Fig. 3 B). These results indicated that XA21K carries serine/threonine specificity. To test whether the autophosphorylation of XA21K proceeds via an intramolecular (first-order with respect to enzyme concentration) or intermolecular (second-order with respect to enzyme concentration) mechanism, the autophosphorylation reaction was carried out in the presence of increasing concentrations of XA21K. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the relative phosphorylation rate increases linearly with the increasing enzyme concentration. This result indicated that autophosphorylation of MBP-XA21K follows first-order rather than second-order reaction kinetics. Moreover, the phosphate incorporation per molecule of MBP-XA21K was at the same level when the MBP-XA21K concentration in the reaction varied from 0.7 to 44.8 μm (64 times) (Fig. 4 B). The van't Hoff analysis of autophosphorylation (logarithm of phosphorylation rate versus logarithm of enzyme concentration) illustrated a slope of 1.03 ± 0.02 and a correlation coefficient of 0.997 for linear regression (Fig. 4 C). Our data suggested that the MBP-XA21K autophosphorylation occurs via an intramolecular mechanism. To confirm that intermolecular autophosphorylation does not occur, a kinase-deficient form of XA21K (MBP-XA21K-K736E) was used as a potential substrate for phosphorylation by GST-XA21K. Free MBP-XA21K-K736E was incubated with free GST-XA21K. Consistent with the results described above, GST-XA21K was unable to transphosphorylate MBP-XA21K-K736E (Fig. 4 D). Similar results were obtained by using GST-XA21K-K736E as a potential substrate for phosphorylation by MBP-XA21K (data not shown). These results, together with the observations from the intramolecular phosphorylation assays described above, support the notion that autophosphorylation of XA21 exclusively occurs through an intramolecular mechanism in vitro. To investigate the number of autophosphorylated serine and threonine residues, phosphopeptide mapping was carried out using both GST-XA21K and the XA21K protein without GST. XA21K was released from GST-XA21K by digestion with thrombin (Fig. 5). Because the thrombin-released XA21K contains a 22-amino acid peptide derived from the GTK vector, we designated the released XA21K as XA21Kt. Bands of predicted sizes of XA21Kt and GST were observed after thrombin digestion (Fig. 5 B). Autoradiography analysis showed that a protein with the predicted size of XA21Kt was strongly phosphorylated, indicating that this protein is XA21Kt (Fig. 5 B). No radiolabeled products at the position corresponding to GST were found. The weak bands observed on both the Coomassie Blue-stained gel and the autoradiogram in the GST-XA21K lanes may be the results of partial degradation of XA21Kt. Both GST-XA21K and XA21Kt were subjected to phosphopeptide mapping assays to determine the phosphopeptide pattern. The32P-labeled proteins were digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were loaded onto TLC plates and resolved horizontally by electrophoresis and vertically by ascending chromatography. Multiple labeled spots were observed on the autoradiograms generated from both GST-XA21K and XA21Kt (Fig. 6, A and B). Interestingly, three spots were absent in the tryptic pattern of XA21Kt when compared with that of GST-XA21K. Because the thrombin-released GST is not labeled as shown in Fig. 5 B, we hypothesized that the absence of three GST-XA21K-specific spots was because of the cleavage of a phosphorylated residue by thrombin. Indeed, the S(−21) residue on the 22-amino acid peptide of XA21Kt is part of the thrombin recognition site (Fig. 5 A). To test this hypothesis, we mutated S(−21) to alanine on GST-XA21K, and the mutant was subjected to phosphopeptide mapping. As shown in Fig. 6 C, the phosphopeptide pattern of GST-XA21K-S(−21)A is identical to that of XA21Kt. This result indicates that S(−21) is phosphorylated by the XA21 kinase and also confirms that the GST portion does not contain any phosphorylation sites. In addition to S(−21), there is another serine residue (S(−8)) located on the 22-amino acid peptide between GST and the XA21 kinase domain (Fig. 5 A). We mutated S(−8) to alanine to test whether this residue is also phosphorylated. Phosphopeptide mapping of the GST-XA21K-S(−8)A showed that S(−8) accounts for four phosphospots as shown in Fig. 6 D. Interestingly, S(−8) is located at the protein kinase A recognition sequence. Taken together, these results indicate that at least 20 of 27 phosphospots on the GST-XA21K peptide map are because of autophosphorylation of XA21K, thereby strongly suggesting that multiple residues on XA21K are autophosphorylated. There are seven serine and threonine residues located in the presumed activation domain of XA21K, and all of them are included in a single tryptic peptide (Fig. 7). To determine whether any of the residues can be autophosphorylated by XA21K, we mutated arginine 865 (Arg-865) to histidine, which abolishes a trypsin recognition site upstream of the seven serine and threonine residues. Because this mutation will significantly increase the size of the tryptic peptide carrying the seven serine and threonine residues, a shift of a labeled spot(s) on the two-dimensional autoradiogram should be observed if the peptide contained a phosphorylated residue(s). However, tryptic mapping of the GST-XA21K-R865H mutant showed no detectable changes on the autoradiogram when compared with that of GST-XA21K (data not shown). To confirm this result, we further mutated histidine 903 (His-903), downstream of the activation domain, to arginine to create a new trypsin recognition site. Consistent with the result from the GST-XA21K-R865H mutant, the GST-XA21K-H903R mutant showed an identical tryptic pattern to that of the wild type GST-XA21K (data not shown). These results suggest that the activation domain of XA21K is not autophosphorylated in vitro. It has long been hypothesized that protein phosphorylation plays a key role in R gene-mediated disease resistance (20Levine A. Tenhaken R. Dixon R. Lamb C. Cell. 1994; 79: 583-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2259) Google Scholar). In this paper, we demonstrate that the presumed intracellular domain encoded by the rice disease resistance gene Xa21 is an active serine/threonine kinase capable of autophosphorylation. Like other protein kinases, XA21K activity can be abolished by a single substitution of the invariant lysine residue that is responsible for phosphotransfer. The enzymatic properties of XA21K are also similar to those of other characterized kinases. For instance, the MBP-XA21K Km for ATP (0.3 μm) is comparable with the values obtained for the epidermal growth factor receptor (0.2–3 μm), the Catharanthus roseus CrRLK1 (2–2.5 μm), and the Arabidopsis RLK5 kinases (15.2–17.8 μm) (19Horn M.A. Walker J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1208: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21Schulze-Muth P. Irmler S. Schroder G. Schroder J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26684-26689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Similar to CrRLK1 and the Arabidopsis BRI1 kinases, the activity of XA21K requires Mn2+ and Mg2+ but not Ca2+ (21Schulze-Muth P. Irmler S. Schroder G. Schroder J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26684-26689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar,22Oh M.H. Ray W.K. Huber S.C. Asara J.M. Gage D.A. Clouse S.D. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 751-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These results suggest that autophosphorylation of XA21K may be an important step in the XA21-mediated signaling. Intermolecular autophosphorylation is particularly important for activation of some RTKs that recognize growth factors in animal systems. Upon ligand binding, these RTKs form homodimers triggering intermolecular phosphorylation of regulatory residues that are essential for activation of the kinases (23Heldin C. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). For example, the receptors for platelet-derived growth factor carrying intracellular tyrosine kinase domains are activated by dimerization of two receptors and subsequent intermolecular phosphorylation of the Tyr857residue of the kinases. Here we report that autophosphorylation of XA21K occurs through an intramolecular mechanism. Furthermore, we were unable to detect in vitro intermolecular phosphorylation of the XA21K-K736E mutant protein by XA21K using either resin-bound or free fusion proteins. Similar systems were successfully used to demonstrate that XA21K can transphosphorylate one of the XA21-binding proteins. 2L.-Y. Pi and W.-Y. Song, unpublished data. Thus, our data suggest that intermolecular autophosphorylation is not the mechanism by which XA21K is activated. A possible mechanism for activation of the XA21K is that a second receptor kinase forms a heterodimer with and transphosphorylates XA21K following the infections of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, which in turn activates the intramolecular autophosphorylation of XA21K. Over the last decade, more than 20 plant disease-resistance genes have been cloned from a variety of plant species. Only the rice Xa21 and tomato Pto resistance genes encode protein kinases. Although XA21K shares some common enzymatic properties with Pto, our studies also reveal that these two kinases likely employ distinct mechanisms for signaling. The phosphorylation status in the activation domain of XA21K differs from that of the Pto kinase. Four of eight identified phosphorylation sites on Pto are located on the activation domain (12Sessa G. D'Ascenzo M. Martin G.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2257-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). One of them, Ser-198, is critical for avrPto-Pto-mediated elicitation of hypersensitive response. Like the Pto kinase, there are seven serine and threonine residues in the activation domain of XA21K (Fig. 7). Three of them are located in the corresponding positions (including Ser-198) of the Pto phosphorylation sites. However, our data suggest that none of these residues are autophosphorylated, indicating that phosphorylation of the activation domain may not be required for the XA21-mediated signaling. This is consistent with the observations from many other non-RD kinases that lack the conserved arginine preceding the conserved aspartate. The RLK structure of XA21 suggests that the mode of action of this protein may be more similar to that of RTKs rather than Pto, a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (24Shiu S.-H. Bleecker A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10763-10768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). For instance, the extracellular domain of RTKs is required for ligand binding. Similarly, the presumed extracellular domain XA21 consists of LRRs that determines race-specific recognition of the pathogen (4Wang G.-L. Ruan D.L. Song W.-Y. Sideris S. Chen L., Pi, L.-Y. Zhang S. Zhang Z. Fauquet C. Gaut B.S. Whalen M.C. Ronald P.C. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 765-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Furthermore, autophosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues on the kinase domain of RTKs leads to initiation of multiple responses. A classic example is the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-mediated responses (23Heldin C. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). Upon platelet-derived growth factor binding to its receptor, nine different tyrosine residues on the receptor are autophosphorylated, resulting in the recruitment of eight distinct intracellular signaling molecules. Because we have shown that XA21K can autophosphorylate multiple serine and threonine residues, it is possible that XA21 can initiate multiple defense responses by the binding of distinct signaling proteins with specific phosphorylated residues on XA21K. In support of this hypothesis, we have found that the active XA21K is capable of binding to at least seven rice proteins in the yeast two-hybrid system; however, these binding proteins showed either no or impaired interactions with the kinase-deficient mutant XA21K-K736E.2 Thus, we propose that one function of the XA21K autophosphorylation is to create binding sites for recruiting downstream signaling proteins.

Previous studies suggested that this autophosphorylation occurs between subunits within each CaM kinase II holoenzyme. However, electron microscopy studies have questioned this mechanism because a large distance separates a kinase domain from its neighboring subunit. Moreover, the recently discovered ability of CaM kinase II holoenzymes to self-associate has raised questions about data interpretation in previous investigations of autophosphorylation. In this work, we characterize the mechanism of CaM kinase II autophosphorylation. To eliminate ambiguity arising from kinase aggregation, we used dynamic light scattering to establish the monodispersity of all enzyme solutions. We then found using chemical quenched flow kinetics that the autophosphorylation rate was independent of the CaM kinase II concentration, results corroborating intraholoenzyme activation. Experiments with a monomeric CaM kinase II showed that phosphorylation of this construct is intermolecular, supporting intersubunit phosphorylation within a holoenzyme. The autophosphorylation rate at 30 °C was ∼12 s−1, more than 10-fold faster than past estimates.

In the brain, CaM kinase II is essential for long term potentiation, a hypothesized cellular mechanism for learning and memory (4Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A.

Autophosphorylation plays a central role in the function of CaM kinase II. In the basal state, the enzyme is inactive because of the intramolecular binding of an autoinhibitory sequence to the kinase active site (Fig. 1A). As the intracellular Ca2+ concentration rises above 200 nm, Ca2+-bound calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) begins to bind CaM kinase II, displacing the autoinhibitory segment, and allowing the kinase to phosphorylate itself at Thr-286 (α-subunit; 287 for other subunits). This autophosphorylation has several important functional consequences: 1) it allows CaM kinase II to retain enzymatic activity in the absence of CaM (6Saitoh T. Schwartz J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar); 2) it causes a greater than 1,000-fold decrease in the dissociation rate of CaM from the enzyme, a phenomenon referred to as “CaM trapping” (7Meyer T.

Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). The biological significance of Thr-286 autophosphorylation has been established using a “knock-in” mouse mutant in which the endogenous CaM kinase II contains Ala instead of Thr at residue 286 (12Giese K.P. Fedorov N.B. Filipkowski R.K. Silva A.J. Science. 1998; 279: 870-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Although the mutation does not alter the level of kinase protein or the ability of the kinase to be activated by Ca2+/CaM, the mutant mouse does not display hippocampal long term potentiation and is deficient in spatial learning. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II Ca2+-bound calmodulin α-subunit of CaM kinase II monomeric CaM kinase II 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid A striking feature of CaM kinase II is that it assembles to form a ∼600-kDa holoenzyme consisting of 12 subunits, each containing a kinase domain. This molecular arrangement suggests three possible mechanisms by which autophosphorylation of Thr-286 might occur: 1) within the same polypeptide chain (intraholoenzyme, intrasubunit autophosphorylation), 2) by a different polypeptide chain within the same molecular assembly (intraholoenzyme, intersubunit autophosphorylation), and 3) by a kinase domain from a different assembly (interholoenzyme autophosphorylation). Previous studies have attempted to distinguish among these mechanisms. It has been found that the rate of autophosphorylation is not dependent on CaM kinase II concentration, a result that would be expected only if autophosphorylation were intraholoenzyme (13Kuret J. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6427-6433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lai Y. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Further experiments employing CaM kinase II holoenzymes that have been engineered to contain both kinase-active and kinase-inactive subunits suggest that autophosphorylation occurs in an intersubunit fashion within each holoenzyme (15Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 16Mukherji S. Soderling T.R. J. Biol.

Although biochemical studies of CaM kinase II have supported an intraholoenzyme, intersubunit autophosphorylation mechanism, structural evaluations of the enzyme do not readily suggest how this type of autophosphorylation might occur. Although no crystal structure of CaM kinase II has yet been obtained, several studies have probed the structure using transmission electron microscopy (18Woodgett J.R. Davison M.T. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 136: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 19Kanaseki T. Ikeuchi Y. Sugiura H. Yamauchi T. J.

A recent three-dimensional view of CaM kinase II has provided considerable detail regarding the architecture of the enzyme (Fig. 1, B and C) (20Kolodziej S.J. Hudmon A. Waxham M.N. Stoops J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14354-14359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Here it was demonstrated that the association domains of CaM kinase II form a gear-shaped core for the holoenzyme, and the kinase domains emanate as foot-like processes outward from the center forming two hexameric ring structures. Importantly, a large distance (∼50 Å) separates neighboring kinase domains. Because intraholoenzyme, intersubunit autophosphorylation would require that neighboring kinase domains be in close proximity and this is not seen in the structure, the recent electron microscopy analysis does not favor an intraholoenzyme, intersubunit mechanism. How might the seemingly contradictory structural and biochemical data be reconciled? One hypothesis derives from the propensity of CaM kinase II to form supramolecular assemblies of many holoenzymes. This property of CaM kinase II has been characterized recently in vitro(22Hudmon A. Aronowski J. Kolb S.J. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8800-8808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 23Hudmon A. Kim S.A. Kolb S.J. Stoops J.K. Waxham M.N. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1364-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and has also been shown to occur within neurons (24Dosemeci A. Reese T.S. Petersen J. Tao-Cheng J.H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3076-3084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Tao-Cheng J. Vinade L. Smith C. Winters C.A. Ward R. Brightman M.W. Reese T.S. Dosemeci A. Neuroscience. 2001; 106: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). If CaM kinase II was in a supramolecular form in previous biochemical evaluations of the autophosphorylation mechanism, the results obtained in these studies may be ambiguous: it is possible that the autophosphorylation was occurring between different holoenzymes but appeared to be intraholoenzyme because of the supramolecular, or aggregated, state of the kinase. In this work we investigated the autophosphorylation mechanism of CaM kinase II in light of the recent three-dimensional electron microscopy structure. To eliminate experimental ambiguity arising from the state of aggregation of the kinase, dynamic light scattering was used to establish that CaM kinase II is monodisperse during autophosphorylation. The autophosphorylation process was then characterized using chemical quenched flow kinetics, the first application of this approach to study CaM kinase II. It was determined that the rate of autophosphorylation of a monodisperse CaM kinase II holoenzyme solution was independent of CaM kinase II concentration, supporting an intraholoenzyme autophosphorylation mechanism. Further studies with a monomeric version of CaM kinase II (mCaMKII) demonstrated that this molecule phosphorylates through an intermolecular process, suggesting that autophosphorylation within the holoenzyme is intersubunit. The rate constant for autophosphorylation at near physiological temperatures was ∼12 s−1, more than 10-fold faster than previous estimates of the CaM kinase II autophosphorylation rate. The rat α-CaM kinase II cDNA in the vector pBakPak9 (CLONTECH) and virus containing the cDNA were gifts from Dr. Neal Waxham (8Putkey J.A. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29619-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The α-CaM kinase II gene was subcloned previously into the vector pFasBak for expression in the baculovirus Sf21 cell expression system (Invitrogen) (10Singla S.I. Hudmon A. Goldberg J.M. Smith J.L. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29353-29360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Virus containing the α-CaM kinase II cDNA was first produced in monolayer Sf21 cultures as described by the manufacturer. For protein expression, virus was added to a 500-ml Sf21 suspension culture for 60–72 h; cells were then harvested and either stored at –80 °C or used immediately for protein purification (10Singla S.I. Hudmon A. Goldberg J.M. Smith J.L. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29353-29360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). α-CaM kinase II was purified as described by Singla et al. (10Singla S.I. Hudmon A. Goldberg J.M. Smith J.L. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29353-29360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Briefly, cell pellets were resuspended, lysed by Dounce homogenization and sonication, and clarified by centrifugation. The supernatant was loaded onto a 10-ml phosphocellulose column (P-11 cation exchange resin, Whatman) and eluted in a 120-ml gradient from 0.1 to 0.5 m NaCl. The appropriate fractions were pooled. For one light scattering experiment, the material was purified further using a CaM-Sepharose column as described (10Singla S.I. Hudmon A. Goldberg J.M. Smith J.L. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29353-29360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In all other experiments, the material was then applied at 0.8 ml/min to a Sephacryl S-300 Sepharose gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated in previously 20 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 200 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Pure fractions were pooled and stored on ice until further use. If necessary, the enzyme was concentrated at 4 °C in a Centriprep centrifugal filter device (Amicon) with a YM-50 membrane. Both monomeric α-CaM kinase II and α-CaM kinase II (T286A) were purified in the same manner as wild type. CaM was purified as described (10Singla S.I. Hudmon A. Goldberg J.M. Smith J.L. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29353-29360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The concentration of α-CaM kinase II was evaluated using an extinction coefficient of 66,350 m−1cm−1 obtained from the protein sequence (26Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar, 27Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). All reported concentration units for CaM kinase II represent the concentration of single CaM kinase II polypeptide chains, not the concentration of holoenzymes. An extinction coefficient of 44,890m−1 cm−1 was used for the mCaMKII construct, which is formed from residues 1–326 of CaM kinase II. Dynamic light scattering experiments were performed with a DynaPro 801 instrument (Protein Solutions, Ltd.). Protein samples were either centrifuged at 10,000 × g or sterile filtered to remove dust particles before analysis. The samples were then illuminated at 780 nm using a solid state laser. Each sample was evaluated at least 20 times, with the quoted values being the mean of these independent evaluations. Dynamic light scattering experiments provide a direct determination of the diffusion coefficient (D) of the particles in solution (www.protein-solutions.com). Using the diffusion coefficient, the hydrodynamic radius (RH) of the particles can be calculated from the Stokes-Einstein equationD=kT/6πηRHEquation 1 where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and η is the solvent viscosity. Approximate molecular weights for each of the species were determined from RH by the analysis software using a reference standard curve. For experiments in which CaM kinase II holoenzymes were autophosphorylated before analysis, the autophosphorylation reaction time was 1 min. Chemical quenched flow experiments were performed with a model RQF-3 chemical quenched flow device from Kintek Corporation (Austin, TX). The instrument was maintained at the experimental temperature using either a circulating, temperature-controlled bath or an ice water bath. Before the quenched flow analysis, all solutions were maintained on ice. To initiate a quenched flow experiment, Ca2+/CaM was first added to CaM kinase II (in gel filtration buffer: 20 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 200 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). The solution was immediately added to sample loop A. Then, a buffered Mg2+/ATP solution was added to loop B. In our experimental setup, 11.5 μl of sample from loop A was mixed rapidly with 11.5 μl from loop B, and the solution was then quenched with 67 μl of the quench solution (20 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 200 mm KCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 50 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA). The solution conditions during the autophosphorylation reaction were (except where noted) 20 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 200 mm KCl, 500 μm Ca2+, 10 μm CaM, 500 μm ATP, and 2 mm Mg2+. Experiments at 0.58, 0.14, and 0.035 μm mCaMKII were slow enough to be evaluated with bench top experiments. Here, 11.5 μl of both the Ca2+/CaM/CaM kinase II mixture and the Mg2+/ATP solution were pipetted together to initiate autophosphorylation. After varying times, the reaction was quenched with 67 μl of quench buffer and evaluated for autonomous activity as described below. After quenching of the autophosphorylation reaction, the level of autonomous activity of the enzyme solution was evaluated immediately. Here, 10 μl of the quenched solution was added to 40 μl of the autonomous kinase assay mixture. For all experiments, the Ca2+/CaM activity of the quenched solution was also evaluated. The solution conditions of the assay mixtures were 50 mm PIPES pH 7.0, 20 mmMg2+, 200 μm ATP, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 50 μm autocamtide-2 kinase substrate, and 1 μCi of [32P]ATP; in addition, the autonomous assays contained 1 mm EGTA, whereas the Ca2+/CaM assays contained 500 μm Ca2+ and 2 μm CaM. For both autonomous and Ca2+/CaM assays, experiments were performed in duplicate. When high concentrations of CaM kinase were used, solutions were first diluted in quench buffer before addition to kinase assays so that the final enzyme concentration was ∼10 nm. Enzyme activity was evaluated for 1 min at 30 °C. 20-μl aliquots of kinase assay were then spotted on P-81 phosphocellulose paper, placed in 0.5% phosphoric acid, washed in water, dried, and evaluated with scintillation counting. The specific Ca2+/CaM activity of the holoenzyme was typically 5–20 μmol/min/mg, whereas that of the mCaMKII was 4–15 μmol/min/mg. For the experiments in which Thr-286 autophosphorylation was monitored by32P incorporation, the initial experimental setup was identical to the chemical quenched flow experiments described above except that the 11.5 μl of Mg2+/ATP solution also contained 0.5 μCi of [32P]ATP. After quenching, 20 μl of the solution was added to 10 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and run on 10% SDS-PAGE. Protein bands corresponding to CaM kinase II were excised and evaluated using scintillation counting. Data analysis was performed with the program Scientist (Micromath, Salt Lake City, UT). For experiments with the holoenzyme, the ratio of autonomous to Ca2+/CaM activity was determined at each data point. This ratio multiplied by 100 was then fit to the following increasing exponential function to determine the first order rate constant for autophosphorylation. A=M(1−e−k1t)Equation 2 Here A is the percent autonomy, M is the maximal autonomy, k1 is the first order rate constant for intraholoenzyme autophosphorylation, and t is time. Unlike intraholoenzyme autophosphorylation, intermolecular autophosphorylation requires that the kinetic data be fit with the dependent variable in units of concentration rather than percent autonomy. Hence, for experiments with mCaMKII, the percent autonomy was first determined at each data point. Then this value was multiplied by the concentration of monomer in the experiment to determine the concentration of phosphorylated monomer (P) at each data point. The values of P were then fit to the following expression to determine the second order rate constant (k2) for intermolecular autophosphorylation.P=C2k2t/(Ck2t+1)Equation 3 Here, C is the total concentration of CaM kinase II monomer in the experiment. To evaluate the temperature dependence of CaM kinase II autophosphorylation, the data were analyzed in terms of the Arrhenius equationk1=Be−Ea/RTEquation 4 where Ea is the activation energy of the process, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and B is a constant. To monitor the decay of enzymatic activity with temperature after autophosphorylation, 9.2 μl of 0.5 μm CaM kinase II was mixed with a 2.3-μl mixture of 2.5 mm Ca2+ and 10 μm CaM and incubated at the various temperatures. A 11.5-μl solution of 4 mm Mg2+ and 1 mm ATP was added, and autophosphorylation was allowed to occur for 15 s, 1 min, or 3 min. The quench solution was then added, and the Ca2+/CaM activity was assessed. Dynamic, or quasi-elastic, light scattering was used to evaluate the state of aggregation α-CaM kinase II holoenzymes and α-CaM kinase II mutants (29Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Burley S.K. Structure. 1994; 2: 357-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 30Schonfeld H.J. Poschl B. Muller F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This technique monitors the fluctuation in scattering intensity of particles in solution illuminated using a monochromatic light source (www.protein-solutions.com). Through an autocorrelation analysis of the scattering intensity fluctuations, one can determine whether the particles in solution are all of uniform size (monodisperse) or varying sizes (polydisperse). This is evaluated using the base-line parameter (See Table I) (www.protein-solutions.com). In addition, dynamic light scattering also allows a determination of the particle hydrodynamic radius, and this provides an approximate molecular weight of the scattering particles. In the following analysis, solutions were concluded to be free of aggregation only if they contained an approximate molecular weight appropriate for the particle under investigation and also a base-line parameter within (or very close to) the monodisperse range.Table IDynamic light scattering dataKinase formTemperatureRHApproximate molecular mass1-aThe approximate molecular mass is determined experimentally from the RH value; the expected molecular mass is calculated from the actual molecular masses of CaMKII (649 kDa), CaM (16.8 kDa), and mCaMKII (36.8 kDa).ExpectedBase line°CnmkDakDaCaMKII09.12 ± 0.2590 ± 356491.000CaMKII, CaM-bound010.5 ± 0.2825 ± 488511.001CaMKII, CaM-bound, +Mg2+/ATP012.1 ± 0.31,150 ± 528511.001CaMKII, CaM-bound, +Mg2+/ATP2312.0 ± 0.41,127 ± 728511.001CaMKII, CaM-bound, +Mg2+/ATP3012.8 ± 0.41,438 ± 698511.002CaMKII (T286A)09.42 ± 0.2645 ± 356491.000mCaMKII03.26 ± 0.253.1 ± 1036.81.002mCaMKII, CaM-bound03.38 ± 0.258.2 ± 1153.61.000mCaMKII, CaM-bound, +Mg2+/ATP03.75 ± 0.274.3 ± 1353.61.001CaMKII, CaM-Sepharose purified1-bFor this experiment, material was purified using a CaM-Sepharose rather than a gel filtration column.016.7 ± 2.62,621 ± 3706491.009CaMKII, CaM-bound, +Mg2+/ADP0316 ± 292,390,000 ± 250,0008511.001CaMKII, CaM-bound, +Mg2+/ATP1-cThe solution for this experiment was 50 mm PIPES pH 7.0.

Open table in a new tab The dynamic light scattering device provided the hydrodynamic radius (RH ± S.D.), approximate molecular mass (molecular mass ± S.D.), and base-line parameter for solutions of CaM kinase II holoenzyme (CaMKII) and monomer (mCaMKII).

If the value is in the range 1.002–1.005, the solution is primarily monomodal but contains a few large particles. Table I summarizes the dynamic light scattering data for wild type and mutant forms of α-CaM kinase II. α-CaM kinase II purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” was monodisperse. If 500 μm Ca2+ and equimolar CaM were added to α-CaM kinase II, the material remained monodisperse but now gave a slightly higher approximate molecular weight, consistent with the molecular weight of the α-CaM kinase II holoenzyme plus 12 CaM molecules. If, in addition to Ca2+/CaM, a solution of 2 mm Mg2+ and 500 μm ATP was added to facilitate autophosphorylation, the solution also remained monodisperse as evidenced by the base-line parameter. The concentration of CaM kinase II in these experiments was typically 3–5 μm; however, experiments at 10 μm CaM kinase II gave nearly identical results. Solutions of a CaM kinase II (T286A) mutant and mCaMKII were also established to be monodisperse. Several conditions produced solutions that did not contain monodisperse holoenzymes. If CaM kinase II was purified using a CaM-Sepharose column (rather than the standard purification with a gel filtration column), a monodisperse preparation was not obtained. Furthermore, if ADP replaced ATP in the autophosphorylation reaction, particles with a substantially larger radius of hydration than found in single holoenzymes were formed. Finally, it was observed that whether or not α-CaM kinase II remained monodisperse during autophosphorylation was dependent on experimental solution conditions. If experiments were performed at pH 7.0 and no added salt, rather than at the standard conditions of pH 7.4 and 200 mm KCl, α-CaM kinase II aggregated during autophosphorylation (Table I). These findings are consistent with previous results demonstrating that aggregation of α-CaM kinase II during autophosphorylation is influenced by both pH and ionic strength (23Hudmon A. Kim S.A. Kolb S.J. Stoops J.K. Waxham M.N. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1364-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The dynamic light scattering experiments described above established experimental conditions under which CaM kinase II does not aggregate during autophosphorylation. The kinetics of CaM kinase II autophosphorylation were then explored under the same conditions. Two different methods of monitoring Thr-286 autophosphorylation were utilized. The first was the autonomous activity of CaM kinase II (the activity in the absence of Ca2+/CaM), which has previously been determined to reflect the level of Thr-286 autophosphorylation (31Ikeda A. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11582-11588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second was the level of 32P incorporation into the enzyme after autophosphorylation with [32P]ATP (32Lou L.L. Schulman H. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 2020-2032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 compares the time courses of autonomous activity generation and 32P incorporation for chemical quenched flow experiments performed under identical solution conditions (0 °C, 2.5 μm ATP). It was observed that the time courses of autonomy generation and 32P incorporation were nearly identical, suggesting that both methods are reflecting accurately the level of Thr-286 autophosphorylation under these conditions. Fitting the data to an exponential function to obtain the autophosphorylation rate constant for each experiment gave values of 0.064 and 0.056 s−1 for the autonomy and32P incorporation experiments, respectively. The autonomous activity saturated at a level that was ∼70% of the activity in the presence of Ca2+/CaM, a maximal autonomous activity similar to that observed in previous studies (11DeKoninck P. Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). The maximal 32P incorporation approached 1 mol of phosphate/1 mol of subunit. Control autophosphorylation experiments that employed a CaM kinase II mutant (CaM kinase II (T286A)) had <1% of both the maxim"

Controls show a low level of S-thiolation, which is increased 3.6-fold during post-ischemic reperfusion. S-Thiolated proteins were purified using streptavidin-agarose, and Western immunoblotting showed HSP27 was present. We increased protein S-thiolation 10-fold with 10 μm H2O2 with or without a kinase inhibitor mixture (staurosporine, genistein, bisindolylmaleimide, SB203580, and PD98059). H2O2 alone induced the phosphorylation of HSP27 Ser-86 and Ser-45/Ser-59 of its homologue αB crystallin. However, kinase inhibition reduced phosphorylation of these sites below basal. Despite effective kinase inhibition, H2O2 still disaggregated HSP27, but not αB crystallin. This is consistent with the lack of an S-thiolation site on αB crystallin.

S-Thiolation is an oxidative, reversible post-translational modification of cysteine residues of proteins and can be viewed as a protective mechanism that guards against the terminal or irreversible oxidation of these residues. Protein thiol oxidation involving S-thiolation has all of the essential elements of a regulatory system, including sensitivity, specificity, and reversibility. Thus, S-thiolation may regulate protein function in the same way as other post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. Protein S-thiolation can be directly coupled to cellular redox status and has no absolute requirement for specialized regulatory enzymes, although thiol transferase enzymes can catalyze these reactions (4Grant C.M.

Regulatory cysteine residues are often localized to regions of proteins with a high pKa, as the alkaline pH in these areas promotes the formation of the highly reactive thiolate ion. These particularly reactive, and often catalytically essential, cysteine residues are highly sensitive to a number of cellular oxidants, including glutathione disulfide, cysteine, nitric oxide, nitrosothiols, peroxynitrite, hypochlorous acid, molecular oxygen, and reactive lipids (20Mohr S.

The exact reactants involved in the formation ofS-thiolated proteins is unclear and may be dependent on a number of specific criteria, including the tissue type, the nature of the oxidative stress and its duration. Potential mechanisms of proteinS-thiolation include disulfide exchange with low molecular weight mixed disulfides, such as GSSG or cystine. Stress leading to nitric oxide generation can also promote proteinS-thiolation, as nitrosothiols can be formed, which have the dual ability to S-thiolate and S-nitrosylate proteins. Hydrogen peroxide can promote S-thiolation of proteins through activation of thiol groups, involving the formation of sulfenic acid intermediates. Other potential mechanisms of proteinS-thiolation involve metal ion catalysis or interaction of protein and small molecule thiyl radicals. We have used methods that allowed the identification of proteins, which are susceptible to S-thiolation (29Eaton P. Byers H.L. Leeds N. Ward M.A. Shattock M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9806-9811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and found that the small stress protein HSP27 is a target for this form of oxidative modification. Under basal conditions, HSP27 exists as a high molecular weight aggregate that is broken down following phosphorylation by stress-activated kinase pathways such as p38MK, which activates MAPKAPK2, which directly phosphorylates HSP27 (30Stokoe D. Engel K. Cambell D.G. Cohen P. Gaestel M.S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Other classes of kinase, such as cGMP-dependent protein kinase or casein kinase, are also able to phosphorylate HSP27 (31Butt E. Immler D. Meyer H.E. Kotlyarov A. Laass K. Gaestel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7108-7113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation-induced breakdown of the macromolecular structure correlates with the loss of molecular chaperone activity (32Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X. Kotlyarov A. Lutsch G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 9378-9385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). αB crystallin shares considerable homology with HSP27, and its multimeric aggregate size is also regulated by phosphorylation (34Kato K. Ito H. Kamei K. Inaguma Y. Iwamoto I. Saga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28346-28354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 35Ito H. Okamoto K. Nakayama H. Isobe T. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29934-29941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, rat αB crystallin differs notably from HSP27 in that it does not contain a single cysteine residue. Consequently, we have used the non-thiolatable αB crystallin protein to assess any differential behavior between the two homologues during oxidative stress. In this study we demonstrate that myocardial oxidant stress induces HSP27S-thiolation and that this process results in the breakdown of the macromolecular complex independently of phosphorylation. These were obtained from Sigma or BDH unless stated and were of AnalaR grade or above. 120 mg of the water-soluble biotinylation reagent sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate was added to 29 mg of cysteine in 2 ml of 10× phosphate-buffered saline and left to derivatize for 1 h at room temperature. The biotin-cysteine was then purified using a Shimadzu HPLC system with an automated fraction collector on an APEX, 5-μm ODS column (Jones Chromatography, Hengoed, UK) with detection at λmax (190–400 nm) using a diode array detector. The biotin-cysteine was added to the bicarbonate perfusion buffers when required and the concentration confirmed spectrophotometrically using the Ellman reagent (Pierce and Warriner) with cysteine as a standard. Male Wistar rats (200–250 g) were used throughout this study and were obtained from BK Universal. The animals were maintained humanely in compliance with the “Principles of Laboratory Animal Care” formulated by the “National Society for Medical Research” and “Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” prepared by the National Academy of Sciences and published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH publication no. 85–23, revised 1985). Animals were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone (40 mg intraperitoneal) and injected with sodium heparin (200 IU) via the femoral vein. Hearts were rapidly excised, placed in cold (4 °C) bicarbonate buffer, and cannulated. The hearts were then perfused with bicarbonate buffer gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Perfusion was in the non-recirculating Langendorff mode at a constant flow of 12 ml/g of tissue/min. The bicarbonate buffer contained (in mm) NaCl, 118.5; KCl, 3.1; KH2PO4, 1.18; NaHCO3, 25.0; MgCl2, 1.2; CaCl2, 1.4; and glucose, 10.0. The perfusion protocols used in this study are summarized in Fig. 1. When biotin-cysteine or the antioxidant mercaptopropionylglycine (MPG)1 were used, they were both made up in bicarbonate buffer, immediately before use, to a concentration of 0.5 and 5 mm, respectively. The utility of biotin-cysteine in the investigation of protein S-thiolation has been established, and we have previously shown that it crosses the plasma membrane, gaining access to cytoplasmic and cytoskeletal proteins (29Eaton P. Byers H.L. Leeds N. Ward M.A. Shattock M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9806-9811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). A kinase inhibitor mixture was used in some protocols and comprised staurosporine (100 nm), genistein (50 μm), bisindolylmaleimide (10 μm), SB203580 (10 μm), and PD98059 (10 μm). Hydrogen peroxide was used a concentration of 10 μm. Ventricular tissue was homogenized (10 ml of buffer/g of cardiac tissue) on ice in 100 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, benzamidine (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (100 ng/ml), aprotinin (100 ng/ml), pH 7.0, using a polytron tissue grinder. A sample of the homogenate was reconstituted in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) buffer without a reducing agent. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was carried out using the Bio-Rad mini protean II system. In some samples, to confirm thatS-thiolated/biotinylated proteins were modified via disulfide formation, 20 mm DTT was added to the SDS buffer. After electrophoresis samples were transferred to PVDF using a Pharmacia system semi-dry blotter. S-Thiolated proteins were identified by virtue of their biotin tag using streptavidin-HRP (Amersham Biosciences) and the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences, Amersham, UK). PVDF membranes were stained with Coomassie Blue to confirm blotting integrity. Western blots were digitized using a flat-bed scanner (HP Scanjet 11C). The digitized image was then quantitatively analyzed for total proteinsS-thiolation in each lane using the NIH-Image software (Freeware, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD). The HSP27 and the αB crystallin antibodies were supplied by Stressgen Biotechnologies Ltd. (distributed by Bioquote Ltd., York, UK). The HSP27 phosphospecific mouse rabbit polyclonal antibody to rat HSP27 Ser-86 (equivalent to Ser-82 of human sequence) was purchased from New England Biolabs (Hitchin, UK). The αB crystallin phosphospecific rabbit polyclonal antibodies (to phosho-Ser-45 and phospho-Ser-59) were kindly supplied by Dr. Kanefusa Kato (34Kato K. Ito H. Kamei K. Inaguma Y. Iwamoto I. Saga S.

S-Thiolated proteins were affinity-purified using streptavidin-agarose. Hearts were homogenized (10 ml of buffer/g of cardiac tissue) on ice in 100 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, benzamidine (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (100 ng/ml), aprotinin (100 ng/ml), pH 7.0, using a polytron tissue grinder. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (cytosol) was removed and rotated at 4 °C overnight with streptavidin-agarose. The agarose pellet was then extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline and 1% Triton X-100.S-Thiolated proteins were released from the streptavidin-agarose by treatment with 20 mm DTT in phosphate-buffered saline. Affinity-purified proteins were reconstituted in SDS sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. After transfer to PVDF membrane, we tested for the presence of HSP27 using an antibody provided by Stressgen Biotechnologies Ltd. (distributed by Bioquote Ltd.). A cardiac homogenate was prepared from isolated rat heart preparations and subjected to 20-min aerobic perfusion, as described above. The homogenate was supplemented with a kinase inhibitor mixture containing: staurosporine (100 nm), genistein (50 μm), bisindolylmaleimide (10 μm), SB203580 (10 μm), and PD98059 (10 μm). Soluble protein was collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 20,000 ×g at 4 °C. The soluble protein was then incubated at 37 °C for 5 min with or without 1 mm GSSG, after which it was subjected to gel filtration chromatography. A Bio-Rad liquid chromatograph with automated fraction collection and detection at 280 nm was used. Cytosolic protein (prepared as described above) was injected on to a Sephracyl gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) conditioned with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, pumped at a flow rate of 1 ml/min via a Shimadzu chromatograph utilizing diode array detection. Fractions were collected by the automated collector, and using immunoblotting, each sample was assayed for the presence of HSP27 or αB crystallin. A calibration line was constructed using thyroglobulin (669KDa), catalase (232 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa) as described in the Amersham Biosciences technical notes. Results are presented as mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were assessed using analysis of variance followed by a Bonferroni t test. Differences were considered significant at the 95% confidence level. Fig. 2A shows a Western blot probed with streptavidin-HRP, which allows the detection of proteins that are S-thiolated by biotin-cysteine during oxidative stress. Oxidative stress, during post-ischemic reperfusion or hydrogen peroxide treatment, efficiently induced proteinS-thiolation in the intact isolated rat heart. Ischemia and reperfusion or hydrogen peroxide treatment both significantly (p < 0.05) increased protein S-thiolation by 3.6- and 10-fold, respectively. Treatment of the samples containingS-thiolated proteins induced by reperfusion or hydrogen peroxide with DTT abolished detection of this oxidative modification. This demonstrates the signals are detected as a consequence of a disulfide bond linking the biotin-cysteine to a protein. Fig.2B shows a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel of affinity-purified cytosolic S-thiolated proteins from a heart subjected to ischemia and reperfusion. Approximately 20 dominantS-thiolation substrates have been detected in the cytosol of rat heart, with many more minor substrates present. Presumably, there are other S-thiolation substrates present that are below the detection sensitivity of Coomassie Blue dye. Fig. 2C shows a Western immunoblot of purified S-thiolated proteins probed with an anti-HSP27 antibody and demonstrates that HSP27 wasS-thiolated during cardiac reperfusion. Supplementation of hearts with MPG prior to the onset of ischemia decreased the amount of HSP27 that could be purified using streptavidin-agarose to control levels. Fig. 3 shows Western immunoblots (using phosphospecific antibodies) and their quantitation. There is a low basal level of HSP27 Ser-86 and αB crystallin Ser-45/Ser-59 phosphorylation under control aerobic conditions. Hydrogen peroxide treatment significantly increased the phosphorylation state of each of these residues. The effect of the kinase inhibitor mixture when administered during aerobic perfusion or during hydrogen peroxide treatment was to reduce phosphorylation at all three residues below that detected basally. Thus, the kinase inhibitor mixture efficiently blocked the hydrogen peroxide-induced phosphorylation below that present in aerobically perfused control hearts. Fig. 4A shows Western immunoblots (probed with an anti-HSP27 or anti-αB crystallin) of fractions collected when rat heart homogenate was separated by molecular weight using gel filtration liquid chromatography. Clearly treatment of the cytosolic fraction with 1 mm GSSG in vitro caused the bulk of the HSP27 to elute from the column in a later fraction, indicating breakdown of the HSP27 multimeric complex. In contrast, GSSG treatment had no effect on the complex size of αB crystallin. In these experiments a kinase inhibitor mixture was in the homogenates, and therefore no changes in the phosphorylation state of protein would have occurred in control or GSSG-treated samples. Fig. 4B shows Western immunoblots (probed with an anti-HSP27 or anti-αB crystallin) of fractions collected when rat heart homogenates (all of which were perfused with kinase inhibitors) were separated by gel filtration liquid chromatography. Hydrogen peroxide efficiently disaggregated HSP27 despite the presence of kinase inhibitors. In contrast, the kinase inhibitor mixture blocked the hydrogen peroxide-induced breakdown of αB crystallin. Hydrogen peroxide-induced breakdown was not due to phosphorylation, as kinase inhibition efficiently blocked hydrogen peroxide-induced small stress protein phosphorylation (see Fig. 3). Fig. 5 quantifies the GSSG-induced redistribution of HSP27 to a lower molecular aggregate shown by Western immunoblotting in Fig. 4A. It is evident that there was no equivalent breakdown of the αB crystallin complex. Quantitation was achieved by designating the total immunoblot signal from all fractions as 100% and then determining what proportion was in each fraction. This quantitative approach confirmed the qualitative assessment of the Western immunoblotting. Fig. 6A is a quantitative analysis of Western immunoblots assessing the breakdown of HSP27 in isolated hearts during aerobic or hydrogen peroxide treatment, in the presence or absence of kinase inhibitors. Quantitation involved designating the total immunoblot signal from all fractions as 100%, after which the relative proportion in each fraction was determined. Clearly, hydrogen peroxide treatment reduced the size of the HSP27 complex, and this occurred regardless of the presence of the kinase inhibitor mixture. Fig. 6B shows quantitatively that hydrogen peroxide also reduced the aggregate size of αB crystallin. However, and in contrast to HSP27, this breakdown of the complex was fully inhibited by the kinase inhibitor mixture. The kinase inhibitors had little effect on the basal size of the two multimeric complexes observed under control aerobic conditions; probably reflecting the fact that they are predominantly at their maximal size under control conditions. The fact that hydrogen peroxide-induced disaggregation of HSP27 cannot be blocked by kinase inhibition supports the contention that this is achieved by S-thiolation. This is further supported by the observation that hydrogen peroxide-induced αB crystallin breakdown can be fully blocked by kinase inhibition, consistent with the fact that this protein cannot beS-thiolated as it contains no cysteine residues. The study of protein S-thiolation in vivo is technically challenging, and progress in this area has been slow because of the difficulties in assessing this oxidative post-translational modification. Most studies of proteinS-thiolation during oxidant stress have used cultured cells with a radiolabeled thiol pool in which the S-thiolated proteins are detected by autoradiography of non-reducing SDS-PAGE gels (36Collison M.W. Thomas J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 928: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Alternatively, non-reducing isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis coupled with Western immunoblotting can be used if the identity of the protein is known, as S-thiolation alters the pI of proteins. In the present study, biotinylated cysteine (biotin-cysteine) has proved extremely useful in the investigation of protein S-thiolation. The presence of a biotin tag on proteins, which become S-thiolated, allowed a range of investigative procedures to be carried out which exploit the high affinity of biotin for avidin derivatives. Thus, S-thiolated proteins were detected on non-reducing Western blots using streptavidin-HRP, and these were quantified via digitization.S-Thiolated proteins were purified using a streptavidin affinity matrix, then identified using Western immunoblotting. Ischemia and reperfusion, as well as hydrogen peroxide treatment, inducedS-thiolation of many cardiac proteins.S-Thiolation of proteins during ischemia and reperfusion is particularly noteworthy, as this is a physiologically relevant oxidant stress, whereas many studies use chemical oxidants that cause a physiologically irrelevant redox change. In this connection, the concentration of hydrogen peroxide (10 μm) that we have used throughout this study is also physiologically pertinent. We have shown that HSP27 is S-thiolated during cardiac oxidative stress, and this induces the multimeric aggregate, basal form of this protein to disassemble. S-Thiolation of rat heart HSP27 must have occurred at cysteine 141, as this is the only cysteine residue in this protein. HSP27 from some species, such as human, has a second cysteine toward the C terminus which may also be a target forS-thiolation. It is interesting that the HSP27 homologue αB crystallin contains no cysteine residues. This is consistent with our observation that oxidant stress (either by GSSG treatment of homogenates or hydrogen peroxide treatment of isolated rat hearts) in the presence of effective kinase inhibition was unable to disaggregate αB crystallin. HSP27 S-thiolation has been previously observed in an in vitro system in which GSSG was added to purified protein. These studies also showed that HSP27 form disulfide-linked dimers and that these paired protein molecules assemble into the large multimeric complexes (37Dudich I.V. Zav'yalov V.P. Pfeil W.

Dudich I. Buchner J. Gaesrel M. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It has also been shown in a cell model that there is a direct relationship between the multimeric aggregate size of HSP27 and the concentration of GSH, as well as evidence of an interplay between HSP27 and GSH, which regulates the cellular levels of these molecules (32Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X. Kotlyarov A. Lutsch G. Ducasse C. Paul C. Wieske M. Arrigo A.-P. Buchner J. Gaestel M. J. Biol.

The oligomeric state of HSP27 regulates its ability to act as a molecular chaperone and could also control the ability of this protein to inhibit the polymerization of actin, an intermediate filament protein, which itself is interestingly also a target of S-thiolation (5Wang J. Boja E. Tan W.H. Tekle E. Fales H.M. English S. Mieyal J.J. Chock P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47763-47766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar,6Chai Y.C. Ashraf S.S.

Indeed, in this system we have been able to identify actin as a substrate for S-thiolation during cardiac reperfusion (29Eaton P. Byers H.L. Leeds N. Ward M.A. Shattock M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9806-9811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The proteins that were S-thiolated during reperfusion are those with reactive cysteines, which may be particularly susceptible to a range of oxidative modification, not just S-thiolation. The actual mode of oxidation may involve modification by a range of species, including glutathione, cysteine, homocysteine, nitrosoglutathione, glutathione sulfonamide, glutathione disulfide S-oxide, nitric oxide, hypochlorous acid, or other oxidizing species (21Mohr S.

In this report, we compare mechanisms of cell death induced in human B lymphoma cells by the inflammatory oxidants superoxide, H2O2, and HOCl. The results indicate that the mode of cell death induced depends on the nature of the oxidant involved and the medium in which the cells are treated. When human Burkitt's lymphoma cells are exposed to superoxide anion, generated as a flux from xanthine and xanthine oxidase, the cells die by a non-apoptotic mechanism (pyknosis/necrosis) identical to that seen when cells are treated with a bolus of reagent H2O2. Addition of superoxide dismutase has no effect, whereas catalase is completely protective, indicating that exogenously generated superoxide kills cells entirely through its dismutation into H2O2. In contrast, cells treated in culture media with reagent HOCl die largely by apoptosis. HOCl-induced apoptosis is mediated by aminoacyl chloramines generated in the culture media and can be mimicked by treatment of cells with taurine chloramine or with long lived chloramines generated from modified Lys or Arg. The results suggest that in a physiological milieu in which O2− and H2O2 are the main oxidants being formed, the principal form of cell death may be necrotic, and under inflammatory conditions in which HOCl is generated, apoptotic cell death may predominate.

Med. 2000; 109: 33-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). These oxidants compose an important element of the host defense against bacteria and tumor cells (3Babior B.M. Blood. 1978; 298: 659-668Google Scholar). However, secreted ROS can have detrimental side effects as well, causing tissue damage and contributing to the development or progression of numerous different diseases (4Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4425) Google Scholar). The primary oxidants generated by all normal phagocytes are the superoxide anion (O2−) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which can, in the presence of reducing metals, go on to form hydroxyl and other free radicals. In addition, monocytes and neutrophils contain high levels of the enzyme myeloperoxidase which catalyzes formation of the potent oxidant, hypochlorous acid (HOCl). HOCl can then go on to react with extracellular amino acids to generate chloramines, which maintain some of the oxidizing potential of HOCl but are not as potent or as broadly reactive (5Zgliczynski J.M. Stelmaszynska T. Ostrowski W. Naskalski J. Sznajd J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 4: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 6Test S.T. Lampert M.B. Ossana P.J. Thoene J.G. Weiss S.J. J. Clin.

Mammalian cells can die by one of several different defined pathways, the most common of which are apoptosis and necrosis. Apoptosis is characterized by a discrete set of biochemical steps and morphological changes including activation of caspases, translocation of phosphatidylserine from the inner to the outer layer of the plasma membrane, chromatin condensation, and fragmentation into apoptotic bodies (8Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12775) Google Scholar, 9Zimmermann K.C. Green D.R. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2001; 108: 99-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In contrast, cells that die by necrosis swell and then lyse, releasing their contents into the extracellular space (10Wyllie A.H. Duvall E. McGee J.O. Isaacson P.J. Wright N.A. Oxford Textbook of Pathology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 141-157Google Scholar). It is thought that death by apoptosis is physiologically advantageous because early apoptotic cells are cleared by phagocytosis and subsequent intracellular degradation (11Savill J. Fadok V. Nature. 2000; 407: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). In this manner, apoptotic cells are removed without causing damage to the surrounding tissue. In contrast, necrotic cells are thought to promote an inflammatory response caused by the leakage of intracellular proteins and nucleic acids prior to phagocytosis. In support of this theory, we found that B lymphoma cells treated with H2O2 die by a non-apoptotic mechanism and are not phagocytosed by macrophages until after they begin to lose their plasma membrane integrity (12Shacter E. Williams J.A. Hinson R.M. Senturker S. Lee Y.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 307-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, early apoptotic cells induced by chemotherapy drugs underwent phagocytosis while their membranes were still intact. Previous research (13Lennon S.V. Martin S.J. Cotter T.G.

Relatively little has been reported on mechanisms of induction of cell death from exogenously generated O2− or HOCl (22Vissers M.C. Pullar J.M. Hampton M.B. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), such as would be produced by activated neutrophils, and we are unaware of any study that does a direct comparison of the modes of cell death induced by the different oxidants in the same cell type. This report compares mechanisms of B lymphoma cell death induced by exogenous O2−, H2O2, and HOCl. The data reveal that O2− kills cells solely through its dismutation into H2O2, and both of these ROS kill by a non-apoptotic mechanism referred to as pyknosis/necrosis (20Lee Y.-J. Shacter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19792-19798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In stark contrast, HOCl induces either necrosis or apoptosis depending on the cell environment; in buffered saline, cell death is entirely by rapid necrosis, and in growth media, cell death is primarily apoptotic. We demonstrate further that long lived aminoacyl chloramines mediate HOCl-induced apoptosis. The Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines JLP-119 and BL-41 were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-Gln, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air as described previously (15Lee Y.-J. Shacter E. Blood. 1997; 12: 4480-4492Crossref Google Scholar). Exponentially growing cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in fresh media to achieve a culture density of 5 × 105cells/ml. Reagent H2O2 (50–200 μm) was added to the cell suspensions, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for the times indicated in the figure legends. A flux of O2− and H2O2 was generated by adding xanthine (XA, 50–400 μm) to the cells in culture media 1 h prior to addition of xanthine oxidase (XO, 20 milliunits; Sigma catalog number X-4500), and cells were incubated for the times indicated in the figure legends. Reagent NaOCl (1–500 μm; Aldrich) or H2O2 was added to the cell suspensions, and the cells were incubated for the times indicated in the figure legends. Concentrations of stock reagents were based on molar extinction coefficients of 350 m −1 cm−1 for NaOCl at 292 nm (23Weiss S.J. Klein R. Slivka A. Wei M. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 70: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) and of 50 m −1cm−1 for H2O2 at 240 nm (24Thurman R.G. Ley H.G. Scholz R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 25: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Chloramine toxicity studies were carried out by mixing each amino acid (2 mm in PBS on ice) with NaOCl (50–500 μm) and then adding the mixtures (1 ml) immediately (<30 s) to cell pellets to get a final density of 5 × 105 cells/ml. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, 1 ml of complete media was added to each well, and cells were incubated for an additional 7 h. Cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with Hoechst 33342 dye (5 μg/ml in PBS), centrifuged, washed once in PBS, and then resuspended at ∼2.5 × 107 cells/ml. Propidium iodide (PI; 50 μg/ml from a 1 mg/ml stock in PBS) was added just before microscopy. Cells were visualized using fluorescence microscopy as described previously (20Lee Y.-J. Shacter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19792-19798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). A minimum of 200 cells was counted, and cell morphology was classified as follows: (i) live cells (normal nuclei, blue chromatin with organized structure); (ii) membrane-intact apoptotic cells (bright blue chromatin which is highly condensed, marginated, or fragmented); (iii) membrane-permeable apoptotic cells (bright red chromatin, highly condensed or fragmented); (iv) necrotic cells (red, enlarged nuclei with smooth normal structure); and (v) pyknotic/necrotic cells (dense, red, slightly condensed nuclei with no fragmentation). To determine the percentage of cells expressing phosphatidylserine (PS) on the exofacial surface of the plasma membrane, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in FACS buffer containing 1.25 μg/ml annexin V-FITC (PharMingen) and 0.1 mg/ml PI in 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Cells (10,000 per sample) were then analyzed on a FACScan (BD Biosciences) using the CELLQUEST flow cytometric analysis software. Cells in the lower right dot plot quadrant (PS-positive and PI-negative) were reported as apoptotic and have intact plasma membranes, whereas cells in the upper right dot plot quadrant (PS-positive and PI-positive) were scored as necrotic and have leaky membranes. In theory, cells in this latter quadrant can also be late apoptotic but were confirmed to be necrotic in our experiments using fluorescence microscopy as described above. In control experiments, we found that the annexin V FACS assay gave comparable results to those obtained by fluorescence microscopy using Hoechst/PI. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with PBS, resuspended in lysis buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, and heated for 10 min at 100 °C. The total cell lysates (50 μg/lane) were subjected to SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with 5% milk, and incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-human CPP32 (caspase-3) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody as described previously (21Lee Y. Shacter E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 684-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Intracellular ATP levels were determined using luciferin-luciferase (26Spragg R.G. Hinshaw D.B. Hyslop P.A. Schraufstätter I.U. Cochrane C.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1471-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) as described previously (20Lee Y.-J. Shacter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19792-19798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 21Lee Y. Shacter E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 684-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) that had been treated with H2O2 or HOCl were collected by centrifugation, pelleted, lysed in 150 μl of 3% HClO4, and placed on ice for 15 min. The solutions were then neutralized with 75 μl of 1 m KOH and 30 μl of potassium phosphate buffer (1 mK2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.4) and incubated on ice for 15 min. The suspensions were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 min to remove the salt precipitate. Supernatants were collected, diluted 1:5 with potassium phosphate buffer (10 mm KH2PO4, 4 mmMgSO4, pH 7.4), and placed on ice. At the time of the assay, 50-μl samples were mixed with 50 μl of 50 mmNaAsO2, 20 mm MgSO4, pH 7.4, in a 96-well plate, followed by addition of 80 μg of luciferin/luciferase. Chemiluminescence was quantified in a Dynatech ML 3000 microtiter plate luminometer (Chantilly, VA). ATP standard curves were run in all experiments and were linear in the range of 5–2500 nm. Stock ATP concentrations were quantified from the absorbance at 259 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 15,400. ATP levels are reported as the % of the ATP levels in control (untreated) cells. The 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) colorimetric assay (27Tietze T. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5516) Google Scholar) was used for the measurement of total cellular non-protein thiols, which are predominantly GSH. Briefly, cells (2–6 × 106 cells) treated with H2O2 or HOCl were collected by centrifugation, washed once with PBS, and resuspended in 300 μl of a 2% solution of 5-sulfosalicylic acid for cell lysis and deproteinization. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min, and then 250 μl of sample was mixed with 250 μl of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) solution (0.3 m sodium phosphate buffer, 10 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), pH 8.0). After incubation at room temperature for 5 min, the absorbance was read at 412 nm. Standard curves were run in all experiments and were linear in the range of 5–100 μm glutathione. GSH levels are reported as the percentage of the GSH levels in control (untreated) cells. Solutions of individual amino acids (2 mm in PBS) were mixed on ice with 50–500 μm HOCl. The absorbance at 252 nm was read immediately, and this value was used as the control (maximum) value (23Weiss S.J. Klein R. Slivka A. Wei M. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 70: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). The solutions were incubated at 37 °C to allow chloramine decay to occur, taking intermittent measurements of the residual absorbance at 252 nm. Results are reported as the percentage of control value. All amino acids were purchased from Sigma except N-α-acetyl-Arg, which was from ICN. The 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine colorimetric assay was used for measurement of aldehyde production as described by Stadtman and Berlett (28Stadtman E.R. Berlett B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17201-17211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stock solutions of amino acids (2 mm in PBS) were mixed on ice with 500 μmHOCl. The solutions were incubated at 37 °C to allow for decay of the chloramines into aldehydes. At various time points, 100 μl of sample was removed and added to 850 μl of 0.02% 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine in 2 m HCl and allowed to sit at room temperature for 15 min. The solutions were neutralized by addition of 750 μl of 2.5 m KOH and then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min. The absorbance of the supernatants at 540 nm was measured. In previous studies, we found that the mode of B lymphoma cell death induced by H2O2 is non-apoptotic (20Lee Y.-J. Shacter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19792-19798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We refer to the cell death induced by H2O2 in these cells as pyknotic/necrotic because the nuclei are slightly condensed, whereas there are no signs of classical apoptotic changes. Quantification of H2O2-induced cell death (18 h of incubation) in two different Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells lines is shown in Fig. 1 and demonstrates again that only a low level of apoptosis is induced by cytotoxic concentrations of H2O2, which for these cell lines is from 50 to 200 μm, with the BL-41 cell line showing greater resistance to H2O2-induced cell death (Fig. 1 B) compared with JLP-119 cells (Fig. 1 A). Because most H2O2 in inflammatory conditions is derived from O2−, we set out to determine whether exogenously generated O2− causes a similar or different mode of cell death. This question is of interest because O2− has the potential to promote hydroxyl radical formation through the Haber-Weiss reaction, in addition to forming H2O2. The results in Fig. 2 show that cell death induced by exposure to O2− generated from XO and XA was primarily pyknotic/necrotic at all treatment levels, similar to H2O2. Addition of superoxide dismutase to the incubation medium had no effect on the type or level of cell death induced, whereas catalase inhibited completely cell death induced by XA/XO. Similar results were obtained with JLP-119 cells (data not shown). The results show that cell death from exogenously generated O2− derives mostly from formation of H2O2.Figure 2Concentration-response study of cell death induced by XA and XO. BL-41 cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of XA for 1 h prior to addition of XO (20 milliunits) in the presence or absence of superoxide dismutase (SOD) or catalase in complete media. Cells were then incubated for 18 h at 37 °C, without washing or exchanging the media, harvested, and stained with Hoechst/PI. Cell death was assessed by nuclear morphology using fluorescence microscopy as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One of the main oxidants generated during an inflammatory response involving neutrophils and/or undifferentiated monocytes is HOCl, formed from the action of myeloperoxidase on H2O2 and Cl− (2Babior B.M. Am. J. Med. 2000; 109: 33-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). When we exposed BL cells to reagent HOCl, we found that, in stark contrast to H2O2 and O2−, a high level of apoptosis was induced (Fig. 3). The other main form of cell death induced from HOCl was classical necrosis, with only a low level of pyknosis/necrosis seen (determined from the nuclear morphology). Note that BL-41 cells, which are somewhat more resistant to oxidant-induced killing than JLP-119 cells, incurred a higher level of necrosis compared with JLP-119 cells, which were mostly apoptotic. Apoptosis was confirmed by measuring activation of caspase-3, as determined from cleavage of the caspase-3 pro-enzyme by Western blot immunoassay (Fig. 4) and by measuring annexin V binding to externalized PS (see below).Figure 4HOCl exposure induces caspase-3 cleavage in both JLP-119 and BL-41 cells. JLP-119 and BL-41 cells were treated with 500 μm HOCl for 10 h, without washing or exchanging the media, and cell lysates were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods.” Caspase-3 cleavage was assessed by Western blot immunoassay for the CPP32 (pro-caspase-3) protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine why H2O2 and HOCl induce such different forms of cell death, we compared the effects of these two oxidants on GSH and ATP levels in the cells. As shown in Fig. 5, the differences cannot be attributed to different effects on cellular GSH levels. Concentrations of H2O2 and HOCl that induce roughly 60–80% cell death in the cells caused mild to moderate reductions in cellular GSH levels (≤20% decrease in JLP-119 cells and ≤35% decrease in BL-41 cells), and the effects of H2O2 and HOCl were nearly identical. In contrast, the effects of H2O2 and HOCl on cellular ATP levels were markedly different (Fig. 6). As we saw previously (20Lee Y.-J. Shacter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19792-19798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), H2O2 caused a complete and irreversible loss of intracellular ATP within 15 min after addition to the cells. However, HOCl caused only a mild and transient drop in ATP levels that was restored to control levels within 1 (BL-41 cells) to 2 h (JLP-119 cells). The ability of HOCl to induce apoptosis correlates with its ability to induce significant cell damage without depleting the cells of ATP and is consistent with reports that ATP must be maintained at or above 25% of control levels in order for apoptosis to occur (19Lelli J.L. Becks L.L. Dabroska M.I. Hinshaw D.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 20Lee Y.-J. Shacter E. J. Biol.

JLP-119 cells (A) and BL-41 cells (B) were exposed to H2O2 (100 μm for JLP-119 or 200 μm for BL-41 cells) or HOCl (500 μm for both cell lines) for up to 2 h, without washing or exchanging the media. Cellular ATP levels were measured at the indicated times and are presented as the percentage of the ATP levels in control (untreated) cells. Control ATP levels in JLP-119 and BL-41 cells were 0.9 and 1.3 nmol/106 cells, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous studies into the mechanism of cytotoxicity induced by HOCl found that the main mode of cell death is necrotic (30Schraufstätter I.U. Browne K. Harris A. Hyslop P.A. Jackson J.H. Quehenberger O. Cochrane C.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), with endothelial cells undergoing only low levels of apoptosis in response to HOCl treatment (22Vissers M.C. Pullar J.M. Hampton M.B. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We noted that those earlier studies were carried out by treating the cells in buffer, not growth media, so we set out to determine whether the medium in which the cells are treated influences the mechanism of cell killing. Note that these and all subsequent experiments were performed with BL-41 cells, and apoptosis was quantified primarily by measuring binding of annexin V followed by FACS analysis to detect cells that have externalized plasma membrane phosphatidylserine, a hallmark of apoptosis. BL-41 cells were selected because they express significantly higher levels of exofacial PS than JLP-119 cells. Control studies showed that the annexin V assay gave nearly identical results for the quantification of apoptotic and necrotic cells as the assay for nuclear morphology (see “Materials and Methods” for experimental details). The results in Fig. 7 show that when BL-41 cells are treated with HOCl in PBS/glucose, cell death is entirely by necrosis. In contrast, when the cells are treated either in complete media (i.e. containing 10% fetal calf serum) or in RPMI alone, cell death is primarily apoptotic. The data in Fig. 7 also demonstrate that higher levels of HOCl are required to kill the cells in the more complex media, i.e. cell death measured at 8–10 h is only 70% as high when the cells are treated in complete media (RPMI plus 10% serum) than when they are treated in plain RPMI. Significantly higher cell death is achieved at lower HOCl concentrations when the cells are treated in PBS/glucose, and death appears much more rapidly (within 2 h). It is widely thought that oxidants and other cytotoxic agents induce apoptosis at low concentrations and necrosis at high concentrations (13Lennon S.V. Martin S.J. Cotter T.G. Cell Proliferation. 1991; 24: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). To determine whether HOCl might induce apoptosis in PBS if lower concentrations were employed, we treated BL-41 cells with levels of HOCl ranging from 1 to 500 μm, and we measured cell death after 8 h. The cells are relatively unstable in PBS/glucose in the absence of protein and die spontaneously when incubated for longer times. Hence, incubations in PBS were limited to 2 h after which complete media were added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 6 h. As shown in Fig. 8, we did not detect any apoptosis when cells were treated in this manner with low concentrations of HOCl in PBS/glucose. The results in Fig. 7 demonstrate a profound effect of the media on the mode and level of cell killing by HOCl. RPMI contains several types of components including vitamins, salts, glucose, and high levels of free amino acids (6.8 mm total, which is comparable with the level of amino acids found in human plasma) (31Linder M. Linder M. Nutritional Biochemistry and Metabolism. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1992: 87-109Google Scholar). In initial experiments, we found that of these components, only the amino acids influenced HOCl-induced cell killing; treatment of cells in RPMI vitamins or salts gave results similar to treatment in PBS/glucose. It is well known that HOCl can react with amino acids to form chloramines (5Zgliczynski J.M. Stelmaszynska T. Ostrowski W. Naskalski J. Sznajd J. Eur. J.

Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The mode of cell killing by aminoacyl chloramines has not been described previously. The following experiments demonstrate that induction of apoptosis by treatment of BL cells with HOCl in RPMI is mediated by formation of long lived aminoacyl chloramines. Unless otherwise note"
https://openalex.org/W2083875713,"Sindbis virus (SV) is an alpha virus used as a model for studying the role of apoptosis in virus infection. In this study, we examined the role of protein kinase C (PKC) in the apoptosis induced by SVNI, a virulent strain of SV. Infection of C6 cells with SVNI induced a selective translocation of PKCδ to the endoplasmic reticulum and its tyrosine phosphorylation. The specific PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin and a PKCδ kinase-dead mutant increased the apoptosis induced by SVNI. To examine the role of the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ in the apoptosis induced by SVNI we used a PKCδ mutant in which five tyrosine residues were mutated to phenylalanine (PKCδ5). PKCδ5-overexpressing cells exhibited increased apoptosis in response to SVNI as compared with control cells and to cells overexpressing PKCδ. SVNI also increased the cleavage of caspase 3 in cells overexpressing PKCδ5 but did not induce cleavage of PKCδ or PKCδ5. Using single tyrosine mutants, we identified tyrosines 52, 64, and 155 as the phosphorylation sites associated with the apoptosis induced by SVNI. We conclude that PKCδ exerts an inhibitory effect on the apoptosis induced by SV and that phosphorylation of PKCδ on specific tyrosines is required for this function. Sindbis virus (SV) is an alpha virus used as a model for studying the role of apoptosis in virus infection. In this study, we examined the role of protein kinase C (PKC) in the apoptosis induced by SVNI, a virulent strain of SV. Infection of C6 cells with SVNI induced a selective translocation of PKCδ to the endoplasmic reticulum and its tyrosine phosphorylation. The specific PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin and a PKCδ kinase-dead mutant increased the apoptosis induced by SVNI.

Sindbis virus protein kinase C phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate endoplasmic reticulum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay green fluorescent protein phosphate-buffered saline fluorescence-activated cell sorter kinase-dead control vector phosphatidylinositol multiplicity of infection Sindbis virus (SV)1 is a single-stranded positive-strand RNA alphavirus that has been used as a model for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying virus-induced apoptosis (1Griffin D.E. Hardwick J.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 565-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Infection of cells with SV results in either persistent or lytic infection depending on the cell type and the viral strain (1Griffin D.E. Hardwick J.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 565-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 2Griffin D.E. Hardwick J.M. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 155-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). SV lytic infection induces apoptosis, which can be inhibited by overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 (3Levine B. Huang Q. Isaacs J.T. Reed J.C. Griffin D.E. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1993; 361: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Similarly, overexpression of anti-apoptotic genes such as bcl-2,beclin, and crmA inhibits mortality of mice following SV infection (4Liang X.H. Kleeman L.K. Jiang H.H. Gordon G. Goldman J.E. Berry G. Herman B. Levine B. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8586-8596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and converts lytic to persistent infection (3Levine B. Huang Q. Isaacs J.T. Reed J.C. Griffin D.E. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1993; 361: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Because the neurovirulence of the different viral strains correlates with mortality in mice and with the apoptosis of cultured cells, it has been suggested that the apoptosis plays a central role in the pathogenesis of the virus (5Griffin D.E. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 1998; 22: 721-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Little is known about the signal transduction pathways involved in the apoptotic effect of SV. In a recent study, SV has been reported to increase the phosphorylation of p38 and Hsp27 (6Nakatsue T. Katoh I. Nakamura S. Takahashi Y. Ikawa Y. Yoshinaka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, SV induces ceramide formation (7Jan J.T. Chatterjee S. Griffin D.E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6425-6432Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and activation of double-strand RNA-dependent protein kinase (8Lin K.I. DiDonato J.A. Hoffmann A. Hardwick J.M. Ratan R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1479-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and nuclear factor κB (9Saito S. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 34: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The protein kinase C (PKC) family of serine-threonine kinases plays important roles in signal transduction and in various cellular functions (10Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5764) Google Scholar, 11Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3535) Google Scholar, 12Toker A. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D1134-D1147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At least 12 isoforms have been described so far showing diversity in their structures and biological functions (13Jaken S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar,14Ron D. Kazanietz M.G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1658-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The PKC isoforms are grouped on the basis of their structures and cofactor requirements into three main subclasses, the classical PKCs (α, β1, β2, and γ), the novel PKCs (δ, ε, η, and θ), and the atypical PKCs (PKCζ and PKC τ/λ). The two other members, PKCμ and PKCν, represent a fourth subclass with unique characteristics (15Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol.

Acta. 1999; 1450: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The regulation of PKC activity involves phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues (17Newton A.C.

In addition, recent studies suggest that phosphorylation on tyrosine residues can modulate the activity and substrate recognition of PKC (19Haleem-Smith H. Chang E.Y. Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M. Rivera J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9112-9116Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The PKCs have been implicated as important regulators of cell apoptosis (20Dempsey E.C. Newton A.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Fields A.P. Reyland M.E. Insel P.A. Messing R.O. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2000; 279: L429-L438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Cross T.G.

PKCα, PKCε, and PKCι have been associated with inhibition of cell apoptosis (22Gubina E. Rinaudo M.S. Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M. Mufson R.A.

Indeed, apoptotic stimuli such as etoposide and ionizing radiation induce the cleavage of these isoforms and the accumulation of active catalytic fragments (25Koriyama H. Kouchi Z. Umeda T.

PKCδ has been reported to play a role in the apoptosis induced by etoposide (27Reyland M.E. Anderson S.M. Matassa A.A. Barzen K.A. Quissell D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19115-19123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and in the apoptosis of keratinocytes and LNCaP cells in response to PMA (28Fujii T.

Biol. 1999; 19: 8547-8558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although most studies suggest that PKCδ is associated with the induction of apoptosis, an anti-apoptotic effect for PKCδ has been reported for some systems (30Wert M.M. Palfrey H.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In a recent study, we reported that etoposide induced apoptosis of C6 cells via activation of PKCδ and its tyrosine phosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues (31Blass M. Kronfeld I. Kazimirsky G. Blumberg P.M. Brodie C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report that infection of C6 cells with SVNI, a neurovirulent strain of Sindbis virus, also induced selective activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ. Furthermore, we found that this phosphorylation was essential for the ability of PKCδ to protect C6 cells from SVNI-induced apoptosis. Our results emphasize that the action of PKC depends critically on its biological context. Monoclonal anti-PKCδ antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and polyclonal anti-PKC antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Alexa Fluor antibodies and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker DiOC5 (3Levine B. Huang Q. Isaacs J.T. Reed J.C. Griffin D.E. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1993; 361: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). An anti-active caspase 3 antibody was obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Cell fragmentation (anti-histone) ELISA and lactate dehydrogenase kits were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Leupeptin, aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, sodium vanadate, and anti-actin antibody were obtained from Sigma. The variant of Sindbis virus used in this study was described previously (32Lustig S. Halevy M. Ben Nathan D. Akov Y. Arch. Virol. 1992; 122: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, the neurovirulent strain SVNI was isolated by serial passages of an SV strain in brains of suckling and weanling mice. Growth of SVNI was quantified on Vero cells by plaque formation as described previously (33Strauss E.G. Lenches E.M. Strauss J.H. Virology. 1976; 74: 154-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, a dilution of virus was added to Vero cell monolayers in Petri dishes and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to permit viral absorption. The monolayer was overlaid with 2× minimum Eagle's medium and 2% tragacanth (gum tragacanth grade III; Sigma) containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 2.4% NaHCO3. Cultures were incubated for 48 h, and plaques were counted after staining with 0.05% neutral red. Site-directed mutagenesis of PKCδ was performed using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Conversion of tyrosine residues at sites 52, 64, 155, 187, and 565 into phenylalanine was performed as described previously (34Brodie C. Bogi K. Acs P. Lorenzo P.S. Baskin L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30713-30718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). PKCδ and the PKCδ mutants were subcloned into the metallothionein promoter-driven eukaryotic expression vector (εMTH). C6 cells were grown in medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.05 mg/ml). The cells were transfected with either the empty vectors or with the PKCδ and PKCδ mutant expression vectors using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen) as described (34Brodie C. Bogi K. Acs P. Lorenzo P.S. Baskin L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30713-30718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For the translocation studies, cells were transiently transfected with the PKCδ-GFP fusion protein as described (34Brodie C. Bogi K. Acs P. Lorenzo P.S. Baskin L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30713-30718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out routinely on two clones of the transfected cells. Cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry after propidium iodide staining, by Hoechst staining, and by ELISA using anti-histone antibodies. Cells were infected with SVNI for 24 or 36 h. Detached cells and trypsinized adherent cells were collected, fixed in 70% ethanol for 1 h on ice, washed with PBS, and treated for 15 min with RNase (200 μg/ml) at room temperature. Cells were stained with propidium iodide (5 μg/ml) and analyzed on a BD PharMingen cell sorter. For Hoechst staining, cells were fixed with methanol and incubated for 10 min with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258. Cells were then viewed and counted under UV illumination for the visualization of the Hoechst-stained nuclei. For anti-histone ELISA, fragmented DNA was extracted from the control and infected cells and was incubated in 96-well plates coated with anti-histone antibodies for 2 h. Plates were incubated with anti-DNA antibodies conjugated to peroxidase for an additional 2 h. Substrate solution was added, and absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Cells were washed twice in cold PBS, scraped with a rubber policeman, and sonicated in 100 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μm leupeptin, 0.5 mmNa3VO4) for 15 s. Sample buffer (2×) was added, and the samples were boiled for 5 min. Lysates (30 μg of protein) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently stained with the primary antibody. Specific reactive bands were detected using a goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad), and the immunoreactive bands were visualized by the ECL Western blotting detection kit (AmershamBiosciences). Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (34Brodie C. Bogi K. Acs P. Lorenzo P.S. Baskin L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30713-30718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, C6 cells were infected with SVNI for different periods of time. The samples were pre-absorbed with 25 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose for 10 min, and immunoprecipitation was performed using 4 μg/ml of anti-PKCδ or anti-PKCε antibody for 1 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with 30 μl of A/G-Sepharose for an additional hour. Following washes, the pellets were resuspended in 25 μl of SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The samples were subjected to Western blotting. Cells were infected with SVNI for 1–6 h. Cells were then washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Subsequently, cells were washed in PBS and, after blocking with staining buffer (2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature, were incubated with the specific anti-PKC antibodies followed by incubation with an anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 or with anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 546 antibodies for an additional hour. Cells were mounted using FluoroGuard antifade reagent and were viewed and photographed using confocal microscopy with ×63 magnification at excitation wavelengths of 543 and 488 nm. For ER staining, fixed and permeabilized cells were incubated for 30 min with the ER marker, DiOC5 (3Levine B. Huang Q. Isaacs J.T. Reed J.C. Griffin D.E. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1993; 361: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The results are presented as the mean values ± S.E. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance and a Student's t test. SVNI infection induced apoptosis of the C6 cells, which was detected 24 h post-infection and reached maximal levels after 36 h. Using FACS analysis of propidium iodide-stained cells, we found that ∼25–35% of the cells were apoptotic in response to SVNI after 24 h of treatment, and ∼60% of the cells underwent apoptosis after 36 h (Fig. 1 A). Infection of the cells with SVNI reduced the number of the cells and resulted in the appearance of rounded and detached cells, which are characteristic of apoptotic cells (Fig. 1 B). Visualization of Hoechst-positive cells (Fig. 1 C) and anti-histone ELISA (Fig. 1 D) provided further measures of the induction of apoptosis. PKC has been implicated as an important regulator of cell apoptosis (20Dempsey E.C. Newton A.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Fields A.P. Reyland M.E. Insel P.A. Messing R.O. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2000; 279: L429-L438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,21Cross T.G. Scheel-Toellner D. Henriquez N.V. Deacon E. Salmon M. Lord J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). To study the possible involvement of PKC in the apoptosis induced by SVNI, we first examined the effect of SVNI on the translocation of the different PKC isoforms expressed in the C6 cells. For these experiments we infected C6 cells with SVNI for 1, 3, and 6 h and followed the translocation of the different PKC isoforms using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. SVNI induced translocation of PKCδ, as is evident both in its depletion from the nucleus and in its accumulation in the perinuclear region (Fig.2 A). Translocation was already observed after 1 h, reached maximal levels after 3 h, and returned to control levels after 6 h. PKCα, -β, -ζ, -μ, and -ι did not show detectable translocation after infection of the cells with SVNI (data not shown). To further characterize the translocation of PKCδ in response to SVNI infection we visualized the ER using the ER marker DiOC5(3Levine B. Huang Q. Isaacs J.T. Reed J.C. Griffin D.E. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1993; 361: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, the ER marker DiOC5(3Levine B. Huang Q. Isaacs J.T. Reed J.C. Griffin D.E. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1993; 361: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) accumulated in the perinuclear region in a similar pattern to that of PKCδ in SVNI-treated cells. Merged images showed clearly colocalization of the fluorescence of the DiOC5 (3Levine B. Huang Q. Isaacs J.T. Reed J.C. Griffin D.E. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1993; 361: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) and of the Alexa Fluor 546 used to visualize anti-PKCδ, suggesting that SVNI induced translocation of PKCδ to the ER. The pattern of translocation of PKCδ obtained using GFP-tagged PKCδ was similar to that determined by immunofluorescence. Thus, SVNI infection of cells transiently transfected with GFP-PKCδ induced translocation of PKCδ to the perinuclear region (Fig. 2 C). It should be noted that this pattern of translocation of PKCδ contrasts with a different pattern of translocation upon treatment of the cells with PMA. As has been described elsewhere (39Kronfeld I. Kazimirsky G. Lorenzo P.S. Garfield S.H. Blumberg P.M. Brodie C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35491-35498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), PMA induced translocation of PKCδ to the plasma and nuclear membranes (Fig. 2 C). Because SVNI induced a selective translocation of PKCδ, we examined the role of this PKC isoform in the apoptotic effect of SVNI. As an initial approach, we used the PKCδ selective inhibitor rottlerin. Treatment of C6 cells with rottlerin (5 μm) or with the vehicle control Me2SO (data not shown) did not affect the basal level of cell apoptosis. However, rottlerin increased the apoptotic effect of SVNI by ∼30–40%, suggesting that PKCδ may exert a protective effect on SVNI-infected C6 cells (Fig.3 A). Because the specificity of rottlerin for PKCδ has been questioned (36Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3956) Google Scholar, 37Gschwendt M.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we explored further the role of PKCδ in the apoptotic effect of SVNI by using a PKCδ kinase-dead mutant (PKCδ KD; K376R). Cells stably expressing the PKCδ KD mutant were infected with SVNI for 24 h. Infection of the PKCδ KD-expressing cells induced increased cell apoptosis compared with CV cells as observed by cell morphology (Fig.3 B) and by anti-histone ELISA (Fig. 3 C). The role of PKCδ in the apoptotic effect of SVNI was examined further using cells stably overexpressing PKCδ. The expression of PKCδ in these cells was about 6-fold higher than the level of PKCδ in the control vector cells (39Kronfeld I. Kazimirsky G. Lorenzo P.S. Garfield S.H. Blumberg P.M. Brodie C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35491-35498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As determined by PI staining, cells overexpressing PKCδ exhibited a lower rate of apoptosis in response to SVNI (16.3 ± 1.9% apoptotic cells) as compared with control vector cells (34.8 ± 4.5) (Fig. 3 D). We conclude that PKCδ protected C6 cells from apoptosis induced by SVNI, and, conversely, that abrogation of PKCδ functions either with rottlerin or through expression of the PKCδ KD enhanced apoptosis induced by SVNI. PKCδ undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to various apoptotic stimuli (31Blass M. Kronfeld I. Kazimirsky G. Blumberg P.M. Brodie C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 35Konishi H. Yamauchi E. Taniguchi H. Yamamoto T. Matsuzaki H. Takemura Y. Ohmae K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To examine whether infection with SVNI induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ, we infected C6 cells with SVNI for 1–4 h. PKCδ was immunoprecipitated, and the membrane was blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 4 A, SVNI induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ in a time-dependent manner, and maximal phosphorylation was obtained after 2 h. We did not detect tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCε (Fig. 4 B) or of the other PKC isoforms (data not shown). To explore the importance of the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ in the apoptosis induced by SVNI, we employed a PKCδ mutant in which five putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites, 52, 64, 155, and 187 in the regulatory domain and tyrosine 565 in the catalytic domain, were mutated to phenylalanine (34Brodie C. Bogi K. Acs P. Lorenzo P.S. Baskin L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30713-30718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The expression of this mutant in C6 cells and its effects on cell proliferation, glutamine synthetase expression, and cell apoptosis in response to etoposide have been described (31Blass M. Kronfeld I. Kazimirsky G. Blumberg P.M. Brodie C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 34Brodie C. Bogi K. Acs P. Lorenzo P.S. Baskin L. Blumberg P.M. J.

In contrast to the results observed in response to etoposide, PKCδ5-overexpressing cells exhibited a significantly increased cell apoptosis, compared with control vector cells and with cells overexpressing PKCδ, both as determined by PI staining (Fig.5 B) and by the morphological appearance of the cells (Fig.5 C). To determine whether the differential effect of SVNI on the apoptosis of cells overexpressing PKCδ and PKCδ5 is because of changes in virus replication, we measured viral replication by plaque assay. Cells were infected with SVNI (m.o.i. 5) for 9, 24, and 48 h. Using plaque assay, we found that the replication of SVNI was similar in control cells and in cells overexpressing PKCδ and PKCδ5 (Table I).Table IReplication of SVNI in cells overexpressing CV, PKCδ, and PKCδ5Time9 h 2448CV5.5 × 1061.5 × 1081.4 × 108PKCδ5.0 × 1068.9 × 1079.5 × 107PKCδ59.5 × 1061.4 × 1081.1 × 108C6 cells overexpressing control vector (CV), PKCδ, or PKCδ5 were infected with SVNI (m.o.i. 5) for various periods of time.

The replication of SVNI was determined using plaque assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results represent one of three separate experiments, which gave similar results. The apoptosis induced by SVNI is mediated by caspases (41Nava V.E. Rosen A. Veliuona M.A. Clem R.J. Levine B. Hardwick J.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 452-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a recent study we demonstrated that tyrosine-phosphorylated PKCδ regulated the cleavage of caspase 3, which in turn cleaved PKCδ to release the active catalytic domain (31Blass M. Kronfeld I. Kazimirsky G. Blumberg P.M. Brodie C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To further explore the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ in the apoptosis induced by infection of SVNI, we compared the cleavage of caspase 3 in cells overexpressing control vector, PKCδ, and the PKCδ5 mutant. Using a specific antibody that recognizes the cleaved product (17 kDa) of caspase 3, we detected a cleaved fragment of caspase 3 in SVNI-infected control vector cells. Cells overexpressing PKCδ exhibited very low levels of cleaved caspase 3, whereas large amounts of the cleaved product were obtained in cells overexpressing PKCδ5 (Fig. 6 A). To examine whether SVNI infection induced cleavage of PKCδ or PKCδ5, we infected C6 cells overexpressing PKCδ and PKCδ5 with SVNI for 12 and 24 h and analyzed cell lysates by Western blotting. Using the ε tag, which could detect the cleaved catalytic domain of the exogenous PKCδ and PKCδ5, we found no detectable cleaved product in either of the infected cells (Fig. 6 B), suggesting that although SVNI infection induced activation of caspase 3, caspase 3 did not cleave PKCδ or PKCδ5. To examine the role of the specific tyrosine residues in the effect of PKCδ on cell apoptosis induced by SVNI, we used C6 cells stably transfected with different PKCδ mutants in which each one of the tyrosines (52Jan J.T. Griffin D.E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 10296-10302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 64, 155, 187, 565) was mutated individually to phenylalanine. The expression of these mutants in C6 cells was described previously (39Kronfeld I. Kazimirsky G. Lorenzo P.S. Garfield S.H. Blumberg P.M. Brodie C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35491-35498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We found that cells overexpressing PKCδY52F, PKCδY64F, and PKCδY155F exhibited an enhanced apoptotic response to SVNI albeit to a lesser extent than cells overexpressing PKCδ5. In contrast, infection with SVNI of cells overexpressing PKCδY187F or PKCδY565F resulted in a lower apoptotic response, similar to the response observed in cells overexpressing PKCδ (Fig.7 A). We also found that infection with SVNI induced a smaller increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδY52F, PKCδY64F, and PKCδY155F as compared with PKCδ (Fig. 7 B). The lowest degree of the tyrosine phosphorylation was obtained in cells overexpressing the PKCδY155F mutant, as compared with the other single tyrosine mutants. Correspondingly, this mutant exhibited the highest degree of cell apoptosis in response to SVNI (Fig. 7 B). In this study we explored the role of PKC in the apoptosis induced by Sindbis virus infection. We found that infection of the cells with SVNI induced a selective translocation and tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ and that the phosphorylated PKCδ exerted a"

These carefully orchestrated events include the destruction of the securin protein to permit entry into anaphase, and the destruction of cyclin B to permit exit from mitosis. These destruction events are mediated by the ubiquitin/proteasome system. The human ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, UbcH10, is an essential mediator of the mitotic destruction events. We report here the 1.95-Å crystal structure of a mutant UbcH10, in which the active site cysteine has been replaced with a serine. Functional analysis indicates that the mutant is active in accepting ubiquitin, although not as efficiently as wild-type. Examination of the crystal structure reveals that the NH2-terminal extension in UbcH10 is disordered and that a conserved 310-helix places a lysine residue near the active site. Analysis of relevant mutants demonstrates that for ubiquitin-adduct formation the presence or absence of the NH2-terminal extension has little effect, whereas the lysine residue near the active site has significant effect. The structure provides additional insight into UbcH10 function including possible sites of interaction with the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome and the disposition of a putative destruction box motif in the structure.

At least two such control points occur in mitosis. One is at the transition from metaphase to anaphase and the other is at the exit from mitosis (for reviews, see Refs. 1King R.W. Deshaies R.J.

Biol. 2001; 3: E12-E14Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). At the transition from metaphase to anaphase, the securin protein in the securin-separase protein complex is destroyed to release separase. The freed separase cleaves the protein complexes binding the sister chromatids together. Cleavage of these protein complexes is thought to facilitate sister chromatid segregation, and hence entry into anaphase. To exit from mitosis, cyclin B in the cyclin B-cdc2 complex must be destroyed. Destruction of cyclin B results in the inactivation of the cdc2 kinase. The inactivation of cdc2 is an essential event for resetting the cell cycle machinery (6Noton E. Diffley J.F. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 85-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).To accomplish the ubiquitination of securin and cyclin B (and other proteins targeted for ubiquitin-mediated destruction), three enzyme activities, designated E11(ubiquitin activating enzyme), E2 (ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, Ubc), and E3 (ubiquitin ligase), must work in concert (for review, see Ref.7Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6793) Google Scholar). The E1 protein activates ubiquitin and then transfers it to the E2 protein. The ubiquitin forms an adduct to the E2 protein via a thiol ester linkage between the active site cysteine of E2 and the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin. The E2 then donates the ubiquitin to the target protein, either directly or in conjunction with the E3 activity. In some instances, the same protein possesses both the E2 and E3 activity. Ultimately, a polyubiquitin-target protein conjugate is formed that then is recognized by the proteasome. The proteasome hydrolyzes the target protein and releases free ubiquitin. Whereas ubiquitin and E1 are highly conserved proteins, each eukaryotic organism contains several different E2 and E3 activities. The various E2 and E3 proteins function in cognate pairs and provide specificity in target protein ubiquitination.In the case of mitotic destruction of securin and cyclin B, the same E2 and E3 activities are thought to be responsible for the destruction of both proteins. The E3 activity is contained in a large multisubunit complex, termed the anaphase promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C). The target protein specificity for ubiquitination seems to be conferred by different particular subunit compositions of the APC/C. The mitotic E2 proteins have been identified in several organisms, including human (UbcH10) (8Townsley F.M. Aristarkhov A. Beck S. Hershko A. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 375-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These mitotic proteins are essential for cell cycle progression since mutation of the active site cysteine confers a dominant negative phenotype (8Townsley F.M. Aristarkhov A. Beck S. Hershko A.

Therefore, the E2 protein must maintain structural features that allow interactions with the common elements of the system, ubiquitin and E1, and yet specify interactions with its cognate E3 and target protein. Although the crystal structures of several Ubc proteins have been determined and examination of their structures has given much insight into the function of this family of proteins (15Cook W.J.

Here we report the 1.95-Å crystal structure determination of the mitotic specific E2 protein from humans, UbcH10, an essential protein for cell cycle progression. We also report complementary functional analysis of select mutants. These studies provide new insight into E2 function.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe have determined the crystal structure of a mutant UbcH10, in which the active site cysteine has been changed to a serine. Extensive efforts to obtain well diffracting crystals of wild-type UbcH10 were not successful. However, the C114S mutant (designated mUbcH10) should be nearly isosteric with the wild-type, and therefore can provide insight into the stereochemical basis of Ubc function in general and UbcH10 function in particular.Activity of Mutant UbcH10We tested the ability of mutant UbcH10 to accept ubiquitin as an adduct. The linkage between mUbcH10 and ubiquitin should be an ester bond rather than the thiol ester bond that occurs with wild type. In our assay, as shown in Fig.1A, mUbcH10 indeed can form an adduct with ubiquitin, although the formation of adduct is much slower with mUbcH10 than with wild-type UbcH10. As is expected of an ester bond, the ubiquitin linkage to mUbcH10 is resistant to β-mercaptoethanol reduction but not to alkaline hydrolysis (Fig. 1, B and D). The control reaction with wild-type UbcH10 indicates that such treatment with β-mercaptoethanol is sufficient to cleave a thiol ester bond (Fig. 1B). Our observation of the ability of the cysteine to serine Ubc mutant being able to accept ubiquitin is consistent with most previous reports of similarly mutated Ubcs being able to accept ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins (35Sullivan M.L. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8777-8780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 745-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 37Wada H. Yeh E.T. Kamitani T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17008-17015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 38Miura T. Klaus W. Gsell B. Miyamoto C. Senn H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 213-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 39Banerjee A. Deshaies R.J. Chau V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26209-26215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, one published report indicates that a similarly mutated C114S in the mouse homolog of UbcH10 isnot able to accept ubiquitin (14Yamanaka A. Hatakeyama S. Kominami K. Kitagawa M. Matsumoto M. Nakayama K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2821-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This discrepancy could be due to differences in the sensitivities of ubiquitin detection methods used (streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase/ECL detection of biotinylated ubiquitin used here versus125I-labeled ubiquitin detected by autoradiography used in the previous report). Whereas the mUbcH10 is active in accepting ubiquitin as demonstrated here, it is a dominant-negative mutant (8Townsley F.M. Aristarkhov A. Beck S. Hershko A. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2362-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The dominant-negative nature of the mutant can be explained in part by the low free energy of hydrolysis of the ester bond compared with that of the thiol ester bond, thereby making transfer of the ubiquitin from the mUbcH10 to the target protein relatively less favored. In such a case, the mUbcH10-ubiquitin adduct may remain bound unproductively to the APC/C. In addition, the slow rate of mUbcH10-ubiquitin adduct formation suggests that perhaps the mUbcH10, even without the linked ubiquitin, is able to sequester components of the ubiquitination machinery.An intriguing observation we note is that after longer incubation times, we detect what apparently are polyubiquitin chains being formed on the UbcH10 (Fig. 1A). The linkage to UbcH10 is resistant to reduction by β-mercaptoethanol treatment (Fig. 1B). This suggests that the polyubiquitin chain is linked to UbcH10 by an isopeptide bond and not with a thiol ester linkage. Autoubiquitination of other Ubcs has been reported before (40Banerjee A. Gregori L., Xu, Y. Chau V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5668-5675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Arnold J.E. Gevers W. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Although this autoubiquitination may represent nonspecific transfer of ubiquitin to a nearby primary amine (42Pickart C.M. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1573-1581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it may be relevant to the recently reported findings that cellular levels of UbcH10 are cell cycle dependent (10Arvand A. Bastians H. Welford S.M. Thompson A.D. Ruderman J.V. Denny C.T. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2039-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar,14Yamanaka A. Hatakeyama S. Kominami K. Kitagawa M. Matsumoto M. Nakayama K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2821-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and that UbcH10 apparently is destroyed in an APC-facilitated manner (14Yamanaka A. Hatakeyama S. Kominami K. Kitagawa M. Matsumoto M. Nakayama K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2821-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Overall Fold of UbcH10We have solved and refined the crystal structure of the active site C114S mutant of the mitotic-specific ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme from human using data to 1.95-Å resolution. The data quality and model refinement statistics are presented in Table I. The UbcH10 protein is an α+β protein with one 4-stranded antiparallel β sheet and 4 α-helices (Fig. 2). The topology of the β sheet falls into group B (up-and-down meander motif) as defined by Zhang and Kim (43Zhang C. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1075-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The residues forming the β sheet are located in the primary sequence between the residues forming the first and second helices. The NH2-terminal helix lays diagonally across one broad face of the sheet, whereas the other three helices flank two opposite edges of the sheet. Almost two turns of a 310-helix (residues 115–119) are located between the fourth strand of the sheet and the second α-helix. The active site residue (114) is situated in a set of β turns and adjacent to the NH2 terminus of the 310-helix. The overall shape of the UbcH10 protein is roughly that of an elongated triangular prism. The side chain of the active site residue is situated on one long edge of the prism.FIG. 2The overall fold of mUbcH10 (divergent stereoview). The α-helices, 310-helix, and β-strands are shown in red, green, and blue, respectively. The active site residue (114) is depicted in ball-and-stick rendering. This and all other structure figures were prepared using the Swiss-PDB Viewer (53Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9472) Google Scholar) and in certain cases post-processed with POV-Ray (www.povray.org) or MegaPOV (nathan.kopp.com/patched.htm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Comparison with Other Ubc StructuresThe secondary structural elements are highly conserved in all known Ubc structures (Fig.3, A and B). In particular, β strands 3 and 4 are strictly conserved in length, whereas deviations in the lengths of β strands 1 and 2 lead to a local breakdown of structural equivalence (Fig. 3A). All four α-helices display small variations in terms of length, whereas the 310 helix is extremely well conserved. When the various Ubc structures are superimposed, it is seen quite distinctly that the continuous polypeptide segment consisting of β strands 2, 3, 4, the 310 helix, helix 2, and the intervening turns are relatively highly conserved in backbone position. The remaining regions display more variability in disposition. As can be seen from Fig.3B, these more variable regions flank the more highly conserved region. Moreover, the active site residue, although situated in the highly conserved segment, is near a set of turns connecting helices 2 and 3 that are relatively poorly conserved. The variable regions on the face opposite to that containing the active site could be involved in interactions with E3 activities that function by providing a scaffolding for interaction of the Ubc-ubiquitin adduct. The variable regions near the active site could represent sites of interaction with E3 activities that involve ubiquitin transfer to the E3 prior to the target protein or could be important for target protein recognition. The rather striking structural conservation of β strands 2–4 and helix 2 is not reflected in the sequence (Fig. 3C). Overall, this region is not better conserved in the sequence than the other parts of the protein. The strong evolutionary pressure to maintain structure and the relatively low pressure to maintain sequence suggest that this region is more important for intrinsic structural reasons than for specific protein-protein interactions. This comparison makes clear that the Ubc structure is exquisitely structurally tuned to perform its function.FIG. 3Comparison of Ubc structures.A, structure-based sequence alignment. The structures of the Ubc proteins were superimposed and structurally equivalent residues were identified using the program STAMP (54Russell R.B. STAMP (Version 4.2) manual. 1999; barton.ebi.ac.ukGoogle Scholar, 55Russell R.B. Barton G.J. Proteins. 1992; 14: 309-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar).

Helical regions and β strand regions are indicated in gray and blackbackgrounds, respectively, and are labeled. B, divergent stereoview of superimposed Ubc structures. Only the α-carbon atoms are shown. The loop extending from a single structure near the 310 helix is in the Ubc7 structure. The secondary structural elements are labeled.

The ribbon is color coded according to sequence conservation with blue being the most conserved and red the least conserved. The most highly conserved region in the structure (panel B) is not uniformly the most highly conserved region in sequence. The sequence alignment was performed using the ConSurf server (Ref. 56Armon A. Graur D. Ben-Tal N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 447-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, bioinfo.tau.ac.il/ConSurf/).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)NH2-terminal ExtensionThe full-length UbcH10 contains 179 residues. This Ubc belongs to the class III Ubc proteins, characterized by an NH2-terminal extension followed by the “core” Ubc fold. However, electron density is absent for the residues in the NH2-terminal extension (1–29) and residues 176–179. To determine whether the absence of density is due to disorder or proteolytic degradation, mass spectrometric analysis was performed on a sample prepared from a dissolved crystal. The mass spectrometric analysis yielded results that are consistent with cleavage at residue Arg12 (data not shown). Therefore, the first 12 residues have been removed by proteolytic cleavage, whereas residues 13–29 and 176–179 are present but disordered.To determine whether or not the N-terminal extension is necessary for UbcH10 to accept ubiquitin, we prepared a mutant lacking most of the NH2-terminal extension (up to residue 27). The activity assay of this deletion mutant reveals that these residues are not important for ubiquitin-adduct formation (Fig.4). Moreover, substitution of the NH2-terminal sequence with that derived from the pET28 cloning construct also does not impede ubiquitin-adduct formation (Fig.4). The sequence of the NH2-terminal extension is fairly well conserved among mitotic E2, indicating some function, for example, interaction with the APC or other components of the network regulating mitotic destruction. Experiments to pursue these ideas are underway.FIG. 4Effect of selected mutations of UbcH10 on ubiquitin-adduct formation.A, sequences of varying NH2-terminal constructs tested for ubiquitin-adduct formation. To determine the effect of the NH2-terminal extension of UbcH10, a mutant form lacking much of the NH2-terminal extension without and with the removal of the His tag region (His-NΔ and NΔ, respectively) was compared with a His-tagged construct of wild-type UbcH10 (His-WT). The letters in bold represent residues that correspond to the UbcH10 sequence and the letters in normal type correspond to residues arising from cloning into the pET28 vector. The letters underlinedindicate the thrombin cleavage site. The residues “MAS” in the deletion mutants are present due to cloning into theNheI site of the contiguous NdeI-NheI sites in the vector. The correspondence of MAS to the first three residues of UbcH10 is coincidental. B, activity assay of the NH2-terminal deletion mutants and lysine 119 mutant. The activity assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” with biotinylated ubiquitin (bt-Ub) for an incubation time of 10 min. Biotinylated lysozyme (bt-Lys) was included in the reaction as a gel loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Oligomeric State of UbcH10An intriguing question still not answered satisfactorily concerns the oligomeric state of E2 proteins. This is an important question since the oligomeric state can have fundamental implications in the stereochemistry of the ubiquitination reaction. For example, the artificially induced dimerization of a E2–25K mutant produced by expressing as a glutathioneS-transferase fusion dramatically alters its activity (44Haldeman M.T. Xia G. Kasperek E.M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10526-10537Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Sometimes the same E2 protein, such as yeast Ubc4, has been reported to be a monomer as assessed by gel filtration chromatography (45Gwozd C.S. Arnason T.G. Cook W.J. Chau V. Ellison M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6296-6302Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and crystal packing analysis (16Cook W.J. Jeffrey L.C., Xu, Y. Chau V. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13809-13817Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) or as a dimer also by gel filtration chromatography (44Haldeman M.T. Xia G. Kasperek E.M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10526-10537Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and chemical cross-linking (45Gwozd C.S. Arnason T.G. Cook W.J. Chau V. Ellison M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6296-6302Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the case of UbcH10, analysis of the crystal packing reveals a rather large interaction surface that results in a total surface area of 1270 Å2 becoming solvent excluded. The interaction surface is formed by residues 36, 39, 40, 43, 44, 51, 53–57, 63, 65, 78, and 80. The presence of this large contact surface might suggest that the UbcH10 acts as a dimer. Moreover, a very similar interaction surface is seen in the crystal packing of the clam mitotic E2 protein, E2-C (21Jiang F. Basavappa R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6471-6478Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To determine the quarternary structure of UbcH10 in solution, analytical ultracentrifugation studies were performed at protein concentrations of 0.94, 0.5, and 0.11 mg/ml. The results indicate a molecular weight of 19,260 (data not shown), which corresponds very well to the theoretical molecular weight of 19,652. Since the intracellular concentration of UbcH10 certainly is less than 1 mg/ml, it is likely that UbcH10 functions as a monomer and that the significant interactions observed in the crystal lattices are not functionally important.Active Site EnvironmentThe active site residue (114) is next to the NH2 terminus of a 310 helix. Unlike most 310 helices, which are situated at the terminus of an α-helix (46Barlow D.J. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 601-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar), this 310 helix is entirely separate from any α-helix. This 310 helix is formed by residues 115–119 and has the sequence LDILK. The 310 helix and the identity of residues forming this helix are highly homologous among E2 proteins (21Jiang F. Basavappa R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6471-6478Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Why 310 helix formation in proteins is favored in certain instances instead of α-helices is not well understood. In isolation, the α-helix is less strained energetically than the 310 helix due to more favorable main chain hydrogen bonding geometry in the α-helix as well as slight steric hindrance of the side chains in the 310 helix. The presence of 310 helices in proteins might be explained in part by interactions of the side chains in the helix with the rest of the protein that would disfavor the α-helix and favor the 310helix. Such steric constraints are indicated in the case of the 310 helix in the E2 proteins. The 3 residue per turn geometry of the 310 helix places the charged residues Asp116 and Lys119 in-phase with each other, whereas the hydrophobic residues are oriented in different directions. In the context of the neighboring parts of the E2 structure, this allows the charged residues to be relatively solvent exposed and allows the hydrophobic residues to pack primarily against hydrophobic atoms (Fig. 5). If these residues instead were in an α-helical conformation, then these side chains would be in a much less favorable environment. The formation of the 310helix may have functional significance since it places the last residue of the helix (Lys119) in proximity to the active site residue (Fig. 5). The positive charge of the ε-amino group of this residue could be important for reducing the pKa of the active site cysteine to make it more reactive. To test whether this lysine residue indeed is important for ubiquitin-adduct formation, a mutant (K119A-UbcH10) was prepared in which this residue has been changed to an alanine. Ubiquitin-adduct formation assay with this mutant indicates greatly diminished activity when compared with wild-type. Therefore, lysine 119 seems to play an important role in the mechanism of ubiquitin-adduct formation in UbcH10. It is probable that this role is more electrostatic (as proposed above) than purely structural in nature since the lysine is highly solvent exposed and therefore mutation to an alanine would be unlikely to cause significant structural perturbation of the active site region.FIG. 5The 310 helix situated near the active site (divergent stereoview). The molecular surface was calculated using all residues except those in the 310 helix (residues 115–119). The residues forming the 310 helix are shown in ball-and-stick representation. The geometry of the 310 helix allows the hydrophobic residues in the helix to pack primarily against non-polar interior residues, whereas the hydrophilic residues are substantially solvent exposed. The polar residue Lys119 is seen to be proximal to the active site thiol (indicated by the dark patch). The smallinset α-carbon trace shows the overall perspective from which the main figure was made. The 310 helix and active site residue are indicated by thicker segments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In addition to the 310 helix, the active site is situated in the neighborhood of four β turns (Fig.6). These turns are important since they (together with the 310 helix) provide almost all the contacts with the active site residue. The only other residues contacting the active site residue are Leu138 and Ile113 (which is just NH2-terminal to the active site residue). Moreover, the residues in these turns give rise to much of the surface features surrounding the active site. In UbcH10, the turns are formed by residues 104–107 (turn A), 108–111 (turn B), 143–146 (turn C), and 147–150 (turn D). These turns are present in other known Ubc structures (Fig. 6). In all cases, turn A is nearly a canonical type I turn, turns with (φ, ψ) of residue i + 1 = ∼(−60,−30) and (φ, ψ) of r"

To investigate the specificity of FXa, we synthesized full sets of fluorescence-quenched substrates carrying all natural amino acids (except Cys) in P3, P2, P1′, P2′, and P3′ and determined the kcat /Km values of cleavage. Contrary to expectation, glycine was not the “best” P2 residue; peptide with phenylalanine was cleaved slightly faster. In fact, FXa had surprisingly limited preferences, barely more pronounced than trypsin; in P2, the ratio of the kcat /Km values for the most favorable side chain over the least was 289 (12 with trypsin), but in P1′, this ratio was only 30 (versus 80 with trypsin). This unexpected selectivity undoubtedly distinguished FXa from thrombin, which exhibited ratios higher than 19,000 in P2 and P1′. Thus, with respect to the catalytic groove, FXa resembles a low efficiency trypsin rather than the highly selective thrombin. The rates of cleavage of the peptidyl substrates were virtually identical whether or not FXa was in complex with factor Va, suggesting that the cofactor did not exert a direct allosteric control on the catalytic groove. We conclude that the remarkable efficacy of FXa within prothrombinase originates from exosite interaction(s) with factor Va and/or prothrombin rather than from the selectivity of its catalytic groove.

Without cofactors, activation of prothrombin by FXa is slow; it becomes efficient only when FXa complexes factor Va to form prothrombinase (6Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rapid inhibition of FXa by antithrombin also requires heparin as cofactor (7Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function and Biology. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1996Google Scholar). However, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) does not require any cofactor to rapidly neutralize FXa (8Baugh R.J. Broze G.J., Jr. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol.

In contrast to FXa, however, thrombin alone rapidly catalyzes a number of critical reactions in the cascade: cleavage of fibrinogen, activation of factors V and VIII, and activation of protease-activated receptor 1 (6Nesheim M.E.

Trypsin, the archetypal endopeptidase of the digestive tract, does not require cofactors to rapidly hydrolyze (in appropriate conditions) most peptide bonds that follow an arginine or a lysine. The notable specificity of the blood coagulation peptidases result from at least four molecular mechanisms: (i) constraints built up by subsites 3 to 3′ (S3 to S3′) 2The residues of the substrates are numbered from P6 to P6′, where P6 and P6′ refer to six residues remote from the cleavage site on the N- and C-terminal side, respectively.

In this paper, we report a comprehensive study of FXa subsites preferences using fluorescence-quenched substrates. We also compared FXa preferences with those of thrombin and trypsin. Some of the subsite preferences of FXa were unexpected, but the main surprise came from the overall limited selectivity of its catalytic groove. Addition of factor Va, phospholipid, and calcium had no detectable influence on FXa preferences or on its catalytic efficiency. Thus, we conclude that the remarkable efficacy of FXa within prothrombinase must rely on exosite(s) interaction(s) rather than on a purely allosteric mechanism involving its catalytic groove. Prothrombin was purified from human plasma and converted to thrombin as described previously (22Le Bonniec B.F. MacGillivray R.T.A. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13796-13803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine factor V/Va was from Kordia (Leiden, The Netherlands), and phospholipids vesicles were prepared by sonication of a 1 mg/ml mixture of phosphatidylcholine (80% w/w) with phosphatidylserine (20% w/w) (Sigma) as described previously (23Le Bonniec B.F. Guinto E.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6970-6976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human FX cDNA (24Messier T.L. Pittman D.D. Long G.L. Kaufman R.J. Church W.R.

The 3′ end primer also inserted in-frame with the C terminus of the FX cDNA a sequence coding for the epitope EEQKLISEEDLLGGY recognized by monoclonal antibody 9E10. The insert between the BamHI and XmaI sites of plasmid pNUT-hGH (22Le Bonniec B.F. MacGillivray R.T.A. Esmon C.T. J. Biol.

Transfection and selection of BHK-21 cells were achieved as described previously (22Le Bonniec B.F. MacGillivray R.T.A. Esmon C.T. J. Biol.

Production and purification of recombinant FX were also performed as described previously, except that c-Myc monoclonal antibody-agarose (CLONTECH, Saint Quentin, France) was used for the purification. Recombinant FX was eluted by 100 mmglycine-HCl, pH 2.7. The pH was immediately neutralized by adding 30 μl/ml of 2 m Tris, and FX was further purified (after dilution 1:4 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm EDTA) by anion exchange chromatography onto Q-Sepharose fast flow (Amersham Biosciences) developed with a linear gradient from 0.15 to 0.5 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Recombinant FX was converted to FXa essentially according to Jesty and Nemerson (26Jesty J. Nemerson Y. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) by incubation with the activator purified from the Russell's viper venom (RVV-X) purchased from Kordia. Briefly, RVV-X (5 mg/ml) in 200 mm NaHCO3, pH 8.3, containing 0.5m NaCl was coupled to a 5-ml HiTrap N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated column (AmershamBiosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. The column was sealed after loading with 4 mg of FX in 4 ml of kinetic buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.2% (w/v) poly(ethylene glycol); Mr = 6000), and the incubation was prolonged for 16 h at room temperature. The eluate, diluted 1:3 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 5 mmCaCl2, was loaded onto a 1-ml HiTrap heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl and 5 mm CaCl2. Recombinant FXa appeared pure by SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis and was indistinguishable from human FXa commercialized by Kordia with respect to its Km and kcat values for the hydrolysis of benzoyl-Ile-Glu(γ-OR)-Gly-Arg-pNA (S-2222, Biogenic, Maurin, France), Z-d-Arg-Gly-Arg-pNA (Biogenic), as well as the rate of prothrombin activation within prothrombinase. Recombinant and commercial FXa were nevertheless systematically compared in all experiments reported in this study and found virtually identical despite the C-terminal 9E10 epitope. The active site concentration of a stock trypsin solution (bovine, tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated; Worthington, Lorne Laboratories, Twyford, UK) was determined by titration with p- nitrophenyl-p′-guanidinobenzoate. This titrated trypsin was used to determine the precise concentration of aliquots in 1 mm HCl of d-Phe-Phe-Arg-CH2Cl andd-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl (Calbiochem, Meudon, France). Briefly, 200 nm trypsin in kinetic buffer was incubated for 3 h at room temperature with various amount of each chloromethyl ketone (0.03–3 μm). The reaction mixture was diluted 1:10 in kinetic buffer containing 100 μmS-2222, and the remaining enzyme concentration was estimated from the rate of A405 increase. The initial concentrations of chloromethyl ketone aliquots were deduced from the intercept to the x axis of a linear plot of the remaining activity versus the amount of inhibitor added. The active site concentrations of FXa (recombinant or human) and of thrombin were determined in the same buffer system and experimental conditions using the calibrated aliquots of chloromethyl ketone. For FXa titration, 1 μm enzyme according to the A280(extinction coefficient of 1.25 ml mg−1 cm−1) was incubated with 0.1–5 μm d-Phe-Phe-Arg-CH2Cl, and the remaining free enzyme concentration was measured with 100 μm S-2222 as substrate. For thrombin titration, 20 nm enzyme according to the A280 (extinction coefficient of 2.0 ml mg−1 cm−1) was incubated with 2–200 nm d-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl, and the remaining free enzyme concentration was measured with 100 μm H-d-Phe-pipecolyl-Arg-pNA (Biogenic). Just prior to use, FXa and trypsin dilutions were systematically controlled by measuring the rate of S-2222 hydrolysis, and thrombin dilutions were controlled by measuring the rate of H-d-Phe-pip-Arg-pNA hydrolysi s. Fluorescence-quenched substrates were prepared by the solid phase method via a Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)/t-butyl strategy, purified by reverse phase chromatography on a C18 column, and their purity was checked by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Tof-Spec-E, Micromass) as described previously (27Hirata I.Y. Cesari M.H.S. Nakaie C.R. Boschcov P. Ito A.S. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Lett. Peptide Sci. 1994; 1: 299-301Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). pNA substrates were prepared by the solution method following the procedure described in Alves et al. (28Alves L.C. Almeida P.C. Franzoni L. Juliano L. Juliano M.A. Peptide Res. 1996; 9: 92-96PubMed Google Scholar). Lyophilized substrates were resuspended in a minimum volume N, N-dimethylformamide, such that concentration in the stock solutions was about 5 mm, to ensure that during all kinetic experiments, the final amount of N, N-dimethylformamide never exceeded 0.5% (v/v). The concentration of the fluorescence-quenched substrates was estimated from their A360, assuming an absorption coefficient of 104 m −1cm−1. Determination of the kcat /Km values of hydrolysis was performed essentially as described previously (16Le Bonniec B.F. Myles T. Johnson T. Knight C.G. Tapparelli C. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7114-7122Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 29Marque P.E. Spuntarelli R. Juliano L. Aiach M. Le Bonniec B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 809-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Assuming that the reaction obeys a simple Michaelis-Menten mechanism with the encounter of enzyme and substrate limiting, when the reaction is performed at a substrate concentration below Km, the progress curve kinetic allows estimation of the kcat/Km of the reaction. Briefly, hydrolysis at 37 °C was monitored by measuring the fluorescence at λem = 414 nm (slit, 4 nm) and λex = 325 nm (slit, 10 nm) in a LS50B spectrofluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) equipped with a thermostatted microplate reader. A microplate containing 180 μl of substrate (1–8 μm) in kinetic buffer containing 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20 was left in the thermostatted compartment until the temperature equilibrium was attained (10–15 min), and the reaction was started by adding 20 μl of enzyme (0.1–200 nm). Care was taken to keep the ionic strength constant, in particular the NaCl concentration (30Lottenberg R. Hall J.A. Pautler E Zupan A. Christensen U. Jackson C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 874: 326-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 31Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10653-10656Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 32Underwood M.C. Zhong D. Mathur A. Heyduk T. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36876-36884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The increase in fluorescence with time was monitored for up to 4 h (until at least 75% completion of the reaction). The pseudo-first order rate constant (k), the initial fluorescence (Io), and the maximum fluorescence intensity (Imax) were estimated by nonlinear curve fitting analysis of the fluorescence intensity (INT) dependence on time (t) using the following equation.INT=Io+Imax(1−exp−E k t)Equation 1 where E is the enzyme concentration. The values of Io and Imax estimated through the nonlinear curve fitting analysis were always consistent with the fluorescence intensities measured before and after 1 h of incubation of the substrate with 0.1 μm trypsin (corresponding to the intact and fully cleaved peptide, respectively). The apparent rate constant will be pseudo-first order and will equal kcat /Km, provided that the initial substrate concentration is much less than its Km value for the enzyme. To assess whether this condition was met, progress curve kinetics were systematically performed at two initial concentrations of fluorescence-quenched substrates. the results indicated that with all of the substrates assayed k was, within the experimental error, identical at the two substrate concentrations. Thus, in this concentration range, the rate of hydrolysis was not dependent upon the amount of substrate, suggesting that k could be equated to the kcat /Km value. When substrates carried several potential cleavage sites, the preferred bond of hydrolysis was determined after purification of the products by reverse phase chromatography. Kinetics were performed in conditions identical to those used for the fluorescence studies except that the reactions were quenched at timed intervals by adding H3PO4 (1% w/v). The aliquots were loaded on a 250 × 4.6 mm Vydac 218TP54 column (Interchim, Asnières, France) developed with a 10–80% linear gradient acetonitrile in 0.5% (w/v) H3PO4. The peaks were identified by monitoring the A254 and A360 and were quantified by integration analysis; their identity was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. Estimation of the rate constant for formation of each product was obtained by data analysis using Equation 1, in which the initial, sampling time, and final A360 (or A254), was substituted for Io, INT, and Imax, respectively. Kinetics of pNA substrate hydrolysis by FXa (100 nm) were performed in a microplate at 25 °C and monitored by measuring the A405 in a model MR 5000 reader (Dynex, Guyancourt, France). The concentrations of the pNA substrates (10 and 20 μm) were adjusted according to their A316, assuming an absorption coefficient of 12,700 m −1 cm−1. The data were analyzed using Equation 1 in which the A405 values (initial, at time t, and final) were substituted for Io, INT, and Imax, respectively. With all of the pNA substrates examined, the apparent rate constants of cleavage obtained at 10 and 20 μm substrate were indistinguishable. Thus, the Km for FXa was likely higher than 200 μm, allowing the pseudo-first order rate constant to be equated to kcat /Km. The values reported represent the weighted means of at least three determinations. To investigate the catalytic groove preferences of FXa, we synthesized five series of fluorescence-quenched substrates, having a common 10-amino acid-long framework (ABz-VQFRSLGDQ-EDDnp). The peptides carried a strongly fluorescent ABz group at the N-terminal end, but a C-terminal EDDnp quenched this fluorescence by resonance energy transfer. The kcat /Km value for the cleavage of each peptide by FXa was estimated by analysis of the increase of the fluorescence intensity upon hydrolysis. In each series of peptides, either the P3, P2, P1′, P2′, or P3′ amino acid was varied, such that complete sets of peptides were prepared covering all natural amino acids (except cysteine). Proline in P1′ was also avoided because it is known to prohibit trypsin cleavage. Study of the P2 preferences of FXa revealed that, contrary to expectation, glycine was not the most favorable amino acid; the peptide having a phenylalanine residue in P2 was cleaved slightly faster than the one with a glycine (Table I). Overall, substrates with aromatic side chains in P2 were cleaved efficiently, whereas the least favorable amino acid was aspartate. The FXa cleavage sites in prothrombin and factor VII have glycine in P2. In fact, a number of studies have established that FXa prefers Gly over Phe in P2 position with chromogenic or fluorogenic substrates (30Lottenberg R. Hall J.A. Pautler E Zupan A. Christensen U.

Furthermore, x-ray analysis suggests that Tyr99(in the chymotrypsinogen numbering system) 3Amino acid sequence numbering of FXa (and all of the proteases mentioned in this study) is based on the three-dimensional topological identity with chymotrypsin (2Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Tulinsky A. Park C.H. Bode W. Huber R. Blankenship D.T. Cardin A.D. Kisiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 947-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 5Rawlings N.D Barrett A.J.

Thus, it was quite surprising that bulky side chains (phenylalanine and tryptophan) could be as efficient as glycine in our study. The discrepancy could originate from the influence of the P3/P4 apolard-amino acid present in the substrates used in most previous studies on FXa specificity. Binding of a P3/P4 d-amino acid is highly favorable and clearly improves the catalytic efficiency of FXa (30Lottenberg R. Hall J.A. Pautler E Zupan A. Christensen U. Jackson C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 874: 326-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that binding of a d-side chain in S3/S4 distorts the neighboring S2, hence prohibiting the binding of a bulky P2 side chain. On the other hand, as opposed to small P4–P1peptidyl substrates, our fluorescence-quenched substrates bind to subsites on both sides of the scissile bond. Thus, the observed specificity could also result from cooperative effects that would influence the P2 preferences of FXa. To investigate such possible cooperative effects, we synthesized a series of chromogenic substrates (acetyl-VQ XR-pNA, where X was F, T, G, or P). However, analysis of the progress curves of cleavage confirmed that, when constituted exclusively byl-amino acids, a chromogenic substrate having phenylalanine in P2 is hydrolyzed slightly faster than its counterpart with glycine (4.1 ± 0.2 versus 3.4 ± 0.2 × 104 m −1 s−1). Another possibility is that binding provides the necessary energy to move the aromatic ring system of FXa (Phe174, Tyr99, and Trp215), perhaps by a simple rotation of Tyr99toward S3/S4, as is observed in kallikrein and factor IXa (2Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Tulinsky A. Park C.H. Bode W. Huber R. Blankenship D.T. Cardin A.D. Kisiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 947-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 3Brandstetter H. Kuhne A.

Bode W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6626-6635Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Such movement would be prohibited when ad-amino acid side chain occupies S3/S4. In support of this hypothesis, FXa selects sequences with phenylalanine or tyrosine in P2 (in addition to those having glycine) when offered a library of fusion proteins displayed on phages as substrates (40Matthews D.J. Wells J.A. Science. 1993; 260: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) or a library of combinatorial fluorogenic substrates (41Harris J.L. Backes B.J. Leonetti F. Mahrus S. Ellman J.A.

In addition, binding of TFPI evidently requires that Tyr99 of FXa swing away from the “normal” S2 (42Burgering M.J.M. Orbons L.P.M. van der Doelen A. Mulders J. Theunissen H.J.M. Grootenhuis P.J.M.

Opening of these voltage-dependent K+ channels results in membrane repolarization, leading to the closure of the Ca2+channels and cessation of insulin secretion in neuroendocrine islet β cells. Using patch clamp techniques, we have demonstrated that the activity of the KDR channel subtype, KV1.1, identified by its specific blocker dendrodotoxin-K, is inhibited by SNAP-25 in insulinoma HIT-T15 β cells. A co-precipitation study of rat brain confirmed that SNAP-25 interacts with the KV1.1 protein. Cleavage of SNAP-25 by expression of botulinum neurotoxin A in HIT-T15 cells relieved this SNAP-25-mediated inhibition of KDR. This inhibitory effect of SNAP-25 is mediated by the N terminus of KV1.1, likely by direct interactions with KVα1.1 and/or KVβ subunits, as revealed by co-immunoprecipitation performed in the Xenopus oocyte expression system and in vitro binding. Taken together we have concluded that SNAP-25 mediates secretion not only through its participation in the exocytotic SNARE complex but also by regulating membrane potential and calcium entry through its interaction with KDR channels.

In islet β cells, glucose-mediated Ca2+-evoked insulin secretion is initiated by the closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, which in turn causes membrane depolarization and the resultant opening of L-type Ca2+ channels (1Rorsman P. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The cessation of insulin secretion is brought about by the closure of these Ca2+ channels by membrane repolarization, which is primarily effected by the opening of a voltage-dependent K+ channels (KV) 1The abbreviations used are: KVvoltage-dependent K+ channelsKDRdelayed rectifier K+ channelsSNAP-25synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDat-SNAREtarget-SNAP receptorv-SNAREvesicle-SNAP receptorGSTglutathione S-transferaseBoNT/Abotulinum neurotoxin ATEAtetraethylammoniumDTX-Kdendrotoxin-KGFPgreen fluorescent protein1The abbreviations used are: KVvoltage-dependent K+ channelsKDRdelayed rectifier K+ channelsSNAP-25synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDat-SNAREtarget-SNAP receptorv-SNAREvesicle-SNAP receptorGSTglutathione S-transferaseBoNT/Abotulinum neurotoxin ATEAtetraethylammoniumDTX-Kdendrotoxin-KGFPgreen fluorescent protein of the delayed rectifier subtype (KDR) (2Dukes I.D.

In neurons, the short duration of action potentials regulates rapidly activating and inactivating N-type Ca2+ channels, resulting in ultrashort (μs) Ca2+ fluxes acting on docked synaptic vesicles (3Chow R.H. Klingauf J. Neher E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12765-12769Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In contrast to neurons that have a higher proportion of readily releasable docked vesicles (∼10%), less than 5% of insulin-containing secretory granules in islet β cells are morphologically docked, with the vast majority of insulin granules located more distantly from the membrane within a reserve pool (4Renstrom E. Eliasson L. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 502: 105-118Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar). A more sustained Ca2+ influx effected by a much longer train of action potentials would be necessary to reach and mobilize this reserve pool of insulin granules to the plasma membrane and then to effect their exocytosis (3Chow R.H. Klingauf J. Neher E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12765-12769Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 4Renstrom E. Eliasson L. Rorsman P. J. Physiol.

Neuron. 1999; 23: 607-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In the islet β cell, since this glucose-sensitive sustained phase of insulin secretion is regulated by the KDR channel, it would be an ideal drug target for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent or type 2 diabetes. In particular, drugs that interfere selectively with it would be superior to the current treatment with sulfonylureas that act on β cell KATP channels in a glucose-independent manner, often resulting in deleterious side effects such as hypoglycemia (6Bressler R. Johnson D.G. Arch. Intern. Med. 1997; 157: 836-848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Here we show that SNAP-25 interacts with insulinoma HIT-T15 cell KDR, specifically via the Kvα1.1 subunit. Overexpression of SNAP-25 or exogenously applied recombinant SNAP-25 protein inhibits HIT cell KDR activity. Cleavage of SNAP-25 by botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) light chain expression relieves the actions of endogenous and exogenous SNAP-25 on KDR. Furthermore, the N-terminal domain but not C-terminal domain of KV1.1 competitively reversed the effect of SNAP-25. This work demonstrates that SNAP-25 modulates secretion not only by its involvement in membrane fusion but also by its interaction with KDR channels. HIT-T15 cells (a gift from P. Robertson, Seattle, WA) were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20 mm glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). These cells were then transfected with plasmids (pcDNA3) containing cDNAs of full-length SNAP-25 or BoNT/A light chain (a gift from H. Niemann, Hanover, Germany) exactly as we report (22Huang X. Wheeler M.B. Kang Y.H. Sheu L. Lukacs G.L. Trimble W.S. Gaisano H.Y. Mol.

To determine the levels of Kv1.1 and SNARE proteins, these transfected HIT cells were further subjected to subcellular fractionation (i.e. whole-cell lysate and plasma membrane). The HIT-T15 cells were dislodged from the plates with trypsin and then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline after alternate centrifugation (2000 rpm, 5 min). The resulting pellet was resuspended in a homogenization buffer (in mm: 150 NaCl, 20 Tris-HCl, 1 EDTA, 1 EGTA, and protein inhibitors) and homogenized using a sonicator. Large debris and nuclear fragments were removed by low centrifugation (2000 rpm for 5 min, IEC-8R centrifuge) at 4 °C, and the resulting pellet was resuspended and subjected to ultracentrifugation (50,000 rpm for 1 h, TL-100 ultracentrifuge). The pellet was then suspended in SDS-loading buffer and centrifuged at 2000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min, and the supernatant containing the purified plasma membrane fraction was collected. Protein concentrations of the whole-cell lysate and plasma membrane fractions were determined by a modified Lowry method. About 15 μg of protein from cell lysate and 70 μg of protein from membrane preparation were separated on an 8 or 14% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and the blots were then identified with specific primary antibodies against SNAP-25 (1:1000) (22Huang X.

LP1 protein (350–600 μg) was incubated in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100 containing a mixture of protease inhibitors) to a concentration of >1 mg/ml in ice for 10 min, and then 1 μg of affinity-purified antibody (SNAP-25) was added. This mixture was then agitated overnight at 4 °C followed by the addition of 50–100 μl of 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose and further agitated for 4 h. The Sepharose beads were then spun-down, washed 4 times with ice-cold lysis buffer, solubilized in sample buffer, and heated at 80 °C for 3 min.

After washing, the GST fusion proteins were eluted with 15 mm reduced glutathione in 40 μl of elution buffer (120 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. DNAs of Kv1.1 and Kvβ1.1 fragments to create GST fusion proteins have been previously described (27Jing J. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Thornhill W.B. Reuveny E. Lotan I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously transfected GFP-positive HIT cells (passage 65–75) were studied with standard whole-cell and cell-attached patch clamp techniques (29Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15140) Google Scholar) as we have previously described (30Salapatek A.M.F. MacDonald P. Gaisano H.Y. Wheeler M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1305-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The standard pipette solution contained the following (in mm) except where noted in the text: 140 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 4 Na2ATP, 0.3 EGTA, and 8 nm CaCl2, pH 7.2. The external solution contained (in mm): 140 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. Axopatch 1D and 200B patch clamp amplifiers were used together with pCLAMP software (v.6.0, Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) to record channel currents. Currents were typically elicited from a holding potential of −70 mV. Data were presented as mean ± S.E. and compared by Student's t test for single comparisons and by analysis of variance for multiple comparisons. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Single-channel recording and analyses were performed in the cell-attached configuration in which HIT-T15 cells were bathed in the internal solution (high K+) and pipettes contained a normal external solution. Test pulses of 30s from −70 to −10 mV were applied every 3 min. Analog signals were filtered at 2 kHz using a Bessel filter. Single channel data were analyzed using Fetchan and pSTAT software (pCLAMP 6.0, Axon Instruments). Recombinant proteins including GST-SNAP-25, GSTα T1A, GSTα T1B, GST-KV1.11–168, and GST-KV1.1411–495 were generated as previously described (27Jing J. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Thornhill W.B.

A single voltage step to +30 mV from a holding potential of −70 mV was used to assess the effects of these test proteins on KDR. To determine whether the KDR in HIT-T15 (HIT) cells are similar to those reported in islet β cells (2Dukes I.D. Philipson L.H. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 845-853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Bokvist K.

Physiol. 1990; 95: 1041-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we functionally and molecularly characterized this channel protein. Like islet β cell KDR (2Dukes I.D. Philipson L.H. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 845-853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Smith P.A. Bokvist K. Arkhammar P. Berggren P.O. Rorsman P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 1041-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), HIT cell KDRpossesses several similar functional properties (Fig. 1 A). These properties include K+ ion selectivity, as demonstrated by an inhibitory effect of Cs+ ion, when intracellular KCl was replaced with CsCl (Fig. 1 A, CsCl), a low threshold of activation (−30 mV), and slow inactivation (>250 ms, shown in Fig. 1 A, inset, and graphic summary). Characteristic of KDR, the HIT cell KDR was inhibited by high doses of the semi-selective K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium (20 mm TEA in Fig. 1 A, inset), which caused ∼85% reduction (p < 0.05) in the outward current at +30 mV (31Bokvist K. Rorsman P. Smith P.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 423: 311-325Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Because large conductance Ca2+-sensitve K+ currents (KCa) also contributes to the outward currents in islet β cells (32Smith P.A. Bokvist K. Arkhammar P. Berggren P.O. Rorsman P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 1041-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we determined the contribution of this channel to total outward currents. Like others (31Bokvist K. Rorsman P. Smith P.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 423: 311-325Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we also found that KCa contributed little to the HIT cell outward currents, as evidenced by (a) insensitivity to low intracellular Ca2+ concentrations (with 8 nm Ca2+, <8% reduction in outward currents, data not shown) or the Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine (Fig. 1 A), (b) insensitivity to low doses of TEA (<10% reduction at 1 mm TEA, not shown), or (c) inhibition by 100 nm iberiotoxin, a specific large conductance KCa blocker (Fig. 1 A, iberiotoxin (IbTX)). Nonetheless, to negate even this small contribution of KCa to the outward currents, all pipette solutions contained low Ca2+ concentration (<8 nm). We and others previously showed that in pancreatic islets and insulinoma cell lines including HIT cells, SNAP-25 expression is required for insulin secretion (22Huang X. Wheeler M.B. Kang Y.H.

Furthermore, t-SNARE proteins syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 can also directly interact with membrane ion channels involved in regulating the secretory process (15Wiser O. Trus M. Hernandez A. Renstrom E.

To determine whether SNAP-25 can modulate KDR channels, we overexpressed SNAP-25 in HIT cells (Figs.1 B, 2 B, and 3 B). We already reported that overexpressed SNAP-25 proteins are appropriately targeted to the plasma membrane (22Huang X. Wheeler M.B. Kang Y.H. Sheu L. Lukacs G.L. Trimble W.S. Gaisano H.Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1060-1070PubMed Google Scholar), which would allow for their interaction with membrane-spanning ion channel proteins such as KV1.1. SNAP-25- or BoNT/A-transfected cells were identified by their expression of co-transfected GFP (22Huang X. Wheeler M.B. Kang Y.H. Sheu L. Lukacs G.L. Trimble W.S. Gaisano H.Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1060-1070PubMed Google Scholar). All control cell studies were performed on cells transfected with GFP alone, and neither KDR activity (data not shown) nor insulin secretion was altered by GFP transfection (22Huang X. Wheeler M.B. Kang Y.H. Sheu L. Lukacs G.L. Trimble W.S. Gaisano H.Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1060-1070PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 3SNAP-25 regulation of single KDR channels. A (left), single channel KDR currents were recorded from membrane patches of control HIT cells in the cell-attached configuration. Currents were evoked in response to a random series of test pulses between –40 and +20 mV in 20-mV steps from a holding potential of –70 mV. Each test pulse lasted for 30s, with an interpulse interval greater than 3 min. A(right), current-voltage relationship obtained from single channel studies in which a mean single channel conductance of 10 picosiemens was calculated from the slope of line best-fitted to the data (n = 5). B, five representative single channel KDR currents recorded from cell-attached patches of control cells or cells overexpressing SNAP-25 or BoNT/A under the same experimental conditions described in Fig. 1 B. Currents were evoked from transfected cells during a pulse from a holding potential of –70 to –10 mV recorded for 330 ms. C, amplitude histograms for each of these transfections were calculated. SNAP-25 overexpression greatly reduced the number of KDR channel openings over control cells. Conversely, cleavage of SNAP-25 by BoNT/A expression enhanced the number of KDR openings over both control and SNAP-25-transfected cells. KDR channel currents measured at −10 mV were the same magnitude for all transfections (ranging from 0.47 to 0.51 pA), suggesting that channel conductance was not changed. There was no change in KDR channel conductance with any transfection (data not shown). D, frequency versus lifetime histogram of channel openings. A total of greater than 1550 events were analyzed for each of the transfection and the open time distribution fitted to a single exponential with a time constant (τ). SNAP-25 (n = 5) shortened the duration of the KDR open time, whereas cleavage of SNAP-25 by expressed BoNT/A (n = 5) significantly increased the mean channel open time when compared with the mean KDRchannel open time recorded from control cells (n = 5) (p < 0.05 against control cells for all test cells).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 1 B shows representative whole-cell KDRcurrent traces after transfection and a graphical summary of the peak currents, which have been normalized by cell membrane capacitance for minimizing variations in cell size. Transfection of HIT cells with SNAP-25 resulted in a 3-fold increase in SNAP-25 expression in total HIT lysates (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). Transfection efficiency as determined by the frequency of GFP-positive cells is consistently ∼40%. With this transfection efficiency of ∼40%, the transfected cells studied by patch clamp would be estimated to contain about a 5–6-fold increase in SNAP-25 compared with endogenous levels. In cells overexpressing SNAP-25, the peak KDR current (86.9 ± 6.2 pA/picofarads, n = 18, p < 0.05) was inhibited at +30 mV by 22% compared with control cells (111.3 ± 7.9 pA/picofarads, n = 16) (Fig. 1 B). We reasoned that if SNAP-25 genuinely acts to inhibit KDR, then BoNT/A cleavage of SNAP-25 should enhance KDR currents. We therefore overexpressed BoNT/A light chain in HIT cells. BoNT/A expression reduced endogenous SNAP-25 levels of HIT lysates to ∼10% of control levels (Fig. 2 A, lane 4). Therefore, in cells expressing BoNT/A, it can be assumed that all endogenous SNAP-25 would be cleaved (22Huang X. Wheeler M.B. Kang Y.H. Sheu L. Lukacs G.L. Trimble W.S. Gaisano H.Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1060-1070PubMed Google Scholar). KDR currents in these BoNT/A-expressing cells were augmented at +30 mV by 22% (135.4 ± 8.9 pA/picofarads,n = 14, p < 0.05) compared with control cells (Fig. 1 B). Indeed, these effects of BoNT/A are opposite to the effects of SNAP-25 overexpression, which would therefore suggest that BoNT/A cleavage of SNAP-25 removes the inhibitory actions of full-length SNAP-25. BoNT/A cleavage of SNAP-25 also revealed a smaller band (Fig. 2 A, lower unfilled arrowhead of the arrowhead doublets to the right of lanes 4 and 7), which is likely the SNAP-25 cleavage product representing amino acids 1–197 (22Huang X.

To identify the KDR subtype upon which SNAP-25 acted, we first applied dendrotoxin (DTX), which blocks Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 channels, and subsequently applied dendrotoxin-K (DTX-K), which more specifically blocks only Kv1.1 channels. We found that both toxins exhibited identical effects, and therefore, we show only the more specific DTX-K results in Fig. 1 C. DTX-K (300 nm) application had no significant additional effects in SNAP-25-expressing cells compared with controls in which there was a 33% drop in KDR current (p < 0.05). Thus, the KDR subtype upon which SNAP-25 acted was Kv1.1. We confirmed the presence of the KV1.1 channel protein in HIT cell lysates as shown in Fig. 2 A in lane 2(HIT Cell lysate, Control). This KV1.1 antibody (Alomone Labs) has been depleted of antibodies that reacted with closely related KV isoforms. KV1.1 was previously identified in HIT cells (35Betsholtz C. Baumann A. Kenna S.

Diabetes. 1996; 45: 845-853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, HIT-T15 does not express the closely related KV1.2 channel protein, as confirmed by us at the protein (by anti-KV1.2 antibody, Alomone Labs) and mRNA (by reverse transcription-PCR) levels (36MacDonald P.E. Ha X.F. Smukler S.R. Sun A, M. Gaisano H.Y. Salapatek A.M. Backx P.H. Wheeler M.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1423-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).

Subcellular localization of CacyBP was examined in neurons and neuroblastoma NB-2a cells at different [Ca2+]i. Immunostaining indicates that CacyBP is present in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cultured neurons in which resting [Ca2+]i is known to be ∼50 nm. When [Ca2+]i was increased to above 300 nm by KCl treatment, the immunostaining was mainly apparent as a ring around the nucleus. Such perinuclear localization of CacyBP was observed in untreated neuroblastoma NB-2a cells in which [Ca2+]i is ∼120 nm. An additional increase in [Ca2+]i to above 300 nm by thapsigargin treatment did not change CacyBP localization. However, when [Ca2+]i in NB-2a cells dropped to 70 nm, because of BAPTA/AM treatment, perinuclear localization was diminished. Ca2+-induced translocation of CacyBP was confirmed by immunogold electron microscopy and by fluorescence of NB-2a cells transfected with an EGFP-CacyBP vector. Recombinant CacyBP can be phosphorylated by protein kinase C in vitro. In untreated neuroblastoma NB-2a cells, CacyBP is phosphorylated on a serine residue(s), but exists in the dephosphorylated form in BAPTA/AM-treated cells. Thus, phosphorylation of CacyBP occurs in the same [Ca2+]i range that leads to its perinuclear translocation.

Calcyclin (S100A6) is a calcium-binding protein of the EF-hand type belonging to the S100 family (1Kuźnicki J. Celio M.R. Guidebook to the Calcium Binding Proteins.

As in the case of the prototypical EF-hand protein calmodulin, S100 proteins act as calcium sensors and modulate activity of enzymes or other target proteins (4Heizmann C.W. Cox A.J.

Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The recombinant CacyBP interacts with calcyclin in vitro at micromolar Ca2+ concentrations indicating that this interaction may indeed occur physiologically. The region of CacyBP (amino acids 178–229), which binds calcyclin, has been identified, and the dissociation constant of the complex has been measured (16Nowotny M. Bhattacharya S. Filipek A.

Northern and Western blots have shown that CacyBP is expressed at the highest level in the mouse and rat brain, and immunohistochemistry performed on rat brain slices revealed that CacyBP is mainly present in neurons of the cerebellum, hippocampus, and cortex (17Jastrzebska B.

Two independent reports showed that the level of CacyBP is increased upon erythropoietin receptor activation (18Xia Z.B. Dai M.S. Magoulas C. Broxmeyer H.E. Lu L. J. Hematother. Stem Cell Res. 2000; 9: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Pircher T.J. Geiger J.N. Miller C.P. Zhang D. Gaines P. Wojchowski D.M. J. Biol.

These observations suggest that CacyBP might be involved in a signaling pathway(s) activated by erythropoietin in erythroid cells and in neuronal cells in which a high level of erythropoietin receptor was also found. Recently, a protein called SIP (siah-1 interacting protein), a component of the β-catenin degradation pathway, has been reported (20Matsuzawa S. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The predicted human SIP protein shows 93% sequence identity with mouse CacyBP suggesting that it is the human homolog of CacyBP. Because Ca2+-dependent phenomena related to the activity of the ubiquitin/26 S proteasome complex were described (21Kawahara H. Yokosawa H. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), interaction of CacyBP with an EF-hand calcium-binding protein raises the possibility that CacyBP may function via Ca2+-dependent interactions in ubiquitination and the protein degradation process. Therefore, in this work we have studied the intracellular localization of CacyBP under different [Ca2+]i, using primary cultures of rat cortical neurons and cultured neuroblastoma NB-2a cells. Using both immunostaining and transfection of NB-2a cells with an EGFP-CacyBP vector, we have shown that cellular localization of CacyBP is modulated by changes in [Ca2+]i. We also found that phosphorylation of this protein on a serine residue(s) occurs within the same range of [Ca2+]i as that which stimulates its perinuclear translocation. MEM, RPMI 1640, newborn calf serum, fetal bovine serum, horse serum, trypsin/EDTA (1× solution), penicillin, and streptomycin were purchased from Invitrogen; leupeptin, aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, soybean trypsin inhibitor, dithiothreitol, thapsigargin, bovine serum albumin, DABCO (1,4-diazobicylo-[2,2,2,]-octane, 4-chloro-1-naphthol), anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to colloidal gold, glutaraldehyde, and paraformaldehyde were purchased from Sigma; restriction enzymes were from Promega. Other chemicals used were purchased from companies as indicated in the text. Cortical neurons were prepared from newborn Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats and cultured at a density of 1500–2000 cells/mm2 in basal medium Eagle supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated bovine calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). Cytosine arabinoside (2.5 μm) was added on the second day after seeding to inhibit the proliferation of non-neuronal cells. KCl treatment of rat cortical neurons was performed on cells cultured for 5–6 days. Neurons were incubated for 10 min with KCl, which was added to the medium to a final concentration of 30 mm. After that time cells were fixed and prepared for immunocytochemistry. In other experiments cells treated with KCl as above were incubated in the medium without KCl for 2 h and then fixed and used for immunocytochemistry. Mouse neuroblastoma cells NB-2a were maintained in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mmbicarbonate, penicillin (100 μg/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). PC12 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). All cultures were maintained in the presence of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The media were changed every 3 days and cells were passaged when confluent. To prepare the protein extracts for Western blot analysis, cells were harvested and washed twice with PBS. The cells were homogenized mechanically using a syringe with a needle (26-gauge; 0.45 × 12) 20× in PBS containing 1 mm EDTA and the following protease inhibitors: leupeptin (10 mg/liter), aprotinin (5 mg/liter), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20 mg/liter), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm). The extracts were centrifuged for 45 min at 4 °C at 12,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge. Protein concentration was estimated by the Bradford procedure (BioRad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. PCR was carried out with CacyBP cDNA in pBluescript vector (16Nowotny M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 31178-311822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) as a template with the forward primer, 5′-GGATCGGATCC ATGGCTTCCGTTTTGGAAGAG-3′ and the reverse primer, 5′-GAGACGAATTC TCATCAAAATTCCGTGTCTTC-3′ (restriction enzyme recognition sites in bold). Pfu DNA polymerase was used in 30 cycles of PCR with each cycle consisting of 1 min at 94 °C; 1 min at 50 °C; and 2 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzymes, purified and ligated with pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH), and linearized with BglII and EcoRI restriction enzymes. The ligation reaction mixture was used to transform Escherichia coli cells (TOP10F′, Invitrogen). Potential clones were screened by colony PCR, and the presence of the insert was confirmed by restriction analysis. The sequence of the insert was verified by automated DNA sequencing. Two constructs were used for transfection experiments: one encoding the EGFP-CacyBP fusion protein and a second encoding only EGFP. Both genes were under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Plasmids were purified from E. coli using a Qiagen Plasmid Kit MIDI according to the manufacturer's protocol. DNA transfection in NB-2a cells was performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique according to standard procedures (22Ausubel, F. M, Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1992) in Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). Cells grown on coverslips were exposed for 16 h to 2 μg of plasmid DNA per coverslip. Neuroblastoma NB-2a cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and cultured for 2 days in MEM at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were washed twice for 5 min in PBS and incubated with 0.2 μm thapsigargin dissolved in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mmNa2HPO4, 25 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm CaCl2 for 2 min at room temperature or with 5 μm BAPTA/AM and 1 mm EGTA for 30 min at 30 °C. Cells treated with BAPTA/AM were then washed two times and incubated in the buffer described above containing 1 mmEGTA for 30 min at 30 °C. Cells transfected with CacyBP-EGFP were treated in the same way with thapsigargin or BAPTA/AM, and EGFP fluorescence was analyzed under a Nikon Optiphot-2 microscope. The cytoplasmic level of Ca2+ was examined in neuroblastoma NB-2a cells (untreated or treated with thapsigargin or BAPTA/AM) using a video imaging system (MagiCal, Applied Imaging, data processing using Tardis V8.0 (Joyce Loebl)) as described by Barańska et al. (23Barańska J. Chaban V. Czarny M. Sabała P. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). [Ca2+]i values were calculated according to Grynkiewicz et al. (24Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 60: 3440-3450Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry experiments were performed on neurons (unstimulated or stimulated with KCl) and neuroblastoma NB-2a cells (untreated or treated with thapsigargin or BAPTA/AM). Neurons were plated onto laminin-coated coverslips whereas neuroblastoma NB-2a cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for 20 min at room temperature. The coverslips were washed with PBS, incubated with 50 mmNH4Cl in PBS for 10 min to quench the remaining aldehyde groups (25Reggio H. Webster P. Louvard D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 379-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and permeabilized for 4 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The cells were washed twice with PBS, incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h, and after that incubated with anti-CacyBP antibodies (1:800). After washing (three times for 10 min in PBS), cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (1:200) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) and mounted on glass slides with a mixture of glycerol and polyvinyl alcohol containing DABCO (1,4-diazobicylo-[2,2,2,]-octane). For control experiments cells were incubated with preimmune serum. Cells were analyzed under a Nikon Optiphot-2 microscope. Digitalized images of cells were analyzed with Quantity One software (BioRad). In each cell, three lines of 3 pixels in width were drawn across the center of the cell at a constant distance of 0.5 μm from each other (see also Fig. 1, D–F), and line intensity profiles of CacyBP labeling were collected. The fluorescence intensity values were within a linear range. Next, the fluorescence intensities in the perinuclear region (In) and in the cytoplasm (Ic) at a constant distance from the perinuclear region (2.7 μm) were determined. This distance was chosen because at this point a maximal decrease in fluorescence intensity in the cytoplasm was observed. The ratio In/Ic was calculated to express the changes in CacyBP concentration in the perinuclear region. At least 10 cells from two independent experiments were analyzed in each variant. Neuroblastoma NB-2a cells were fixed for 1 h at room temperature in 3% paraformaldehyde, 0.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS buffer (26Wang L.J. Colella R. Roisen F.J. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1998; 105: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Then the cells were rinsed in PBS four times (5 min each) followed by centrifugation for 5 min (350 × g). Cells were dehydrated in ethanol and propylene oxide, embedded in LR White (Polyscience) and polymerized for 72 h at 56 °C. After thin sectioning, samples were collected on the carbon-formavar–coated nickel grids and incubated for 30 min in 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween/PBS as a nonspecific blocking agent and labeled with antibodies against CacyBP (1:250) overnight at room temperature. After washing with 1% bovine serum albumin/0.1% Tween/PBS, the cells were incubated in anti-rabbit IgG (1:20) conjugated to colloidal gold (5 nm) for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing (bovine serum albumin/Tween/PBS: 6× 5 min, PBS: 4× 5 min, H2O: 2× 5 min), sections were stained with uranyl acetate for 30 min at room temperature. The sections were observed in a JEM 1200 EX electron microscope. Phosphorylation of CacyBP in vitro was performed on purified, recombinant protein expressed in E. coli (16Nowotny M. Bhattacharya S. Filipek A. Krezel A.M. Chazin W. Kuźnicki J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31178-311822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture for phosphorylation by protein kinase C (final volume, 50 μl) contained 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.05 mm CaCl2, 0.7 μg/μl α-l-phosphatidyl-l-serine, 80 nmPMA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 70 ng of kinase preparation (Calbiochem), and 0.1 mm ATP. Preincubation was carried out for 20 min at 30 °C. After that the reaction was initiated by addition of the substrate (∼2 μg of CacyBP) and [γ−32P]ATP at a final concentation of 0.2 mm. The reaction was carried out for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixture for protein kinase A (catalytic subunit from Sigma) contained 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, and 300 ng of kinase preparation. In this case preincubation and reaction were carried out for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 4× SDS sample buffer. Phosphorylated proteins were separated on 15% (w/v) SDS gels. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography for 18–34 h with an Amersham Biosciences film at −70 °C. Autophosphorylation of kinase preparations was performed as described above but without adding the substrate. Phosphorylation of CacyBP in NB-2a cells was examined in untreated or BAPTA/AM-treated NB-2a cells. Cells were washed in PBS and harvested and sonicated (Branson ultrasonicator) in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 8 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40. Extracts were centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C at 12,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge. Supernatants were used for the immunoprecipitation assay after adding the protease inhibitors (10 mg/liter leupeptin, 5 mg/liter aprotinin, 20 mg/liter soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and phosphatase inhibitors (0.3 mm okadaic acid, 200 μm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF). First, the solutions were incubated with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C (preclearance). The unbound fractions were incubated with serum-containing antibodies against CacyBP for 1.5 h at 4 °C and then for 1 h at 4o with a new portion of protein A-Sepharose. The resin was washed three times in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and 150 mm NaCl, twice in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 500 mm NaCl, and finally in 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5. All buffers used were supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The resin containing bound proteins was solubilized in SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min at 95 °C, and applied onto the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Phosphorylation of CacyBP was analyzed using Western blot techniques with monoclonal antibodies against phosphorylated serine residues (Alexis Corp.) as described in the original protocols. For determination of the ATP effect, the supernatants were preincubated for 20 min at 37 °C with PMA and CaCl2 at final concentrations of 8 nm and 0.5 mm, respectively. Then ATP was added to a final concentration of 300 μm, and the solution was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was inhibited by adding SDS and Nonidet P-40 to a final concentration of 0.1%. Protease inhibitors were subsequently added, and the immunoprecipitation assay was performed as described above. Polyclonal antibodies, Northern blots, electrophoresis, and immunoblotting were performed as described by Jastrzebska et al. (17Jastrzebska B. Filipek A. Nowicka D. Kaczmarek L. Kuźnicki J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with the minor modifications described below. New polyclonal antibodies were prepared against recombinant CacyBP cloned in the pET30 vector (16Nowotny M. Bhattacharya S. Filipek A. Krezel A.M. Chazin W. Kuźnicki J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31178-311822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Control experiments performed on NB-2a cells using preimmune serum or anti-CacyBP serum saturated with CacyBP confirmed the high quality of this serum (not shown). For Northern blots total RNA was prepared from cells using an RNA purification kit (Qiagen). For Western blots antibodies against CacyBP were diluted 1:800. To establish the effect of [Ca2+]i on the intracellular distribution of CacyBP, we analyzed primary cultures from rat cortical neurons before and after stimulation. Unstimulated cells, KCl-activated cells, and cells in which KCl was washed out after stimulation were probed by immunocytochemistry using anti-CacyBP antibodies. In unstimulated neurons CacyBP was distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, A and D); this staining pattern was observed in the majority of the cells (Table I). The level of [Ca2+]i in rat cortical neurons has been established previously to be ∼50 nm in resting cells and above 300 nm upon KCl activation (27Hayashi T. Kagaya A. Takebayashi M. Oyamada T. Inagaki M. Tawara Y. Yokota M. Horiguchi J., Su, T.-P. Yamawaki S. J. Neural. Transm. 1997; 104: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We observed that activation of cultured cortical neurons by KCl induces CacyBP translocation mainly to the perinuclear region (Fig. 1,B and E). The KCl effect seems to be physiologically significant because about 85% of the cells showed increased CacyBP immunostaining in this region (Table I). The Ca2+-induced translocation of CacyBP to the nuclear envelope was reversible. After removing KCl from the medium, the localization of CacyBP in the cytoplasm was restored in the majority of cells (Fig. 1, C and F and Table I).Table IPercentage of neurons containing high levels of CacyBP in the perinuclear regionMethodTreatmentNoneKClKCl washoutAnti-CacyBP staining2.5 ± 0.585.1 ± 3.98.0 ± 2.0Neurons were unstimulated (None), stimulated with KCl (KCl) or stimulated with KCl and incubated for 2 h in medium without KCl (KCl washout) and then stained with antibodies against CacyBP.

Cells exhibiting a clear ring around the nucleus were considered as those containing a high level of CacyBP in the perinuclear region (see Fig. 1). We next performed a quantitative analysis of the CacyBP distribution within the cell. For this purpose, line intensity profiles of CacyBP across the cell were obtained (Fig. 1, D–F). Along these lines the fluorescence intensities in the perinuclear region (In) and in the cytoplasm (Ic) at a constant distance from the nuclear envelope were determined. In unstimulated neurons the ratio In/Ic was 1.09 (Fig. 1 D and Table II), indicating the lack of significant enrichment of the CacyBP in the perinuclear region. After stimulation of neurons and an increase in [Ca2+]i the ratio In/Ic was 1.58 (Fig. 1 E and Table II), indicating the accumulation of CacyBP in the perinuclear region. After removing the stimulus, the ratio was 1.18, indicating that Ca2+-dependent translocation of CacyBP is reversible (Fig. 1 F and Table II).Table IICacyBP fluorescence intensity in perinuclear region in relation to its value in the cytoplasm in neuronal cellMethodTreatmentNoneKClKCl washoutAnti-CacyBP staining1.09 ± 0.041.58 ± 0.041.18 ± 0.05(n = 11)(n = 10)(n = 10)Neurons were unstimulated (None), stimulated with KCl (KCl), or stimulated with KCl and incubated for 2 h in medium without KCl (KCl washout) and then stained with antibodies against CacyBP.

Results are the mean ± S.E. from n cells. To learn more about the affect of Ca2+ on CacyBP intracellular localization, we searched for cell lines expressing high levels of CacyBP. The level of this protein was examined in two cell lines of neuronal origin: PC12 cells and neuroblastoma NB-2a cells. Northern blotting with a full-length cDNA probe (Fig. 2, A and B) showed that CacyBP mRNA was present at a much higher level in neuroblastoma NB-2a than in PC12 cells. Also, a much more intense immunoreactive protein band representing CacyBP was detected by Western blotting analysis from the extracts of neuroblastoma NB-2a, compared with PC12 cells (Fig. 2 C). Thus, the NB-2a cells were chosen for further studies. Neuroblastoma NB-2a cells were treated with different agents affecting [Ca2+]i and were then fixed and stained with antibodies against CacyBP. In resting cells in which [Ca2+]i was shown to be 120 nm (Fig. 3), immunostaining was observed mainly in the perinuclear region, similar to activated neurons (Fig. 4 A). As shown in Table III more than 80% of the cells exhibited increased immunostaining in the perinuclear region. The treatment of cells with thapsigargin, which led to an increase of [Ca2+]i to above 300 nm (Fig. 3), did not affect the staining pattern (Fig. 4 B) nor did it affect the percentage of cells showing this staining pattern (Table III).Figure 4Localization of CacyBP in neuroblastoma NB-2a cells.

https://openalex.org/W1991482981,"Abstract Human multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) confers resistance to many natural product chemotherapeutic agents and actively transports structurally diverse organic anion conjugates. We previously demonstrated that two hydrogen-bonding amino acid residues in the predicted transmembrane 17 (TM17) of MRP1, Thr1242 and Trp1246, were important for drug resistance and 17β-estradiol 17-(β-d-glucuronide) (E217βG) transport. To determine whether other residues with hydrogen bonding potential within TM17 influence substrate specificity, we replaced Ser1233, Ser1235, Ser1237, Gln1239, Thr1241, and Asn1245 with Ala and Tyr1236 and Tyr1243 with Phe. Mutations S1233A, S1235A, S1237A, and Q1239A had no effect on any substrate tested. In contrast, mutations Y1236F and T1241A decreased resistance to vincristine but not to VP-16, doxorubicin, and epirubicin. Mutation Y1243F reduced resistance to all drugs tested by 2–3-fold. Replacement of Asn1245 with Ala also decreased resistance to VP-16, doxorubicin, and epirubicin but increased resistance to vincristine. This mutation also decreased E217βG transport ∼5-fold. Only mutation Y1243F altered the ability of MRP1 to transport both leukotriene 4 and E217βG. Together with our previous results, these findings suggest that residues with side chain hydrogen bonding potential, clustered in the cytoplasmic half of TM17, participate in the formation of a substrate binding site."

Lignins are located in the primary and secondary walls of specific plant cells and are synthesized for mechanical strength, defense, and water transport in terrestrial vascular plants. The temporal and spatial correlation between lignin synthesis and peroxidase catalysis has been suggested based on studies of the enzyme, the hydroxycinnamic acid substrates, and the hydrogen peroxide co-substrate in vivo. In lignin tissues of transgenic plants, the Arabidopsis ATP A2 peroxidase promoter directs GUS reporter gene expression, indicating involvement of the peroxidase in the assembly of the lignin polymer (1Ostergaard L.

After administration of the reducing substrate [13C]ferulic acid to wheat cell walls for extended duration, elevated levels of ferulic acid in the lignin-like tissues were revealed by in situ solid state 13C NMR (2Lewis N.G.

In Pinus taeda cell suspension cultures, lignin synthesis is correlated with the generation of the oxidizing co-substrate H2O2 (3Nose M. Bernards M.A. Furlan M. Zajicek J. Eberhardt T.L. Lewis N.G. Phytochemistry. 1995; 39: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Suberin provides a physical barrier to moisture loss in plants as well as a defensive shield against pathogens. In the potato, a H2O2-generating system with NAD(P)H-dependent oxidase-like properties is temporarily associated with suberin synthesis (4Bernards M.A. Razem F.A. Phytochemistry. 2001; 57: 1115-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and the polyaromatic domain of suberins in wound-healing potato (Solanum tuberosum) tubers is constituted of polymers derived from hydroxycinnamic acid (5Bernards M.A. Lopez M.L.

Tyrosine, both as free amino acid and in peptides or proteins, is also a substrate for many plant peroxidases. After one-electron oxidation and subsequent deprotonation, a tyrosine radical species is formed that can combine with another tyrosine radical at either the phenolic oxygen or at one of the ortho positions of the aromatic ring (16Gross A.J.

These structural proteins contain highly repetitive peptide sequences, among which the tyrosine-containing Val-Tyr-Lys-Pro-Pro pentapeptide.In vitro, dityrosines stemming from peroxidase catalysis in proteins were demonstrated in soluble collagens and in wheat prolamine (22Michon T. Wang W. Ferrasson E. Gueguen J. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 63: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because both FA and tyrosine are subject to peroxidase-mediated oligomerization, we rationalized that hetero-coupling of these substrates should be feasible (19Oudgenoeg G. Hilhorst R. Piersma S.R. Boeriu C.G. Gruppen H. Hessing M. Voragen A.G.J. Laane C. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2001; 49: 2503-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Such peroxidase-mediated hetero-coupling could provide an explanation for the occurrence of protein-carbohydrate complexes in plant cell walls and the incorporation of FA and other hydroxycinnamic derivatives into lignin and suberin tissues on a protein template. From an earlier study with the tripeptide Gly-Tyr-Gly (GYG) and FA, we established conditions that resulted in covalent linkage of FA and the peptidyl tyrosine (19Oudgenoeg G. Hilhorst R.

Evidence was provided for the peroxidase-mediated formation of GYG oligomers linked by dehydrogenation, ranging from dimers to pentamers that are oxidatively cross-linked to either one or two molecules of FA (19Oudgenoeg G.

In the present study we have further explored the mechanism of hetero-adduct formation of GYG and FA. Complementary to the aforementioned studies (2Lewis N.G. Yamamoto E. Wooten J.B. Just G.

Glycine-tyrosine-glycine (GYG) was obtained from Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland. HRP (type VI-A) and FA were obtained from Sigma. Hydrogen peroxide (30% v/v) was obtained from Merck. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Solutions of 12.44 mm ferulic acid and 12.44 mm H2O2 (kept on ice) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 10% (v/v) acetonitrile were continuously and simultaneously added to the incubation mixture using two peristaltic pumps (LKB Bromma 2232 Microperpex S). The incubation mixture, thermostatted at 20 °C, contained 25 mm GYG and 1.25 mg of HRP in an initial volume of 10 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0. 20 ml of the FA solution and 20 ml of the H2O2 solution were added over a 15-min period. After another 10 min of incubation, the reaction mixture was frozen in liquid nitrogen, freeze-dried, and stored at 4 °C until analysis. For liquid chromatography-MS analysis, 20 μl of the reaction mixture (10 mg of lyophilisate redissolved in 100 μl of MilliQ water) was separated on a 150 × 2.1-mm Alltima C18 column (Alltech, Breda, The Netherlands) running in 0.03% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Elution was performed with a linear gradient of 0–40% acetonitrile in 0.03% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water over a 45-min period. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed with a LCQ ion trap (Finnigan MAT 95, San José, CA) with the use of electrospray ionization and detection in the positive ion mode. The capillary spray voltage was 2.5 kV, and the capillary temperature was 200 °C. The instrument was controlled by Xcalibur software. The accuracy of the mass determinations is ±0.5 Da. After a full MS scan, ions with a mass to charge (m/z) ratio within 10m/z units of the most abundant ion were selected and subjected to collision-induced dissociation (CID, MS2). The five most abundant product ions resulting from the first stage of CID were fragmented further by a second stage of CID (MS3). For nanospray MS, 10 μl of the redissolved reaction mixture was diluted with acetonitrile (1:1) and loaded in a conductive metal-coated (coating 3AP) nanospray tip (2-mm internal diameter) (NewObjective, Woburn, MA) using a Gelloader pipette tip (Eppendorf). Nanospray conditions used were 25 units of nitrogen backing pressure and 1.2-kV ionization spray voltage, and the heated desolvation capillary was held at 200 °C. 500 scans detected in the positive-ion mode were averaged. After freeze-drying the incubation mixture, a yellow/orange powder was obtained. Nanoelectrospray MS of the redissolved lyophilisate revealed two dominant series of products (Fig.1). The most abundant ion series starts at m/z 830.36 and proceeds with averagem/z increases of 192 to ions with apparentm/z values of 1022.40, 1215.58, 1407.47, and 1598.87. The other series starts at m/z 978.25 and proceeds with average m/z increases of 192 to ions with apparent m/z values of 1170.32, 1362.29, 1554.42, 1746.54, and 1938.27. The difference of 192 between the ions in both series corresponds to FA linked by dehydrogenation. According to the total ion current after reverse phase HPLC of the redissolved incubation mixture, species with m/z829.8, 1021.9, and 978.0 are the three most abundant ions (Fig.2a). Figs. 2, b–g, show the single ion chromatograms of the reverse phase HPLC elution of these and three other selected species with a m/zof 341.0, 1213.8, and 873.9 (mono-isotopic), respectively. All these species are singly charged, as apparent from them/z difference of 1 between the first 313C isotopes in the partial mass spectra obtained by selection of ions within 10 m/z units from the ion of interest (data not shown). Therefore, the molecular mass of the compounds is considered equal to the apparent m/zvalues.FIG. 2Reverse phase-HPLC-MS chromatogram of the crude incubation mixture. a, total ion current. Single ion chromatograms of m/z species of 341.0 (b), 829.9 (c), 1021.9 (d), 1213.8 (e), 873.9 (f), and 978.1 (g).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The most abundant species is the ion with an apparentm/z value of 829.8 (mono-isotopic). The mass corresponds to a hetero-tetramer of 1 GYG linked by dehydrogenation to a decarboxylated trimer of FA. In the single ion chromatogram of this compound (Fig. 2, panel c), two main isomers, nearly base line-resolved, were detected. Upon collision-induced dissociation of the m/z 829.8 ions, positively charged product ions with m/z 636.0 and 441.8 result (Fig.3, panel c), stemming from consecutive loss of 2 FA moieties (194 Da each). The fragment ions withm/z 366.8 and 339.0 originate from further dissociation of the m/z 441.8 ion after consecutive loss of Gly and CO from the peptide moiety, resulting in the b2 and a2 ion of the modified tripeptide, as is proved by collision of the isolated m/z 441.8 ion during a second stage of CID (MS3). The second predominant ion, m/z 1021.9 (mono-isotopic), corresponds to dehydrogenation linkage of another FA moiety to the hetero-tetramer with a m/z of 829.8 and is assigned to a hetero-pentamer of 1 GYG linked by dehydrogenation to 4 FA molecules, of which one is decarboxylated. In the single ion chromatogram of this compound, several co-eluting isomers were detected (Fig. 2, panel d). Upon CID of any of thesem/z 1021.9 ions, positively charged product ions with m/z 827.6, 635.4, and 441.8 result (Fig. 3, panel d), stemming from consecutive losses of 3 FA moieties (194, 192, and 194 Da). A second stage of CID (MS3) on both the isolated m/z 827.6 and isolatedm/z 635.4 fragment ions results in the samem/z 441.8 fragment ion as resulted from CID of the hetero-tetramer, indicating the same structural element in the hetero-pentamer. In the single ion chromatogram of the third consecutive hetero-oligomer in this series of hetero-oligomers, m/z 1213.8, 1 minor isomer and 2 co-eluting major isomers were detected (Fig. 2, panel e). These are assigned to a hetero-hexamer of 1 GYG peptide linked by dehydrogenation to 5 FA, of which 1 is decarboxylated. Upon CID of any of these isomers, fragment ions withm/z 1019.9 (loss of one FA, 194 Da), m/z 827.8 (loss of second FA, 192 Da), m/z 635.9 (loss of third FA, 192 Da) and predominantly fragment ions of m/z 441.9, 366.8, and 339.0 result (Fig. 3, panel e). The three “fingerprint” ions again demonstrate a constituting moiety similar to that in the preceding compounds in this series. One higher hetero-oligomer in this series was found (Fig. 1), and thism/z 1407.3 species is assigned to a hetero-heptamer of 1 GYG and 6 FA, of which 1 is decarboxylated. CID of this ionized compound predominantly yielded the fragment ions withm/z 825.9 (loss of 3 FA moieties) and 441.8 (loss of 5 FA moieties) and is concluded to contain the same structural element. The full ion series with m/z values of 829.9, 1021.9, 1214.4, and 1405.8 are assigned to GYG-FA oligomers linked by dehydrogenation containing 3, 4, 5, or 6 FA moieties respectively, each containing the same structural element consisting of a covalent adduct of 1 GYG and decarboxylated FA. The base line-resolved-eluting m/z 341.0 species (Fig. 2, panel b) are assigned to isomeric decarboxylated dehydrodimers of FA. The third predominant ion in the total ion current, m/z 978.1 (Fig. 2, panel a), is assigned to a hetero-pentamer of 1 GYG linked by dehydrogenation to 4 FA moieties, of which 2 are decarboxylated. Several minor isomers elute separated from two major isomers that co-elute (Fig. 2, panel g). CID of these isomers results in fragment ions withm/z 783.4 and 590.0 (Fig. 3, panel g), corresponding to the consecutive loss of two FA moieties (194 Da). Loss of a third, decarboxylated, FA (148 Da) leads to the main fingerprint fragment ion with m/z 441.8 and the other two fingerprint ions with m/z 366.8 and 339.0 (Fig.3, panel g). Therefore the core structural element is concluded to be the same as for the single fold decarboxylated series of hetero-oligomers. The second predominant product in this ion series, m/z 1170.3 (Fig. 1), corresponds to dehydrogenation linkage of another FA moiety to the 2-fold decarboxylated hetero-pentamer with m/z 978.1 and is assigned to a hetero-hexamer of 1 GYG linked by dehydrogenation to 5 FA molecules, of which 2 are decarboxylated. In the single ion chromatogram of this compound (data not shown), several co-eluting isomers were detected at a retention time similar to that of them/z 978.1 species. Upon ESI and CID of any of these m/z 1170 species, positively charged ions with m/z 976.8, 783.9, 590.0, and 441.8 result (Fig. 3, panel h), originating from consecutive losses of 4 FA moieties (194, 193, 194, and 148). The full series of ions starting at m/z 978.3 (Fig. 1) are therefore assigned to hetero-oliogomers of 1 GYG coupled by dehydrogenation with 4–9 FA moieties, of which 2 are decarboxylated. The m/z 873.9 ion (Fig. 1 and the chromatogram in Fig. 2f) is assigned to a hetero-tetramer of 3 nondecarboxylated FA moieties and 1 GYG. This m/zvalue of this species corresponds to 2 FA molecules linked by dehydrogenation and 1 FA molecule not linked by dehydrogenation to GYG. CID of these ions (Fig. 3, panel f) results in different product ions as compared with the series of 1- and 2-fold decarboxylated hetero-oligomers, and the fingerprint ions from the former series are completely absent. This implies that the ion with am/z of 873.9 cannot contain them/z 441.9 moiety like the former series of hetero-oligomers. The main fragment ion is that withm/z 295.8, corresponding to the GYG ion after loss of the FA moieties. No higher hetero-oligomers containing exclusively nondecarboxylated FA moieties were found. However, two smaller nondecarboxylated hetero-oligomers, m/z488 (hetero-dimer) and m/z 680 (hetero-trimer), were formed in minor amounts (Fig. 1). Interestingly, these compounds were main products in a previous incubation (19Oudgenoeg G. Hilhorst R. Piersma S.R. Boeriu C.G. Gruppen H. Hessing M. Voragen A.G.J. Laane C. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2001; 49: 2503-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In this study it is shown that the kinetically controlled incubation of FA and GYG with peroxidase and H2O2 results in a complex range of (isomeric) products of different degrees of polymerization. Because isolation of these products for NMR characterization is not straightforward, mass spectrometry including a first and second stage of collision-induced dissociation was the method of choice to elucidate the range of products and their compositional structural elements. In both the series of 1-fold decarboxylated and the series of 2-fold decarboxylated hetero-oligomers the difference in mass between the compounds was always 192 Da, a mass difference expected for dehydrogenation linkage of FA to each preceding compound in a constitutive fashion. Unambiguous assignment of the ions of the compounds to the constituting moieties of the two series of hetero-oligomers is provided by CID. Upon CID of a hetero-oligomer, the covalent linkages in the proximity of the C-C bond that connects the four aromatic moieties A, B, C, and Tyr (Fig.4, structure 5h e.g.) are most susceptible to fragmentation due to the high probability of the presence of the proton in this acetal-type structural moiety. After loss of two neutral FA moieties, the 441.9 fragment results (Fig. 4, structure 5h4). Further fragmentation of this fragment (MS3) resulted in the b2 and a2 ions (Fig. 4, structures 5h6 and 5h7) that further validates the assignment of the 441.9 fingerprint ion as GYG linked to the decarboxylated FA moiety. The presence of the fragment ion of 441.9 (Fig. 3, panels c, d, e, g, and h) in all MS2 spectra of compounds of the one- or 2-fold decarboxylated hetero-oligomers and the fragments of 367 and 339 in the MS3 spectrum of the parent mass 441.9 clearly indicates that the GYG peptide bound to the decarboxylated FA moiety (Fig. 4, all structures, ring C) is always one of the constituting moieties of at least 1 isomer of the 1- and 2-fold decarboxylated hetero-oligomers. Most of the other, isomeric hetero-tetramers (Fig. 6b, structures 5a–h) are unlikely to lead to the fingerprint fragment ions as outlined for isomer 5h in Fig. 4. However, these species may well contribute to the total ion current of the compound of interest but not participate in the fragmentation pattern of a co-eluting isomer.FIG. 6a, HRP-catalyzed oxidation of GYG. b, eight possible hetero-tetrameric radicals resulting from radical combination of two isomeric GYG radicals and four isomeric trimeric FA-radicals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In contrast to the 1- and 2-fold decarboxylated hetero-oligomers, the fragmentation of the 873.9 species (Fig. 3, panel f) does not lead to product ions corresponding to the m/z441.9 structural element (Fig. 4, structure 5h4). This nondecarboxylated hetero-oligomer results mainly in anm/z 295.8 product ion (Fig. 3, panel f), which corresponds to GYG with no decarboxylated FA moiety attached. This distinct product ion pattern was also found for nondecarboxylated FA-GYG-FA and FA-GYG in a previous study, where GYG was kept in excess over FA (19Oudgenoeg G. Hilhorst R. Piersma S.R. Boeriu C.G. Gruppen H. Hessing M. Voragen A.G.J. Laane C. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2001; 49: 2503-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) during the incubation. Higher hetero-oligomers of this type were not found in those studies nor in the present one. This discrepancy between the wide range of decarboxylated, further oligomerized hetero-oligomers and the limited range of nondecarboxylated, maximally tetrameric hetero-oligomers suggests two different mechanisms for the covalent attachment of FA to the tyrosine template. Under the conditions applied, the main route occurs via radical attack on the vinylic bond of the decarboxylated FA dimer (Fig.5a, structures 2aand 2b), whereas the minor route proceeds via de- or nondehydrogenation addition of the non-decarboxylated monomeric FA radical. The main route deduced from the present data is supported by a recently proposed mechanism for the lignin peroxidase-catalyzed homo-trimerization of FA (15Ward G. Hadar Y. Bilkis I. Konstantinovsky L. Dosoretz C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18734-18741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This mechanism comprises an attack by a phenoxy-FA radical (Fig. 5a, structure 1a) on the vinylic bond of a decarboxylated FA dehydrodimer (Fig. 5, structures 2a and 2b). The initially formed trimeric FA radical species resulting from this attack (Fig.5b, structures 3a–d) can be oxidized and, after deprotonation, result in a FA trimer, as was authenticated by one- and two-dimensional 1H NMR (15Ward G. Hadar Y. Bilkis I. Konstantinovsky L. Dosoretz C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18734-18741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Decarboxylated dehydrodimers of FA were also formed in the present HRP-mediated incubation of GYG with FA (Fig. 2, panel b). Because GYG radicals are continuously present (Fig.6a, structures 4aand 4b) in the hetero-incubation, as follows from the presence of GYG dimers (data not shown), two routes can directly lead to a hetero-oligomer. Combination of the trimeric FA radical (Fig.5b, structures 3a–d) with the peptidyl tyrosine radical of an oxidized GYG (Fig. 5a, structures 4a or 4b) results in a hetero-tetramer comprising 3 FA and 1 GYG (Fig. 6b, structures 5a–h). Attack of the GYG radical on the vinylic bond of the decarboxylated FA dimer and subsequent combination of the resulting hetero-trimeric radical with another FA radical also leads to the hetero-tetramer, whereas attack of the hetero-trimeric radical on another decarboxylated FA dimer leads to a 2-fold decarboxylated hetero-pentamer. These routes, both via decarboxylated FA dimers, appear to be important in the oligomerization to higher FA oligomers on the peptide since the higher hetero-oligomers always are 1- or 2-fold-decarboxylated. Any of the 1-fold decarboxylated hetero-tetramers (Fig. 6b, structures 5a–h) or 2-fold decarboxylated hetero-pentamers evolved from this reaction path still has several sites for further oligomerization to higher hetero-oligomers. On the basis of the similar product pattern of polymerization of FA by either Lignin peroxidase or HRP, it was suggested that FA oligomerization is governed by radical chemistry rather than enzyme specificity (15Ward G. Hadar Y. Bilkis I. Konstantinovsky L. Dosoretz C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18734-18741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These findings are in agreement with our data, which show that it is the chemistry of the enzymatically primarily formed radical products and especially the chemistry of the decarboxylated dehydrodimers of FA that leads to oligomerization. The GYG-FA hetero-oligomers found in the present study are clearly distinct from the ones found in a previous study (19Oudgenoeg G. Hilhorst R. Piersma S.R. Boeriu C.G. Gruppen H. Hessing M. Voragen A.G.J. Laane C. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2001; 49: 2503-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This shows that the type of oligomerization is strongly dependent on the substrate concentrations and kinetic control of the reaction. Our present findings confirm the suggestion of Ward et al.(15Ward G. Hadar Y. Bilkis I. Konstantinovsky L. Dosoretz C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18734-18741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) that the peroxidase-induced cross-linking of FA leads to higher oligomers than the trimers they identified by NMR. Furthermore, the attachment of higher oligomers of FA bound to a peptidyl tyrosine would supply a spatial basis for the covalent anchoring of easy diffusible small phenols on a tyrosine template in a plant cell wall protein and supports the often hypothesized template-guided in situ polymerization process of lignin (23Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 24Gang D.R. Costa M.A. Fujita M. Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Wang H.B. Burlat V. Martin W. Sarkanen S. Davin L.B.

Science. 1997; 275: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). During growth or stress, increased levels of FA in the plant can result in differentiation of the type of tissue formed in a similar fashion as the kinetically and stoichiometrically controlled polymerization of FA described in this paper. The phenolic moiety enables oxidation of the molecule as a trigger for oxidative polymerization, whereas the vinylic moiety stabilizes the radical and allows further polymerization after decarboxylative dimerization. Just as the peptide oligomers in a previous study always appeared to be blocked for further oligomerization by two nondecarboxylated FA molecules linked by dehydrogenation to the growing peptide oligomer (19Oudgenoeg G. Hilhorst R. Piersma S.R. Boeriu C.G. Gruppen H. Hessing M. Voragen A.G.J. Laane C. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2001; 49: 2503-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), low concentrations of the FA monomer in plants can block possible sites for growth either on an esterified FA or on a protein-tyrosine template. High levels of FA statistically enhance dimerization to the decarboxylated FA dimers that enable further polymerization as established in the present study. The regulation of plant cell wall growth via control of the level of FA would therefore be amplified by an intrinsic feature of FA chemistry inevitably associated with FA concentration in the presence of peroxidases. We suggest that FA and possibly related cinnamic acid derivatives can exert two opposite effects on the growth of plant cell wall tissue, solely dependent on the incident concentration. We are grateful to Richard Blaauw for helpful discussions."

In this study, the mechanism of dynamin-2 action was explored during endocytosis of the G protein-coupled AT1A angiotensin receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Dynamin-2 molecules with mutant pleckstrin homology domains or deleted proline-rich domains (PRD) exerted dominant negative inhibition on the endocytosis of radiolabeled angiotensin II. However, only the PRD mutation interfered with the localization of the dynamin-2 molecule to clathrin-coated pits and reduced the inhibitory effect of the GTPase-deficient K44A mutant dynamin-2. Green fluorescent protein-tagged Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of endophilin I and amphiphysin II, two major binding partners of dynamins, also inhibited AT1A receptor-mediated endocytosis of angiotensin II.

Transient overexpression of these SH3 domains also reduced the localization of dynamin-2 to clathrin-coated pits.

In rats and mice, the AT1-R has functionally very similar AT1A and AT1B subtypes, which have greater than 90% sequence identity but different tissue distributions. Binding of Ang II to AT1-Rs initiates conformational changes that lead to activation of their cognate G protein(s), predominantly Gq/11, in numerous Ang II target tissues. The receptors utilize a number of signaling pathways including stimulation of phospholipase C, causing Ca2+ signal generation and activation of protein kinase C isoforms and small G proteins, stimulation of receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (1De Gasparo M.

Initial studies performed at saturating Ang II concentrations suggested that dynamin-independent mechanisms may mediate AT1-R internalization (6Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). However, at physiological hormone concentrations the major mechanism of AT1-R internalization is dynamin- and β-arrestin-dependent endocytosis via clathrin-coated vesicles (7Gáborik Z. Szaszák M.

Clathrin coat formation is thought to begin with recruitment of the AP2 clathrin adaptor complex to the plasma membrane, where it serves as a template for the assembly of the clathrin lattice. Studies on recycling of synaptic vesicles and internalization of nutrient and growth factor receptors have demonstrated that invagination of clathrin-coated pits and fission of clathrin-coated vesicles requires the recruitment of several accessory proteins, including dynamin, amphiphysin, endophilin, and synaptojanin (11McPherson P.S. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 12Marsh M. McMahon H.T. Science. 1999; 285: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 13Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Dynamin is a 100-kDa GTPase that is thought to act at the fission step and is present in the cytosol as dimers or tetramers (14Muhlberg A.B. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6676-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). During receptor endocytosis, dynamin assembles into ringlike structures around the neck of budding clathrin-coated pits, where it functions directly or indirectly in pinching off vesicles from the plasma membrane (15Schmid S.L. McNiven M.A. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Dynamin alone can polymerize into rings and can evaginate spherical liposomes into narrow tubules surrounded by polymerized dynamin (13Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 16Sever S. Muhlberg A.B. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1999; 398: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 17Takei K. Slepnev V.I.

However, other molecules interact with dynamin in vivo to facilitate its function and to assist in its recruitment to clathrin-coated pits (11McPherson P.S. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 12Marsh M. McMahon H.T. Science. 1999; 285: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 20Hill E. van der, K. J. Downes C.P. Smythe E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 309-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Dynamin has several functional domains including an N-terminal GTPase domain, a PH domain, and a C-terminal proline-rich domain (PRD) (13Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar,15Schmid S.L. McNiven M.A. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The GTPase activity of dynamin is essential for its function, and GTPase-deficient mutants of dynamin act as dominant negative inhibitors of endocytosis (13Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 15Schmid S.L. McNiven M.A. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The PH domain is a structural motif that is found in hundreds of proteins and has been shown to bind with different preferences to various phophoinositides (21Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 22Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 503-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Certain PH domains that bind with high affinity and high specificity for phosphoinositides are capable of driving membrane recruitment (23Balla T. Bondeva T. Varnai P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 238-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The PH domain of dynamin binds phosphoinositides with low affinity, and oligomerization of the molecule is required for strong binding of dynamin to inositol lipid-containing membranes in vitro(24Klein D.E. Lee A. Frank D.W. Marks M.S. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27725-27733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The importance of the PH domain in dynamin function is indicated by the ability of PH domain mutant dynamins with impaired phosphoinositide binding to act as dominant negative inhibitors of receptor endocytosis (25Achiriloaie M. Barylko B. Albanesi J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1410-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 26Vallis Y. Wigge P. Marks B. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Curr.

These observations and some in vitro studies suggest that dynamin can be targeted to the plasma membrane during endocytosis through its PH domain (28Zhang P. Hinshaw J.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 922-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, the PH domain also participates in the regulation of the GTPase activity of dynamin (13Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 29Barylko B. Binns D. Lin K.M. Atkinson M.A. Jameson D.M. Yin H.L. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3791-3797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The PRD of dynamin interacts in vitro with many SH3 domain-containing proteins, including proteins with established roles in endocytosis and recycling of synaptic vesicles (30Gout I. Dhand R. Hiles I.D. Fry M.J. Panayotou G. Das P. Truong O. Totty N.F. Hsuan J. Booker G.W. Cell. 1993; 75: 25-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). These endocytic proteins include amphiphysin and endophilin (13Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 20Hill E. van der, K. J.

Biol. 1997; 7: 554-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Amphiphysin, which binds the clathrin heavy chain, the appendage domain of α-adaptin, dynamin, and synaptojanin, has been implicated in the recruitment of dynamin to clathrin-coated vesicles (11McPherson P.S. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 12Marsh M. McMahon H.T. Science. 1999; 285: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The SH3 domain of amphiphysin inhibits endocytosis in the lamprey reticulospinal synapse and in fibroblasts (31Wigge P. Vallis Y. McMahon H.T. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 554-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 32Shupliakov O. Low P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H. David C. Takei K., De Camilli P. Brodin L. Science. 1997; 276: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The SH3 domain-containing protein, endophilin, which also functions in endocytosis (33de Heuvel E. Bell A.W. Ramjaun A.R. Wong K. Sossin W.S. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8710-8716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), has lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase activity that appears to be essential for its function during the invagination of coated vesicles (34Schmidt A. Wolde M. Thiele C. Fest W. Kratzin H. Podtelejnikov A.V. Witke W. Huttner W.B. Soling H.D. Nature. 1999; 401: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). However, endophilin also stimulates membrane vesiculation independent of this enzymatic activity (35Farsad K. Ringstad N. Takei K. Floyd S.R. Rose K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Although the major binding partner of endophilin is synaptojanin, a phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphatase, it also binds to the PRD of dynamin (11McPherson P.S. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 36Micheva K.D. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27239-27245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that dynamin can be targeted to the membrane by interaction with SH3 domain-containing proteins (37Shpetner H.S. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 38Okamoto P.M. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Most of the data on dynamin's interaction with SH3 domain-containing proteins, such as amphiphysin and endophilin, was obtained using dyn1, the neuronal isoform of the molecule. These interactions are required for the recycling of synaptic vesicles via a clathrin-mediated process, and a similar process may operate during the endocytosis of hormone receptors in nonneural tissues. It is noteworthy that most endocytic proteins have neural and nonneural isoforms with very similar domain structures. In addition to its role in the formation of endocytic vesicles at the cell surface, dyn2, the ubiquitous isoform of dynamin, has been implicated in vesicle formation from endosomes and the Golgi (40Kasai K. Shin H.W. Shinotsuka C. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 780-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 41Nicoziani P. Vilhardt F. Llorente A. Hilout L. Courtoy P.J. Sandvig K. Van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 481-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Dynamins, particularly the nonneural dyn2 isoform, also appear to function as signaling molecules (42Kranenburg O. Verlaan I. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35301-35304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 43Fish K.N. Schmid S.L. Damke H. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 24575-24578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Amphiphysins are predominantly expressed in neuronal tissues and bind to the same site on dynamin (PSRPXR) (46Owen D.J. Wigge P. Vallis Y. Moore J.D. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5273-5285Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), but splice variants of amphiphysin II are also present in nonneuronal tissues (47Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although recent data have shown that the SH3 domains of endophilins 1 and 2 bind to the same motif (PPXRP), the tissue distribution of endophilin 2 suggests that it might be the partner of dyn2 in nonneuronal tissues (48Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40424-40430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 49Huttner W.B. Zimmerberg J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 478-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The role of dynamin during endocytosis of many GPCRs has been well established using GTPase-deficient dynamin mutants (13Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 50Bünemann M. Lee K.B. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Roseberry A.G. Hosey M.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 169-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 51Ferguson S.S.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar), but little is known about its mechanism of action in this process. In some GPCRs, including the AT1-R, PH domain mutant dynamin has a dominant negative inhibitory effect on agonist-induced receptor endocytosis (7Gáborik Z. Szaszák M. Szidonya L. Balla B. Paku S. Catt K.J. Clark A.J.L. Hunyady L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 52Werbonat Y. Kleutges N. Jakobs K.H. Van Koppen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21969-21974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Endophilins directly interact with the β1-adrenergic receptor and stimulate its agonist-induced internalization (53Tang Y., Hu, L.A. Miller W.E. Ringstad N. Hall R.A. Pitcher J.A. DeCamilli P. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12559-12564Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), but the role of their association with dynamin has not been demonstrated during the endocytosis of GPCRs. The role of the PRD in recruitment of dyn2 to clathrin-coated pits in nonneural tissues also has not been elucidated. The present study was performed to determine whether the role of ubiquitously expressed dyn2 isoform during agonist-induced endocytosis of the G protein-coupled AT1A receptor in nonneuronal cells is analogous to that of the neuronal isoform of dynamin, dyn1, during the recycling of synaptic vesicles and endocytosis of nutrient and growth factor receptors. The cDNA of the rat vascular smooth muscle AT1A receptor was provided by Dr. K. E. Bernstein (Emory University, Atlanta, GA). The cDNAs of the HA epitope-tagged wild-type and K44A mutant dyn2 subcloned into pcDNA3 vector were kindly provided by Dr. K. Nakayama (Tsukuba Science City, Ibaraki, Japan). The GST-fused N-terminal SH3 domain of Nck was provided by Dr. László Buday (Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary) and was subcloned into pEGFP-C2 expression vector. GFP-β2-adaptin was obtained from Dr. Marc G. Caron (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). Anti-HA.11 monoclonal antibody was from Babco (Berkeley, CA), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody was from Pierce. Rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Monoclonal antibody raised against GFP was a gift of Dr. László Buday. Unless otherwise stated, all other chemicals and reagents were from Sigma. The SH3 domains of amphiphysin II and endophilin I with an N-terminal GFP tag were generated by amplification of the SH3 domain segment, which were subsequently cloned into the mammalian expression vector pEGFP-C2 as described earlier (39Simpson F. Hussain N.K. Qualmann B. Kelly R.B. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Substitution of lysine 535 of dyn2 with alanine (dyn2-K535A) was performed using the Muta-Gene kit (Bio-Rad). Deletion of the PRD (dyn2-ΔPRD) was performed by the same method by introducing a stop codon in place of the proline 746 of dynamin. In the double mutants, dyn2-K44A/K535A and dyn2-K44A/ΔPRD, dyn2-K44A was used as template for generating the lysine 535 substitution with alanine or the PRD deletion, respectively. The sequences of the mutants were verified by dideoxy sequencing. CHO-K1 cells were transiently transfected in 24-well plates with plasmids containing AT1A-R cDNAs and wild-type or mutant dynamins using 12 μg/ml LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as described previously (54Hunyady L. Bor M. Balla T. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31378-31382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For confocal microscopy, cells were grown on glass coverslips and transfected with the indicated constructs using 3 μl/ml FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics, Nutley, NJ). CHO cells were maintained in NaHCO3-buffered Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 IU/ml penicillin (Invitrogen). To determine the internalization kinetics of the AT1A-R, 125I-Ang II (2.5 kBq/ml (∼0.03 nm)) was added in 0.25 ml of HEPES-buffered Ham's F-12, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. Incubations were stopped by placing the cells on ice and rapidly washing them twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Acid-released and acid-resistant radioactivities were separated and measured by γ-spectrometry as described previously (54Hunyady L. Bor M. Balla T. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31378-31382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The percentage of internalized ligand at each time point was calculated from the ratio of the acid-resistant specific binding to the total (acid-resistant + acid-released) specific binding. For immunodetection of expressed proteins 48 h after transfection, cells were scraped into 200 μl of Laemmli buffer containing protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml benzamidine). After centrifugation, the supernatant proteins were analyzed on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were then probed with primary antibody and detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using the SuperSignal West Pico detection kit (Pierce). For immunofluorescence studies, CHO cells were grown on glass coverslips and transiently transfected as described above. 48 h later, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline prior to fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were then incubated with sodium borohydride (1 mg/ml) for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Incubation with anti-HA antibody (1:100) for 1 h at room temperature was followed by two 15-min washes with 25 mmTris HCl (pH 7.4) in 0.14 m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and incubation for 1 h with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:100). The coverslips were mounted using Dako Fluorescence mounting medium, and images were detected with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser-scanning microscope. GFP and rhodamine were excited with argon (488-nm) and helium/neon (543-nm) lasers, and emitted fluorescences were detected in multitrack mode with 500–550- and 565–615-nm bandpass filters, respectively. To study the role of the PRD of dyn2 during AT1-R endocytosis, a dyn2 mutant was created (dyn2-ΔPRD), in which the entire C-terminal proline-rich domain was deleted commencing at proline 746 (Fig.1A). When co-expressed with the AT1A-R in CHO cells, this construct had a dominant negative inhibitory effect on the endocytosis of the receptor (Fig.2A). The expression levels of the mutant dyn2 constructs in CHO cells are shown in Fig 1B. However, the extent of inhibition was smaller than that caused by the GTPase-deficient mutant, dyn2-K44A. To determine whether deletion of the dyn2 PRD affects the endocytosis of the AT1A-R because it interferes with the localization of dyn2, a double mutant of dyn2 containing both the K44A replacement and the PRD deletion was created. It was expected that the ΔPRD mutation would reverse the dominant negative inhibitory effect of the K44A mutation if PRD deletion interferes with the localization of dyn2 to clathrin-coated vesicles. The inhibitory effect of the K44A/ΔPRD mutant dyn2 on AT1A-R endocytosis was similar to that of the dyn2-ΔPRD, whereas it was considerably less than that of the K44A mutant (Fig.2A). These data indicate that deletion of the PRD interferes with dynamin function by preventing its localization in clathrin-coated pits.FIG. 2Effects of overexpressed dyn2 mutants on the kinetics of AT1A-R endocytosis in CHO cells.A, cells were grown in 24-well plates and co-transfected with 0.5 μg of AT1A-R cDNA and 0.5 μg of wild-type dyn2 (●), dyn2-ΔPRD (▴), dyn2-K44A (▪), and dyn2-K44A/ΔPRD (▵). Endocytosis of 125I-Ang II was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are shown as means ± S.E. of four independent experiments, each performed in duplicate.

Experimental conditions were the same as in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The role of the PRD in dynamin function was then compared with that of the PH domain. Substitutions of lysine 535 in the PH domain of dyn2 interfere with the phosphoinositide binding of the construct, and K535A and K535M dynamins have been shown to exert dominant negative inhibitory effects on AT1-R endocytosis (7Gáborik Z. Szaszák M. Szidonya L. Balla B. Paku S. Catt K.J. Clark A.J.L. Hunyady L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 52Werbonat Y. Kleutges N. Jakobs K.H. Van Koppen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21969-21974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Combination of the K535A and the K44A mutations increased the dominant negative inhibition of AT1-R endocytosis compared with the individual dyn2-K535A mutation, and its effect was similar to that of the dyn2-K44A mutation (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that, unlike the PRD, the PH domain of dyn2 is not required for proper localization of the molecule during AT1-R endocytosis. The intracellular localization of transiently expressed dynamins in CHO cells was analyzed by immunostaining to detect the HA epitope tag attached to the wild-type and mutant dyn2 (40Kasai K. Shin H.W. Shinotsuka C. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 780-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Wild-type dyn2 showed a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern and also localized to the plasma membrane (Fig.3A). Replacement of lysine 535 by alanine in the PH domain had no major effect on the localization of the mutant molecule as compared with wild-type dyn2 (Fig.3B). As previously shown (40Kasai K. Shin H.W. Shinotsuka C. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 780-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), dyn2-K44A appeared in punctate intracellular structures and also accumulated in larger structures associated with the cell membrane (Fig. 3D). In contrast, whereas the dyn2-ΔPRD mutant also appeared in punctate cytoplasmic structures, no membrane localization was observed (Fig.3C). The localization of the dyn2-K44A/K535A (Fig.3E) and dyn2-K44A/ΔPRD (Fig. 3F) double mutant constructs was not distinguishable from that of the dyn2-K44A and the dyn2-ΔPRD, respectively. The presence of wild-type and mutant dyn2 molecules in clathrin-coated pits was determined based on co-localization with GFP-tagged β2-adaptin (Fig. 4), an essential component of the AP2 clathrin adaptor protein (12Marsh M.

Using over 80 enzymes of the chymotrypsin family, we demonstrate that the general organization of the phylogenetic tree and its functional branch points are fully accounted for by a limited number of residues that cluster around the active site of the protein and define the contact region with the P1–P4 residues of substrate. A method is introduced to identify amino acid residues that dictate the functional diversity acquired during evolution in a protein family. Using over 80 enzymes of the chymotrypsin family, we demonstrate that the general organization of the phylogenetic tree and its functional branch points are fully accounted for by a limited number of residues that cluster around the active site of the protein and define the contact region with the P1–P4 residues of substrate. Phylogenetic trees of proteins are useful to map evolutionary developments and functional diversity within a given family. Progress made in the cloning and expression of a large number of autologous proteins has generated large databases that can now be used to draw quantitative conclusions on how different specificities and functions emerged during evolution. Residues that are conserved throughout the family provide important determinants of function or structural stability, but cannot be linked to the onset of functional differences or specificities because they are evolutionarily non-informative. On the other hand, residues subject to a high rate of coding nucleotide mutation are often inconsequential on function or structural stability. However, some residues must have changed during evolution to provide the branching patterns observed in phylogenetic trees. Methods that identify these residues can potentially unravel how proteins evolved in general and assist in the identification of function in newly discovered genes. Several methods have been proposed to identify residues potentially involved in function. Some of these methods explore the functional divergence from sequence multi-alignment and phylogenetic trees (1Gu X. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1999; 16: 1664-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Others combine phylogenetic and structural data (2Lichtarge O. Bourne H. Cohen F.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 342-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 3Armon A. Graur D. Ben-Tal N. J. Mol.

Here we introduce an alternative method that does not require subdivision of the protein family and that takes into account not only conserved residues, but also residue replacements fixed along the transition from one branch of the evolutionary tree to other daughter branches. The method evaluates how every position of the sequence multi-alignment contributes to the architecture of the tree and provides a three-dimensional map of the regions of the protein that played a determining role during evolution. 700 protein sequences were pulled out from the NCBI non-redundant data base (National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) by several iterations of PSI-BLAST (5Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59920) Google Scholar) using trypsin homologues as queries. All sequences were aligned with Clustal W1.8 (6Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35492) Google Scholar). The best alignment obtained after different circular permutations of sequences and incorporation of the alignment from three-dimensional structure superposition was retained. Sequences were clustered by branches into 80 groups using a maximum threshold of 50% for sequence pair identity from a neighbor-junction tree performed with Clustal and accounting for 500 bootstraps (7Felsenstein J. Phylip package, Version 3.57c. University of Washington, Seattle, WA1994Google Scholar). The global alignment was checked manually first among groups, then group by group, to improve gap extensions. Eighty protein sequences, one per cluster, were selected keeping human sequences whenever possible (42 out of 115 human serine proteases) or sequences from the closest species. Four sequences were also retained to cover the selection from a previous study (8Krem M.M. Rose T. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28063-28066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The minimum sequence pair identity was 6% with an average of 27% and a median of 28%. Only two residues (Cys182, Gly196) are absolutely conserved over all sequences. Bootstrap sampling was carried out from sequence alignment using Seqboot. Pairwise sequence relationships were quantified on 200 bootstraps using a distance matrix calculated with Protdist and based on the PAM1 substitution matrix (7Felsenstein J. Phylip package, Version 3.57c. University of Washington, Seattle, WA1994Google Scholar). The average pair distance was 1.82. Trees were built from Fitch on the 200 bootstraps using the global rearrangement option (9Felsenstein J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 266: 418-427Crossref Google Scholar, 10Fitch W.M. Margoliash E. Science. 1967; 155: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (2416) Google Scholar). The final tree was drawn using Consense (7Felsenstein J. Phylip package, Version 3.57c. University of Washington, Seattle, WA1994Google Scholar). The average root distance was 1.46, the average sum of squares between sequence pair distances calculated from a tree and distances from its corresponding matrix was 43.00 and the average percent S.D. was 7.88. Seqboot, Protdist, Fitch, and Consense are components of the Phylip package, Version 3.57c (7Felsenstein J. Phylip package, Version 3.57c. University of Washington, Seattle, WA1994Google Scholar). Impact values were calculated for 230 positions corresponding to residues 16–245 of chymotrypsin using Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3 in the text. Three-dimensional models of protein structures not available in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (11Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27540) Google Scholar) were built by homology modeling with Modeler (12Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10561) Google Scholar) and optimized by minimization with Discover (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). Substrate-protease models were built from the x-ray structure 1PPB and 1NRS of thrombin bound at the active site with H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl (13Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) or Leu-Asp-Pro-Arg (14Matthews I.I. Padmanabhan K.P. Ganesh V. Tulinsky A. Ishii N. Chen J. Turck C.W. Coughlin S.R. Fenton J.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3266-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) extended to Leu-Asp-Pro-Arg-Ser-Phe-Asn. The active site region was partitioned into specificity sub-sites from S4 through S3′. Accessible surface areas were calculated as described previously (15Richards F.M. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 440-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). A phylogenetic tree associated with serine proteases of the chymotrypsin family is shown in Fig. 1. Sequences are grouped according to main functional properties, and their separation into branches is independent of how the root of the tree is chosen (8Krem M.M. Rose T. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28063-28066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The contribution of each residue in the sequence to the definition of the tree was quantified in terms of an “impact” value. A key parameter associated with the tree is the sum of squares of the deviations between the distances of two sequences a and b in the tree, dab, and in the matrix of aligned sequences, mab, normalized by the sum of squares of the dab values, i.e.ς2=∑a=1N∑b=1N (dab−mab )2∑a=1N∑b=1Ndab2,Equation 1 where N is the number of positions in the sequence. For each position k in the sequence, the residue at that position was replaced by all 20 amino acids and a gap for all sequences in the alignment, and the resulting value of ς2 derived from the new set of mab values was calculated in each case using a PAM matrix. The dab values from the original parent tree generated by the alignment of unperturbed sequences were kept constant. The average value of ςk2 was expressed as the linear combination,ςk2=fk,Aςk,A2+fk,Cςk,C2+…+fk,Yςk,Y2+fk,gapςk,gap2Equation 2 where ςk,x2 is the value of ς2 obtained when residue at position k is replaced with the amino acid x = Ala, Cys, … Tyr, or a gap, and fk,x is the correct weighting factor associated with the substitution (7Felsenstein J. Phylip package, Version 3.57c. University of Washington, Seattle, WA1994Google Scholar). The impact value of residue k is defined as followsIk=exp(−‖ς2−ςk2‖)∑k=1Nexp(−‖ς2−ςk2‖)Equation 3 and is bound from 0 to 1. The impact of a set of p positions in the sequence is calculated from the sum of p terms as in Equation 3, divided by p. The impact value Ik is maximum when ςk2≈ς2, i.e. when position k contains a residue or gap that is absolutely conserved among all sequences or when the distribution of amino acids or gap substitutions at position k reproduces closely the functional branching of the parent tree. Therefore, the comparison of the residue or gap conservation at position k with the impact Ik enables the identification of residues with high impact and relatively low conservation that have been replaced during evolution to generate the functional diversity in the parent tree. Fig. 2a shows the profile of impact values of individual positions along the sequence of the catalytic domain of a consensus serine protease. High values of the impact parameter tend to concentrate at few positions. The impact value has practically no correlation (r = 0.0, Fig. 2e) with the water accessibility of the residue. Notably, all residues with impact values >0.95 are ≥95% buried. Fig. 2,b and c, show the solvent-accessible surface of chymotrypsin color-coded according to the impact value and the residue conservation. The difference in color patterns indicates the poor correlation between impact values and residue conservation (Fig. 2,b and c, see also d). Several residues on the surface are poorly conserved (Fig. 2c, blue), but are associated with high impact values (Fig. 2b, white or red). Invariant or quasi-invariant positions such as the catalytic His57 or Ser195 (Fig. 1) have impact values close to 1, as expected from Equations 2 and 3. Notably, residues with high impact tend to concentrate at the active site. The distribution of impact values in Fig. 2 suggests that most of the information necessary to construct the phylogenetic tree in Fig. 1 is concentrated in a few sites of the protein. This prompted an investigation of the smallest set of residues capable of reproducing the phylogenetic tree in its entirety. Impact values were calculated for secondary structural elements of the protease domain. The impact value of individual β-strands ranged from 0.40 to 0.64 (Fig. 3, b1 to b12). Helices are not conserved among serine proteases and were grouped for the analysis with loops connecting β-strands. These elements show impact values ranging from 0.41 to 0.67 (Fig. 3, a1 to a10). In no case, however, could the tree in Fig. 1 be reconstructed using single secondary structural elements, either β-strands, helices, or loops. Next we calculated the impact values of patches of accessible surface area ranging 1100–1300 Å2 in size and plotted them versus the average conservation of residues (Fig. 3). More than 100 patches were scanned around each of the water-accessible residues on the surface of the protein. The area with maximum impact clearly stood out from the rest and involved the specificity sub-sites S1–S4. This area encompasses the smallest set of residues capable of reproducing the phylogenetic tree in Fig. 1 in its entirety. Remarkably, the resulting mab values obtained from the S1–S4 sub-sites give a better approximation of the phylogenetic tree in Fig. 1 than the entire sequence of the enzyme or any combination of secondary structural elements. We have recently shown that the 50 residues of the C-terminal domain of serine proteases are necessary and sufficient to reproduce the architecture of the parent tree in Fig. 1 (8Krem M.M. Rose T. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28063-28066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Twenty out of 30 residues defining the S1–S4 sub-sites are comprised within the 50 C-terminal residues. We conclude that substrate recognition at the S1–S4 sub-sites dominates the evolution and functional diversity of serine proteases. The definition of the impact value in Equation 3 is a powerful tool to identify sets of residues specifying functional branching in a phylogenetic tree. The information derived from this approach should assist in the rational engineering of enzymes with altered specificity by pointing to regions that likely hold structural determinants of function. In addition, the profile of impact values in a newly discovered gene in a protein family reveals targets for mutagenesis from which the function of the protein may be identified."

The binding depended on mm Ca2+, and 1 mol of tubulin dimer bound 2 mol of synaptotagmin I with half-maximal binding at 6.6 μm tubulin.

These results suggest that direct interaction between synaptotagmin I and tubulin provides a mechanism for attaching synaptic vesicles to microtubules in high Ca2+ concentrations. Chemical synapses depend on fast release of neurotransmitter molecules from the presynaptic terminal by synaptic vesicle exocytosis (1Katz B. The Release of Neural Transmitter Substances. Liverpool University Press, Liverpool1969Google Scholar). This release is triggered by instantaneous increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration around the release site (active zone), due to Ca2+ influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels opened by depolarization. After exocytosis, synaptic vesicles are rapidly endocytosed and regenerated by multiple pathways. Synaptic vesicle endocytosis is a process driven by concerted actions of many proteins and other substances, which is not yet fully understood (2Slepnev V.I. De Camilli P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 3Jarousse N. Kelly R.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).

Close apposition of the synaptic vesicle membrane and the presynaptic membrane by the tight trans-SNARE complex, with the energy released by its assembly, is proposed to drive fusion between the two membranes (11Hanson P.I.

The protein forms complexes with SNAREs including VAMP through its Ca2+-dependent binding to syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25.

Cell. 1994; 79: 717-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar), suggesting an important role of the protein in the release mechanisms. A very recent genetic study has shown a quantitative relationship between the Ca2+-binding affinity of synaptotagmin I and the Ca2+ sensitivity of transmitter release (28Fernandez-Chacon R. Konigstorfer A. Gerber S.H. Garcia J. Matos M.F. Stevens C.F. Brose N. Rizo J. Rosenmund C. Südhof T.C. Nature. 2001; 410: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the protein responds to Ca2+ very rapidly to bind simultaneously to membrane and the ternary SNARE complex (29Davis A.F. Bai J. Fasshauer D. Wolowick M.J. Lewis J.L. Chapman E.R. Neuron. 1999; 24: 363-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, the protein has been widely assumed as a major Ca2+ sensor in the release process. However, it remains to be elucidated how synaptotagmin I could transmit the Ca2+signal to the SNAREs, eventually bringing about the fusion of the synaptic vesicle membrane with the presynaptic membrane. Interestingly, overexpression of synaptotagmin I in PC12 cells modulated fusion pore kinetics, indicating its interaction with fusion pores (30Wang C,-T. Grishanin R. Earles C.A. Chang P.Y.

Mikoshiba K. Llinás R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10708-10712Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of synaptotagmin I or II in the neuromuscular junction of Xenopus led to a different distribution of synaptic vesicles without change in the total number of synaptic vesicles (36Morimoto T. Wang X.H. Poo M.M. Neuroscience. 1998; 82: 969-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that synaptotagmin I is involved not only in the endocytosis of synaptic vesicles but also in their distribution. The protein thus seems to regulate many steps of the synaptic vesicle cycle. However, its exact role in each step remains poorly understood. To understand the mechanisms of various functions of synaptotagmin I, we searched for cytosolic proteins that interact with synaptotagmin I. We have found that synaptotagmin I directly binds to tubulin in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that this binding provides a mechanism for attaching synaptic vesicles to microtubules in high Ca2+ concentrations. Preliminary accounts of this work have been published (37Honda A. Saisu H. Ishizuka T. Mori K.J. Abe T. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1999; 25: 1742Google Scholar, 38Honda A. Saisu H. Ishizuka T. Mori K.J. Abe T. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 2000; 26: 347Google Scholar). Taxol, subtilisin (type III), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride AEBSF, bovine thrombin, and benzamidine-agarose were purchased from Sigma. Glutathione-Sepharose and protein G-Sepharose fast flow were obtained from AmershamBiosciences. Anti-α-tubulin and β-tubulin mAbs (DM1A and TUB 2.1, respectively) were obtained from Sigma. Anti-SNARE mAbs have been reported previously (39Ishizuka T. Saisu H. Odani S. Kumanishi T. Abe T. Neuroscience. 1999; 88: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody against rat VAMP-2 was generated by immunizing BALB/c mice with recombinant, full-length VAMP-2 prepared by digestion of GST-VAMP-2 with thrombin. One hundred μg (first injection) or 50 μg (subsequent injections) of VAMP-2 in phosphate-buffered saline was emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's complete (first injection) or incomplete (subsequent injections) adjuvant and injected intraperitoneally at two-week intervals. One week after the fourth injection, mouse antisera were collected. A mAb (3F10) raised against the N-terminal region of synaptotagmin I (40Charvin N. L'eveque C. Walker D. Berton F. Raymond C. Kataoka M. Shoji-Kasai Y. Takahashi M. Seagar M.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4591-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) was a gift from M. Takahashi (Mitsubishi Kasei Institute for Life Sciences, Tokyo, Japan). All procedures were carried out at 4 °C in the presence of protease inhibitors (1 μmpepstatin A/2 μm leupeptin/0.3 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Fresh forebrains from three-week-old female rats were homogenized in 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), and then solid NaCl was added to a final concentration of 150 mm. After incubation for 30 min, the homogenate was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was used as the soluble fraction. The lysed P2 and crude synaptosome fractions were prepared from adult rat forebrains as follows. Forebrains were homogenized in 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4)/0.32 m sucrose and centrifuged at 700 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged again at 9000 × g for 20 min, and the pellet (P2 fraction) was collected as crude synaptosome fraction. The P2 fraction was lysed by dilution into 9 volumes of 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4) and incubated for 30 min. The pellet obtained by centrifugation at 9000 × g for 20 min was the lysed P2 fraction. The lysed P2 and crude synaptosome fractions were suspended in solution A (20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4)/150 mm NaCl) at a protein concentration of 4 mg/ml, and equal volumes of solution A containing 2% (w/v) Triton X-100 were added. The mixtures were stirred for 30 min and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resultant supernatants were diluted with equal volumes of solution A and used as the Triton X-100 extracts. These extracts were used immediately after preparation. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. cDNAs for full-length and cytoplasmic regions of wild-type or mutant rat synaptotagmin I were prepared by PCR and cloned into the pGEX-KG vector to express as GST fusion proteins. Substituted mutations of constituents of the Ca2+ ligand (D230N/D232N and D363N/D365N), the polylysine motifs (K(189–192)A and K(324–327)A) or the (SDP) YVK motifs (Y180A/V181A/K182A and Y311A/V312A/K313A) were prepared using the overlapping primer method (41Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: a Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., New York1990: 177-183Google Scholar). Plasmids for GST fusion proteins of the cytoplasmic regions of rat syntaxin 1A and VAMP-2 and full-length mouse SNAP-25 were similarly prepared. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. These constructs were transfected to the Escherichia coli strain BL21. GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose. For some experiments, GST-synaptotagmin I bound to glutathione-Sepharose was cleaved with thrombin (1 unit/mg GST fusion protein). Thrombin in the released proteins was removed with benzamidine-agarose. All recombinant proteins were used within 3 days after purification. GST alone, GST-entire cytoplasmic portion of synaptotagmin I (referred to as GST-synaptotagmin I), or GST-synaptotagmin I fragments (all 3 μm) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (100 μl) were incubated with the rat brain-soluble fraction (1 mg of protein/ml) or purified tubulin (1 mg/ml) in 0.5% Triton X-100/HNa buffer (10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4)/150 mm NaCl/1 μm pepstatin A/2 μm leupeptin/0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 3 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with 1 ml of 0.1% Triton X-100/HNa buffer containing 3 mm CaCl2or 1 mm EGTA. The bound materials were eluted with the sample buffer (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Purified tubulin (see below) was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) (1.1 mg of tubulin/ml gel). Tubulin-Sepharose beads were incubated with the Triton X-100 extract of the lysed P2 fraction (1 mg of protein/ml in 0.5% Triton X-100/HNa buffer/3 mm CaCl2) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 10 volumes of 0.5% Triton X-100/HNa buffer/3 mm CaCl2 and then with 10 volumes of 0.1% Triton X-100/HNa buffer/3 mm CaCl2. The bound materials were eluted with the sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by immunoblotting. Whole microtubule proteins (CS3) were prepared from porcine brains by temperature-dependent cycles of assembly-disassembly following the procedures of Shelanski et al. (43Shelanski M.L. Gaskin F. Cantor C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). Pure tubulin was isolated from CS3 by chromatography on phosphocellulose (Whatman P-11) (44Weingarten M.D. Lockwood A.H. Hwo S.Y. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (2200) Google Scholar), concentrated by ultrafiltration to 10 mg/ml, and stored at −80 °C until use. Digestion of tubulin with subtilisin was carried out by modifying the method of Rodionov et al.(45Rodionov V.I. Gyoeva F.K. Kashina A.S. Kuznetsov S.A. Gelfand V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5702-5707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, taxol-stabilized microtubules (10 mg/ml tubulin treated with 20 μm taxol) were digested with subtilisin (10 μg/ml) for 15 min or overnight at 37 °C. The cleavage reactions were terminated by addition of 2 mm AEBSF. Subtilisin-treated microtubules were sedimented through a cushion of 10% (w/v) sucrose in RB buffer (100 mm Mes-KOH (pH 6.8)/0.5 mm MgCl2/1 mm EGTA) containing 1 mm GTP, 20 μm taxol, and 2 mm AEBSF at 100,000 × g for 50 min at 30 °C. The pellets were washed and resuspended in HNa buffer containing 2 mm AEBSF. The subtilisin-digested tubulins were subjected to SDS-PAGE by the modified Laemmli's method (46Melki R. Kerjan P. Waller J.P. Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11536-11545Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Purified tubulin was resolved by SDS-PAGE on 12.5% gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked overnight at 4 °C with 3% skim milk in TBST buffer (0.05% Tween 20/10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)/150 mm NaCl) and then incubated for 6 h with the Triton X-100 extract of the lysed P2 fraction (final protein concentration of 1 mg/ml in 0.5% Triton X-100/HNa buffer/3 mmCaCl2). After washing five times with TBST/3 mmCaCl2, synaptotagmin I bound to tubulins was detected by a mAb to the protein. Protein G-Sepharose fast flow (250 μl of resin) was incubated with a mAb to α-tubulin (DM1A) or mAb to SNAP-25 (6H4, see Ref. 39Ishizuka T. Saisu H. Odani S. Kumanishi T. Abe T. Neuroscience. 1999; 88: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) for 2 h and then washed three times with 0.2 m borate buffer (pH 9.0). Solid dimethyl pimelimidate was added to a final concentration of 20 mm, and the mixture was incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Then the Sepharose beads were washed twice and incubated for 2 h in 0.2m ethanolamine-HCl (pH 8.0). The mAb-coupled Sepharose beads were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and stored at 4 °C. Tubulin and SNAP-25 were immunoprecipitated from 2 ml of the Triton X-100 extract (1 mg of protein/ml) of crude synaptosomes by incubating with 50 μl of mAb-coupled protein G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed three times with 10 volumes of HNa buffer/0.1% Triton X-100. The proteins precipitated with the resin were eluted with the sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by immunoblotting using the ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). CS3 (2 mg/ml) or a mixture of thrombin-released synaptotagmin I (1.5 μm) and CS3 was incubated in the presence or absence of 1 mmCaCl2 for 30 min at 4 °C and transferred to cuvettes. The cuvettes were warmed to 37 °C, and 1 mm GTP was added. Microtubule formation was assayed by measuring turbidity (absorbance at 340 nm) at 37 °C. Aliquots of polymerization reactions taken at 30 min at 37 °C were analyzed by electron microscopy. A mixture of CS3 and thrombin-released synaptotagmin I was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of 1 mm GTP and 1 mm CaCl2 and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 50 min at 30 °C through a cushion of 10% sucrose in RB buffer without EGTA. The pellet was homogenized on ice in RB buffer/1 mm GTP/1 mm CaCl2 and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 50 min at 4 °C. Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-PAGE detected proteins in each supernatant and pellet. Samples were applied to collodion-coated grids (400 mesh) for 30 s and then fixed with 1% (w/v) glutaraldehyde for 5 s. After rinses in distilled water, samples were negatively stained with 3% (w/v) uranyl acetate solution. The grids were examined with the Hitachi H-7100 electron microscope. To identify soluble proteins that specifically interact with synaptotagmin I, the soluble fraction from the rat brain was incubated with GST fusion protein of the cytoplasmic portion of synaptotagmin I immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose. After thorough washing, the bound materials were eluted with SDS and subjected to SDS-PAGE. When the soluble fraction was incubated with GST-synaptotagmin I in the presence of EGTA, no major binding components were detected. (data not shown). However, in the presence of 3 mm CaCl2, only a protein of 55 kDa was found in the bound material (Fig. 1 a). This component was not retained by immobilized GST alone (Fig. 1 b), GST fusion proteins of the cytoplasmic portion of syntaxin 1A or VAMP-2, or full-length SNAP-25 (data not shown), indicating the specificity of the binding. The 55-kDa protein was recognized by mAbs specific to α- or β-tubulin (Fig. 1 b). Based on the molecular mass value and the reaction with the mAbs, the 55-kDa band was identified as a mixture of α- and β-tubulin. To characterize tubulin binding to synaptotagmin I in more detail, we used purified tubulin instead of the brain-soluble fraction. We determined tubulin binding as the molar ratio between synaptotagmin I and tubulin dimer (αβ) (usual form of tubulin) by NIHImage analysis of Coomassie Blue-stained bands. Concentration dependence of tubulin binding to synaptotagmin I was determined by incubating immobilized GST-synaptotagmin I with increasing concentrations of purified tubulin in the presence or absence of CaCl2 (Fig. 2 a). Purified tubulin efficiently bound to GST-synaptotagmin I in the presence of CaCl2. Thus the interaction between GST-synaptotagmin I and tubulin was direct. The binding was saturated at 1.5 mg/ml tubulin with half-maximal binding at ∼6.6 μm (0.72 mg/ml). At the saturation, the molar ratio between tubulin dimer and synaptotagmin I was ∼0.5, indicating that one tubulin dimer binds two synaptotagmin I molecules. In the absence of CaCl2, the maximal binding was about one-fifth of that in CaCl2. Fig. 2 b illustrates the Ca2+ dependence of tubulin (2 mg/ml) binding to synaptotagmin I. Tubulin binding was saturated at 2.0 mm CaCl2 with half-maximal binding at ∼0.9 mm CaCl2. Ca2+-dependent binding of tubulin to synaptotagmin I appeared to consist of at least two components with different Ca2+ affinities (see the curve in Fig. 2 b), like syntaxin 1A binding to synaptotagmin I (19Chapman E.R. Hanson P.I., An, S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23667-23671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). To determine the domain of synaptotagmin I involved in tubulin binding, binding of purified tubulin to GST fusion proteins of various portions of the cytoplasmic domain of synaptotagmin I was examined (Figs.3, a and b). Neither the region between the transmembrane segment and the C2A domain (fragment I) nor the short linker domain between the C2A and C2B domains (fragment III) exhibited significant binding. Binding of C2A and C2B domains was respectively about one-half of that of the entire cytoplasmic domain. C2A domain plus C2B domain without the linker bound tubulin almost as efficiently as the entire cytoplasmic domain (data not shown). Therefore, both C2A and C2B domains are involved in tubulin binding. Based on these findings, we inferred that the sequences common to both C2 domains of synaptotagmin I might be important for tubulin binding. We focused on the polylysine (KKKK) (47Bommert K. Charlton M.P. DeBello W.M. Chin G.J. Betz H. Augustine G.J. Nature. 1993; 363: 163-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and YVK (also called SDPYVK) (16Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Chapman E.R. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5735-5741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) motifs conserved between the two C2 domains. In a previous study, replacement of the polylysine motif with alanine did not impair syntaxin/synaptotagmin I binding but inhibited neurotransmitter release from PC12 cells (48Thomas D.M. Elferink L.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3511-3520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The YVK motif has been shown to be involved in its Ca2+-dependent binding to syntaxin 1 and phospholipids (16Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Chapman E.R. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5735-5741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We replaced these two motifs in both C2 domains with alanine and examined tubulin binding of these mutants (Fig. 3 c). Although the polylysine motif mutant exhibited normal binding, binding was negligible in the YVK motif mutant (Fig. 3,d and e). Thus the YVK motif was essential for tubulin binding. Tubulin binding in the absence of CaCl2was also greatly decreased. Four aspartic acid residues in the C2A (Asp-230 and Asp-232) (15Rizo J. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15879-15882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar) and C2B domains (Asp-363 and Asp-365) (49Desai R.C. Vyas B. Earles C.A. Littleton J.T. Kowalchyk J.A. Martin T.F.J. Chapman E.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1125-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) are important constituents of the Ca2+-binding sites (Ca2+ ligands) of synaptotagmin I. Replacement of all these residues with alanine leads to a loss of Ca2+ sensitivity of the bindings of SNAREs (syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25) and phospholipids (50Earles C.A. Bai J. Wang P. Chapman E.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To examine whether tubulin binding to synaptotagmin I depends on Ca2+sensitivity of synaptotagmin I as reported for these substances, we prepared the same mutant. Ca2+-dependent tubulin binding of the mutant synaptotagmin I was markedly decreased (38% of wild-type). In contrast, Ca2+-independent binding did not significantly change (F"

At least seven such changes are disruptions of RNA base pairings (3Madhani H.D. Guthrie C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1994; 28: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 4Ares M. Weiser B. Prog.

Some of these changes are probably catalyzed by DE XD/H-box proteins, eight of which are known to be required for the splicing pathway in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (6Staley J.P. Guthrie C.

To date the spliceosomal DE XH/D box proteins are fulfilling the prediction that they catalyze the RNA rearrangements in the spliceosome. They are required at steps in which ATP hydrolysis and spliceosomal structural changes both occur; most have been shown to have RNA-dependent ATPase activity; and some have even been found to have RNA unwinding activity (6Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1998; 92: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the actual targets of the spliceosomal DEAD box proteins are unknown. Some of the proteins may not even unwind RNA but instead act as an RNPase to remove protein bound to RNA (11Schwer B. Nat. Struct.

Two of the first DEAD-box proteins required for yeast prespliceosome formation on the pre-mRNA are Sub2p (13Kistler A.L. Guthrie C.

It immediately succeeds the binding of the U1 snRNP and at least two proteins (Bbp and Mud2p) to the pre-mRNA. During prespliceosome formation, Bbp and Mud2p are displaced from the pre-mRNA (17Berglund N. Colot H. Rosbash M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 858-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 18Rutz B.

Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1864-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), the target and mechanism of action of Prp5p in prespliceosome formation are unknown. In vitro, Prp5p enhances deoxyoligo-directed RNase H cleavage of U2 snRNP (25Wiest D. O'Day C. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33268-33276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and the ATPase activity of the Prp5 is stimulated by U2 snRNA (26O'Day C. Dalbadie-McFarland G. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33261-33267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These two results suggest that U2 snRNA is the target of the Prp5p. This idea is attractive because U2 alternates between two conformations involving stem-loop II in its 5′ end region, but only one conformation (stem-loop IIA) forms the prespliceosome efficiently (27Zavanelli M.I. Ares M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2521-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 28Zavanelli M.I. Britton J.S. Igel A.H. Ares M., Jr. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1689-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Genetic data as well indicate that Prp5p somehow interacts with U2 (16Ruby S.W. Chang T.H. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1909-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 29Wells S.E. Ares M., Jr. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6337-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30Yan D. Ares M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 818-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, it has not been shown whether or not Prp5p physically associates with the U2 snRNP. Biochemical assays to detect unwinding of a generic RNA substrate by Prp5p have not been successful (26O'Day C. Dalbadie-McFarland G. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33261-33267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This may be because Prp5p acts as an RNPase on an RNA-protein substrate, or it requires a specific substrate or protein cofactor as do some helicases (31Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenbreg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 32Yamaguchi M. Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9197-9201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The function of Prp5p in vivo does depend on other proteins as revealed by genetic assays. The Ts prp5-1 and prp5-3 mutations are synthetically lethal with any one of several mutations in the multimeric SF3 complex (16Ruby S.W. Chang T.H. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1909-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 29Wells S.E. Ares M., Jr. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6337-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 33Wells S.E. Neville M. Haynes M. Wang J. Igel H. Ares M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 220-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The human SF3 complex binds via one of its components, SF3b, to the 5′ region of U2 snRNA (34Kramer A. Gruther P. Groning K. Kastner B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1355-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Both the human and yeast SF3 complexes facilitate binding of U2 snRNP to the pre-mRNA and stabilize the prespliceosome (1Kramer A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Additionally another yeast protein, Cus2p, physically associates with SF3 and the U2 snRNP as well as suppresses the misfolding of the U2 snRNA and interacts genetically with Prp5p (35Yan D. Periiman R. Igel H. Howe K.J. Neville M. Ares M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5000-5009Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Previously, others (36Lamond A.I. Sproat B. Ryder U. Hamm J. Cell. 1989; 58: 383-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 37Ast G. Weiner A. RNA. 1997; 3: 371-381PubMed Google Scholar) have used 2′-O-methyl oligonucleotides (2′-OMe oligos) to probe the structures and functions of the spliceosomal snRNPs in HeLa cell splicing extracts. An oligo with a 2′-O-methyl is more resistant to the nucleases of the extract than one with a 2′-hydroxyl. It also does not activate the RNase H activity of the extract as does a 2′-deoxyoligo. Thus 2′-OMe oligos can form stable hybrids with snRNAs and preserve the snRNPs to which they may bind (36Lamond A.I. Sproat B. Ryder U. Hamm J. Cell. 1989; 58: 383-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this study, we used small, 2′-OMe oligos encoding the UACUAAC box to study factors required for pre-mRNA binding to U2 snRNP in yeast whole cell splicing extracts (WCE). The accessibility of the branch point interaction region (BpIR) of U2 snRNA to the oligo was enhanced by ATP and was dependent on the integrity and conformation of the U2 snRNP as well as on Prp5p activity. The Ts prp5-1 mutation reduced the ATP-stimulated binding of the 2′-OMe oligo to U2 snRNP. Furthermore, the mutation mapped to the ATP-binding motif I within the helicase-like domain. Finally, Prp5p physically associated with the U2 snRNP. Thus, Prp5p likely catalyzes an ATP-dependent conformational change of U2 snRNP. Deoxyoligos SRU2, SRU1, and oSR4 were as described previously (38Ruby S.W. Abelson J. Science. 1988; 242: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The following deoxyoligos were synthesized by either Genosys, Inc., or the University of New Mexico Center for Genetics in Medicine: oSR42 (5′ CCTCTTGATCATACCTTTCATGTCTTC), oSR43 (5′ CCCCTCGAGGATCCATATGTCAAATAAACCC), oSR177 (5′ AATTCAGGGTACCA), and oSR178 (5′ AATTTGGTACCCTG) for plasmid constructions; oSR125 (5′ CTATTGGAAGCGCATGTTTGATCAG), oSR152 (5′ GTGTATTGTAACAAATTAAAAGG), oSR154 (5′ GTTTATAATTAAATTTCAACCAGC), oSR127 (5′ AAGTTCAAAAAATATGGCAAGC), and oSR153 (5′ GTATTGTTTCAAATTGACCAAA) for primer extensions of U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNAs; and oSR115 (5′ ATACTTACCTTAAGATATCAGAGGAG) with oSR116 (5′ AAAATAAATCAAAAATTATAAGATCCACCCG), oSR117 (5′ ACGAATCTCTTTGCCTTTTGGCTTAG) with oSR118 (5′ GCGAACGGGAAGACGAGAGAAACATC), oSR119 (5′ ATCCTTATGCACGGGAAATACGCATATC) with oSR120 (5′ AAAGTATTCAAAAATTCCCTACAAG), oSR121 (5′ AAGCAGTTTACAGATCAATGGCGG) with oSR122 (5′ CGCCTTCCTTACTCATTGAGAAAAAGG), and oSR123 (5′ GTTCGCGAAGTAACCCTTCGTGGAC) with oSR124 (5′ AAAACGAAATAAATCCTTTGTAAAACGG) for PCR amplification of DNAs encoding U1, U2, U4, U5, and U5, respectively. The 2′-OMe oligos mU2-wt, mU2-4A, mU2-6C, mU2-4A6C, and mU2-bp (Fig. 1) were synthesized by Oligos Etc. (Wilsonville, OR). The 2′-OMe oligos mU2-dC (Fig. 1) and mActexon2 (5′ (dC)5UUIIICUICAIIUC) were synthesized by the Microchemical Facility at the California Institute of Technology (Pasadena, CA) with phosphoramidates (39Sproat B.S. lamond A.I. Beijer B. Neuner P. Ryder U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3373-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) obtained from B. Sproat (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany). The 5′terminal deoxycytidine residues of mU2-dC and mAct-exon2 were modified with N 4-(5-trifluoroacetylaminopentyl) for use in experiments not described in this study. The following plasmids were obtained from others: pGD231 (CEN-ARS-URA3-PRP5) and pGD532 (2μ-HIS3-PRP5) from G. Dalbadie-McFarland; PGAD-PRP5 from D. Wiest, pBM272 (40Johnston M. Davis R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) from M. Johnston; and pEG(KT) (41Mitchell D.A. Marshall T.K. Deschenes R.J. Yeast. 1993; 9: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) from M. Osley. Plasmid pGAD-PRP5 contains the PRP5 ORF amplified by PCR and fused to the Gal4 activation domain vector pGAD424 via a unique NdeI site spanning the start codon as described (26O'Day C. Dalbadie-McFarland G. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33261-33267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The pRS300 and pRS400 series of yeast shuttle vectors were as described previously (42Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1990; 122: 19-27Crossref Google Scholar). Plasmids were constructed with standard cloning techniques (43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid pCM1 was cloned in two steps as follows: step 1, pSR501 was constructed by ligating Hin cII-cut pGD532 under dilute conditions to remove the 1-kb Hin cII fragment upstream of PRP5; and step 2, the MCS restriction sites between the NotI and EcoRI were removed by cutting pSR501 with EcoRI and NotI, blunting the DNA ends with Klenow, and ligating the DNA. Plasmid pPS12 (prp5Δ1615::LEU2) was constructed in two steps as follows: step 1, the 3.9-kb PstI fragment of PRP5 from pGD532 was purified by gel electrophoresis and circularized by ligation under dilute conditions; and step 2, the circularized fragment was cut with BsaHI and SacI (removing 1.68 kb of coding sequence) and then ligated to pRS405 cut with AccI and SacI. pPS24 (prp5Δ1815::LEU2) was constructed by ligating a BclI-XhoI PRP5 fragment amplified by PCR with oligos oSR42 and oSR43 to pPS12 cut with BclI and XhoI. The GST tag was fused to the N terminus of the Prp5p as follows. The 2.5-kb EcoRI-SalI fragment from pGAD-PRP5 was ligated into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pRS423 to create pSR281. The StuI-EcoRI fragment with GAL1 promoter of pEG(KT) and GST fragment was fused upstream and out-of-frame to PRP5 ORF by cloning into pSR281 cut with SmaI and EcoRI to create pSR282. The PRP5 ORF and GST were put in-frame by ligating hybridized oligos oSR177 and 178 into pSR282 cut with EcoRI and NdeI to create plasmid pSR284. The following S. cerevisia e strains were obtained from others: RL172 (Mata prp5-1) from R. Last and J. Woolford (see Ref. 44Lustig A.J. Lin R.J. Abelson J. Cell. 1986; 47: 953-963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar); and H170–wt (Mata leu2-3,112 his4-619 lys2 U2::Ura3 (Ycp-LEU-U2wt)) and H170-C62U (Mata leu2-3, 112 his4-619 lys2 U2::Ura3 (YCp-LEU2-U2C62U)) from M. Ares (45Ares M., Jr. Igel A.H. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2132-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Haploid strains with the indicated prp mutations (16Ruby S.W. Chang T.H. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1909-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and wild type haploid TSR1210 (46Awasthi S. Palmer R. Castro M. Mobarak C.D. Ruby S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31004-31015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) were as described. Diploid DSR1515 was made by mating SRYwtg (Mata his3d200 his7 leu2 ura3-52) and SRYwth (Mata his3d200 leu2 ura3-52) using standard yeast genetics (47Guthrie C. Fink G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 1-933PubMed Google Scholar). Strain TSR477 was DSR1515 made heterozygous for prp5Δ1815::LEU2 by transformation with the pPS24 PstI fragment and confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Sporulation and tetrad dissection of 16 asci from TSR477 yielded no viable LEU2 spore clones. TSR477 was transformed with pGD231 and sporulated to yield haploid TSR489-7-3a (Mata prp5d1815::LEU2 his3d200 leu2-3-112, ura3-52 (pCEN-URA3-PRP5)). The wild type copy of PRP5 in yeast strain DSR489-7-3A was replaced with either plasmid pSR282 or pSR284 by plasmid shuffling (47Guthrie C. Fink G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 1-933PubMed Google Scholar) to obtain strains TSR1675 and TSR1673, respectively. The prp5-1 mutant allele was cloned by gap repair (48Orr-Weaver T. Szostak J.W. Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 228-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Plasmid pCM1 DNA was cut with NcoI and SpeI, purified by gel electrophoresis, and then introduced into strain SRY5-1a (Mata prp5-1 his3d200 leu2-3,-112, ura3-52) by transformation to His prototrophy at 23 °C. Several restriction endonucleases were tested for gapping. DNA gapped with NcoI and SpeI yielded only Ts yeast cells when 30 independent transformants were assayed. Plasmids (pTSR342-d1, pTSR342-d5, and pTSR342-e44) from 3 of the 30 yeast clones were isolated and amplified in Escherichia coli as described (48Orr-Weaver T. Szostak J.W. Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 228-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). All 3 plasmids conferred Ts growth when tested in TSR489-7-3A by plasmid shuffling. The 3.9-kb Hin cII-ClaI fragments from each plasmid were subcloned into Hin cII and ClaI sites of pRS413 to yield plasmids pPS17, pPS18, and pSP19, respectively and again confirmed for the Ts mutation in TSR489-7-3A. Fragments from pPS17 were subcloned into pPS25 and tested in yeast cells to map the Ts mutation to the 200-bp NcoI fragment. Plasmids pPS17, pPS18, and pPS25 were sequenced with the Sequenase version 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) across this fragment (43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Comparisons of the mutant with the wild type sequences in pPS25 and in GenBankTMshowed only a single nucleotide difference. Preparation of WCE by the “freeze-fracture” method,in vitro synthesis of 32P-labeled yeast actin precursor RNA, and splicing assays were as described (49Ruby S.W. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 323-349PubMed Google Scholar). For heat treatments, wild type and prp5-1 WCE were brought to 1.5 mm MgCl2, incubated for 10 min at 38 °C, and then put on ice. Mutant prp2-1 WCE was treated as described (44Lustig A.J. Lin R.J. Abelson J. Cell. 1986; 47: 953-963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). MgCl2, DTT, KPO4 (pH 7.4), and PEG8000 were then added to final concentrations of 3, 2, 60 mm, and 3% (w/v), respectively, for the final binding reactions as described below. The reactions were next incubated with 5 mm d-glucose (to deplete ATP) or water at 23 °C for 5 min. The binding reaction was then initiated by the addition of radiolabeled oligo to 5 nm and either water or ATP (to 2 mm), incubated at 23 °C, and processed as described below. Each 2′-OMe oligo was radioactively labeled at its 5′ end as described previously (39Sproat B.S. lamond A.I. Beijer B. Neuner P. Ryder U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3373-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and separated from unincorporated nts in two successive micro spin G-25 columns (AmershamBiosciences). The 2′-OMe oligo binding assay contained 2 mmDTT, 60 mm KPO4 (pH 7.4), 3% (w/v) PEG8000, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and 40% (v/v) extract in 20 mm Hepes-K+ (pH 7.8 at 0 °C), 0.2 mm EDTA, 50 mm DTT, and 20% (v/v) glycerol. The binding reaction was mixed on ice and then initiated by adding radiolabeled 2′-OMe oligo to a concentration of 5 nmand incubated at 23 °C. Five-μl reaction aliquots were each quenched with 9 μl of ice-cold R buffer mix containing 5 μl of R buffer (50 mm Hepes-K+ (pH 7.4), 2 mm magnesium acetate), 3 μl of load buffer (217 mm Tris phosphate (pH 8.0), at 0 °C, 40% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.25% (w/v) each bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol), and 1 μl of H2O. For zero time points, 5-μl reaction aliquots were added to ice-cold R buffer mix containing radiolabeled oligo. Little oligo bound to the U2 snRNP in the zero time quenched reactions even after prolonged incubation (data not shown). To analyze any effect of ATP on oligo binding or GST selection (see below), the reactions were first incubated with 5 mm d-glucose (to deplete ATP) or water at 23 °C for 5 min and then chilled on ice. The binding reaction was then initiated by the addition of radiolabeled oligo to 5 nm and either water or ATP (to 2 mm) and incubated at 23 °C. Quenched samples were fractionated on a 3.2% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel (50:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in TPM8 buffer (48 mm Tris phosphate (pH 8 at 0 °C), 1.5 mm magnesium acetate) at 4 °C for 16–20 h at 5.5–6.7 V/cm. Radiolabeled bands were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated in dried gels with a Molecular Dynamics Storm 840 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software version 5.0. Data were analyzed in Minitab version 13 by the Anderson-Darling test for normal distribution, the Bartlett test for variance homogeneity, one-way ANOVA for comparing means to 100%, and Tukey's multiple ANOVA for all other comparisons of means (50Winer B.J. Brown D.R. Michels K.M. Statistical Principles in Experimental Design. 3rd Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1991Google Scholar, 51Cody R.P. Smith J.K. Applied Statistics and the SAS Programming Language. 4th Ed. Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, NJ1991Google Scholar). Only a 95% confidence level could be calculated for the one-way ANOVA. The data in Figs. 2 B and 8 B were normalized to the 0-min values and analyzed by Tukey's multiple ANOVA comparison.Figure 8The mutant C62U U2 snRNP bound less 2′-OMe oligo than the wild type at the non-permissive temperature. A, 2′-OMe oligo mU2-wt binding in wild type and C62U mutant extracts. WCEs active for splicing were prepared from isogenic wild type and C62U mutant strains grown at the permissive temperature. The WCEs were incubated with radiolabeled oligo mU2-wt and splicing buffer with added ATP at either 23 (lanes 1–6) or 15 °C (lanes 7–12) for the indicated times (min). The reactions were fractionated by native gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Arrowheads B2 and B3 designate bands 2 and 3. B, kinetics of radiolabeled mU2-wt binding to wild type and C62U mutant snRNPs. The amounts of radiolabeled mU2-wt oligo in band 2 from wild type and C62U mutant WCEs were measured in four independent assays as in A. The mean (± S.D.) amount of band 2 at each time is expressed here as the percent of band 2 at 30 min in the presence of added ATP for each extract type. Probability (p) that the means at the two temperatures were equal for each extract type was determined by ANOVA.C, Northern analysis of spliceosomal snRNPs in wild type and C62U mutant extracts. A mock binding assay had water instead of oligo added to the reactions as in A. The mock reactions were separated by native gel electrophoresis after which the RNAs in the gel were detected by Northern analysis with radiolabeled probes specific for the U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5 snRNAs. The bands are designated by their snRNA content.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) RNAs in native and denaturing gels were electrophoretically transferred to PerkinElmer Life Sciences GeneScreen as described previously (52Ruby S.W. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 365-390PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blots were incubated as described previously (52Ruby S.W. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 365-390PubMed Google Scholar) with U-snRNA-specific probes made from DNA fragments amplified by PCR with oligos oSR115–oSR124 and radiolabeled by random deoxyoligo-primed extension (53Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). Reactions for deoxyoligo-mediated RNase H cleavage contained 2.2 mm DTT, 66 mm KPO4(pH 7.4), 3.3% (v/v) PEG8000, 3.3 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, wild type WCE (45% v/v), and either water or the indicated concentrations of the deoxyoligo SRU2, SRU1, or oSR4 (38Ruby S.W.

They were incubated for 30 min at 23 °C. For binding assays, GST selections, or Northern analysis, additional ATP to 2 mm and either water or radiolabeled 2′-OMe oligo was added, and the reactions were further incubated at 23 °C. Protein concentrations in WCE were determined with the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). WCE samples containing 40–126 μg of protein were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto a Millipore Immobilon-P membrane in Towbin buffer containing 0.01% SDS and no methanol (43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Primary mouse anti-GST (Babco) or rabbit anti-Bcy1 antibody (a gift from M. Werner-Washburne, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM) was diluted 1:2000 in antibody buffer (5% nonfat milk, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, and 0.01% Tween 20). The secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences), was diluted 1:10,000 in antibody buffer. Proteins were visualized with chemiluminescent ECL-plus (AmershamBiosciences). Quenched oligo binding reactions were added to an equal volume of packed glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) that had been prepared by washing three times with NET-2 (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40) at 0 °C. The slurry was gently agitated at 0 °C for 30 min and then washed four times with ice-cold NET-2. A 10–20-fold volume of 50 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS was then added, and the RNAs were extracted with hot phenol as described (55Vijayraghavan U. Company M. Abelson J.

Of these chimeras, some displayed a normal response to isolated factor VIII A2 domain as a cofactor in factor X activation. Surprisingly, chimeras containing elongated inter-domain spacers from factor X or VII displayed reduced response to both complete factor VIIIa and the isolated A2 domain. Moreover, these chimeras still displayed effective association with immobilized A2 domain as assessed by surface plasmon resonance.

Proteolysis occurs at restricted cleavage sites and results in the formation of the two-chain enzyme factor IXa (FIXa). FIXa is composed of a light chain that contains an N-terminal Gla domain followed by a short hydrophobic region and two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains (5Roberts H.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The heavy chain comprises the protease domain with the catalytic center. FIXa shares its typical domain structure with related serine proteases of the blood coagulation cascade, including FVIIa, factor Xa (FXa), and activated protein C (6Bode W. Brandstetter H. Mather T. Stubbs M.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 7Banner D.W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 512-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). All of these enzymes contain two EGF-like domains that display considerable sequence homology with the EGF-like modules in factor IXa (8Bottema D.K. Ketterling R.P., Li, S. Yoon H-S. Phillips J.A. Sommer S.S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 49: 820-838PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that these domains are similar in structure and function. Indeed, FIXa, FXa, and FVIIa are similar in that calcium binding to the first EGF-like module is essential for conserving the linkage between its N-terminal half and the N-terminal Gla domain in these proteins (for review, see Ref. 9Stenflo J. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1999; 9: 59-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, with respect to the relative orientations of the two EGF-like modules, the three-dimensional crystal structures reveal that this is different in each of these proteases. The connection between these modules is flexible within the structures of FVIIa and FXa (6Bode W. Brandstetter H. Mather T. Stubbs M.T. Thromb.

Bauer M. Huber R. Lollar P. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9796-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). These include a salt bridge between residues Glu78 in the first EGF-like domain and Arg94 in the second EGF-like domain (15Christophe O.D. Lenting P.J. Kolkman J.A. Brownlee G.G. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and hydrophobic interaction between the regions Phe75-Phe77 and Lys106-Val108 at the interface between both domains (16Celie P.H.N. Lenting P.J. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 229-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The salt bridge is crucial for interaction of FIXa with its cofactor, factor VIIIa (FVIIIa) (15Christophe O.D. Lenting P.J. Kolkman J.A. Brownlee G.G. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), whereas the hydrophobic contact contributes to FIXa enzymatic activity (16Celie P.H.N. Lenting P.J. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 229-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).In the present study, we focused on other FIXa-specific elements that are exposed at the interface between both EGF-like domains, including the sequence Leu84-Thr87 that connects both domains and the loop Asn89-Lys91 at the N-terminal part of the second EGF-like domain. To this end, FIX chimeras were constructed in which these regions were exchanged for the corresponding residues of FX and FVII. The spacer sequence between both EGF-like modules in FIXa, FXa, and FVIIa varies not only in sequence but also in length (4, 6 and 8 residues, respectively). To evaluate whether the length of the connecting segment or the particular amino acid residues therein are important for FIXa function, two additional FIX/FX chimeras were constructed with partial replacements. In one chimera, the FIX residues were replaced by the corresponding number of FX residues, whereas in the second variant the two extra residues of FX were inserted immediately after the FIX spacer. Activated FIX chimeras were characterized with particular reference to enzymatic activity and response to FVIIIa. Our results demonstrate that in particular the junction Leu84-Thr87 between the two EGF-like modules and to some extent also the loop Asn89-Lys91 contribute to respond to the cofactor FVIIIa. For chimeras comprising the complete spacer sequence of FX or FVII, impaired sensitivity to intact FVIIIa was accompanied by a reduced stimulation by the isolated FVIII A2 domain. Our present data support a model in which the various structural elements that comprise the interface between the EGF-like domains serve a variety of factor IXa functions, including the FVIIIa-induced enhancement of enzymatic activity.DISCUSSIONIn the present study we have explored the role of two structure elements that are exposed at the interface between the two EGF-like domains, the small loop Asn89-Lys91 at the N-terminal end of the EGF2 domain and the connection between the two EGF-like domains, residues Leu84-Thr87. Both elements are FIX-specific and are completely different in the related coagulation factors FVII and FX (Fig. 1). The rationale for directing our studies to FIX-specific elements at the junction between the two EGF-like domains was 2-fold. First, the crystal structures reveal that FIX is distinct from FX and FVII in that it contains a variety of inter-domain contacts. These restrict flexibility between the two EGF-like modules to a minimum (6Bode W. Brandstetter H. Mather T. Stubbs M.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 14Brandstetter H. Bauer M. Huber R. Lollar P. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9796-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Second, we have previously demonstrated that such inter-domain contacts support the interaction of FIXa with its cofactor FVIIIa (15Christophe O.D. Lenting P.J. Kolkman J.A. Brownlee G.G. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) or contribute to the enzymatic properties of the protease domain in a FVIII-independent manner (16Celie P.H.N. Lenting P.J. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 229-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It thus seems reasonable to suppose that those contacts might exert their function by structure elements that are exposed at the interface between the two EGF-like modules.In the absence of FVIII, none of the FIX variants that we examined displayed any significant defect in enzymatic activity (Table I). This implies that neither the loop Asn89-Lys91 nor the spacer Leu84-Thr87 supports the enzymatic properties in manner as described for the hydrophobic contact between the regions Phe75-Phe77 and Lys106-Val108 (16Celie P.H.N. Lenting P.J. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 229-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the presence of FVIII, however, the various FIX chimeras indeed displayed reduced activity, varying from only a minor reduction for chimeras with replacements of loop Asn89-Lys91 (Fig. 2 A) to a major defect for chimeras with replacements in the spacer region Leu84-Thr87 (Fig. 2 B). The chimera FIX84–87/FVII, containing the entire spacer sequence from FVII, displayed the most prominent defect. By lacking a response to FVIIIa, this chimera has a phenotype similar to that of FIXa mutants in which the salt bridge between residues Glu78 and Arg94 was disrupted, thus affecting one of the contacts between the two EGF-like modules (14Brandstetter H. Bauer M. Huber R. Lollar P. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9796-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 15Christophe O.D. Lenting P.J. Kolkman J.A. Brownlee G.G. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Previous studies provide evidence that assembly of the FIXa-FVIIIa complex involves two distinct interactions, one between the FIXa protease domain and the FVIII A2 domain (21Kolkman J.A. Lenting P.J. Mertens K. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 28Mathur A. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18477-18486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 29Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and the other between the FIXa light chain and the FVIII A3 domain (23Lenting P.J. Donath M.J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31O'Brien L.M. Medved L.V. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27087-27092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In view of the known Kd values for the individual interactions, we previously proposed that FIXa-FVIII complex assembly is driven by the interaction between the respective light chains of FVIII and FIXa on the phospholipid membrane (32Mertens K. Celie P.H.N. Kolkman J.A. Lenting P.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Our present study (Fig. 3) demonstrates that the same mutants that display reduced activity in the presence of the isolated A2 domain are also defective in response to complete FVIIIa under lipid-free conditions. This suggests a predominant role of the A2 domain in complex assembly when lipids are absent. Further, it is striking that FIXa activity toward FX in the presence of the isolated FVIII A2 domain involves the residues Leu84-Thr87 (Fig. 4). The length of this interdomain spacer, but not its sequence, determines the response to FVIIIa in the absence of lipids (Fig. 3). This is in contrast with the data obtained in the presence of phospholipids, which suggest that both spacer length and sequence contribute to response to FVIIIa (Fig. 2 B). It is of further interest to compare the cofactor effect of intact FVIIIa with that of the isolated FVIII A2 domain in quantitative terms. In the presence of lipids, the isolated A2 domain is more than 20-fold less effective as a cofactor than complete FVIIIa (Table II). This demonstrates that stimulation of FIXa activity is greatly dependent on interaction with a site beyond the FVIII A2 domain, for instance with the major FIXa binding site in the A3 domain of the FVIII light chain (23Lenting P.J. Donath M.J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).One question is whether or not FVIIIa directly interacts with the loop Asn89-Lys91 and the residues Leu84-Thr87 at the EGF1-EGF2 domain interface. It is evident that both these structure elements contribute to FVIII-dependent FX activation in the presence of phospholipids (Fig. 2). In comparison with the domain linker Leu84-Thr87, however, the contribution of loop Asn89-Lys91 is only minor. This opens the possibility that this loop serves another function than FVIII binding. In this regard it is interesting that a FIX chimera with FVII residues in positions 88–99 in the EGF2 domain displays decreased binding to platelets in the presence and absence of FVIII, suggesting a role in assembly of the factor X-activating complex on the platelet membrane (33Wilkinson F.H. Ahmad S.S. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5734-5741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The effect of replacements in the domain linker Leu84-Thr87 is particularly prominent when mutation involves the introduction of extra amino acid residues (Fig. 2 B). These findings do not exclude an indirect effect of the spacer on assembly with FVIIIa, for instance by maintaining the orientation of the EGF1 domain, and perhaps also the Gla domain, in the FIXa light chain. However, our data are also compatible with a direct role of the spacer in FVIIIa binding, which is apparently lost in the absence of phospholipids (Fig. 3). Recently, cross-linking studies demonstrate a direct interaction between a FIXa fragment of residues 68–94 with a synthetic peptide of the FVIII residues 1804–1818 (34Olsen, E. H. N., Roberts, H. R., and Monroe, D. M. (2001) Thromb. Haemostasis 86, (suppl.) (Abstr. 1359)Google Scholar). We previously identified this A3 domain region as a major FIXa binding site in the FVIII light chain (23Lenting P.J. Donath M.J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Lenting P.J. van de Loo J.W. Donath M.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1935-1940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that an interaction between the FVIII A3 domain and the FIXa EGF domain interface provides the molecular basis of the lipid-dependent assembly of the enzyme-cofactor complex.One intriguing finding is that the interdomain spacer Leu84-Thr87 in FIXa plays a role in the enhancement of enzymatic activity by the isolated FVIII A2 domain (Fig. 4) without a concomitant role in the association with the A2 domain (Fig. 5). The predominant role of the helix Arg333-Ser339 in A2 domain binding (21Kolkman J.A. Lenting P.J. Mertens K. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 28Mathur A.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16302-16309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) is supported by our observation that the mutant FIXa-R333Q combines a lack of response to the isolated FVIII A2 domain (Fig 4) with a defect in association with the A2 domain (Fig. 5). In contrast, defective rate enhancement is combined with normal A2 domain binding in FIX variants with mutations in the light chain. Variants of this type do not only comprise the chimeras FIXa84–87/FVII and FIXa85–87/FXFTRKL with their elongated domain spacer but also the substitution mutant FIX-E78K, which lacks the salt bridge between the two EGF-like domains (Fig. 4, Table II). Elongation of the domain spacer may be incompatible with maintaining the salt bridge between residues 78 and 94, which supports the interaction with the FVIII light chain (15Christophe O.D. Lenting P.J. Kolkman J.A. Brownlee G.G. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and the rate enhancement upon assembly with A2 domain (Table II, Fig 4). It may seem confusing that, whereas contacts between the two EGF-like domains are crucial for assembly with FVIII, the entire EGF1 domain may be replaced by that of FVIIa or protein C without major functional implications (27Chang J.-Y. Monroe D.M. Stafford D.W. Brinkhous K.M. Roberts H.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 886-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30Bajaj S.P. Schmidt A.E. Mathur A. Padmanabhan K. Zhong D. Mastri M. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16302-16309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, those chimeras have conserved both the short spacer of FIX and the residue Glu78 in the EGF1 domains of FVII and protein C (15Christophe O.D. Lenting P.J. Kolkman J.A. Brownlee G.G. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Because the interdomain spacer in the FIXa light chain contributes to FVIIIa-induced activity enhancement, it seems reasonable to suppose that contacts between the protease domain and the light chain contribute to this phenomenon. According to the FIXa crystal structure, at least two molecular contacts might link these domains (Fig. 6). These involve residues Asn92 and Phe98 in the FIXa light chain and Tyr295 and Phe299 in the protease domain (Fig. 6). The latter site is closely associated with the FVIII-interactive region Lys301-Gly303 (21Kolkman J.A. Lenting P.J. Mertens K. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and, through hydrophobic contact between Leu300 and Leu330, with the FVIII A2 domain FVIII-interactive region Leu330-Ser339 (21Kolkman J.A. Lenting P.J. Mertens K. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 28Mathur A. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18477-18486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We propose that the FVIIIa-dependent activity of the FIXa protease domain is under control of an allosteric mechanism that involves the interdomain spacer in the FIXa light chain as well as contacts between the light chain and the FIXa protease domain.

To evaluate whether the length of the connecting segment or the particular amino acid residues therein are important for FIXa function, two additional FIX/FX chimeras were constructed with partial replacements. In one chimera, the FIX residues were replaced by the corresponding number of FX residues, whereas in the second variant the two extra residues of FX were inserted immediately after the FIX spacer. Activated FIX chimeras were characterized with particular reference to enzymatic activity and response to FVIIIa. Our results demonstrate that in particular the junction Leu84-Thr87 between the two EGF-like modules and to some extent also the loop Asn89-Lys91 contribute to respond to the cofactor FVIIIa. For chimeras comprising the complete spacer sequence of FX or FVII, impaired sensitivity to intact FVIIIa was accompanied by a reduced stimulation by the isolated FVIII A2 domain. Our present data support a model in which the various structural elements that comprise the interface between the EGF-like domains serve a variety of factor IXa functions, inclu"

Here we have contrasted cell responses to IR and C-1027, a radiomimetic antibiotic that induces DNA strand breaks. At equal levels of DNA double strand breaks, cell lines with inactive ATM or other phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases displayed classical hypersensitivity to IR but not to C-1027. Moreover, phosphorylation of p53 Ser-15 induced by C-1027 was independent of ATM, ATR, or DNA-PK function. We have concluded that the model based on IR studies cannot always be directly applied to DNA damage induced by other strand-scission agents.

The ability of a cell to detect and respond to DNA damage is crucial for its survival. Therefore, a complex network of DNA damage sensors, signal transmitters, and effectors (checkpoints) has evolved in all eukaryota. Checkpoint activation results in a delay in cell cycle progression, induction of DNA repair, and regulation of specific gene expression (1Wang J.Y. Curr. Opin.

In response to DNA damage, the tumor suppressor protein p53 is activated and stabilized by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation of Ser-15 by one or all of these kinases. Following DNA damage induced by IR or other strand-scission agents, ATM phosphorylates p53 on Ser-15 in vitro (8Kim S.T. Lim D.S. Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. J. Biol.

Less is known about ATR, a protein kinase that has been shown to phosphorylate p53 on Ser-15 and Ser-37 in vitro and on Ser-15 in vivo in response to both IR-type (breaks) and UV-type (bulky modification) DNA damage. ATR is probably responsible for the slow kinetic component of damage-induced p53 phosphorylation/accumulation (6Tibbetts R.S. Brumbaugh K.M. Williams J.M. Sarkaria J.N. Cliby W.A. Shieh S.Y. Taya Y.

Recent work has demonstrated that overexpression of catalytically inactive ATR in human cells resulted in hypersensitivity to IR and hydroxyurea as well as in abrogation of a cell cycle checkpoint (15Cliby W.A.

DNA-PK is a multiprotein complex composed of a catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and a heterodimeric (Ku70 and Ku80) DNA binding component (17Leuther K.K. Hammarsten O. Kornberg R.D. Chu G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1114-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In response to DNA strand breaks, the Ku70/Ku80 subunit binds free DNA ends facilitating the DNA binding and activation of DNA-PKcs(18Suwa A. Hirakata M. Takeda Y. Jesch S.A. Mimori T. Hardin J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6904-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In vitro, the activated DNA-PKcs can phosphorylate a variety of proteins involved in DNA damage sensing and/or repair, including p53 on Ser-15 and Ser-37 (19Lees-Miller S.P. Sakaguchi K. Ullrich S.J. Appella E. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Despite the apparent overlap of function between ATM and ATR (and probably DNA-PK), it is widely accepted, based upon IR studies, that DNA double strand breaks are signaled to p53 primarily through ATM kinase (20Li L. Story M. Legerski R.J. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 2001; 49: 1157-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We asked whether the ATM-dependent DNA strand break response pathway(s) is truly universal and have addressed this question by comparing cellular responses to IR and a strand break-inducing compound, C-1027, in wild-type and ATM-deficient cells. C-1027 is a member of the enediyne family of drugs, which are often classified as radiomimetic agents, i.e. DNA-interacting drugs which induce single strand (SSB) and/or double strand (DSB) breaks by free radical attacks on the deoxyribose moieties in DNA (21Xu Y.J. Zhen Y.S. Goldberg I.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5947-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 22Povirk L.F. Mutat. Res. 1996; 355: 71-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). A characteristic feature of C-1027 is its propensity to induce a higher ratio of DNA DSB to SSB as compared with IR. In addition, C-1027 biological effects are similar to IR-induced effects, including reduction of cellular DNA replication, delayed progression through S phase, and G2/M cell cycle block (23Sugimoto Y. Otani T. Oie S. Wierzba K. Yamada Y. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1990; 43: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 24Xu Y.J. Li D.D. Zhen Y.S. Cancer Chemother.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this work, we have assessed the role of ATM, as well as ATR and DNA-PK, in the DNA damage responses induced by the DNA strand-scission agent C-1027 using several human cell lines with either wild-type or absent/inactive damage-activated kinases. We found that wild-type cells respond similarly to DNA damage induced by IR or C-1027. However, ATM-deficient cells were not hypersensitive to C-1027 and did not exhibit radioresistant DNA synthesis after drug treatment, indicating the presence of an active, ATM-independent S phase checkpoint. Moreover, in ATM-deficient cells, IR failed to induce p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation, whereas C-1027 stimulated efficient phosphorylation. Likewise, the effects of C-1027 on cells were not dependent on ATR or DNA-PK status. C-1027 (generously provided by Dr. H. Otani, Taiho Co., Tokushima, Japan) stock solutions (2 mg/ml) were prepared in water and stored at −20 °C. [methyl-3H]Thymidine (48 Ci/mmol) and [2-14C]thymidine (55 mCi/mmol) were from Moravek Biochemicals, Inc. (Brea, CA). Cell culture materials were purchased from Invitrogen. Other reagents were obtained from Sigma. The HCT-116 human colon carcinoma cell line (a gift from Dr. B. Vogelstein, The Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore) was grown in McCoy's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The human fibroblast GM00637H (wild-type, ATM+) and GM05849C (ATM−) cell lines (Coriell Cell Repositories, Camden, NJ) were maintained in Eagle's modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2× non-essential amino acids, 2× essential amino acids, and 2× vitamins. The ATR wild-type (ATRwt) and kinase-dead (ATRkd) transiently transfected human fibroblast cell line GM00847 (a gift from Dr. K. A. Cimprich, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA) was kept in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamine, and 400 μg/ml G-418. The expression of transfected proteins was induced by overnight incubation with 0.1 μg/ml doxycycline. Human glioma cell lines MO59K (wild-type, DNA-PK+) and MO59J (DNA-PK−) (Coriell Cell Repositories) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium: F12K medium (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2× non-essential amino acids. All cell lines were kept at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Cells growing in 35-mm dishes were treated with drugs for 2 h or irradiated on ice at 1.25 Gy/min and then washed and incubated in fresh, drug-free medium. Following a 3-day incubation, dishes were washed and viable cells attached to the dish counted. Cell growth inhibition was calculated by comparing the number of treated cells to non-treated controls. Inhibition of thymidine incorporation was determined as described previously (26Dziegielewski J. Melendy T. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). 14C-prelabeled cells were treated with drugs for the indicated time or irradiated on ice and allowed to recover in warm medium. [methyl-3H]Thymidine was added to a final concentration of 0.2 μCi/ml for the last 30 min of the drug treatment. The acid-insoluble radioactivity in samples was measured using an LS-3800 liquid scintillation counter. Inhibition of thymidine incorporation into cellular DNA was calculated as the ratio of3H to 14C in drug-treated samples compared with non-treated controls. Genomic DNA damage was quantitated as described previously (25McHugh M.M. Woynarowski J.M. Gawron L.S. Otani T. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with some modifications.14C-prelabeled cells were treated with drugs for 2 h or irradiated on ice and harvested immediately (for DNA damage) or incubated in fresh medium for 24 h (for damage repair). Cells were washed and resuspended in 0.5% low melting point agarose, poured into a plug former (250 μl per plug block), and kept at 4 °C until solidified. Plugs containing approximately 3 × 105cells were incubated with 1 mg/ml proteinase K in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 2% sodium sarcosinate, 0.5 mEDTA, pH 8.0) for 24 h at 50 °C, followed by 2 h of incubation with 0.1 mg/ml RNase A at 37 °C in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 0.1 m EDTA. The plugs were loaded into wells of a 0.8% agarose gel. Pulse-field gel electrophoresis was conducted in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA for 68 h at 45 V with a switching time of 60 min, using a ChefDR apparatus (Bio-Rad). The 14C DNA signal from dried gels was analyzed using a PhosphorImager scanner (Amersham Biosciences). Damage to genomic DNA was calculated as a fraction of DNA migrated from the well in treated and non-treated cells (FAR, fraction activity released; Ref. 27DiBiase S.J. Guan J. Curran W.J., Jr. Iliakis G. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 1999; 45: 743-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cells incubated with drugs at 37 °C for 0.5–6 h or irradiated on ice and then allowed to recover for 0.5–6 h at 37 °C were harvested and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. Total cellular extracts were prepared by incubating cells on ice in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 150 mmNaCl, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% Triton X-100, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium o- vanadate, 0.1 mm β- glycerophosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml (each) aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin) for 10 min, followed by two cycles of rapid freeze-thaw in a dry ice/methanol bath. The cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and protein content was determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). To verify phosphorylation, in some experiments the extracts were treated with alkaline calf thymus phosphatase for 1 h at 37 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Equal amounts of protein were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were stained with Ponceau S to ensure equal transfer and then probed with primary antibodies, followed by secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The primary antibodies used were anti-p53 (DO-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-phospho-p53 Ser-15 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), and anti-β-actin (Sigma). Protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence, and the levels of p53 were measured using a personal densitometer (Amersham Biosciences). The ability of C-1027 to stimulate p53 accumulation and phosphorylation was compared with that of ionizing radiation in HCT-116 cells bearing functional p53. Treatment of HCT-116 cells with either IR or C-1027 resulted in an increase in the levels of total p53 protein and p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 1A, the control, mock-treated cells expressed low amounts of non-phosphorylated Ser-15 p53 protein. The levels of p53 protein and Ser-15 phosphorylation were both dependent on the dose of IR or C-1027 (2.5, 7.5, 25 Gy and 0.1, 0.3, and 1 nm, respectively). Similar increases in p53 protein levels and phosphorylation were observed in kinetic studies in which cells were treated with IR (25 Gy) or C-1027 (1 nm) for 0.5, 2, and 6 h (Fig. 1B). To confirm that the similar p53 response in HCT-116 cells is evoked by similar levels of genomic DNA damage induced by both agents, alkaline and neutral comet assays were carried out using cells incubated under the same conditions as p53 accumulation/phosphorylation studies. Assays conducted under alkaline conditions allow the detection of overall DNA damage, including double and single strand breaks, abasic sites, and alkali-labile adducts, whereas under neutral conditions only DNA double strand breaks are detectable. Cells treated with 25 Gy of IR or 1 nm C-1027 exhibited a similar level of both DNA double strand breaks and overall DNA damage (data not shown). Thus, relatively equal amounts of DNA damage induced by two different agents, IR and C-1027, caused similar increases in p53 accumulation and Ser-15 phosphorylation in cells with wild-type p53 and active kinases. An active ATM kinase is known to be required for rapid and efficient p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation in response to IR-induced DNA damage. To test the role of ATM in C-1027-induced p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation, a pair of SV40-transfected human fibroblast GM00637H (ATM+) and GM05849C (ATM−) cell lines was used. Although the presence of viral large T antigen in these cells precludes studies of p53 accumulation, Ser-15 phosphorylation can be readily measured because the level of p53 is stable (6Tibbetts R.S. Brumbaugh K.M. Williams J.M. Sarkaria J.N. Cliby W.A. Shieh S.Y. Taya Y. Prives C. Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Both ATM+ and ATM− cell lines were mock-treated (control) or incubated with 1 nm C-1027 for 2 h (C-1027) or exposed on ice to 25 Gy of IR and postincubated in fresh, warm medium for an additional 2 h (IR). As shown in Fig. 2A, IR and C-1027 were equally efficient in inducing p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation in ATM+ cells. However, only C-1027 was able to stimulate Ser-15 phosphorylation in ATM− cells, although to a lower extent than in ATM+ cells. Calf intestinal phosphatase was used to confirm the phosphorylated state of the p53 Ser15-P band. The level of initial DNA damage in the ATM+ and ATM− cell lines was determined quantitatively using pulse-field gel electrophoresis. As presented in Fig. 2B, treatment with 25 Gy of IR or 1 nm C-1027 induced similar amounts of DNA damage in the tested cell lines. Therefore, the differences observed between C-1027- and IR-induced p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation levels in ATM− cells could not be explained by variances in the level of DNA damage. A characteristic feature of ATM-deficient cells is their hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation. Irradiated ATM− cells cannot activate checkpoints and repair machinery; instead, they proceed with radioresistant DNA synthesis, which results in accumulation of unrepaired DNA, chromosomes breaks, and eventually in cell death. To test the effects of IR and C-1027 on cell growth, ATM+ or ATM− cells were treated with drugs for 2 h or irradiated on ice before being incubated in fresh warm medium for an additional 3 days. Resulting growth curves are presented in Fig. 3A. ATM-deficient cells were hypersensitive to ionizing radiation (sensitivity ratio, 5.5). In contrast, C-1027 was equally active against both cell lines (sensitivity ratio, 1.5), suggesting cellular responses to this drug are ATM-independent. Treatment of ATM+ and ATM− cells with 25 Gy of IR or with 1 nm C-1027 for 2 h led to a decrease in [3H]thymidine incorporation as compared with untreated controls, indicating inhibition of DNA synthesis (Fig. 3B). However, both cell lines were equally sensitive to C-1027-induced inhibition (∼30% of control), while DNA synthesis was more resistant to IR in ATM− than in ATM+ cells (∼70 and 50% of control, respectively). Collectively, these findings demonstrate a marked difference in cellular responses to DNA damage induced by IR and C-1027. To further evaluate similarities and differences between IR- and C-1027-stimulated phosphorylation of p53 Ser-15, the dose and time dependence of phosphorylation were examined in ATM+ and ATM− cell lines. The doses of ionizing radiation ranging from 2.5 to 75 Gy resulted in efficient phosphorylation of p53 Ser-15 in ATM+ cells, whereas the phosphorylation was absent in ATM− cells even at the highest dose (Fig. 4A, left panel). It is worth noting that the level of Ser-15 phosphorylation after a 2-h postincubation remained virtually constant despite the 30-fold dose range. In contrast to this, cells treated with C-1027 (0.1–3 nm) showed a gradual increase in p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation as the drug concentration increased (Fig. 4A, right panel). Additional differences between the abilities of IR and C-1027 to induce phosphorylation of p53 Ser-15 were observed in time course experiments. Ionizing radiation (25 Gy) induced rapid Ser-15 phosphorylation in ATM wild-type cells (ATM+), reaching a plateau after 0.5 h of postirradiation (Fig. 4B, left panel) and a negligible increase in phosphorylation in ATM− cells following up to 2 h of postincubation. However, prolonged incubation (6-h postirradiation) resulted in a p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation level in ATM− cells that was similar to the level in ATM+ cells (data not shown), which is in agreement with previous studies (28Lu X. Lane D.P. Cell. 1993; 75: 765-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 29Canman C.E. Wolff A.C. Chen C.Y. Fornace A.J., Jr. Kastan M.B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5054-5058PubMed Google Scholar). In C-1027-treated cells, p53 Ser-15 was phosphorylated more gradually, reaching a plateau level after 1–2 h of incubation (Fig. 4B, right panel). In addition, similar kinetics of C-1027-induced phosphorylation were observed independently of ATM status of the cells. The relatively slow kinetics of p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation in response to C-1027 treatment pointed to possible involvement of ATR kinase. To investigate the effect of ATR activity on p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation in response to IR- and C-1027-induced damage, the SV40-transformed human fibroblast cell line (GM00847) transfected with doxycycline-inducible ATR wild-type (ATRwt) or ATR kinase-dead (ATRkd) protein was employed (15Cliby W.A. Roberts C.J. Cimprich K.A. Stringer C.M. Lamb J.R. Schreiber S.L. Friend S.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Cells were preincubated with doxycycline for 24 h to induce overexpression (+) or left untreated (−) and then exposed to 25 Gy of IR or 1 nm C-1027 (Fig. 5A). After 2 h of postirradiation or incubation with the drug, there were no detectable differences in phosphorylation levels between cells overexpressing ATRwt and cells overexpressing ATRkd. These findings suggest that ATR alone cannot be responsible for C-1027-induced p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation. To further examine the effects of ATR kinase on cellular responses to IR and C-1027, growth inhibition studies were carried out as described earlier. As shown in Fig. 5B, the overexpression of ATRkd resulted in increased sensitivity to IR (sensitivity ratio, 4.0). However, cells treated with C-1027 demonstrated equal sensitivity (sensitivity ratio, 0.9) to the drug, independent of ATRkd expression. Additionally, growth inhibition studies using cells overexpressing ATRwt protein revealed no differences in sensitivity to either IR or C-1027 (data not shown). Because neither ATM nor ATR activity is exclusively needed for C-1027-stimulated p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation or cell growth inhibition under the conditions tested, the involvement of DNA-PK kinase, the third member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family known to phosphorylate p53 on Ser-15, was investigated. Studies were carried out using a pair of human glioblastoma cell lines, one of them deficient in active DNA-PK protein (MO59J, DNA-PK−) and the other with active kinase (MO59K, DNA-PK+). Treatment with IR (25 Gy) or C-1027 (1 nm for 2 h) stimulated p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation (Fig. 6A) independently of DNA-PK status, indicating that this kinase also is not crucial for Ser-15 phosphorylation. However, cells lacking DNA-PK− were significantly more sensitive to ionizing radiation than DNA-PK+ cells (sensitivity ratio, 4.8). In contrast, there was no difference in sensitivity to C-1027 treatment (sensitivity ratio, 0.8) (Fig. 6B). Post-translational modifications of p53 play a key role in cellular responses to DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation or radiomimetic agents (10Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K.

Currently, the accepted paradigm derived from IR studies is that the presence of DNA damage is signaled to p53 through a protein kinase cascade controlled by ATM and manifests in phosphorylation of Ser-15 from p53 (20Li L. Story M. Legerski R.J. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 2001; 49: 1157-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the disruption of ATM functionality increases cellular sensitivity to DNA strand breaks because of an inability to sense, signal, and/or repair the damage, leading to erroneous DNA replication and ultimately genomic instability and cell death. By comparing IR and the radiomimetic enediyne antibiotic C-1027, we have demonstrated in this work that cellular response to DNA strand breaks could depend on the nature of the damage-inducing agent. In preliminary experiments, HCT-116 cells harboring active DNA damage-dependent kinases and wild-type p53 responded similarly to equal levels of strand breaks induced by IR or C-1027. Based on IR studies, the inactivation of ATM should diminish C-1027-induced p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation and increase C-1027 cytotoxicity. However, in contrast to IR, C-1027 stimulated phosphorylation of p53 Ser-15 in ATM-deficient cells (Fig. 2). Moreover, ATM-deficient cells were not hypersensitive to C-1027 nor did they exhibit radioresistant DNA synthesis after drug treatment (Fig. 3B), indicating the presence of an active and ATM-independent S phase checkpoint. The somewhat lower p53 phosphorylation level observed in ATM− cells could indicate that another kinase(s), which in ATM+ cells cooperates with ATM to achieve fast and efficient p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation, is unable to complete this process alone. It is important to stress that the differences in p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation and radioresistant DNA synthesis induction were observed at IR and drug doses that caused similar amounts of DNA double strand breaks as assessed by quantitative pulse-field gel electrophoresis analysis (Fig. 2B). In addition, because p53 is a stress response protein, the cytotoxic stress induced by IR or C-1027 was kept at comparable levels in phosphorylation experiments. We can therefore conclude that under these conditions the differences in cellular responses to IR or C-1027 were not because of differences in DNA damage or stress levels. The time and dose dependence experiments (Fig. 4) demonstrated that the IR-inducible increase in p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation in ATM+ cells is immediate and readily observed even at the lowest doses used. However, in ATM− cells, p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation was not detected even at the highest doses (75 Gy) following 2 h of incubation. In contrast, although C-1027 induction of p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation was found to be a little slower and less efficient, it was present in both cell lines (ATM+ and ATM−). These findings support the theory that a kinase other than ATM participates in signaling C-1027-induced DNA. Taken together, our data show that ATM is not essential for the signaling of C-1027-induced DNA strand breaks to p53, in contrast to the ATM requirement for signaling IR-induced damage. It has been proposed that the initial, fast stage of IR-induced p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation is controlled by ATM kinase, whereas the second and slower stage is maintained by ATR (6Tibbetts R.S. Brumbaugh K.M. Williams J.M. Sarkaria J.N. Cliby W.A. Shieh S.Y. Taya Y. Prives C. Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar, 15Cliby W.A. Roberts C.J. Cimprich K.A. Stringer C.M. Lamb J.R. Schreiber S.L. Friend S.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 31Durocher D. Jackson S.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The slower, gradual increase over time in Ser-15 phosphorylation in C-1027-treated ATM+ cells, as compared with IR-treated cells, was observed. Similar kinetics of phosphorylation in the drug-treated ATM− cells points to ATR as a kinase involved in C-1027-stimulated p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation. However, ATR also is not sufficient to exclusively mediate the cellular responses to C-1027, since active ATR is not required to phosphorylate p53 Ser-15 in response to C-1027 (Fig. 5). Furthermore, cell lines expressing normal and kinase-dead ATR were equally sensitive to cytotoxic effects of C-1027. In contrast, ATRkd cells were more sensitive to killing by IR, as already demonstrated (15Cliby W.A. Roberts C.J. Cimprich K.A. Stringer C.M. Lamb J.R. Schreiber S.L. Friend S.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Because DNA-PK is also involved in DNA surveillance and repair and is known to phosphorylate p53 on Ser-15, we evaluated p53 phosphorylation and cytotoxic responses to IR and C-1027 in DNA-PK wild-type (DNA-PK+) and DNA-PK-deficient (DNA-PK−) cell lines (Fig. 6). The data show that both treatments were able to induce Ser-15 phosphorylation independently of DNA-PK status. Similar to ATM- and ATR-deficient cell lines, DNA-PK− cells were not hypersensitive to C-1027, although they were hypersensitive to IR, in accordance with previously published results (32Lees-Miller S.P. Godbout R. Chan D.W. Weinfeld M. Day III, R.S. Barron G.M. Allalunis-Turner J. Science. 1995; 267: 1183-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Based on data presented here, we propose a scenario in which C-1027-induced DNA damage can activate both ATM and ATR. In wild-type cells, phosphorylation of p53 Ser-15 could occur through either of the kinases or their cooperative action. However, in cells deficient in one kinase activity, the second active kinase could conduct the phosphorylation. Studies using double-deficient cells (ATM− cells overexpressing ATRkd protein) would be needed to confirm this model. The question arises whether C-1027-induced DNA damage is similar to or different from IR-induced damage and thus is signaled through the same or different pathway(s). The main mechanism of DNA scission by IR or radiomimetic drugs is based on oxidation of deoxyribose in DNA, initiated by hydrogen abstraction at C-1′, C-4′, and/or C-5′ carbon atoms (33Henner W.D. Grunberg S.M. Haseltine W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11750-11754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Dedon P.C. Goldberg I.H. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 311-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In addition to strand breaks, IR produces a multitude of different base and nucleotide damage in DNA, including heterogeneous clustered damage (35Sutherland B.M. Bennett P.V. Sidorkina O. Laval J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8026-8031Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In contrast, radiomimetic drugs usually cause only a subset of the IR-induced DNA damage. C-1027 primarily attacks the deoxyribose C-4′ atom, and to a lesser extent C-1′, and produces both single and double strand breaks by cleaving DNA strands two base pairs apart at specific sequences (5′-TAT and 5′-AGA) (21Xu Y.J. Zhen Y.S. Goldberg I.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5947-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 36Sugiura Y. Matsumoto T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5548-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Radiomimetic drug-induced DNA damage is also more sequence- or region-specific, as opposed to random damage induced by IR (37Beckmann R.P. Agostino M.J. McHugh M.M. Sigmund R.D. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5409-5415Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It has been also shown that using strict anaerobic conditions and high micromolar concentrations, C-1027 can form DNA interstrand cross-links and adducts in vitro (38Xu Y.J., Xi, Z. Zhen Y.S. Goldberg I.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14975-14984Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, these conditions are almost impossible to achieve in cells and are unlikely to contribute to increased p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation in cells treated with C-1027. Another factor for differences in cellular responses to C-1027 as compared with IR is found in the ratios of DSB to SSB induced by a particular treatment. C-1027 is known to produce relatively high levels of double strand damage with DSB/SSB ratios ranging from 1:5 (21Xu Y.J. Zhen Y.S. Goldberg I.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5947-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) to 1:2 (39Kirk C.A. Goodisman J. Beerman T.A. Gawron L.S. Dabrowiak J.C. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 63: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In contrast, IR and other drugs such as neocarzinostatin or bleomycin produce mostly single strand damage on DNA (22Povirk L.F. Mutat. Res. 1996; 355: 71-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 33Henner W.D. Grunberg S.M. Haseltine W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11750-11754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Grimwade J.E. Beerman T.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 30: 358-363PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the DSB induced by these agents are often the results of closely placed SSB, whereas for C-1027, SSB and DSB result from different binding modes of the drug to DNA (21Xu Y.J. Zhen Y.S. Goldberg I.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5947-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Despite differences in chemistry and/or localization of DNA damage between IR and radiomimetic drugs, to the best of our knowledge C-1027 is the only agent able to stimulate p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation and DNA replication inhibition in an ATM− cell line. Reports have been published showing that several other radiomimetic compounds (for example, bleomycin and neocarzinostatin) induced radioresistant DNA synthesis and increased cell death in ATM-deficient cells (41Shiloh Y. van der Schans G.P. Lohman P.H. Becker Y. Carcinogenesis. 1983; 4: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 42Zampetti-Bosseler F. Scott D. Mutat. Res. 1985; 151: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Compared with the related enediyne neocarzinostatin, C-1027 independence on ATM activity for stimulating p53 phosphorylation is somewhat unexpected since we have shown recently that both C-1027 and neocarzinostatin induced similar changes in Replication Protein A (RPA) protein status in the 293 human embryonic kidney cell line (43McHugh M.M. Yin X. Kuo S.R. Liu J.S. Melendy T. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4792-4799Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of the subunit RPA32, presumably by one of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, may modulate DNA replication or repair directly or indirectly through interactions with other proteins, including p53 (44Miller S.D. Moses K. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2194-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 45Abramova N.A. Russell J. Botchan M. Li R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7186-7191Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cells treated with C-1027 and neocarzinostatin at doses causing similar levels of DNA damage responded with equivalent increases in RPA32 hyperphosphorylation and decreased replication activity, suggesting a common response to enediyne-induced DNA damage. However, as presented here, those similarities do not necessarily extend to other types of DNA damage responses. In conclusion, our results indicate that the model for cellular responses to DNA double strand breaks derived from IR studies cannot necessarily be applied to DNA strand breaks induced by other agents. Future studies are needed to relate the type, chemistry, localization, and severity of DNA strand breaks to differences in cellular responses by using a variety of DNA strand-scission agents besides ionizing radiation. C-1027 may be an ideal agent to use in this study, because unlike IR or other radiomimetic drugs it induces relatively high levels of sequence-specific double strand breaks. We thank Drs. David Kowalski, David Goodrich, and Christine M. White from Roswell Park Cancer Institute for careful reading of this manuscript and insightful comments."

Here we tested the role of p38 MAPK in RTK and GPCR agonist-induced DNA synthesis in VSMC. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB and thrombin (RTK and GPCR agonists, respectively) activated p38 MAPK in a time-dependent manner in VSMC. Inhibition of p38 MAPK led to a 50% decrease in the DNA synthesis induced by thrombin but not PDGF-BB. ATF-1 was found to be the predominant member of the cyclic AMP response element (CRE)-DNA complex formed in VSMC in response to PDGF-BB and thrombin, and both agonists induced its phosphorylation. Regardless of this, inhibition of p38 MAPK reduced only thrombin- but not PDGF-BB-induced ATF-1 phosphorylation. Similarly, inhibition of p38 MAPK caused a 50% decrease in thrombin- but not PDGF-BB-induced CRE promoter-dependent transcription. Ectopic expression of an inhibitory anti-ATF-1 single-chain antibody fragment, ScFv, significantly interfered with DNA synthesis induced by thrombin but not PDGF-BB. Together, these results suggest the following conclusions. 1) Both RTK and GPCR agonists activate p38 MAPK and induce CRE promoter-dependent transcription; 2) both RTK and GPCR agonists induce ATF-1 phosphorylation, and ATF-1 is a predominant member in the CRE-DNA complexes formed in response to these agents; and 3) p38 MAPK-dependent ATF-1 phosphorylation and CRE promoter-mediated transcription are associated with GPCR agonist-induced VSMC growth.

These mitogens modulate VSMC growth both in an autocrine and paracrine manner in VSMC (1Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9971) Google Scholar). In addition, in vitrostudies have shown that a variety of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists and of oxidants are potent mitogens to VSMC (5Rao G.N.

Towards understanding the role of specific mitogens in the induction of VSMC growth during the formation of these lesions, several investigators have used neutralizing antibodies and antisense oligonucleotides (4Lindner V. Reidy M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3739-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 7Chaikof E.L. Caban R. Yan C.N. Rao G.N. Runge M.S. J. Biol.

Use of neutralizing antibodies against PDGF or FGF resulted only in partial inhibition of VSMC growth and lesion progression (4Lindner V. Reidy M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3739-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 10Ferns G.A.A. Raines E.W. Sprugel K.H. Motani A.S. Reidy M.A. Ross R. Science. 1991; 253: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Similarly, the use of antisense oligonucleotides against a molecule that appears to be critical in the mitogenic signaling events, such as c-Myc, resulted only in partial inhibition of VSMC growth and lesion progression (11Edelman E.R. Simons M. Sirois M.G. Rosenberg R.D. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 176-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of individual mitogens or proto-oncogenes has so far resulted in minimal reduction in VSMC growth and lesion progression in animal models of atherosclerosis and restenosis. Identification of molecules that are critical in the signaling pathways of several mitogens may provide more successful targets. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are a group of serine/threonine kinases that are ubiquitously expressed (12Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar, 13Davis R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). These are grouped primarily into three major categories, namely 1) extracellular signal-regulated kinases, 2) Jun N-terminal kinases, and 3) p38 MAPKs (13Davis R.J. J. Biol.

Furthermore, differences were observed in the responsiveness of different groups of MAPKs to various external stimuli. Specifically, extracellular signal-regulated kinases have been reported to respond preferentially to agents that induce cell growth and differentiation (15Miao R.Q. Murakami H. Song Q. Chao L.

Despite these differences in responsiveness, cross-talk between different groups of MAPK has been observed in mediating cellular responses to certain agonists (25Burns C.J. Squires P.E. Persaud S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, activation of one or all three groups of MAPKs are involved in the regulation of activities of various transcriptional factors, including activator protein 1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor κB (NFκB) (12Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar). Previously we have demonstrated that activation of p38 MAPK and induction of DNA synthesis in response to RTK and GPCR agonists require NADH/NADPH-like oxidase activity in VSMC (26Rao G.N. Katki K.A.

The purpose of the present investigation was to study the role of p38 MAPK in the induction of growth by both RTK and GPCR agonists in VSMC. We show that 1) both RTK and GPCR agonists activate p38 MAPK in VSMC; 2) although activation of p38 MAPK is not required for PDGF-BB-induced DNA synthesis, it is involved in thrombin-induced DNA synthesis; 3) thrombin- but not PDGF-BB-induced p38 MAPK activation is required for ATF-1 phosphorylation and CRE promoter-dependent transcription; 4) thrombin-stimulated p38 MAPK-dependent ATF-1 phosphorylation and CRE promoter-mediated transcription are associated with growth in VSMC; and 5) disruption of ATF-1 activity by intracellular expression of an inhibitory anti-ATF-1 single-chain antibody fragment, ScFv, interfered with only thrombin but not PDGF-BB-induced DNA synthesis in VSMC. Together, these findings reveal that ATF-1 plays a role in thrombin- but not PDGF-BB-induced VSMC growth.

Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air and 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were growth-arrested by incubating in DMEM containing 0.1% (v/v) FBS for 72 h and used to perform the experiments unless otherwise stated. VSMC with and without appropriate treatments were pulse-labeled with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for the indicated times. After labeling, cells were washed with cold PBS, trypsinized, and collected by centrifugation. The cell pellet was suspended in cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and vortexed vigorously to lyse cells. After standing on ice for 20 min, the cell lysis mixture was passed through a glass fiber filter (GF/C, Whatman). The filter was washed once with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and once with cold 70% (v/v) ethanol. The filter was dried and placed in a liquid scintillation vial containing the scintillant fluid, and the radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (LS 5000TA, Beckman). Nuclear extracts were prepared from VSMC that were subjected to appropriate treatments or left untreated as described previously (26Rao G.N. Katki K.A. Madamanchi N.R., Wu, Y. Birrer M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6003-6010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Protein-DNA complexes were formed by incubating 5 μg of nuclear protein in a total volume of 20 μl consisting of 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 3 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 4.5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 15% glycerol, and 100,000 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe for 30 min on ice. The protein-DNA complexes were then resolved by electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel using 1× Tris-glycine-EDTA buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 200 mm glycine, 0.1 mm EDTA). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase kit following the supplier's protocol (Invitrogen). The construction of ScFv-anti-ATF-1 has been described previously (27Jean D. Tellez C. Huang S. Davis D.W. Bruns C.J. McConkey D.J. Hinrichs S.H. Bar-Eli M.

VSMC were plated evenly onto 60-mm dishes the day before transfection and grown in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected with appropriate plasmid DNA (20 μg/60-mm dish) using calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (26Rao G.N. Katki K.A. Madamanchi N.R., Wu, Y. Birrer M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6003-6010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with PBS 16 h after transfection and incubated in DMEM containing 0.1% (v/v) FBS for 36 h at 37 °C. Cells were then treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) or thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) for the indicated times, and cell lysates were prepared. Cell lysates normalized for protein were assayed for either CAT activity using [14C]chloramphenicol and acetyl-coenzyme A as substrates or luciferase activity using Luciferase assay system (Promega) and a Turner luminometer (TD-20/20). After appropriate treatments, VSMC were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Cells were lysed by thawing in 250 μl of lysis buffer (PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and scraped into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. After standing on ice for 20 min the cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein content of the supernatants was determined using Micro BCA™ protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein were resolved by electrophoresis on 0.1% SDS and 10% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond, Amersham Biosciences). After blocking in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mmsodium chloride, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, the membrane was treated with appropriate primary antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The antigen-antibody complexes were detected using a chemiluminescence reagent kit (Amersham Biosciences). All the experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. Data on luciferase activity and [3H]thymidine incorporation were presented as mean ± S.D., and the treatment effects were analyzed by Student'st test. p values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. In the case of CAT assay, EMSA, and Western blot analysis, one representative set of data is shown. Previously we have demonstrated that activation of p38 MAPK and induction of DNA synthesis in response to RTK and GPCR agonists require NADH/NADPH-like oxidase activity in VSMC (26Rao G.N. Katki K.A. Madamanchi N.R., Wu, Y. Birrer M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6003-6010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Here we have tested the role of p38 MAPK in RTK and GPCR agonist-induced VSMC growth. Lysates of VSMC that were treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) or thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) were analyzed by Western blotting for phosphorylated p38 MAPK using its phosphospecific antibodies. Both PDGF-BB and thrombin activated p38 MAPK in VSMC in a time-dependent manner with a maximum effect of 10-fold at 30 min and declining thereafter (Fig.1A). To confirm these observations, lysates of VSMC that were treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) or thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) for 30 min were immunoprecipitated with anti-p38 MAPK antibodies and the immunocomplexes were assayed for p38 MAPK activity using recombinant ATF-2 and [γ-32P]ATP as substrates in the presence and absence of SB203580 (10 μm), a potent inhibitor of p38 MAPK. As expected, both PDGF-BB and thrombin increased p38 MAPK activity, and it was completely inhibited by SB203580 (Fig.1B). To learn whether p38 MAPK plays a role in PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced VSMC growth, we tested the effect of SB203580 on DNA synthesis induced by these agonists. Quiescent VSMC were treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) or thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) in the presence and absence of SB203580 (10 μm), and DNA synthesis was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material. PDGF-BB and thrombin stimulated VSMC DNA synthesis 3–5-fold, and SB203580 inhibited 50% of the thrombin-induced, but not PDGF-BB-induced, DNA synthesis (Fig.2).FIG. 2Effect of SB203580 on PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced DNA synthesis in VSMC. Quiescent VSMC were treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) or thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) in the presence and absence of SB203580 (10 μm) for 24 h, and DNA synthesis was measured by pulse-labeling cells with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for the last 2 h of the 24-h incubation period and counting the trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity. *, p < 0.01versus control; **, p < 0.01versus thrombin treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Earlier studies from other laboratories have reported that p38 MAPK plays a role in c-Fos gene induction in response to cytokines and ultraviolet B light in some cell types (28Chen W. Bowden G.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 29Janknecht R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1620-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 30Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). Therefore, to understand the mechanism by which p38 MAPK participates in thrombin-induced DNA synthesis, we studied its role in PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced expression of the Fos and Jun family proteins. Lysates of VSMC that were treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) or thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) in the presence and absence of SB203580 (10 μm) for 2 h were analyzed for Fos and Jun family proteins using their specific antibodies. PDGF-BB and thrombin induced expression of c-Fos, Fra-1, c-Jun, and Jun-B by 10- to more than 100-fold (Fig. 3). Interestingly, Fos-B expression was induced more potently (>100-fold) by thrombin than by PDGF-BB. Other RTK agonists, such as epidermal growth factor (50 ng/ml) and basic FGF (50 ng/ml), also failed to induce the expression of Fos-B (data not shown), indicating that GPCR agonists specifically induce the expression of this proto-oncogene product. Jun-D is expressed constitutively in VSMC, and its levels were increased 3-fold in response to PDGF-BB and thrombin. SB203580, while having no effect on c-Fos, Fos-B, and c-Jun induction, inhibited Fra-1 expression induced by both PDGF-BB and thrombin and Jun-B and Jun-D expression induced by thrombin only. The Fos and Jun family proteins form the transcriptional factor, AP-1, which has been shown to play an important role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (31Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). Because inhibition of p38 MAPK depleted the levels of Jun-B and Jun-D in thrombin-treated cells, we suspected a role for AP-1 in p38 MAPK-dependent thrombin-induced growth in these cells. To address this we first determined the composition of AP-1 in PDGF-BB and thrombin-treated VSMC. Quiescent VSMC were treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) or thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) for 2 h, and nuclear proteins were isolated. Equal amounts of nuclear protein from control and agonist-treated VSMC were analyzed for AP-1-DNA binding activity by EMSA, using a 32P-labeled AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide probe. AP-1-DNA binding activity was increased by both PDGF-BB and thrombin compared with control (Fig.4A). Supershift EMSA for each of the Fos and Jun family proteins showed the presence of c-Fos, Fos-B, Fra-1, Jun-B, and Jun-D in the AP-1 complexes formed in response to both PDGF-BB and thrombin, although their levels differed between the two treatments (Fig. 4, B–D, F, and G). Fra-1, Jun-B, and Jun-D were present in the AP-1 complexes formed in response to both PDGF-BB and thrombin. Fos-B was present more abundantly in thrombin-induced AP-1 complexes. Consistent with the Western blot analyses, inhibition of p38 MAPK by SB203580 resulted in reduced amounts of Fra-1 and Jun-B in the AP-1 complexes formed in response to PDGF-BB and thrombin. Previously, we have reported that Jun-B forms the majority of the AP-1 complex in VSMC in response to PDGF-BB and thrombin and in concert with c-Fos drives AP-1-responsive reporter gene expression (26Rao G.N. Katki K.A. Madamanchi N.R., Wu, Y. Birrer M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6003-6010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Because SB203580 significantly reduced the expression of Jun-B and Fra-1 and thereby their levels in AP-1 complexes, we wanted to examine whether these decreases have any impact on PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced AP-1-responsive reporter gene expression. VSMC were transiently transfected with an AP-1-responsive reporter plasmid, pCOLL-CAT, growth-arrested, treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) or thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) in the presence and absence of SB203580 for 4 h and cell lysates prepared. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein were assayed for CAT activity using coenzyme A and [14C]chloramphenicol as substrates. As shown in Fig.5, both PDGF-BB and thrombin induced AP-1-responsive CAT expression in VSMC by 1.8–2.4-fold. Inhibition of p38 MAPK, while causing a 50% reduction in thrombin-induced DNA synthesis, attenuated only the basal but not the PDGF-BB- or thrombin-induced AP-1-responsive reporter gene expression. This result suggests that p38 MAPK mediates thrombin-induced VSMC growth independent of its effects on AP-1.FIG. 4Effect of SB203580 on PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced AP-1-DNA binding activity and its composition.Panel A, equal amounts of nuclear protein from VSMC that were treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) or thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) in the presence and absence of SB203580 (10 μm) for 2 h were incubated with 100,000 cpm of 32P-labeled AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide probe, and the protein-DNA complexes were separated by PAGE and subjected to autoradiography.

Inoue H. Bowden G.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5164-5172Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To test the role of p38 MAPK in CRE-dependent gene expression and its role in VSMC growth, we next studied the effect of PDGF-BB and thrombin on CRE activity. Quiescent VSMC were treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) or thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) in the presence and absence of SB203580 (10 μm) for 2 h, and nuclear proteins were prepared and analyzed by EMSA and supershift EMSA for CRE-DNA binding activity and CRE constituents, respectively. Both PDGF-BB and thrombin induced CRE-DNA binding activity, and SB203580 inhibited ∼60% of the thrombin-induced, but not PDGF-BB-induced, CRE-DNA binding activity (Fig. 6). Supershift EMSA using anti-ATF-1 antibodies revealed that ATF-1 constitutes most of the PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced CRE-DNA complexes. Use of anti-CREB-1 or anti-ATF-2 antibodies neither abolished nor caused a supershift of the CRE-DNA binding activity (data not shown). However, the lack of effect of anti-CREB-1 or anti-ATF-2 antibodies to cause a supershift or abolish the CRE-DNA binding activity does not rule out the presence of these transcriptional factors in the complexes. To confirm CRE-dependent transactivation, VSMC were transfected with a CRE-LUC reporter plasmid, growth-arrested, treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) or thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) in the presence and absence of SB203580 (10 μm) for 4 h, and cell lysates prepared. Cell lysates from control and each treatment were assayed for luciferase activity. Both PDGF-BB and thrombin induced CRE-dependent luciferase activity (Fig. 7). SB203580 blocked only the thrombin-increased luciferase activity by ∼50%. To delineate the mechanism underlying this, quiescent VSMC were treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) or thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) in the presence and absence of SB203580 (10 μm) for 30 min and cell lysates were prepared. Equal amounts of protein from control and each treatment were analyzed for the phosphorylation state of CREB-1 and ATF-1 using a phosphospecific antibody that recognizes both the phosphoproteins. Both PDGF-BB and thrombin induced phosphorylation of CREB-1 and ATF-1 (Fig.8). PDGF-BB and thrombin had no significant effect on the levels of CREB-1 or ATF-1, suggesting that the increase in the phosphorylation of these transcriptional factors was not because of an increase in their levels (data not shown). SB203580, while inhibiting both PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced CREB-1 phosphorylation, blocked 50% of thrombin-induced ATF-1 phosphorylation only. To obtain additional evidence for the role of ATF-1 in thrombin-induced DNA synthesis, ATF-1 and CREB-1 activities were down-regulated by intracellular expression of an inhibitory anti-ATF-1 single-chain antibody fragment (ScFv) or a dominant negative mutant of CREB-1, respectively, growth-arrested, treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) or thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) for 24 h, and DNA synthesis measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation. Ectopic expression of ScFv but not the dominant negative mutant of CREB-1 attenuated the DNA synthesis induced by thrombin (Fig.9). DNA synthesis induced by PDGF-BB was not inhibited.FIG. 7Effect of SB203580 on PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced CRE-dependent reporter gene expression in VSMC.

A role for p38 MAPK in cell growth has been reported previously (34Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The present study, however, shows that p38 MAPK plays a differential role in the induction of VSMC growth by RTK and GPCR agonists. The most intriguing finding of the present study is the phosphorylation of ATF-1, a transcriptional factor that belongs to the leucine zipper family of proteins (35Montminy M.R. Bilezikjian L.M. Nature. 1987; 328: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 36Lanschultz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2534) Google Scholar). ATF-1, like CREB, binds to a consensus motif 5′-TGACGTCA-3′ in the promoter region of genes and activates transcription. These transcriptional factors contain a kinase-inducible transactivation domain that possesses consensus phosphorylation sites for several kinases including protein kinase A (37Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1988; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2052) Google Scholar). In fact, several kinases, including calcium calmodulin kinase IV (38Matthews R.P. Guthrie C.R. Wailes L.M,. Zhao X. Means A.R. McKnight S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6107-6116Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (39Xing J. Ginty D.D. Grennberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar), have been reported to phosphorylate and activate CREB. Although CREB/ATF-1 family proteins have been extensively studied for their role in cAMP and Ca2+-responsive gene regulation, their role in cell growth is less clear. The absence of ATF-1 in normal melanocytes and its detection in metastatic melanoma cells, however, suggest that this transcriptional factor may be involved in the regulation of cell growth (40Bohm M. Moellmann G. Cheng E. Alvarez-Franco M. Wagner S. Sassone-Corsi P. Halaban R. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 291-302PubMed Google Scholar). The most convincing evidence for the role of ATF-1 and its related protein CREB in cell growth comes from depletion studies (27Jean D. Tellez C. Huang S. Davis D.W. Bruns C.J. McConkey D.J.

Ectopic expression of single-chain antibody fragment of ATF-1 or dominant negative mutant of CREB-1 inhibited the tumor growth and metastasis of human melanoma cells and the survival of these cells, respectively (27Jean D.

CREB/ATF-1 transcription factors form homodimers or heterodimers with members of the Jun family proteins, and they preferentially bind to CRE (31Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar, 43DeGraeve F. Bahr A. Sabapathy K.T. Hauss C. Wagner E.F. Kedinger C. Chatton B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3491-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Despite the presence of both CREB-1 and ATF-1 in VSMC, only ATF-1 was found in the CRE-DNA complexes formed in response to PDGF-BB and thrombin in these cells. This result implies that ATF-1 exists as either homodimers or heterodimers with other transcriptional factors, such as Jun-B or Jun-D. Although both PDGF-BB and thrombin stimulated ATF-1 phosphorylation, only thrombin-induced phosphorylation was sensitive to p38 MAPK. This finding also suggests that ATF-1 phosphorylation induced by PDGF-BB is independent of p38 MAPK. Regardless of the mechanisms of its phosphorylation, ATF-1 is present both in PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced CRE-DNA complexes. If it was involved in growth induced by both agonists, then inhibition of its activity via ectopic expression of its single-chain antibody should have interfered with the DNA synthesis induced by both PDGF-BB and thrombin and not the latter only. It is possible that, although it is the predominant component in PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced CRE-DNA complexes, it may exist as heterodimers with different Jun family proteins in response to PDGF-BB and thrombin and that the ATF-1 complex in GPCR agonist-treated cells is involved in growth induction. PDGF-BB and thrombin also stimulated the phosphorylation of CREB-1 in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner. CREB-1 phosphorylation by PDGF-BB and thrombin, although mediated by p38 MAPK, appears not to be on the path to growth stimulation. The lack of a role for p38 MAPK-dependent CREB-1 phosphorylation in the induction of growth was further confirmed by the inability of its dominant negative mutant to suppress either PDGF-BB- or thrombin-induced DNA synthesis in VSMC. It was recently reported that CREB plays an important role in VSMC differentiation-specific gene regulation (44Klemm D.J. Watson P.A. Frid M.G. Dempsey E.C. Schaack J. Colton L.A. Nesterova A.

This study further showed that CREB is a negative regulator of VSMC growth. The present findings are consistent with these observations. CREB/ATF-1 act as survival factors in metastatic melanoma cells (27Jean D. Tellez C. Huang S. Davis D.W. Bruns C.J. McConkey D.J. Hinrichs S.H. Bar-Eli M.

In addition, the expression of the thrombin receptor (protease-activated receptor-1) is directly correlated with the metastatic ability of human melanoma cells (46Nierodzik M.L. Chen K.

Pigment Cell Res. 2001; 14: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Our observation that thrombin-induced p38 MAPK-dependent ATF-1 phosphorylation is involved in DNA synthesis may provide a mechanism by which thrombin receptor (protease-activated receptor-1) contributes to the growth of VSMC and tumor cells. In summary, in the present study we demonstrate for the first time that p38 MAPK plays a selective role in GPCR agonist-induced VSMC DNA synthesis via phosphorylating and activating ATF-1. We thank Dr. Michael Karin for his generosity in providing us with pCOLL-CAT plasmid. While this paper was under review, a study from other laboratories reported that p38 MAPK plays a role in angiotensin II- and 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid-induced hypertrophy in VSMC via a mechanism involving CREB (45Reddy M.A. Thimmalapura P.R.

To quantitatively estimate the contribution of the hydration structure to protein stability, a series of hydrophilic mutant human lysozymes (Val to Ser, Tyr, Asp, Asn, and Arg) modified at three different positions on the surface, which are located in the α-helix (Val-110), the β-sheet (Val-2), and the loop (Val-74), were constructed. Their thermodynamic parameters of denaturation and crystal structures were examined by calorimetry and by x-ray crystallography at 100 K, respectively. The introduced polar residues made hydrogen bonds with protein atoms and/or water molecules, sometimes changing the hydration structure around the mutation site. Changes in the stability of the mutant proteins can be evaluated by a unique equation that considers the conformational changes resulting from the substitutions. Using this analysis, the relationship between the changes in the stabilities and the hydration structures for mutant human lysozymes substituted on the surface could be quantitatively estimated. The analysis indicated that the hydration structure on protein surface plays an important role in determining the conformational stability of the protein.

Careri G. Adv. Protein Chem. 1991; 41: 37-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 2Levitt M. Park B.H. Structure. 1993; 1: 223-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). These water molecules produce the hydration structure on the protein surface by forming hydrogen bonds with protein atoms and/or other water molecules (3Nakasako M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 547-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 4Biswal B.K. Sukumar N. Vijayan M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 20: 1110-1119Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because most of the ordered water molecules are found to interact with protein atoms, it is believed that the hydration structure is almost an integral part of the protein (5Sukumar N. Biswal B.K. Vijayan M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 934-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The hydration structures might affect protein stability, but the degree that the hydration structures contribute to protein stability has been unknown. X-ray crystallography is one of several useful techniques for investigating the hydration structures of proteins. The hydration structure of proteins has been investigated by crystallographic experiments at ambient temperature (6Saenger W. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1987; 16: 93-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 7Teeter M.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 577-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 8Finer-Moore J.S. Kossiakoff A.A. Hurley J.H. Earnest T. Stroud R.M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1992; 12: 203-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, most of the crystallographic studies at ambient temperature have been concerned with only stable hydration structures. The mobile hydration water molecules show no appreciable peaks in the scattering density maps. A recent cryogenic method (9Hope H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Sci. 1988; 44: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 10Hope H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1990; 19: 107-126Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 11Earnest T. Fauman E. Craik C.S. Stroud R. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 10: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 12Garman E.F. Schneider T.R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 211-237Crossref Scopus (335) Google Scholar) has provided detailed and systematic analyses of entire hydration structures (3Nakasako M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 547-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The cryogenic crystal structures reveal the details of the hydration structures resulting from the decrease in the thermal vibrations at low temperature (3Nakasako M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 547-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 13Nagata C. Moriyama H. Tanaka N. Nakasako M. Yamamoto M. Ueki M. Oshima T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As the first step in understanding the contribution of the hydration structure to protein stability, the relationship between the changes in stability and hydration structure resulting from the amino acid substitution on the protein surface, measured by physicochemical experiments and cryogenic x-ray analysis, respectively, should be elucidated. Mutagenesis studies have shown that the contribution of the substitutions on the surface position to the protein stability is not negligible, but on the average is somewhat smaller than in the interior (14Schwehm J.M. Kristyanne E.S. Biggers C.C. Stites W.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6939-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Cordes M.H.J. Sauer R.T. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Perl D. Mueller U. Heinemann U. Schmid F.X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 380-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). However, because an amino acid substitution affects the contribution of not only the hydration structure but also various stabilization factors to the conformational stability, the contribution of the hydration structure to protein stability cannot be simply estimated. In fact, the contributions of even the same kind of substitutions on the surface of proteins to their stabilities have been changed depending on the environment of the mutation sites (14Schwehm J.M. Kristyanne E.S. Biggers C.C. Stites W.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6939-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Considering these facts, systematic surveys are necessary to understand the role of the hydration structure. Human lysozyme (130 residues), which has been extensively examined (17Yutani K. Takano K. Funahashi J. Kuwajima K. Arai M. Old and New Views of Protein Folding. Elsevier, New York1999: 175-184Google Scholar), is a good model protein for the study of systematic mutants. The contributions of several stabilization factors to the stabilities of mutant human lysozymes have been evaluated by a unique equation considering the conformational changes caused by the substitutions (18Funahashi J. Takano K. Yamagata Y. Yutani K. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Funahashi J. Takano K. Yamagata Y. Yutani K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14448-14456Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Takano K. Yamagata Y. Funahashi J. Hioki Y. Kuramitsu S. Yutani K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12698-12708Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this study, three different positions (Val-2, Val-74, and Val-110) on the surface of the human lysozyme were focused on. These positions are located in different secondary structures (β-sheet, loop, and α-helix, respectively), and 72, 75, and 71% of the residues are exposed, respectively. In our previous study (19Funahashi J. Takano K. Yamagata Y. Yutani K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14448-14456Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the hydrophobic mutants (Val to Gly, Ala, Ile, Leu, Met, or Phe) substituted at these three positions have been examined. The results have shown that the local hydration structures of the mutant proteins, the stability changes of which cannot be explained by the contribution of several stabilization factors, were significantly affected by the substitutions. To quantitatively evaluate the contribution of the hydration structures, a series of hydrophilic mutants replaced with Ser, Tyr, Asp, Asn, or Arg at Val-2, Val-74, and Val-110, were constructed. The thermodynamic parameters for denaturation of the mutant proteins were determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC),1 and the crystal structures were determined by cryogenic x-ray analysis at 100 K. Various changes in the hydration structure resulting from the interaction between these polar residues and water molecules around the mutation sites were observed. The role of surface hydrophilic residues and hydration structures in the conformational stability of a protein will be discussed along with the changes in the stability and structure caused by the substitution. The mutagenesis, expression, and purification of the mutant human lysozymes were performed as described previously (21Takano K. Ogasahara K. Kaneda H. Yamagata Y. Fujii S. Kanaya E. Kikuchi M. Oobatake M. Yutani K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 62-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Only one mutant, V110S, could not be obtained because there was no occurrence during the transformation of the yeast. The protein concentration was spectrophotometrically determined usingE1%1 cm = 25.65 at 280 nm for the mutant human lysozymes (22Parry R.M. Chandan R.C. Shahani K.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 130: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), except for the Tyr-substituted mutants. The concentration of the Tyr mutant proteins were spectrophotometrically determined usingE1%1 cm = 26.59 at 280 nm with a correction for the increase in the molar absorption coefficient of Tyr (23Wetlaufer D.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1962; 17: 303-390Crossref Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Calorimetric measurements and data analyses were carried out as described previously (21Takano K. Ogasahara K. Kaneda H. Yamagata Y. Fujii S. Kanaya E. Kikuchi M. Oobatake M. Yutani K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 62-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For the measurements, a DASM4 adiabatic microcalorimeter equipped with an NEC personal computer was used. The sample buffer for measurements was 0.05 mGly-HCl. Each protein was measured from three to five times at different pH points between pH 2.6 and 3.5. At each condition, one measurement was done. The data analysis was done using Origin software (MicroCal, Inc., Northampton, MA). The thermodynamic parameters for denaturation as a function of temperature were calculated using the following equations (24Privalov P.L. Khechinashvili N.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 665-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). ΔH(T)=ΔH(Td)−ΔCp(Td−T)(Eq. 1) ΔS(T)=ΔH(Td)/Td−ΔCpln(Td/T)(Eq. 2) ΔG(T)=ΔH(T)−TΔS(T)(Eq. 3) The ΔCp values in these equations were assumed to be independent of temperature between 20 and 80 °C. The mutant human lysozymes were crystallized as described elsewhere (21Takano K. Ogasahara K. Kaneda H. Yamagata Y. Fujii S. Kanaya E. Kikuchi M. Oobatake M. Yutani K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 62-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 25Yamagata Y. Kubota M. Sumikawa Y. Funahashi J. Takano K. Fujii S. Yutani K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9355-9362Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All crystals belong to space group P212121 with a crystal form identical to that of the wild type and of most mutant proteins. The intensity data were collected at 100 K by the oscillation method on a Rigaku RAXIS IV imaging plate mounted on a Rigaku RU300 for V2Y, V2N, V2R, V74Y, V74N, V74R, V110N, and V110R, and by synchrotron radiation at the SPring-8 on beamline 40B2 with a Rigaku RAXIS IV (Harima, Japan; Proposal 2000A0346-CL-np) for V2S, V2D, V74D, V110Y, and V110D. The data were processed by the program DENZO (26Otwinowski Z. DENZO Data Processing Package. Yale University, New Haven, CT1990Google Scholar) for V2Y, V2R, V74Y, V74R, and V110R and with the software provided by Rigaku for the other mutants. Their structures were solved by the isomorphous method using the program X-PLOR (27Brunger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) as described previously (21Takano K. Ogasahara K. Kaneda H. Yamagata Y. Fujii S. Kanaya E. Kikuchi M. Oobatake M. Yutani K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 62-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 25Yamagata Y. Kubota M. Sumikawa Y. Funahashi J. Takano K. Fujii S. Yutani K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9355-9362Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The data set for V74S has been collected, and its structure has been solved at 100 K (28Takano K. Ota M. Ogasahara K. Yamagata Y. Nishikawa K. Yutani K. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 663-672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Detection of solvent molecules was done using the program FLAPPER (21Takano K. Ogasahara K. Kaneda H. Yamagata Y. Fujii S. Kanaya E. Kikuchi M. Oobatake M. Yutani K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 62-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), 2S. Fujii, unpublished data. as described previously (19Funahashi J. Takano K. Yamagata Y. Yutani K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14448-14456Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The criteria for selecting solvent molecules were to have hydrogen bonding geometry contacts of 2.4–3.5 Å with protein atoms or with the existing solvent, excluding contacts to carbon atoms within 3.2 Å, to have temperature factors of less than 45 Å2, and to have electron densities of more than 2.5 ς level in Fo − Fc maps, as described previously (19Funahashi J. Takano K. Yamagata Y. Yutani K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14448-14456Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Takano K. Ogasahara K. Kaneda H. Yamagata Y. Fujii S. Kanaya E. Kikuchi M. Oobatake M. Yutani K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 62-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 25Yamagata Y. Kubota M. Sumikawa Y. Funahashi J. Takano K. Fujii S. Yutani K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9355-9362Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The sites of residues 2, 74, and 110 in the molecule are not directly involved in crystal contacts. For analysis of hydration sites, water molecules in the wild-type structure were considered to be conserved in mutant structures when a water molecule was found in a mutant structure within 1.3-Å distance from the position at which the water molecule found in the wild-type structure (3Nakasako M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 547-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The mutant proteins analyzed were V2X, V74X, and V110X, where X means G, A, I, L, M, F, S, Y, D, N, and R (19Funahashi J. Takano K. Yamagata Y. Yutani K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14448-14456Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The distance 1.3 Å corresponds to the half of the typical hydrogen bond distance. The hydrophilic mutant proteins substituted at position 2 (V2S, V2Y, V2D, V2N, V2R), position 74 (V74S, V74Y, V74D, V74N, V74R), and position 110 (V110Y, V110D, V110N, V110R) were examined. Only one mutant, V110S, could not be obtained (see “Experimental Procedures”). To determine their thermodynamic parameters of denaturation, differential scanning calorimetry measurements were done at acidic pH between 2.6 and 3.5 where the denaturation of the human lysozyme is reversible. Table I shows the denaturation temperature (Td), the calorimetric enthalpy (ΔHcal), and the van't Hoff enthalpy (ΔHvH) of each measurement for the mutant proteins. The thermodynamic parameters of denaturation at a constant temperature (64.9 °C) and pH 2.7 were calculated using Equations(Eq. 1), (Eq. 2), (Eq. 3) (see “Experimental Procedures”), as shown in Table II. The hydrophilic mutant proteins substituted at Val-2 were destabilized (ΔΔG = –5.9 to –1.5 kJ/mol), those at Val-74 were somewhat less destabilized (ΔΔG = –1.8 to –0.3 kJ/mol), and those at Val-110 were slightly stabilized (ΔΔG = –0.6 to 3.7 kJ/mol). These trends have also been shown in the hydrophobic mutants substituted at the same positions (19Funahashi J. Takano K. Yamagata Y. Yutani K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14448-14456Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Table IDSC data for denaturation of mutant human lysozymes at different pH valuesResidues at each positionPosition 2Position 74Position 110pHTd1-aThe error is ±0.1 °C.ΔHcal1-bThe error is ±13 kcal/mol.ΔHvH1-bThe error is ±13 kcal/mol.pHTd1-aThe error is ±0.1 °C.ΔHcal1-bThe error is ±13 kcal/mol.ΔHvH1-bThe error is ±13 kcal/mol.pHTd1-aThe error is ±0.1 °C.ΔHcal1-bThe error is ±13 kcal/mol.ΔHvH1-bThe error is ±13 kcal/mol.°CkJ/molkJ/mol°CkJ/molkJ/mol°CkJ/molkJ/molSer2.6559.44314312.611-cThe data for this mutant have been measured (28).62.14394602.8362.94524482.8366.04564813.0967.14814773.2872.24905101-dThis mutant protein was not obtained (see “Experimental Procedures”).3.2469.44944983.4573.0519527Tyr2.8365.94524612.6763.34354352.6663.34444402.9167.44654692.8266.94614652.8567.34654653.2072.34985023.0270.04814862.9869.34774773.2172.05025023.2173.35025023.1872.25025073.2473.05075113.2674.15115153.3875.4523523Asp2.6659.64314182.6061.74314602.6363.93784522.9664.94694522.8365.94484812.8467.94054693.0165.74734562.9868.14694943.0070.44315023.1468.04854733.1070.14815153.1372.44405113.3070.25024943.2572.55025313.3475.5452523Asn2.6059.14354182.6563.04604772.6464.04524562.8262.74604392.8466.24774852.8367.24734812.9164.34734563.1871.55065153.0470.64944943.0166.34904643.1371.75025103.2269.3506485Arg2.6062.14314602.6663.84274192.7268.24444562.8866.44524812.8567.34524402.8069.34524612.9968.64695023.0069.54694563.0172.84774863.1570.74775153.1872.84904773.1575.04905023.3074.15025273.2273.24944861-a The error is ±0.1 °C.1-b The error is ±13 kcal/mol.1-c The data for this mutant have been measured (28Takano K.

Open table in a new tab The changes in enthalpy, ΔH, upon mutation were also substantially different from each other, depending on the structural feature of the mutations sites. In most cases, however, the large enthalpy changes were offset by the entropy changes. Therefore, under the existing circumstances, no correlation between the changes in enthalpy and structural changes upon mutation was found. For instance, the ΔH value of V110D was the smallest among the mutants in this study, 386 kJ/mol, whereas that of the wild-type protein was 477 kJ/mol (Table II). This unfavorable enthalpy term might be compensated by the favorable entropy term because this mutant protein was stabilized by 0.7 kJ/mol as a result of the substitution. These quite large changes in entropy and enthalpy might be caused by the change in the structural features, but the structural change in this mutant was quite small. The data collection and refinement statistics for the hydrophilic mutant human lysozymes are summarized in Table III. As described above, all of the intensity data were collected at 100 K. Although the wild-type structure at 100 K seemed to be the same fold as the wild-type structure at 283 K, the B-factors for the protein atoms and the water molecules at 100 K were significantly smaller than those at 283 K (19Funahashi J.

Open table in a new tab Many of the detected water molecules interacted with the protein atoms and each other via hydrogen bonds. The hydration water molecules formed aggregates of various shapes and dimensions, and some of the aggregates even covered the hydrophobic residues by forming oligomeric network arrangements (3Nakasako M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 547-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 30Teeter M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6014-6018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The total number of water molecules observed in the crystal structures (Table III) and the conservation of hydration water molecules between the wild-type and mutant human lysozymes (see “Experimental Procedures”) were different to a certain extent among the mutant crystals. This may reflect the original crystal quality and the difference of the quenching of hydration water molecules by a flash cooling. These differences were mostly observed in the regions apart from protein surface. Nakasako (3Nakasako M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 547-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) has reported using trypsin crystals that most hydration sites in the room temperature structure are occupied by water molecules at 100 K and the hydration sites in the crystal contact area are poorly conserved in three different crystal forms. Nakasako suggests that the molecular packing in the crystallization process artificially produced the hydration sites in the contact area. Around the residues 2, 74, and 110 in human lysozyme crystals where they are not directly involved in crystal contacts, the number of water molecules was not significantly different unless the residue was substituted. There were 24, 22, and 32 water molecules within 10 Å from Cα atom of the residues 2, 74, and 110, respectively, in the wild-type structure, and 24.0 ± 1.1, 22.2 ± 1.5, and 32.5 ± 1.5 water molecules on the average within 10 Å from Cα atom of the residues 2, 74, and 110, respectively, in unrelated mutant structures, V74X, V110X, and V2X, respectively, where Xmeans G, A, I, L, M, F, S, Y, D, N, and R (19Funahashi J. Takano K. Yamagata Y. Yutani K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14448-14456Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the number of water molecules around the residues 2, 74, and 110 are 20–26 in V2X, 19–25 in V74X, and 30–34 in V110X, respectively. Analyzing the conservation of hydration sites shows that 73, 73, and 77% of the total water molecules around the residues 2, 74, and 110 (within 10 Å from Cα atom), respectively, in the wild-type human lysozyme structure, were conserved in unrelated mutant structures, V74X, V110X, and V2X, respectively, on the average, and totally the number of water molecules is almost same. When these residues were substituted, however, 58, 60, and 63% of the water molecules around each mutation site in the wild-type crystal were occupied by water molecules in the V2X, V74X, and V110X crystals, respectively, on the average. These results show that discussions about the hydration water molecules around the residues 2, 74, and 110 in human lysozyme crystals are possible and useful.

In the mutant structures, all the introduced polar side chains formed the hydrogen bond(s) with the protein atoms or water molecules. The side chains of Tyr-2 in V2Y, Asp-2 in V2D, Asn-2 in V2N, and Arg-2 in V2R formed hydrogen bonds with water molecules, resulting in changes in the hydration structure covering residue 2 (Fig. 1, c–f). The side chains of Ser-2 in V2S and Asp-2 in V2D also formed a hydrogen bond with that of Asn-39, destroying the hydrogen bonds between Oδ1 of Asn-39 and N of Lys-1 via the water molecule (Fig. 1, b and d). All of the polar residues introduced at position 74 formed hydrogen bond(s) with water molecule(s), not with the protein atoms (Fig. 2). However, these polar residues did not substantially change the hydration structure around residue 74. The hydration structure and hydrogen bond networks changed slightly. The substituted polar residues at position 110 hardly affected the hydration structure around there (Fig.3). The side chains of Asp-110 in V110D and Asn-110 in V110N formed hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3, c and d).

However, the exact molecular mechanism of how Ca2+ is involved in the regulation of K+homeostasis in capillary endothelial cells, especially under oxidative stress, is not clear. To reveal Ca2+-triggered pathways, which modulate K+ homeostasis, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and voltage-gated outward K+ currents were studied in rat brain capillary endothelial cells under hypoxia. Whole cell voltage-clamp measurements showed voltage-gated outward K+ current with transient and sustained components. mRNA and protein of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II δ2 and two γ isoenzymes were identified. Activation of the isoforms (autophosphorylation) was typically achieved by the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin, which was prevented by the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-specific inhibitor KN-93. Hypoxia resulted in autophosphorylation of the δ2 and γB isoforms, augmented the current amplitude, increased the inactivation time constant, and decreased the extent of inactivation of the transient current. KN-93 prevented both the activation of the isoforms and the alterations in the K+ current characteristics. It is concluded that the activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II decreases inactivation of the voltage-gated outward K+ current, thereby counteracting depolarization of the hypoxic endothelium.

They serve both as target and release site of vasoactive agents adjusting circulatory parameters (1Nilius B. Viana F. Droogmans G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 145-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). As a primary barrier between circulation and tissue, they play a major role in the regulation of fluid and mineral distribution between extravascular and intravascular space. This is effectively controlled by microvascular EC representing a huge surface.There is an increasing number of ion channel types revealing different expression patterns when comparing EC of different origin (1Nilius B. Viana F. Droogmans G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 145-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). They play a role in the regulation of membrane potential (2Daut J. Standen N.B. Nelson M.T. J.

Although EC are regarded to be nonexcitable, voltage-gated Ca2+ (7Bkaily G. d'Orleans-Juste P. Naik R. Perodin J. Stankova J. Abdulnour E. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Br. J.

The channels may be involved in the release of vasoactive compounds regulated mainly via intracellular Ca2+ movements. Ion channels are described in a more detailed manner on macrovascular EC. Little is known about microvascular EC. The latter express voltage-dependent Ca2+ (9Bossu J.L. Elhamdani A. Feltz A.

Biol. 1999; 167: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and voltage-gated K+ channels (14Dittrich M. Daut J. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H119-H127Google Scholar) have been observed in microvascular EC.Ionic and the closely related osmotic homeostasis partly regulated by ion channels (K+, Na+, Cl−) play an important role in preserving EC morphology and EC-EC coupling required for normal vessel permeability (15Dejana E. Corada M. Lampugnani M.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 910-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Morphological impairment of EC, such as swelling or EC disorganization, may cause blood flow disturbances (16Mazzoni M.C. Borgstrom P. Warnke K.C. Skalak T.C. Intaglietta M. Arfors K.E. Int. J. Microcirc. Clin. Exp. 1995; 15: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or increased extravasation (17Ward B.J. Firth J.A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1989; 12: 1337-1347Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The tightness of the blood-brain barrier is greatly affected by hypoxia as indicated by increased paraendothelial permeability (18Giese H. Mertsch K. Blasig I.E. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 191: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and endothelial swelling (19Mertsch K. Grune T. Siems W.G. Ladhoff A. Saupe N. Blasig I.E. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1995; 41: 243-253Google Scholar). One possible mechanism in endothelial swelling is an alteration of the K+ channel function, which may result in the loss of the K+ recycling pathway necessary for a proper Na+,K+-ATPase function (20Watsky M.A. Cooper K. Rae J.L. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 128: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Members of the diverse superfamily of voltage-activated K+channels have been demonstrated to be modulated by phosphorylation catalyzed by different protein kinases, among them Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Phosphorylation of the K+ channel subtype Kv1.4 at the N terminus by CaMKII affects the fast inactivation kinetics and the current amplitude (21Roeper R. Lorra C. Pongs O. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3379-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Modulation of K+ current inactivation by CaMKII is reported in excitable cells such as atrial myocytes (22Tessier S. Karczewski P. Krause E-G. Pansard Y. Acar C. Lang-Lazdunski M. Mercadier J-J. Hatem S.N. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 810-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and colonic smooth muscle cells (23Koh S.D. Perrino B.A. Hatton W.J. Kenyon J.L. Sanders K.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 517: 75-84Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar).CaMKII is a ubiquitously expressed Ser/Thr protein kinase and transmits Ca2+ signals to a variety of targets ranging from ion channels to transcription factors. CaMKII is encoded by four separate genes (α, β, γ, δ) with partial tissue-specific expression of its subunits and their numerous splicing variants (24Braun A. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). In the macrovascular endothelium CaMKII is shown to be involved in the mechanism of thrombin-induced barrier dysfunction (25Borbiev T. Verin A.D. Shi S. Liu F. Garcia J.G.N. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L983-L990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and NO synthase regulation (26Cai H. Davis M.E. Drummond G.R. Harrison D.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1571-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 27Flemming I. Fisslthaler B. Dimmeler S. Kemp B.E. Busse R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: E68-E75PubMed Google Scholar). As intracellular Ca2+ is increased in EC under pathological conditions, such as hypoxia (28Mertsch K. Grune T. Kunstmann S. Wiesner B. Ladhoff A.M. Siems W.G. Haseloff R.F. Blasig I.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), CaMKII activation is a potential candidate to be involved in the mechanisms of such a cell injury.Here we hypothesize that CaMKII is activated in EC upon oxidative stress, which in turn modulates K+ channels involved in maintaining the endothelial supply and barrier function. Therefore, the aim was to elucidate the effect of hypoxia on CaMKII activity and K+ current in brain capillary endothelial cells forming the blood-brain barrier. The presence and activation of various CaMKII isoenzymes and distinct voltage-gated K+ current components and their modulation were identified under normal and hypoxic conditions. Both the K+ current and the CaMKII activation were sensitive against CaMKII blocker indicating a regulatory relevance of this pathway for the K+ homeostasis of the microvascular endothelium.DISCUSSIONThe current study for the first time provides evidence for a role of CaMKII in the regulation of voltage-gated K+ channels in hypoxic rat brain capillary endothelial cells. A function of the CaMKII has been described in macrovascular endothelial cells but not in the widely differentiated microvasculature that is specialized depending on surrounding tissue. In aortic endothelial cells, CaMKII can be involved in the response to oxidative stress caused by H2O2 (26Cai H. Davis M.E. Drummond G.R. Harrison D.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1571-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) or in thrombin-induced cytoskeletal reorganization and endothelial barrier dysfunction (25Borbiev T. Verin A.D. Shi S. Liu F. Garcia J.G.N. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L983-L990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The isoenzyme pattern of CaMKII in the endothelium is unknown. In this study the presence of CaMKIIδ2 and CaMKIIγ is demonstrated in brain capillary endothelial cells, and evidence is presented for their functional coupling to voltage-gated K+ currents under hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia increases the intraendothelial free Ca2+ concentration as shown earlier (28Mertsch K. Grune T. Kunstmann S. Wiesner B. Ladhoff A.M. Siems W.G. Haseloff R.F. Blasig I.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The isoenzymes identified in rBCEC4 are activated (autophosphorylated) in a Ca2+-dependent manner by hypoxia. The autophosphorylation and the alteration of the K+ current characteristics, both caused by hypoxia, are prevented by the selective CaMKII inhibitor KN-93.The function of the outward voltage-gated K+ current measured in the brain capillary endothelial cells used in the current study is probably related to the regulation of membrane potential. K+ channels are involved in membrane potential regulation in depolarized cells, and they can counteract further membrane depolarization (14Dittrich M. Daut J. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H119-H127Google Scholar). This may possess a regulatory function during membrane potential oscillations elicited by vasoactive agonists (40Langheinrich U. Mederos Schnitzler M. Daut J. Eur. J. Physiol. (Pfluegers Arch.). 1998; 435: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or during membrane depolarization caused by oxidative stress (41Jovanovic S. Jovanovic A. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 639-643PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of membrane potential plays a pivotal role in Ca2+ homeostasis since voltage-gated Ca2+channels serve as one possible pathway for Ca2+ influx (42Cannell M.B. Sage S.O. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1989; 419: 555-568Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar).In rBCEC4 we found a transient and a sustained K+ current component. The characteristics of the transient current corresponds to the A-type, a fast-activating and fast-inactivating outward voltage-gated K+ current. To the sustained component, a delayed rectifier current contributes to a great extent as demonstrated by the effect of TEA. Both the A-type and the delayed rectifier current are reported to be present in primary capillary endothelial cells (13Jow F. Sullivan K. Sokol P. Numann R. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 167: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar,14Dittrich M. Daut J. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H119-H127Google Scholar). This means that rBCEC4 preserves primary properties, making them suitable for further electrophysiological studies. Moreover, the action of the specific K+ channel blockers 4-AP and TEA suggests that the majority of the outward current is carried by K+. Finally, the absence of a charybdotoxin effect indicates that Ca2+-activated K+ channels are not directly involved in the modulation of the voltage-gated K+ current components investigated.Upon hypoxia, rBCEC4 shows an increased τ value and a reduced Ito/Ipeak ratio, indicating a decrease of the transient current inactivation that leads to elevation of the transient and sustained K+ current components. A similar change in K+ currents has been observed in myocytes dialyzed with autophosphorylated CaMKII (23Koh S.D. Perrino B.A. Hatton W.J. Kenyon J.L. Sanders K.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 517: 75-84Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The hypoxia-related rise in the τ value, the diminished Ito/Ipeak ratio, and the elevated transient and sustained K+ current amplitudes can be prevented by the specific CaMKII inhibitor KN-93. Taken together, the assumption is supported that CaMKII enhances the release of K+ from hypoxic rBCEC4 when voltage-gated K+channels are operating.Immunohistochemistry experiments reveal an expression of Kv1.4 channels in rBCEC4 (data not shown). These channels are rapidly inactivated via their N-terminal inactivation domain (43Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Neuron. 1991; 7: 547-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). In human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, phosphorylation of the N-terminal part of the transfected Kv1.4 channel by CaMKII decelerates the inactivation of the fast-inactivating A-type current (21Roeper R. Lorra C. Pongs O. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3379-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is proposed that CaMKII regulates the inactivation of the K+ current in rBCEC4. This conclusion is supported by a considerable deceleration of the transient current inactivation under hypoxic conditions when the detected CaMKII isoenzymes were activated. It is known that voltage-gated K+ channels can be modulated by serine/threonine phosphorylation regulated by Ca2+ (44Schulman H. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). CaMKII is such a Ca2+-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase (24Braun A. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). The assumption of a CaMKII-regulated K+ current is further supported by using the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93, which inhibits the activation of CaMKII and prevents the decrease of the inactivation of the K+ current in our experiments. Up to now, CaMKII-regulated K+ channels have not been reported in nonexcitable cells. In myocytes the regulation of a transient A-type K+ current by CaMKII is described under control conditions that are sensitive to KN-93 (22Tessier S. Karczewski P. Krause E-G. Pansard Y. Acar C. Lang-Lazdunski M. Mercadier J-J. Hatem S.N. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 810-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 23Koh S.D. Perrino B.A. Hatton W.J. Kenyon J.L. Sanders K.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 517: 75-84Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, a function of CaMKII has not yet been known for disturbances caused by oxidative stress.Beside its specific CaMKII inhibitory effect, KN-93 can exert a nonspecific action on K+ currents directly blocking K+ channels. In rabbit smooth muscle cells KN-93 blocks the voltage-dependent K+ current significantly and dose dependently in a manner that is similar to its non-CaMKII inhibiting analogue KN-92 (45Ledoux J. Chartier D. Leblanc N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 290: 1165-1174Google Scholar). In our experiments the action of KN-93 was specific; its effect was confined to CaMKII inhibition only. This is confirmed since KN-92 has no effect on τ and Ito/Ipeak value or the current amplitudes under hypoxic conditions.After hypoxia we have found a significant cell swelling that is a typical sign of hypoxic cell injury (19Mertsch K.

Activation of the CaMKII isoenzymes observed in parallel reflects enhanced intracellular Ca2+ concentration. The hypoxic increase of cytosolic Ca2+ and the hypoxic cell swelling are well described in endothelial cells (28Mertsch K. Grune T. Kunstmann S. Wiesner B. Ladhoff A.M. Siems W.G. Haseloff R.F. Blasig I.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Hypoxia experiments on cultured human endothelial cells give evidence that the Ca2+ uptake is mainly due to the influx of extracellular Ca2+ (46Arnould T. Michiels C. Alexandre I. Remacle J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 152: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Cellular Ca2+ accumulation is known to be related to morphological changes. Laser scanning microscopic studies revealed that bleb formation induced by hypoxic stress involves regional elevation of Ca2+ in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (47Ikeda M. Ariyoshi H. Sakon M. Kambayashi J. Yoshikawa N. Shinoki N. Kawasaki T. Monden M. Cell Calcium. 1998; 24: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, hypoxia impairs the blood-brain barrier function of brain endothelial cells as indicated by increased paraendothelial permeability (18Giese H. Mertsch K. Blasig I.E. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 191: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In our investigation hypoxia conditions (18Giese H. Mertsch K. Blasig I.E. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 191: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 28Mertsch K. Grune T. Kunstmann S. Wiesner B. Ladhoff A.M. Siems W.G. Haseloff R.F. Blasig I.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that are proven to elevate the cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ (28Mertsch K. Grune T. Kunstmann S. Wiesner B. Ladhoff A.M. Siems W.G. Haseloff R.F. Blasig I.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) necessary to intensify the activation of CaMKII were used.As we show here for the first time, brain capillary endothelial cells express non-neuronal members of the CaMKIIγ and CaMKIIδ classes at both the transcript and protein levels. There are no transcripts of the primarily neuronally expressed α and β subunits of CaMKII (24Braun A. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) that are detectable. From the known CaMKIIδ isoenzymes being prominently expressed in non-neuronal excitable tissue, only δ2 is detected in rBCEC4. δ2 is ubiquitously expressed in cells of peripheral tissues and represents a constitutively expressed isoform in the heart (29Hoch B. Haase H. Schulze W. Hagemann D. Morano I. Krause E.G. Karczewski P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 68: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 48Srinavasan M. Edamn C.F. Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 49Hagemann D. Hoch B. Krause E.G. Karczewski P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Transcripts of two isoenzymes of CaMKIIγ are identified in rBCEC4. Immunoblot experiments give evidence that γB protein is expressed, whereas a faint band is consistent in size with the predicted molecular mass of γC but may also result from a cross-reaction with the highly expressed δ2 protein. γB has been demonstrated to elicit higher total as well as autonomous autophosphorylation-dependent catalytic activity than γC (50Singer H.A. Benscoter H.A. Schworer C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9393-9400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, our data suggest that γB is the dominant isoform of the CaMKIIγ class in brain capillary endothelial cells.In response to the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ by treatment with ionomycin, as demonstrated in rBCEC4, δ2shows a more rapid activation in terms of autophosphorylation compared with CaMKII γB. Autophosphorylation of γBin response to ionomycin occurs more slowly but remains at plateau levels, whereas δ2 is rapidly dephosphorylated. This different time course of activation can be due to differences in the accessibility of activating Ca2+ and/or calmodulin, e.g. by distinct intracellular localization of the isoenzymes, different phosphatase action, or specific properties of individual CaMKII isoforms. It has been shown that γBneeds higher concentrations of calmodulin for activation, but γB binds calmodulin more tightly than other CaMKIIγ isoforms (51Kwiatkowski A.P. Mc Gill J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 378: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, kinetic properties of members of the CaMKIIδ class have not yet been investigated. After hypoxic treatment of rBCEC4 autophosphorylation of both δ2 and γB is found to be significantly elevated. The response to hypoxia appears to be more pronounced for δ2. Previous findings on a rat myoblast cell line show that δ2 also localizes to the plasma membrane (29Hoch B. Haase H. Schulze W. Hagemann D. Morano I. Krause E.G. Karczewski P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 68: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This supports the notion that δ2may be involved in the modulation of K+ channel properties in rBCEC. The autophosphorylation of CaMKII persisted after hypoxia for a longer time. Thus, CaMKII remains activated during measurement of the K+ current, and it is most likely that the hypoxia-induced changes of K+ channel properties are caused by CaMKII activation.In conclusion, one can state that because of hypoxic ATP reduction (19Mertsch K. Grune T. Siems W.G. Ladhoff A. Saupe N. Blasig I.E. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1995; 41: 243-253Google Scholar), elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ level (28Mertsch K. Grune T. Kunstmann S. Wiesner B. Ladhoff A.M. Siems W.G. Haseloff R.F. Blasig I.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) results in the activation of CaMKIIδ2, which is thought to be mainly responsible for decreasing the inactivation of the outward K+ current. Our results concerning the increased outward K+ current mediated by the activation of CaMKII support the hypothesis that this pathway may augment the counteracting regulatory effect against depolarization caused by hypoxia.AcknowledgmentsWe thank Barbara Eilemann for cultivation of the cells and Dorothea Riege and Ingrid Ameln for expert technical assistance. Endothelial cells (EC)1regulate numerous processes of the vasculature, e.g. blood coagulation, angiogenesis, barrier, and transport functions. They serve both as target and release site of vasoactive agents adjusting circulatory parameters (1Nilius B. Viana F. Droogmans G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 145-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). As a primary barrier between circulation and tissue, they play a major role in the regulation of fluid and mineral distribution between extravascular and intravascular space. This is effectively controlled by microvascular EC representing a huge surface. There is an increasing number of ion channel types revealing different expression patterns when comparing EC of different origin (1Nilius B. Viana F. Droogmans G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 145-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). They play a role in the regulation of membrane potential (2Daut J. Standen N.B. Nelson M.T. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 1994; 5: 154-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), Ca2+-signaling pathways (3Busse R. Mulsch A. Fleming I. Hecker M. Circulation. 1993; 87: 18-25Google Scholar), cell volume (4Nilius B. Oike M. Zahradnik I. Droogmans G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 787-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), vessel permeability (5He P. Curry F.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: H1246-H1254PubMed Google Scholar), and mechanosensor function (6Lansman J.B. Hallam T.J. Rink T.J. Nature. 1987; 325: 811-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Although EC are regarded to be nonexcitable, voltage-gated Ca2+ (7Bkaily G. d'Orleans-Juste P. Naik R. Perodin J. Stankova J. Abdulnour E. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 519-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and K+ (8Takeda K. Schini V. Stoeckel H. Eur. J. Physiol. (Pfluegers Arch.). 1987; 410: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) channels have been reported. The channels may be involved in the release of vasoactive compounds regulated mainly via intracellular Ca2+ movements. Ion channels are described in a more detailed manner on macrovascular EC. Little is known about microvascular EC. The latter express voltage-dependent Ca2+ (9Bossu J.L. Elhamdani A. Feltz A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 299: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), Na+ (10Walsh K.B. Wolf M.B. Fan J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H506-H512PubMed Google Scholar), ATP-sensitive (11Popp R. Gogelein H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1108: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and stretch-sensitive nonselective cation (12Popp R. Hoyer J. Meyer J. Galla H.J. Gogelein H. J. Physiol. 1992; : 454435-454449Google Scholar) channels. Concerning K+ channels, Ca2+-activated (13Jow F. Sullivan K. Sokol P. Numann R. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 167: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and voltage-gated K+ channels (14Dittrich M. Daut J. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H119-H127Google Scholar) have been observed in microvascular EC. Ionic and the closely related osmotic homeostasis partly regulated by ion channels (K+, Na+, Cl−) play an important role in preserving EC morphology and EC-EC coupling required for normal vessel permeability (15Dejana E. Corada M. Lampugnani M.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 910-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Morphological impairment of EC, such as swelling or EC disorganization, may cause blood flow disturbances (16Mazzoni M.C. Borgstrom P. Warnke K.C. Skalak T.C. Intaglietta M. Arfors K.E. Int. J. Microcirc. Clin. Exp. 1995; 15: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or increased extravasation (17Ward B.J. Firth J.A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1989; 12: 1337-1347Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The tightness of the blood-brain barrier is greatly affected by hypoxia as indicated by increased paraendothelial permeability (18Giese H. Mertsch K. Blasig I.E. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 191: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and endothelial swelling (19Mertsch K. Grune T. Siems W.G. Ladhoff A. Saupe N. Blasig I.E. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1995; 41: 243-253Google Scholar). One possible mechanism in endothelial swelling is an alteration of the K+ channel function, which may result in the loss of the K+ recycling pathway necessary for a proper Na+,K+-ATPase function (20Watsky M.A. Cooper K. Rae J.L. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 128: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Members of the diverse superfamily of voltage-activated K+channels have been demonstrated to be modulated by phosphorylation catalyzed by different protein kinases, among them Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Phosphorylation of the K+ channel subtype Kv1.4 at the N terminus by CaMKII affects the fast inactivation kinetics and the current amplitude (21Roeper R. Lorra C. Pongs O. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3379-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Modulation of K+ current inactivation by CaMKII is reported in excitable cells such as atrial myocytes (22Tessier S. Karczewski P.

https://openalex.org/W2003546574,"The effects of Alzheimer's disease-related amyloidogenic peptides on inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-mediated Ca2+ mobilization were examined in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Intracellular Ca2+ was monitored by electrophysiological measurement of the endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl− current. Application of a hyperpolarizing pulse released intracellular Ca2+ in oocytes primed by pre-injection of a non-metabolizable inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate analogue. The carboxyl terminus of the amyloid precursor protein inhibited inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release in a dose-dependent manner. Equimolar β-amyloid peptides Aβ1–40 or Aβ1–42 had no effect, and whereas a truncated carboxyl terminus lacking the Aβ domain was equipotent to the full-length one, a carboxyl terminus fragment lacking the NPTY sequence was less effective than the full-length fragment. The inhibition induced by the carboxyl terminus was not associated with the block of the Ca2+-dependent Cl−channel itself or compromised Ca2+ influx. We conclude that the carboxyl terminus of the amyloid precursor protein inhibits inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ release and could thus disrupt Ca2+ homeostasis and that the carboxyl terminus is much more effective than the β-amyloid fragments used. By perturbing the coupling of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and Ca2+ release, the carboxyl terminus of the amyloid precursor protein can potentially be involved in inducing the neural toxicity characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.

Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 489-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). These plaques are associated with degenerating neuronal processes and consist primarily of fibrillar aggregates of β-amyloid protein (Aβ). Although Aβ fragments are the main component of amyloid plaques and have been shown to damage or kill cultured neurones (for a review, see Ref. 2Yankner B.A. Neuron. 1996; 16: 921-932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar), Aβ may not be the sole neurotoxic component of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). For example, Aβ peptide deposition has been observed without accompanying neurodegeneration (3Joachim C.L. Morris J.H. Selkoe D.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 135: 309-319PubMed Google Scholar, 4Gearing M.

Crain B.J. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5077-5088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another amyloidogenic fragment, the carboxyl terminus (CT) of APP, which is composed of 99–105 amino acid residues containing the complete Aβ sequence, also appears to be toxic to neurones (6Fukuchi K.I. Sopher B. Martin G.M. Nature. 1993; 361: 122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kim S.H. Suh Y.-H. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1172-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). CT has been found not only in presynaptic terminals of rodent entorhinal neurones (8Buxbaum J.D. Thinakaran G. Koliatsos V. O'Callahan J. Slunt H.H. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. J.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 175: 361-365Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and Down's syndrome (16Kametani F. Tanaka K. Tokuda T. Ikeda S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A transgenic mouse model expressing CT exhibited neuropathology very similar in many respects to that of AD, especially as regards age-dependent neuronal and synaptic degeneration (17Oster-Granite M.L. McPhie D.L. Greenan J. Neve R.L. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6732-6741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and spatial-learning deficits and electrophysiological alterations that suggested impairment of synaptic plasticity (18Nalbantoglu J. Tirado-Santiago G. Lahsaini A. Poirier J. Goncalves O. Verge G. Momoli F. Welner S.A. Massicotte G. Julien J.P. Shapiro M.L. Nature. 1997; 387: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). A 31-amino acid carboxyl-terminal fragment of APP (CT31) generated from CT by caspase-9 cleavage was reported to have a pro-apoptotic effect and to mainly contribute to the CT toxicity in neuronal cells. Both CT31 and activated caspase-9 were present in the brains of AD patients but not in control brains (19Lu D.C. Rabizadeh S. Chandra S. Shayya R.F. Ellerby L.M., Ye, X. Salvesen G.S. Koo E.H. Bredesen D.E. Nat. Med. 2000; 4: 397-404Crossref Scopus (349) Google Scholar). These findings together indicate that CTs themselves may also contribute to the neurodegenerative processes in vivo not only as a precursor to make Aβ. Earlier studies showed that Aβ-bearing CTs were released from several different cells and/or were more easily released from the damaged neurons into the media or extracellular fluid (20Yankner B.A. Dawes L.R.

Volpe B.T. Brain Res. 2000; 874: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and the transcriptively active complex of CT with Fe65 and histone acetyltransferase, Tip60 (24Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that CT plays important roles in delayed neurodegeneration via transcriptional regulation. Our previous study also demonstrated that CT fragments without Aβ and the transmembrane domain may also exert toxicity in nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells (25Lee J.P. Chang K.A. Kim H.S.

CT can also contribute to stimulation of inflammatory processes linked to delayed neurodegeneration in AD (26Rah J.C. Kim H.S. Kim S.S. Bach J.H. Kim Y.S. Park C.H. Seo J.H. Jeong S.J. Suh Y.H.

Alzheimer's disease inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate d-3-deoxy-3-fluoro-myo-inositol 1,4, 5-trisphosphate β-amyloid protein amyloid precursor protein carboxyl-terminal glutathione S-transferase transmembrane Aβ and CT peptides have been shown to damage cultured neurons by a mechanism involving disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis (29Mattson M.P.

Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 3875-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, the potential role of amyloidogenic fragments, including Aβ, in IP3 production and/or intracellular Ca2+ mobilization has not been clear. Elucidating the possible effects of Aβ or CT peptides on IP3 signaling has been hampered by the intracellular location of IP3 receptors. Furthermore, limitations concerning specific inhibitors or activators of the IP3receptors, not affecting ryanodine receptors, have also made it difficult to investigate Aβ effects on the IP3 pathway (31Wilcox R.A. Primrose W.U. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 467-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To circumvent these difficulties, we have used Xenopus laevis oocytes as a model system. The large size of Xenopus oocytes facilitated precise intracellular application of IP3 and APP fragments. Moreover, the Ca2+ response of Xenopus oocytes was not complicated by ryanodine receptors, which are absent in the oocytes (32Parys J.B. Sernett S.W. DeLisle S. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18776-18782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another advantage of this model system is that injection of IP3 into Xenopus oocytes elevates the cytosolic Ca2+ level and activates Ca2+-dependent Cl− currents (33Parekh A.B. Foguet M. Lubbert H. Stuhmer W. J. Physiol. 1993; 469: 653-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which can be used as a real-time indicator of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration (34Barish M.E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1983; 342: 309-325Crossref Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 35Gomez-Hernandez J. Stuhmer W. Parekh A.B. J. Physiol. 1997; 502: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, Yao and Parker (36Yao Y. Parker I. J. Physiol. 1993; 468: 275-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) showed that application of a hyperpolarizing pulse to Xenopus oocytes pre-injected with an enzyme-resistant IP3 analogue,d-3-deoxy-3-fluoro-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (3-F-IP3), induced a current that represented Ca2+ release from IP3-sensitive stores. We have adopted this protocol to study the effect of amyloidogenic peptides on the IP3 pathway. Recombinant CT105 was prepared on the basis of human APP770 cDNA as described previously (37Chong Y.H. Jung J.M. Choi W. Park C.W. Choi K.S. Suh Y.H. Life Sci. 1994; 54: 1259-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, the expression plasmid pCS-CT105 was constructed by ligating the 704-bp BglII-ClaI fragment excised from pSP65-APP770 into ptrpSF9, digested with BglII and SmaI, treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, and transformed into Escherichia coliXL1-Blue. CT105 peptide (Mr 14,242) was purified by a combination of urea solubilization and ion exchange chromatography and then subjected to dialysis against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) followed by lyophilization. To rule out the effect of possible co-purified contaminating factors, groups incubated with polymixin B sulfate were compared with non-treated ones. We confirmed that these are not significantly different. Aβ1–42 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Ltd. (Dorset, UK). Aβ1–40, Aβ1–42, and CT were dissolved in distilled water to make 100 μm stock solutions and incubated at 37 °C for 6 days. To determine which region is the active domain responsible for the effect on IP3 signaling of CT, we have generated truncated carboxyl-terminal fragments of APP. Because Aβ, the transmembrane portion, and the NPTY sequence in the cytoplasmic tail are believed to be important in mediating toxic effects of CT peptide, constructs without these domains were generated using the PCR-amplified strategy and the GST fusion protein strategy as described earlier (25Lee J.P. Chang K.A. Kim H.S. Kim S.S. Jeong S.J. Suh Y.H. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 60: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, they were cloned from pSP65-APP770 by PCR using oligonucleotides complementary to corresponding position (28Chong Y.H. Sung J.H. Shin S.A. Chung J.H. Suh Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23511-23517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For the construction of plasmids encoding GST fusion proteins,BamHI/XhoI fragment of the PCR-generated fragments was cloned into the BamHI/XhoI site of pGEX 4T-1. We have prepared the following constructs: GST-CT 46 (649–695) without Aβ and transmembrane (TM) domain (CTdAβ/TM) and GST-CT 86 (597–683) without NPTY domain (CTdNPTY). These final PCR constructs were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. These recombinant GST-CTs of APP were purified with a combination of urea solubilization and ion exchange chromatography. X. laevis oocytes were prepared and defolliculated as described previously (38Fraser S.P. Moon C. Djamgoz M.B.A. Wallis D.I. Electrophysiology, a Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 65-86Google Scholar). Defolliculated oocytes were stored in incubation medium at 19 °C for several days. Composition of the incubation medium was (in millimolar): NaCl, 88.0; KCl, 1.0; CaCl2, 0.41; NaHCO3, 2.5; MgSO4, 0.82; and Ca(NO3)2, 0.33, penicillin and streptomycin, 10 μg/ml each; gentamicin sulfate, 0.1 mg/ml; pH 7.5. Unless otherwise noted, oocytes were continually perfused with Ringer's solution at room temperature (18–20 °C) during recording. In the case of thapsigargin pretreatment, oocytes were incubated in Ca2+-free medium containing 1 μm thapsigargin overnight at 19 °C. Composition of the normal Ringer's solution was (millimolar): NaCl, 120; KCl, 2; CaCl2, 1.8; HEPES, 5; pH 7.3. Ca2+-free medium was made by omitting CaCl2 and adding 5 mm MgCl2 together with 1 mm EGTA (36Yao Y. Parker I. J. Physiol. 1993; 468: 275-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Most chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd. (Dorset, UK). 3-F-IP3, purchased from CN Biosciences UK (Nottingham, UK), was dissolved in distilled water at 35 μm. 3-F-IP3 is about equipotent to IP3 in liberating intracellular Ca2+ but cannot be converted to inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate by the action of 3-kinases and thus stimulates IP3 receptors continuously (39Kozikowski A.P. Fauq A.H. Aksoy I.A. Seewald M.J. Powis G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 7403-7404Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thapsigargin (Alomone Labs Ltd., Jerusalem, Israel) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). The final concentration of Me2SO in the Ca2+-free medium was 0.1%. The dissolved chemical and peptides were kept at −20 °C until use. Pulled injection pipette3-00-2s (03-G/XL, Drummond, Broomal, PA; tip diameters, 10–15 μm) were back-filled with the 3-F-IP3 solutions and attached to an oocyte injector (Drummond). 46 nl of solution was injected into each oocyte. Injected oocytes were kept for about 30 min in an incubator at 19 °C, except for experiments on transient current responses. The latter were induced directly by 3-F-IP3 injections, under voltage clamp, using a pneumatic pico-pump (WPI, Sarasota, FL). A holding potential of −40 mV was used in these experiments. In the main body of experiments, Aβ1–40, Aβ1–42, full-length CT or the truncated fragments were injected into oocytes which had been “primed” previously for 30 min with 3-F-IP3 (at 150 nm intracellular concentration). Injection of the peptides was achieved either with the oocyte injector (Drummond) or with the pico-pump, dependent on the experimental set up. For experiments using the pico-pump, the volume of the injected peptide solution was calibrated before the start of the experiments. For a pre-set pressure (20 p.s.i.), the duration was adjusted to give the same ejected volume of liquid (46 nl), measured under a dissection microscope. The duration was determined separately for each injection pipette. The concentrations of peptides and 3-F-IP3 injected into oocytes are given in the text as the final, intracellular ones. These were as follows: 0.22, 0.44, 0.88, 1.3, 1.8, 2.2, and 3.0 μm for CT; 0.44, 0.88, 2.2, and 3.0 μm for Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42; and 1.2 mm for the various truncated fragments. Conventional two-electrode methodologies were performed with a voltage-clamp amplifier (GeneClamp 500B, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Resistances of the voltage-measuring electrodes filled with 2.5 m KCl were in the range 1–3mΩ, whereas current-measuring electrodes had resistances of 0.4–1 mΩ. Stimulation and data acquisition were controlled by pClamp 6.02 software (Axon Instruments) via a Digidata 1200 interface (Axon Instruments). Recorded data were stored on an IBM computer and analyzed in pClamp 6.02 package. Two types of membrane currents were recorded: 1) Fast, transient currents induced directly by 3-F-IP3 injection. For recording the transient current (It) induced directly by 3-F-IP3itself, the compound was injected into oocytes under voltage clamp (−40 mV), and the resulting currents were monitored for ∼20 min. 2) Late currents induced by membrane hyperpolarization in oocytes pre-injected with 3-F-IP3. The delayed membrane currents (Tin) were recorded as follows: (i) An oocyte pre-injected with 3-F-IP3 was incubated for 30 min and transferred to the recording chamber. (ii) The oocyte was voltage-clamped at a holding potential of 0 mV to keep the driving force of Ca2+ influx at a low level. (iii) A hyperpolarizing pulse was applied from 0 mV to −110 mV for 4.5 s, and the current response was recorded. The current response recorded before the peptide injection was used as the control. (iv) A peptide was injected with the pico-pump or oocyte injector. (v) The same hyperpolarizing pulse was applied to the oocyte 10 min following peptide injection. The resulting response was compared with its own pre-injection control. The percentage residual current was expressed as [(post-injection amplitude/pre-injection amplitude) × 100]. All data have been presented as means ± S.E. of the means (S.E.). The number of measurements given (n) represents different oocytes; the number of batches,i.e. toads used (N) for a given experiment, is also indicated. Data were analyzed using a statistics package, SAS/6.03 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Effect of a given peptide on current amplitude was analyzed by one-way ANOVA, after all the percentage data were transformed to logarithmic values. A Tukey test was used for multiple comparisons. Wilcoxon test (non-parametric) was used for comparison of two groups. Correlation coefficients were determined by non-parametric Spearman test. Statistical significance was considered at the following levels: p < 0.05 (†),p < 0.01 (*), p < 0.001 (**),p < 0.0001 (***), and p < 0.00001 (****). Injection of 3-F-IP3 (1 μm) into oocytes held at −40 mV caused a biphasic inward current: A fast, transient component (It), followed by a slow phase with typical oscillations (Fig. 1 A). This response pattern was similar to those induced by IP3 or 3-F-IP3 in previous studies on Xenopus oocytes (36Yao Y. Parker I. J. Physiol. 1993; 468: 275-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 40Yao Y. Parker I. J. Physiol. 1992; 458: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 41Parekh A.B. Pflugers Arch. 1995; 430: 954-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This confirmed that the IP3 system was functioning normally. Oocytes injected with 3-F-IP3 (150 nm) were incubated for a further 30 min and then a hyperpolarizing pulse (0 to −110 mV) was applied under voltage clamp. This generated a slow “hump-like” inward current (Tin, Parker and Miledi (42Parker I. Miledi R. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1987; 231: 27-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) (Fig. 1 B). Water-injected control oocytes showed only leakage currents without Tin (Fig. 1 C). The reversal potential of Tin was about −22 mV (n = 3), similar to the value reported previously for the endogenous Ca2+-dependent Cl−current of Xenopus oocytes (e.g. Ref. 34Barish M.E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1983; 342: 309-325Crossref Scopus (491) Google Scholar). A high level of 3-F-IP3 (1.5 μm) was used to test whether Tincould be altered by enhanced depletion of Ca2+ stores. The mean amplitudes of the hump currents induced by 1.5 μmand 150 nm 3-F-IP3 were indistinguishable: 962 ± 192 nA (n = 14/n = 3)versus 1153 ± 233 nA (n = 15/n = 3; p > 0.1), respectively. This was not due to 150 nm 3-F-IP3 saturating the Ca2+ release pathway. This was confirmed by comparing the amplitudes of It generated directly by the IP3 analogue injection: The currents induced by 150 nm and 1.5 μm 3-F-IP3 were 112.6 ± 32.2 and 279.3 ± 61.9 nA, respectively (n = 7/n = 2 for both;p < 0.05). These results suggested that the amplitude of Tin was not affected by possible enhanced depletion of the Ca2+ stores. We examined whether Tin depended on extracellular Ca2+. Tin was abolished in the Ca2+-free/EGTA Ringer's solution (Fig. 1, D versus E). This effect was reversible, with the current recovered in normal Ringer's solution containing 1.8 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 1 F). We also tested whether Tin could be mediated exclusively by Ca2+ influx. Thapsigargin (1 μm) was used to deplete Ca2+ stores and set up capacitative Ca2+ entry (43Putney J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). No Tin current could be observed in such oocytes using the standard protocol (data not shown). This confirmed, under our experimental conditions, Tin was not simply generated by Ca2+ entering from outside. These characteristics taken together are consistent with the Tin current representing a Cl−current activated by Ca2+ released from IP3-sensitive stores by the triggering action of hyperpolarization-induced Ca2+ influx, as in the study of Yao and Parker (36Yao Y. Parker I. J. Physiol. 1993; 468: 275-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Following a control (pre-injection) recording of Tin in oocytes primed with 3-F-IP3, water (as vehicle control) or an amyloidogenic fragment of APP (Aβ1–40, Aβ1–42, or CT) was applied intracellularly. Experiments, in which the oocytes were injected with distilled water alone, showed that Tin was stable and that the post-injection amplitudes were not much different from those of pre-injection controls (residual current = 96.5 ± 4.8%; n = 18/n = 4;p > 0.05; Figs.2 A and3 A). Application of either Aβ1–40 or Aβ1–42 (0.22–3.0 μm for both) had no significant effect on Tin (n = 8 for each; Figs.2 B, 2 C, and 3 A). In contrast, injection of CT peptide was very effective in suppressing Tin (Figs. 2 D and 3 A). The inhibitory effect of CT peptide on Tin was dose-dependent (Fig. 4). The concentration of CT peptide that induced half-maximal inhibition of Tin was about 0.4 μm.Figure 3A, normalized mean amplitudes of residual Tin after injection of water or 2.2 μm amyloidogenic fragments. Residual currents (%) were calculated by dividing the peak amplitude of Tinafter injection with that of the respective control Tin (i.e. (post-injection Tin × 100)/(pre-injection Tin)). One way-ANOVA and a Tukey test were performed for statistical comparisons with the water-injected control (***, p < 0.0001). The data for each condition represent the mean of eight oocytes; the value for water control was obtained from 12 oocytes. Error bars denote S.E.B, normalized mean amplitudes of residual Tin after injection of water, GST, 1.22 μm CT, or equimolar truncated CT peptides. Residual currents were determined as described above.

The error bars denote S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also investigated if CT would inhibit Itinduced directly by 3-F-IP3 injection. 3-F-IP3(1 μm) typically evoked peak inward currents of 50–350 nA. There was no statistically significant effect on the peak inward current when 1.3 μm CT (a concentration that consistently inhibited Tin) was co-injected with 3-F-IP3 (n = 13/n = 3;p > 0.1). In addition, the reduction of Tin was not overcome by 10- or 100-fold higher concentration of 3-F-IP3 (i.e. 1.5 and 15 μm, respectively; data not shown). In addition, we tested whether IP3 re-injection could evoke the current following the initial block by CT. We could not find any recovery of Tin in this condition (data not shown). To explore the active part of the CT domain responsible for its inhibitory effects on Tin, we made truncated CT peptides, CTdNPTY and CTdAβ/ΤM. Water, 1.2 μm GST, CT, or each GST-conjugated, truncated CT peptide was applied intracellularly, after checking Tinin oocytes primed with 3-F-IP3. CTdNPTY suppressed Tin less effectively than full-length CT injection (residual current = 57.2 ± 10.3%,n = 7; p < 0.05; Fig. 3 B), whereas CTdAβ/TM showed no significant difference (residual current = 19.3 ± 10.3%, n = 7; Fig. 3 B) at the same concentration. The control oocytes injected with GST or water showed stable Tin (residual current of GST = 101.0 ± 15.5%, n = 7;p > 0.05; residual current of water = 96.5 ± 4.8%, n = 18; p > 0.05; Fig. 3 A). These results show that the YENPTY domain in the cytoplasmic tail seems to have a more crucial role in inhibiting IP3 signaling rather than the Aβ or TM domains. To eliminate the possibility that CT could compromise capacitative Ca2+ entry, oocytes that had been pre-treated with thapsigargin overnight (in the absence of extracellular Ca2+), to set up capacitative Ca2+ entry (44Petersen C.C.H. Berridge M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32246-32253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were injected with 1.3 μm CT. Current responses to hyperpolarizing pulses were 646 ± 142 nA before, compared with 590 ± 157 nA following CT injection (p = 0.18,n = 11/n = 3; Fig. 5). In addition, thapsigargin treatment is known to lengthen the time-to-peak of Tin(41Parekh A.B. Pflugers Arch. 1995; 430: 954-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We therefore measured the time-to-peak of Tin before and following 1.3 μm CT injection (1245 ± 196 ms versus 1134 ± 150 ms, respectively). The values were not significantly different (p = 0.19; n = 12). Together, these results are consistent with CT having no significant effect on capacitative Ca2+ entry. To elucidate whether the inhibitory effect of CT involved directly the Ca2+-activated Cl− channels, we compared the decay time courses of Tin before and after CT injection in oocytes in which CT reduced, but did not abolish, the peak Tin current (see later). Current decay could be fitted with a single exponential of which the time constant (τ) did not change significantly following CT injection (τ = 1024 ± 265 versus 964 ± 156 ms, before and after CT, respectively, n = 16/n = 4;p > 0.4; Fig. 6). In conclusion, the inhibitory effect of CT on Ca2+ release was most likely due to suppression of IP3-sensitive Ca2+ release from"
