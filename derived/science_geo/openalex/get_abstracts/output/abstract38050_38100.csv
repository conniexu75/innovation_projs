This report describes the isolation and purification of a soluble protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which specifically inhibits the inactivation of various enzymes by a nonenzymatic Fe3+/O2/thiol mixed-function oxidase system. When thiol is replaced with another electron donor (e.g. ascorbate), this specific protein no longer protects against iron (or copper)/O2-dependent radical-induced enzyme inactivation. Purification steps included a polyethylene glycol precipitation followed sequentially by a chromatography on DE52 and high pressure liquid chromatography on phenyl, DEAE, and gel-filtrated columns. The final gel filtration step yielded two protein peaks exhibiting protector activity and possessing a Mr of 500,000 and 90,000. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of these two fractions gave a single band at 27 kDa suggesting that these protein species simply represent different oligomeric structures. The protector protein did not possess catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, or iron chelation activities. Since the protection activity reported herein is specific for mixed-function oxidation systems containing thiols, we propose that the protector protein functions as a sulfur radical scavenger."
https://openalex.org/W2038149991,"Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a cell cycle and growth regulated protein required for replication of SV40 DNA in vitro. Its function was investigated by comparison of the replication products synthesized in its presence or absence. In the completely reconstituted replication system that contains PCNA, DNA synthesis initiates at the origin and proceeds bidirectionally on both leading and lagging strands around the template DNA to yield duplex, circular daughter molecules. In contrast, in the absence of PCNA, early replicative intermediates containing short nascent strands accumulate. Replication forks continue bidirectionally from the origin, but surprisingly, only lagging strand products are synthesized. Thus two stages of DNA synthesis have been defined, with the second stage requiring PCNA for coordinated leading and lagging strand synthesis at the replication fork. We suggest that during eukaryotic chromosome replication there is a switch to a PCNA-dependent elongation stage that requires two distinct DNA polymerases."
https://openalex.org/W1967850071,"The responses of retinoblastoma tumor cells and normal retinal cells to various growth inhibitory factors were examined. Whereas fetal retinal cells were highly sensitive to the antimitogenic effects of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), retinoblastoma tumor cell lines were all resistant to this factor. Binding assays and affinity labeling of these cells with radioiodinated TGF-β1 revealed that the cells did not have TGF-β receptors. The retinoblastoma cells lacked the three affinity-labeled proteins of 65, 95, and 300 kilodaltons typically seen in human cell lines and thus differed from normal retinal cells and from other types of neuroectodermal tumors that display the normal pattern of receptors. Loss of TGF-β receptors, which is a rare event among tumor cells, may represent one mechanism through which these cells escape from negative control and form retinoblastomas."

https://openalex.org/W2095179395,"The inheritance of particular alleles of major histocompatibility complex class II genes increases the risk for various human autoimmune diseases; however, only a small percentage of individuals having an allele associated with susceptibility develop disease. The identification of allelic variants more precisely correlated with disease susceptibility would greatly facilitate clinical screening and diagnosis. Oligonucleotide-primed gene amplification in vitro was used to determine the nucleotide sequence of a class II variant found almost exclusively in patients with the autoimmune skin disease pemphigus vulgaris. In addition to clinical implications, the disease-restricted distribution of this variant should provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying associations between diseases and HLA-class II genes."

https://openalex.org/W1586520658,"The structural organization of Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase was examined by limited proteolysis with trypsin and/or cross-linking with azido-calmodulin a photoactivable derivative of its activator, calmodulin (CaM). Adenylate cyclase (which consists of three structurally related peptides of 50, 45, and 43 kDa as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) formed a 1:1 complex with CaM or azido-CaM. CaM-bound adenylate cyclase was cleaved by trypsin into two separate trypsin-resistant fragments of 25 and 18 kDa which both interacted with CaM as judged by their ability to be cross-linked with azido-CaM. These two fragments remained associated with CaM in a catalytically active conformation resembling that of the undigested complex. When proteolysis was carried out in the absence of CaM, the adenylate cyclase was completely inactivated in less than 3 min. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel revealed a single 24-kDa trypsin-resistant fragment. Since this fragment cannot be cross-linked with azido-CaM we suggest that the CaM-binding site on the 25-kDa moiety of the adenylate cyclase is located on a short segment of 1 kDa."
https://openalex.org/W1596316759,"Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to generate mutations in the a subunit gene (uncB) altering the glutamic acid 219 and the histidine 245 codons. Substitutions of aspartic acid, glutamine, histidine, and leucine for glutamic acid at position 219 neither alter the hydrolytic activity of membrane-bound F1 nor the association of F1 with F0. However, the efficiency of F0-mediated proton translocation was reduced to varying degrees. Replacement of glutamic acid 219 with leucine reduced the ATP-driven proton pumping activity of intact F1F0 to undetectable levels. Roughly 5% of normal activity was observed when glutamine occupied position 219. Surprisingly higher activity, approaching 20% of wild type levels, is seen when histidine replaced glutamic acid 219. The aspartic acid substitution resulted in little loss of enzyme function. Substitution of glutamic acid for histidine 245 results in a reduction to about 45% of normal proton translocation. Construction of the double mutant with substitution of histidine at position 219 and glutamic acid at position 245 yields a complex with better proton translocation than with either mutant separately. The possibility that a functionally important interaction between histidine 245 and glutamic acid 219 of the a subunit may be directly involved in the proton translocation mechanism of F1F0-ATP synthase is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W262805330,"We have identified a monoclonal anti-factor VIII (FVIII) antibody, C4, which inhibits the binding of purified human FVIII to purified human von Willebrand factor (vWF). Both whole immunoglobulin C4 and its Fab fragment demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of FVIII binding to vWF immobilized on the surface of polystyrene beads. Synthetic peptides based on the amino acid sequence of FVIII were tested for the ability to block the binding of C4 to FVIII in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system. A single synthetic FVIII pentadecapeptide, consisting of residues Val1670-Glu1684, was able to inhibit C4 binding to FVIII. Under the conditions used, the Val1670-Glu1684 peptide demonstrated total inhibition of C4 binding at a concentration of 1 microM. Synthetic FVIII peptides flanking and overlapping the Val1670-Glu1684 peptide had no significant inhibitory activity on C4 binding in concentrations up to 100 microM. A polyclonal antibody made to the Val1670-Glu1684 peptide also demonstrated inhibition of FVIII binding to vWF. Polyclonal antibodies made to synthetic FVIII peptides flanking and partially overlapping the Val1670-Glu1684 sequence did not demonstrate such inhibition. Localization of the binding region of the monoclonal anti-FVIII antibody C4 to residues Val1670-Glu1684 suggests that this site is at, or near, a major vWF binding domain of FVIII."
https://openalex.org/W1538232203,"Neutral endopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.11) is an integral membrane protein found in the plasma membrane of many cell types. The cDNA coding for the complete primary structure of neutral endopeptidase has recently been cloned and sequenced (Devault, A. Lazure, C., Nault, C., Le Moual, H., Seidah, N. G., Chretien, M., Kahn, P., Powell, J., Mallet, J., Beaumont, A., Roques, B. P., Crine, P., and Boileau, G. (1987) EMBO J. 6, 1317-1322). Comparison of the sequence of neutral endopeptidase with that of thermolysin, a bacterial Zn-metalloendopeptidase, suggests that Glu-584 in neutral endopeptidase probably corresponds to Glu-143 in thermolysin, which is an essential amino acid involved in catalysis. To test directly the importance of Glu-584 in the catalytic activity of neutral endopeptidase by site-directed metagenesis, we have constructed an expression vector in which the rabbit kidney cDNA encoding the entire neutral endopeptidase sequence is introduced downstream from the SV40 virus early promotor. After transfection in COS-1 monkey kidney cells, this vector was found to promote the expression of a protein with biochemical and catalytic properties identical to kidney neutral endopeptidase. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of Glu-584 to either valine or aspartic acid completely abolished the enzymatic activity of the recombinant protein without changing its affinity for the substrate-related tritiated inhibitor [3H]N-[(2R,2S)-3-hydroxyamino-carbonyl-2-benzyl-1-oxopropyl]-glycine. This observation clearly identifies Glu-584 as one of the important residues responsible for the catalytic activity of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2014655503,"TAP is a phosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein that is involved in murine T lymphocyte activation. To determine the relationship between TAP and T cell receptor/CD3-mediated activation, we derived TAP expression mutants of a T-T hybridoma. Two phenotypically distinct classes of mutants were obtained. The first has a selective defect in the transcription of TAP, while the second has a defect in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylinositol-protein linkages. Both mutations affect antigen-stimulated, T cell receptor-mediated activation of the T-T hybrid. These variants have intact immune effector gene programs, as they are responsive to pharmacologic agents that mimic receptor signals. These findings support a role for phosphatidylinositol-linked-cell cell-surface glycoproteins in physiologic T cell activation. Consistent with this interpretation, we observed similar defects in T cell responsiveness after enzymatic removal of phosphatidylinositol-linked proteins from normal T lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1529367350,"The complete amino acid sequence of acetyl-CoA carboxylase from chicken liver has been deduced by cloning and sequence analysis of DNA complementary to its messenger RNA. The results were confirmed by Edman degradation of peptide fragments obtained by digestion of the enzyme polypeptide with Achromobacter proteinase I or staphylococcal serine proteinase. Chicken liver acetyl-CoA carboxylase is predicted to be composed of 2,324 amino acid residues, having a calculated molecular weight of 262,706. The biotin carboxyl carrier protein domain is located in the middle region of the enzyme polypeptide. The amino-terminal portion of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase has been found to exhibit a homologous primary structure to that of carbamyl phosphate synthetase. Localization of possible functional domains including biotin carboxylase subsite in the acetyl-CoA carboxylase polypeptide is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1965757356,"Three different cases of pancreatic β cell hyperplasia in mice are accompanied by an increase in a subclass of cells expressing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a neuronal enzyme. In the nontumorigenic cases of islet growth during normal pregnancy and in the obese mutant mouse, the TH-insulin cells do not divide, in contrast to the “insulin-only” cells. In later stages the number of proliferating insulin-only cells decreases concomitant with an increase in the number of non-dividing TH-insulin cells, suggesting that the TH-insulin cells are on a pathway to senescence. In the presence of an oncoprotein the TH-insulin cells are able to proliferate. The proliferation of this cell type may represent an escape from the senescence pathway and progression to immortal tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1579384758,"We report here the effects of differentiation on the binding and action of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in three lines of myogenic cells. In two lines (L6-A1 and C2) which irreversibly differentiate by fusing to form postmitotic myotubes, there is a virtual disappearance of TGF-beta binding sites as differentiation occurs. Analyses of the binding curves by the method of Scatchard indicates that there is little or no change in affinity but a substantial decrease in the number of binding sites. In L6-A1 cells, responsiveness to TGF-beta decreases in parallel to the loss of receptors. The decreases in TGF-beta binding and activity with differentiation are not paralleled by similar changes in another growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-I, which exhibits little change in binding and only a modest decrease in activity as L6-A1 myoblasts differentiate to form myotubes. In a third cell line (BC3H1), which exhibits reversible differentiation without fusion, there is little or no change in TGF-beta binding as the cells differentiate. Comparisons with reported decreases in binding of fibroblast and epidermal growth factors indicates that there are substantial differences in growth factor binding and actions as muscle cells differentiate, but it is not possible to make the simple generalization that differentiation is accompanied by a decrease in binding of all growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W1515235105,"The stoichiometry of nucleotide binding to the isolated alpha- and beta-subunits of Escherichia coli F1-ATPase was investigated using two experimental techniques: (a) titration with fluorescent trinitrophenyl (TNP) derivatives of AMP, ADP, and ATP and (b) the centrifuge column procedure using the particular conditions of Khananshvili and Gromet-Elhanan (Khananshvili, D., and Gromet-Elhanan, Z. (1985) FEBS Lett. 178, 10-14). Both procedures showed that alpha-subunit contains one nucleotide-binding site, confirming previous work. TNP-ADP and TNP-ATP bound to a maximal level of 1 mol/mol beta-subunit, consistent with previous equilibrium dialysis studies which showed isolated beta-subunit bound 1 mol of ADP or ATP per mol (Issartel, J. P., and Vignais, P. V. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 6591-6595). However, binding of only approximately 0.1 mol of ATP or ADP per mol of beta-subunit was detected using centrifuge columns. Our results are consistent with the conclusion that each of the alpha- and beta-subunits contains one nucleotide-binding domain. Because the subunit stoichiometry is alpha 3 beta 3 gamma delta epsilon, this can account for the location of the six known nucleotide-binding sites in E. coli F1-ATPase. Studies of in vitro assembly of isolated alpha-, beta-, and gamma- subunits into an active ATPase showed that ATP, GTP, and ITP all supported assembly, with half-maximal reconstitution of ATPase occurring at concentrations of 100-200 microM, whereas ADP, GDP, and IDP did not. Also TNP-ATP supported assembly and TNP-ADP did not. The results demonstrate that (a) the nucleotide-binding site on beta-subunit has to be filled for enzyme assembly to proceed, whereas occupancy of the alpha-subunit nucleotide-binding site is not required, and (b) that enzyme assembly requires nucleoside triphosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1556524613,"Acetyl-CoA carboxylase of animal tissues is known to be dependent on citrate for its activity. The observation that dephosphorylation abolishes its citrate dependence (Thampy, K. G., and Wakil, S. J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 6318-6323) suggested that the citrate-independent form might exist in vivo. We have purified such a form from rapidly freeze-clamped livers of rats. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of the enzyme gave one protein band (Mr 250,000). The preparation has high specific activity (3.5 units/mg in the absence of citrate) and low phosphate content (5.0 mol of Pi/mol of subunit). The enzyme isolated from unfrozen liver or liver kept in ice-cold sucrose solution for 10 min and then freeze-clamped has low activity (0.3 unit/mg) and high phosphate content (7-8 mol of Pi/mol of subunit). Citrate activated such preparations with half-maximal activation at greater than 1.6 mM, well above physiological range. The low activity may be due to its high phosphate content because dephosphorylation by [acetyl-CoA carboxylase]-phosphatase 2 activates the enzyme and reduces its dependence on citrate. Since freeze-clamping the liver yields enzyme with lower phosphate content and higher activity, it is suggested that the carboxylase undergoes rapid phosphorylation and consequent inactivation after the excision of the liver. The carboxylase is made up of two polymeric forms of Mr greater than or equal to 10 million and 2 million based on gel filtration on Superose 6. The former, which predominates in preparations from freeze-clamped liver, has higher activity and lower phosphate content (5.3 units/mg and 4.0 mol of Pi/mol of subunit, respectively) than the latter (2.0 units/mg and 6.0 mol of Pi/mol of subunit, respectively). The latter, which predominates in preparations from unfrozen liver, is converted to the active polymer (Mr greater than or equal to 10 million) by dephosphorylation. Thus, the two polymeric forms are interconvertible by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and may be important in the physiological regulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase."
https://openalex.org/W1587109379,"The amino acid sequence -Gly-X-X-X-X-Gly-Lys- occurs in many, diverse, nucleotide-binding proteins, and there is evidence that it forms a flexible loop which interacts with one or other of the phosphate groups of bound nucleotide. This sequence occurs as -Gly-Gly-Ala-Gly-Val-Gly-Lys- in the beta-subunit of the enzyme F1-ATPase, where it is thought to form part of the catalytic nucleotide-binding domain. Mutants of Escherichia coli were generated in which residue beta-lysine 155, at the end of the above sequence, was replaced by glutamine or glutamate. Properties of the soluble purified F1-ATPase from each mutant were studied. The results showed: 1) replacement of lysine 155 by Gln or Glu decreased the steady-state rate of ATP hydrolysis by 80 and 66%, respectively. 2) Characteristics of ATP hydrolysis at a single site were not markedly changed in the mutant enzymes, implying that lysine 155 is not directly involved in bond cleavage during ATP hydrolysis or bond formation during ATP synthesis. 3) The binding affinity for MgATP was weakened considerably in the mutants (Lys much much greater than Gln greater than Glu), whereas the binding affinity for MgADP was affected only mildly (Lys = Gln greater than Glu), suggesting that lysine 155 interacts with the gamma-phosphate of ATP bound at a single high affinity catalytic site. 4) The major determinant of inhibition of steady-state ATPase turnover rate in the mutant enzymes was an attenuation of positive catalytic cooperativity. 5) The data are consistent with the idea that during multisite catalysis residue 155 of beta-subunit undergoes conformational movement which changes substrate and product binding affinities."
https://openalex.org/W1532669610,"Abstract In an attempt to identify amino acid residues involved in proton translocation by the Fo sector of the Escherichia coli F1Fo-ATPase, 16 mutations at the carboxyl-terminal third of the a subunit have been isolated, and their phenotypes have been partially characterized. Thirteen mutations were constructed by cassette mutagenesis at two highly conserved residues, aglu196 and apro190. Two mutations were products of oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of a portion of of oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of a portion of the uncB gene cloned into an M13 vector. One mutation was isolated after in vitro mutagenesis of the entire uncB gene in a plasmid vector with hydroxylamine. Amino acid substitutions for aglu196 (Asp, Gln, His, Asn, Lys, Ala, Ser, Pro) affect ATP-driven proton translocation and passive proton permeability by Fo to varying extents, but do not prevent growth on minimal succinate media. Amino acid substitutions of glutamine or arginine for apro190 affect F1Fo-ATPase assembly and eliminate ATP-driven proton translocation, while the substitution of asparagine at this position does not significantly affect either assembly or proton translocation. The substitution of amino acids threonine or alanine for aser199 causes no detectable phenotypic change from wild type. These and other mutations are discussed in terms of the assembly, structure, and function of the a subunit. It is concluded that aglu196 and apro190 are not obligate components of the proton channel, but that they affect proton translocation indirectly."
https://openalex.org/W1523351848,"Acetyl-CoA carboxylase isolated from freeze-clamped livers of fed rats has relatively low phosphate content (5.0 mol of Pi/mol of subunit) and high specific activity (3.5 units/mg in the absence of citrate). The enzyme from rats fasted for 12, 18, 24, and 48 h exhibited decreasing specific activities of 2.75, 1.85, 1.7, and 0.9 units/mg, respectively. Citrate activated all preparations of carboxylase, with most activation observed with the least active preparation. There was no significant change in the sensitivity of the enzyme to citrate since half-maximal activation was observed at 0.2 mM for carboxylase from fed as well as fasted rats. With the decrease in activity as a function of fasting, there was a concomitant increase in the phosphate content of carboxylase, with values of 5.3, 5.6, 6.7, and 7.6 mol of Pi/mol of subunit obtained for preparations from rats fasted for 12, 18, 24, and 48 h, respectively. Refeeding the fasted rats resulted in increased specific activity of carboxylase (3.4 units/mg) and decreased phosphate content (5.1 mol of Pi/mol of subunit). Moreover, dephosphorylation by [acetyl-CoA carboxylase]-phosphatase 2 activated the carboxylase from 48-h fasted rats to a value of 2.9 units/mg, assayed in the absence of citrate, indicating that the low activity of carboxylase from fasted rats was due to its increased phosphate content. Superose 6 chromatography showed that the enzyme exists in two polymeric forms, a highly active polymer of greater than or equal to 40 subunits and less active octamer. The former predominates in livers of fed rats, whereas the latter predominates in livers of fasted rats. The octamer could be converted to the highly active polymer by dephosphorylation. These observations indicate that fasting/refeeding results in phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase with concomitant depolymerization/polymerization of the protein and ultimately decreasing or increasing its specific activity."
https://openalex.org/W1586410827,"We have studied the in vivo phosphorylation of clathrin-coated vesicle proteins from rat reticulocytes. The major 32P-labeled polypeptides of clathrin-coated vesicles isolated from metabolically labeled cells were the the 165-, 100-110-, and 50-kDa polypeptides of the assembly protein, the clathrin beta-light chain, and to a lesser extent the clathrin alpha-light chain. The phosphorylation of the assembled (particulate) and unassembled (soluble) pools of clathrin and assembly protein was compared by immunoprecipitating the respective protein complexes from particulate and soluble cell fractions. Although all the phosphorylated polypeptides were present in both fractions, the extent of labeling was protein and fraction specific: the apparent specific activities of the assembly protein 50-kDa polypeptide and clathrin light chain were higher in the unassembled pool, whereas those of the 100-110-kDa polypeptides were higher in the assembled pool. The amino acids and polypeptide fragments labeled in vivo appeared similar to those labeled in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1491550677,"After a 3-h incubation of Krebs II ascitic cells in the presence of phospholipase C from Clostridium welchii under nonlytic conditions, the incorporation of [3H] choline into phosphatidylcholine was increased 1.7-fold as compared to untreated cells. The total amounts of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingomyelin were unchanged up to 3 h of incubation. The limiting step in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis was the formation of CDP-choline catalyzed by CTP:choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.15) as monitored by the decrease in phosphocholine labeling following phospholipase C treatment of cells prelabeled with [3H]choline. The specific activity of homogenate cytidylyltransferase was increased about 1.6-fold in phospholipase C-treated cells. Specific activity of the membrane fraction was increased 2-fold, whereas cytosolic specific activity decreased in phospholipase C-treated cells. The activation of cytidylyltransferase was concomitant with translocation of the enzyme from the cytosol to the membrane fraction. The latter was further fractionated using a Percoll gradient that allowed an efficient separation between endoplasmic reticulum and other subcellular membranes. In control cells, particulate cytidylyltransferase activity co-migrated with the endoplasmic reticulum and ribosome markers and not with the plasma membrane. Also, in treated cells, the stimulation of cytidylyltransferase activity occurred at the endoplasmic reticulum level and did not involve either the external cell membrane or other cellular organelles including the Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, or mitochondria. Thus, our results demonstrate that a stimulus acting on the plasma membrane promotes the translocation of the soluble form of cytidylyltransferase specifically to the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W2399898412,"The adhesion of Escherichia coli to eukaryotic cells is mediated by proteinaceous surface appendages called fimbriae and complementary receptors on host cells. Although type 1 fimbriae, which contain a D-mannose-reactive lectin, have been well studied little is known about the binding mechanism of isolated fimbriae to individual cell receptors. This report describes the isolation and purification of a guinea pig erythrocyte receptor for type 1 fimbriae. Erythrocyte membranes were dissolved in 0.5% Triton X-100 and the receptor isolated and purified by affinity chromatography using type 1 fimbriae immobilized on Sepharose. The 65-kDa receptor, which inhibits the agglutination of guinea pig erythrocytes by type 1 fimbriated E. coli, has a pI of 8.5-8.7, and binds concanavalin A and type 1 fimbriae in a dose-dependent and saturable manner. The fimbrial binding activity of the receptor was reduced when treated with sodium metaperiodate, endoglycosidase H, trypsin, and V8 protease, suggesting the isolated receptor is a glycoprotein with N-linked carbohydrate units. Isolated type 1 fimbriae inhibited the binding of fimbriated E. coli to purified receptor in a dose- and time-related fashion. The calculated binding affinity was 6 X 10(6) M-1, a value consistent with the low binding affinity expected from previous studies of the agglutination of guinea pig erythrocytes by isolated type 1 fimbriae."
https://openalex.org/W1551856347,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) at picomolar concentrations has been previously shown to induce striking alterations of bovine adrenocortical cell differentiated functions, without detectable effect on growth activity (Feige, J.J., Cochet, C., and Chambaz, E. M. (1986) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 139, 693-700; Hotta, M., and Baird, A. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 7795-7799). Adrenocortical cells in culture could bind 125I-labeled TGF-beta through at least two different binding systems. The highest affinity TGF-beta binding exhibited a Kd value of 5.7 X 10(-10) M and a calculated capacity of about 100,000 sites/cell, while the low affinity system yielded values of 4.3 X 10(-8) M and 2 X 10(6) sites/cell, respectively. The 125I-labeled TGF-beta bound to adrenocortical cells could be cross-linked using disuccinimidyl suberate and subsequent electrophoretic analysis revealed that TGF-beta was associated with two major cell components of about 280 kDa and 70-75 kDa, respectively, the latter one being resolved as a labeled doublet. Thus bovine adrenocortical cells exhibit a TGF-beta receptor similar to that defined by Massague and co-workers (Cheifetz, S., Like, B., and Massague, J. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261,9972-9978) in other cell types. Various growth factors, including fibroblast growth factor, as well as established hormonal activators of adrenocortical cell differentiated functions, such as angiotensin II and adrenocorticotropin, were examined as to their effect on TGF-beta receptor activity. A striking increase in the number of high affinity TGF-beta receptors was selectively elicited by ACTH in the nanomolar concentration range. This effect was time- and dose-dependent and was mimicked by cell treatment with dibutyryl cyclic AMP or forskolin. However, the ACTH-induced increase in receptor number was not impaired when protein synthesis was blocked. It is concluded that bovine adrenocortical cells are typical target cells for TGF-beta. This endocrine system represents a model in which, for the first time, the level of TGF-beta receptor is shown to be under hormonal regulation through a cyclic AMP-dependent pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1581124244,"Pyridoxal 5‘-diphospho-5‘-adenosine (PLP-AMP), an adenine nucleotide affinity analog, was found to bind in a saturable fashion to isolated alpha-subunit from Escherichia coli F1-ATPase with a stoichiometry of one mol/mol and a Kd approximately 150 microM. The binding was shown to be specific by the following criteria: 1) ATP reduced the binding of PLP-AMP by 80%, and 2) PLP-AMP, like ATP, induced a conformational change which increased the mobility of alpha-subunit in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and rendered alpha-subunit resistant to mild trypsin proteolysis. A stable adduct was formed between isolated alpha-subunit and [3H] PLP-AMP after reduction with NaBH4. alpha-Subunit labeled to the extent of 0.4-0.7 mol/mol was digested with trypsin and subjected to high pressure liquid chromatography purification, yielding a single labeled peptide. Automated amino acid sequencing showed that residue alpha-Lys-201 was specifically labeled. The results suggest that Lys-201 occupies a position proximate to the phosphate groups of bound ATP in the alpha.ATP complex. PLP-AMP did not support repolymerization of isolated alpha-, beta-, and gamma-subunits, consistent with previous reports that subunit repolymerization in vitro is dependent upon the presence of nucleoside triphosphate. Further, PLP-AMP-labeled alpha-subunit could not be reconstituted with isolated beta- and gamma-subunits in the presence of ATP, showing that occupation of the alpha-subunit nucleotide site by PLP-AMP impairs normal subunit-subunit interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1565154099,"The mitochondrial ATPase is rapidly inactivated by the arginine selective reagent phenylglyoxal. Recently, the purported major reacting residue has been reported for the chloroplast enzyme (Viale, A. M., and Vallejos, R. H. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 4958-4962) corresponding to Arg-328 in the beta-subunit of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial ATPase, a highly conserved residue in the ATPase. This arginine residue was concluded to be in the active site of the ATPase and possibly involved in the binding of nucleotides. To test this hypothesis, site-directed mutagenesis of the yeast enzyme has been used to replace Arg-328 with alanine and lysine. The modified genes were transformed into a yeast strain, DMY111, which contained a null mutation in the gene coding for the beta-subunit of the ATPase. Both of the substitutions were functional in vivo as demonstrated by the ability of yeast transformants to grow on a nonfermentable carbon source. The water soluble F1-ATPase with Ala-328 and Lys-328 were extremely unstable, but could be stabilized with glycerol. The rate of enzymatic decay followed first order kinetics with half-lives of 1.1 and 4.0 min for the mutants with Ala-328 and Lys-328 in 10% and 5% glycerol, respectively, while the wild type enzyme was stable even in the absence of glycerol. Kinetic analysis of both ATPase and GTPase has been determined. The wild type enzyme had two observable apparent Km and Vmax values for ATPase which were 0.056 mM-1 and 67 units/min/mg and 0.140 mM-1 and 100 units/min/mg. The mutant enzyme containing Lys-328 showed similar kinetic values of 0.066 mM-1 and 23 units/min/mg and 0.300 mM-1 and 43 units/min/mg. The mutant enzyme containing Ala-328, however, only demonstrated a single site with values of 0.121 mM-1 and 45 units/min/mg. In contrast to ATPase activity, kinetic values for GTPase were nearly identical for the wild type and mutant enzymes. Opposite to predicted results, the mutant enzymes were more sensitive to the reagent phenylglyoxal. These results indicate that Arg-328 is important for protein stability, but not involved in catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1509371349,"Changes in the association of the catalytic subunit and the regulatory subunits of isozymes I and II of cAMP-dependent protein kinases (RI and RII, respectively) with the transcriptionally active chromatin fraction from rat liver were examined after a glucagon/theophylline injection and also after partial hepatectomy. Chromatin was partitioned into transcriptionally active and bulk, transcriptionally inactive fractions by digestion with micrococcal nuclease under appropriate conditions. In both experimental models, an increased content of catalytic and both RI and RII subunits was observed in chromatin fractions that were enriched in transcriptionally active DNA, particularly in the fraction associated with the residual nuclear matrix-lamina. The changes in the association of the subunits with these fractions paralleled the increases in intracellular cAMP levels and occurred in a time frame compatible with the changes in gene expression. The catalytic subunits could be removed from the nuclear matrix-lamina fraction by salt, whereas the two regulatory subunits remained tightly bound. The data support the concept of a direct role of the regulatory subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinases in the induction of gene expression. However, we were unable to confirm that RII possessed an intrinsic topoisomerase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1775166666,"Treatment of skins of newborn mice with the neutral protease Dispase in order to separate dermis and epidermis causes pronounced changes in the levels of transglutaminase activity in the epidermis. Two soluble transglutaminases, one anionic enzyme and one cationic enzyme, of Mr approximately 90,000 and approximately 50,000, respectively, are extracted from epidermis; and the activities of both enzymes increase as a function of the time of Dispase treatment of skin. When the anionic Mr approximately 90,000 enzyme is incubated with Dispase after its chromatographic isolation from epidermal extracts, it is converted to a lower molecular weight enzyme. Hair follicles isolated from dermis prepared by a 12-h Dispase treatment of the skin of newborn mice contain two soluble cationic transglutaminases, one of which is indistinguishable from that of epidermis and the other which is not seen in epidermis. Both of these hair follicle enzymes are of Mr approximately 50,000 and appear to exist in monomeric form. They have been partially purified. Based upon these findings, we suggest that transglutaminase processing and control occur during normal differentiation of keratinocytes in epidermis and of hair follicle epidermal cells in dermis and that production of the proper forms of the enzyme may be essential to the formation of mature cornified envelopes and hair shafts, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1968831536,"Incubation of [gamma-32P]ATP with a molar excess of the soluble, homogeneous ATPase from beef heart mitochondria (F1) results in binding of substrate primarily in a single, very high affinity (KA = 10(12) M-1) catalytic site and in a slow rate of hydrolysis characteristic of single site catalysis. Subsequent addition of millimolar concentrations of nonradioactive ATP as a cold chase, sufficient to fill catalytic sites on the enzyme, results in an acceleration of hydrolysis of bound radioactive ATP of as much as 10(6)-fold, that is, to Vmax rates (Cross, R.L., Grubmeyer, C., and Penefsky, H.S. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 12101-12105). For this reason, it was proposed that the high affinity catalytic site is a normal catalytic site on the molecule. Recently, Bullough et al. (Bullough, D.A., Verburg, J.G., Yoshida, M., and Allison, W.A. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 11675-11683) reported that when 5 to 20 microM concentrations of nonradioactive ATP were added as a cold chase to an enzyme-substrate complex consisting of F1 and ATP bound to the high affinity catalytic site, hydrolysis of the chase was commensurate with the turnover rate of the enzyme, whereas the hydrolysis of bound ATP was considerably slower. These authors suggested that the high affinity catalytic site on F1 is not a normal catalytic site. This paper shows, in experiments with a rapid mixing-chemical quench apparatus, that hydrolysis of ATP bound in the high affinity catalytic site is accelerated to Vmax rates following addition of 5 microM ATP as a cold chase. Hydrolysis of bound ATP appears to precede that of the chase. The weight of the available evidence continues to support the original suggestion that the high affinity catalytic site of beef heart F1 is a normal catalytic site."
https://openalex.org/W208281678,"We have isolated a complex of two proteins from bovine kidney that bind to adenosine deaminase immobilized on Sepharose 4B. One protein, with Mr = 110,000, comigrates on both PAGE and SDS-PAGE gels with complexing protein isolated from rabbit kidney by the method of Schrader et al. (Schrader, W.P., Harder, C. M., and Schrader, D. K. (1983) Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Comp. Biochem. 75, 119-126). The second protein has a Mr = 70,000. Both proteins bind to the adenosine deaminase-Sepharose but not to a control resin of bovine serum albumin bound to Sepharose. Based on a comparison of partial and complete denaturation on SDS-PAGE the two proteins appear to be bound to each other. At adenosine concentrations of 0.5-1 mM the isolated complexing protein increases small subunit adenosine deaminase catalytic activity by 20-30%. There may be some inhibition of catalytic activity at low adenosine concentrations. We have designated the 110,000 Mr protein CP-I, the 70,000 Mr protein CP-II and the complex of these two CP."
https://openalex.org/W1557642005,"Biochemical and immunological analysis of unfertilized sea urchin eggs has revealed the presence of at least two distinct isoforms of cytoplasmic dyneins, one soluble and the other microtubule-associated. The soluble enzyme is a 20 S particle with a MgATPase activity that can be activated 5-fold by nonionic detergents. It contains heavy chain polypeptides that 1) comigrate with the dynein heavy chains of embryonic cilia; 2) cross-react with antibodies against flagellar dynein; and 3) are cleaved by UV irradiation in the presence of MgATP and sodium vanadate into specific peptide fragments. The soluble egg dynein is, therefore, closely related to axonemal dynein and may be a ciliary precursor. Egg microtubule preparations contain a distinct dynein-like polypeptide, previously designated HMr-3 (Scholey, J.M., Neighbors, B., McIntosh, J.R., and Salmon, E.D. (1984) J. Biol Chem. 259, 6516-6525). HMr-3 binds microtubules in an ATP-sensitive fashion; it sediments at 20 S on sucrose density gradients, and it is susceptible to vanadate-sensitized UV cleavage. However, HMr-3 can be distinguished from the soluble cytoplasmic dynein on the basis of its weak cross-reactivity with antiflagellar dynein antibodies, its heavy chain composition on high resolution sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, its low specific ATPase activity, and the molecular weight of its vanadate-induced UV cleavage fragments. HMr-3 may represent a dynein-like polypeptide that is distinct from the pool of ciliary dynein precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1512948953,"When heat-activated F1-ATPase from chloroplasts was repeatedly exposed to Mg2+ and 2-azido-ATP, followed by separation from medium nucleotides and photolysis, a total of two sites per enzyme, both catalytic and noncatalytic, were labeled. In a coupled assay with pyruvate kinase about half the activity was lost when one site per enzyme was modified. However, increased modification resulted in no further loss of activity. In contrast, methanol-sulfite activation of the enzyme showed a loss of most of the catalytic capacity when one site per enzyme was modified. Predominant labeling of either one catalytic or one noncatalytic site caused a loss of most of the activity in either assay. An indication that the enzyme modified at one site retained some catalytic activity was verified by measurement of the [18O]Pi species formed when [gamma-18O]ATP was hydrolyzed by partially derivatized enzyme. With either catalytic or noncatalytic site modification, the distributions of [18O]Pi species formed showed that the modified enzyme had different catalytic characteristics. An interpretation is that with modification by azido nucleotides at either catalytic or noncatalytic sites, capacity for rapid catalysis is largely lost but the remaining sites retain weak modified catalytic properties."
https://openalex.org/W1608516820,"After oxidative damage (e.g. induced with iron, ascorbate, and oxygen), the inactivated glutamine synthetase is selectively hydrolyzed in extracts of Escherichia coli. We therefore tested if glutamine synthetase treated with this system is hydrolyzed preferentially by any of the known E. coli proteases. Protease So, a cytoplasmic serine protease, was found to degrade the oxidized form of glutamine synthetase to acid-soluble peptides 5-10 times faster than the native glutamine synthetase. Degradation of the oxidized glutamine synthetase was inhibited by EDTA and stimulated 5-10-fold by Mg2+, Ca2+, or Mn2+, even though casein hydrolysis by protease So is not affected by divalent cations. Apparently, these cations affect the conformation of this substrate, making it more susceptible to proteolytic attack. Protease Re, another cytoplasmic protease, also degrades preferentially the oxidized form of glutamine synthetase and seems to correspond to the glutamine synthetase-degrading activity recently described by Roseman and Levine [1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 2101-2110). However, it is much less active in this reaction than protease So. No other soluble E. coli protease, including Do, Ci, Mi, Fa, Pi, or the ATP-dependent proteases Ti and La (the lon product), appears to degrade this oxidized protein. These results suggest that protease So participates in the hydrolysis of oxidatively damaged proteins and that E. coli has multiple systems for degrading different types of aberrant proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1595138980,"Plasmid pRPG54, which carries the genes for the eight subunits of the proton-translocating ATPase of Escherichia coli, has been found to carry a single base change of a G to an A in the ribosome-binding site for uncE, the gene which codes for the N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-binding subunit c of the Fo. This noncoding region mutation both lowers expression of uncE by a factor of 2-3 and affects the function of the ATPase, specifically of the Fo sector. The presence of the mutation results in a decrease in the proton permeability of the Fo or of the entire F1Fo-ATPase complex when either is synthesized from genes on a multicopy plasmid. Expression of uncE from an F1Fo plasmid carrying the wild type ribosome binding site results in increased membrane proton permeability and decreased ability of the resultant ATPase to couple a transmembrane proton gradient to ATP synthesis both in vitro and in vivo. Also, although an Fo plasmid carrying the correct ribosome-binding site causes harmful, F1-dependent proton permeability in unc+ cells (Brusilow, W. S. S. (1987) J. Bacteriol. 169, 4984-4990), an identical plasmid carrying the mutation does not, even though it still codes for a functional reconstitutable Fo. The results show a relationship between the relative level of expression of uncE from a multicopy plasmid and the assembly pathway, proton permeability, and energy-coupling characteristics of the ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1499904928,"Pathways of ammonia assimilation into glutamic acid in Bacillus azotofixans, a recently characterized nitrogen-fixing species of Bacillus, were investigated through observation by NMR spectroscopy of in vivo incorporation of 15N into glutamine and glutamic acid in the absence and presence of inhibitors of ammonia-assimilating enzymes, in combination with measurements of the specific activities of glutamate dehydrogenase, glutamine synthetase, glutamate synthase, and alanine dehydrogenase. In ammonia-grown cells, both the glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase and the glutamate dehydrogenase pathways contribute to the assimilation of ammonia into glutamic acid. In nitrate-grown and nitrogen-fixing cells, the glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase pathway was found to be predominant. NADPH-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase activity was detectable at low levels only in ammonia-grown and glutamate-grown cells. Thus, B. azotofixans differs from Bacillus polymyxa and Bacillus macerans, but resembles other N2-fixing prokaryotes studied previously, as to the pathway of ammonia assimilation during ammonia limitation. Implications of the results for an emerging pattern of ammonia assimilation by alternative pathways among nitrogen-fixing prokaryotes are discussed, as well as the utility of 15N NMR for measuring in vivo glutamate synthase activity in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1521063009,"Livers of starved rats refed for 2 h were perfused in situ by a modification of the dual digitonin pulse technique of Quistorff and Grunnet (Quistorff, B., and Grunnet, N. (1987) Biochem. J. 243, 87-95). A pulse of digitonin (2 mg/ml) was infused first antegrade through the portal vein followed retrograde through the vena cava, or in reverse order, 13 mg of digitonin per zone. Microscopic examination showed that this procedure permeabilized the periportal and perivenous zones of the liver without overlap, with a narrow unaffected band of hepatocytes between the zones. The distribution pattern between periportal and perivenous zones ratio for alanine transaminase, lactate hydrogenase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase ranged from 1.5 to 3. Glucokinase activity was higher in the perivenous zone (periportal/perivenous ratio of 0.7) and glutamine synthetase was exclusively present in that zone. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate concentration was nearly equal in the two zones."
https://openalex.org/W1587109830,"Abstract Bordetella pertussis, the etiologic agent of whooping cough, produces a calmodulin-sensitive adenylate cyclase which elevates intracellular cAMP in a variety of eucaryotic cells. Exogenous calmodulin added to the partially purified adenylate cyclase has been shown to inhibit invasion of animal cells by this enzyme (Shattuck, R. L., and Storm, D. R. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 6323-6328). In this study, several properties of the calmodulin-sensitive adenylate cyclase are shown to be influenced by Ca2+ in the absence of calmodulin. The presence or absence of Ca2+ during QAE-Sephadex ion exchange chromatography produced two distinct chromatographic patterns of adenylate cyclase activity. Two different forms of the enzyme (Pk1 and Pk2EGTA) were isolated by this procedure. Pk1 adenylate cyclase readily elevated intracellular cAMP levels in mouse neuroblastoma cells (N1E-115) while Pk2EGTA adenylate cyclase had no effect on cAMP levels in these cells. Gel exclusion chromatography of Pk1 adenylate cyclase gave apparent Stokes radii (RS) of 43.5 A (+/- 1.3) in the presence of 2 mM CaCl2 and 33.8 A (+/- 0.94) in the presence of 2 mM EGTA [( ethylenebis (oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid). These Stokes radii are consistent with molecular weights of 104,000 (+/- 6,400) and 61,000 (+/- 3,600), respectively. Pk2EGTA adenylate cyclase had an apparent RS of 33.0 (+/- 1.2) (Mr = 60,600 (+/- 2,800] in the presence of Ca2+ or excess EGTA. At 60 degrees C, Pk1 adenylate cyclase exhibited a Ca2+-dependent heat stability with a half-life for loss of enzyme activity of 10.3 min in 5 mM CaCl2 and a half-life of 2.8 min in the presence of 0.1 microM CaCl2. The stability of Pk2EGTA adenylate cyclase was not affected by changes in free Ca2+. The adenylate cyclase preparations described above were submitted to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and enzyme activity was recovered from gel slices by extraction with detergent containing buffers. The catalytic subunit isolated from SDS-polyacrylamide gels was activated 7-fold in the presence of Ca2+ with maximum activity observed at 1 microM free Ca2+. With both preparations, the apparent molecular weight of the catalytic subunit on SDS gels was 51,000 in the presence of 2 mM CaCl2 and 45,000 in the presence of 2 mM EGTA. The catalytic subunit of the enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity by preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and resubmitted to SDS gel electrophoresis in the presence or absence of free Ca2+. The purified catalytic subunit also exhibited a Ca2+-dependent shift in its mobility on SDS gels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1600361939,"We have demonstrated that icosanoid production can be inhibited by altering the distribution of arachidonate within the cell, so that it is not released from phospholipids for icosanoid synthesis. This effect was observed in a prostaglandin E2-producing cell line (HSDM1C1) by deprivation of exogenous arachidonate for 24-48 h. Icosanoid production by the cells upon bradykinin stimulation was impaired despite no change in the concentration of arachidonate within the cell and no change in the activity of cyclooxygenase, phospholipases, acyltransferases, or fatty acyl-CoA hydrolase. Associated with the decline in prostaglandin E2 production was an increase in arachidonate incorporation into ethanolamine plasmalogens and a decrease in the activity of the enzyme arachidonoyl-CoA synthetase, which may play a role in compartmentation of arachidonate within the cell. Thus, we have found that a decrease in icosanoid production can be achieved without pharmacologic intervention by a short-term restriction of exogenous arachidonate which leads to redistribution of arachidonate within phospholipids and/or subcellular membranes in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1490992656,"Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was found to bind specifically to a 100,000 x g pellet prepared from bovine adrenal medulla. The PGE receptor was associated with a GTP-binding protein (G-protein) and could be covalently cross-linked with this G-protein by dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) in the 100,000 x g pellet (Negishi, M., Ito, S., Tanaka, T., Yokohama, H., Hayashi, H., Katada, T., Ui, M., and Hayaishi, O. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 12077-12084). In order to characterize the G-protein associated with the PGE receptor and reconstitute these proteins in phospholipid vesicles, we purified the G-protein to apparent homogeneity from the 100,000 x g pellet. The G-protein served as a substrate of pertussis toxin but differed in its alpha subunit from two known pertussis toxin substrate G-proteins (Gi and Go) purified from bovine brain. The molecular weight of the alpha subunit was 40,000, which is between those of Gi and Go. The purified protein was also distinguished immunologically from Gi and Go and was referred to as Gam. PGE receptor was solubilized by 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid and freed from G-proteins by wheat germ agglutinin column chromatography. Reconstitution of the PGE receptor with pure Gam, Gi, or Go in phospholipid vesicles resulted in a remarkable restoration of [3H]PGE2 binding activity in a GTP-dependent manner. The efficiency of these three G-proteins in this capacity was roughly equal. When pertussis toxin- or N-ethylmaleimide-treated G-proteins, instead of the native ones, were reconstituted into vesicles, the restoration of binding activity was no longer observed. The displacement of [3H]PGE2 binding was specific for PGE1 and PGE2. Furthermore, addition of PGE2 stimulated the GTPase activity of the G-proteins in reconstituted vesicles. These results indicate that the PGE receptor can couple functionally with Gam, Gi, or Go in phospholipid vesicles and suggest that Gam may be involved in signal transduction of the PGE receptor in bovine adrenal medulla."
https://openalex.org/W1519290271,Post-translational import of the F1-ATPase beta-subunit precursor into isolated mitochondria requires both an energized inner membrane and nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis on the organelle surface. Nested internal deletions of the F1 beta-precursor which progressively move a 128-residue carboxyl-terminal domain of the protein closer to the amino terminus reveal an abrupt transition between residues 122 and 144 to a form of the protein which is imported in the absence of added ATP. This transition region of the F1 beta-precursor is the same sequence which we have defined in earlier studies is required for formation of a tetramer following in vitro translation of the F1 beta-precursor. These data indicate that part of the requirement for ATP in the import of mitochondrial precursors may be involved in the reorganization of oligomeric species on the membrane surface which are formed following their translation.
https://openalex.org/W1567450320,"An engineered calmodulin differs from vertebrate calmodulin in its ability to activate Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase, and this difference has been utilized as the basis for a new purification protocol for the adenylate cyclase. VU-8 calmodulin, in which 3 glutamic acid residues (residues 82-84) have been substituted with 3 lysine residues, has a 1000-fold lower apparent affinity for the adenylate cyclase, compared to vertebrate calmodulin, and decreased maximal activity. Because of the relatively calcium-independent nature of the interaction between calmodulin and the cyclase, the use of calmodulin-Sepharose conjugates in the purification of the cyclase requires the use of chaotropic agents for elution. However, when immobilized VU-8 calmodulin was tested as a calcium-dependent, affinity-based, adsorption chromatography step in the purification of the cyclase from culture media or bacterial extracts, the enzyme bound to the column in a calcium-dependent manner, and a nearly homogeneous enzyme was obtained in high yield. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using engineered calmodulins that have selective differences in activity for the rational design of rapid purification protocols for calmodulin-binding proteins as well as indicate the importance of the conserved negative charge cluster at residues 82-84 of calmodulin for activation of this cyclase."
