https://openalex.org/W3209586559,"This exploration primarily aims to jointly apply the local FCN (fully convolution neural network) and YOLO-v5 (You Only Look Once-v5) to the detection of small targets in remote sensing images. Firstly, the application effects of R-CNN (Region-Convolutional Neural Network), FRCN (Fast Region-Convolutional Neural Network), and R-FCN (Region-Based-Fully Convolutional Network) in image feature extraction are analyzed after introducing the relevant region proposal network. Secondly, YOLO-v5 algorithm is established on the basis of YOLO algorithm. Besides, the multi-scale anchor mechanism of Faster R-CNN is utilized to improve the detection ability of YOLO-v5 algorithm for small targets in the image in the process of image detection, and realize the high adaptability of YOLO-v5 algorithm to different sizes of images. Finally, the proposed detection method YOLO-v5 algorithm + R-FCN is compared with other algorithms in NWPU VHR-10 data set and Vaihingen data set. The experimental results show that the YOLO-v5 + R-FCN detection method has the optimal detection ability among many algorithms, especially for small targets in remote sensing images such as tennis courts, vehicles, and storage tanks. Moreover, the YOLO-v5 + R-FCN detection method can achieve high recall rates for different types of small targets. Furthermore, due to the deeper network architecture, the YOL v5 + R-FCN detection method has a stronger ability to extract the characteristics of image targets in the detection of remote sensing images. Meanwhile, it can achieve more accurate feature recognition and detection performance for the densely arranged target images in remote sensing images. This research can provide reference for the application of remote sensing technology in China, and promote the application of satellites for target detection tasks in related fields."

Here we present an atomic model of the 48-nm repeat of a mammalian DMT, derived from a cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) map of the complex isolated from bovine respiratory cilia. The structure uncovers principles of doublet microtubule organization and features specific to vertebrate cilia, including previously unknown MIPs, a luminal bundle of tektin filaments, and a pentameric dynein-docking complex. We identify a mechanism for bridging 48- to 24-nm periodicity across the microtubule wall and show that loss of the proteins involved causes defective ciliary motility and laterality abnormalities in zebrafish and mice. Our structure identifies candidate genes for diagnosis of ciliopathies and provides a framework to understand their functions in driving ciliary motility."

We found that following enteric infections, muscularis macrophages (MMs) acquire a tissue-protective phenotype that prevents neuronal loss, dysmotility, and maintains energy balance during subsequent challenge with unrelated pathogens. Bacteria-induced neuroprotection relied on activation of gut-projecting sympathetic neurons and signaling via β2-adrenergic receptors (β2AR) on MMs. In contrast, helminth-mediated neuroprotection was dependent on T cells and systemic production of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 by eosinophils, which induced arginase-expressing MMs that prevented neuronal loss from an unrelated infection located in a different intestinal region.

Collectively, these data suggest that distinct enteric pathogens trigger a state of disease or tissue tolerance that preserves ENS number and functionality. The gastrointestinal (GI) tract needs to simultaneously generate tolerance to harmless or beneficial dietary and microbial antigens and resistance to pathogen invasion. Additionally, disease tolerance to pathogen- and inflammation-induced tissue damage must operate in the intestine to maintain homeostasis (Medzhitov et al., 2012Medzhitov R. Schneider D.S.

This is particularly relevant for cells with reduced proliferative or regenerative capacity, such as enteric neurons, which are abundantly present in the gut and serve to modulate intestinal motility and secretory function (Balemans et al., 2017Balemans D.

Yet, whether a state of tolerance can be induced after exposure to pathogens, preventing cumulative neuronal loss and functional changes, is still not known. We investigated possible tolerance mechanisms preventing neuronal loss and disruption in gut motility after pathogen exposure. We found that following helminth or bacterial infection, and via distinct pathways, muscularis macrophages (MMs) acquire tissue-protective qualities and prevent neuronal loss during subsequent challenge with an unrelated pathogen. Collectively, our data suggest that distinct enteric pathogens trigger a state of tolerance aimed to preserve the numbers and functionality of the enteric nervous system (ENS). To test whether primary infection can prevent neuronal loss after secondary challenge with an unrelated pathogen, we used an attenuated strain of Salmonella Typhimurium, spiB, which harbors a mutation in the type-III secretion system, impacting its intracellular replication (Tsolis et al., 1999Tsolis R.M. Townsend S.M. Miao E.A. Miller S.I. Ficht T.A. Adams L.G. Bäumler A.J. Identification of a putative Salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium host range factor with homology to IpaH and YopM by signature-tagged mutagenesis.Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6385-6393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to wild-type Salmonella, spiB is not lethal and is cleared from wild-type C57BL/6 mice in 7–10 days, inducing a less severe form of Salmonellosis; nevertheless, spiB infection is sufficient to induce rapid neuronal loss and long-term dysmotility (Matheis et al., 2020Matheis F. Muller P.A. Graves C.L. Gabanyi I. Kerner Z.J. Costa-Borges D. Ahrends T. Rosenstiel P. Mucida D. Adrenergic Signaling in Muscularis Macrophages Limits Infection-Induced Neuronal Loss.Cell. 2020; 180: 64-78.e16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We thus first asked whether primary infection with an unrelated bacterium influences the tissue’s response to a subsequent exposure to spiB. We used Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (Yp), which like Salmonella, is a foodborne Gram-negative bacterium that primarily localizes to the ileum (Fonseca et al., 2015Fonseca D.M. Hand T.W. Han S.J. Gerner M.Y. Glatman Zaretsky A. Byrd A.L. Harrison O.J. Ortiz A.M. Quinones M. Trinchieri G. et al.Microbiota-Dependent Sequelae of Acute Infection Compromise Tissue-Specific Immunity.Cell. 2015; 163: 354-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), causing a transient infection undetectable in the feces by 21 days post-infection (dpi) (Figure 1A). Primary infection with Yp led to significant neuronal loss, however, not as pronounced as after primary spiB infection. Additionally, as suggested by our recent studies (Matheis et al., 2020Matheis F. Muller P.A. Graves C.L. Gabanyi I. Kerner Z.J. Costa-Borges D. Ahrends T. Rosenstiel P. Mucida D. Adrenergic Signaling in Muscularis Macrophages Limits Infection-Induced Neuronal Loss.Cell. 2020; 180: 64-78.e16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), spiB exposure following an earlier Yp infection did not result in further neuronal loss (Figure 1B). This was not a result of an improved resistance to spiB as mice previously infected with Yp displayed similar pathogen load and clearance pattern to naive mice (Figure 1C). Disease tolerance strategies alleviate the fitness costs by promoting resilience in the presence of an insult (Ayres, 2020Ayres J.S. The Biology of Physiological Health.Cell. 2020; 181: 250-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because one of the main roles of the ENS regarding fitness cost is the control of intestinal motility, we measured GI transit time as a functional readout for neuronal loss. Decreased enteric neuron numbers generally correlated with increased GI transit time, whereas spiB infection led to increased GI transit time, previous Yp infection preserved gut motility after subsequent spiB challenge (Figure 1D). These results point to development of tissue or disease tolerance (Ayres, 2020Ayres J.S. The Biology of Physiological Health.Cell. 2020; 181: 250-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar; Martins et al., 2019Martins R. Carlos A.R. Braza F. Thompson J.A.

Immunol. 2019; 37: 405-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) post-bacterial infection, which prevented neuronal loss to subsequent infection with a different pathogen. We have previously shown that MMs quickly acquire a tissue-protective phenotype and limit enteric neuron loss during primary spiB infection via β2 adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) signaling and arginase 1 (Arg1)-dependent polyamine production by MMs (Gabanyi et al., 2016Gabanyi I. Muller P.A. Feighery L. Oliveira T.Y. Costa-Pinto F.A. Mucida D.

To test whether Yp-induced tolerance relied on MMs, we used anti-CSF1R antibody, which selectively depletes MMs while preserving lamina propria macrophages (LpM) when administered at 50 mg/kg, and does not affect neuronal numbers (Matheis et al., 2020Matheis F.

Verheijden S. Aguilera-Lizarraga J. Viola M.F. Boesmans W. Stakenborg N. Voytyuk I. Schmidt I. Boeckx B.

Administration of anti-CSF1R antibody to mice post Yp clearance led to a pronounced neuronal loss following challenge with spiB, suggesting the requirement for MMs to maintain Yp-induced neuronal protection (Figure 1E). Flow cytometric analysis of the ileum from mice after primary infection revealed that Yp infection leads to the upregulation of Arg1 by MMs beyond a basal level (Figures 1F and 1G). To examine whether heightened Arg1 expression by MMs is required for Yp-induced neuroprotection, we used LysMΔArg1 mice, in which Arg1 is conditionally deleted in myeloid cells. Yp-mediated neuroprotection was abolished in LysMΔArg1 following challenge with spiB infection (Figure 1H). Moreover, this neuroprotective mechanism also required β2-AR expression by MMs, because LysMΔAdrb2 mice previously infected with Yp showed significant neuronal loss compared to wild-type littermate control mice upon spiB infection (Figure 1I). This effect correlated with decreased Arg1 expression by MMs and increased GI transit-time (Figures 1J and 1K). Consistently, although disease tolerance was impaired by both Arg1 and β2-AR targeting on MMs, spiB load was not affected by these strategies (Figures S1A and S1B). These results indicate that primary bacterial infection results in a state of disease tolerance that mediates neuroprotection to subsequent infections, preserving intestinal motility. Next, we asked whether infection-induced neuroprotection could be induced by other pathogens. We aimed to determine whether helminths, which co-evolved with mammals and typically induce a very distinct immune response to bacterial pathogens, could prevent neuronal loss. We chose to infect mice with Strongyloides venezulenesis (Sv), a parasitic nematode that causes an acute infection and primarily localizes to the duodenum (Esterházy et al., 2019Esterházy D.

Immun. 2002; 70: 6263-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Initial Sv infection was cleared by 12 dpi and, contrary to the bacterial pathogens we tested, it did not lead to neuronal loss in the ileum or duodenum (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2A) (Matheis et al., 2020Matheis F. Muller P.A. Graves C.L. Gabanyi I. Kerner Z.J. Costa-Borges D. Ahrends T. Rosenstiel P. Mucida D. Adrenergic Signaling in Muscularis Macrophages Limits Infection-Induced Neuronal Loss.Cell. 2020; 180: 64-78.e16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, primary Sv duodenum infection completely prevented neuronal loss in the ileum and colon following subsequent spiB challenge (Figures 2B and S2B). This distal protection by previous, proximal Sv infection was not associated with changes in spiB load and resulted in the maintenance of normal gut motility (Figures 2C and 2D).Figure S2Helminth infections induce tissue tolerance, related to Figure 2Show full caption(A and B) C57BL/6J mice were s.c. injected with water and then orally gavaged with PBS (non-infected, NI), 109 colony-forming units (CFU) of Salmonella spiB, or subcutaneously injected with 700 S. venezuelensis (Sv) larvae only or 700 Sv larvae and 14 days later with 109 CFU of spiB.

Error bars indicate SD, ns – not significant, ∗p ≤ 0.05 (unpaired Student’s t test or ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test). We addressed whether enteric neuronal loss-associated dysmotility also affected feeding behavior and activity of mice. Using CLAMS or metabolic cages, we found that spiB challenge resulted in higher food intake in mice that had not been previously infected with Sv; changes that did not translate into higher weight (Figures S2C and S2D). Moreover, spiB infection led to higher ambulatory activity and increased energy balance, all of which were prevented by initial Sv infection (Figures S2E and S2F). These observations point to a deficient nutrient absorption in spiB-infected mice, possibly associated with the loss of enteric neurons and prevented by previous helminth infection. Although the proximal intestine helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus (Hp) was recently shown to impair anti-neurotropic virus immunity (Desai et al., 2021Desai P. Janova H. White J.P. Reynoso G.V. Hickman H.D. Baldridge M.T. Urban Jr., J.F. Stappenbeck T.S. Thackray L.B. Diamond M.S.

Moreover, initial Sv infection also led to neuroprotection after subsequent Yp challenge (Figure S2H). Consistent with a disease tolerance phenotype, primary Sv or Hp infection did not affect subsequent clearance of spiB or Yp, respectively (Figures S2I and S2J). Sv-induced tolerance depended on MMs, as evidenced by anti-CSF1R antibody-mediated depletion of MMs post Sv clearance, which abolished the neuroprotection upon spiB infection (Figure 2E). Following Sv challenge, ∼80% of MMs expressed Arg1, compared to ∼60% observed after spiB infection (Figures 2F and S2F). MMs in the duodenum expressed heightened Arg1 already at steady state compared to the ileum, and this was not further increased following spiB or Sv infection (Figure S2K). Sv infection also influenced mucosal macrophages beyond the site of infection, evidenced by increased frequencies of Arg1+ MMs in colon and lung, but did not change Arg1 expression by spleen macrophages (Figures S2L–S2N). In contrast to wild-type mice, LysMΔArg1 mice infected with Sv displayed neuronal loss, which was nevertheless maintained upon subsequent spiB infection (Figure 2G). In opposition to Yp, Sv infection did not result in activation of gut-projecting sympathetic neurons (Figure 2H). In contrast to the phenotype observed post Yp, Sv-mediated neuronal protection to subsequent spiB infection was maintained in LysMΔAdrb2 mice. Mice lacking β2-AR signaling in myeloid cells previously infected with Sv also sustained similar neuronal numbers, Arg1 expression by MMs, and GI transit time upon spiB infection as wild-type littermate controls (Figures 2I–2K). Moreover, initial infection with Sv did not affect spiB load and clearance in either LysMΔAdrb2 and LysMΔArg1 mice (Figures S2O and S2P). These results indicate that although converging on neuroprotective MMs, Yp- and Sv-induced disease tolerance mechanisms are distinct. We also examined how long Sv-mediated neuroprotection is maintained after the initial infection is cleared. Subsequent spiB challenge up to 12 weeks after primary Sv infection did not result in any neuronal loss. Challenge at 24 weeks post-infection did result in significant neuronal loss, however, the enteric neuron numbers were still higher when compared to controls infected with spiB only (Figure 2L). Long-term enteric neuron protection correlated with sustained high expression of Arg1 in MMs observed up to 12 weeks post-infection (Figure 2M). These results reveal a long-term neuroprotection in the ileum induced by a single duodenal helminth infection. Finally, we performed transcriptomic analysis of ileum MMs isolated from non-infected mice or from mice infected with spiB, Yp, or Sv. Comparison between different infections resulted in a low number differentially regulated genes, indicating a significant overlap in MM phenotype induced by different types of enteric infection (Figures 3A–3C). Comparison of gene expression profiles between MMs isolated from all infected versus non-infected mice revealed a broad tissue-protective signature that included wound healing genes, characteristic of alternatively activated macrophages (Figure 3D; Table S1), confirming and extending our previous observations (Gabanyi et al., 2016Gabanyi I. Muller P.A. Feighery L. Oliveira T.Y. Costa-Pinto F.A. Mucida D.

This gene signature was highly enriched in previously published transcriptomic data from human “alternatively activated” (Pello et al., 2012Pello O.M. De Pizzol M. Mirolo M. Soucek L. Zammataro L. Amabile A. Doni A. Nebuloni M. Swigart L.B. Evan G.I. et al.Role of c-MYC in alternative activation of human macrophages and tumor-associated macrophage biology.Blood. 2012; 119: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and “tolerogenic macrophages” (Mages et al., 2007Mages J. Dietrich H. Lang R. A genome-wide analysis of LPS tolerance in macrophages.Immunobiology. 2007; 212: 723-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (Figures 3E and 3F). These data indicate that regardless of the type of infection, proximal versus distal upstream stimuli, MMs acquire a default tissue-protective gene signature, resembling murine and human “M2-like” phenotype. To identify the mechanism responsible for the long-term helminth-driven disease tolerance, we further characterized the immune response to Sv. Helminths are known to drive a robust type-2 immunity, with accumulation of innate immune cells, including tuft cells, eosinophils, and group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), and later CD4+ T helper 2 (Th2) cells (Maizels, 2020Maizels R.M.

We observed an accumulation of Gata3+ CD4+ “Th2” cells in the duodenum, but not in the ileum LP following Sv infection, which was further increased when mice underwent subsequent spiB infection (Figures 4A and S3A). Additionally, we found a significant increase in the frequencies of mucosal mast cells and eosinophils in the lamina propria (LP) and intraepithelial (IE) compartments of the ileum and duodenum of Sv-infected mice (Figures 4B, 4C, S3B, and S3C). At steady state, however, the duodenum harbored higher numbers of eosinophils than the ileum, the former reaching almost 80% of total CD45+ cells found in the LP post Sv-infection (Figures 4B and 4C). Of note, duodenal eosinophilia was maintained for up to 12 weeks post-infection and diminished at week 24 (Figure 4D), reflecting changes observed in MMs, GI transit time, and neuroprotection post-Sv infection described above. Consistent with an overall heightened type-2 immunity, serum of Sv-infected mice showed prolonged increase in interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 levels (Figures 4E and 4F) that was not affected by subsequent spiB infection (Figure S3D).Figure S3Helminth-induced neuroprotection depends on IL-5, related to Figure 3Show full caption(A-D) C57BL/6J mice were s.c. injected with water (non-infected, NI) or infected with spiB, Sv only or Sv and 14 days later with spiB.

This study sought to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, describe attitudes related to vaccination, and identify correlates among historically marginalized populations across 9 counties in North Carolina.We conducted a cross-sectional survey distributed at free COVID-19 testing events in underserved rural and urban communities from August 27 -December 15, 2020. Vaccine hesitancy was defined as the response of ""no"" or ""don't know/not sure"" to whether the participant would get the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it became available.The sample comprised 948 participants including 27.7% Whites, 59.6% Blacks, 12.7% Latinx, and 63% female. 32% earned <$20K annually, 60% owned a computer and ~80% had internet access at home. The prevalence of vaccine hesitancy was 68.9% including 62.7%, 74%, and 59.5% among Whites, Blacks, and Latinx, respectively. Between September and December, the largest decline in vaccine hesitancy occurred among Whites (27.5 percentage points), followed by Latinx (17.6) and only 12.0 points among Blacks. 51.2% of respondents reported vaccine safety concerns, 23.7% wanted others to get vaccinated first, and 63.1% would trust health care providers about the COVID-19 vaccine. Factors associated with hesitancy in multivariable logistic regression included being female (OR = 1.90 95%CI [1.36, 2.64]), being Black (OR = 1.68 1.16, 2.45]), calendar month (OR = 0.76 [0.63, 0.92]), safety concerns (OR = 4.28 [3.06, 5.97]), and government distrust (OR = 3.57 [2.26, 5.63]).This study engaged the community to directly reach underserved minority populations at highest risk of COVID-19 that permitted assessment of vaccine hesitancy (which was much higher than national estimates), driven in part by distrust, and safety concerns."
https://openalex.org/W3210270341,"The timing of self-initiated actions shows large variability even when they are executed in stable, well-learned sequences. Could this mix of reliability and stochasticity arise within the same neural circuit? We trained rats to perform a stereotyped sequence of self-initiated actions and recorded neural ensemble activity in secondary motor cortex (M2), which is known to reflect trial-by-trial action-timing fluctuations. Using hidden Markov models, we established a dictionary between activity patterns and actions. We then showed that metastable attractors, representing activity patterns with a reliable sequential structure and large transition timing variability, could be produced by reciprocally coupling a high-dimensional recurrent network and a low-dimensional feedforward one. Transitions between attractors relied on correlated variability in this mesoscale feedback loop, predicting a specific structure of low-dimensional correlations that were empirically verified in M2 recordings. Our results suggest a novel mesoscale network motif based on correlated variability supporting naturalistic animal behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3207988094,"Targeting the KRAS pathway is a promising but challenging approach for colorectal cancer therapy. Despite showing potent efficacy in BRAF-mutated melanoma, MEK inhibitors appeared to be tolerated by colorectal cancer cells due to their intrinsic compensatory signaling. Here, we performed genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening in the presence of MEK inhibitor to identify genes that are synthetically lethal with MEK inhibition in CRC models harboring KRAS mutations. Several genes were identified as potential functional drivers, which were significantly enriched in the GRB7-mediated RTK pathway. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function assays validated that GRB7 potently rendered CRC cells primary resistance to MEK inhibitors through the RTK pathway. Mass spectrum analysis of GRB7 immunoprecipitates revealed that PLK1 was the predominant interacting kinase of GRB7. Inhibition of PLK1 suppressed downstream signaling of RTK, including FAK, STAT3, AKT, and 4EBP1. The combination of PLK1 and MEK inhibitors synergistically inhibited CRC cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, we identified GRB7-PLK1 as a pivotal axis mediating RTKs, resulting in MEK inhibitor tolerance. PLK1 is therefore a promising target for synergizing MEK inhibitors in the clinical treatment of CRC patients harboring KRAS mutations."
https://openalex.org/W3210271812,"Information processing in the brain depends on the integration of synaptic input distributed throughout neuronal dendrites. Dendritic integration is a hierarchical process, proposed to be equivalent to integration by a multilayer network, potentially endowing single neurons with substantial computational power. However, whether neurons can learn to harness dendritic properties to realize this potential is unknown. Here, we develop a learning rule from dendritic cable theory and use it to investigate the processing capacity of a detailed pyramidal neuron model. We show that computations using spatial or temporal features of synaptic input patterns can be learned, and even synergistically combined, to solve a canonical nonlinear feature-binding problem. The voltage dependence of the learning rule drives coactive synapses to engage dendritic nonlinearities, whereas spike-timing dependence shapes the time course of subthreshold potentials. Dendritic input-output relationships can therefore be flexibly tuned through synaptic plasticity, allowing optimal implementation of nonlinear functions by single neurons."

Monoclonal antibody-based treatments that have become available recently have a narrow therapeutic spectrum and are ineffective against ebolaviruses other than Ebola virus (EBOV), including medically important Bundibugyo (BDBV) and Sudan (SUDV) viruses. Here, we report the development of a therapeutic cocktail comprising two broadly neutralizing human antibodies, rEBOV-515 and rEBOV-442, that recognize non-overlapping sites on the ebolavirus glycoprotein (GP). Antibodies in the cocktail exhibited synergistic neutralizing activity, resisted viral escape, and possessed differing requirements for their Fc-regions for optimal in vivo activities. The cocktail protected non-human primates from ebolavirus disease caused by EBOV, BDBV, or SUDV with high therapeutic effectiveness. High-resolution structures of the cocktail antibodies in complex with GP revealed the molecular determinants for neutralization breadth and potency. This study provides advanced preclinical data to support clinical development of this cocktail for pan-ebolavirus therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3208408585,"Normal physiology relies on the precise coordination of intracellular signaling pathways that respond to nutrient availability to balance cell growth and cell death. The canonical mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway consists of the RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade and represents one of the most well-defined axes within eukaryotic cells to promote cell proliferation, which underscores its frequent mutational activation in human cancers. Our recent studies illuminated a function for the redox-active micronutrient copper (Cu) as an intracellular mediator of signaling by connecting Cu to the amplitude of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling via a direct interaction between Cu and the kinases MEK1 and MEK2. Given the large quantities of molecules such as glutathione and metallothionein that limit cellular toxicity from free Cu ions, evolutionarily conserved Cu chaperones facilitate efficient delivery of Cu to cuproenzymes. Thus, a dedicated cellular delivery mechanism of Cu to MEK1/2 likely exists. Using surface plasmon resonance and proximity-dependent biotin ligase studies, we report here that the Cu chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS) selectively bound to and facilitated Cu transfer to MEK1. Mutants of CCS that disrupt Cu(I) acquisition and exchange or a CCS small-molecule inhibitor were used and resulted in reduced Cu-stimulated MEK1 kinase activity. Our findings indicate that the Cu chaperone CCS provides fidelity within a complex biological system to achieve appropriate installation of Cu within the MEK1 kinase active site that in turn modulates kinase activity and supports the development of novel MEK1/2 inhibitors that target the Cu structural interface or blunt dedicated Cu delivery mechanisms via CCS."
https://openalex.org/W3209296360,"Emerging worldwide in the past decade, there has been a significant increase in multidrug-resistant bacteria from serious nosocomial infections, especially carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacilli that have emerged worldwide. The objective of this study is to investigate carbapenem resistance in Gram-negative bacilli bacteria using phenotypic detection, antimicrobial resistance profiles and genotypic characterisation methods.200 Gram-negative bacilli isolates were collected from different clinical specimens. All clinical samples were exposed to isolation and identification of significant pathogens applying bacteriological examination and an automated Vitek-2 system. The isolates were subjected to susceptibility tests by the Vitek-2 automated system and those isolates that were resistant to beta-lactam drugs, including carbapenems, third-generation cephalosporines or cefoxitin, were selected for phenotyping using Carba plus disc system assay for detection of carbapenemase-producing isolates. These isolates were further confirmed by molecular detection. PCR was used for the detection carbapenem-resistant genes (OXA-48, IMP, NDM, VIM, and KPC).110 (55%) of 200 Gram-negative bacilli were identified as beta-lactam-resistant isolates. The frequency of carbapenem-resistant isolates was calculated to be 30.9% (n = 34/110). A collection totalling 65/110 (59%) isolates were identified as carbapenemase producers by phenotypic method. Moreover, among the 65 carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative isolates with a positive phenotype-based result, 30 (46%), 20 (30%) and 18 (27%) isolates were positive for OXA-48, KPC and MBL enzymes, respectively, as well as the production of 27% of AmpC with porin loss. Tigecycline was the most effective antibiotic that affected 70% of MDR isolates, but high rates of resistance were detected to other tested antimicrobials. Of interest, a high incidence of MDR, XDR and PDR profiles were observed among all carbapenemase-producing isolates. 36% (24/65) of the tested isolates were MDR to 3 to 5 antimicrobial classes. 29% (17/65) of the recovered isolates were XDR to 6 to 7 antimicrobial classes. Alarmingly, 24% (16/65) of isolates displayed PDR to all the tested 8 antimicrobial classes. Genotype assay, including 53 phenotypically confirmed carbapenemase-producing isolates of Gram-negative bacilli, found 51(96%) isolates were harbouring one or more genes. The most common carbapenemase gene was bla NDM 83% (44/53) followed by bla OXA-48 75% (40/53), bla VIM 49% (26/53) and bla IMP 43% (23/53), while the gene bla KPC was least frequent 7% (4/53). 92% (46/51) of isolates were involved in the production of more than one carbapenemase gene.This study demonstrated the emergence of carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative pathogens implicated in healthcare-related infections. Accurate identification of carbapenem-resistant bacterial pathogens is essential for patient treatment, as well as the development of appropriate contamination control measures to limit the rapid spread of pathogens. Tigecycline exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against MDR, XDR and PDR-producing strains that establish a threatening alert which indicates the complex therapy of infections caused by these pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W3209508212,"Virtual reality (VR) has proven effective in the treatment of specific phobias and trauma particularly when in-vivo exposure therapy might be costly (e.g. fear of flying, combat scenes). Similarly, VR has been associated with improvement of chronic pain and of acute pain during medical procedures. Despite its effectiveness as a healthcare tool, VR technology is not well-integrated into common practice. This qualitative study aims to explore the provider perception of the value of VR and identify barriers to VR implementation among healthcare providers.A 66-item self-report survey was created to examine application of VR to clinical practice, perceived value of this treatment, ease of learning the technology, billing considerations, and other obstacles. 128 providers (MDs and PhDs) who were located in the United States and had used VR as a therapeutic tool in the past year were identified through research papers, as well as user lists and news articles from VR application websites. Of the 128 providers contacted, 17% (22) completed our online self-report measure. Of these, 13% of respondents (N = 17) completed greater than 75% of the questionnaire and were considered completers. Provider responses were collected over a one-month period and qualitatively analyzed.The majority of providers were from an academic institution (n = 12, 70.6%), and all providers practiced in the outpatient setting. Providers most commonly reported using VR for the treatment of acute pain and/or anxiety related to medical procedures (n = 11, 64.7%), followed by specific phobia (n = 6, 35.3%) and social phobia (n = 6, 35.3%). All providers agreed VR is a valuable tool they would recommend to colleagues. The majority (n = 15, 93.8%) believed VR helped their patients progress in treatment, compared with other methods. Providers cited the ability to individualize treatment (n = 14, 87.5%) and increase patient engagement (n = 15, 93.8%) as main benefits of VR. A minority reported negative feedback from patients about content (n = 4, 25%) or about the technology in general (n = 6, 37.5%), whereas all reported some form of positive feedback. The slight majority (n = 10, 58.8%) of providers did not find transitioning to VR difficult. Of those who did, cost was the most commonly cited barrier (n = 6). Regarding reimbursement, only 17.6% (n = 3) of providers reported the ability to bill for VR sessions. Most providers (n = 15, 88.2%) received training on their VR platform which they found beneficial. Comparing the trained and untrained groups found no significant difference in VR comfort level (p = 0.5058), the value of VR in practice (p = 0.551) or whether providers would recommend VR to others (p = 0.551), though sample sizes were small.In corroboration with previous research, this study demonstrates that VR is well-received by patients and providers, allowing increased patient engagement and treatment individualization. However, associated costs, including an inability to bill for this service, can present a barrier to further implementation. These findings will guide further development of virtual reality as a standardized tool in psychiatry and pain management."

At present, the pathogenesis and effective treatment of tendinopathy are still not sufficiently elucidated. The purpose of this research is to intensely explore the genes, functional pathways, and immune infiltration characteristics of the occurrence and development of tendinopathy. The gene expression profile of GSE106292, GSE26051 and GSE167226 are downloaded from GEO (NCBI comprehensive gene expression database) and analyzed by WGCNA software bag using R software, GSE26051, GSE167226 data set is combined to screen the differential gene analysis. We subsequently performed gene enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) and ""Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes"" (KEGG), and immune cell infiltration analysis. By constructing the LASSO regression model, Support vector machine (SVM-REF) and Gaussian mixture model (GMMs) algorithms are used to screen, to identify early diagnostic genes. We have obtained a total of 171 DEGs through WGCNA analysis and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) screening. By GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, it is found that these dysregulated genes were related to mTOR, HIF-1, MAPK, NF-κB and VEGF signaling pathways. Immune infiltration analysis showed that M1 macrophages, activated mast cells and activated NK cells had infiltration significance. After analysis of THE LASSO SVM-REF and GMMs algorithms, we found that the gene MACROD1 may be a gene for early diagnosis. We identified the potential of tendon disease early diagnosis way and immune gene regulation MACROD1 key infiltration characteristics based on comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. These hub genes and functional pathways may as early biomarkers of tendon injuries and molecular therapy level target is used to guide drug and basic research."
https://openalex.org/W3208584415,"Scabies is a neglected disease stablished worldwide with a fairy well determined incidence. In high-income countries, it often causes outbreaks affecting the residents and staff of institutions and long-term facilities, usually hard to detect and control due to the difficult diagnosis and notification delay. This study aim at characterizing the affected population, geographical distribution, and evolution of scabies in Spain from 1997-2019 as well as to describe the main environments of transmission using different data sources.We carried out a nationwide retrospective study using four databases, which record data from different perspectives: hospital admissions, patients attended at primary healthcare services, outbreaks, and occupational diseases. We described the main characteristics from each database and calculated annual incidences in order to evaluate temporal and geographical patterns. We also analyzed outbreaks and occupational settings to characterize the main transmission foci and applied Joinpoint regression models to detect trend changes.The elderly was the most frequent collective among the hospital admitted patients and notified cases in outbreaks, while children and young adults were the most affected according to primary care databases. The majority of the outbreaks occurred in homes and nursing homes; however, the facilities with more cases per outbreak were military barracks, healthcare settings and nursing homes. Most occupational cases occurred also in healthcare and social services settings, being healthcare workers the most common affected professional group. We detected a decreasing trend in scabies admissions from 1997 to 2014 (annual percentage change -APC- = -11.2%) and an increasing trend from 2014 to 2017 (APC = 23.6%). Wide geographical differences were observed depending on the database explored.An increasing trend in scabies admissions was observed in Spain since 2014, probably due to cutbacks in social services and healthcare in addition to worsen of living conditions as a result of the 2008 economic crisis, among other reasons. The main transmission foci were healthcare and social settings. Measures including enhancing epidemic studies and national registries, reinforcing clinical diagnosis and early detection of cases, hygiene improvements and training of the staff and wide implementation of scabies treatment (considering mass drug administration in institutions outbreaks) should be considered to reduce the impact of scabies among most vulnerable groups in Spain."
https://openalex.org/W3210681076,"The ancient origin of the lectin pathway of the complement system can be traced back to protochordates (such as amphioxus and tunicates) by the presence of components such as ficolin, glucose-binding lectin, mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease (MASP), and C3. Evidence for a more primitive origin is offered in the present study on the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. C3 protein in C. gigas (CgC3) was found to be cleaved after stimulation with the bacteria Vibrio splendidus. In addition, we identified a novel C-type lectin (defined as CgCLec) with a complement control protein (CCP) domain, which recognized various pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and bacteria. This protein was involved in the activation of the complement system by binding CgMASPL-1 to promote cleavage of CgC3. The production of cytokines and antibacterial peptides, as well as the phagocytotic ratio of haemocytes in CgCLec-CCP-, CgMASPL-1-, or CgC3-knockdown oysters, decreased significantly after V. splendidus stimulation. Moreover, this activated CgC3 participated in perforation of bacterial envelopes and inhibiting survival of the infecting bacteria. These results collectively suggest that there existed an ancient lectin pathway in molluscs, which was activated by a complement cascade to regulate the production of immune effectors, phagocytosis, and bacterial lysis."

Uganda is among the countries with a relatively high prevalence of tuberculosis despite significant control efforts. In this study, the drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to rifampicin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) was investigated among patients diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis in Southwestern Uganda. A total of 283 sputum samples (266 from newly diagnosed and 17 from previously treated patients), collected between May 2018 and April 2019 at four different TB diagnostic centres, were assessed for RIF and INH resistance using high-resolution melt curve analysis. The overall prevalence of monoresistance to INH and RIF was 8.5% and 11% respectively, while the prevalence of MDR-TB was 6.7%. Bivariate analysis showed that patients aged 25 to 44 years were at a higher risk of developing MDR-TB (cOR 0.253). Furthermore, among the newly diagnosed patients, the prevalence of monoresistance to INH, RIF and MDR-TB was 8.6%, 10.2% and 6.4% respectively; while among the previously treated cases, these prevalence rates were 5.9%, 23.5% and 11.8%. These rates are higher than those reported previously indicating a rise in MTB drug resistance and may call for measures used to prevent a further rise in drug resistance. There is also a need to conduct frequent drug resistance surveys, to monitor and curtail the development and spread of drug-resistant TB."

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of toxigenic fungi, their metabolites, and the effect of traditional roasting and brewing on ochratoxin A (OTA) and aflatoxins (AFs) contents of naturally contaminated coffee samples. In addition, in vivo biocontrol assays were performed to explore the antagonistic activities of Bacillus simplex 350-3 (BS350-3) on the growth and mycotoxins synthesis of Aspergillus ochraceus and A. flavus. The relative density of A. niger, A. flavus, Penicillium verrucosum and A. carbonarius on green coffee bean was 60.82%, 7.21%, 3.09% and 1.03%, respectively. OTA contents were lowest in green coffee beans (2.15 μg/kg), followed by roasted (2.76 μg/kg) and soluble coffee (8.95 μg/kg). Likewise, AFs levels were highest in soluble coffee (90.58 μg/kg) followed by roasted (33.61 μg/kg) and green coffee (9.07 μg/kg). Roasting naturally contaminated coffee beans at three traditional methods; low, medium and high, followed by brewing resulted in reduction of 58.74% (3.50 μg/kg), 60.88% (3.72 μg/kg) and 64.70% (4.11 μg/kg) in OTA and 40.18% (34.65 μg/kg), 47.86% (41.17 μg/kg) and 62.38% (53.73 μg/kg) AFs contents, respectively. Significant inhibitions of AFs and OTA synthesis by A. flavus and A. carbonarius, respectively, on infected coffee beans were observed in presence of Bacillus simplex BS350-3 volatiles. Gas chromatography mass spectrochemistry (GC-MS/MS) analysis of head-space BS350-3 volatiles showed quinoline, benzenemethanamine and 1-Octadecene as bioactive antifungal molecules. These findings suggest that marketed coffee samples are generally contaminated with OTA and AFs, with a significant level of roasted and soluble coffee contaminated above EU permissible limits for OTA. Further, along with coffee roasting and brewing; microbial volatiles can be optimized to minimize the dietary exposure to mycotoxins."
https://openalex.org/W3208801468,"During signal transduction, the G protein, Gαq, binds and activates phospholipase C-β isozymes. Several diseases have been shown to manifest upon constitutively activating mutation of Gαq, such as uveal melanoma. Therefore, methods are needed to directly inhibit Gαq. Previously, we demonstrated that a peptide derived from a helix-turn-helix (HTH) region of PLC-β3 (residues 852-878) binds Gαq with low micromolar affinity and inhibits Gαq by competing with full-length PLC-β isozymes for binding. Since the HTH peptide is unstructured in the absence of Gαq, we hypothesized that embedding the HTH in a folded protein might stabilize the binding-competent conformation and further improve the potency of inhibition. Using the molecular modeling software Rosetta, we searched the Protein Data Bank for proteins with similar HTH structures near their surface. The candidate proteins were computationally docked against Gαq, and their surfaces were redesigned to stabilize this interaction. We then used yeast surface display to affinity mature the designs. The most potent design bound Gαq/i with high affinity in vitro (KD = 18 nM) and inhibited activation of PLC-β isozymes in HEK293 cells. We anticipate that our genetically encoded inhibitor will help interrogate the role of Gαq in healthy and disease model systems. Our work demonstrates that grafting interaction motifs into folded proteins is a powerful approach for generating inhibitors of protein-protein interactions."

https://openalex.org/W3209671510,"In addition to its classical role in apoptosis, accumulating evidence suggests that caspase-2 has non-apoptotic functions, including regulation of cell division. Loss of caspase-2 is known to increase proliferation rates but how caspase-2 is regulating this process is currently unclear. We show that caspase-2 is activated in dividing cells in G1-phase of the cell cycle. In the absence of caspase-2, cells exhibit numerous S-phase defects including delayed exit from S-phase, defects in repair of chromosomal aberrations during S-phase, and increased DNA damage following S-phase arrest. In addition, caspase-2-deficient cells have a higher frequency of stalled replication forks, decreased DNA fiber length, and impeded progression of DNA replication tracts. This indicates that caspase-2 protects from replication stress and promotes replication fork protection to maintain genomic stability. These functions are independent of the pro-apoptotic function of caspase-2 because blocking caspase-2-induced cell death had no effect on cell division, DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest, or DNA damage. Thus, our data supports a model where caspase-2 regulates cell cycle and DNA repair events to protect from the accumulation of DNA damage independently of its pro-apoptotic function."
https://openalex.org/W4226247784,"The colonic epithelial barrier is vital to preserve gut and host health by maintaining the immune homeostasis between host and microbes. The mechanisms underlying beneficial or harmful host-microbe interactions are poorly understood and impossible to study in vivo given the limited accessibility and ethical constraints. Moreover, existing in vitro models lack the required cellular complexity for the routine, yet profound, analysis of the intricate interplay between different types of host and microbial cells. We developed and characterized a broadly applicable, easy-to-handle in vitro triple coculture model that combines chemically-induced macrophage-like, goblet and epithelial cells covered by a mucus layer, which can be coincubated with complex human-derived gut microbiota samples for 16 h. Comparison with a standard epithelial monolayer model revealed that triple cocultures produce thicker mucus layers, morphologically organize in a network and upon exposure to human-derived gut microbiota samples, respond via pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Both model systems, however, were not suffering from cytotoxic stress or different microbial loads, indicating that the obtained endpoints were caused by the imposed conditions. Addition of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG to assess its immunomodulating capacity in the triple coculture slightly suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine responses, based on transcriptomic microarray analyses. TNF conditioning of the models prior to microbial exposure did not cause shifts in cytokines, suggesting a strong epithelial barrier in which TNF did not reach the basolateral side. To conclude, the triple coculture model is tolerable towards manipulations and allows to address mechanistic host-microbe research questions in a stable in vitro environment."
https://openalex.org/W3210400962,"Urban expansion is a major threat to natural ecosystems but also creates novel opportunities that adaptable species can exploit. The grey-headed flying-fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) is a threatened, highly mobile species of bat that is increasingly found in human-dominated landscapes, leading to many management and conservation challenges. Flying-fox urbanisation is thought to be a result of diminishing natural foraging habitat or increasing urban food resources, or both. However, little is known about landscape utilisation of flying-foxes in human-modified areas, and how this may differ in natural areas. Here we examine positional data from 98 satellite-tracked P. poliocephalus for up to 5 years in urban and non-urban environments, in relation to vegetation data and published indices of foraging habitat quality. Our findings indicate that human-modified foraging landscapes sustain a large proportion of the P. poliocephalus population year-round. When individuals roosted in non-urban and minor-urban areas, they relied primarily on wet and dry sclerophyll forest, forested wetlands, and rainforest for foraging, and preferentially visited foraging habitat designated as high-quality. However, our results highlight the importance of human-modified foraging habitats throughout the species' range, and particularly for individuals that roosted in major-urban environments. The exact plant species that exist in human-modified habitats are largely undocumented; however, where this information was available, foraging by P. poliocephalus was associated with different dominant plant species depending on whether individuals roosted in 'urban' or 'non-urban' areas. Overall, our results demonstrate clear differences in urban- and non-urban landscape utilisation by foraging P. poliocephalus. However, further research is needed to understand the exact foraging resources used, particularly in human-modified habitats, and hence what attracts flying-foxes to urban areas. Such information could be used to modify the urban foraging landscape, to assist long-term habitat management programs aimed at minimising human-wildlife conflict and maximising resource availability within and outside of urban environments."
https://openalex.org/W3210092039,"The deadliest complication of infection by Plasmodium parasites, cerebral malaria, accounts for the majority of malarial fatalities. Although our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the pathology remains incomplete, recent studies support the contribution of systemic and neuroinflammation as the cause of cerebral edema and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. All Plasmodium species encode an orthologue of the innate cytokine, Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF), which functions in mammalian biology to regulate innate responses. Plasmodium MIF (PMIF) similarly signals through the host MIF receptor CD74, leading to an enhanced inflammatory response. We investigated the PMIF-CD74 interaction in the onset of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) and liver stage Plasmodium development by using a combination of CD74 deficient (Cd74-/- ) hosts and PMIF deficient parasites. Cd74-/- mice were found to be protected from ECM and the protection was associated with the inability of brain microvessels to present parasite antigen to sequestered and pathogenic Plasmodium-specific CD8+ T cells. Infection of WT hosts with PMIF-deficient sporozoites or infection of Cd74-/- hosts with WT sporozoites impacted the survival of infected hepatocytes and subsequently reduced blood-stage associated inflammation, contributing to protection from ECM. We recapitulated these finding with a novel pharmacologic PMIF-selective antagonist that reduced PMIF/CD74 signaling and fully protected mice from ECM. These findings reveal a conserved mechanism for Plasmodium usurpation of host CD74 signaling and suggest a tractable approach for new pharmacologic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W3210239715,"Historically, the database search algorithms have been the de facto standard for inferring peptides from mass spectrometry (MS) data. Database search algorithms deduce peptides by transforming theoretical peptides into theoretical spectra and matching them to the experimental spectra. Heuristic similarity-scoring functions are used to match an experimental spectrum to a theoretical spectrum. However, the heuristic nature of the scoring functions and the simple transformation of the peptides into theoretical spectra, along with noisy mass spectra for the less abundant peptides, can introduce a cascade of inaccuracies. In this paper, we design and implement a Deep Cross-Modal Similarity Network called SpeCollate, which overcomes these inaccuracies by learning the similarity function between experimental spectra and peptides directly from the labeled MS data. SpeCollate transforms spectra and peptides into a shared Euclidean subspace by learning fixed size embeddings for both. Our proposed deep-learning network trains on sextuplets of positive and negative examples coupled with our custom-designed SNAP-loss function. Online hardest negative mining is used to select the appropriate negative examples for optimal training performance. We use 4.8 million sextuplets obtained from the NIST and MassIVE peptide libraries to train the network and demonstrate that for closed search, SpeCollate is able to perform better than Crux and MSFragger in terms of the number of peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) and unique peptides identified under 1% FDR for real-world data. SpeCollate also identifies a large number of peptides not reported by either Crux or MSFragger. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed SpeCollate is the first deep-learning network that can determine the cross-modal similarity between peptides and mass-spectra for MS-based proteomics. We believe SpeCollate is significant progress towards developing machine-learning solutions for MS-based omics data analysis. SpeCollate is available at https://deepspecs.github.io/."
https://openalex.org/W3210339578,"Background Measurement of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of people with chronic illnesses has become extremely important as the mortality rates associated with such illnesses have decreased and survival rates have increased. Thereby, such measurements not only provide insights into physical, mental and social dimensions of patient’s health, but also allow monitoring of the results of interventions, complementing the traditional methods based on morbidity and mortality. Objective The present study was conducted to describe the HRQOL of patients suffering from Rheumatic Fever (RF) and Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD), and to identify socio-demographic and clinical factors as predictors of HRQOL. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the HRQOL among 702 RF and RHD patients using EuroQol 5-dimensions 5-levels instrument (EQ-5D-5L), EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale and Time Trade off method. Mean EQ-5D-5L quality of life scores were calculated using EQ5D index value calculator across different stages of RF and RHD. Proportions of patients reporting problems in different attributes of EQ-5D-5L were calculated. The impact of socio-economic determinants on HRQOL was assessed. Results The mean EQ-5D-5L utility scores among RF, RHD and RHD with Congestive heart failure patients (CHF) were estimated as 0.952 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.929–0.975], 0.820 [95% CI: 0.799–0.842] and 0.800 [95% CI: 0.772–0.829] respectively. The most frequently reported problem among RF/RHD patients was pain/discomfort (33.8%) followed by difficulty in performing usual activities (23.9%) patients, mobility (22.7%) and anxiety/depression (22%). Patients with an annual income of less than 50,000 Indian National Rupees (INR) reported the highest EQ-5D-5L score of 0.872, followed by those in the income group of more than INR 200,000 (0.835), INR 50,000–100,000 (0.832) and INR 100,000–200,000 (0.828). Better HRQOL was reported by RHD patients (including RHD with CHF) who underwent balloon valvotomy (0.806) as compared to valve replacement surgery (0.645). Conclusion RF and RHD significantly impact the HRQOL of patients. Interventions aiming to improve HRQOL of RF/RHD patients should focus upon ameliorating pain and implementation of secondary prevention strategies for reducing the progression from ARF to RHD and prevention of RHD-related complications."
https://openalex.org/W3209158293,"Tunga penetrans, also known as sand flea, causes Tungiasis in humans and animals. Despite its notoriety as an entomological problem, however, the ectoparasite receives little consideration from public health professionals. It is against this background that this article aims to assess the prevalence of and factors associated with Tunga penetrans infestation among 5-14-year-olds in rural Western Ethiopia.From November to December 2020, 487 children aged 5 to 14 were selected from four primary schools in a cross-sectional study using systematic random sampling. Clinical exams, Interviews with parents/guardians and observations of the housing and classroom environments were used to collect data. Descriptive statistics and multivariable regression were used to characterize the data and identify factors associated with Tunga penetrans infestation.Tunga penetrans infestation (Tungiasis) was diagnosed in 138 of the 487 children examined, placing the prevalence at 28.3% (95% CI: 24.2%, 32.2%). Mud plastered walls [AOR: 5.83, % CI (3.44-9.88)], having cats in the house [AOR: 5.91, 95% CI (3.51-10.11)], not having separated sleeping quarters for animals [AOR: 4.60, 95% CI (2.69-7.86)], using self-supplied water [AOR: 6.30, 95% CI (3.33-11.93)], walking>30 minutes to school [AOR: 2.37, 95% CI (1.48-3.80)] were associated with Tungiasis.In one way or another, several of the identified factors were linked to poverty. Improved house wall materials, fumigation of mud-plastered houses, dusting or spraying insecticides on domestic animals (such as cats), improved access to water, community education about keeping animals separated from living spaces, and hygiene promotion are all needed, with a focus on locally available, low-cost technologies that the poorest families can afford."
https://openalex.org/W3209844165,"Serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) and IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) levels can be used to monitor the safety of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) therapy. In this study, we evaluated the changes in serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels during rhGH therapy as a marker of height outcome in prepubertal children. Totally, 705 prepubertal children with short stature were enrolled from the LG Growth Study Database. Data for three groups of subjects were obtained as follows: Idiopathic GH deficiency (IGHD; n = 486); idiopathic short stature (n = 66); small for gestational age (n = 153). Serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels at the baseline and after the 1 st and 2 nd year of rhGH therapy, as well as the Δheight standard deviation score (SDS), were obtained. Δheight SDS after the 1 st and 2 nd year of rhGH therapy had notably increased compared to that at the baseline for all three groups. IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels in all three groups were significantly increased compared to those at the baseline (p &lt;0.001). Δheight SDS was positively correlated with ΔIGF-1 SDS after the 1 st year of therapy, Δ IGFBP-3 SDS after the 2 nd year of therapy in the IGHD group, and ΔIGF-I SDS and ΔIGFBP-3 SDS after the 2 nd year of therapy (p &lt; 0.05), regardless of whether the height at the baseline was a covariate. The increase in IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels during rhGH therapy was related to the growth response in children with IGHD. Therefore, it may be valuable to measure the change in serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels, especially the latter, during rhGH treatment to predict the growth response upon long-term treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3210176076,"Exposure notification apps have been developed to assist in notifying individuals of recent exposures to SARS-CoV-2. However, in several countries, such apps have had limited uptake. We assessed whether strategies to increase downloads of exposure notification apps should emphasize improving the accuracy of the apps in recording contacts and exposures, strengthening privacy protections and/or offering financial incentives to potential users. In a discrete choice experiment with potential app users in the US, financial incentives were more than twice as important in decision-making about app downloads, than privacy protections, and app accuracy. The probability that a potential user would download an exposure notification app increased by 40% when offered a $100 reward to download (relative to a reference scenario in which the app is free). Financial incentives might help exposure notification apps reach uptake levels that improve the effectiveness of contact tracing programs and ultimately enhance efforts to control SARS-CoV-2. Rapid, pragmatic trials of financial incentives for app downloads in real-life settings are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3163443644,"Studies examining age effects in autobiographical memory have produced inconsistent results. This study examined whether a set of typical autobiographical memory measures produced equivalent results in a single participant sample. Five memory tests (everyday memory, autobiographical memory from the past year, autobiographical memory from age 11-17, word-cued autobiographical memory, and word-list recall) were administered in a single sample of young and older adults. There was significant variance in the tests' sensitivity to age: word-cued autobiographical memory produced the largest deficit in older adults, similar in magnitude to word-list recall. In contrast, older adults performed comparatively well on the other measures. The pattern of findings was broadly consistent with the results of previous investigations, suggesting that (1) the results of the different AM tasks are reliable, and (2) variable age effects in the autobiographical memory literature are at least partly due to the use of different tasks, which cannot be considered interchangeable measures of autobiographical memory ability. The results are also consistent with recent work dissociating measures of specificity and detail in autobiographical memory, and suggest that specificity is particularly sensitive to ageing. In contrast, detail is less sensitive to ageing, but is influenced by retention interval and event type. The extent to which retention interval and event type interact with age remains unclear; further research using specially designed autobiographical memory tasks could resolve this issue."
https://openalex.org/W3209997056,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has critical roles in epithelial cell physiology. Over-expression and over-activation of EGFR have been implicated in diverse cancers, including triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), prompting anti-EGFR therapies. Therefore, developing potent therapies and addressing the inevitable drug resistance mechanisms necessitates deciphering of EGFR related networks. Here, we describe Sorting Nexin 3 (SNX3), a member of the recycling retromer complex, as a critical player in the epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulated EGFR network in TNBCs. We show that SNX3 is an immediate and sustained target of EGF stimulation initially at the protein level and later at the transcriptional level, causing increased SNX3 abundance. Using a proximity labeling approach, we observed increased interaction of SNX3 and EGFR upon EGF stimulation. We also detected colocalization of SNX3 with early endosomes and endocytosed EGF. Moreover, we show that EGFR protein levels are sensitive to SNX3 loss. Transient RNAi models of SNX3 downregulation have a temporary reduction in EGFR levels. In contrast, long-term silencing forces cells to recover and overexpress EGFR mRNA and protein, resulting in increased proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion in TNBC cells, and increased tumor growth and metastasis in syngeneic models. Consistent with these results, low SNX3 and high EGFR mRNA levels correlate with poor relapse-free survival in breast cancer patients. Overall, our results suggest that SNX3 is a critical player in the EGFR network in TNBCs with implications for other cancers dependent on EGFR activity."
https://openalex.org/W3210308077,"Recent animal studies, as well as quantitative sodium MRI observations on humans demonstrated that remarkable amounts of sodium can be stored in the skin. It is also known that excess sodium in the tissues leads to inflammation in various organs, but its role in dermal pathophysiology has not been elucidated. Therefore, our aim was to study the effect of dietary salt loading on inflammatory process and related extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in the skin. To investigate the effect of high salt consumption on inflammation and ECM production in the skin mice were kept on normal (NSD) or high salt (HSD) diet and then dermatitis was induced with imiquimod (IMQ) treatment. The effect of high salt concentration on dermal fibroblasts (DF) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was also investigated in vitro. The HSD resulted in increased sodium content in the skin of mice. Inflammatory cytokine Il17 expression was elevated in the skin of HSD mice. Expression of anti-inflammatory Il10 and Il13 decreased in the skin of HSD or HSD IMQ mice. The fibroblast marker Acta2 and ECM component Fn and Col1a1 decreased in HSD IMQ mice. Expression of ECM remodeling related Pdgfb and activation phosphorylated (p)-SMAD2/3 was lower in HSD IMQ mice. In PBMCs, production of IL10, IL13 and PDGFB was reduced due to high salt loading. In cultured DFs high salt concentration resulted in decreased cell motility and ECM production, as well. Our results demonstrate that high dietary salt intake is associated with increased dermal pro-inflammatory status. Interestingly, although inflammation induces the synthesis of ECM in most organs, the expression of ECM decreased in the inflamed skin of mice on high salt diet. Our data suggest that salt intake may alter the process of skin remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W3210469489,"Background Migrants are not routinely screened for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the Netherlands. We estimated the prevalence and determined factors associated with HBV, HCV and/or HIV infections among undocumented migrants and uninsured legal residents. Methods In this cross-sectional study, undocumented migrants and uninsured legal residents were recruited at a non governmental organization (NGO), healthcare facility in the Netherlands and were invited to be tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti-hepatitis B core antibodies (anti-HBcAb), HCV-RNA, and anti-HIV antibodies or HIV antigen at a local laboratory. Results Of the 1376 patients invited, 784 (57%) participated. Participants originated from Africa (35%), Asia (30%) and North/South America (30%). 451/784 (58%) participants went to the laboratory for testing. Of participants 30% were HBV exposed (anti-HBcAb-positive), with 27% (n = 119/438, 95% CI 23.1% to 31.6%) having resolved HBV infection (HBsAg-negative) and 2.5% (n = 11/438, 95%CI 1.3% to 4.5%, 64% new infection) having chronic HBV infection (HBsAg-positive). Compared to HBV non-exposed, HBV exposed individuals were older ( p = 0.034) and more often originated from Africa ( p &lt;0.001). Prevalence of chronic HCV infection (HCV-RNA-positive) was 0.7% (n = 3/435, 95%CI 0.1% to 2.0%, all new infections) and HIV infection 1.1% (n = 5/439, 95%CI 0.04% to 2.6%, 40% new infection). Conclusion Prevalence of chronic HBV, chronic HCV and HIV infections in our study population is higher compared to the Dutch population, thus emphasizing the importance of case finding for these infections through primary care and public health in this specific group of migrants. Screening uptake could be improved by on-site testing."
https://openalex.org/W3210993396,"Hepatocytes differ from columnar epithelial cells by their multipolar organization, which follows the initial formation of central lumen-sharing clusters of polarized cells as observed during liver development and regeneration. The molecular mechanism for hepatocyte polarity establishment, however, has been comparatively less studied than those for other epithelial cell types. Here, we show that the tight junction protein Par3 organizes hepatocyte polarization via cooperating with the small GTPase Cdc42 to target atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) to a cortical site near the center of cell-cell contacts. In 3D Matrigel culture of human hepatocytic HepG2 cells, which mimics a process of liver development and regeneration, depletion of Par3, Cdc42, or aPKC results in an impaired establishment of apicobasolateral polarity and a loss of subsequent apical lumen formation. The aPKC activity is also required for bile canalicular (apical) elongation in mouse primary hepatocytes. The lateral membrane-associated proteins Lgl1 and Lgl2, major substrates of aPKC, seem to be dispensable for hepatocyte polarity establishment because Lgl-depleted HepG2 cells are able to form a single apical lumen in 3D culture. On the other hand, Lgl depletion leads to lateral invasion of aPKC, and overexpression of Lgl1 or Lgl2 prevents apical lumen formation, indicating that they maintain proper lateral integrity. Thus, hepatocyte polarity establishment and apical lumen formation are organized by Par3, Cdc42, and aPKC; Par3 cooperates with Cdc42 to recruit aPKC, which plays a crucial role in apical membrane development and regulation of the lateral maintainer Lgl."
https://openalex.org/W3211227670,"The purpose of this study was to characterize the nasopharyngeal microbiota of infants with possible and confirmed pertussis compared to healthy controls.This prospective study included all infants <1 year with microbiologically confirmed diagnosis of pertussis attended at a University Hospital over a 12-month period. For each confirmed case, up to 2 consecutive patients within the same age range and meeting the clinical case definition of pertussis but testing PCR-negative were included as possible cases. A third group of asymptomatic infants (healthy controls) were also included. Nasopharyngeal microbiota was characterized by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Common respiratory DNA/RNA viral co-infection was tested by multiplex PCR.Twelve confirmed cases, 21 possible cases and 9 healthy controls were included. Confirmed whooping cough was primarily driven by detection of Bordetella with no other major changes on nasopharyngeal microbiota. Possible cases had limited abundance or absence of Bordetella and a distinctive microbiota with lower bacterial richness and diversity and higher rates of viral co-infection than both confirmed cases and healthy controls. Bordetella reads determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing were found in all 12 confirmed cases (100%), 3 out of the 21 possible cases (14.3%) but in any healthy control.This study supports the usefulness of 16S rRNA gene sequencing for improved sensitivity on pertussis diagnosis compared to real-time PCR and to understand other microbial changes occurring in the nasopharynx in children <1 year old with suspected whooping cough compared to healthy controls."
https://openalex.org/W3208353436,"The cellular specificity, potency, and modular nature of bacterial protein toxins enable their application for targeted cytosolic delivery of therapeutic cargo. Efficient endosomal escape is a critical step in the design of bacterial toxin-inspired drug delivery (BTIDD) vehicles to avoid lysosomal degradation and promote optimal cargo delivery. The cytotoxic necrotizing factor (CNF) family of modular toxins represents a useful model for investigating cargo-delivery mechanisms due to the availability of many homologs with high sequence identity, their flexibility in swapping domains, and their differential activity profiles. Previously, we found that CNFy is more sensitive to endosomal acidification inhibitors than CNF1 and CNF2. Here, we report that CNF3 is even less sensitive than CNF1/2. We identified two amino acid residues within the putative translocation domain (E374 and E412 in CNFy, Q373 and S411 in CNF3) that differentiate between these two toxins. Swapping these corresponding residues in each toxin changed the sensitivity to endosomal acidification and efficiency of cargo-delivery to be more similar to the other toxin. Results suggested that trafficking to the more acidic late endosome is required for cargo delivery by CNFy but not CNF3. This model was supported by results from toxin treatment of cells in the presence of NH4Cl, which blocks endosomal acidification, and of small-molecule inhibitors EGA, which blocks trafficking to late endosomes, and ABMA, which blocks endosomal escape and trafficking to the lysosomal degradative pathway.

Modular bacterial toxins deliver their catalytic cargo into the cytosol of specific target cells.

CNF1 and CNFy reportedly have an additional binding region in the C-terminus: CNF1 residues 709 to 730 bind to Lu/BCAM adhesion molecule (20Piteau M. Papatheodorou P. Schwan C. Schlosser A.

Biol. 2001; 8: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A key step in the cellular intoxication process of CNF toxins involves a pH-dependent membrane insertion that occurs in an acidic endosome (26Contamin S. Galmiche A. Doye A. Flatau G. Benmerah A.

Based on comparative sequence analysis that predicted a similar organization in the translocation region of CNF1 to the so-called “dagger” membrane-insertion motif (helices TH8–TH9) found in the T domain of diphtheria toxin (DT) (27Choe S.

Physiol. 2000; 115: 421-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), a model for the pH-dependent insertion step of the cargo-delivery process was previously proposed involving a putative helix-loop-helix (HLH) region (residues 350–412 in CNF1) (24Pei S.

Microbiol. 2001; 41: 1237-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This putative HLH of CNF1 contains four highly conserved acidic residues (D373, D379, E382, E383) in the postulated loop region that were proposed to become protonated in the acidic environment of the late endosome, thereby allowing insertion as a “dagger” into the membrane. Once on the cytosolic side of the membrane, the putative HLH would again become deprotonated, locking the HLH in place and initiating the membrane translocation process and cytosolic delivery of the cargo. However, although these four acidic residues were confirmed to be important for cargo delivery of CNF1 (24Pei S. Doye A. Boquet P. Mutation of specific acidic residues of the CNF1 T domain into lysine alters cell membrane translocation of the toxin.Mol.

Other studies have revealed that there are differences among the CNF toxins with regard to efficiency (14Haywood E.E. Ho M.

CNF1, CNF2, and CNFy toxins have differential dose-dependent responses to inhibitors of endosomal acidification (29Repella T.L. Ho M.

These findings suggest that there may be other protein determinants besides the four conserved acidic residues that dictate pH sensitivity and influence CNF toxin cargo delivery efficiency. In addition to NH4Cl and bafilomycin A1, two other small-molecule inhibitors of cellular trafficking pathways, 4-bromo-benzaldehyde N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl) semi-carbazone (EGA) and 1-adamantyl (5-bromo-2-methoxybenzyl) amine (ABMA), have been used to investigate intoxication mechanisms of modular protein toxins that traffic through acidified endosomes to deliver their cargo into the cytosol. EGA blocks trafficking from the early endosome to the late endosome (30Azarnia Tehran D. Zanetti G. Leka O. Lista F. Fillo S. Binz T. Shone C.C. Rossetto O. Montecucco C. Paradisi C. Mattarei A.

In contrast, ABMA reportedly blocks intoxication independent of endosomal acidification and at a stage after acidification (33Wu Y. Pons V. Goudet A. Panigai L. Fischer A. Herweg J.A. Kali S. Davey R.A. Laporte J. Bouclier C. Yousfi R. Aubenque C. Merer G. Gobbo E. Lopez R. et al.ABMA, a small molecule that inhibits intracellular toxins and pathogens by interfering with late endosomal compartments.Sci.

Regulation of endo-lysosomal pathway and autophagic flux by broad-spectrum antipathogen inhibitor ABMA.FEBS J. 2020; 287: 3184-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Thus, through use of NH4Cl, EGA, and ABMA, it may be possible to identify key points along the endosomal pathway that may differentiate among the CNF toxins: acidification, trafficking from the early endosome to the late endosome, trafficking from the late endosome to the lysosome, and/or escape of the cargo from the endosome. Here, we compared CNF1, CNF2, CNF3, and CNFy for their sensitivity to inhibitors of endosomal acidification and trafficking using cell-based SRE-luciferase assays, performed as previously described (14Haywood E.E. Ho M. Wilson B.A. Modular domain swapping among the bacterial cytotoxic necrotizing factor (CNF) family for efficient cargo delivery into mammalian cells.J. Biol.

Wilson B.A. Determinants of pH-dependent modulation of translocation in dermonecrotic G-protein-deamidating toxins.Toxins (Basel). 2013; 5: 1167-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We found that among the CNF toxins, CNF3 was the most tolerant to inhibition of endosomal acidification, while CNFy was the most sensitive. To identify protein determinants that respond to changes in endosomal pH and to differentiate among the toxins, we generated and characterized a series of chimeric toxins between CNF3 and CNFy and identified the putative HLH region of the translocation domain as the region responsible for discriminating their pH sensitivities. Site-specific mutational analysis identified two acidic residues within this region responsible for mediating the differential sensitivities to NH4Cl. CNF3 and CNFy were also investigated for their differential sensitivity to EGA or ABMA, enabling discrimination of the exit points taken by these toxins in the intoxication pathway. It has been established previously that agents that raise endosomal pH such as NH4Cl antagonize the entry of CNF toxin cargos into the cytosol (26Contamin S. Galmiche A. Doye A. Flatau G. Benmerah A. Boquet P. The p21 Rho-activating toxin cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 is endocytosed by a clathrin-independent mechanism and enters the cytosol by an acidic-dependent membrane translocation step.Mol.

Wilson B.A. Determinants of pH-dependent modulation of translocation in dermonecrotic G-protein-deamidating toxins.Toxins (Basel). 2013; 5: 1167-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). NH4Cl chemically counteracts the acidification of the endosome, preventing the low pH necessary for translocation of toxin cargos. Previous studies showed that CNF1, CNF2, and CNFy had differential sensitivities to NH4Cl (29Repella T.L. Ho M. Wilson B.A. Determinants of pH-dependent modulation of translocation in dermonecrotic G-protein-deamidating toxins.Toxins (Basel). 2013; 5: 1167-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), while CNF3 sensitivity to NH4Cl was not tested previously. We first compared the activities of wild-type CNF1, CNF2, CNF3, and CNFy toxins in a cell-based SRE-luciferase assay in response to NH4Cl. As shown in Figure 1, pretreatment of HEK293T cells with NH4Cl blocked the intracellular activity of all four toxins in a dose-dependent manner. In addition to exhibiting differential cargo delivery efficiencies, as previously described (14Haywood E.E. Ho M. Wilson B.A. Modular domain swapping among the bacterial cytotoxic necrotizing factor (CNF) family for efficient cargo delivery into mammalian cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 3860-3870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), all four of the CNF toxins displayed differential sensitivities to inhibition of endosomal acidification at a uniform toxin dose of 100 ng/ml (Fig. 1A). Consistent with previously described studies for CNF1, CNF2 and CNFy (29Repella T.L. Ho M. Wilson B.A. Determinants of pH-dependent modulation of translocation in dermonecrotic G-protein-deamidating toxins.Toxins (Basel). 2013; 5: 1167-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), CNFy was the most sensitive to NH4Cl, CNF2 had intermediate sensitivity, and CNF1 and CNF3 were the most resistant. As was noted previously (14Haywood E.E. Ho M. Wilson B.A. Modular domain swapping among the bacterial cytotoxic necrotizing factor (CNF) family for efficient cargo delivery into mammalian cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 3860-3870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), it is important to minimize the effects of differences in substrate specificities and receptor-mediated uptake when comparing CNF toxins with each other. Thus, the NH4Cl-sensitivity assay was also performed at toxin concentrations equivalent to their respective EC50 values, where the limiting step for the observed toxin activity equates to their efficiency of cargo delivery, such that differences in receptor-binding efficiencies were minimized (Fig. 1B). In this case, CNFy remained the most sensitive to NH4Cl treatment, requiring only 5 mM NH4Cl to block all CNFy-mediated reporter activation, whereas CNF3 remained the least sensitive. However, when tested at their respective EC50 values, CNF1 and CNF2 displayed similar intermediate sensitivities (Fig. 1B). This finding is consistent with the fact that these two toxins have the greatest sequence homology and are identical regarding charged residues in the previously identified HLH insertion region. Overall, these results suggested that CNF3 and CNFy represent the CNF toxins with the most and least sensitivity to endosomal acidification, respectively, and thus we asked whether we could identify specific protein determinants that drive this observed difference in sensitivity between them. To identify the determinants that discriminate CNF toxin sensitivity to inhibition of endosomal acidification, we applied a binary search approach to define the region of interest (i.e., the region that mediates the differential responses) and then selected new joining sites within that region to further refine the search. We generated a series of chimeric proteins with the N-terminal delivery domain of the least sensitive toxin CNF3 and the cargo domain of the most sensitive toxin CNFy (CNF3y) (Fig. 2A) and compared their sensitivities to NH4Cl inhibition in cell-based activity reporter assays, as described above. Accordingly, the chimera CNF3y-223 was joined downstream of the putative N-terminal receptor-binding domain (residues 23–134) (18McNichol B.A. Rasmussen S.B. Carvalho H.M. Meysick K.C. O'Brien A.D.

Microbiol. 1999; 33: 108-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), while CNF3y-519 was joined upstream of the suspected cleavage site (residues 532–544) that defines the putative cargo and delivery vehicle domains (22Knust Z. Blumenthal B. Aktories K. Schmidt G. Cleavage of Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 is required for full biologic activity.Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 1835-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 2B, CNF3y-223 was completely inhibited by 5 mM NH4Cl, matching the response observed for CNFy, while the inhibitor profile of CNF3y-519 resembled that of CNF3. These results confirmed that the region differentially sensing pH is located within the putative translocation domain (residues 223–519). To minimize structural perturbations, additional joining sites at highly conserved positions 317 and 428 within the newly defined pH-sensing region were next explored, based on amino acid sequence alignment, secondary structure predictions, and regional pI calculations (data not shown). The resulting chimeric toxins CNF3y-317 and CNF3y-428, respectively, were generated and characterized using the SRE-luciferase assay. As shown in Figure 2C, the inhibitor profiles showed that CNF3y-317 is as sensitive to NH4Cl as CNFy, while CNF3y-428 is as tolerant as CNF3, thereby narrowing the pH-sensing region to positions 317 to 428, which includes the putative HLH region and the previously identified acidic residues in CNF1 (D373, D379, E382, and E383) that are important for translocation (24Pei S. Doye A. Boquet P. Mutation of specific acidic residues of the CNF1 T domain into lysine alters cell membrane translocation of the toxin.Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 1237-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and are conserved for all known CNF toxins. To further identify the residues within the putative HLH region that contribute to the differences between CNF3 and CNFy in sensing pH changes, three new chimeric toxins were constructed: CNF3y-349, CNF3y-375, and CNF3y-412. The resulting inhibitor profiles showed that CNF3y-349 like CNFy is more sensitive to NH4Cl, while CNF3y-412 like CNF3 is more tolerant. Interestingly, the chimera CNF3y-375 is intermediate in sensitivity to NH4Cl, suggesting that one or more residues within each of the regions flanking the joining site at position 375 influence the response of the chimeric toxin to endosomal acidification. Moreover, chimera CNF3y-412 has a lower EC50 value of 0.056 nM, compared with CNF3y-349 and CNF3y-375, each with EC50 values of 0.28 nM and 0.20 nM, respectively (Table 1), further supporting the importance of this region in determining the efficiency of cargo delivery.Table 1EC50 values of wild-type and mutant CNF toxinsaThe EC50 values were calculated from dose–response"

However, between 1996 and 2014, surveillance on public health was decentralized and only some autonomous regions monitored the disease. The aim of this study is to estimate the incidence of leishmaniasis and to evaluate the extent of underreporting in Spain. A capture-recapture (CRC) study was conducted to calculate the incidence of human leishmaniasis using reports from the National Surveillance Network (RENAVE) and the Hospital Discharge Records of the National Health System (CMBD) for 2016 and 2017. During the study period, 802 cases were reported to RENAVE and there were 1,149 incident hospitalizations related to leishmaniasis. The estimated incidence rates through the CRC study were 0.79 per 100,000 inhabitants for visceral leishmaniasis (VL), 0.88 (cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL)) and 0.12 (mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL)) in 2016 and 0.86 (VL), 1.04 (CL) and 0.12 (MCL) in 2017. An underreporting of 14.7-20.2% for VL and 50.4-55.1% for CL was found. The CRC method has helped us to assess the sensitivity and representativeness of leishmaniasis surveillance in Spain, being a useful tool to assess whether the generalization of leishmaniasis surveillance throughout the Spanish territory achieves a reduction in underreporting."
https://openalex.org/W3209794294,"Within the superfamily of small GTPases, Ras appears to be the master regulator of such processes as cell cycle progression, cell division, and apoptosis. Several oncogenic Ras mutations at amino acid positions 12, 13, and 61 have been identified that lose their ability to hydrolyze GTP, giving rise to constitutive signaling and eventually development of cancer. While disruption of the Ras/effector interface is an attractive strategy for drug design to prevent this constitutive activity, inhibition of this interaction using small molecules is impractical due to the absence of a cavity to which such molecules could bind. However, proteins and especially natural Ras effectors that bind to the Ras/effector interface with high affinity could disrupt Ras/effector interactions and abolish procancer pathways initiated by Ras oncogene. Using a combination of computational design and in vitro evolution, we engineered high-affinity Ras-binding proteins starting from a natural Ras effector, RASSF5 (NORE1A), which is encoded by a tumor suppressor gene. Unlike previously reported Ras oncogene inhibitors, the proteins we designed not only inhibit Ras-regulated procancer pathways, but also stimulate anticancer pathways initiated by RASSF5. We show that upon introduction into A549 lung carcinoma cells, the engineered RASSF5 mutants decreased cell viability and mobility to a significantly greater extent than WT RASSF5. In addition, these mutant proteins induce cellular senescence by increasing acetylation and decreasing phosphorylation of p53. In conclusion, engineered RASSF5 variants provide an attractive therapeutic strategy able to oppose cancer development by means of inhibiting of procancer pathways and stimulating anticancer processes."
https://openalex.org/W3210600262,"Bromodomain adjacent to zinc finger domain protein 2A (BAZ2A) (also called transcription termination factor-1 interacting protein 5), a key component of the nucleolar remodeling complex, recruits the nucleolar remodeling complex to ribosomal RNA genes, leading to their transcriptional repression. In addition to its tandem plant homeodomain-bromodomain that is involved in binding to acetylated histone H4, BAZ2A also contains a methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD)-like Tip5/ARBP/MBD (TAM) domain that shares sequence homology with the MBD. In contrast with the methyl-CpG-binding ability of the canonical MBD, the BAZ2A TAM domain has been shown to bind to promoter-associated RNAs of ribosomal RNA genes and promoter DNAs of other genes independent of DNA methylation. Nevertheless, how the TAM domain binds to RNA/DNA mechanistically remains elusive. Here, we characterized the DNA-/RNA-binding basis of the BAZ2A TAM domain by EMSAs, isothermal titration calorimetry binding assays, mutagenesis analysis, and X-ray crystallography. Our results showed that the TAM domain of BAZ2A selectively binds to dsDNA and dsRNA and that it binds to the backbone of dsDNA in a sequence nonspecific manner, which is distinct from the base-specific binding of the canonical MBD. Thus, our results explain why the TAM domain of BAZ2A does not specifically bind to mCG or TG dsDNA like the canonical MBD and also provide insights for further biological study of BAZ2A acting as a transcription factor in the future."

This study aimed to: Quantify and compare summer and winter participation and activity, and explore how community dwelling people with stroke describe their feelings about their level of participation and activity by season. This embedded mixed-methods observational study took place in a city with weather extremes. Community dwelling individuals at least one year post-stroke, able to walk ≥50 metres +/- a walking aide were included. Evaluations and interviews occurred at participants' homes in two seasons: Reintegration to Normal living Index (RNL), Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) and descriptive outcomes. Participants wore activity monitors for one week each season. Analysis included descriptive statistics, non-parametric tests and an inductive approach to content analysis. Thirteen individuals participated in quantitative evaluation with eight interviewed. Mean age 61.5 years, 62% female and mean 6.2 years post-stroke. No differences between winter-summer values of RNL, ABC, or activity monitor outcomes. However, participants felt they could do more and were more independent in summer. The winter conditions such as ice, snow, cold and wind restricted participation and limited activities. Nonetheless, many participants were active and participated despite the winter challenges by finding other ways to be active, and relying on social supports and personal motivation. The qualitative findings explained unexpected quantitative results. Participants described many challenges with winter weather, but also ways they had discovered to participate and be active despite these challenges. Changes to future studies into seasonal differences are suggested."

Mallards are asymptomatic for the disease and can potentially spread AI along migratory bird flyways. In a previous study, trained mice correctly discriminated the health status of individual ducks on the basis of fecal odors when feces from post-infection periods were paired with feces from pre-infection periods. Chemical analyses indicated that avian influenza infection was associated with a marked increase of acetoin (3-hydroxy-2-butanone) in feces. In the current study, domesticated male ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) were trained to display a specific conditioned response (i.e. active scratch alert) in response to a marked increase of acetoin in a presentation of an acetoin:1-octen-3-ol solution. Ferrets rapidly generalized this learned response to the odor of irradiated feces from avian influenza infected mallards. These results suggest that a trained mammalian biosensor could be employed in an avian influenza surveillance program."
https://openalex.org/W3208325371,"Despite the often emphasized importance of water awareness, and notwithstanding the fact that calls for increasing public awareness are becoming commonplace, most studies do not define the concept, let alone operationalise it into measurable units. This is, however, essential to measure and evaluate efforts related to water awareness such as public campaigns, customer communication and behavioural interventions. To address this gap, we conceptualise, operationalise and assess tap water awareness, hereby differentiating between cognitive awareness (head), affectional awareness (heart), and behavioural awareness (hands). In parallel, we also differentiate between tap water quality, quantity and system. By building on a variety of contemporary conceptual insights in literature and a series of expert interviews, an assessment framework is developed. A cohesive set of nine awareness components are identified and operationalised into a set of tangible questions which are put to the test in a large-scale online survey (n = 1003) in the Netherlands, applying both a traditional and modern segmentation approach based on four types of perspectives (‘quality &amp; health concerned’, ‘aware &amp; committed’, ‘egalitarian &amp; solidary’, and ‘down to earth &amp; confident’). Based on the analysis of the results of the first empirical application of our tap water awareness assessment framework, we conclude that—with a score 53.5 points out of 100—tap water awareness in the Netherlands shows ample room for improvement. Interestingly, most significant variations in awareness are generally not related to sociodemographic factors but rather apply to the four customer perspectives on drinking water that are based on people’s subjective views and preferences."

The study was conducted in infectious disease referral hospital in Metro Manila, the Philippines. We enrolled hospitalized patients at admission who were diagnosed with acute dengue or community acquired bacterial infection (CABI). Immature Platelet Fraction (IPF) and Immature Platelet Fraction Count were evaluated at admission and during hospitalization. A total of 606 patients were enrolled from May 1, 2017 to June 1, 2018. The participants consisted of 152 patients with dengue infection, 180 confirmed CABI, and 274 suspected CABI patients. At admission, the percent IPF (IPF%) of the patients with dengue was significantly higher than that of the confirmed CABI patients (median 3.7% versus 1.9%; p <0.001). In a time course evaluation, there was no significant difference of IPF% between the patients with dengue infection and the confirmed CABI patients in the febrile phase (median 1.9% versus 2.4%; p = 0.488), however, the IPF% of the patients with dengue infection increased to be significantly higher than that of the confirmed CABI patients in the critical phase (median 5.2% versus 2.2%; p <0.001).

The presequence translocase complex, translocase of the inner membrane 23, facilitates most of the import of preproteins containing presequences into the mitochondria, and its primary structural organization is highly conserved. As part of the translocase motor, two J-proteins, DnaJC15 and DnaJC19, are recruited to form two independent translocation machineries (translocase A and translocase B, respectively). On the other hand, the J-like protein subunit of translocase of the inner membrane 23, Mitochondria-associated granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor signaling molecule (Magmas) (orthologous to the yeast subunit Pam16), can regulate human import-motor activity by forming a heterodimer with DnaJC19 and DnaJC15. However, the precise coordinated regulation of two human import motors by a single Magmas protein is poorly understood. Here, we report two additional Magmas variants (Magmas-1 and Magmas-2) constitutively expressed in the mammalian system. Both the Magmas variants are functional orthologs of Pam16 with an evolutionarily conserved J-like domain critical for cell survival. Moreover, the Magmas variants are peripherally associated with the inner membrane as part of the human import motor for translocation. Our results demonstrate that Magmas-1 is predominantly recruited to translocase B, whereas Magmas-2 is majorly associated with translocase A. Strikingly, both the variants exhibit differential J-protein inhibitory activity in modulating import motor, thereby regulating overall translocase function. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that additional Magmas variants are of evolutionary significance in humans to maximize protein import in familial-linked pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3209537043,"Aim Combined antiretroviral treatment (cART) traditionally consists of three antiretroviral medications, while two-drug regimens (2DR), historically used infrequently, recently been suggested to be non-inferior to three-drug regimens, is emerging as a potential treatment option and is currently a recommended option for treatment initiation in many guidelines. Purpose Characterize the indications and clinical efficacy of 2DR use at a real-life setting in a nation-wide survey. Methods A cross-sectional survey of Israeli patients treated by 2DR until July 2019, included demographic, immunologic, virologic, genotypic and biochemical/metabolic parameters at diagnosis, ART initiation, 2DR initiation and following 24, 48, 96 and 144 weeks of 2DR treatment. Results 176 patients were included in the study. In contrast to historical data implicating ART resistance and adverse effects as the major reasons leading to 2DR switching, treatment simplification was the main reason leading to 2DR treatment in 2019. 2DR that included INSTI and PI were more commonly used in cases of drug resistance, while a combination of INSTI and NNRTI was used in all other 2DR indications. A switch to 2DR induced a mean CD4 T cell increase from 599 cells/μl at treatment initiation to 680 cells/μl at 96 weeks of treatment p&lt;0.001 and viral suppression improvement from 73.9% at initiation to 87.0% at 48 weeks of treatment (p = 0.004). PI and INSTI 2DR was inferior in suppressing viral levels compared to other 2DRs but used for subset of more complex patients. Conclusions 2DR in a large-scale real-life nation-wide survey proved to be safe and effective. Most 2DRs, other than PI and INSTI, were similarly effective in suppressing HIV viremia and in elevating CD4 T cell counts."
https://openalex.org/W3209977310,"Competence for natural transformation extensively contributes to genome evolution and the rapid adaptability of bacteria dwelling in challenging environments. In most streptococci, this process is tightly controlled by the ComRS signaling system, which is activated through the direct interaction between the (R)RNPP-type ComR sensor and XIP pheromone (mature ComS). The overall mechanism of activation and the basis of pheromone selectivity have been previously reported in Gram-positive salivarius streptococci; however, detailed 3D-remodeling of ComR leading up to its activation remains only partially understood. Here, we identified using a semirational mutagenesis approach two residues in the pheromone XIP that bolster ComR sensor activation by interacting with two aromatic residues of its XIP-binding pocket. Random and targeted mutagenesis of ComR revealed that the interplay between these four residues remodels a network of aromatic-aromatic interactions involved in relaxing the sequestration of the DNA-binding domain. Based on these data, we propose a comprehensive model for ComR activation based on two major conformational changes of the XIP-binding domain. Notably, the stimulation of this newly identified trigger point by a single XIP substitution resulted in higher competence and enhanced transformability, suggesting that pheromone-sensor coevolution counter-selects for hyperactive systems in order to maintain a trade-off between competence and bacterial fitness. Overall, this study sheds new light on the ComRS activation mechanism and how it could be exploited for biotechnological and biomedical purposes."
https://openalex.org/W3210000281,"The marine bacterium Vibrio campbellii expresses a chitooligosaccharide-specific outer-membrane channel (chitoporin) for the efficient uptake of nutritional chitosugars that are externally produced through enzymic degradation of environmental host shell chitin. However, the principles behind the distinct substrate selectivity of chitoporins are unclear. Here, we employed black lipid membrane (BLM) electrophysiology, which handles the measurement of the flow of ionic current through porins in phospholipid bilayers for the assessment of porin conductivities, to investigate the pH dependency of chitosugar-chitoporin interactions for the bacterium's natural substrate chitohexaose and its deacetylated form, chitosan hexaose. We show that efficient passage of the N-acetylated chitohexaose through the chitoporin is facilitated by its strong affinity for the pore. In contrast, the deacetylated chitosan hexaose is impermeant; however, protonation of the C2 amino entities of chitosan hexaose allows it to be pulled through the channel in the presence of a transmembrane electric field. We concluded from this the crucial role of C2-substitution as the determining factor for chitoporin entry. A change from N-acetylamino- to amino-substitution effectively abolished the ability of approaching molecules to enter the chitoporin, with deacetylation leading to loss of the distinctive structural features of nanopore opening and pore access of chitosugars. These findings provide further understanding of the multistep pathway of chitin utilization by marine Vibrio bacteria and may guide the development of solid-state or genetically engineered biological nanopores for relevant technological applications."

The aim of this study was to investigate if radial pressure wave analysis may non-invasively screen for women's risk of type 2 diabetes.Spectrum analysis of the radial pressure wave was performed to evaluate the first five harmonic components, C1 to C5. The study consisted of a total of 808 non-pregnant female subjects aged 20-95 over the period of 4 years, and 404 of them were diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes as the case group.The first five harmonic components are significantly different in a comparison of the case group and the control group. In the logistic regression analysis, T2DM was found to be associated with C1 (OR = 1.055, CI = 1.037-1.074, p < 0.001), C2 (OR = 1.051, CI = 1.019-1.085, p = 0.002), and C3 (OR = 0.972, CI = 0.950-0.994, p = 0.013). In the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis, the Area Under Curve of using C3 only (70%, p <0.05), weighted C1, C2 and C3, (75%, p < 0.05), and weighted C1, C2 and C3 and Body mass Index (84%, p <0.05) were tested for the accuracy on how well these tests separate the women into the groups with and without the T2DM.We thus concluded that pulse spectrum was a non-invasive predictor for women's risk of T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W3209183333,"To investigate the postoperative course of patients who explanted a diffractive bifocal intraocular lens (IOL) due to waxy vision and implanted with an extended depth of focus IOL.This study evaluated 29 eyes of 25 patients who underwent diffractive bifocal IOL explantation followed by TECNIS Symfony® implantation because of dissatisfaction due to waxy vision at the Takabatake West Eye Clinic between January 2018 and November 2019. The indication criteria for this surgery were patients with uncorrected distance visual acuity of 0.05 logMAR or better, without eye diseases that may affect visual function, and no dissatisfactions about photic phenomena. We investigated patient demographics, uncorrected and corrected visual acuity, manifest refraction, contrast sensitivity, subjective symptoms, time to IOL explantation, explanted IOL type, and spectacle independence.The time to the IOL exchange after the initial IOL implantation was 55.3 ± 50.4 days (range: 14-196 days). The logMAR corrected distance visual acuity before and after IOL exchange were -0.13 ± 0.06 and -0.14 ± 0.06, respectively (p = 0.273). After IOL exchange surgery, the area under log contrast sensitivity function increased significantly from 1.07 ± 0.12 to 1.21 ± 0.12 (p < 0.001), and the waxy vision symptoms improved. The spectacle independence rate at the last visit was 88.0%.For patients who complain of waxy vision despite good visual acuity after diffractive bifocal IOL implantation, exchange to extended depth of focus IOL was considered one of the useful surgical options."
https://openalex.org/W3210319905,"ERBB family members and their ligands play an essential role in embryonic heart development and adult heart physiology. Among them, ERBB3 is a binding partner of ERBB2; the ERBB2/3 complex mediates downstream signaling for cell proliferation. ERBB3 has seven consensus binding sites to the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, which activates the downstream AKT pathway, leading to the proliferation of various cells. This study generated a human ERBB3 knock-in mouse expressing a mutant ERBB3 whose seven YXXM p85 binding sites were replaced with YXXA. Erbb3 knock-in embryos exhibited lethality between E12.5 to E13.5, and showed a decrease in mesenchymal cell numbers and density in AV cushions. We determined that the proliferation of mesenchymal cells in the atrioventricular (AV) cushion in Erbb3 knock-in mutant embryos was temporarily reduced due to the decrease of AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Overall, our results suggest that AKT/ERK activation by the ERBB3-dependent PI3K signaling is crucial for AV cushion morphogenesis during embryonic heart development."
https://openalex.org/W3210675061,"One of the factors contributing to a high maternal mortality rate is the utilization of non-healthcare facilities as a birthplace for women. This study analyzed determinants affecting birthplace in middle-to lower-class women in Indonesia.This study analyzed the 2017 Indonesian Demographic and Health Survey (IDHS) data. The total national sample size was 49,627 eligible women. Our sample included 11,104 women, aged 15-49, who had delivered babies and were of low-to-middle economic status. The type of survey dataset was individual record dataset. Data were analyzed with chi-square and multivariate logistic regression tests using Stata 16 software.About 64.99% middle to lower class women in Indonesia delivered in healthcare facilities. Women aged 45-49 (OR = 2.103; 95% CI = 1.13-3.93), who graduated from higher schools (OR = 2.885; 95% CI = 1.76-4.73), whose husbands had higher education (OR = 2.826; 95% CI = 1.69-4.74) and were employed (OR = 2.523; 95% CI = 1.23-5.17), who considered access to healthcare facilities was not a problem (OR = 1.528; 95% CI = 1.28-1.82), who had a single child (OR = 2.349; 95% CI = 1.97-2.80), and who lived in urban areas (OR = 2.930; 95% CI = 2.40-3.57) were determinants that significantly correlated with women giving birth in healthcare facilities.This study provides insights for policymakers and healthcare centers in the community to strengthen access to healthcare services and devise health promotion strategies for pregnant mothers. Policy interventions designed for middle- to lower-class women should be implemented to support vulnerable groups."
