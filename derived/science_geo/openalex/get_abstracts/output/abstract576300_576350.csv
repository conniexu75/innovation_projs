To engineer these states, physicists have used semiconductor nanowires in contact with a superconductor. Although many of the observed properties align with theoretical predictions, a closer look into the creation of MBSs is desirable. Deng et al. fabricated nanowires with a quantum dot at one end that served as a spectrometer for the states that formed inside the superconducting gap of the nanowire. Using this setup, topologically trivial bound states were seen to coalesce into MBSs as the magnetic field was varied. Science , this issue p. 1557"

By probing the emitter with a local intensity minimum of excitation light, MINFLUX minimizes the fluorescence photons needed for high localization precision. A 22-fold reduction of photon detections over that required in popular centroid-localization is demonstrated. In superresolution microscopy, MINFLUX attained ~1 nm precision, resolving molecules only 6 nm apart. Tracking single fluorescent proteins by MINFLUX increased the temporal resolution and the localizations per trace by 100-fold, as demonstrated with diffusing 30S ribosomal subunits in living E. coli. Since conceptual limits have not been reached, we expect this localization modality to break new ground for observing the dynamics, distribution, and structure of macromolecules in living cells and beyond."

https://openalex.org/W2567580014,"Axon regeneration is essential to restore the nervous system after axon injury. However, the neuronal cell biology that underlies axon regeneration is incompletely understood. Here we use in vivo, single-neuron analysis to investigate the relationship between nerve injury, mitochondrial localization, and axon regeneration. Mitochondria translocate into injured axons so that average mitochondria density increases after injury. Moreover, single-neuron analysis reveals that axons that fail to increase mitochondria have poor regeneration. Experimental alterations to axonal mitochondrial distribution or mitochondrial respiratory chain function result in corresponding changes to regeneration outcomes. Axonal mitochondria are specifically required for growth-cone migration, identifying a key energy challenge for injured neurons. Finally, mitochondrial localization to the axon after injury is regulated in part by dual-leucine zipper kinase 1 (DLK-1), a conserved regulator of axon regeneration. These data identify regulation of axonal mitochondria as a new cell-biological mechanism that helps determine the regenerative response of injured neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2564929366,"Activity-dependent transcription has emerged as a major source of gene products that regulate neuronal excitability, connectivity, and synaptic properties. However, the elongation rate of RNA polymerases imposes a significant temporal constraint for transcript synthesis, in particular for long genes where new synthesis requires hours. Here we reveal a novel, transcription-independent mechanism that releases transcripts within minutes of neuronal stimulation. We found that, in the mouse neocortex, polyadenylated transcripts retain select introns and are stably accumulated in the cell nucleus. A subset of these intron retention transcripts undergoes activity-dependent splicing, cytoplasmic export, and ribosome loading, thus acutely releasing mRNAs in response to stimulation. This process requires NMDA receptor- and calmodulin-dependent kinase pathways, and it is particularly prevalent for long transcripts. We conclude that regulated intron retention in fully transcribed RNAs represents a mechanism to rapidly mobilize a pool of mRNAs in response to neuronal activity."
https://openalex.org/W2561072227,"With early life likely to have existed in a hot environment, enzymes had to cope with an inherent drop in catalytic speed caused by lowered temperature. Here we characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying thermoadaptation of enzyme catalysis in adenylate kinase using ancestral sequence reconstruction spanning 3 billion years of evolution. We show that evolution solved the enzyme’s key kinetic obstacle—how to maintain catalytic speed on a cooler Earth—by exploiting transition-state heat capacity. Tracing the evolution of enzyme activity and stability from the hot-start toward modern hyperthermophilic, mesophilic, and psychrophilic organisms illustrates active pressure versus passive drift in evolution on a molecular level, refutes the debated activity/stability trade-off, and suggests that the catalytic speed of adenylate kinase is an evolutionary driver for organismal fitness."

https://openalex.org/W2564889673,"The gain of eccrine sweat glands in hairy body skin has empowered humans to run marathons and tolerate temperature extremes. Epithelial-mesenchymal cross-talk is integral to the diverse patterning of skin appendages, but the molecular events underlying their specification remain largely unknown. Using genome-wide analyses and functional studies, we show that sweat glands are specified by mesenchymal-derived bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and fibroblast growth factors that signal to epithelial buds and suppress epithelial-derived sonic hedgehog (SHH) production. Conversely, hair follicles are specified when mesenchymal BMP signaling is blocked, permitting SHH production. Fate determination is confined to a critical developmental window and is regionally specified in mice. In contrast, a shift from hair to gland fates is achieved in humans when a spike in BMP silences SHH during the final embryonic wave(s) of bud morphogenesis."

Hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the bi-directionally transcribed C9orf72 gene is the most frequent cause of familial ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Kramer et al., 2016Kramer N.J.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder in which premature loss of upper and lower motor neurons leads to fatal paralysis. It is now increasingly recognized that ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by behavioral and language changes, belong to a disease continuum that has clinical, pathological, and genetic overlap. In 2011, the strongest genetic link between ALS and FTD was identified to be a GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene (DeJesus-Hernandez et al., 2011DeJesus-Hernandez M. Mackenzie I.R. Boeve B.F. Boxer A.L. Baker M. Rutherford N.J. Nicholson A.M. Finch N.A. Flynn H.

Intron 1 of the C9orf72 gene contains a GGGGCC hexanucleotide normally repeated between 2 and 30 times, but patients with C9orf72 mutations carry an allele with an inherited length of hundreds of repeats that further expand somatically in the nervous system to thousands of repeats (Figure 1A). Repeat expansion in C9orf72 is the most frequent cause of both inherited ALS and FTD. The identification of repeat expansion in C9orf72 adds ALS/FTD to the growing list of repeat expansion disorders, which includes Huntington’s disease, myotonic dystrophies, Fragile X syndrome, Friedreich’s ataxia, and several spinocerebellar ataxias. Three mechanisms have been proposed for how C9orf72 repeat expansions cause disease (to be referred to as C9ALS/FTD): (1) loss of C9orf72 protein function and/or gain of toxicity from repeat-containing RNAs by either (2) sequestration of key RNA-binding proteins into intranuclear RNA foci comprised of repeat RNA or (3) production of aberrant dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins through repeat-associated non-AUG-dependent (RAN) translation that does not require an AUG start codon. To make it more complicated, both sense GGGGCC and antisense CCCCGG repeat-containing RNAs are transcribed from the mutant C9orf72 gene, form independent sense and antisense RNA foci, and those RNAs are translated to produce five different DPR proteins in C9ALS/FTD patients (poly[GA] and poly[GR] from sense RNA, poly[PR] and poly[PA] from antisense RNA, and poly[GP] from both sense and antisense RNAs) (Figures 1B and 1C). A major therapeutic challenge for C9ALS/FTD is to understand the main underlying disease mechanism(s) and target the range of potentially toxic RNA and protein species produced. Loss of C9orf72 function alone seems unlikely to be sufficient to cause ALS/FTD as no missense or truncation mutations have been identified thus far in patients, and in mice neither reduction nor complete ablation of C9orf72 provokes central nervous system (CNS) disease (Jiang et al., 2016Jiang J. Zhu Q. Gendron T.F. Saberi S. McAlonis-Downes M. Seelman A. Stauffer J.E. Jafar-Nejad P. Drenner K.

Ho R. Carmona S. Vit J.P. Zarrow J. et al.Science. 2016; 351: 1324-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Whether C9orf72 loss of function contributes to disease together with gain of toxicity has not been determined. C9orf72 null mice develop disease outside the nervous system, including splenomegaly and increased lymph node size, along with lysosomal deficits and altered immune responses in macrophages and microglia. This latter finding has suggested that C9orf72 loss may provoke neuroinflammation that contributes to C9ALS/FTD (O’Rourke et al., 2016O’Rourke J.G. Bogdanik L. Yáñez A. Lall D. Wolf A.J. Muhammad A.K. Ho R. Carmona S. Vit J.P. Zarrow J. et al.Science. 2016; 351: 1324-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). On the other hand, overexpression of repeat-containing RNAs or DPR proteins in various model systems including mice (Chew et al., 2015Chew J. Gendron T.F. Prudencio M. Sasaguri H. Zhang Y.J. Castanedes-Casey M. Lee C.W. Jansen-West K. Kurti A. Murray M.E. et al.Science. 2015; 348: 1151-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, Jiang et al., 2016Jiang J. Zhu Q. Gendron T.F.

While the degree to which disease pathogenesis arises from RNA-mediated sequestration of vital RNA-binding proteins or from accumulation of RAN translated proteins has not been determined, therapies that reduce repeat-containing RNAs will target both potential mechanisms. The most advanced of this class of therapies is the use of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). These designer DNA drugs are short (18- to 20-mer) single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides that when base paired with a target RNA make that RNA a substrate for degradation by the nearly ubiquitously expressed, nuclearly localized enzyme RNase H. A single dose injection into the cerebral spinal fluid of mice of ASOs targeting sense strand RNAs encoded by a 450 repeat-containing human C9orf72 transgene (1) selectively reduced sense repeat-containing RNAs with minimal effect on mature C9orf72 mRNAs, (2) mitigated the accumulation of sense RNA foci and DPR proteins, and (3) significantly ameliorated age-dependent cognitive and behavioral deficits reminiscent of FTD (Jiang et al., 2016Jiang J. Zhu Q. Gendron T.F. Saberi S. McAlonis-Downes M. Seelman A. Stauffer J.E. Jafar-Nejad P. Drenner K. Schulte D. et al.Neuron. 2016; 90: 535-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). ASO-induced reduction in repeat-containing sense strand RNAs had no effect, however, on antisense strand foci or RAN products. Since sense and antisense transcription of the expanded C9orf72 locus may both contribute to toxicity, an even more attractive therapy would be to bi-directionally reduce C9orf72 transcription. A way to do this with a designer DNA-based ASO has now been proposed (Kramer et al., 2016Kramer N.J. Carlomagno Y. Zhang Y.J. Almeida S. Cook C.N. Gendron T.F. Prudencio M. Van Blitterswijk M. Belzil V. Couthouis J. et al.Science. 2016; 353: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) through the use of an ASO to reduce the expression of the SUPT4H1/SUPT5H transcriptional elongation factor complex that apparently functions to prevent RNA polymerase II from dissociating from a DNA template when it encounters a complicated secondary structure, including hairpins or quadraplexes predicted to form on repeated domains. This activity was originally identified in yeast using a gene inactivation screen to determine that deletion of the gene encoding a small highly conserved zinc finger protein named Spt4 (the yeast homolog of SUPT4H1) selectively inhibited transcription of long CAG trinucleotide repeats responsible for Huntington’s disease (Liu et al., 2012Liu C.R. Chang C.R. Chern Y. Wang T.H. Hsieh W.C. Shen W.C. Chang C.Y. Chu I.C. Deng N. Cohen S.N. Cheng T.H. Cell. 2012; 148: 690-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Remarkably, although Spt4 deletion reduced transcription of genes containing a lengthy stretch of CTG, CAA, or even long AAA repeats, RNA-seq analysis revealed that the majority of RNAs were unchanged. Subsequently, lowering SUPT4H1 by genetic deletion or ASOs in two different mouse models of Huntington’s disease was found to reduce transcription of a CAG repeat expansion allele (without affecting a normal allele), accompanied by reduced mutant polyQ protein production and aggregation, mitigated motor impairment, and prolonged lifespan (Cheng et al., 2015Cheng H.M. Chern Y. Chen I.H. Liu C.R. Li S.H. Chun S.J. Rigo F. Bennett C.F. Deng N. Feng Y. et al.PLoS Genet. 2015; 11: e1005043Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Those earlier efforts have now been extended to C9orf72 expansions by Gitler and colleagues (Kramer et al., 2016Kramer N.J. Carlomagno Y. Zhang Y.J. Almeida S. Cook C.N. Gendron T.F. Prudencio M. Van Blitterswijk M. Belzil V. Couthouis J. et al.Science. 2016; 353: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), who identify that eliminating SUPT4H1/SUPT5H reduces (maximally by 2-fold) bi-directional transcription of hexanucleotide repeat-containing C9orf72 RNAs. They start with yeast expressing either 66 sense (GGGGCC) or 66 antisense (CCCCGG) repeats and find that Spt4 deletion decreases both sense and antisense repeat RNAs. Modulation is repeat length dependent: Spt4 deletion has little effect on expression of alleles with only 2 repeats. Sense and antisense RNA foci accumulation from transcription of long hexanucleotide repeats was almost completely blocked by Spt4 depletion. Robust poly(GP) DPR protein accumulation from RAN translation in yeast expressing high levels of 40 GGGGCC repeats was reduced to ∼25% following Spt4 depletion. RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown Spt4 to 10% of normal level was also shown to reduce RNA foci, DPR accumulation, and toxicity in C. elegans expressing a 66 repeat gene in neurons. Conversely, toxicity in those worms was enhanced by expression of the mammalian SUPT4H1 homolog. Similar modulation of eye toxicity was observed in Drosophila expressing 6, 29 or 49 sense GGGGCC repeats. Reducing Spt4 (to ∼50%) with RNAi partially suppressed the degenerative phenotype in flies expressing 49 GGGGCC repeats and completely suppressed retinal thinning in flies expressing 29 GGGGCC repeats. Furthermore, reducing Spt4 expression increased the lifespan of adult flies ubiquitously expressing 49 GGGGCC repeats. The repeat length in the nervous systems of C9ALS/FTD patients is much longer than the short repeats used in these test systems. To validate that SUPT4H1/SUPT5H act to transcriptionally elongate longer repeats, small interfering RNAs were used to reduce levels of either or both in human C9ALS patient fibroblasts. Suppression by 80%–90% of either or both genes reduced sense and antisense repeat-containing RNAs by at most 50% and reduced poly(GP) proteins by 60%–80% (Kramer et al., 2016Kramer N.J. Carlomagno Y. Zhang Y.J. Almeida S. Cook C.N. Gendron T.F. Prudencio M. Van Blitterswijk M. Belzil V. Couthouis J. et al.Science. 2016; 353: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In contrast, use of an ASO to target GGGGCC repeat containing RNAs more effectively reduced sense strand RNA foci (by >80%) and inhibited poly(GP) accumulation almost completely, but left antisense RNA foci unaffected (Kramer et al., 2016Kramer N.J. Carlomagno Y. Zhang Y.J. Almeida S. Cook C.N. Gendron T.F. Prudencio M. Van Blitterswijk M. Belzil V. Couthouis J. et al.Science. 2016; 353: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Reducing SUPT4H1 in pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons from C9ALS patients modestly reduced (by ∼30%) the amount of sense repeat-containing RNAs and poly(GP). Thus, SUPT4H1 or SUPT5H are important new targets for C9ALS/FTD therapy development, as individually targeting either can bi-directionally reduce transcription of both sense and antisense C9orf72 repeats, leading to the corresponding reduction of multiple C9ALS/FTD pathologies. It has now been a decade since Smith et al., 2006Smith R.A. Miller T.M. Yamanaka K. Monia B.P. Condon T.P. Hung G. Lobsiger C.S. Ward C.M. McAlonis-Downes M. Wei H. et al.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 2290-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar pioneered the idea of ASO infusion into the nervous system as therapy for human neurodegenerative disease. The founding example was ALS therapy for inherited disease caused by dominant mutation in the gene encoding superoxide dismutase (SOD1). ASO infusion was found to lower mutant SOD1 synthesis and double survival after disease onset (Smith et al., 2006Smith R.A. Miller T.M. Yamanaka K. Monia B.P. Condon T.P. Hung G. Lobsiger C.S. Ward C.M. McAlonis-Downes M. Wei H. et al.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 2290-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Subsequently, infusion of ASOs into the cerebral spinal fluid at the bottom of the spinal cord was demonstrated to produce dose-dependent RNase H-mediated target RNA degradation throughout the non-human primate nervous system, with single dose injections providing durable target reduction that continued for 3 months (Kordasiewicz et al., 2012Kordasiewicz H.B. Stanek L.M. Wancewicz E.V. Mazur C. McAlonis M.M. Pytel K.A. Artates J.W. Weiss A. Cheng S.H.

ASO infusion to lower huntingtin RNAs carrying CAG expansions produced partial disease reversal in two Huntington’s disease model mice and prevented further loss of brain mass in the most aggressive and highly used R6/2 model (Kordasiewicz et al., 2012Kordasiewicz H.B.

These efforts supported initiation of clinical trials currently underway with ASOs for SOD1-linked ALS and Huntington’s disease and a successful Phase III trial in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which concluded in August 2016 using ASO infusion to restore SMN synthesis by ASO-mediated correction of the splicing of the SMN2 gene. d'Ydewalle et al., 2016d'Ydewalle C.

For ALS/FTD from C9orf72 expansion, ASOs targeting sense repeat-containing C9orf72 RNAs can decrease sense RNA foci and DPR proteins in patient derived cells (Donnelly et al., 2013Donnelly C.J.

Similarly, ASO infusion can ameliorate both the RNA foci and DPR pathologies in transgenic mice expressing a C9orf72 transgene with 450 repeats and can prevent age-dependent, FTD-like cognitive and behavioral deficits (Jiang et al., 2016Jiang J. Zhu Q. Gendron T.F. Saberi S. McAlonis-Downes M. Seelman A. Stauffer J.E. Jafar-Nejad P. Drenner K. Schulte D. et al.Neuron. 2016; 90: 535-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Although the relative contributions to disease of sense and antisense derived RNAs are not established, ASOs targeting sense repeat-containing RNAs (without affecting antisense RNA foci) are sufficient to mitigate behavioral deficits. Thus, targeting sense repeats definitely has beneficial effects. Whether targeting antisense repeats by ASOs will have additional benefits has not been determined. Nevertheless, the discovery by Gitler’s team has enabled a potentially more comprehensive approach in which injection of a single ASO targeting the RNAs encoding either SUPT4H1 or SUPT5H would bi-directionally suppress C9orf72 RNA transcription, RNA foci, and DPR pathologies. Strong support for the broad potential of ASO targeting of SUPT4H1 for repeat expansion diseases has come from expanded allele-specific reduction in huntingtin mRNA expression in mouse models of Huntington’s disease (Cheng et al., 2015Cheng H.M.

That said, there are two concerns for SUPT4H1 (or SUPT5H) as therapeutic targets. First, both SUPT4H1 and SUPT5H affect expression of multiple genes. Indeed, while deletion of one copy of SUPT4H1 did not lead to any overt phenotype in mice up to 18 months of age, SUPT4H1 is an essential gene whose absence produces embryonic lethality (Cheng et al., 2015Cheng H.M. Chern Y. Chen I.H. Liu C.R. Li S.H. Chun S.J. Rigo F. Bennett C.F. Deng N. Feng Y. et al.PLoS Genet. 2015; 11: e1005043Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Perhaps more importantly, reducing SUPT4H1 to <10% of its normal level in human fibroblasts also altered the expression of >300 genes, 46 of which were changed by >3-fold (Kramer et al., 2016Kramer N.J. Carlomagno Y. Zhang Y.J. Almeida S. Cook C.N. Gendron T.F. Prudencio M. Van Blitterswijk M. Belzil V. Couthouis J. et al.Science. 2016; 353: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Second, the maximum effect from SUPT4H1/SUPT5H reduction appears to produce a 2-fold reduction in C9orf72 sense and antisense repeat RNAs, with siRNA-mediated lowering of SUPT4H1/SUPT5H to <10% its initial level producing only ∼50% reduction of repeat containing RNAs and RNA foci in human C9orf72 expansion fibroblasts. This contrasts with ASO treatment targeting the sense strand C9orf72 intron adjacent to the repeat expansion, which in a dose-dependent manner lower or almost eliminate sense strand repeat-containing RNAs, sense RNA foci, and poly(GP) accumulation both in human fibroblasts (Lagier-Tourenne et al., 2013Lagier-Tourenne C.

A key goal now needed for therapy development for SUPT4H1/SUPT5H is to determine the benefit/risk profile by assessing the degree of suppression of C9orf72 RNA foci, DPR, and disease development that can be achieved by ASO-mediated reduction in SUPT4H1/SUPT5H in transgenic mice overexpressing C9orf72 repeats (Jiang et al., 2016Jiang J.

At a meeting of the American Geophysical Union, scientists flagged two more potential culprits: In one scenario, methane's rise may come in part from a drop in hydroxyl, a chemical that acts as an atmospheric detergent; in the other, the gas is emanating from tropical wetlands flooded by heavy rains in recent years. Both have likely played a role, along with agriculture, in the methane rise, but uncertain data complicate efforts to pin the cause down. It's possible, scientists say, that an increase in methane from the tropics could be related to warming, and, much like Arctic sea ice, a signal of a system in flux."

Extracellular space takes up a large percentage of the brain. Its size changes with the sleep-wake cycle but also during brain development and normal aging, as well as under pathological conditions such as neurodegeneration. Godin et al. injected near-infrared luminescent carbon nanotubes into rat brains and tracked their diffusion in the extracellular space. This method revealed the dimensions of the extracellular space in live brain tissue. The extracellular space turned out to be a maze of interconnected compartments of multiple shapes that are structured in a wide range of different dimensions. This novel technique thus allows neuroscientists to observe fine structures of the extracellular space and provides insights into the flow of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain.

Fuel cells currently rely too heavily on expensive platinum catalysts to reduce oxygen. Cheaper metals still have not matched the efficiency of platinum. Pegis et al. studied a series of well-defined iron porphyrin complexes in solution, in the interest of discerning which factors would be most productive to optimize. They found that the turnover frequencies correlated with overpotential, despite rate-limiting oxygen binding. Further grounds for optimization emerged from distinctions between the iron redox properties and the proton transfer characteristics of substituent interactions in the second coordination sphere.

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are formed through moderately strong bonds between multidentate centers and organic linkers. One difficulty in using very strong linkages to create more robust materials is that the process of crystallization must allow for error correction, so the linkages must be weak enough to be reversible. Waller et al. bypassed this problem by converting the imine linkages in two COFs into stronger amide linkages, using mild oxidizing conditions. Both materials retained their crystallinity and porosity and displayed much greater stability; they were stable after 24 hours in 12 M hydrochloric acid, as well as 1 M sodium hydroxide.

Natural killer (NK) cells are immune cells that kill virally infected target cells. To do this, NK cells dock with their sickened targets and unleash on them the destructive contents of their cytotoxic lytic granules. Hsu et al. looked at the detailed cellular rearrangements involved in killing. They regulated signaling pathways and used acoustic trap microscopy to arrange NK and target cells in such a way that the lytic granules would be released in a directed fashion toward the targets or in a nondirected fashion. Perhaps unsurprisingly, when the NK cells had the chance to line up and release their lytic granules directly toward their targets, fewer bystander cells were damaged. Furthermore, killing of the target cells was more efficient. Inhibiting the microtubule motor dynein or blocking cell adhesion molecules interfered with targeted killing and increased nondirected granule release, thereby damaging more bystander cells.

During brain development, blood vasculature grows rapidly to keep up with growing brain tissue. Studying the mouse hindbrain, Tata et al. show how these events are coordinated. Peak angiogenesis during embryonic development correlates with a surge in mitotic activity of neural progenitor cells. Processes from these cells wrap around developing vessels or tag the perineural vascular plexus. The interaction depends on neuropilin-1 (NRP1), a cell surface receptor that is expressed in endothelial cells of the developing vasculature. Without NRP1, neural progenitor cells fail to proliferate normally, resulting in fewer than normal progenitors and compromising hindbrain growth.
