https://openalex.org/W1986838295,"An investigation into the growth of energy use in the food system is presented. An attempt is made to compare the present food supply system, in energy measures, with those of other societies and with the U. S. past. The energy provided by the sun is omitted in the survey, but the other factors considered are fuel (direct use), electricity, fertilizer, agricultural steel, farm machinery, tractors, irrigation, food processing industry and machinery, paper packaging, glass containers, steel cans and aluminum, transport (fuel), trucks and trailers, commercial refrigeration and cooking, refrigeration machinery (home and Commercial), home refrigeration and cooking. Private delivery by the individual is not included. Energy subsidies for various food crops are shown in various countries and compared with the U. S. food system. In primitive cultures, 5 to 50 food calories were obtained for each calorie of energy invested. Industrialized food systems require 5 to 10 calories to obtain 1 food calorie. An analysis of the energy flow in the food system illustrates features of the food system unrealized in a usual economic analysis. (32 references) (MCW)"
https://openalex.org/W2157835171,"A partially purified enzyme from rabbit brain catalyzed the oxygenative cleavage of the pyrrole moiety of melatonin yielding Nγ-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynurenamine, which was further degraded to Nγ-acetyl-5-methoxykynurenamine by the action of formamidase. Authentic samples of these two metabolites were synthesized by ozonolysis of melatonin and were shown to be indistinguishable from the enzymic products. When [14C]melatonin was injected intracisternally, the major metabolite in the rat brain was shown to be Nγ-acetyl-5-methoxykynurenamine. The results indicate that these two new metabolites are involved in the major metabolic pathway of melatonin in the central nervous system."

This rhythm persists in blinded animals but is suppressed in normnal rats by light. The rhythm in norepinephrine turnover generates the rhythums in pineal indoleamines and N-acetyltransferase.

https://openalex.org/W1549255782,"Abstract The conversion of 14C-labeled fatty acylsphingosine and phosphatidyl[14C]choline to sphingomyelin could be demonstrated in lyophilized microsomes from mouse liver. Radioactive CDP-choline did not act as a choline donor. No cofactors were needed, although CDP-choline and P-choline exerted some stimulatory action. The unnatural ceramide, acetyl threo-sphingosine, could be converted to the corresponding sphingomyelin but this reaction required Mn2+ and CDP-choline. Evidence from isotopic trapping experiments was interpreted to indicate that the P-choline transfer from lecithin to ceramide did not go through free CDP-choline, choline, or P-choline. The transferase was found in kidney, lung, liver, spleen, and heart (in decreasing order of activity) but not in brain. The enzyme was inhibited by diglyceride and lysolecithin."

https://openalex.org/W2009797934,"Estimates of IQ heritability are subject to a variety of systematic errors. The IQ scores themselves contain uncontrollable, systematic errors of unknown magnitude. These arise because IQ scores, unlike conventional physical and biological measurements, have a purely instrumental definition. The effects of these errors are apparent in the very large discrepancies among IQ correlations measured by different investigators. Genotype-environment correlations, whose effects can sometimes be minimized, if not wholly eliminated, in experiments with plants and animals, are nearly always important in human populations. The absence of significant effects arising from genotype-environment correlations is a necessary condition for the applicability of conventional heritability analysis to phenotypically plastic traits. When this condition fails, no quantitative inferences about heritability can be drawn from measured phenotypic variances and covariances, except under special conditions that are unlikely to be satisfied by phenotypically plastic traits in human populations. Inadequate understanding of the precise environmental factors relevant to the development of specific behavioral traits is an important source of systematic errors, as is the inability to allow adequately for the effects of assortative mating and gene-gene interaction. Systematic cultural differences and differences in psychological environment among races and among sociocco-nomic groups vitiate any attempt to draw from IQ data meaningful inferences about genetic differences. Estimates based on phenotypic correlations between separated monozygotic twins-usually considered to be the most reliable kind of estimates-are vitiated by systematic errors inherent in IQ tests, by the presence of genotype-environment correlation, and by the lack of detailed understanding of environmental factors relevant to the development of behavioral traits. Other kinds of estimates are beset, in addition, by systematic errors arising from incomplete allowance for the effects of assortative mating and from gene-gene interactions. The only potentially useful data are phenotypic correlations between unrelated foster children reared together, which could, in principle, yield lower limits for e(2). Available data indicate that, for unrelated foster children reared together, the broad heritability (h(2)) may lie between 0.0 and 0.5. This estimate does not apply to populations composed of children reared by their biological parents or by near relatives. For such populations the heritability of IQ remains undefined. The only data that might yield meaningful estimates ot narrow heritability are phenotypic correlations between half-sibs reared in statistically independent environments. No useful data of this kind are available. Intervention studies like Heber's Milwaukee Project afford an alternative and comparatively direct way of studying the plasticity of cognitive and other behavioral traits in human populations. Results obtained so far strongly suggest that the development of cognitive skills is highly sensitive to variations in environmental factors. These conclusions have three obvious implications for the broader issues mentioned at the beginning of this article. 1) Published analyses of IQ data provide no support whatever for Jensen's thesis that inequalities in cognitive performance are due largely to genetic differences. As Lewontin (8) has clearly shown, the value of the broad heritability of IQ is in any case only marginally relevant to this question. I have argued that conventional estimates of the broad heritability of IQ are invalid and that the only data on which potentially valid estimates might be based are consistent with a broad heritability of less than 0.5. On the other hand, intervention studies, if their findings prove to be replicable, would directly establish that, under suitable conditions, the offspring of parents whose cognitive skills are so poorly developed as to exclude them from all but the most menial occupations can achieve what are regarded as distinctly high levels of cognitive performance. Thus, despite the fact that children differ suibstantially in cognitive aptitudes and appetites, and despite the very high probability that these differences have a substantial genetic component, available scientific evidence strongly suggests that environmental factors are responsible for the failure of children not suffering from specific neurological disorders to achieve adequate levels of cognitive performance. 2) Under prevailing social conditions, no valid inferences can be drawn from IQ data concerning systematic genetic differences among races or socioeconomic groups. Research along present lines directed toward this end-whatever its ethical status-is scientifically worthless. 3) Since there are no suitable data for estimating the narrow heritability of IQ, it seems pointless to speculate about the prospects for a hereditary meritocracy based on IQ."
https://openalex.org/W1577789169,"Abstract 2-Azido-4-nitrophenol (NPA) is a potent, water-soluble uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation. It is photochemically active and capable of covalent labeling of the mitochondrial components presumably concerned with the uncoupling process. Acrylamide gel electrophoresis of NPA-labeled mitochondria digested with sodium dodecyl sulfate and mercaptoethanol showed that 40% of NPA radioactivity was associated with protein bands in the molecular weight region of 20,000 to 30,000. Equilibrium binding studies with NPA, under nonphotolytic conditions, have shown that bovine heart mitochondria contain 0.56 ± 0.13 nmole of a uniformly reacting uncoupler binding site per mg of protein. The binding of NPA to these sites is competitively inhibited by other uncouplers, but not by antimycin A, rutamycin, valinomycin, or arsenate. The uncouplers tested against NPA were sodium azide, 2,4-dinitrophenol, pentachlorophenol, carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, and 5-chloro-3-t-butyl-2'-chloro-4'-nitrosalicylanilide. The uncoupler binding sites are located in the inner membrane, and do not appear to involve F1 (ATPase). They are unaffected with respect to NPA binding by changes in the respiratory state or the energization state of mitochondria. Data regarding dissociation constants and the uncoupler potencies of NPA, 2,4-dinitrophenol, and azide have suggested that the uncoupler binding sites of mitochondria are functionally involved in the act of uncoupling."

https://openalex.org/W1541911552,"Abstract The percentage of total pyruvate dehydrogenase in the active nonphosphorylated form was measured in intact rat liver mitochondria after rapid separation of the mitochondria through silicone oil and extraction with glycerol buffer at -10°. The contents of ATP, ADP, Mg2+, and Ca2+ in the mitochondrial matrix of separated mitochondria were determined in parallel experiments. Mitochondria were incubated with glutamate and malate as substrates in a variety of metabolic states. These were induced by addition of oligomycin, uncoupler, the divalent cation ionophore A23187, and other inhibitors in order to alter the phosphorylation state of the intramitochondrial adenine nucleotides and the contents of magnesium and calcium. Interconversion between the active nonphosphorylated form of pyruvate dehydrogenase and the inactive phosphorylated form appeared to be dominated by regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity. Under conditions of controlled respiration, the percentage of pyruvate dehydrogenase in the active form varied directly with the ADP content and inversely with the ATP:ADP ratio. Regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase interconversion by pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase activity could only be demonstrated under severe conditions of magnesium and calcium depletion. It is concluded that the normal content of Mg2+ and Ca2+ in isolated mitochondria is sufficient to provide optimal activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase and that release of Mg2+ by conversion of MgATP2- to ADP, Pi, and Mg2+ during active respiration has a negligible effect on pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase activity. The over-all steady state activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase appears to be determined by pyruvate and ADP which inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, and thereby prevent phosphorylation and inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase. Regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase activity is thus achieved without an unnecessary expenditure of ATP for enzyme phosphorylation and dephosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W1498827868,"Abstract Cell walls of all species of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces underwent autohydrolysis in buffer at pH 5.0, releasing β-(1→3)-linked oligosaccharides, variable amounts of glucose, and β-(1→3)-glucanase activity. Schizosaccharomyces versatilis walls were the most active in this respect and were studied in detail. The most complete release of β-glucanases (about 80% of the total activity) took place when the autolysis was done in dialysis sacs; in a closed system, enzyme release was considerably reduced. The released β-glucanase activity was very stable and could be separated by diethylaminoethyl-chromatography into an endo-β-(1→3)-glucanase (not adsorbed, 13% of the total activity) and an adsorbed fraction (87 %), which was recovered by elution and proved to be exo-β-glucanase. The latter enzyme was extensively purified and had properties identical to those of the previously studied exo-β-glucanase from cell extracts or the extracellular enzyme in the culture medium. The endo-β-(1→3)-glucanase was purified by column chromatography until it was electrophoretically homogeneous with a molecular weight of 97,000. β-(1→3)-linked glucans were hydrolyzed randomly to oligosaccharides, finally yielding laminaribiose and glucose. Laminaritriose was hydrolyzed much more rapidly than by endoglucanases from other organisms. The enzyme has an optimum pH at 5 to 6, a Vmax of 5 µmoles of glucose equivalents released per min per mg of protein, and a Km value of 0.33 mg of laminarin per ml. The enzyme demonstrated sigmoidal kinetics with two cooperative active sites per enzyme molecule. Glucono-δ-lactone showed noncompetitive inhibition with a Ki of 95 mm. The enzyme did not contain any carbohydrate or phosphorus. The exoglucanase had no effect on cell walls but the endoglucanase caused extensive lysis. Complete lysis was obtained if a bacterial α-(1→3)-glucanase was added to the endo-β-(1→3)-glucanase. No evidence was obtained for the presence of endo-β-(1→6)- or endo-α-(1→3)-glucanases in Schizosaccharomyces. Endo-β-(1→3)-glucanases were demonstrated also in the cell walls of a number of other species of yeast."

https://openalex.org/W1534638756,"Abstract The thymidine analogue, 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) exerts a selective inhibition on cytodifferentiation of the embryonic rat pancreas. Pancreatic rudiments cultured in the presence of appropriate levels of BrdUrd exhibit essentially normal rates of protein, RNA, and DNA synthesis, but do not accumulate the specific acinar proteins; half-maximal inhibition of the synthesis and accumulation of chymotrypsin, amylase, ribonuclease, and procarboxypeptidases A and B occurs at levels of BrdUrd 50-fold below the levels required for half-maximal inhibition of the synthesis of total proteins. Tissues grown in the presence of these low levels of BrdUrd appear healthy from an ultrastructural point of view, but the presumptive acinar cells are devoid of either zymogen granules or large vesicular structures resembling zymogen granule membranes. However, many cells possess extensive rough endoplasmic reticulum. The enhanced ribosomal RNA synthesis observed in the normal differentiating pancreas is also observed in BrdUrd-treated pancreases. The possibility of a specific inhibition by BrdUrd of key metabolic pathways involving uridine, cytidine, or thymidine intermediates was tested. No significant effects on incorporation of precursors into phospholipids, sphingolipids, or glycoproteins were observed. There were also no observed effects of BrdUrd on acetate incorporation into sterols or free fatty acids. The possibility that degradation of BrdUrd via the thymidine or uridine catabolic pathways might produce deleterious metabolites was also tested. Attempts to reverse the BrdUrd effect by normal metabolites were unsuccessful. Furthermore, 5-bromouridine does not produce similar effects to BrdUrd. Among the many compounds tested, only thymidine effectively prevents the inhibitory action of BrdUrd. This inhibition is correlated with a decreased incorporation of BrdUrd into DNA. The fate of labeled BrdUrd in the pancreas cells was followed. The only low molecular weight compounds detected were free BrdUrd, and the mono-, di-, and triphosphates of 5-bromodeoxycytidine and BrdUrd. The great majority of the label rapidly accumulated in DNA. The kinetics of the BrdUrd inhibition, and its reversal suggest a mechanism of action involving a stable molecule such as DNA. The data collectively are consistent with a DNA-linked mechanism of BrdUrd inhibition. The inhibition is not the result of mutagenic action, since it is reversible and no altered proteins can be detected. A mechanism involving an altered binding of regulatory proteins to BrdUrd-containing DNA, and a consequent specific inhibition of the transcription of certain genes is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1554364956,"Abstract Tryptophanyl peptide bonds are oxidatively cleaved by active that is generated with H2O2, iodide, and a peroxidase (donor: H2O2 oxidoreductase, EC 1.11.1.7). Complete oxidation of tryptophan derivatives and peptides to the oxindole occurs within 2 min at pH 3 to 5 with either lactoperoxidase or horseradish peroxidase, and a 2.5-fold molar excess of iodide plus H2O2. Under identical conditions, simple tryptophan peptides are cleaved 30 to 40% in 10 min at pH 5.0, and the rate of cleavage is parallel to, but less than, the rate of oxidation. All three constituents (iodide, H2O2, and peroxidase) are required for oxidation and fission to proceed. Iodinating reagents yield similar results, except that they oxidize tryptophan derivatives and peptides (Z-Trp-X, X-Trp-X) over the pH range of 2 to 11. Fission of the tryptophan peptide proceeds in acid media with a maximum at pH 5.0, and no cleavage occurs in alkaline media. A 2.5-fold molar excess of positive halogen reagents, ICl, iodide oxidized with chloramine-T, and N-iodosuccinimide completely oxidize tryptophan peptides at pH 5.0 within 1 min, whereas oxidation by I2 and I3- is 2 and 8 times slower, respectively. Chloramine-T per se oxidizes tryptophan peptides at about the same rate as I2 below pH 6.5, but is unreactive above this pH. All of the iodinating reagents induce complete oxidation within 1 min at pH 9.5. Thirty to forty percent of a tryptophan peptide (e.g. Z-Trp-Gly or Z-Trp-Leu) is cleaved in 10 min at pH 5 by a 2.5- to 10-fold molar excess of all the reagents, except for I3- which promotes half as much cleavage. With all of the iodinating reagents, the rate of cleavage is parallel to, but less than, the rate of oxidation. Iodimetric titrations and pH profiles suggest that the oxidation and oxidative cleavage of tryptophan peptides during iodination proceeds via the mechanism proposed for brominating agents (Patchornik, A., Lawson, W. B., Gross, E., and Witkop, B. (1960) J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 82, 5923). Two equivalents of I+ or I2 convert the indole nucleus to the oxindole, which undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis after cyclization to the iminolactone. Unlike brominating reagents, a third iodine equivalent does not form a stable iodooxindole derivative with several different tryptophan peptide models or oxindole itself. Two exceptions are Z-Trp-Gly and Z-Trp, which are probably iodinated by ICI on the benzyloxycarbonyl moiety. Free tryptophan is oxidized by 2.6 to 2.9 eq of iodine (ICl or I2), but it does not become iodinated in labeling experiments with 131I2 or 131ICl."

Phenylacetic acid appears to be a major pheromone of the male Mongolian gerbil.
https://openalex.org/W2105256687,"Abstract Light and electron microscopic studies were made on the structures of cells (chondroblasts or chondrocytes) and matrices of developing epiphysial cartilage of 12-day-old chick embryo. Four zones composed of cells with different morphological features were characterized; Zone 1 designated small, round cells; Zone 2, flattened cells; Zone 3 and Zone 4, enlarging cells characterized by an increasing vacuolated cytoplasm. Synthetic activities of DNA, chondroitin sulfate, and collagen were investigated in the different zones by means of radioautographic techniques. The results indicated that a close relation exists between variations of the three synthetic activities and changes in the ultrastructure of cells or in the stage of cytodifferentiation. The chemical nature of the newly synthesized collagens in the different zones was examined to see if any structural heterogeneity may exist in the collagens. Exposure of each zone from the proline-labeled cartilages to 4 m guanidine hydrochloride resulted in the solubilization of more than 80% of the labeled collagen in the zones, there being little difference in the extractability of the labeled collagens among the four zones. The labeled collagens from the four zones showed little change in the degree of hydroxylation of the proline moieties. Further characterization of the collagen samples indicated that all the samples comprised two forms, one corresponding to the known α1(II) chain and the other a precursor form of the α1(II) chain. It was shown from pulse-chase experiments that the precursor form was rapidly converted to α1(II) with a reduction of molecular size: the apparent rates of this conversion increasing gradually in going from Zone 1 to Zone 4."
https://openalex.org/W1548303104,"Abstract Creatine kinase has one tight binding site (Kd = 310 µm) per subunit for 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate with an enhancement of fluorescence of ≃100 and a blue shift of the emission maximum of 30 nm. Nucleotide substrates non-competitively interact with the dye-binding site causing a 50% decrease in the fluorescence of the bound dye and a concomitant red shift of the emission maximum of 7 nm, while guanidino substrates alone do not affect the fluorescence of the bound dye. The fluorescence of the bound dye is used to determine the dissociation constants of nucleotide substrates from the enzyme in the presence or absence of other substrates or effectors, i.e. divalent metal ion or creatine. In the absence of a small planar anion, the presence of creatine or magnesium (or both) have no significant effect on the Kd of ADP from the enzyme, while in the presence of the nitrate anion creatine induces a drastic tightening and a negative cooperativity in the binding of ADP. With MgADP, the tightening of binding and the cooperativity are further accentuated. Modified inactive forms of the enzyme do not show the tightening nor the cooperativity of ADP or MgADP binding. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the small planar anion (e.g. nitrate) is acting as an analog of a planar phosphoryl group, thus mimicking the transition state of the enzyme-substrate complex, and further suggest that two of the distinguishing features of this transition-state complex are a substantial interaction between the two protomeric subunits and the formation of a ligand from the protein to the divalent metal ion."

https://openalex.org/W1489964282,"Abstract Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40), extracted from turtle heart and purified to a specific activity of 210 µmoles of product per min per mg of protein, displays an isoelectric point of 6.05; its divalent cation requirements can be satisfied with Mg2+ or Mn2+, the Michaelis constant for Mg2+ being about 5-fold greater than for Mn2+. K+ or NH4+ can satisfy the requirement for a monovalent cation. Unlike the mammalian enzyme, the turtle heart pyruvate kinase shows an acid pH optimum (pH 6.3 to 6.5), and this property is considered of functional significance during sustained anoxia when intracellular pH drops significantly. Michaelis constants for P-enolpyruvate and ADP are 0.117 and 0.30 mm, respectively, and saturation of the enzyme with either subsubstrate follows hyperbolic kinetics. GDP and IDP can substitute for ADP as phosphate acceptors, both exhibiting sigmoidal saturation kinetics. The maximum velocities obtained with GDP and IDP are about 25% of that observed with ADP. In contrast to the mammalian muscle enzyme, the turtle enzyme is under tight metabolite regulation. It is potently inhibited by ATP, alanine, and phenylalanine, the respective Ki values being 3.7, 0.09, and 0.35 mm. ATP inhibition is noncompetitive with respect to ADP and is mixed competitive with respect to P-enolpyruvate. Alanine and phenylalanine inhibitions are both competitive with respect to P-enolpyruvate. Fructose diphosphate not only reverses, but overrides, all inhibitory effects of ATP, alanine, and phenylalanine. Moreover, fructose diphosphate directly activates turtle heart pyruvate kinase by a large increase in the apparent enzyme-substrate affinity. These effects of fructose diphosphate, coupled with fructose diphosphate control of turtle heart phosphofructokinase (Storey, K. B., and Hochachka, P. W. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 1417– 1422), suggest a particularly pivotal role for this metabolite in glycolytic control of turtle myocardium."
https://openalex.org/W1581391110,"Abstract Some 20-p-tolyl analogs of 20α-hydroxycholesterol and cholesterol have been synthesized and tested as precursors of pregnenolone. As in the previously synthesized t-butyl analog, (20R)-20-t-butyl-5-pregnene-3β,20-diol, C-22 in these synthetic compounds is completely substituted and therefore unavailable for biological hydroxylation (1). (20R)-20-(p-Tolyl)-5-pregnene-3β,20-diol, 1, when incubated with an acetone powder preparation of bovine adrenal mitochondria forms pregnenolone and progesterone in good yield (more than 23%). (20S)-20-(p-Tolyl)-5-pregnen-3β-ol, 2, prepared by Raney nickel hydrogenation of 1, when incubated in a similar fashion yields 1 in large quantity in addition to small amounts of pregnenolone and progesterone. This is the first reported instance of substantial in vitro 20α-hydroxylation of a 22-desoxy substrate, natural or artificial. The styrene 20-(p-tolyl)-5,20-pregnadien-3β-ol, 3, made by dehydration of 1, is not a substrate for side chain cleavage. The results support the previously advanced hypothesis that the true intermediates in the side chain cleavage of cholesterol are reactive complexes of a metalloenzyme and oxygenated steroidal species, and not free hydroxylated compounds. Two reaction mechanisms consistent with these findings are proposed."

https://openalex.org/W1616365933,"Abstract Ethanolamine ammonia-lyase, an enzyme catalyzing the adenosylcobalamin-dependent deamination of ethanolamine, also catalyzes the conversion of l-2-aminopropanol to propionaldehyde and ammonia. In this reaction, tritium is transferred from enzyme·[5'-3H]adenosylcobalamin to the C-1 position of l-2-aminopropanol, as well as to the α carbon of the product aldehyde. The labeling pattern is consistent with the mechanism of hydrogen transfer deduced with other substrates. Tritium transfer also occurs between enzyme·[5'-3H]adenosylcobalamin and propionaldehyde in the presence of NH4+. Unlike the deamination of ethanolamine, the conversion of 2-aminopropanol to propionaldehyde and NH4+ is reversible, since tritiated 2-aminopropanol was isolated from reaction mixtures originally containing only propionaldehyde, ammonia, and enzyme·[5'-3H]adenosyl cobalamin. The partitioning of tritium derived from enzyme·[5'-3H]-adenosylcobalamin between l-2-aminopropanol and propionaldehyde was determined in reactions begun with l-2-aminopropanol as well as in reactions begun with propionaldehyde and ammonia. In the first case, the ratio [3H]propanolamine to [3H]propionaldehyde is 1.8:1; in the second case, the ratio is 0.3:1. This difference in the partitioning of tritium from the tritiated enzyme complex is consistent with the notion that there are at least two intermediates in the catalytic process, each exchanging tritium with coenzyme, which interconvert slowly with respect to the rate of tritium exchange."

https://openalex.org/W1651608476,"Abstract Carbon 13 NMR spectra have been obtained for aqueous solutions of thiamine, thiamine-P, thiamine-PP, and the antivitamins, oxythiamine and pyrithiamine. Earlier assignments of the 6'-and 2-carbon resonances of thiamine are corrected. In contrast to purine and pyrimidine nucleosides, in which the 13C chemical shifts of the ring carbon atoms and the calculated π charge densities roughly follow the empirical (+160 ppm per electron) relationship proposed by Spiesecke and Schneider ((1961) Tetrahedron Lett. 14, 468–476), there is no correlation between the 13C chemical shifts of thiamine and the carbon π charge densities as calculated by Pullman et al. (Pullman, B., and Pullman, A. (1963) Quantum Biochemistry, pp. 636–656, Interscience Publications, New York; Pullman, B., and Spanjaard, C. (1961) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 46, 576–587). Although there is no correlation with the molecule taken as a whole, if one considers the pyrimidine and thiazolium rings separately, there is a correlation. The chemical shifts of the resonances of the carbon atoms of the pyrimidine ring of thiamine correlate well with a line whose slope (+360 ppm per π electron) is similar to the +160 ppm per electron relationship, whereas the resonances of the carbon atoms of the thiazolium ring correlate with a line of negative slope (-160 ppm per electron). The coupling constant J13C-1H for C-2 of the thiazolium rings of thiamine, oxythiamine, and 3,4-dimethyl-5-(2-hydroxyethyl)thiazolium iodide, all of which are about 217 Hz, do not reflect the 25-fold range in kinetic acidity found for position 2 of these compounds. These data suggest that the differences in the kinetic acidity of position 2 of the thiazolium ring of thiamine and some of its analogues is not due to large differences in the hydridization of the C—H bond at this position but rather may result from different electron-withdrawing abilities of substituents attached to N-3."
https://openalex.org/W2092524902,"After incubation at 37°C the subsequent uptake of α-aminoisobutyric acid, cycloleucine, glycine, and L-proline by newborn (as compared to adult) rat kidney cortex slices is enhanced. The effect is abolished by the presence of cycloheximide, actinomycin D, and high concentrations of the above-mentioned amino acids in the medium during the 37°C incubation prior to measurement of uptake. The data suggest that there is an adaptive control mechanism which is expressed on incubation at 37°C and which can regulate amino acid transport in newborn rat kidney cortex."
https://openalex.org/W1539997395,"Abstract Cat hemoglobin has been found to exist in three forms which differ in the cooperativity of oxygen binding at low and high pH values. Type I cat hemoglobin has a high cooperativity (n = 2.7 to 3.1) at both high (pH = 7.8 to 9.0) and low (pH = 6.5 to 6.9) pH values. Type II hemoglobin exhibits low cooperativity (n = 1.8 to 2.3) in the low pH range but high cooperativity in the high pH range. Types I and II have identical p(O2)hb50 values. Cat hemoglobin type III has a low cooperativity in both pH ranges. Results presented indicate that changes in the reactivity of sulfhydryl groups coincide with the difference in cooperativity among the three cat hemoglobin forms. Stored at 4° as a hemolysate, in the oxy form, type I hemoglobin gradually converts to type II and then type III cat hemoglobins. The conversion occurs much more slowly if purified cat hemoglobin is stored in the carbon monoxide form. Type III hemoglobin can be converted to type II hemoglobin by incubation with dithiothreitol. Molar equivalents of p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, 1.4 and 2.4, convert type I to type II and type III, respectively. Ultracentrifuge experiments indicate that the tetramer-dimer subunit dissociation constants of the liganded forms of types I and II of cat hemoglobin are pH-dependent. In addition, liganded cat hemoglobin dissociates about 10 times more readily than any other mammalian hemoglobin investigated. The results are discussed in light of known facts about the structure of cat hemoglobin and applied to an evaluation of the validity of the allosteric model for cooperativity of multi-subunit proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1543980665,"Abstract The inhibition of lysolecithinase by its substrate is further analyzed. A considerable portion of lysolecithin was adsorbed onto particulate or microsomal preparations of rat brain. The adsorbed substrate could be desorbed by isotonic sucrose and, to a greater extent, by serum albumin. The degree of adsorption depended on the quantity of protein and the concentration of lysolecithin. The V/S curves were biphasic, having an ascending portion, an point, and a descending part. When the reaction rates were related to the unadsorbed, rather than the total concentration of the substrate, the inversion point (the substrate concentration at which the peak of the biphasic V/S curve occurs) coincided with the critical micellar concentration of lysolecithin. This supports the hypothesis of Leibovitz-BenGershon et al. ((1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 6840) that the enzyme utilizes molecular solutions of lysolecithin and is inhibited by its micellar aggregates. The substrate also partly inhibited the enzyme at concentrations smaller than the inversion point. Evidence is presented that this is most probably an irreversible inactivation of the enzyme, caused by lysolecithin molecules or micelles which were adsorbed onto the particles or the microsomes. This inhibition could be prevented by premixing the substrate with serum albumin before adding the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1569181311,"Abstract Interaction of β-chloro-l-[14C]alanine with l-aspartate-β-decarboxylase from Alcaligenes faecalis leads to inactivation associated with covalent binding of close to 1 mole of the 3-carbon chain of the analog per mole of active site. Evidence was obtained for two different types of binding. Thus, dialysis of the labeled enzyme against 0.05 m acetate (pH 6) led to loss of about half of the vitamin B6 cofactor without loss of 14C from the enzyme; before and after dialysis, about half of the 14C was released from the carboxyl group of the analog by treatment with ceric sulfate indicating the presence of a bound pyruvate residue. After dialysis of the labeled enzyme against 1 m acetate buffer (pH 5) containing 0.1 m l-glutamate, little additional vitamin B6 was lost (although similar dialysis of the holoenzyme releases all of the cofactor), but about half of the bound 14C was released; the 14C that remained bound to the dialyzed enzyme was not readily released by treatment with ceric sulfate. No evidence for nonidentical subunits was found. The data suggest that the two observed types of 14C-binding result from the aldimine-ketimine equilibrium; hydrolysis of the ketimine followed by loss of pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate at some sites competes with stabilization of the aldimine form by further interaction at other sites. The 14C-labeled enzyme was treated with cyanogen bromide and a labeled peptide was isolated. The label was released as β-hydroxy[14C]pyruvate from the peptide by treatment with mild alkali, 6 n HCl (105°, 18 hours), or on prolonged enzymatic digestion. Ammonolysis of the labeled peptide led to formation of glutamine and release of the label. The data indicate that the labeled derivative is β-hydroxypyruvate bound by ester linkage to a glutamic acid residue at the active center of the enzyme."

A degree of homology is apparent in comparison with the amino acid sequence of the prototype protein of the purple sulfur photosynthetic bacterium, Chromatium vinosum, although the percentage of identical residues is only about 38%. A postulated 4-residue deletion in the T. pfennigii protein which occurs near the 4-iron 4-sulfur chromophore could be readily accommodated in the three-dimensional structure by minor adjustments in the peptide backbone."

https://openalex.org/W1535590935,"Abstract When the lens is removed from the newt Triturus, a new lens will form from epithelial cells of the dorsal iris. DNA was isolated from dorsal irises of animals which had been engaged in lens regeneration for 0, 3, 5, and 7 days. The nitrocellulose affinities of the DNA preparations were: 0-day, 12%; 3-day, 15%; 5-day, 86%; and 7-day, 60%. This suggests that structural alterations occur during the early stages of lens regeneration (and initiation of DNA synthesis). These structural changes can be correlated with the cell cycle. The DNA preparations were characterized by hydroxyapatite chromatography, buoyant density in CsCl and CsSO4(Hg), thermal denaturation, and sedimentation in neutral and alkaline sucrose gradients. The DNA isolated from 0-day regenerates (G0 phase of the cell cycle) behaved as native duplex structures containing few nicks. The DNA from 3-day regenerates (early G1 phase) contained a significant number of nicks. The DNA from 5-day regenerates (late G1 phase) contained gaps or missing runs of nucleotides. The DNA from 7-day regenerates (S phase) existed in two configurations. One possessed a great deal of single-stranded character, and the other was similar, but not identical, to the DNA from 5-day regenerates. These results lead us to suggest that prior to entry into the cell cycle, DNA exists in vivo as chromosomal duplexes which are isolated as structures possessing a maximum charge density. During G1, DNA is activated for replication by a process which at first leads to nicks, then gaps. During replication much of the DNA exists in vivo as an extended structure which is isolated as molecules which possess a great deal of single-stranded character."
https://openalex.org/W1543483101,"Abstract Two major forms of plasminogen can be isolated from the plasmas of several species by affinity chromatography methods. These two forms are easily isolated in high purity from a single small animal, a situation which is particularly suitable for biological investigations. This paper shows that the two forms of rat and rabbit plasminogen must exist as such in the circulating plasma, are not interconvertible, and appear in the plasma at different rates following a single injection of l-[4,5-3H]leucine. Studies on the biological turnover characteristics of each major plasminogen form under homologous and heterologous conditions demonstrate that plasminogen Form 2 from affinity chromatography columns possesses a circulatory half-life which is slightly lower than plasminogen Form 1."
https://openalex.org/W1572374420,"Abstract An enzymically active analogue of semisynthetic ribonuclease-S' (the noncovalent complex of synthetic-(1–15) (corresponding to residues 1 through 15 of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease-A) and native ribonuclease-S-(21–124) (containing residues 21 through 124 of ribonuclease-A)) was prepared with specific carbon 13-enriched glycine in place of the normally occurring alanine at position 6. This material was synthesized in a manner such that half of the molecules contain 13C enrichment only at the carbonyl carbon of glycine 6, while the other half contain enrichment only at the α carbon. Carbon 13 nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) spectroscopic analysis of this ribonuclease-S' analogue, as as well as of the isolated [Gly6-13C0,α]synthetic-(1–15) peptide component of the complex, allow the detection of singlet resonances for both the carbonyl and α carbon atoms in the two states. The chemical shifts of both of these resonances exhibit downfield transitions in going from the isolated, and disordered, synthetic fragment to the folded semisynthetic complex. In addition, the Cα resonance broadens significantly during the folding process, while that for C0 broadens only very little. These chemical shift and line width transitions are interpreted as due to the formation of the ribonuclease-S' NH2-terminal α helix, which includes position 6. Taken together with previous experiments, the results indicate that 13C NMR can be used to monitor helix formation at an individual amino acid locus in proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1517513610,"Abstract Heats of association of lysozyme with N-acetylglucosamine and β-methyl-N-acetylglucosaminide were measured calorimetrically at 0.1 ionic strength and 30° over the pH range 2 to 7. The values found for ΔH0 at pH 5 are -5900 cal per mole for N-acetylglucosamine and -5500 cal per mole for the glycoside. The value of ΔH0 for binding of the glycoside is 1600 cal per mole more positive at acid pH than at neutral pH. The pH dependence of ΔH0 defines an apparent pK of 3.8 for a group in the lysozyme active site. Kinetic studies of the lysozyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of the hexasaccharide of N-acetylglucosamine (Banerjee, S. K., Kregar, I., Turk, V., and Rupley, J. A. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 4786) previously have demonstrated that an ionization that is important for catalysis also exhibits an apparent pK of 3.8 and is assignable to Asp-52. Equilibrium constants for the association of lysozyme with N-acetylglucosamine and the β-methyl glycoside were determined using absorbance measurements over the pH range 0 to 9 at 0.1 ionic strength and 25°. The dependence on pH of the free energy of association for the methyl glycoside indicates that complex formation perturbs two ionizable groups of lysozyme, reducing the apparent pK of one (Asp-66) from 1.5 to 1.2 and increasing the apparent pK of the other (Glu-35) from 6.1 to 6.6. Because of enthalpyentropy compensation, the group of pK 3.8 that is observed in calorimetric experiments with β-methyl-N-acetylglucosaminide is not distinguished by the free energy measurements. The pH dependence of the interaction of N-acetylglucosamine with lysozyme is consistent with perturbation of three ionizable groups through complex formation. Heats of reaction and equilibrium constants for the association of lysozyme with the disaccharides N-acetylglucosaminyl-β(1→4)-glucose and -xylose were determined at 0.1 ionic strength, 30° and pH 2.5 or 5. The enthalpies of association at pH 5 for the disaccharides are -2700 and -500 cal per mole, respectively. The free energies of association are similar to that for N-acetylglucosamine."
https://openalex.org/W2085006935,PAULING1 has suggested that a high intake of vitamin C may be necessary for optimum cerebral function including learning and memory. We have tested this hypothesis in a preliminary way by comparing maze learning in two groups of guinea pigs: those receiving large supplements of ascorbic acid (the ‘control’ group) and those receiving a daily quantity of the vitamin sufficient to maintain a concentration in the brain at approximately 25% that of the controls (the ‘deficient’ group).
