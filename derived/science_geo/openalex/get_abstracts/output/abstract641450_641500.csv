Blowes et al. analyze the global patterns in temporal change in biodiversity using a large quantity of time-series data from different regions (see the Perspective by Eriksson and Hillebrand). Their findings reveal clear spatial patterns in richness and composition change, where marine taxa exhibit the highest rates of change. The marine tropics, in particular, emerge as hotspots of species richness losses. Given that human activities are affecting biodiversity in magnitudes and directions that differ across the planet, these findings will provide a much needed biogeographic understanding of biodiversity change that can help inform conservation prioritization.

Ross et al. mapped the slip sequences during the magnitude 6.4 and 7.1 earthquakes that shook the region. They found that ruptures of a few larger, but many smaller, faults occurred during both earthquakes. The Ridgecrest sequence calls for rethinking seismic hazard, as multifault ruptures are not usually considered when assessing seismic risk. Science , this issue p. 346"

Continuous printing can be done from a fluid bed if a so-called dead layer is used to buffer between the solidified structure and pool of resin. However, printing speeds are limited by the heat buildup from the exothermic polymerization process, thus limiting the ultimate size of the printed object. Walker et al. use a pumped, nonreactive fluorinated oil to act as the dead layer that removes heat during polymerization. This approach allows for both speedup and scale-up of the printing process.

https://openalex.org/W2920934058,"Quantum computation promises applications that are thought to be impossible with classical computation. To realize practical quantum computation, the following three properties will be necessary: universality, scalability, and fault-tolerance. Universality is the ability to execute arbitrary multi-input quantum algorithms. Scalability means that computational resources such as logical qubits can be increased without requiring exponential increase in physical resources. Lastly, fault-tolerance is the ability to perform quantum algorithms in presence of imperfections and noise. A promising approach to scalability was demonstrated with the generation of one-million-mode 1-dimensional cluster state, a resource for one-input computation in measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). The demonstration was based on time-domain multiplexing (TDM) approach using continuous-variable (CV) optical flying qumodes (CV analogue of qubit). Demonstrating universality, however, has been a challenging task for any physical system and approach. Here, we present, for the first time among any physical system, experimental realization of a scalable resource state for universal MBQC: a 2-dimensional cluster state. We also prove the universality and give the methodology for utilizing this state in MBQC. Our state is based on TDM approach that allows unlimited resource generation regardless of the coherence time of the system. As a demonstration of our method, we generate and verify a 2-dimensional cluster state capable of about 5,000 operation steps on 5 inputs."

We propose and demonstrate a scalable scheme for the generation of photonic cluster states suitable for universal measurement-based quantum computation. We exploit temporal multiplexing of squeezed light modes, delay loops, and beam-splitter transformations to deterministically generate a cylindrical cluster state with a two-dimensional (2D) topological structure as required for universal quantum information processing. The generated state consists of more than 30000 entangled modes arranged in a cylindrical lattice with 24 modes on the circumference, defining the input register, and a length of 1250 modes, defining the computation depth. Our demonstrated source of 2D cluster states can be combined with quantum error correction to enable fault-tolerant quantum computation."

To reveal the mechanism of water oxidation, we analyzed structures of PSII in the S1, S2, and S3 states by x-ray free-electron laser serial crystallography. No insertion of water was found in S2, but flipping of D1 Glu189 upon transition to S3 leads to the opening of a water channel and provides a space for incorporation of an additional oxygen ligand, resulting in an open cubane Mn4CaO6 cluster with an oxyl/oxo bridge. Structural changes of PSII between the different S states reveal cooperative action of substrate water access, proton release, and dioxygen formation in photosynthetic water oxidation."

But what if you already have the compound you want, stuck in a mixture of left- and right-handed enantiomers? Shin et al. now show that light-induced electron transfer can trigger a favorable succession of proton and hydrogen-atom transfer steps, both of which are susceptible to biasing by catalysts, to preferentially convert a mixture of cyclic urea enantiomers into just one (see the Perspective by Wendlandt).

https://openalex.org/W2980718989,"Origins of collective contraction In contrast to plants and fungi, animals can deform their bodies by the collective activity of contractile cells. Collective contractility underlies processes such as gastrulation and muscle-based motility. Brunet et al. report that a close relative of animals, a choanoflagellate they name Choanoeca flexa , forms cup-shaped colonies that undergo collective contractility, leading to a rapid change in colony morphology (see the Perspective by Tomancak). C. flexa colonies are each composed of a monolayer of polarized cells. In response to sudden darkness, a light-sensing protein triggers coordinated, polarized contraction of C. flexa cells, which results in colony inversion. The cellular mechanisms underlying this process are conserved between C. flexa and animals, indicating that their last common ancestor was also capable of polarized cell contraction.

Different minerals form at different f O 2 and have different physical properties, so the internal structure of an exoplanet depends on this value. Doyle et al. exploited the signature left behind when rocky bodies impact a white dwarf—the remnant of a dead star. By examining the rock-forming elements left on the surface of each white dwarf, they determine f O 2 in the impacting body. Six systems all had similar f O 2 to bodies in the Solar System, consistent with the idea that rocky exoplanets often have internal properties similar to those of Earth and Mars.

However, upon closer examination, single neuronal action potentials can be detected during delta waves. Todorova and Zugaro sought to determine whether this neuronal noise could instead be an important signal (see the Perspective by Ikegaya and Matsumoto). They found that persisting action potential firing during delta waves is an overlooked but widespread phenomenon, which could potentially involve all neurons and all delta waves. A critical role of the delta wave may be to insulate specific cortical computations taking place in response to hippocampal replay and involved in memory consolidation.

https://openalex.org/W2980636857,"Copy number variants (CNVs) are subject to stronger selective pressure than single-nucleotide variants, but their roles in archaic introgression and adaptation have not been systematically investigated. We show that stratified CNVs are significantly associated with signatures of positive selection in Melanesians and provide evidence for adaptive introgression of large CNVs at chromosomes 16p11.2 and 8p21.3 from Denisovans and Neanderthals, respectively. Using long-read sequence data, we reconstruct the structure and complex evolutionary history of these polymorphisms and show that both encode positively selected genes absent from most human populations. Our results collectively suggest that large CNVs originating in archaic hominins and introgressed into modern humans have played an important role in local population adaptation and represent an insufficiently studied source of large-scale genetic variation."

https://openalex.org/W2980631310,"The Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) transcription factor is highly expressed in basal type breast cancer and promotes breast cancer cell proliferation, survival, migration, and tumorigenesis. KLF5 protein stability is regulated by ubiquitination. In this study, ubiquitin-specific protease 3 (USP3) was identified as a new KLF5 deubiquitinase by genome-wide siRNA library screening. We demonstrated that USP3 interacts with KLF5 and stabilizes KLF5 via deubiquitination. USP3 knockdown inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo, which can be partially rescued by ectopic expression of KLF5. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between USP3 and KLF5 protein expression levels in human breast cancer samples. These findings suggest that USP3 is a new KLF5 deubiquitinase and that USP3 may represent a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer."

Women in the adalimumab-exposed cohort had received at least one dose of the drug in the first trimester for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's Disease (N = 257). Women in the disease comparison cohort had not used adalimumab in pregnancy (N = 120). Women in the healthy comparison cohort had no rheumatic or inflammatory bowel diseases (N = 225). Women and their infants were followed to one year postpartum with maternal interviews, medical records abstraction, and physical examinations. Study outcomes were major structural birth defects, minor defects, spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery, pre and post-natal growth deficiency, serious or opportunistic infections and malignancies. 42/602 (7.0%) of pregnancies were lost-to-follow-up. 22/221 (10.0%) in the adalimumab-exposed cohort had a live born infant with a major birth defect compared to 8/106 (7.5%) in the diseased unexposed cohort (adjusted odds ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45 to 2.73). Women in the adalimumab-exposed cohort were more likely to deliver preterm compared to the healthy cohort (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.59, 95% CI 1.22 to 5.50), but not compared to the diseased unexposed cohort (aHR 0.82, 95% CI 0.66 to 7.20). No significant increased risks were noted with adalimumab exposure for any other study outcomes.Adalimumab exposure in pregnancy compared to diseased unexposed pregnancies was not associated with an increased risk for any of the adverse outcomes examined. Women with rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's Disease were at increased risk of preterm delivery, irrespective of adalimumab exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2980339510,"Myocardial infarction (MI) is a major contributor to death and disability throughout the world. Increasing evidence shows that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the progression of MI. Here, we hypothesized that lncRNA potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily q member 1 overlapping transcript 1 (KCNQ1OT1) could affect the development of MI via regulation of Runt-related transcription factor (RUNX)3 by methylation. Initially, by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery, an acute MI (AMI) mouse model was established to collect the cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs), which revealed a high KCNQ1OT1 expression and a low RUNX3 expression with its high methylation. After that, KCNQ1OT1 knockdown or RUNX3 overexpression were transduced into the CMECs in order to detect their role in CMEC proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammatory response. Moreover, we assessed their interaction with the inflammatory Notch pathway, by determining the expression of Jagged 1, Hey1, Hes1, Notch intracellular domain, and Notch1. It was observed that after KCNQ1OT1 knockdown, the proliferation of AMI-CMECs was promoted, whereas their apoptosis was inhibited, accompanied by reduced level of inflammatory factors. These trends could also be achieved by RUNX3 overexpression via the Notch pathway. Finally, the regulation of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)1-dependent methylation in RUNX3 by KCNQ1OT1 was determined, suggesting that KCNQ1OT1 could result in down-regulated RUNX3 expression through promoted RUNX3 methylation caused by recruiting DNMT1. Overall, this study demonstrates that KCNQ1OT1 silencing inhibits RUNX3 methylation, thereby offering protection against CMEC injury and inflammatory response in AMI, which may serve as a promising target for the disease treatment. -Wang, Y., Yang, X., Jiang, A., Wang, W., Li, J., Wen, J.

Therefore, we decided to investigate this phenomenon with new biochemical tools that have become available since the previous experimental studies on the subject nearly 3 decades ago. In transcription-coupled repair, damage in the template (transcribed strand (TS)), but not the nontranscribed strand (NTS), causes arrest of RNA polymerase (RNAP). The arrested RNAP is recognized by Mfd in E. coli (15Selby C.P. Sancar A.

In contrast, TCR is not well-understood in higher organisms. The mechanism is unlike that in E. coli, because the CSB translocase does not remove the stalled RNAP (18Selby C.P. Sancar A.

Genomic DNA is isolated and digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, and then duplicate aliquots from each time point are incubated with or without T4 endonuclease V, which incises sites of CPDs. Following separation of the DNA on a denaturing agarose gel, the gel is probed with gene-specific and strand-specific probes. The level of damage at each time point is calculated from the decrease in full-length fragment caused by T4 endonuclease. The loss of damage with time represents repair. Although this method has served to characterize essential properties of strand-specific repair, by its very nature, it is low-resolution and has the potential of missing TCR because it is an indirect method that is based on subtracting two large numbers from one another and because it is limited to analyzing one gene at a time. In contrast, the recently developed XR-Seq (excision repair-sequencing) assay directly captures and identifies the excised oligomers, and thus it directly and simultaneously measures repair throughout the genome (4Hu J. Li W. Adebali O. Yang Y. Oztas O. Selby C.P. Sancar A. Genome-wide mapping of nucleotide excision repair with XR-seq.Nat.

Using XR-Seq, we find that Drosophila is proficient at TCR despite the previous reports and the absence of CSA and CSB in this organism. Drosophila S2 cells were irradiated with 20 J m−2 of 254-nm UV light and incubated for various times at 27 °C. Then cells were lysed, and the low-molecular weight DNA was separated from genomic DNA by the Hirt procedure (4Hu J. Li W. Adebali O. Yang Y. Oztas O. Selby C.P. Sancar A.

After immunoprecipitation with anti-CPD antibodies, the samples were mixed with an internal control 50-mer DNA oligonucleotide, 3′-end–labeled, and separated on a sequencing gel. As seen in Fig. 1A, excision products in the range of 24–30 nt were detected with a median of 27–28 nt. Irradiated S2 cells were also processed for XR-Seq, in which the excision products are isolated, repaired by CPD photolyase, sequenced by next-generation sequencing (NGS), and aligned to the genome to create a map of the entire genome showing sites of repair in both strands at single-nucleotide resolution. The lengths of excision products sequenced (reads) after 10 min of repair were recovered with the frequency distribution shown in Fig. 1B, which shows a peak at 27 and 28 nt, in agreement with Fig. 1A results. Reads for products 26, 27, 28, and 29 nt in length were individually analyzed for nucleotide distribution as shown in Fig. 1C. The results show enrichment of pyrimidines 7–9 nt from the 3′-end. Thymines are more common than cytosines, consistent with the prevalence of cyclobutane thymine dimer photoproducts produced by UV. Thus, the location of the dual incisions made by the excision nuclease with respect to the CPD in S2 cells is essentially the same as in humans (3Sancar A. Mechanisms of DNA repair by photolyase and excision nuclease (Nobel Lecture).Angew Chem. Int. Ed.

This finding is not surprising, considering that Drosophila possesses the complete set of orthologs to the basal excision repair factors present in mammals (5Sekelsky J.

It is worth noting that in human cells, it has been shown that the same excision pattern is produced by the transcription-coupled and global repair pathways (20Hu J. Adar S. Selby C.P. Lieb J.D.

As repair progresses, two populations of excision products, one ranging from 24 to 32 nt and centering at 26–27 nt and a second in the range of 15–20 nt and centering at 17–18 nt, are observed. These products as produced in NHF1 cells are illustrated in Fig. 2A. The 15–20-nt degradation products can be seen even at the earliest time point of 30 min and become prominent at 2 h. Thereafter, both the primary and secondary excision products detectable by radiolabeling decline, presumably due to low recovery and labeling efficiency of smaller degraded CPD-containing oligonucleotides (not shown). A comparison of the fate of excised oligomers in human and Drosophila cells (Fig. 2B) reveals an interesting contrast; in S2 cells, no degradation products are detectable in the first 2 h and, in fact, up to at least 12 h (data not shown). This indicates that Drosophila either lacks a nuclease that is present in organisms ranging from yeast to Arabidopsis to humans and that generates a similar degradation pattern in all of these other species, or this degradation intermediate is not stabilized in Drosophila as it is in other organisms. Previous work using strand-specific Southern hybridization did not detect a difference in the rates of repair of TS and NTS in individual Drosophila genes (6de Cock J.G. Klink E.C. Ferro W.

This notion was further strengthened by genome analyses, which revealed that Drosophila and other Dipteran insects lacked CSA and CSB (5Sekelsky J.

However, it was also pointed out that in the absence of TCR, RNAPII stalled at damage sites in the TS would be expected to interfere with excision repair, as has been shown in E. coli (26Selby C.P.

To clarify these conflicting observations and theoretical expectations, we analyzed our XR-Seq data from S2 cells to obtain a global view of strand-specific repair of the Drosophila genome. From our genomic repair maps of Drosophila, we initially focused on the betaTub60D and ade3 genes for TCR analysis because the lack of strand-specific repair in these genes, as determined by Southern blotting, was considered definitive evidence for lack of TCR in Drosophila (6de Cock J.G. Klink E.C. Ferro W. Lohman P.H. Eeken J.C.

Fig. 3A shows screenshots of repair of the betaTub60D and ade3 genes in Drosophila as well as the human orthologues of these genes (TUBB3 and GART, respectively) in NHF1 and CSB cells, and Fig. 3B shows quantitative analysis of the TS and NTS repair of these genes. As is visually apparent from the screenshots, the TS of betaTub60D is repaired more efficiently than the NTS. A similar result is seen with repair of ade3. The quantitative data for TS and NTS reads in Fig. 3B clearly show that Drosophila performs TCR similar in magnitude to that seen in NHF1 human cells. A gene-by-gene survey of the genomic repair map (not shown) reveals varied levels of TCR in many but not all Drosophila genes, presumably reflecting varied levels or absence of transcription. For comparative purposes, Fig. 3 shows a screenshot and quantitation of repair for a Drosophila gene, CG10348, in which TCR is essentially absent. Interestingly, in CSB cells (Fig. 3), there is not only a lack of TCR, but a preferential repair of the NTS in both the TUBB3 and GART genes. This result parallels the preferred NTS repair seen in E. coli cells lacking the TCR factor Mfd (27Adebali O. Chiou Y.Y. Hu J. Sancar A. Selby C.P. Genome-wide transcription-coupled repair in Escherichia coli is mediated by the Mfd translocase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2017; 114 (10.1073/pnas.1700230114, 28167766): E2116-E2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This result in CSB cells is consistent with inhibition of repair by the stalled polymerase and merits more systematic investigation. To examine TCR in a large sample of Drosophila genes, we analyzed the CPD repair of all nonoverlapping genes over 1 kbp (5,706 genes). The results are shown in Fig. 4A, with results for different repair time points for S2 cells in the top row, and corresponding time points for NHF1 cells (10,100 genes over 5 kbp) in the row below. Each panel illustrates the averaged repair from the transcription start site (TSS) to the transcription end site (TES) for all of the genes considered, plus the average repair 2 kbp upstream and downstream. As is clear from this figure, in both species, TCR across the gene bodies appears to have begun by 10 min, and TS repair is dominant at 30–36 min. The magnitudes of TCR in human and Drosophila cell lines are at comparable levels. At later time points, after the TS is cleared of damage, the preference shifts to the NTS strand. It takes longer to clear TS damage (over 8 h) in human cells, probably due to longer genes in humans. The robust TCR signal exhibited by S2 cells, which lack CS proteins, contrasts starkly with the complete absence of TCR in mutant human CSB cells, which are compared with NHF1 cells in Fig. 4B. In fact, the CSB cells exhibit a trend toward preferential NTS repair, as seen in the individual TUBB3 and GART genes (Fig. 3). An interesting difference between the human and Drosophila repair profiles is seen in Fig. 4. As reported previously for NHF1 cells (20Hu J. Adar S. Selby C.P. Lieb J.D. Sancar A. Genome-wide analysis of human global and transcription-coupled excision repair of UV damage at single-nucleotide resolution.Genes Dev. 2015; 29 (10.1101/gad.261271.115, 25934506): 948-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and seen here at the 36-min and 1-h time points, there is a switch in strand preference for repair, from TS within the gene body to the NTS immediately upstream of the TSS. This is because of the well-known fact that upstream of the mammalian TSS, there is promoter- and enhancer-specific transcription “antisense” relative to the gene body (28Core L.J. Martins A.L. Danko C.G. Waters C.T. Siepel A. Lis J.T. Analysis of nascent RNA identifies a unified architecture of initiation regions at mammalian promoters and enhancers.Nat. Genet. 2014; 46 (10.1038/ng.3142, 25383968): 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). These “antisense” transcripts are not found in Arabidopsis (24Oztas O. Selby C.P. Sancar A. Adebali O. Genome-wide excision repair in Arabidopsis is coupled to transcription and reflects circadian gene expression patterns.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 (10.1038/s41467-018-03922-5, 29666379): 1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and our data suggest that they are absent in Drosophila as well. Instead, a dip in repair of both strands is observed immediately upstream of the TSS in Drosophila, presumably because of interference by transcription factors bound immediately upstream of coding sequences. Contrary to the view held for nearly 3 decades, we show that Drosophila performs TCR. In fact, the magnitude of the TS/NTS repair ratio in transcribed genes is comparable to the ratios of corresponding genes in human cells. We ascribe the previous failure to observe TCR in Drosophila partly to the limitation of the T4 endonuclease V digestion/Southern assay used in previous studies. An important additional consideration is the particular time points at which repair was analyzed. The earliest repair time point commonly used in the previous studies was 4 h post-UV treatment (6de Cock J.G. Klink E.C. Ferro W. Lohman P.H. Eeken J.C.

TCR may be detected in mammalian cells following 4 h of repair (Fig. 4); however, in yeast, which have much smaller genes, TCR is complete within 1 h (22Li W. Adebali O. Yang Y. Selby C.P. Sancar A. Single-nucleotide resolution dynamic repair maps of UV damage in Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2018; 115 (10.1073/pnas.1801687115, 29581276): E3408-E3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It appears that a similar rapid kinetic profile in Drosophila, which also has relatively small genes, likely contributes to the discrepancy between our findings and previous studies. Our finding of TCR in Drosophila raises a new question: analysis of the Drosophila genome and the genomes of other Dipteran insects has failed to reveal CSA, CSB, or UVSSA orthologs, which are known to be essential for TCR in organisms ranging from plants to humans. The E. coli TCR factor Mfd, which has a different evolutionary history than CSB, exhibits considerable sequence homology in the ATPase/translocase domain of the protein. It is possible that another translocase with great sequence divergence from all known TCR translocases couples transcription to repair upon the encounter of RNAP with a transcription-blocking DNA lesion in Drosophila. In fact, in Caenorhabditis elegans, other chromatin-remodeling factors have been suggested to function in place of CSB for TCR during certain developmental stages (29Lans H. Marteijn J.A. Schumacher B. Hoeijmakers J.H. Jansen G. Vermeulen W. Involvement of global genome repair, transcription coupled repair, and chromatin remodeling in UV DNA damage response changes during development.PLoS Genet. 2010; 6 (10.1371/journal.pgen.1000941, 20463888): e1000941Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). There is a need for further work to identify such potential transcription-coupled repair factors in Drosophila. A passive mechanism for TCR has been suggested in which the stalled RNAPII reveals to the basal repair factors lesions that would otherwise be concealed by nucleosomes. This mechanism is based partly upon observations of inhibition of repair by nucleosomes, seen in vitro (30Hara R. Mo J. Sancar A. DNA damage in the nucleosome core is refractory to repair by human excision nuclease.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20 (10.1128/MCB.20.24.9173-9181.2000, 11094069): 9173-9181Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and repair of transcription-blocking lesions unimpeded by the presence of the stalled RNAPII, also seen in vitro (11Venema J. van Hoffen A.

This particular model as related to Drosophila is attractive in its independence of CS proteins. Further work is needed to clarify the involvement of CS proteins in TCR as well as in the developmental deficiencies associated with Cockayne syndrome (34Brooks P.J. Blinded by the UV light: how the focus on transcription-coupled NER has distracted from understanding the mechanisms of Cockayne syndrome neurologic disease.DNA Repair. 2013; 12 (10.1016/j.dnarep.2013.04.018, 23683874): 656-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). S2-DGRC cells were obtained from the Drosophila Genetic Resources Center. Cells were cultured at 27 °C in Schneider’s medium with heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 10% (v/v). For UV treatments, cells were inoculated into R-150 plates and grown to about 25–80% confluence. Medium was gently removed from the semi-adherent monolayer, cells were irradiated with UV-C, and then fresh medium containing sterilized, conditioned medium was added to cells, and cells were incubated at 27 ºC. Excision assays employed 20 J m−2 (Fig. 1) or 10 J m−2 (Fig. 2), and XR-Seq assays employed 20 J m−2. Following predetermined repair times, plates were placed on ice, and cooled cells were harvested by scraping and rinsing with ice-cold PBS. Cells were pelleted, transferred to Eppendorf tubes, washed with cold PBS, and resuspended in 320–340 μl of cold TE. Samples were processed for excision and XR-Seq assays as described (27Adebali O. Chiou Y.Y. Hu J. Sancar A. Selby C.P. Genome-wide transcription-coupled repair in Escherichia coli is mediated by the Mfd translocase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

For both assays, samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-CPD antibody and then either radiolabeled (excision assay) or ligated to adapters and processed for sequencing (XR-Seq). Approximately 13% of the input CPD-containing excision products are recovered using this standard excision assay/XR-Seq immunoprecipitation procedure. One plate of S2 cells per repair time point was sufficient for excision or XR-Seq assay. Drosophila possesses photolyases, so cells were kept in the dark or under dim yellow illumination from the time of irradiation to the time of addition of NaCl to cell lysates. XR-Seq of NHF1 (normal human fibroblast) cells was performed as described previously (4Hu J. Li W. Adebali O. Yang Y. Oztas O. Selby C.P. Sancar A.

XR-Seq analysis of CSB cell repair utilized data deposited in a prior study (20Hu J. Adar S. Selby C.P. Lieb J.D. Sancar A.

At least 6 million unique mapped reads were obtained for each sample. Analysis of sequencing reads and data visualization were as described previously (35Yang Y. Adebali O. Wu G. Selby C.P.

The alignment genome version was dm6_UCSC for S2 cells and hg38_UCSC for human cell lines. For plotting average repair profiles as a unit gene, we chose the genes with length >1 kbp for Drosophila and >5 kbp for Homo sapiens, and the distance between genes was at least 100 bp for Drosophila and 5 kbp for Homo sapiens. With these criteria, the total number of genes selected was 5,706 for Drosophila and 10,100 for Homo sapiens.

https://openalex.org/W2980938589,"In-stent restenosis remains a major problem of arteriosclerosis treatment by stenting. Expansion-optimized stents could reduce this problem. With numerical simulations, stent designs/ expansion behaviours can be effectively analyzed. For reasons of efficiency, simplified models of balloon-expandable stents are often used, but their accuracy must be challenged due to insufficient experimental validation. In this work, a realistic stent life-cycle simulation has been performed including balloon folding, stent crimping and free expansion of the balloon-stent-system. The successful simulation and validation of two stent designs with homogenous and heterogeneous stent stiffness and an asymmetrically positioned stent on the balloon catheter confirm the universal applicability of the simulation approach. Dogboning ratio, as well as the final dimensions of the folded balloon, the crimped and expanded stent, correspond well to the experimental dimensions with only slight deviations. In contrast to the detailed stent life-cycle simulation, a displacement-controlled simulation can not predict the transient stent expansion, but is suitable to reproduce the final expanded stent shape and the associated stress states. The detailed stent life-cycle simulation is thus essential for stent expansion analysis/optimization, whereas for reasons of computational efficiency, the displacement-controlled approach can be considered in the context of pure stress analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2980499379,"To persist when nutrient sources are limited, aerobic soil bacteria metabolize atmospheric hydrogen (H2). This process is the primary sink in the global H2 cycle and supports the productivity of microbes in oligotrophic environments. H2-metabolizing bacteria possess [NiFe] hydrogenases that oxidize H2 to subatmospheric concentrations. The soil saprophyte Mycobacterium smegmatis has two such [NiFe] hydrogenases, designated Huc and Hhy, that belong to different phylogenetic subgroups. Both Huc and Hhy are oxygen-tolerant, oxidize H2 to subatmospheric concentrations, and enhance bacterial survival during hypoxia and carbon limitation. Why does M. smegmatis require two hydrogenases with a seemingly similar function? In this work, we resolved this question by showing that Huc and Hhy are differentially expressed, localized, and integrated into the respiratory chain. Huc is active in late exponential and early stationary phases, supporting energy conservation during mixotrophic growth and transition into dormancy. In contrast, Hhy is most active during long-term persistence, providing energy for maintenance processes following carbon exhaustion. We also show that Huc and Hhy are obligately linked to the aerobic respiratory chain via the menaquinone pool and are differentially affected by respiratory uncouplers. Consistently, these two enzymes interacted differentially with the respiratory terminal oxidases. Huc exclusively donated electrons to, and possibly physically associated with, the proton-pumping cytochrome bcc–aa3 supercomplex. In contrast the more promiscuous Hhy also provided electrons to the cytochrome bd oxidase complex. These results indicate that, despite their similar characteristics, Huc and Hhy perform distinct functions during mycobacterial growth and survival."
https://openalex.org/W2980951331,"Background Naloxone is a life-saving antidote for opioid overdoses. In June 2016, the Ontario government implemented the Ontario Naloxone Program for Pharmacies (ONPP) to enhance access to naloxone. Objective We examined the initial uptake of naloxone through the ONPP and characteristics of the individuals receiving and pharmacies dispensing naloxone kits. Methods We conducted a population-based study of all Ontario residents who received a naloxone kit between July 1, 2016 and March 31, 2018. This involved 1) a cross-sectional analysis of monthly rates of kits dispensed; and 2) a descriptive analysis of all individuals and pharmacies who accessed and dispensed naloxone, respectively. We stratified individuals according to their opioid exposure as: prescription opioid agonist therapy (OAT) recipients, prescription opioid recipients, those with past opioid exposure and those with no/unknown opioid exposure. We calculated a Lorenz curve comparing the cumulative percent of naloxone-dispensing pharmacies and cumulative percent of naloxone kits dispensed and the corresponding Gini coefficient. Results Naloxone dispensing through the ONPP increased considerably from 1.9 to 54.3 kits per 100,000 residents over the study period. In this time, 2,729 community pharmacies dispensed 91,069 kits to 67,910 unique individuals. Uptake was highest among prescription OAT recipients (40.7% of OAT recipients dispensed at least one kit), compared with 1.6% of prescription opioid recipients, 1.0% of those with past opioid exposure and 0.3% with no/unknown opioid exposure. Naloxone dispensing was highly clustered among pharmacies (Gini = 0.78), with 55.6% of Ontario pharmacies dispensing naloxone, and one-third (33.7%) of kits dispensed by the top 1.0% of naloxone-dispensing pharmacies. Conclusion The ONPP launch led to a rapid increase in the number of naloxone kits dispensed in Ontario. Although the program successfully engaged people prescribed OAT, efforts to increase uptake among others at risk of opioid overdose appear warranted. Opportunities for expanding pharmacy participation should be identified and pursued."
https://openalex.org/W2981225245,"Controlled inflammatory responses of myeloid cells recruited to wounds are essential for effective repair. In diabetes, the inflammatory response is prolonged and augmented over time, with increased myeloid cells present in the wound that fail to switch from a pro-inflammatory phenotype to a pro-healing phenotype. These defects lead to delayed angiogenesis and tissue repair and regeneration, and contribute to chronic wound formation. In mouse models of diabetes, this aberrant phenotype is partially mediated by stable intrinsic changes to the developing myeloid cells in the bone marrow, affecting their maturation and polarization potential. Previous studies have shown that freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from diabetic patients are more inflammatory than non-diabetic counterparts. However, the phenotype of macrophages from human diabetic patients has not been well characterized. Here we show that diabetic-derived human macrophages cultured for 6 days in vitro maintain a pro-inflammatory priming and hyperpolarize to a pro-inflammatory phenotype when stimulated with LPS and INF-ɣ or TNF. In addition, diabetic-derived macrophages show maturation defects associated with reduced expression of the RUNX1 transcription factor that promotes myeloid cell development. Targeting intrinsic defects in myeloid cells by protein transduction of the Hoxa3 transcription factor can rescue some inflammation and maturation defects in human macrophages from diabetic patients via upregulation of Runx1. In addition, Hoxa3 can modulate the levels of p65/NF-κB and histone acetyltransferase and deacetylase activity, as well as inhibit acetylation of the TNF promoter. Altogether, these results show a link between myeloid cell maturation and inflammatory responses, and that diabetes induces intrinsic changes to human myeloid cells that are maintained over time, as well as potentially therapeutic Hoxa3-mediated mechanisms of controlling the inflammatory response in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2981280245,"Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a prevalent spinal deformity occurring during peripubertal growth period that affects 1-4% of adolescents globally without clear etiopathogenetic mechanism. Low bone mineral density is an independent and significant prognostic factor for curve progression. Currently, the cause underlying low bone mass in AIS remains elusive. Osteocytes play an important role in bone metabolism and mineral homeostasis, but its role in AIS has not been studied. In the present study, iliac bone tissues were harvested from 21 patients with AIS (mean age of 14.3 ± 2.20 yr old) with a mean Cobb angle of 55.6 ± 10.61° and 13 non-AIS controls (mean age of 16.5 ± 4.79 yr old) intraoperatively. Acid-etched scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of AIS demonstrated abnormal osteocytes that were more rounded and cobblestone-like in shape and were aligned in irregular clusters with shorter and disorganized canaliculi. Further quantitative analysis with FITC-Imaris technique showed a significant reduction in the canalicular number and length as well as an increase in lacunar volume and area in AIS. SEM with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis demonstrated a lower calcium-to-phosphorus ratio at the perilacunar/canalicular region. Moreover, microindentaion results revealed lower values of Vickers hardness and elastic modulus in AIS when compared with controls. In addition, in the parallel study of 99 AIS (27 with severe Cobb angle of 65.8 ± 14.1° and 72 with mild Cobb angle of 26.6 ± 9.1°) with different curve severity, the serum osteocalcin level was found to be significantly and negatively associated with the Cobb angle. In summary, the findings in this series of studies demonstrated the potential link of abnormal osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network structure and function to the observed abnormal bone mineralization in AIS, which may shed light on etiopathogenesis of AIS.-Chen, H., Zhang, J., Wang, Y., Cheuk, K.-Y., Hung, A. L. H., Lam, T.-P., Qiu, Y., Feng, J. Q., Lee, W. Y. W., Cheng, J. C. Y.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone BiP, the sole HSP70 chaperone in the ER, is regulated by HSP40 chaperones, including ER-resident protein ERdj3 (DNAJB11). ERdj3 lacks an ER retrieval signal, is secreted under ER stress conditions, and functions as a chaperone in the extracellular space, but how its secretion is regulated remains unclear. We recently showed that ERdj3 forms a complex with ER-resident stromal cell–derived factor 2 (SDF2) and SDF2L1 (SDF2-like protein 1) and thereby prevents protein aggregation during the BiP chaperone cycle. However, the contribution of the ERdj3-SDF2L1 complex to protein quality control is poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the intracellular localization and chaperone activity of ERdj3 in complex with SDF2L1. We found that ERdj3 was retained in the ER by associating with SDF2/SDF2L1. In vitro analyses revealed that the ERdj3 dimer incorporated two SDF2L1 molecules; otherwise, ERdj3 alone formed a homotetramer. The ERdj3-SDF2L1 complex suppressed ER protein aggregation, and this suppression did not require substrate transfer to BiP. The ERdj3-SDF2L1 complex inhibited aggregation of denatured GSH S-transferase (GST) in vitro and maintained GST in a soluble oligomeric state. Both in cellulo and in vitro, the chaperone activities of the ERdj3-SDF2L1 complex were higher than those of ERdj3 alone. These findings suggest that, under normal conditions, ERdj3 functions as an ER chaperone in complex with SDF2/SDF2L1 but is secreted into the extracellular space when it cannot form this complex.

However, it is unclear how the ERdj3-SDF2L1 complex contributes to ER homeostasis, and little is known about the biological function of SDF2 and SDF2L1. In this study, we analyzed the chaperone activity of the ERdj3-SDF2L1 complex both in cellulo and in vitro and found that SDF2L1 promotes the chaperone activity of ERdj3, which inhibits protein aggregation. We also showed that SDF2 and SDF2L1 are required for ER localization of ERdj3 under physiological conditions. Our results indicate that SDF2 and SDF2L1 regulate the intracellular localization of ERdj3 and that ERdj3 retained in the ER acquires elevated chaperone activity by forming a complex with SDF2 or SDF2L1. κ LC is a misfolding-prone protein with a partially folded structure (6Skowronek M.H.

In the absence of Ig heavy chain, κ LC is retained in the ER in association with BiP (6Skowronek M.H. Hendershot L.M. Haas I.G. The variable domain of nonassembled Ig light chains determines both their half-life and binding to the chaperone BiP.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, when proteasome function is abrogated, κ LC is retained in the ER for a prolonged period (31Chillarón J. Haas I.G. Dissociation from BiP and retrotranslocation of unassembled immunoglobulin light chains are tightly coupled to proteasome activity.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11 (10637303): 217-22610.1091/mbc.11.1.217Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We predicted that κ LC retained in the ER would form aggregates. To test this idea, we treated HEK293 cells expressing κ LC with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, and separated 1% NP-40–soluble (S) and –insoluble (P) fractions. In control cells, about half of κ LC was recovered in the pellet fraction, but the proportion of protein in the pellet was greatly decreased by overexpression of BiP (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 1 and 2, quantified in B). Thus, chaperone activity in the ER can be assessed based on the reduction in κ LC aggregation. Using this assay, we compared the impact of the ERdj3-SDF2L1 complex with that of ERdj3 or SDF2L1 expressed alone in HEK293 cells. ERdj3 or SDF2L1 alone did not affect the P/S ratio of κ LC, whereas the ERdj3-SDF2L1 complex decreased the amount of κ LC in the pellet fraction to a similar extent as BiP (Fig. 1A, lanes 5–10, quantified in B). These results suggest that the ERdj3-SDF2L1 complex has strong chaperone activity, comparable with that of BiP, in cellulo. Furthermore, even in the absence of MG132, knockdown of both endogenous SDF2 and SDF2L1, but not that of ERdj3, increased the amount of κ LC in the pellet fraction (Fig. S1), supporting the importance of the ERdj3-SDF2L1 complex. We next examined the effect of the ERdj3-SDF2L1 complex on terminally misfolded NHK-QQQ (nonglycosylated α1-antitrypsin, null Hong Kong variant) (32Sifers R.N. Brashears-Macatee S. Kidd V.J.

In control cells, approximately half of NHK-QQQ accumulated in the 1% NP-40–insoluble fraction in the absence of proteasome inhibitor (25Fujimori T. Suno R. Iemura S.I. Natsume T. Wada I. Hosokawa N. Endoplasmic reticulum proteins SDF2 and SDF2L1 act as components of the BiP chaperone cycle to prevent protein aggregation.Genes Cells. 2017; 22 (28597544): 684-69810.1111/gtc.12506Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and this proportion was significantly decreased by co-expression of BiP (Fig. 1C, lanes 1–4, quantified in D). Co-expression of the ERdj3-SDF2L1 complex, but not ERdj3 or SDF2L1 alone, decreased the amount of NHK-QQQ in the pellet fraction (Fig. 1C, lanes 5–10, quantified in D). Thus, BiP, ERdj3, and SDF2L1 affected NHK-QQQ aggregation similarly to κ LC aggregation. Notably, ERdj3 alone did not inhibit the aggregation of κ LC and NHK-QQQ in a cell-based assay. Considering the well-established chaperone activity of ERdj3, which binds and transfers unfolded or misfolding-prone proteins to BiP in cells (14Pobre K.F.R. Poet G.J. Hendershot L.M.

ERdj3 is secreted into the extracellular space when its expression is up-regulated due to ER stress or overexpression (19Genereux J.C. Qu S. Zhou M. Ryno L.M. Wang S. Shoulders M.D. Kaufman R.J. Lasmézas C.I. Kelly J.W. Wiseman R.L.

ERdj3 lacks an ER retrieval signal (Fig. 2A, left), whereas SDF2L1 is retained in the ER via a C-terminal HDEL motif (28Raykhel I. Alanen H. Salo K. Jurvansuu J. Nguyen V.D. Latva-Ranta M. Ruddock L. A molecular specificity code for the three mammalian KDEL receptors.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179 (18086916): 1193-120410.1083/jcb.200705180Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A, right). Hence, we analyzed the subcellular localization of the ERdj3-SDF2L1 complex by immunocytochemistry. To distinguish the transfected proteins from their endogenous counterparts, we fused the Myc-tag and HA-tag to ERdj3 and SDF2L1, respectively, and visualized the transfected proteins using anti-tag antibodies. Staining for overexpressed ERdj3-Myc was localized in the extracellular space (Fig. 2B, top). The Myc-tag signal did not co-localize with the ER marker PDI and was detectable without cell permeabilization (Fig. 2C). However, ERdj3-Myc was retained in the ER by co-expression of SDF2L1-HA (Fig. 2B, bottom), indicating that secretion of ERdj3 was inhibited by formation of a complex with SDF2L1 in the ER. We next performed cycloheximide chase experiments to monitor the secretion of ERdj3. ERdj3-Myc in cell lysate decreased, with a reciprocal increase in the medium, during the chase periods (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–3, 7, and 8, quantified in B, open circles). Co-expression of SDF2L1 increased the amount of ERdj3 remaining in the cell lysate and conversely decreased the amount of ERdj3 secreted into the medium (Fig. 3A, lanes 4–6, 9, and 10, quantified in B, closed circles). These results prompted us to analyze the requirement of SDF2L1 for the ER localization of endogenous ERdj3. Knockdown of SDF2L1 using siRNA increased the secretion of ERdj3, although the difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 3C, compare lane 7 with lane 5, quantified in D). We speculated that the small effect of SDF2L1 knockdown was caused by the lower expression of SDF2L1 in HEK293 cells under normal growth conditions (GeneCards; 25Fujimori T. Suno R. Iemura S.I. Natsume T. Wada I. Hosokawa N. Endoplasmic reticulum proteins SDF2 and SDF2L1 act as components of the BiP chaperone cycle to prevent protein aggregation.Genes Cells. 2017; 22 (28597544): 684-69810.1111/gtc.12506Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, we depleted SDF2, a homologue of SDF2L1, that also interacts with ERdj3 in cells (25Fujimori T. Suno R. Iemura S.I. Natsume T. Wada I. Hosokawa N. Endoplasmic reticulum proteins SDF2 and SDF2L1 act as components of the BiP chaperone cycle to prevent protein aggregation.Genes Cells. 2017; 22 (28597544): 684-69810.1111/gtc.12506Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Knockdown of SDF2 increased secretion of ERdj3 into the medium to a greater extent than knockdown of SDF2L1 (Fig. 3C, compare lane 6 with lane 7, quantified in D). Depletion of both SDF2 and SDF2L1 further potentiated the secretion of ERdj3 (Fig. 3C, compare lane 8 with lane 5, quantified in D). Consistent with this, the level of ERdj3 in the cell lysate was significantly reduced when both SDF2 and SDF2L1 were knocked down (Fig. 3C, compare lane 4 with lane 1, IB: ERdj3). These results indicate that SDF2L1 and SDF2 are redundantly required for the ER localization of ERdj3. We next investigated whether the HDEL ER retrieval signal of SDF2L1 was required for ER localization of ERdj3. SDF2L1 lacking the C-terminal HDEL sequence (SDF2L1-ΔC) was secreted in the medium (Fig. S2). Consistent with this, co-expression of SDF2L1-ΔC did not inhibit secretion of ERdj3 (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 8 and 9, IB: ERdj3), and vice versa (Fig. S2). ERdj3 bound SDF2L1-ΔC similarly to WT SDF2L1 (Fig. S3). We then compared the chaperone activities of ERdj3-SDF2L1-ΔC and WT ERdj3-SDF2L1 complexes using a cell-based assay. Co-expression of ERdj3 and SDF2L1-ΔC did not increase the solubility of κ LC (Fig. 4A, IB: κ LC, quantified in B), revealing that the ERdj3-SDF2L1-ΔC complex lost the ability to inhibit aggregati"

This is accompanied by physiological changes such as galvanic skin response (GSR), an indicator for emotional arousal, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), referring to vagal activity. We investigated whether the presence of a cinema audience affects these psychophysiological processes. The study was conducted in a real cinema in Berlin. Participants came twice to watch previously rated emotional film scenes eliciting amusement, anger, tenderness or fear. Once they watched the scenes alone, once in a group. We tested whether the vagal modulation in response to the mere presence of others influences explicit (reported) and implicit markers (RSA, heart rate (HR) and GSR) of emotional processes in function of solitary or collective enjoyment of movie scenes. On the physiological level, we found a mediating effect of vagal flexibility to the mere presence of others. Individuals showing a high baseline difference (alone vs. social) prior to the presentation of film, maintained higher RSA in the alone compared to the social condition. The opposite pattern emerged for low baseline difference individuals. Emotional arousal as reflected in GSR was significantly more pronounced during scenes eliciting anger independent of the social condition. On the behavioural level, we found evidence for emotion-specific effects on reported empathy, emotional intensity and Theory of Mind. Furthermore, people who decrease their RSA in response to others' company are those who felt themselves more empathically engaged with the characters. Our data speaks in favour of a specific role of vagal regulation in response to the mere presence of others in terms of explicit empathic engagement with characters during shared filmic experience."

TM-1 (upland cotton) and G. barbadense cv. Hai 7124 (island cotton). The plants were grown in field soil (FS) that had been continuously cropped with cotton and nutrient-rich soil (NS) that had not been cropped. The fungal species richness, diversity, and community composition were analyzed and compared among the soil resources, cotton genotypes, and developmental stages. We found that the fungal community structures were different between the rhizosphere and bulk soil and the difference were significantly varied between FS and NS. Our results suggested that cotton rhizosphere fungal community structure variation may have been primarily influenced by the interaction of cotton roots with different soil resources. We also found that the community composition of the cotton rhizosphere fungi varied significantly during different developmental stages. In addition, we observed fungi that was enriched or depleted at certain developmental stages and genotypes in FS and NS, and these insights can lay a foundation for deep research into the dynamics of pathogenic fungi and nutrient absorption of cotton roots. This research illustrates the characteristics of the cotton rhizosphere fungal communities and provides important information for understanding the potential influences of rhizosphere fungal communities on cotton growth and health."

Under non-stress conditions the zir1 mutant with only 21% glutathione showed a pronounced dwarf phenotype. All other mutants with intermediate glutathione contents up to 62% in contrast showed consistently slightly smaller shoots than the wild-type. Moderate drought stress imposed through water withdrawal until shoot growth ceased showed that wild-type plants and all mutants responded similarly in terms of chlorophyll fluorescence and growth retardation. These results lead to the conclusion that glutathione is important for general plant performance but that the glutathione content does not affect tolerance to moderate drought conditions typically experienced by crops in the field."

The lack of spatial and temporal resolution using current EGG methods presents a significant roadblock to more widespread usage. Human and preclinical studies have shown that GI myoelectric electrodes can record signals containing significantly more information than can be derived from abdominal surface electrodes. The current study sought to assess the efficacy of multi-electrode arrays, surgically implanted on the serosal surface of the GI tract, from gastric fundus-to-duodenum, in recording myoelectric signals. It also examines the potential for machine learning algorithms to predict functional states, such as retching and emesis, from GI signal features. Studies were performed using ferrets, a gold standard model for emesis testing. Our results include simultaneous recordings from up to six GI recording sites in both anesthetized and chronically implanted free-moving ferrets. Testing conditions to produce different gastric states included gastric distension, intragastric infusion of emetine (a prototypical emetic agent), and feeding. Despite the observed variability in GI signals, machine learning algorithms, including k-nearest neighbors and support vector machines, were able to detect the state of the stomach with high overall accuracy (>75%). The present study is the first demonstration of machine learning algorithms to detect the physiological state of the stomach and onset of retching, which could provide a methodology to diagnose GI diseases and symptoms such as nausea and vomiting."

Patients who underwent surgical treatment for EGC between January 2003 and February 2016 were retrospectively evaluated. Patients who underwent previous gastric surgery or treatment for gastric neoplasms were excluded. Finally, 1076 patients treated for EGC were included in the analysis. We analyzed risk factors of LNM by dividing patients into male and female groups. Of 1076 patients (mean age 59.6 years), 69% were men. The overall LNM rate was 9.4%. The LNM rate was lower in men (7.8%) than in women (12.9%). Multivariate analysis showed that elevated type (odds ratio [OR], 2.084; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.053-4.125; P = 0.035), submucosal invasion (OR, 2.162; 95% CI: 1.018-4.595; P = 0.045), undifferentiated type (OR, 2.044; 95% CI: 1.107-3.772; P = 0.022), and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) (OR, 7.210; 95% CI: 3.835-13.554; P<0.001) were independent predictive risk factors of LNM in EGC in men.

https://openalex.org/W2981120478,"This manuscript presents two studies on the effect of mindfulness meditation on duration judgment and its relationship to the subjective experience of time when the interval durations are on the second or the minute time scale. After the first 15 minutes of a 30-min meditation or control exercise, meditation-trained participants judged interval durations of 15 to 50 s or 2 to 6 min, during which they performed either a mindfulness meditation exercise or a control exercise. The participants' scores on the self-reported scales indicated the effectiveness of the meditation exercise, as it increased the level of present-moment awareness and happiness and decreased that of anxiety. The results showed an underestimation of time for the short interval durations and an overestimation of time for the long intervals, although the participants always reported that time passed faster with meditation than with the control exercise. Further statistical analyses revealed that the focus on the present-moment significantly mediated the exercise effect on the time estimates for long durations. The inversion in time estimates between the two time scales is explained in terms of the different mechanisms underlying the judgment of short and long durations, i.e., the cognitive mechanisms of attention and memory, respectively."

Genotyping based on Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Units-Variable Tandem Repeats (MIRU-VNTR) has been widely used to differentiate between relapse and reinfection, which are the two main causes of recurrent TB. There is a lack of data regarding the causes of TB recurrence in Georgia, and while differentiating between relapse and reinfection plays a key role in defining appropriate interventions, the required genotyping methodologies have not been implemented. The objective of this study was to implement MIRU-VNTR genotyping at the National Center for Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (NCTBLD) and differentiate between relapse and reinfection in multidrug resistant (MDR-) TB patients from Tbilisi, Georgia.Recurrent MDR tuberculosis cases from 2014-2016 diagnosed at NCTLD were included in the study when bacterial samples from both episodes were available. Genotyping based on the MIRU-VNTR 24 loci was implemented and used for differentiating between relapse and reinfection. Paired samples showing the same MIRU-VNTR pattern or one locus difference were classified as relapse, while two and more loci differences were treated as reinfection. Exact logistic regression was used to identify predictors of recurrence.Thirty two MDR-TB patients (64 samples) were included and MIRU-VNTR 24 typing was performed on the corresponding paired samples. Of the 32 patients, 25 (83.3%) were identified as relapse while 5 (16.7%) were due to re-infection. Patients with a history of incarceration were significantly associated with TB reinfection (p< 0.05).Recurrent TB in MDR patients in Georgia are mainly caused by relapse, raising concerns on the efficacy of the TB control program. An association between incarceration and reinfection likely reflects high levels of ongoing TB transmission in prisons, indicating the need for better TB infection control measures in these settings. Our results add to the rationale for implementing genotypic surveillance of TB more broadly to support TB control in Georgia."

https://openalex.org/W2980497632,"Several pathways exist to bypass DNA damage during replication. One such pathway is template switching. The Rad5 protein plays two important roles in template switching: it is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that catalyzes PCNA poly-ubiquitylation and it is a helicase that converts replication forks to chicken foot structures. To understand the structure, conformational flexibility, and mechanism of Rad5, we used a full-ensemble hybrid method combining Langevin dynamics simulations and small-angle X-ray scattering. From these studies, we generated the first experimentally validated, high-resolution structural model of Rad5. We found that Rad5 is more compact and less extended than is suggested by its large amount of predicted intrinsic disorder. Thus, Rad5 likely has a novel intra-molecular interaction that limits the range of conformational space it can sample. We provide evidence for a novel interaction between the HIRAN and the helicase domains of Rad5, and we discuss the biological and mechanistic implications of this."

In this paper we introduce Tangle, a time span-guided neural attention model that can accurately and timely predict the upcoming need for a second-line diabetes therapy from administrative data in the Australian adult population. The method is suitable for designing automatic therapy review recommendations for patients and their providers without the need to collect clinical measures.We analyzed seven years of de-identified records (2008-2014) of the 10% publicly available linked sample of Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) electronic databases of Australia.By design, Tangle inherits the representational power of pre-trained word embedding, such as GloVe, to encode sequences of claims with the related MBS codes. Moreover, the proposed attention mechanism natively exploits the information hidden in the time span between two successive claims (measured in number of days). We compared the proposed method against state-of-the-art sequence classification methods.Tangle outperforms state-of-the-art recurrent neural networks, including attention-based models. In particular, when the proposed time span-guided attention strategy is coupled with pre-trained embedding methods, the model performance reaches an Area Under the ROC Curve of 90%, an improvement of almost 10 percentage points over an attentionless recurrent architecture.Tangle is implemented in Python using Keras and it is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/samuelefiorini/tangle."

During cellular reprogramming, genes associated with pluripotency establishment need to be up-regulated, and developmental genes need to be silenced. However, how ceRNAs control cellular reprogramming still awaits full elucidation. Here, we used doxycycline-inducible expression of the four transcription factors octamer-binding protein 4 (OCT4), SRY-box 2 (SOX2), Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), and proto-oncogene c-Myc (c-Myc) to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Using RNA-Seq and bioinformatics approaches, we found that the expression levels of miRNAs from MEFs remain high from day 0 to 6 after the doxycycline induction. Many genes targeted by these miRNAs were up-regulated, and long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs), which have complementary binding sites to these miRNAs, were highly expressed, indicating lincRNAs and circRNAs may function as ceRNAs. Intriguingly, knockdown of the linc/circRNAs that sponge the miRNAs, which target OCT4 down-regulated exogenous OCT4, decreased reprogramming efficiency, and resulted in low-grade iPSCs.

https://openalex.org/W2980671499,"To evaluate the urinary levels of inositol phosphates (InsPs) in rats that received different salts of myo-inositol hexaphosphate (InsP6) by gavage or by oral administration.Thirty rats received AIN-76A diet (in which InsPs are undetectable) for 15 days. Then, 12 rats received InsP6 by gavage as a Na salt or a Ca/Mg salt; after 4 days, the Na or Ca/Mg InsP6 was administered with water containing 15 g/L sucrose and urine samples were collected. The other 18 rats received oral InsP6, in which 0.5 g of sugar was combined with InsP6 as a Na salt, a Ca/Mg salt, or a Na salt with CaCO3; daily urine samples were collected. Urine levels of InsPs were determined using a nonspecific method and a specific method (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, PAGE), and different InsPs were identified by mass spectroscopy (MS).After 15 days of the InsP6-free diet, the non-specific method detected no urinary InsPs, and MS detected only InsP2. After administration of Na-InsP6 by gavage, the non-specific method indicated more urinary InsPs than the amount of InsP6 determined by PAGE. MS indicated the presence of urinary InsP2, InsP3, InsP4, InsP5, and InsP6 in these rats, with notable variations among animals. Use of the same treatment to administer Ca/Mg-InsP6 led to a lower overall content of urinary InsPs and a lower level of InsP6. Oral administration of InsP6 as a sugar pill led to lower urinary levels of InsPs than administration of InsP6 by gavage, and administration as a Ca/Mg pill or a Ca/Mg pill with CaCO3 led to lower levels than administration as a Na pill.Administration of InsP6 to rats leads to the excretion of a mixture of different InsPs. Rats more effectively absorb InsP6 when supplied without dietary components that interfere with its uptake, such as the Ca ion and sugar."
https://openalex.org/W2980780811,"To investigate the issues of the NNT based on the absolute risk reduction (ARR), namely NNTARR; and to propose an alternative definition and an estimation procedure based on the restricted mean survival time (RMST), namely NNTRMST, for RCTs. Three recent clinical trials with survival endpoints, representing different scenarios, were selected to compare the performance of the NNTARR and NNTRMST. For each trial, both versions of NNT were estimated using the reconstructed individual-level data, and the average life gain (ALG) was derived to show the differences between the NNTARR and NNTRMST. Four hypothetical scenarios were constructed to further explore the advantages and disadvantages of each definition of the NNT for survival endpoints. For the illustrative trial examples, the NNTARR failed to capture the profile of the treatment effect over time as it is calculated at a specific time point. Sometimes it may even result in misinterpretations of the treatment benefit. In particular, when either the observed event rates are low, the two survival curves cross, or a mixture of survival patterns exist. In contrast, the NNTRMST based on the average survival (or event-free) time can quantify the treatment effect more accurately and its interpretation is more intuitive and clinically meaningful. The NNTRMST can be used as an alternative measure for quantifying treatment effect in RCTs, especially so in the case of the ALG, which helps practitioners to better understand the magnitude of the benefit conferred by treatment."

Here, we examined the structure of the complex of Ric8A with minimized Gαi (miniGαi) in solution by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and exploited the scattering profile in modeling of the Ric8A/miniGαi complex by steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations. A small set of models of the complex featured minimal clash scores, excellent agreement with the experimental SAXS data, and a large-scale rearrangement of the signal-transducing α5-helix of Gα away from its β-sheet core. The resulting interface involved the Gα α5-helix bound to the concave surface of Ric8A and the Gα β-sheet that wraps around the C-terminal part of the Ric8A armadillo domain, leading to a severe disruption of the GDP-binding site. Further modeling of the flexible C-terminal tail of Ric8A indicated that it interacts with the effector surface of Gα. This smaller interface may enable the Ric8A-bound Gα to interact with GTP.

https://openalex.org/W2981070849,"Posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is central to sensorimotor processing for goal-directed hand and foot movements. Yet, the specific role of PPC subregions in these functions is not clear. Previous human neuroimaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) work has suggested that PPC lateral to the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) is involved in directing the arm, shaping the hand, and correcting both finger-shaping and hand trajectory during movement. The lateral localization of these functions agrees with the comparably lateral position of the hand and fingers within the motor and somatosensory homunculi along the central sulcus; this might suggest that, in analogy, (goal-directed) foot movements would be mediated by medial portions of PPC. However, foot movement planning activates similar regions for both hand and foot movement along the caudal-to-rostral axis of PPC, with some effector-specificity evident only rostrally, near the central regions of sensorimotor cortex. Here, we attempted to test the causal involvement of PPC regions medial to IPS in hand and foot reaching as well as online correction evoked by target displacement. Participants made hand and foot reaches towards identical visual targets. Sometimes, the target changed position 100–117 ms into the movement. We disturbed cortical processing over four positions medial to IPS with three pulses of TMS separated by 40 ms, both during trials with and without target displacement. We timed TMS to disrupt reach execution and online correction. TMS did not affect endpoint error, endpoint variability, or reach trajectories for hand or foot. While these negative results await replication with different TMS timing and parameters, we conclude that regions medial to IPS are involved in planning, rather than execution and online control, of goal-directed limb movements."
https://openalex.org/W2981101173,"Shigella species remains a major diarrhoeagenic agent, affecting mostly children, with global high incidence and high mortality rate specially in developing areas. Although azithromycin is recommended for treatment of shigellosis, there are currently no CLSI susceptibility breakpoints, accordingly no routine antimicrobial susceptibility test is performed in the clinical laboratory. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence, resistance profile and molecular epidemiology of azithromycin non-susceptible Shigella strains in Israel during a three year period. Shigella isolates (n = 1,170) referred to the National Reference Center during 2014–2016, were included in this study. Serotyping was performed by slide agglutination. Resistance genes, mph(A) and erm(B), were identified by PCR and the phenotype profile was determined by broth microdilution (BMD). Genetic relatedness was assessed by wgMLST. Decreased susceptibility to azithromycin (DSA) phenotype and genotype were detected in various Shigella species and serotypes related to diverse genetic backgrounds and antimicrobial profiles: 6% (26/423) of Shigella flexneri and 2% (16/747) of Shigella sonnei displayed DSA (MIC16 mg/L). Correlation of this phenotype with the presence of mph(A) and erm(B) genes was confirmed. All DSA-strains displayed resistance to ≥3 different antimicrobial classes. Among DSA-strains, 14% were resistant to quinolones and 5% displayed resistance to ceftriaxone. Most of these strains (32/42) were isolated from children in the southern and central regions of Israel. Clonality and significant relatedness was confirmed by PFGE and wgMLST. The presence of macrolide resistance genes among the different species and lineages reflects the transmissible nature of these genes. The emergence of DSA-Shigella reinforces the necessity to establish clinical breakpoints that would warrant routine testing, reporting and surveillance for this drug of choice."

https://openalex.org/W2980593842,"Jujubes (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) are among the main agroeconomically important crops in Xinjiang, China, and those from this region have the highest production worldwide. However, the reason for the high quality of the jujubes in the region is unknown. In our current research, the total phosphorus (P), total nitrogen (N), organic matter (OM), available P, alkaline N and quick potassium (K) were quantitatively analyzed in soils collected from orchards in 11 geographical locations, counties or cities, in Xinjiang. Meanwhile, the P, total triterpenoids, soluble solids, polysaccharide and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (CAMP) contents were also used to indicate fruit quality. Based on the analyzed data, principal component analysis (PCA) and multiple regression analysis revealed a high correlation between soil nutrients and the quality of the Jun jujube, which was used as an example. Specifically, the total P and quick K contents significantly differed among the orchard soils. Moreover, they significantly affected fruit quality. Total P significantly affected the soluble solids and total triterpenoids contents and was negatively correlated with the former and positively correlated with the latter. In addition, the soluble solids and total triterpenoids contents were significantly affected by the quick K content; as the quick K content increased, the soluble solids content gradually increased, while the total triterpenoids content decreased. According to the response surface model, we suggest that when the total P and quick K contents in the soil in Xinjiang were 0.76 g/kg and 365.04 mg/kg, respectively, the optimal fruit quality was obtained. Therefore, two-dimensional analysis of fruit quality and soil nutrients showed that it is necessary to increase the total P and quick K contents in the soil used to grow jujubes in Xinjiang."
https://openalex.org/W2981015451,"In the past scientists reported summaries of their findings; they did not provide their original data collections. Many stakeholders (e.g., funding agencies) are now requesting that such data be made publicly available. This mandate is being adopted to facilitate further discovery, and to mitigate waste and deficits in the research process. At the same time, the necessary infrastructure for data curation (e.g., repositories) has been evolving. The current target is to make research products FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), resulting in data that are curated and archived to be both human and machine compatible. However, most scientists have little training in data curation. Specifically, they are ill-equipped to annotate their data collections at a level that facilitates discoverability, aggregation, and broad reuse in a context separate from their creation or sub-field. To circumvent these deficits data architects may collaborate with scientists to transform and curate data. This paper’s example of a data collection describes the electrical properties of outer hair cells isolated from the mammalian cochlea. The data is expressed with a variant of The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI), mirrored to provide the metadata and nested data architecture used within the Hierarchical Data Format version 5 (HDF5) format. Each digital specimen is displayed in a tree configuration (like directories in a computer) and consists of six main branches based on the ontology classes. The data collections, scripts, and ontological OWL file (OBI based Inner Ear Electrophysiology (OBI_IEE)) are deposited in three repositories. We discuss the impediments to producing such data collections for public use, and the tools and processes required for effective implementation. This work illustrates the impact that small collaborations can have on the curation of our publicly-funded collections, and is particularly salient for fields where data is sparse, throughput is low, and sacrifice of animals is required for discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2980519565,"Metisa plana (Walker) is a leaf defoliating pest that is able to cause staggering economical losses to oil palm cultivation. Considering the economic devastation that the pest could bring, an early warning system to predict its outbreak is crucial. The state of art of satellite technologies are now able to derive environmental factors such as relative humidity (RH) that may influence pest population's fluctuations in rapid, harmless, and cost-effective manners. This study examined the relationship between the presence of Metisa plana at different time lags and remote sensing (RS) derived RH by using statistical and machine learning approaches. Metisa plana census data of cumulated larvae instar 1, 2, 3, and 4 were collected biweekly in 2014 and 2015 in an oil palm plantation in Muadzam Shah, Pahang, Malaysia. Relative humidity values derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images were apportioned to 6 time lags; 1 week (T1), 2 weeks (T2), 3 week (T3), 4 weeks (T4), 5 week (T5) and 6 weeks (T6) and paired with the respective census data. Pearson's correlation was carried out to analyse the relationship between Metisa plana and RH at different time lags. Regression analyses and artificial neural network (ANN) were also conducted to develop the best prediction model of Metisa plana's outbreak. The results showed relatively high correlations, positively or negatively, between the presences of Metisa plana with RH ranging from 0.46 to 0.99. ANN was found to be superior to regression models with the adjusted coefficient of determination (R2) between the actual and predicted Metisa plana values ranging from 0.06 to 0.57 versus 0.00 to 0.05. The analysis on the best time lags illustrated that the multiple time lags were more influential on the Metisa plana population than the individual time lags. The best Metisa plana prediction model was derived from T1, T2 and T3 multiple time lags modelled using the ANN algorithm with R2 value of 0.57, errors below 1.14 and accuracies above 93%. Based on the result of this study, the elucidation of Metisa plana's landscape ecology was possible with the utilization of RH as the predictor variable in consideration of the time lag effects of RH on the pest's population."
https://openalex.org/W2980330555,"We examined the effect of liquorice ingestion on haemodynamic responses to exogenous nitric oxide donor (nitroglycerin) and β2-adrenoceptor agonist (salbutamol), and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity, in 21 volunteers and 21 reference subjects. Haemodynamic data was captured before and after sublingual nitroglycerin (0.25 mg) and inhaled salbutamol (400 μg) during orthostatic challenge utilising radial pulse wave analysis and whole-body impedance cardiography. The recordings were performed at baseline and following two weeks of liquorice intake (290–370 mg/d glycyrrhizin). Urinary cortisone and cortisol metabolites were examined. Liquorice intake elevated aortic systolic and diastolic blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance when compared with the reference group. Following research drug administration the liquorice-induced increase in systemic vascular resistance was observed in the presence of nitroglycerin (p<0.05) but no longer in the presence of salbutamol. Liquorice ingestion decreased cardiac chronotropic response to upright posture (p = 0.032) in unadjusted analysis, but when adjusted for age and sex the difference in the upright change in heart rate was no longer significant. The urinary cortisone to cortisol metabolite ratio decreased from 0.70 to 0.31 (p<0.001) after liquorice intake indicating significant inhibition of the 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2. In the reference group the haemodynamic variables remained virtually unchanged. These results suggest that liquorice exposure impaired vasodilatation in vivo that was induced by exogenous nitric oxide donor but not that induced by β2-adrenoceptor stimulation.

https://openalex.org/W2980531445,"The Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium sequence type 213 (ST213) emerged as a predominant genotype in Mexico. It is characterized by harboring multidrug resistance (MDR) IncC plasmids (previously IncA/C) and the lack of the Salmonella virulence plasmid (pSTV). Here we show that the D6-like plasmid prophage is present in most of the ST213 strains. We used the reported nucleotide sequence of YU39 plasmid (pYU39_89) to design a PCR typing scheme for the D6-like plasmid prophages, and determined the complete nucleotide sequences for the D6-like prophages of three additional ST213 strains (YU07-18, SL26 and SO21). Two prophage variants were described: i) a complete prophage, containing homologous sequences for most of the genetic modules described in P1 and D6 phages, which most likely allow for the lytic and lysogenic lifestyles; and ii) an incomplete prophage, lacking a 15 kb region containing morphogenesis genes, suggesting that it is defective. The tail fiber gene inversion region was the most divergent one between D6 and pYU39_89 genomes, suggesting the production of a distinct set of tail fibers, which could be involved in host range preferences. A glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase gene (glnS), which could be involved in providing host cell increased fitness or plasmid maintenance functions, was found in all D6-like genomes. Population level analysis revealed a biogeographic pattern of distribution of these plasmid-phages and specific associations with variants of MDR IncC plasmids. Statistically significant associations were found between the two prophage variants (p75 or p89), the type of IncC plasmids (I or II) and geographic isolation regions (Sonora, San Luis Potosí, Michoacán and Yucatán).

https://openalex.org/W2980809696,"The food habits of the Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus) are well studied, but there is a little evidence of dietary specialization-that is, when individuals use a narrower set of resources compared to the population as a whole. To examine the dietary composition at the individual level, seasonal patterns of dietary specialization, and sex-based dietary differences in Asiatic black bears, we attached Global Positioning System (GPS) collars to 15 Asiatic black bears and collected their scats in Nagano Prefecture, Japan from 2017 to 2018. Our results showed that the dietary composition differed among individuals, although seasonal changes in dietary composition were observed at the population level. Dietary specialization was high in summer (resources less abundant) and low in spring and autumn (resources more abundant), indicating a relationship with general food abundance and the dietary diversity of bears. In spring, all bears consumed green vegetation and/or seed of Fagaceae family from previous autumn; in early- and late- summer, dietary composition, such as green vegetation, insects, and fruits, greatly differed among individuals. In autumn, most bears heavily depended on seeds of Fagaceae which is high-quality food for bears. Although we did not find statistical differences between sexes in terms of dietary specialization and diversity, we found variations in the timing of feeding on the Fagaceae family, being earlier in females compared with males. We also found considerable variation in dietary composition within sexes, suggesting that dietary specialization depends on multiple factors besides food abundance, food diversity, and sex."
https://openalex.org/W2980949927,"Ricin undergoes retrograde transport to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and ricin toxin A chain (RTA) enters the cytosol from the ER. Previous reports indicated that RTA inhibits activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in yeast and in mammalian cells. Both precursor (preRTA) and mature form of RTA (mRTA) inhibited splicing of HAC1u (u for uninduced) mRNA, suggesting that UPR inhibition occurred on the cytosolic face of the ER. Here, we examined the role of ribosome binding and depurination activity on inhibition of the UPR using mRTA mutants. An active-site mutant with very low depurination activity, which bound ribosomes as WT RTA, did not inhibit HAC1u mRNA splicing. A ribosome-binding mutant, which showed reduced binding to ribosomes but retained depurination activity, inhibited HAC1u mRNA splicing. This mutant allowed separation of the UPR inhibition by RTA from cytotoxicity because it reduced the rate of depurination. The ribosome-binding mutant inhibited the UPR without affecting IRE1 oligomerization or cleavage of HAC1u mRNA at the splice site junctions. Inhibition of the UPR correlated with the depurination level, suggesting that ribosomes play a role in splicing of HAC1u mRNA. We show that HAC1u mRNA is associated with ribosomes and does not get processed on depurinated ribosomes, thereby inhibiting the UPR. These results demonstrate that RTA inhibits HAC1u mRNA splicing through its depurination activity on the ribosome without directly affecting IRE1 oligomerization or the splicing reaction and provide evidence that IRE1 recognizes HAC1u mRNA that is associated with ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2980988780,"Purpose Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is defined as an arterial oxygenation defect induced by intrapulmonary vascular dilatations associated with hepatic disease. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of type 1 and 2 pulmonary vascular abnormalities on chest computed tomography (CT) in patients with cirrhosis and HPS and to characterize intra- and interobserver reliability. Materials and methods Two thoracic radiologists retrospectively evaluated chest CT scans from 38 cirrhosis patients with HPS. They classified the pulmonary vascular abnormalities as type 1 (multiple dilated distal pulmonary arteries), type 2(nodular dilatation or individual pulmonary arterial malformation), or absence of abnormality. Furthermore, they measured the diameters of the central pulmonary arteries and subsegmental pulmonary arteries and bronchi. We analyzed the prevalence, intraobserver reliability, and interobserver reliability of abnormal CT findings related to HPS, and the correlation of these findings with partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2). Results The overall prevalence of pulmonary vascular abnormalities was 28.9% (95% confidence intervals: 15.4%, 45.9%). Moreover, 26.3% of patients had type 1 abnormality (13.4%, 43.1%) and 2.6% of patients had type 2 abnormality (0.0%, 13.8%). The intraobserver reliability kappa value was 0.666 (0.40, 0.91) and the interobserver kappa value was 0.443 (0.12, 0.77). There was no correlation between pulmonary vascular abnormalities on CT and PaO2 values. Conclusions The prevalence of pulmonary vascular abnormalities on chest CT of patients with cirrhosis and HPS is low and not correlated with PaO2. These findings question the usefulness of chest CT for the evaluation of patients with cirrhosis and HPS."

The Waiting Place.” Little did I know it, but after I emerged from the “weirdish wild space” of graduate school, The Waiting Place was exactly where I was headed. I had accepted a postdoc position to develop new skills while embarking on what I anticipated would be a quick, productive search for an industry job. Instead that search dragged on, filled with false hopes and disappointments. I often felt I was going nowhere. But now that I've passed the 1-year mark in my first position outside of academia, I can look back and say that I learned a valuable skill: the ability to wait actively. Here are three strategies I found most helpful.

> “As a freshly minted Ph.D.…I wasn't sure how to pitch my skills to potential employers.” 

SEEK GUIDANCE. As a freshly minted Ph.D., I had plenty of material for my resume, but I wasn't sure how to pitch my skills to potential employers. To address this, I sought out a career coach who specialized in helping people with Ph.D.s in science and engineering. Hiring a professional consultant wasn't cheap, but I viewed it as an investment in another valuable skill: marketing myself. His guidance not only improved my resumes, but also gave me a better general understanding of how to present myself in meetings with recruiters and in interviews. I also took advantage of many free opportunities for career advice, including university-sponsored career forums, skills assessments with an on-campus career counselor, and numerous online resources for job seekers.

MEET NEW PEOPLE. At first, I felt that I didn't know “the right people” to help me get a job, especially because I was looking for an industry position and my contacts were mostly in the academic world. However, once I started to look, I was surprised to realize how many second-degree connections—friends of friends—I actually had in industry. I reached out to many of them and asked to talk about their work. I also asked friends and colleagues for introductions to people in their networks. And I found ways to meet people outside my niche research area, for example by attending presentations by startup companies, meetings of technology interest groups, and on-campus socials.

It sometimes felt awkward to put myself out there, but networking helped me learn about many companies and industries. It also led to job interviews, including with a Silicon Valley tech giant, a premier children's hospital, and a highly ranked liberal arts college. Organizations like to hire people they can trust, so having someone on the inside vouch for you can help you rise to the top of the applicant stack and get an interview.

PLAY THE LONG GAME. In the end, I got a job I didn't even apply for. During my first year as a postdoc, I applied for an opportunity I found on an online job board. This led to a promising email exchange, and I had a very positive interaction with one of the company's researchers at a conference. Unfortunately, the opportunity fell through. Another long year passed. I followed up with the company once or twice, but mostly I pursued other leads. Then, out of the blue, the researcher I had met contacted me about a new opening. It turned out I was a perfect fit for the company's current projects, and after a couple short phone calls I had an offer. It took almost 2 years to come to fruition, but the effort I had invested in building and maintaining a relationship with the company ultimately paid off.

The Waiting Place was frustrating, but I learned it doesn't have to be useless. Perseverance pays off. As Dr. Seuss reminds us: “And will you succeed? Yes! You will, indeed! (98 and 3/4 percent guaranteed.)”
