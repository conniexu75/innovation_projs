https://openalex.org/W4223520055,"Schizophrenia has a heritability of 60–80%1, much of which is attributable to common risk alleles. Here, in a two-stage genome-wide association study of up to 76,755 individuals with schizophrenia and 243,649 control individuals, we report common variant associations at 287 distinct genomic loci. Associations were concentrated in genes that are expressed in excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the central nervous system, but not in other tissues or cell types. Using fine-mapping and functional genomic data, we identify 120 genes (106 protein-coding) that are likely to underpin associations at some of these loci, including 16 genes with credible causal non-synonymous or untranslated region variation. We also implicate fundamental processes related to neuronal function, including synaptic organization, differentiation and transmission. Fine-mapped candidates were enriched for genes associated with rare disruptive coding variants in people with schizophrenia, including the glutamate receptor subunit GRIN2A and transcription factor SP4, and were also enriched for genes implicated by such variants in neurodevelopmental disorders. We identify biological processes relevant to schizophrenia pathophysiology; show convergence of common and rare variant associations in schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders; and provide a resource of prioritized genes and variants to advance mechanistic studies. A genome-wide association study including over 76,000 individuals with schizophrenia and over 243,000 control individuals identifies common variant associations at 287 genomic loci, and further fine-mapping analyses highlight the importance of genes involved in synaptic processes."
https://openalex.org/W4223433728,"Rare coding variation has historically provided the most direct connections between gene function and disease pathogenesis. By meta-analysing the whole exomes of 24,248 schizophrenia cases and 97,322 controls, we implicate ultra-rare coding variants (URVs) in 10 genes as conferring substantial risk for schizophrenia (odds ratios of 3-50, P < 2.14 × 10-6) and 32 genes at a false discovery rate of <5%. These genes have the greatest expression in central nervous system neurons and have diverse molecular functions that include the formation, structure and function of the synapse. The associations of the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor subunit GRIN2A and AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptor subunit GRIA3 provide support for dysfunction of the glutamatergic system as a mechanistic hypothesis in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. We observe an overlap of rare variant risk among schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders1, epilepsy and severe neurodevelopmental disorders2, although different mutation types are implicated in some shared genes. Most genes described here, however, are not implicated in neurodevelopment. We demonstrate that genes prioritized from common variant analyses of schizophrenia are enriched in rare variant risk3, suggesting that common and rare genetic risk factors converge at least partially on the same underlying pathogenic biological processes. Even after excluding significantly associated genes, schizophrenia cases still carry a substantial excess of URVs, which indicates that more risk genes await discovery using this approach."

Here, we explored the functional significance of these intratumor bacteria, primarily using a murine spontaneous breast-tumor model MMTV-PyMT. We found that depletion of intratumor bacteria significantly reduced lung metastasis without affecting primary tumor growth. During metastatic colonization, intratumor bacteria carried by circulating tumor cells promoted host-cell survival by enhancing resistance to fluid shear stress by reorganizing actin cytoskeleton. We further showed that intratumor administration of selected bacteria strains isolated from tumor-resident microbiota promoted metastasis in two murine tumor models with significantly different levels of metastasis potential. Our findings suggest that tumor-resident microbiota, albeit at low biomass, play an important role in promoting cancer metastasis, intervention of which might therefore be worth exploring for advancing oncology care."
https://openalex.org/W4223581113,"Infectious viral load (VL) expelled as droplets and aerosols by infected individuals partly determines transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). RNA VL measured by qRT–PCR is only a weak proxy for infectiousness. Studies on the kinetics of infectious VL are important to understand the mechanisms behind the different transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the effect of vaccination on transmission, which allows guidance of public health measures. In this study, we quantified infectious VL in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the first five symptomatic days by in vitro culturability assay in unvaccinated or vaccinated individuals infected with pre-variant of concern (pre-VOC) SARS-CoV-2, Delta or Omicron BA.1. Unvaccinated individuals infected with pre-VOC SARS-CoV-2 had lower infectious VL than Delta-infected unvaccinated individuals. Full vaccination (defined as >2 weeks after receipt of the second dose during the primary vaccination series) significantly reduced infectious VL for Delta breakthrough cases compared to unvaccinated individuals. For Omicron ﻿BA.1 breakthrough cases, reduced infectious VL was observed only in boosted but not in fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals. In addition, infectious VL was lower in fully vaccinated Omicron BA.1﻿-infected individuals compared to fully vaccinated Delta-infected individuals, suggesting that mechanisms other than increased infectious VL contribute to the high infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1﻿. Our findings indicate that vaccines may lower transmission risk and, therefore, have a public health benefit beyond the individual protection from severe disease. The infectious viral load of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1﻿ is lower than that of Delta in symptomatic breakthrough infections of recipients of two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, suggesting that the higher transmission of Omicron BA.1﻿ is not linked to higher infectious viral load."
https://openalex.org/W4223506823,"The cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signalling system (CBASS) and the pyrimidine cyclase system for antiphage resistance (Pycsar) are antiphage defence systems in diverse bacteria that use cyclic nucleotide signals to induce cell death and prevent viral propagation1,2. Phages use several strategies to defeat host CRISPR and restriction-modification systems3-10, but no mechanisms are known to evade CBASS and Pycsar immunity. Here we show that phages encode anti-CBASS (Acb) and anti-Pycsar (Apyc) proteins that counteract defence by specifically degrading cyclic nucleotide signals that activate host immunity. Using a biochemical screen of 57 phages in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, we discover Acb1 from phage T4 and Apyc1 from phage SBSphiJ as founding members of distinct families of immune evasion proteins. Crystal structures of Acb1 in complex with 3'3'-cyclic GMP-AMP define a mechanism of metal-independent hydrolysis 3' of adenosine bases, enabling broad recognition and degradation of cyclic dinucleotide and trinucleotide CBASS signals. Structures of Apyc1 reveal a metal-dependent cyclic NMP phosphodiesterase that uses relaxed specificity to target Pycsar cyclic pyrimidine mononucleotide signals. We show that Acb1 and Apyc1 block downstream effector activation and protect from CBASS and Pycsar defence in vivo. Active Acb1 and Apyc1 enzymes are conserved in phylogenetically diverse phages, demonstrating that cleavage of host cyclic nucleotide signals is a key strategy of immune evasion in phage biology."
https://openalex.org/W4223569383,"Zebrafish and mammalian neonates possess robust cardiac regeneration via the induction of endogenous cardiomyocyte (CM) proliferation, but adult mammalian hearts have very limited regenerative potential. Developing small molecules for inducing adult mammalian heart regeneration has had limited success. We report a chemical cocktail of five small molecules (5SM) that promote adult CM proliferation and heart regeneration. A high-content chemical screen, along with an algorithm-aided prediction of small-molecule interactions, identified 5SM that efficiently induced CM cell cycle re-entry and cytokinesis. Intraperitoneal delivery of 5SM reversed the loss of heart function, induced CM proliferation, and decreased cardiac fibrosis after rat myocardial infarction. Mechanistically, 5SM potentially targets α1 adrenergic receptor, JAK1, DYRKs, PTEN, and MCT1 and is connected to lactate-LacRS2 signaling, leading to CM metabolic switching toward glycolysis/biosynthesis and CM de-differentiation before entering the cell-cycle. Our work sheds lights on the understanding CM regenerative mechanisms and opens therapeutic avenues for repairing the heart."
https://openalex.org/W4226096080,"Working memory (WM) enables information storage for future use, bridging the gap between perception and behavior. We hypothesize that WM representations are abstractions of low-level perceptual features. However, the neural nature of these putative abstract representations has thus far remained impenetrable. Here, we demonstrate that distinct visual stimuli (oriented gratings and moving dots) are flexibly recoded into the same WM format in visual and parietal cortices when that representation is useful for memory-guided behavior. Specifically, the behaviorally relevant features of the stimuli (orientation and direction) were extracted and recoded into a shared mnemonic format that takes the form of an abstract line-like pattern. We conclude that mnemonic representations are abstractions of percepts that are more efficient than and proximal to the behaviors they guide."
https://openalex.org/W4223587854,"Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a severe congenital heart disease with 30% mortality from heart failure (HF) in the first year of life, but the cause of early HF remains unknown. Induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) from patients with HLHS showed that early HF is associated with increased apoptosis, mitochondrial respiration defects, and redox stress from abnormal mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening and failed antioxidant response. In contrast, iPSC-CM from patients without early HF showed normal respiration with elevated antioxidant response. Single-cell transcriptomics confirmed that early HF is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction accompanied with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. These findings indicate that uncompensated oxidative stress underlies early HF in HLHS. Importantly, mitochondrial respiration defects, oxidative stress, and apoptosis were rescued by treatment with sildenafil to inhibit mPTP opening or TUDCA to suppress ER stress. Together these findings point to the potential use of patient iPSC-CM for modeling clinical heart failure and the development of therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W4223600320,"N-terminal acetylation is widespread in the eukaryotic proteome but in bacteria is restricted to a small number of proteins mainly involved in translation. It was long known that elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) is N-terminally acetylated, whereas the enzyme responsible for this process was unclear. Here, we report that RimI acetyltransferase, known to modify ribosomal protein S18, is likewise responsible for N-acetylation of the EF-Tu. With the help of inducible tufA expression plasmid, we demonstrated that the acetylation does not alter the stability of EF-Tu. Binding of aminoacyl tRNA to the recombinant EF-Tu in vitro was found to be unaffected by the acetylation. At the same time, with the help of fast kinetics methods, we demonstrate that an acetylated variant of EF-Tu more efficiently accelerates A-site occupation by aminoacyl-tRNA, thus increasing the efficiency of in vitro translation. Finally, we show that a strain devoid of RimI has a reduced growth rate, expanded to an evolutionary timescale, and might potentially promote conservation of the acetylation mechanism of S18 and EF-Tu. This study increased our understanding of the modification of bacterial translation apparatus.

This study increased our understanding of the modification of bacterial translation apparatus. Post-translational modifications are paramount for the regulation of protein activity, stability, and localization. Acetylation is among the most abundant protein modifications in eukaryotes (1Verdin E. Ott M. 50 Years of protein acetylation: From gene regulation to epigenetics, metabolism and beyond.Nat. Rev.

Protein acetylation is commonly carried out by the GCN5-related (GNAT) family of enzymes (2Favrot L. Blanchard J.S. Vergnolle O.

Acetylation of S5 was found to be involved in ribosome assembly (10Roy-Chaudhuri B. Kirthi N. Kelley T. Culver G.M.

RimL is known to catalyze ribosomal protein L12 acetylation (9Isono S. Isono K. Ribosomal protein modification in Escherichia coli. III.

Recently, RimL ascribed an additional function of microcin C acetylation resulting in a ground state E. coli resistance level toward this antibiotic (12Kazakov T. Kuznedelov K. Semenova E.

While the phenotype of rimL inactivation is moderate (9Isono S. Isono K. Ribosomal protein modification in Escherichia coli. III.

RimI-dependent acetylation of the ribosomal protein S18 (8Yoshikawa A. Isono S. Sheback A. Isono K.

Crystal structure of RimI from Salmonella typhimurium LT2, the GNAT responsible for N(alpha)-acetylation of ribosomal protein S18.Protein Sci. 2008; 17: 1781-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). EF-Tu, the most abundant bacterial protein (16Furano A.V. Content of elongation factor Tu in Escherichia coli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4780-4784Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), is N-terminally acetylated. Its abundance and conservation in bacteria allowed it to be recognized by the innate immunity system of plants as one of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (17Zipfel C. Kunze G. Chinchilla D. Caniard A. Jones J.D.G. Boller T. Felix G. Perception of the bacterial PAMP EF-Tu by the receptor EFR restricts Agrobacterium-mediated transformation.Cell. 2006; 125: 749-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar), and its acetylated N-terminal fragment is used as a recognition element (18Kunze G. Zipfel C. Robatzek S. Niehaus K. Boller T. Felix G. The N terminus of bacterial elongation factor Tu elicits innate immunity in Arabidopsis plants.Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3496-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). While there are indications that acetylation of EF-Tu may happen at internal lysine residues and this modification is under a growth stage control in Bacillus subtilis (19Suzuki S. Kondo N. Yoshida M. Nishiyama M. Kosono S. Dynamic changes in lysine acetylation and succinylation of the elongation factor Tu in Bacillus subtilis.Microbiology (Reading). 2019; 165: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), neither regulation nor function of N-terminal acetylation of EF-Tu was studied. The enzyme responsible for acetylation of EF-Tu has eluded identification for almost 4 decades. In this work, we have demonstrated that S18-specific acetyltransferase RimI is in addition responsible for the N-terminal acetylation of EF-Tu, thus being a dual-specificity enzyme. The majority of eukaryotic protein acetyltransferases is capable to modify multiple targets, while similar enzymes of bacteria are usually considered to be single protein specific. Since amino group acetylation removes a single positive charge, it might be detected by 2D protein gel electrophoresis. We compared total proteins extracted from ΔrimI strain from Keio knockout collection (20Baba T. Ara T. Hasegawa M. Takai Y. Okumura Y. Baba M. Datsenko K.A. Tomita M. Wanner B.L. Mori H. Construction of Escherichia coli K-12 in-frame, single-gene knockout mutants: The Keio collection.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2006; 2 (2006.0008)Crossref Scopus (5196) Google Scholar), labeled by Cy2 green fluorescent dye with that from the isogenic parental strain (21Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. One-step inactivation of chromosomal genes in Escherichia coli K-12 using PCR products.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10838) Google Scholar) labeled with the Cy5 red fluorescent dye with the help of 2D protein electrophoresis (Fig. 1). We expected that proteins that differed by the acetylation would be represented by a couple of green and red spots of the same molecular mass but different isoelectric points. We readily observed such an effect when comparing proteins from the WT and ΔrimI strains (Fig. 1). The protein spots with an isoelectric point dependent on the RimI were excised from the gel and identified by MALDI mass spectrometry (MS) following tryptic digestion. Both spots appeared to correspond to the EF-Tu protein. While intensity of several protein spots on the gel (Fig. 1) appears to depend on rimI gene functionality, they do not demonstrate the pattern that would indicate they represent the substrates of acetylation. To identify EF-Tu amino acid that is acetylated by RimI, we transformed ΔrimI strain with the plasmid carrying tufA gene with the C-terminal hexahistidine tag and used the resulting culture for EF-Tu preparation by metallochelate chromatography. WT strain transformed with the same plasmid was used for purification of the control EF-Tu sample. Tryptic hydrolysate of recombinant EF-Tu was subjected to MALDI MS analysis, which failed to reveal the modification site presumably because N-terminal end of EF-Tu is rich with basic amino acids, and digestion with trypsin results in a very short tryptic peptide. To overcome this difficulty, we applied chymotrypsin hydrolysis followed by MALDI MS analysis (Fig. 2A) and readily identified that EF-Tu from the WT, but not from ΔrimI strain, contains acetyl group attached to the N-terminal SKEKF peptide. Further fragmentation of this peptide in mass spectrometer (Fig. 2B) indicated that the N-terminal serine group is acetylated. This result corroborated earlier findings that EF-Tu is N-terminally acetylated (7Laursen R.A. L'Italien J.J. Nagarkatti S. Miller D.L. The amino acid sequence of elongation factor Tu of Escherichia coli. The complete sequence.J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8102-8109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, RimI is a dual-specificity protein acetyltransferase responsible for the N-terminal modification of two proteins, S18 and EF-Tu. To verify that rimI gene is indeed inactivated in the ΔrimI strain from Keio collection and since S18 protein is too small to be resolved by the standard 2D gel, we compared the mass of S18 protein, the known target of RimI (8Yoshikawa A. Isono S. Sheback A. Isono K. Cloning and nucleotide sequencing of the genes rimI and rimJ which encode enzymes acetylating ribosomal proteins S18 and S5 of Escherichia coli K12.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 209: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), from knockout and the WT strains (Fig. 2C). As expected, the mass of S18 from the knockout strain was found to be lower by precisely the mass of the acetyl group. To check that it is inactivation of rimI gene responsible for the difference in the EF-Tu isoelectric point, but not some hypothetic secondary mutation, we transformed ΔrimI strain with the plasmid coding for RimI protein. Analysis of EF-Tu by MALDI MS confirmed that reintroduction of rimI gene restored acetylation of N-terminal serine (Fig. 2D). Thus, we demonstrated that RimI is necessary for EF-Tu N terminus acetylation. It is most likely that RimI directly acetylates EF-Tu, although we should formally acknowledge that a possibility might exist that an influence of RimI on EF-Tu acetylation could be indirect. The structure of Salmonella typhimurium RimI protein in a complex with bisubstrate inhibitor CoA-S-acetyl-ARYFRR containing a peptide part mimicking the N-terminal peptide of S18 ribosomal protein was determined by Blanchard et al. (15Vetting M.W. Bareich D.C. Yu M. Blanchard J.S. Crystal structure of RimI from Salmonella typhimurium LT2, the GNAT responsible for N(alpha)-acetylation of ribosomal protein S18.Protein Sci. 2008; 17: 1781-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) previously. Interaction of RimI with S18 N-terminal peptide included several sequence-specific contacts, such as electrostatic interaction of Arg2 with Glu103 residue of RimI. The amino acid of the peptide inhibitor equivalent to Tyr4 of S18 interacts with Pro131 of RimI, whereas Phe4 formed Van der Waals contacts with Trp27, Thr31, Phe67, and Asn35 of RimI. Curiously, a comparison of the N-terminal peptides of S18 and EF-Tu revealed little resemblance. Of note is the fact that both proteins possess a small terminal amino acid, Ala1 in S18 and Ser1 in EF-Tu, whereas the second residue is positively charged, Arg2 in S18 and Lys2 in EF-Tu. Since protein N-terminal acetylation is considered to predetermine protein stability at least in eukaryotes (22Nguyen K.T. Mun S.-H. Lee C.-S. Hwang C.-S. Control of protein degradation by N-terminal acetylation and the N-end rule pathway.Exp. Mol. Med. 2018; 50: 91Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we decided to check whether acetylation of EF-Tu by RimI influences the stability of the factor. To this end, we used ΔrimI strain transformed by the plasmid coding for EF-Tu·His6 under the control of anhydrotetracycline-inducible Tet promoter. Expression of EF-Tu·His6 was switched on for 30 min at the early exponential growth phase (absorbance of 0.1 at 600 nm) followed by washing the cells with medium lacking inducer. The amount of EF-Tu·His6 in cells after cessation of expression was monitored by immunoblotting with anti-His6 antibodies (Fig. 3A) and revealed that acetylation does not alter EF-Tu stability. Finally, to assess the performance of unacetylated EF-Tu in partial reactions of protein biosynthesis, we used C-terminally His6-tagged factors purified from the WT (EF-Tu) and ΔrimI strains (EF-Tu-Ac). First, we questioned whether an interaction of aminoacylated tRNA with EF-Tu depends on the acetylation of the latter. Kinetics of the ternary complex formation by EF-Tu·GTP or EF-Tu-Ac·GTP with Phe-tRNAPhe has been studied by a stopped-flow experiment monitoring proflavine fluorescence of Phe-tRNAPhe(Prf16/17). The resultant fluorescence changes were fitted to single exponential curves (Fig. 4A). Linear fitting of the concentration dependence of apparent association rate constants (Fig. 4B) yielded indistinguishable within the error rate constants (kon = 1.8 ± 0.1 μM−1 s−1 for EF-Tu, kon = 1.7 ± 0.1 μM−1 s−1 for EF-Tu-Ac, koff were close to zero in both cases). Since within the structure of ternary EF-Tu·GTP–aminoacyl-tRNA complex (23Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S.R. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B.F.C. Nyborg J. Crystal structure of the ternary complex of Phe-tRNAPhe, EF-Tu, and a GTP analog.Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar), the aminoacylated 3′-terminal nucleotide of tRNA is located close to the N terminus of EF-Tu, we hypothesized that nonacetylated terminal amino group might facilitate aminoacyl-tRNA hydrolysis. To this end, we tested the stability of Val-tRNAVal and Phe-tRNAPhe in the complex with EF-Tu·GTP or EF-Tu-Ac·GTP with the help of filter-binding assay (Fig. 4, C and D). The hydrolysis time dependencies were fitted into single exponential curves. As expected, binding to the EF-Tu·GTP protected aminoacyl-tRNAs from spontaneous hydrolysis, but no significant difference in the spontaneous Val-tRNAVal or Phe-tRNAPhe hydrolysis in a complex with EF-Tu·GTP or EF-Tu-Ac·GTP has been detected. Next, we addressed the possible role of EF-Tu N-terminal acetylation in EF-Tu-dependent steps of translation on the ribosome. Initiation complexes programmed with mRNA coding for MVF (Met-Val-Phe) or MF (Met-Phe) peptides and containing fMet-tRNAfMet in the P-site were preformed with the complete set of translation initiation factors (IFs). Analysis of the dipeptide formation yield has been done at proportions of Val-tRNAVal to EF-Tu ranging from 1:1 to 1:4 (Fig. 5A). In all cases, dipeptide formation was almost quantitative. We did not observe any difference in dipeptide yield for the ternary complexes of either WT EF-Tu or EF-Tu-Ac. While the end points of dipeptide formation demonstrated no dependence on the acetylation of EF-Tu, we set up to determine whether rate constants of dipeptide formation, which reflects binding and accommodation rates of aminoacyl-tRNA brought to the ribosome by EF-Tu·GTP, might depend on EF-Tu modification. Millisecond resolution of automatic quench-flow mixing of initiation ribosomal complexes with Val-tRNAVal·EF-Tu·GTP or Val-tRNAVal·EF-Tu-Ac·GTP (Fig. 5B) allowed us to calculate the rate constants of the apparently biphasic dipeptide formation process. However, the rate constants kapp1 = 10 ± 2 s−1, kapp2 = 0.13 ± 0.03 s−1 for Val-tRNAVal·EF-Tu·GTP and kapp1 = 10 ± 1 s−1, kapp2 = 0.09 ± 0.02 s−1 for Val-tRNAVal·EF-Tu-Ac·GTP were found to be the same within the error limits. In addition, we used a stop flow fluorescence detection assay to monitor movements of the Phe-tRNAPhe(Prf16/17) brought to the ribosome with the vacant A-site in a form of either Phe-tRNAPhe(Prf16/17)·EF-Tu·GTP or Phe-tRNAPhe(Prf16/17)·EF-Tu-Ac·GTP (Fig. 5C). An increase in a characteristic biphasic fluorescence change represents the following steps: initial binding of the ternary complex to the ribosome and subsequent codon reading and recognition, which induces GTPase activation and results in GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu. The subsequent decay of the high fluorescence intermediate is related to the release of tRNA from the GDP-bound form of EF-Tu and accommodation of the tRNA in the A site of the ribosome (24Pape T. Complete kinetic mechanism of elongation factor Tu-dependent binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site of the E. coli ribosome.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7490-7497Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Two exponential fitting of the fluorescence curves allowed us to deduce the rate constants of ternary complex binding and A-site accommodation for a number of concentrations of the initiation complexes (Fig. 5D). Interestingly, we have observed that acetylated form of EF-Tu performs slightly better ensuring faster delivery of aminoacyl-tRNA to the translating ribosome (k1 = 37 ± 3 s−1 for EF-Tu and k1 = 30 ± 2 s−1 for EF-Tu-Ac). At the same time, the rates of tRNA accommodation were the same for both variants of EF-Tu (k2 = 17 ± 1 s−1 for EF-Tu and k2 = 19 ± 2 s−1 for EF-Tu-Ac). Finally, to assess whether acetylation of EF-Tu that mildly increases the rate of aminoacyl-tRNA delivery to the ribosome confers advantage to bacterial protein biosynthesis, we monitored the growth curves of the WT and ΔrimI strains (Fig. 6, A–D). Application of this assay revealed a moderate growth disadvantage of the ΔrimI strain. While the difference is small in rich medium (LB) (Fig. 6A), in the minimal medium, growth defects become more pronounced (Fig. 6, B–D). In a large timescale, growth advantage granted by the system of S18 and EF-Tu acetylation would lead to the fixation of this trait in bacterial population. To prove this assumption, we performed a growth competition assay (Fig. 6E). Equal numbers of the kanamycin-sensitive parental strain cells and kanamycin-resistant ΔrimI strain cells were mixed and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in M9 minimal medium supplemented with glucose (0.4%). At the end of the growth cycle, 1/1000th of the medium containing the mixture of the cells was used for inoculation of the fresh portion M9 medium at 1000 times of dilution. After each growth cycle, the cells were serially diluted and plated on either LB agar or LB agar plates supplemented with kanamycin. The increase of WT to ΔrimI cells ratio in the mixture was slow, but detectable, and suggests that knockout of rimI compromises cell fitness. Beneficial influence of RimI activity on cell growth may explain nearly universal presence of rimI gene in bacterial genomes (25Christensen D.G. Meyer J.G. Baumgartner J.T. D'Souza A.K. Nelson W.C. Payne S.H. Kuhn M.L. Schilling B. Wolfe A.J. Identification of novel protein lysine acetyltransferases in Escherichia coli.mBio. 2018; 9: e01905-e01918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we suggest that EF-Tu acetylation accelerates tRNA arrival to the A-site of the ribosome that finally results in improvement of bacterial growth rate, which is especially evident for the growth in poor media when aminoacyl-tRNA availability might be limiting. However, it should be noted that it is difficult to estimate the direct impact of EF-Tu acetylation on cell fitness, since RimI is responsible for modification of S18 as well. It is most likely that the absence of acetylation on both S18 and EF-Tu may contribute to the observed growth defects in ΔrimI strain. E. coli strain BW25113 (21Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L.

E. coli strains were grown at 37 °C in LB medium and supplied with 50 μg/ml kanamycin if required. For the measurement of growth curves, LB or M9 minimal medium was inoculated by a single colony of either the WT or ΔrimI strains and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The culture was diluted to absorbance of 0.01 at 600 nm (final culture volume of 400 μl) with fresh LB or M9 minimal medium and grown at 37 °C for 12 h in 24-well microtiter plates with constant shaking at 200 rpm. The absorbance at 600 nm of culture was measured every 40 min. M9 minimal medium was supplemented with either glucose (0.4%), glycerol (0.4%), or sodium acetate (0.4%). A growth competition experiment was performed using M9 medium supplemented with glucose (0.4%) at 37 °C. Equal amounts of kanamycin-sensitive BW25141 parental strain and kanamycin-resistant ΔrimI deletion strain cells were used for simultaneous inoculation of M9 medium. At each 24 h growth cycle, the medium was diluted 1000-fold. At the same time, serial dilutions of the bacterial culture were made until a dilution of 10−7 was reached. Equal 5 μl aliquots from the diluted cultures were plated to LB agar and LB agar supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml). Plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight, and the colonies were counted and compared. To track EF-Tu stability over time, DNA sequence coding for EF-Tu·His6 under control of anhydrotetracycline-inducible Tet promoter was cloned (26Bond S.R. Naus C.C.

Briefly, E. coli cells were lysed with 2D sample buffer (1 M Tris–HCl [pH 8.5], 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% [w/v] CHAPS), 50 μg of total protein was labeled with Cy2 or Cy5 (Lumiprobe) and applied for isoelectric focusing on a self-prepared nonlinear pH gradient (pH 3.5–9.5) gel. The second dimension was performed with gradient (8–16%) gels. For the recombinant EF-Tu purification, 10 μl overnight cultures of the WT BW25113 or JW4335 ΔrimI strains transformed with the EF-Tu·His6 IPTG-inducible pCA24N plasmid were used for inoculation of the 500 ml LB with 0.34 g/l chloramphenicol. At an absorbance of 0.7 at 600 nm, expression of EF-Tu gene was induced by 1 mM IPTG (final concentrations are given throughout the article).

NTs from the major ampullate spidroin (MaSp) and the minor ampullate spidroin are monomeric at neutral pH and confer solubility to spidroins, whereas at lower pH, they dimerize to interconnect spidroins in a fiber. This dimerization is known to result from modulation of electrostatic interactions by protonation of well-conserved glutamates, although it is undetermined if this mechanism applies to other spidroin types as well. Here, we determine the solution and crystal structures of the flagelliform spidroin NT, which shares only 35% identity with MaSp NT, and investigate the mechanisms of its dimerization. We show that flagelliform spidroin NT is structurally similar to MaSp NT and that the electrostatic intermolecular interaction between Asp 40 and Lys 65 residues is conserved. However, the protonation events involve a different set of residues than in MaSp, indicating that an overall mechanism of pH-dependent dimerization is conserved but can be mediated by different pathways in different silk types.

Spider silk has outstanding mechanical properties that surpass man-made materials and represents an attractive material for many potential applications. Orb-weaving spiders are able to synthesize up to seven types of silk for various purposes, including major ampullate, minor ampullate, flagelliform, aciniform, aggregate, tubiliform and pyriform silk (1Peakall D.B. Synthesis of silk, mechanism and location.Am. Zool. 1969; 9: 71-79Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Each type of silk is produced in a dedicated gland from highly specialized polymer building blocks consisting of large proteins (spidroins). Dragline or major ampullate silk is the strongest silk type and makes up the framework of the web or is used as a safety line by the spider (2Gosline J.M. Guerette P.A. Ortlepp C.S. Savage K.N. The mechanical design of spider silks: From fibroin sequence to mechanical function.J. Exp. Biol. 1999; 202: 3295-3303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Detailed studies of the morphology of the major ampullate gland, where this silk is produced, have identified three distinct regions: a narrow long tail where spidroins are synthesized, a bulb-like ampulla (sac) where spidroins are stored, and a narrowing s-shaped duct where different biochemical stimuli, including shear forces and a pH drop, convert spidroins into silk fibers during spinning (3Bell A.L.

The minor ampullate silk is used by the spider to strengthen the web, and the corresponding gland closely resembles the major ampullate gland although the size is smaller. The flagelliform silk is the most extensible form of silk and forms the thread in the capture spiral of the web. The flagelliform gland differs from the ampullate glands by being much smaller in size and by having a very short spinning duct (7Chaw R.C. Cheryl Y.H. Dissection of silk glands in the Western black widow Latrodectus hesperus.J. Arachnol. 2018; 46: 159-161Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). It is possible that the short duct of this gland provides environmental conditions different from the ampullate glands, for example a sharper or shorter pH gradient, but the biochemical events driving silk formation in the flagelliform gland have not been investigated in detail. Spidroins harbor up to several thousand residues (8Ayoub N.A. Garb J.E. Tinghitella R.M. Collin M.A. Hayashi C.Y.

They are made up of highly repetitive and silk-specific parts, which determine the mechanical properties of the fibers, flanked by conserved N- and C- terminal globular domains, which regulate silk formation (9Babb P.L.

On the other hand, during transit through the duct where the pH is gradually lowered, dimerization of NT contributes to fiber assembly by interconnecting spidroins (18Askarieh G. Hedhammar M.

In the dimerization process of MaSp NT, the aspartic acid (Asp) 40 and lysine (Lys) 65 are particularly important. They mediate the initial association of monomer subunits which alters local environments of certain acidic residues and increases their respective pKa. In the dimer, Asp 40 and Lys 65 form an intermolecular salt bridge (24Wallace J.A. Shen J.K. Unraveling a trap-and-trigger mechanism in the pH-sensitive self-assembly of spider silk proteins.J. Phys.

Two Glu residues that become protonated in MaSp NT are conserved in MiSp NT, but Glu 84 is substituted by serine and the nearby Glu 73 (corresponding to Glu 76 in Fig. 1A) is instead protonated during MiSp NT dimerization. Similar observations were made in the characterization of MaSp NT from Latrodectus hesperus, but the protonating residues could not be identified (14Bauer J. Schaal D. Eisoldt L. Schweimer K.

Biol. 2012; 422: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) show that Glu 73 and Glu 84 are located in different parts of the molecule. In MiSp NT, Glu 73 is located in helix 3 close to the center of the dimer interface, whereas Glu 84 in MaSp NT is located in the loop between helix 3 and helix 4. Like MaSp NT, MiSp NT has a Trp that is wedged between helix 1 and 3 in the monomer and changes its fluorescence emission in association with dimerization. Trp 10 is conserved in most of the spidroin NTs, but interestingly, Trp is not present in any of the NTs from flagelliform spidroins (FlSps) (Fig. S1). In FlSp NT, the corresponding residue is replaced by phenylalanine (Phe) or leucine (Leu) except in the species Steatoda grossa where it is replaced by a tyrosine (Tyr). The more hydrophobic nature of Phe and Leu, compared to Trp (36Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. A simple method for displaying the hydropathic character of a protein.J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16899) Google Scholar, 37Hessa T. Kim H. Bihlmaier K. Lundin C. Boekel J. Andersson H. Nilsson I. White S.H. von Heijne G. Recognition of transmembrane helices by the endoplasmic reticulum translocon.Nature. 2005; 433: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar), suggests that there is a higher energetic penalty for them to relocate and become exposed to a polar environment during dimerization. Nephila clavipes FlSp NT shares only about 35% residue identity with E. australis MaSp NT but still contains all the conserved residues involved in protonation in MaSp NT (Fig. 1A), which raises the question whether the dimerization is conserved also in this divergent NT. Herein, we determine the solution NMR and X-ray crystal structures of WT FlSp NT and investigate the dimerization behavior for the WT protein. We also construct FlSp NT mutants that based on MaSp NT data may behave as constitutive monomers or dimers, respectively, as well as Phe 11 to Trp mutants (corresponding to MaSp Trp 10, Fig. 1B), and use size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) with or without multiangle light scattering (MALS), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), circular dichroism (CD), and NMR spectroscopy to study the effects of these mutations on the structure and ability to form dimers. The structures of WT FlSp NT in its monomeric and dimeric conformation were solved by NMR spectroscopy. The polypeptide chain conformation was well defined for most residues, except for the NT tail (residues 1–10) and loop between helices 2 and 3. The X-ray crystal structure of FlSp NT dimer was also solved and contained a single dimer in crystallographic asymmetric unit. The model could be built for most of the protein, excluding NT residues 1 to 9 in subunit A and 1 to 11 in subunit B, C-terminal residue of subunit A and loop, including residues 55 to 59 of subunit A. All the obtained structures were compared to WT MaSp NT in order to determine the overall structural similarity and to identify structural differences for the key residues. The structure of the FlSp NT monomer solved at pH 7.2 (PDB ID: 7A0I, this work) shows a high similarity to the structure of monomeric MaSp NT (PDB ID: 2LPJ) as reflected by the RMSD value of 1.84 Å for the polypeptide backbone calculated over 113 residues (Figs. 2A and S2A). The main difference to MaSp NT is the length of helix 2, which is eight residues shorter in FlSp NT. Additionally, the loop between helix 2 and 3 is three residues longer, and the loop between helix 4 and 5 is three residues shorter in FlSp NT. Phe 11 is wedged between helix 1 and helix 3 in the same orientation as Trp 10 in MaSp NT. As observed in the other characterized NT domains, the charged residues of FlSp NT have a dipolar distribution with clusters of opposite charges at each end (Fig. 2B). Arg 59, Lys 57, Lys 63, Lys 65, and Lys 67 cluster at one pole of the protein while Glu 40, Asp 41, Asp 43, Asp 44, Glu 79, and Glu 84 cluster at the other end. However, FlSp NT has a higher number of charged residues (25 against 11 for MaSp NT), and the distribution is not strictly dipolar since charges are also dispersed in the center of the molecule. Two of the conserved residues that become protonated during dimerization of MaSp NT (Glu 79 and Glu 119) show the corresponding localization in FlSp NT. The structures of the FlSp NT dimer solved by solution NMR and by X-ray crystallography at pH 5.5 (PDB IDs: 7A0O and 7OOM, this work) reveal an antiparallel homodimer similar to the structure of the MaSp NT dimer (PDB ID: 2LTH) as suggested by the RMSD values of 3.8 Å and 3.5 Å, respectively, for the polypeptide backbone calculated over 230 residues (Figs. 3A and S2B). The corresponding RMSD between the NMR and X-ray structures of FlSp NT dimer is 1.4 Å. The helices have comparable orientations to those in MaSp NT, and the side chains are mostly pointing in the same direction. As observed in MaSp NT, Glu 79 and Glu 119 of FlSp NT are buried at the dimer interface; however, both are involved in salt bridge or hydrogen bonding interactions with Lys 67 and Gln 70, respectively. Therefore, neutralization of these residues upon pH-driven dimerization may not stabilize the dimer by reducing electrostatic repulsion between the subunits. In the NMR structure, Glu 84 is solvent exposed as in MaSp NT, suggesting that it fulfills a similar role in both domains. Glu 130 is facing a cluster of negative charges (Glu 115, Glu 119, and Asp 122) present at the dimer interface, which could lead to the elevation of its pKa value and its subsequent protonation to alleviate electrostatic repulsion during dimer formation. The high-resolution X-ray structure reveals more details on pH-dependent interactions between acidic residues of monomers (Fig. 3B). The most obvious such interaction occurs among Asp 122 and Glu 130 of both subunits. This interaction is possible only at low pH and requires that at least one of the acidic residues—presumably Glu 130—is protonated. Another notable contact occurs among Glu 84 and Asp 41 of the same subunit, described previously as “handshake interaction” in MaSp NT (18Askarieh G. Hedhammar M. Nordling K. Saenz A. Casals C. Rising A. Johansson J. Knight S.D. Self-assembly of spider silk proteins is controlled by a pH-sensitive relay.Nature. 2010; 465: 236-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C). This interaction in turn may alter the relative placement of α-helices and favor necessary interactions between monomers, such as salt bridge formation among Glu 40 and Arg 59 of the other subunit. However, this salt bridge is present only in one side of the dimer, since the loop, including Arg 59 is disordered in the other monomer of our crystal structure. The intersubunit salt bridge formed between Asp 40 and Lys 65 in MaSp NT is also present between Asp 41 and Lys 65 in FlSp NT and an additional interaction between Asp 44 and Lys 65 was identified. Interestingly, Phe 11 does not swing out upon dimerization, but its side chain is less well defined implying increased dynamics in the dimer (Figs. 3D and S2C). The ability of MaSp and MiSp NT to dimerize as a function of pH can be conveniently monitored by Trp fluorescence spectroscopy since Trp 10 undergoes changes in environmental conditions upon dimerization (11Ries J.

However, there remain gaps in our understanding of what helps IOCs function, as well as how and why contextual elements affect their implementation. A realist review of evidence drawing on 86 sources has sought to elicit and refine context-mechanism-outcome configurations (CMOCs) to understand and refine these phenomena, yet further understanding can be gained from interviewing those involved in developing IOCs.We used a realist evaluation methodology, adopting prior realist synthesis findings as a theoretical framework that we sought to refine. We drew on 32 interviews taking place between January 2020 and May 2021 with 29 stakeholders comprising IOC case studies, service users, as well as regulatory perspectives in England. Using a retroductive analysis approach, we aimed to test CMOCs against these data to explore whether previously identified mechanisms, CMOCs, and causal links between them were affirmed, refuted, or revised, and refine our explanations of how and why interorganisational collaborations are successful.Most of our prior CMOCs and their underlying mechanisms were supported in the interview findings with a diverse range of evidence. Leadership behaviours, including showing vulnerability and persuasiveness, acted to shape the core mechanisms of collaborative functioning. These included our prior mechanisms of trust, faith, and confidence, which were largely ratified with minor refinements. Action statements were formulated, translating theoretical findings into practical guidance.As the fifth stage in a larger project, our refined theory provides a comprehensive understanding of the causal chain leading to effective collaborative inter-organisational relationships. These findings and recommendations can support implementation of IOCs in the UK and elsewhere. Future research should translate these findings into further practical guidance for implementers, researchers, and policymakers."

Originally discovered in mice as interferon-γ-inducing factor, Interleukin-18 (IL-18) was found to be a potent inducer of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production in synergy with IL-12 upon exposure to intracellular pathogens (1Okamura H.

It was subsequently cloned and identified as an 18-kDa cytokine belonging to the IL-1 cytokine family and renamed to IL-18 (4Ushio S. Namba M. Okura T. Hattori K. Nukada Y. Akita K. Tanabe F.

Similar to other IL-1 family cytokines, IL-18 is expressed as an inactive precursor protein that requires cleavage by caspase-1 for full biological activity (5Ghayur T. Banerjee S. Hugunin M.

While approximately 80% of pro-IL-18 is retained intracellularly, the rest is released by macrophages/monocytes and dendritic cells after maturation by caspase-1 (7Dinarello C.A.

Mature IL-18 initiates signaling by establishing a tripartite complex with IL-18 receptor alpha (IL-18Rα) and IL-18 receptor beta (IL-18Rβ), the latter also known as IL-18 receptor accessory protein and IL-1R7. The heterodimerization of the receptors’ intracellular Toll/IL-1 receptor domains triggers recruitment of the adapter protein myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), which further activates the downstream signaling cascade through IRAK-1/4, TRAF6, and NFκB (9Medzhitov R.

Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) processing pathway.Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: cm2PubMed Google Scholar). IL-18 is mainly involved in the activation of NK and T helper 1 cells and IFN-γ production in response to intracellular bacteria or viruses (13Dinarello C.A.

Immunol. 2013; 4: 289Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Due to its highly proinflammatory and pleiotropic activity, IL-18 signaling is highly regulated at many levels to prevent uncontrolled inflammation. Akin to other IL-1 family cytokines, this regulation is achieved through gene regulation (15Tone M. Thompson S.A. Tone Y. Fairchild P.J. Waldmann H.

Once IL-18 is activated and released from immune cells, its availability is mainly regulated by sequestration by IL-18-binding protein (IL-18BP), a dedicated soluble decoy receptor-like protein capable of blocking the biological activity of IL-18 (17Novick D. Kim S.-H. Fantuzzi G. Reznikov L.L. Dinarello C.A. Rubinstein M.

Even though IL-18BP functions as a decoy receptor, it is not homologous to any extracellular domain of the IL-18 receptors and is encoded as a separate gene (18Novick D. Kim S. Kaplanski G. Dinarello C.A. Interleukin-18, more than a Th1 cytokine.Semin. Immunol. 2013; 25: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), an oddity in the cytokine field (19Felix J. Savvides S.N.

However, bioinformatic approaches have proposed that IL-18BP is evolutionary related to TIGIRR-1 (aka IL-1R9) and is thus regarded as a member of the IL-1 receptor family. In addition, sequence and functional homology lead to the identification of IL-18BP orthologs in all orthopox viruses (20Xiang Y. Moss B.

Intriguingly, the affinity of viral IL-18BPs for human IL-18 is considerably lower than human IL-18BP (KD ∼ 1 nM), although they display picomolar affinity toward mouse IL-18 (25Calderara S. Xiang Y. Moss B. Orthopoxvirus Il-18 binding proteins: Affinities and antagonist activities.Virology. 2001; 279: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As a result, IL-18 is sequestered by IL-18BP under homeostatic conditions, thereby preventing it from signaling through its receptors and evoking unwanted proinflammatory responses. Interestingly, IL-18-induced IFN-γ upregulates IL-18BP expression, creating a negative feedback loop to dampen and resolve inflammation (27Mühl H. Kämpfer H. Bosmann M. Frank S. Radeke H.

To aid further advancements in the mechanistic interrogation of IL-18 sequestration by IL-18BP and the therapeutic targeting of hIL-18 and hIL-18BP in infectious diseases, inflammation, and cancer, structural details of their complex and of interaction interface to high resolution would be opportune. Here, we present the crystal structure of human IL-18 in complex with human IL-18BP. This study shows that hIL-18BP binds hIL-18 at the same epitope as IL-18Rα and viral IL-18BPs using a large hydrophobic patch flanked by two tightly fitting hydrophobic pockets complemented by salt bridges. A crucial advance in our crystallization efforts was the elimination of the flexible N-terminus and minimization of heterogenous glycosylation patterns of hIL-18BP while retaining functional and biological activity. Moreover, we discovered a novel disulfide-linked interface resulting in an unexpected tetrameric assembly of hIL-18 and hIL-18BP. The structural model presented here is imperative to validate previous models, map key differences between human and viral orthologs of IL-18BP, and allows advancements in the design of novel inhibitors or antagonists. To enable structural studies of the human IL-18BP:IL-18 complex by X-ray crystallography, we initially considered clinical grade human IL-18BP (Tadekinig alfa) that was used in a phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IL-18BP in AOSD (43Gabay C. Fautrel B. Rech J. Spertini F. Feist E. Kötter I. Hachulla E. Morel J. Schaeverbeke T. Hamidou M.A. Martin T. Hellmich B. Lamprecht P. Schulze-Koops H.

Dis. 2018; 77: 840-847PubMed Google Scholar). However, due to the extensive glycosylation of this protein and the need to create glycan-engineered protein amenable to structural studies by X-ray crystallography, we produced full-length hIL-18BP in transiently transfected HEK293S MGAT1−/− cells allowing for N-linked glycosylation as Man5GlcNAc2 glycans (49Reeves P.J.

Using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and in-line multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS), we found that full-length hIL-18BP was heavily glycosylated with nearly 50% of its mass accounted for by glycans (Fig. 1A and Table 1), consistent with predictions (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the distribution of mass across the SEC-MALLS peak for full-length hIL-18BP, the diffuse electrophoretic mobility of the purified protein in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, A and B), and large shifts in mass upon treatment with endoglucanases and O-glycosidases suggested heterogeneous glycosylation.

Commun. 2016; 7: 13228Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we reasoned that this most likely originates from O-glycans and possible differences in N- and O-glycosylation site occupancy. Initial crystallization trials using purified hIL-18BPFL:IL-18 complex containing glycan-shaved hIL-18BPFL and displaying apparent stoichiometry of 1:1 as evaluated by SEC-MALLS did not lead to candidate crystallization conditions even when employing hIL-18BPFL:IL-18 complex up to 30 mg/ml. Such apparent high solubility during crystallization trials was deemed to be consistent with the observed extensive and heterogeneous glycosylation of hIL-18BPFL (Fig. 1A and Table 1). Therefore, we sought to produce alternative versions of hIL-18BP that would be more amenable to structural studies.

The tested hybrid systems consist of two different blocks, first for maternal component estimation and second, so-called adaptive block, for maternal component suppression by means of an adaptive algorithm (AA). Herein, we tested and optimized four different AAs: Adaptive Linear Neuron (ADALINE), Standard Least Mean Squares (LMS), Sign-Error LMS, Standard Recursive Least Squares (RLS), and Fast Transversal Filter (FTF). The main criterion for optimal parameter selection was the F1 parameter. We conducted experiments using real signals from publicly available databases and those acquired by our own measurements. Our optimization method enabled us to find the corresponding optimal settings for individual adaptive block of all tested hybrid systems which improves achieved results. These improvements in turn could lead to a more accurate fetal heart rate monitoring and detection of fetal hypoxia. Consequently, our approach could offer the potential to be used in clinical practice to find optimal adaptive filter settings for extracting high quality fetal ECG signals for further processing and analysis, opening new diagnostic possibilities of non-invasive fetal electrocardiography."

Here, we show that somatostatin (SOM) interneurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) become active specifically during learned non-threatening cues and desynchronize cell firing by blocking phase reset of theta oscillations during the safe cue. Furthermore, we show that SOM activation and desynchronization of the BLA is PL-dependent and promotes discrimination of non-threat. Thus, fear discrimination engages PL-dependent coordination of BLA SOM responses to non-threatening stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W4223517369,"The fat mass and obesity-associated FTO protein catalyzes demethylation of the N6-methyladenosine, an epigenetic mark that controls several metabolic pathways by modulating the transcription, translation, and cellular localization of RNA molecules. Since the discovery that its overexpression links to the development of obesity and cancer, FTO was the target of screening campaigns and structure-based drug design efforts. Although several FTO inhibitors were generated, these often lack potency or selectivity. Herein, we investigate the structure and dynamics of human FTO in solution. We show that the structure of the catalytic N-terminal domain is unstable in the absence of the C-terminal domain, which explains why the isolated N-terminal domain is incompetent for catalysis and suggests that the domain interaction represents a target for the development of specific inhibitors. Then, by using NMR relaxation measurements, we show that the interface between the FTO structural domains, the active site, and several peripheral loops undergo conformational dynamics on both the picosecond-nanosecond and microsecond-millisecond timescales. Consistent with this, we found that the backbone amide residual dipolar couplings measured for FTO in phage pf1 are inconsistent with the static crystal structure of the enzyme. Finally, we generated a conformational ensemble for apo FTO that satisfies the solution NMR data by combining the experimental residual dipolar couplings with accelerated molecular dynamics simulations. Altogether, the structural ensemble reported in this work provides an atomic-resolution model of apo FTO and reveals transient surface pockets at the domain interface that represent potential targets for the design of allosteric inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W4223442101,"In recent years, literatures identified childbirth as a potentially traumatic experience resulting in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with 19.7 to 45.5% of women perceiving their childbirth as traumatic. A substantial variation in PTSD symptoms has been also indicated among women who experience a traumatic childbirth. However, there has been no research that has systematically investigated these patterns and their underlying determinants in postpartum women in Ethiopia.The aim of this study was to investigate the trajectories of PTSD symptoms and mediating relationships of variables associated with it among postpartum women in Northwest Ethiopia.A total of 775 women were recruited after childbirth and were followed at the 6th, 12th and 18th week of postpartum period during October, 2020 -March, 2021. A group-based trajectory modeling and mediation analysis using KHB method were carried out using Stata version 16 software in order to determine the trajectories of PTSD symptoms and mediation percentage of each mediator on the trajectories of PTSD symptoms.Four distinct trajectories of postpartum posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were identified. Perceived traumatic childbirth, fear of childbirth, depression, anxiety, psychological violence, higher WHODAS 2.0 total score, multigravidity, stressful life events of health risk, relational problems and income instability were found to be predictors of PTSD with recovery and chronic PTSD trajectory group membership. Depression and anxiety not only were strongly related to trajectories of PTSD symptoms directly but also mediated much of the effect of the other factors on trajectories of PTSD symptoms. In contrast, multiparity and higher mental quality of life scores were protective of belonging to the PTSD with recovery and chronic PTSD trajectory group membership.Women with symptoms of depression, anxiety, fear of childbirth and perceived traumatic childbirth were at increased risk of belonging to recovered and chronic PTSD trajectories. Postnatal screening and treatment of depression and anxiety may contribute to decrease PTSD symptoms of women in the postpartum period. Providing adequate information about birth procedures and response to mothers' needs during childbirth and training of health care providers to be mindful of factors that contribute to negative appraisals of childbirth are essential to reduce fear of childbirth and traumatic childbirth so as to prevent PTSD symptoms in the postpartum period."

Here, using an MPC-specific fluorescent reporter system (PAX7::GFP), we demonstrate that hPSC-derived MPCs can contribute to the regeneration of myofibers in mice following local injury and in mice deficient of dystrophin (mdx). We also demonstrate that a subset of PAX7::GFP MPCs engraft within the basal lamina of regenerated myofibers, adopt a quiescent state, and contribute to regeneration upon reinjury and in mdx mouse models. This subset of PAX7::GFP MPCs undergo a maturation process and remodel their molecular characteristics to resemble those of late-stage fetal MPCs/adult satellite cells following in vivo engraftment. These in-vivo-matured PAX7::GFP MPCs retain a cell-autonomous ability to regenerate and can repopulate in the niche of secondary recipient mice, providing a proof of principle for future hPSC-based cell therapy for muscle disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4223476712,"Farmland is a key resource for safeguarding the regional food security and social stability, particularly in Tibet where the farmland is very limited due to its high altitude. With quick economic development during recent decades, farmland changes are great in China, and thus have been extensively studied. These studies generally focused on eastern regions, and seldom for Tibet due to the lack of good quality and available data. To this end, taking the Three River Region (TRR) as the case area, this study obtained 1 m spatial resolution farmland data for 2000 and 2018 by visual interpretation of the Google Earth high resolution satellite images, and then analyzed the farmland change, its driving factors and impact on grain production between 2000 and 2018. The results showed that farmland in the TRR decreased by 8.85% from 219.29 k ha in 2000 to 199.89 k ha in 2018, averagely reduced by 0.51% per year, mainly driven by the economic development, agricultural progress, urbanization, and population growth. The farmland losses largely occurred in urban areas and their surrounding counties due to urban land occupation, and caused the grain production reduced by 9.38%. To control the quick farmland losses and to ensure the regional food security of Tibet, it should strengthen the supervision on non-agricultural occupation of farmland and increase agricultural investment to improve the land productivity in the TRR."
https://openalex.org/W4223500345,"In the glucose-rich milieu of red blood cells, asexually replicating malarial parasites mainly rely on glycolysis for ATP production, with limited carbon flux through the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. By contrast, gametocytes and mosquito-stage parasites exhibit an increased dependence on the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation for more economical energy generation. Prior genetic studies supported these stage-specific metabolic preferences by revealing that six of eight TCA cycle enzymes are completely dispensable during the asexual blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum, with only fumarate hydratase (FH) and malate-quinone oxidoreductase (MQO) being refractory to deletion. Several hypotheses have been put forth to explain the possible essentiality of FH and MQO, including their participation in a malate shuttle between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytosol. However, using newer genetic techniques like CRISPR and dimerizable Cre, we were able to generate deletion strains of FH and MQO in P. falciparum. We employed metabolomic analyses to characterize a double knockout mutant of FH and MQO (ΔFM) and identified changes in purine salvage and urea cycle metabolism that may help to limit fumarate accumulation. Correspondingly, we found that the ΔFM mutant was more sensitive to exogenous fumarate, which is known to cause toxicity by modifying and inactivating proteins and metabolites. Overall, our data indicate that P. falciparum is able to adequately compensate for the loss of FH and MQO, rendering them unsuitable targets for drug development."

Additionally, the versatility of this test allows its application in virtually every laboratory setting and remote location where access to expensive laboratory equipment is a limiting factor for testing during pandemic crises."
https://openalex.org/W4223471113,"The cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) plays a critical role in controlling the immune homeostasis by regulating the proliferation and differentiation of immune cells, especially T cells. IL-2 signaling is mediated via the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) complex, which consists of the IL-2Rα (CD25), the IL-2Rβ, and the IL-2Rγ. While the latter are required for signal transduction, IL-2Rα controls the ligand-binding affinity of the receptor complex. A soluble form of the IL-2Rα (sIL-2Rα) is found constitutively in human serum, though its levels are increased under various pathophysiological conditions. The sIL-2Rα originates partly from activated T cells through proteolytic cleavage, but neither the responsible proteases nor stimuli that lead to IL-2Rα cleavage are known. Here, we show that the metalloproteases ADAM10 and ADAM17 can cleave the IL-2Rα and generate a soluble ectodomain, which functions as a decoy receptor that inhibits IL-2 signaling in T cells. We demonstrate that ADAM10 is mainly responsible for constitutive shedding of the IL-2Rα, while ADAM17 is involved in IL-2Rα cleavage upon T cell activation. In vivo, we found that mice with a CD4-specific deletion of ADAM10, but not ADAM17, show reduced steady-state sIL-2Rα serum levels. We propose that the identification of proteases involved in sIL-2Rα generation will allow for manipulation of IL-2Rα cleavage, especially as constitutive and induced cleavage of IL-2Rα are executed by different proteases, and thus offer a novel opportunity to alter IL-2 function."
https://openalex.org/W4223480264,"Neurotoxic amyloid β-peptides are thought to be a causative agent of Alzheimer's disease in humans. The production of amyloid β-peptides from amyloid precursor protein (APP) could be diminished by enhancing α-processing; however, the physical interactions between APP and α-secretases are not well understood. In this study, we employed super-resolution light microscopy to examine in cell-free plasma membranes the abundance and association of APP and α-secretases ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) and ADAM17. We found that both secretase molecules localize similarly closely to APP (within ≤50 nm). However, when cross-linking APP with antibodies directed against the GFP tag of APP, in confocal microscopy, we observed that only ADAM10 coaggregated with APP. Furthermore, we mapped the involved protein domain by using APP variants with an exchanged transmembrane segment or lacking cytoplasmic/extracellular domains. We identified that the transmembrane domain of APP is required for association with α-secretases and, as analyzed by Western blot, for α-processing. We propose that the transmembrane domain of APP interacts either directly or indirectly with ADAM10, but not with ADAM17, explaining the dominant role of ADAM10 in α-processing of APP. Further understanding of this interaction may facilitate the development of a therapeutic strategy based on promoting APP cleavage by α-secretases."
https://openalex.org/W4223507355,"Many pathogenic bacteria secrete AB5 toxins that can be virulence factors. Cytotoxic A subunits are delivered to the cytosol following B subunit binding to specific host cell surface glycans. Some B subunits are not associated with A subunits, for example, YpeB of Yersinia pestis, the etiologic agent of plague. Plague cannot be eradicated because of Y. pestis' adaptability to numerous hosts. We previously showed selective binding of other B5 pentamers to a sialoglycan microarray, with sialic acid (Sia) preferences corresponding to those prominently expressed by various hosts, for example, N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac; prominent in humans) or N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc; prominent in ruminant mammals and rodents). Here, we report that A subunit phylogeny evolved independently of B subunits and suggest a future B subunit nomenclature based on bacterial species names. We also found via phylogenetic analysis of B subunits, which bind Sias, that homologous molecules show poor correlation with species phylogeny. These data indicate ongoing lateral gene transfers between species, including mixing of A and B subunits. Consistent with much broader host range of Y. pestis, we show that YpeB recognizes all mammalian Sia types, except for 4-O-acetylated ones. Notably, YpeB alone causes dose-dependent cytotoxicity, which is abolished by a mutation (Y77F) eliminating Sia recognition, suggesting that cell proliferation and death are promoted via lectin-like crosslinking of cell surface sialoglycoconjugates. These findings help explain the host range of Y. pestis and could be important for pathogenesis.

Secreted bacterial AB5 toxins are an important class of virulence factors, named after their unique architecture, typically comprising a single catalytically active toxic A subunit and pentameric B subunits (1Beddoe T.

Such AB5 toxins classically exert effects on host cells via two steps: the five B subunits form a ring-shaped pentamer responsible for binding host cell glycans and mediating uptake of holotoxin; this is followed by inhibition of host cellular functions mediated by toxic effects of the A subunit. Some of these toxins are known to recognize specific sialylated glycan moieties on target cells through a glycan-binding pocket in their B subunit (4Deng L. Song J. Gao X. Wang J. Yu H. Chen X.

A notable exception is Shiga toxin (Stx), which binds globo series of glycolipids (1Beddoe T. Paton A.W. Le Nours J. Rossjohn J. Paton J.C. Structure, biological functions and applications of the AB5 toxins.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 411-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). AB5 toxins are typically classified and named based on the catalytic activity of their A subunits. The cholera toxin family includes Ctx and Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxins (LTs), LT-I and LT-II (8van den Akker F. Sarfaty S. Twiddy E.M. Connell T.D. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G. Crystal structure of a new heat-labile enterotoxin, LT-IIb.Structure. 1996; 4: 665-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a less-well characterized toxin from Campylobacter jejuni. All these toxins have A subunits with ADP-ribosylation activities targeting an arginine of Gsα (the α subunit of the stimulatory trimeric G protein) (1Beddoe T. Paton A.W. Le Nours J. Rossjohn J. Paton J.C. Structure, biological functions and applications of the AB5 toxins.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 411-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Pertussis toxin (Ptx) produced by Bordetella pertussis (the causative agent of whooping cough) has a catalytic subunit with similar ADP-ribosylase activity but is placed in a separate family because in contrast to all the other AB5 toxins, its B subunit is heteropentameric rather than homopentameric (9Locht C. Antoine R. A proposed mechanism of ADP-ribosylation catalyzed by the pertussis toxin S1 subunit.Biochimie. 1995; 77: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A further AB5 toxin variant (referred to as Plt [Pertussis-like toxin] or typhoid toxin) is produced by the typhoid fever–causing agent Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. Plt has an A subunit (PltA) with ADP-ribosylase activity and a homopentameric B subunit (PltB), which collectively act as a delivery vehicle for an additional toxic subunit related to cytolethal distending toxin, resulting in a novel A2B5 architecture (6Song J. Gao X. Galán J.E. Structure and function of the Salmonella Typhi chimaeric A(2)B(5) typhoid toxin.Nature. 2013; 499: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The Stx family members, produced by Shigella dysenteriae and certain strains of E. coli, have A subunits with RNA-N-glycosidase activity that inhibits eukaryotic protein synthesis (1Beddoe T. Paton A.W. Le Nours J. Rossjohn J. Paton J.C. Structure, biological functions and applications of the AB5 toxins.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 411-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A subset of Shiga toxigenic E. coli strains also produce subtilase cytotoxin (SubAB), the prototype of a fourth AB5 toxin family. The A subunit SubA is a subtilase family serine protease with exquisite specificity for the essential endoplasmic reticulum chaperone binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP)/glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) (3Paton A.W.

An additional family is exemplified by an extraintestinal E. coli toxin EcxAB, the A subunit of which is a metzincin-type metalloprotease (11Ng N.M. Littler D.R. Paton A.W. Le Nours J. Rossjohn J.

Microbes that express AB5 toxins have a wide range of pathological effects on human populations, from travelers’ diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic E. coli strains to the more serious and life-threatening diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholerae (12Naha A.

Paton A.W. Paton J.C. Löfling J.C. Smith D.F. Wilce M.C. Talbot U.M. Chong D.C. Yu H. Huang S. Chen X. Varki N.M. Varki A. Rossjohn J. Beddoe T.

Dis. 2007; 196: 1093-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Despite sharing a similar structural architecture, the B pentamers of the various AB5 family members differ widely in their host cell surface receptor specificity and intracellular trafficking. For example, PltB selectively recognizes the sialic acid N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), which is very prominent in humans because of an inactivating mutation in the CMAH gene encoding the CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase that converts Neu5Ac to N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) in most other mammals (15Chou H.H. Takematsu H. Diaz S. Iber J. Nickerson E. Wright K.L. Muchmore E.A. Nelson D.L. Warren S.T. Varki A. A mutation in human CMP-sialic acid hydroxylase occurred after the Homo-Pan divergence.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11751-11756Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). On the other hand, E. coli SubB prefers binding to Neu5Gc over Neu5Ac (5Byres E. Paton A.W. Paton J.C. Löfling J.C. Smith D.F. Wilce M.C. Talbot U.M. Chong D.C. Yu H. Huang S. Chen X. Varki N.M. Varki A. Rossjohn J. Beddoe T. Incorporation of a non-human glycan mediates human susceptibility to a bacterial toxin.Nature. 2008; 456: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). SubB is closely related to PltB (50% identity and 68% similarity over 117 amino acids). However, SubB is even more closely related (56% identity and 79% similarity over 136 amino acids) to a putative exported protein of Yersinia pestis (accession no.: YPO0337, now WP_002209112) (10Paton A.W. Srimanote P. Talbot U.M. Wang H. Paton J.C. A new family of potent AB(5) cytotoxins produced by Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli.J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), although curiously, there is no associated A subunit. Y. pestis, the etiologic agent of plague, was responsible for major devastating epidemics in human history that claimed millions of lives (16Perry R.D. Fetherston J.D. Yersinia pestis--etiologic agent of plague.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 10: 35-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is still considered of global importance to public health and potentially in biological warfare. It was first isolated by Alexandre Yersin during the third pandemic plague that reached Hong Kong (17Steensma D.P. Kyle R.A. Alexandre Yersin: Discoverer of the plague Bacillus.Mayo Clin. Proc. 2020; 95: e7-e8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Plague is predominantly a zoonosis, and a Y. pestis reservoir is maintained in animals such as ground squirrels and prairie dogs and transmitted to humans by fleas. Y. pestis also circulates in its rodent reservoir by flea-borne transmission (18Dziarski R. Deadly plague versus mild-mannered TLR4.Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 1017-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). One very interesting feature of Y. pestis is its adaptability to more than 200 hosts (19Bevins S.N. Baroch J.A. Nolte D.L. Zhang M. He H. Yersinia pestis: Examining wildlife plague surveillance in China and the USA.Integr. Zool. 2012; 7: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition to Y. pestis, the genus Yersinia also includes Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Yersinia enterocolitica, which are also associated with human infections and cause mild diarrhea (20Anisimov A.P. Amoako K.K. Treatment of plague: Promising alternatives to antibiotics.J. Med. Microbiol. 2006; 55: 1461-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Y. pestis is thought to be a “young” pathogen that diverged from the more environmental stress-tolerant and less pathogenic bacterium Y. pseudotuberculosis around 5000 to 7000 years ago by adapting to a flea-transmitted life cycle and the capability to cause host systemic infection (21Morelli G.

Y. pestis is now considered a clonally expanded genomically degenerating variant of Y. pseudotuberculosis. During its evolution, Y. pestis showed a varied mutation rate, not strictly obeying a constant evolutionary clock (23Cui Y. Yu C. Yan Y. Li D. Li Y. Jombart T. Weinert L.A. Wang Z. Guo Z. Xu L. Zhang Y. Zheng H. Qin N. Xiao X. Wu M. et al.Historical variations in mutation rate in an epidemic pathogen, Yersinia pestis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2013; 110: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Three forms of plague are usually described, including bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic plague (20Anisimov A.P. Amoako K.K. Treatment of plague: Promising alternatives to antibiotics.J. Med. Microbiol. 2006; 55: 1461-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Y. pestis can be transmitted by flea bites causing lymph nodes to swell and form buboes (known as bubonic plague) and respiratory droplets from one person to another (causing pneumonic plague). However, when Y. pestis spreads via blood, it causes septicemic plague (20Anisimov A.P. Amoako K.K. Treatment of plague: Promising alternatives to antibiotics.J. Med. Microbiol. 2006; 55: 1461-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Humans get infected either by flea bites or contact with the infected pets/domestic animals (causing conjunctivitis, skin plague, or pneumonic plague) (24Gage K.L. Dennis D.T. Orloski K.A. Ettestad P. Brown T.L. Reynolds P.J. Pape W.J. Fritz C.L. Carter L.G. Stein J.D. Cases of cat-associated human plague in the Western US, 1977-1998.Clin. Infect. Dis. 2000; 30: 893-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). If bubonic plague is not recognized and treated in time, it can develop into pneumonic plague or systemic plague. Septicemic plague has a very high mortality rate and can also be caused directly by blood infection with the pathogen through a cut (25Yang R. Plague: Recognition, treatment, and prevention.J. Clin. Microbiol. 2018; 56e01519-17Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We report here for the first time that the putative Y. pestis B subunit binds to and is intrinsically toxic toward cells that express Neu5Ac and/or Neu5Gc. These findings are consistent with Y. pestis adaptability of having more than 200 hosts and provide insights into the molecular bases for its host specificity, in understanding fundamental cellular functions and potential treatment of the disease. With the development of high-throughput technologies and well-organized databases, there is a major increase in availability of bacterial AB5 toxin sequence data. Based on phylogenetic analysis of existing genomes, it is evident from Figure 1A that there is a lack of evolutionary relationship between the A and B subunits. For example, while the A subunit (ArtA) of Salmonella Typhimurium ArtAB shares its clade with its homolog in S. bongori, the B subunit (ArtB) shares a clade with a homolog from Y. enterocolitica and E. coli EcPltB (Fig. 1A, see also the study by Sasmal et al., 2021, bioRxiv, 2021.05.28.446191). Likewise, while the E. coli toxin SubAB shares little similarity with other species with respect to its A subunit (SubA), it shares a clade with proteins from Yersinia species with respect to the B subunit (SubB). This situation has likely arisen because of lateral transmission and mixing and matching of subunit-encoding genes during the ongoing evolutionary arms race of bacterial species and toxins with respect to the host specificity. The fact that many AB5 toxin operons are encoded by bacteriophages and/or conjugative plasmids means that their distribution among species is also influenced by plasmid compatibility and phage host specificity.Figure 1Phylogenetic relationship of A-B subunit and B subunit-16S rRNA among different bacterial species. A, comparative phylogenies of A and B subunits of AB5 bacterial toxin show independent evolution of both subunits. ∗ shows phylogenetic relationship of Salmonella Typhimurium with other bacterial species with respect to A and B subunits, and ∗∗ indicates Escherichia coli sharing its clade with other bacterial species based on A and B subunits.

(See details of the methodology in the “Experimental procedures” section.) # represents published AB5 toxin B subunits with known host sialic acid–binding patterns.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To understand the phylogeny of the various B subunits, we further compared it with species phylogeny based on 16S rRNA. It is evident from the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1B) that B subunits are also evolving relatively independent of each other, in relation to species phylogeny. From the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1B), there is a partial discordance even between B subunit and species phylogeny. For example, E. coli SubB shares a clade with homologs produced by Yersinia species, whereas in species phylogeny, the E. coli strains that produce SubB share a clade with Salmonella species. Similarly, S. Typhimurium ArtB shares its clade with homologs in Y. enterocolitica but shares similarity with other Salmonella species based on 16S rRNA. Since the A and B subunits are independent and their biological roles are also distinct, a B subunit nomenclature based on the A subunit seems no longer logical. On the other hand, making changes in existing terminology will lead to confusion regarding the prior literature. We suggest that existing names remain unchanged going forward, but that the nomenclature of an entirely novel toxin should be related wherever practical to the bacterial species producing it (Table 1). Accordingly, the novel exported protein that appears to be an isolated Y. pestis B subunit is hereby named YpeB (Table 1). Having said that, the laboratory of one of the coauthors previously referred to S. Typhi PltB as S. Typhi ArtB in the literature (26Wang H. Paton J.C. Herdman B.P. Rogers T.J. Beddoe T. Paton A.W.

Immun. 2013; 81: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) because of the close similarity of both the A and B subunits to ArtAB of S. Typhimurium (already described by Saitoh et al., 2005 (27Saitoh M. Tanaka K. Nishimori K. Makino S.I. Kanno T. Ishihara R. Hatama S. Kitano R. Kishima M. Sameshima T. Akiba M. Nakazawa M. Yokomizo Y.

Consistent with Y. pestis having >200 hosts (rats, rabbits, squirrels, chipmunks, etc), YpeB bound to both Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc terminated glycans (detailed in Fig. 2) implying a potentially broad range of host specificity.

https://openalex.org/W4223605525,"Purpose The recent developments of tau-positron emission tomography (tau-PET) enable in vivo assessment of neuropathological tau aggregates. Among the tau-specific tracers, the application of 11 C-pyridinyl-butadienyl-benzothiazole 3 ( 11 C-PBB3) in PET shows high sensitivity to Alzheimer disease (AD)-related tau deposition. The current study investigates the regional tau load in patients within the AD continuum, biomarker-negative individuals (BN) and patients with suspected non-AD pathophysiology (SNAP) using 11 C-PBB3-PET. Materials and methods A total of 23 memory clinic outpatients with recent decline of episodic memory were examined using 11 C-PBB3-PET. Pittsburg compound B ( 11 C-PIB) PET was available for 17, 18 F-flurodeoxyglucose ( 18 F-FDG) PET for 16, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein levels for 11 patients. CSF biomarkers were considered abnormal based on Aβ 42 (&lt; 600 ng/L) and t-tau (&gt; 450 ng/L). The PET biomarkers were classified as positive or negative using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis and visual assessment. Using the amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (A/T/N) scheme, patients were grouped as within the AD continuum, SNAP, and BN based on amyloid and neurodegeneration status. The 11 C-PBB3 load detected by PET was compared among the groups using both atlas-based and voxel-wise analyses. Results Seven patients were identified as within the AD continuum, 10 SNAP and 6 BN. In voxel-wise analysis, significantly higher 11 C-PBB3 binding was observed in the AD continuum group compared to the BN patients in the cingulate gyrus, tempo-parieto-occipital junction and frontal lobe. Compared to the SNAP group, patients within the AD continuum had a considerably increased 11 C-PBB3 uptake in the posterior cingulate cortex. There was no significant difference between SNAP and BN groups. The atlas-based analysis supported the outcome of the voxel-wise quantification analysis. Conclusion Our results suggest that 11 C-PBB3-PET can effectively analyze regional tau load and has the potential to differentiate patients in the AD continuum group from the BN and SNAP group."

We previously showed that the sodium-channel blocker carbamazepine (Carb) corrects KATP channel surface expression defects induced by PHHI-causing mutations in SUR1.

However, after Carb treatment, coimmunoprecipitation of mutant KATP channels and Golgi marker GM130 was diminished, and KATP staining was also reduced in lysosomes. Intriguingly, Carb treatment also simultaneously increased autophagic flux and p62 accumulation, suggesting that autophagy-dependent degradation of the mutant channel was not only stimulated but also interrupted.

In summary, our data suggest that surface expression of Kir6.2-A28V KATP channels is rescued by Carb treatment via promotion of mutant KATP channel exit from the Golgi apparatus and reduction of autophagy-mediated protein degradation. Pancreatic ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels are composed of four Kir6.2 subunits and four regulatory sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) subunits. The primary function of these channels is to sense the cytosolic ATP and ADP concentrations in pancreatic β-cells and respond by regulating cellular electrical activities. As such, KATP channels link metabolism status to membrane potential and play an essential role in regulating insulin secretion (1Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Molecular biology of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels.Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 101-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI) is a rare genetic disease caused by mutations in the KATP channel subunits that has an incidence rate of about 1 in 50,000. Despite this low incidence, PHHI is one of the most important and frequent causes of severe neonatal hypoglycemia (2Goel P. Choudhury S.R. Persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy: An overview of current concepts.J. Indian Assoc. Pediatr. Surgeons. 2012; 17: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The first-line treatment for PHHI is diazoxide, a KATP channel opener that can suppress insulin release. Unfortunately, however, 90% of all neonatal forms of PHHI are resistant to diazoxide, and patients with these forms of disease must undergo a near-total pancreatectomy. Recently, we have identified a KCNJ11 mutation that causes late-onset PHHI. This nonsynonymous C83T point mutation encodes Kir6.2-A28V, and carriers of this allele exhibit diazoxide-resistant PHHI. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that KATP channels with the Kir6.2-A28V mutant have almost no current, as the mutant KATP channels fail to reach the cell surface in Kir6.2-A28V-transfected cells (3Yang Y.-Y. Long R.K. Ferrara C.T. Gitelman S.E. German M.S. Yang S.-B. A new familial form of a late-onset, persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy caused by a novel mutation in KCNJ11.Channels (Austin, Tex.). 2017; 11: 636-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Based on de novo protein structure prediction, a plausible mechanism leading to the trafficking deficit is the exposure of the RKR (arginine–lysine–arginine) motif in Kir6.2-A28V during protein folding. If the RKR motif is not properly concealed, the protein can be aberrantly retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (4Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. A new ER trafficking signal regulates the subunit stoichiometry of plasma membrane KATP channels.Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Folding of proteins requires the assistance of molecular chaperones, often of the heat shock protein family. There are several chaperone functions of heat shock proteins that ensure the quality of mature proteins. Molecular chaperones may assist in the folding of nascent proteins, play a protective role during assembly of protein complexes, prevent misfolded proteins from aggregation, or mediate degradation of certain targets. In conditions of stress, the expression of chaperones is often increased by mechanisms that serve to maintain the cellular environment (5Webster J.M. Darling A.L. Uversky V.N. Blair L.J. Small heat shock proteins, big impact on protein aggregation in neurodegenerative disease.Front. Pharmacol. 2019; 10: 1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). When new proteins are synthesized during stressful or normal conditions, chaperones can ensure protein folding efficiency and stable conformations. Chaperones can also prevent proteins from forming abnormal aggregates. Several well-known chaperones can bind and hydrolyze ATP during their interactions with misfolded proteins; this activity improves folding efficiency and ensures quality. Some ATP-dependent chaperones can function as protein remodeling factors that target misfolded or aggregated proteins for degradation or reverse the formation of dysfunctional aggregated conformations (6Saibil H. Chaperone machines for protein folding, unfolding and disaggregation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 630-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Many mutations in ABCC8 or KCNJ11 lead to protein misfolding that causes the loss-of-channel function and PHHI. In fact, many disease-causing KATP channel mutants have trafficking deficits and cannot reach the cell surface, probably because of actions of the cellular protein quality control system. Notably, some of these trafficking defects can be corrected by sulfonylureas, which are KATP channel blockers and a second-line treatment for type II diabetes (7Martin G.M. Rex E.A. Devaraneni P. Denton J.S. Boodhansingh K.E. DeLeon D.D. Stanley C.A. Shyng S.L. Pharmacological correction of trafficking defects in ATP-sensitive potassium channels caused by sulfonylurea receptor 1 mutations.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 21971-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition to sulfonylureas, carbamazepine (Carb; an anticonvulsant thought to target voltage-gated sodium channels) was also shown to correct KATP channel trafficking defects in PHHI (8Martin G.M. Chen P.-C. Devaraneni P. Shyng S.-L. Pharmacological rescue of trafficking-impaired ATP-sensitive potassium channels.Front. Physiol. 2013; 4: 386Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated if Carb can rescue the trafficking deficit associated with the Kir6.2-A28V mutant. Carb treatment increased the total and surface expression of SUR1 in SUR1/Kir6.2-A28V transfected cells, according to a surface biotinylation assay. The rescue effects of Carb on the trafficking defects did involve the unfolded protein response (UPR). Simultaneously, we also found that Carb treatment impaired the autophagy-dependent protein degradation pathway, allowing the mutant KATP channels to travel through the ER to the Golgi apparatus, where mutant KATP channels interact with GM130, a Golgi matrix protein. Surprisingly, Carb treatment decreased this interaction; instead, it allowed mutant KATP channels to exit from the Golgi apparatus and traveled to the cell surface. Collectively, our results reveal novel mechanisms by which Carb rescues the trafficking defects of a mutant KATP channel. We previously demonstrated that the pharmacochaperones, Carb and Glib, could rescue the trafficking defects of KATP channels containing several PHHI-causing SUR1 mutants (7Martin G.M. Rex E.A.

Mechanism of pharmacochaperoning in a mammalian KATP channel revealed by cryo-EM.eLife. 2019; 8e46417Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, we wanted to test whether Carb and Glib could also rescue the trafficking deficits of mutant KATP channels containing Kir6.2-A28V. We first asked whether Carb and Glib could rescue the maturation and surface expression of the mutant KATP channels. WT and mutant KATP channels were expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, and then the cells were treated with vehicle (0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide), 10 μM Glib or Carb, and 100 μM Glib or Carb. The cells were then subjected to Western blot analysis after 16 h of treatment. Both Glib and Carb had negligible effects on the WT KATP channels but dose-dependently increased the upper (mature) SUR1 band in the mutant KATP channel–expressing cells (Fig. 1A, top). We have previously shown that the upper band is the complex-glycosylated SUR1, according to its sensitivity to the peptide-N-glycosidase F (data not shown). Quantification of the upper SUR1 band showed that in 100 μM Glib-treated cells, mature SUR1 protein was significantly increased as compared with that in the vehicle-treated group (Fig. 1A, bottom). Similarly, Carb dose-dependently rescued mutant KATP channels, as the upper SUR1 band was significantly increased after 10 μM or 100 μM Carb treatment, in comparison with vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 1B). Although both Carb and Glib could rescue the impaired maturation of SUR1 caused by the Kir6.2-A28V mutant, Glib irreversibly inhibits KATP channels formed by Kir6.2 and SUR1 (12Gribble F.M.

Tissue specificity of sulfonylureas: Studies on cloned cardiac and beta-cell K(ATP) channels.Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1412-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Thus, we focused on Carb for further mechanistic studies in INS-1 cells. To confirm that Carb treatment actually causes the mature mutant KATP channels to reach the cell surface, we performed surface biotinylation and subsequent immunoprecipitation to determine the levels of surface protein expression. We cotransfected Kir6.2-A28V with hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged SUR1 to express mutant KATP channels in rat insulinoma INS-1 cells, a rat insulinoma cell line that still maintains specific beta-cell physiology and insulin secretion (13Fehmann H.C. Peiser C. Bode H.P. Stamm M. Staats P. Hedetoft C. Lang R.E. Goke B.

Either 10 or 100 μM Carb treatment could increase the surface expression of SUR1 in the mutant KATP channel–expressing cells, as indicated by immunoblotting for SUR1 or HA (Fig. 2, A and B). We also performed surface immunostaining to verify the effects of Carb on the surface expression of mutant KATP channels. Indeed, INS-1 cells transfected with WT but not mutant KATP channels had strong surface signals. This observation was in agreement with a previous report (3Yang Y.-Y. Long R.K. Ferrara C.T. Gitelman S.E. German M.S. Yang S.-B.

However, mutant KATP channel–expressing cells treated with Carb had HA-SUR1 surface expression levels comparable to those observed in cells expressing WT KATP channels (Fig. 2C). Finally, to confirm whether the increased surface expression of the KATP channels containing the mutant Kir6.2-A28V, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recording in HEK293 cells transfected with either SUR1/Kir6.2 (WT) or SUR1/Kir6.2-A28V. Our results (Fig. 2, D–H) showed that the Carb pretreatment could augment the mutant but not WT KATP currents, further supporting the role of Carb in promoting mutant KATP channel trafficking. KATP channels containing Kir6.2-A28V fail to reach the cell surface, causing a significant reduction in whole-cell KATP currents (Fig. 2) (3Yang Y.-Y. Long R.K. Ferrara C.T. Gitelman S.E. German M.S.

We first determined the cellular distributions of WT and mutant KATP channels in INS-1 cells transiently transfected with HA-tagged SUR1 and WT Kir6.2 or mutant Kir6.2-A28V by costaining for the protein and organelle markers. A de novo protein structure simulation suggested that Ala to Val mutation at position 28 would rearrange the RKR ER-retention motif (3Yang Y.-Y. Long R.K. Ferrara C.T. Gitelman S.E. German M.S.

A new ER trafficking signal regulates the subunit stoichiometry of plasma membrane KATP channels.Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar), meaning that the mutant KATP channels might remain in the ER (4Zerangue N.

A new ER trafficking signal regulates the subunit stoichiometry of plasma membrane KATP channels.Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). INS-1 cells expressing HA-tagged SUR1 and WT Kir6.2 or mutant Kir6.2-A28V were treated with vehicle or 10 μM Carb, followed by immunofluorescence staining with HA and KEDL (C-terminal tetrapeptide ER retention signal) antibodies. Unexpectedly, we did not observe any abnormal accumulation of mutant KATP channels in the ER (Fig. 3). It has been well established that correct trafficking and surface expression of the KATP channel complex is under the control of a tripeptide ER retention signal RKR (4Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. A new ER trafficking signal regulates the subunit stoichiometry of plasma membrane KATP channels.Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar), present in both SUR1 and Kir6.2. During channel assembly in the ER, SUR1 and Kir6.2 associate with one another, shielding the ER retention signal to allow the channel complex to exit the ER and traffic to the cell surface. As the channel complex travels through the medial Golgi, the glycosylation pattern is further modified to give rise to the complex glycosylated proteins. We then wondered if mutant KATP channels could exit the ER, later becoming trapped in the Golgi apparatus. Indeed, more mutant KATP channels colocalized with GM130, a cis-Golgi matrix protein, suggesting that the mutant KATP channels containing Kir6.2-A28V subunits accumulated in the Golgi after exiting the ER (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, we performed coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments using anti-HA and anti-GM130 antibodies. We found that anti-GM130 pulled down more Kir6.2-A28V mutant proteins than WT, further strengthening our conclusion that the mutant KATP channels were stuck in the Golgi complex (Fig. 4B). Upon Carb treatment, the fluorescence signal for mutant KATP channels was largely decreased in the Golgi and increased at the plasma membrane (Fig. 4A, top); quantification of the colocalization signal in the Golgi further supported the conclusion that Carb treatment can prevent the accumulation of mutant channels in the Golgi (Fig. 4A, bottom). Anti-GM130 also pulled down fewer mutant proteins from the Carb-treated mutant-expressing cells (Fig. 4B, top); quantification of the HA-SUR1 in the coimmunoprecipitate pulled down by GM130-cojugated agarose beads displayed Carb treatment dose-dependently reduces the interaction of mutant KATP channels in the Golgi (Fig. 4B, top). Similar results were obtained when we pulled down HA-tagged proteins and immunoblotted them with GM130 antibody (Fig. 4B, bottom); the bar graph for GM130 in the coimmunoprecipitate was dose-dependently decreased upon Carb treatment (Fig. 4B, bottom). Furthermore, we employed an immunoblotting/molecular imaging method known as the proximal ligation assay (PLS) in INS-1 cells (Fig. 4C, top). Two primary antibodies were used to target Kir6.2 and GM130, followed by secondary antibodies containing PLA probes. After amplification of DNA cycle, fluorescent-labeled oligonucleotide binds to amplified DNA, resulting the red fluorescence as bright spots, demonstrating endogenous KATP channels in GM130 (Fig. 4C, bottom).Figure 4Mutant KATP channels colocalize and interact with Golgi matrix protein GM130.

Importantly, Carb treatment reduced the colocalization with lysosomes, suggesting that the degradation of mutant KATP channels had been attenuated (Fig. 5, A and B). To investigate if the rescue effects of Carb on mutant KATP channels act on ER-related protein quality control responses, we measured mRNA expression levels of SUR1 and key proteins in the UPR and ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathways. The UPR is coordinately regulated by the three major ER stress sensors, inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) (15Siwecka N. Rozpędek W. Pytel D. Wawrzynkiewicz A. Dziki A. Dziki Ł. Diehl J.A. Majsterek I. Dual role of endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated unfolded protein response signaling pathway in carcinogenesis.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019; 20: 4354Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The activation of all three proximal sensors results in a reduction in the amount of new protein translocated into the ER lumen, increasing ERAD and promoting the transcription of endogenous chaperones (16Kaufman R.J. Orchestrating the unfolded protein response in health and disease.J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1389-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). INS-1 cells were treated with tunicamycin at 1.25 μg/ml or dimethyl sulfoxide for 12 h, harvested RNA, and subjected quantitative PCR for UPR and ERAD genes to serve as the positive control. Tunicamycin treatment activated the UPR and ERAD pathways (Fig. S1). However, Carb did not affect SUR1 mRNA levels in WT-transfected or Kir6.2-A28V-transfected cells (Fig. 6A). Next, we examined the mRNA expression levels of IRE1α, PERK, and ATF6α. WT and mutant KATP channel–expressing cells with or without Carb treatments did not show any differential expression of these proteins (Fig. 6, B–D). With regard to ERAD, the mRNA expression of HRD1 was not different among cells expressing WT and mutant KATP channels, either in the presence or the absence of Carb treatment (Fig. 6E). We then wanted to test whether inhibition of lysosomal or proteasomal degradation could increase the surface expression of mutant KATP channels. Thus, we treated the channel-expressing INS-1 cells either with 10 μM of autophagy inhibitor (3MA) and chloroquine (CQ) or proteasome blocker (MG132). We found that similar to Carb, 3MA, CQ, and MG132 could increase the amount of mature KATP channel (upper band of SUR1), suggesting that the autophagy or proteasome pathway is involved in degrading the mutant KATP channels (Fig. 7). Carb has been reported as an autophagy-enhancing drug in the liver disease (17Hidvegi T. Ewing M. Hale P. Dippold C. Beckett C. Kemp C. Maurice N. Mukherjee A. Goldbach C. Watkins S. Michalopoulos G. Perlmutter D.H. An autophagy-enhancing drug promotes degradation of mutant alpha1-antitrypsin Z and reduces hepatic fibrosis.Science. 2010; 329: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar); hence, we continued examining the role of autophagy in regulating mutant KATP channel trafficking; we tested whether rapamycin, an autophagy activator, could prevent the Carb rescue effect. Moreover, it has been shown earlier that in the hypothalamus, the KATP channel is under the regulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway (18Yang S.-B. Tien A.-C. Boddupalli G. Xu A.W. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Rapamycin ameliorates age-dependent obesity associated with increased mTOR signaling in hypothalamic POMC neurons.Neuron. 2012; 75: 425-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We found that although Carb could increase the upper SUR1 band, this effect was abolished by rapamycin without affecting overall SUR1 expression (lower SUR1 band) (Fig. 8). These results further strengthen the idea that Carb rescues mutant KATP channel trafficking by inhibiting the autophagy pathway. During autophagy, the cytosolic form of LC3B (LC3BI) binds phosphatidylethanolamine to form the LC3B–phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated complex (LC3BII), which will bind with p62 substrate and promote the formation of autophagosome membranes. Thus, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation triggers autophagy, and the ratio of LC3BII to LC3BI represents the level of autophagic activity. In addition, the level of p62 degradation indicates the completion of autophagic flux (19Barth S. Glick D. Macleod K.F. Autophagy: Assays and artifacts.J. Pathol. 2010; 221: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). We, therefore, probed this process using LC3B, p-AMPKα1/2, and SQSTM1/p62 antibodies. Carb treatment increased the ratio of LC3BII/LC3BI and p-AMPKα1/2 in WT or Kir6.2-A28V-expressing cells (Fig. 8A). However, Carb treatment did not reduce p62 expression, suggesting that the autophagy process was not completed (Fig. 8B). Next, we examined whether Carb treatment could affect mTOR-dependent autophagy using rapamycin as an mTOR inhibitor and probing mTOR-downstream S6 phosphorylation. Carb treatment significantly decreased mTOR-downstream S6 phosphorylation in both WT and mutant KATP channel–expressing cells, which coincided with the increased surface expression of SUR1 (upper band). Our data further showed that cotreatment of Carb and rapamycin did not restore S6 phosphorylation. We also quantified the upper and lower SUR1 bands and found that Carb can rescue the upper SUR1 band level, but rapamycin treatment had no effect on SUR1 expression levels in mutant KATP channel–expressing cells. However, Carb could not attenuate the induction of autophagy by rapamycin, which would account for the undetectable upper SUR1 band in cotreated cells (Fig. 8C). Collectively, these data suggest that Carb initiates autophagic flux, but the fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosomes is not completed, potentially explaining how Carb treatment could cause decreased localization of mutant KATP channels in lysosomes.Figure 8Carbamazepine (Carb) prevents mutant KATP channels from autophagy-dependent protein degradation.

Azamulin is used as a selective inhibitor for 3A4 and 3A5 to define their roles in metabolism of new chemical entities during drug development. In contrast to 3A4, 3A5 exhibits homotropic cooperativity for the sequential binding of two azamulin molecules at concentrations used for inhibition. To define the underlying sites and mechanisms for cooperativity, an X-ray crystal structure of 3A5 was determined with two azamulin molecules in the active site that are stacked in an antiparallel orientation. One azamulin resides proximal to the heme in a pose similar to the 3A4–azamulin complex. Comparison to the 3A5 apo structure indicates that the distal azamulin in 3A5 ternary complex causes a significant induced fit that excludes water from the hydrophobic surfaces of binding cavity and the distal azamulin, which is augmented by the stacking interaction with the proximal azamulin. Homotropic cooperativity was not observed for the binding of related pleuromutilin antibiotics, tiamulin, retapamulin, and lefamulin, to 3A5, which are larger and unlikely to bind in the distal site in a stacked orientation. Formation of the 3A5 complex with two azamulin molecules may prevent time-dependent inhibition that is seen for 3A4 by restricting alternate product formation and/or access of reactive intermediates to vulnerable protein sites.

Understanding substrate and inhibitor interactions with P450s can provide information for drug redesign to avoid drug–drug interactions during drug development. X-ray crystal structures can define interactions of substrates and inhibitors with P450s at the atomic level as well as providing models for in silico studies of ligand binding. X-ray crystal structures have also defined the conformational plasticity of 3A4, which underlies its capacity to accommodate very large substrates as well as relatively small compounds. Our laboratory published crystal structures indicating that the plasticity of 3A5 differs from that of 3A4. Ritonavir, an HIV protease and 3A4/3A5 inhibitor, adopts alternative conformations when bound in 3A5 (Protein Data Bank [PDB] code: 5VEU) 1Parentheses refer to PDB identification codes for a protein structure with four characters and three characters for ligands.1Parentheses refer to PDB identification codes for a protein structure with four characters and three characters for ligands. compared with 3A4 (PDB code: 3NXU). Ritonavir causes the cavity to widen in 3A4 relative to the substrate/inhibitor-free structure when viewed with the heme as the base of the cavity. In 3A5, ritonavir binds in a narrower cavity with the distal end of ritonavir engaging the larger upper portion of the cavity (10Hsu M.H. Savas U. Johnson E.F. The X-ray crystal structure of the human mono-oxygenase cytochrome P450 3A5-ritonavir complex reveals active site differences between P450s 3A4 and 3A5.Mol. Pharmacol. 2018; 93: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To better understand these conformational differences, the structure of 3A5 was determined in the absence of a substrate (PDB code: 6MJM). The 3A5 substrate-free structure exhibits a larger and more open cavity than that of substrate-free 3A4. Comparison of substrate-free structure of 3A5 to the ritonavir complex indicates that binding of ritonavir is coupled with conformational changes of 3A5 that close the cavity and maximize molecular interactions between the protein and substrate (11Hsu M.H. Johnson E.F. Active-site differences between substrate-free and ritonavir-bound cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A5 reveal plasticity differences between CYP3A5 and CYP3A4.J. Biol.

In contrast, the active-site cavity of substrate-free 3A4 expands to accommodate ritonavir (12Sevrioukova I.F. Poulos T.L.

To expand our understanding of the differential structural plasticity between 3A4 and 3A5, we cocrystalized 3A5 with azamulin (MWY; ligand of interest), a semisynthetic antibiotic that is derived from the diterpene macrocycle of pleuromutilin by replacing a hydroxyl acetate group with an acetate connected to an amino-triazole ring via a thioether linker. 2The PDB entry for the structure of azamulin (MWY) is designated (3aS,4R,5S,6R,8R,9R,9aR,10R)-6-ethyl-5-hydroxy-4,6,9,10-tetramethyl-1-oxodecahydro-3a,9-propanocyclopenta[8]annulen-8-yl [(5-amino-1H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)sulfanyl]acetate.

The latter is consistent with numbering for pleuromutilin and tiamulin.2The PDB entry for the structure of azamulin (MWY) is designated (3aS,4R,5S,6R,8R,9R,9aR,10R)-6-ethyl-5-hydroxy-4,6,9,10-tetramethyl-1-oxodecahydro-3a,9-propanocyclopenta[8]annulen-8-yl [(5-amino-1H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)sulfanyl]acetate.

The latter is consistent with numbering for pleuromutilin and tiamulin. In addition, the 6-ethenyl moiety of pleuromutilin was changed to an ethyl group (13Sun F. Zhang H. Gonzales G.B. Zhou J. Li Y.

The structure of the 3A4–azamulin complex (PDB code: 6OOA) was determined with a single azamulin molecule bound in the active site (15Sevrioukova I.F.

The pleuromutilin macrolide is positioned close to the heme, which leads to a type 1 spectral change in the visible spectrum for the Soret band because of reduction of water coordination to the heme iron (15Sevrioukova I.F.

The type 1 shift lowers the wavelength of the Soret band, and the concentration dependence was characterized by a hyperbolic response with reported dissociation constants of 2 and 3 μM (14Stresser D.M.

In addition, a sigmoidal dependence of type 1 spectral shift is consistent with the binding of two azamulin molecules at concentrations used for inhibition studies. The proximal azamulin in the ternary complex with 3A5 is positioned like that seen for the binary 3A4–azamulin complex (PDB code: 6OOA), but the conformation of the acetate substituent differs between the two proteins. The distal azamulin molecule is stacked against the proximal azamulin in an antiparallel orientation. This orientation places the second macrocycle in the upper portion of the cavity with the amino triazole group positioned between Arg-106 and Ser-119 at the base of the helix BC loop. 3A4 exhibits both reversible and irreversible time-dependent inhibition by azamulin (14Stresser D.M.

Nevertheless, time-dependent inhibition of 3A5 by azamulin was reported to be either very slow or nonexistent (17Parmentier Y. Pothier C. Delmas A. Caradec F. Trancart M.M. Guillet F. Bouaita B. Chesne C. Brian Houston J. Walther B. Direct and quantitative evaluation of the human CYP3A4 contribution (f(m)) to drug clearance using the in vitro SILENSOMES model.Xenobiotica. 2017; 47: 562-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The cooperative binding seen for azamulin with 3A5 may prevent mechanism-based inhibition by restricting sites of substrate metabolism and/or reduction of product reactions that lead to inactivation. In the absence of second azamulin molecule, the active site of 3A4 is much less restrictive and may allow alternative binding poses and/or expose additional vulnerabilities for adduction by a reactive azamulin metabolite. The underlying mechanism for time-dependent irreversible inhibition of 3A4 remains unclear. In addition to revealing differences in plasticity between 3A5 and 3A4, this structure reveals the basis for the homotropic cooperativity in the formation of the ternary complex of 3A5 with azamulin. The 2.46 Å X-ray crystal structure of 3A5 complexed with azamulin in the C2221 space group revealed the presence of two molecules azamulin bound in each of the four chains of the asymmetric unit. Overlays of chains B, C, and D on chain A indicated that conformational differences for the distal azamulin molecule are unremarkable, but small differences were seen for the amino triazole moiety of the proximal azamulin (Fig. 1A). These confirmational differences and the locations of the molecules are well defined by unbiased 2mFc–DFo omit maps (Fig. 1B). The amino triazole groups for the proximal azamulin extend out of the active-site cavity under the connecter between the F and F′ helices and reside between helix I and the C-terminal loop in an open channel that is designated the S-channel (18Cojocaru V. Winn P.J. Wade R.C. The ins and outs of cytochrome P450s.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1770: 390-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). These differences are likely to reflect structural differences between the four chains for the flexible connector between the F and F′ helices (Fig. 1A) that in turn reflect differences in lattice contacts for the different chains. The macrocycle of the proximal azamulin is positioned close to the heme surface with C9 centered 4.2 Å from the center of the heme iron (Fig. 1B). This distance is similar to the value of 4.27 Å seen in the structure of the 3A4–azamulin complex (PDB code: 6OOA). This close approach underlies type 1 shift seen for the binding azamulin in both enzymes. C9 and C15 of azamulin are prominent sites for hydroxylation of the related pleuromutilin antibiotics, tiamulin, valnemulin, and retapamulin, by 3A4 (13Sun F. Zhang H. Gonzales G.B. Zhou J. Li Y.

Chain A exhibits the lowest B-factors of the four chains and provides the most details regarding the role of solvation in the binding of azamulin. Interactions of the azamulin molecules with protein residues within ≤4.5 Å of the proximal azamulin in chain A are shown in Figure 2 with hydrogen-bonding interactions (black dashed lines ≥2.6 Å and ≤3.5 Å) between the protein and azamulin molecules or with bridging water molecules (oxygen shown as red spheres). Additional protein residues that are hydrogen bonded to the water molecules are also shown. The hydroxyl of the proximal azamulin donates an H-bond to Ser-119, and the amino nitrogen donates H-bonds to the carbonyls of Phe-210 and Thr-207. In addition, the triazole nitrogens of the proximal azamulin interact as donors or acceptors of H-bonds with water molecules (Fig. 2B), and the ketone group of the proximal macrocycle accepts an H-bond from a protein-sequestered water molecule near the heme surface (Fig. 2A). Some of the interacting water molecules are not evident or are reduced in number for other chains because of higher B values, differences in the surrounding residues, and orientations of the amino triazole group of proximal azamulin (Fig. 1B). The amino group on the triazole is unlikely to be charged at neutral pH because of conjugation with the triazole ring, which would impart sp2 character to the nitrogen and could also affect the hydrogen-bonding patterns. The hydroxyl group of the distal azamulin donates an H-bond to the carbonyl of Ala-370 (Fig. 2A). As shown in Figure 2C, Arg-105 donates an H-bond to N30 of the triazole of the distal azamulin, and N28 of the triazole donates an H-bond to the carbonyl of Arg-106. The amino group resides between the amide nitrogen of Arg-106 and the carbonyl of Ser-119 and could act as an H-bond donor and acceptor, respectively. The amino group can donate an H-bond to a water molecule seen in chain A, but this water molecule is not well defined by density in the other three chains. Hydrophobic interactions contribute extensively to the stability of the complex by exclusion of water from the hydrophobic surfaces of azamulin and the protein. The buried surface area interactions between the azamulin, the protein, and heme were computed by PISA (Proteins, Interfaces, Structures and Assemblies) (19Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6475) Google Scholar) using the PDBePISA server (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pisa/) (version 1.52). For the proximal azamulin in chain A, the buried surface area with the protein, the distal azamulin, and the heme are 422, 118, and 99 Å2, respectively, with an estimated ΔG of −10.2 kcal/mol. The estimated ΔG was the same for the distal azamulin with buried surface of 521 and 121 Å2 for the interfaces with the protein and proximal azamulin. These values are similar to that obtained for the single azamulin bound to 3A4 (PDB code: 6OOA), which yields estimated ΔG of −10.5 kcal/mol with buried surface of 452 and 111 Å2 with the protein and heme, respectively. As a result, the buried hydrophobic surface area for the 3A5 ternary complex is more than twice that of 3A4 binary complex with a significant contribution from stacking interactions of the proximal and distal azamulin molecules in 3A5, which likely contribute to the positive cooperativity. The structure of the 3A4 azamulin complex (PDB code: 6OOA) is superimposed on the 3A5 ternary complex in Figure 3 using the align command with defaults in PyMol (20DeLano W.L. The case for open-source software in drug discovery.Drug Discov. Today. 2005; 10: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The binding of the proximal azamulin in 3A5 is very similar to the conformation seen for 3A4. 3A4 and 3A5 amino-acid residues residing ≤4.5 Å of the azamulin in distal cavity in the 3A5 ternary complex are shown in Figure 3 as sticks. The distal cavity in 3A4 is larger than that occupied by the distal azamulin in the 3A5 ternary complex, and in general, the selected 3A4 amino acids reside at similar distances from the 3A5 distal azamulin as those in the 3A5 complex or outside the 3A5 residues. The potential for binding a second molecule of azamulin in 3A4 would seem likely, but an exception is 3A4 Leu 482 CD2, which is 2.9 Å from C15 (dashed red line) of the distal 3A5 azamulin, which may disfavor the stacking interaction with the proximal azamulin in 3A4. In addition, the disordered residues in the helix F–F′ connector of the 3A4 azamulin complex (PDB code: 6OOA) could interfere with the binding of a second azamulin in 3A4 even though the F–F′ connector varies greatly between 3A4 structures. Nevertheless, the absence of a second azamulin suggests that movement of the azamulin is less restricted in the 3A4 active-site cavity and that solvent exposure of the azamulin in 3A4 binary complex is greatly increased relative to the 3A5 ternary complex. Plasticity is gaged by the differences seen between the structure of the azamulin complex and the structure of the enzyme obtained in the absence of the ligand. The structure of the 3A5 apo protein (PDB code: 6MJM) exhibits a large cavity above the heme surface (11Hsu M.H. Johnson E.F. Active-site differences between substrate-free and ritonavir-bound cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A5 reveal plasticity differences between CYP3A5 and CYP3A4.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 8015-8022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A comparison to the conformation of chain A of azamulin complex indicates that the upper portion of the apo 3A5 active-site cavity reorganizes to engage the distal azamulin molecule (Fig. 4A). The proximal azamulin causes the F304 on helix I to rotate upward and displace the C-terminal end of helix F and the connector to helix F′, leading to displacement of F210 Cα by 4.8 Å. In addition, engagement of F215 with the distal azamulin reflects a 180° rotation of the side chain and a 6.8 Å translation of Cα. Large rotations are also seen for other side chains that exhibit smaller translations to interact with the distal azamulin. As seen when chain A of the 3A5 ritonavir complex is overlayed on chain A of the 3A5 ternary complex of azamulin in Figure 4B, similar but distinct changes occur in the distal cavity when ritonavir binds. In addition, ritonavir causes significant changes in the proximal cavity relative to apo structure to accommodate both the binding of thiazole to the heme iron and the stacking of the ritonavir P1 phenyl group above the thiazole moiety. In contrast, amino-acid side chains in the lower cavity do not exhibit significant differences between the azamulin complex and the apo structure. These differences between the azamulin ternary complex and the apo protein are much larger than the differences seen between the four chains in the asymmetric unit of the azamulin ternary complex. The plasticity of the upper active-site cavity provides a means to accommodate a wide range of compounds and more than one molecule at a time in the case of azamulin. The binding of azamulin to 3A5 exhibits a blue shift of the Soret band in the UV–visible region of the P450 heme that is associated with an increase in high-spin character of the iron because of decreased occupancy of water to the sixth coordination site of the heme iron. This conversion is almost complete (Fig. 5A). This is consistent with the close approach of the proximal azamulin to the heme iron seen in the structure of the 3A5 ternary complex. The binding curve for 3A5 is sigmoidal, and a fit of the Hill equation to the data using nonlinear regression exhibited a Kd of 7.1 ± 0.4 μM with a Hill coefficient of 1.7 ± 0.1 (n = 4) using three different preparations of the protein at a nominal concentration of 4 μM. Under similar conditions, 3A4 exhibited a Hill coefficient of 1.0 and was well fit by the Morrison equation with a Kd of 2.0 μM (not shown), which is consistent with previous reports (14Stresser D.M. Broudy M.I. Ho T. Cargill C.E. Blanchard A.P. Sharma R. Dandeneau A.A. Goodwin J.J. Turner S.D. Erve J.C. Patten C.J. Dehal S.S. Crespi C.L.

Sci. 2019; 20: 4245Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The sigmoidal changes for 3A5 indicate that higher concentrations of azamulin interfere with the binding of a water to the sixth coordination site of the heme iron because of the second azamulin molecule binding in the distal active site. Dynafit (21Kuzmic P. DynaFit--a software package for enzymology.Methods Enzymol. 2009; 467: 247-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) was used for additional fitting of the data to a sequential binding model. As the apparent Kd obtained from the fit of Hill equation is close to the concentrations of 3A5 used, the amount of protein-bound azamulin is likely to represent significant fraction of the total concentration of azamulin prior to saturation. In addition, the Kd determined for the Hill equation is an order of magnitude higher than the IC50 reported for inhibition of 3A5 enzymatic activity (14Stresser D.M. Broudy M.I. Ho T. Cargill C.E. Blanchard A.P. Sharma R. Dandeneau A.A. Goodwin J.J. Turner S.D. Erve J.C. Patten C.J. Dehal S.S. Crespi C.L. Highly selective inhibition of human CYP3A in vitro by azamulin and evidence that inhibition is irreversible.Drug Metab. Dispos. 2004; 32: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), suggesting that the first molecule to bind is likely to be inhibitory at a lower Kd, but with a modest type 1 shift. The numerical approach compensates for depletion of free azamulin because of protein binding, which is not easily determined algebraically for models with two binding events. Figure 5B shows the fit for the sequential two-site binding model with the experiment data, and Table 1 summarizes results for four replicates. The relative spectral response 1 (RSR1) that relates the concentration of the binary complex to the mean change in absorbance is 0.031 ± 0.005, which is about a quarter of the value of RSR2 for the ternary complex, 0.12 ± 0.01. The apparent Kd for the initial binary complex in the sequential binding model is 0.65 ± 0.64 μM and 3.41 ± 0.60 μM for the ternary complex, which contributes most to spectral change. The Kd for the binary complex is similar to the IC50 reported for azamulin inhibition of 3A5 by Stresser et al. (14Stresser D.M. Broudy M.I. Ho T. Cargill C.E. Blanchard A.P. Sharma R. Dandeneau A.A.

Dispos. 2004; 32: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The Kd values for the intermediate binary complex exhibit higher variation (Table 1) between independent experiments because of its low contribution to spectral change. The recommended concentration for in vitro characterization of azamulin inhibition is 5 μM (14Stresser D.M. Broudy M.I. Ho T. Cargill C.E. Blanchard A.P. Sharma R. Dandeneau A.A. Goodwin J.J.

https://openalex.org/W4223620230,"Human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) play important roles in all stages of wound healing. However, in nonhealing wounds, fibroblasts are prone to aging, resulting in insufficient migration, proliferation and secretion functions. Recent studies have suggested that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are conducive to wound healing and cell growth through paracrine cytokine signaling. In our studies, we found that conditioned medium of MSCs pretreated with IFN-γ and TNF-α (IT MSC-CM) has abundant growth factors associated with wound repair. Our in vitro results showed that the effects of IT MSC-CM on promoting cell migration, proliferation and activation in HDFs were better than those of conditioned medium from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC-CM). Moreover, we embedded a scaffold material containing IT MSC-CM and reconfirmed that cell migration and activation were superior to that in the presence of MSC-CM in vivo. Generally, PDGF-BB is perceived as a promoter of the migration and proliferation of HDFs. Moreover, a high level of PDGF-BB in IT MSC-CM was detected, according to which we guess that the effect on HDFs may be mediated by the upregulation of PDGF-BB. These studies all showed the potential of IT MSC-CM to promote rapid and effective wound healing."

Position control of a 4 Degree of Freedom (DOF) serial robotic manipulator developed using Simulink is the problem under consideration. Three full state feedback control systems were developed, analyzed and compared for both steady-state and transient performance using the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and looptune . Initially, a single gain feedback controller was synthesized using LQR. This system was then modified by augmenting the state feedback controller with Proportional Integral (PI) and Integral regulators, thereby creating a second and third control system respectively. In both the second and third control systems, the LQR synthesized gain and additional gains were further tuned using looptune to achieve improvement in performance. The second and third systems were also compared in terms of tracking a time-dependent trajectory. Finally, the LQR and looptune synthesized controllers were tested for robustness by simultaneously increasing the mass of each manipulator link. In comparison to LQR, the second system consisting of Single Input Single Output (SISO) PI controllers and the state feedback matrix succeeded in meeting the control objectives in terms of performance, optimality, trajectory tracking, and robustness. The third system did not improve performance in contrast to LQR, but still showed robustness under mass variation. In conclusion, our results have shown looptune to have a comparatively better performance over LQR thereby highlighting its promising potential for future emerging control system applications."

Tactoids of filamentous Pf bacteriophage, such as those produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, have been linked to increased antibiotic tolerance. We modelled this system and show that tactoids composed of filamentous Pf virions can lead to antibiotic tolerance by acting as an adsorptive diffusion barrier. The continuum model, reminiscent of descriptions of reactive diffusion in porous media, has been solved numerically and good agreement was found with the analytical results, obtained using a homogenisation approach. We find that the formation of tactoids significantly increases antibiotic diffusion times which may lead to stronger antibiotic resistance."

Regions with a high incidence of tuberculosis, such as sub-Saharan Africa, are disproportionately burdened by stillbirth and other pregnancy complications. Active tuberculosis increases the risk of pregnancy complications, but the association between latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and pregnancy outcomes is unknown. We explored the effect of latent tuberculosis infection on the risk of stillbirth in women attending antenatal care clinics in Ethiopia, a country with >170 000 annual cases of active tuberculosis.Pregnant women were enrolled from antenatal care at three health facilities in Adama, Ethiopia, during 2015-2018, with assessment for previous and current active tuberculosis and testing for LTBI using QuantiFERON-TB-GOLD-PLUS. Proportions of stillbirth (≥ 20 weeks of gestation) and neonatal death (< 29 days of birth) were compared with respect to categories of maternal tuberculosis infection (tuberculosis-uninfected, LTBI, previous-, and current active tuberculosis). Multivariable logistic regression was performed for stillbirth.Among 1463 participants enrolled, the median age was 25 years, 10.2% were HIV-positive, 34.6% were primigravidae, and the median gestational age at inclusion was 18 weeks. Four (0.3%) were diagnosed with active tuberculosis during pregnancy, 68 (4.6%) reported previous treatment for active tuberculosis, 470 (32.1%) had LTBI, and 921 (63.0%) were tuberculosis-uninfected. Stillbirth was more frequent in participants with LTBI compared to tuberculosis-uninfected participants, although not reaching statistical significance (19/470, 4.0% vs 25/921, 2.7%, adjusted [for age, gravidity and HIV serostatus] odds ratio 1.38, 95% confidence interval 0.73-2.57, p = 0.30). Rates of neonatal death (5/470, 1.1% vs 10/921, 1.1%) were similar between these categories.Latent tuberculosis infection was not significantly associated with stillbirth or neonatal death in this cohort. Studies based on larger cohorts and with details on causes of stillbirth, as well as other pregnancy outcomes, are needed to further investigate this issue."
https://openalex.org/W4223517877,"The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a class of incurable diseases characterized by degeneration of the cerebellum that results in movement disorder. Recently, a new heritable form of SCA, spinocerebellar ataxia type 48 (SCA48), was attributed to dominant mutations in STIP1 homology and U box-containing 1 (STUB1); however, little is known about how these mutations cause SCA48. STUB1 encodes for the protein C terminus of Hsc70 interacting protein (CHIP), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. CHIP is known to regulate proteostasis by recruiting chaperones via a N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat domain and recruiting E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes via a C-terminal U-box domain. These interactions allow CHIP to mediate the ubiquitination of chaperone-bound, misfolded proteins to promote their degradation via the proteasome. Here we have identified a novel, de novo mutation in STUB1 in a patient with SCA48 encoding for an A52G point mutation in the tetratricopeptide repeat domain of CHIP. Utilizing an array of biophysical, biochemical, and cellular assays, we demonstrate that the CHIPA52G point mutant retains E3-ligase activity but has decreased affinity for chaperones. We further show that this mutant decreases cellular fitness in response to certain cellular stressors and induces neurodegeneration in a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans model of SCA48. Together, our data identify the A52G mutant as a cause of SCA48 and provide molecular insight into how mutations in STUB1 cause SCA48.

Rep. 2017; 37BSR20170251Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). While incidence of SCAR16 is very rare, recent work suggests that SCA48 may be a common cause of SCA (16Roux T. Barbier M.

The STUB1 gene encodes for the protein C terminus of Hsc70 interacting protein (CHIP). CHIP is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that sits at the interface of protein folding and protein degradation. CHIP recruits chaperones via a N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain and E2 ubiquitin–conjugating enzymes via a C-terminal U-box domain (23Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z.

Together, these data strongly argue that under normal conditions, CHIP plays a neuroprotective role. Here, we have identified a de novo mutation in a patient with ataxia that results in a single point mutation (CHIPA52G). Using an array of biophysical, biochemical, and cell-based assays, we demonstrate that the CHIPA52G mutant is defective in binding chaperones resulting in a defect in substrate ubiquitination. We also demonstrate that expression of the CHIPA52G mutant results in decreased cell viability in response to certain cellular stressors. Finally, we have generated the initial animal model of SCA48 and demonstrated that this mutation results in neurodegeneration. Together, our results identify a novel mutation in STUB1 that causes SCA48 and provides mechanistic insight into how mutations in STUB1 cause SCA48. A 52-year-old female was diagnosed with mild dysarthria, mild gait impairment with gradual progression, difficulties with fine motor activities and hand dexterity, mild bilateral dysmetria on finger-chase, mild bilateral dysdiadochokinesia, and mild gait ataxia. An MRI of the brain revealed prominent pan-cerebellar atrophy (data not shown). There was no family history of ataxia, so clinical whole-genome sequencing was performed, and a heterozygous variant of unknown significance was observed in the STUB1 gene encoding for a c.155C > G mutation that results in a single point mutation in the CHIP protein (A52G). Because dominant mutations in CHIP can cause SCA48, this suggests that the CHIPA52G mutant may be a novel mutant that causes SCA48 (Fig. 1). We previously found that most mutations in CHIP that cause SCAR16 result in aberrant oligomerization and destabilization of CHIP (37Kanack A.J. Newsom O.J. Scaglione K.M. Most mutations that cause spinocerebellar ataxia autosomal recessive type 16 (SCAR16) destabilize the protein quality-control E3 ligase CHIP.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 2735-2743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To analyze the CHIPA52G mutant, we first purified recombinant CHIPA52G (Fig. 2A) and analyzed its oligomeric status by gel filtration coupled with mass photometry (Fig. 2B). Unlike most SCAR16 mutants, we found that the CHIPA52G mutant did not have altered oligomeric properties (Fig. 2B). We next wanted to determine if the CHIPA52G mutant had decreased secondary structure or thermal stability. To test this, we performed circular dichroism (CD) with thermal melt analysis. By CD, we observed less negative signal at 208 and 222 nm with the CHIPA52G mutant compared to WT CHIP, consistent with a decrease in alpha helical content (Fig. 2C). Despite this decrease in alpha helical content with the CHIPA52G mutant, we did not observe a significant difference in thermal stability between CHIP and CHIPA52G with both proteins exhibiting three-state unfolding with transitions occurring at similar temperatures (Fig. 2C and Table 1).Table 1Melting temperatures of transitions 1 and 2 of CHIP and CHIPA52G1st transition2nd transitionCHIP42.0±0.5 °C56.2±1.1 °СCHIPA52G41.5±0.7 °C56.2±0.7 °C Open table in a new tab To assess the CHIPA52G mutant’s stability in cells, we transfected either WT or mutant CHIP into HEK293 cells and assessed their steady state levels by Western blot. In cells, we found that there was a very modest but significant decrease in CHIPA52G levels when compared to WT CHIP (Fig. 2, D and E). Finally, to determine if this difference in levels was due to accelerated degradation, we next performed a cycloheximide chase assay and found that the CHIPA52G mutant was degraded more rapidly in cells than WT CHIP (Fig. 2, F and G). Together, our data indicate there are no changes in the thermal stability or oligomeric status of the CHIPA52G mutant, but there are mild defects in its secondary structure and stability in cells. We next wanted to determine what aspects of CHIP function were disrupted by the A52G mutation. Residue A52 is highly conserved and within the TPR domain of CHIP that is necessary for the CHIP/chaperone interaction (Fig. 3, A–C). This led us to hypothesize that this mutation would disrupt CHIP’s ability to bind chaperones. To test this, we utilized a fluorescence polarization (FP) assay to measure the affinity of CHIP for the C terminus of Hsc70. In this assay, we utilize a rhodamine-labeled peptide (r-SSGPTIEEVD) that mimics the C terminus of Hsc70. Importantly, this peptide encodes the EEVD motif that binds the TPR domain of CHIP and is responsible for most, but not all, of the affinity between Hsc70 and CHIP (38Smith M.C. Scaglione K.M. Assimon V.A. Patury S. Thompson A.D. Dickey C.A. Southworth D.R. Paulson H.L. Gestwicki J.E. Zuiderweg E.R.

A bipartite interaction between Hsp70 and CHIP regulates ubiquitination of chaperoned client proteins.Structure. 2015; 23: 472-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Similar to previous studies, we found that the peptide-bound CHIP with a Kd of 1.7 μM (Fig. 3C) (37Kanack A.J. Newsom O.J. Scaglione K.M. Most mutations that cause spinocerebellar ataxia autosomal recessive type 16 (SCAR16) destabilize the protein quality-control E3 ligase CHIP.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 2735-2743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Consistent with the CHIPA52G mutant having a defect in chaperone binding, the CHIPA52G mutant had a roughly 10-fold decrease in affinity for the peptide with a Kd of 17.2 μM (Fig. 3D). To confirm that the interaction between CHIP and Hsp70 was defective in cells, we utilized the NanoBiT split-luciferase platform to monitor the interaction between CHIP and Hsp70 in living cells (Fig. S1) (40Nadel C.M. Ran X. Gestwicki J.E. Luminescence complementation assay for measurement of binding to protein C-termini in live cells.Anal. Biochem. 2020; 611: 113947Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Consistent with our FP data, we found that CHIPA52G had decreased luminescence compared to WT CHIP consistent with an impaired interaction with Hsp70 in cells (Fig. 3E). Together, these data are consistent with the CHIPA52G mutation impairing the CHIP/chaperone interaction. CHIP binds chaperones and ubiquitinates their client proteins targeting them to the proteasome for degradation. We next wanted to determine if the CHIPA52G mutant retained ubiquitin ligase activity. To accomplish this, we performed in vitro ubiquitination assays using either CHIP or CHIPA52G and analyzed ubiquitination of Hsp70, a bona fide CHIP substrate, by Western blot (33Qian S.B. McDonough H. Boellmann F. Cyr D.M. Patterson C. CHIP-mediated stress recovery by sequential ubiquitination of substrates and Hsp70.Nature. 2006; 440: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). While CHIP readily ubiquitinated Hsp70, the CHIPA52G mutant was largely deficient in ubiquitination of Hsp70 (Fig. 4A). Because we previously observed that the CHIPA52G mutant was deficient in binding chaperone proteins, we wanted to determine if the CHIPA52G mutant was truly deficient in ubiquitin transfer or if the reason we observed deficient Hsp70 ubiquitination was due to Hsp70 not efficiently binding CHIPA52G. To accomplish this, we probed our ubiquitination assay for ubiquitin. Consistent with the CHIPA52G mutant retaining ubiquitin ligase function, we observed that the CHIPA52G mutant did stimulate ubiquitin chain formation; however, less signal was observed with CHIPA52G when compared to CHIP (Fig. 4A). This decrease in signal could be due to either decreased ubiquitin ligase activity or it could be due to CHIP more efficiently ubiquitinating Hsp70 than autoubiquitinating itself or forming free ubiquitin chains. To differentiate between these possibilities, we next performed ubiquitination assays in the absence of Hsp70 using a fluorescently labeled ubiquitin and compared CHIP and CHIPA52G autoubiquitination. In the absence of Hsp70, we observed that there was no difference in CHIP and CHIPA52G autoubiquitination consistent with the CHIPA52G mutant retaining E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (Fig. 4, B and C). To confirm that the CHIPA52G mutant retained full E3 ligase activity, we next performed lysine discharge assays to measure the ability of CHIP and CHIPA52G to stimulate discharge of ubiquitin from the active site of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. In this assay, CHIP and CHIPA52G both efficiently stimulated the discharge of ubiquitin in the presence of lysine (Fig. 4, D and E). Together, these data indicate that the CHIPA52G mutant retains activity as a ubiquitin ligase but is deficient in recruiting chaperones and therefore loses the ability to ubiquitinate chaperone clients. Because CHIP plays a critical role in protecting cells from cellular stress, we next wanted to further test this and determine if the CHIPA52G mutant decreased cellular fitness. To accomplish this, we stressed cells with a panel of stressors and measured the LD50 for each stressor (Fig. 5, A–H) (41Wang B. Merillat S.A. Vincent M. Huber A.K. Basrur V. Mangelberger D. Zeng L. Elenitoba-Johnson K. Miller R.A. Irani D.N. Dlugosz A.A. Schnell S. Scaglione K.M. Paulson H.L.

Chem. 2016; 291: 3030-3042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Consistent with the CHIPA52G mutant having a toxic gain of function or a dominant negative effect, we found that expression of CHIPA52G decreased cellular fitness when cells were challenged with a subset of stressors including high levels of glucose, thapsigargin, and cadmium (Fig. 5, B–D). Of note, expression of CHIPA52G did not decrease cellular fitness to all stressors as no difference in LD50 was observed when cells were treated with tunicamycin, methyl methanesulfonate, hydrogen peroxide, and ammonium chloride (Fig. 5, E–H). Together, these data suggest that the CHIPA52G mutant has either a toxic gain of function or a dominant negative effect and decreases cellular viability under certain conditions of cellular stress. Our data demonstrate that CHIPA52G has defects both in vitro and in cells; however, the effect of CHIPA52G on causing neurodegeneration is unknown. To determine if CHIPA52G expression results in neurodegeneration, we next produced transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans pan neuronally expressing either CHIP or CHIPA52G. Importantly, our transgenic C. elegans were created in the presence of endogenous CHIP to more accurately model this dominant form of SCA. We next imaged C. elegans PVD neurons to determine if the CHIPA52G mutation resulted in neurodegeneration. Consistent with the CHIPA52G mutation inducing neurodegeneration, we observed bead-like structures along neuronal processes that are enriched with autophagosomes and fragmented microtubules (42E L.

https://openalex.org/W4223643206,"There is limited evidence on the effects of environmental exposure to arsenic (As) on the immune system in adults. In a population-based study, we have found that urinary As (UAs), and its metabolites [inorganic As (InAs), monomethylated arsenicals (MMA +3/+5 ), and dimethylated arsenicals (DMA +3/+5 )] modulate or influence the number of T-helper 17 (Th17) cells and IL-17A cytokine production. In non-smoking women, we observed that UAs and DMA +3/+5 were associated with changes in Th17 cell numbers in a nonlinear fashion. In smoking males, we found that UAs was associated with a significant decrease of Th17 cell numbers. Similar association was observed among non-smoking males. Likewise, UAs, DMA +3/+5 and MMA +3/+5 were associated with diminished production of IL-17A among non-smoking males. When stratified by Vitamin D levels defined as sufficient (≥20 ng/ml) and insufficient (&lt;20 ng/ml), we found a substancial decrease in Th17 cell numbers among those with insufficient levels. Individuals with sufficient VitD levels demonstrated significant inhibition of IL-17A production in non-smoking males. Collectively, we find that exposure to As via drinking water is associated with alterations in Th17 numbers and IL-17A production, and that these associations may be modified by Vitamin D status. Our findings have significance for health outcomes associated with As exposure."
https://openalex.org/W4226056189,"Huntington’s disease (HD) is caused by an expansion of the CAG trinucleotide repeat domain in the huntingtin gene that results in expression of a mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) containing an expanded polyglutamine tract in the amino terminus. A number of therapeutic approaches that aim to reduce mHTT expression either locally in the CNS or systemically are in clinical development. We have previously described sensitive and selective assays that measure human HTT proteins either in a polyglutamine-independent (detecting both mutant expanded and non-expanded proteins) or in a polyglutamine length-dependent manner (detecting the disease-causing polyglutamine repeats) on the electrochemiluminescence Meso Scale Discovery detection platform. These original assays relied upon polyclonal antibodies. To ensure an accessible and sustainable resource for the HD field, we developed similar assays employing monoclonal antibodies. We demonstrate that these assays have equivalent sensitivity compared to our previous assays through the evaluation of cellular and animal model systems, as well as HD patient biosamples. We also demonstrate cross-site validation of these assays, allowing direct comparison of studies performed in geographically distinct laboratories."
https://openalex.org/W4223417862,"The active sites of the proteasome are housed within its central core particle (CP), a barrel-shaped chamber of four stacked heptameric rings, and access of substrates to the CP interior is mediated by gates at either axial end. These gates are constitutively closed and may be opened by the regulatory particle (RP), which binds the CP and facilitates substrate degradation. We recently showed that the heterodimeric CP assembly chaperones Pba1/2 also mediate gate opening through an unexpected structural arrangement that facilitates the insertion of the N terminus of Pba1 into the CP interior; however, the full mechanism of Pba1/2-mediated gate opening is unclear. Here, we report a detailed analysis of CP gate modulation by Pba1/2. The clustering of key residues at the interface between neighboring α-subunits is a critical feature of RP-mediated gate opening, and we find that Pba1/2 recapitulate this strategy. Unlike RP, which inserts at six α-subunit interfaces, Pba1/2 insert at only two α-subunit interfaces. Nevertheless, Pba1/2 are able to regulate six of the seven interfacial clusters, largely through direct interactions. The N terminus of Pba1 also physically interacts with the center of the gate, disrupting the intersubunit contacts that maintain the closed state. This novel mechanism of gate modulation appears to be unique to Pba1/2 and therefore likely occurs only during proteasome assembly. Our data suggest that release of Pba1/2 at the conclusion of assembly is what allows the nascent CP to assume its mature gate conformation, which is primarily closed, until activated by RP."
https://openalex.org/W4223438963,"The sugars streptose and dihydrohydroxystreptose (DHHS) are unique to the bacteria Streptomyces griseus and Coxiella burnetii, respectively. Streptose forms the central moiety of the antibiotic streptomycin, while DHHS is found in the O-antigen of the zoonotic pathogen C. burnetii. Biosynthesis of these sugars has been proposed to follow a similar path to that of TDP-rhamnose, catalyzed by the enzymes RmlA, RmlB, RmlC, and RmlD, but the exact mechanism is unclear. Streptose and DHHS biosynthesis unusually requires a ring contraction step that could be performed by orthologs of RmlC or RmlD. Genome sequencing of S. griseus and C. burnetii has identified StrM and CBU1838 proteins as RmlC orthologs in these respective species. Here, we demonstrate that both enzymes can perform the RmlC 3'',5'' double epimerization activity necessary to support TDP-rhamnose biosynthesis in vivo. This is consistent with the ring contraction step being performed on a double epimerized substrate. We further demonstrate that proton exchange is faster at the 3''-position than the 5''-position, in contrast to a previously studied ortholog. We additionally solved the crystal structures of CBU1838 and StrM in complex with TDP and show that they form an active site highly similar to those of the previously characterized enzymes RmlC, EvaD, and ChmJ. These results support the hypothesis that streptose and DHHS are biosynthesized using the TDP pathway and that an RmlD paralog most likely performs ring contraction following double epimerization. This work will support the elucidation of the full pathways for biosynthesis of these unique sugars."

The hydrolases involved in this process (called autolysins) are potentially lethal enzymes that can cause cell death; their activity, therefore, must be tightly controlled during cell growth. In Enterococcus faecalis, the N-acetylglucosaminidase AtlA plays a predominant role in cell separation. atlA mutants form long cell chains and are significantly less virulent in the zebrafish model of infection. The attenuated virulence of atlA mutants is underpinned by a limited dissemination of bacterial chains in the host organism and a more efficient uptake by phagocytes that clear the infection. AtlA has structural homologs in other important pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium, and therefore represents an attractive model to design new inhibitors of bacterial pathogenesis. Here, we provide a 1.45 Å crystal structure of the E. faecalis AtlA catalytic domain that reveals a closed conformation of a conserved β-hairpin and a complex network of hydrogen bonds that bring two catalytic residues to the ideal distance for an inverting mechanism.

During pathogenesis, E. faecalis has evolved several mechanisms that enable this organism to evade the host innate immune system. These include the production of two distinct cell surface polymers (a capsule and a rhamnopolysaccharide) that play an antiphagocytic role (for review, see Ref. (3Ramos Y. Sansone S. Morales D.K. Sugarcoating it: Enterococcal polysaccharides as key modulators of host-pathogen interactions.PLoS Pathog. 2021; 17e1009822Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar)). Another mechanism relies on the control of cell chain length. E. faecalis has a distinctive morphology and forms diplococci and short cell chains made of four to eight cells. The disruption of cell separation at the end of the division, leading to the formation of cell chains, has a dramatic impact on virulence. It prevents the dissemination of bacteria from causing a systemic infection and leads to the uptake of cell chains by phagocytes (4Salamaga B. Prajsnar T.K. Jareno-Martinez A. Willemse J. Bewley M.A. Chau F. Ben Belkacem T. Meijer A.H. Dockrell D.H. Renshaw S.A. Mesnage S. Bacterial size matters: Multiple mechanisms controlling septum cleavage and diplococcus formation are critical for the virulence of the opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis.PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13e1006526Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). One peptidoglycan (PG) hydrolase, AtlA, has a predominant role in E. faecalis septum cleavage. atlA mutants are viable but form extremely long chains and are greatly attenuated in the zebrafish virulence model of infection (4Salamaga B. Prajsnar T.K. Jareno-Martinez A. Willemse J. Bewley M.A. Chau F. Ben Belkacem T. Meijer A.H. Dockrell D.H. Renshaw S.A. Mesnage S. Bacterial size matters: Multiple mechanisms controlling septum cleavage and diplococcus formation are critical for the virulence of the opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis.PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13e1006526Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that AtlA activity contributes to the bactericidal activity of beta-lactam antibiotics (5Bravetti A.L. Mesnage S. Lefort A. Chau F. Eckert C. Garry L. Arthur M. Fantin B. Contribution of the autolysin AtlA to the bactericidal activity of amoxicillin against Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2.Antimicrob.

Agents Chemother. 2011; 55: 910-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Based on the contribution of AtlA to pathogenesis and antibiotics-mediated killing, this PG hydrolase represents an attractive target to prevent enterococcal infections whilst limiting microbiota changes. AtlA is a multimodular N-acetylglucosaminidase belonging to the glycoside hydrolase GH73 family in the CAZy (Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes Database) (7Drula E. Garron M.L. Dogan S. Lombard V. Henrissat B. Terrapon N. The carbohydrate-active enzyme database: Functions and literature.Nucleic Acids Res. 2022; 50: D571-D577Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To avoid AtlA-mediated autolysis, the activity of AtlA is tightly controlled, both spatially and temporally (4Salamaga B. Prajsnar T.K. Jareno-Martinez A. Willemse J. Bewley M.A. Chau F. Ben Belkacem T. Meijer A.H. Dockrell D.H. Renshaw S.A. Mesnage S. Bacterial size matters: Multiple mechanisms controlling septum cleavage and diplococcus formation are critical for the virulence of the opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis.PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13e1006526Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The enzyme undergoes post-translational modifications (glycosylation and proteolytic cleavage) and preferentially binds to denuded glycan chains (preferentially found at the midcell) via the C-terminal LysM domain (8Eckert C. Lecerf M. Dubost L. Arthur M. Mesnage S. Functional analysis of AtlA, the major N-acetylglucosaminidase of Enterococcus faecalis.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8513-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the first structure that captures a closed conformation of the active site indicating a single-displacement (inverting) mechanism. We further provide a structure–function analysis of AtlA catalytic domain. We demonstrate an endoglucosaminidase activity and identify the critical residues for catalysis both in vitro and in the context of the live bacteria. Based on these data, we propose a model for the interaction of AtlA with PG, a first step toward the rational design of specific inhibitors targeting this enterococcal virulence factor. The structure of the catalytic domain of AtlA (AtlAc) (161 residues) was solved at a resolution of 1.45 Å. It adopts a lysozyme α/β fold with an α-lobe containing five α-helices (α1: 180–197, α2: 202–213; α3: 265–278, α4: 299–306, and α5: 315–327), five helices 310, a small β-hairpin (280–286), and a major β-lobe covering the binding site, made of two antiparallel β-strands (β1: 239–248, β2: 251–260) connecting α2 and α3 (Fig. 1A). This fold superimposes with Auto from Listeria monocytogenes with an rmsd of 1.02 Å for 107 Cα atoms and with FlgJ from Salmonella Typhimurium (FlgJSt) with an rmsd of 2.2 Å for 119Cα, which account for the larger opening of the β-hairpin (Fig. 1, B and D) (9Bublitz M. Polle L. Holland C. Heinz D.W. Nimtz M. Schubert W.D. Structural basis for autoinhibition and activation of auto, a virulence-associated peptidoglycan hydrolase of Listeria monocytogenes.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 1509-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The structure also contains five glycerol molecules coming from the cryogenic buffer. Only one polypeptide of AtlAc is found in the asymmetric unit, suggesting that the protein is monomeric in solution. The AtlAc active site shows two highly conserved glutamate residues: E212 is equivalent to L. monocytogenes Auto E122 and FlgJSt E184 catalytic residues and is located at a similar position, at the end of helix α1 (Fig. 1B). The second predicted catalytic glutamate, E246, stands on β2 and is equivalent to E156 in L. monocytogenes Auto and E223 in FlgJSt. Unlike Auto and FlgJSt, which show an open groove for the active site, the AtlAc active site shapes into a tunnel (Fig. 1C). The β-hairpin closing on the α-lobe by forming several hydrogen bonds: E246 OE2 on strand β1 with K232 NZ on a loop between α2 and β1, E246 with T312 OG1 and the water molecule 12 (Wat12), and T312 OG1 with Y247 main chain N (Fig. 1C). K232 makes also a bond with OE1 E257 on β2, but this Glu residue is not conserved in the GH73 family (Figs. 1C and 2). Several aromatic residues that have been proposed to be essential for substrate binding or catalysis in GH73 members are also conserved in AtlAc, namely Y310, which belongs to the YATD motif, a signature motif of the GH73 family, Y316, F259, and F229 (Figs. 1C and 2) (10Lipski A. Herve M. Lombard V. Nurizzo D. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Bourne Y. Vincent F. Structural and biochemical characterization of the beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase from Thermotoga maritima: Toward rationalization of mechanistic knowledge in the GH73 family.Glycobiology. 2015; 25: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of AtlAc revealed a partial occlusion of the catalytic tunnel by the K232 residue (Fig. 1C). Based on the analysis of other GH73 catalytic domains, we hypothesized that this residue is flexible to allow the recognition of long glycan chains. An alternative explanation could be that AtlA displays exoglucosaminidase activity, thereby accommodating a smaller substrate in the catalytic tunnel. To test our hypothesis, we investigated whether AtlA displays exoglucosaminidase or endoglucosaminidase activity. Purified PG sacculi were incubated in the presence of increasing amounts of recombinant AtlA, and solubilized muropeptides were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC. We anticipated that an exoglucosaminidase would release monomeric PG fragments, whilst an endoglucosaminidase activity would release monomeric and multimeric structures simultaneously. The comparison of muropeptide profiles suggested that AltlA displays endoglucosaminidase activity as it generated the same proportion of muropeptides with different oligomerization states, irrespective of the amount of enzyme added (Fig. 3). Despite several attempts to cocrystallize AtlA catalytic domain with chitooligosaccharides and to soak crystals in ligand solutions, we have not been able to obtain AtlA-GlcNAc cocrystals. To gain insight into AtlA catalytic mechanism and PG binding mode, we therefore docked a PG fragment to the crystal structure of the enzyme. We used a tetrasaccharide chain (MurNAc−2–GlcNAc−1–MurNAc+1–GlcNAc+2) with MurNAc residues substituted by short tripeptide stems found in E. faecalis PG (l-Ala-γD-Gln-l-Lys) and amenable to docking experiments (Fig. S1). The ligand was docked to a grid that encompasses the putative active site of AtlA and includes the two predicted catalytic glutamates, E212 and E246. The protein was kept rigid except for K232, which blocks part of the active-site tunnel and has to be flexible to accommodate the substrate and allow AtlA endoglucosaminidase activity. The docking produced eight poses for the ligand with binding energies ranging from −6.5 to −5.4 kcal/mol. Figure 4A shows the docked complex with the ligand in its best (lowest energy) binding pose. Interestingly, docking experiments using PG ligands with shorter side chains (l-Ala–d-Gln or l-Ala) produced the same pose as for the longer side chain (Fig. S2). The ligand adopts an extended conformation that spans the active site of AtlA, going through the tunnel that contains the two putative catalytic glutamates. The oxygen of E212 is located 2.8 Å away from the glycosidic bond, in agreement with the cleavage of the glycosidic bond between GlcNAc−1 and MurNAc+1. The ligand mainly interacts via the GlcNAc−1 moiety, making several hydrogen bonds with the backbones of G230, W245, Y310, T312, D313, and with the side chain of E246 (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the MurNAc+1–GlcNAc+2 part of the substrate is the first to leave the active site after cleavage. The other sugar moieties of the ligand also establish hydrogen bonds with the protein via MurNAc−2 (with Y310), MurNAc+1 (with E212), and GlcNAc+2 (with D243). Although potential interactions may involve the amino acid side chains of the ligands (e.g., with residue V211), the flexibility of the peptide stems renders such predictions unreliable. Based on the structural analysis of the AtlA catalytic domain and the docking of a PG fragment, we investigated the role of several residues potentially involved in substrate recognition and catalysis. These included the catalytic glutamate residue E246 that had not been previously studied, K232, F259, T312, and Y316. Y247 was added as a control, as this residue is not expected to contribute to the catalytic activity of AtlA. To conserve the hydrophobic nature, the steric hindrance, or the polar nature of the residues, we mutated F259 into V, T312 into V, Y247 and 316 into S, and E246 into Q. K232 was mutated into A to remove its charge. The expression plasmid encoding full-length recombinant AtlA was mutagenized to introduce these six mutations in the catalytic domain. All recombinant proteins were expressed as soluble proteins and were purified by affinity chromatography (Fig. 5A). CD confirmed that the mutations had no major impact on the overall fold of the recombinant proteins (Fig. S3). Using Micrococcus lysodeikticus autoclaved cells as a substrate, we determined the specific activity of individual mutants using a spectrophotometric assay (Fig. S4). The Y247S and Y316S mutations had a limited impact on in vitro–specific activity (2.2-fold and 2.4-fold decrease, respectively) whilst the four other mutations (K232A, F259V, T312V, and E246Q) had a pronounced impact, leading to residual activities between 2.5% and 5.3% when compared with the WT enzyme (Fig. 5B). AtlA is a secreted autolysin that undergoes post-translational modifications including proteolytic cleavage and glycosylation (4Salamaga B. Prajsnar T.K. Jareno-Martinez A. Willemse J. Bewley M.A. Chau F. Ben Belkacem T. Meijer A.H. Dockrell D.H. Renshaw S.A. Mesnage S. Bacterial size matters: Multiple mechanisms controlling septum cleavage and diplococcus formation are critical for the virulence of the opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis.PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13e1006526Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To confirm the results obtained with recombinant proteins in vitro, we sought to measure the impact of mutations using cell chain length as a readout of enzymatic activity in live bacteria (Fig. 6). Each mutation was introduced on the chromosome by allelic exchange, and the forward scattered light associated with mutant cells was measured by flow cytometry to investigate the capacity of individual AtlA mutant proteins to cleave the septum. All mutant proteins were produced at a similar level, indicating that mutations had very little (if any) impact on stability (Fig. 6A). The results were consistent with previous enzymatic assays and the docking model. Y247S has no impact on septum cleavage, confirming that the mutation does not affect the structure of the enzyme. The other five mutations had a clear impact on septum cleavage, forming cell chains significantly longer than the WT (Fig. 6B). As expected, E212Q and E246Q mutations had the most pronounced impact on AtlA activity, leading to the formation of extremely long cell chains. Both F259 and K232 were shown to be critical for AtlA activity, whilst T312 had a relatively limited role. The enzymatic assays using recombinant AtlA and measurement of septum cleavage in strains expressing AtlA variant provided insightful information to propose a catalytic mechanism. E212 is strictly conserved in the GH73 enzyme family and was previously identified as an essential catalytic residue (4Salamaga B. Prajsnar T.K. Jareno-Martinez A. Willemse J. Bewley M.A. Chau F. Ben Belkacem T. Meijer A.H. Dockrell D.H. Renshaw S.A. Mesnage S. Bacterial size matters: Multiple mechanisms controlling septum cleavage and diplococcus formation are critical for the virulence of the opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis.PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13e1006526Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It is positioned at the end of helix α2, on a highly conserved α-lobe and superimposes with E122 from L. monocytogenes Auto (9Bublitz M. Polle L. Holland C. Heinz D.W. Nimtz M. Schubert W.D. Structural basis for autoinhibition and activation of auto, a virulence-associated peptidoglycan hydrolase of Listeria monocytogenes.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 1509-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and E184 from FlgJSt (11Zaloba P. Bailey-Elkin B.A. Derksen M. Mark B.L. Structural and Biochemical insights into the peptidoglycan hydrolase domain of FlgJ from Salmonella typhimurium.PLoS One. 2016; 11e0149204Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). AtlA E212 can therefore be confidently identified as the catalytic proton donor. A second glutamate, E246, is positioned on strand β1 like E156 in Auto and E223 in FlgJSt (Fig. 1B et D) and has been proposed to be a nucleophile/base catalyst. This second glutamate residue is conserved only in a subgroup of proteobacteria and the bacteroidetes as mentioned in the phylogenetic study that classified the GH73 sequences into five different clusters (10Lipski A. Herve M. Lombard V. Nurizzo D. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Bourne Y. Vincent F.

In clusters 1 and 2, GH73 enzymes possess a β-lobe that folds into an extended β-hairpin that contributes to shaping the active site and harbors a conserved glutamate (10Lipski A. Herve M. Lombard V. Nurizzo D. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Bourne Y. Vincent F.

This β-hairpin has been modeled in Auto, FlgJSt, and more recently in Sphingomonas sp. FlgJ but is often incomplete in other structural homologs like TM0633 because of its flexibility (9Bublitz M. Polle L. Holland C. Heinz D.W. Nimtz M. Schubert W.D. Structural basis for autoinhibition and activation of auto, a virulence-associated peptidoglycan hydrolase of Listeria monocytogenes.Mol.

Commun. 2009; 381: 16-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In Auto and FlgJSt structures, the position of the β-hairpin places the two catalytic glutamates at 13 and 20 Å apart, respectively, and this is due to the presence of an α-helix or a β-strand of a neighboring symmetry monomer that occludes their active sites (9Bublitz M. Polle L. Holland C. Heinz D.W. Nimtz M. Schubert W.D. Structural basis for autoinhibition and activation of auto, a virulence-associated peptidoglycan hydrolase of Listeria monocytogenes.Mol.

Commun. 2009; 381: 16-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). In these structures, the β-hairpin is widely open, and the authors suggest that the β-hairpin takes this position to accommodate the substrate in the active site. In AtlAc, the β-hairpin shows a “closed” conformation and the distance between E212 and E246 is 9 Å, which is the distance required for a classic type 2 nucleophile substitution with an inverting mechanism (13McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Mechanisms of enzymatic glycoside hydrolysis.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7A). We, therefore, propose that E212 acts as a general acid to protonate the glycosidic oxygen, favoring the aglycon departure, while the general base E246 activates a water molecule to make a nucleophile attack on the sugar anomeric carbon. E246 OE1 is making a hydrogen bond with a Wat12 and K232 (Fig. 7B). This water molecule could therefore be activated by E246 if the latter encounters a displacement of a negative charge and takes a proton from Wat12, which will, in turn, be able to perform the nucleophilic attack on the anomeric carbon of the substrate. In previous studies where structural homologs show a β-hairpin widely open, the authors proposed that the β-hairpin will undergo several conformational changes to accommodate the substrate in the active site and subsequently place the two catalytic glutamate residues at the proper distance for hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond (13McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Mechanisms of enzymatic glycoside hydrolysis.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Our crystallographic data strongly support this model and suggest a contribution of a conserved lysine residue (K232) in this process, as demonstrated by the loss of AtlA activity associated with the K232 mutation both in vitro and in vivo. The structures of Auto and FlgJSt illustrate intermediary positions of the β-hairpin. In the widely open active site of FlgJSt, K207 is too far to contact E223, whereas in Auto, K142 can bind to the catalytic E156 and make electrostatic contact to initiate the closing of the β-hairpin. Our AtlAc crystal structure shows the electrostatic bond between K232 and E246 maintaining the position of the β-hairpin resulting in a closed active site (Fig. 7A). We propose that this electrostatic contact between the K232 and the E246 stabilizes the charges to help its attack on the water molecule. The identification of the endoglucosaminidase activity together with modeling of the tetrasaccharide peptide bound in the active site indicates that after the movement of the β-hairpin, K232 adopts another conformation to allow substrate binding and catalysis. Collectively, our results indicate that AtlA uses an inverting mechanism to hydrolyze the β-1,4 glycosidic bond. All strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Table S1. The bacteria were grown at 37 °C in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth or agar (15 g/l) (Difco Laboratories).

E. faecalis transformants were selected with 30 μg/ml erythromycin. pML420 was built to express AtlA catalytic domain. The DNA fragment encoding amino acids 172 to 337 was PCR amplified from V583 genomic DNA (14Paulsen I.T. Banerjei L. Myers G.S. Nelson K.E. Seshadri R. Read T.D. Fouts D.E. Eisen J.A. Gill S.R.

Data from the 'first wave' was used for derivation (n = 5,475 patients). Age, sex, the interaction between age and sex, and the number of cardiovascular conditions and/or diabetes (0, 1, or ≥2) were pre-specified as candidate predictors. This full model was (i) compared to a simple model including only age and sex and its interaction, and (ii) externally validated in COVID-19 patients during the 'second wave' (n = 16,693).The full model performed better than the simple model (likelihood ratio test p<0.001). Older male patients with multiple cardiovascular conditions and/or diabetes had the highest predicted risk of hospital referral, reaching risks above 15-20%, whereas on average this risk was 5.1%. The temporally validated c-statistic was 0.747 (95%CI 0.729-0.764) and the model showed good calibration upon validation.For patients with COVID-19 symptoms managed in primary care, the risk of hospital referral was on average 5.1%. Older, male and cardiovascular vulnerable COVID-19 patients are more at risk for hospital referral."
https://openalex.org/W3207971883,"Quantum annealing has gained considerable attention because it can be applied to combinatorial optimization problems, which have numerous applications in logistics, scheduling, and finance. In recent years, with the technical development of quantum annealers, research on solving practical combinatorial optimization problems using them has accelerated. However, researchers struggle to find practical combinatorial optimization problems, for which quantum annealers outperform mathematical optimization solvers. Moreover, there are only a few studies that compare the performance of quantum annealers with the state-of-the-art solvers, such as Gurobi and CPLEX. This study determines that quantum annealing demonstrates better performance than the solvers in that the solvers take longer to reach the objective function value of the solution obtained by the quantum annealers for the break minimization problem in a mirrored double round-robin tournament. We also explain the desirable performance of quantum annealing for the sparse interaction between variables and a problem without constraints. In this process, we demonstrate that this problem can be expressed as a 4-regular graph. Through computational experiments, we solve this problem using our quantum annealing approach and two-integer programming approaches, which were performed using the latest quantum annealer D-Wave Advantage, and Gurobi, respectively. Further, we compare the quality of the solutions and the computational time. Quantum annealing was able to determine the exact solution in 0.05 seconds for problems with 20 teams, which is a practical size. In the case of 36 teams, it took 84.8 s for the integer programming method to reach the objective function value, which was obtained by the quantum annealer in 0.05 s. These results not only present the break minimization problem in a mirrored double round-robin tournament as an example of applying quantum annealing to practical optimization problems, but also contribute to find problems that can be effectively solved by quantum annealing."

We wanted to assess if the thrombus can be characterized according to erythrocyte content and age using intravascular optical coherence tomography (OCT) in a clinical setting.We performed manual thrombus aspiration in 66 STEMI patients. OCT was done of the thrombus remnants after aspiration. A light intensity ratio was measured through the thrombus. Forty two of the aspirates had thrombus which could be analyzed histomorphologically for analysis of erythrocyte and platelet content, and to determine the age of thrombus as fresh, lytic or organized. There were 11 red, 21 white and 10 mixed thrombi. Furthermore, 36 aspirates had elements of fresh, 7 of lytic and 8 of organized thrombi. There was no correlation between colour and age. OCT appearance could not predict erythrocyte or platelet content. The light intensity ratios were not significantly different in fresh, lytic or organized thrombi.OCT could not differentiate between red and white thrombi, nor determine thrombus age."
https://openalex.org/W4223430623,"We estimate the lifetime attributable risk (LAR) of lung cancer incidence in symptomatic Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) patients receiving enhanced Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) and the unenhanced Computed Tomography Calcium Scoring (CTCS) examination. Retrospective analysis has been made of CCTA and CTCS data collected for 87 confirmed CAD adult patients. Patient effective dose (E) and organ doses (ODs) were calculated using CT-EXPO. Statistical correlation and the differences between E and ODs in enhanced CCTA and unenhanced CTCS were calculated using the Pearson coefficient and Wilcoxon unpaired t-test. Following BEIR VII report guidance, organ-specific LARs for the cohort were estimated using the organ-equivalent dose-to-risk conversion factor for numbers of cases per 100,000 patients exposed to low doses of 0.1 Gy. Significant statistical difference (p<0.0001) is found between E obtained for CTCS and that of CCTA. The scan length was found to be greater in CCTA (17.5 ± 2.9 cm) compared to that for CTCS (15 ± 2 cm). More elevated values of dose were noted for the esophagus (4.2 ± 2.15 mSv) and thymus (9.6 ± 2.54 mSv) for both CTCS and CCTA. CTCS organ doses were lower than that of CCTA. Per 100,000 patients, female cumulative doses are seen to give rise to greater lung cancer LARs compared to that for males, albeit with risk varying significantly, noticeably greater for females, younger patients and combined CCTA and CTCS scans. While scan parameters and tube-modulation methods clearly contribute to patient dose, mAs offers by far the greater contribution."

However, the role of testosterone in atopic diseases has remained undefined. We aimed to investigate this role.This retrospective cohort study was conducted using the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Patients with prostate cancer were categorized into two groups according to whether they received GnRH analogue treatment (study group I) or not (study group II), and men without prostate cancer and with no GnRH analogue use were defined to comprise the comparison group after their ages and index years were matched with group II. Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the hazard ratio (HR) of atopic diseases.Group I, group II, and the comparison group comprised 663, 2,172, and 8,688 individuals, respectively. Group I had a significantly lower risk of atopic diseases (adjusted HR: 0.66, 95% CI, 0.49-0.89, p < 0.01) than did group II. A reduced risk of atopic diseases was found when GnRH analogues were prescribed for 2 months (adjusted HR 0.53, 95% CI, 0.29-0.97, p = 0.04) and 2-14 months (adjusted HR 0.66, 95% CI, 0.49-0.89, p = 0.007). No significant difference in the risk of atopic diseases between group II and the comparison group was observed.A decreased risk of atopic diseases was observed in patients with prostate cancer treated with GnRH analogues. Further studies are warranted to verify the association between testosterone levels and atopic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4223477582,"Molecular chaperones safeguard cellular protein homeostasis and obviate proteotoxicity. In the process of aging, as chaperone networks decline, aberrant protein amyloid aggregation accumulates in a mechanism that underpins neurodegeneration, leading to pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Thus, it is important to identify and characterize chaperones for preventing such protein aggregation. In this work, we identified that the NAD+ synthase-nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) 3 from mouse (mN3) exhibits potent chaperone activity to antagonize aggregation of a wide spectrum of pathological amyloid client proteins including α-synuclein, Tau (K19), amyloid β, and islet amyloid polypeptide. By combining NMR spectroscopy, cross-linking mass spectrometry, and computational modeling, we further reveal that mN3 uses different region of its amphiphilic surface near the active site to directly bind different amyloid client proteins. Our work demonstrates a client recognition mechanism of NMNAT via which it chaperones different amyloid client proteins against pathological aggregation and implies a potential protective role for NMNAT in different amyloid-associated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4223478362,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most frequent cancers worldwide. Our aim was to evaluate the availability of results of interventional studies studying CRC. We searched the ClinicalTrials.gov registry for all interventional studies on CRC management in adults completed or terminated between 01/01/2013 and 01/01/2020. To identify results, we searched for results posted on the ClinicalTrials.gov registry and/or published in a full-text article. Our primary outcome was the proportion of CRC interventional studies with available results (i.e. posted on the ClinicalTrials.gov registry and/or published in a full-text article). Secondary outcomes were 1) median time between primary completion and earliest date of results availability, 2) the cumulative percentage of interventional studies with results available over time 3) the cumulative percentage of interventional studies with results posted on the ClinicalTrials.gov registry over time and 4) the percentage of results available in open access. We identified 763 eligible interventional studies in ClinicalTrials.gov, which included 679 198 patients. Of these, 286 (37%) trials, including 270 845 (40%) patients, did not have any results available. Median time for results availability was 32.6 months (IQ 16.1-unreached). The cumulative percentage of interventional studies with available results was 17% at 12 months, 39% at 24 months and 55% at 36 months. Results were more likely available for trials that were randomized, completed, had one trial site in the United States, and with mixed funding. The cumulative percentage of interventional studies with results posted on ClinicalTrials.gov was 2% at 12 months. Results were available in open access for 420 (420/477 = 88%) trials. Our results highlight an important waste in research for interventional studies studying CRC."
https://openalex.org/W4223538309,"Metabolic pathway design is an essential step in the course of constructing an efficient microbial cell factory to produce high value-added chemicals. Meanwhile, the computational design of biologically meaningful metabolic pathways has been attracting much attention to produce natural and non-natural products. However, there has been a lack of effective methods to perform metabolic network reduction automatically. In addition, comprehensive evaluation indexes for metabolic pathway are still relatively scarce. Here, we define a novel uniform similarity to calculate the main substrate-product pairs of known biochemical reactions, and develop further an efficient metabolic pathway design tool named PyMiner. As a result, the redundant information of general metabolic network (GMN) is eliminated, and the number of substrate-product pairs is shown to decrease by 81.62% on average. Considering that the nodes in the extracted metabolic network (EMN) constructed in this work is large in scale but imbalanced in distribution, we establish a conditional search strategy (CSS) that cuts search time in 90.6% cases. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, PyMiner shows obvious advantages and demonstrates equivalent or better performance on 95% cases of experimentally verified pathways. Consequently, PyMiner is a practical and effective tool for metabolic pathway design."

https://openalex.org/W4223640191,"This study analyzes aggregate data on trade flows to examine the performance of bilateral free trade agreements (BFTAs) between the United States and 11 BFTA nations in a two-dimensional approach. In line with the literature, this study applies the gravity model and analyzes the effect of the treatment using Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood (PPML) panel data from 1992 to 2017. We use the PPML as an alternative methodology to an ordinary least squares model, as it can treat zero trade values and lead to unbiased estimates and different consistencies. We consider the trade in goods but excluded services because of the different nature of trade for services. Moreover, this study highlights the quantitative performance of BFTAs without considering the industry level to compare the overall benefits for the trade flows from the U.S. as an exporter to BFTA countries and vice versa. It thus adds to the debate on the effect of FTAs on trade flows and conducts pre-FTA and post-FTA analyses to compare the volumes of exports and imports during both periods. Findings vary according to the direction of trade; notably, some trading partners increased their trading volume to 388%. In sum, this paper provides a collective current state assessment to demonstrate the most plausible reasons for the effects of the 11 BFTAs, in addition to informing policymakers on the lessons learned from each BFTA."
https://openalex.org/W4225914372,"The fire characteristics under natural ventilation in the cable compartment of the utility tunnel are studied. A series of small-scale fire experimental tests are conducted to obtain the maximum temperature below the ceiling of different ignition vertical heights and cable types. In this paper, the ceiling temperature decay and heat release rate (HRR) are studied in the cable compartment of utility tunnel. Through experimental tests, the fire characteristics of placing the fire source on the near wall side 3.0 m away from the shaft of the utility tunnel cable compartment are studied. The results showed that under the action of natural ventilation, with the decrease of fuel quantity, the mass loss of cable decreases, and the maximum temperature below the ceiling of the cable compartment in the utility tunnel decreases. ZRYJV cables burn more sufficient combustion than RVVR cables. A new empirical association for total HRR is proposed. Those experimental test results are used as validation data for the newly proposed empirical correlation of total HRR. This paper hopes to provide some basic fire safety references for the utility tunnel planning of the urban underground cable compartment."
