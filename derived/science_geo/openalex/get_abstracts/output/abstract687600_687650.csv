https://openalex.org/W4210516486,"Coffee, cashew and avocado are of high socio-economic importance in many tropical smallholder farming systems around the globe. As plantation crops with a long lifespan, their cultivation requires long-term planning. The evaluation of climate change impacts on their biophysical suitability is therefore essential for developing adaptation measures and selecting appropriate varieties or crops. In this study, we modelled the current and future suitability of coffee arabica, cashew and avocado on a global scale based on climatic and soil requirements of the three crops. We used climate outputs of 14 global circulation models based on three emission scenarios to model the future (2050) climate change impacts on the crops both globally and in the main producing countries. For all three crops, climatic factors, mainly long dry seasons, mean temperatures (high and low), low minimum temperatures and annual precipitation (high and low), were more restrictive for the global extent of suitable growing regions than land and soil parameters, which were primarily low soil pH, unfavourable soil texture and steep slopes. We found shifts in suitable growing regions due to climate change with both regions of future expansion and contraction for all crops investigated. Coffee proved to be most vulnerable, with negative climate impacts dominating in all main producing regions. For both cashew and avocado, areas suitable for cultivation are expected to expand globally while in most main producing countries, the areas of highest suitability may decrease. The study reveals that climate change adaptation will be necessary in most major producing regions of all three crops. At high latitudes and high altitudes, however, they may all profit from increasing minimum temperatures. The study presents the first global assessment of climate change impacts on cashew and avocado suitability."
https://openalex.org/W4210806401,"We investigated sex differences in 473,260 adolescents’ aspirations to work in things-oriented (e.g., mechanic), people-oriented (e.g., nurse), and STEM (e.g., mathematician) careers across 80 countries and economic regions using the 2018 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). We analyzed student career aspirations in combination with student achievement in mathematics, reading, and science, as well as parental occupations and family wealth. In each country and region, more boys than girls aspired to a things-oriented or STEM occupation and more girls than boys to a people-oriented occupation. These sex differences were larger in countries with a higher level of women’s empowerment. We explain this counter-intuitive finding through the indirect effect of wealth. Women’s empowerment is associated with relatively high levels of national wealth and this wealth allows more students to aspire to occupations they are intrinsically interested in. Implications for better understanding the sources of sex differences in career aspirations and associated policy are discussed."

A proposed NN-based sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the most significant IR regions that distinguished benign from malignant samples. The result of the NN-based sensitivity analysis was compared to the obtained results from FTIR visual peak identification. In training each NN models, a 10-fold cross validation was performed and the performance metrics-area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), specificity rate (SR), negative predictive value (NPV), and recall rate (RR)-were averaged for comparison. The NN models were compared to six (6) machine learning models-logistic regression (LR), Naïve Bayes (NB), decision trees (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA)-for benchmarking. The NN models were able to outperform the LR, NB, DT, RF, and LDA for all metrics; while only surpassing the SVM in accuracy, NPV and SR. The best performance metric among the NN models was 90.48% ± 10.30% for AUC, 96.06% ± 7.07% for ACC, 92.18 ± 11.88% for PPV, 94.19 ± 10.57% for NPV, 89.04% ± 16.75% for SR, and 94.34% ± 10.54% for RR. Results from the proposed sensitivity analysis were consistent with the visual peak identification. However, unlike the FTIR visual peak identification method, the NN-based method identified the IR region associated with C-OH C-OH group carbohydrates as significant. IR regions associated with amino acids and amide proteins were also determined as possible sources of variability. In conclusion, results show that ATR-FTIR via NN is a potential diagnostic tool. This study also suggests a possible more specific method in determining relevant regions within a sample's spectrum using NN."
https://openalex.org/W4210653834,"The reformations of the electrical power sector have resulted in very dynamic and competitive market that has changed many elements of the power industry. Excessive demand of energy, depleting the fossil fuel reserves of planet and releasing the toxic air pollutant, has been causing harm to earth habitats. In this new situation, insufficiency of energy supplies, rising power generating costs, high capital cost of renewable energy equipment, environmental concerns of wind power turbines, and ever-increasing demand for electrical energy need efficient economic dispatch. The objective function in practical economic dispatch (ED) problem is nonlinear and non-convex, with restricted equality and inequality constraints, and traditional optimization methods are incapable of resolving such non-convex problems. Over the recent decade, meta-heuristic optimization approaches have acquired enormous reputation for obtaining a solution strategy for such types of ED issues. In this paper, a novel soft computing optimization technique is proposed for solving the dynamic economic dispatch problem (DEDP) of complex non-convex machines with several constraints. Our premeditated framework employs the genetic algorithm (GA) as an initial optimizer and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) for the fine tuning of the pre-optimized run of GA. The simulation analysis of GA-SQP performs well by acquiring less computational cost and finite time of execution, while providing optimal generation of powers according to the targeted power demand and load, whereas subject to valve point loading effect (VPLE) and multiple fueling option (MFO) constraints. The adequacy of the presented strategy concerning accuracy, convergence as well as reliability is verified by employing it on ten benchmark case studies, including non-convex IEEE bus system at the same time also considering VPLE of thermal power plants. The potency of designed optimization seems more robust with fast convergence rate while evaluating the hard bounded DEDP. Our suggested hybrid method GA-SQP converges to achieve the best optimal solution in a confined environment in a limited number of simulations. The simulation results demonstrate applicability and adequacy of the given hybrid schemes over conventional methods."

Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors of self-medication with antibiotics among the study participants.The median knowledge score was 7 out of a maximum of 10 (IQR: 5-8). A moderately positive attitude was observed among the participants (Median: 7/10; IQR: 6-8). Knowledge and attitude scores were significantly associated with academic year and monthly allowance (p < 0.05). 675 (60.8%) self-medicated with antibiotics within the previous 12 months, mostly from community pharmacies (321/675; 47.5%). Antibiotics were most commonly used to treat respiratory tract infections (38.1%) and cough (30.4%). Chi-square analysis demonstrated that self-medication with antibiotics was significantly associated with gender, year of study and monthly income.Undergraduate medical students had moderate knowledge and attitude towards antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance, and an alarmingly high prevalence of self-medication with antibiotics. This highlights the urgent need for tighter legislation regarding the sales of antibiotics in community pharmacies by the state and federal health ministries."
https://openalex.org/W4210796367,"Pregnancy and early infancy are considered to be the vulnerable phases for severe influenza infection causing morbidity and mortality. Despite WHO recommendations, influenza is not included in the immunization programs of many low- and middle-income countries. This systematic review is aimed at identifying barriers and facilitators for maternal influenza vaccination amongst the perinatal women and their health care providers in low- and middle-income countries.We selected 11 studies from the 1669 records identified from PubMed, CABI, EMBASE and Global Health databases. Studies related to both pandemic and routine influenza vaccination and studies conducted amongst women in the antenatal as well as postnatal period were included. Both qualitative, quantitative, cross-sectional and interventional studies were included.Knowledge about influenza disease, perception of the disease severity during pregnancy and risk to the foetus/newborn and perceived benefits of influenza vaccination during pregnancy were associated with increased uptake of influenza vaccination during pregnancy. Recommendation by health care provider, vaccination in previous pregnancy and availability of vaccine in public health system facilitated vaccine uptake. High parity, higher education, vaccination in the later months of pregnancy, less than 4 antenatal visits, concerns about vaccine safety and negative publicity in media were identified as barriers for influenza vaccination. Lack of government recommendation, concerns about safety and effectiveness and distrust in manufacturer were the barriers for the healthcare providers to recommend vaccination.While availability of influenza vaccine in public health system can be a key to the success of vaccine implementation program, increasing the awareness about need and benefits of maternal influenza vaccination amongst pregnant women as well as their health care providers is crucial to improve the acceptance of maternal influenza vaccination in low and middle-income countries."
https://openalex.org/W4210371514,"The objective of this study was to evaluate annual heart transplant volumes and 3-year post-transplant outcomes since establishment of United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database stratified by race.The UNOS thoracic transplant database was evaluated for adult patients since 1987. The available database was then stratified by Race: Black, White and Other and era of transplant: group 1(1987-1991), group 2(1992-1996), group 3(1997-2001), group 4(2002-2006), group 5(2007-2011), group 6(2012-2016) and group 7(2017 and later). Demographic and clinical factors were evaluated.A total of 105,266 adults have been listed since 1987 and 67,824 have been transplanted. Of the transplanted patients 11,235 were Black, 48,786 White and 6803 were of Other race. The proportion of Black patients listed increased from 7% in 1987 to 13.4% in 1999 and 25% in 2019 and those transplanted increased from 5% in 1987 to 13.4% in 2001 and 26% in 2019. The survival of Black patients gradually improved.Historically, fewer Black patients received cardiac transplantation however, their access gradually improved over the years and account for over 25% of cardiac transplantations performed in recent years. The historically poor survival of Black patients has recently improved and became comparable to the rest."
https://openalex.org/W4225696655,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was discovered in China and characterized by the World Health Organization as a pandemic in March 2020. Many countries worldwide implemented stringent social isolation as a strategy to contain virus transmission. However, the same physical distancing that protects against the spread of COVID-19 may negatively impact mental health and well-being of the population. The present study sought to shed light on this phenomenon by assessing the relationship between physical activity and subjective well-being (SWB) among individuals who were subjected to social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected in Brazil between March 31 and April 2, 2020. All of the volunteers agreed to participate by digitally checking the option of agreement after reading consent terms. The inclusion criteria were participants who had been in social isolation for at least 1 week and agreed to the consent terms. Three instruments were applied. A questionnaire was constructed for this study that assessed the participants' exercise routines. The Psychosocial Aspects, Well-being, and Exercise in Confinement (PAWEC) scale was created by researchers of this study that assessed the relationship between well-being and physical activity during social isolation. The Brazilian Portuguese-adapted version of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) was also used. A total of 592 participants (371 female, 220 male, 1 transgender), 14-74 years old (M = 32.39 years, SD = 10.5 years), reported being in social isolation for an average of 14.4 days (SD = 3.3 days). Well-being that was related to the practice of physical activity during quarantine was linked to an established routine of physical activity before the social isolation period. Participants who already practiced physical exercises previously and reported continuing the practice during the quarantine period had higher positive affect scores. Participants who engaged in physical activity without direct guidance only during the quarantine period had higher negative affect scores. Participants who already practiced physical activity felt more motivated to continue practicing physical activity during the social isolation period, resulting in positive affect, unlike participants who began exercising only during quarantine. Our results suggest that negative affect can occur among individuals who only just begin exercising during social isolation, indicating that physical activity should be habitual and not only occur during periods of social isolation. Engaging in exercise only during social isolation may contribute to an increase in malaise."
https://openalex.org/W4210463370,"Biodiversity is a key factor for the functioning and efficiency of an ecosystem. Greece, though covering a relatively small surface area, hosts a great deal of species diversity. This is especially true for freshwater fishes. In recent years, the traditional methods of species identification have been supplemented by the use of molecular markers. The present study therefore aims to extensively produce DNA barcodes for Greek freshwater fish species and investigate thoroughly if the presently accepted species classification is in agreement with molecular data. A 624-bases long fragment of the COI gene was sequenced, from 406 freshwater fish specimens belonging to 24 genera and originating from 18 lake and river sites. These sequences were used along with 596 sequences from the same genera, recovered from BOLD, for the construction of phylogenetic trees and the estimation of genetic distances between individuals. In total, 1002 sequences belonging to 72 species were analyzed. The method was found to be effective for 55 of 72 studied species. 17 closely related species with low interspecific genetic distances were observed, for which further study is proposed. It should also be noted that, in four cases, cryptic diversity was observed, where groups originally identified as one species exhibited genetic distance great enough to be separated into discrete species. Region specific haplotypes were also detected within populations of 14 species, giving the possibility to identify even the geographic origin of a species. Our findings are discussed in the light of the rich history of the Balkan peninsula and provide a significant steppingstone for the further study of Greek and European freshwater fish biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W4210578023,"Coffee beans contain high polyphenol content, which have the potential to modulate the intestinal microbiota, and possibly attenuate weight gain and the associated dyslipidemia. This study investigated the effect of freeze-dried coffee solution (FCS) consumption on physiological parameters, lipid profile, and microbiota of Wistar rats fed a high-fat diet (HF) or control diet (CT). FCS combined with a high-fat diet increased the fecal and cecal Bifidobacterium spp. population and decreased the cecal Escherichia coli population and intestinal Il1b mRNA level. Regardless of the diet type, FCS increased the serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C); however, it did not affect body weight, food intake, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, fecal bile acids, and intestinal Il6 mRNA levels. The high-fat diet increased weight gain, hepatic cholesterol and triglycerides, fecal bile acids, and the fecal and cecal Lactobacillus spp. population, and reduced food intake, the fecal E. coli population, and intestinal Il6 mRNA level. The results suggest that FCS consumption exhibits positive health effects in rats fed a high-fat diet by increasing Bifidobacterium spp. population and HDL-C reverse cholesterol transport, and by reducing Il1b mRNA level. However, FCS administration at a dose of 0.39 g/100 g diet over an eight-week period was not effective in controlling food intake, and consequently, preventing weight gain in rats of high-fat diet-induced obesity model."
https://openalex.org/W4210590274,"Falls are a major issue for bipeds. For elderly adults, falls can have a negative impact on their quality of life and lead to increased medical costs. Fortunately, interventional methods are effective at reducing falls assuming they are prescribed. For biped robots, falls prevent them from completing required tasks. Thus, it is important to understand what aspects of gait increase fall risk. Gait variability may be associated with increased fall risk; however, previous studies have not investigated the variation in the movement of the legs. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of joint angle variability on falling to determine which component(s) of variability were statistically significant. In order to investigate joint angle variability, a physics-based simulation model that captured joint angle variability as a function of time through Fourier series was used. This allowed the magnitude, the frequency mean, and the frequency standard deviation of the variability to be altered. For the values tested, results indicated that the magnitude of the variability had the most significant impact on falling, and specifically that the stance knee flexion variability magnitude was the most significant factor. This suggests that increasing the joint variability magnitude may increase fall risk, particularly if the controller is not able to actively compensate. Altering the variability frequency had little to no effect on falling."
https://openalex.org/W4210599650,"The last two decades have witnessed a tremendous growth in probiotics and in the numbers of publications on their potential health benefits. Owing to their distinguishing beneficial effects and long history of safe use, species belonging to the Lactobacillus genus are among the most widely used probiotic species in human food and dietary supplements and are finding increased use in animal feed. Here, we isolated, identified, and evaluated the safety of two novel Limosilactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) isolates, ATCC PTA-126787 & ATCC PTA-126788. More specifically, we sequenced the genomes of these two L. reuteri strains using the PacBio sequencing platform. Using a combination of biochemical and genetic methods, we identified the two strains as belonging to L. reuteri species. Detailed in silico analyses showed that the two strains do not encode for any known genetic sequences of concern for human or animal health. In vitro assays confirmed that the strains are susceptible to clinically relevant antibiotics and do not produce potentially harmful by-products such as biogenic amines. In vitro bile and acid tolerance studies demonstrated that the two strains have similar survival profiles as the commercial L. reuteri probiotic strain DSM 17938. Most importantly, daily administration of the two probiotic strains to broiler chickens in drinking water for 26 days did not induce any adverse effect, clinical disease, or histopathological lesions, supporting the safety of the strains in an in vivo avian model. All together, these data provide in silico, in vitro and in vivo evidence of the safety of the two novel candidates for potential probiotic applications in humans as well as animals."

We aimed to provide a comprehensive picture regarding foundational neurodevelopment and examine systematic differences by family income. Using a nationally representative longitudinal sample of 486 infants, children, and adolescents (age 5 months to 20 years) from the NIH MRI Study of Normal Brain Development and leveraging advances in statistical modeling, we mapped developmental trajectories for the four major cortical lobes and constructed charts that show the statistical distribution of gray matter and reveal the considerable variability in regional volumes and structural change, even among healthy, typically developing children. Further, the data reveal that significant structural differences in gray matter development for children living in or near poverty, first detected during childhood (age 2.5-6.5 years), evolve throughout adolescence."
https://openalex.org/W4210650169,"Eradication of poliovirus (PV) is a global public health priority, and as clinical cases decrease, the role of environmental surveillance becomes more important. Persistence of PV and the environmental factors that influence it (such as temperature and sample type) are an important part of understanding and interpreting positive environmental surveillance samples. The objective of this study was to evaluate the persistence of poliovirus type 2 (PV2) and type 3 (PV3) in wastewater and sediment. Microcosms containing either 1) influent wastewater or 2) influent wastewater with a sediment matrix were seeded with either PV2 or PV3, and stored for up to 126 days at three temperatures (4°C, room temperature [RT], and 30°C). Active PV in the liquid of (1), and the sediment and liquid portions of (2) were sampled and quantified at up to 10 time points via plaque assay and RT-qPCR. A suite of 17 models were tested for best fit to characterize decay of PV2 and PV3 over time and determine the time points at which >90% (T90) and >99% (T99) reduction was reached. Linear models assessed the influence of experimental factors (matrix, temperature, virus type and method of detection) on the predicted T90 and T99 values. Results showed that when T90 was the dependent variable, virus type, matrix, and temperature significantly affected decay, and there was a clear interaction between the sediment matrix and temperature. When T99 was the dependent variable, only temperature and matrix type significantly influenced the decay metric. This study characterizes the persistence of both active and molecular PV2 and PV3 in relevant environmental conditions, and demonstrates that temperature and sediment both play important roles in PV viability. As eradication nears and clinical cases decrease, environmental surveillance and knowledge of PV persistence will play a key role in understanding the silent circulation in endemic countries."
https://openalex.org/W4210246695,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most burdened tumors worldwide, with a complex and multifactorial pathogenesis. Current treatment approaches involve different molecular targets. Phytochemicals have shown considerable promise in the prevention and treatment of HCC. We investigated the efficacy of two natural components, 1,8 cineole (Cin) and ellagic acid (EA), against diethylnitrosamine/2-acetylaminofluorene (DEN/2-AAF) induced HCC in rats. DEN/2-AAF showed deterioration of hepatic cells with an impaired functional capacity of the liver. In addition, the levels of tumor markers including alpha-fetoprotein, arginase-1, alpha-L-fucosidase, and ferritin were significantly increased, whereas the hepatic miR-122 level was significantly decreased in induced-HCC rats. Interestingly, treatment with Cin (100mg/kg) and EA (60mg/kg) powerfully restored these biochemical alterations. Moreover, Cin and EA treatment exhibited significant downregulation in transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1), Fascin-1 (FSCN1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) key marker, vimentin, along with a restoration of histopathological findings compared to HCC group. Such effects were comparable to Doxorubicin (DOX) (2mg/kg); however, a little additive effect was evident through combining these phytochemicals with DOX. Altogether, this study highlighted 1,8 cineole and ellagic acid for the first time as promising phytochemicals for the treatment of hepatocarcinogenesis via regulating multiple targets."
https://openalex.org/W4210327045,"Purpose To report the potential reduction of carbon emissions by utilising air-tamponade (AT), where possible, instead of fluorinated gases in the management of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). We compared the carbon CO 2 emissions produced at two large tertiary referral vitreoretinal (VR) centres where RRD are exclusively repaired using fluorinated gases to a tertiary VR mass of each gas used according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Materials and methods Retrospective, continuous, comparative multicentre study of all procedures using fluorinated gases between 01/01/17-31/12/20 at the Manchester Royal Eye Hospital (MREH) and Birmingham and Midland Eye Centre (BMEC), and between 01/01/19-31/12/2020 at the University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire (UHCW). Results We report on 3,239 (SF 6 :1,415 [43.7%], C 2 F 6 :1,235 [38.1%], C 3 F 8 :541 [16.7%], Air:48 [1.5%]) procedures. UHCW and BMEC utilise single use 30ml and 75ml cannisters, respectively and MREH use multi-use gas cylinders. UHCW used AT in 48 (70%) of RRD repairs. Mean equivalent mass CO 2 /patient was MREH:115.9kg, BMEC:7.9kg and UHCW:1.9kg. If assuming all centres used 30ml cannisters, the mean equivalent mass CO 2 /patient was MREH:3.5 kg, BMEC:3.1kg and UHCW:1.9kg. AT enabled UHCW to greatly reduce the need for the most environmentally damaging SF 6 gas, leading to lower CO 2 emissions by 47.0% and 41.1% compared to MREH and BMEC, respectively. Conclusion We demonstrate how AT vs. the fluorinated gases can reduce in carbon footprint in the management of RRD. Further studies are required to determine the most ‘environment-friendly’ intraocular tamponade without compromising patient outcomes centre that also routinely employs AT in selected RRD cases."
https://openalex.org/W4210522117,"The objective of this study is to optimize the cryopreservation of dissociated islet cells and obtain functional cells that can be used in single-cell transcriptome studies on the pathology and treatment of diabetes. Using an iterative graded freezing approach we obtained viable cells after cooling in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide and 6% hydroxyethyl starch at 1°C/min to -40°C, storage in liquid nitrogen, rapid thaw, and removal of cryoprotectants by serial dilution. The expression of epithelial cell adhesion molecule declined immediately after thaw, but recovered after overnight incubation, while that of an endocrine cell marker (HPi2) remained high after cryopreservation. Patch-clamp electrophysiology revealed differences in channel activities and exocytosis of various islet cell types; however, exocytotic responses, and the biophysical properties of voltage-gated Na+ and Ca2+ channels, are sustained after cryopreservation. Single-cell RNA sequencing indicates that overall transcriptome and crucial exocytosis genes are comparable between fresh and cryopreserved dispersed human islet cells. Thus, we report an optimized procedure for cryopreserving dispersed islet cells that maintained their membrane integrity, along with their molecular and functional phenotypes. Our findings will not only provide a ready source of cells for investigating cellular mechanisms in diabetes but also for bio-engineering pseudo-islets and islet sheets for modeling studies and potential transplant applications."

https://openalex.org/W4210681991,"The submerged site of Ohalo II was occupied during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), between 23,500-22,500 cal BP, bridging the Upper Paleolithic/Epipaleolithic transition in the southern Levant. The site is known for the excellent preservation of its brush huts and botanical remains. This study examines the behavior of its past inhabitants through analysis of the entire faunal assemblage found on the three successive floors of Brush Hut 1. Furthermore, it provides an opportunity to test differing models of prey choice and assess whether the observed resource diversification is the result of resource depression (explained by Optimal Foraging Theory) or resource abundance (explained by Niche Construction Theory). We focused on a quantitative, qualitative and spatial investigation of the more than 20,000 faunal remains, combining traditional zooarchaeological methods with microwear analysis of teeth and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) of burnt bones. Identification of faunal remains to the most detailed level possible, combined with analysis of skeletal element frequencies allowed reconstruction of a profile of the desired prey, highlighting the importance of small, expedient prey compared to larger game (ungulates). FTIR was used to identify degrees of burning and to develop a key to identifying burnt bones from water-logged environments. Availability of multiple food sources within a rich habitat may have driven exploitation of those varied local resources, rather than targeting energetically-rich large prey. The choice of a littoral habitat that could be intensively exploited is an example of niche selection. Comparison with contemporaneous and later sites contributes to the ongoing discussion about Early Epipaleolithic prey choice, and the impact, if any, of the LGM in the Jordan Valley. Ohalo II is an example of diverse prey choice motivated by abundance rather than stress, at a 23,000-year-old fisher-hunter-gatherers camp."
https://openalex.org/W4210728037,"To improve the teaching effect of western music history, the curriculum reform of history education needs to be promoted under the background of the Internet of Things (IoT). At first, a discussion is made on the characteristics of history course, which is combined with the characteristics of teaching data easy to collect under the background of IoT. An analysis is conducted on the related theory of educational data mining. Then, the concept of personalized recommendation is proposed based on deep learning (DL) algorithm. Finally, online and offline experiments are designed to verify the performance of the algorithm from review and investigation, smoothness, and participation of difficulty. The research results show that in terms of offline recommendation accuracy, the average record length in Math data set is 24.5, which is much smaller than that in range data set. The research has obvious innovation significance compared with other studies. In the process of target review and investigation, it is found that the research method here involves a wider range of knowledge and higher reliability. In terms of the difficulty of recommending questions, the Deep Reinforcement Exercise (DRE) recommendation algorithm can adaptively adjust the difficulty of recommending questions. It also allows students to set different learning goals through participation goals. But in the experiments on Math data set, Step 10's recommendation results are not very good, and the difficulty level varies greatly. If the goal setting is high, the problem recommended to students is too difficult, students may answer these questions wrongly, forcing the algorithm to adjust the difficulty adaptively. According to the above results, DRE recommendation algorithm can adapt to different learning needs and customize the recommendation results, thus opening up a new path for the teaching of western music history. Besides, the combination of DL algorithm and western music history teaching design can recommend learning materials, which is of great significance in the teaching of history courses."
https://openalex.org/W4210756109,"The trade and private ownership of non-domesticated animals has detrimental effects on individual animals and their wild populations. Therefore, there is a need to understand the conditions that motivate and dissuade interest in non-domesticated pet ownership. Past research has demonstrated that the way in which non-domesticated animals are portrayed in images influences the public's perception that they are suitable as pets. We conducted an online survey of people residing in the United States to investigate how viewing images that could be realistically captured in the zoo and broader tourism industries impact the degree to which people report interest in having that animal as a pet. We focused on two species, reticulated pythons (Malayopython reticulatus) and two-toed sloths (Choloepus hoffmanni), and presented each species in six different visual contexts. After viewing an image, respondents reported interest in pet ownership on a four-point Likert scale. Each species was studied separately in a between-subjects design and results were analyzed using ordinal logistic regression models. Thirty-nine percent of respondents reported interest in sloth pet ownership, and 21% reported interest in python pet ownership. However, contrary to our hypotheses, we found that viewing these species in different visual contexts did not significantly affect survey respondents' reported interest in having either species as a pet. Generation was a significant predictor of interest in both sloth and python pet ownership, with younger generations reporting more interest in having these species as pets. Male respondents reported more interest in python pet ownership, whereas there were no significant differences between genders regarding interest in sloth ownership. We consider how modern media exposure to animals in unnatural contexts may relate to the generational effect and discuss priorities for future research to better understand the development of individual interests in non-domesticated pet ownership."
https://openalex.org/W4210765406,"Purpose To validate retinal capillary density and caliber associations with diabetic retinopathy (DR) severity in different clinical settings. Methods This cross-sectional study assessed retinal capillary density and caliber in the superficial retinal layer of 3-mm OCTA scans centered on the fovea. Images were collected from non-diabetic controls and subjects with mild or referable DR (defined DR worse than mild DR) between February 2016 and December 2019 at secondary and tertiary eye care centers. Vessel Skeleton Density (VSD), a measure of capillary density, and Vessel Diameter Index (VDI), a measure of vascular caliber, were calculated from these images. Discriminatory performance of VSD and VDI was evaluated using multivariable logistic regression models predicting DR severity with adjustments for sex, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Area under the curve (AUC) was estimated. Model performance was evaluated in two different cohorts. Results This study included 594 eyes from 385 subjects. Cohort 1 was a training cohort of 509 eyes including 159 control, 155 mild non-proliferative DR (NPDR) and 195 referable DR eyes. Cohort 2 was a validation cohort consisting of 85 eyes including 16 mild NPDR and 69 referable DR eyes. In Cohort 1, addition of VSD and VDI to a model using only demographic data significantly improved the model’s AUC for discrimination of eyes with any DR severity from controls (0.91 [95% CI, 0.88–0.93] versus 0.80 [95% CI, 0.76–0.83], p &lt; 0.001) and eyes with referable DR from mild NPDR (0.90 [95% CI, 0.86–0.93] versus 0.69 [95% CI, 0.64–0.75], p &lt; 0.001). The transportability of this regression model was excellent when implemented in Cohort 2 for the referable DR versus mild NPDR comparison. The odds ratio of having any DR compared to control subjects, and referable DR compared to mild DR decreased by 15% (95% CI: 12–18%), and 13% (95% CI: 10–15%), respectively, for every 0.001 unit increase in VSD after adjusting for comorbidities. Conclusion OCTA-derived capillary density has real world clinical value for rapidly assessing DR severity."

Data from the included communities were extracted and analysed to determine the content and level of interaction.There was a significant rise in the use of social media by caregivers of people affected by stroke. The most popular social media communities were charitable and governmental organizations with the highest user interaction-this was for topics related to stroke prevention, signs and symptoms, and caregiver self-care delivered through video-based resources.Findings show the ability of social media to support stroke caregiver needs and practices that should be considered to increase their interaction and support."
https://openalex.org/W4210248083,"Background Prolapsed nictitating membrane gland (PNMG) is the most common disorder of the third eyelid in dogs. However, the epidemiology of PNMG in the wider dog population remains understudied. Methods Using de-identified clinical data from the VetCompass Programme, this cohort study aimed to report the prevalence, demographic and breed-related risk factors of PNMG in dogs attending UK primary care veterinary practices in 2016. Results There were 1,802 PNMG cases identified from 905,543 dogs, yielding an annual prevalence of 0.20% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19–0.21). The median age at first diagnosis was 0.63 years (IQR 0.33–1.98, range 0.11–18.00). Dogs aged under 1 year had 10.82 times the odds (95% CI 9.17–12.76) compared with dogs aged from 2 to under 4 years. Neutered animals had higher odds than entire animals within both sexes. Breeds with the highest odds of PNMG compared with crossbred dogs included Neapolitan Mastiff (odds ratio (OR) 34.26, 95%CI 15.92–73.75), English Bulldog (OR 24.08, 95% CI 20.62–28.13), Cane Corso (OR 14.66, 95% CI 8.18–26.28), Lhasa Apso (OR 12.37, 95% CI 10.26–14.92) and American Cocker Spaniel (OR 11.57, 95% CI 5.59–23.96). Purebred dogs had 1.43 times the odds (95% CI 1.26–1.63) of PNMG compared with crossbreed dogs. Breeds with brachycephalic skull conformation had 6.71 times the odds (95%CI 5.89–7.64) compared with breeds with mesocephalic skull conformation. Insured dogs had 1.89 times the odds (95% CI 1.65–2.16) compared with uninsured dogs. Conclusions This study reports the largest cohort of primary-care PNMG cases assembled to date. The results showing young age at diagnosis along with the breed, purebred and brachycephalic skull conformation predispositions suggest a hereditary involvement in PNMG development. These results may help to guide breeding strategies to reduce the prevalence of PNMG and improve welfare in predisposed individuals."
https://openalex.org/W4210353087,"To evaluate the association between transvaginal ultrasound scan of cervix and Bishop's score in predicting successful induction of labour, cut-off points and patients' tolerability and acceptance for both procedures.A comparative clinical trial.A tertiary hospital in Selangor, Malaysia.294 women planned for elective induction of labour for various indications were included. All women had transvaginal ultrasound to assess the cervical length and digital vaginal examination to assess the Bishop cervical scoring by separate investigators before induction of labour.To evaluate the association of the cervical length by transvaginal ultrasound scan and Bishop score in predicting successful induction of labour.Variables associated with successful induction of labour and patients' tolerability and acceptance for transvaginal ultrasound scan of cervix.There was no statistically significant difference among the vaginal and Caesarean delivery groups in terms of mean maternal age, height, weight, body mass index, ethnicity and gestational age at induction. Vaginal delivery occurred in 207 women (70.4%) and 87 women (29.6%) delivered via Caesarean section. There was a high degree of correlation between the cervical length and Bishop score (r-value 0.745; p <0.001). Sonographic assessment of cervical length demonstrated a comparable accuracy in comparison to Bishop score. Analysis using ROC curves noted an optimal cut-off value of ≤27mm for cervical length and Bishop score of ≥ 4, with a sensitivity of 69.1% vs 67%, specificity 60.9% vs 55%, and area under the curves (AUCs) of 0.672 and 0.643 respectively (p <0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that parity (OR 2.70), cervical length (OR 0.925), Bishop score (OR 1.272) and presence of funnelling (OR 3.292) were highly significant as independent predictors of success labour induction. Women also expressed significantly less discomfort with transvaginal ultrasound compared with digital vaginal examination.Sonographic assessment of cervical measurement predicts the success of induction of labour with similar diagnostic accuracy with conventional Bishop score."
https://openalex.org/W4210363043,"The study objectives were: 1) to develop a masticatory index for evaluating masticatory ability in patients wearing a dental prosthesis, including complete dentures (CD), removable partial denture (RPD), and fixed partial denture (FPD), 2) to test the reliability and validity of the index, and 3) to determine whether the index better reflected patients' masticatory ability compared with conventional subjective and objective measures.The present cross-sectional study consisted of 2 phases: 1) developing the Chulalongkorn University masticatory index (CUMI) consisting of 20 food items in 5 masticatory difficulty grades using a 3-point Likert scale, and 2) application of the CUMI in 110 patients wearing a dental prosthesis, including CD, RPD, and FPD (control group). The CUMI test-retest reliability was reevaluated 2 weeks later. The convergent validity was compared with objective masticatory performance evaluated with a standard peanut chewing test, and subjective eating impacts evaluated by the Oral Impacts on Daily Performances Index. Oral and denture status were determined clinically. The associations between CUMI score, peanut particle size, and eating impact score was identified using Spearman's correlation coefficient. To evaluate discriminant validity, the associations between masticatory ability measurements and oral and denture status were analyzed using regression analyses.The CUMI's Cronbach's alpha and intraclass correlation coefficient values were 0.89 and 0.95, respectively. The convergent validity was shown by significant associations between the increased CUMI score, smaller peanut particle size and decreased eating impact score. Multivariable analyses found that the CUMI score, peanut particle size, and percentage of having an eating impact were significantly associated with the number of remaining teeth and posterior occluding pairs, and type and quality of dental prosthesis. However, the CUMI demonstrated better discriminant validity because significant dose-response relationships were found only between the decreased CUMI score and increased tooth loss severity, and unacceptable denture quality. Adjusted R2 values of the CUMI models were the highest, followed by those of peanut particle size and eating impact.CUMI is a reliable and valid tool to evaluate masticatory ability of patients wearing a dental prosthesis, including CD, RPD, and FPD. Due to a better discriminant validity, the CUMI better reflects masticatory ability of patients compared with conventional subjective and objective masticatory ability measures."
https://openalex.org/W4210424294,"Background Women’s empowerment, education, and economic status are jointly introduced as women’s 3E. A number of studies found the significant association of these three variables with maternal health outcomes, but no studies, to the best of knowledge, have been found to justify the joint influence of women’s 3E on the birth interval. As several studies have revealed that the short birth interval increases the risk of adverse maternal, perinatal, and infant outcomes and it is also responsible for increasing the country’s population size, more research is needed on the birth interval. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the influence of women’s 3E on the short birth interval after controlling the other selected covariates. Methods Data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS), 2017–18 have been used to serve the purpose of the study. To measure the birth interval, at least two live births for non-pregnant mothers and at least one live birth for currently pregnant mothers born in the 5 years before the survey were included in the study. The Chi-Square test was applied to know the unadjusted association of the selected covariates including women’s 3E with the short birth interval. In order to find out the adjusted association of women’s 3E with the short birth interval, sequential binary logistic regression models have been used. Results The study found that about 23% of births in Bangladesh were born in a short birth interval. The likelihood of subsequent births of women decreases with an increase in the score of women’s 3E before or after controlling the characteristics of women, child, and households. The results of the final model show that mothers with the coverage of 50% - 75%, 75% - 100%, and full coverage (100%) in 3E have a 23%, 41%, and 42% lower odds of having short birth interval compared to mothers with coverage of below 50% in 3E, respectively. Conclusion and recommendation Bangladesh still lags behind in meeting the minimum requirements for inter-birth intervals set by the World Health Organization. The study has shown that the 3E in women can contribute in prolonging the duration of subsequent births in Bangladesh. Policy-making interventions are needed to raise awareness among uneducated, under-empowered and economically poor reproductive women through family planning and fertility control programs so that the country can achieve the desired fertility rate."
https://openalex.org/W4210437593,"Vaporized cannabis is believed to be safer than smoking, but when heated to excessive temperatures nearing combustion (>900 °C) harmful byproducts may form. While some cannabis extract vaporizers operate well below these high temperatures, heating coil temperatures obtained during actual use are frequently not reported and many operate at high temperatures. We report on two major objectives: 1) development of an infrared thermography method to measure heating coil temperatures in cannabis extract vaporizers during a simulated puff and 2) a comparison of temperature- to voltage- controlled cannabis extract vaporization systems during a puff. Infrared thermography was used to measure heating coil temperatures in one temperature-controlled and two voltage-controlled systems. The cartridges were modified for direct line-of-sight on the heating coils, the wick and coils were saturated with cannabis extract, and fixtures were developed to force two liters per minute air flow past the coils for the full duration of the puff allowed by the device. The voltage-controlled systems produced higher temperatures with greater variability than the temperature-controlled system. At the highest temperature setting (420 °C) the temperature-controlled system reached an average heating coil temperature of 420 ± 9.5 °C whereas the 4.0V setting on the variable voltage system reached an average temperature of 543 ± 95.9 °C and the single voltage (3.2V) system an average of 450 ± 60.8 °C. The average temperature at the lowest setting (270 °C) on the temperature-controlled system was 246 ± 5.1 °C and the variable voltage system (2.4V) was 443 ± 56.1 °C. Voltage alone was a poor indicator of coil temperature and only the temperature-controlled system consistently maintained temperatures less than 400 °C for the full puff duration. These lower temperatures could reduce the likelihood of harmful thermal degradation products and thus may reduce potential health risk to consumers when vaporizing cannabis extracts."
https://openalex.org/W4210461715,"This study aims to explore how physicians make sense of and give meaning to their decision-making during obstetric emergencies. Childbirth is considered safe in the wealthiest parts of the world. However, variations in both intervention rates and delivery outcomes have been found between countries and between maternity units of the same country. Interventions can prevent neonatal and maternal morbidity but may cause avoidable harm if performed without medical indication. To gain insight into the possible causes of this variation, we turned to first-person perspectives, and particularly physicians' as they hold a central role in the obstetric team. This study was conducted at four maternity units in the southern region of Sweden. Using a narrative approach, individual in-depth interviews ignited by retelling an event and supported by art images, were performed between Oct. 2018 and Feb. 2020. In total 17 obstetricians and gynecologists participated. An inductive thematic narrative analysis was used for interpreting the data. Eight themes were constructed: (a) feeling lonely, (b) awareness of time, (c) sense of responsibility, (d) keeping calm, (e) work experience, (f) attending midwife, (g) mind-set and setting, and (h) hedging. Three decision-making perspectives were constructed: (I) individual-centered strategy, (II) dialogue-distributed process, and (III) chaotic flow-orientation. This study shows how various psychological and organizational conditions synergize with physicians during decision-making. It also indicates how physicians gave decision-making meaning through individual motivations and rationales, expressed as a perspective. Finally, the study also suggests that decision-making evolves with experience, and over time. The findings have significance for teamwork, team training, patient safety and for education of trainees."
https://openalex.org/W4212978038,"Problem-based learning (PBL) allows students to learn medical statistics through problem solving experience. The aim of this study was to assess the efficiency of PBL modules implemented in the blended learning courses in medical statistics through knowledge outcomes and student satisfaction. The pilot study was designed as a randomized controlled trial that included 53 medical students who had completed all course activities. The students were randomized in two groups: the group with access to PBL modules within the blended learning course (hPBL group) and the group without access to PBL modules-only blended learning course (BL group). There were no significant differences between the groups concerning socio-demographic characteristics, previous academic success and modality of access to course materials. Students from hPBL group had a significantly higher problem solving score (p = 0.012; effect size 0.69) and the total medical statistics score (p = 0,046; effect size 0.57). Multivariate regression analysis with problem solving as an outcome variable showed that problem solving was associated with being in hPBL group (p = 0.010) and having higher grade point average (p = 0.037). Multivariate regression analysis with the medical statistics score as an outcome variable showed the association between a higher score on medical statistics with access to PBL modules (p = 0.045) and a higher grade point average (p = 0.021). All students in hPBL group (100.0%) considered PBL modules useful for learning medical statistics. PBL modules can be easily implemented in the existing courses within medical statistics using the Moodle platform, they have high applicability and can complement, but not replace other forms of teaching. These modules were shown to be efficient in learning, to be well accepted among students and to be a potential missing link between teaching and learning medical statistics. The authors of this study are planning to create PBL modules for advanced courses in medical statistics and to conduct this study on other universities with a more representative study sample, with the aim to overcome the limitations of the existing study and confirm its results."
https://openalex.org/W4210274173,"The aim of the study was the full evaluation of the psychometric properties of the COPSOQ II in one-year longitudinal study on human service staff in Poland. Data were collected from 599 employees representing three occupational groups related to human service work.CFA was conducted in the structure proposed by the author of the original tool, based on one model, which included 119 observable variables forming 33 latent variables (single item subscales were excluded from analysis). To our knowledge, this was the first complete validation of the entire model using CFA. Reliability analysis was performed using two methods: internal consistency analysis and test-retest analysis. Predictive validity was assessed by correlating COPSOQ II variables with ten criterion variables related to job demands, job resources, work-family conflicts, mental health and well-being.According to the results, CFA supported the original structure of the COPSOQ II. Most of the 33 subscales were characterized by good or very good psychometric parameters. The obtained results confirmed also the fairly high reliability, as well as high convergence validity of all subscales of COPSOQ II.The final conclusion is that COPSOQ II is characterised by satisfactory psychometric properties and could be successfully used to fulfil the demand for reliable and comprehensive assessment methods also in Polish job market settings."
https://openalex.org/W4210304409,"COVID-19 has exposed stark inequalities between resource-rich and resource-poor countries. International UN- and WHO-led efforts, such as COVAX, have provided SARS-CoV-2 vaccines but half of African countries have less than 2% vaccinated in their population, and only 15 have reached 10% by October 2021, further disadvantaging local economic recovery. Key for this implementation and preventing further mutation and spread is the frequency of voluntary [asymptomatic] testing. It is limited by expensive PCR and LAMP tests, uncomfortable probes deep in the throat or nose, and the availability of hardware to administer in remote locations. There is an urgent need for an inexpensive ""end-to-end"" system to deliver sensitive and reliable, non-invasive tests in resource-poor and field-test conditions. We introduce a non-invasive saliva-based LAMP colorimetric test kit and a $51 lab-in-a-backpack system that detects as few as 4 viral RNA copies per μL. It consists of eight chemicals, a thermometer, a thermos bottle, two micropipettes and a 1000-4000 rcf electronically operated centrifuge made from recycled computer hard drives (CentriDrive). The centrifuge includes a 3D-printed rotor and a 12 V rechargeable Li-ion battery, and its 12 V standard also allows wiring directly to automobile batteries, to enable field-use of this and other tests in low infrastructure settings. The test takes 90 minutes to process 6 samples and has reagent costs of $3.5 per sample. The non-invasive nature of saliva testing would allow higher penetration of testing and wider adoption of the test across cultures and settings (including refugee camps and disaster zones). The attached graphical procedure would make the test suitable for self-testing at home, performing it in the field, or in mobile testing centers by minimally trained staff."
https://openalex.org/W4210348491,"Citizen science is increasingly contributing to ecology and conservation research, mostly by the extensive collection of field data. Although webcams attract numerous observers, they have been underused in this respect. We used prey delivery records deposited by citizen scientists in an internet forum linked to webcams to explore the diet composition and food provisioning in a forest-dwelling raptor of conservation concern, the Lesser Spotted Eagle (Clanga pomarina). Four pairs were studied throughout the breeding season. Most of the identified prey items were mammals (62.1%), followed by frogs (31.2%), birds (6.6%) and fish (0.1%). Among mammals, voles accounted for 84.6%, moles 12.1%, water voles 2.4% and weasels 0.4%. Frogs were the most frequently detected prey item in the spring, with a slight increase towards the end of the season, the proportion of mammals increased during the breeding season, and birds were hunted mostly in the middle of the breeding season. However, exact temporal patterns differed between nests. The food delivery rate of males increased over time but decreased somewhat before fledging the young. Females started hunting in mid-summer and their rapidly increasing effort compensated for a reduced male hunting intensity. The data collected by citizen scientists via webcams reflected the general patterns detected in earlier studies, supporting the reliability of crowd-sourced web-based data collection in avian foraging ecology."
https://openalex.org/W4210406649,"Young Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) continue to face disproportionate HIV risk. Despite its well accepted role in HIV prevention, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake remains below desired goals. Systemic barriers to PrEP access, including insurance complexity, cost, and wait times to start PrEP may contribute to low PrEP engagement. We conducted in-depth interviews and designed a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to assess preferences for and barriers to PrEP access in the United States.We conducted in-depth interviews with 18 MSM aged 18-30 years old who were not on PrEP and created a DCE based on the results. For the DCE, a convenience sample of young MSM in the United States who reported recent condomless anal sex was recruited through social media applications. Consenting participants provided sociodemographic information and responded to a series of 10 choice tasks about PrEP access. Preferences were analyzed utilizing marginal willingness-to-pay (mWTP) methods.In-depth interviews revealed preferences for highly effective PrEP and concerns about barriers to access due to insurance coverage and privacy. The online DCE was completed by 236 eligible MSM aged 18-30. The most-preferred PrEP package-with all elements significantly preferred over other options-was insurance covered, could be maintained confidential from parents and employers, was available immediately, and had an online option. Need to take out new insurance or add a supplemental insurance in order to cover PrEP significantly detracted from willingness to pay for a PrEP program. Attributes most associated with willingness to pay for PrEP were PrEP being covered by an insurance the client already has and insurance coverage that was private.Young MSM at high risk for HIV in the United States who are not currently on PrEP showed strong preferences for PrEP options that were covered by insurance and could be kept confidential from parents and employers. Lack of these options may present major barriers to PrEP access among young MSM who are at particularly high risk. Rapid access to PrEP, as well as the option of receiving some care online, may also enhance PrEP uptake."
https://openalex.org/W4210515371,"Many methodologies are used to predict the genetic merit in animals and plants, but some of them require priori assumptions that may increase the complexity of the model. Artificial neural network (ANN) has advantage to not require priori assumptions about the relationships between inputs and the output allowing great flexibility to handle different types of complex non-additive effects, such as dominance and epistasis. Despite this advantage, the biological interpretability of ANNs is still limited. The aim of this research was to estimate the heritability and markers effects for two traits in Coffea canephora using an additive-dominance architecture ANN and to compare it with genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP). The data used consists of 51 clones of C. canephora varietal Conilon, 32 of varietal group Robusta and 82 intervarietal hybrids. From this, 165 phenotyped individuals were genotyped for 14,387 SNPs. Due to the high computational cost of ANNs, we used Bagging decision tree to reduce the dimensionality of the data, selecting the markers that accumulated 70% of the total importance. An ANN with three hidden layers was run, each varying from 1 to 40 neurons summing 64,000 neural networks. The network architectures with the best predictive ability were selected. The best architectures were composed by 4, 15, and 33 neurons in the first, second and third hidden layers, respectively, for yield, and by 13, 20, and 24 neurons, respectively for rust resistance. The predictive ability was greater when using ANN with three hidden layers than using one hidden layer and GBLUP, with 0.72 and 0.88 for yield and coffee leaf rust resistance, respectively. The concordance rate (CR) of the 10% larger markers effects among the methods varied between 10% and 13.8%, for additive effects and between 5.4% and 11.9% for dominance effects. The narrow-sense ([Formula: see text]) and dominance-only ([Formula: see text]) heritability estimates were 0.25 and 0.06, respectively, for yield, and 0.67 and 0.03, respectively for rust resistance. The ANN was able to estimate the heritabilities from an additive-dominance genomic architectures and the ANN with three hidden layers obtained best predictive ability when compared with those obtained from GBLUP and ANN with one hidden layer."
https://openalex.org/W4210572560,"The aim was to investigate the long-term association between leisure time physical activity and hip areal bone mineral density (aBMD), in addition to change in hip aBMD over time, in 32-86 years old women and men.Data were retrieved from the 2001, 2007-2008, and 2015-2016 surveys of the Tromsø Study, a longitudinal population study in Norway. Leisure time physical activity was assessed by the four-level Saltin-Grimby Physical Activity Level Scale which refers to physical exertion in the past twelve months. Hip aBMD was assessed by Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry. Linear Mixed Model analysis was used to examine long-term associations between physical activity and hip aBMD (n = 6324). In addition, the annual change in hip aBMD was analyzed in a subsample of 3199 participants.Physical activity was significantly and positively associated with total hip aBMD in the overall cohort (p<0.005). Participants who reported vigorous activity had 28.20 mg/cm2 higher aBMD than those who were inactive (95% CI 14.71; 41.69, controlled for confounders), and even light physical activity was associated with higher aBMD than inactivity (8.32 mg/cm2, 95% CI 4.89; 11.76). Associations between physical activity and femoral neck aBMD yielded similar results. Hip aBMD decreased with age in both sexes, although more prominently in women. From 2001 to 2007-2008, aBMD changed by -5.76 mg/cm2 per year (95% CI -6.08; -5.44) in women, and -2.31 mg/cm2 (95% CI -2.69; -1.93), in men. From 2007-2008 to 2015-2016, the change was -4.45 mg/cm2 per year (95% CI -4.84; -4.06) in women, and -1.45 mg/cm2 (95% CI -1.92; -0.98) in men.In this cohort of adult men and women, physical activity levels were positively associated with hip aBMD in a dose-response relationship.

Associations between student characteristics and CE use were investigated using the chi-squared test and multiple logistic regression. Reasons for CE use, temporal patterns of use, details regarding purchase and types of CE used were compared by gender.One quarter of students had used CEs. There was a clear difference between users and non-users in terms of gender (p<0.001). CE users were disproportionately represented by students from either UAE or other Arab countries (p<0.001), and by students of Medicine, followed by Pharmacy, Dentistry, and Engineering (p<0.001). CE use increased with year of study, reaching the highest level in the fourth year (p<0.001), which for most programmes is the final year. Modafinil was self-administered, especially in males, for concentration and alertness; B12 was typically taken by female students for academic performance and concentration; and high-dosage caffeine compounds were ingested to improve alertness levels. Use of the internet for both obtaining information and purchasing CEs was frequently reported. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that gender, nationality, and year of study were associated with CE use among UAE university students.Universities need to address the prevalence of CE use amongst their students by providing effective support programs."
https://openalex.org/W4210678640,"Registering a donation decision is fundamental to increasing the number of people who donate the organs and tissues essential for transplantation, but the number of registered organ donors is insufficient to meet this demand. Most people in Australia support organ donation, but only a third have registered their decision on the Australian Organ Donor Register (AODR). We addressed this paradox by investigating how feelings of community, engendered through an ethic of hospitality and care and a non-proselytizing dialogue about organ donation, facilitated the decision to register.An Immediate Registration Opportunity was set up in a large public hospital in NSW, Australia. The public was approached and invited to engage in an open, respectful dialogic interaction that met people where their beliefs were and allowed their concerns and fears about donation to be discussed. This included a survey that measured positive and negative beliefs about organ donation, mood, atmosphere, and feelings of community coupled with an on-the-spot opportunity to register their donation decision.Over four days, we interacted with 357 participants; 75.5% (210) of eligible-to-register participants registered on the AODR. Generalized Structural Equation Modelling highlighted that as connection to community increased, so did the salience of positive beliefs about organ donation. Positive beliefs, in turn, were negatively correlated with negative beliefs about donation and, as the strength of negative beliefs decreased, the probability of registration on the AODR increased. Participants who registered on the AODR reported stronger connection to the broader community than participants who did not register.A respectful non-judgmental interaction that allows beliefs and concerns about organ donation to be discussed, coupled with an immediate opportunity to register, encouraged registration. Within this framework, feelings of belonging to a community were a key determinant that enabled many to make the decision to register."

A health-economic evaluation comparing these interventions has not yet been conducted.This study examined the one-year cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of blended ACT compared to face-to-face CBT for older adults with anxiety symptoms.The economic evaluation was embedded in a randomized controlled trial comparing blended ACT to CBT in 314 older adults with mild to moderately severe anxiety symptoms. Data were collected at baseline and 3, 6 and 12 months post baseline. For the cost-effectiveness analysis, treatment response was defined as a reliable improvement in anxiety symptom severity (measured with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) between baseline and 12-month follow-up. To assess cost-utility, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were computed using EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Levels-5 utility scores. Analyses took the societal perspective, including both healthcare costs and productivity costs. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated using 2500 bootstraps of seemingly unrelated regression equations of costs and effects. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the findings.Differences between the blended ACT group and CBT group in treatment response and QALYs were statistically insignificant and clinically irrelevant. The ACT intervention was associated with an average per-participant cost reduction of €466 ($593) compared to CBT, which resulted from lower productivity costs in the blended ACT group. From a healthcare perspective, the ACT intervention was associated with higher costs (by €71 ($90)) than CBT.The results do not indicate that from a health-economic perspective blended ACT should be preferred over CBT in the treatment of older adults with anxiety symptoms. The findings support a model of shared decision making, where clinicians and patients collaboratively decide on the preferred intervention, based on ethical-medical, practical and personal considerations.Netherlands Trial Register: TRIAL NL6131 (NTR6270); https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/6131."
https://openalex.org/W4210800842,"The aim of this retrospective observational study is to analyse clinical, serological and radiological predictors of outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia treated with tocilizumab, providing clinical guidance to its use in real-life.This is a retrospective, monocentric observational cohort study. All consecutive patients hospitalized between February the 11th and April 14th 2020 for severe COVID-19 pneumonia at Reggio Emilia AUSL and treated with tocilizumab were enrolled. The patient's clinical status was recorded every day using the WHO ordinal scale for clinical improvement. Response to treatment was defined as an improvement of one point (from the status at the beginning of tocilizumab treatment) during the follow-up on this scale. Bivariate association of main patients' characteristics with outcomes was explored by descriptive statistics and Fisher or Kruskal Wallis tests (respectively for qualitative or quantitative variables). Each clinically significant predictor was checked by a loglikelihood ratio test (in univariate logistic models for each of the considered outcomes) against the null model.A total of 173 patients were included. Only hypertension, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, PaO2/FiO2, respiratory rate and C-reactive protein were selected for the multivariate analysis. In the multivariable model, none of them was significantly associated with response.Evaluating a large number of clinical variables, our study did not find new predictors of outcome in COVID19 patients treated with tocilizumab. Further studies are needed to investigate the use of tocilizumab in COVID-19 and to better identify clinical phenotypes which could benefit from this treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4225523535,"Endometrioid endometrial carcinomas (EECs) are the most common histological subtype of uterine cancer. Late-stage disease is an adverse prognosticator for EEC. The purpose of this study was to analyze EEC exome mutation data to identify late-stage-specific statistically significantly mutated genes (SMGs), which represent candidate driver genes potentially associated with disease progression. We exome sequenced 15 late-stage (stage III or IV) non-ultramutated EECs and paired non-tumor DNAs; somatic variants were called using Strelka, Shimmer, SomaticSniper and MuTect. Additionally, somatic mutation calls were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data for 66 late-stage and 270 early-stage (stage I or II) non-ultramutated EECs. MutSigCV (v1.4) was used to annotate SMGs in the two late-stage cohorts and to derive p-values for all mutated genes in the early-stage cohort. To test whether late-stage SMGs are statistically significantly mutated in early-stage tumors, q-values for late-stage SMGs were re-calculated from the MutSigCV (v1.4) early-stage p-values, adjusting for the number of late-stage SMGs tested. We identified 14 SMGs in the combined late-stage EEC cohorts. When the 14 late-stage SMGs were examined in the TCGA early-stage data, only Krüppel-like factor 3 (KLF3) and Paired box 6 (PAX6) failed to reach significance as early-stage SMGs, despite the inclusion of enough early-stage cases to ensure adequate statistical power. Within TCGA, nonsynonymous mutations in KLF3 and PAX6 were, respectively, exclusive or nearly exclusive to the microsatellite instability (MSI)-hypermutated molecular subgroup and were dominated by insertions-deletions at homopolymer tracts. In conclusion, our findings are hypothesis-generating and suggest that KLF3 and PAX6, which encode transcription factors, are MSI target genes and late-stage-specific SMGs in EEC."
https://openalex.org/W4226276952,"We previously showed that some adipogenic transcription factors such as CEBPB and PPARG directly and indirectly regulate autophagy gene expression in adipogenesis. The order and effect of these events are undetermined. In this study, we modeled the gene expression, DNA-binding of transcriptional regulators, and histone modifications during adipocyte differentiation and evaluated the effect of the regulators on gene expression in terms of direction and magnitude. Then, we identified the overlap of the transcription factors and co-factors binding sites and targets. Finally, we built a chromatin state model based on the histone marks and studied their relation to the factors’ binding. Adipogenic factors differentially regulated autophagy genes as part of the differentiation program. Co-regulators associated with specific transcription factors and preceded them to the regulatory regions. Transcription factors differed in the binding time and location, and their effect on expression was either localized or long-lasting. Adipogenic factors disproportionately targeted genes coding for autophagy-specific transcription factors. In sum, a hierarchical arrangement between adipogenic transcription factors and co-factors drives the regulation of autophagy during adipocyte differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W4210323637,"Discontinuing contraception without switching to a different type of family planning (FP) method contributes to unwanted pregnancy and unsafe abortion. Unplanned discontinuation of Implanon (which is discontinuation of Implanon without switching, but not for reasons of wanting to get pregnant) during the first year and its possible determinants have not been well investigated in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the incidence and predictors of unplanned discontinuation of Implanon during the first year.A retrospective follow-up study was conducted among 413 consecutive series of eligible women at Ayder Comprehensive Specialized Hospital in Northern Ethiopia. Data were drawn from both FP initiation and removal registration books and from contacting users by phone over a one-year period (April 2016 and March 2017). The inclusion of the categorical predictor in the final Cox model was considered if the test had a P-value of <0.25 in the log-rank test. We identified predictors of time to unplanned discontinuation using a multivariable Cox regression analysis. Adjusted hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to assess the association of covariates with the risk of discontinuation. There were no statistically significant interaction terms and proportionality assumption was fulfilled.The unplanned discontinuation rate of Implanon during the first year was 18.2%, with an incidence density of 16.3 discontinuations/1000 women-months. Compared with those under 20 years of age, women aged 20 to 24 years (AHR = 0.42; 95% CI: 0.19-0.91) had a protective effect against discontinuation. On the other hand, clients whose partner's educational level was lower than secondary (AHR = 2.20; 95% CI: 1.08-4.49) and who had never used any modern contraception method before (AHR = 3.26; 95% CI: 1.61-6.61) had a higher risk of discontinuation.Our findings have significant implications for understanding why Implanon is discontinued in an unplanned manner, and will help policy makers plan the interventions needed to improve Implanon continuity by overcoming identified barriers. Providers in similar settings should pay more attention to clients whose partners have lower educational status and who are new acceptors."
https://openalex.org/W4210584342,"The use of glucocorticoid as local anesthetic adjuvant in single-injection adductor canal block (ACB) is well-documented but its effects in the presence of an indwelling catheter is unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine the impacts of one-time perineural glucocorticoid injection on continuous adductor canal block in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.A single center retrospective study of 95 patients undergoing unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) was performed. Patients were divided into three groups based on adjuvant received through ACB before continuous catheter placement: a control group with no adjuvant (N = 41), a treatment group with dexamethasone (DEX) as adjuvant (N = 33) and another treatment group with DEX/ Methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) as adjuvant (N = 21). The primary outcome was the amount of ropivacaine administered via patient controlled ACB catheter. Secondary outcomes included numeric pain score, perioperative opioid usage, immediately postoperative prosthetic knee joint active range of motion (AROM), opioid usage at 6 weeks and 3 months, length of stay and discharge disposition.Patients in both treatment groups demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in the requirement of self-administered ropivacaine than the control group on postoperative day (POD) 1 (p<0.001) and POD 2 (p<0.001). There was no significant difference in opioid consumption and pain scores between either treatment group vs. control. Compared to control (66%), more home disposition was observed in the DEX (88%, p = 0.028) and DEX/MPA group (95%, p = 0.011).This study suggested that single dose perineural glucocorticoid injection with DEX or DEX/MPA significantly decreased the dose of local anesthetic ropivacaine infusion required through continuous ACB for TKA while maintaining comparable level of pain score and opioid consumption, and significantly more patients were discharged home."
https://openalex.org/W4210612561,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly, but therapeutic options are lacking. Despite long being able to effectively treat the ill-effects of pathology present in various rodent models of AD, translation of these strategies to the clinic has so far been disappointing. One potential contributor to this situation is the fact that the vast majority of AD patients have other dementia-contributing comorbid pathologies, the most common of which are vascular in nature. This situation is modeled relatively infrequently in basic AD research, and almost never in preclinical studies. As part of our efforts to develop small molecule, anti-inflammatory therapeutics for neurological injury and disease, we have recently been exploring potentially promising treatments in preclinical multi-morbidity contexts. In the present study, we generated a mouse model of mixed amyloid and hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) pathology in which to test the efficacy of one of our anti-inflammatory compounds, MW151. HHcy can cause cerebrovascular damage and is an independent risk factor for both AD dementia and vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia. We found that MW151 was able to partially rescue hippocampal-dependent spatial memory and learning deficits in this comorbidity context, and further, that the benefit is associated with a normalization of hippocampal metabolites detectable via magnetic resonance spectroscopy. These findings provide evidence that MW151 in particular, and potentially anti-inflammatory treatment more generally, may be beneficial in AD patients with comorbid vascular pathology."
https://openalex.org/W4210439966,"The signal transduction system, which is known as a regulatory mechanism for biochemical reaction systems in the cell, has been the subject of intensive research in recent years, and its design methods have become necessary from the viewpoint of synthetic biology. We proposed the partition representation of enzymatic reaction networks consisting of post-translational modification reactions such as phosphorylation, which is an important basic component of signal transduction systems, and attempted to find enzymatic reaction networks with bistability to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed representation method. The partition modifiers can be naturally introduced into the partition representation of enzymatic reaction networks when applied to search. By randomly applying the partition modifiers as appropriate, we searched for bistable and resettable enzymatic reaction networks consisting of four post-translational modification reactions. The proposed search algorithm worked well and we were able to find various bistable enzymatic reaction networks, including a typical bistable enzymatic reaction network with positive auto-feedbacks and mutually negative regulations. Since the search algorithm is divided into an evaluation function specific to the characteristics of the enzymatic reaction network to be searched and an independent algorithm part, it may be applied to search for dynamic properties such as biochemical adaptation, the ability to reset the biochemical state after responding to a stimulus, by replacing the evaluation function with one for other characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W4210502556,"Food residues are often fed to dogs in private households and might also be a potential “new” ingredient for pet food in the future. As food residues might contain not only digestible, but also fermentable substrates, an effect on the intestinal microbiota can be assumed. In the present study, two batches of dried food residues (DFR) collected from hotels in Crete were microbially fermented in an in vitro batch culture system with canine fecal inoculum: non-sterile DFR including meat (DFR m ), sterile DFR including meat (DFR ms ) and sterile DFR without meat (DFR wms ). Different non-digestible carbohydrate sources (beet pulp, wheat bran, inulin, carrot pomace, brewer´s spent grains, cellulose and lignocellulose) were included for comparison. Inulin, cellulose and lignocellulose were only used as raw materials, while the other test substrates were incubated as raw and enzymatically pre-digested substrates. After incubation for 24 hours, the raw food residues markedly increased the concentrations of bacterial metabolites in the fermenters, although smaller effects were observed for the DFR wms . When the enzymatically pre-digested food residues were incubated, the effects were more pronounced for the DFR ms and DFR wms . In general, when compared with the other test substrates, the food residues were microbially fermented to a comparable or partly higher extent. Interestingly, high n-butyrate concentrations were measured in the inocula, both after incubation of the raw and pre-digested food residues. In conclusion, the food residues contained enzymatically digestible and microbially fermentable substrates. If considered as a potential future ingredient for pet food, a standardization of the collection and processing of food residues might be necessary in order to reduce compositional variability and varying effects on the intestinal microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W4210506268,"With the growth of the economy, the number of automobiles on the road is fast growing, resulting in substantial environmental pollution from exhaust gas emissions. In the automobile factory, some improvements have been achieved by constructing devices to degrade automobile exhaust. However, although most of the vehicle exhaust emissions have met the national standards, the exhaust gas is superimposed at the same time period due to the increasing traffic volume, making the exhaust emissions seriously reduce the air quality. Therefore, the scholars in the road field began to study new road materials to degrade vehicle exhaust, which has gradually become one of the effective ways to reduce automobile exhaust. Photocatalyst materials have been widely concerned because of their ability to oxidize harmful gases by solar photocatalysis. Yet, the effect has been not satisfactory because of the small light response range of photocatalyst material, which restricts the catalytic effect. In this study, this paper attempts to use Fe 3+ to modify the TiO 2 , which is one of the main photocatalytic materials, to expand the range of light reaction band and to improve the degradation effect of automobile exhaust. The degradation effects of ordinary TiO 2 and modified TiO 2 on automobile exhaust were compared by test system in the laboratory. The results show that the modified TiO 2 can effectively improve the performance of vehicle exhaust degradation. Moreover, the molecular dynamics method was used to establish the channel model of TiO 2 , and the dynamic process of automobile exhaust diffusion and absorption was simulated. The diffusion law and adsorption process of different types of automobile exhaust gas such as NO, CO, and CO 2 in the TiO 2 channel were analyzed from the molecular scale through the radial concentration distribution and adsorption energy."
https://openalex.org/W4210577073,"Based on von Neumann's model of an economy characterized by processes and goods, we add to that model a component representing capital equipment. We assume that the need for capital equipment by any process is proportional to the rate at which that process is running, and therefore an increase in rate requires that capital equipment be purchased, whereas a decrease in rate allows capital equipment to be sold. We thereby construct a continuous-time dynamical model, which we use to investigate the evolution of economic diversity under two price equilibrium scenarios: the first with non-negative prices and non-positive excess demands; the second with enforced market clearing and with prices allowed to be negative. The second scenario represents an economy in which recycling is required, so that excess supply cannot be discarded. We prove that at any time during the progression of the model economy, the solution to each of the two price equilibrium problems exists, and that non-uniqueness of the solution, if any, does not affect the development of the model economy. We compare matched model economies under the two scenarios by simulating their respective evolutions. In each case, the model economy experiences a process of selection and matures to a state of balanced growth, with a higher growth rate when excess supply is discarded, but with greater economic diversity with enforced recycling. The robustness of these qualitative results is demonstrated by repeated trials of simulations on matched pairs of model economies with different randomly chosen parameters."
https://openalex.org/W4226245988,"Objective(s) Our objective was to investigate the motivators and barriers associated with the individual or family decision to participate in cerebral palsy research. Based on this information, we offer suggestions to increase the likelihood of participation in future CP studies. Methods A digital survey was administered to stakeholders affected by cerebral palsy across the US. Our analysis focused on variables related to personal interests, travel, and study-specific elements. Statistical tests investigated the effects of responder type, cerebral palsy type, and Gross Motor Function Classification System level on travel and study-specific element variables. Recommendations were informed by responses reflecting the majority of respondents. Results Based on 233 responses, we found that respondents highly valued research participation (on average 88.2/100) and compensation (on average 62.3/100). Motivators included the potential for direct benefit (62.2%) and helping others (53.4%). The primary barriers to participation were schedule limitations (48.9%) and travel logistics (32.6%). Schedule limitations were especially pertinent to caregivers, while individuals with more severe cerebral palsy diagnoses reported the necessity of additional items to comfortably travel. Conclusions Overall, we encourage the involvement of stakeholders affected by cerebral palsy in the research process. Researchers should consider offering flexible study times, accommodating locations, and compensation for time and travel expenses. We recommend a minimum compensation of $15/hour and a maximum time commitment of 4 hours/day to respect participants’ time and increase likelihood of research participation. Future studies should track how attitudes toward research change with time and experience."
