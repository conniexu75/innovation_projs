https://openalex.org/W2811284901,"China has responded to a national land-system sustainability emergency via an integrated portfolio of large-scale programmes. Here we review 16 sustainability programmes, which invested US$378.5 billion (in 2015 US$), covered 623.9 million hectares of land and involved over 500 million people, mostly since 1998. We find overwhelmingly that the interventions improved the sustainability of China's rural land systems, but the impacts are nuanced and adverse outcomes have occurred. We identify some key characteristics of programme success, potential risks to their durability, and future research needs. We suggest directions for China and other nations as they progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations' Agenda 2030."
https://openalex.org/W2818540548,"Decades of work have aimed to genetically reprogram T cells for therapeutic purposes1,2 using recombinant viral vectors, which do not target transgenes to specific genomic sites3,4. The need for viral vectors has slowed down research and clinical use as their manufacturing and testing is lengthy and expensive. Genome editing brought the promise of specific and efficient insertion of large transgenes into target cells using homology-directed repair5,6. Here we developed a CRISPR-Cas9 genome-targeting system that does not require viral vectors, allowing rapid and efficient insertion of large DNA sequences (greater than one kilobase) at specific sites in the genomes of primary human T cells, while preserving cell viability and function. This permits individual or multiplexed modification of endogenous genes. First, we applied this strategy to correct a pathogenic IL2RA mutation in cells from patients with monogenic autoimmune disease, and demonstrate improved signalling function. Second, we replaced the endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) locus with a new TCR that redirected T cells to a cancer antigen. The resulting TCR-engineered T cells specifically recognized tumour antigens and mounted productive anti-tumour cell responses in vitro and in vivo. Together, these studies provide preclinical evidence that non-viral genome targeting can enable rapid and flexible experimental manipulation and therapeutic engineering of primary human immune cells."
https://openalex.org/W3098210289,"The quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional electron gases involves the flow of topologically protected dissipationless charge currents along the edges of a sample. Integer or fractional electrical conductance is associated with edge currents of electrons or quasiparticles with fractional charges, respectively. It has been predicted that quantum Hall phenomena can also be created by edge currents with a fundamentally different origin: the fractionalization of quantum spins. However, such quantization has not yet been observed. Here we report the observation of this type of quantization of the Hall effect in an insulating two-dimensional quantum magnet1, α-RuCl3, with a dominant Kitaev interaction (a bond-dependent Ising-type interaction) on a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice2-7. We find that the application of a magnetic field parallel to the sample destroys long-range magnetic order, leading to a field-induced quantum-spin-liquid ground state with substantial entanglement of local spins8-12. In the low-temperature regime of this state, the two-dimensional thermal Hall conductance reaches a quantum plateau as a function of the applied magnetic field and has a quantization value that is exactly half of the two-dimensional thermal Hall conductance of the integer quantum Hall effect. This half-integer quantization of the thermal Hall conductance in a bulk material is a signature of topologically protected chiral edge currents of charge-neutral Majorana fermions (particles that are their own antiparticles), which have half the degrees of freedom of conventional fermions13-16. These results demonstrate the fractionalization of spins into itinerant Majorana fermions and Z2 fluxes, which is predicted to occur in Kitaev quantum spin liquids1,3. Above a critical magnetic field, the quantization disappears and the thermal Hall conductance goes to zero rapidly, indicating a topological quantum phase transition between the states with and without chiral Majorana edge modes. Emergent Majorana fermions in a quantum magnet are expected to have a great impact on strongly correlated quantum matter, opening up the possibility of topological quantum computing at relatively high temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W3098567715,"Developing 'smart' membranes that allow precise and reversible control of molecular permeation using external stimuli would be of intense interest for many areas of science: from physics and chemistry to life-sciences. In particular, electrical control of water permeation through membranes is a long-sought objective and is of crucial importance for healthcare and related areas. Currently, such adjustable membranes are limited to the modulation of wetting of the membranes and controlled ion transport, but not the controlled mass flow of water. Despite intensive theoretical work yielding conflicting results, the experimental realisation of electrically controlled water permeation has not yet been achieved. Here we report electrically controlled water permeation through micrometre-thick graphene oxide (GO) membranes. By controllable electric breakdown, conductive filaments are created in the GO membrane. The electric field concentrated around such current carrying filaments leads to controllable ionisation of water molecules in graphene capillaries, allowing precise control of water permeation: from ultrafast permeation to complete blocking. Our work opens up an avenue for developing smart membrane technologies and can revolutionize the field of artificial biological systems, tissue engineering and filtration."
https://openalex.org/W2843925039,"The selective pressures that shape clonal evolution in healthy individuals are largely unknown. Here we investigate 8,342 mosaic chromosomal alterations, from 50 kb to 249 Mb long, that we uncovered in blood-derived DNA from 151,202 UK Biobank participants using phase-based computational techniques (estimated false discovery rate, 6-9%). We found six loci at which inherited variants associated strongly with the acquisition of deletions or loss of heterozygosity in cis. At three such loci (MPL, TM2D3-TARSL2, and FRA10B), we identified a likely causal variant that acted with high penetrance (5-50%). Inherited alleles at one locus appeared to affect the probability of somatic mutation, and at three other loci to be objects of positive or negative clonal selection. Several specific mosaic chromosomal alterations were strongly associated with future haematological malignancies. Our results reveal a multitude of paths towards clonal expansions with a wide range of effects on human health."
https://openalex.org/W2866743330,"The chemotherapeutic drug methotrexate inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase1, which generates tetrahydrofolate, an essential cofactor in nucleotide synthesis2. Depletion of tetrahydrofolate causes cell death by suppressing DNA and RNA production3. Although methotrexate is widely used as an anticancer agent and is the subject of over a thousand ongoing clinical trials4, its high toxicity often leads to the premature termination of its use, which reduces its potential efficacy5. To identify genes that modulate the response of cancer cells to methotrexate, we performed a CRISPR–Cas9-based screen6,7. This screen yielded FTCD, which encodes an enzyme—formimidoyltransferase cyclodeaminase—that is required for the catabolism of the amino acid histidine8, a process that has not previously been linked to methotrexate sensitivity. In cultured cancer cells, depletion of several genes in the histidine degradation pathway markedly decreased sensitivity to methotrexate. Mechanistically, histidine catabolism drains the cellular pool of tetrahydrofolate, which is particularly detrimental to methotrexate-treated cells. Moreover, expression of the rate-limiting enzyme in histidine catabolism is associated with methotrexate sensitivity in cancer cell lines and with survival rate in patients. In vivo dietary supplementation of histidine increased flux through the histidine degradation pathway and enhanced the sensitivity of leukaemia xenografts to methotrexate. The histidine degradation pathway markedly influences the sensitivity of cancer cells to methotrexate and may be exploited to improve methotrexate efficacy through a simple dietary intervention. Histidine metabolism influences the sensitivity of cancer cells to methotrexate, with mice bearing leukaemia xenografts showing increased response to the drug upon histidine supplementation."
https://openalex.org/W2990099050,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are involved in many physiological processes and are therefore key drug targets1. Although detailed structural information is available for GPCRs, the effects of lipids on the receptors, and on downstream coupling of GPCRs to G proteins are largely unknown. Here we use native mass spectrometry to identify endogenous lipids bound to three class A GPCRs. We observed preferential binding of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) over related lipids and confirm that the intracellular surface of the receptors contain hotspots for PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding. Endogenous lipids were also observed bound directly to the trimeric Gαsβγ protein complex of the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) in the gas phase. Using engineered Gα subunits (mini-Gαs, mini-Gαi and mini-Gα12)2, we demonstrate that the complex of mini-Gαs with the β1 adrenergic receptor (β1AR) is stabilized by the binding of two PtdIns(4,5)P2 molecules. By contrast, PtdIns(4,5)P2 does not stabilize coupling between β1AR and other Gα subunits (mini-Gαi or mini-Gα12) or a high-affinity nanobody. Other endogenous lipids that bind to these receptors have no effect on coupling, highlighting the specificity of PtdIns(4,5)P2. Calculations of potential of mean force and increased GTP turnover by the activated neurotensin receptor when coupled to trimeric Gαiβγ complex in the presence of PtdIns(4,5)P2 provide further evidence for a specific effect of PtdIns(4,5)P2 on coupling. We identify key residues on cognate Gα subunits through which PtdIns(4,5)P2 forms bridging interactions with basic residues on class A GPCRs. These modulating effects of lipids on receptors suggest consequences for understanding function, G-protein selectivity and drug targeting of class A GPCRs."

https://openalex.org/W2810743411,"Biotic connectivity between ecosystems can provide major transport of organic matter and nutrients, influencing ecosystem structure and productivity1, yet the implications are poorly understood owing to human disruptions of natural flows2. When abundant, seabirds feeding in the open ocean transport large quantities of nutrients onto islands, enhancing the productivity of island fauna and flora3,4. Whether leaching of these nutrients back into the sea influences the productivity, structure and functioning of adjacent coral reef ecosystems is not known. Here we address this question using a rare natural experiment in the Chagos Archipelago, in which some islands are rat-infested and others are rat-free. We found that seabird densities and nitrogen deposition rates are 760 and 251 times higher, respectively, on islands where humans have not introduced rats. Consequently, rat-free islands had substantially higher nitrogen stable isotope (δ15N) values in soils and shrubs, reflecting pelagic nutrient sources. These higher values of δ15N were also apparent in macroalgae, filter-feeding sponges, turf algae and fish on adjacent coral reefs. Herbivorous damselfish on reefs adjacent to the rat-free islands grew faster, and fish communities had higher biomass across trophic feeding groups, with 48% greater overall biomass. Rates of two critical ecosystem functions, grazing and bioerosion, were 3.2 and 3.8 times higher, respectively, adjacent to rat-free islands. Collectively, these results reveal how rat introductions disrupt nutrient flows among pelagic, island and coral reef ecosystems. Thus, rat eradication on oceanic islands should be a high conservation priority as it is likely to benefit terrestrial ecosystems and enhance coral reef productivity and functioning by restoring seabird-derived nutrient subsidies from large areas of ocean."
https://openalex.org/W2881801204,"Courtship rituals serve to reinforce reproductive barriers between closely related species. Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans exhibit reproductive isolation, owing in part to the fact that D. melanogaster females produce 7,11-heptacosadiene, a pheromone that promotes courtship in D. melanogaster males but suppresses courtship in D. simulans males. Here we compare pheromone-processing pathways in D. melanogaster and D. simulans males to define how these sister species endow 7,11-heptacosadiene with the opposite behavioural valence to underlie species discrimination. We show that males of both species detect 7,11-heptacosadiene using homologous peripheral sensory neurons, but this signal is differentially propagated to P1 neurons, which control courtship behaviour. A change in the balance of excitation and inhibition onto courtship-promoting neurons transforms an excitatory pheromonal cue in D. melanogaster into an inhibitory cue in D. simulans. Our results reveal how species-specific pheromone responses can emerge from conservation of peripheral detection mechanisms and diversification of central circuitry, and demonstrate how flexible nodes in neural circuits can contribute to behavioural evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2828365771,"Bioactive natural products have evolved to inhibit specific cellular targets and have served as lead molecules for health and agricultural applications for the past century1–3. The post-genomics era has brought a renaissance in the discovery of natural products using synthetic-biology tools4–6. However, compared to traditional bioactivity-guided approaches, genome mining of natural products with specific and potent biological activities remains challenging4. Here we present the discovery and validation of a potent herbicide that targets a critical metabolic enzyme that is required for plant survival. Our approach is based on the co-clustering of a self-resistance gene in the natural-product biosynthesis gene cluster7–9, which provides insight into the potential biological activity of the encoded compound. We targeted dihydroxy-acid dehydratase in the branched-chain amino acid biosynthetic pathway in plants; the last step in this pathway is often targeted for herbicide development10. We show that the fungal sesquiterpenoid aspterric acid, which was discovered using the method described above, is a sub-micromolar inhibitor of dihydroxy-acid dehydratase that is effective as a herbicide in spray applications. The self-resistance gene astD was validated to be insensitive to aspterric acid and was deployed as a transgene in the establishment of plants that are resistant to aspterric acid. This herbicide-resistance gene combination complements the urgent ongoing efforts to overcome weed resistance11. Our discovery demonstrates the potential of using a resistance-gene-directed approach in the discovery of bioactive natural products. Fungal genome mining targeted to self-resistance genes close to biosynthetic gene clusters identifies a pathway that produces aspterric acid, which proves to be a potent inhibitor of plant growth."
https://openalex.org/W2859185793,"Hedgehog (HH) signalling governs embryogenesis and adult tissue homeostasis in mammals and other multicellular organisms1–3. Whereas deficient HH signalling leads to birth defects, unrestrained HH signalling is implicated in human cancers2,4–6. N-terminally palmitoylated HH releases the repression of Patched to the oncoprotein smoothened (SMO); however, the mechanism by which HH recognizes Patched is unclear. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of human patched 1 (PTCH1) alone and in complex with the N-terminal domain of ‘native’ sonic hedgehog (native SHH-N has both a C-terminal cholesterol and an N-terminal fatty-acid modification), at resolutions of 3.5 Å and 3.8 Å, respectively. The structure of PTCH1 has internal two-fold pseudosymmetry in the transmembrane core, which features a sterol-sensing domain and two homologous extracellular domains, resembling the architecture of Niemann–Pick C1 (NPC1) protein7. The palmitoylated N terminus of SHH-N inserts into a cavity between the extracellular domains of PTCH1 and dominates the PTCH1–SHH-N interface, which is distinct from that reported for SHH-N co-receptors8. Our biochemical assays show that SHH-N may use another interface, one that is required for its co-receptor binding, to recruit PTCH1 in the absence of a covalently attached palmitate. Our work provides atomic insights into the recognition of the N-terminal domain of HH (HH-N) by PTCH1, offers a structural basis for cooperative binding of HH-N to various receptors and serves as a molecular framework for HH signalling and its malfunction in disease. High-resolution structures of the human plasma membrane protein patched 1 alone and in complex with the native form of the ligand sonic hedgehog are determined."
https://openalex.org/W2862834803,"Animal research indicates that a combination of physical activity and sensory enrichment has the largest and the only sustaining effect on adult neuroplasticity. Dancing has been suggested as a human homologue to this combined intervention as it poses demands on both physical and cognitive functions. For the present exploratory study, we designed an especially challenging dance program in which our elderly participants constantly had to learn novel and increasingly difficult choreographies. This six-month-long program was compared to conventional fitness training matched for intensity. An extensive pre/post-assessment was performed on the 38 participants (63-80 y), covering general cognition, attention, memory, postural and cardio-respiratory performance, neurotrophic factors and-most crucially-structural MRI using an exploratory analysis. For analysis of MRI data, a new method of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) designed specifically for pairwise longitudinal group comparisons was employed. Both interventions increased physical fitness to the same extent. Pronounced differences were seen in the effects on brain volumes: Dancing compared to conventional fitness activity led to larger volume increases in more brain areas, including the cingulate cortex, insula, corpus callosum and sensorimotor cortex. Only dancing was associated with an increase in plasma BDNF levels. Regarding cognition, both groups improved in attention and spatial memory, but no significant group differences emerged. The latter finding may indicate that cognitive benefits may develop later and after structural brain changes have taken place. The present results recommend our challenging dance program as an effective measure to counteract detrimental effects of aging on the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2846941494,"The mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) is a highly selective calcium channel and a major route of calcium entry into mitochondria. How the channel catalyses ion permeation and achieves ion selectivity are not well understood, partly because MCU is thought to have a distinct architecture in comparison to other cellular channels. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of MCU channels from zebrafish and Cyphellophora europaea at 8.5 Å and 3.2 Å resolutions, respectively. In contrast to a previous report of pentameric stoichiometry for MCU, both channels are tetramers. The atomic model of C. europaea MCU shows that a conserved WDXXEP signature sequence forms the selectivity filter, in which calcium ions are arranged in single file. Coiled-coil legs connect the pore to N-terminal domains in the mitochondrial matrix. In C. europaea MCU, the N-terminal domains assemble as a dimer of dimers; in zebrafish MCU, they form an asymmetric crescent. The structures define principles that underlie ion permeation and calcium selectivity in this unusual channel."
https://openalex.org/W2877383832,"The mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) is a highly selective calcium channel localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Here, we describe the structure of an MCU orthologue from the fungus Neosartorya fischeri (NfMCU) determined to 3.8 Å resolution by phase-plate cryo-electron microscopy. The channel is a homotetramer with two-fold symmetry in its amino-terminal domain (NTD) that adopts a similar structure to that of human MCU. The NTD assembles as a dimer of dimers to form a tetrameric ring that connects to the transmembrane domain through an elongated coiled-coil domain. The ion-conducting pore domain maintains four-fold symmetry, with the selectivity filter positioned at the start of the pore-forming TM2 helix. The aspartate and glutamate sidechains of the conserved DIME motif are oriented towards the central axis and separated by one helical turn. The structure of NfMCU offers insights into channel assembly, selective calcium permeation, and inhibitor binding."
https://openalex.org/W2808505390,"The hot streak—loosely defined as ‘winning begets more winnings’—highlights a specific period during which an individual’s performance is substantially better than his or her typical performance. Although hot streaks have been widely debated in sports1,2, gambling3–5 and financial markets6,7 over the past several decades, little is known about whether they apply to individual careers. Here, building on rich literature on the lifecycle of creativity8–22, we collected large-scale career histories of individual artists, film directors and scientists, tracing the artworks, films and scientific publications they produced. We find that, across all three domains, hit works within a career show a high degree of temporal regularity, with each career being characterized by bursts of high-impact works occurring in sequence. We demonstrate that these observations can be explained by a simple hot-streak model, allowing us to probe quantitatively the hot streak phenomenon governing individual careers. We find this phenomemon to be remarkably universal across diverse domains: hot streaks are ubiquitous yet usually unique across different careers. The hot streak emerges randomly within an individual’s sequence of works, is temporally localized, and is not associated with any detectable change in productivity. We show that, because works produced during hot streaks garner substantially more impact, the uncovered hot streaks fundamentally drive the collective impact of an individual, and ignoring this leads us to systematically overestimate or underestimate the future impact of a career. These results not only deepen our quantitative understanding of patterns that govern individual ingenuity and success, but also may have implications for identifying and nurturing individuals whose work will have lasting impact. The career trajectories of around 30,000 artists, film directors and scientists show that individuals in each domain have ‘hot streaks’ during which their works have increased impact, despite showing no increase in productivity."
https://openalex.org/W2882326707,"Mitochondrial calcium uptake is critical for regulating ATP production, intracellular calcium signalling, and cell death. This uptake is mediated by a highly selective calcium channel called the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). Here, we determined the structures of the pore-forming MCU proteins from two fungi by X-ray crystallography and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The stoichiometry, overall architecture, and individual subunit structure differed markedly from those described in the recent nuclear magnetic resonance structure of Caenorhabditis elegans MCU. We observed a dimer-of-dimer architecture across species and chemical environments, which was corroborated by biochemical experiments. Structural analyses and functional characterization uncovered the roles of key residues in the pore. These results reveal a new ion channel architecture, provide insights into calcium coordination, selectivity and conduction, and establish a structural framework for understanding the mechanism of mitochondrial calcium uniporter function."

https://openalex.org/W2810770499,"Accessing the intrinsic functionality of molecules for electronic applications1-3, light emission4 or sensing5 requires reliable electrical contacts to those molecules. A self-assembled monolayer (SAM) sandwich architecture6 is advantageous for technological applications, but requires a non-destructive, top-contact fabrication method. Various approaches ranging from direct metal evaporation6 over poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate7 (PEDOT:PSS) or graphene8 interlayers to metal transfer printing9 have been proposed. Nevertheless, it has not yet been possible to fabricate SAM-based devices without compromising film integrity, intrinsic functionality or mass-fabrication compatibility. Here we develop a top-contact approach to SAM-based devices that simultaneously addresses all these issues, by exploiting the fact that a metallic nanoparticle can provide a reliable electrical contact to individual molecules10. Our fabrication route involves first the conformal and non-destructive deposition of a layer of metallic nanoparticles directly onto the SAM (itself laterally constrained within circular pores in a dielectric matrix, with diameters ranging from 60 nanometres to 70 micrometres), and then the reinforcement of this top contact by direct metal evaporation. This approach enables the fabrication of thousands of identical, ambient-stable metal-molecule-metal devices. Systematic variation of the composition of the SAM demonstrates that the intrinsic molecular properties are not affected by the nanoparticle layer and subsequent top metallization. Our concept is generic to densely packed layers of molecules equipped with two anchor groups, and provides a route to the large-scale integration of molecular compounds into solid-state devices that can be scaled down to the single-molecule level."
https://openalex.org/W2852839336,"Honey taken directly from 59 bee hives on the Hawaiian island of Kaua'i was analyzed for glyphosate residue using ELISA techniques. Glyphosate residue was detected (> LOQ) in 27% of honey samples, at concentrations up to 342 ppb, with a mean = 118 ppb, S.E.M. 24 ppb. Of 15 honey samples store-purchased on Kaua'i, glyphosate was detected in 33%, with a mean concentration of 41 ppb, S.E.M. 14. Glyphosate residue was not detected in two samples from the island of Molokai but was in one of four samples from the island of Hawai'i. Presence and concentration of glyphosate residues were geospatially mapped with respect to Hawaiian land divisions. Mapping showed higher occurrence of glyphosate that was over LOQ (48%) and concentrations of glyphosate (mean = 125 ppb, S.E.M. 25 ppb; N = 15) in honey from the western, predominantly agricultural, half of Kaua'i versus the eastern half (4%, mean = 15 ppb; N = 1). Geographic Information System analysis of land use percentage was performed within a circular zone of 1 Km radius around each hive. Various land use types within each circular zone were transcribed into polygons and percent land use calculated. Only agriculture land use showed a strong positive correlation with glyphosate concentration. High glyphosate concentrations were also detected when extensive golf courses and/or highways were nearby. This suggests herbicide migration from the site of use into other areas by bees. Best management practices in use for curtailing pesticide migration are not effective and must be carefully re-assessed."

https://openalex.org/W2851273827,"Indicators of positive emotions are still scarce and many proposed behavioural markers have proven ambiguous. Studies established a link between acoustic signals and emitter's internal state, but few related to positive emotions and still fewer considered non-vocal sounds. One of them, the snort, is shared by several perrisodactyls and has been associated to positive contexts in these species. We hypothesized that this could be also the case in horses. In this species, there is a clear need for a thorough description of non-vocal acoustic signals (snorts, snores or blows are often used interchangeably) but overall this sound produced by nostrils during expiration has up to now been mostly considered as having a hygienic function. However, observations revealed that snorts were produced more in some individuals than in others, without relationship with air conditions. We observed 48 horses living in two ""extreme"" conditions: restricted conditions (single stall, low roughage diet) and naturalistic conditions (stable groups in pasture). The immediate place (e.g. stall/pasture) and the behavioural/postural (behaviour performed/ears positions) contexts of snort production were observed. We additionally performed an evaluation of the welfare state, using validated behavioural (e.g. stereotypies) and postural (e.g. overall ears positions) welfare indicators. The results show that 1) snort production was significantly associated with situations known to be positive for horses (e.g. feeding in pasture) and with a positive internal state (ears in forward or sidewards positions), 2) the riding school horses produced twice as many snorts when in pasture than in stall, 3) the naturalistic population emitted significantly more snorts than riding school ones in comparable contexts, 4) the frequency of snorts was negatively correlated with the composite total chronic stress score (TCSS, reflecting compromised welfare based on the horse's rank on the different indicators): the lower the TCSS, the higher the snort rate. Snorts therefore appear as reliable indicators of positive emotions."
https://openalex.org/W2617670834,"Poaching of forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis) for ivory has decimated their populations in Central Africa. Studying elephant movement can provide insight into habitat and resource use to reveal where, when, and why they move and guide conservation efforts. We fitted 17 forest elephants with global positioning system (GPS) collars in 2015 and 2016 in the tropical forest-grassland mosaic of the Wonga Wongué Presidential Reserve (WW), Gabon. Using the location data, we quantified movement distances, home ranges, and habitat use to examine the environmental drivers of elephant movements and predict where elephants occur spatially and temporally. Forest elephants, on average, traveled 2,840 km annually and had home ranges of 713 km2, with males covering significantly larger home ranges than females. Forest elephants demonstrated both daily and seasonal movement patterns. Daily, they moved between forest and grassland at dawn and dusk. Seasonally, they spent proportionally more time in grassland than forest during the short-wet season when grasses recruit. Forest elephants also traveled faster during the short-wet season when fruit availability was greatest, likely reflecting long, direct movements to preferred fruiting tree species. Forest elephants tended to select areas with high tree and shrub density that afford cover and browse. When villages occurred in their home ranges elephants spent a disproportionate amount of time near them, particularly in the dry season, probably for access to agricultural crops and preferred habitat. Given the importance of the grassland habitat for elephants, maintenance of the forest-grassland matrix is a conservation priority in WW. Law enforcement, outreach, and education should focus on areas of potential human-elephant conflict near villages along the borders of the reserve. GPS-tracking should be extended into multi-use areas in the peripheries of protected areas to evaluate the effects of human disturbance on elephant movements and to maintain connectivity among elephant populations in Gabon."

https://openalex.org/W2861902262,"During emergency queen rearing, worker honey bees (Apis mellifera) select several otherwise worker-destined larvae to instead rear as candidates to replace their dead or failing queen. This choice is crucial as the queen is the sole reproductive in the colony and her quality is essential to its success. Because honey bee queens mate with and store sperm from multiple drones, emergency queen selection presents workers with an opportunity to increase fitness by selecting full- (0.75 relatedness), rather than half- (0.25 relatedness), sisters as new queen candidates. Through patriline analysis of colonies along with large numbers of emergency queens reared by each we affirm the purported “royal” patriline theory that, instead of competing nepotistically, workers exhibit bias towards selecting individuals from particular “royal” subfamilies during emergency queen rearing events, Further, we show that these “royal” patrilines are cryptic in honey bee colonies; occurring in such low frequency in the overall colony population that they are frequently undetected in traditional tests of queen mating number and colony composition. The identification of these cryptic “royal” subfamilies reveals that honey bee queens, already considered “hyperpolyandrous,” are mating with even more males than has been previously recognized. These results alter our understanding of reproductive behavior in honey bees, raising questions about the evolutionary implications of this phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2827874679,"Population parameters of poorly marked gregarious species are difficult to estimate. This is the case for common dolphins (Delphinus sp.), a genus known for its lack of distinctive marks resulting in a low mark ratio. Furthermore, the widespread nature of common dolphins results in low recaptures. We developed reliable photo-identification protocols to ensure accurate identification of individuals in the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand. These protocols combined the use of nicks and notches and pigmentation patterns for identification and included the development of a distinctiveness threshold. The data were further stratified by the level of distinctiveness of each individual (as distinctive or highly-distinctive). Photo-identification surveys were conducted from January 2010 to December 2013. Mark-recapture techniques were implemented through a POPAN super-population approach to estimate seasonal apparent survival, capture probability and abundance of dolphins. A total of 2,083 unique adult common dolphins were identified, 51.3% were classified as D1 (highly distinctive; n = 1,069) and 48.7% as D2 (distinctive; n = 1,014). Of all individuals identified, 34.3% (n = 704) were re-sighted over subsequent years. The proportion of marked dolphins (when compared to unmarked dolphins) was 26.3% for D1 and 46.4% for D1 & D2, respectively. Apparent survival was estimated at 0.767 (CI = 0.694–0.827) for D1 animals, and 0.796 (CI = 0.729–0.850) for D1 & D2 combined. For D1 only, seasonal abundance varied from 732 (CI = 460–1,177) in autumn 2010 to 5,304 (CI = 4,745–5,930) in spring 2013. While the inclusion of D2 individuals may offer a more precise estimate of total abundance, the inability to determine additional sources of bias (for example, arising from under or overestimated mark ratios) meant that estimates for D1 individuals were deemed the least biased for this population. The photo-identification protocol, stratification of the data and steps taken to eliminate potential model violations provided a useful and novel approach to estimate population parameters for common dolphins. These approaches could be implemented for other large gregarious populations (≥500 individuals) of animals with poor natural markings."

However, S. frequens populations in rice paddy fields have declined in recent decades. Dragonfly larvae are predatory aquatic insects that feed on other organisms found in habitats with slow-moving or standing water. The increasing use of fipronil and neonicotinoid insecticides in agriculture is also increasing exposure to Sympetrum spp. in larval stages through paddy soil and water. The role of fipronil insecticides in the decline of dragonflies is of concern, and we here examine the sublethal effects of this insecticide on the feeding behaviors of two Sympetrum spp. Based on the quantity of prey items consumed and the time to capture prey items, feeding inhibition was determined to be a potential mechanism of the decline of Sympetrum spp. following 48-h exposure to fipronil and fipronil sulfone. Prey consumption by S. infuscatum was significantly reduced for fipronil sulfone at all concentrations (0.01–1000 μg/L). S. frequens exposed to 1, 10, 100 and 1000 μg/L fipronil sulfone had significantly longer prey capture times. Fipronil sulfone was 2.8, 9.7 and 10.5 times more toxic to S. infuscatum than fipronil in terms of acute toxicity, feeding inhibition and delayed toxicity, respectively. In addition, fipronil sulfone was 6.6, 2.9 and 9.1 times more toxic, respectively, to S. frequens than fipronil. Our findings suggest that sublethal effects on feeding inhibition lead to severe mortality at realistic paddy soil and water concentrations. Our results provide the first demonstration that short-term exposure to fipronil and fipronil sulfone can consequently cause significant harm to dragonfly larvae survival due to feeding inhibition. These findings have implications for current pesticide risk assessment and dragonfly protection."
https://openalex.org/W2844435616,"Despite its widespread clinical use, there is little data available from population-based studies on the determinants of serum sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). We aimed to examine multifactorial determinants of circulating SHBG levels in community-dwelling men. Study participants comprised randomly selected 35-80 y.o. men (n = 2563) prospectively-followed for 5 years (n = 2038) in the Men Androgen Inflammation Lifestyle Environment and Stress (MAILES) study. After excluding men with illness or medications known to affect SHBG (n = 172), data from 1786 men were available at baseline, and 1476 at follow-up. The relationship between baseline body composition (DXA), serum glucose, insulin, triglycerides, thyroxine (fT4), sex steroids (total testosterone (TT), oestradiol (E2)), and pro-inflammatory cytokines and serum SHBG level at both baseline & follow-up was determined by linear and penalized logistic regression models adjusting for age, lifestyle & demographic, body composition, metabolic, and hormonal factors. Restricted cubic spline analyses was also conducted to capture possible non-linear relationships. At baseline there were positive cross-sectional associations between age (β = 0.409, p<0.001), TT (β = 0.560, p<0.001), fT4 (β = 0.067, p = 0.019) and SHBG, and negative associations between triglycerides (β = -0.112, p<0.001), abdominal fat mass (β = -0.068, p = 0.032) and E2 (β = -0.058, p = 0.050) and SHBG. In longitudinal analysis the positive determinants of SHBG at 4.9 years were age (β = 0.406, p = <0.001), TT (β = 0.461, p = <0.001), and fT4 (β = 0.040, p = 0.034) and negative determinants were triglycerides (β = -0.065, p = 0.027) and abdominal fat mass (β = -0.078, p = 0.032). Taken together these data suggest low SHBG is a marker of abdominal obesity and increased serum triglycerides, conditions which are known to have been associated with low testosterone and low T4."
https://openalex.org/W2854951783,"Epithelial cells aggregate into spheroids when deprived of matrix, and the proclivity for spheroid formation and survival is a hallmark of normal and tumorigenic mammary stem cells. We show here that Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1 (NRF1) is a spheroid promoter by in silico identification of this transcription factor as highly connected to top shRNA-hits deduced from re-iterative selections for shRNAs enriched in MCF10A spheroids. NRF1-promoted spheroid survival is linked to its stimulation of mitochondrial OXPHOS, cell migration, invasion, and mesenchymal transition. Conversely, NRF1 knockdown in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells reduced spheroids, migration, invasion, and mesenchymal marker expression. NRF1 knockdown also reduced tumor burden in mammary fat pads and lungs of orthotopic- or tail vein-transplanted mice. With the Luminal A subtype of breast cancer, higher NRF1 expression is associated with lower survival. These results show that NRF1, an activator of mitochondrial metabolism, supports mammary spheroid survival and tumor development."

As morphological features of the cerebellum in atypically developing individuals remain unexplored in-vivo, this is the first study to use high-resolution 3D fractal analysis to estimate fractal dimension (FD), a measure of structural complexity of an object, of the left and right cerebellar cortex (automatically segmented from Magnetic Resonance Images using FreeSurfer), in male children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) (N = 20; mean age: 8.8 years old, range: 7.13-10.27) and sex, age, verbal-IQ, and cerebellar volume-matched typically developing (TD) boys (N = 18; mean age: 8.9 years old, range: 6.47-10.52). We focus on an age range within the 'middle and late childhood' period of brain development, between 6 and 12 years. A Mann-Whitney U test revealed a significant reduction in the FD of the right cerebellar cortex in ASD relative to TD boys (P = 0.0063, Bonferroni-corrected), indicating flatter and less regular surface protrusions in ASD relative to TD males. Consistent with the prediction that the cerebellum participates in implicit learning, those ASD boys with a higher (vs. lower) PIQ>VIQ difference showed higher, more normative complexity values, closer to TD children, providing new insight on our understanding of the neurological basis of differences in verbal and performance cognitive abilities that often characterize individuals with ASD."
https://openalex.org/W2859449161,"Angiotensin II (AngII), a vasoactive peptide that elevates arterial blood pressure and results in hypertension, has been reported to directly induce vascular endothelial cell apoptosis. Recent work has demonstrated that propofol pre-treatment attenuates angiotensin II-induced apoptosis in human coronary artery endothelial cells. However, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) subjected to angiotensin II-induced apoptosis in the presence or absence of propofol treatment and found that angiotensin II-induced apoptosis was attenuated by propofol in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, ELISA assays demonstrated that the ratio of angiotensin (1-7) (Ang (1-7)) to Ang II was increased after propofol treatment. We examined the expression of ACE2, Ang (1-7) and Mas and found that the ACE2-Ang (1-7)-Mas axis was up-regulated by propofol, while ACE2 overexpression increased phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (phosphorylated eNOS) expression and siACE2 resulted in the repression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation. In conclusion, our study revealed that propofol can inhibit endothelial cell apoptosis induced by Ang II by activating the ACE2-Ang (1-7)-Mas axis and further up-regulating the expression and phosphorylation of eNOS."
https://openalex.org/W2861318006,"Cancer cells are able to survive in difficult conditions, reprogramming their metabolism according to their requirements. Under hypoxic conditions they shift from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis, a behavior known as Warburg effect. In the last years, glycolytic enzymes have been identified as potential targets for alternative anticancer therapies. Recently, phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), an ubiquitous enzyme expressed in all somatic cells that catalyzes the seventh step of glycolysis which consists of the reversible phosphotransfer reaction from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to ADP, has been discovered to be overexpressed in many cancer types. Moreover, several somatic variants of PGK1 have been identified in tumors. In this study we analyzed the effect of the single nucleotide variants found in cancer tissues on the PGK1 structure and function. Our results clearly show that the variants display a decreased catalytic efficiency and/or thermodynamic stability and an altered local tertiary structure, as shown by the solved X-ray structures. The changes in the catalytic properties and in the stability of the PGK1 variants, mainly due to the local changes evidenced by the X-ray structures, suggest also changes in the functional role of PGK to support the biosynthetic need of the growing and proliferating tumour cells."
https://openalex.org/W2867105597,"LLINs containing an insecticide plus the synergist, piperonyl butoxide (PBO) have been designed for increased efficacy against pyrethroid-resistant malaria vectors. In this study, two LLINs with PBO, PermaNet® 3.0 and Olyset® Plus, and a pyrethroid-only LLIN, Yorkool®, were evaluated in experimental huts against a free-flying, wild population of Anopheles gambiae s.l. in Kolokopé, a cotton cultivated area of Togo. WHO susceptibility tube tests and subsequent molecular assays determine the An. gambiae s.l. populations to be resistant to pyrethroids and DDT with both target site kdr and metabolic resistance mechanisms involved in the resistance observed. Anopheles gambiae s.s. and An. coluzzi were present in sympatry though the kdr (L1014F) mutation was observed at a higher frequency in An. gambiae s.s. The experimental hut results showed that both PermaNet® 3.0 and Olyset® Plus nets induced similar levels of deterrence, exophily, and reduced blood feeding rate against wild An. gambiae s.l. in contrast to the pyrethroid only LLIN, Yorkool®. The proportion of wild An. gambiae s.l. killed by unwashed PermaNet® 3.0 was significantly higher than unwashed Olyset® Plus (corrected mortality 80.5% compared to 66.6%). Similar blood feeding inhibition rates were observed for unwashed PermaNet® 3.0 and Olyset® Plus; however, PermaNet® 3.0 washed 20 times demonstrated significantly higher blood feeding inhibition rate than Olyset® Plus washed 20 times (91.1% compared with 85.6% respectively). Yorkool® performed the worst for all the parameters evaluated. In an area of pyrethroid resistance of An. gambiae s.l involving kdr target site and metabolic resistance mechanisms, LLINs with PBO can provide additional protection in terms of reduction in blood feeding and increase in mosquito mortality compared to a pyrethroid-only net, and should be considered in malaria vector control strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2880576664,"We aimed to estimate the impact of a Community-Based Health Insurance (CBHI) scheme on utilization of healthcare from medically trained providers (MTP) by informal workers. A quasi-experimental study was conducted where insured households were included in the intervention group and uninsured households in comparison group. In total 1,292 (646 insured and 646 uninsured) households were surveyed from Chandpur district comprising urban and rural areas after 1 year period of CBHI introduction. Matching of the characteristics of insured and uninsured groups was performed using a propensity score matching approach to minimize the observed baseline differences among the groups. Multilevel logistic regression model, with adjustment for individual and household characteristics was used for estimating association between healthcare utilization from the MTP and insurance enrolment. The utilization of healthcare from MTP was significantly higher in the insured group (50.7%) compared to the uninsured group (39.4%). The regression analysis demonstrated that the CBHI beneficiaries were 2.111 (95% CI: 1.458–3.079) times more likely to utilize healthcare from MTP.CBHI scheme increases the utilization of MTP among informal workers. Ensuring such healthcare for these workers and their dependents is a challenge in many low and middle income countries. The implementation and scale-up of CBHI schemes have the potential to address this challenge of universal health coverage."
https://openalex.org/W2818129395,"Shame and guilt seem to be two synonymous moral emotions but actually lead to contrasting human behaviors or behavioral tendencies. Shame drives people to hide or deny their wrongdoings while guilt drives people to amend their mistakes. How shame and guilt evolved in humans is still obscure. Here we present a computer model featured with reciprocal altruism and gregarious lifestyle for studying this question. We tested ten different strategies in our model and the pairwise contests show that shame-driven-hiding strategy can dominate the other strategies such as tit-for-tat and Pavlov in more than half of parameter combinations. The mathematical analysis of our model demonstrates that shame-driven-hiding strategy is an evolutionary stable strategy within a group as long as hiding can let an individual evade the retaliations to his wrongdoings. However, the problem of hiding is that it reduces an individual’s social circle, i.e. living in a smaller group. Our analysis also shows that guilt-driven-amending strategy can outperform shame-driven-denying strategy at both individual and group levels if the cooperative behavior is sustainable within a group (b/(b-c) < T/n). Thus, we propose that shame is more adaptive at the individual level while guilt is more advantageous in the context of intergroup competition."
https://openalex.org/W2845863687,"The auditory system of the cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus, demonstrates an unusual amount of anatomical plasticity in response to injury, even in adults. Unilateral removal of the ear causes deafferented auditory neurons in the prothoracic ganglion to sprout dendrites across the midline, a boundary they typically respect, and become synaptically connected to the auditory afferents of the contralateral ear. The molecular basis of this sprouting and novel synaptogenesis in the adult is not understood. We hypothesize that well-conserved developmental guidance cues may recapitulate their guidance functions in the adult in order to facilitate this compensatory growth. As a first step in testing this hypothesis, we have generated a de novo assembly of a prothoracic ganglion transcriptome derived from control and deafferented adult individuals. We have mined this transcriptome for orthologues of guidance molecules from four well-conserved signaling families: Slit, Netrin, Ephrin, and Semaphorin. Here we report that transcripts encoding putative orthologues of most of the candidate developmental ligands and receptors from these signaling families were present in the assembly, indicating expression in the adult G. bimaculatus prothoracic ganglion."
https://openalex.org/W2877169991,"In semi-arid areas of China, the ridge-furrow mulched with plastic film (RF) cultivation system is a common water-saving agricultural technique where the shortage of water resources has become a serious problem. Therefore, we aimed to explore whether this cultivation is actually an improvement over the traditional flat planting (TF) method while testing two deficit irrigation (150, 75 mm) levels to grow winter wheat. Furthermore, we examined the responses of the anti-oxidative defence system and photosynthetic capacity of winter wheat flag leaves under three simulated rainfall (275, 200 and 125 mm) conditions. The results showed that the RF system with 150 mm deficit irrigation and 200 mm simulated rainfall condition (RF2150) treatment raised soil water content (%) at the jointing and flowering stages and achieved higher net photosynthesis rates (Pn) in flag leaves. Furthermore, such improvements were due to the reduction of malondialdehyde (MDA) content and oxidative damage during different growth stages of winter wheat. The RF2150 treatment significantly increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD); peroxidise (POD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and the content of soluble protein (SP) during different growth stages of winter wheat. Furthermore, RF2150 treatment attained the highest value at the flowering stage, while also exhibiting significant declines in contents of proline, MDA, H2O2 and O2 in flag leaves. The higher free H2O2 and O2 scavenging capacity and better anti-oxidative enzyme activities under the RF2150 treatment were due to the lower level of lipid peroxidation, which effectively protected the photosynthetic machinery. The net photosynthetic rate of flag leaves was positively correlated with SOD, POD, CAT, APX and SP activities, and negatively correlated with proline, MDA, H2O2 and O2 contents. We concluded that the RF2150 treatment was the better water-saving management strategy because it significantly delayed flag leaf senescence and caused the increases in SWC, WUE, Pn, antioxidant enzyme activities and grain yield of winter wheat grown in semi-arid regions of China."
https://openalex.org/W2834761733,"Background Geological evolution of the African continent has been subject to complex processes including uplift, volcanism, desert formation and tectonic rifting. This complex geology has created substantial biogeographical barriers, and coupled with anthropogenic introductions of freshwater fishes, has influenced the genetic diversity, connectivity and sub-structuring of the teleost fauna. Nile perch, Lates niloticus, is an iconic fish in Africa and is of high commercial importance, both in the species’ native range and where it has been translocated. However, the species is in decline and there is a need to understand its population genetic structure to facilitate sustainable management of the fishery and aquaculture development. Methodology Nile perch tissue samples were acquired from two West and four East (Lakes; Albert, Kyoga, Victoria and Turkana) African locations. Nineteen polymorphic microsatellite loci were used to study the genetic variation among populations across regions (West and East Africa), as well as between native and introduced environments within East Africa. Principal findings and their significance Results revealed strong and significant genetic structuring among populations across the sampled distribution (divergence across regions, FCT = 0.26, P = 0.000). STRUCTURE analysis at a broad scale revealed K = 2 clusters, the West African individuals were assigned to one cluster, while all individuals from the East African region, regardless of whether native or introduced, were assigned to another cluster. The distinct genetic clusters identified in the current study between the West and East African Nile perch, appear to have been maintained by presence of biogeographic barriers and restricted gene flow between the two regions. Therefore, any translocations of Nile perch should be carefully considered across the regions of West and East Africa. Further analysis at a regional scale revealed further structuring of up to K = 3 genetic clusters in East African Nile perch. Significantly (P < 0.05) lower genetic diversity based on analysis of allelic richness (AR) was obtained for the two translocated populations of Lake Kyoga (AR = 3.61) and Lake Victoria (AR = 3.52), compared to Nile perch populations from their putative origins of Lakes Albert (AR = 4.12) and Turkana (AR = 4.43). The lower genetic diversity in the translocated populations may be an indication of previous bottlenecks and may also indicate a difficulty for these populations to persist and adapt to climatic changes and anthropogenic pressures that are currently present in the East African region."

Cox proportional hazard regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and their respective 95% confidence interval (CIs) for various time periods within groups stratified by race, age and sex.Five-year survival for Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) was 89% for patients 20-49 years of age. For this age group, compared to 1990-1994, survival significantly improved in 2000-2004 (HR = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.54-0.78), 2005-2009 (HR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.38-0.57) and 2010-2014 (HR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.20-0.41).

In patients with non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), all age groups showed survival improvements between 1990-1994 period and 2010-2014 period. Improvements in HL and NHL survival were seen for all race categories and both genders.Survival among US lymphoma patients has improved substantially between 1990-1994 period and 2010-2014 period, though disease-specific mortality was still higher in older age groups."
https://openalex.org/W2850679142,"Satellite derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a common data source for monitoring regional and global ecosystem properties. In dry lands it has contributed to estimation of inter-annual and seasonal vegetation dynamics and phenology. However, due to the spectral properties of NDVI it can be affected by clouds which can introduce missing data in the time series. Remotely sensed soil moisture has in contrast to NDVI the benefit of being unaffected by clouds due to the measurements being made in the microwave domain. There is therefore a potential in combining the remotely sensed NDVI with remotely sensed soil moisture to enhance the quality and estimate the missing data. We present a step towards the usage of remotely sensed soil moisture for estimation of savannah NDVI. This was done by evaluating the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) soil moisture and three of its individual products with respect to their relative performance. The individual products are from the advance scatterometer (ASCAT), Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), and the Land Parameter Retrieval Model-Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (LPRM-AMSR-E). Each dataset was used to simulate NDVI, which was subsequently compared to remotely sensed NDVI from MODIS. Differences in their ability to estimate NDVI indicated that, on average, CCI soil moisture differs from its individual products by showing a higher average correlation with measured NDVI. Overall NDVI modelled from CCI soil moisture gave an average correlation of 0.81 to remotely sensed NDVI which indicates its potential to be used to estimate seasonal variations in savannah NDVI. Our result shows promise for further development in using CCI soil moisture to estimate NDVI. The modelled NDVI can potentially be used together with other remotely sensed vegetation datasets to enhance the phenological information that can be acquired, thereby, improving the estimates of savannah vegetation phenology."

Spatially explicit fisheries data were collected to understand the distribution of fishing effort and to identify high pressure fishing zones. Approximately 7,945 square kilometres of fishing grounds were surveyed and 3,427 fishing trips were observed using nine GPS enabled echo-sounders operated by fishermen. Data were visualised and non parametric statistical analysis revealed distinct patterns in fishing effort, high density fishing zones and large overlaps in zones between traditional, motorised and mechanised craft. Existing marine fishing regulations for the respective regions were also evaluated and violations were mapped. Results were presented in each of the villages and then in district wide meetings with community leaders to spur discussions on resource based conflicts and fisheries management. Our findings suggest that the present trajectory of resource over-exploitation, the use of destructive fishing methods combined with the lack of compliance to current regulations will lead to a collapse of the small scale fishing industry and further intensify conflicts within the community. Recommendations made by fishing community leaders are presented and their role in local fisheries management is discussed. This study is the first of its kind for this region and can easily be replicated at regional scales to develop a better understanding of the spatial extent and nature of small scale fisheries, including conflict, for the purpose of fisheries management."
https://openalex.org/W2852316205,"Bioluminescence is a fascinating phenomenon and can be found in many different organisms including fish. It has been suggested that bioluminescence is used for example for defense, prey attraction, and for intraspecific communication to attract for example sexual partners. The flashlight fish, Anomalops katoptron (A. katoptron), is a nocturnal fish that produces bioluminescence and lives in shallow waters, which makes it ideal for laboratory studies. In order to understand A. katoptron's ability to detect bioluminescent light (480 to 490 nm) at night, we characterized the visual system adaptation of A. katoptron using phylogenetic, electrophysiological and behavioral studies. We found that the retinae of A. katoptron contain rods and sparse cones. A. katoptron retinae express two main visual pigments, rhodopsin (RH1), and to a lesser extent, rhodopsin-like opsin (RH2). Interestingly, recombinant RH1 and RH2 are maximally sensitive to a wavelength of approximately 490 nm light (λmax), which correspond to the spectral peak of in vivo electroretinogram (ERG) measurements. In addition, behavioral assays revealed that A. katoptron is attracted by low intensity blue but not red light. Collectively, our results suggest that the A. katoptron visual system is optimized to detect blue light in the frequency range of its own bioluminescence and residual starlight."

The present work uses a large-scale survey to study the users of two prominent social reference managers—Mendeley and Zotero. The survey examines demographic characteristics, usage of the platforms, as well as attitudes towards key issues in scholarly communication, such as open access, peer review, privacy, and the reward system of science. Results show strong differences between platforms: Mendeley users are younger and more gender-balanced; Zotero users are more engaged in social media and more likely to come from the social sciences and humanities. Zotero users are more likely to use the platform’s search functions and to organize their libraries, while Mendeley users are more likely to take advantage of some of the discovery and networking features—such as browsing papers and groups and connecting with other users. We discuss the implications of using metrics derived from these platforms as impact indicators."
https://openalex.org/W2838975583,"Due to recent developments in technologies associated with the Internet of Things (IoT), a large number of people now regularly use smart devices, such as smartwatches and smartphones. However, these devices are prone to data leaks because of security vulnerabilities. In particular, Android devices use permission-based security, which allows users to directly approve permissions requested by an app when installing it. As a result, many malicious apps can obtain and leak private user data by requesting more permissions than are needed. However, it is difficult to identify malicious apps based solely on the requested permissions. A system is hence needed to accurately identify malicious apps and protect private data from them. In this paper, we propose a system for hiding data related to a user’s contacts or providing virtual data according to preconfigured policies when an Android app requests access to them. By hiding data related to the contacts, the proposed system can protect them from malicious apps. By using virtual data, it can even detect malicious apps that leak private data. The system requires less storage and provides faster access to user contacts than prevalent solutions to similar problems."
https://openalex.org/W2880455874,"Introduction Maintaining normothermia during anesthesia is imperative to provide quality patient care and to prevent adverse outcomes. Prolonged laparoscopic procedures have been identified as a potential risk factor for hypothermia, due to continuous insufflation of cold and dry carbon dioxide. Perioperative hypothermia is associated with increased hospital cost and many complications including; impaired drug metabolism, impaired immune function, cardiac morbidity, shivering, coagulopathy. Methods In this experimental study, four pigs underwent four interventions each, resulting in 16 total trials. Using standardized general anesthesia in a randomized Latin-square sequence the four interventions include: 1. Control group without an administered pneumoperitoneum, 2. Administered standard pneumoperitoneum using 21°C insufflated gas and under-body forced-air warming, 3. Administered pneumoperitoneum with insufflation of warmed/humidified carbon dioxide, 4. Administered pneumoperitoneum with insufflation of warmed/humidified carbon dioxide and under-body forced-air warming. The primary outcome was distal esophageal temperature change 4 hours after trocar insertion. Results Four hours after trocar insertion, pigs in the control group lost 2.1 ± 0.4°C; pigs with warmed and humidified insufflation lost 1.8 ± 0.4°C; pigs with forced-air warming group lost 1.3 ± 0.9°C; and pigs exposed to a combination of warmed and humidified insufflation with forced-air warming increased by 0.3 ± 0.2°C. Conclusion This experimental animal study provides evidence that a combination of warmed and humidified insufflation of carbon dioxide (CO2) in conjunction with forced-air warming is an effective strategy in the prevention of perioperative hypothermia. Further clinical trials investigating humans are therefore indicated."
https://openalex.org/W2878918079,"Genetic variation is the basis upon which natural selection acts to yield evolutionary change. In a rapidly changing environment, increasing genetic variation should increase evolutionary potential, particularly for small, isolated populations. However, the introduction of new alleles, either through natural or human-mediated processes, may have unpredictable consequences such as outbreeding depression. In this study, we identified a contact zone and limited gene flow between historically separated genetic lineages of American pikas (Ochotona princeps), representing the northern and southern Rocky Mountain subspecies, within Rocky Mountain National Park. The limited spatial extent of gene flow observed may be the result of geographic barriers to dispersal, selection against hybrid individuals, or both. Our fine-scale population genetic analysis suggests gene flow is limited but not completely obstructed by extreme topography such as glacial valleys, as well as streams including the Colorado River. The discovery of two subspecies within this single protected area has implications for monitoring and management, particularly in the light of recent analyses suggesting that the pikas in this park are vulnerable to fragmentation and local extinction under future projected climates. Future research should focus on the fitness consequences of introgression among distinct genetic lineages in this location and elsewhere, as well as within the context of genetic rescue as a conservation and management strategy for a climate sensitive species."

https://openalex.org/W2848102562,"Anticoagulation decreases a patient's risk of ischemic stroke and increases the risk of hemorrhage. Decision analyses regarding anticoagulation therefore require that different outcomes be weighted in comparison to one another. Most decision analyses to date have weighted intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) as 1.5 times worse than ischemic stroke, but because death and disability have lifelong impact, the expected impact should vary by life expectancy. Therefore, a fixed weighting ratio leads to age-related bias decision analyses of anticoagulation. We aimed to quantify the relative impact of ICH and ischemic stroke and derive a ratio that allows decision analysis without microsimulation.We created a microsimulation model to predict QALYs lost due to ICH and ischemic stroke. We then applied a meta-model to predict the ratio of QALYs lost from ICH relative to ischemic stroke.Previously-used weighting ratios (1.5) are close to our derived mean weighting ratio (1.60). However, the weighting ratio of QALYs lost from ICH relative to ischemic stroke is sensitive to age and discount rate. Patients at younger ages have higher mean weighting ratios, as do patients with higher discount rates.The ratio of QALYs lost to ICH relative to ischemic stroke varies with age and discount rate. We present a set of such ratios here for use in decision analyses that do not incorporate full microsimulation models. Use of weighting ratios that vary with age, rather than the current fixed ratios, has the potential to reduce age-based bias in decision-making regarding events with lifelong implications. In this case, use of dynamic ratios may change anticoagulation recommendations for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation at relatively low stroke risk."

There are three pre-cloacal and six post-cloacal male genital papillae with the arrangement P1, P2, P3, (C, P4), P5, P6d, P7, P8, P9d, Ph. This new species was easily differentiated from other members of the genus by DNA sequences of partial small subunit rRNA gene (SSU) and the D2-D3 expansion segments of the large subunit rRNA gene (LSU). Phylogenetic analysis also corroborated its reasonable placement within a well-supported monophyletic clade with other Parasitodiplogaster species and within the australis-group that includes P. australis and P. salicifoliae that are all associates of fig wasp pollinators (Platyscapa sp.) of figs of the subsection Urostigma."
https://openalex.org/W2851551955,"We aimed to determine the usefulness of the frequency-volume chart over the International Prostate Symptom Score in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Furthermore, we investigated the clinical characteristics suggesting that patients could benefit from frequency-volume chart assessment in addition to International Prostate Symptom Score assessment.A total of 193 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia were analyzed. The relationship between the information obtained from the frequency-volume chart and the International Prostate Symptom Score was assessed. Because the urine output per kilogram per hour was not associated with any question in the International Prostate Symptom Score questionnaire, patients were divided into 2 groups according to the presence of global polyuria, defined as urine output >40 mL·kg-1·h-1. Multivariable analysis was performed to determine the predictors of global polyuria, and the results were externally validated using 397 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia.Although the other information obtained from the frequency-volume chart correlated with the International Prostate Symptom Score, the urine output was not associated with the International Prostate Symptom Score. Based on these results, patients were dichotomized into the global polyuria group (n = 19, 9.8%) and the non-global polyuria group. Although the patient characteristics did not differ between the 2 groups, the number of voids was higher in patients with global polyuria. Multivariable analysis showed that diabetes mellitus (odds ratio: 3.497, p = 0.039) and increased number of voids (odds ratio: 1.320, p < 0.001) were significant predictors of global polyuria. On external validation, the area under curve for the model was 0.723.Global polyuria cannot be suspected using the International Prostate Symptom Score, although it worsens the lower urinary tract symptoms of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Assessment with the frequency-volume chart needs to be considered in diabetic patients with increased number of voids."
