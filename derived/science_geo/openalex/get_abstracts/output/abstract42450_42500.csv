https://openalex.org/W2047554700,"The chicken immunoglobulin light chain repertoire has been shown to be entirely derived from a single V lambda 1-J rearranged combination. The complete coding information of the lambda locus was determined: it comprises 25 V-hybridizing elements, all of which are pseudogenes, clustered in both orientations within 19 kb of DNA, starting 2.4 kb upstream of the V lambda 1 gene. Sequences of somatically rearranged V lambda 1 genes from embryonic and posthatching bursal cells show that diversification of light chain sequences occurs during ontogeny by a segmental gene conversion mechanism which takes place at a frequency of 0.05-0.1 per cell generation between the pseudogene pool and the unique rearranged functional V gene."

https://openalex.org/W2012939559,"Pseudomonas exotoxin A is a single chain toxin with three structural domains that inhibits protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells by catalyzing ADP ribosylation of elongation factor 2. To study the function of these domains, we deleted different portions of the PE structural gene and expressed these constructs in E. coli using an inducible T7 promoter. These studies indicate that structural domain la is required for cell recognition, that structural domain ll is required to translocate the toxin across a cellular membrane, and that structural domain III and a portion of domain lb are required for ADP ribosylation activity. Toxin lacking domain la is about 100-fold less toxic to mice than intact PE and should be a useful molecule for the construction of immunotoxins."
https://openalex.org/W2009077522,"The regional distributions of monoamine oxidase (MAO) types A and B have been identified in human brain in vivo with intravenously injected 11C-labeled suicide enzyme inactivators, clorgyline and L-deprenyl, and positron emission tomography. The rapid brain uptake and retention of radioactivity for both 11C tracers indicated irreversible trapping. The anatomical distribution of 11C paralleled the distribution of MAO A and MAO B in human brain in autopsy material. The corpus striatum, thalamus, and brainstem contained high MAO activity. The magnitudes of uptake of both [11C]clorgyline and L-[11C]deprenyl were markedly reduced in one subject treated with the antidepressant MAO inhibitor phenelzine. A comparison of the brain uptake and retention of the 11C-labeled inactive (D-) and active (L-) enantiomers of deprenyl showed rapid clearance of the inactive enantiomer and retention of the active enantiomer within MAO B-rich brain structures, in agreement with the known stereoselectivity of MAO B for L-deprenyl. Prior treatment with unlabeled L-deprenyl prevented retention of L-[11C]deprenyl. Thus, suicide enzyme inactivators labeled with positron emitters can be used to quantitate the distribution and kinetic characteristics of MAO in human brain structures."
https://openalex.org/W2168956456,"Previous studies have shown that the chicken lambda immunoglobulin light chain gene undergoes a single rearrangement that results in functional VJ joining of the unique variable (V lambda 1) and joining (J lambda) coding regions. The immunologic repertoire of lambda genes is created through extensive sequence diversification within the rearranged locus during B cell development in the bursa of Fabricius. This sequence diversification was detected only at the rearranged V lambda 1 segment and not within the 5' leader sequence, the J lambda segment, or the unrearranged V lambda 1 segment. The selective diversification of the rearranged V lambda 1 segment was associated with unique DNAase I-hypersensitive sites on the rearranged allele. While probes for V lambda 1 sequences detect multiple homologous V lambda segments, probes for both the 5' leader and J lambda segments fail to detect homologous sequences. Taken together, these results suggest that a highly selective process, possibly gene conversion, operates during B cell ontogeny to generate diversity within the lambda gene."

https://openalex.org/W2061798913,"The hypogonadal (hpg) mouse lacks a complete gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) gene and consequently cannot reproduce. Introduction of an intact GnRH gene into the genome of these mutant mice resulted in complete reversal of the hypogonadal phenotype. Transgenic hpg/hpg homozygotes of both sexes were capable of mating and producing offspring. Pituitary and serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and prolactin were restored to those of normal animals. Immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization showed that GnRH expression was restored in the appropriate hypothalamic neurons of the transgenic hpg animals, an indication of neural-specific expression of the introduced gene."
https://openalex.org/W2015886184,"We report here on a comparison of plasmacytoma cell lines that differ markedly in their ability to express κ immunoglobulin genes introduced by transfection, but nevertheless express their endogenous κ genes at comparable levels. The cell line that fails to express exogenous κ genes is nonpermissive for κ enhancer function, apparently because it lacks a specific κ enhancer-binding nuclear factor (NF-κB). We show that this same nuclear factor is also lacking in pre-B cells and that treatment of these cells with bacterial lipopolysaccharide induces the appearance of NF-κB in nuclear extracts and concomitantly activates the κ enhancer. These findings indicate that factor NF-κB controls κ enhancer activity, and that this activity is only transiently required during B cell maturation."

https://openalex.org/W1494464010,"Lipoxin A (LXA) was prepared by incubation of either (15S)-15-hydroxy-5,8,11-cis-13-trans-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) or (15S)-15-hydroperoxy-5,8,11-cis-13-trans-eicosatetraenoic (15-HPETE) with human leukocytes stimulated by either the ionophore A23187 or the chemotactic peptide fMet-Leu-Phe. Comparison with four trihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids prepared by total synthesis showed that biologically derived LXA is 5S,6R,15S)-5,6,15-trihydroxy-7,9,13-trans-11-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid. Three isomers of LXA were also identified in extracts of leukocytes utilizing an improved isolation procedure. These were (5S,6S,15S)-5,6,15-trihydroxy-7,9,13-trans-11-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid (6S-LXA), (5S,6R,15S)-5,6,15-trihydroxy-7,9,11,13-trans-eicosatetraenoic acid (11-trans-LXA), and (5S,6S,15S)-5,6,15-trihydroxy-7,9,11,13-trans-eicosatetraenoic acid (6S-11-trans-LXA). 18O2-labeling studies indicated that formation of LXA and its isomers occurred with incorporation of 18O at their C-5 but not C-6 positions. These results suggest that 15-hydroxy-5,6-epoxy-7,9,13-trans-11-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid or its equivalent may serve as one intermediate in the biosynthesis of LXA and 6S-LXA. When added to guinea pig lung strips LXA provoked contractions which were slow in onset and long lasting. In addition, dose response studies showed that biologically derived LXA and synthetic LXA were indistinguishable in this bioassay whereas synthetic 6S-LXA and biologically derived 6S-LXA did not share this activity. Taken together, these results suggest that activated leukocytes utilize exogenous 15-HETE to generate lipoxins which in turn can modulate cellular responses."
https://openalex.org/W1602877814,"To identify the role of a specific apoprotein other than apoE which might be responsible for the receptor-mediated uptake of high density lipoprotein (HDL) by rat hepatocytes, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) was combined with rat apoE, apoA-I, or apoA-IV to form apoprotein-phospholipid complexes and the complexes were tested for their binding and uptake by primary rat hepatocytes. Apoprotein-POPC complexes were labeled with the specific fluorescent probe, 1,1-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine to monitor their uptake by cultured rat hepatocytes at 37 degrees C using digital fluorescence imaging microscopy or were labeled with 125I to study their binding to hepatocytes at 4 degrees C. POPC, either alone or with apoA-I, was not internalized by rat hepatocytes while complexes containing apoE or apoA-IV were taken up by the cells. Specific binding at 4 degrees C was demonstrated for apoE-free HDL, apoA-IV X POPC, and apoE X POPC but not for apoA-I X POPC. The binding of apoE-free HDL was inhibited by apoA-IV X POPC, apoE-free HDL, and apoA-IV + apoA-I X POPC but not by apoA-I X POPC. Binding of apoA-IV X POPC was inhibited by apoE-free HDL, apoA-IV X POPC, and apoA-IV + apoA-I X POPC, but not by apoE X POPC or apoE-enriched HDL. These data indicate that apoA-IV is a ligand responsible for the rat HDL binding to primary rat hepatocytes and that apoA-IV binds to a receptor site distinct from apoE-dependent receptors such as the apoB,E or chylomicron-remnant receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2056288782,"Transgenic mice carrying the gamma 2-crystallin promoter fused to the coding region of the bacterial lacZ gene were generated. The offspring of three founder mice expressed high levels of the enzyme solely in the central nuclear fiber cells of the lens as measured by an in situ assay for the detection of beta-galactosidase activity. These results suggest that gamma 2-crystallin sequences between -759 to +45 contain essential information required for appropriate tissue-specific and temporal regulation of the mouse gamma 2-crystallin gene. In a broader context, this study also demonstrates the utility of beta-galactosidase hybrid gene constructs for monitoring the activity of gene regulatory elements in transgenic mice."
https://openalex.org/W1577828799,"Quantitative evaluation of transcriptional rates in isolated nuclei and intranuclear and cytoplasmic mRNA levels demonstrates that the catatoxic steroids pregnenolone-16 alpha-carbonitrile (PCN) and dexamethasone modulate microsomal drug metabolizing enzymes both positively and negatively at the transcriptional level. Additionally, a strong post-transcriptional influence, believed to be message stabilization, was found to be exerted by dexamethasone. Both NADPH-cytochrome P-450b-homologous mRNA are induced 7- and 12-fold, respectively, presumably through message stabilization. Under these conditions, however, the oxidoreductase content of the cell is only marginally increased while the cytochrome P-450b level is actually decreased by 40% within three days after a single injection of dexamethasone. In contrast, genes coding for cytochromes P-450PCN show a definite increase in transcription following administration of either pre gnenolone-16 alpha-carbonitrile or dexamethasone, whereas transcription of the epoxide hydrolase gene is markedly reduced by administration of these compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2073304701,The transformer (tra) gene regulates all aspects of somatic sexual differentiation in Drosophila melanogaster females and has no function in males. We have isolated the tra gene as part of a 200 kb chromosomal walk. The 25 kb region around tra contains four genetically identified complementation groups and at least six transcriptional units. Germ-line transformation experiments indicate that a fragment of 2 kb is sufficient to supply tra+ function. Mapping of cDNAs from tra and from the adjacent genes indicates that the tra+ transcription unit is 1.2 kb or less. This transcription unit gives rise to a 1.0 kb RNA that is female-specific and a 1.2 kb RNA that is present in both sexes. tra+ and the gene at the 3′ side overlap slightly in the 3′ ends of their RNA coding sequences. These results suggest that tra+ function is regulated at the level of production of the female-specific tra RNA. The fact that a tra transcript is found in males raises interesting possibilities for how tra expression is controlled.

https://openalex.org/W1978182808,"The suppression of the c-myc nuclear oncogene is associated with growth arrest and may therefore be directly controlled by naturally occurring growth inhibitors. The effect of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) on c-myc expression was investigated in HeLa cells, which respond to these cytokines by a specific arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Northern blot and nuclear transcription analyses indicated that each cytokine reduced within 1 to 3 hours the c-myc messenger RNA levels as a result of transcriptional inhibition. Adding the two cytokines together at saturating levels resulted in enhanced inhibition of c-myc transcription and of the c-myc messenger RNA steady-state levels. While the reduction of c-myc messenger RNA by IFN-γ was dependent on new protein synthesis, the inhibitory effect of TNF on c-myc messenger RNA was direct and was not abrogated by cycloheximide. The differential effect of the protein synthesis inhibitor and the cooperative inhibitory effects of the two cytokines when added together suggest that IFN-γ and TNF reduce c-myc transcription through different molecular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1495467917,"A low Mr form (Mr 32,000) of single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (scu-PA) was isolated from conditioned culture medium of a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line, CALU-3 (ATCC, HTB-55). The purified material (scu-PA-32k) consists of a single polypeptide chain and is immunologically similar to Mr 33,000 urokinase. Its NH2-terminal sequence is identical to that beginning at Leu-144 of Mr 54,000 urokinase. Whereas low Mr urokinase is derived from mature Mr 54,000 scu-PA by limited hydrolysis by plasmin first of the Lys-158-Ile-159 peptide bond and then of the Lys-136-Lys-137, scu-PA-32k is generated by specific hydrolysis of the Glu-143-Leu-144 peptide bond by an unidentified protease. scu-PA-32k resembles its Mr 54,000 scu-PA counterpart by its very low activity on chromogenic substrates for urokinase, by plasminogen-dependent fibrinolytic activity on fibrin plates, and by the lack of specific binding to fibrin. It activates plasminogen directly with high affinity, Km = 0.9 microM, but low turnover number, kcat = 0.0028 s-1. It is converted to fully active two-chain urokinase by plasmin with Km = 12 microM and kcat = 0.3 s-1. Like Mr 54,000 scu-PA, it causes significant lysis of a 125I-labeled fibrin clot in human plasma with relatively less fibrinogen breakdown as compared to urokinase. scu-PA-32k, which also has conserved fibrin specificity, represents a molecular variant which may be more suitable for large scale production as a fibrin-specific thrombolytic agent by recombinant DNA technology."

It consists of 1431 base pairs specifying a protein of 477 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence was consistent with the amino acid analysis obtained with the pure protein as well as with the molecular weight as determined from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The deduced amino acid sequence was also consistent with the amino-terminal acid sequence and amino acid sequence analysis of various peptides obtained from CNBr degradation of purified glycogen synthase."
https://openalex.org/W2131418884,"Intact neutrophils exhibit interconverting active and inactive receptor states with half-times for dissociation of 10 s and 2 min, respectively. We examined the effect of guanine nucleotides on ligand-receptor dynamics at 37 degrees C in neutrophils permeabilized with digitonin using continuous fluorometric measurements. The permeabilized cells exhibit a single class of slowly dissociating receptors with a half-time similar to the inactive state. The slowly dissociating state is lengthened in the presence of 10 mM by Mg2+ about two-fold but is relatively insensitive to substitutions of Na+ or K+. When guanine nucleotide is added the receptors dissociate uniformly with a half-time similar to the active state but are sensitive to the substitution of Na+ or K+ (K+ or K+/Mg2+ approximately 10 s; Na+ or Na+/Mg2+ approximately 4 s). When receptors in permeabilized cells are ADP-ribosylated with pertussis toxin the rapidly dissociating state is detected. In the presence of nonsaturating nucleotide or incomplete ribosylation, complex rates of ligand dissociation intermediate between the active and inactive forms are observed. Micromolar concentrations of Ca2+ block the effect of guanine nucleotide on the receptor. The relationships between ligand-receptor dynamics in intact neutrophils and interconverting states regulated by guanine nucleotides and ions in permeabilized cells are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1516450391,"Formylmethanofuran: tetrahydromethanopterin formyltransferase was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from cells of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum. The enzyme is a tetramer of similar or identical subunits (Mr = 41,000). The equilibrium favors transfer of the formyl group to tetrahydromethanopterin (H4MPT) at physiological pH. The product of formyl transfer by the purified enzyme was shown by a number of criteria to be 5-formyl-H4MPT, as opposed to 10-formyl-H4MPT or 5,10-methenyl-H4MPT. Reconstitution of a portion of the methanogenic C1 cycle was effected by combining purified formyltransferase, methenyl-H4MPT cyclohydrolase, formylmethanofuran, and H4MPT to give methenyl-H4MPT. Additional reconstitution experiments established that the formyltransferase is an essential enzyme for the conversion of carbon dioxide to methane. In conjunction with previously published data (Donnelly, M.I., Escalante-Semerena, J.C., Rinehart, K. L., Jr., and Wolfe, R.S. (1985) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 242, 430-439), these data substantiate the role of 5-formyl-H4MPT as an intermediate of methanogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1557332392,"The mechanism of the association of human plasma apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) with the acidic phospholipids, dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG), egg yolk phosphatidylglycerol, and dioleoylphosphatidylserine as well as with the zwitterionic dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) has been studied using turbidimetry, circular dichroism, high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry, and electron microscopy. The association of apo A-I with multilamellar liposomes of acidic phospholipids is rapid over a broad temperature range at and above the temperature of the lipid gel to liquid crystalline transition, Tc. This is in contrast to zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine which recombines with apo A-I only over a narrow temperature range around Tc. The complex of apo A-I with DMPC denatures at elevated temperatures giving rise to a calorimetrically detectable transition. The temperature range and width of this transition is shown to be markedly dependent on the heating rate. This is again in contrast to apo A-I recombinants with DMPG which show no calorimetrically detectable thermal denaturation, at least in a temperature range up to 100 degrees C. Also circular dichroism data indicate high resistance of apo A-I to thermal unfolding in the presence of DMPG. It is concluded that the complexes of apo A-I with DMPC are thermodynamically stable only at temperatures near Tc, whereas above and below this temperature range the stability of these recombinants is determined by kinetic factors. In contrast, complexes of apo A-I with DMPG and other acidic phospholipids may be thermodynamically stable over a wide temperature range greater than or equal to Tc. In spite of these fundamental differences between zwitterionic and acidic phospholipids in their mode of association with apo A-I, the binding affinity and the morphology of the recombinants are similar. Both apo A-I X DMPC and apo A-I X DMPG complexes form lipoprotein particles having a discoidal shape."
https://openalex.org/W1488640901,"The gal operon regulatory region contains two overlapping promoters, P1 and P2, regulated by cyclic AMP and the cyclic AMP receptor protein (cAMP X CRP). Starting with a mutation that eliminated P1, the promoter that is usually dependent on cAMP X CRP, we constructed a series of deletions that substituted increasing amounts of DNA sequence from upstream of P2, the promoter that usually functions in the absence of cAMP X CRP. Expression from P2 in vivo was halved by deletions that replace the -35 region with unrelated sequences, showing that the -35 sequence participates in promoter function, but is not essential. In vitro studies show that replacement of the -35 sequence increases the time for open complex formation at P2, but does not alter the transcription start point. We examined the effects of the same deletions at the wild type gal promoter region: again, the deletion that replaces the -35 region halves expression in vivo. However, in this case, in the absence of cAMP X CRP, the deletion switches expression from the P2 promoter to P1, the promoter that is usually dependent on cAMP X CRP. Moreover, although the deletion also removes the specific cAMP X CRP binding site, this P1 activity is sharply inhibited in a crp+ background. We argue that this is due to a direct contact between CRP and RNA polymerase bound at the P1 Pribnow box, and we discuss the role of the -35 sequence at these and other promoters."
https://openalex.org/W1531657315,"In the presence of citrulline synthesis, we made the following observations. External ornithine is channeled between its transporter and ornithine transcarbamylase; mitochondria preloaded with cold ornithine, then incubated with [3H]ornithine, produced citrulline of the same specific radioactivity as that of external ornithine, while matrix ornithine remained essentially unlabeled. The channeling of ornithine suggests that some soluble enzymes are organized within the mitochondrial matrix. The rate of ornithine transport can be greater than 80 nmol/min/mg. At rates of carbamyl phosphate synthesis of 10-50 nmol/min/mg, the rate of citrulline synthesis is controlled by external ornithine in the range 0.03-0.2 mM; at greater than or equal to 0.2 mM ornithine, transport is not limiting for citrulline synthesis. At external ornithine concentrations less than or equal to 1 mM, i.e. within the physiological range, this amino acid is undetectable in the matrix. Given the rates of citrulline and urea synthesis which occur in vivo and the concentrations of ornithine present in the liver, our findings indicate that ornithine may contribute to the physiological regulation of urea synthesis. Preliminary reports of parts of this work have been published (Raijman, L., Cheung, C-W., and Cohen, N. S. (1984) Fed. Proc. 43, 1831; Cohen, N. S., Cheung, C-W., and Raijman, L. (1986) Fed. Proc. 45, 2677)."
https://openalex.org/W1533096885,"The B16/C3 murine melanoma is a pigmented tumor that is rich in the copper-containing enzyme, tyrosinase. This enzyme, which converts tyrosine to melanin precursors, is largely associated with membrane fractions of cells and exists in a number of discrete isozymic forms ranging in molecular mass from 58,000 to 150,000 daltons and pI from 3.4 to 5.2. One of these isozymes (Mr = 58,000, pI 3.4) has been purified to homogeneity. The purified enzyme catalyzes the hydroxylation of L-tyrosine to L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) and the conversion of L-DOPA to dopaquinone. Ascorbic acid, tetrahydrofolate, and dopamine can serve as cofactors in the hydroxylase reaction. The Michaelis constants for the purified enzyme were 7 X 10(-4) M for L-tyrosine and 6 X 10(-4) M for L-DOPA. The Vmax for L-DOPA was much greater than the Vmax for L-tyrosine indicating that tyrosine hydroxylation is rate-limiting in melanin precursor biosynthesis. Two putative copper chelators, phenylthiourea and diethyldithiocarbamide inhibited both the tyrosine hydroxylase and L-DOPA oxidase activities of the enzyme. Phenylthiourea was a noncompetitive inhibitor while diethyldithiocarbamide was a competitive inhibitor indicating that these agents act by different mechanisms. When digested with proteases and glycosidases, higher molecular weight forms of tyrosinase co-migrated with the purified enzyme in isoelectric focusing and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis suggesting that the isozyme was derived from larger precursors. Thus, post-translational processing of tyrosinase may underlie isozyme diversity and this may be important in the control of melanogenesis in this tumor model."
https://openalex.org/W2021979809,"Two major protective antigens of Rickettsia rickettsii have been previously described. In this study, we cloned the gene encoding one of these antigens into Escherichia coli and tested the effectiveness of the recombinant-made product as a vaccine for Rocky Mountain spotted fever. A clone bank of R strain R. rickettsii DNA was made in E. coli K-12 by using the plasmid vector pBR322. Transformants were screened for their ability to make rickettsial antigens by reactivity with rabbit antibodies to R. rickettsii. One of the transformants, EM24(pGAM21), made a product reactive with two monoclonal antibodies that recognize a 155-kilodalton protein of R. rickettsii. One of the monoclonal antibodies was a member of a class of antibodies that react to heat-sensitive epitopes and protect mice injected with a potentially lethal dose of viable R. rickettsii. The cloned product contained this protective heat-sensitive epitope. In order to obtain enhanced expression, the gene was subcloned downstream of the lactose promoter on the plasmid vector pUC8. A sonic lysate of E. coli harboring the pUC8 subclone was used successfully as a vaccine to protect mice injected with a lethal dose of the viable R. rickettsii."
https://openalex.org/W1595129017,"The role(s) of ascorbic acid in dopamine beta-hydroxylation was studied in primary cultures of bovine adrenomedullary chromaffin cells and in isolated bovine adrenomedullary chromaffin vesicles. Dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity was assessed by measuring the rate of conversion of tyramine to octopamine. The ascorbic acid content of chromaffin cells declined with time in culture and the dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity of ascorbate-depleted cells was low. Ascorbate additions to ascorbate-depleted cells increased both the intracellular ascorbate concentrations and the rates of dopamine beta-hydroxylation. Ascorbate uptake into the cells was rapid; however, the onset of enhanced octopamine synthesis by added ascorbate was delayed by several hours and closely followed the time course for accumulation of the newly taken up ascorbate into the chromaffin vesicle. The amount of octopamine synthesized by the chromaffin cells exceeded the intracellular ascorbate content and ascorbate levels were maintained during dopamine beta-hydroxylation in the absence of external ascorbate. This suggests an efficient recycling of ascorbate. In contrast to intact cells, ascorbic acid was depleted during octopamine synthesis in isolated chromaffin vesicles. The molar ratio of octopamine formed to ascorbate depleted was close to unity. Thus, the recycling of intravesicular ascorbate depends on an extravesicular factor(s). The depletion of intravesicular ascorbate during dopamine beta-hydroxylation was prevented by the addition of nonpermeant extravesicular electron donors such as ascorbate or glucoascorbate. This suggests that intravesicular ascorbate is maintained in the reduced state by electron transport across the vesicle membrane. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that both intra- and extravesicular ascorbate participate in the regulation of dopamine beta-hydroxylase. Intravesicular ascorbate is the cofactor for the enzyme. Cytosolic ascorbate is most likely the electron donor for the vesicle-membrane electron transport system which maintains the intravesicular cofactor concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2084897044,"Vinculin, which is associated with the cytoskeleton of many cells, has been suggested as a possible linker between microfilament bundles and the plasma membrane. Here it will be shown that fatty acid is covalently attached to vinculin in vivo. Furthermore, in chicken embryo fibroblasts infected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus, tsNY68, the acylation of vinculin at the permissive temperature was less than one-third that at the nonpermissive temperature. Thus, the covalent binding of lipid to vinculin is a transformation-sensitive event. The covalent modification of vinculin by lipids could be directly or indirectly involved in its reversible association with membranes. This modification may also provide a mechanism to alter the organization of vinculin within cells and thereby play a regulatory role in anchoring or stabilizing microfilament bundles at plasma membranes."
https://openalex.org/W274720317,"Sodium-dependent beta-alanine uptake into dog renal brush-border membrane vesicles was studied. Kinetic analysis indicated a single transport system, highly specific for beta-amino acids, with Km = 35 microM at 100 mM NaCl. Sodium-dependent beta-alanine transport was markedly anion-dependent, being highest in the presence of chloride (Cl greater than Br greater than SCN greater than NO3 approximately I greater than F) and virtually nonexistent in the presence of gluconate and other nonphysiological chloride substitutes. In addition, it was observed that beta-alanine uptake could be driven against a concentration gradient by a chloride gradient. Similar results were found for sodium. Taken together, these observations provide strong evidence that beta-alanine transport across the renal brush-border membrane is coupled to both sodium and chloride. Studies of the dependence of beta-alanine flux on chloride and sodium concentrations indicated that one chloride ion and multiple sodium ions were involved in the beta-alanine transport event. beta-Alanine flux on chloride found to involve the net transfer of positive charge, consistent with these stoichiometric assignments. The hallucinogen harmaline inhibited beta-alanine uptake in a 1:1 fashion, presumably by acting at a single site on the transport molecule. The ability of harmaline to inhibit beta-alanine uptake was decreased when the chloride concentration was lowered but was unchanged when the sodium concentration was decreased. These results indicate that harmaline does not compete with sodium for a binding site on the carrier as has been suggested for other sodium-coupled transport systems, and that instead, chloride may be required for harmaline binding to the beta-alanine transporter."
https://openalex.org/W2034395629,"Thyroid hormones stimulate the rate of cell division by poorly understood mechanisms. The possibility that thyroid hormones increase cell growth by stimulating secretion of a growth factor was investigated. Thyroid hormones are nearly an absolute requirement for the division of GH4C1 rat pituitary tumor cells plated at low density. Conditioned media from cells grown with or without L-triiodothyronine (T3) were treated with an ion exchange resin to remove T3 and were tested for ability to stimulate the division of GH4C1 cells. Conditioned medium from T3-treated cells was as active as thyroid hormone at promoting GH4C1 cell growth but did not elicit other thyroid hormone responses, induction of growth hormone, and down-regulation of thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptors, as effectively as T3 did. A substance or substances associated with T3-induced growth stimulatory activity migrated at high molecular weight at neutral pH and was different from known growth-promoting hormones induced by T3. The results demonstrate that thyroid hormones stimulate the division of GH4C1 pituitary cells by stimulating the secretion of an autocrine growth factor."
https://openalex.org/W1548017735,"Recent results show that type IX collagen isolated from chicken cartilage is associated with one or perhaps two chondroitin sulfate chains. To locate the chondroitin sulfate chain(s) along the type IX collagen molecule, rotary shadowing was performed in the presence of monoclonal antibodies which recognize stubs of chondroitin sulfate generated after chondroitinase ABC digestion. Monoclonal antibodies 9-A-2 and 2-B-6 which recognize stubs of chondroitin 4-sulfate were found to bind specifically to the NC3 domain of type IX collagen, and this binding was dependent on prior digestion of the preparation with chondroitinase ABC. Monoclonal antibody 1-B-5, which recognizes unsulfated stubs of chondroitin sulfate, did not show any specific binding to type IX collagen either with or without chondroitinase ABC digestion. As a control, monoclonal antibody 2C2 was used, which in previous work was shown to bind specifically to an epitope located close to or at the NC2 domain. Binding of this antibody to NC2 was unaffected by chondroitinase ABC digestion, and no specific binding of the antibody to the NC3 domain was detected either before or after chondroitinase ABC digestion."
https://openalex.org/W1581813694,"Cytological studies have shown that the heat shock loci 93D of Drosophila melanogaster and 2-48B of Drosophila hydei have several characteristics which suggest that they are homologous loci, yet sequence homology is barely detectable by cross-hybridization. Using cloned DNA sequences we have compared the two loci. Both loci produce transcripts of similar size and number. We have characterized the three predominant transcripts. In each species all three transcripts start at or about the same place within the unique portion of the gene. The longest transcript (approximately 9-10 kilobases) continues through several kilobases of short tandem repeats. The two shorter (1.9 and 1.2 kilobases) transcripts terminate 5' to the repeats. The repeat sequences are strongly conserved within a species but between species they have diverged both in length and in sequence. The longest homology is 9 nucleotides. The unique portions have also diverged significantly but do have some regions of conserved sequence. In both species the cytoplasmic transcript is spliced and polyadenylated but does not appear to contain a significant open reading frame. Thus, although the sequence of this locus has diverged significantly there are conserved features which suggest that the function of the locus is also conserved."
https://openalex.org/W1601803715,"We have investigated the biosynthesis and cell surface expression of the major cell surface sialomucin (ascites sialoglycoprotein-1 (ASGP-1] of 13762 rat mammary ascites tumor cells by pulse or pulse-chase metabolic labeling combined with precipitation with peanut agglutinin and alkaline borohydride elimination or proteolytic fragmentation. The minimum time for initial glycosylation was estimated from the time required for the protein to acquire the ability to bind to peanut agglutinin to be less than 5 min. Moreover, when cells were labeled with threonine for 5 min and the ASGP-1 isolated by peanut agglutinin precipitation, 3% of the labeled threonine could be converted to 2-aminobutyric acid by alkaline borohydride elimination of the carbohydrate, indicating that at least 3% of the threonines of ASGP-1 are O-glycosylated within 5 min of polypeptide synthesis. The minimum time between the final glycosylation reactions in the cell and appearance of ASGP-1 at the cell surface was determined by trypsinizing galactose- or glucosamine-labeled cells at timed intervals after labeling to occur within 5-10 min of labeling. Both labeled glucosamine and galactosamine appeared in ASGP-1 fragments within 5 min, but the amount of labeled galactosamine was less than the amount of labeled glucosamine until after 20 min, when the 1:1 equilibrium ratio was reached. The half-time for appearance of glucosamine-labeled ASGP-1 at the cell surface was found to be greater than 4 h. The minimum time required from synthesis of the ASGP-1 polypeptide to appearance at the cell surface was determined by leucine labeling and proteolysis to be 70-80 min. These combined studies suggest a continuum of O-linked oligosaccharide initiation events extending over most of the period of ASGP-1 biosynthesis and transit from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1513785399,"Vanadate inactivated rat hepatocyte glycogen synthase and activated glycogen phosphorylase in a dose- and time-dependent manner. These effects were observed in hepatocytes from both fasted as well as fed rats. When rat hepatocytes were preincubated with [32P]phosphate and then with vanadate, and the 32P-labeled glycogen synthase was specifically immunoprecipitated, it was observed that vanadate stimulated the phosphorylation of the 88,000-dalton subunit of glycogen synthase. All of the phosphate was located in the same two CNBr fragments of the enzyme which are phosphorylated by glucagon and other glycogenolytic hormones. In cells incubated in a calcium-depleted medium, vanadate was still able to inactivate glycogen synthase but its effects on phosphorylase were essentially lost. These results demonstrate that, in the hepatocyte, vanadate exerts opposite effects than in the adipocyte and skeletal muscle, where vanadate has an insulin-like action."
https://openalex.org/W1536823408,"Glycogen synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme in glycogen biosynthesis, has been postulated to exist as isozymes in rabbit liver and muscle (Camici, M., Ahmad, Z., DePaoli-Roach, A. A., and Roach, P. J. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 2466-2473). Both isozymes share a number of properties including multiple phosphorylation of the enzyme subunit. In the present study, we determined the amino acid sequences surrounding phosphorylation sites in the rabbit liver isozyme recognized by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Two dominant phosphopeptides (P-1 and P-2) were generated from tryptic digestion. Amino acid sequences of the purified peptides were determined by automated Edman degradation using a gas-phase sequenator. The locations of phosphorylated residues were identified by measuring 32Pi release during Edman degradation cycles. The NH2-terminal sequence of peptide P-1 is S-L-S(P)-V-T-S-L-G-G-L-P-Q-W-E-V-E-E-L-P-V-D-D-L-L-L-P-E-V. This sequence exhibits a strong homology to the site 2 region in the NH2 terminus of the muscle isozyme. The NH2-terminal sequence of peptide P-2 is M-Y-P-R-P-S(P)-S(P)-V-P-P-S-P-L-G-S-Q-A. This sequence shows strong homology to the site 3 region in the COOH terminus of the muscle isozyme. However, some interesting sequence differences were revealed in this region. For example, substitution of serine for alanine at position 6 of peptide P-2 created a new phosphorylation site for cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Phosphorylation of the proline/serine-rich site 3 region correlated with inactivation of the liver isozyme and suggests an important role for this segment of the molecule in the regulation of glycogen synthase. No phosphorylation sites corresponding to sites 1a and 1b of the muscle isozyme were detected. In addition, the results provide definitive chemical proof that glycogen synthase from rabbit liver and muscle are isozymes encoded by distinct messages."
https://openalex.org/W1713628931,"Identity has been established between chicken hemopexin and alpha 1-globulin M, a plasma known for the hormone responsiveness of its synthesis in monolayer cultures of embryonic chicken hepatocytes (Grieninger, G., Plant, P. W., Liang, T. J., Kalb, R. G., Amrani, D., Mosesson, M. W., Hertzberg, K. M., and Pindyk, J. (1983) Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 408, 469-489). Identification was based on immunological cross-reactivity, electrophoretic behavior on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, heme-binding capacity, and pattern of cleavage by proteolytic enzymes. Electroimmunoassays were used to investigate plasma protein levels, particularly those of hemopexin, in the acute-phase response and embryonic development. Acute-phase plasma protein production, elicited by injection of chickens with turpentine, bore many similarities to the pattern of hepatocellular plasma protein synthesis produced in response to the addition of specific hormones in culture. The response of the stressed chickens included elevated levels of hemopexin and fibrinogen (5- and 2-fold, respectively) accompanied by a 50% drop in albumin. Hemopexin levels of developing chick embryos were measured for several days before and after hatching. Onset of hemopexin production occurred around the time of hatching, and was followed by a steep increase (more than 1000-fold over 4 days). Similarly, it was not until the 12th h of culture that hepatocytes isolated from both early and late stage chicken embryos began to produce hemopexin, although, from their initiation in culture, they secreted a number of other plasma proteins in quantity. After 12 h, hepatocellular output of hemopexin rapidly accelerated. This precocious induction ex vivo required no hormonal or macromolecular medium supplements. These observations indicate that the embryonic chicken hepatocyte culture system will provide a useful model for studying the regulation of hemopexin biosynthesis in hepatic development and the acute-phase response."
https://openalex.org/W1488249142,"Polyethylene glycol-bound derivatives of NAD(P) (PEG-NAD(P)) are water-soluble macromolecular coenzymes used in continuous enzyme reactors. These NAD(P) derivatives have good coenzyme activity for many dehydrogenases, but some enzymes such as glucose dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.47) show very low activity with these derivatives (less than 0.1% of that for native NAD(P)). In this work, we prepared a covalently linked glucose-dehydrogenase-polyethylene glycol-NAD conjugate (GlcDH-PEG-NAD) and found that the conjugate shows a much higher reaction rate than that of the native enzyme plus PEG-NAD: the ratio of the reaction rates of GlcDH-PEG-NAD and the native enzyme plus PEG-NAD is calculated to be 10,000-fold at the concentrations of the enzyme subunit and NAD moiety of 0.31 and 0.65 microM, respectively; the rate of the conjugate is even higher than that of the native enzyme plus native NAD. This rate acceleration is due to the increase in the effective concentration of NAD moiety (anchimeric assistance) and demonstrates the potential of covalent linking for improving the interaction between an enzyme and a coenzyme derivative."
https://openalex.org/W1480281160,"Rat liver mitochondria were incubated at 30 degrees C with 4 mM ATP in a medium similar in electrolyte composition to that of hepatic cytosol. Under these conditions, a net increase in mitochondrial adenine nucleotides was observed that was dependent on the concentration of free Ca2+ [( Ca2+]) in the incubation medium. At 0.2 microM [Ca2+] or less, there was no demonstrable uptake of adenine nucleotides; at 0.4 microM [Ca2+], or greater, net uptake occurred. The calcium-dependent accumulation of nucleotides by mitochondria required Mg2+ in the incubation medium and was insensitive to carboxyatractyloside. The uptake of adenine nucleotides was enhanced by the addition of antimycin A or antimycin A together with oligomycin. Accumulation of nucleotides appeared to be associated with a small increase in mean mitochondrial volume, but the membrane potential was not affected. No uptake or loss of NAD-NADH by mitochondria was detected. Ruthenium red failed to inhibit the calcium-dependent uptake of adenine nucleotides by the mitochondria, indicating that stimulation of this process by Ca2+ does not involve transport of the cation into mitochondria by the Ca2+ uniporter. Because glucagon acts to elevate cytosolic [Ca2+] from approximately 0.2 microM to 0.6 microM, the same range affecting nucleotide uptake, it is proposed that the increase in mitochondrial adenine nucleotides that follows treatment with glucagon is mediated by the rise in cytosolic [Ca2+] produced by the hormone. This hypothesis was supported by the observation that epinephrine and A23187, agents that raise cytosolic [Ca2+], increased the content of mitochondrial adenine nucleotides in isolated hepatocytes. Furthermore, cells, incubated under calcium-depleting conditions, had a diminished response to glucagon."

https://openalex.org/W1545547733,"The Bacillus subtilis RNA polymerase sigma 43 subunit and the phage SP82 encoded 28-kDa peptide are responsible for the binding of RNA polymerase to early and middle SP82 promoters, respectively. The delta peptide enhances the specificity of the interaction of B. subtilis RNA polymerase with these promoters. We have used sedimentation experiments to determine the effect of each of the three specificity factors, delta, sigma, and the 28-kDa peptide, on the binding of the other two factors to RNA polymerase core and the effect of NaCl on these binding equilibria. We show that sigma 43 and the 28-kDa peptide can each bind to RNA polymerase core at the same time as delta. Sigma 43 and the 28-kDa peptide have similar affinities to core at 0.1 M NaCl, but the 28-kDa peptide binds to core-delta more strongly than sigma 43. The implications of these findings with respect to the replacement of sigma 43 by the 28-kDa peptide and the mechanism of promoter search by B. subtilis RNA polymerase are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1482009873,"The collagen phenotype of a 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide-transformed line of Syrian hamster embryo fibroblasts, NQT-SHE, was markedly altered from that of normal Syrian hamster embryo cells, which synthesized mainly type I procollagen [pro-alpha 1(I)]2 pro-alpha 2(I). Total collagen synthesis in the transformant was reduced to about 30% of the control level primarily because synthesis of the pro-alpha 1(I) subunit was completely suppressed. The major collagenous products synthesized consisted of two polypeptides, designated as N-33 and N-50, which could be completely separated by precipitation with ammonium sulfate at 33 and 50% saturation, respectively. N-33 migrated similarly to pro-alpha 2(I) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and N-50 migrated slightly more slowly. The collagenous regions of these chains were more sensitive to protease than the analogous region of procollagen I, but alpha-chains could be obtained by digestion for 2 h at 4 degrees C with high ratios of protein:pepsin. Staphylococcus V8 protease and cyanogen bromide peptide maps of N-33 alpha and N-50 alpha chains indicated that the chains were homologous with, but different than, alpha 2(I) chains and that they differed from each other. Considering their similarity to pro-alpha 2(I), it was surprising to find that the N-collagens were secreted to the same extent as was type I procollagen from Syrian hamster embryo cells and that there were no disulfide bonds between N-collagen chains. Intrachain disulfides were present. One possible explanation for the unusual collagen phenotype of NQT-SHE cells is that transformation induced one or more mutations in the pro-alpha 2(I) structural gene while suppression of synthesis of the pro-alpha 1(I) subunit may be due to a mutation in the regulatory region of its gene or in a general regulatory gene."
https://openalex.org/W1483732202,"The enzyme rhodanese (thiosulfate sulfurtransferase; EC 2.8.1.1) is inactivated with a half-time of approximately 3 min when incubated with 50 mM NADH. NAD+, however, has virtually no effect on the activity. Inactivation can be prevented by the inclusion of the substrate thiosulfate. The concentration of thiosulfate giving half-protection is 0.038 mM. In addition, NADH, but not NAD+, is a competitive inhibitor with respect to thiosulfate in the catalyzed reaction (Ki = 8.3 mM). Fluorescence studies are consistent with a time-dependent oxidation of NADH in the presence of rhodanese. The sulfur-free form of rhodanese is more rapidly inactivated than the sulfur-containing form. Spectrophotometric titrations show that inactivation is accompanied by the loss of two free SH groups per enzyme molecule. Inactivation is prevented by the exclusion of air and the inclusion of EDTA (1 mM), and the enzyme activity can be largely protected by incubation with superoxide dismutase or catalase. Rhodanese, inactivated with NADH, can be reactivated by incubation with the substrate thiosulfate (75 mM) for 48 h or more rapidly, but only partially, by incubating with 180 mM dithiothreitol. It is concluded that, in the presence of rhodanese, NADH can be oxidized by molecular oxygen and produce intermediates of oxygen reduction, such as superoxide and/or hydrogen peroxide, that can inactivate the enzyme with consequent formation of an intraprotein disulfide. In addition, NADH, but not NAD+, can reversibly bind to the active site region in competition with thiosulfate. These data are of interest in view of x-ray studies that show structural similarities between rhodanese and nucleotide binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1514332688,"Abstract Secretory Protein I (SP-I) is an acidic glycoprotein that is stored and co-secreted with parathormone by parathyroid glands. It has been found to be chemically similar, if not identical, to chromogranin A of the adrenal medulla and to be present in most endocrine cells. In the present study, 35SO4 was shown to be incorporated into SP-I and several other proteins of porcine parathyroid tissue incubated in vitro. The predominant sulfated species secreted to the medium was SP-I. Up to 20% of the tyrosine residues in secreted SP-I were labeled with 35SO4. Both the cellular and secreted forms migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels as a pair of proteins with apparent molecular weights of 82,000 and 78,000. The 82-kDa protein could be converted to the 78-kDa species by treatment with neuraminidase. Sulfate exists in SP-I as tyrosine sulfate based on the identification of this amino acid by thin layer electrophoresis following alkaline hydrolysis. Extracellular Ca2+ (3 mM) greatly suppressed the secretion of 35SO4-labeled SP-I without affecting the intracellular sulfation of the molecule or the secretion of a minor sulfated protein unrelated to SP-I. The ratio of incorporated 35SO4 to 3H-amino-acid was greater in secreted SP-I than in tissue SP-I, suggesting that much sulfation of this protein occurred during or just before secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1504668584,"The binding of AMP to rabbit muscle glycogen phosphorylase a (EC 2.4.1.1.) has been studied by equilibrium dialysis and isothermal microcalorimetry at pH 6.9 over a temperature range of 25 degrees C to 35 degrees C. Thermal titration experiments were carried out in various buffer systems. We have found by these methods that a certain number of protons are released when the protein binds to the ligand and are taken up by the buffer. The tetramer of phosphorylase a has been shown to have four equal and independent, non-cooperative binding sites for AMP at 25 degrees C, 30 degrees C, and 35 degrees C; these sites can be assigned to the so-called nucleotide or, activator, sites in the protein. The binding constants together with the changes in Gibbs energy, enthalpy, and entropy per site for the AMP binding were calculated at each temperature. A negative delta Cp value of -2.3 +/- 0.2 J K-1 (AMP bound)-1 was obtained for this binding process. The hydrophobic and vibrational contributions of the heat capacity and entropy changes have been resolved by the method described by Sturtevant (Sturtevant, J. M. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 74, 2236-2240). From this analysis, it appears that the binding is, in all cases, enthalpy-driven, the two entropic contributions, hydrophobic and vibrational, having opposing effects."

The inactivation curve showed well the inactivation of two independent Mn-binding sites of different sizes: about two-thirds of the Mn coordinated to a binding site of 65 kDa, and the rest bound to a much smaller site of only about 3 kDa. In the large site, there was about 1 g atom of Mn/110 mol of chlorophyll in spinach thylakoids, which was constant in normally grown plants, although the Mn level in the small site depended on culture conditions. Thylakoids that had been incubated with hydroxylamine or in 0.8 M Tris lost Mn exclusively from the large binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1513629859,"The isolation of malonyl-coenzyme A synthetase from Pseudomonas fluorescens grown on malonate has been reported recently (Kim, Y.S., and Bang, S.K. (1985) J. Biol.Chem. 260, 5098-5104). This enzyme is phosphorylated in the presence of ATP and Mg2+. The phosphoryl group appears on one subunit of the enzyme composed of two different subunits, and the phosphoryl enzyme is acid labile and base stable. The phosphoryl group on the enzyme is released by the incubation of the phosphoryl enzyme with malonate and malonyl enzyme is formed. The malonyl enzyme is acid labile and also relatively unstable under basic conditions. The malonyl group is found on the subunit of the enzyme which is phosphorylated. Malonyl-CoA is formed when malonyl enzyme reacts with coenzyme A. These results suggest that two convalent intermediates, phosphoryl and malonyl enzyme, are sequentially formed in the synthesis of malonyl-coenzyme A by malonyl-coenzyme A synthetase catalysis."
