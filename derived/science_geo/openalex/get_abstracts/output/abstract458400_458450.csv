https://openalex.org/W2014164931,"Scaffolding molecules at the postsynaptic membrane form the foundation of excitatory synaptic transmission by establishing the architecture of the postsynaptic density (PSD), but the small size of the synapse has precluded measurement of PSD organization in live cells. We measured the internal structure of the PSD in live neurons at approximately 25 nm resolution using photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM). We found that four major PSD scaffold proteins were each organized in distinctive ∼80 nm ensembles able to undergo striking changes over time. Bidirectional PALM and single-molecule immunolabeling showed that dense nanodomains of PSD-95 were preferentially enriched in AMPA receptors more than NMDA receptors. Chronic suppression of activity triggered changes in PSD interior architecture that may help amplify synaptic plasticity. The observed clustered architecture of the PSD controlled the amplitude and variance of simulated postsynaptic currents, suggesting several ways in which PSD interior organization may regulate the strength and plasticity of neurotransmission."
https://openalex.org/W2090120488,"Background Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a common herpesvirus linked to infectious mononucleosis and multiple cancers. There are no national estimates of EBV seroprevalence in the United States. Our objective was to estimate the overall prevalence and sociodemographic predictors of EBV among U.S. children and adolescents aged 6–19. Methods We calculated prevalence estimates and prevalence ratios for EBV seroprevalence using data from the 2003–2010 U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for children aged 6–19 (n = 8417). Poisson regression was used to calculate multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratios across subgroup categories (sex, race/ethnicity, parental education, household income, household size, foreign-born, BMI, and household smoking). Findings Overall EBV seroprevalence was 66.5% (95% CI 64.3%–68.7%.). Seroprevalence increased with age, ranging from 54.1% (95% CI 50.2%–57.9%) for 6–8 year olds to 82.9% (95% CI 80.0%–85.9%) for 18–19 year olds. Females had slightly higher seroprevalence (68.9%, 95% CI 66.3%–71.6%) compared to males (64.2%, 95% CI 61.7%–66.8%). Seroprevalence was substantially higher for Mexican-Americans (85.4%, 95% CI 83.1%–87.8%) and Non-Hispanic Blacks (83.1%, 95% CI 81.1%–85.1%) than Non-Hispanic Whites (56.9%, 95% CI 54.1%–59.8%). Large differences were also seen by family income, with children in the lowest income quartile having 81.0% (95% CI 77.6%–84.5%) seroprevalence compared to 53.9% (95% CI 50.5%–57.3%) in the highest income quartile, with similar results for parental education level. These results were not explained by household size, BMI, or parental smoking. Among those who were seropositive, EBV antibody titers were significantly higher for females, Non-Hispanic Blacks and Mexican-Americans, with no association found for socioeconomic factors. Conclusions In the first nationally representative U.S. estimates, we found substantial socioeconomic and race/ethnic differences in the seroprevalence of EBV across all ages for U.S. children and adolescents. These estimates can help researchers and clinicians identify groups most at risk, inform research on EBV-cancer etiology, and motivate potential vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W1968100841,"Defining mechanisms by which Plasmodium virulence is regulated is central to understanding the pathogenesis of human malaria. Serial blood passage of Plasmodium through rodents, primates or humans increases parasite virulence, suggesting that vector transmission regulates Plasmodium virulence within the mammalian host. In agreement, disease severity can be modified by vector transmission, which is assumed to 'reset' Plasmodium to its original character. However, direct evidence that vector transmission regulates Plasmodium virulence is lacking. Here we use mosquito transmission of serially blood passaged (SBP) Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi to interrogate regulation of parasite virulence. Analysis of SBP P. c. chabaudi before and after mosquito transmission demonstrates that vector transmission intrinsically modifies the asexual blood-stage parasite, which in turn modifies the elicited mammalian immune response, which in turn attenuates parasite growth and associated pathology. Attenuated parasite virulence associates with modified expression of the pir multi-gene family. Vector transmission of Plasmodium therefore regulates gene expression of probable variant antigens in the erythrocytic cycle, modifies the elicited mammalian immune response, and thus regulates parasite virulence. These results place the mosquito at the centre of our efforts to dissect mechanisms of protective immunity to malaria for the development of an effective vaccine."

https://openalex.org/W2110753780,"Attention improves perception by affecting different aspects of the neuronal code. It enhances firing rates, it reduces firing rate variability and noise correlations of neurons, and it alters the strength of oscillatory activity. Attention-induced rate enhancement in striate cortex requires cholinergic mechanisms. The neuropharmacological mechanisms responsible for attention-induced variance and noise correlation reduction or those supporting changes in oscillatory activity are unknown. We show that ionotropic glutamatergic receptor activation is required for attention-induced rate variance, noise correlation, and LFP gamma power reduction in macaque V1, but not for attention-induced rate modulations. NMDA receptors mediate attention-induced variance reduction and attention-induced noise correlation reduction. Our results demonstrate that attention improves sensory processing by a variety of mechanisms that are dissociable at the receptor level."

Here, we show that ctoNrg1 mice, which mimic high levels of NRG1 observed in forebrain regions of schizophrenic patients, exhibit behavioral deficits and hypofunction of glutamatergic and GABAergic pathways. Intriguingly, these deficits were diminished when NRG1 expression returned to normal in adult mice, suggesting that damage which occurred during development is recoverable. Conversely, increase of NRG1 in adulthood was sufficient to cause glutamatergic impairment and behavioral deficits. We found that the glutamatergic impairment by NRG1 overexpression required LIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1), which was activated in mutant mice, identifying a pathological mechanism. These observations demonstrate that synaptic dysfunction and behavioral deficits in ctoNrg1 mice require continuous NRG1 abnormality in adulthood, suggesting that relevant schizophrenia may benefit from therapeutic intervention to restore NRG1 signaling.

Schizophrenia is a common and disabling mental illness that affects 1% of the population worldwide and accounts for 3% of the total economic burden of human disease (Murray and Lopez, 1996Murray C. Lopez A. The Global Burden of Disease. Harvard School of Public Health, Cambridge, MA1996Google Scholar). Schizophrenia is believed to be a neural developmental disorder with strong genetic factors (Lewis and Levitt, 2002Lewis D.A. Levitt P. Schizophrenia as a disorder of neurodevelopment.Annu. Rev.

Exactly how Nrg1 gene variations lead to schizophrenia remains unclear. Most of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Nrg1 gene that are associated with schizophrenia are localized in intronic, noncoding regions (Mei and Xiong, 2008Mei L. Xiong W.C. Neuregulin 1 in neural development, synaptic plasticity and schizophrenia.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 437-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that they may regulate the expression of the Nrg1 gene. Expression of isoform 1 alpha of NRG1 was lower in brains of schizophrenic patients (Bertram et al., 2007Bertram I. Bernstein H.G. Lendeckel U. Bukowska A. Dobrowolny H. Keilhoff G. Kanakis D.

The HapICE risk haplotype is associated with increased expression of NRG1 in the brain (Weickert et al., 2012Weickert C.S. Tiwari Y. Schofield P.R. Mowry B.J. Fullerton J.M.

Moreover, mRNA and protein of NRG1 are increased in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus of schizophrenia patients (Chong et al., 2008Chong V.Z. Thompson M. Beltaifa S. Webster M.J. Law A.J.

Likewise, NRG1 signaling was increased in the forebrain of patients (Hahn et al., 2006Hahn C.G. Wang H.Y. Cho D.S. Talbot K. Gur R.E. Berrettini W.H. Bakshi K. Kamins J. Borgmann-Winter K.E.

Expression of Nrg1 transgene in ctoNrg1 mice was restricted to forebrain regions including PFC and hippocampus, areas increasingly implicated in schizophrenia (Harrison, 2004Harrison P.J.

Psychiatry. 1986; 43: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar). The ctoNrg1 mice showed relevant behavioral deficits and were impaired in glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission. Unexpectedly, both synaptic dysfunction and behavioral deficits disappeared when expression of the Nrg1 transgene was switched off in adult mice. Moreover, turning on the transgene expression in adulthood alone was sufficient to cause impaired glutamatergic transmission and behavioral deficits. We studied mechanisms underlying synaptic dysfunction in ctoNrg1 mice. Results indicate that glutamatergic hypofunction caused by NRG1 overexpression requires LIMK1, but not ErbB4, identifying a pathogenic mechanism. Together, these observations demonstrate that synaptic dysfunction and behavioral deficits require continuous NRG1 abnormality in adulthood. Our results suggest that relevant schizophrenia may benefit from therapeutic intervention to restore NRG1 signaling. To mimic high levels of NRG1 type I in schizophrenic patients, we generated transgenic mice, TRE-Nrg1, which carry the type I NRG1β cDNA under the control of the tetracycline-responsive promoter element (TRE) tetO (Figure 1A). An HA tag was inserted between the Ig and EGF domains, which has no effect on NRG1 processing and function (Wang et al., 2001Wang J.Y. Miller S.J. Falls D.L.

Resulting bitransgenic CamK2α-tTA;TRE-Nrg1 mice (ctoNrg1 for CamK2α promoter-driven tet-off Nrg1) produced HA-NRG1 in excitatory neurons in the absence of doxycycline (Dox) (Figures 1B and 1C). Compared with TRE-Nrg1 or control mice, NRG1 was increased by 50%–100% in forebrain of ctoNrg1 mice (Figures 1C and 1D), similar to levels in forebrain of schizophrenic patients. The increase was due to expression of the transgene, which was detectable by anti-HA antibody (Figures 1C, 1E, and 1F). Moreover, the increase was forebrain specific and not detectable in the midbrain and cerebellum (Figures 1C and 1D), in agreement with the expression of CamK2α-tTA (Mayford et al., 1996Mayford M. Bach M.E. Huang Y.Y. Wang L. Hawkins R.D. Kandel E.R. Control of memory formation through regulated expression of a CaMKII transgene.Science. 1996; 274: 1678-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). The expression of transgene occurred as early as postnatal day 0 and remained into adulthood (Figures 1G and 1H). Finally, the overexpression of NRG1 could be switched off by Dox (Figures 1C–1F). Together, the results indicate that ctoNrg1 mice express higher levels of NRG1 in the forebrain during development, and the expression could be turned off efficiently by Dox. Compared to controls, ctoNrg1 mice displayed normal motor skill learning on rotarod test (see Figure S1A available online) and did not exhibit an anxiety-like phenotype in elevated plus maze ( Figures S1B–S1E). However, they were hyperactive in open-field test (Figure 2B), a phenotype thought to correspond to psychomotor agitation in schizophrenic patients (Snyder, 1973Snyder S.H. Amphetamine psychosis: a “model” schizophrenia mediated by catecholamines.Am. J. Psychiatry. 1973; 130: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is a common test of sensory-motor gating that is often decreased in schizophrenic patients. ctoNrg1 mice had a slightly elevated response to 70 dB background noise (Figure 2C), suggesting no deficit in hearing, and produced similar startle amplitude (Figure S1F). However, PPI was impaired in ctoNrg1 mice, compared to controls (Figure 2D). Social withdrawal is a negative symptom of schizophrenia (Corcoran et al., 1995Corcoran R. Mercer G. Frith C.D. Schizophrenia, symptomatology and social inference: investigating “theory of mind” in people with schizophrenia.Schizophr. Res. 1995; 17: 5-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). ctoNrg1 and control mice showed no difference in the time spent around a cylinder without a stimulus mouse inside (Figure 2E). However, the time spent around the social cylinder with a stimulus mouse inside was significantly reduced in ctoNrg1 mice, compared to controls (Figure 2E). Moreover, the social interaction time of ctoNrg1 mice with the stimulus mouse was reduced, compared to controls (Figure 2F). These results suggest impaired social activity in ctoNrg1 mice. To determine the effect of NRG1 overexpression on cognitive function, we tested spatial working memory and reference memory in 8-arm radial maze (ARM) and Morris water maze (MWM), respectively (Hodges, 1996Hodges H. Maze procedures: the radial-arm and water maze compared.Brain Res. Cogn. Brain Res. 1996; 3: 167-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar; Morris, 1984Morris R. Developments of a water-maze procedure for studying spatial learning in the rat.J. Neurosci. Methods. 1984; 11: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (5750) Google Scholar). To exclude potential influence of hyperactivity in the 8 ARM test, we monitored correct entries during the first eight entries. They were reduced in ctoNrg1 mice compared to controls (Figure 2G), indicating deficient spatial working memory. In MWMs, ctoNrg1 mice had no problem in visualizing the platform (Figure S1G) and were able to learn to locate the submerged platforms. However, the latency to find the platform was increased, compared to controls (Figure 2H), indicating compromised ability to learn. In the probe trial, the number of times that ctoNrg1 mice swam across the platform location decreased, compared to controls (Figure 2I). These results indicate that ctoNrg1 mice are impaired in spatial reference memory. The above results demonstrate that NRG1 overexpression in the forebrain causes behavioral deficits in locomotor activity, sensory-motor gating, social interaction, and cognitive function, in agreement with recent studies (Deakin et al., 2009Deakin I.H.

Finally, administration of clozapine, an antipsychotic medication for schizophrenic patients (Krakowski et al., 2006Krakowski M.I. Czobor P. Citrome L. Bark N. Cooper T.B. Atypical antipsychotic agents in the treatment of violent patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 2006; 63: 622-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), ameliorated behavioral deficits of ctoNrg1 mice in open field, PPI and social interaction tests (Figure S2). ctoNrg1 mice showed normal laminar structure and densities of excitatory and parvalbumin (PV)-positive neurons in the somatosensory cortex and hippocampus (Figure S3). Intriguingly, there was a downward shift of input-output (I/O) curves of fEPSPs (field excitatory postsynaptic potentials) at Schaffer collateral (SC) – CA1 synapses in ctoNrg1 hippocampus, compared to controls (Figure 3B), suggesting hypofunction of glutamatergic transmission. To determine if the impairment is caused by reduced glutamate receptors or decreased glutamate release, we measured miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in CA1 pyramidal neurons in the presence of TTX to block action potentials. No difference was observed in mEPSC amplitudes between ctoNrg1 and control slices (Figure 3C). Moreover, the ratio of AMPAR to NMDAR EPSCs (AMPA/NMDA ratio) (Figure S4A) and protein levels of NMDAR, AMPAR, and PSD95 were similar between the two genotypes (Figure S4B). These results suggest that NRG1 overexpression did not alter glutamate receptor density or composition. However, mEPSC frequency was decreased in ctoNrg1 hippocampus (Figure 3C) and PFC (Figure S4C). Since reduction of mEPSC frequency suggests impaired glutamate release or fewer functional synapses, we measured fEPSPs evoked by two presynaptic stimulations delivered at different intervals (i.e., paired pulses). Paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) of initial slopes of fEPSPs was increased in ctoNrg1 slices, compared to controls, suggesting lowered release probability (Figure 3D). Moreover, the rate of synaptic fatigue during high-frequency stimulation was slower in ctoNrg1 slices (Figure S4D). Together, these observations suggest that the glutamatergic pathway is hypofunctional in ctoNrg1 mice, probably due to impair"
https://openalex.org/W2083091243,"The nucleocapsid (N) phosphoprotein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) packages the viral genome into a helical ribonucleocapsid and plays a fundamental role during viral self-assembly. The N protein consists of two structural domains interspersed between intrinsically disordered regions and dimerizes through the C-terminal structural domain (CTD). A key activity of the protein is the ability to oligomerize during capsid formation by utilizing the dimer as a building block, but the structural and mechanistic bases of this activity are not well understood. By disulfide trapping technique we measured the amount of transient oligomers of N protein mutants with strategically located cysteine residues and showed that CTD acts as a primary transient oligomerization domain in solution. The data is consistent with the helical oligomer packing model of N protein observed in crystal. A systematic study of the oligomerization behavior revealed that altering the intermolecular electrostatic repulsion through changes in solution salt concentration or phosphorylation-mimicking mutations affects oligomerization propensity. We propose a biophysical mechanism where electrostatic repulsion acts as a switch to regulate N protein oligomerization."
https://openalex.org/W2014992560,"The asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase is the final stage of nuclear burning for low-mass stars. Although Milky Way globular clusters are now known to harbour (at least) two generations of stars, they still provide relatively homogeneous samples of stars that are used to constrain stellar evolution theory. It is predicted by stellar models that the majority of cluster stars with masses around the current turn-off mass (that is, the mass of the stars that are currently leaving the main sequence phase) will evolve through the AGB phase. Here we report that all of the second-generation stars in the globular cluster NGC 6752--70 per cent of the cluster population--fail to reach the AGB phase. Through spectroscopic abundance measurements, we found that every AGB star in our sample has a low sodium abundance, indicating that they are exclusively first-generation stars. This implies that many clusters cannot reliably be used for star counts to test stellar evolution timescales if the AGB population is included. We have no clear explanation for this observation."
https://openalex.org/W2018626182,"Cognitive deficits have been inconsistently described for late or moderately preterm children but are consistently found in very preterm children. This study investigates the association between cognitive workload demands of tasks and cognitive performance in relation to gestational age at birth.Data were collected as part of a prospective geographically defined whole-population study of neonatal at-risk children in Southern Bavaria. At 8;5 years, n = 1326 children (gestation range: 23-41 weeks) were assessed with the K-ABC and a Mathematics Test.Cognitive scores of preterm children decreased as cognitive workload demands of tasks increased. The relationship between gestation and task workload was curvilinear and more pronounced the higher the cognitive workload: GA² (quadratic term) on low cognitive workload: R² = .02, p<0.001; moderate cognitive workload: R² = .09, p<0.001; and high cognitive workload tasks: R² = .14, p<0.001. Specifically, disproportionally lower scores were found for very (<32 weeks gestation) and moderately (32-33 weeks gestation) preterm children the higher the cognitive workload of the tasks. Early biological factors such as gestation and neonatal complications explained more of the variance in high (12.5%) compared with moderate (8.1%) and low cognitive workload tasks (1.7%).The cognitive workload model may help to explain variations of findings on the relationship of gestational age with cognitive performance in the literature. The findings have implications for routine cognitive follow-up, educational intervention, and basic research into neuro-plasticity and brain reorganization after preterm birth."
https://openalex.org/W2069301108,"Symptoms similar to those found in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) often occur in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The objective of the current study was to compare verbal working memory, acquisition and delayed recall in children with High-Functioning Autism (HFA) to children with ADHD and typically developing children (TDC). Thirty-eight children with HFA, 79 with ADHD and 50 TDC (age 8–17) were assessed with a letter/number sequencing task and a verbal list-learning task. To investigate the possible influence of attention problems in children with HFA, we divided the HFA group into children with (HFA+) or without (HFA−) “attention problems” according to the Child Behaviour Checklist 6–18. The children with HFA+ displayed significant impairment compared to TDC on all three neurocognitive measures, while the children with HFA− were significantly impaired compared to TDC only on the working memory and acquisition measures. In addition, the HFA+ group scored significantly below the HFA− group and the ADHD group on the verbal working memory and delayed recall measures. The results support the proposition that children with HFA+, HFA−, and ADHD differ not only on a clinical level but also on a neurocognitive level which may have implications for treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2084801601,"Neural circuit assembly requires selection of specific cell fates, axonal trajectories, and synaptic targets. By analyzing the function of a secreted semaphorin, Sema-2b, in Drosophila olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) development, we identified multiple molecular and cellular mechanisms that link these events. Notch signaling limits Sema-2b expression to ventromedial ORN classes, within which Sema-2b cell-autonomously sensitizes ORN axons to external semaphorins. Central-brain-derived Sema-2a and Sema-2b attract Sema-2b-expressing axons to the ventromedial trajectory. In addition, Sema-2b/PlexB-mediated axon-axon interactions consolidate this trajectory choice and promote ventromedial axon-bundle formation. Selecting the correct developmental trajectory is ultimately essential for proper target choice. These findings demonstrate that Sema-2b couples ORN axon guidance to postsynaptic target neuron dendrite patterning well before the final target selection phase, and exemplify how a single guidance molecule can drive consecutive stages of neural circuit assembly with the help of sophisticated spatial and temporal regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2121066361,"Balance among the complex interactions of the gut microbial community is important for intestinal health. Probiotic bacteria can improve bacterial balance and have been used to treat gastrointestinal diseases. Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening inflammatory bowel disorder primarily affecting premature infants. NEC is associated with extensive inflammatory NF-κB signaling activation as well as intestinal barrier disruption. Clinical studies have shown that probiotic administration may protect against NEC, however there are safety concerns associated with the ingestion of large bacterial loads in preterm infants. Bacteria-free conditioned media (CM) from certain probiotic organisms have been shown to retain bioactivity including anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties without the risks of live organisms. We hypothesized that the CM from Lactobacillus acidophilus (La), Bifidobacterium infantis (Bi), and Lactobacillus plantarum (Lp), used separately or together would protect against NEC. A rodent model with intestinal injury similar to NEC was used to study the effect of CM from Lp, La/Bi, and La/Bi/Lp on the pathophysiology of NEC. All the CM suppressed NF-κB activation via preserved IκBα expression and this protected IκBα was associated with decreased liver activity of the proteasome, which is the degrading machinery for IκBα. These CM effects also caused decreases in intestinal production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α, a downstream target of the NF-κB pathway. Combined La/Bi and La/Bi/Lp CM in addition protected intestinal barrier function by maintaining tight junction protein ZO-1 levels and localization at the tight junction. Double combined La/Bi CM significantly reduced intestinal injury incidence from 43% to 28% and triple combined La/Bi/Lp CM further reduced intestinal injury incidence to 20%. Thus, this study demonstrates different protective mechanisms and synergistic bioactivity of the CM from different organisms in ameliorating NEC-like intestinal injury in an animal model."

A panel of invasive isolates collected in the Netherlands over a period of 50 years was used. To our knowledge, this strain collection covers the longest time period of any collection available worldwide. Long-term persistence of several antigen sub/variants and of non-overlapping antigen sub/variant combinations was observed.

Our findings suggest a direct link between attention-dependent response modulations in early visual cortex and improved behavioral performance. Processing of sensory stimuli relies upon dynamic and highly adaptive neuronal mechanisms for selection and perception. Previous neurophysiological research showed that neuronal responses are substantially influenced by selective attention throughout the visual cortex (Desimone and Duncan, 1995Desimone R. Duncan J.

For example, in the motion-selective mediotemporal (MT) area of the macaque (Maunsell and Van Essen, 1983Maunsell J.H.R. Van Essen D.C.

This has been shown by (1) forced-choice paradigms demonstrating significant correlations between neuronal activity and behavioral choice (Britten et al., 1996Britten K.H. Newsome W.T. Shadlen M.N.

Selective disturbance of movement vision after bilateral brain damage.Brain. 1983; 106: 313-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). In light of these data, it is important to understand how attention-dependent neuronal response modulations may cause the improved behavioral outcome, as reflected by shorter reaction times and better performance (Wegener et al., 2006Wegener D.

Selective visual attention ensures constancy of sensory representations: testing the influence of perceptual load and spatial competition.Vision Res. 2006; 46: 3563-3574Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). One prominent analogy that has been applied to selective attention is contrast enhancement (Martínez-Trujillo and Treue, 2002Martínez-Trujillo J.C. Treue S.

Neurosci. 2004; 27: 611-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Like selective attention, enhancing the stimulus contrast increases the magnitude of neuronal responses, and at the same time it reduces behavioral detection times and thresholds (Cameron et al., 2002Cameron E.L. Tai J.C. Carrasco M. Covert attention affects the psychometric function of contrast sensitivity.Vision Res. 2002; 42: 949-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar; Carrasco et al., 2000Carrasco M. Penpeci-Talgar C. Eckstein M. Spatial covert attention increases contrast sensitivity across the CSF: support for signal enhancement.Vision Res. 2000; 40: 1203-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). However, there are also important differences between contrast response functions and attention-dependent modulations of neuronal responses. For example, contrast has a marked influence on neuronal response latencies in early visual cortex (Gawne et al., 1996Gawne T.J. Kjaer T.W. Richmond B.J. Latency: another potential code for feature binding in striate cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 76: 1356-1360PubMed Google Scholar; Maunsell and Gibson, 1992Maunsell J.H. Gibson J.R.

De Souza W.C. Tamura R. Nishijo H. Ono T. Neuronal correlates of face identification in the monkey anterior temporal cortical areas.J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 91: 358-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It thus remains a surprising result that, with the exception of the findings by Sundberg et al., 2012Sundberg K.A. Mitchell J.F. Gawne T.J. Reynolds J.H. Attention influences single unit and local field potential response latencies in visual cortical area V4.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 16040-16050Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, there is so little experimental support regarding an influence of attention on neuronal latencies. Considering the presumed relation between attention-dependent modulation in early visual cortex and behavioral improvements, accelerated neuronal responses constitute a plausible mechanism for accelerated behavioral responses. We here investigate this issue by considering responses of MT neurons to changes in the speed of a motion stimulus, to which the monkeys were required to react. Psychophysical evidence shows that the contrast of the speed change (i.e., the relative difference between initial and changed speed) has a marked influence on both detection thresholds and reaction times (Traschütz et al., 2012Traschütz A. Zinke W. Wegener D. Speed change detection in foveal and peripheral vision.Vision Res. 2012; 72: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Hence, we hypothesized that the neuronal representation of this change is a likely substrate for both attentional modulation and close relation to behavioral performance. We first investigated the influence of attention on the neuronal responses to the speed change and then the relation between these responses and behavioral reaction times. Our results show that both latency and peak amplitude of the response to the speed change are modulated by attention, but only latencies correlate with RT, and they do so even when peak responses are identical. Interestingly, the strong attentional modulation of the mean firing rate prior to the speed change has no correlation to the later behavioral outcome, whereas the prechange response variability is consistently smaller for trials that are followed by fast RTs. Two animals were trained on a speed discrimination task requiring them to attend one of two simultaneously presented Gabor gratings and to respond to an instantaneous speed-up of the precued target stimulus by releasing a lever while keeping gaze at the fixation point (Figure 1A). To avoid contamination of the neuronal speed-change representation by eye movements, animals had to keep fixation for another 300 ms following their behavioral response. The target stimulus could be located either within the receptive field (RF) of the recorded neuron or in the opposite hemifield. In the latter case, the neuron was stimulated with the nonattended Gabor (distractor). Thus, the experimental design provided neuronal responses for conditions of “attention” and “nonattention” for the stimulus within the RF. Prior to target speed-up, in about 40%–50% of trials the distractor was accelerating first, which had to be ignored by the animals. In case they responded to the distractor speed-up, the trial was terminated and the error was counted as “wrong response.” Ignoring trials being aborted due to fixation errors (monkey V: 17.1%, monkey F: 5%), monkey V and F gave a wrong response in 1.9% and 8.3%, missed the target speed-up in 1.1% and 4.7% of the trials, and released the lever independent of any speed-up (false alarm) in 2% and 2.8% of the trials, resulting in an overall performance of 95% and 84.2%, respectively (Figure 1B). We recorded responses from 124 recording sites in area MT (monkey V: 70). Of the total number of units, 68% (84 units, monkey V: 46) fulfilled the criteria for further analysis (e.g., a response increase following the speed-up, sufficient number of trials, and recorded in a session with sufficient behavioral performance; see Experimental Procedures). Based on custom-made spike-sorting routines (Galashan et al., 2011Galashan F.O. Rempel H.C. Meyer A. Gruber-Dujardin E. Kreiter A.K. Wegener D. A new type of recording chamber with an easy-to-exchange microdrive array for chronic recordings in macaque monkeys.J. Neurophysiol. 2011; 105: 3092-3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), 35 of these (42%) were characterized as single units. Figure 1C illustrates the spike density functions (SDF) of two example units showing the response pattern around the Gabor speed-up as well as its modulation by attention. In line with previous findings (Seidemann and Newsome, 1999Seidemann E. Newsome W.T. Effect of spatial attention on the responses of area MT neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 81: 1783-1794PubMed Google Scholar; Treue and Maunsell, 1996Treue S. Maunsell J.H.R.

Kreiter A.K. The influence of sustained selective attention on stimulus selectivity in macaque visual area MT.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6106-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), both neurons responded with a higher firing rate when attention was directed to the Gabor inside the RF. Interestingly, this was found not only for the prechange response but also for the postchange response (with the term “prechange response” referring to the time from 200 ms before speed-up until speed-up and “postchange response” referring to the time window 50 ms to 250 ms after speed-up). The speed-up of the Gabor elicited a strong, transient increase in neuronal firing rates for about 200 ms in response to both target and distractor stimuli, but reached a higher peak amplitude (calculated as the difference between prechange mean response and maximum of postchange response for both attention conditions independently) at shorter latency (calculated as point in time at which 75% of the condition’s peak was exceeded) in the attended condition. This pattern was consistent with the population response as obtained by pooling over all units after normalizing firing rates to the mean response strength calculated over both attentional conditions (Figure 1D). The population response revealed a highly significant influence of attention on mean firing rates during both the pre- and postchange period [paired t test; prechange: t(83) = 7.34, p < 0.001; postchange: t(83) = 7.57, p < 0.001, n = 84]. Importantly, for the postchange period, two parameters of the transient response were specifically modulated by attention. First, the transient response to the speed change occurred at significantly shorter latencies; i.e., the neurons responded faster to the speed change when it was behaviorally relevant (Wilcoxon signed rank test: Z = −3.22, p = 0.001, n = 84) (Figure 1E). Second, the transients reached a significantly higher peak amplitude (Wilcoxon signed rank test: Z = −2.19, p = 0.02, n = 84) (Figure 1F). Hence, if attention-dependent behavioral improvements are caused by attention-dependent response modulation in early visual cortex, both latencies and peak amplitudes constitute a potential neuronal correlate for such improvements. Therefore, the next step was to ask whether there is a systematic relation between the transient postchange response and the time the animals needed to indicate detection of the speed change. Figure 2A shows the cumulative distribution of normalized RTs and demonstrates that even for successfully detected target events, RTs differ across a wide range. To investigate any systematic covariation between latency or amplitude of the postchange response and the animals’ RT, we sorted all trials from the attended condition by RT and computed the SDF of the 20% of trials with the fastest RT and the 20% of trials with the slowest RT (approximately five trials per condition) for each neuron individually. Figure 2B shows the respective average SDFs for monkey V. Similar to the results of the attended versus nonattended comparison, we found a clear response difference between trials ending in fast RTs as compared to those ending in slow RTs. For fast trials, the transient response possessed a shorter latency and arrived at higher amplitude. The response difference between fast and slow trials reached significance already 50 ms after target speed-up, as tested by bootstrapping across 5,000 samples (see Experimental Procedures). For monkey F, the fast/slow comparison was very similar to monkey V, reaching a significant difference at 80 ms following the speed change of the target (Figure 2C). For both monkeys, comparing fast and slow RT trials at the level of individual units revealed a significant decrease in response latency for trials with fast RTs (Wilcoxon signed rank test; monkey V: Z = −2.69, p = 0.007, n = 46; monkey F: Z = −2.62, p = 0.009, n = 38), but only for monkey V was there also a significant increase in peak amplitude (Wilcoxon signed rank test: Z = −2.59, p = 0.009, n = 46) (Figures 2D and 2E). In contrast, for monkey F peak amplitude differences failed to reach significance (Wilcoxon signed rank test: Z = −1.4, p = 0.162, n = 38). We next investigated how transient responses obtained from trials with intermediate RTs relate to those of the fastest and slowest trials. To this end, we pooled all trials from the attended condition of both animals and then subdivided these into five fractions, sorted by RT (fastest, fast, mean, slow, and slowest). For each of these fractions, Figure 3A shows the corresponding mean SDFs, normalized to the mean prechange response of all trials of a neuron. The most prominent transient response is obtained from trials with fastest and fast RTs, the weakest transient response from trials with the slowest RTs, and an intermediate transient response from the remaining two fractions of trials with RTs in-between. For comparison, the figure also shows the transient response obtained from the (relatively small) fraction of “miss” trials (i.e., for those trials for which the animals failed to detect the speed change). In this case, the mean SDF reveals a still smaller transient increase of the neurons’ firing rate in response to the speed change. To test whether latency or amplitude of this transient firing rate increase systematically covary with the monkeys’ RTs, we calculated latency and amplitude indexes for each of the RT fractions (RTF) defined above. Indexes were computed by relating the mean latency (or amplitude) of the respective RTF to the mean latency (or amplitude) of all trials from the attended condition of that neuron (see Experimental Procedures). For comparison of these indexes with the behavioral performance, Figures 3B–3D plot the median normalized RTs of the five RTFs and the corresponding median latency and amplitude indexes from the population of neurons for each of the RTFs. The transients’ latency monotonically increases with increasing RTs and thus shows a clear RT dependence, whereas for peak amplitude, the main effect is a decrease in amplitude for trials with slowest RTs, but no consistent covariation over all RTFs. For testing these findings statistically, we computed a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) for each combination of the five RTFs and estimated ROC performance as defined by the integral under the ROC curve. Significant deviation from chance (50%) was assessed by means of a binominal test (p < 0.05, n = 84). Figures 3E and 3F show the corresponding results if latency or peak amplitude is used to distinguish between two sets of trials differing in mean RT. For latency, the comparison of trials with the fastest RTs to trials with the mean, slow, and slowest RTs results in ROC performance significantly better than chance. Likewise, comparing fast to slowest trials results in significant performance. For other comparisons, ROC performance consistently covaried with RT differences as well, although did not reach a significant level. In contrast, for peak amplitudes, ROC performance only reveals that trials with the slowest RT differ from other trials. At the same time, it also shows that there is no marked difference between the remaining RTFs, as expressed by ROC performance near chance.Figure 3Analysis of Peak Amplitude and Latency with Respect to RTsShow full caption(A) Colored lines depict mean SDFs for five RTFs consisting of the 20% of trials with the fastest, fast, mean, slow, and slowest RT, taken from each neuron individually.

The normalization procedure we applied to RTs, latencies, and peak amplitudes corrects for session-by-session variability when pooling over all data and thereby provides a better estimate than absolute numbers. However, the relation between RT, latency, and peak amplitude reported above holds true for absolute values as well (Table 1). The mean RT of the RTF with the fastest trials was 311 ms and increased by 27.3% to 396 ms for the RTF with the slowest trials. Correspondingly, mean latency to speed changes was 82 ms for trials with the fastest RT and increased by 14.6% to 94 ms for the slowest trials. In contrast, absolute peak amplitudes have a poor relation to RT and essentially do not differ between the RTFs with the fastest, fast, mean, and slow RT. Thus, over a wide range of values, RTs seem to be independent of peak amplitudes, even though very slow RTs are preceded by small peak amplitudes, similar to “misses.” In contrast, RTs show a close relation to the point in time of the abrupt firing rate increase that occurs in response to the target speed change, with fast RTs preceded by transients of short latency.Table 1Absolute Reaction Times, Latencies, and Peak Amplitudes for Five Fractions of Trials with Increasing Mean RTTrial FractionRT (ms)SD%Latency (ms)SD%Peak (Hz)SD%Fastest31127—8223—124.881.8—Fast33125+6.48118−1.2125.976.7+0.9Mean34527+10.98526+3.7125.582.5+0.6Slow36331+16.79027+9.8123.480.3−1.1Slowest39642+27.39432+14.6119.772.9−4.1Percentage values express the relative difference in RT, latency, or peak amplitude to the corresponding value of the trial fraction with the fastest RTs (top row). Open table in a new tab Percentage values express the relative difference in RT, latency, or peak amplitude to the corresponding value of the trial fraction with the fastest RTs (top row). We did several control analyses to further validate the close relation between latency and behavioral RTs. First, to exclude the possibility that the results were biased by specific parameters used to calculate the SDFs, we recalculated RT-sorted SDFs using kernels with σ = 10, 15, and 20 ms and then calculated latencies not only for the time of 75% peak response but also for 50%. Latency differences between fast and slow trials were significant for all tests, with p = 0.024 for the test with the weakest p value (Wilcoxon signed rank test for 50% peak response with σ = 20 ms, Z = −2.25, n = 84). Second, instead of referring to the peak, we recalculated latency by estimating significant deviation from the response to base speed by estimating the first bin surpassing the mean firing rate plus 4 SD using a ±75 ms moving window. Again, latencies for fast and slow trials were significantly different (Wilcoxon signed rank test, Z = −3.11, p = 0.002, n = 84). Third, to test whether differences in RT-related latencies may reflect different states of arousal rather than being induced by attention, we calculated SDFs for speed changes when attention was directed away from the RF, using the 20% trials with fastest and the 20% trials with slowest RT, taken from the nonattended condition. However, neither latencies (Wilcoxon signed rank test, Z = −0.749, p = 0.454, n = 84) nor peak amplitudes (Wilcoxon signed rank test, Z = −0.408, p = 0.683, n = 84) showed significant differences. Hence, trial-wise fluctuations in arousal do not explain our results. Finally, we were interested in whether and how latencies depend on the postchange firing rate. Even though we found that peak amplitudes do not show a systematic relation to RTs, they nevertheless were modulated and differed between fast and slow trials. Therefore, we first investigated whether latencies between trials with a high postchang"

Method We used data from adults aged 20–74 years who participated in National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys from 1988–1994 to 2007–2008. The effect of change in dietary fat intake on concentrations of total cholesterol was estimated by the use of equations developed by Keys, Hegsted, and successors. Results Age-adjusted mean concentrations of total cholesterol were 5.60 mmol/L (216 mg/dl) during 1988–1994 falling to 5.09 mmol/L (197 mg/dl) in 2007–2008 (P<0.001). No significant changes in the intake of total fat, saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, and dietary cholesterol were observed from 1988–1994 to 2007–2008. However, the age-adjusted use of cholesterol-lowering medications increased from 1.6% to 12.5% (P<0.001). The various equations suggested that changes in dietary fat made minimal contributions to the observed trend in mean concentrations of total cholesterol. The increased use of cholesterol-lowering medications was estimated to account for approximately 46% of the change. Discussion Mean concentrations of total cholesterol among adults in the United States have declined by ∼4% since 1988–1994. The increased use of cholesterol-lowering medications has apparently accounted for about half of this small fall. Further substantial decreases in cholesterol might be potentially achievable by implementing effective and feasible public health interventions to promote the consumption of a more healthful diet by US adults.

The present study seeks to develop methodology to identify collagen type and other tissue components using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectral evaluation of matrix composition in combination with multivariate analyses. FTIR spectra of the primary molecular components of repair cartilage, types I and II collagen, and aggrecan, were used to develop multivariate spectral models for discrimination of the matrix components of the tissues of interest. Infrared imaging data were collected from bovine bone, tendon, normal cartilage, meniscus and human repair cartilage tissues, and composition predicted using partial least squares analyses. Histology and immunohistochemistry results were used as standards for validation. Infrared fiber optic probe spectral data were also obtained from meniscus (a tissue with mixed collagen types) to evaluate the potential of this method for identification of collagen type in a minimally-invasive clinical application. Concentration profiles of the tissue components obtained from multivariate analysis were in excellent agreement with histology and immunohistochemistry results. Bone and tendon showed a uniform distribution of predominantly type I collagen through the tissue. Normal cartilage showed a distribution of type II collagen and proteoglycan similar to the known composition, while in repair cartilage, the spectral distribution of both types I and II collagen were similar to that observed via immunohistochemistry. Using the probe, the outer and inner regions of the meniscus were shown to be primarily composed of type I and II collagen, respectively, in accordance with immunohistochemistry data. In summary, multivariate analysis of infrared spectra can indeed be used to differentiate collagen type I and type II, even in the presence of proteoglycan, in connective tissues, using both imaging and fiber optic methodology. This has great potential for clinical in situ applications for monitoring tissue repair."

However, the effects and implications of differences in GR concentration have not been fully elucidated. Using three statistically different GR concentrations in transiently transfected COS-1 cells, we demonstrate, using co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) and fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET), that high levels of wild type GR (wtGR), but not of dimerization deficient GR (GRdim), display ligand-independent dimerization. Whole-cell saturation ligand-binding experiments furthermore establish that positive cooperative ligand-binding, with a concomitant increased ligand-binding affinity, is facilitated by ligand-independent dimerization at high concentrations of wtGR, but not GRdim. The down-stream consequences of ligand-independent dimerization at high concentrations of wtGR, but not GRdim, are shown to include basal priming of the system as witnessed by ligand-independent transactivation of both a GRE-containing promoter-reporter and the endogenous glucocorticoid (GC)-responsive gene, GILZ, as well as ligand-independent loading of GR onto the GILZ promoter. Pursuant to the basal priming of the system, addition of ligand results in a significantly greater modulation of transactivation potency than would be expected solely from the increase in ligand-binding affinity. Thus ligand-independent dimerization of the GR at high concentrations primes the system, through ligand-independent DNA loading and transactivation, which together with positive cooperative ligand-binding increases the potency of GR agonists and shifts the bio-character of partial GR agonists. Clearly GR-levels are a major factor in determining the sensitivity to GCs and a critical factor regulating transcriptional programs."
https://openalex.org/W2037965065,"Prostate cancer is a clinically heterogeneous disease, ranging from indolent asymptomatic disease to very aggressive metastatic and life threatening forms of the disease. Distant metastasis represents the major lethal cause of prostate cancer. The most critical clinical challenge in the management of the patients is identifying those individuals at risk of developing metastatic disease. To understand the molecular mechanisms of prostate cancer metastasis and identify markers with metastatic potential, we have analyzed protein expression in two syngeneic prostate cancer cells lines PC3-N2 and PC3-ML2 using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation labeling and multi-dimensional protein identification technology liquid chromatography matrix assisted laser desorption ionization tandem mass spectrometry. PC3-N2 is lowly metastatic while PC3-ML2 highly metastatic. A total of 1,756 proteins were identified in the analyses with 130 proteins showing different expression levels (p<0.01) in the two cell lines. Out of these, 68 proteins were found to be significantly up-regulated while 62 are significantly down-regulated in PC3-ML2 cells compared with PC3-N2 cells. The upregulation of plectin and vimentin which were the most significantly differentially expressed were validated by Western blot and their functional relevance with respect to invasion and migration was determined by siRNA gene silencing. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that up-regulation of vimentin and plectin expression positively correlates with the invasion and metastasis of androgen-independent PCA."
https://openalex.org/W2129504291,"Ovarian processes and the timing of ovulation are important predictors of both female fertility and reproductive pathology. Multiple waves of antral follicular development have been documented during the menstrual cycle in women. However, the mechanisms underlying the development of follicular waves and their clinical significance are not fully understood. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between C-reactive protein (CRP) and follicular waves in healthy women. We wanted to determine whether follicular wave dynamics influence systemic inflammation, as ovarian activity increases local inflammatory processes and blood flow. We tested the hypothesis that women with 3 follicular waves would have higher CRP concentrations than those with 2 waves. We further hypothesized that a greater number of major waves (those with a dominant follicle) would be positively associated with CRP.Thirty-nine healthy women underwent daily transvaginal ultrasound examinations for one interovulatory interval, as part of an earlier study. Serum was collected every 3 days during the interovulatory interval (IOI). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were conducted to quantify serum CRP concentrations. Women with 3 waves had higher average log CRP concentrations (n = 14, -0.43±0.35) over the IOI than those with 2 waves (n = 25, -0.82±0.47, p = 02). Average log CRP concentrations were greater in women with 3 (0.30±0.31) versus 1 (-0.71±0.55) or 2 (-0.91±0.47) major waves (p = 0.03). Greater average CRP over the IOI was attributed to greater CRP in the follicular, but not the luteal phase, of the IOI.A greater number of total antral follicular waves, in particular major waves, corresponded to greater serum concentrations of CRP. These findings suggest that women with a greater number of follicular waves exhibit greater tissue remodeling and therefore greater local and systemic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2092633151,"Insect macroecology and conservation biogeography studies are disproportionately scarce, especially in the Neotropics. Dung beetles are an ideal focal taxon for biodiversity research and conservation. Using distribution and body size data on the ecologically important Phanaeini, the best-known Neotropical dung beetle tribe, we determined elevational patterns of species richness, endemism, body size, and elevational range in Bolivia, specifically testing Bergmann’s and Rapoport’s rule. Richness of all 39 species and of 15 ecoregional endemics showed a hump-shaped pattern peaking at 400 m, but overall declined strongly with elevation up to 4000 m. The relationship between endemic and total species richness appeared to be curvilinear, providing only partial support for the null hypothesis that species-rich areas are more likely to be centers of endemism by chance alone. An elevational increase in the proportion of ecoregional endemics suggests that deterministic factors also appear to influence endemism in the Andes. When controlling for the effect of area using different species-area relationships, the statistically significant richness peak became more pronounced and shifted upslope to 750 m. Larger species did not have higher elevational mid-points, and mean body size decreased significantly with elevation, contradicting Bergmann’s rule. Rapoport’s rule was supported: species with higher elevational mid-points had broader elevational ranges, and mean elevational range increased significantly with elevation. The elevational decrease of phanaeine richness is in accordance with studies that demonstrated the combined influence of temperature and water availability on species diversity, but also is consistent with niche conservatism. For invertebrates, confirmation of Rapoport’s and refutation of Bergmann’s rule appear to be scale-invariant general patterns. Analyses of biogeographic patterns across elevational gradients can provide important insights for identifying conservation priorities. Phanaeines with narrow elevational ranges on isolated low-elevation mountains in eastern Bolivia are at greatest climate-change related extinction risk from range-shift gaps and mountaintop extinctions."
https://openalex.org/W1982071540,"The presence of the conceptus in uterine cavity necessitates an elaborate network of interactions between the implanting embryo and a receptive endometrial tissue. We believe that embryo-derived signals play an important role in the remodeling and the extension of endometrial receptivity period. Our previous studies provided original evidence that human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) modulates and potentiates endometrial epithelial as well as stromal cell responsiveness to interleukin 1 (IL1), one of the earliest embryonic signals, which may represent a novel pathway by which the embryo favors its own implantation and growth within the maternal endometrial host. The present study was designed to gain a broader understanding of hCG impact on the modulation of endometrial cell receptivity, and in particular, cell responsiveness to IL1 and the acquisition of growth-promoting phenotype capable of receiving, sustaining, and promoting early and crucial steps of embryonic development. Our results showed significant changes in the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, immune modulation, tissue remodeling, apoptotic and angiogenic processes. This points to a relevant impact of these embryonic signals on the receptivity of the maternal endometrium, its adaptation to the implanting embryo and the creation of an environment that is favorable for the implantation and the growth of this latter within a new and likely hostile host tissue. Interestingly our data further identified a complex interaction between IL1 and hCG, which, despite a synergistic action on several significant endometrial target genes, may encompass a tight control of endogenous IL1 and extends to other IL1 family members."
https://openalex.org/W1986661526,"Activating Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) in hematopoietic cells serve to remove antibody-opsonized antigens, including dengue virus (DENV), from systemic circulation. While neutralizing antibody concentrations provide humoral immunity, cross-reactive or sub-neutralizing levels of antibody can result in antibody-dependent enhancement of DENV infection that increases overall viral burden. Recently, it has been suggested that the antibody levels needed for DENV neutralization differs when different FcγR is engaged. If this is true, the threshold titer used to infer immunity should be influenced by FcγR usage. Here, using cells that express both activating and inhibitory FcγRs, we show that the type of FcγR engaged during phagocytosis can influence the antibody concentration requirement for DENV neutralization. We demonstrate that phagocytosis through FcγRI requires significantly less antibody for complete DENV neutralization compared to FcγRIIA. Furthermore, when DENV is opsonized with sub-neutralizing levels of antibody, FcγRI-mediated phagocytosis resulted in significantly reduced DENV titers compared to FcγRIIA. However, while FcγRI may remove antibody-opsonized DENV more efficiently, this receptor is only preferentially engaged by clustering when neutralizing, but not sub-neutralizing antibody concentrations, were used. Collectively, our study demonstrates that activating FcγR usage may influence antibody titers needed for DENV neutralization."

Recently, some evidence indicated that calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) expressed in the cardiac tissue. However, the functional role of CaSR in diabetic cardiac injury remains unclear. The present study was designed to investigate the relationship between CaSR activation and diabetes-induced cardiac injury. Diabetic model was successfully established by administration of streptozotocin (STZ) in vivo, and cardiomyocyte injury was simulated by 25.5 mM glucose in vitro. Apoptotic rate, intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca²⁺](i)) and the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH₂-terminal protein kinase (JNK), and p38 were examined. We demonstrated a significant increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) as well as decrease in maximum rate of left ventricular pressure rise and fall (±dp/dtmax), and left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), apoptosis of cardiomyocytes was also observed by TUNEL staining. In vitro, 25.5 mM glucose-induced apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Further results showed that 25.5 mM glucose significantly increased [Ca²⁺](i), up-regulated the expression of Bax, P-ERK and P-JNK, and suppressed Bcl-2 expression. However, the above deleterious changes were further confirmed when co-treatment with CaSR agonist GdCl₃ (300 µM). But the effects of GdCl₃ were attenuated by 10 µM NPS-2390, a specific CaSR inhibitor. When CaSR was silence by siRNA transfection, the effects of high glucose were inhibited. These results suggest that CaSR activation could lead to the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes in diabetic cardiac injury through the induction of calcium overload, the activation of the mitochondrial, and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway."

We assessed HDAC2 expression within the airways of smokers and subjects with COPD and effects of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), using immuno-histology to contrast with previous molecular methodology. Endobronchial biopsies (ebb) from current smokers with COPD (COPD-CS; n = 15), ex-smokers with COPD (COPD-ES; n = 17), smokers with normal lung function (NS; n = 16) and normal controls (NC; n = 9) were immunostained for HDAC2. A double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled 6 months intervention study assessed effects of ICS on HDAC2 in 34 COPD subjects. There was no difference in epithelial HDAC2 staining in all groups. There was a significant reduction in total cell numbers in the lamina propria (LP) in COPD-CS and NS (p<0.05). LP cellularity correlated inversely with smoking history in COPD-CS (R = -0.8, p<0.003). HDAC2 expression increased markedly in NS (p<0.001); in contrast COPD-CS was associated with suppressed signal (p<0.03), while normal in COPD-ES. ICS did not affect HDAC2 cell staining. Our findings suggest that airway HDAC2 expression is increased in the LP by smoking itself, but is reduced in COPD. Ex-smokers have normalised HDAC2 cell expression, but ICS had no effect. The paper emphasise the pit-falls of relying on molecular data alone to define airway changes.The Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR). REGISTRY NUMBER: ACTRN12612001111864."

Work combining electrophysiological and imaging-based approaches to measure neural activity with pharmacological and electrophysiological manipulations has provided fundamental insights. More recently, genetic approaches have been used to monitor and manipulate neural activity, opening up new experimental opportunities and challenges. Here, we discuss issues associated with applying genetic approaches to circuit dissection in sensorimotor transformations, outlining important considerations for experimental design and considering how modeling can complement experimental approaches."
https://openalex.org/W1984882006,"Purpose Carbamazepine (CBZ) is used as the first line of treatment of Complex Partial Seizures (CPS) in the Epilepsy Clinic, Neurology Department of Kuala Lumpur Hospital (KLH). More than 30% of the patients remain drug resistant to CBZ mono-therapy. CBZ is transported by the P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The P-gp encoded by the ABCB1 and ABCC2 genes are expressed in drug resistant patients with epilepsy. A few studies have shown significant association between CBZ resistant epilepsy and Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) with adjacent polymorphisms of these genes. Our study is aimed at determining the correlation between patients' response to CBZ mono-therapy to Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms G2677T and C3435T of the ABCB1 gene as well as G1249A and −24C>T of the ABCC2 gene. Method 314 patients with CPS were recruited from the Neurology Department of the KLH based on stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria, of whom 152 were responders and the other 162 were non-responders. DNA was extracted from their blood samples and Taqman technology for allelic discrimination was performed. Results were described as genotype frequencies. The SHEsis analysis platform was used to calculate linkage disequilibrium index and infer haplotype frequencies. Haploview was used to do permutation test to obtain a corrected p-value. Results Resistance to treatment with CBZ mono-therapy was significantly associated with the 2677TT and the 3435TT genotypes while it was not significantly associated with the G1249A and −24C>T polymorphisms. The GCGC haplotype combination of the 2677G>T, 3435C>T, 1249G>A and −24C>T respectively was found to be extremely significant (p = 1.10e−20) with good drug response to CBZ mono-therapy. Conclusion Linkage disequilibrium between the 2677G>T, 3435C>T, 1249G>A and −24C>T SNPs may be used as a reliable screening marker to determine the treatment outcome of CBZ mono-therapy with CPS irrespective of race or gender."
https://openalex.org/W1994279153,"Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, and distinct classes of glutamate receptors coordinate synaptic transmission and spike generation upon various levels of neuronal activity. However, the mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we found that loss of synaptic AMPA receptors increased kainate receptor activity in cerebellar granule cells without changing NMDA receptors. The augmentation of kainate receptor-mediated currents in the absence of AMPA receptor activity is required for spike generation and is mediated by the increased expression of the GluK5 high-affinity kainate receptor subunit. Increase in GluK5 expression is sufficient to enhance kainate receptor activity by modulating receptor channel properties, but not localization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combined loss of the AMPA receptor auxiliary TARPγ-2 subunit and the GluK5 subunit leads to early mouse lethality. Our findings reveal mechanisms mediated by distinct classes of postsynaptic glutamate receptors for the homeostatic maintenance of the neuronal activity."

Lower, behavioral-stimulant doses enhance the cAMP response element-binding (CREB) signaling system, while higher, neurotoxic doses stimulate the p53 cytotoxic system.

https://openalex.org/W2088267698,"Sea otters (Enhydra lutris) are keystone predators that consume a variety of benthic invertebrates, including the intertidal mussel, Mytilus californianus. By virtue of their competitive dominance, large size, and longevity, M. californianus are ecosystem engineers that form structurally complex beds that provide habitat for diverse invertebrate communities. We investigated whether otters affect mussel bed characteristics (i.e. mussel length distributions, mussel bed depth, and biomass) and associated community structure (i.e. biomass, alpha and beta diversity) by comparing four regions that varied in their histories of sea otter occupancy on the west coast of British Columbia and northern Washington. Mussel bed depth and average mussel lengths were 1.5 times lower in regions occupied by otters for >20 years than those occupied for <5 yrs. Diversity of mussel bed associated communities did not differ between regions; however, the total biomass of species associated with mussel beds was more than three-times higher where sea otters were absent. We examined alternative explanations for differences in mussel bed community structure, including among-region variation in oceanographic conditions and abundance of the predatory sea star Pisaster ochraceus. We cannot discount multiple drivers shaping mussel beds, but our findings indicate the sea otters are an important one. We conclude that, similar to their effects on subtidal benthic invertebrates, sea otters reduce the size distributions of intertidal mussels and, thereby, habitat available to support associated communities. Our study indicates that by reducing populations of habitat-providing intertidal mussels, sea otters may have substantial indirect effects on associated communities."
https://openalex.org/W1986114804,"Background Low circulating vitamin D levels have been suggested to potentially contribute to acute complications in critically ill patients. However, in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), whether vitamin D deficiency occurs and is a potential contributor to worse early outcomes at the time of AKI diagnosis remains unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings Two hundred patients with AKI were enrolled in our study. Healthy subjects and critically ill patients without AKI served as controls. Serum vitamin D concentrations were measured in the three groups. The patients with AKI were followed up for 90 days and grouped according to median serum vitamin D concentrations. In addition, vitamin D receptor polymorphisms (BsmI and FokI) were measured in these patients; they were also followed up for 90 days and grouped according to vitamin D receptor gene mutations. Low serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels (59.56±53.00 pmol/L) were detected in patients with AKI and decreased with increasing severity of AKI. There were no significant findings with respect to 25-hydroxyvitamin D. The 90-day survival curves of individuals with high vitamin D concentrations showed no significant differences compared with the curves of individuals with low concentrations. The survival curves of patients with BB/Bb or FF/Ff genotypes also showed no significant differences compared with patients with bb or ff genotypes. In Cox regression analysis, the vitamin D status in patients with AKI was not an independent prognostic factor as adjusted by age, sex, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, or vitamin D receptor polymorphisms. Conclusions/Significance Patients with AKI manifested a marked decrease in the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level at the time of AKI diagnosis, and the degree of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D deficiency increased with the severity of AKI. No association between the serum vitamin D level at the time of AKI diagnosis and 90-day all-cause mortality was found in patients with AKI."
https://openalex.org/W2002178034,"Background In Ethiopia where tuberculosis epidemic remains high, studies that describe hotspots of the disease are unavailable. This study tried to detect the spatial distribution and clustering of smear-positive tuberculosis cases in Dabat, Ethiopia. Methods and Findings A population-based cross sectional study conducted in the Dabat Health and Demographic Surveillance System site from October 2010 to September 2011 identified smear-positive tuberculosis cases. Trained field workers collected demographic and location data from each study participant through house-to-house visits. A spatial scan statistic was used to identify purely spatial and space–time clusters of tuberculosis among permanent residents. Two significant (p<0.001) spatial and space-time clusters were identified in the study district. Conclusion Tuberculosis is concentrated in certain geographic locations in Dabat, Ethiopia. This kind of clustering can be common in the country, so the National Tuberculosis Control Program can be more effective by identifying such clusters and targeting interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2032337584,"Species ranges are mediated by physiology, environmental factors, and competition with other organisms. The allopatric distribution of five species of northern Californian pocket gophers (Thomomys spp.) is hypothesized to result from competitive exclusion. The five species in this environmentally heterogeneous region separate into two subgenera, Thomomys or Megascapheus, which have divergent digging styles. While all pocket gophers dig with their claws, the tooth-digging adaptations of subgenus Megascapheus allow access to harder soils and climate-protected depths. In a Northern Californian locality, replacement of subgenus Thomomys with subgenus Megascapheus occurred gradually during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. Concurrent climate change over this transition suggests that environmental factors – in addition to soil – define pocket gopher distributional limits. Here we show 1) that all pocket gophers occupy the subset of less energetically costly soils and 2) that subgenera sort by percent soil clay, bulk density, and shrink-swell capacity (a mineralogical attribute). While clay and bulk density (without major perturbations) stay constant over decades to millennia, low precipitation and high temperatures can cause shrink-swell clays to crack and harden within days. The strong yet underappreciated interaction between soil and moisture on the distribution of vertebrates is rarely considered when projecting species responses to climatic change. Furthermore, increased precipitation alters the weathering processes that create shrink-swell minerals. Two projected outcomes of ongoing climate change—higher temperatures and precipitation—will dramatically impact hardness of soil with shrink-swell minerals. Current climate models do not include factors controlling soil hardness, despite its impact on all organisms that depend on a stable soil structure."
https://openalex.org/W2072380158,"Seedling establishment is a critical phase in the life of plants when they are the most vulnerable to environment. Growth arrest at post-germinative stage under stress is the major adaptive strategy to help germinating seedlings to survive a spectrum of stressful conditions. ABA signaling is the key pathway to control stress-induced developmental arrest. However, mechanisms controlling the phase transition under abiotic stress are not fully understood. Here, we described miR172b as a new key regulator controlling transition of germinating seedlings from heterotrophic to autotrophic growth under osmotic stress in Arabidopsis. We showed that miR172b and its target SNZ were co-expressed during early seedling development. Expression of miR172b and SNZ was low after radicle emergence and sharply increased at the checkpoint to autotrophic development under normal conditions. Interestingly, activation of miR172b and SNZ was completely abolished by ABA and osmotic stress. miR172b overexpression and snz-1 exhibited increased sensitivity to ABA and osmotic stress during specific post-germinative stage, and resulted in higher expression of ABI3, ABI5 and downstream genes, such as Em6 and RAB18, than wild type under ABA treatment. Our results revealed that miR172b is a critical regulator specifically controlling cotyledon greening during post-germinative growth by directly targeting SNZ under ABA treatment and osmotic stress."
https://openalex.org/W2001073443,"Background To examine the cost-effectiveness of providing laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) surgery to all morbidly obese adults in the 2003 Australian population. Methods and Findings Analyzed costs and benefits associated with two intervention scenarios, one providing LAGB surgery to individuals with BMI >40 and another to individuals with BMI >35, with each compared relative to a ‘do nothing’ scenario. A multi-state, multiple cohort Markov model was used to determine the cost-effectiveness of LAGB surgery over the lifetime of each cohort. All costs and health outcomes were assessed from an Australian health sector perspective and were discounted using a 3% annual rate. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyzes were conducted to test the robustness of model outcomes. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were measured in 2003 Australian dollars per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted. The ICER for the scenario providing LAGB surgery to all individuals with a BMI >40 was dominant [95% CI: dominant - $588] meaning that the intervention led to both improved health and cost savings. The ICER when providing surgery to those with a BMI >35 was $2 154/DALY averted [95% CI: dominant - $6 033]. Results were highly sensitive to changes in the likelihood of long-term complications. Conclusion LAGB surgery is highly cost-effective when compared to the $50 000/DALY threshold for cost-effectiveness used in Australia. LAGB surgery also ranks highly in terms of cost-effectiveness when compared to other population-level interventions for weight loss in Australia. The results of this study are in line with other economic evaluations on LAGB surgery. This study recommends that the Australian federal government provide a full subsidy for LAGB surgery to morbidly obese Australians with a BMI >40."
https://openalex.org/W1965867256,"Background A prolonged PR interval is a sign of increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia. Recent genome-wide association studies found that the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3825214 in T-box 5 (TBX5) was positively associated with PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, and common arrhythmia disorders such as atrial fibrillation (AF) and advanced atrioventricular block. However, other independent replication studies are required to validate the result. This study assessed associations between rs3825214 and ECG parameters, AF, and ventricular tachycardia (VT) in a Chinese Han population. Methodology/Principal Findings To assess the association between rs3825214 and AF and VT, we carried out case-control association studies with 692 AF patients (including 275 lone AF patients), 235 VT patients, and 856 controls. Genotyping was performed using a Rotor-Gene TM 6000 High Resolution Melt system. Statistical analyses of associations were adjusted for potential confounding factors. A moderate association was detected between rs3825214 and AF (Padj = 0.036, OR = 0.79) and a highly significant association was detected between the G allele of rs3825214 and lone AF (Padj = 0.001, OR = 0.65; genotypic P = 3.75×10−4 with a dominant model). We also found that rs3825214 showed a significant association with atrial-ventricular block (AVB; P = 0.028; Padj = 0.035, OR = 0.494). Conclusions Our results indicate that rs3825214 conferred a significant risk of lone AF in this Chinese Han population."
https://openalex.org/W1987051561,"This study presents the comparison of experimental results with assumptions used in numerical models. The aim of the field experiments is to test the linear relationship between different hydraulic parameters and soil detachment. For example correlations between shear stress, unit length shear force, stream power, unit stream power and effective stream power and the detachment rate does not reveal a single parameter which consistently displays the best correlation. More importantly, the best fit does not only vary from one experiment to another, but even between distinct measurement points. Different processes in rill erosion are responsible for the changing correlations. However, not all these procedures are considered in soil erosion models. Hence, hydraulic parameters alone are not sufficient to predict detachment rates. They predict the fluvial incising in the rill's bottom, but the main sediment sources are not considered sufficiently in its equations. The results of this study show that there is still a lack of understanding of the physical processes underlying soil erosion. Exerted forces, soil stability and its expression, the abstraction of the detachment and transport processes in shallow flowing water remain still subject of unclear description and dependence."
https://openalex.org/W2128133867,"Background Renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) are one of the main targets of inflammatory insults during interstitial nephritis and kidney transplant rejection. While Th1 cells are know to be essential in the pathogenesis of rejection, the role of Th17 is still under debate. We hypothesize that TECs modulate the outcome of rejection process by production of distinct chemokines and cytokines that determine the attraction of different T-cell subsets. Therefore, we studied differential effects of activated human renal epithelial cells on T-cell migration. Methods Human primary TECs were stimulated by IFN-γ and TNF-α in vitro. Chemokines and cytokines produced by activated TECs were measured using Luminex or ELISA. Chemotaxis assay was performed using activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells composed of CD4+CXCR3+ and CD4+CCR6+ T cells migrating towards stimulated and unstimulated TECs. Results While activated TECs secreted abundant amounts of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, the T helper cell differentiation cytokines IL-1β, IL-12p70, IL-23 or TGF-β1 were not produced. The production of Th1 chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10 and CCL5 were significantly upregulated after TEC stimulation. In contrast, Th17 chemokine CCL20 could not be detected. Finally, activated TECs attracted significantly higher numbers of CD4+CXCR3+ T cells as compared to unstimulated TECs. No migration of CD4+CCR6+ T cells could be observed. Conclusion Activated primary renal tubular epithelial cells do not attract Th17 cells nor produce cytokines promoting Th17 cell differentiation in our experimental system mimicking the proinflammatory microenvironment of rejection."
https://openalex.org/W2071373243,"Yeast cells can be killed upon expression of pro-apoptotic mammalian proteins. We have established a functional yeast survival screen that was used to isolate novel human anti-apoptotic genes overexpressed in treatment-resistant tumors. The screening of three different cDNA libraries prepared from metastatic melanoma, glioblastomas and leukemic blasts allowed for the identification of many yeast cell death-repressing cDNAs, including 28% of genes that are already known to inhibit apoptosis, 35% of genes upregulated in at least one tumor entity and 16% of genes described as both anti-apoptotic in function and upregulated in tumors. These results confirm the great potential of this screening tool to identify novel anti-apoptotic and tumor-relevant molecules. Three of the isolated candidate genes were further analyzed regarding their anti-apoptotic function in cell culture and their potential as a therapeutic target for molecular therapy. PAICS, an enzyme required for de novo purine biosynthesis, the long non-coding RNA MALAT1 and the MAST2 kinase are overexpressed in certain tumor entities and capable of suppressing apoptosis in human cells. Using a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model, we also demonstrated that glioblastoma tumor growth requires MAST2 expression. An additional advantage of the yeast survival screen is its universal applicability. By using various inducible pro-apoptotic killer proteins and screening the appropriate cDNA library prepared from normal or pathologic tissue of interest, the survival screen can be used to identify apoptosis inhibitors in many different systems."
https://openalex.org/W1980813857,"Methylglyoxal (MG), a highly reactive α-dicarbonyl metabolite of glucose degradation pathways, protein and fatty acid metabolism, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. Hyperglycemia triggers enhanced production of MG and increased generation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). In non-enzymatic reactions, MG reacts with arginine residues of proteins to form the AGEs argpyrimidine and hydroimidazolone. Glyoxalase 1 (GLO1), in combination with glyoxalase 2 and the co-factor glutathione constitute the glyoxalase system, which is responsible for the detoxification of MG. A GLO1 specific knock down results in accumulation of MG in targeted cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of intracellularly accumulated MG on insulin signaling and on the translocation of the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4). Therefore, L6 cells stably expressing a myc-tagged GLUT4 were examined. For the intracellular accumulation of MG, GLO1, the first enzyme of the glyoxalase pathway, was down regulated by siRNA knock down and cells were cultivated under hyperglycemic conditions (25 mM glucose) for 48 h. Here we show that GLO1 knock down augmented GLUT4 level on the cell surface of L6 myoblasts at least in part through reduction of GLUT4 internalization, resulting in increased glucose uptake. However, intracellular accumulation of MG had no effect on GLUT4 concentration or modification. The antioxidant and MG scavenger NAC prevented the MG-induced GLUT4 translocation. Tiron, which is also a well-known antioxidant, had no impact on MG-induced GLUT4 translocation."

We used our recently established monoclonal anti-rhesus macaque KIR antibodies in multicolour flow cytometry for phenotypic characterization of KIR protein expression on natural killer (NK) cells and T cell subsets of rhesus macaques, cynomolgus macaques, hamadryas baboons, and African green monkeys. Similar to human KIR, we found clonal expression patterns of KIR on NK and T cell subsets in rhesus macaques and differences between individuals using pan-KIR3D antibody 1C7 and antibodies specific for single KIR. Similar results were obtained with lymphocytes from the other studied species. Notably, African green monkeys show only a low frequency of KIR3D expressed on CD8+ αβT cells. Contrasting human NK cells are KIR-positive CD56bright NK cells and frequencies of KIR-expressing NK cells that are independent of the presence of their cognate MHC class I ligands in rhesus macaques. Interestingly, the frequency of KIR-expressing cells and the expression strength of KIR3D are correlated in γδ T cells of rhesus macaques and CD8+ αβT cells of baboons."
https://openalex.org/W2081206938,"Background This study aimed to understand the role of myeloid cell clusters in uninvolved regional lymph nodes from early stage non-small cell lung cancer patients. Methods Uninvolved regional lymph node sections from 67 patients with stage I–III resected non-small cell lung cancer were immunostained to detect myeloid clusters, STAT3 activity and occult metastasis. Anthracosis intensity, myeloid cluster infiltration associated with anthracosis and pSTAT3 level were scored and correlated with patient survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed with prognostic variables. Human macrophages were used for in vitro nicotine treatment. Results CD68+ myeloid clusters associated with anthracosis and with an immunosuppressive and metastasis-promoting phenotype and elevated overall STAT3 activity were observed in uninvolved lymph nodes. In patients with a smoking history, myeloid cluster score significantly correlated with anthracosis intensity and pSTAT3 level (P<0.01). Nicotine activated STAT3 in macrophages in long-term culture. CD68+ myeloid clusters correlated and colocalized with occult metastasis. Myeloid cluster score was an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.049) and was associated with survival by Kaplan-Maier estimate in patients with a history of smoking (P = 0.055). The combination of myeloid cluster score with either lymph node stage or pSTAT3 level defined two populations with a significant difference in survival (P = 0.024 and P = 0.004, respectively). Conclusions Myeloid clusters facilitate a pro-metastatic microenvironment in uninvolved regional lymph nodes and associate with occult metastasis in early stage non-small cell lung cancer. Myeloid cluster score is an independent prognostic factor for survival in patients with a history of smoking, and may present a novel method to inform therapy choices in the adjuvant setting. Further validation studies are warranted."

Each subtype exhibited specific characteristics of internalization and distribution between these pools that determines their signaling pathways: α(1A)-ARs, when located in the plasma membrane, signal through calcium and ERK1/2 pathways but, when translocated to deeper endosomes, through a mechanism sensitive to β-arrestin and concanavalin A, continue signaling through ERK1/2 and also activate the p38 pathway. α(1B)-ARs signal through calcium and ERK1/2 only when located in the membrane and the signals disappear after endocytosis and by disruption of the membrane lipid rafts by methyl-β-cyclodextrin."
https://openalex.org/W1965327138,"The ability of memory CD8+ T cells to rapidly proliferate and acquire cytolytic activity is critical for protective immunity against intracellular pathogens. The signals that control this recall response remain unclear. We show that CD40L production by memory CD8+ T cells themselves is an essential catalyst for secondary expansion when systemic inflammation is limited. Secondary immunization accompanied by high levels of systemic inflammation results in CD8+ T cell secondary expansion independent of CD4+ T cells and CD40-CD40L signaling. Conversely, when the inflammatory response is limited, memory CD8+ T cell secondary expansion requires CD40L-producing cells, and memory CD8+ T cells can provide this signal. These results demonstrate that vaccination regimens differ in their dependence on CD40L-expressing CD8+ T cells for secondary expansion, and propose that CD40L-expression by CD8+ T cells is a fail-safe mechanism that can promote memory CD8+ T cell secondary expansion when inflammation is limited."
https://openalex.org/W2121484053,"Most fruits and other highly color-diagnostic objects have color as a central aspect of their identity, which can facilitate detection and visual recognition. It has been theorized that there may be a large amount of overlap between the neural representations of these objects and processing involved in color perception. In accordance with this theory we sought to determine if the recognition of highly color diagnostic fruit objects could be facilitated by the visual presentation of their known color associates. In two experiments we show that color associate priming is possible, but contingent upon multiple factors. Color priming was found to be maximally effective for the most highly color diagnostic fruits, when low spatial-frequency information was present in the image, and when determination of the object's specific identity, not merely its category, was required. These data illustrate the importance of color for determining the identity of certain objects, and support the theory that object knowledge involves sensory specific systems."
https://openalex.org/W2030191241,"This study examined trends in premarital sex, multiple partnership and condom use among young people (15-24 years) in Zambia from 2000 to 2009, and assessed the effects of individual and neighbourhood variables on these sexual behaviour indicators in 2000 and 2009.We analysed data from the Zambia Sexual Behaviour Survey, conducted in 2000, 2003, 2005 and 2009. Multi-stage cluster sampling was used to select 385 neighbourhoods, giving a population sample of 6,500 young people. Using linear-by-linear trend test, trends in the three indicators were examined. Multilevel logistic regression was used to assess the effects of individual and neighbourhood variables on the indicators.Premarital sex among young people decreased significantly from 51 to 42% between 2000 and 2009. Multiple partnerships of men also decreased from 26 to 14% during the same period. The use of condoms by young people remained stable during this period. Full multilevel regression models explained 29 and 34% of the neighbourhood variance of premarital sex in 2000 and 2009. For multiple partnerships and condom use, the explained variance was 29 and 18% in 2000; whereas in 2009 it was extremely low. Urban residence and living in neighbourhood with higher average duration of residence were associated with low premarital sex and higher condom use. Living in a neighbourhood with higher average level of comprehensive knowledge of HIV was associated with less risky sexual behaviour.Declining trends in premarital sex and multiple partnerships are among the factors that might explain the decrease in HIV incidence in Zambia among young people. However, condom use among young people has remained low and stable over the years. The results also suggest that behaviour change interventions should take stock of the social context when introducing individual-level programmes because neighbourhood factors play a considerable role in influencing sexual behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2048922599,"Post-cardiac arrest myocardial dysfunction is a major cause of mortality in patients receiving successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Mild therapeutic hypothermia (MTH) is the recommended treatment after resuscitation from cardiac arrest (CA) and is known to exert neuroprotective effects and improve short-term survival. Yet its cytoprotective mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, our aim was to determine the possible effect of MTH on vasoactive mediators belonging to the endothelin/nitric oxide axis in our porcine model of CA and CPR. Pigs underwent either untreated CA or CA with subsequent CPR. After state-of-the-art resuscitation, the animals were either left untreated, cooled between 32–34°C after ROSC or treated with a bolus injection of S-PBN (sodium 4-[(tert-butylimino) methyl]benzene-3-sulfonate N-oxide) until 180 min after ROSC, respectively. The expression of endothelin 1 (ET-1), endothelin converting enzyme 1 (ECE-1), and endothelin A and B receptors (ETAR and ETBR) transcripts were measured using quantitative real-time PCR while protein levels for the ETAR, ETBR and nitric oxide synthases (NOS) were assessed using immunohistochemistry and Western Blot. Our results indicated that the endothelin system was not upregulated at 30, 60 and 180 min after ROSC in untreated postcardiac arrest syndrome. Post-resuscitative 3 hour-long treatments either with MTH or S-PBN stimulated ET-1, ECE-1, ETAR and ETBR as well as neuronal NOS and endothelial NOS in left ventricular cardiomyocytes. Our data suggests that the endothelin and nitric oxide pathways are activated by MTH in the heart."

The latter is characterized by strong activation of coagulation. Currently no reliable non-invasive biomarkers are available to monitor rejection. Renal biopsies were available from 81 renal transplant patients (33 without rejection, 26 TCMR and 22 ABMR), we had access to mRNA material, matched plasma and urine samples for a portion of this cohort. Renal EPCR expression was assessed by RT-PCR and immunostaining. Plasma and urine sEPCR levels were measured by ELISA. ABMR patients showed higher levels of EPCR mRNA than TCMR patients. EPCR expression on glomeruli was significantly elevated in ABMR patients than in TCMR or control patients. In the peritubular capillaries EPCR expression was higher in ABMR patients than in control patients. EPCR expression was higher in tubules and arteries of rejection patients than in control patients. Plasma sEPCR levels did not differ. Urine sEPCR levels were more elevated in the ABMR group than in patients with TCMR or without rejection. ROC analysis demonstrated that urinary sEPCR is appropriate to discriminate between ABMR patients and TCMR or control patients. We conclude that urinary sEPCR could be a novel non-invasive biomarker of antibody mediated rejection in renal transplantation."

Increased extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and reorganization affect MEC morphogenesis in a Rho GTPase-dependent manner. Although the effects of altered ECM on MEC morphogenesis have been described, how MECs regulate stromal deposition is not well understood. Previously, we showed that p190B RhoGAP overexpression disrupts mammary gland morphogenesis by inducing hyperbranching in association with stromal alterations. We therefore hypothesized that MEC overexpression of p190B regulates paracrine interactions to impact fibroblast activation. Using a combination of in vivo morphometric and immunohistochemical analyses and primary cell culture assays, we found that p190B overexpression in MECs activates fibroblasts leading to increased collagen, fibronectin, and laminin production and elevated expression of the collagen crosslinking enzyme lysyl oxidase. Phosphorylation of the TGF-β effector SMAD2 and expression of the TGF-β target gene αSma were increased in p190B-associated fibroblasts, suggesting that elevated TGF-β signaling promoted fibroblast activation. Mechanical tension and TGF-β cooperate to activate fibroblasts. Interestingly, active TGF-β was elevated in conditioned medium from p190B overexpressing MECs compared to control MECs, and p190B overexpressing MECs exhibited increased contractility in a collagen gel contraction assay. These data suggest that paracrine signaling from the p190B overexpressing MECs may activate TGF-β signaling in adjacent fibroblasts. In support of this, transfer of conditioned medium from p190B overexpressing MECs onto wildtype fibroblasts or co-culture of p190B overexpressing MECs with wildtype fibroblasts increased SMAD2 phosphorylation and mRNA expression of ECM genes in the fibroblasts when compared to fibroblasts treated with control CM or co-cultured with control MECs. The increased ECM gene expression and SMAD2 phosphorylation were blocked by treatment with a TGF-β receptor inhibitor. Taken together, these data suggest that p190B overexpression in the mammary epithelium induces fibroblast activation via elevated TGF-β paracrine signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1983743377,"The insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), commonly associated with many diseases, is believed to have affected human adaptation to environmental changes during the out-of-Africa expansion. APOBEC3B (A3B), a member of the cytidine deaminase family APOBEC3s, also exhibits a variable gene insertion/deletion polymorphism across world populations. Using data available from published reports, we examined the global geographic distribution of ACE and A3B genotypes. In tracking the modern human dispersal routes of these two genes, we found that the variation trends of the two I/D polymorphisms were directly correlated. We observed that the frequencies of ACE insertion and A3B deletion rose in parallel along the expansion route. To investigate the presence of a correlation between the two polymorphisms and the effect of their interaction on human health, we analyzed 1199 unrelated Chinese adults to determine their genotypes and other important clinical characteristics. We discovered a significant difference between the ACE genotype/allele distribution in the A3B DD and A3B II/ID groups (P = 0.045 and 0.015, respectively), indicating that the ACE Alu I allele frequency in the former group was higher than in the latter group. No specific clinical phenotype could be associated with the interaction between the ACE and A3B I/D polymorphisms. A3B has been identified as a powerful inhibitor of Alu retrotransposition, and primate A3 genes have undergone strong positive selection (and expansion) for restricting the mobility of endogenous retrotransposons during evolution. Based on these findings, we suggest that the ACE Alu insertion was enabled (facilitated) by the A3B deletion and that functional loss of A3B provided an opportunity for enhanced human adaptability and survival in response to the environmental and climate challenges arising during the migration from Africa."
https://openalex.org/W1964553670,"Polypyrimidine tract-binding (PTB) proteins are RNA-binding proteins that generally contain four RNA recognition motifs (RRMs). In potato, six cDNAs encoding full-length PTB proteins have been identified. In the present study Nova1-like protein, designated StNova1, was identified as a potential interacting partner of the StPTB proteins via yeast two-hybrid screening. Nova protein is a RNA-binding protein that contains three K-homology (KH) domains. In humans, these proteins are involved in regulation of neuronal RNA metabolism but the role of Nova-like proteins in plants is poorly understood. We have validated this interaction and mapped the protein binding region on StNova1 and StPTB1 and −6 using a novel domain interaction phage display (DIPP) technique. The interaction between the two RNA-binding proteins StPTB1/6 and StNova1 is mediated through linker regions that are distinctly separated from the RRMs. Furthermore, using a random 21-mer phage-peptide library, we have identified a number of peptides with the consensus sequence motif [S/G][V/I][L/V]G that recognize the StPTB proteins. One over-represented peptide that recognizes StPTB6 contains the GVLGPWP sequence that is similar to the GIGGRYP sequence in the glycine-rich linker region between the KH2 and KH3 domains of StNova1. We show, through site-specific mutations, the importance of glycine and proline residues in StNova1-StPTB interactions."
