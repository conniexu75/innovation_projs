https://openalex.org/W2094557223,"Primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes were treated in the presence or absence of extracellular calcium with ten different membrane-active toxins. In all cases more than half the cells were killed in 1 to 6 hours in the presence but not in the absence of extracellular calcium. An effect of calcium on the primary mechanism of membrane injury by any of the agents cannot be implicated. Viability, as determined by trypan blue exclusion correlated well with other indices of viability such as plating efficiency and the hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate. It is concluded that the cells are killed by processes that involve at least two steps. In each type of injury, disruption of the integrity of the plasma membrane by widely differing mechanisms is followed by a common functional consequence involving extracellular calcium, and most likely representing an influx of calcium across the damaged plasma membrane and down a steep concentration gradient. This later step represents, or at least initiates, a final common pathway for the toxic death of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1788190869,"Thioredoxin from Escherichia coli was shown to catalyze the reduction of insulin disulfides by dithiothreitol. A quantitative assay was developed which measures the rate of insulin reduction spectrophotometrically at 650 nm as turbidity formation from the precipitation of the free insulin B chain. Thioredoxin, at 5 microM concentration, accelerated the reaction between 0.130 mM insulin and 1.0 mM dithiothreitol at pH 7 around 20-fold. The pH optimum of the reaction was 7.5. Thioredoxins from E. coli and calf liver showed similar specific activities. Stopped flow fluorescence measurements of the rate of reduction of thioredoxin-S2 by dithiothreitol showed a second order rate constant of 1647 M-1 s-1 at pH 7.2. This is between 10(2) to 10(3) times larger than the reaction between insulin or linear model disulfides and dithiothreitol. It is consistent with a ping-pong mechanism of thioredoxin catalysis since reduced thioredoxin is known to react very fast with insulin. Thioredoxin also catalyzed lipoamide-dependent reduction of the insulin disulfides in a coupled system with NADH, lipoamide, and lipoamide dehydrogenase. The fast spontaneous reaction between dihydrolipoamide and thioredoxin-S2 provides a mechanism for NADH or pyruvate-dependent disulfide reduction. The implication of the dithiol-disulfide oxidoreductase activity of thioredoxin for the regulation of enzyme activities by thiol oxidation-reduction control is discussed."

Such processes terminate on other cell types, including gastrin-producing and hydrochloric acid-producing cells, whose functions are profoundly affected by somatostatin. The findings suggest that somatostatin cells control the functions of other cells through local release of the peptide by way of cytoplasmic processes. Also, certain other types of gastrointestinal endocrine cells have similar cytoplasmic prolongations, which may have analogous local (paracrine) regulatory functions."

https://openalex.org/W1992311449,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains 50-100 copies per cell of a circular plasmid called 2 micron DNA. Replication of this DNA was studied in two ways. The distribution of replication events among 2 micron DNA molecules was examined by density transfer experiments with asynchronous cultures. The data show that 2 micron DNA replication is similar to chromosomal DNA replication: essentially all 2 micron duplexes were of hybrid density at one cell doubling after the density transfer, with the majority having one fully dense strand and one fully light strand. The results show that replication of 2 micron DNA occurs by a semiconservative mechanism where each of the plasmid molecules replicates once each cell cycle. 2 micron DNA is the only known example of a multiple-copy, extrachromosomal DNA in which every molecule replicates in each cell cycle. Quantitative analysis of the data indicates that 2 micron DNA replication is limited to a fraction of the cell cycle. The period in the cell cycle when 2 micron DNA replicates was examined directly with synchronous cell cultures. Synchronization was accomplished by sequentially arresting cells in G1 phase using the yeast pheromone alpha-factor and incubating at the restrictive temperature for a cell cycle (cdc 7) mutant. Replication was monitored by adding 3H-uracil to cells previously labeled with 14C-uracil, and determining the 3H/14C ratio for purified DNA species. 2 micron DNA replication did not occur during the G1 arrest periods. However, the population of 2 micron DNA doubled during the synchronous S phase at the permissive temperature, with most of the replication occurring in the first third of S phase. Our results indicate that a mechanism exists which insures that the origin of replication of each 2 micron DNA molecule is activated each S phase. As with chromosomal DNA, further activation is prevented until the next cell cycle. We propose that the mechanism which controls the replication initiation of each 2 micron DNA molecule is identical to that which controls the initiation of chromosomal DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1603629403,"The complete nucleotide sequence of the coding, as well as the flanking noncoding regions, of a yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene was determined. Both the 5' and 3' noncoding sequences are extremely AT-rich and regions of partial dyad symmetry are present immediately adjacent to the 5' and 3' ends of the translated portion of the gene. The sequence AAUAAA is present in the 3' noncoding region of this gene and is a part of an extensive region of dyad symmetry which is structurally related to the 3'-terminal portion of both procaryotic mRNAs, as well as some eukaryotic mRNAs. The coding region of this gene does not contain intervening sequences. Establishment of the primary structure of this glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene provides a basis for further studies involving in vitro mutation of the gene and subsequent analysis of gene expression in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2094861116,"Ultraviolet irradiation forms covalent crosslinks between E. coli RNA polymerase and the lac UV5 promoter substituted with bromouracil in the place of thymine. I have determined the polymerase subunit and the base within the promoter sequence that are joined to each other in two such crosslinks. The sigma and beta subunits of RNA polymerase, respectively, are crosslinked to the third base upstream (-3) and the second base downstream (+3) from the starting point of transcription (+1). Both bases are on the nontemplate strand of the promoter DNA. The location of the beta subunit suggests that it forms at least part of the catalytic site of the enzyme. The disposition of sigma suggests that this subunit plays a direct role in unwinding the DNA at the promoter. The sigma crosslink is close to the ""Pribnow Box,"" which is centered about 10 bases upstream from the RNA start site, contains a striking homology between promoters and is the locus of many promoter mutations."

https://openalex.org/W2059259370,"We have identified a new 75 amino acid polypeptide (L protein) following f2 phage infection of E. coli. It is encoded by an out-of-phase overlapping gene which begins within the coat protein gene, ends in the replicase gene and covers the 36 base intercistronic space between them. A mutant f2 phage carrying a UGA mutation (op3), which complements mutations in the other three f2 genes (coat, A protein and replicase), fails to lyse cells ( Model et al., 1979 Model P. Webster R.E. Zinder N.D. Characterization of op3, a lysis defective mutant of bacteriophage f2. Cell. 1979; 18: 235-246 Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar ) and also fails to produce L protein. Both lysis and L protein are restored following op3 infection of a UGA suppressor-containing strain or infection of wild-type bacteria with a revertant of op3. L protein is found in the insoluble fraction of artificially lysed cells. In this paper, we present the time course of its synthesis relative to the other f2-coded polypeptides: L protein synthesis increases as replicase synthesis decreases. We also report the discovery of another phage-coded polypeptide, which appears to be the product of a novel mode of translation: initiation at the coat protein initiation site, followed by translational frame shifting into the L protein frame and termination at the L protein terminus."

https://openalex.org/W2097983426,"We have studied the biogenesis of the envelope of E. coli B/r by measuring the synthesis of protein in separated inner and outer membranes during the cell cycle. While total protein and bulk inner membrane protein were synthesized continuously and at an exponentially increasing rate throughout the cycle, bulk outer membrane protein was synthesized at a constant rate throughout the cycle with an abrupt doubling in rate occurring 10–15 min before division. A similar pattern was observed when the rate of synthesis of an individual protein, the 36.5K outer membrane protein, was measured directly in total cell lysates. Neither thymine starvation nor changes in gene dosage of exponential cultures affected the synthesis of outer membrane protein, indicating that the doubling in rate is not controlled by a gene duplication mechanism. Other findings, however, further indicate that outer membrane protein synthesis is regulated in some way. Thus the concentration of 36.5K porin per unit surface area remained constant as the surface area/volume ratio varied widely with growth rate. We also obtained direct evidence for an overall limitation on the rate of synthesis of bulk outer membrane proteins; when a new class of outer membrane proteins was induced, the rate of synthesis of other surface proteins was correspondingly reduced. On the basis of these results, we discuss a model in which the linear growth of outer membrane protein results from a limitation of outer membrane polypeptide synthesis at the translational level, reflecting the linear expansion of the underlying peptidoglycan layer in the envelope."
https://openalex.org/W1521681338,"The effect of the presence or absence of methyl groups on the N6 atoms of two adjacent adenosines near the 3' end of 16 S rTNA of Escherichia coli on initiation of protein biosynthesis has been studied using wild type (methylated) and kasugamycin-resistant (unmethylated) E. coli ribosomes (see preceding paper (Poldermans, B., Goosen, N., and Van Knippenberg, P. H. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 9085--9089)). Conditions of pH, temperature, and ionic strength at which binding of fMet-tRNA to ribosomes proceeds maximally are the same for wild type and mutant ribosomes. Mg2+- and factor-dependent dissociation of ribosomes as well as the association of the subunits is also the same for methylated and unmethylated ribosomes. Binding of fMet-tRNA to wild type and to mutant 70 S ribosomes requires the same amount of the three initiation factors. However, optimal fMet-tRNA binding to unmethylated 30 S ribosomes needs more of initiation factor 3 than does binding to methylated 30 S ribosomes, provided that initiation factor 1 is absent. This difference is completely abolished when mutant 30 S ribosomes are methylated using purified methylase from the wild type strain and the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine."
https://openalex.org/W1543086202,"Experiments were performed to assess the role of the fadL gene in Escherichia coli. These studies have revealed that this organism requires a functional fadL gene in order to (i) transport optimally the fatty acids C10 to C18:1 into the cell, (ii) optimally grow on and oxidize C10 to C18:1 fatty acids, and (iii) incorporate efficiently C12 to C18:1 fatty acids into its membrane phospholipids. A defect in the fadL gene does not prevent E. coli from optimally utilizing fatty acids with chain lengths less than 10 carbon atoms. These results suggest that the fadL gene governs a transport component(s) which is required for the optimal transport of fatty acids with chain lengths greater than 9 carbon atoms."

(1979) J. Bacteriol. 137, 686-688). Previous work has shown that these oligosaccharides contain sn-1-glycero-P and smaller amounts of phosphoethanolamine, derived from membrane phospholipids, attached to position 6 of certain of the glucose residues. The structure of the parent oligosaccharides (obtained by reduction with borohydride followed by alkaline hydrolysis) has now been studied. The oligosaccharide was permethylated, followed by hydrolysis and conversion of the products to methylated glucitol acetates, which were then analyzed and identified by gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The membrane oligosaccharides contain 10 to 12 D-glucopyranoside residues/mol, linked solely by 1 yields 2 and 1 yields 6 bonds. They are highly branched structures, with four nonreducing termini per mol. Glucose units at the branch points are doubly substituted at positions 2 and 6. The low specific rotation of the oligosaccharide (+8.3 degrees) indicates that the glycosidic bonds are predominantly or entirely beta."
https://openalex.org/W1516923509,"Abstract The oligosaccharides previously bound to dolichol diphosphate were isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells incubated with [U-14C]glucose. Five compounds were obtained that migrated with RGlucose of 0.100, 0.120, 0.145, 0.180, and 0.215 on paper chromatography. All of them contained mannose and 2 N-acetylhexosamine residues. The substances that migrated with the three lower RGlucose values had, addition, glucose units. The structure of the oligosacchardies was very similar if not identical with that of the oligosaccharides isolated from the dolichol diphosphate derivatives synthesized in vitro by yeast or rat liver particulate preparations or in vivo by dog thyroid or rat liver slices as judged by their migration on paper chromatography, monosaccharide composition, and degradation compounds produced by alpha-mannosidase treatment or acetolysis. The oligosaccharides previously bound to asparagine residues proteins were isolated from yeast cells which had been pulsed with [U-14C]glucose and chased with medium containing the unlabeled monosaccharide. The samples taken after very short pulses contained four oligosaccharides that migrated with RGlucose of 0.100, 0.120, 0.145, and 0.180 on paper chromatography. The first three compounds contained glucose, mannose, and 2 N-acetylhexosamine residues whereas the one that migrated with a RGlucose of 0.180 was devoid of the former monosaccharide. Samples taken after short chase periods revealed that the compounds that migrated with the lower RGlucose values gradually disappeared and were converted to the oligosaccharide with the higher RGlucose value was they lost their glucose residues. Similar analysis as those mentioned above showed that the structures of these compounds were similar to those of the dolichol diphosphate-bound oligosaccharides. Samples taken after longer chase periods revealed that the oligosaccharide that migrated with a RGlucose of 0.180 was subsequently either enlarged by the addition of more mannose residues or trimmed to smaller sizes."

Known differences between organism and host with respect to metabolism and polymer structure point to the detailed characterization of key proteins as the focus for the development of potential inhibitors. In the last decade, the methodology of the isolation, characterization, and inactivation of proteins and enzymes has been advanced. The present scientific and technological base suggests that new efforts toward the development of selective chemotherapeutic agents for infections caused by bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and higher eukaryotes should exploit the known differences in proteins or other specific biopolymers serving crucial structural or metabolic roles in the economy of the parasite."

https://openalex.org/W2167975047,"Abstract The Col E1-derivative copy number mutant plasmid pOP1Δ6 has been used to investigate the control of plasmid replication. pOP1Δ6 normally exists at about 200 copies per chromosome, while the wild-type plasmid from which it was derived (pBGP120) exists at about 15 copies per chromosome. We have observed that in E. coli containing both pOP1Δ6 and pBGP120, the copy number of pOP1Δ6 is lowered to 4–6 copies per chromosome. Thus the mutation in pOP1Δ6 is recessive. The association between the two plasmids is stable in E. coli, indicating that incompatibility properties as well as replication control characteristics have been altered in pOP1Δ6. Co-residence of the unrelated plasmid pSC101 with pOP1Δ6 has no detectable effect on pOP1Δ6 copy number. These results suggest that a plasmid-specific, diffusible repressor may act negatively to control plasmid copy number, and that pOP1Δ6 produces a defective repressor or is altered in repressor synthesis. We have constructed in vitro a plasmid which is identical in size to pQP1Δ6 but contains a replication origin region derived from pBGP120. Since this plasmid, pNOP1, exists stably (like pBGP120) at 10–15 copies per chromosome, the high copy number of pOP1Δ6 is not related to its reduced size relative to pBGP120. To localize the mutation in pOP1Δ6 responsible for DNA overproduction, we have cloned fragments of pBGP120 into pOP1Δ6 and selected for plasmids with wild-type copy number. We find that a 2.0 kb region of pBGP120 DNA surrounding the origin of plasmid DNA replication is capable of suppressing the DNA overproducer phenotype of pOP1Δ6. The 2.0 kb fragment is capable of independent self-replication or can integrate into pOP1Δ6 in vivo to form a composite plasmid with two origins of replication. The overproducer phenotype of pOP1Δ6 is suppressed in either configuration."
https://openalex.org/W1577397205,"In Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) is methylated as shown by its incorporation of labeled methyl residues from [methyl-3H]methionine. Analysis of the nature of the methyl-containing residues by protein hydrolysis, followed by paper chromatography and high voltage electrophoresis showed that both mono- and dimethyllysine are present. Eighty per cent of the EF-Tu molecules are methylated if methylation occurs at a unique lysine residue. The EF-Tu fraction which is not methylated is still able to accept methyl groups, as shown by methylation of approximately 10% of the EF-Tu after addition of chloramphenicol (D-(-)-threo-2,2-dichloro-N-[beta-hydroxy-alpha-(hydroxymethyl)-o-nitrophenethyl] acetamide) to inhibit further protein synthesis. There is no evidence of turnover of the methyl residues.

https://openalex.org/W1493630154,"Abstract When Escherichia coli 30 S ribosomal subunits are reacted with protein-protein bifunctional reagents, a number of protein pairs as well as aggregates containing three or more ribosomal proteins are formed. In the present study we have purified one of the protein pairs obtained by reaction of 30 S ribosomal subunits with either radioactive or nonradioactive dimethylsuberimidate. Following molecular weight determination and ammonolysis, the pair was shown to consist of ribosomal proteins S5 and S8. The native structure of the complex was surmised from its capacity to be reconstituted into a biologically active 30 S ribosomal subunit. From peptide maps and primary structure determination of various peptides it was demonstrated that the cross-linking bond between ribosomal proteins S5 and S8 involves primarily the residues Lys-93 of protein S8 and the COOH-terminal lysine (Lys-166) of ribosomal protein S5. This result is substantiated by the finding that a mutant carrying an altered S5 lacking the COOH-terminal lysine yields a greatly reduced amount of S5-S8 cross-link. In addition to the points of cross-linking it was found that Lys-30, Lys-68, and Lys-86 of S8 and Lys-5 of S5 react with dimethylsuberimidate, indicating that these residues are available for reaction and suggesting their topographical localization on the ribosomal surface."

With the aid of an antibody against cytochrome b, we identified the cytochrome b-cross-reacting polypeptides of respiration-deficient mutants mapping either in coding or intervening sequences of the cytochrome b gene. Most mutations in the coding regions caused the accumulation of a single apocytochrome b fragment whose apparent molecular weight (12,000 to 26,600) depended on the map position of the mutation. In contrast, mutations in putative intervening sequences often led to multiple new polypeptides immunologically related to apocytochrome b. Some of these abnormal polypeptides were considerably larger than wild type apocytochrome b. This suggests that mutations in intervening sequences can thus generate aberrant polypeptide products."

https://openalex.org/W1517989579,"The structure of ribosomal 5 S RNA has been examined using several physical biochemical techniques. Hydrodynamic measurements yield a s020,omega and [eta] of 5.5 x 10(-13) x and 6.9 ml/g, respectively. Other parameters calculated from these values indicate the shape of 5 S RNA is consistent with that of a prolate ellipsoid 160 A in length and 32 A wide. Sedimentation equilibrium results show that 5 S RNA exists as a monomer in the reconstitution buffer with an apparent molecular weight of 44,000. Ultraviolet absorption difference spectra show that approximately 75% of the bases in 5 S RNA are involved in base pairing, and of these base pairs 70% are G-C and 30% are A-U. These results on the overall shape and secondary structure of 5 S RNA have been incorporated with the results of other investigators as to the possible location of single-stranded and double-stranded helical regions, and a molecular model for 5 S RNA is proposed. The molecular model consists of three double helices in the shape of a prolate ellipsoid, with two of the double helical regions at one end of the molecule. The structure is consistent with the available data on the structure and function of 5 S RNA and bears similarity to the molecular model proposed by Osterberg et al. ((1976) Eur. J.

https://openalex.org/W1525651958,"Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate rapidly abolished the DNA-hydrolyzing activities as well as DNA-dependent ATP-ase activity of the recBC enzyme of Escherichia coli. Pyridoxal also had an inhibitory effect on the enzyme but less effective than that of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. Pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate, pyridoxamine, or pyridoxine had no effect on the activities of the enzyme. The inhibition was rapidly reversed by dilution but could be made irreversible by reduction with sodium borohydride prior to dilution. This suggests the formation of Schiff base between pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and an epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue which is essential for the enzyme activity. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate is a competitive inhibitor of DNA substrate but not of ATP. Furthermore, the presence of DNA substrate protected the enzyme from inactivation by the reduction but the presence of ATP showed no effect. Thus, the recBC enzyme appears to have an essential lysine residue at or near the DNA binding site of the enzyme, and the enzyme possesses two independent catalytic sites, such as a DNA binding site and an ATP binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1579310715,"A mutation in the ilvU locus of Escherichia coli has led to a complex phenotype that included resistance to thiaisoleucine, a loss of derepressibility of isoleucyl tRNA synthetase, and an alteration of the RPC-5 chromatographic profile of the branched-chain aminoacyl-tRNA's. The alterations were manifest in an increase in the amount of Species 2 of both tRNAIle and tRNAVal at the expense of Species 1. A similar alteration, but independent of (and additive to) that caused by the ilvU mutation, was observed upon limitation of either isoleucine or valine. The shift in profile caused by limitation was also independent of the reduced growth rate or the derepression of the isoleucine and valine biosynthetic enzymes that also result from limitation. During chloramphenicol treatment nearly all tRNAIle and tRNAVal formed appears as species 2. Upon recovery from chloramphenicol, Species 2 of both acceptors are converted to Species 1. It is proposed that the ilvU product not only allows derepression of isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase but also retards the conversion of tRNA2Ile to tRNA1Ile and that of tRNA2Val to tRNA1Val. The mutated ilvU loci abolish the derepression and are more efficient in retarding the conversion."
