https://openalex.org/W2803058542,"Turing structures at the nanoscale Turing structures arise when imbalances in diffusion rates make a stable steady-state system sensitive to small heterogeneous perturbations. For example, Turing patterns occur in chemical reactions when a fast-moving inhibitor controls the motion of a slower-moving activator. Tan et al. grew polyamide membranes by using interfacial polymerization, where the reactions occur at the interface between oil and water layers. The addition of polyvinyl alcohol to the aqueous phase reduced the diffusion of the monomer. This process generates membranes with more bumps, voids, and islands, which prove to be better for water desalination. Science , this issue p. 518"

These so-called magnetic tunnel junctions, used in electronics, must be carefully engineered. Two groups now show that high magnetoresistance intrinsically occurs in samples of the layered material CrI 3 sandwiched between graphite contacts. By varying the number of layers in the samples, Klein et al. and Song et al. found that the electrical current running perpendicular to the layers was largest in high magnetic fields and smallest near zero field. This observation is consistent with adjacent layers naturally having opposite magnetizations, which align parallel to each other in high magnetic fields. Science , this issue p. 1218 , p. 1214"

These are difficult organisms to investigate genetically because of their AT-rich genomes. Zhang et al. have exploited this peculiarity by using piggyBac transposon insertion sites to achieve saturation-level mutagenesis for identifying and ranking essential genes and drug targets (see the Perspective by White and Rathod). Genes that are current candidates for drug targets were identified as essential, in contrast to many vaccine target genes. Notably, the proteasome degradation pathway was confirmed as a target for developing therapeutic interventions because of the several essential genes involved and the link to the mechanism of action of the current frontline drug, artemisinin.

https://openalex.org/W2787257147,"Magnetic insulators are a key resource for next-generation spintronic and topological devices. The family of layered metal halides promises ultrathin insulating multiferroics, spin liquids, and ferromagnets, but new characterization methods are required to unlock their potential. Here, we report tunneling through the layered magnetic insulator CrI3 as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field. We electrically detect the magnetic ground state and inter-layer coupling and observe a field-induced metamagnetic transition. The metamagnetic transition results in magnetoresistances of 95%, 300%, and 550% for bilayer, trilayer, and tetralayer CrI3 barriers, respectively. We further measure inelastic tunneling spectra for our junctions, unveiling a rich spectrum of collective magnetic excitations (magnons) in CrI3. Our results establish vertical tunneling as a versatile probe of magnetism in atomically thin insulators."

The gut characteristically produces gram quantities of immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody, which is presumed to protect the gut from pathogen attack. Donaldson et al. engineered strains of Bacteroides fragilis , a common human commensal, to modify its surface capsule, which affects its ability to colonize the germ-free mouse gut. Capsule changes altered the capacity of IgA to bind to the different mutants. It seems that this commensal species exploits IgA sticking power specifically to give it a competitive edge and to promote its establishment in the gut. Science , this issue p. 795"

These make up larger structures, such as the osteons found in compact bone. However, at smaller lengths, does the hierarchical structure persist? By combining three-dimensional electron tomography with two-dimensional electron microscopy, Reznikov et al. observed structural ordering from the nanoscale upward. At the smallest scale, needle-shaped mineral units form platelets that organize into stacks bridging multiple collagen units. Science , this issue p. eaao2189"

Tosches et al. used single-cell transcriptomics to study turtle, lizard, mouse, and human brain samples. They assessed how the mammalian six-layered cortex might be derived from the reptilian three-layered cortex. Despite a lack of correspondence between layers, mammalian astrocytes and adult neural stem cells shared evolutionary origins. General classes of interneuron types were represented across the evolutionary span, although subtypes were species-specific. Pieces of the much-folded mammalian hippocampus were represented as adjacent fields in the reptile brains. Science , this issue p. 881"

The enzymes that transform tabersonine into vindoline are known; however, the mechanism by which the scaffolds of catharanthine and tabersonine are generated has been a mystery. Caputi et al. now describe the biosynthetic genes and corresponding enzymes responsible. This resolves a long-standing question of how plant alkaloid scaffolds are synthesized, which is important not only for vinblastine and vincristine biosynthesis, but also for understanding the many other biologically active alkaloids found throughout nature.

However, very small–grained materials start to coarsen at relatively low temperatures, wiping out their most desirable properties.

For many applications, it will be important to gain simultaneous control over particle size and morphology, constituent materials, and internal interfaces. Fenton et al. have developed a strategy that mimics chemical retrosynthesis, starting with simple nanoparticle synthons—in this case, Cu 1.8 S nanoparticles, nanorods, and nanosheets. Various types of interfaces and junctions can be introduced, for example, by cation substitution. This intervention breaks the symmetry of the synthons and assembles them into higher-order structures. The nanostructures can thus be formed with asymmetric, patchy, porous, or sculpted regions.

Kazuma et al. used a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to induce and map out the surface dissociation of a dimethyl disulfide molecule on silver and copper surfaces. A silver STM tip created localized plasmons at different distances from the molecule. The plasmons drove the reaction directly by exciting the valence electrons of the molecule into unoccupied states and cleaving the sulfur-sulfur bond. Science , this issue p. 521"
https://openalex.org/W2802670298,"Ependymal cells are multi-ciliated cells that form the brain’s ventricular epithelium and a niche for neural stem cells (NSCs) in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ). In addition, ependymal cells are suggested to be latent NSCs with a capacity to acquire neurogenic function. This remains highly controversial due to a lack of prospective in vivo labeling techniques that can effectively distinguish ependymal cells from neighboring V-SVZ NSCs. We describe a transgenic system that allows for targeted labeling of ependymal cells within the V-SVZ. Single-cell RNA-seq revealed that ependymal cells are enriched for cilia-related genes and share several stem-cell-associated genes with neural stem or progenitors. Under in vivo and in vitro neural-stem- or progenitor-stimulating environments, ependymal cells failed to demonstrate any suggestion of latent neural-stem-cell function. These findings suggest remarkable stability of ependymal cell function and provide fundamental insights into the molecular signature of the V-SVZ niche."
https://openalex.org/W2801595722,"Small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels mediate neuron excitability and are associated with synaptic transmission and plasticity. They also regulate immune responses and the size of blood cells. Activation of SK channels requires calmodulin (CaM), but how CaM binds and opens SK channels has been unclear. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of a human SK4-CaM channel complex in closed and activated states at 3.4- and 3.5-angstrom resolution, respectively. Four CaM molecules bind to one channel tetramer. Each lobe of CaM serves a distinct function: The C-lobe binds to the channel constitutively, whereas the N-lobe interacts with the S4-S5 linker in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The S4-S5 linker, which contains two distinct helices, undergoes conformational changes upon CaM binding to open the channel pore. These structures reveal the gating mechanism of SK channels and provide a basis for understanding SK channel pharmacology."

This phenomenon is called alloknesis and can become a major medical condition associated with dry skin. Feng et al. discovered that loss or dysfunction of Merkel cells causes scratching in mice (see the Perspective by Lewis and Grandl). Reduction of Merkel cell numbers results in reduced firing patterns and frequencies and changes the activation thresholds of slowly adapting afferent nerve fibers. Like hair cells, Merkel cells are lost with age. A painful scratch will temporarily alleviate itch because it induces enough activity through the remaining Merkel cells.

Although C1q plays a role in the clearance of apoptotic cells, there are several redundant clearance pathways. Disruption of one pathway does not lead to an autoimmune defect. In a chronic graft-versus-host disease model of SLE, Ling et al. show that C1q dampens CD8 + T cell responses to self-antigens. C1q modulates metabolism through the mitochondrial cell-surface protein p32/gC1qR. The lack of C1q during a viral infection also enhances CD8 + T cell responses. Thus, C1q plays a role as a “metabolic rheostat” for effector CD8 + T cells. Science , this issue p. 558"

This system constitutes a practical model for screening for Ca 2+ -signaling mechanisms in plants. Wudick et al. analyzed multiple variants of glutamate receptor–like (GLR) channels and discovered that some work alone and others work in pairs or trios. Subcellular localization of GLRs is a complex response to CORNICHON sorting proteins, which leave some GLRs at the plasma membrane and ferry others to internal calcium reservoirs. The calcium current at the tip of the growing pollen tube apparently integrates multiple intracellular currents. Science , this issue p. 533"
https://openalex.org/W2800985368,"Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) 1 and 2 are essential chromatin regulators of cell identity. PRC1, a dominant executer of Polycomb-mediated control, functions as multiple sub-complexes that possess catalytic-dependent H2AK119 mono-ubiquitination (H2AK119ub) and catalytic-independent activities. Here, we show that, despite its well-established repressor functions, PRC1 binds to both silent and active genes. Through in vivo loss-of-function studies, we show that global PRC1 function is essential for skin development and stem cell (SC) specification, whereas PRC1 catalytic activity is dispensable. Further dissection demonstrated that both canonical and non-canonical PRC1 complexes bind to repressed genes, marked by H2AK119ub and PRC2-mediated H3K27me3. Interestingly, loss of canonical PRC1, PRC1 catalytic activity, or PRC2 leads to expansion of mechanosensitive Merkel cells in neonatal skin. Non-canonical PRC1 complexes, however, also bind to and promote expression of genes critical for skin development and SC formation. Together, our findings highlight PRC1’s diverse roles in executing a precise developmental program."
https://openalex.org/W2800420110,"Despite widespread interest in using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) in neurological disease modeling, a suitable model system to study human neuronal connectivity is lacking. Here, we report a comprehensive and efficient differentiation paradigm for hiPSCs that generate multiple CA3 pyramidal neuron subtypes as detected by single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). This differentiation paradigm exhibits characteristics of neuronal network maturation, and rabies virus tracing revealed synaptic connections between stem cell-derived dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 neurons in vitro recapitulating the neuronal connectivity within the hippocampus. Because hippocampal dysfunction has been implicated in schizophrenia, we applied DG and CA3 differentiation paradigms to schizophrenia-patient-derived hiPSCs. We detected reduced activity in DG-CA3 co-culture and deficits in spontaneous and evoked activity in CA3 neurons from schizophrenia-patient-derived hiPSCs. Our approach offers critical insights into the network activity aspects of schizophrenia and may serve as a promising tool for modeling diseases with hippocampal vulnerability. VIDEO ABSTRACT."

However, the microscopic complexity of these systems impedes the quantitative understanding of QPTs. We observed and thoroughly analyzed the rich strongly correlated physics in two profoundly dissimilar regimes of quantum criticality. With a circuit implementing a quantum simulator for the three-channel Kondo model, we reveal the universal scalings toward different low-temperature fixed points and along the multiple crossovers from quantum criticality. An unanticipated violation of the maximum conductance for ballistic free electrons is uncovered. The present charge pseudospin implementation of a Kondo impurity opens access to a broad variety of strongly correlated phenomena."

Microtubules attach to the chromosome pairs through protein complexes called kinetochores. During cell division, microtubule depolymerization pulls the chromatids apart. Jenni and Harrison describe the structure of an essential component of the yeast kinetochore, the DASH/Dam1c complex, that forms a ring around a microtubule. The structure shows how the DASH/Dam1c ring interacts with the microtubule and kinetochore components so that the kinetochore can track to the end of the microtubule through cycles of growth and shrinkage.

https://openalex.org/W2802012092,"Tools to understand how the spliceosome functions in vivo have lagged behind advances in the structural biology of the spliceosome. Here, methods are described to globally profile spliceosome-bound pre-mRNA, intermediates, and spliced mRNA at nucleotide resolution. These tools are applied to three yeast species that span 600 million years of evolution. The sensitivity of the approach enables the detection of canonical and non-canonical events, including interrupted, recursive, and nested splicing. This application of statistical modeling uncovers independent roles for the size and position of the intron and the number of introns per transcript in substrate progression through the two catalytic stages. These include species-specific inputs suggestive of spliceosome-transcriptome coevolution. Further investigations reveal the ATP-dependent discard of numerous endogenous substrates after spliceosome assembly in vivo and connect this discard to intron retention, a form of splicing regulation. Spliceosome profiling is a quantitative, generalizable global technology used to investigate an RNP central to eukaryotic gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W2800073715,"Osteoporosis, osteopenia, and pathological bone fractures are frequent complications of iron-overload conditions such as hereditary hemochromatosis, thalassemia, and sickle cell disease. Moreover, animal models of iron overload have revealed increased bone resorption and decreased bone formation. Although systemic iron overload affects multiple organs and tissues, leading to significant changes on bone modeling and remodeling, the cell autonomous effects of excessive iron on bone cells remain unknown. Here, to elucidate the role of cellular iron homeostasis in osteoclasts, we generated two mouse strains in which solute carrier family 40 member 1 (Slc40a1), a gene encoding ferroportin (FPN), the sole iron exporter in mammalian cells, was specifically deleted in myeloid osteoclast precursors or mature cells. The FPN deletion mildly increased iron levels in both precursor and mature osteoclasts, and its loss in precursors, but not in mature cells, increased osteoclastogenesis and decreased bone mass in vivo. Of note, these phenotypes were more pronounced in female than in male mice. In vitro studies revealed that the elevated intracellular iron promoted macrophage proliferation and amplified expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (Nfatc1) and PPARG coactivator 1β (Pgc-1β), two transcription factors critical for osteoclast differentiation. However, the iron excess did not affect osteoclast survival. While increased iron stimulated global mitochondrial metabolism in osteoclast precursors, it had little influence on mitochondrial mass and reactive oxygen species production. These results indicate that FPN-regulated intracellular iron levels are critical for mitochondrial metabolism, osteoclastogenesis, and skeletal homeostasis in mice.

The ability to detect early emerging outbreaks is key to mounting an effective response. The early warning and response system (EWARS) is a toolkit that provides countries with early-warning systems for efficient and cost-effective local responses. EWARS uses outbreak and alarm indicators to derive prediction models that can be used prospectively to predict a forthcoming dengue outbreak at district level.We report on the development of the EWARS tool, based on users' recommendations into a convenient, user-friendly and reliable software aided by a user's workbook and its field testing in 30 health districts in Brazil, Malaysia and Mexico.34 Health officers from the 30 study districts who had used the original EWARS for 7 to 10 months responded to a questionnaire with mainly open-ended questions. Qualitative content analysis showed that participants were generally satisfied with the tool but preferred open-access vs. commercial software. EWARS users also stated that the geographical unit should be the district, while access to meteorological information should be improved. These recommendations were incorporated into the second-generation EWARS-R, using the free R software, combined with recent surveillance data and resulted in higher sensitivities and positive predictive values of alarm signals compared to the first-generation EWARS. Currently the use of satellite data for meteorological information is being tested and a dashboard is being developed to increase user-friendliness of the tool. The inclusion of other Aedes borne viral diseases is under discussion.EWARS is a pragmatic and useful tool for detecting imminent dengue outbreaks to trigger early response activities."

In this research, we compared the amino acids compositions and antioxidant activities of various extracts of T. molitor to enhance their quality as food. For the comparison, distilled water extracts, enzymatic hydrolysates, and condensed enzymatic hydrolysates of T. molitor larvae were prepared. Their amino acids (AAs) profiles and antioxidant activities, including ferric-reducing antioxidant power, oxygen radical absorption capacity, and DPPH, hydroxyl radical, and hydrogen peroxide radical scavenging properties assay were analyzed. DW extracts had the lowest AAs contents and antioxidant activity compared with enzymatic extracts. Condensed hydrolysates with a combination of alcalase and flavourzyme (C-A+F) exhibited the highest levels of total free AAs (11.1759 g/100 g). C-A+F produced higher total hydrolyzed AAs (32.5292 g/100 g) compared with the other groups. The C-A+F possessed the strongest antioxidant activity. Notably, the antioxidant activities of the hydrolysates and the total hydrolyzed AAs amount were correlated. Taken together, our findings showed that C-A+F was a promising technique for obtaining extracts of T. molitor larvae with antioxidant activity as potential nutritious functional food."

The nitrogenase MoFe protein contains two cofactors, a [7Fe-9S-Mo-C-homocitrate] active-site species, designated FeMo-cofactor, and a [8Fe-7S] electron-transfer mediator called P-cluster. Both cofactors are essential for molybdenum-dependent nitrogenase catalysis in the nitrogen-fixing bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii. We show here that three proteins, NafH, NifW, and NifZ, copurify with MoFe protein produced by an A. vinelandii strain deficient in both FeMo-cofactor formation and P-cluster maturation. In contrast, two different proteins, NifY and NafY, copurified with MoFe protein deficient only in FeMo-cofactor formation.

We found that these interactions occur in the order NafH, NifW, NifZ, and NafY/NifY. Interactions of NafH, NifW, and NifZ with immature forms of MoFe protein preceded completion of P-cluster maturation, whereas interaction of NafY/NifY preceded FeMo-cofactor insertion. Because each assembly factor could independently bind an immature form of MoFe protein, we propose that subpopulations of MoFe protein–assembly factor complexes represent MoFe protein captured at different stages of a sequential maturation process. This suggestion was supported by separate isolation of three such complexes, MoFe protein–NafY, MoFe protein–NifY, and MoFe protein–NifW.

Here, our transcriptome and DNA methylome analyses revealed that Hoxb cluster and retinoid signaling genes are predominantly enriched in LT-HSCs, and this coordinate regulation of Hoxb expression is mediated by a retinoid-dependent cis-regulatory element, distal element RARE (DERARE). Deletion of the DERARE reduced Hoxb expression, resulting in changes to many downstream signaling pathways (e.g., non-canonical Wnt signaling) and loss of HSC self-renewal and reconstitution capacity. DNA methyltransferases mediate DNA methylation on the DERARE, leading to reduced Hoxb cluster expression. Acute myeloid leukemia patients with DNMT3A mutations exhibit DERARE hypomethylation, elevated HOXB expression, and adverse outcomes. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated specific DNA methylation at DERARE attenuated HOXB expression and alleviated leukemogenesis. Collectively, these findings demonstrate pivotal roles for retinoid signaling and the DERARE in maintaining HSCs and preventing leukemogenesis by coordinate regulation of Hoxb genes."

Finally, if sequencing depth is insufficient and a spliced mRNA is highly unstable (e.g., AS-NMD and small nucleolar RNA [snoRNA] host gene mRNAs) (McGlincy and Smith, 2008McGlincy N.J. Smith C.W.J.

Sci. 2008; 33: 385-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), traditional RNA-seq may miss the exon-containing spliced product all together. A more direct approach for mapping intron locations and measuring splicing flux is to interrogate the introns themselves. One method is to analyze branched reads in RNA-seq data (Awan et al., 2013Awan A.R. Manfredo A. Pleiss J.A.

Fairbrother W.G. Large-scale mapping of branchpoints in human pre-mRNA transcripts in vivo.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 719-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Branches are generated during the first chemical step of splicing wherein the 2′-OH of an adenosine near the 3′ end of the intron (the branchpoint; BP) attacks the 3′-5′ phosphodiester at the 5′ end of the intron (the 5′ splice site; 5′SS) to liberate the 5′ exon terminating with 3′-OH and form a 2′-5′ bond between the BP and the 5′SS nucleotide. Subsequent attack of the 5′ exon on the 3′ end of the intron (the 3′ splice site; 3′SS) during the second step of splicing frees the branched intron (aka lariat) and ligates the two exons. Subsequent debranching of the excised intron by debranching enzyme (DBE) results in a linear intron beginning with a 5′-phosphate (5′-P) and ending with a 3′-OH. Branches are incidentally captured during RNA-seq library construction when reverse transcriptase initiates downstream of the 5′SS and traverses the 2′-5′ bond to continue cDNA synthesis upstream of the BP. However, the low abundance of such inverted reads in traditional RNA-seq datasets (ca. 1:106) (Taggart et al., 2012Taggart A.J. DeSimone A.M. Shih J.S. Filloux M.E. Fairbrother W.G. Large-scale mapping of branchpoints in human pre-mRNA transcripts in vivo.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 719-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) limits the utility of this approach. Although circular RNA species can be enriched by 2D electrophoresis (Awan et al., 2013Awan A.R. Manfredo A. Pleiss J.A. Lariat sequencing in a unicellular yeast identifies regulated alternative splicing of exons that are evolutionarily conserved with humans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 12762-12767Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or exonucleolytic degradation of linear species (Mercer et al., 2015Mercer T.R. Clark M.B. Andersen S.B. Brunck M.E. Haerty W. Crawford J. Taft R.J. Nielsen L.K. Dinger M.E. Mattick J.S. Genome-wide discovery of human splicing branchpoints.Genome Res. 2015; 25: 290-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), these approaches work well only for relatively short introns whose lariats are less susceptible to breakage during sample workup. Thus, despite intensive bioinformatics analyses interrogating billions of RNA-seq reads, <25% of human introns currently have mapped BPs (Mercer et al., 2015Mercer T.R. Clark M.B. Andersen S.B. Brunck M.E. Haerty W. Crawford J. Taft R.J. Nielsen L.K. Dinger M.E. Mattick J.S.

Kim S. Fairbrother W.G. Large-scale analysis of branchpoint usage across species and cell lines.Genome Res. 2017; 27: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. pombe), where the longest known nuclear intron is just 1,126 nt, BPs have been validated in only 31% of all introns (Awan et al., 2013Awan A.R. Manfredo A. Pleiss J.A. Lariat sequencing in a unicellular yeast identifies regulated alternative splicing of exons that are evolutionarily conserved with humans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 12762-12767Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, Bitton et al., 2014Bitton D.A. Rallis C. Jeffares D.C. Smith G.C. Chen Y.Y.C. Codlin S. Marguerat S. Bähler J. LaSSO, a strategy for genome-wide mapping of intronic lariats and branch points using RNA-seq.Genome Res. 2014; 24: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An alternate means to enrich for introns is to purify spliceosomes, the macromolecular machines responsible for identifying splice sites and catalyzing intron excision. Employing a split TAP-tag approach, we previously reported purification characterization of an endogenous S. pombe spliceosomal complex containing U2, U5, and U6 small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and the Prp19 complex (NTC) (Chen et al., 2014Chen W. Shulha H.P. Ashar-Patel A. Yan J. Green K.M. Query C.C. Rhind N. Weng Z. Moore M.J. Endogenous U2·U5·U6 snRNA complexes in S. pombe are intron lariat spliceosomes.RNA. 2014; 20: 308-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This complex contains predominantly lariat intron product, so is often referred to as intron lariat spliceosome (ILS) complex (Chen et al., 2014Chen W. Shulha H.P. Ashar-Patel A. Yan J. Green K.M. Query C.C. Rhind N. Weng Z. Moore M.J. Endogenous U2·U5·U6 snRNA complexes in S. pombe are intron lariat spliceosomes.RNA. 2014; 20: 308-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here, we present multiple deep sequencing analyses of the transcripts contained within the S. pombe U2·U5·U6·NTC complex, collectively termed “spliceosome profiling” (Figure 1). Spliceosome profiling includes spliceosome RNA-seq libraries to investigate overall coverage of introns and exons associated with late stage spliceosomes, 5′-P and 3′-OH libraries of debranched RNA to unambiguously identify sites of spliceosome catalysis at nucleotide resolution, and spliceosome footprint libraries to precisely map the intron regions forming stable interactions with the splicing machinery. By these analyses we annotated new introns, corrected misannotated introns, identified a recursive-splicing intron, and developed a new algorithm to identify BPs in 86% of all S. pombe introns. Spliceosome profiling thus enables in-depth studies of all functional introns. ILS complex should contain a complete record of all sites of spliceosome catalysis. To access this record, we purified U2·U5·U6·NTC complex from S. pombe, using affinity purification from a triply tagged (TT) strain (Chen et al., 2014Chen W. Shulha H.P. Ashar-Patel A. Yan J. Green K.M. Query C.C. Rhind N. Weng Z. Moore M.J. Endogenous U2·U5·U6 snRNA complexes in S. pombe are intron lariat spliceosomes.RNA. 2014; 20: 308-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). Purifications were performed under high salt conditions to remove all loosely bound species, resulting in a highly pure preparation of endogenous spliceosomes containing stoichiometric quantities of U2, U5, and U6 snRNAs, core spliceosomal proteins, and associated introns (Chen et al., 2014Chen W. Shulha H.P. Ashar-Patel A. Yan J. Green K.M. Query C.C. Rhind N. Weng Z. Moore M.J. Endogenous U2·U5·U6 snRNA complexes in S. pombe are intron lariat spliceosomes.RNA. 2014; 20: 308-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because of the heterogeneous nature of RNAs associated with U2·U5·U6·NTC complex, multiple library types are required to fully profile the contents (Figure 1B; Table S1). Treatment of purified RNA with recombinant DBE results in linear species amenable to construction of spliceosome RNA-seq libraries (to yield a complete record of all associated RNAs), 5′-P libraries (to map intron 5′ ends), and 3′-OH libraries (to map intron 3′ ends). Incubation of spliceosomes with micrococcal nuclease (MNase) prior to RNA purification produces spliceosome footprints. Illumina sequencing yielded 25–97 million reads per library, with biological replicates exhibiting correlation coefficients ranging from 0.95–0.99 (Table S1A). Consistent with our previous report that endogenous U2·U5·U6·NTC complex is predominantly ILS complex (Chen et al., 2014Chen W. Shulha H.P. Ashar-Patel A. Yan J. Green K.M. Query C.C. Rhind N. Weng Z. Moore M.J. Endogenous U2·U5·U6 snRNA complexes in S. pombe are intron lariat spliceosomes.RNA. 2014; 20: 308-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), average intron read density was 15-fold higher than average exon read density for both spliceosome RNA-seq and footprint libraries. This strong enrichment over introns was readily apparent from read coverage on individual genes (Figure 1C). In all, 4,499 introns (85% of 5,303 annotated introns) were represented by >10 spliceosome RNA-seq reads in both biological replicates, with undetected introns generally residing in poorly expressed genes (Figure S1B). The 5′-P and 3′-OH libraries allowed us to precisely map intron ends. A large fraction of these reads mapped to annotated introns (Tables S1D and S1E), with an aggregation plot revealing striking peaks at intron ends (Figures 2A and S1C). In all, 4,691 introns had statistically significant (binomial test, false discovery rate [FDR] <0.01) 5′SS 5′-P and 3′SS 3′-OH peaks in both biological replicates. Inclusion of introns with a statistically significant peak at just one end increased this number to 5,105, or 96% of previously annotated S. pombe introns. As with the spliceosome RNA-seq, introns not observed in the 5′-P and 3′-OH libraries corresponded to low abundance mRNAs (Figure S1B). In addition to the 5′-P and 3′-OH peaks discussed above, many other peaks met the <0.01 FDR threshold but did not correspond to current splice site annotations. Direct examination of all such peaks with mean >50 reads per million mapped (rpm; 328 peaks total) revealed numerous misannotated or previously unannotated spliced sites that we were able to confirm by parallel examination of exon junction reads in existing wild-type (WT) RNA-seq data (Marguerat et al., 2012Marguerat S.

Heiman D.I. et al.Comparative functional genomics of the fission yeasts.Science. 2011; 332: 930-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) and/or spliceosome RNA-seq and footprints. In all, we found 16 5′SS and 3′SS misannotations in CDS genes, all of which change the encoded protein (Table S2A). Of these sixteen, nine result in a small amino acid insertion or deletion (1–28 aa) at an internal position, whereas five were due to transcription start site (TSS) or intron misannotations at the end of a CDS region, where genome annotation is inherently more difficult. Two particularly interesting examples of previously misannotated introns within CDS regions occur in transcripts encoding spliceosomal proteins. One is an intron initiating with A and terminating with C (aka, an AT-AC intron) in SPBC1861.08c (Lea1) (Figure 2B). Although S. pombe does not contain the U11/U12-dependent minor spliceosome responsible for removing most AT-AC introns in metazoans, the U1/U2-dependent major spliceosome can remove introns starting with A and ending with C in the context of otherwise strong 5′SS, BP and 3′SS consensus sequences (Wu and Krainer, 1997Wu Q. Krainer A.R. Splicing of a divergent subclass of AT-AC introns requires the major spliceosomal snRNAs.RNA. 1997; 3: 586-601PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed this new AT-AC annotation by Sanger sequencing of the RT-PCR cDNA product generated from untagged WT S. pombe RNA (Figure 2B, inset) and examination of WT RNA-seq reads (Figure 2B, bottom). Another interesting example was a 3′SS misannotation in SPAC27F1.09c (prp10/sap155/SF3B1) intron 2 (Figure 2C). SF3B1 is both an essential spliceosomal protein and an oncogene commonly mutated in cancers (Jenkins and Kielkopf, 2017Jenkins J.L. Kielkopf C.L. Splicing Factor Mutations in Myelodysplasias: Insights from Spliceosome Structures.Trends Genet. 2017; 33: 336-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Untagged WT cells express two prp10 mRNA isoforms, one retaining the intron and encoding the full-length protein and another where the corrected intron has been removed and the CDS frameshifted (Figure 2C, inset). The abundance of the frameshifted isoform was higher in cells lacking Upf1 (Figure 2C), an essential nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) factor. Thus it appears that, like metazoans (Ge and Porse, 2014Ge Y. Porse B.T. The functional consequences of intron retention: alternative splicing coupled to NMD as a regulator of gene expression.BioEssays. 2014; 36: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, Jacob and Smith, 2017Jacob A.G. Smith C.W.J. Intron retention as a component of regulated gene expression programs.Hum. Genet. 2017; 136: 1043-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), S. pombe uses alternative splicing linked to NMD (AS-NMD) to maintain homeostasis of this crucial splicing factor. Finally, unexpected peaks in the 336 nt intron in SPNCRNA.445 (snoRNA61) revealed an internal zero-length exon (i.e., a 3′SS immediately adjacent to a 5′SS) (Figure 2D). RT-PCR confirmed complete removal of the full-length intron. In multicellular organisms, zero-length exons are sites at which recursive splicing enables intron removal piecewise (Georgomanolis et al., 2016Georgomanolis T. Sofiadis K. Papantonis A. Cutting a long intron short: recursive splicing and its implications.Front. Physiol. 2016; 7: 598Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this is the first documented example of recursive splicing in a yeast species. Sequence conservation (Rhind et al., 2011Rhind N. Chen Z. Yassour M. Thompson D.A. Haas B.J. Habib N. Wapinski I. Roy S. Lin M.F. Heiman D.I. et al.Comparative functional genomics of the fission yeasts.Science. 2011; 332: 930-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) in other SchizoSaccharomyces species of SPNCRNA.445 intron 1 including the splice site sequences surrounding the zero-length exons, suggests that recursive splicing of these introns serves an important biological purpose. Our data also revealed 217 new introns, 18 of which occur in previously unannotated transcripts (Table S2B) and 103 interrupt non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) of unknown function (Table S2C). Sixteen others harbor snoRNAs, including five new introns in the SPNCRNA659 host gene, each surrounding snoRNAs 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (Figure S2). Whereas the majority (62 of 80) of novel introns in CDS genes lie fully within UTRs (Table S2D), 19 reside either partially or fully within the annotated ORF and so alter the predicted protein sequence. One particularly interesting example is a new 543 nt intron overlapping the 5′-UTR and ORF of alcohol dehydrogenase 4, adh4 (SPAC5H10.06c) (Figure 2E). Primer extension and RT-PCR analyses indicated that adh4 has two mRNA isoforms produced from alternative transcription start sites (TSS1 and TSS2), with TSS2 residing within the newly detected intron. PolyA+ RNA-seq tags indicative of both mRNA isoforms were readily identifiable in previous datasets from untagged WT cells (Marguerat et al., 2012Marguerat S. Schmidt A. Codlin S. Chen W. Aebersold R. Bähler J. Quantitative analysis of fission yeast transcriptomes and proteomes in proliferating and quiescent cells.Cell. 2012; 151: 671-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). S. pombe Adh4 protein was previously shown to co-purify with mitochondria (Crichton et al., 2007Crichton P.G. Affourtit C. Moore A.L. Identification of a mitochondrial alcohol dehydrogenase in Schizosaccharomyces pombe: new insights into energy metabolism.Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and transcripts initiating at TSS2 encode a protein isoform (II) containing an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS). Initiation at TSS1, however, leads to intron excision and removal of the first 43 codons containing the MTS—thus protein isoform I is presumably cytoplasmic. The relative abundance of these two mRNA isoforms depends on growth conditions (Figure 2E). During log phase growth in rich media, mRNA isoform II predominates, but upon stress (e.g., inhibition of translation or glucose deprivation), mRNA isoform I predominates. Thus, in addition to identifying a new intron in adh4, our 5′-P and 3′-OH sequencing led us to discover a stress-responsive TSS and splicing switch that likely alters the subcellular targeting of a key metabolic enzyme. For prp10, the WT RNA-seq data and our RT-PCR analysis indicated a significant cDNA fraction retaining the queried intron (Figures 2B and 2C). This led us to examine the relationship between different intron populations and their retention levels in RNA-seq libraries. Introns covered by our 5′-P or 3′-OH datasets and for which the ASM294v2.26 genome annotation agreed with our spliceosome profiling data (i.e., the vast majority of all previously annotated introns) tended to have very low intron retention percentages in untagged WT RNA-seq datasets (Figures 3A and 3B ). Newly detected introns, however, tended toward higher intron retention, likely explaining why they were previously missed in annotations based on RNA-seq alone. Introns can vary with respect to either first step efficiency (leading to varying degrees of full intron retention) or second step efficiency (leading to varying splicing intermediate abundance). In addition to the major 3′-OH peak at the 3′SS (3′SS 3′-OH reads) indicative of a fully excised intron, 3,528 introns had a second smaller 3′-OH peak (binomial test, FDR <0.01, Table S3A) at the 3′ end of the upstream exon (5′SS 3′-OH reads) indicative of splicing intermediate (Figure 2A). Across the 5,110 introns (old plus new annotations) having at least 25 3′SS 3′-OH reads in both biological replicates, 5′SS 3′-OH reads averaged 3.3% of total 3′-OH reads for that intron, with a range of 0%–65%. High levels of splicing intermediate can indicate inefficient exon ligation, the means by which the 3′ end of telomerase RNA is generated from the S. pombe ter1 transcript (Box et al., 2008Box J.A. Bunch J.T. Tang W. Baumann P. Spliceosomal cleavage generates the 3′ end of telomerase RNA.Nature. 2008; 456: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we observed 29% splicing intermediate on the ter1 intron (Figure 3C), ranking it within the top 2% of all 5,110 introns with regard to percent splicing intermediate (Figure 3D). Other ncRNA transcripts included in the top 100 introns exhibiting high (> 17%) splicing intermediate included SPNCRNA.445 (snoRNA 61), SPSNORNA.01 (snoRNA 40), SPSNORNA.30 (snoRNA 62), and three transcripts antisense to CDS genes (Table S3A). In the future it will be of interest to determine whether any of these generate functional RNA species through inefficient exon ligation. All other high splicing intermediate introns were in CDS genes. Gene ontology analysis of the top 100, 150, or 200 introns ranked by fraction of splicing intermediate revealed them to disproportionately interrupt genes encoding ribosomal proteins (RPs) (Tables S3B–S3D). Interestingly, this gene ontology enrichment did not extend to CDS genes with high levels of full intron retention (Figure 3A). There was also very little overlap between the high intron retention and high splicing intermediate CDS gene sets (Figure S3A), and no specific gene ontology terms were associated with the high intron retention set. In budding yeast, inefficient intron excision from RP transcripts serves to negatively regulate ribosome production (Juneau et al., 2006Juneau K. Miranda M. Hillenmeyer M.E. Nislow C. Davis R.W. Introns regulate RNA and protein abundance in yeast.Genetics. 2006; 174: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, Parenteau et al., 2011Parenteau J. Durand M. Morin G. Gagnon J. Lucier J.-F. Wellinger R.J. Chabot B. Elela S.A. Introns within ribosomal protein genes regulate the production and function of yeast ribosomes.Cell. 2011; 147: 320-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Our findings thus suggest that this may also be the case in S. pombe, with the regulation occurring at the second step of splicing, not initial intron recognition. Examination of spliceosome footprinting reads across introns with high splicing intermediate revealed that many also had a high fraction of exon junction reads (Figures S3B and S3C). A high fraction of spliced exons could indicate inefficient spliced product release. Because the spliceosome can catalyze both forward and reverse splicing (Tseng and Cheng, 2008Tseng C.K. Cheng S.C. Both catalytic steps of nuclear pre-mRNA splicing are reversible.Science. 2008; 320: 1782-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), inefficient spliced exon release could result in reverse second step, and therefore an increase in splicing intermediates. Consistent with this idea, introns with the highest fraction of splicing intermediates had statistically higher fractions of exon junction reads than all other introns within the same genes (gene-matched intron set) (Figure 3C). 5′SS cleavage is believed to occur solely by attack of the BP adenosine 2′-OH on the 5′SS phosphodiester. However, group II self-splicing introns, which are both evolutionarily and structurally related to the spliceosome (Pyle, 2016Pyle A.M. Group II intron self-splicing.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2016; 45: 183-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), can catalyze 5′SS cleavage by either branch formation or 5′SS hydrolysis, the latter resulting in a linear intron-3′ exon intermediate (Jarrell et al., 1988Jarrell K.A. Peebles C.L. Dietrich R.C. Romiti S.L. Perlman P.S. Group II intron self-splicing. Alternative reaction conditions yield novel products.J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3432-3439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Podar et al., 1998Podar M. Chu V.T. Pyle A.M. Perlman P.S. Group II intron splicing in vivo by first-step hydrolysis.Nature. 1998; 391: 915-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The difficulty in identifying S. pombe and metazoan BPs could be due to spliceosomal 5′SS cleavage events occurring by hydrolysis rather than branching. Indeed, when we made 5′-P and 3′-OH libraries from dbr1Δ cells without DBE treatment (DBE−), whereas many introns behaved as expected for the branching-only pathway (Figures 4A and S4A), ∼8% of introns retained statistically significant 5′SS 5′-P peaks across both biological replicates (Figures 4B and S4B). The dbr1Δ cells had no detectable debranching activity (Figure 4C). Under certain salt conditions, purified human spliceosomes are capable of hydrolyzing the 2′-5′ bond at the BP (Tseng and Cheng, 2013Tseng C.K. Cheng S.C. The spliceosome catalyzes debranching in competition with reverse of the first chemical reaction.RNA. 2013; 19: 971-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Because we found no statistically significant 5′SS peaks in 5′-P libraries made from DBE-dbr1Δ cellular RNA (Figure 4D), the linear introns present in purified dbr1Δ U2·U5·U6·NTC complexes were most likely due to 2′-5′ bond hydrolysis occurring during spliceosome purification. We conclude that, unlike group II introns that can activate either H2O or the BP 2′-OH as the nucleophile for the first step of splicing, the spliceosome can only initiate 5′SS cleavage by activating the BP 2′-OH.Figure S45′-P Peak Correlation between DBE− and DBE+ 5′-P Libraries, Related to Figure 4Show"

Understanding determinants of smallholder farming practices is critical for designing and implementing successful interventions, including climate change adaptation programs. We examine two dimensions wherein smallholder farmers may adapt agricultural practices; through intensification (i.e., adopt more practices) or diversification (i.e. adopt different practices). We use data on 5314 randomly sampled households located in 38 sites in 15 countries across four regions (East and West Africa, South Asia, and Central America). We estimate empirical models designed to assess determinants of both intensification and diversification of adaptation activities at global scales. Aspects of adaptive capacity that are found to increase intensification of adaptation globally include variables associated with access to information and human capital, financial considerations, assets, household infrastructure and experience. In contrast, there are few global drivers of adaptive diversification, with a notable exception being access to weather information, which also increases adaptive intensification. Investigating reasons for adaptation indicate that conditions present in underdeveloped markets provide the primary impetus for adaptation, even in the context of climate change. We also compare determinants across spatial scales, which reveals a variety of local avenues through which policy interventions can relax economic constraints and boost agricultural adaptation for both intensification and diversification. For example, access to weather information does not affect intensification adaptation in Africa, but is significant at several sites in Bangladesh and India. Moreover, this information leads to diversification of adaptive activities on some sites in South Asia and Central America, but increases specialization in West and East Africa."

The preintegration complex of HIV-1 is known to traffic along microtubules and accumulate near the microtubule-organizing center. The centrosome is the major microtubule-organizing center in most eukaryotic cells, but precisely how HIV-1 impinges on centrosome biology remains poorly understood. We report here that the HIV-1 accessory protein viral protein R (Vpr) localized to the centrosome through binding to DCAF1, forming a complex with the ubiquitin ligase EDD-DYRK2-DDB1DCAF1 and Cep78, a resident centrosomal protein previously shown to inhibit EDD-DYRK2-DDB1DCAF1. Vpr did not affect ubiquitination of Cep78. Rather, it enhanced ubiquitination of an EDD-DYRK2-DDB1DCAF1 substrate, CP110, leading to its degradation, an effect that could be overcome by Cep78 expression. The down-regulation of CP110 and elongation of centrioles provoked by Vpr were independent of G2/M arrest. Infection of T lymphocytes with HIV-1, but not with HIV-1 lacking Vpr, promoted CP110 degradation and centriole elongation. Elongated centrioles recruited more γ-tubulin to the centrosome, resulting in increased microtubule nucleation. Our results suggest that Vpr is targeted to the centrosome where it hijacks a ubiquitin ligase, disrupting organelle homeostasis, which may contribute to HIV-1 pathogenesis.

Although the development of an effective and safe GBS vaccine is on the agenda of many research labs, there is no GBS vaccine on the market yet. In the present study we attempted to engineer a live vaccine strain based on Bac, a surface protein of GBS, incorporated into a surface fimbrial protein of probiotic Enterococcus. The resulting strain induced specific systemic and local immune responses in mice and provided protection against GBS when administered via the intranasal, oral or intravaginal immunization routes."
https://openalex.org/W2799413315,"The reliability of any quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) experiment can be seriously compromised by variations between samples as well as between PCR runs. This usually result from errors in sample quantification, especially with samples that are obtained from different individuals and tissues and have been collected at various time intervals. Errors also arise from differences in qPCR efficiency between assays performed simultaneously to target multiple genes on the same plate. Consequently, the derived quantitative data for the target genes become distorted. To avoid this grievous error, an endogenous control, with relatively constant transcription levels in the target individual or tissue, is included in the qPCR assay to normalize target gene expression levels in the analysis. Several housekeeping genes (HKGs) have been used as endogenous controls in quantification studies of mRNA transcripts; however, there is no record in the literature of the evaluation of these genes for the tick-borne protozoan parasite, Theileria parva. Importantly, the expression of these genes should be invariable between different T. parva stocks, ideally under different experimental conditions, to gain extensive application in gene expression studies of this parasite. Thus, the expression of several widely used HKGs was evaluated in this study, including the genes encoding β-actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 28S rRNA, cytochrome b and fructose-2.6-biphosphate aldolase (F6P) proteins. The qPCR analysis revealed that the expression of genes encoding cytochrome b, F6P and GAPDH varied considerably between the two T. parva stocks investigated, the cattle-derived T. parva Muguga and the buffalo-derived T. parva 7014. 28S rRNA and β-actin gene expression was the most stable; thus, these genes were considered suitable candidates to be used as endogenous control genes for mRNA quantification studies in T. parva."

A naturally occurring human KIBRA variant involving residue changes at positions 734 (Met-to-Ile) and 735 (Ser-to-Ala) within the C2 domain affects cognitive performance. We have elucidated 3D structures and calcium- and phosphoinositide-binding properties of human KIBRA C2 domain. Both WT and variant C2 adopt a canonical type I topology C2 domain fold. Neither Ca2+ nor any other metal ion was bound to WT or variant KIBRA C2 in crystal structures, and Ca2+ titration produced no significant reproducible changes in NMR spectra.

Here, we characterize the calcium- and phosphoinositide-binding properties of KIBRA C2 domain (Fig. 1), including a variant that arises from two SNPs (rs3822660G/T and rs3822659T/G) in human KIBRA that result in substitution of two adjacent residues (M734I,S735A) (30Duning K.

Although most C2 domains are Ca2+-dependent membrane association domains, some C2 domains do not bind Ca2+, and some mediate protein–protein rather than protein–lipid interactions (31Corbalan-García S. Gómez-Fernández J.C. Signaling through C2 domains: more than one lipid target.Biochim. Biophys.

Cell Biol. 2008; 9 (18216767): 99-11110.1038/nrm2328Google Scholar). Our experimental and computational investigations of WT and variant KIBRA C2 domains indicate that KIBRA C2 is a noncanonical C2 domain that in vitro both binds phosphoinositides and associates with membranes in an atypical, calcium-independent manner. Our 2.6-Å resolution crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 6FD0) shows that variant C2 (varC2) adopts a typical eight-stranded β-sandwich C2 domain fold. The crystal form comprises a parallel dimer (i.e. the two monomers are parallel to each other) formed via an intermonomer disulfide bond involving Cys-771, the fifth and only unpaired cysteine in KIBRA C2 (Fig. 2A). The previously available crystal structure of WT KIBRA C2 (Protein Data Bank code 2Z0U) involves a similar parallel, Cys-771 disulfide-linked dimer. According to analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) measurements (Fig. S1 and Table S2), WTC2 and varC2 samples both comprise a mixture of monomer and dimer in solution. Conversely, AUC and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation measurements (Figs. S1 and S2 and Tables S2 and S3) indicate that the C771A mutant C2 (C2(C771A)) and variant C771A mutant C2 (varC2(C771A)) are monomeric in solution. NMR samples of C2(C771A) and varC2(C771A) were homogeneous and stable, permitting backbone resonance assignments to be made using standard NMR methods (Fig. S3). Although AUC and NMR indicate that C2(C771A) is monomeric in solution, its crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 6FB4; 2.5-Å resolution) comprises an antiparallel dimer (Fig. 2B), most likely formed due to crystal packing. The backbone 1H, 13C, and 15N NMR chemical shifts of C2(C771A) and varC2(C771A) match closely the corresponding chemical shifts back-calculated using SPARTA+ (33Shen Y. Bax A. SPARTA+: a modest improvement in empirical NMR chemical shift prediction by means of an artificial neural network.J. Biomol. NMR. 2010; 48 (20628786): 13-2210.1007/s10858-010-9433-9Google Scholar) from the C2(C771A) crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 6FB4). Correspondingly, the TALOS+ (34Shen Y. Delaglio F. Cornilescu G. Bax A. TALOS+: a hybrid method for predicting protein backbone torsion angles from NMR chemical shifts.J. Biomol. NMR. 2009; 44 (19548092): 213-22310.1007/s10858-009-9333-zGoogle Scholar) and SPARTA+ (33Shen Y. Bax A. SPARTA+: a modest improvement in empirical NMR chemical shift prediction by means of an artificial neural network.J. Biomol. NMR. 2010; 48 (20628786): 13-2210.1007/s10858-010-9433-9Google Scholar) predictions are that the secondary structure compositions of C2(C771A) and varC2(C771A) in solution are very similar to the C2(C771A) crystal structure (Fig. S4). The β-sheet NOE patterns of C2(C771A) and varC2(C771A), moreover, are as expected based on the C2 topology I fold, allowing for peak overlap and absence. NMR data therefore indicate that C2(C771A) and varC2(C771A) in solution are conformationally very similar to each other (Fig. S5) and to C2 monomers in C2(C771A), varC2 (Protein Data Bank codes 6FB4 and 6FD0, respectively) and WTC2 (Protein Data Bank code 2Z0U) crystal structures. Because KIBRA dimerization has been indicated by cell-based data (10Wennmann D.O. Schmitz J. Wehr M.C. Krahn M.P. Koschmal N. Gromnitza S. Schulze U. Weide T. Chekuri A. Skryabin B.V. Gerke V.

Both parallel dimers (WTC2/2Z0U and varC2/6FD0) exhibited significant changes in relative monomer position (Fig. 3) with the changes varying between repeat simulations and force fields. In WTC2 dimer simulations, the mean r.m.s.d. value after three repeat simulations was 0.52 ± 0.04 and 0.49 ± 0.05 nm for GROMOS and OPLS force fields, respectively. The corresponding values in varC2 simulations were 0.51 ± 0.08 nm and 1.4 ± 0.23 nm. In equivalent simulations, in contrast, the C2(C771A) antiparallel dimer (Protein Data Bank code 6FB4) did not undergo significant changes in relative monomer position. There were no significant conformational changes within C2 monomers in any simulation (Fig. 3). Ca2+ binding was investigated by NMR, X-ray crystallography (XRC), and simulation. In numerous 1H-15N HSQC-monitored titrations with C2(C771A) and one with WTC2, calcium chloride addition to 10–20 mm and sometimes higher concentrations (up to 76 mm) produced no significant reproducible chemical shift change with the largest composite 1H-15N changes around 0.05 ppm. Such small changes may be due to a very weak Ca2+ ion interaction (Kd > 10 mm), possibly nonspecific Ca2+ binding to oxygen-rich surface clusters. Such a nonspecific interaction is supported by simulation: when eight Ca2+ ions were initially positioned randomly around KIBRA C2, the final Ca2+ positions in eight simulations included the calcium-binding regions (CBRs) plus six other locations around the domain (Fig. S6). It is also possible that the domain scavenged Ca2+ during expression and purification and was therefore Ca2+-bound prior to the experiments, although this seems unlikely because particular effort was made during some C2 NMR sample preparations to exclude Ca2+. Initial 1H-15N HSQC spectra were very similar, furthermore, irrespective of whether or not measures were taken to exclude Ca2+ from NMR samples. In several crystal structures, including WTC2 (Protein Data Bank code 2Z0U) and our C2(C771A) and varC2 structures, no bound Ca2+ has been observed, although the protein for 2Z0U was produced by cell-free synthesis and Protein Data Bank entry for 2Z0U does not mention any attempt to introduce metal ions. The crystal structures determined here used Escherichia coli–expressed protein with no attempt to exclude Ca2+, however, so the C2 domains presumably encountered Ca2+ and other divalent metal ions during expression and purification. Several times C2 crystals were soaked in solutions containing divalent metal ions, including 20 mm CaCl2, 100 mm CaCl2, and 100 mm MnSO4. Soaking did not cause visible disintegration of the crystals. Diffraction after soaking was still good, but these experiments yielded only one metal-bound structure, which had one Ca2+ located in the intermonomer interface of a C2 dimer rather than in any of the CBRs. Overall, our NMR and XRC data are consistent with KIBRA C2 domain having very low (Kd > 10 mm), nonspecific affinity for Ca2+. Together with Protein Data Bank code 2Z0U, moreover, our NMR and XRC data show that lack of bound Ca2+ does not disrupt KIBRA C2 from adopting a typical C2 domain fold. NMR and XRC studies were conducted to define the phosphoinositide-binding site location(s) on KIBRA C2. Three NMR titrations were conducted by recording 1H-15N HSQC spectra as a function of increasing concentration of phosphoinositide and subsequently calcium chloride. These titrations, involving C2(C771A) with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P), C2(C771A) with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), and varC2 with PI(4,5)P2, produced very similar results in which phosphoinositide-induced chemical shift changes were observed for numerous peaks, almost all located in the β-sheet comprising β-strands 5, 2, 1, and 8 (Fig. 4). Leu-666 (β1), Ile-677 (β2), and Leu-678 (β2) backbone 1H-15N peaks exhibited the largest chemical shift perturbations with changes observed for around 20 further backbone 1H-15N peaks plus two pairs of unassigned side-chain NH2 peaks (Fig. 4). The Kd for C2(C771A)–PI(3)P binding was determined as a representative case using 13 perturbed residues (Fig. S7); the average Kd was 1 mm. After phosphoinositide titration, CaCl2 was titrated into the same NMR samples to establish whether Ca2+ ions influence C2–phosphoinositide interaction or vice versa; there was no further spectral change upon CaCl2 additio"

A number of aphasia assessment tools have recently been developed abroad, but some of these scales were not suitable for patients with acute stroke. The Language Screening Test (which includes two parallel versions [a/b]) in French has been proven to be an effective and time-saving aphasia screening scale for early-stage stroke patients. Therefore, we worked out a Chinese version of the LAST taking into consideration Chinese language and culture. Two preliminary parallel versions (a/b) were tested on 154 patients with stroke at acute phase and 107 patients with stroke at non-acute phase, with the Western Aphasia Battery serving as a gold standard. The equivalence between the two parallel versions and the reliability/validity of each version were assessed. The median time to complete one preliminary Chinese version (each had some item redundancy) was 98 seconds. Two final parallel versions were established after adjustment/elimination of the redundant items and were found to be equivalent (intra-class correlation coefficient: 0.991). Internal consistency is(Cronbach α for each version [a/b] was 0.956 and 0.965, respectively) good. Internal validity was fine: (a) no floor or ceiling effect/item redundancy; (b) construct validity revealed a 1-dimension structure, just like the French version. The higher educated subjects scored higher than their lower educated counterparts (p<0.01). The external validity: at the optimum cut-off point where the score of version a/b <14 in higher educated group(<13 in lower): the specificity of each version was 0.878/0.902(1/1 in lower) and sensitivity was 0.972/0.944(0.944/0.944 in lower). Inter-rater equivalence (intra-class correlation coefficient) was 1. The Chinese version of the Language Screening Test was proved to be an efficient and time-saving bedside aphasia screening tool for stroke patients at acute phase and can be used by an average medical physician."
https://openalex.org/W2801093628,"The human rhomboid family (RHBDF)1 gene is highly expressed in breast cancer under clinical conditions but not in normal mammary gland tissues. Silencing the RHBDF1 gene in breast cancer xenograft tumors leads to inhibition of tumor growth. We show in this study that artificially raising RHBDF1 protein levels in the mammary epithelial cells MCF-10A results in severe perturbations of the ability of the cells to form lumencontaining acini, either in 3-dimensional cell cultures or implanted in mouse mammary fat pads. Knocking down RHBDF1 with short hairpin (sh)RNA leads to restoration of acinus formation. Consistently, RHBDF1 overexpression gives rise to disordered distribution of polarity markers GM130 and laminin-5, which otherwise are located in apical and basal positions, respectively, in the acini. Further investigations reveal that RHBDF1 directly binds to Par6a, a component of a protein complex consisting of partitioning-defective scaffold protein (Par)6, Par3, renin-angiotensin system-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (Rac)1, and cell- division cycle (Cdc)42, which is structurally critical to the formation of apicobasal polarity. RHBDF1 binding to Par6a results in collapse of the protein complex and thus disruption of polarity formation. Since early stages of breast cancer are characterized by the loss of mammary gland epithelial cell polarity, our findings indicate that perturbations of apicobasal polarity by high levels of RHBDF1 is a significant attribute in the development of breast neoplasia.—Peng, X.-M., Gao, S., Deng, H.-T., Cai, H.-X., Zhou, Z., Xiang, R., Zhang, Q.-Z., Li, L.-Y.

This article presents an evaluation of German and Tanzanian researchers' perceptions during their activities as part of a large interdisciplinary research project in Tanzania. The project focused on prioritizing and implementing food-securing upgrading strategies across the components of rural food value chains. The participants involved during the course of the project were asked to provide feedback on 10 different research steps and to evaluate eight core features related to the functioning and potential shortcomings of the project. The study discriminated among evaluation differences linked to culture, gender, and institutional status. Perceptions differed between Tanzanian and German participants depending on the type and complexity of the participatory research steps undertaken and the intensity of stakeholder participation. There were differences in perception linked to gender and hierarchical status; however, those differences were not as concise and significant as those linked to nationality. These findings indicate that participatory action research of this nature requires more targeted strategies and planning tailored to the type of activity. Such planning would result in more efficient and satisfactory communication, close collaboration, and mutual feedback to avoid conflicts and other problems. We further conclude that it would be advisable to carefully incorporate training on these aspects into future project designs."
https://openalex.org/W2617700775,"Fish, birds, insects and robots frequently swim or fly in groups. During their 3 dimensional collective motion, these agents do not stop, they avoid collisions by strong short-range repulsion, and achieve group cohesion by weak long-range attraction. In a minimal model that is isotropic, and continuous in both space and time, we demonstrate that (i) adjusting speed to a preferred value, combined with (ii) radial repulsion and an (iii) effective long-range attraction are sufficient for the stable ordering of autonomously moving agents in space. Our results imply that beyond these three rules ordering in space requires no further rules, for example, explicit velocity alignment, anisotropy of the interactions or the frequent reversal of the direction of motion, friction, elastic interactions, sticky surfaces, a viscous medium, or vertical separation that prefers interactions within horizontal layers. Noise and delays are inherent to the communication and decisions of all moving agents. Thus, next we investigate their effects on ordering in the model. First, we find that the amount of noise necessary for preventing the ordering of agents is not sufficient for destroying order. In other words, for realistic noise amplitudes the transition between order and disorder is rapid. Second, we demonstrate that ordering is more sensitive to displacements caused by delayed interactions than to uncorrelated noise (random errors). Third, we find that with changing interaction delays the ordered state disappears at roughly the same rate, whereas it emerges with different rates. In summary, we find that the model discussed here is simple enough to allow a fair understanding of the modeled phenomena, yet sufficiently detailed for the description and management of large flocks with noisy and delayed interactions.

To that end, this research develops a quantitative tool for use as a performance indicator of gradualness for firms entering external markets at a sectoral level. The performance indicator is based on firms' export volumes, number of years operating in the export market, geographic areas targeted for export and when exports began to each area. The indicator is tested empirically in the wine sector. The main contribution of this study is the creation of a reliable international priority index, which can serve more widely as a valuable tool because of its potential use in other industry sectors and geographic areas, and which would allow the analysis of how geographically differentiated internationalization strategies develop."

https://openalex.org/W2802390799,"We have known for decades that proteins consist of tens to thousands of amino acids strung together, but it has proven difficult to predict the function of a given protein based on its amino acid sequence. This difficulty rests on the overarching principle that the 3D structure of a protein determines its functionality by specifying with which other proteins and molecules it can interact. Conventional structural biology approaches, like X-ray crystallography, have enabled us to figure out the shapes and interactions of many rigidly folded proteins or their constituent domains. However, sometimes invisible to crystallographers are so-called low-complexity and intrinsically disordered regions of proteins, which often do not form stable and predictable 3D structures in physiological conditions or in the absence of their binding partners. Despite this conformational heterogeneity and flexibility, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and unstructured stretches of amino acids participate in many essential processes and provide new paradigms for protein-protein interactions. IDPs are generally thought to either conditionally establish secondary structure elements upon binding to their target or remain unfolded and participate in low-affinity, high-avidity dynamic interactions with other proteins. The former case can be exemplified by the formation of an α-helical region in the disordered domain of the transcription factor CREB upon binding to its transcriptional coactivator, CBP/p300 (Sugase et al., 2007Sugase K. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Mechanism of coupled folding and binding of an intrinsically disordered protein.Nature. 2007; 447: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Transient and multivalent interactions are perhaps best illustrated by the core selectivity filter of nuclear pore complexes, where proteins with low-complexity sequence regions dynamically bind and unbind at many sites on the surface of nuclear import or export receptors, which is thought to drive fast directional transport. Indeed, intrinsically disordered regions of proteins mediate many of the multivalent interactions that form the basis of phase-separated liquid droplets, which are now widely appreciated in myriad cellular processes like RNA processing (Schmidt and Gorlich, 2016Schmidt H.B. Gorlich D. Transport Selectivity of Nuclear Pores, Phase Separation, and Membraneless Organelles.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2016; 41: 46-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Technological innovation in protein structural biology, biophysics, molecular dynamics simulations, and single-molecule studies have enabled many advances in our understanding of how proteins or protein segments without defined structure uniquely contribute to important cellular processes. Several recent studies are challenging the long-held paradigms of how unstructured protein regions and peptides interact with their cognate partners to achieve specificity, affinity, and mechanostability—and to do what canonical interactions between globular domains simply cannot do. A recent study published in Nature uncovered an extremely high-affinity interaction between two IDPs, the linker histone H1 and its nuclear chaperone prothymosin-α. Surprisingly, the authors did not detect the formation of any transient secondary structure elements upon binding of these two unstructured proteins, despite the formation of a complex with incredibly strong binding and picomolar affinity. A variety of structural, biochemical, and modeling techniques led to the conclusion that the two proteins form an extremely dynamic complex wherein long-range electrostatic interactions lead to rapid interconversion between countless different combinations of oppositely charged residues and patches (Borgia et al., 2018Borgia A. Borgia M.B. Bugge K. Kissling V.M. Heidarsson P.O. Fernandes C.B. Sottini A. Soranno A. Bulhozer K.J. Nettels D. et al.Extreme disorder in an ultrahigh-affinity protein complex.Nature. 2018; 555: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). This striking new example expands the known universe of protein-protein interaction determinants and may defy conventional thinking about how protein structure determines function. While low-complexity protein domains have been implicated in liquid-liquid phase separation and the formation of membraneless organelles, like stress granules and P-bodies in eukaryotic cells, the precise molecular determinants governing these condensates have, in most cases, remained obscure. In a study published in Science, scientists determined the atomic structures of segments from several low-complexity domains implicated in phase separation and hydrogel formation and found that the short peptides consistently formed kinked beta sheet structures. While highly stable beta strands are core features of amyloid-forming proteins, the kinked nature of these LARKS (low-complexity, aromatic-rich, kinked segments) prevent cross-beta strand interactions among amino acid side chains that give amyloid fibrils their characteristic strength and irreversible nature. These molecular determinants lead to reversible protein meshworks among LARKS-containing proteins, forming the basis for phase-separated droplets. Strikingly, the authors found that hundreds of human proteins have the sequence propensity to form similar kinked beta strands and therefore may take part in multivalent interaction networks and phase separation (Hughes et al., 2018Hughes M.P. Sawaya M.R. Boyer D.R. Goldschmidt L. Rodriguez J.A. Cascio D. Chong L. Gonen T. Eisenberg D.S. Atomic structures of low-complexity protein segments reveal kinked B sheets that assemble networks.Science. 2018; 359: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). With more and more cellular processes relying on phase separation continually being uncovered, this list of proteins may lead to a treasure trove of new biology. In another extreme example of protein acrobatics, a paper recently published in Science showed that an adhesin protein from Staphylococcus species defies canonical interaction paradigms to establish the strongest known non-covalent protein association with its target—a staggering 10-fold higher mechanostability than biotin and streptavidin. The strength of this interaction with a segment of human fibrinogen is important for pathogenic staphylococci to form recalcitrant biofilms. The authors found that this remarkable stability is largely independent of amino acid side chains on the fibrinogen peptide, since mutating many residues and even replacing all the amino acids with glycine in a simulation did not impact the stability of the complex once it was bound. By bending the fibrinogen peptide into an elongated, corkscrew-like coiled shape that is buried within the adhesin protein and locked into place, the adhesin can achieve multivalent hydrogen bonding with the peptide backbone in a direction perpendicular to the shear force, thereby dissipating the mechanical stress over many individually weak bonds (Milles et al., 2018Milles L.F. Schulten K. Gaub H.E. Bernardi R.C. Molecular mechanism of extreme mechanostability in a pathogen adhesion.Science. 2018; 359: 1527-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The evolutionary pressures facing pathogenic bacteria could have favored the development of this unconventional mechanism for extreme mechanostability. In addition to these new examples of proteins breaking the traditional rules, scientists are also finding IDPs and low-complexity domains popping up in all kinds of interesting biological processes. From keeping tardigrades alive in extreme dessication (Boothby et al., 2017Boothby T.C. Tapia H. Brozena A.H. Piszkiewicz S. Smith A.E. Giovannini I. Rebecchi L. Pielak G.J. Koshland D. Goldstein B.

Kasparek P. Bumba L. Klein O.D. Sedlacek R. Sebo P. et al.Intrinsically disordered proteins drive enamel formation via an evolutionarily conserved self-assembly motif.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114: E1641-E1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), it is clear that biology is not constrained by neatly folded protein domains. At the same time, protein engineers are closer than ever to being able to design IDPs to assemble in programmable ways (Simon et al., 2017Simon J.R. Carroll N.J. Rubinstein M. Chilkoti A. López G.P. Programming molecular self-assembly of intrinsically disordered proteins containing sequences of low complexity.Nat. Chem. 2017; 9: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). As many labs around the world take a deep dive into the biophysics of protein-protein interactions with new tools at their disposal, who knows what they might find (or create) next? After all, rules are made to be broken."
