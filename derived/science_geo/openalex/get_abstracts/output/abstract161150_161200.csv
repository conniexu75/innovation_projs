Smad7 is induced by TGF-β, stably interacts with activated TGF-β type I receptor (TβR-I), and interferes with the phosphorylation of receptor-regulated Smads. Here we show that Smurf1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase for bone morphogenetic protein-specific Smads, also interacts with Smad7 and induces Smad7 ubiquitination and translocation into the cytoplasm. In addition, Smurf1 associates with TβR-I via Smad7, with subsequent enhancement of turnover of TβR-I and Smad7. These results thus reveal a novel function of Smad7, i.e. induction of degradation of TβR-I through recruitment of an E3 ligase to the receptor.

Type I receptor is activated by type II receptor upon ligand binding and mediates specific intracellular signals (2Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar). Members of the TGF-β superfamily transduce intracellular signals by Smad proteins. Eight different Smad proteins have been identified in mammals and are classified into three subgroups, i.e. receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), common-partner Smads (Co-Smads), and inhibitory Smads (I-Smads) (3Heldin C.-H.

Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). R-Smads directly interact with type I receptors and become activated through phosphorylation of the C-terminal SSXS motif. R-Smads then form heteromeric complexes with Co-Smads (Smad4) and translocate into the nucleus. Nuclear Smad complexes bind to transcriptional coactivators or corepressors and regulate transcription of target genes. Smad2 and Smad3 act in the TGF-β/activin pathway, whereas Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 are thought to act as bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-specific Smads. The third class of Smads are I-Smads, which include Smad6 and Smad7 in mammals (6Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 7Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Wrana J.L. Falb D.

Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). I-Smads associate with activated TGF-β superfamily type I receptors, thereby preventing phosphorylation of R-Smads. In addition, Smad6 has been demonstrated to interact with phosphorylated Smad1 to prevent complex formation between Smad1 and Smad4 (9Hata A. Lagna G. Massagué J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Smad6 was also reported to interact with Hoxc-8 and function as a transcriptional corepressor for inhibition of BMP signaling (10Bai S. Shi X. Yang X. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8267-8270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Because expression of Smad6 and Smad7 is induced by TGF-β and BMPs, I-Smads inhibit TGF-β superfamily signaling by a negative feedback system (11Miyazono K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation plays a key role in various biological processes, including signal transduction, cell cycle progression, and transcriptional regulation (12Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar). In the TGF-β signaling pathways, R-Smads, e.g. Smad2 and Smad1/5, have recently been shown to be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Smad2 activated by TGF-β is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway after translocation into the nucleus (13Lo R.S. Massagué J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Smurf1, a member of the HECT family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, ligand-independently induces the ubiquitination and degradation of BMP-specific Smads 1 and 5 through binding to a PY motif in the linker regions (14Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate a novel function of Smurf1 in receptor degradation in TGF-β superfamily signaling. Inhibitory Smad7 associates with Smurf1 in the nucleus and is exported to the cytoplasm. Smad7 thus recruits Smurf1 to TβR-I, resulting in the degradation and rapid turnover of the TβR-I protein. COS7 cells or 293T cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described (15Ebisawa T. Tada K. Kitajima I. Tojo K. Sampath T.K. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Imamura T. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3519-3527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For inhibition of proteasomal degradation, cells were incubated with 50 μm MG132 (Peptide Institute) or 10 μm lactacystin (Calbiochem) for 4 h. Each experiment has been repeated at least three times with essentially similar results. Recombinant TGF-β1 (R & D Systems) was iodinated using the chloramine T method. Cross-linking was performed on ice to avoid degradation of the receptors and other proteins. Subsequent immunoprecipitation and analysis by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) were performed as described (15Ebisawa T. Tada K. Kitajima I. Tojo K. Sampath T.K. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Imamura T. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3519-3527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical staining of 6Myc-Smad7 in transfected COS7 cells was performed using mouse anti-Myc antibody followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG as described (15Ebisawa T. Tada K. Kitajima I. Tojo K. Sampath T.K. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Imamura T. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3519-3527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For double staining of Smad7 and Smurf1, immunohistochemical staining of FLAG-Smad7 and 6Myc-Smurf1 was performed using mouse anti-FLAG or rabbit anti-Myc antibody followed by incubation with FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG or rhodamine isothiocyanate (RITC)-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG, respectively. Nuclei of the cells were stained by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Intracellular localization was determined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Cells were labeled for 10 min at 37 °C with 50 mCi/ml [35S]methionine and cysteine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and chased as described (13Lo R.S. Massagué J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Cells were then lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation. R mutant mink lung epithelial cells were transiently transfected with an appropriate combination of a p3TP-lux promoter-reporter construct, expression plasmids, and pcDNA3. Total amounts of transfected DNAs were the same in each experiment, and values were normalized using Renilla luciferase activity. Smurf1 has been identified as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for BMP-specific Smads (14Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Smurf1 has two WW domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions by binding to the PPXY sequence (PY motif) on partner proteins. Of eight different Smads, not only R-Smads including Smad1 and Smad5 but also I-Smads have a PY motif in their linker regions (Fig. 1A). We therefore examined whether Smurf1 binds to I-Smads. We first analyzed the interaction of Smurf1 with different Smads in transfected COS7 cells. A Smurf1 mutant, Smurf1(C710A), which has a mutation in the HECT domain and fails to recruit ligase activity, was used for this study. Of Smads 1 through 8, Smad6 and Smad7 strongly interacted with Smurf1(C710A) (Fig. 1B). Smurf1(C710A) interacted with Smad1 and Smad5 less efficiently than with Smad6 and Smad7. In contrast, it bound to Smad3 only weakly and failed to bind to Smads 2 and 4. Because Smad8 lacks the PY motif, Smurf1(C710A) did not bind to Smad8 either (Fig. 1B). The mode of interaction between Smad7 and Smurf1 was further studied. In COS7 cells, weak interaction of wild-type Smad7 (Smad7(WT)) with wild-type Smurf1 (Smurf1(WT)) was detected, and it was slightly facilitated in the presence of the constitutively active TGF-β type I receptor, TβR-I(TD) (Fig. 1C). Moreover, the interaction between Smurf1(WT) and Smad7 was enhanced by the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. In contrast, a Smad7 deletion mutant that lacks the PY motif (amino acids 207–211) in the linker region (Smad7ΔPY) did not bind to Smurf1. Smad7 interacts with TβR-I activated by TβR-II, thereby competing with Smad2 and Smad3 for inhibition of TGF-β signaling. We therefore examined in an affinity cross-linking assay whether Smad7 acts as an adapter molecule that links TβR-I to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Although Smurf1 alone did not efficiently bind to TβR-I in transfected COS7 cells, Smad7 dramatically enhanced the interaction between Smurf1 and the TβR-I·TβR-II complex (Fig. 1D, lanes 4 and5). Moreover, Smurf1 failed to interact with the receptor complex in the presence of Smad7ΔPY (Fig. 1D, lane 6). These results indicate that Smurf1 is recruited to TβR-I through Smad7. We next examined the effect of Smurf1 on the subcellular localization of Smad7. In the absence of Smurf1, both Smad7(WT) and Smad7ΔPY were predominantly located in the nucleus, although weak staining in the cytoplasm was also detected (Fig.2A). When transfected alone, Smurf1 was detected in the cytoplasm (data not shown). In the presence of Smurf1, Smad7(WT) was mainly observed in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic staining of Smad7 was further enhanced by the presence of proteasomal inhibitor MG132 or lactacystin (Fig. 2B). Smad7ΔPY failed to accumulate in the cytoplasm even in the presence of Smurf1, although there is a little leakage of Smad7ΔPY out of the nucleus (Fig. 2A); these results strongly suggest that interaction of Smurf1 with Smad7 is required for the cytoplasmic localization of Smad7. Consistent with this, Smurf1 and Smad7 colocalized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, similar findings were obtained using Smurf1(C710A), suggesting that recruitment of ligase activity is not required for cytoplasmic translocation of the Smad7·Smurf1 complex (Fig. 2B). An E3 ubiquitin ligase, MDM2, has been reported to promote ubiquitin-dependent degradation and nuclear export of p53 (16Boyd S.D. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 17Geyer R.K., Yu, Z.K. Maki C.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In this case, a mutation within the MDM2 RING-finger domain that cannot induce p53 ubiquitination also lacks the ability to promote the p53 nuclear export. Thus, both Smurf1 and MDM2 promote not only ubiquitin-dependent degradation but also nuclear export of the substrates, although the mechanisms of nuclear export appear to differ between them. Itoh et al. (18Itoh S. Landstrom M. Hermansson A. Itoh F. Heldin C.-H. Heldin N.-E. ten Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29195-29201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) reported that Smad7 is predominantly located in the nucleus and that it is exported to the cytoplasm after ligand stimulation. It is possible that Smurf1 functions as a carrier protein for Smad7 for nuclear export, although it is currently not known whether ligand stimulation triggers the nuclear export of Smad7 by Smurf1. To determine whether Smurf1 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for Smad7, ubiquitination of Smad7 by Smurf1 was investigated in vivo.Smad7 was transfected into COS7 cells, together with Smurf1 and HA-tagged ubiquitin. Smurf1 efficiently induced the ubiquitination of Smad7 (Fig. 3A). Notably, Smad7 ubiquitination occurred more efficiently than that of Smad1 or Smad4. Polyubiquitination of Smad7 was not observed when Smad7ΔPY or Smurf1(C710A) was used (Fig. 3B). We also tested the effect of Smad7 on TβR-I ubiquitination by Smurf1 in 293T cells. Although Smurf1 alone ubiquitinated TβR-I weakly, Smad7 enhanced the receptor ubiquitination by Smurf1 (Fig. 3C). To investigate whether Smurf1 regulates degradation of Smad7 and TβR-I, we analyzed turnover of these proteins by pulse-chase experiments. Smurf1(WT), but not Smurf1(C710A), enhanced the degradation of Smad7 (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting that Smurf1-induced Smad7 degradation is dependent on the HECT catalytic activity and through the proteasome. Smurf1(WT), but not Smurf1(C710A), was also rapidly degraded (Fig. 4B). Moreover, Smad7 and Smurf1 induced the degradation of TβR-I (Fig.4C). Our results thus demonstrate that Smad7 accelerates turnover of the TβR-I protein by recruitment of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, Smurf1. To examine the effect of Smurf1 on the inhibitory activity of Smad7, we first compared the effect of Smad7ΔPY with that of Smad7(WT) using a TGF-β-responsible promoter-reporter construct, p3TP-lux (Fig.4D). Smad7ΔPY suppressed activation of the reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner, but its inhibitory effect was less potent than that of Smad7(WT), suggesting that the interaction of Smad7 with Smurf-like molecules is important for efficient inhibition of TGF-β signaling by Smad7. Next, we tested the effect of Smurf1 on the inhibitory activity of Smad7 using p3TP-lux (Fig. 4E). Smurf1(WT), but not Smurf1(C710A), enhanced the inhibitory activity of Smad7. These data indicate that E3 ligase activity of Smurf1 is crucial for its effect on the inhibitory activity of Smad7. I-Smads have been shown to regulate TGF-β superfamily signaling through multiple mechanisms, e.g. competition with R-Smads for type I receptor interaction, inhibition of complex formation between R-Smads and Co-Smads, and transcriptional repression by interaction with transcription factors, such as Hoxc-8 (6Imamura T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 8267-8270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Our present findings revealed a novel mechanism for the inhibitory activity of Smad7. Although degradation of receptor complexes by Smurf1 may not be absolutely required for the action of I-Smads, it may play an important role in the negative regulation of TGF-β superfamily signaling by I-Smads. The present findings also suggest that E3 ligases of the Smurf family regulate TGF-β superfamily signaling through dual mechanisms. (i) By interaction with and degradation of R-Smads, Smurf1 negatively regulates BMP signaling. (ii) Smurf1 also interacts with Smad7 and inhibits TGF-β signaling by receptor degradation. Recently, another Smurf, Smurf2, has been suggested to exhibit similar dual specificities. Lin et al.(19Lin X. Liang M. Feng X.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36818-36822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) reported that Smurf2 interacts with Smad2, as well as other R-Smads, and induces the degradation of Smad2. Moreover, Kavsaket al. (20Kavsak P. Rasmussen R.K. Causing C.G. Bonni S. Zhu H. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1365-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar) reported that Smurf2 binds to TGF-β receptor complex via Smad7 and causes degradation of receptors and Smad7. It will be important to determine in the future whether there are some functional differences between Smurf1 and Smurf2in vivo, especially in the interaction with I-Smads or receptors. We thank G. H.

Because of the pathophysiologic role of endothelial dysfunction in severe inflammatory disease and sepsis, we explored the possibility that rhAPC might directly modulate endothelial function, independent of its anticoagulant activity. Using broad transcriptional profiling, we show that rhAPC directly modulates patterns of endothelial cell gene expression clustering into anti-inflammatory and cell survival pathways. rhAPC directly suppressed expression of p50 and p52 NFκB subunits, resulting in a functional decrease in NFκB binding at target sites. Further, rhAPC blocked expression of downstream NFκB regulated genes following tumor necrosis factor α induction, including dose-dependent suppression of cell adhesion expression and functional binding of intracellular adhesion molecule 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and E-selectin. Further, rhAPC modulated several genes in the endothelial apoptosis pathway, including the Bcl-2 homologue protein and inhibitor of apoptosis protein. These pathway changes resulted in the ability of rhAPC to inhibit the induction of apoptosis by the potent inducer, staurosporine.

The elucidation of cytokines following insult, particularly tumor necrosis factor α (TNF),1 initiates cell surface activation affecting a number of pathways (e.g. oxidation, adhesion, cytokine release, apoptosis, and nitric oxide production), as well as releasing a tissue factor that further contributes to inflammation though thrombin-induced activation of endothelium, platelets, and vascular smooth muscle (1Coughlin S.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 514-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The overall result of this cellular activation is a dysregulation of endothelial function, leading to microvascular thrombosis, end organ damage, multiple organ dysfunction, and often death (2Wheeler A.P. Bernard G.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 3Bone R.C. Ann. Intern. Med. 1991; 115: 457-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). In the last several years, blocking disseminated intravascular coagulation, and the microthrombi that may promote end-organ dysfunction, has been proposed as a new target for clinical treatment in sepsis (4Levi M. ten Cate H. van der Poll T. van Deventer S.J. JAMA. 1993; 270: 975-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Human protein C is a plasma serine protease that plays a key role in maintaining normal hemostasis (5Esmon C.T. Arterioscler.

The thrombin-activated form of protein C (APC) acts as a feedback inhibitor of the coagulation cascade and has demonstrated antithrombotic activity in numerous model systems (7Grinnell B.W. Yan S.B. Coron. Artery Dis. 1998; 9: 89-97PubMed Google Scholar). APC has shown efficacy in models of lethal endotoxemia and has been reported to prevent microvascular coagulation in patients with meningococcal sepsis (8Rintala E. Seppala O.P. Kotilainen P. Pettila V. Rasi V. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 26: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 9Smith O.P. White B. Vaughan D. Rafferty M. Claffey L. Lyons B. Casey W.

Haemostasis. 1999; 199A: 738Google Scholar). A recombinant version of human activated protein C (rhAPC) is completing clinical evaluation in patients with severe sepsis, targeting the effects of microvascular coagulation. However, there has been considerable speculation both historically and recently (13Garber K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 917-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) as to the mechanism of the apparent efficacy of APC in the treatment of sepsis, with the implication that the beneficial activity must be more that just antithrombotic. Although the critical role of APC in modulating microvascular coagulation through the inhibition of thrombin generation has been well studied, its direct effects on endothelial function have not been elucidated. We used a novel approach of broad transcriptional profiling and cluster analysis to define possible new molecular mechanisms for the APC pathway in vascular endothelial function. Transcript profiling, the simultaneous monitoring of gene expression for a significant portion of a genome, has emerged as a powerful tool in genetics and biology, because it allows for the analysis of many of the signal transduction pathways and other biological systems identified from the sequencing of the human genome (14Lander E.S. Science. 1996; 274: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). This profiling has been used to reveal novel targets and mechanisms of action using yeast as a model system (15Marton M. DeRisi J. Bennett H. Iyer V. Meyer M. Roberts C. Stoughton R. Burchard J. Slade D. Dai H. Bassett D.J. Hartwell L. Brown P. Friend S. Nat.

Schultz P. Science. 1998; 281: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Using this novel approach, we demonstrate that rhAPC directly modulates cell signaling and alters gene expression in two major pathways of inflammation and apoptosis. rhAPC suppressed NFκB-modulated genes by directly reducing NFκB expression and functional activity. Further, rhAPC inhibited cytokine signaling, including TNF-induction of cell surface adhesion molecules (e.g. VCAM, ICAM, E-selectin, and fractalkine). rhAPC also modulated apoptosis pathways, including up-regulation of the endothelial Bcl-2 homolog (A1), eNOS, and the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP), and suppression of the apoptosis-associated genes calreticulin and TRMP-2. Moreover, treatment of cells with rhAPC blocked the induction of apoptosis. These data provide a novel view of how inflammation is modulated at the endothelial cell level and defines new relationships among hemostasis, inflammation, and cell death/apoptosis. Moreover, our results demonstrate the value of gene profiling in defining novel mechanisms of drug action and specifically in providing possible mechanistic answers to rhAPC efficacy in sepsis. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and pools HUVEC PO96, P146, or P150 were grown in endothelial growth medium with 2% FBS (Clonetics, San Diego, CA). Cells were prepared untreated or treated with rhAPC (Eli Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, IN) and/or TNFα (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). For the Affymetrix™ experiment, cells were treated with APC for 16 h and TNF for the last 7 h. For the four conditions (untreated; vehicle of 0.1% bovine serum albumin in Tris/NaCl, 183 nm APC; 1 ng/ml TNF; and 1 ng/ml TNF plus 183 nm APC) cells were observed for a total of 16 h. EAhy926 cells (17Gray N. Wodicka L. Thunnissen A. Norman T. Kwon S. Espinoza F. Morgan D. Barnes G. LeClerc S. Meijer L. Kim S. Lockhart D. Schultz P. Science. 1998; 281: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), obtained from the University of North Carolina, were grown in T-75 flasks with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (3:1), 5% FBS, 50 μm/liter gentamicin, and 20 mm/liter HEPES. Cells were grown to confluence (70–90%) and were treated under various conditions as described in individual experiments. TNF concentrations were 1 ng/ml, and APC ranged from 8 nm to 180 nm. Cells were treated at various time points between 4 and 48 h. In control experiments, recombinant hirudin (lepirudin rDNA) was added to the cell culture medium at ∼1 μg/ml. There was no residual thrombin in any of the preparations as determined by amidolytic assay using S-2366 (Chromogenix) for thrombin proteolytic activity, compared with control thrombin at subnanomolar concentrations. During the course of the experiments, samples were tested for amidolytic activity in the presence and absence of hirudin, and no significant thrombin activity could be detected (<25 pm limit of detection). Cells were washed, and total RNA was isolated by Triazol™ (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's recommendations. RNA was stored at −80 °C in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated deionized water. Detailed methods for labeling the samples and subsequent hybridization to the arrays are available from Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 1.5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was converted to double-stranded cDNA (Superscript; Life Technologies, Inc.) priming the first-strand synthesis with a T7-(dT)24 primer containing a T7 polymerase promoter. 1 μg of double-stranded cDNA was subsequently used as a template to generate biotinylated cRNA using the incorporated T7 promoter sequence in an in vitrotranscription system (Megascript kit; Ambion and Bio-11-CTP and Bio-16-UTP; Enzo). Control oligonucleotides and spikes were added to 15 μg of cRNA, which was then hybridized to Hu6800 oligonucleotide arrays for 16 h at 45 °C with constant rotation. The arrays were then washed and stained on an Affymetrix fluidics station using the EUKGE-WS1 protocol and scanned on an Affymetrix GeneArray scanner. Data analysis was performed using GeneChip 3.1 software. Internal controls of housekeeping genes and a test chip trial were run prior to test samples. A semiquantitative RT-PCR assay was used to follow up on Affymetrix data. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 4 μg of total RNA (Superscript; Life Technologies, Inc.). After first-strand synthesis, the cDNA was diluted to a final volume of 160 μl and normalized using β-actin as the reference. Control primers for human cytoplasmic β-actin were as follows: primer L1, 5′ CGTCATACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACATCTGC 3′; and primer R1, 5′ ATCTGGCACCACACCTTCTACAATGAGCTGCG-3′. Control primers for human transferrin receptor were as follows: primer 5pri, 5′-CTTTCTGTTTTTGCGAGGACACA-3′; and primer 3pri, 5′-TCCAAGTAGCTAGAGCCAACTGGTT-3′. Multiplexed PCR reactions were performed containing 0.5 pmol of each actin, 7.5 pmol of each transferrin receptor, and 5.0 pmol of each gene-specific primer. A 25-μl reaction containing 4 μl of normalized cDNA was performed using cDNA advantage polymerase mix (CLONTECH) using the following cycling reactions: step 1, 94 °C for 5 min; step 2, 94 °C for 45 s; step 3, 60 °C for 45 s; step 4, 72 °C for 2 min; step 5, repeat steps 2–4 19, 24, or 29 times; and step 6, 72 °C for 7 min. 4 μl of load dye was then added (Bluejuice; Life Technologies, Inc.), and 5 μl were loaded onto 2% agarose gels. Reactions containing Buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KC1, 5 mmMgC12, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol), poly(dI·dC), nuclear extract, and labeled oligonucleotide were incubated for 15–45 min. In some experiments antibodies to NFκB subunits were also included in the reaction. Complexes were run on 5% (0.5× TBE) polyacrylamide gels (Owl, Inc.). The probe was γ-32P-labeled (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and nuclear extracts from Eahy926 and HUVEC were prepared as described (18Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). Samples were run for 90 min at 110 V, 2.0 A in 1/2× TBE running buffer. Gels were dried on DE81 paper and developed overnight on Kodak film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY), and monoclonal antibodies to NFκBp65, NFκBp50, and NFκBp52 (NFκB2) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were used for specificity controls. Quantification of gel shift to a consensus NFκB-C 5′-CAGTTGAGGGGACTCCAGGCC-3“ site was performed by a scanning phosphorimager. Primary antibody at 1–2 μg/ml in 100 μl of FACS buffer (PBS, 5% albumin, 0.02% sodium azide) was applied at 4 °C for 30 min. The secondary antibody, anti-mouse IgG-FITC, at 1 μg/ml in 100 μl of FACS buffer was applied at 4 °C for 30 min. FACS analysis was done with a CoulterTM flow cytometer (Coulter). Primary antibodies were to adhesion markers ICAM-1, E-selectin, VCAM-1, and fractalkine (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Cells were seeded at 3 × 104 cells per well in a 96-well plate and treated with 1 μg/ml staurosporine (Sigma) for 1 h or with staurosporine and APC (pretreatment for 16 h). Cells were prepared and stained according to APOPercentageTM apoptosis assay per the manufacturer's instructions (Biocolor Ltd., Belfast, Northern Ireland). The effect of rhAPC on TNF-activated or non-activated human endothelial cells was assessed using transcript profiling with AffymetrixTM microarrays. Treatments were performed under conditions where no thrombin or other protease activity could be detected, and no detectable thrombin was being generated during the cell culture experiments as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After treatment, cells were lysed and mRNA was isolated, followed by analysis on AffymetrixTM arrays, and results were confirmed by semiquantitative RT-PCR. We found that rhAPC and TNF treatments of HUVECs resulted in 10 genes that were regulated by rhAPC alone and 31 genes regulated by TNF alone. Shown in Table I are the genes whose expression was altered by rhAPC treatment alone and 13 genes of the 31 TNF-regulated genes that we found to be comodulated by rhAPC. In general, the genes clustered with respect to cellular function into those involved in inflammation/immune modulation and cell survival/apoptosis. We also observed that the TNF-activated genes, which primarily fell into the proinflammatory and apoptotic pathways, were counter modulated by the rhAPC treatment. There were several TNF-activated genes, associated with feedback pathways for controlling TNF responses, (19Karsan A. Yee E. Kaushansky K. Harlan J.M. Blood. 1996; 87: 3089-3096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that were further enhanced by rhAPC treatment. Notably, the TNF-activated A20 gene, which was enhanced by rhAPC, has recently been shown in knockout experiments to be critical in regulating TNF-induced effects and cell death responses (20Lee E.G. Boone D.L. Chai S. Libby S.L. Chien M. Lodolce J.P. Ma A. Science. 2000; 289: 2350-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). Overall, the pattern of gene expression modulated by rhAPC was consistent with an induction of anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic pathways.Table ISelected genes modulated by rhAPC in human endothelial cellsGenes modulated by rhAPCAPC effectFunctional categoryAccession numberNFκB2DECInflammatoryCNS76638PCNAINCCell cycleCJ05614Human autoAg calreticulinDECImmune reg./proapoptoticCM84739Human A1 Bcl-2 homologueINCAntiapoptosisCNU29680Human Gu helicaseINCAntiapoptosisCU41387Human IAPINCAntiapoptosisNU45878eNOSINCNitric oxide/apoptosisCNM93718Orphan G protein-coupled receptor (RDC1)DECOrphan GPCRCU67784TRMP-2DECProapoptoticM63379B61 (Ephrin-A1)DECChemoattractCM57730Genes activated by TNF that are suppressed by APCNFκB2InflammatoryCNS76638ICAM-1AdhesionCNM24283E-selectinAdhesionCNM24736Fractalkine precursor (CX3C)AdhesionCNU84487VCAM-1AdhesionCNM30257Manganese superoxide dismutaseOxidationCNX65965Stromelysin-2Matrix metalloCX07820Genes activated by TNF and further enhanced by APCHuman A1 Bcl-2 homologueAntiapoptosisCU29680Human Gu helicaseCell cycleCNU41387Human IAP homologue BAntiapoptosisNU45878TNF α-induced A20AntiapoptosisCNM59465Homo sapiens MAD-3 (IκB)AntiapoptosisCNU68019Genes suppressed by TNF and activated by APCPCNACell survivalCJ05614Of the genes that changed with APC treatment in the endothelial array experiment, genes were functionally clustered into categories listed below.

Genes known to be NFκB-regulated are noted (N). Only genes showing at least a 2-fold change in array experiments are listed. DEC, decrease; INC, increase; reg., regulation. A very notable change observed on the transcript profile following rhAPC treatment was a suppression of p52 (NFκB2 subunit) on the array. Further analysis of the array results indicated that expression of this NFκB subunit was suppressed both by rhAPC alone and in combination with TNF (Fig.1 A). The average difference from the 20 perfect and mismatch signals on the Affymetrix array demonstrated a reduction in NFκB2 mRNA by rhAPC, with or without TNF cotreatment. Semiquantitative RT-PCR confirmed that the NFκB2 mRNA was suppressed by rhAPC alone and that rhAPC attenuated its induction by TNF (data not shown). To further examine the functional effect of the suppression at the mRNA level, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) for NFκB was used to determine the amount of NFκB DNA binding in nuclear extracts from treated HUVECs using a32P-labeled oligonucleotide consensus probe to NFκB. (Fig. 1 B). In repeated experiments, rhAPC alone suppressed NFκB nuclear extract DNA binding by ∼60% (n = 4), consistent with the reduced mRNA expression (lanes 1 and2). Moreover, in repeated experiments, rhAPC also attenuated the amount of binding following TNF induction of NFκB (lanes 3–5). In addition to these results using HUVECs, we obtained the same results using the Eahy926 (21Edgell C.J. McDonald C.C. Graham J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3734-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar) human endothelial line (data not shown). The specificity of the EMSA binding assays was demonstrated with antibody supershifts to p65, p50 (NFκB1), and p52 (NFκB2), as well as competition with cold consensus sequence (data not shown). This showed that the effect was specific and that rhAPC a can directly inhibit the functional NFκB pathway (both NFκB1 and NFκB2) in endothelial cells. As shown in Table I, a number of TNF-modulated genes were counter-modulated by rhAPC, and the induction of many of these genes has previously been shown to be mediated through NFκB (see Table I). We focused additional studies on the adhesion molecules as being of particular importance with regard to anti-inflammatory effects. Semiquantitative RT-PCR confirmed that rhAPC mediated suppression of several of the adhesion molecule mRNAs (induced by TNF) including CX3C (fractalkine) (22Bazan J.F. Bacon K.B. Hardiman G. Wang W. Soo K. Rossi D. Greaves D.R. Zlotnik A. Schall T.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1703) Google Scholar), ICAM-1, E-selectin, and VCAM-1 (23Parent C. Eichacker P.Q. Infect. Dis. Clin. North Am. 1999; 13: 427-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). By flow cytometry, we confirmed that ICAM-1 surface expression induced by TNF could be suppressed by rhAPC in endothelial cells (Fig.2 A). The effect of APC on the reduction in ICAM-1 expression was concentration-dependent, as shown in Fig. 2 B. Similarly, we have shown that rhAPC could inhibit the expression both E-selectin and VCAM-1, two other important leukocyte adhesion molecules. As shown in Fig. 2 C, rhAPC reduced cell surface E-selectin expression, measured by flow cytometry, in a concentration-dependent manner. Further, using a direct cell binding assay, dependent on the interaction of endothelial VCAM-1 and very late antigen-4 on a target cell (U937), we demonstrate that rhAPC directly inhibits the cell-cell interaction up-regulated by TNF (Fig. 2 D). Additional studies with VCAM-1 and fractalkine showed comparable dose-dependent inhibition by rhAPC. In addition to the described effect of rhAPC on NFκB and its downstream mediation of inflammation, our profiling results also suggested a second clustering around pathways promoting antiapoptosis and cell survival. As shown in Fig. 3 A, rhAPC suppress two proapoptotic genes, calreticulin, an endoplasmic reticulum luminal protein that when suppressed has been shown to decrease cell apoptosis (24Nakamura K. Bossy-Wetzel E. Burns K. Fradel M. Lozyk M. Goping I. Opas M. Bleackly R. Green D. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), and TRMP-2, a marker of cell apoptosis (25Cervellera M. Raschella G. Santilli G. Tanno B. Ventura A. Mancini C. Sevignani C. Calabretta B. Sala A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21055-21060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In contrast, rhAPC increased genes shown to be antiapoptotic or markers of cell survival such as A1 (19Karsan A. Yee E. Kaushansky K. Harlan J.M. Blood. 1996; 87: 3089-3096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), IAP (26Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar), cell cycle-related human Gu helicase (27Valdez B.C. Henning D. Perlaky L. Busch R.K. Busch H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (28Kelman Z. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Interestingly, rhAPC also significantly up-regulated eNOS, which is important in view of the significant role it plays as an endothelial survival factor (reviewed in Ref. 29Dimmeler S. Zeiher A.M. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 964-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Considering this pattern of gene expression, experiments were performed to determine whether rhAPC could actually block the induction of apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 3 B, Eahy926 endothelial cells treated with staurosporine, a potent inducer of the cell death pathway, underwent apoptotic cell death by 3 h post-treatment. However, treatment with rhAPC significantly reduced the number of cells undergoing apoptosis. We observed a similar protective effect using kidney 293 cells and HUVECs, which were extremely sensitive to apoptotic induction. In repeated and quantified experiments, rhAPC significantly blocked the induction of apoptosis in each of these cells (Fig. 3 C). The effect of rhAPC on the inhibition of apoptosis was dose-dependent with concentrations as low as ∼2 nm effectively suppressing the induction of apoptosis. Further, these apoptosis results were confirmed by intracellular staining of caspase 3 (data not shown). As indicated above, we observed no significant thrombin generation during the course of our cell culture experiments analyzing the effect of APC on endothelial function. However, to assure that the observed effects were independent of the ability of APC to inhibit the generation of thrombin, studies were conducted in the presence of hirudin, a potent thrombin inhibitor. In repeated experiments in which hirudin was included in the cell culture treatments, we found no effect of this inhibitor on the anti-inflammatory and apoptosis responses with or without APC (data not shown). In the apoptosis analysis shown in Fig. 3, the addition of hirudin had no effect on the ability of APC to suppress staurosporine-induced apoptosis. The addition of hirudin also had no effect on the apoptosis suppression by APC as measured by caspase 3 staining. Moreover, we found no effect of thrombin inhibition on the ability of APC to suppress the TNF activation of the cell surface adhesion markers as in Fig. 2, measuring both VCAM and ICAM levels. Thus, the effect of APC on modulating endothelial cell pathways was independent of its ability to inhibit thrombin generation. We have utilized a novel approach to define new molecular pathways for the subcellular action of the anticoagulant human protein C. Moreover, our data demonstrate the power of transcriptional profiling in defining drug mechanism and implications for disease therapy. In Fig. 4, we diagram the expanded paradigm of the physiological role of APC. We have found that beyond its indirect effect on inflammation, via inhibition of thrombin generation, APC has novel direct anti-inflammatory effects via suppression of the NFκB pathway and an apparent ability to prevent apoptosis and modulate cell survival. This effect of rhAPC on inhibiting apoptosis appears to be separate and antithetical to most of the TNF/NFκB pathway effects, yet consistent with an effect that would be beneficial in antithrombotic/anti-inflammatory situations. In fact, there is growing evidence for the role of apoptosis in systemic inflammatory response and sepsis (30Papathanassoglou E.D. Moynihan J.A. Ackerman M.H. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 28: 537-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 31Stefanec T. Chest. 2000; 117: 841-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 32Mahidhara R. Billiar T.R. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 28: N105-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The emerging data suggest that organs-specific cell death involving both parenchymal and microvascular endothelium underlies organ dysfunction, with increased apoptotic rates occurring in organ dysfunction. The concept of suppression of proinflammatory pathways and the switch to cellular survival mechanisms at the endothelial interface suggests a complex adaptive response at the vessel wall directly connected at the subcellular level to the action of APC. The protein C pathway in inflammatory states could protect the organism from vascular insult and possibly prolong endothelial, cellular, and organ survival. The ability of APC to suppress the up-regulation of adhesion molecules demonstrates a significant anti-inflammatory activity and, in conjunction with antithrombotic activity, further supports its role in severe systemic inflammatory disorders, including sepsis. The latter is strongly supported by studies in the ICAM-1 knockout mouse with no endothelial surface ICAM-1 that is resistant to induction of sepsis (33Xu H. Gonzalo J.A. St Pierre Y. Williams I.R. Kupper T.S. Cotran R.S. Springer T.A. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) and protected from ischemic renal injury (34Kelly K.J. Williams Jr., W.W. Colvin R.B. Meehan S.M. Springer T.A. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Bonventre J.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1056-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Recently, diminished neutrophil myeloperoxidase activity in a renal ischemia reperfusion animal model suggested suppression of inflammation related to APC and adhesion, further supporting our proposed mechanism (35Mizutani A. Okajima K. Uchiba M. Noguchi T. Blood. 2000; 95: 3781-3787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, failure of endothelial function in severe inflammatory processes without the immune modulatory influences of APC may help explain both the adverse outcomes of septic patients with protein C deficiency and the favorable outcomes seen in meningococcal purpura fulminans patients receiving protein C and APC treatment (9Smith O.P.

Further investigation of the broader effects of NFκB suppression by APC on endothelium and immune leukocytes may help expand our understanding of the link between coagulation and inflammation and those disease states where protein C pathway regulation is important. APC may play a physiological role in other disease states involving endothelial inflammation and apoptosis e.g. arteriosclerosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, systemic vasculitis syndromes, allograft vasculopathy (37Tsuchida A. Thompson N.M. Salem H.H. Atkins R.C. Hancock W.W. Transplant Proc. 1990; 22: 2134-2136PubMed Google Scholar), hepatic veno-occlusive disease (38Lee J. Lee K.H. Kim S. Lee J.S. Kim W.K. Park C.J. Chi H.S. Kim S.H. Bone Marrow Transplant. 1998; 22: 883-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and sickle cell syndromes (39Shiu Y. Udden M.M. McIntire L.V. Blood. 2000; 95: 3232-3241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, ongoing studies will help define the role of other possible inflammation/immune modulation pathways suggested from our broad profiling (e.g. chemoattractant B61 (Table I) and the suppression of Class I human lymphocyte antigen genes; data not shown). Recently, the endothelial protein C receptor (40Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26486-26491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has been demonstrated to be important in survival in the baboon sepsis model (41Taylor F.B. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Ferrell G. Chang A.C. Laszik Z. Kosanke S. Peer G. Esmon C.T. Blood. 2000; 95: 1680-1686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It will be important to determine whether this receptor is involved in the cell signaling we have observed with rhAPC. At the time of this writing, enrollment in the PROWESS trial, a phase III, placebo-controlled, 28-day, all-cause mortality study, was stopped early based on interim analysis showing that trial results met the criteria for reduced mortality among rhAPC-treated patients. There has been considerable speculation, both historically and recently (13Garber K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 917-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), as to the mechanism of the apparent efficacy of APC in the treatment of sepsis. Our data provide additional mechanistic understanding, not only for the physiologic role of APC, but for its potential therapeutic role in sepsis and systemic inflammatory responses.

The Ub ligase (E3) catalyzes the formation of polyubiquitin chains onto substrate proteins via isopeptide bonds utilizing the Ubs that have been sequentially activated by enzymes E1 and E2. Polyubiquitinated substrates are then rapidly degraded by the 26 S proteasome (11Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). The SCF and the APC are the two major Ub ligase complexes that regulate ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis during G1/S and anaphase (12Peters J.M. Curr. Opin.

Point mutations in the RING finger domain of ROC1 completely disrupted the Ub ligase activity, suggesting an essential role of the domain for its activity (7Ohta T. Michel J.J. Schottelius A.J.

More recently, several large RING finger proteins, such as MDM2, c-Cbl, IAP, and AO7, with otherwise diverse structures and functions were linked to ubiquitination (13Honda R. Yasuda H.

One of these RING proteins, BRCA1, has been closely scrutinized for Ub ligase activity. However, the ability of BRCA1 by itself to promote ubiquitin polymerization was found to be limited (16Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). In this report, we have provided evidence demonstrating that the RING finger of BRCA1, in concert with BARD1, exhibits significant ubiquitin ligase activity. This activity can be disrupted by a breast cancer-derived RING finger mutation of BRCA1, suggesting a direct relationship between the ubiquitin ligase function of BRCA1 and breast cancer development. cDNAs for full-length human BARD1 and CstF-50 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a Hela cell cDNA library with pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector inframe with appropriate tags. pGEX-BARD1-(1–111) was created by digesting the full-length BARD1 with HindIII, and subcloning into the pGEX-KG vector. pET-His6-BARD1-(14–189) and pET-His6-BARD1-(25–189) were created by digesting the full-length BARD1 with BamHI and PstI, andNcoI and PstI, respectively and subcloned into the pET-3E-His6 vector. Full-length BRCA1 cDNA was a generous gift from Dr. Wen-Hwa Lee. The N-terminal fragment (1) of BRCA1 was generated by digesting the full-length BRCA1 at itsKpnI restriction site and subcloning into either the pGEX vector or the pcDNA3 vector with the appropriate tag. pGEX-BRCA1-(1–342) was created by self-ligation ofBglII-digested pGEX-BRCA1-(1–772). pET-His6-BRCA1-(1–304) was created by digesting BRCA1-(1–772) with EcoRI and subcloning into the pET-3E-His6 vector. BRCA1 or BARD1 point mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). cDNA for each human E2/Ubc was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a HeLa cell cDNA library and subcloned into the pET-3E-His6vector. cDNA for human E2F1 and cyclin B1 in the pcDNA3 expression vector were gifts from Dr. Yue Xiong. All the constructs used were verified by DNA sequencing. Cells (293T) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10#x0025; fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic agent (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a 37 #x00B0;C incubator with 5#x0025; CO2. DNA was transfected using the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method. For each transfection, the total plasmid DNA was adjusted to 15 μg per 100-mm dish by adding the parental pcDNA3 vector. For immunoprecipitation, cells were harvested 36 h after transfection and lysed by incubating at 4 °C for 1 h with 0.6 ml per 100 mm dish of buffer A containing 15 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.5m NaCl, 0.35#x0025; Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 150 μg/ml benzamidine. Lysed cells were then clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g at 4 °C for 1 h. The supernatants (0.3 ml) were mixed with 3 μg of anti-Myc (9E10) or anti-HA (12CA5) antibody, and then the antibody-bound proteins were precipitated with protein A-agarose beads (7.5 μl). The proteins bound to the beads were used either for the Ub ligation assay or immunoblotting. For straight immunoblotting to analyze the steady-state levels of Myc-BRCA1 or HA-BARD1, the transfected cells were lysed and clarified as described above, and 50 μg of each sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% gel, followed by immunoblotting. Rabbit E1 was purchased from Affiniti Research Products. His6-tagged Ub with a protein kinase C recognition site, His6-tagged E2 proteins, and His6-E2F1 were purified as previously described (7Ohta T. Michel J.J. Schottelius A.J. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 535-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 17Ohta T. Xiong Y. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1347-1353PubMed Google Scholar). His6-BARD1-(14–189), His6-BARD1-(25–189), His6-BRCA1-(1–304), GST-BRCA1-(1–342) and GST-BARD1-(1–111) were produced in BL21/DE3 bacteria by induction with 0.4 mmIPTG for 12 h at 25 °C. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% NP-40, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors, and the proteins were purified either with nickel beads (Qiagen) or glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The procedure for the in vitroUb ligation assay was essentially the same as previously described (7Ohta T. Michel J.J. Schottelius A.J. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 535-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar,18Ohta T. Michel J.J. Xiong Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6758-6766Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The BRCA1-BARD1 immunocomplexes immobilized on protein A-agarose beads were washed three times with buffer A and two times with buffer B containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm EDTA, and added to a ubiquitin ligation reaction mixture (30 μl) that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, 10 nm okadaic acid, 2 mmATP, 0.6 mm DTT, 0.75 μg of 32P-Ub, 40 ng of E1, and 0.3 μg of E2 protein. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C with shaking, the reactions were terminated by boiling in Laemmli SDS-loading buffer with 0.1 m DTT, and half of the sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. For the in vitro Ub ligation assay using the purified RING finger domain of BRCA1 or BARD1, GST-fused proteins bound to glutathione-agarose beads, and eluted His6-tagged proteins were used instead of immunocomplexes. The activity of E2 was analyzed by the same procedure without E3. The discovery that the small RING finger proteins, ROC1 and ROC2, are ubiquitin ligases prompted us to determine whether BRCA1 and BARD1, two of the most important RING finger proteins implicated in breast cancer, also function as ubiquitin ligases. We first determined which E2/Ubc could be activated by BRCA1 or BARD1. Five representative mammalian E2s (UbcH1, UbcH2, Cdc34, UbcH5c and UbcH7) were purified from bacteria (Fig.1 A). Individual E2s were incubated with E1 and 32P-Ub in the presence of ATP to verify their Ub binding capacity. Four of the five E2s (UbcH2, Cdc34, UbcH5c, and UbcH7) were determined to be active enzymes by judging the ability to bind to 32P-Ub (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3–6, lower panel), and was dissociated by addition of DTT (lanes 3–6, upper panel). When the anti-Myc immunocomplex derived from Myc-BRCA1-(1–772) or Myc-BARD1-transfected 293T cells was added to the reaction, only UbcH5c among the five E2s was capable of promoting ubiquitin polymerization with the immunocomplex as determined by the appearance of a high molecular weight 32P smear (Fig. 1 C, lanes 4 and 9). Although a crystal structure study revealed the interaction between the RING finger of c-Cbl and UbcH7 (19Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), UbcH7 was deficient in collaborating with the RING finger of BRCA1 or BARD1 to promote Ub polymerization (lanes 5 and 10). These results suggest that the BRCA1- and BARD1-associated protein complexes contain Ub ligase activities. We noted that the Ub ligase activities of the BRCA1 and BARD1 immunocomplexes, which were only detectable after long exposure of the film (Fig. 1 C), were very low and sought conditions for higher activity. Because it was reported that BRCA1 and BARD1 proteins preferentially formed stable heterodimers (6Meza J.E. Brzovic P.S. King M-C. Klevit R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5659-5665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we next tested whether the BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer complex formation affects Ub ligase activity. Surprisingly, when Myc-BRCA1-(1–772) was co-transfected with HA-BARD1, the anti-Myc immunocomplex exhibited significantly higher Ub ligase activity (Fig.2 A, lane 5) than that of either the Myc-BARD1 (lane 3) or Myc-BRCA1-(1–772) (lane 4) single transfection. It is possible that the low Ub ligase activity detected with the immunocomplexes from single transfections of BRCA1 or BARD1 may be caused by contamination with the endogenous partner RING finger protein. Similarly, addition of Myc-BRCA1-(1–772) dramatically enhanced the Ub ligase activity of the HA-BARD1 immunocomplex (lane 8). E2F1 and cyclin B1, the proteins known to interact with the N terminus of BRCA1 (20Wang H. Shao N. Ding Q.M. Cui J. Reddy E.S. Rao V.N. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), as well as CstF50, a protein that binds to BARD1 (21Kleiman F.E. Manley J.L. Science. 1999; 285: 1576-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) do not have a stimulatory effect on Ub ligase activity of BRCA1 or BARD1 (Fig. 2 B,lanes 1–6), arguing against the possibility that the stimulatory effect observed with BRCA1-BARD1 is mediated by stabilizing the structure of each protein by its partners nonspecifically. Coupled immunoprecipitation and Western blotting verified the interactions between these proteins (lane 7). To verify the importance of the RING finger in activity and to explore the relationship between the BRCA1 tumor suppressor function and the Ub ligase activity, we made constructs containing BRCA1 with a tumor-derived mutation at Cys-61 (BRCA1C61G) (22Brzovic P.S. Meza J. King M.C. Klevit R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7795-7799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The mutation completely abolished Ub ligase activity (Fig. 2 C, lane 3) when compared with the anti-Myc immunocomplex precipitated from cells cotransfected with wild-type Myc-BRCA1-(1–772) and HA-BARD1 (lane 2) and reduced the activity of the HA-BARD1 immunocomplex to the level of the corresponding HA-BARD1 single transfection (lanes 7 versus 5). An artificial mutation in the RING finger domain, BRCA1C39A/H41A, also disrupted the activity to the same degree as BRCA1C61G (lanes 4 versus 3 and 8 versus 7). On the other hand, BARD1C83G and BARD1C66A/H68A, the RING mutations corresponding to those of BRCA1C61G and BRCA1C39A/H41A, respectively, did not abolish the Ub ligase activity, although a detectable reduction of the activity was observed (Fig. 2 D, lanes 3 and 4). To exclude the possibility that the ligase activity in the immunocomplex is caused by contaminating proteins and also to determine the core of the Ub ligase activity, both the RING finger domain of BRCA1 and of BARD1 were purified from bacteria via GST or His6 tags (Fig.3 A). Consistent with the immunocomplex-based assay, a mixture of the purified RING finger domains of BRCA1 and BARD1 exhibited significant Ub ligase activity (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3, 6, 8, and 10) whereas either the BRCA1 (lanes 1 and 5) or BARD1 (lanes 2 and 7) RING alone displayed barely detectable Ub ligase activity. Purified His6-E2F1 did not enhance the Ub ligase activity of BRCA1 (lane 9), although it did interact with GST-BRCA1-(1–342) (data not shown). RING finger domains comprising residues 1–304 of BRCA1 and residues 25–189 of BARD1 were capable of polymerizing ubiquitin (lane 8). Importantly BRCA1C61G, the breast cancer-derived RING finger mutant, did not collaborate with BARD1 to activate UbcH5c (lane 4). Taken together, these results indicate that BARD1 and BRCA1 collaboratively activate Ub ligase activity with the E2 UbcH5c. The reactants contained ubiquitinated products migrating at ∼35 and 43 kDa (Fig. 3, ♦), exactly the same position as that seen in the immunocomplex-based assay (Fig. 2). These products are likely to be free ubiquitin polymers or ubiquitin polymers covalently bound to some small molecule such as UbcH5c. The majority of the polyubiquitinated products including these smaller products did not dissociate from the BRCA1-BARD1 complex when washed with buffer B (data not shown). There is a possibility that these two molecules are ubiquitination substrates of each other for targeted degradation. We therefore analyzed the steady-state levels of these proteins by Western blotting. Polyubiquitinated substrates are rapidly degraded by the 26 S proteasome and, correspondingly, the steady-state level of such substrates tends to drop detectably. However, the steady-state level of Myc-BRCA1-(1–772) was increased after co-transfection of HA-BARD1 in a dosage-dependent manner (Fig.4 A). Reciprocally, the steady-state level of HA-BARD1 was increased when it was cotransfected with Myc-BRCA1-(1–772) (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that BRCA1 and BARD1 stabilized each other while gaining the ability to ligate the polyubiquitin chain, suggesting that they are not substrates signaled by each other for degradation. The RING finger motif was thought to be a DNA binding site when BRCA1 was first identified as a tumor suppressor gene for familial breast and ovarian cancer, because it was related to the zinc finger, a known DNA binding motif (1Zheng L. Li S. Boyer T.G. Lee W.H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6159-6175Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Moreover, the involvement of the BRCT domain in transcription suggests that BRCA1 is a transcription factor, and the RING finger takes part in DNA binding. However, despite tremendous effort, binding between the RING finger of BRCA1 and DNA has not been shown. Instead, the RING finger of BRCA1 has been shown to be important for a protein-protein interaction with another RING finger domain, which was identified and given the name BARD1 (5Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.C. Hwang L.Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). A detailed biochemical analysis revealed, however, that the interaction between BRCA1 and BARD1 was mediated by regions outside the canonical RING finger motif (6Meza J.E. Brzovic P.S. King M-C. Klevit R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5659-5665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), suggesting that the two RING fingers contained some additional function where the proximity of the two RINGs was important. In the present report, we provide evidence demonstrating that the RING heterodimer BRCA1-BARD1 functions as a Ub ligase. First, the BRCA1-BARD1 immunocomplex obtained from BRCA1- and BARD1-transfected cells contains a significant ability to promote polyubiquitinationin vitro, and omission of either one of the two from the transfection eliminates this activity. Next, the bacterially purified RING finger domains of BRCA1 and BARD1 exhibit high Ub ligase activity. Again omission of either one of the two RING fingers eliminates this activity. Most importantly, in both experiments, a breast cancer-derived RING finger mutation of BRCA1, C61G, abolishes the ability to promote polyubiquitination. Although it is possible that the major reaction being monitored in the present study is autoubiquitination, BRCA1 and BARD1 are not substrates signaled by each other for degradation, because they stabilize each other in vivo. A common feature of RING finger ubiquitin ligases is autoubiquitination (Refs. 13Honda R. Yasuda H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1473-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 14Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S.

The importance of those autoubiquitinations in the function of RING type ubiquitin ligases remains to be determined. BRCA1-BARD1 may constitute a novel type of RING containing Ub ligase that forms a heterodimeric RING finger complex. However, the stoichiometry of RING finger molecules in complexes of known RING Ub ligases has not yet been elucidated. It remains to be determined whether dimerization, either as homo- or heterodimers, between two RING fingers represents a general mechanism for activating Ub ligase activity. Supporting this possibility, Myc-ROC1 can be detected in HA-ROC1 immunocomplexes precipitated from cells transfected with Myc-ROC1 and HA-ROC1. 2T. Ohta, unpublished results. During the S phase of the cell cycle, the steady-state levels of BRCA1 reach a maximum, and BARD1 colocalizes with BRCA1 into nuclear dots (23Jin Y. Xu X.L. Yang M.C. Wei F. Ayi T.C. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12075-12080Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Consequently it is likely that an in vivo Ub ligase activity of BRCA1-BARD1 would reach a maximum in S phase. Whether the formation of the heterodimer is a regulated event possibly resulting in the stabilization of BRCA1 and in vivo Ub ligase activity remains to be determined. To further understand the biological function of the BRCA1-BARD1 Ub ligase, determining the substrates presumably targeted for degradation is critical. Nuclear proteins that are degraded or down-regulated in S phase may be candidate substrates for the BRCA1-BARD1 Ub ligase. The high Ub ligase activity of BRCA1-BARD1 presented here should make identifying those candidates easier. The fact that the two RING finger domains of BRCA1 and BARD1 are necessary for one biochemical function indicates that the oncogenic potential or the phenotypes caused by mutations in the domains of those two molecules should be the same. Indeed, germline mutations in theBARD1 gene in primary breast and ovarian cancers have been reported (24Thai T.H. Du F. Tsan J.T. Jin Y. Phung A. Spillman M.A. Massa H.F. Muller C.Y. Ashfaq R. Mathis J.M. Miller D.S. Trask B.J. Baer R. Bowcock A.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). BARD1 is potentially as important a gene as BRCA1 in tumor suppression of breast and ovarian cancers. By correlating each mutation of the two molecules and BRCA1-BARD1in vitro Ub ligase activity, it may now be possible to predict the oncogenic potential for breast and ovarian cancer in families with germline missense point mutations in the RING finger domains of BRCA1 or BARD1. As such, the finding that the BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer complex acts as a Ub ligase should provide a new insight to further clinical research into the roles of BRCA1 and BARD1 in tumor suppression.

Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 783-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar, 2Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1976; 7: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 3Wienderer L. Loffler G. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 649-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation of adipocyte genes has been the focus of much research. CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPα)1 and PPARγ have been shown to be critical in directing adipocyte-specific gene expression and adipogenesis (4Christy R.J. Yang V.W. Ntambi J.M. Geiman D.E.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 974-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In animals, the activities of critical enzymes in triacylglycerol biosynthesis and lipolysis are tightly controlled by nutritional and hormonal conditions (8Joseph D. Paulauskis J.D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 574-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, feeding causes an induction whereas fasting causes suppression of lipogenic enzymes. Elevated insulin over a high carbohydrate diet feeding is thought to induce these enzymes in lipogenesis. The role of insulin can also be demonstrated by administration of insulin to diabetic animals. These enzymes have also been shown to be expressed at a high level in the adipose tissue of animal obesity models including ob/ob and db/db mice as well as Zucker rats (9Penicaud L. Ferre P. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Perdereau D. Leturque A. Jeanrenaud B. Picon L. Girard J. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Hyperinsulinemia may be responsible for elevated levels of the enzymes. The role of adipose tissue mainly as an organ for energy storage and mobilization has recently been expanded by the discovery of leptin (10Zhang Y. Proenca R. Maffei M. Barone M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (11807) Google Scholar,11Halaas J.L. Gajiwala K.S. Maffei M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Rabinowitz D. Lallone R.L. Burley S.K. Friedman J.M. Science. 1995; 269: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar). Leptin is primarily made and secreted by mature adipocytes. It binds to its receptor in the hypothalamus and may function in regulating body fat mass (12Maffei M. Fei H. Lee G.H. Dani C. Leroy P. Zhang Y. Proenca R. Negrel R. Ailhaud G. Friedman J.M. Proc.

Other immune system-related proteins such as TNF-α, adipsin, and ACRP30/AdipoQ along with vascular function-related molecules such as angiotensinogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor type I have been shown to be secreted by adipose tissue (14Scherer P.E.

Fukuda K. Takemura K. Tokunaga K. Matsuzawa Y. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). In addition, adipocytes also secrete factors such as Pref-1, which inhibits adipocyte differentiation (17Smas C.M. Chen L. Sul H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 977-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 18Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 725-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 19Smas C.M. Kachinskas D.

Although the precise functions of these molecules are not clear, adipose tissue as a secretory organ to regulate other physiological processes as well as energy balance and homeostasis is now well established. Adipose tissue must secrete factors reflecting the nutritional status and regulating adipose tissue mass. We report here the identification and function of a serine/cysteine-rich adipocyte-specificsecretory factor (ADSF) that does not belong to known classes of cysteine-rich proteins. Its mRNA is expressed only in adipose tissue. The mRNA is induced markedly during differentiation of 3T3-L1 and primary preadipocytes. In fasted or diabetic animals, its expression is very low or non-detectable in adipose tissue but increases markedly upon feeding or insulin administration. Furthermore, when treated with the conditioned medium from COS cells transfected with the expression vector, adipose conversion of 3T3-L1 cells was inhibited, indicating its potential role as a feedback regulator of adipogenesis. During the submission of this manuscript, the Lazar laboratory (20Steppan C.M. Balley S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S. Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4004) Google Scholar) reported this protein as a TZD down-regulated factor contributing to insulin resistance. Adipose tissue-specific genes were examined by microarray analysis using rat Genefilter membranes (Research Genetics). Filters were hybridized with α-33P-labeled cDNAs synthesized with 5 μg of total RNA. Spots exclusively hybridized with cDNA probes prepared from adipose tissue RNA were used for sequence analysis. Mice were fasted for 48 h, or fasted mice were refed a 58% carbohydrate fat-free diet (21Moon Y.S. Latasa M.J. Kim K.-H. Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10121-10127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Induction of diabetes and insulin treatments were carried out as described previously (21Moon Y.S. Latasa M.J. Kim K.-H. Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10121-10127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged full-length mouse ADSF/resistin fragment was prepared by PCR amplification. The 5′ primer, 5′-TGGGACAGGAGCTAATACCCAGA-3′ and 3′ primer, 5′-GTCAAGCATAATCTGGAACATCATATGGATAGGAAGCGACCTGCAGCTT-3′ were used. The resultant PCR product was originally ligated into pCR3.1 (Invitrogen), and a BamHI-XhoI fragment was then subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The sequence of the resultant plasmid was confirmed by restriction mapping and sequencing. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS. For adipocyte differentiation, confluent cells were treated with 1 μm Dex and 0.5 mm MIX as described previously (22Rubin C.S. Hirsch A. Fung C. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7570-7578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments in which conditioned medium was used, cells were cultured in medium composed of 75% conditioned medium and 25% DMEM, 10% FBS plus Dex and MIX. The adipose-derived stromal vascular fractions from rats were prepared as has been described previously (23Gregoire F.M. Johnson P.R. Greenwood M.R. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 1995; 19: 664-670PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the subcutaneous inguinal fat deposits from female Zuker rats were dissected and the lymph nodes were removed. The stromal vascular cells were obtained by collagenase (Sigma, 540 units/mg) digestion at 1 mg/ml at 37 °C for 45 min in Hepes-phosphate buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 135 mm NaCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1.25 mm MgSO4, 0.45 mmKH2PO4, 2.17 mmNa2HPO4, 5 mmd-glucose, and 2% w/v bovine serum albumin). The cell suspension was filtered through a 100-μm nylon filter and centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min. The pellets were washed, filtered through a 25-μm nylon filter, and plated at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/cm2 in DMEM, 10% FBS. At confluence, differentiation was initiated by the addition of 0.1 μm Dex, 0.25 mm MIX, and 17 nminsulin. After 2 days, the medium was replaced by DMEM, 10% FBS plus insulin only. The pcDNA3.1 expression vector was transiently transfected into COS cells using DEAE-dextran in DMEM with 10% serum plus (JRH Biosciences) as described previously (24Gulick T. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 9201-9210Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the medium was changed to DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The conditioned medium was collected 72 h after transfection, centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, and stored at 4 °C for less than a week before use. The total RNA from the rat tissues was prepared by guanidine isothiocyanate/cesium chloride centrifugation. The total RNA from the cells was prepared using TriZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA was electrophoresed in 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel in 2.2 m formaldehyde, 20 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA, and transferred to Hybond N (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After UV cross-linking, the membranes were hybridized with the α-32P-labeled cDNA probes in ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH). The membranes were exposed to x-ray film with an intensifying screen, and the signals were scanned using the Molecular Analyst (Bio-Rad). Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 30 min on ice. The protein content was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Thirty μg of protein were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electroblotted onto Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and immunodetected using mouse anti-HA antiserum (Covance) and goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) by using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Bio-Rad). RNA was reverse transcribed at 37 °C for 60 min, and the products were used as the template for two PCR reactions in one tube containing target genes with actin as an internal control. The primers used were PPARγ (PCR product of 375 bp in length), 5′-ATGCCATTCTGGCCCACCAAC-3′ and 5′-CCTTGCATCCTTCCAAAGCAT-3′; aFABP (PCR product of 310 bp in length) 5′-CTTGTCTCCAGTGAAAACTT-3′ and 5′-ACCTTCTCGTTTTCTTTAT-3′; FAS (PCR product of 120 bp in length), 5′-AGGGGTCGACCTGGTCCTCA-3′ and 5′-GGGTGGTTGTTAGAAAGAT-3′; and actin (PCR product of 282 bp in length), 5′-TCCTATGTGGGTGACGAGGC-3′ and 5′-CATGGCTGGGGTGTTGAAGG-3′. To identify novel genes that are only expressed in adipocytes and are induced during adipocyte differentiation, we compared expression levels of rat expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences by cDNA microarray. RNA samples were prepared from white adipose tissue as well as brown adipose tissue, liver, muscle, and brain. The RNAs were used to synthesize cDNAs for hybridization, and those sequences that were expressed only in white and brown adipose tissues were identified. Candidate EST clones were sequenced, and one such sequence was identified as that coding for a novel adipose tissue-specific, serine- and cysteine-rich secreted protein. This gene was originally named as FIZZ3, which belongs to a gene family whose founding member, FIZZ1, is implicated as a possible mediator of neuronal function and airway hyperactivity (25Holcomb I.N. Kabakoff R.C. Chan B. Baker T.W. Gurney A. Henzel W. Nelson C. Lowman H.B. Wright B.D. Skelton N.J. Frantz G.D. Tumas D.B Peale F.V. Shelton D.L. Hebert C.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4046-4055Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). While this manuscript was being reviewed, the protein was also identified as a TZD down-regulated adipocyte protein, resistin, which may contribute to insulin resistance (20Steppan C.M. Balley S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S. Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4004) Google Scholar). From now on, we refer to the novel serine/cysteine-rich adipocyte-specific secretory factor as ADSF/resistin. The cDNA sequence of rat ADSF/resistin is shown in Fig.1 A. It reveals a 1174-bp cDNA with two potential polyadenylation signal sequences, the proximal one at 524 nt and the distal one at 1149 nt. Northern blot analysis revealed two mRNAs with sizes of 1.4 and 0.8 kb found in rat adipose tissue with the differences in size attributed to the 3′-untranslated region. In murine fat tissues, on the other hand, we detected only one mRNA, which corresponds to the shorter rat mRNA. When we sequenced murine cDNA, we found that unlike the rat cDNA, the mouse homolog was shorter in the 3′-untranslated region with only one polyadenylation signal sequence corresponding to the rat promixal sequence. The mRNA species detected in Northern blot analysis and sequence analysis indicate that the difference in the size of rat and murine mRNAs is in the 3′-untranslated region. Interestingly, mouse cDNA sequence contains a consensus polyadenlylation signal AATAAA. In contrast, rat cDNA sequence reveals the proximal polyadenylation signal AATACA, with a single base mismatch, which probably is a weak signal and therefore causes the generation of the longer mRNA using the distal polyadenylation signal of AATAAA. Overall between rat and murine sequences there is 68% homology in nucleotide sequence (85 and 43% in coding and noncoding regions, respectively). The open reading frame encodes a 114 amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 12.5 kDa and 75% homology between the rat and murine sequence (Fig. 1 B). One hydrophobic stretch is predicted by a Kyte-Doolittle plot located within the first 20 amino-terminal residues and is characteristic of a signal sequence. To test whether this protein is secreted, we constructed a HA epitope-tagged expression vector and transiently transfected it into COS cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the COS cells synthesized a protein with a molecular weight corresponding to the in vitro synthesized protein, and the secreted protein was detected in the conditioned medium (Fig.1 C). The most striking structural feature is the presence of multiple serines and cysteines, each comprising ∼10% of the amino acid residues with a coiled-coil structure. Although there are several classes of cysteine-rich protein motifs, the spacing of the cysteines, CX12CX8CXCX3CX10CXCXCX9CC, does not match the known classes of cysteine-rich proteins. However, the cyteine-rich motif predicts possible protein-protein interaction. We examined the tissue distribution of the mRNA by Northern blot analysis using various tissues from both mice and rats (Fig.2 A). As indicated above, two mRNA species of 1.4 and 0.8 kb were present only in rat adipose tissue but not in any other tissues examined including brain, heart, small intestine, kidney, liver, lung, and skeletal muscle. A single 0.8-kb mRNA was detected only in murine adipose tissue (data not shown). We also detected the two mRNAs at similar levels in all regions of rat white adipose tissues including epididymal and inguinal fat pads. Interestingly, these mRNAs were also found in brown adipose tissue although in lesser amounts than in white adipose tissue. We next fractionated adipose tissue into stromal vascular fractions, which mainly contain preadipocytes and adipocyte fractions. We found that unlike in adipocyte fractions, these mRNAs were not detectable in stromal vascular fractions suggesting that ADSF/resistin expression may be induced during adipogenesis. To determine whether ADSF/resistin expression is regulated during adipocyte differentiation, mRNA levels were examined in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes during differentiation into adipocytes (Fig. 2 B). The ADSF/resistin mRNA was not detectable in the preadipocyte stage (Day 0). But levels of the 0.8-kb murine mRNA, as predicted by the murine origin of 3T3-L1 cells, were markedly increased during differentiation into adipocytes. As anticipated, expression of aFABP (aP2) was induced during adipose conversion, whereas actin expression was decreased by ∼50%. We also carried out in vitro differentiation of stromal vascular cells isolated from rat adipose tissue. Differentiation of adipose precursor cells isolated from the epididymal fat pads may better mimicin vivo processes of adipogenesis. Two species (1.4 and 0.8 kb) of rat mRNAs were undetectable in freshly plated preadipocytes of stromal vascular fractions, but their expression was increased dramatically during adipose conversion initiated by Dex and MIX treatment. The increase in mRNA levels during adipogenesis of both 3T3-L1 and primary preadipocytes was similar to or somewhat later than that of other late adipocyte markers, such as adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein and stearyl CoA reductase. The results of 3T3-L1 and primary preadipocytes in culture along with its tissue distribution clearly show that the mRNA levels increase during late stages of adipose tissue development, and therefore ADSF/resistin is expressed only in adipose tissue in mature rodents. To understand the mode of regulation of ADSF/resistin expression in adipose tissue, we examined mRNA levels following dietary and hormonal treatments. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the mRNA levels were quite low when mice were fasted. Upon refeeding a high carbohydrate fat-free diet, the mRNA levels increased 25-fold after 16 h. Likewise, FAS mRNA levels increased by 34-fold with the same dietary treatment that favors lipogenesis. Nutritional manipulation of fasting/refeeding causes an increased circulation of insulin. We tested whether the observed increase in mRNA levels during fasting/refeeding is caused by an increase in insulin secretion. We utilized streptozotocin-diabetic mice. The mRNA levels were low in the adipose tissue of diabetic mice (Fig. 3 B). Upon insulin administration, the mRNA level was increased 23-fold after 30 min. As predicted, FAS mRNA levels increased 15-fold after 30 min. Actin mRNA levels did not change appreciably by fasting/refeeding or by diabetes/insulin administration. These results indicate that ADSF/resistin is regulated in a fashion similar to the lipogenic enzyme, fatty acid synthase. However, unlike the lipogenic enzymes, which are induced both in liver and adipose tissue during feeding and by insulin, ADSF/resistin is expressed only in adipose tissue and induced by nutrition and insulin. Given that it is expressed only in adipose tissue and highly induced when the animals are in a fed state, we predicted that ADSF/resistin might promote adipoconversion of preadipocytes. Our hypothesis is that this protein may be a signal to generate adipocytes for the increased capacity to store excess energy. We collected medium from COS cells transfected with expression vector containing HA-tagged full-length mouse cDNA. The conditioned medium was added to differentiating 3T3-L1 cells to test their effect on adipogenesis. 3T3-L1 cells maintained in conditioned medium collected from COS cells transiently transfected with control vector differentiated into lipid-laden adipocytes as shown in oil red O staining (Fig.4 A). Unexpectedly, those cells maintained in medium from COS cells transfected with HA-tagged expression vector did not undergo extensive adipose conversion as judged by lipid staining. Similarly, expression of adipocyte markers, PPARγ, aFABP, and fatty acid synthase was decreased by 80% when cells were treated with conditioned medium from COS cells transfected with HA-tagged expression vector (Fig. 4 B). The actin mRNA level of these cells was somewhat higher, as expected. These results clearly demonstrate an inhibitory effect of ADSF/resistin on adipose conversion. Mature adipocytes, the main cellular components of adipose tissue, are uniquely equipped to function in energy storage and balance under tight hormonal control. However, with the recent realization that adipocytes secrete factors known to play a role in appetite control, immune response, and vascular disease, a much more complex and dynamic role for adipose tissue has emerged. The best known example is leptin, a hormone that is primarily made and secreted by mature adipocytes to regulate adipose fat mass. However, several adipocyte-specific factors with unknown functions including adipsin, acylation stimulation protein, and Acrp30/AdipoQ are secreted along with other well understood factors such as TNF-α, angiotensinogen, and plasminogen activator inhibitor type-I. Most of these factors appear to be related to immune or vascular functions. These examples clearly establish that the adipocytes behave as endocrine as well as paracrine/autocrine cells. The exact role of the ADSF/resistin secreted from adipose tissue is not yet known. It is composed of cysteine-rich domain with unique cysteine spacing and may potentially participate in protein-protein interaction. It is exclusively made in adipose tissue and is secreted to the medium. Its exclusive expression in adipocytes, its large increase during the late stage of adipogenesis, and its dramatic induction during fasting/refeeding and by insulin administration to streptozotocin-diabetic animals suggest that this factor may be involved in sensing the nutritional status of the animals to affect adipogenesis. Some of these properties are most similar to those observed with leptin, which is secreted only by adipocytes and is induced dramatically by fasting/refeeding and by diabetes/insulin. We speculate that this factor may be a molecule that serves as a feedback signal to restrict adipose tissue formation. It is also possible that it functions in an opposite manner to known differentiation agents such as Dex, MIX, and insulin during adipocyte differentiation The recent report of ADSF/resistin as a TZD down-regulated adipose tissue factor, which may antagonize insulin action by linking obesity to diabetes, is also intriguing and needs further study."

The major components of green and black tea include epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)1, epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), epicatechin (EC), and their epimers (see Fig. 1 A).

There are three major proteasomal activities: chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidyl-glutamyl peptide hydrolyzing (PGPH) activities (16Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M.

The ubiquitin-proteasome system plays a critical role in the specific degradation of cellular proteins (22Hochstrasser M. Curr. Opin.

Among the tea polyphenols examined, EGCG showed the strongest inhibitory activity against purified 20S proteasome, 26S proteasome of tumor cell extracts, and 26S proteasome in intact tumor cells.

Finally, normal human WI-38 fibroblasts were more resistant to the EGCG treatment than their SV40-transformed counterpart. Previous epidemiological studies have suggested that tea consumption may have a protective effect against human cancer (1Fujiki H. J. Cancer Res. Clin.

The major components of green and black tea include epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)1, epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), epicatechin (EC), and their epimers (see Fig. 1 A). EGCG among those polyphenols has been most extensively examined because of its relative abundance and strong cancer-preventive properties (1Fujiki H. J. Cancer Res. Clin.

EGCG has been shown to inhibit several cancer-related proteins, including urokinase (12Jankun J. Selman S.H. Swiercz R. Skrzypczak-Jankun E.

However, nonphysiological concentrations of EGCG (i.e., concentrations higher than those found in human serum after tea consumption) were used in some earlier studies. Whether one or more of these proteins are the real molecular targets of EGCG and other tea polyphenols under physiological conditions needs further investigations. The 20S proteasome, a multicatalytic complex (700 kDa), constitutes the catalytic key component of the ubiquitous proteolytic machinery 26S proteasome (16Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D.

Four endogenous tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) regulate the activities of functional matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), enzymes that degrade most components of connective tissue, but no endogenous factors responsible for the regulation of aggrecanases have been found.

To date, four isoforms of TIMP have been identified in humans that are designated TIMP-1, -2, -3, and -4 (2Brew K. Dinakarpandian D. Nagase H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar); these are homologous in sequence and have similar secondary and tertiary structures including six well conserved disulfide bonds.

Inhibition studies with recombinant TIMPs have shown that each TIMP binds to MMPs with varying degrees of affinity, implicating that they have distinct functions in vivo (2Brew K. Dinakarpandian D.

Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2000: 130-135Google Scholar).TIMP-3 was originally discovered as a transformation-induced protein in chicken fibroblasts (8Blenis J. Hawkes S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which was later shown to have inhibitory activity against MMPs (9Pavloff N. Staskus P.W. Kishnani N.S. Hawkes S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17321-17326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its function as an inhibitor of MMPs, TIMP-3 has been reported to inhibit the shedding of cell surface-anchored molecules such as tumor necrosis factor-α receptor (10Smith M.R. Kung H. Durum S.K. Colburn N.H. Sun Y. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 770-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), L-selectin (11Borland G. Murphy G. Ager A. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The release of these molecules is thought to be catalyzed by membrane-bound ADAMs (a disintegrinand a metalloproteinase domain), multidomain proteins containing an N-terminal propeptide, a metalloproteinase, a disintegrin-like, a transmembrane, and a cytoplasmic domain. The primary structures of the metalloproteinase domains of the MMPs and the ADAMs have little sequence similarity except near the catalytic Zn2+-binding motif, HEXXHXXGXXH (14Stone A.L. Kroeger M. Sang Q.X. J. Protein. Chem. 1999; 18: 447-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Direct evidence for the apparently unique ability of TIMP-3 to inhibit a broad spectrum of metalloproteinases is provided by the demonstration of its inhibitory action against TACE or ADAM-17 (15Amour A. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Butler M. Knight C.G. Smith B.J. Stephens P.E. Shelley C. Hutton M. Knäuper V. Docherty A.J. Murphy G.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). These properties suggest that TIMP-3 has an important and distinct role in regulating ADAM activities in biological systems.Recently a subgroup of eight ADAMs have recently been identified, designated ADAM-TS proteinases. The ADAM-TS group, unlike typical membrane-anchored ADAMs, lacks a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain at the C terminus. Instead, these metalloproteinases contain a varying number of thrombospondin type-1 domains (17Hurskainen T.L. Hirohata S. Seldin M.F. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25555-25563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Among them, ADAM-TS4 and ADAM-TS5, purified from interleukin-1-treated bovine articular cartilage, cleave cartilage aggrecan efficiently and thus are referred to as aggrecanase 1 and aggrecanase 2 (18Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C.

Arthritis Rheum. 1993; 36: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Until this study, however, no endogenous inhibitor of the aggrecanases has been identified. Here we show that the N-terminal domain of TIMP-3 (N-TIMP-3), expressed at high yield in Escherichia coli and folded from inclusion bodies to give a functional metalloproteinase inhibitor, is a highly potent inhibitor of both aggrecanases. This truncated protein, or variants engineered to enhance the specificity for aggrecanases, may represent a route for the treatment of arthritis.DISCUSSIONTIMPs expressed in connective tissues play important roles in the control of extracellular matrix metabolism, and the ability of TIMPs to inhibit the activities of MMPs in vitro has been well documented (2Brew K. Dinakarpandian D. Nagase H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). TIMP-3, however, has several properties distinct from those of other TIMPs, which include its ability to bind tightly to the extracellular matrix (9Pavloff N. Staskus P.W. Kishnani N.S. Hawkes S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17321-17326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Yu W.H., Yu, S. Meng Q. Brew K. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol.

Hutton M. Knäuper V. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) and ADAM 10 (16). This work provides additional important information, specifically that TIMP-3 is a potent endogenous inhibitor of aggrecanases, metalloproteinases that play a key role in the degradation of articular cartilage aggrecan. Inhibition of aggrecanases was not observed with TIMP-1 or TIMP-2. TIMP-4 is however a weak inhibitor of ADAM-TS4 but not ADAM-TS5.The property of TIMP-3 binding to matrix components is considered to be important in the localized regulation of MMP activity, and its interaction with the polyanionic extracellular matrix is mainly due to the N-terminal domain of TIMP-3 (31Yu W.H., Yu, S. Meng Q. Brew K. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31226-31232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The inhibitor may be extracted from the tissue with sulfated compounds such as suramin and pentosan or enzymatic treatment with heparinase III or chondroitinase ABC (31Yu W.H., Yu, S. Meng Q. Brew K. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31226-31232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), but its strong binding to the extracellular matrix has made it difficult to purify sufficient quantities of TIMP-3 for detailed characterization from tissues or even by expression of the recombinant protein in mammalian cells (33Apte S.S. Olsen B.R. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14313-14318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In this study we have established a high yield bacterial expression and in vitro folding procedure for the N-terminal inhibitory domain of TIMP-3, which allows us to obtain about 5 mg of fully active TIMP-3 from a 3-liter bacterial culture.Inhibition kinetic studies with N-TIMP-3 indicate that TIMP-3 is a relatively weak inhibitor of MMP-3 (stromelysin 1), whereas TIMP-3 inhibits MMP-1 (collagenase 1) and MMP-2 (gelatinase A) to a similar extent as TIMP-1. The most significant unique property of TIMP-3 that we have demonstrated here is that it is a potent endogenous inhibitor of aggrecanases 1 and 2 (ADAM-TS4 and ADAM-TS5). TheKi(app) values determined in the presence of 0.5m aggrecan substrate were 3.30 nm for ADAM-TS4 and 0.66 nm for ADAM-TS5. TheKm of ADAM-TS4 and ADAM-TS5 for the cleavage of the Glu1480–Gly1481 bond is less than 0.1m. 3M. Tortorella and H. Nagase, unpublished work. Because the true Ki value is equal toKi(app) /(1 + [S]/Km), theKi values of TIMP-3 for ADAM-TS4 and ADAM-TS5 will be at least 6-fold lower than the Ki(app)values. These data suggest that a primary physiological function for TIMP-3 may be the inhibition of aggrecanases because its affinity toward ADAM-TS4 and ADAM-TS5 is much stronger than those for the three MMPs tested.Aggrecanases are believed to play a crucial role both in the normal turnover of aggrecan in cartilage and in diseases such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (20Lark M.W.

On the other hand, TIMP-3 mRNA is expressed in cartilage and skeletal tissue during development of mouse embryo (34Apte S.S. Hayashi K. Seldin M.F. Mattei M.G. Hayashi M. Olsen B.R. Dev. Dyn. 1994; 200: 177-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), suggesting that this inhibitor may play a role during skeletal tissue development. TIMP-3 is also expressed in normal bovine and human articular chondrocytes and in synoviocytes, and elevated TIMP-3 expression was found in human osteoarthritic synoviocytes (35Su S. Grover J. Roughley P.J. DiBattista J.A. Martel-Pelletier J. Pelletier J.P. Zafarullah M. Rheumatol. Int. 1999; 18: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The expression of TIMP-3 in chondrocytes in culture is up-regulated by transforming growth factor-β (36Su S. DiBattista J.A. Sun Y. Li W.Q. Zafarullah M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 70: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), oncostatin M (37Li W.Q. Zafarullah M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5000-5007PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies of Takizawa et al. (38Takizawa M. Ohuchi E. Yamanaka H. Nakamura H. Ikeda E. Ghosh P. Okada Y. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 812-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) showed that the treatment of human rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts with an antiarthritic agent, calcium pentosan polysulfate, increases the synthesis of TIMP-3 protein without altering its mRNA levels, and this effect is further enhanced in cells treated with both calcium pentosan polysulfate and interleukin 1. The levels of other TIMPs and MMPs were not affected by this treatment. Because the degradation of aggrecan in cartilage occurs in the early stages of arthritis, the level of TIMP-3 in cartilage is likely to be an important factor in relation to the development of arthritis. Elevated TIMP-3 production therefore may be beneficial for protecting cartilage from degradation, because it can prevent not only the action of aggrecanases and MMPs in the cartilage but also the release of TNF-α, one of the key inflammatory cytokines, from the synovial living cells by inhibiting TACE.Whereas the general mechanism of inhibition of MMPs by TIMPs has been well characterized by crystallographic studies (6Gomis-Rüth F.X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), it is not known which structural features confer on TIMP-3 its unique ability to inhibit metalloproteinases from families other than the MMPs. Both aggrecanases have little sequence similarity with MMPs, although the overall polypeptide folds may be predicted to be similar. The primary structures of the proteinase domains of ADAM-TS4 and ADAM-TS5 are about 48% identical to each other. They are members of the reprolysin family, but their sequence identities with adamalysins are only 20–25% and with TACE and ADAM 10, only 10–15%. Thus, it is not apparent how TIMP-3, but not TIMP-1, -2, or -4, can inhibit those additional groups of metalloproteinases that are only distantly related to MMPs. We are currently investigating key structural elements in TIMP-3, by mutagenesis and molecular modeling, that confer its ability to inhibit aggrecanases and other members of the ADAM family of metalloproteinases. The identification of such elements may provide us with strategies to engineer TIMPs that are more soluble than TIMP-3 and specifically inhibit aggrecanases.

To date, four isoforms of TIMP have been identified in humans that are designated TIMP-1, -2, -3, and -4 (2Brew K. Dinakarpandian D. Nagase H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar); these are homologous in sequence and have similar secondary and tertiary structures including six well conserved disulfide bonds.

Inhibition studies with recombinant TIMPs have shown that each TIMP binds to MMPs with varying degrees of affinity, implicating that they have distinct functions in vivo (2Brew K. Dinakarpandian D.

Hawkes S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which was later shown to have inhibitory activity against MMPs (9Pavloff N. Staskus P.W. Kishnani N.S. Hawkes S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17321-17326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its function as an inhibitor of MMPs, TIMP-3 has been reported to inhibit the shedding of cell surface-anchored molecules such as tumor necrosis factor-α receptor (10Smith M.R. Kung H. Durum S.K. Colburn N.H. Sun Y. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 770-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), L-selectin (11Borland G. Murphy G. Ager A. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The release of these molecules is thought to be catalyzed by membrane-bound ADAMs (a disintegrinand a metalloproteinase domain), multidomain proteins containing an N-terminal propeptide, a metalloproteinase, a disintegrin-like, a transmembrane, and a cytoplasmic domain. The primary structures of the metalloproteinase domains of the MMPs and the ADAMs have little sequence similarity except near the catalytic Zn2+-binding motif, HEXXHXXGXXH (14Stone A.L. Kroeger M. Sang Q.X. J. Protein. Chem. 1999; 18: 447-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Direct evidence for the apparently unique ability of TIMP-3 to inhibit a broad spectrum of metalloproteinases is provided by the demonstration of its inhibitory action against TACE or ADAM-17 (15Amour A. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Butler M. Knight C.G. Smith B.J. Stephens P.E. Shelley C. Hutton M. Knäuper V. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) and ADAM-10 (16Amour A. Knight C.G. Webster A. Slocombe P.M. Stephens P.E. Knäuper V. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). These properties suggest that TIMP-3 has an important and distinct role in regulating ADAM activities in biological systems. Recently a subgroup of eight ADAMs have recently been identified, designated ADAM-TS proteinases. The ADAM-TS group, unlike typical membrane-anchored ADAMs, lacks a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain at the C terminus. Instead, these metalloproteinases contain a varying number of thrombospondin type-1 domains (17Hurskainen T.L. Hirohata S. Seldin M.F. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25555-25563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Among them, ADAM-TS4 and ADAM-TS5, purified from interleukin-1-treated bovine articular cartilage, cleave cartilage aggrecan efficiently and thus are referred to as aggrecanase 1 and aggrecanase 2 (18Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C.

Arthritis Rheum. 1993; 36: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Until this study, however, no endogenous inhibitor of the aggrecanases has been identified. Here we show that the N-terminal domain of TIMP-3 (N-TIMP-3), expressed at high yield in Escherichia coli and folded from inclusion bodies to give a functional metalloproteinase inhibitor, is a highly potent inhibitor of both aggrecanases. This truncated protein, or variants engineered to enhance the specificity for aggrecanases, may represent a route for the treatment of arthritis. DISCUSSIONTIMPs expressed in connective tissues play important roles in the control of extracellular matrix metabolism, and the ability of TIMPs to inhibit the activities of MMPs in vitro has been well documented (2Brew K. Dinakarpandian D. Nagase H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). TIMP-3, however, has several properties distinct from those of other TIMPs, which include its ability to bind tightly to the extracellular matrix (9Pavloff N. Staskus P.W. Kishnani N.S. Hawkes S.P.

Hutton M. Knäuper V. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) and ADAM 10 (16). This work provides additional important information, specifically that TIMP-3 is a potent endogenous inhibitor of aggrecanases, metalloproteinases that play a key role in the degradation of articular cartilage aggrecan. Inhibition of aggrecanases was not observed with TIMP-1 or TIMP-2. TIMP-4 is however a weak inhibitor of ADAM-TS4 but not ADAM-TS5.The property of TIMP-3 binding to matrix components is considered to be important in the localized regulation of MMP activity, and its interaction with the polyanionic extracellular matrix is mainly due to the N-terminal domain of TIMP-3 (31Yu W.H., Yu, S. Meng Q. Brew K. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31226-31232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The inhibitor may be extracted from the tissue with sulfated compounds such as suramin and pentosan or enzymatic treatment with heparinase III or chondroitinase ABC (31Yu W.H., Yu, S. Meng Q. Brew K. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31226-31232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), but its strong binding to the extracellular matrix has made it difficult to purify sufficient quantities of TIMP-3 for detailed characterization from tissues or even by expression of the recombinant protein in mammalian cells (33Apte S.S. Olsen B.R. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14313-14318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In this study we have established a high yield bacterial expression and in vitro folding procedure for the N-terminal inhibitory domain of TIMP-3, which allows us to obtain about 5 mg of fully active TIMP-3 from a 3-liter bacterial culture.Inhibition kinetic studies with N-TIMP-3 indicate that TIMP-3 is a relatively weak inhibitor of MMP-3 (stromelysin 1), whereas TIMP-3 inhibits MMP-1 (collagenase 1) and MMP-2 (gelatinase A) to a similar extent as TIMP-1. The most significant unique property of TIMP-3 that we have demonstrated here is that it is a potent endogenous inhibitor of aggrecanases 1 and 2 (ADAM-TS4 and ADAM-TS5).

Because the true Ki value is equal toKi(app) /(1 + [S]/Km), theKi values of TIMP-3 for ADAM-TS4 and ADAM-TS5 will be at least 6-fold lower than the Ki(app)values. These data suggest that a primary physiological function for TIMP-3 may be the inhibition of aggrecanases because its affinity toward ADAM-TS4 and ADAM-TS5 is much stronger than those for the three MMPs tested. Aggrecanases are believed to play a crucial role both in the normal turnover of aggrecan in cartilage and in diseases such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (20Lark M.W. Bayne E.K. Flanagan J. Harper C.F. Hoerrner L.A. Hutchinson N.I. Singer I.I. Donatelli S.A. Weidner J.R. Williams H.R. Mumford R.A. Lohmander L.S. J. Clin.

On the other hand, TIMP-3 mRNA is expressed in cartilage and skeletal tissue during development of mouse embryo (34Apte S.S. Hayashi K. Seldin M.F. Mattei M.G. Hayashi M. Olsen B.R. Dev. Dyn. 1994; 200: 177-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), suggesting that this inhibitor may play a role during skeletal tissue development. TIMP-3 is also expressed in normal bovine and human articular chondrocytes and in synoviocytes, and elevated TIMP-3 expression was found in human osteoarthritic synoviocytes (35Su S. Grover J. Roughley P.J. DiBattista J.A. Martel-Pelletier J. Pelletier J.P. Zafarullah M. Rheumatol. Int. 1999; 18: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The expression of TIMP-3 in chondrocytes in culture is up-regulated by transforming growth factor-β (36Su S. DiBattista J.A. Sun Y. Li W.Q. Zafarullah M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 70: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), oncostatin M (37Li W.Q. Zafarullah M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5000-5007PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies of Takizawa et al. (38Takizawa M. Ohuchi E. Yamanaka H. Nakamura H. Ikeda E. Ghosh P. Okada Y. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 812-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) showed that the treatment of human rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts with an antiarthritic agent, calcium pentosan polysulfate, increases the synthesis of TIMP-3 protein without altering its mRNA levels, and this effect is further enhanced in cells treated with both calcium pentosan polysulfate and interleukin 1. The levels of other TIMPs and MMPs were not affected by this treatment. Because the degradation of aggrecan in cartilage occurs in the early stages of arthritis, the level of TIMP-3 in cartilage is likely to be an important factor in relation to the development of arthritis. Elevated TIMP-3 production therefore may be beneficial for protecting cartilage from degradation, because it can prevent not only the action of aggrecanases and MMPs in the cartilage but also the release of TNF-α, one of the key inflammatory cytokines, from the synovial living cells by inhibiting TACE. Whereas the general mechanism of inhibition of MMPs by TIMPs has been well characterized by crystallographic studies (6Gomis-Rüth F.X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), it is not known which structural features confer on TIMP-3 its unique ability to inhibit metalloproteinases from families other than the MMPs. Both aggrecanases have little sequence similarity with MMPs, although the overall polypeptide folds may be predicted to be similar. The primary structures of the proteinase domains of ADAM-TS4 and ADAM-TS5 are about 48% identical to each other. They are members of the reprolysin family, but their sequence identities with adamalysins are only 20–25% and with TACE and ADAM 10, only 10–15%. Thus, it is not apparent how TIMP-3, but not TIMP-1, -2, or -4, can inhibit those additional groups of metalloproteinases that are only distantly related to MMPs. We are currently investigating key structural elements in TIMP-3, by mutagenesis and molecular modeling, that confer its ability to inhibit aggrecanases and other members of the ADAM family of metalloproteinases. The identification of such elements may provide us with strategies to engineer TIMPs that are more soluble than TIMP-3 and specifically inhibit aggrecanases. We thank Dr. Clare E. Hughes for the generous gift of BC-3 antibody."
https://openalex.org/W2124606330,"Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase that can activate the c-Jun N-terminal kinase and the p38 signaling pathways. It plays a critical role in cytokine- and stress-induced apoptosis. To further characterize the mechanism of the regulation of the ASK1 signal, we searched for ASK1-interacting proteins employing the yeast two-hybrid method. The yeast two-hybrid assay indicated that mouse glutathioneS-transferase Mu 1-1 (mGSTM1-1), an enzyme involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics, interacted with ASK1. We subsequently confirmed that mGSTM1-1 physically associated with ASK1 both in vivo and in vitro. The in vitro binding assay indicated that the C-terminal portion of mGSTM1-1 and the N-terminal region of ASK1 were crucial for binding one another. Furthermore, mGSTM1-1 suppressed stress-stimulated ASK1 activity in cultured cells. mGSTM1-1 also blocked ASK1 oligomerization. The ASK1 inhibition by mGSTM1-1 occurred independently of the glutathione-conjugating activity of mGSTM1-1. Moreover, mGSTM1-1 repressed ASK1-dependent apoptotic cell death. Taken together, our findings suggest that mGSTM1-1 functions as an endogenous inhibitor of ASK1. This highlights a novel function for mGSTM1-1 insofar as mGSTM1-1 may modulate stress-mediated signals by repressing ASK1, and this activity occurs independently of its well-known catalytic activity in intracellular glutathione metabolism.

Apoptosis is an active cellular process that occurs not only during embryogenesis and metamorphosis but also during post-embryonal life, thus controlling normal development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms (1Cohen J.J. Immunol. Today.. 1993; 14: 126-130Google Scholar, 2Raff M.C. Nature.. 1992; 356: 397-400Google Scholar, 3Wyllie A.H. Nature.. 1980; 284: 555-556Google Scholar). Apoptosis is characterized by morphological changes that include chromatin condensation, membrane blebbing, and packaging of nuclear fragments into small apoptotic bodies, which are eliminated through phagocytosis by neighboring cells without eliciting inflammatory reactions (3Wyllie A.H. Nature.. 1980; 284: 555-556Google Scholar, 4Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer.. 1972; 26: 239-257Google Scholar). Derangement of cells from the tightly regulated apoptotic process is associated with the occurrence of many human diseases such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and various neurodegenerative disorders (5Thompson C.B. Science.. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Google Scholar). Apoptotic cell death is thought to occur through an orchestrated sequence of intracellular signaling cascades. In particular, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 signaling pathways have been shown to be involved in the mechanism for regulation of cell death and survival (6Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1997; 1333: F85-F104Google Scholar, 7Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol... 1998; 10: 205-219Google Scholar). The MAPK signaling pathways include three distinct components of the protein kinase family; MAPKs, MAPK kinases (MAPKKs), and MAPK kinase kinases (MAPKKKs). When activated, MAPKKKs phosphorylate and activate MAPKKs, which in turn phosphorylate and activate MAPKs. The mammalian MAPKs include three subfamilies: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) and p38 MAPK (6Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1997; 1333: F85-F104Google Scholar, 7Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol... 1998; 10: 205-219Google Scholar). The ERK signaling pathway is often stimulated by mitogens, whereas the JNK/SAPK and the p38 signaling pathways are preferentially stimulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and interleukin-1β and cellular stresses, including UV light, H2O2, and osmotic shock, and withdrawal of growth factors. Many lines of evidence demonstrate that the JNK/SAPK signaling pathway plays a role in apoptotic cell death induced by a variety of stresses (6Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1997; 1333: F85-F104Google Scholar, 7Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol... 1998; 10: 205-219Google Scholar, 8Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E.

Nature.. 1996; 380: 75-79Google Scholar). Among the MAPKKK family, MEKK1, MEKK2, MEKK3, and Tpl-2/Cot can stimulate both the ERK and the JNK/SAPK pathways (10Ichijo H. Oncogene.. 1999; 18: 6087-6093Google Scholar). On the other hand, TAK1 and MTK1/MEKK4 have been shown to activate both the JNK/SAPK and the p38 pathways. Recently, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) was also identified as an MAPKKK that activates both the JNK/SAPK and the p38 signaling cascades (11Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science.. 1997; 275: 90-94Google Scholar). Overexpression of ASK1 induces apoptotic cell death, and a dominant negative mutant of ASK1 prevents TNF-α and Fas-induced apoptosis (11Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science.. 1997; 275: 90-94Google Scholar, 12Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science.. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Google Scholar). TNF-α is a pro-inflammatory cytokine whose signals are mediated by two cell surface receptors, TNF receptor-1 (p55) and TNF receptor-2 (p75) (13Tartaglia L.A. Goeddel D.V. Immunol. Today.. 1992; 13: 151-153Google Scholar). As TNF-α binds to its receptors, receptor aggregation and the recruitment of cytoplasmic signaling proteins to TNF receptors are induced (14Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity.. 1996; 4: 387-396Google Scholar, 15Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell.. 1996; 84: 299-308Google Scholar, 16Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell.. 1995; 81: 495-504Google Scholar, 17Rothe M. Pan M.G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Cell.. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Google Scholar, 18Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell.. 1994; 78: 681-692Google Scholar, 19Shu H.B. Takeuchi M. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1996; 93: 13973-13978Google Scholar). One of the proteins recruited to TNF receptors is TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2). TRAF2 can interact directly with TNF receptor-2 (18Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell.. 1994; 78: 681-692Google Scholar) while it is recruited to TNF receptor-1 through TNF receptor-1-associated death domain protein (14Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity.. 1996; 4: 387-396Google Scholar, 15Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell.. 1996; 84: 299-308Google Scholar, 16Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell.. 1995; 81: 495-504Google Scholar). Recently, it is reported that TRAF2 and other TRAF proteins interact with and activate ASK1 (20Hoeflich K.P. Yeh W.C. Yao Z. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Oncogene.. 1999; 18: 5814-5820Google Scholar, 21Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K. Nakano H. Rothe M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mol. Cell.. 1998; 2: 389-395Google Scholar). ASK1 is thus a downstream target of TRAF2 in the TNF-α-dependent intracellular signaling cascade. Fas/Apo-1/CD95 is a cell surface protein that belongs to the TNF receptor superfamily (22Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science.. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Google Scholar). Fas can activate at least two distinct signaling pathways, each of which can lead to apoptotic cell death. In one of the pathways Fas interacts with Fas-associated death domain, which in turn recruits caspase-8 and activates the caspase cascade, resulting in apoptosis (23Abbas A.K. Cell.. 1996; 84: 655-657Google Scholar, 24Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell.. 1996; 85: 803-815Google Scholar, 25Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. Cell.. 1996; 85: 817-827Google Scholar, 26Nagata S. Cell.. 1997; 88: 355-365Google Scholar). In another pathway Fas interacts with the Fas-associated protein Daxx, which can bind and activate ASK1 (12Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science.. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Google Scholar). The Daxx-induced ASK1 activation leads to apoptotic cell death through the activation of the JNK/SAPK signaling pathway (12Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science.. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Google Scholar, 27Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell.. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Google Scholar). Thus, ASK1 is associated with the mechanism for apoptotic cell death. However, the molecular mechanism by which ASK1 activity is regulated in the cells is not understood completely. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a family of enzymes that catalyze the conjugation of reduced GSH to a variety of electrophiles. GSTs can also function as peroxidases and isomerases (28Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol... 1995; 30: 445-600Google Scholar). The GSTs possess two binding domains that are critical for their catalytic activity: a GSH binding site (G-site) and an adjacent substrate binding site (H-site) (29Mannervik B. Danielson U.H. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem... 1988; 23: 283-337Google Scholar, 30Rushmore T.H. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 11475-11478Google Scholar). In addition to their catalytic function, GSTs can also serve as nonenzymatic binding proteins (known as ligandins) interacting with various lipophilic compounds that include steroid and thyroid hormones (31Ishigaki S. Abramovitz M. Listowsky I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys... 1989; 273: 265-272Google Scholar, 32Ketley J.N. Habig W.H. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem... 1975; 250: 8670-8673Google Scholar, 33Litwack G. Ketterer B. Arias I.M. Nature.. 1971; 234: 466-467Google Scholar). Some evidence suggests that GST is involved in cellular defense against a broad spectrum of toxic agents that may be generated in the environment or within the cell (28Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol... 1995; 30: 445-600Google Scholar). On the basis of their primary structure, the mammalian cytosolic GSTs have been grouped into five classes, alpha, mu, pi, sigma, and theta. The most abundant ones are the alpha, mu, and pi classes (28Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol... 1995; 30: 445-600Google Scholar). All GST isoforms catalyze a similar reaction, but they share very little amino acid identity, typically no more than 25–30% (29Mannervik B. Danielson U.H. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem... 1988; 23: 283-337Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that mouse glutathioneS-transferase Mu 1-1 (mGSTM1-1) physically interacts with ASK1 and, in doing so, functions as a negative regulator of ASK1 inside cells, repressing ASK1-mediated signals. The ASK1-inhibiting action of mGSTM1-1 appears to be independent of its transferase activity. Thus, our study uncovered a novel function for mGSTM1-1 insofar as this enzyme may participate in the regulation of stress-activated signals by suppressing ASK1 activity. ASK1 mutants, ASK-ΔN, ASK1-ΔC, and ASK1-NT were generated by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pLexA (CLONTECH) and pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Mouse mGSTM1 cDNA was obtained from a mouse adult brain LexA cDNA library (CLONTECH). ASK1(K709R) and mGSTM1-1(Y6F) were constructed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). mGSTM1-1 deletion mutants mGSTM1-ΔN-(85–218) and mGSTM1-ΔC-(1–84) were made by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pET-28a (Novagen). The construction of GST-SEK(K129R), GST-c-Jun-(1–135), and ΔMEKK1 has been described previously (34Park J. Kim I. Oh Y.J. Lee K. Han P.L. Choi E.J. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 16725-16728Google Scholar,35Shim J. Lee H. Park J. Kim H. Choi E.J. Nature.. 1996; 381: 804-806Google Scholar). Daxx-(498–740), an active mutant of Daxx, was a generous gift from Dr. S. H. Kim (Sungkyunkwan University, Korea). 293 human embryonic kidney cells and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). For DNA transfection, cells were plated in 100-mm dishes (2.5 × 106 cells/plate), grown overnight, and transfected with appropriate expression vectors by the calcium phosphate method (36Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar) or by using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). To search for ASK1-binding proteins, a yeast two-hybrid screening, was carried out as described in the manufacturer's protocol (CLONTECH). Briefly, a full-length ASK1 cDNA was fused in-frame to the LexA DNA-binding domain in the pLexA bait plasmid. Approximately 2 × 106 clones of a mouse adult brain cDNA library in pB42AD prey plasmid were screened using a EGY48 yeast strain that had been transformed with p8op-LacZ. Plasmid DNAs of positive clones were recovered after transformation into Escherichia coli KC8 cells, and the cDNA inserts were sequenced. To test the physical interactions of ectopically expressed proteins, 293 cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing either ASK1-FLAG or ASK1-ΔN-FLAG along with HA-tagged mGSTM1-1 using LipofectAMINE. After 30 h of transfection, cells were solubilized in buffer A that contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 12 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. The soluble fraction was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The resultant immunopellets underwent SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma Chemical Co.) using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To examine the effect of mGSTM1-1 on the oligomerization of ASK1, 293 cells were transfected with expression vectors producing ASK1-FLAG and ASK1-HA along with mGSTM1-1. After 30 h of transfection, the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with mouse anti-FLAG antibody. Then, the immunopellets were analyzed by immunoblot using mouse anti-HA antibody. To test interactions between endogenous proteins, mouse liver tissue was minced with scissors and homogenized in buffer A with an IKA Ultra Turrax homogenizer (IKA Labotechnik). The homogenate was subjected to centrifugation at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The soluble fraction was precleared with rabbit preimmune IgG and protein G-Sepharose and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with rabbit preimmune IgG, rabbit anti-mGSTM1-1 antibody (Calbiochem), or rabbit anti-ASK1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunopellets were analyzed by immunoblot probed with rabbit anti-ASK1 antibody. Cells were lysed in buffer A and subjected to microcentrifugation at 12,000 × g. The solubilized fraction was then subjected to immunoprecipitation with the appropriate antibodies, and the immunopellets were assayed for the indicated protein kinases as described previously (34Park J. Kim I. Oh Y.J. Lee K. Han P.L. Choi E.J. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 16725-16728Google Scholar, 35Shim J. Lee H. Park J. Kim H. Choi E.J. Nature.. 1996; 381: 804-806Google Scholar). Phosphorylated substrates were visualized and quantified after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a Fuji BAS 2500 phosphorescence imager. GST-SEK1(K129R), GST-c-Jun-(1–135), GST-ATF2-(1–109), or myelin basic protein was used as a substrate for ASK1, SAPK/JNK, p38, or ERK2, respectively. mGSTM1-1 was bacterially expressed and purified with glutathione-agarose beads. Hexahistidine (His)-tagged mGSTM1-1, mGSTM1-ΔN, or mGSTM1-ΔC was bacterially produced and purified with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose beads. ASK1 and its mutant counterparts were in vitro translated in the presence of [35S]methionine using the TnT reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The 35S-labeled proteins were incubated at 4 °C for 3 h with mGSTM1-1 or its mutant proteins immobilized onto the beads in binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The beads were harvested and washed three times with washing buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1% Tween 20). The 35S-labeled proteins were then eluted from the beads and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The transcription stimulating activity of c-Jun was assayed with the PathDetect luciferase reporter kit (Stratagene). Typically, 293 cells were transiently transfected with pFR-Luc, pFA2-c-Jun, pcDNA3-mGSTM1-1, pcDNA3-ASK1, and pcDNA3-β-gal, as indicated. After 48 h of transfection, cells were lysed and subjected to microcentrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min. The soluble fraction was assayed for luciferase activity using a luciferase assay kit (Promega). The luciferase activity in the transfected cells was normalized with reference to the β-galactosidase activity in the same cells. Cultured cells were transfected with pEGFP (CLONTECH) and plasmids expressing the indicated proteins. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 0.25% glutaraldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with DAPI. The DAPI-stained nuclei in GFP-positive cells were examined for apoptotic morphology by fluorescence microscopy. The percentage of GFP-expressing cells that were apoptotic was determined from three independent dishes. To better understand the molecular mechanism for the regulation of the ASK1 activity, we decided to identify proteins that can physically interact with ASK1 using the yeast two-hybrid screening method with a mouse adult brain cDNA library. Eight strongly positive clones were identified after the second round of screening using leucine/tryptophan/histidine/uracil-deficient medium and X-gal plates. Five of the positive clones were identified as thioredoxin, as reported previously (37Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J... 1998; 17: 2596-2606Google Scholar). Two other positive clones were identified as a gene encoding a mouse class mu GST, mGSTM1-1. In subsequent experiments, we examined which portion of the ASK1 protein was responsible for the binding to mGSTM1-1 in the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig.1, A and B). Several bait plasmids that encoded a full-length, an N-terminally deleted, or a C-terminally deleted ASK1 fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain were constructed. ASK1-NT, ASK1-ΔC, or ASK1-ΔN encode amino acids 1–656, 1–936, or 649–1375 of the ASK1 protein, respectively (Fig. 1 A). In the two-hybrid assay, mGSTM1-1 was able to bind the full-length ASK1, ASK1-NT, and ASK1-ΔC, but not ASK1-ΔN (Fig. 1 B). It was further tested whether mGSTM1-1 could directly interact with ASK1 in an in vitro binding assay (Fig. 1 C). Purified recombinant mGSTM1-1 did indeed physically associate with in vitro translated35S-labeled ASK1 (WT, wild-type), ASK1-ΔC, or ASK1-NT, but not with ASK1-ΔN. mGSTM1-1 bound ASK1 with a ratio of 2:1 in anin vitro cross-linking experiment using disuccinimidyl suberate (data not shown). To confirm that mGSTM1-1 interacted with ASK1 in intact mammalian cells, 293 cells were cotransfected with expression vectors producing FLAG-tagged ASK1 and HA-tagged mGSTM1-1. The lysed transfected cells were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody. Immunoblot analysis of the immunoprecipitated protein complexes demonstrated that mGSTM1-1 was coimmunoprecipitated with full-length ASK1, but not with ASK1-ΔN (Fig. 1 D). Next, the interaction of the two endogenous proteins ASK1 and mGSTM1-1 in mouse liver tissue was examined. The liver lysate was immunoprecipitated with either rabbit preimmune IgG or anti-GSTM1-1 antibody, and the immunocomplexes were analyzed with anti-ASK1 antibody by immunoblot (Fig. 1 E). The immunoblot data show that mGSTM1-1 was physically associated with ASK1 in cells from mouse liver. Collectively, our data suggest that ASK1 directly interacts with mGSTM1-1 and that the N-terminal portion of ASK1 is critically involved in this binding. To identify which region of mGSTM1-1 is crucial for binding to ASK1, we carried out an in vitro binding assay using His-tagged mGSTM1-1, mGSTM1-ΔN, and mGSTM1-ΔC (Fig.2 A). mGSTM1-ΔN and mGSTM1-ΔC produce amino acid residues 85–218 and 1–84 of mGSTM1-1, respectively. In vitro translated 35S-labeled ASK1 associated well with mGSTM1-1 and mGSTM1-ΔN but scarcely with mGSTM1-ΔC. It is noteworthy that mGSTM1-ΔC (amino acid residues 1–84 of mGSTM1-1) includes the amino acid residues necessary for the GSH binding (28Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol... 1995; 30: 445-600Google Scholar). Indeed, our in vitro binding study shows that mGSTM1-ΔC was able to bind to GSH-affinity resin with a high efficiency (data not shown). Furthermore, the binding of mGSTM1-ΔC or mGSTM1-1 to the GSH-agarose beads was reduced in the presence of free GSH (Fig. 2 B). Thus, mGSTM1-ΔC appears to be functionally active for the GSH binding, but it binds little, if any, to ASK1. Taken together, these data suggest that the N-terminal region (amino acids 1–84) of mGSTM1-1 may not be critical for an interaction with ASK1. Because our data indicated that mGSTM1-1 directly interacted with ASK1, we decided to examine whether mGSTM1-1 could modulate ASK1 activity. The enzymatic activity of ectopically expressed ASK1 was stimulated by exposure of the transfected cells to UV radiation or H2O2(Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, mGSTM1-1 repressed both the UV- and the H2O2-stimulated activity of ASK1. Because it had been recently reported that Daxx activates ASK1 (12Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science.. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Google Scholar), the effect of mGSTM1-1 on Daxx-stimulated ASK1 activity was examined in the following experiments. Cotransfection of 293 cells with plasmids expressing ASK1 and Daxx-(498–740), an active mutant of Daxx (12Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science.. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Google Scholar), resulted in ASK1 activation (Fig. 3 C). The Daxx-(498–740)-stimulated ASK1 activity was suppressed by mGSTM1-1. We also examined whether mGSTM1-1 could suppress ASK1 activity in vitro (Fig.4 A). In the in vitro kinase assay, ASK1 activity was inhibited by mGSTM1-1, but not by other GST isoforms such as GST pi and GST alpha. In the separatein vitro kinase assays, mGSTM1-1 did not inhibit activities of other protein kinases, including JNK1, p38, and ERK2 (Fig.4 B). Purified recombinant mGSTM1-1 inhibited ASK1 in a noncompetitive inhibition mode, and the inhibitor constant (Ki) for ASK1 by GSTμ was 7.3 × 10−9m (data not shown). Taken together, the data indicate that mGSTM1-1 can function as a specific inhibitor of ASK1 in vitro and in intact cells.Figure 4In vitro effects of GST isoforms on ASK1 activity. A, 293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-ASK1-FLAG and irradiated with UV light (60 J/m2) at 48 h after transfection. The cell lysates then underwent immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody. The immunopellets were assayed for ASK1 activity by immunocomplex kinase assay in the presence of mouse GSTM1-1, human GSTP1-1, or human GSTA1-1. B, 293 cells were transfected with HA-JNK1, p38-FLAG, or HA-ERK2 construct. After 48 h of transfection, the cells were exposed either to 60 J/m2 UV light (for JNK1 and p38 activation) or to 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 10 min (for ERK2 activation). The cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibody, and the immunopellets were assayed for the indicated kinase activity in the presence of purified GSTμ protein (4 μg/assay).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Next, we tested whether the GSH-conjugating catalytic activity of mGSTM1-1 is critical for the ASK1 inhibition. It has been shown that a conserved N-terminal tyrosine residue in the GST isoforms is critical for the catalytic activity of the various GSTs (38Lee H.C. Toung Y.P. Tu Y.S. Tu C.P. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 99-109Google Scholar, 39Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Ladenstein R. Schaffer J. Gallay O. Huber R. EMBO J... 1991; 10: 1997-2005Google Scholar). We, therefore, constructed a mutant form of mGSTM1-1, mGSTM1-1(Y6F), in which this tyrosine residue was replaced by a phenylalanine residue in the 6th amino acid position. mGSTM1-1(Y6F) was a catalytically inactive form of mGSTM1-1 by GST enzyme assay using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (data not shown). Subsequently, the inhibitory effects of wild-type mGSTM1-1 and mGSTM1-1(Y6F) on ASK1 activation were evaluated by cotransfection studies. Our data demonstrate that mGSTM1-1(Y6F) was as effective as mGSTM1-1 in inhibiting H2O2-stimulated ASK1 activity (Fig. 5 A). We also tested whether an intracellular level of GSH could modulate the inhibitory function of mGSTM1-1 on ASK1 activity by treating the cells with l-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine (BSO), an agent that depletes intracellular GSH by inhibiting GSH biosynthesis (40Gopalakrishna R. Chen Z.H. Gundimeda U. Arch. Biochem. Biophys... 1997; 348: 37-48Google Scholar, 41Meister A. Cancer Res... 1994; 54: 1969s-1975sGoogle Scholar, 42Plummer J.L. Smith B.R. Sies H. Bend J.R.

The treatment with BSO did not abolish the inhibitory action of mGSTM1-1 on the H2O2-stimulated ASK1 activity (Fig.5 B). A recent study by Gotoh and Cooper (44Gotoh Y. Cooper J.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 17477-17482Google Scholar) demonstrated that homo-oligomerization of ASK1 is an important mechanism for ASK1 activation. We, therefore, examined whether mGSTM1-1 could modulate the oligomerization of ASK1 to suppress ASK1 activity. 293 cells were cotransfected with ASK1-FLAG and ASK1-HA constructs in the presence or absence of mGSTM1-1 construct. Coimmunoprecipitation study demonstrated that ASK1-HA was present in ASK1-FLAG immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6). These data indicate that ASK1 oligomerization occurred in the cells overexpressing both ASK1-FLAG and ASK1-HA. Coexpression of mGSTM1-1 with ASK1-FLAG and ASK1-HA resulted in disruption of the ASK1 oligomerization (Fig. 6). Thus, our data suggest that the inhibition of ASK1 oligomerization may be at least one mechanism by which mGSTM1-1 suppresses ASK1 activation. One of the major downstream signals of ASK1 is the activation of JNK/SAPK, which in turn results in the stimulation of the transcriptional activity of c-Jun (7Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol... 1998; 10: 205-219Google Scholar). We tested whether the ASK1 inhibition by mGSTM1-1 could result in a decrease in the activities of the downstream signals. Overexpression of ASK1 by itself was sufficient to stimulate JNK/SAPK activity in transfected cells even without any further treatment (Fig.7 A). Our data show that mGSTM1-1 mitigated the ASK1-induced SAPKβ activation. In comparison, mGSTM1-1 did not affect SAPKβ activity stimulated by overexpression of ΔMEKK1, a constitutively active form of MEKK1. Overexpressed ASK1 can also induce the transcription stimulating activity of c-Jun (Fig.7 B). We, therefore, examined the action of mGSTM1-1 on the ASK1-dependent transactivating activity of c-Jun. mGSTM1-1 repressed the ASK1-induced stimulation of c-Jun-mediated luciferase reporter activity. We examined whether mGSTM1-1 would affect ASK1-dependent apoptotic cell death. ASK1 was initially discovered as a MAPKKK that could activate apoptosis initiated by TNF-α or by the Fas-Daxx pathway (11Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science.. 1997; 275: 90-94Google Scholar, 12Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science.. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Google Scholar). We, therefore, tested the effect of mGSTM1-1 on TNF-α- or Daxx-induced apoptotic cell death (Fig. 8). Exposure of HeLa cells to TNF-α markedly enhanced apoptotic cell death (Fig. 8A), whereas the TNF-α-induced apoptosis was reduced by the expression of ASK1(K709R), a catalytically inactive form of ASK1. This suggests that ASK1 is associated with the mechanism operating in TNF-α-induced apoptosis. mGSTM1-1 alleviated the TNF-α-induced apoptosis of transfected HeLa cells to the same extent as ASK1(K709R) (Fig. 8 A). Overexpression of Daxx-(498–740), an active mutant of Daxx, enhanced cell death in transfected 293 cells (Fig. 8 B), and this cell death was suppressible by ASK1(K709R). mGSTM1-1 also suppressed the Daxx-(498–740)-induced cell death. In our present study, we demonstrate that mGSTM1-1 directly interacts with the N-terminal portion of ASK1 both in vivoand in vitro and that this interaction results in suppression of ASK1 activity as well as ASK1-dependent apoptotic cell death. The detoxification reaction catalyzed by GST may be one of the most important survival tools that living organisms have developed. GST conjugates reduced glutathione to a variety of electrophilic xenobiotics or products of oxidative stress (28Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol... 1995; 30: 445-600Google Scholar). It is thus involved in the protection of cells against chemical stress. GST is also able to nonenzymatically bind, both covalently and noncovalently, various other chemical compounds, which include steroid and thyroid hormones, bile acids, bilirubin, heme, and fatty acids, all of which are not substrates for its enzymatic activity (28Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol... 1995; 30: 445-600Google Scholar). Considering that intracellular concentrations of GST in many tissues are at micromolar levels, GST could constitute an intracellular binding pool for lipophilic ligands. This type of “ligandin” function could serve the purpose of preventing cytotoxic ligands from interacting with their intracellular targets (33Litwack G. Ketterer B. Arias I.M. Nature.. 1971; 234: 466-467Google Scholar). It is also noteworthy that one class of GST, GST pi, can associate with and inhibit JNK (45Adler V. Yin Z. Fuchs S.Y. Benezra M. Rosario L. Tew K.D. Pincus M.R. Sardana M. Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. EMBO J... 1999; 18: 1321-1334Google Scholar), thus possibly keeping basal JNK activity low in nonstressed cells. Our data in this study indicate that mGSTM1-1 similarly interacts with ASK1 and that this interaction causes the suppression of the enzymatic activity of ASK1, which is one of the upstream kinases of JNK. It is tempting to propose a function for GSTs as endogenous negative regulators of the JNK signaling pathway through multiple mechanisms: GST mu acts on ASK1, and GST pi acts on JNK. It has been well documented that the expression of GSTs can be induced in many organisms by exposure to a variety of stresses, including oxidative stress and that c-Jun is one of the transcription factors involved in this induction (28Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol... 1995; 30: 445-600Google Scholar). Oxidative stress can also activate ASK1 and other components in the JNK signaling pathway leading to c-Jun activation (6Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1997; 1333: F85-F104Google Scholar, 7Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol... 1998; 10: 205-219Google Scholar, 37Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J... 1998; 17: 2596-2606Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that oxidative stress and other stress factors that activate ASK1 can induce mGSTM1-1 expression and that the expressed mGSTM1-1 protein can suppress the stress-activated ASK1 activity. This type of regulatory loop may be an integral part of the defense mechanism by which mGSTM1-1 protects cells from a variety of stresses, including oxidative stress. On the basis of our data, therefore, we propose a new function for mGSTM1-1: mGSTM1-1 modulates stress-activated signals by suppressing ASK1 in a way that is independent of its transferase activity.

While Akt regulates GSK3α/β in the phosphatidylinositide 3-OH kinase signaling pathway, its role in Wnt signaling is unknown. Here we report that expression of Wnt or Dishevelled (Dvl) increased Akt activity. Activated Akt bound to the Axin-GSK3β complex in the presence of Dvl, phosphorylated GSK3β and increased free β-catenin levels. Furthermore, in Wnt-overexpressing PC12 cells, dominant-negative Akt decreased free β-catenin and derepressed nerve growth factor-induced differentiation. Therefore, Akt acts in association with Dvl as an important regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway.

The interaction between secreted Wnt glycoproteins and their cognate Frizzled receptors leads to the activation of Dvl1 protein, which transmits the Wnt signal to downstream effectors. By inhibiting phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK3β, activated Dvl prevents the ubiquitination and subsequent proteosomal degradation of β-catenin. The resulting accumulation of free β-catenin enhances its interaction with transcription factors of the lymphoid enhancer factor-T cell factor (LEF/TCF) family and induces the transcription of target genes such as cyclin D1 and c-myc (1Cadigan K.M.

Two mechanisms have been advanced to account for the inhibition of GSK3β by Dvl: 1) the catalytic activity of GSK3β is blocked by serine phosphorylation (1Cadigan K.M. Nusse R.

However, in the first instance, the process whereby Dvl stimulates serine phosphorylation has not been elucidated; nor is it clear whether these two mechanisms function in a concerted manner to promote Wnt signaling. The serine/threonine kinase Akt (protein Kinase B/related to A and protein kinase C) is a major effector of the PI3K pathway and is activated by many polypeptide growth factors (14Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 15Stambolic V. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R.

The recruitment of Akt from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane by the lipid products of PI3K leads to Akt phosphorylation by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinases. This phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 and Ser473results in its activation. Akt acts in part through its phosphorylation of GSK3α/β, which in turn regulates cell metabolism. Recognizing the pivotal role of GSK3β in Wnt signaling, we tested the hypothesis that Akt functions in this pathway to control GSK3β activity. PC12, Int5 and Tni3 cells were cultured as described (17Shackleford G.M. Willert K. Wang J. Varmus H.E. Neuron. 1993; 11: 865-875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone Laboratories), 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.35), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 1 mmnon-essential amino acids (all from Life Technologies, Inc.). NIH-3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Mouse Dvl-1, Akt-1, Axin, and rat GSK3β were prepared by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the high fidelity thermostable DNA polymerase PfuTurbo (Stratagene). Dvl-1 was subcloned in frame into pcDNA3.1(−)/Myc-His (Invitrogen) to introduce Myc-His epitope tags at the C terminus. GSK3β was subcloned into pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen). Axin and Akt-1 were subcloned either in frame or with a stop codon into pFLAG-CMV™-5 (Sigma) to yield protein with or without FLAG tag at the C terminus, respectively. Deletion mutants of Dvl-1, N-Dvl-(1–497), and C-Dvl-(369–695) were generated by PCR and subcloned in frame into pcDNA3.1(−)/Myc-His. The C-terminal (β-catenin binding) region of E-cadherin (18Bafico A. Gazit A. Wu-Morgan S.S. Yaniv A. Aaronson S.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR in frame into pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for GST-E-cadherin pull-down assay. Four recombinant first-generation type 5 adenoviruses were used in these studies. Ad.EGFP has been described previously (19Matsui T. Li L. Del Monte F. Fukui Y. Franke T.F. Hajjar R.J. Rosenzweig A. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2373-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Ad.AAA-Akt and Ad.β-gal.EGFP, which also express EGFP, were constructed using the method described previously (20He T.C. Zhou S. Da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3252) Google Scholar). The wild type Akt-expressing adenovirus was constructed using Akt-HA (kindly provided by T. Franke) in pAdRSV-4 (kindly provided by D. Dichek) and obtaining homologous recombinants through co-transfection with pJM17 (Microbix Biosystems) in 293 cells. Wnt-3a- and control-conditioned medium were prepared essentially as described (21Shibamoto S. Higano K. Takada R. Ito F. Takeichi M. Takada S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We verified that Wnt-3a medium specifically up-regulated the cellular β-catenin levels in L cells. 293T cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE™ (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 6-well plates with 30 ng/well of TOPFlash or FOPFlash luciferase reporter (Upstate Biotechnology) together with effector plasmids or empty pcDNA3 vector (amount added to keep the total DNA content at 1 μg/well) as described in the figure legends. Cell extracts were prepared 24 h after transfection by a detergent lysis method (Promega). Transfection efficiencies were normalized by pCMVβ-gal reporter activity (CLONTECH). Each construct was transfected at least three times in triplicate. Reporter activities (mean ± S.D.) are presented as the -fold increase of TOPFlash activity from the cells transfected with empty vector. Cell lysates were prepared in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (Complete™-without EDTA, Roche). Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting with indicated antibodies. Cell lysates were precleared with protein A or G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech or Calbiochem, respectively) for 1 h at 4 °C, and then incubated with the indicated antibody and protein A or G-Sepharose beads for 3.5 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were pelleted and washed three times with cold lysis buffer. The samples were subjected to immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. Akt activity was measured using an Akt kinase assay kit (New England BioLabs) with recombinant GSK3 as a substrate for immunoprecipitated Akt. Free β-catenin levels were detected by GST-E-cadherin pull-down assay as described (18Bafico A. Gazit A. Wu-Morgan S.S. Yaniv A. Aaronson S.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). GST-E-cadherin fusion protein was expressed in bacteria and purified by binding to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 1 mg of cell lysate was incubated with GST-E-cadherin-beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed, and proteins were dissolved in Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting with anti-β-catenin antibody. Cells were incubated in differentiation medium (DMEM supplemented with 1% horse serum and 100 ng/ml NGF (Austral Biologicals)) or growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% FBS). Medium was refreshed every 48 h. Neurite out-growth was defined as a phase dark process with a clearly defined growth cone that was at least 1.5 cell diameters in length. Experiments were carried out in triplicate and repeated at least three times, and in each experiment cells were counted by at least two individuals who were blinded to the groups. Where indicated, comparisons between groups were made by factorial analysis of variance followed by Scheffe's test (Fig. 1 B) or by unpaired Student's t test (Fig.5 C) when appropriate. Significance was accepted atp < 0.05.Figure 5Dominant-negative Akt restores neuronal differentiation of Int5 cells.

In a Wnt-1-overexpressing PC12 cell line (Int5) (17Shackleford G.M. Willert K. Wang J. Varmus H.E. Neuron. 1993; 11: 865-875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), but not in either the parental PC12 or in an antisense Wnt-1-expressing PC12 cell line (Tni3), Akt was phosphorylated at both Thr308 and Ser473 (Fig.1 A). The phosphorylation of both residues is necessary and sufficient for full Akt activation (16Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar). Accordingly, Akt activity, measured by its ability to phosphorylate recombinant GSK3β, was much higher in Int5 cells than in control cells (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser9, which results in its inactivation (10Stambolic V. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), was higher in Int5 than in control cells (Fig. 1, A andB). Phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β was inhibited by the Wnt antagonist-secreted Frizzled-related protein-1 (sFRP-1) (Fig.1 C) accompanied by a reduction in free β-catenin as we showed previously (22Uren A. Reichsman F. Anest V. Taylor W.G. Muraiso K. Bottaro D.P. Cumberledge S. Rubin J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4374-4382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). These results indicated that phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β, and free β-catenin levels in Int5 cells, were dependent on secreted Wnt-1 protein. To extend these observations to other cells, we also analyzed Akt phosphorylation in NIH-3T3 cells transiently transfected with Wnt-1, Dvl-1, and a β-catenin mutant (S37A β-catenin). Previous studies had shown that overexpression of these gene products cause an increase in free β-catenin, indicative of Wnt signaling (2Smalley M.J. Dale T.C. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1999; 18: 215-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 8Ruel L. Stambolic V. Ali A. Manoukian A.S. Woodgett J.R. J. Biol.

Transient expression of Wnt-1 or Dvl-1, but not S37A β-catenin, increased Akt phosphorylation (Fig.1 D). These results indicated that Akt activation is a consequence of Wnt signaling that occurs downstream of Dvl. To determine whether activated Akt is required for the canonical Wnt signaling, we used a dominant-negative form of Akt (AAA-Akt) (26Wang Q. Somwar R. Bilan P.J. Liu Z. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Klip A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4008-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Int5 cells infected with an adenovirus expressing AAA-Akt (Ad.AAA-Akt) showed reductions in phosphorylated GSK3β and free β-catenin protein levels (Fig. 2 A). These changes did not occur in cells infected with control virus (Ad.β-gal.EGFP). In transient transfection assays using 293T cells, Wnt-1, Dvl-1, and S37A β-catenin each enhanced TCF-binding site reporter gene activity (TOPFlash) (Fig. 2 B). AAA-Akt suppressed TOPFlash activity induced by Wnt-1 or Dvl-1 but did not affect the S37A β-catenin induced activity (Fig. 2 B). The activity of the mutated TCF-binding site reporter (FOPFlash) was not affected in these experiments (data not shown and Fig.3 B). These results implied that Akt is involved in Wnt signaling, functioning at a point in the pathway between Dvl and β-catenin.Figure 3Akt enhances Wnt signaling in the presence of Dvl. A, Akt expression increases free β-catenin levels in Int5 cells but not in Tni3 cells. Tni3 and Int5 cells were infected with Ad.EGFP or Ad.Akt, and cells were harvested after 3 days. The cell lysates were probed with anti-Akt antibody.B, Akt increases the expression of a Wnt target gene in the presence of Dvl. 293T cells were transfected with the TOPFlash or the FOPFlash reporter together with plasmids of Akt and Dvl-1 (170 ng/well) or pcDNA3 as indicated. TOPFlash (closed bars) or FOPFlash (open bars) reporter activities are presented as the -fold increase of TOPFlash activity from the cells transfected with empty vector.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether Akt activity is sufficient to stimulate an increase in free β-catenin, we infected Int5 and Tni3 cells with either an adenovirus-expressing wild type Akt (Ad.Akt) or a control adenovirus (Ad.EGFP). Although the amount and activity of Akt protein were similarly increased in both lines infected with Ad.Akt, a rise in free β-catenin levels was seen only in the Int5 cells (Fig. 3 A). These results demonstrated that Akt activity was not sufficient to up-regulate free β-catenin but that it could augment the activity of a Wnt stimulus. Recalling that a dominant-negative form of Akt inhibited Wnt signaling induced by Dvl, we postulated that Akt might act in conjunction with Dvl to promote Wnt signaling. Overexpression of Akt in 293T cells produced a dose-dependent increase in Akt activity (Fig.3 B). As observed with PC12 cell derivatives (Fig.3 A), Akt activity was not sufficient to induce Wnt signaling in the reporter assay. However, Akt enhanced TOPFlash activity that was stimulated by Dvl-1 (Fig. 3 B) but not by S37A β-catenin (data not shown). Neither Akt nor Dvl-1 affected control FOPFlash activity (Fig. 3 B). These results suggested that Dvl is required for Akt to up-regulate Wnt-dependent gene expression. To delineate the mechanism of Akt and Dvl signal transduction, we investigated their interaction with the Axin complex. Others have shown that activated Dvl binds Axin and recruits GSK3β-binding protein to the Axin complex. This binding induces a conformational change in the complex, resulting in the inhibition of GSK3β phosphorylation of β-catenin (2Smalley M.J. Dale T.C. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1999; 18: 215-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 12Salic A. Lee E. Mayer L. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 523-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 13Kikuchi A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1999; 10: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We first investigated the association between endogenous Akt and Axin. Similar to Wnt-1, Wnt-3a-conditioned medium induces the canonical Wnt signaling pathway (2Smalley M.J. Dale T.C. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1999; 18: 215-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 9Brown J.D. Moon R.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 25Lee J.S. Ishimoto A. Yanagawa S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21464-21470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Axin was co-immunoprecipitated with Akt in 293T cells treated for 24 h with Wnt-3a-conditioned medium but not control medium (Fig.4 A). Thus, the association of Akt with Axin requires a Wnt stimulus. Consistent with results using Wnt-1-overexpressing PC12 cells (Fig. 1 A), these Wnt-3a-treated 293T cells had increased phosphorylation levels of Akt and GSK3β (Fig. 4 A, Cell lysate). We also examined total GSK3β in cell lysates and GSK3β in the Axin complex, the latter defined as the GSK3β protein co-immunoprecipitated with Axin. In transfected 293T cells, Dvl expression stimulated the phosphorylation of both total GSK3β (Fig. 4 B,Cell lysate) and GSK3β in the Axin complex (Fig.4 B, IP). Akt expression alone did not affect the phosphorylation of GSK3β in the Axin complex (Fig. 4 B,IP), although it did stimulate the phosphorylation of total GSK3β (Fig. 4 B, Cell lysate). However, in the presence of Dvl, Akt increased the amount of phosphorylated GSK3β in the Axin complex (Fig. 4 B, IP). These results suggested that Dvl was necessary for Akt-dependent phosphorylation of GSK3β in the Axin complex. Furthermore, phosphorylated Akt was included in the Axin complex only in the presence of Dvl (Fig. 4 B). Dvl protein family members contain three highly conserved domains: an N-terminal DIX (Dishevelled-Axin) domain, a central PDZ (PSD-95-Discs-large-ZO-1) domain, and a C-terminal DEP (Dishevelled-EGL-10-Pleckstrin) domain (13Kikuchi A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1999; 10: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 27Boutros M. Mlodzik M. Mech. Dev. 1999; 83: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Although the roles of each domain have not been elucidated completely, either the DIX or PDZ domain is sufficient for Axin binding (11Li L. Yuan H. Weaver C.D. Mao J. Farr 3rd, G.H. Sussman D.J. Jonkers J. Kimelman D. Wu D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4233-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). To confirm that Dvl binding to Axin is necessary for Akt involvement in the Axin complex, Dvl mutants were generated. Consistent with previous reports (11Li L. Yuan H. Weaver C.D. Mao J. Farr 3rd, G.H. Sussman D.J. Jonkers J. Kimelman D. Wu D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4233-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 28Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Hino S. Ikeda S. Kishida M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4414-4422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), C-Dvl-(369–695), which lacks both the DIX and PDZ domains, did not bind to Axin, whereas N-Dvl-(1–497), which lacks the C-terminal region adjacent to the DEP domain, bound to Axin (Fig. 4 C). Full-length Dvl and N-Dvl-(1–497), but not C-Dvl-(369–695), induced Akt interaction with the Axin complex (Fig. 4 C). Although the magnitude of Akt association with the Axin complex induced by N-Dvl (1) was less than that seen with full-length Dvl-1, this difference was consistent with the relative amounts of the recombinantly expressed Dvl proteins (Fig. 4 C). C-Dvl-(369–695) and N-Dvl-(1–497) were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 4 C), indicating that the absence of Akt in the Axin complex is not due to reduced C-Dvl-(369–695) expression levels. These results suggest that the N-terminal region of Dvl, which can bind to Axin, is required to induce Akt association with the Axin complex. Akt did not interact directly with Axin or Dvl (Fig. 4 B and data not shown). However, Akt binding to the Axin complex may be mediated by GSK3β, judging from the correlation of Akt and GSK3β levels in the complex (Fig. 4 D). As shown in Fig.4 D, the amount of GSK3β and Akt protein in the Axin complex was higher in GSK3β-overexpressing cells than in control cells. Taken together, our results indicate that Dvl binding to the Axin complex enables Akt to associate with and to phosphorylate GSK3β in the complex. Wnt signaling frequently is responsible for changes in cell morphology and differentiation (1Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar, 2Smalley M.J. Dale T.C. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1999; 18: 215-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 3Waltzer L. Bienz M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1999; 18: 231-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For instance, the Wnt-overexpressing Int5 cells have a flat shape and do not differentiate with NGF treatment, whereas the parental PC12 cells are round and differentiate readily in response to NGF (17Shackleford G.M. Willert K. Wang J. Varmus H.E. Neuron. 1993; 11: 865-875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). sFRP-1-treated Int5 cells differentiated in response to NGF (Fig.5 A); this implies that the phenotype of Int5 cells depends on Wnt signaling. To test the impact of Akt on this Wnt-dependent cellular phenotype, we infected Int5 cells with either a dominant-negative Akt (Ad.AAA-Akt) or a control (Ad.β-gal.EGFP) adenovirus. In contrast to the cells treated with control virus, Int5 cells infected with Ad.AAA-Akt had a more differentiated appearance with extensive neurite outgrowth in response to NGF (Fig. 5 B and C). Neuronal differentiation of Int5 cells was confirmed by changes in peripherin levels. Consistent with a previous report (29Issack P.S. Ziff E.B. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 837-845PubMed Google Scholar), in response to NGF, Wnt-1-overexpressing PC12 cells (Int5) did not up-regulate peripherin protein expression, whereas parental PC12 cells did (Fig. 5 D). However, Ad.AAA-Akt-infected Int5 cells exhibited increased levels of peripherin when cultured in differentiation medium (Fig. 5 D). Increased levels of peripherin are the result of Int5 cell differentiation but not of a direct effect of AAA-Akt, because peripherin levels of PC12 and Int5 cells in growth medium were not enhanced by Ad.AAA-Akt infection (Fig. 5 D, growth). These results demonstrated that inhibition of Akt activity reversed the Wnt-dependent phenotype of Int5 cells, reinforcing the evidence that Akt has an important role in the Wnt signaling pathway. Here we show that Wnt signaling stimulates Akt and that activated Akt, in association with Dvl, enhances the phosphorylation of GSK3β in the Axin complex. The concerted action of Dvl and Akt is a distinctive feature of Wnt signaling, which targets phosphorylation of the GSK3β pool that is directly responsible for phosphorylation of β-catenin and its subsequent rapid degradation. This finding explains why other factors, such as insulin and epidermal growth factor, that stimulate Akt through the PI3K pathway but do not activate Dvl fail to cause an increase in cytosolic β-catenin (30Chen R.H. Ding W.V. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17894-17899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 31Ding V.W. Chen R.H. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32475-32481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). We believe that Dvl interaction with Axin induces a conformational change, allowing Axin-bound GSK3β to be phosphorylated by Akt. This phosphorylated GSK3β cannot modify β-catenin efficiently, which consequently accumulates in the cytosol and translocates to the nucleus where it combines with LEF/TCF family members to up-regulate Wnt-dependent gene expression. Past reports have suggested that Akt is not involved in Wnt signaling (30Chen R.H. Ding W.V. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17894-17899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 32Torres M.A. Eldar-Finkelman H. Krebs E.G. Moon R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1427-1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to these accounts, we observed that Akt by itself was not sufficient to mimic a Wnt signal. Also consistent with this literature, constitutively active membrane-bound forms of Akt (14Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar) did not enhance TOPFlash activity, even in the presence of Dvl overexpression (data not shown). Presumably, membrane-anchored Akt is unable to interact with the Axin complex in the cytosol and consequently cannot regulate GSK3β activity in this critical pool. In contrast to these constitutively active forms, wild type Akt is activated at the plasma membrane and then translocates to the cellular interior (15Stambolic V. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6094-6103Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Previous studies did not detect Akt activation and resulting GSK3β phosphorylation at Ser9 when cells were treated with Wnt/Wg-conditioned medium for short time periods, whereas free β-catenin was accumulated immediately by this treatment (8Ruel L. Stambolic V. Ali A. Manoukian A.S. Woodgett J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21790-21796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 31Ding V.W. Chen R.H. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32475-32481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In contrast, we documented Akt activation and involvement in Wnt signaling using models characterized by either prolonged or constitutive Wnt stimulation. Our data may suggest that the contribution of Akt is to sustain or enhance, but not initiate, the signaling process. It is still unclear how Akt is activated by a prolonged Wnt stimulus. Recently, integrin-linked kinase was reported to interact with activated Dvl (33Torres M.A. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1144-1433Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar), to phosphorylate Akt (34Yoganathan T.N. Costello P. Chen X. Jabali M. Yan J. Leung D. Zhang Z. Yee A. Dedhar S. Sanghera J.

GA has been used to demonstrate that ·NO production in mesentary arteries and rat aortas depends on Hsp90 activity, implying that factors adversely affecting this interaction between Hsp90 and eNOS may be one of the mechanisms for portal hypertension and increased vascular tone (2Garcia-Cardena G.

Anti-phospho-eNOS (Ser-1177) was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Bovine coronary endothelial cells (BCEC) were provided by William B. Campbell (Milwaukee, WI). BCEC were cultured in RPMI 1640 media containing 20% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, mycotics, rhFGF (10 ng/ml), and heparin (5 units/ml). BCEC were passaged with trypsin-EDTA and used for experiments between passage 5–7. The protocol for the experiments was as follows. For nitrite and O⨪2 studies, l-NMA andl-NAME (1 mm), respectively were added to confluent BCEC cultures at time 0. At 30 min, vehicle (V is dimethyl sulfoxide) or GA (10 μg/ml or 17.8 μm) was added to the BCEC cultures and the l-NAME- or l-NMA-treated BCEC cultures. At 60 min, the four test groups were washed three times with HBSS and then analyzed in separate experiments for nitrite production and release of O⨪2. To examine the role of tetrahydrobiopterin, BCEC cultures were incubated with sepiapterin (100 μm) for 30 min prior to incubation with V, GA, andl-NAME for the O⨪2 protocol. For the co-precipitation studies, substrate analog inhibitors of eNOS were not included in the protocols. After the third wash, V-treated,l-NMA-treated, GA-treated, and GA-l-NMA-treated test cultures in 6-well plates were incubated with 0.75 ml HBSS containing A23187 (5 μm) and l-arginine (25 μm) for 30 min. Nitrite was quantified using Sievers NOA analyzer as described (10Liu J. Garcia-Cardena G. Sessa W.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13277-13281Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Each experiment was performed in triplicate; nitrites were analyzed in duplicate or triplicate, and cell protein for each well was determined in duplicate. After the final HBSS wash, the test groups in 6-well dishes (V, l-NAME, GA, and GA+l-NAME) were incubated with 1 ml of HBSS containing ferricytochrome c (50 μm) and A23187 (5 μm) with and without l-NAME (1 mm) for 30 min. Superoxide anion production was calculated from the absorbance of ferricytochrome c at 550 nm. The release of O⨪2 was calculated from the molar extinction coefficient (ε = 21,000 m−1cm−1). Data were compared with O⨪2 release from independent wells incubated with HBSS containing ferricytochromec and SOD, 1000 units/ml). Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and the cell protein from each well was analyzed in duplicate. Canine carotid arteries were obtained from adult mongrel dogs. The vessel was removed, transferred to a physiologic saline solution and adventitia was cleared. The artery was sectioned into segments at least 2 cm long and placed in RPMI 1640 media. After two washings in RMPI 1640 (to remove adherent blood cells), vessels were placed in organ culture. Artery segments were incubated with V or GA as above, washed free of vehicle and GA, and then incubated with hydroethidine (10 μm) for 30 min. Hydroethidine is taken up by cells and in the presence of O⨪2 is converted to ethidine, which intercalates with nuclear DNA. The degree of fluorescence is proportional to the amount of O⨪2 present (11Carter W.O. Narayanan P.K. Robinson J.P. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1994; 55: 253-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In situ fluorescence was assessed using confocal microscopy. Phospho-eNOS(Ser-1177) and eNOS levels were determined using the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, confluent BCEC cultures in 60-mm dishes were pretreated with GA (10 μg/ml) for 30 min. The cultures were washed three times with HBSS and then stimulated with A23187 (5 μm) in HBSS for 10 min at 37 °C with gentle horizontal rotation (50 rpm). After incubation, the HBSS solutions were removed by aspiration, and cell proteins were harvested in 200 μl of SDS sample buffer. Aliquots (50 μl) were heated (95 °C, 5 min) and stored on ice until loaded (20 μl/lane) on 7% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blotted with anti-phospho-eNOS(Ser-1177) and anti-eNOS (9D10,Zymed Laboratories Inc.) overnight at 4 °C. Bands were visualized using the appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked secondary antibodies and ECL reagents. Co-precipitation studies for determining the interaction of Hsp90 with eNOS were performed on confluent BCEC cultures in 100-mm dishes. The four test groups were V, GA, V+A23187, and GA+A23187. After preincubation with GA, the test groups were washed three times with 5 ml of HBSS and then incubated at 37 °C in a tissue culture incubator in 5 ml of HBSS containing l-arginine (10 μm) with and without A23187 (5 μm). After 10 min, the HBSS solutions were removed, and the cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer as described (2Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). The samples were sonicated two times at a power setting of 1.25–1.5 for 30 s on a Fisher Scientific Dismembrater (Model 550) fitted with an Ultrasonic Convertor (Model No. CL4 with a frequency of 20 kHz) probe. For this procedure it is important to adjust the power settings of the unit to 5–10% of maximum power output because higher power outputs disrupt eNOS interactions with other cell proteins. Cell debris was removed from the cell lysates, and eNOS was immunoprecipitated as described (2Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5–15%) and transblotted onto nitrocellulose. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBS-Tween (0.1%) and then immunoblotted for eNOS and Hsp90 using 9D10 (33-4600, 1:1000) from Zymed Laboratories Inc., and H38220 (1:1000) from Transduction Laboratories, respectively. Bands were visualized with the appropriate anti-immunoglobulin-HRP conjugate from Sigma using ECL reagents and Kodak X-OMAT film. The autoradiograms were imaged with Adobe PhotoShop v5.5 and UMAX Magicscan v4.4 software, and the relative band densities were quantified using NIH Image 1.62. Nitrite and superoxide anion data were examined by one-way analysis of variance to determine whether the variances and means were significantly different. The Newman-Kuel post-hoc test was employed to determine the level of significance between means (p < 0.001 and p< 0.01). Geldanamycin (GA) significantly inhibited A23187-stimulated nitrite production by BCEC cultures incubated in HBSS containing low concentrations of l-arginine (25 μm) (Fig.1 A). In contrast, A23187stimulation of GA-treated BCEC cultures significantly increased the release of O⨪2 compared with vehicle (V)-treated BCEC cultures (Fig. 1 B). l-NAME significantly reduced O⨪2 release from GA-treated cells (Fig. 1 B) but did not inhibit the release of O⨪2 from V-treated cells. These data indicate that when ·NO production is inhibited by GA, eNOS generates O⨪2. These findings are similar to previous studies showing that l-NAME inhibited the release of O⨪2 from endothelial cells incubated with native or oxidized low-density lipoprotein (5Pritchard Jr., K.A. Groszek L. Smalley D.M. Sessa W.C. Wu M. Villalon P. Wolin M.S. Stemerman M.B. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 510-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 6Vergnani L. Hatrik S. Ricci F. Passaro A. Manzoli N. Zuliani G. Brovkovych V. Fellin R. Malinski T. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1261-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). When the production of O⨪2 was assayed on cells that were pretreated with sepiapterin, the effects of GA andl-NAME (Fig. 1 C) were essentially the same as that obtained from non-sepiapterin-treated cells (Fig. 1 B). On the basis that l-NAME is a well recognized substrate analog inhibitor of eNOS and an ineffective agent for blocking relaxation in large vessels from eNOS knock-out mice (12Chataigneau T. Feletou M. Huang P.L. Fishman M.C. Duhault J. Vanhoutte P.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), these data indicate that GA uncouples eNOS to generate O⨪2. In addition, the data from the sepiapterin-treated cultures suggest that GA does not uncouple eNOS activity by limiting BH4. The above observations demonstrate that GA increases the release of O⨪2 by shifting the balance of ·NO and O⨪2 production by eNOS in cultured endothelial cells. To determine whether GA induces similar shifts in oxidant balance in vascular endothelial cellsin situ, the effects of GA on O⨪2 generation by canine carotid arteries were measured. The endothelium of untreated carotid arteries exhibit little to no staining with hydroethidine (Fig.2, left). In contrast, the endothelium of GA-treated carotid arteries exhibit marked increases in ethidine staining (Fig. 2, right). Deeper optical sectioning of the arteries was unable to detect ethidine staining in smooth muscle cells of the vessel wall (data not shown). These data suggest that GA increases vascular O⨪2 generation by an endothelium-dependent mechanism. Serine phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser-1177 (human) and Ser-1179 (bovine) has been shown to correlate directly with increased ·NO production (13Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). Treatment of BCEC cultures with A23187 increased phospho-eNOS(Ser-1179) levels compared with the levels seen in V-treated cultures (Fig. 3 A,top panel). Pretreatment with GA alone increased phospho-eNOS levels (>2.5-fold) compared with V-treated cultures.A23187 stimulation of GA-treated cultures also increased phospho-eNOS. These data indicate that GA increases serine phosphorylation of eNOS, a marker of increased eNOS activity (2Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 14McCabe T.J. Fulton D. Roman L.J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6123-6128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The observation that A23187simultaneously increases l-NAME-inhibitable O⨪2generation and eNOS phosphorylation in GA-treated cultures suggests that when Hsp90 is bound to eNOS in the ADP conformation, enzyme activity is uncoupled. Although the phosphorylation of eNOS stimulated by growth factors or shear stress has been shown to correlate directly with ·NO production (13Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar), if phospho-eNOS levels are detected in the absence of ·NO, perhaps the phosphorylation of eNOS reflects uncoupled eNOS activity and enhanced electron flux in order to generate O⨪2 as was shown previously (14McCabe T.J. Fulton D. Roman L.J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6123-6128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Hsp90 serves many functions within cells (see Ref. 15Csermely P. Schnaider T. Soti C. Prohaszka Z. Nardai G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 79: 129-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar for review). It assists in protein folding by first binding and then changing the conformation of the Hsp90 bound to the client proteins. In this respect, GA has been a useful tool for distinguishing between the steps of association and conformation in protecting enzyme function (16Schneider C. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Nimmesgern E. Ouerfelli O. Danishefsky S. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14536-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). To begin to understand how each step plays a role in preserving eNOS function co-precipitation studies of eNOS were performed on V-treated, V-treated + A23187, GA-treated, and GA-treated + A23187- stimulated test groups. None of these treatments affected eNOS levels (Fig. 3 B, upper panel). Independently GA andA23187 slightly increased the levels of Hsp90 that co-precipitated with eNOS (Fig. 3 B, lower panel, lanes 2 and 3, respectively). In combination however, they markedly increased the amount of Hsp90 that could be co-immunoprecipitated with eNOS (Fig. 3 B, lower panel, lane 4). These observations are consistent with the report showing GA increases Hsp90 binding to heat-denatured luciferase but not necessarily enzyme activity (16Schneider C. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Nimmesgern E. Ouerfelli O. Danishefsky S. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14536-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). On the basis that GA inhibits conformational changes in Hsp90 and changes eNOS product formation from ·NO to O⨪2 we conclude that simply binding Hsp90 to eNOS without the ability to change conformation is insufficient to preserve eNOS-dependent ·NO generation. These data indicate that Hsp90 binding and conformational activity are important for limiting eNOS-dependent O⨪2generation. This study shows that altering the interaction of Hsp90 with eNOS uncouples enzyme activity resulting in increased O⨪2generation. Impaired nitrite production and increasedl-NAME-inhibitable O⨪2 generation byA23187-stimulated, GA-pretreated cultures indicate that Hsp90 modulates eNOS-dependent ·NO and O⨪2 generation. In situ studies reveal that GA increases vascular O⨪2generation in the endothelium but not smooth muscle cells. Such specificity is consistent with the observation that Hsp90 and eNOS are found to co-localize in the endothelium, and that their interaction is critical for mediating vasorelaxation and vascular tone (1Russell K.S. Haynes M.P. Caulin-Glaser T. Rosneck J. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5026-5030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 2Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R.

Sessa W.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G463-8PubMed Google Scholar). Increased phospho-eNOS(Ser-1179) levels in A23187-stimulated cultures pretreated with GA suggest that eNOS-dependent O⨪2generation and ·NO production may share common signaling mechanisms. The marked increase in the amount of Hsp90 that can be co-precipitated with eNOS in A23187-stimulated GA-pretreated cultures indicates that the ability of Hsp90 to change conformation is essential to the mechanisms by which Hsp90 increases ·NO and limits O⨪2production by eNOS. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration where the ATP/ADP state of Hsp90 influences different enzyme activities of a single protein. By measuring the effects of GA on nitrite and O⨪2 production in the absence and presence of well recognized eNOS inhibitors we were able to determine how GA altered eNOS function. What we observed was that when GA decreased A23187-stimulated nitrite production it also increased A23187-stimulated O⨪2 generation by a mechanism that could be inhibited by l-NAME, which is now interpreted as an eNOS-dependent mechanism. In the present study, the finding that A23187 markedly increases phospho-eNOS in GA-treated cultures is entirely consistent with the idea that the flow of electrons through eNOS was increased (14McCabe T.J. Fulton D. Roman L.J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6123-6128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). However when pretreating with GA, the increase in electron flow resulted in increased O⨪2 generation by an activated eNOS. Superoxide anion can be generated by eNOS at either the NADPH reductase domain or the arginine oxidase domain (8Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Martasek P. Hogg N. Masters B.S.S. Karoui H. Tordo P.

Xenobiotics such as paraquat, lucigenin, and adriamycin as well as excess FAD and FMN increase O⨪2 generation via redox-cycling with the NADPH reductase domain of eNOS (8Vasquez-Vivar J.

A. 1999; 96: 12760-12765Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). “Uncoupled” eNOS activity develops when eNOS fails to “couple” activated oxygen to arginine metabolism. When this happens, the activated oxygen is released from the heme site as O⨪2 (21Fukuto J.M. Mayer B. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, New York1996: 145-160Google Scholar). eNOS-dependent O⨪2 generation from the arginine oxygenase domain has been observed under conditions of limited l-arginine availability, oxidation or depletion of tetrahydrobiopterin, and activation of protein kinase C (6Vergnani L.

To determine whether GA increased eNOS-dependent O⨪2 generation by a BH4-dependent mechanism BCEC cultures were incubated with sepiapterin, which is rapidly converted to BH4 by the salvage pathway (24Gross S.S. Jaffe E.A. Levi R. Kilbourn R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 823-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, GA increased A23187-stimulated O⨪2generation and more importantly l-NAME decreased the release of O⨪2 to the same extent as they did in the non-sepiapterin-treated cultures. These data suggest that mechanisms targeting Hsp90 activity may be distinct from the mechanisms by which a loss in BH4 increases eNOS-dependent O⨪2 generation (25Verhaar M.C. Wever R.M. Kastelein J.J. van Dam T. Koomans H.A. Rabelink T.J. Circulation. 1998; 97: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 26Chen P.F. Berka V. Tsai A.L. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34164-34170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). On the basis that GA is a specific inhibitor of Hsp90 activity and BH4 supplementation did not inhibit the effects of GA on eNOS-dependent O⨪2 generation, we hypothesize that the way Hsp90 interacts with eNOS plays an important role in mediating the balance of ·NO and O⨪2 generation by eNOS. What these data seem to indicate is that when high levels of phospho-eNOS are detected in cells or tissues that generate low concentrations of ·NO, citrulline or cGMP eNOS activity may be uncoupled. On the basis of known stoichiometry for arginine metabolism by NOS (27Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) it is clear that for each ·NO made by coupled activity, two molecules of O⨪2 can be generated by uncoupled activity (21Fukuto J.M. Mayer B. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, New York1996: 145-160Google Scholar). The ability of an enzyme to generate vasoactive radicals with opposing physiological properties may actually be an advantage in that mechanisms mediating vasorelaxation and vasoconstriction could be integrated into a single control point. The importance of uncoupled eNOS activity to vascular physiology remains unclear at this time. Future studies aimed at understanding how vasoactive agents alter Hsp90 activity in relation to eNOS generation of ·NO and O⨪2 are required to determine the extent to which such a mechanism plays a role in vasorelaxation and vascular tone (1Russell K.S. Haynes M.P. Caulin-Glaser T. Rosneck J. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5026-5030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In conclusion, Hsp90 modulates eNOS product formation. When Hsp90 is bound to eNOS and can change conformation, eNOS generates ·NO upon stimulation. When Hsp90 is bound to eNOS and conformational changes are restricted or impaired, eNOS generates O⨪2 upon stimulation. Thus, Hsp90 modulation of eNOS production formation may play an important role in vascular physiology as well as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and diabetes. Such observations begin to explain some of the hypertensive and anti-angiogenic effects of inhibiting Hsp90 activity. We thank Drs. Keith T.

By using a chondrogenic cell line, ATDC5, we investigated the TGF-β-mediated signaling pathways involved in expression of the aggrecan gene (Agc). At confluency, TGF-β induced Agcexpression within 3 h, and cycloheximide blocked this induction, indicating that de novo protein synthesis is essential for this response. At this stage, TGF-β induced rapid, transient phosphorylation of Smad2, extracellular signal-activated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Inhibition of the Smad pathways by transfection with a dominant negative Smad4 construct significantly reduced TGF-β-induced Agcexpression, indicating that Smad signaling is essential for this response. Furthermore, an inhibitor of the ERK1/2 pathway, U0126, or inhibitors of the p38 MAPK pathway, SB203580 and SKF86002, repressed TGF-β-induced Agc expression in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that ERK1/2 or p38 MAPK activation is also required for TGF-β-induced Agcexpression in confluent ATDC5 cells. In differentiated ATDC5 cells, persistently high basal levels of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK phosphorylation correlated with elevated basal Agc expression, which was inhibited by incubation with inhibitors of these pathways. Whereas Smad2 was rapidly phosphorylated by TGF-β and involved in the initial activation of Agc expression in confluent cells, Smad2 activation was not required for maintaining the high level ofAgc expression. Taken together, these results suggest an important role for transcriptional cross-talk between Smad and MAPK pathways in expression of early chondrocytic phenotypes and identify important changes in the regulation of Agc expression following chondrocyte differentiation.

Cell Res. 1998; 241: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), have been implicated in this differentiation process. During differentiation, chondrocytes secrete extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules characteristic of cartilage, such as type II collagen, aggrecan, and link protein, providing an environment that maintains the chondrocyte phenotype. Thus, chondrocytes are defined both by their morphology and capacity to synthesize these characteristic ECM molecules. Among the ECM molecules, aggrecan is a major proteoglycan of cartilage (13Watanabe H. Yamada Y. Kimata K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 124: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and its deposition corresponds well with Alcian blue staining, which is commonly used for identification of cartilage. Although low levels are detected in the heart (14Zanin M.K. Bundy J. Ernst H. Wessels A. Conway S.J. Hoffman S. Anat. Rec. 1999; 256: 366-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and brain (15Schwartz N.B. Domowicz M. Krueger Jr., R.C. Li H. Mangoura D. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1996; 3: 291-306PubMed Google Scholar), aggrecan is largely restricted to cartilage, and it contributes to water retention, resistance to deformation, and the gel-like property of the cartilage. Aggrecan-null mice develop perinatal lethal dwarfism with little ECM in cartilage and defective chondrocyte differentiation, indicating critical roles of aggrecan in cartilage development (16Watanabe H. Kimata K. Line S. Strong D. Gao L.Y. Kozak C.A. Yamada Y. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Therefore, aggrecan serves as a good marker for differentiated chondrocytes. A number of in vitro studies have been performed using primary chondrocytes and chondrogenic cell lines, such as CFK 2 (17Bernier S.M. Goltzman D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), ATDC5 (12Shukunami C. Ohta Y. Sakuda M. Hiraki Y. Exp.

Among them, ATDC5 cells are a well characterized chondrogenic cell line derived from mouse teratocarcinoma. In culture, these cells mimic the multistep process of chondrocyte differentiation. After plating, they proliferate until confluency, at which point they undergo growth arrest following contact inhibition. After 4 days, these cells undergo a phenotypic change characterized by the secretion of a variety of ECM molecules, such as type II collagen, aggrecan, and link protein, and by the formation of cartilaginous nodules on the culture plate (12Shukunami C. Ohta Y. Sakuda M. Hiraki Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 18Atsumi T. Miwa Y. Kimata K. Ikawa Y. Cell Differ.

Cell Res. 1998; 241: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and growth/differentiation factor-5 (GDF-5, also known as cartilage-derived morphogenetic protein-1, CDMP-1) (23Nakamura K. Shirai T. Morishita S. Uchida S. Saeki-Miura K. Makishima F. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) rapidly induce type II collagen expression in confluent ATDC5 cells, suggesting critical roles of signaling by the TGF-β superfamily for chondrocyte-specific gene expression. Receptor complexes of the TGF-β superfamily consist of a ligand-binding type II receptor serine-threonine kinase that, following ligand binding, binds to and transphosphorylates the signal transducing type I serine-threonine kinase (24Massague J. Cell. 1996; 85: 947-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). These receptors, in turn, activate, through a phosphorylation event, members of a family of downstream signaling intermediates, the Smads (25Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3301) Google Scholar). Within this family of proteins, the receptor-activated Smads, R-Smads, are the direct substrates for the activated type I serine-threonine kinase and are phosphorylated on a conserved C-terminal -SSXS motif. Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 are phosphorylated following activation of type I bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptors, whereas Smad2 and Smad3 are activated by the type I TGF-β and activin receptors (25Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3301) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated R-Smads then form heteromeric complexes with the common Smad mediator, Smad4, which is then translocated to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, these Smad complexes function as transcriptional activators, binding to specific cis-acting elements in Smad-dependent promoters (26Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13690-13696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), serving both to stabilize the Smad-transcription factor complex (44Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massague J.

Although the Smad pathway is widely represented in most of the cell types and tissues studied, additional pathways may be activated following treatment with TGF-β in specific contexts. For example, activation of Ras, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) by TGF-β signaling has been reported in primary intestinal epithelial cells and some breast cancer cell lines (46Hartsough M.T.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 628-633PubMed Google Scholar), whereas activation of protein kinase A contributes to TGF-β-signaling responses in murine mesangial cells (48Wang L. Zhu Y. Sharma K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8522-8527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition, TGF-β-activated kinase-1 (TAK1), a member of the MEKK family and activator of JNK and p38 MAPK pathways (14Zanin M.K. Bundy J. Ernst H. Wessels A. Conway S.J. Hoffman S. Anat. Rec. 1999; 256: 366-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 49Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar), is rapidly activated by TGF-β in certain cell systems, notably in murine C2C12 myocytes (50Hanafusa H. Ninomiya-Tsuji J.

The relative contribution of these different pathways in chondrocytic responses to TGF-β is poorly understood. The aim of our study is to define the contribution of specific TGF-β-dependent signaling pathways involved in the regulation of chondrocyte differentiation. In particular, we have focused on the regulation of aggrecan gene (Agc) expression as a unique marker gene that is characteristic of the chondrocyte phenotype. In this paper, we demonstrate that TGF-β rapidly induces Agc expression in ATDC5 cells and that this response requires TGF-β-induced activation of both R-Smad2/4 complexes as well as p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 pathways. In contrast, following differentiation, high levels of Agcexpression are maintained without activation of R-Smad2 but are associated with, and require, persistently high basal activation of p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 pathways. These findings suggest that there are distinct transcriptional cross-talk mechanisms regulatingAgc expression in differentiating chondrocytes, and they provide new insights into the regulatory mechanisms defining chondrocytic phenotypes. ATDC5 cells (18Atsumi T. Miwa Y. Kimata K. Ikawa Y. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 30: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and 10 μg/ml insulin, 10 μg/ml transferrin, and 10 μg selenium (ITS) (Biofluids, Inc) at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cells were maintained at 20–80% confluency, replacing media every other day. For inhibition of protein synthesis, a concentration of 5 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX, Sigma), which blocks 95% of protein synthesis without cell toxicity, was added to culture media at the indicated times. Cells at 50–60% confluency were transfected with DNA constructs using FuGeneTM 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Transfection efficiency was monitored using a constitutively expressed GFP expression vector under the control of the EF1 promoter, pCEFL-GFP (a gift from J. S. Gutkind), confirming that ∼65% of the transfected cells expressed GFP under fluorescence microscopy. For dominant inhibitory experiments of the Smad pathway, cells were cotransfected with the following: 0.25 μg of p3TP-Lux, which is a TGF-β-responsive reporter containing three 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive elements and a small TGF-β-responsive element from the plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 promoter (51Wrana J.L.

Twenty four hours after transfection, when cells reached confluency, the culture medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing ITS and 0.2% fetal bovine serum. After 12 h, cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TGF-β2 (R & D Systems) for 16 h and were lysed. Luciferase activity of cell lysate was assayed with the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) using a microtiter plate luminometer (Dynex). For inhibition studies, U0126 (Promega), SB203580, and SKF86002 (Calbiochem) were used at the concentrations indicated and were added 1 h before TGF-β (10 ng/ml) treatment. U0126 is a specific inhibitor of an upstream molecule, MEK1/2, that activates ERK1/2 (52Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A.

Concentrations of 20–50 μm showed optimal inhibition of p38 MAPK activity without cytotoxicity. Because of the relatively short half-life of SB203580 and SKF86002, these compounds were added to the media every 4 h during the course of the assay. Gal4-Smad experiments were performed as reported elsewhere (45de Caestecker M.P. Yahata T. Wang D. Parks W.T. Huang S. Hill C.S. Shioda T. Roberts A.B. Lechleider R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2115-2122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were similarly transfected with 1 μg of p147-Gal4-Smad2 or -Smad4 (266), coupled with 1 μg of Gal4-Luc (56Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Pallante M. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4289-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and 0.1 μg of pRLSV40 (Promega). Gal4-VP-16 was also used as an independent transactivator for a control. After 24 h, inhibitors were added under serum-starved conditions. After 1 h, cells were treated with TGF-β. Cells were collected after 16 h, and cell lysate was similarly subjected to the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK was determined with corresponding PhosphoPlus AntibodyTM kits (New England Biolabs), respectively. Briefly, a pair of immunoblot analyses was performed with phosphospecific antibodies or antibodies to detect the proteins themselves. For Smad2 phosphorylation, anti-phospho-Smad2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), which detects the C-terminal phosphorylated form of Smad2, and anti-total Smad2 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were used. For ERK1/2 and Smad2 phosphorylation, cells were starved for 16 h to decrease basal phosphorylation levels. After treatment with TGF-β for the time indicated, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected, and cell lysate was subjected to a SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under a reducing condition, followed by immunoblotting. For the inhibition studies, optimized concentrations of U0126, SB203580, and SKF86002 were added 1 h prior to TGF-β treatment. An inhibitor of protein kinase A, H-89, was used at concentrations of 10 μm as a negative control. ERK1/2 assay was carried out using p44/42 MAP kinase assay kit (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For p38 MAPK activity, p38 MAP kinase assay kit (New England Biolabs) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Confluent cells were serum-starved for 16 h, pretreated with U0126 (10 μm) or SB203580 (20 μm) for 1 h, and treated with TGF-β (10 ng/ml) for 1 h. Then cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100, and incubated with an anti-Smad2/3 antibody (Transduction Laboratories) overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with Alexa FluorTM 488 (Molecular Probes) secondary antibody. Cells were then visualized with immunofluorescence microscopy (Nikon). The percentage of cells with Smad2/3 staining in the nucleus was determined by observing 100 cells. For analysis of Agctranscription, cells were cultured for 12 h in a culture medium containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum and were treated with TGF-β at a concentration of 10 ng/ml for 12 h, unless otherwise indicated. Poly(A) RNA was prepared from cells using the Micro-Fast TrackTM kit (Invitrogen). This mRNA (200–600 ng) was reverse-transcribed to generate cDNA using the Superscript PreamplificationTM System (Life Technologies, Inc.). For semiquantitative analysis of Agc expression, PCR was performed using a set of primers, 5′-TGGAGCATGCTAGAACCCTCG-3′ and 5′-GCGACAAGAAGACACCATGTG-3′. After confirmation of the Agctranscript, real time quantitative PCR was performed using the TaqManTM 7700 (PE Applied Biosystems). Sequences for a probe and a set of primers were chosen by the Primer ExpressTM program as follows: 5′-CCCTGGGCAGCGTGATCCTCAC-3′ for a probe, 5′-CTGCCCTTGCCCCGTA-3′ for a forward primer, and 5′-GACAGGTCAAAGATGGGCTTTG-3′ for a reverse primer. The probe was labeled with fluorescent reporter dyes 6-carboxyfluorescein and 6-carboxy-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylrhodamine at 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. As an internal control, a set of primers and a probe of rodent GAPDH labeled with VICTM (PE Applied Biosystems) were used according to the manufacturer's protocol. In confluent ATDC5 cells, RT-PCR analysis revealed induction of Agc transcription as early as 3 h after the treatment with TGF-β (Fig.1 A). These data were confirmed by direct measurement of the transcript levels of Agc by a real time quantitative RT-PCR assay. By using this assay, the fold induction of Agc mRNA by TGF-β was 4.1 ± 0.38, 10.22 ± 2.75, 22.3 ± 9.1, and 59.6 ± 0.5 for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h, respectively, where 0 h was 1.0 ± 0.03 (mean ± S.D., n = 3, Fig. 1 B). Without TGF-β, Agc expression after 24 h was 5.35 ± 0.41 that of 0 h. Next, we used CHX to examine whether protein synthesis was required forAgc induction. Pretreatment with CHX 30 min before TGF-β addition completely blocked transcription of Agc. When CHX was added 2 h after TGF-β treatment, Agctranscription was observed (Fig. 1 C). These results indicate that protein synthesis initiated within 2 h of treatment with TGF-β is required for Agc expression and suggest that this expression requires induction of an immediate early response gene (IEG) to a TGF-β-dependent signal. To determine the nature of this signaling response, we examined a number of pathways previously shown to be activated by TGF-β in different cell systems. First, we examined if Smads are involved inAgc expression. As shown in Fig.2 A, using phospho-Smad2-specific antibodies, Smad2 was rapidly phosphorylated within 5 min of treatment with TGF-β and persisted for 4 h. We next examined the functional significance of this Smad pathway activated by TGF-β in regulating Agc expression by using a dominant negative (DN−) Smad4 construct, Smad4-(Δ275–322), which has previously been shown to inhibit TGF-β-dependent transcriptional responses in a number of different cell types and reporter systems (45de Caestecker M.P.

P. de Caestecker, unpublished data. When the cells reached confluency after 24 h of transfection, cells were starved for 12 h and treated with TGF-β for an additional 12 h. The expression of p3TP-lux reporter gene was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximal inhibition of 65%, confirming down-regulation of the Smad pathway by DN-Smad4 construct (Fig. 2 B). Under the same conditions, this dominant negative construct inhibited TGF-β-mediated Agc expression as determined by real time RT-PCR, by ∼65% (Fig. 2 C). In parallel experiments, transfection efficiency of 65 ± 10% (mean ± S.D.) was obtained using the GFP expression construct, suggesting that the DN-Smad4 construct strongly inhibits TGF-β signaling in the transfected cells. These results indicate involvement of the Smad pathway in Agc expression. We next examined the effects of TGF-β on activation of ERK1/2, SAPK/JNK, and p38 MAPK in confluent ATDC5 cells. TGF-β increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 5–10 times that of the basal level. The increased phosphorylation appeared as early as 5 min, reached the peak at 15–30 min, and was sustained until 1 h after TGF-β treatment (Fig. 3 A). Correlation between phosphorylation and activation of ERK1/2 was confirmed by an ERK1/2 assay system using Elk1 as a substrate (Fig.3 A, lower panel, at 15 min). Immunoblot analysis using anti-phospho-p38 showed negligible basal levels of phospho-p38 MAPK, and TGF-β dramatically phosphorylated p38 MAPK, although compared with ERK1/2 phosphorylation, phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was delayed (Fig. 3 B). JNK was not phosphorylated or activated by TGF-β, indicating that this pathway is not involved in TGF-β signaling in these cells (data not shown). Next, we used a number of known specific inhibitors of the MAPK pathways to determine the functional significance of TGF-β"

LNCaP cells lack active lipid phosphatase PTEN, a negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase/Akt pathway, and demonstrate a high constitutive Akt activity. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase using wortmannin and LY-294002 suppressed constitutive Akt activity and sensitized LNCaP cells to TRAIL. Treatment of LNCaP cells with TRAIL alone induced cleavage of the caspase 8 and XIAP proteins. However, processing of BID, mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, activation of caspases 7 and 9, and apoptosis did not occur unless TRAIL was combined with either wortmannin, LY-294002, or cycloheximide. Blocking cytochromec release by Bcl-2 overexpression rendered LNCaP cells resistant to TRAIL plus wortmannin treatment but did not affect caspase 8 or BID processing. This indicates that in these cells mitochondria are required for the propagation rather than the initiation of the apoptotic cascade. Infection of LNCaP cells with an adenovirus expressing a constitutively active Akt reversed the ability of wortmannin to potentiate TRAIL-induced BID cleavage. Thus, the PI 3-kinase-dependent blockage of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells appears to be mediated by Akt through the inhibition of BID cleavage.

Although the majority of normal human cells tested so far appear to be TRAIL-resistant, recent experiments have demonstrated that cultured human liver cells may be sensitive to TRAIL (14Jo M.

These findings suggest either defects in apoptotic pathways or the presence of inhibitors of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The latter possibility appears to be more likely, since the resistance of many types of cancer cells to TRAIL can be reversed by treatment with protein synthesis inhibitors (15Griffith T.S. Chin W.A.

The elucidation of mechanisms that control sensitivity to TRAIL may lead to better understanding of death receptor-mediated signaling and help to develop TRAIL-based approaches to cancer treatment.Activation of death receptors leads to the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC)1 (21Kischkel F.C.

The recruitment of caspase 8 to TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5 is thought to be mediated by the adaptor protein FADD (23Chaudhary P.M. Eby M. Jasmin A. Bookwalter A. Murray J. Hood L.

Activated caspase 8 may also cleave a proapoptotic protein BID, whose cleavage product triggers cytochromec release from mitochondria (28Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3765) Google Scholar). In some but not all cell types, the mitochondrial step may be required to amplify the apoptotic signal and fully activate caspase 8 (30Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F.

Since the TRAIL-induced apoptotic signal is a multistep process, inhibition of this cascade may occur at several stages. For example, at the ligand-receptor level, TRAIL signaling could be inhibited by the overexpression of nonfunctional TRAIL receptors DcR1 or DcR2 (31Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar) or by proteins that induce rapid internalization of TRAIL receptors (similar to Fas inhibition the adenoviral protein E3) (32Tollefson A.E. Hermiston T.W. Lichtenstein D.L. Colle C.F. Tripp R.A. Dimitrov T. Toth K. Wells C.E. Doherty P.C. Wold W.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). At the DISC, the apoptotic pathway may be inhibited by cFLIP protein that is capable of blocking processing and activation of caspase 8 (33Kataoka T. Schroter M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Irmler M.

Downstream of DISC, IAP proteins may specifically inhibit the executor caspases 3 and 7 (35Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2263) Google Scholar). In those cells that require mitochondria to stimulate apoptosis, the signal may be inhibited by Bcl-2/Bcl-XLtypes of proteins that prevent the release of proapoptotic factors from the mitochondria (30Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar).In the present study, we tested the cytotoxic effects of TRAIL on six human prostate cancer cell lines, demonstrating variable responses, with some cell lines being extremely sensitive and others highly resistant. The highly resistant cell line LNCaP was further investigated to examine mechanisms that protect it from TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. We find that the TRAIL-induced death signal in LNCaP cells is negatively regulated by a high constitutive activity of protein kinase Akt. Furthermore, the antiapoptotic block occurs downstream of caspase 8 activation at the level of BID protein cleavage. This study is the first demonstration that the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway may interfere with an apoptotic signal by inhibiting processing of BID.DISCUSSIONWe have developed a novel approach to obtaining preparative amounts of proapoptotic ligand TRAIL and tested the effects of this reagent on a panel of six prostate cancer cell lines. Soluble TRAIL was produced by a methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris, secreted into the medium, and then purified to homogeneity by one-step chromatography on a nickel-chelate column. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that three cell lines, ALVA-31, DU 145, and PC-3, were very sensitive to TRAIL, while in comparison JCA-1 and TSU-Pr1 revealed moderate sensitivity, and LNCaP cells were resistant to as high as 4 μg/ml TRAIL. Comparing these results with the data published on Fas ligand-induced apoptosis indicates that prostate cancer cells differ in their responses to these two apoptotic stimuli. Whereas cells believed to be derived from primary prostate cancer tumors (ALVA-31 and JCA-1) were reported to be sensitive to Fas ligand-induced apoptosis, cells originating from distant metastasis (DU 145, PC-3, TSU-Pr1, and LNCaP) appeared to be Fas-resistant despite the expression of Fas antigen on the cell surface (36Hedlund T.E. Duke R.C. Schleicher M.S. Miller G.J. Prostate. 1998; 36: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 54Uslu R. Borsellino N. Frost P. Garban H. Ng C.P. Mizutani Y. Belldegrun A. Bonavida B. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 963-972PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, among the above listed cell lines, only LNCaP cells were resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, indicating that TRAIL has a greater potential as an agent to treat metastatic prostate cancer. These data also suggest that despite the similarity of CD95/Fas and TRAIL receptors, TRAIL and Fas ligand-mediated apoptosis may employ different signal transduction pathways or be negatively regulated by different mechanisms in these prostate cancer cells.We found that among six prostate cancer cell lines examined, the LNCaP cells, which are the most highly resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, have the highest constitutive activity of the Akt protein kinase. This result is consistent with the lack of the functional tumor suppressor PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway in these cells (42Vlietstra R.J. van Alewijk D.C. Hermans K.G. van Steenbrugge G.J. Trapman J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2720-2723PubMed Google Scholar). Because the Akt protein kinase is known to block apoptosis (55Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar), we tested whether inhibition of this pathway affects the sensitivity of LNCaP cells to TRAIL. We found that treatment with the PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY-294002 or the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide renders them sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Thus, the resistance of LNCaP cells to TRAIL results not from defects in apoptotic machinery, but from PI 3-kinase-dependent inhibition of the TRAIL-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway.It has been reported that apoptosis induced by triggering of CD95/Fas (56Hausler P. Papoff G. Eramo A. Reif K. Cantrell D.A. Ruberti G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 57Rohn J.L. Hueber A.O. McCarthy N.J. Lyon D. Navarro P. Burgering B.M. Evan G.I. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2811-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) is counteracted by the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway, but the molecular mechanisms that cause apoptosis resistance remain unclear. To identify which step of the TRAIL-mediated apoptotic pathway is blocked in LNCaP cells, we first tested whether the release of proapoptotic factors from mitochondria is essential for TRAIL-induced death of these cells. The involvement of mitochondria in apoptosis induced by death receptors remains controversial. Scaffidi et al. (30Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar) have proposed that two types of cells exist that differ with respect to their requirement for mitochondria during Fas-mediated apoptosis. In type I cells, caspase 8 is activated without involvement of mitochondria to a level sufficient to process the effector caspase 3. In contrast, in type II cells a mitochondria-dependent amplification loop is required to fully activate caspase 8 and transduce an apoptotic signal. This model has recently been questioned by Huang et al. (58Huang D.C. Hahne M. Schroeter M. Frei K. Fontana A. Villunger A. Newton K. Tschopp J. Strasser A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14871-14876Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), who argue that the difference between type I and type II cells is an artifact of using agonistic anti-Fas antibodies to trigger Fas signaling instead of Fas ligand. To clarify the role of mitochondria in TRAIL-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells, we used Bcl-2-overexpressing LNCaP cells, which were shown to exhibit an impaired cytochrome c release in response to various apoptotic stimuli (37Raffo A.J. Perlman H. Chen M.W. Day M.L. Streitman J.S. Buttyan R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4438-4445PubMed Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that these cells are much more resistant to TRAIL plus wortmannin-induced apoptosis compared with the parental cells. In these experiments, apoptosis was triggered by soluble death receptor ligand and not agonistic antibody, supporting the notion that in some cells mitochondrial function is indeed essential for death receptor-mediated apoptosis.Using a cell fractionation approach, we have found that TRAIL-induced cytochrome c release was blocked in LNCaP cells, but both wortmannin and cycloheximide are capable of overcoming this block. Release of mitochondrial cytochrome c by death receptors is triggered by a multistep mechanism. The formation of the DISC results in autoprocessing and activation of the initiator caspase 8 followed by cleavage of the proapoptotic protein BID (28Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3061) Google Scholar, 29Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3765) Google Scholar). A proteolytic fragment of BID translocates to the mitochondria as an integral membrane protein and triggers the release of mitochondrial cytochromec (59Gross A. Yin X.M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J. Milliman C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1156-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Using immunoblot analysis, we found that cleavage of caspase 8 and one of its substrates, the antiapoptotic protein XIAP (51Deveraux Q.L. Leo E. Stennicke H.R. Welsh K. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5242-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar) were induced by TRAIL alone as efficiently as when TRAIL was combined with either wortmannin or cycloheximide. This important result indicates that DISC formation or caspase 8 activation was not blocked in LNCaP cells. In contrast, wortmannin and cycloheximide were required for TRAIL-induced cleavage of BID, the release of cytochromec, and processing of caspases 9 and 7. Thus, the PI 3-kinase-dependent block of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells occurs at the level of BID cleavage.The requirement for mitochondrial apoptogenic activity in TRAIL-induced death suggests that LNCaP cells are similar to type II cells. If so, the lack of BID cleavage could, in principle, be explained by the disruption of a mitochondria-dependent amplification loop, resulting in only partial activation of caspase 8. To see whether this hypothesis could be true, we compared the cleavage of BID and caspase 8 in Bcl-2-overexpressing versus parental LNCaP cells and found that these proteins are processed equally well in both cell lines. These results demonstrate that although mitochondrial function is important for TRAIL-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells, unlike “typical” type II cells mitochondria are required not to amplify caspase 8 activation but to transduce apoptotic signal downstream of the initiator caspase. Therefore, it may be possible to classify LNCaP as type III cells where mitochondria are involved in the propagation rather than the initiation of the apoptotic cascade.Involvement of PI 3-kinase in the block of apoptosis suggests that Akt could mediate resistance of LNCaP cells to TRAIL. To confirm this hypothesis, we tested whether overexpression of constitutively active Akt could inhibit the proapoptotic effect of TRAIL plus wortmannin treatment. For this purpose, we used a myristoylated derivative of Akt, which exhibits kinase activity independently of PI 3-kinase (60Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Both apoptosis (data not shown) and BID cleavage induced by treatment of LNCaP cells with TRAIL plus wortmannin were inhibited by overexpression of myristoylated Akt, indicating that resistance of LNCaP cells to TRAIL is, at least in part, mediated by Akt.It has been documented that Akt may inhibit a variety of apoptotic stimuli in multiple ways (55Datta S.R.

Burgering B.M. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 656-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Inhibition of BID cleavage has not been previously reported as a mechanism through which PI 3-kinase and Akt block apoptotic signals.Although it remains unclear how the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway mediates inhibition of BID cleavage, our data suggest an indirect mechanism. First, inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide affected the same step of TRAIL apoptotic cascade as the inhibition of PI 3-kinase. However, even very high levels of constitutively active Akt did not rescue BID from cleavage when TRAIL was combined with cycloheximide rather than wortmannin. These results suggest that a short lived protein is involved in the PI 3-kinase/Akt-mediated blockage of BID cleavage, and the synthesis of this hypothetical protein may be triggered by Akt. Second, the effect of myristoylated Akt appears to be cell type-specific, since its overexpression did not rescue HeLa, DU-145, or A498 cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis (data not shown) but did rescue LNCaP and ALVA-31 cells. This could reflect either the difference in apoptotic pathways employed by different cell types or the absence of certain factors required for the protective effect of Akt. In particular, human prostate cancer cell lines have scores of chromosomal deletions and rearrangements (64Webber M.M. Bello D. Quader S. Prostate. 1997; 30: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), so that LNCaP and PC-3 differ in much more than Akt levels.It has been reported that short term (3–7-h) treatment of human keratinocytes (52Leverkus M. Neumann M. Mengling T. Rauch C.T. Brocker E.B. Krammer P.H. Walczak H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 553-559PubMed Google Scholar), HeLa and Kym-1 cells (19Wajant H. Haas E. Schwenzer R. Muhlenbeck F.

Since upon overexpression cFLIP is capable of inhibiting Fas-mediated apoptosis (33Kataoka T. Schroter M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Irmler M. Thome M. Froelich C.J. Tschopp J. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1541-1548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that protein synthesis inhibitors sensitize cells to TRAIL by down-regulating cFLIP. To examine this hypothesis, we tested the level of various splice variants of cFLIP (FLIPL, FLIPγ, and FLIPδ) in LNCaP cells and found that neither cycloheximide nor wortmannin treatment affected cFLIP levels after as long as 16 h of treatment. These data are consistent with our observation on renal carcinoma cells (65Pawlowski J.E. Nesterov A. Scheinman R.I. Johnson T.R. Kraft A.S. Anticancer Res. 2001; 20: 4243-4256Google Scholar) and published results on Kaposi's sarcoma cells (17Mori S. Murakami-Mori K. Nakamura S. Ashkenazi A. Bonavida B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5616-5623PubMed Google Scholar) in which that inhibition of protein synthesis sensitized cells to TRAIL without affecting the expression of cFLIP proteins. Thus, mediators of the PI 3-kinase-dependent blockage of TRAIL-induced BID cleavage and apoptosis in LNCaP cells still await identification and characterization.

https://openalex.org/W1995290986,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of expression of a subclass of adipocyte genes and to serve as the molecular target of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) and certain non-TZD antidiabetic agents. Hypercorticosteroidism leads to insulin resistance, a variety of metabolic dysfunctions typically seen in diabetes, and hypertrophy of visceral adipose tissue. In adipocytes, the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD-1) converts inactive cortisone into the active glucocorticoid cortisol and thereby plays an important role in regulating the actions of corticosteroids in adipose tissue. Here, we show that both TZD and non-TZD PPARγ agonists markedly reduced 11β-HSD-1 gene expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. This diminution correlated with a significant decrease in the ability of the adipocytes to convert cortisone to cortisol. The half-maximal inhibition of 11β-HSD-1 mRNA expression by the TZD, rosiglitazone, occurred at a concentration that was similar to its Kd for binding PPARγ and EC50 for inducing adipocyte differentiation thereby indicating that this action was PPARγ-dependent. The time required for the inhibitory action of the TZD was markedly greater for 11β-HSD-1 gene expression than for leptin, suggesting that these genes may be down-regulated by different molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, whereas regulation of PPARγ-inducible genes such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was maintained when cellular protein synthesis was abrogated, PPARγ agonist inhibition of 11β-HSD-1 and leptin gene expression was ablated, thereby supporting the conclusion that PPARγ affects the down-regulation of 11β-HSD-1 indirectly. Finally, treatment of diabetic db/db mice with rosiglitazone inhibited expression of 11β-HSD-1 in adipose tissue. This decrease in enzyme expression correlated with a significant decline in plasma corticosterone levels. In sum, these data indicate that some of the beneficial effects of PPARγ antidiabetic agents may result, at least in part, from the down-regulation of 11β-HSD-1 expression in adipose tissue.

Obesity has been shown to be a major risk factor in the development of a group of maladies, including insulin resistance, noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), 1The abbreviations used are:NIDDMnoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitusPPARγperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γTZDthiazolidinedione11β-HSD-111β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1PPREsperoxisome proliferator response elementsPEPCKphosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinasePCRpolymerase chain reaction hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, that results in premature mortality. In particular, a number of epidemiological studies have suggested that for a given body mass index, central obesity (visceral or omental), as opposed to general obesity, is highly associated with these disorders that are collectively known as “Syndrome X” or the “Metabolic Syndrome” (1Bjorntorp P.

Adipose tissue can increase in mass by the hypertrophy of existing adipocytes and/or by the adipogenic differentiation of preadipocytes. Two nuclear receptors, the glucocorticoid receptor and PPARγ, and their ligands play important roles in adipocyte differentiation and metabolism (4Lowell B.B.

Patients suffering from hypercorticosteroidism due to Cushing's syndrome or those undergoing corticosteroid therapy demonstrate specific increases in visceral adiposity (8Rebuffe-Scrive M.

In addition, they suffer metabolic and signal transduction disturbances mirroring those observed in NIDDM, including insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia (10Peeke P.M. Chrousos G.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 771: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Corticosteroid activity is regulated, in part, by the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD) that exists as two isozymes (as reviewed in Ref. 11Stewart P.M. Krozowski Z.S. Vitam. Horm. 1999; 57: 249-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). 11β-HSD-1 is predominantly expressed in adipose, liver, gonadal, and central nervous system tissue where it mainly serves as a reductase that converts inactive cortisone to the active glucocorticoid receptor agonist cortisol. 11β-HSD-2 is expressed primarily in aldosterone target cells such as kidney and colon where it inactivates cortisol via its dehydrogenase activity, thereby preventing excessive activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor and sequelae that include hypertension. It has recently been shown that omental adipose tissue contains significantly more 11β-HSD-1 activity than subcutaneous adipose tissue and that preadipocytes from the former tissue can be more readily differentiated into adipocytes by cortisone than those from the latter tissue (12Bujalska I.J. Kumar S. Stewart P.M. Lancet. 1997; 349: 1210-1213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggested that the effect of glucocorticoids on body fat distribution may be regulated locally through the metabolism of glucocorticoids within adipose tissue itself (12Bujalska I.J. Kumar S. Stewart P.M. Lancet. 1997; 349: 1210-1213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Furthermore, 11β-HSD-1 knockout mice have been shown to resist diet-induced insulin resistance and hyperglycemia (13Kotelevtsev Y. Holmes M.C. Burchell A. Houston P.M. Schmoll D. Jamieson P. Best R.

Such observations have led to the suggestion that 11β-HSD-1 may play a key role in the dysregulation of metabolism observed in NIDDM and other metabolic disorders linked to central obesity (14Andrews R.C. Walker B.R. Clin. Sci. ( Lond. ). 1999; 96: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are a subclass of the nuclear receptor gene family that serves as ligand-regulated transcription factors. Three PPAR isoforms have been identified and shown to be encoded by separate genes (15Schoonjans K. Marin G. Staels B. Auwerx J. Curr. Opin.

PPARγ exists as two isoforms, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2, due to alternative promoter usage and differential RNA splicing (24Tontonoz P. Erding H. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M.

PPARγ2 is highly and specifically expressed in adipocytes. Ectopic expression of PPARγ has been shown to promote adipogenesis (27Brun R.P. Tontonoz P. Forman B.M. Ellis R. Chen J. Evans R.M.

The in vivo antidiabetic activities of these pharmacological agents correlate well with their PPARγ agonist activity in vitro. The mechanism(s) by which these beneficial actions are attained is not fully understood at present. Activation of PPARγ potentiates adipocyte differentiation and anabolic lipid metabolism. In addition, PPARγ has been shown to transactivate directly a number of genes in adipocytes that contain peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) in their promoters, including adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (aP2) (24Tontonoz P. Erding H. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (2000) Google Scholar) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) (36Tontonoz P. Hu E. Devine J. Geale E.G. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 351-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PPARγ agonists have also been show to inhibit expression of the leptin (ob) gene via a receptor-mediated mechanism that may also involve the adipogenic transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (37Kallen C.B. Lazar M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5793-5796Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 38Hollenberg A.N. Susulic V.S. Madura J.P. Zhang B. Moller D.E. Tontonoz P. Sarraf P.

Several recent observations have suggested a role for PPARγ in controlling the expression of 11β-HSD-1 in adipocytes. Expression of 11β-HSD-1 increases in 3T3-L1 cells as they proceed through the differentiation process in a manner similar to other late PPARγ-sensitive adipocyte differentiation markers (39Napolitano A. Voice M.W. Edwards C.R. Seckl J.R. Chapman K.E. J. Steroid. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 64: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have recently observed in DNA chip studies that hepatic expression of 11β-HSD-1 may be regulated by PPARα agonists (47Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Gerhold D. Mundt S.S. Loving V.A. Lu M. Chen Y. Elbrecht A. Wu M. Doebber T. Kelly L. Milot D. Guo Q. Wang P.R. Ippolito M. Chao Y.S. Wright S.D. Theiringer R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that both thiazolidinedione and nonthiazolidinedione PPARγ agonists markedly inhibited 11β-HSD-1 gene expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. A decrease in conversion of radiolabeled cortisone to cortisol by the cells was also observed after PPARγ agonist treatment. The time course of the diminution in 11β-HSD-1 expression was significantly greater than that required to reduce expression of the leptin gene. Half-maximal inhibition of 11β-HSD-1 expression by the thiazolidinedione rosiglitazone occurred at a concentration that was similar to ED50 values the compound previously displayed for potentiating adipocyte differentiation and decreasing leptin expression as well as the Kd value reported for its binding to PPARγ (33Lehmann J.M.

Lazar M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5793-5796Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that ligand activation of PPARγ down-regulates expression of 11β-HSD-1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. A similar diminution in adipose tissue 11β-HSD-1 expression was also observed in diabetic mice treated with rosiglitazone. This decline may mediate some of the antidiabetic actions of PPARγ agonists in vivo. Cell culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All other reagent grade chemicals were from Sigma. The thiazolidinediones, rosiglitazone (((±)-5-(4-(2-(methyl-2-pyridinylamino)ethoxy)phenyl)methyl)-2,4-thiazolidinedione) and TZD2 (5-[4-[2-(5-methyl-2-phenyl-4-oxazoly)-2-hydroxyethoxy]benzyl]2,4-thiazolidinedione) were chosen for use in these studies. In addition, a novel indole-acetic acid PPARγ agonist, L-805645 (2-(2-(4-phenoxy-2-propylphenoxy)ethyl)indole-5-acetic acid), was kindly provided by Drs. Derek Von Langen and Michael Kress of Merck. 3T3-L1 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA; passages 3–9) were grown to confluence in medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and induced to differentiate as described previously (40Zhang B. Berger J. Hu E. Szalkowski D. White-Carrington S. Spiegelman B. Moller D.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1457-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Briefly, differentiation was induced by incubating the cells with medium A supplemented with methylisobutylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin for 2 days, followed by another 2-day incubation with medium A supplemented with insulin. The cells were further incubated in medium A for an additional 4 days to complete the adipocyte conversion. At day 8 following the initiation of differentiation, cells were incubated in medium A +/− compounds for the times and at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Total RNA was prepared from cells and tissue using the Ultraspec RNA isolation kit (Biotecx, Houston, TX), and RNA concentration was estimated from absorbance at 260 nm. Expression levels of specific mRNAs were quantitated using quantitative fluorescent real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RNA was first reverse-transcribed using random hexamers in a protocol provided by the manufacturer (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Amplification of each target cDNA was then performed with TaqMan® PCR Reagent Kits in the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The primer/probe sets used for the amplification step are shown in TableI.Table IPrimer/probe setsGene5′ Primer (5′-3′)3′ Primer (5′-3′)Probe (5′-3′)11β-HSD-1AAGCAGAGCAATGGCAGCATGAGCAATCATAGGCTGGGTCATCGTCATCTCCTCCTTGGCTGGGAAaP2GAATTCGATGAAATCACCGCACTCTTTATTGTGGTCGACTTTCCACGACAGGAAGGTGAAGAAGCATCATAACLeptinCCAAAACCCTCATCAAGACCAAGTCCAAGCCAGTGACCCTCTATTTCACACACGCAGTCGGTATCCGCPEPCKAAATCCGGCAAGGCGCTCTGGTGCCACCTTTCTTCCCAGCGATCTCTGATCCAGACCTTCCAA Open table in a new tab The levels of mRNA were normalized to the amount of 18 S ribosomal RNA (primers and probes commercially available from PE Biosystems) detected in each sample. The chance of amplifying contaminating genomic DNA in our RNA samples was minimized in two ways as follows: first, by using primer/probe sets that span intron/exon junctions where possible (not shown), and second, by demonstrating that no significant signal was obtained in control PCRs performed with samples obtained from reverse transcription reactions carried out in the absence of reverse transcriptase and the primer/probe sets presented above (not shown). 11β-HSD activity was measured in intact cells cultured and treated in 6-well tissue culture dishes as described above by measuring the rate of conversion of [3H]cortisone to [3H]cortisol. Briefly, after treatment of the cells, medium was removed and replaced with 1 ml of medium A containing 15 nm [3H]cortisone (specific activity 50 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO). Medium was removed in intervals between 30 min and 24 h after the addition of steroids. Steroids were extracted with 3 ml of ethyl acetate. The organic phase was collected, evaporated to dryness, and reconstituted in dimethyl sulfoxide containing 16 μg/ml each of unlabeled cortisone and cortisol. The samples were injected into a Waters HPLC system using an Inertsil 5-μm ODS2 column (Metachem Technologies, Torrence, CA) and eluted using a gradient of 70% solvent A (water/methanol/trifluoroacetic acid, 90:10:0.05, v/v/v), 30% solvent B (water/methanol/trifluoroacetic acid, 10:90:0.05, v/v/v) to 40% solvent A, 60% solvent B. Eluted tritiated steroids were detected using a β-RAM scintillation counter. The conversion of [3H]cortisone to [3H]cortisol was calculated as an index of activity. Specific pathogen-free, 10–11-week-old male db/db (C57BL6/J +/+Lepr db) or lean control heterozygous mice (Jackson Laboratories) were housed in static microisolators and allowed ad libitum access to pelleted chow (Purina 5001, Richmond, IN) and water. The animal room was maintained on a 12:12 h light/dark cycle. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Merck reviewed and approved all animal use, and all animals were cared for in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The animals were dosed daily for 11 days by oral gavage with vehicle (0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose) with or without rosiglitazone (10 mg/kg; n = 7). On day 11 of treatment, blood samples were collected into lithium heparin microtainer tubes, and epididymal white adipose tissue was removed and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue samples were further processed for RNA isolation as described above. Glucose and triglyceride levels were determined by hexokinase and glycerophosphate oxidase methods, respectively (Hitachi 911, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Plasma corticosterone levels were quantitated by radioimmunoassay (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of several determinations. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test. It has previously been shown by qualitative Northern blot analysis that 11β-HSD-1 mRNA expression increases dramatically when 3T3-L1 preadipocytes are differentiated into terminally differentiated adipocytes (39Napolitano A. Voice M.W. Edwards C.R. Seckl J.R. Chapman K.E. J. Steroid. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 64: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To quantify the relative increase in 11β-HSD-1 gene expression resulting from the adipogenesis process, confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were allowed to differentiate by a standard protocol described under “Experimental Procedures.” Total RNA was then isolated from preadipocytes and adipocytes, and the level of 11β-HSD-1 mRNA was determined using quantitative real time PCR. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the level of expression of 11β-HSD-1 increased almost 500-fold upon differentiation of the cells. By using the same RNA samples and techniques, the relative level of the adipocyte fatty acid binding protein, aP2, was found to be ∼30-fold greater in 3T3-L1 adipocytes than preadipocytes (Fig. 1 A). We have previously observed similar increases in aP2 mRNA levels using quantitative slot-blot analysis (41Zhang B. MacNaul K. Szalkowski D. Li Z. Berger J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1999; 84: 4274-4277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the effect of 3T3-L1 cell differentiation on 11β-HSD-1 activity, the ability of cells to convert radiolabeled cortisone to cortisol was determined before and after differentiation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As the data presented in Fig.1 B demonstrate, adipocytes possess dramatically more 11β-HSD-1 activity than undifferentiated preadipocytes. These results correlated well with the increased levels of enzyme mRNA described in Fig. 1 A. We were not able to measure any conversion of tritiated cortisol to cortisone in intact preadipocyte even after extended (24 h) incubations with the substrate, indicating that 11β-HSD-1 functions almost exclusively as a reductase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and that 11β-HSD-2 activity is absent from these cells. We were able to demonstrate very small amounts of 11β-HSD-2 mRNA in the preadipocytes by quantitative real time PCR which, upon differentiation to adipocytes, decreased to undetectable levels (data not shown). To determine the effect of PPARγ activation on 11β-HSD-1 gene expression, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated for 48 h alone or in the presence of the PPARγ agonists rosiglitazone, TZD2, or L-805645. The first two compounds are thiazolidinediones and the third is a nonthiazolidinedione carboxylic acid-containing compound. All three compounds caused marked reductions in expression of 11β-HSD-1 mRNA (Fig. 2 A) and leptin mRNA (Fig. 3 B and data not shown). In contrast, all of the agonists increased expression of the aP2 gene 2–3-fold (Fig. 2 B), thereby demonstrating that the observed inhibition in 11β-HSD-1 mRNA expression did not result from general cytotoxic effects of the compounds.Figure 3Time courses of inhibition of 11β-HSD-1 and leptin mRNA expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by rosiglitazone. 3T3-L1 cells were grown to confluence and subsequently differentiated into adipocytes. At 8 days post-confluence, the cells were incubated for varying lengths of time with 10 μm rosiglitazone. The levels of 11β-HSD-1 mRNA expression (A) and leptin mRNA expression (B) at each time point were quantified by quantitative real time PCR and are expressed relative to the amount of mRNA found in untreated adipocytes. The data are shown as the means ± S.E. from triplicate samples of a representative experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Next, we examined the time course of inhibition of 11β-HSD-1 mRNA expression by rosiglitazone. As depicted in Fig. 3 A, the mRNA level of the enzyme decreased over an extended period with half-maximal inhibition occurring after more than 10 h and maximal diminution after 24 h. This result contrasted with that observed for leptin mRNA levels which, in accordance with previously published results (37Kallen C.B. Lazar M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5793-5796Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), dropped precipitously with half-maximal inhibition requiring less than 2 h and the maximal decrease ∼4 h (Fig. 3 B). It is also worth noting that leptin mRNA levels consistently declined to a greater extent than 11β-HSD-1 mRNA levels. The above temporal differences may be explained, at least in part, by a disparity in mRNA stability since leptin mRNA demonstrated a shorter half-life than 11β-HSD-1 mRNA in rosiglitazone-treated adipocytes when actinomycin was used to inhibit RNA transcription (data not shown). Rosiglitazone has been shown to bind PPARγ with aKd ∼40 nm (33Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3460) Google Scholar). When 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with various doses of this compound, expression of 11β-HSD-1 mRNA was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.4). Notably, the half-maximal decrease in expression of the enzyme occurred at a concentration ∼40 nm. The PPARγ agonist has displayed similar potency in decreasing leptin expression, increasing aP2 expression in adipocytes, and potentiating adipocyte differentiation (37Kallen C.B. Lazar M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5793-5796Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) (data not shown). It has been demonstrated previously that activation of PPARγ inhibits the steady-state level of leptin mRNA not by altering its stability but by decreasing its transcription (37Kallen C.B. Lazar M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5793-5796Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 38Hollenbe"

The envelope of Gram-negative bacteria consists of an inner membrane, the peptidoglycan cell wall, and an outer membrane (Fig.1A) (1Nikaido H. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 29-47Google Scholar). The latter is an asymmetric bilayer with glycerophospholipids (Fig. 1B) on its inner surface and lipid A (Fig. 1B), the hydrophobic anchor of lipopolysaccharide (2Raetz C.R.H. Annu. Rev.

A clue to lipopolysaccharide transport has recently emerged from studies of E. coli htrB mutants (12Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

HtrB is a lauroyl transferase that functions late in lipid A biosynthesis (Fig. 1A) (12Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Lipopolysaccharides bearing tetra-acylated lipid A species accumulate in the inner membrane of htrB mutants at 44 °C, inhibiting growth (15Zhou Z. White K.A. Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Raetz C.R.H.

MsbA is an essential ABC transporter (Fig. 2), closely related to eucaryotic Mdr proteins (13Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol.

MsbA overexpression restores growth of htrB mutants at 44 °C without restoring laurate incorporation, resulting in export of lipopolysaccharide with tetra-acylated lipid A anchors to the outer membrane (15Zhou Z.

However, their biochemical analysis is complicated by long times (4–8 h) needed to dilute out pre-existing MsbA supplied in transfrom a temperature-sensitive plasmid (15Zhou Z. White K.A. Polissi A.

Que N.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12457-12465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We now report the isolation and characterization of a novel temperature-sensitive point mutant of E. coli that harbors a single amino acid substitution in MsbA. Rapid inhibition of MsbA function in vivo following a shift of mid log phase cells from 30 to 44 °C results in the immediate arrest of the export of all newly made lipopolysaccharide and phospholipids, demonstrating that MsbA is an essential component of a general lipid transport system inE. coli. WD2 was isolated by random localized mutagenesis (17Galloway S.M. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6394-6402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of msbA near min 21 of the E. coli chromosome. Briefly, strain LCB273 (F'aroA273::Tn10), obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center, Yale University, was treated for 10 min at 37 °C with 40 μg/ml nitrosoguanidine (17Galloway S.M. Raetz C.R.H.

Chem. 1990; 265: 6394-6402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that was used to prepare tetracycline-resistant transductants of wild typeE. coli W3110 as single colonies (∼100/plate) on LB agar (18Miller J.R.

Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6394-6402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Temperature-sensitive mutants were identified by replica plating the transductants at 30 and 44 °C; 25 candidates were found among ∼5000 colonies that were screened in this manner. Each temperature-sensitive mutant was repurified and then transformed with the msbA+ hybrid plasmid (pZZ34) (15Zhou Z. White K.A. Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12466-12467.5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) or with the vector control (pACYC184; New England Biolabs). In 6 of the 25 mutant candidates, growth was restored at 44 °C by pZZ34. The A270T lesion was identified by sequencing msbA from polymerase chain reaction-amplified WD2 DNA. Inner and outer membranes of wild type and mutant cells were separated by ultracentrifugation on isopycnic sucrose gradients as described below. 50-μl portions of selected sucrose gradient fractions were each treated with 12.5 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, in 1% SDS for 30 min at 100 °C to release the covalently bound lipid A moiety from lipopolysaccharide under conditions that do not damage the other phospholipids (15Zhou Z.

The radioactive lipid A and phospholipids were then recovered from the hydrolysis mixtures by Bligh/Dyer partitioning (15Zhou Z. White K.A. Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

The lower phases were washed once with water, dried, redissolved in a small volume of chloroform/methanol (1:1) (v/v), and spotted in 10-μl portions onto a silica gel 60 thin layer plate (Merck), which was subsequently developed in the solvent, chloroform/pyridine/88% formic acid/H2O (50:50:16:5) (v/v). The locations and amounts of labeled phospholipids and lipid A were analyzed with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. E. coli cells were fixed and stained as described for halobacteria (19Robertson J.D. Schreil W. Reedy M. J. Ultrastruc. Res. 1982; 80: 148-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Cultures of E. coli W3110 and WD2 were grown at 30 °C for 2 h to mid log phase, and then shifted to 44 °C for 30 min. Controls were kept at 30 °C for 30 min. Bacteria were fixed by mixing an equal volume of fixative and culture. The cells were collected by low speed centrifugation. The primary fixative consisted of 3% glutaraldehyde, 0.1% triethylene-thiophosphoramide, and 1% acrolein in 0.1 msodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2. The secondary fixative contained 0.1% ruthenium tetraoxide in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.1 (19Robertson J.D. Schreil W. Reedy M. J. Ultrastruc.

Chem. 1990; 265: 6394-6402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutants in which growth at 44 °C was restored by msbA+ on a hybrid plasmid were examined further. Three strains with single amino acid substitutions in putative trans-membrane regions of MsbA were obtained. Mutant WD2 harbored the A270T substitution (Fig. 2) and stopped growing after ∼60 min when shifted from 30 to 44 °C (Fig. 2). There was no loss of viability for 30 min at 44 °C. The reversion rate of WD2 to temperature resistance was ∼1 × 10−5. To evaluate lipid transport, mid log phase cells at 30 °C were shifted to 44 °C for 30 min and then labeled for 10 min with32Pi (Fig. 3,A and B). Cells were chilled, converted to spheroplasts, and broken by sonic irradiation (25Osborn M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 642-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 26Raetz C.R.H. Newman K.F.

In wild type cells, membrane-bound radioactivity was evenly distributed between inner and outer membranes (Fig. 3A), reflecting rapid export of new phospholipids and lipopolysaccharide (27Donohue-Rolfe A.M.

Despite profound inhibition of lipid trafficking, the efficiency of 32Piincorporation was ∼2-fold higher in WD2 than wild type, indicating that WD2 was not depleted of ATP. Thin layer chromatography (15Zhou Z. White K.A. Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Wild type and WD2 cultures were shifted to 44 °C for 30 min and labeled for 30 s with 20 μm[1,2-14C]acetate. In this case labeled lipids were seen mainly in the inner membrane (Fig. 3, C and D) in both strains. When the 30-s pulse was followed by a 10-min chase with 50 mm non-radioactive acetate, half the 14C lipids shifted to the outer membrane in wild type (Fig. 3E), but >90% remained in the inner membrane in WD2 (Fig. 3F). As judged by thin layer analysis of the fractions (not shown), most of the radioactive lipid A was recovered in the outer membrane after the chase of the wild type cells, whereas labeled glycerophospholipids were present in both membranes. The latter finding is consistent with earlier studies demonstrating that phospholipids can return from the outer to the inner membrane, whereas lipopolysaccharide cannot (29Jones N.C. Osborn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7405-7412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,30Langley K.E. Hawrot E. Kennedy E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 152: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of lipid transport in WD2 was accompanied by an increased buoyant density of the outer membrane (Fig. 3), suggesting protein export was continuing. When cells, shifted to 44 °C for 30 min, were labeled for 10 min with35S-methione (Fig. 3, G and H), no inhibition of bulk protein transport was seen in WD2, confirming that protein synthesis and secretion were largely intact. The pattern and localization of the major 35S-labeled proteins in WD2 were also normal, as judged by SDS gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (not shown). Because inhibition of lipid export in WD2 at 44 °C persisted for 30–60 min before cell density leveled off (Fig. 2), inner membrane surface area was expected to increase more than outer membrane surface area. Thin section electron microscopy (19Robertson J.D. Schreil W. Reedy M. J. Ultrastruc. Res. 1982; 80: 148-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) of WD2 grown for 30 min at 44 °C showed striking inner membrane reduplications (Fig.5, B and D) and invaginations, consistent with selective inhibition of lipid export (Fig. 3). Membranes of wild type cells processed in parallel appeared normal (Fig. 5, A and C). The properties of WD2 suggest that MsbA is needed for the export of all major membrane lipids, including lipolpolysaccharide, in E. coli (Fig. 1A). We propose that MsbA has one or more key functions in lipid trafficking. It may facilitate lipid flip-flop within the inner membrane (Fig.1A, Step 1). Alternatively (or in addition) MsbA may utilize ATP hydrolysis to export lipids from the periplasmic surface of the inner membrane to the outer envelope (Fig.1A, Step 2), given recent data suggesting that bacterial lipid flip-flop is energy-independent (31Huijbregts R.P. de Kroon A.I. de Kruijff B.

Furthermore, MsbA may also be part of a larger molecular machine, like the “chunnel” for hemolysin secretion, which consists of an ABC transporter (HlyB), a periplasmic inner membrane protein (HlyD), and a gated export tube attached to an outer membrane pore (TolC) (33Thanabalu T.

Because there are many additional uncharacterized MsbA homologues in procaryotes and eucaryotes, single and multiple mutants need to be constructed in representative organisms to evaluate the functions of these proteins in lipid trafficking. Given that other E. coli proteins cannot compensate for loss of MsbA, WD2 may prove useful for studying the functions of diverse MsbA homologues by enabling complementation of its lipid export defect and temperature-sensitive growth.

https://openalex.org/W1970735844,"Akt is a protein serine/threonine kinase that plays an important role in the mitogenic responses of cells to variable stimuli. Akt contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and is activated by phosphorylation at threonine 308 and serine 473. Binding of 3′-OH phosphorylated phosphoinositides to the PH domain results in the translocation of Akt to the plasma membrane where it is activated by upstream kinases such as (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1). Over-expression of constitutively active forms of Akt promotes cell proliferation and survival, and also stimulates p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K). In many cells, an increase in levels of intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) diminishes cell growth and promotes differentiation, and in certain conditions cAMP is even antagonistic to the effect of growth factors. Here, we show that cAMP has inhibitory effects on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/PDK/Akt signaling pathway. cAMP potently inhibits phosphorylation at threonine 308 and serine 473 of Akt, which is required for the protein kinase activities of Akt. cAMP also negatively regulates PDK1 by inhibiting its translocation to the plasma membrane, despite not affecting its protein kinase activities. Furthermore, when we co-expressed myristoylated Akt and PDK1 mutants which constitutively co-localize in the plasma membrane, Akt activity was no longer sensitive to raised intracellular cAMP concentrations. Finally, cAMP was also found to inhibit the lipid kinase activity of PI3K and to decrease the levels of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate in vivo, which are required for the membrane localization of PDK1. Collectively, these data strongly support the theory that the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway inhibits Akt activity by blocking the coupling between Akt and its upstream regulators, PDK, in the plasma membrane.

Collectively, these data strongly support the theory that the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway inhibits Akt activity by blocking the coupling between Akt and its upstream regulators, PDK, in the plasma membrane. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)1-dependent cell signaling pathway has emerged as a key regulatory pathway involved in a number of cellular events (1Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Upon activation of growth factor tyrosine kinase receptors, the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K recruits the p110 catalytic subunit to the plasma membrane (2Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). The p110 catalytic subunit increases the level of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns-3,4-P2), which induce the membrane translocation of PDK1 and Akt (also called PKB or RAC-PK) by binding to the pleckstrin homology domain (3Anderson K.E. Coadwell J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 684-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In the membrane, PDK1 phosphorylates and activates Akt in a PtdIns-3,4,5-P3- or PtdIns-3,4-P2-dependent manner (4Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr.

Schlessinger J. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), activated Akt is released from the membrane and phosphorylates various targets.This complex and unique signaling pathway has been implicated in a variety of cellular events such as cell proliferation and survival (1Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar,7Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar). Previously, it has been shown that various survival factors, such as nerve growth factor, require the activation of PI3K to prevent various cell types from undergoing apoptosis (8Yao R.J. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar, 9Kulik G. Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the PI3K pathway protects cells from programmed cell death has been studied intensively. Recently, it was shown that Akt can phosphorylate serine 136 of BAD, a member of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family, forming a binding site for 14-3-3 (10Del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar, 11Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4914) Google Scholar). As BAD binds 14-3-3, it can no longer bind to Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL to inhibit their pro-survival activity. Akt also phosphorylates other important cellular factors involved in apoptosis, such as caspase-9 (12Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2719) Google Scholar) and fork-head transcription factors (13Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5366) Google Scholar), which results in the inhibition of apoptosis.Besides blocking apoptosis, the PI3K signaling pathway is involved in glycogen synthesis (14Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4324) Google Scholar, 15Frevert E.U. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The activities of Akt especially are closely correlated with these important biological activities. For example, GSK-3β (glycogen synthase kinase-3β) is phosphorylated at serine 9, and its activities are down-modulated by Akt (14Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4324) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, Tor (target of rapamycin) and p70S6K, which phosphorylate a translation initiation factor, 4E-BP (eIF4E-binding protein), and a ribosomal protein, S6, respectively, are positioned as downstream targets of Akt (18Scott P.H.

For example, cAMP is a key regulator ofDrosophila development by a mechanism in which PKA inhibits the Hedgehog-dependent activation of the Cubitus interruptus transcription factor (22Ohlmeyer J.T. Kalderon D. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2250-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In Dictyostelium amoebae, extracellular cAMP regulates G-protein-dependent and -independent pathways to control aggregation as well as the activity of GSK-3 and the transcription factors GBF (G-box binding factor) and STAT during multicellular development (23Wang B. Kuspa A. Science. 1997; 277: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 24Thomason P.A. Traynor D. Cavet G. Chang W. Harwood A.J. Kay R.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2838-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).More importantly, cAMP and its effector, PKA, are implicated in a variety of cross-talks between intracellular signaling pathways. It was reported that the exit from mitosis in Xenopus egg extracts required the MPF (maturation-promoting factor)-dependent activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway (25Grieco D. Porcellini A. Avvedimento E.V. Gottesman M.E. Science. 1996; 271: 1718-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that cross-talks between the Ca2+- and cAMP-dependent pathways exist in the cytoplasm (26DeBernadi M.A. Brooker G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4577-4582Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and the nucleus (27Rogue P.J. Humbert J.P. Meyer A. Freyermuth S. Krady M.M. Malviya A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9178-9183Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Also, it was demonstrated that cAMP inhibits the Jak/STAT pathway (28David M. Petricoin 3rd, E. Larner A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4585-4588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which is important in cytokine signaling. cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibits Gβγ-activated PLCβ2activity by phosphorylating PLCβ2 at a serine residuein vivo (29Liu M. Simon M.I. Nature. 1996; 382: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In addition, the Ras-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is strongly inhibited by cAMP-dependent signaling in various mechanisms (30Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 31Cook S.J. McCormick F.

A. 1993; 90: 10300-10304Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar).Recent findings suggest that there is also cross-talk between the PI3K pathway and the cAMP-dependent pathway. For example, an increased level of cAMP inhibits the interleukin-2-dependent activation of p70S6K (34Monfar M. Lemon K.P. Grammer T.C. Cheatham L. Chung J. Vlahos C.J. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In addition, CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein), in which transcriptional activities are induced by phosphorylation at serine 133, is phosphorylated at the same serine residue by both PKA and Aktin vivo (35Du K. Montminy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32377-32379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar).Here, we demonstrate that an increase in the level of intracellular cAMP inhibits the activities of Akt, PI3K, and their downstream target, p70S6K. Interestingly, PDK1 activity was not affected by cAMP treatments, but its plasma membrane localization was dramatically reduced. Taken together, these results support that the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway inhibits Akt through inhibition of PI3K lipid kinase activity and the subsequent inhibition of PDK1 localization at the plasma membrane.DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated that cAMP down-modulates Akt activity by interfering with the membrane localization of PDK1 and inhibiting the lipid kinase activity of PI3K. When we observed that the kinase activity of myristoylated Akt was strongly inhibited by forskolin, we first suspected that PKA might directly phosphorylate Akt and consequently inhibit the phosphotransferase activity of Akt, as Akt has a putative PKA phosphorylation site in its catalytic domain. However, the catalytic subunit of PKA was unable to phosphorylate Akt in vitro, and an Akt mutant that lacks the putative PKA phosphorylation site was still strongly inhibited by forskolin in vivo (data not shown). Furthermore, the phosphorylations required for the activity of Akt were greatly diminished by forskolin treatmentin vivo (Figs. 4 B and 5). These results led us to study the effects of cAMP on PDK1 and PI3K, two known upstream regulators of Akt.Previous studies have suggested that PDK1 is constitutively active and that its activity is regulated mainly by membrane localization via binding to PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (3Anderson K.E. Coadwell J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 684-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 4Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11630-11637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, a PDK1 mutant containing an N-terminal myristoylation signal constitutively activates co-expressed Akt proteinin vivo (3Anderson K.E. Coadwell J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 684-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the pleckstrin homology domain-mediated localization of PDK1 and Akt in the plasma membrane is critical for the functional coupling between the two protein kinases. Interestingly, our results strongly support the theory that cAMP signaling interferes with this process by inhibiting the lipid kinase activity of PI3K and the in vivoproduction of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (Fig. 9, A andB, respectively). However, we do not currently understand how cAMP inhibits PI3K in the cell. Our preliminary data suggest at least that a direct phosphorylation of the p110 and p85 subunits of PI3K by PKA is not a mechanism behind the inhibition of the PI3K activity. 2J. Chung and S. Kim, unpublished results. We also examined the changes in tyrosine phosphorylation status of the p85 subunit of PI3K by cAMP but found that basal and EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 protein was not significantly changed by cAMP under our experimental conditions.2 In addition, we found that cAMP does not affect the expression of PTEN.2 Thus, although we have excluded several possibilities for the mechanism of PI3K inhibition by cAMP, further studies are needed to elucidate this matter fully.Although we consistently observed an inhibitory role of cAMP for Akt in various cultured cells (Fig. 5), Van Obberghen and colleagues (44Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. McCormick F. Hawkins P.T. Mol.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 827-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have shown that activation of the cAMP pathway induces apoptosis within 4–6 h via CREM (cAMP-responsive element modulator) activation in a leukemia cell. In the v-Abl-transformed cell, cAMP induces programmed cell death via Raf-1 inhibition (49Weissinger E.M. Eissner G. Grammer C. Fackler S. Haefner B. Yoon L.S. Lu K.S. Bazarov A. Sedivy J.M.

In addition, retinoic acid and cAMP act in a synergistic fashion to induce apoptosis via caspase-3 activation (50Srivastava R.K. Srivastava A.R. Cho-Chung Y.S. Longo D.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1755-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, we believe that these findings have yet to link the cAMP-dependent pathway directly to the known molecular mechanisms for regulating apoptosis. With our present findings, we now propose that inhibition of the Akt activity may be one of the major mechanisms behind the induction of apoptosis.In the present study, we have shown that cAMP inhibits the in vivo production of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 and the activities of PI3K, PDK1, Akt and p70S6K, which suggests that other downstream targets of the PI3K pathway are also regulated by cAMP. As the PI3K- and cAMP-dependent pathways are deeply involved in various cellular events including cell growth, life span, metabolism, mobility and development, our findings may provide important clues to understanding the cAMP-PI3K cross-talk network and its role in the cell. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)1-dependent cell signaling pathway has emerged as a key regulatory pathway involved in a number of cellular events (1Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Upon activation of growth factor tyrosine kinase receptors, the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K recruits the p110 catalytic subunit to the plasma membrane (2Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). The p110 catalytic subunit increases the level of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns-3,4-P2), which induce the membrane translocation of PDK1 and Akt (also called PKB or RAC-PK) by binding to the pleckstrin homology domain (3Anderson K.E. Coadwell J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 684-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In the membrane, PDK1 phosphorylates and activates Akt in a PtdIns-3,4,5-P3- or PtdIns-3,4-P2-dependent manner (4Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr.

Tempst P. Coadwell J. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1998; 279: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). By a mechanism that involves phospholipase C (6Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Sigler P.B. Schlessinger J. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), activated Akt is released from the membrane and phosphorylates various targets. This complex and unique signaling pathway has been implicated in a variety of cellular events such as cell proliferation and survival (1Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar,7Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar). Previously, it has been shown that various survival factors, such as nerve growth factor, require the activation of PI3K to prevent various cell types from undergoing apoptosis (8Yao R.J. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar, 9Kulik G. Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the PI3K pathway protects cells from programmed cell death has been studied intensively. Recently, it was shown that Akt can phosphorylate serine 136 of BAD, a member of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family, forming a binding site for 14-3-3 (10Del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar, 11Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4914) Google Scholar). As BAD binds 14-3-3, it can no longer bind to Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL to inhibit their pro-survival activity. Akt also phosphorylates other important cellular factors involved in apoptosis, such as caspase-9 (12Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2719) Google Scholar) and fork-head transcription factors (13Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5366) Google Scholar), which results in the inhibition of apoptosis. Besides blocking apoptosis, the PI3K signaling pathway is involved in glycogen synthesis (14Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4324) Google Scholar, 15Frevert E.U. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), glucose transport (16Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4902-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar), and protein synthesis (17Thomas G. Hall M.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The activities of Akt especially are closely correlated with these important biological activities. For example, GSK-3β (glycogen synthase kinase-3β) is phosphorylated at serine 9, and its activities are down-modulated by Akt (14Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4324) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, Tor (target of rapamycin) and p70S6K, which phosphorylate a translation initiation factor, 4E-BP (eIF4E-binding protein), and a ribosomal protein, S6, respectively, are positioned as downstream targets of Akt (18Scott P.H.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5115-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). cAMP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) are regulators of development in many organisms and are involved in many other cellular processes. For example, cAMP is a key regulator ofDrosophila development by a mechanism in which PKA inhibits the Hedgehog-dependent activation of the Cubitus interruptus transcription factor (22Ohlmeyer J.T. Kalderon D. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2250-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In Dictyostelium amoebae, extracellular cAMP regulates G-protein-dependent and -independent pathways to control aggregation as well as the activity of GSK-3 and the transcription factors GBF (G-box binding factor) and STAT during multicellular development (23Wang B. Kuspa A. Science. 1997; 277: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 24Thomason P.A. Traynor D. Cavet G. Chang W. Harwood A.J. Kay R.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2838-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). More importantly, cAMP and its effector, PKA, are implicated in a variety of cross-talks between intracellular signaling pathways. It was reported that the exit from mitosis in Xenopus egg extracts required the MPF (maturation-promoting factor)-dependent activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway (25Grieco D. Porcellini A. Avvedimento E.V. Gottesman M.E. Science. 1996; 271: 1718-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that cross-talks between the Ca2+- and cAMP-dependent pathways exist in the cytoplasm (26DeBernadi M.A. Brooker G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4577-4582Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and the nucleus (27Rogue P.J. Humbert J.P. Meyer A. Freyermuth S. Krady M.M. Malviya A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9178-9183Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Also, it was demonstrated that cAMP inhibits the Jak/STAT pathway (28David M. Petricoin 3rd, E. Larner A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4585-4588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which is important in cytokine signaling. cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibits Gβγ-activated PLCβ2activity by phosphorylating PLCβ2 at a serine residuein vivo (29Liu M. Simon M.I. Nature. 1996; 382: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In addition, the Ras-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is strongly inhibited by cAMP-dependent signaling in various mechanisms (30Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 31Cook S.J. McCormick F. Science. 1993; 262: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 32Burgering B.M. Pronk G.J. Van Weesen P. Chardin P. Bos J.L.

A. 1993; 90: 10300-10304Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Recent findings suggest that there is also cross-talk between the PI3K pathway and the cAMP-dependent pathway. For example, an increased level of cAMP inhibits the interleukin-2-dependent activation of p70S6K (34Monfar M. Lemon K.P. Grammer T.C. Cheatham L. Chung J. Vlahos C.J. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In addition, CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein), in which transcriptional activities are induced by phosphorylation at serine 133, is phosphorylated at the same serine residue by both PKA and Aktin vivo (35Du K. Montminy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32377-32379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that an increase in the level of intracellular cAMP inhibits the activities of Akt, PI3K, and their downstream target, p70S6K. Interestingly, PDK1 activity was not affected by cAMP treatments, but its plasma membrane localization was dramatically reduced. Taken together, these results support that the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway inhibits Akt through inhibition of PI3K lipid kinase activity and the subsequent inhibition of PDK1 localization at the plasma membrane. DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated that cAMP down-modulates Akt activity by interfering with the membrane localization of PDK1 and inhibiting the lipid kinase activity of PI3K. When we observed that the kinase activity of myristoylated Akt was strongly inhibited by forskolin, we first suspected that PKA might directly phosphorylate Akt and consequently inhibit the phosphotransferase activity of Akt, as Akt has a putative PKA phosphorylation site in its catalytic domain. However, the catalytic subunit of PKA was unable to phosphorylate Akt in vitro, and an Akt mutant that lacks the putative PKA phosphorylation site was still strongly inhibited by forskolin in vivo (data not shown). Furthermore, the phosphorylations required for the activity of Akt were greatly diminished by forskolin treatmentin vivo (Figs. 4 B and 5). These results led us to study the effects of cAMP on PDK1 and PI3K, two known upstream regulators of Akt.Previous studies have suggested that PDK1 is constitutively active and that its activity is regulated mainly by membrane localization via binding to PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (3Anderson K.E. Coadwell J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 684-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 4Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11630-11637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, a PDK1 mutant containing an N-terminal myristoylation signal constitutively activates co-expressed Akt proteinin vivo (3Anderson K.E. Coadwell J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 684-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the pleckstrin homology domain-mediated localization of PDK1 and Akt in the plasma membrane is critical for the functional coupling between the two protein kinases. Interestingly, our results strongly support the theory that cAMP signaling interferes with this process by inhibiting the lipid kinase activity of PI3K and the in vivoproduction of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (Fig. 9, A andB, respectively). However, we do not currently understand how cAMP inhibits PI3K in the cell. Our preliminary data suggest at least that a direct phosphorylation of the p110 and p85 subunits of PI3K by PKA is not a mechanism behind the inhibition of the PI3K activity. 2J. Chung and S. Kim, unpublished results. We also examined the changes in tyrosine phosphorylation status of the p85 subunit of PI3K by cAMP but found that basal and EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 protein was not significantly changed by cAMP under our experimental conditions.2 In addition, we found that cAMP does not affect the expression of PTEN.2 Thus, although we have excluded several possibilities for the mechanism of PI3K inhibition by cAMP, further studies are needed to elucidate this matter fully.Although we consistently observed an inhibitory role of cAMP for Akt in various cultured cells (Fig. 5), Van Obberghen and colleagues (44Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. McCormick F. Hawkins P.T. Mol.

When we observed that the kinase activity of myristoylated Akt was strongly inhibited by forskolin, we first suspected that PKA might directly phosphorylate Akt and consequently inhibit the phosphotransferase activity of Akt, as Akt has a putative PKA phosphorylation site in its catalytic domain. However, the catalytic subunit of PKA was unable to phosphorylate Akt in vitro, and an Akt mutant that lacks the putative PKA phosphorylation site was still strongly inhibited by forskolin in vivo (data not shown). Furthermore, the phosphorylations required for the activity of Akt were greatly diminished by forskolin treatmentin vivo (Figs. 4 B and 5). These results led us to study the effects of cAMP on PDK1 and PI3K, two known upstream regulators of Akt. Previous studies have suggested that PDK1 is constitutively active and that its activity is regulated mainly by membrane localization via binding to PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (3Anderson K.E. Coadwell J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 684-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 4Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11630-11637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, a PDK1 mutant containing an N-terminal myristoylation signal constitutively activates co-expressed Akt proteinin vivo (3Anderson K.E. Coadwell J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 684-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the pleckstrin homology domain-mediated localization of PDK1 and Akt in the plasma membrane is critical for the functional coupling between the two protein kinases. Interestingly, our results strongly support the theory that cAMP signaling interferes with this process by inhibiting the lipid kinase activity of PI3K and the in vivoproduction of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (Fig. 9, A andB, respectively). However, we do not currently understand how cAMP inhibits PI3K in the cell. Our preliminary data suggest at least that a direct phosphorylation of the p110 and p85 subunits of PI3K by PKA is not a mechanism behind the inhibition of the PI3K activity. 2J. Chung and S. Kim, unpublished results. We also examined the changes in tyrosine phosphorylation status of the p85 subunit of PI3K by cAMP but found that basal and EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 protein was not significantly changed by cAMP under our experimental conditions.2 In addition, we found that cAMP does not affect the expression of PTEN.2 Thus, although we have excluded several possibilities for the mechanism of PI3K inhibition by cAMP, further studies are needed to elucidate this matter fully. Although we consistently observed an inhibitory role of cAMP for Akt in various cultured cells (Fig. 5), Van Obberghen and colleagues (44Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. McCormick F. Hawkins P.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 19: 4989-5000Google Scholar) reported on the activation of Akt by PKA through a PI3K-independent pathway. However, not only was the activation of Akt by cAMP and PKA only minor, cAMP rather inhibited phosphorylation at serine 473 of Akt (44Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. McCormick F. Hawkins P.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 19: 4989-5000Google Scholar). This finding does not agree with studies by other groups demonstrating that phosphorylation at serine 473 of Akt is necessary for its activity (4Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P.

Science. 1997; 277: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we demonstrated that the EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of endogenous Akt at both threonine 308 and serine 473 was inhibited to basal levels by forskolin treatments (Fig. 5). We also demonstrated the inhibition of PI3K activity (Fig. 9 A), the in vivo production of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (Fig. 9 B), translocation of PDK1 to the plasma membrane (Fig. 7), and p70S6K activity (Fig.2 B) by cAMP. We believe these findings reflect the general nature of the inhibitory effect of cAMP on the PI3K pathway, as it would be illogical for cAMP to activate Akt while inhibiting its upstream regulators. Furthermore, our findings were consistent in a variety of cell lines. While we were revising this manuscript, others also revealed, in agreement with our data, that cAMP cannot induce the phosphorylations of Akt at threonine 308 and serine 473 and cannot activate Akt activity (45Fang X. Lu Y. Bast Jr., R.C. Woodgett J.R. Mills G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11960-11965Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 46Li M. Wang X. Meintzer M.K. Laessig T. Birnbaum M.J.

Woodgett J.R. Mills G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11960-11965Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Therefore, we believe that we have demonstrated without a doubt the inhibition of Akt and other components of the PI3K pathway by cAMP under more relevant and natural experimental conditions. This conclusion is further supported by other groups' results that cAMP indirectly inhibits p70S6K, a downstream target of Akt and PI3K, in vivo (34Monfar M. Lemon K.P. Grammer T.C. Cheatham L. Chung J. Vlahos C.J. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and that cell-permeable cAMP fails to activate Akt in vivo (47Moule S.K. Welsh G.I.

Akt plays important roles in protecting cells from various apoptotic pressures. Recent studies have shown that Akt exerts its anti-apoptotic activities by phosphorylating important regulators for apoptosis such as BAD (10Del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G.

Lanotte and colleagues (48Ruchaud S. Seite P. Foulkes N.S. Sassone-Corsi P. Lanotte M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 827-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have shown that activation of the cAMP pathway induces apoptosis within 4–6 h via CREM (cAMP-responsive element modulator) activation in a leukemia cell. In the v-Abl-transformed cell, cAMP induces programmed cell death via Raf-1 inhibition (49Weissinger E.M. Eissner G. Grammer C. Fackler S. Haefner B. Yoon L.S. Lu K.S. Bazarov A. Sedivy J.M. Mischak H. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3229-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, retinoic acid and cAMP act in a synergistic fashion to induce apoptosis via caspase-3 activation (50Srivastava R.K. Srivastava A.R. Cho-Chung Y.S. Longo D.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1755-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, we believe that these findings have yet to link the cAMP-dependent pathway directly to the known molecular mechanisms for regulating apoptosis. With our present findings, we now propose that inhibition of the Akt activity may be one of the major mechanisms behind the induction of apoptosis. In the present study, we have shown that cAMP inhibits the in vivo production of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 and the activities of PI3K, PDK1, Akt and p70S6K, which suggests that other downstream targets of the PI3K pathway are also regulated by cAMP. As the PI3K- and cAMP-dependent pathways are deeply involved in various cellular events including cell growth, life span, metabolism, mobility and development, our findings may provide important clues to understanding the cAMP-PI3K cross-talk network and its role in the cell.

The cellular function and physiological activation mechanism of MST is unknown except for the proteolytic cleavage-induced activation in apoptosis. In this study, we show that MST1 and MST2 are direct substrates of caspase-3 both in vivo and in vitro. cDNA cloning of MST homologues in mouse and nematode shows that caspase-cleaved sequences are evolutionarily conserved. Human MST1 has two caspase-cleavable sites, which generate biochemically distinct catalytic fragments. Staurosporine activates MST either caspase-dependently or independently, whereas Fas ligation activates it only caspase-dependently. Immunohistochemical analysis reveals that MST is localized in the cytoplasm. During Fas-mediated apoptosis, cleaved MST translocates into the nucleus before nuclear fragmentation is initiated, suggesting it functions in the nucleus. Transiently expressed MST1 induces striking morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis in both nucleus and cytoplasm, which is independent of caspase activation. Furthermore, when stably expressed in HeLa cells, MST highly sensitizes the cells to death receptor-mediated apoptosis by accelerating caspase-3 activation.

This regulated process plays a critical role during embryogenesis, tissue homeostasis, and remodeling and serves to remove unwanted or deleterious cells such as self-reactive lymphocytes, tumor cells, or virus-infected cells. Deregulation of apoptosis thus contributes to the pathogenesis of cancer, autoimmune disease, and sustained viral infection, whereas excessive apoptosis results in inappropriate cell loss and consequently degenerative disorders (3Thompson C.B.

Then pro-caspase-8 becomes proteolytically autoactivated by oligomerization, whereupon it stimulates other caspases, including caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7, by cleaving them (9Nicholson D.W.

However, the cellular function of MST as well as that of most other SPS1/STE20-like kinases is largely unknown. MST1 and MST2 have an N-terminal catalytic domain and C-terminal regulatory region, whereas other subfamily members such as p21-activated kinase (PAK) have a long N-terminal regulatory domain containing GTPase binding domain that confers the ability to bind to activated Cdc42 and/or Rac1 (17Sells M.A. Chernoff J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Notably, PAK2 is proteolytically activated by caspase in Fas-mediated apoptosis and has been reported to induce morphological changes of apoptosis (21Rudel T. Bokoch G.M.

In contrast, the C-terminal regulatory region of MST does not have any known interaction motif, although this region is required for dimerization (23Creasy C.L. Ambrose D.M. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21049-21053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Some of the MST subfamily is responsive to cellular stress; inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α can trigger activation of GCK, and SOK is responsive to oxidative stress (24Pombo C.M.

However, MST1 is only activated by non-physiological stresses such as high temperature heat shock and high concentrations of sodium arsenite or staurosporine (16Taylor L.K. Wang H.C. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10099-10104Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Previously we identified a protein kinase that is strongly activated in Fas-mediated apoptosis. Biochemical purification of its activity revealed the kinase to be a catalytic fragment of MST1 (27Lee K.K. Murakawa M. Nishida E. Tsubuki S. Kawashima S. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Fas-mediated activation of MST resulted from specific cleavage at the caspase recognition site and was inhibited by caspase inhibitor, suggesting the direct cleavage of MST by caspase. These studies suggested that MST and other SPS1/STE20 family kinases are involved in apoptosis. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of MST in apoptosis. We clearly show that both MST1 and MST2 are cleaved by caspase in vivo and in vitro. The proteolytic cleavage reveals the activation mechanism of MST and causes its cellular translocation. Most important, we show that MST can caspase-independently induce morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis and enhances the sensitivity for death receptor-mediated apoptosis in epithelial cells.

For immunoprecipitation, cell lysate was incubated with 2 μg of anti-FLAG mAb or anti-MST mAb for 2 h at 4 °C and precipitated with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cell lysate or immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20) with 5% skim milk at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was incubated with anti-FLAG mAb or anti-MST mAb for 1 h, washed in TBST, and then incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After further washing with TBST, peroxidase activity was detected on x-ray films using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (DuPont). Purified His-MST1K59R or His-MST2K56R was incubated with the purified recombinant active caspase-3 at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli's sample buffer, resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and immunoblotted with anti-MST mAb. For purification of C-terminal His-tagged protein, MST1K59R,D326N was subcloned into pET29a (Novagen) and transformed into BL21(DE3)lysS bacteria. Jurkat cells were exposed to CH-11 for 4 h, and lysate was prepared in lysate buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture. Cell lysate (107cell equivalents) was incubated with 50 μg of purified MST1K59R,D326N-His at 30 °C for 1 h, and the reaction was terminated by adding 50 μm Z-VAD-fmk. The sample was mixed with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The resin was washed with 10 volumes of lysis buffer containing 5 mm imidazole. Laemmli's sample buffer was directly added to the resin, and cleaved proteins were separated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was immunoblotted or stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The fragment was cut and analyzed by N-terminal peptide sequencing (27Lee K.K. Murakawa M. Nishida E. Tsubuki S. Kawashima S.

MST homologues of mouse and C. elegans were identified by homology search against public data bases and cloned by PCR-based methods as follows. BLAST search identified overlapping EST murine cDNA clones homologous to 3′ regions of humanMST1 gene. To obtain a complete cDNA sequence, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR was carried out using a cDNA library of mouse lymphoma WR19L12a cells as template. For cloning of murine MST2, primers were designed based on the reported nucleotide sequence (GenBankTM accession number U28726), 5′-CAGGATCCGCCATGGAGCAGCCGC-3′ and 5′-AACTGCAGTCAGAAATTCTGCTGCCTCC-3′. The cDNA was amplified from the WR19L12a cDNA library. TheC. elegans homologue was found by a BLAST search against EST or genome data base (ACeDB). C. elegans MST was obtained from a strain N2 cDNA library by PCR using 5′-atgccaccgtctacagacag-3′ and 5′-cgaagccgtcattgaagtcg-3′ as primes. The cloned cDNA was compared with a genome data base (ACeDB) and matched completely with the predicted sequences by Gene Finder, a gene structure prediction program. The cDNAs of murine and C. elegans MST were subcloned pME18S-FL and pCMX-SAH/Y145F vector, respectively. Endogenous MST or various forms of FLAG-tagged MST were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of antibody, and the same amounts of immunoprecipitates as analyzed by immunoblot were used for in-gel phosphorylation assay (27Lee K.K. Murakawa M. Nishida E. Tsubuki S. Kawashima S. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) or immune complex kinase assay. For immune complex kinase assay, immunoprecipitates were incubated with 2 μg of histone H2B in 20 μl of kinase reaction buffer (40 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) with 20 mmMgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, and 0.1 mm vanadate) containing 25 μm ATP and 2.5 μCi of [γ−32P]ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by adding 7 μl of Laemmli's sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. A portion of the sample (15 μl) was separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed or analyzed by PhosphorImage analyzer. NIH 3T3 or HeLa cells were cultured on 6-well plates and transfected with 1 μg of MST kinase expression vector and 0.2 μg of a β-galactosidase expression vector (pLacZ). After 48 h, the cells were washed once with PBS and fixed with 2% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 5 min at 4 °C. After being further washed with PBS, the cells were overlaid with X-gal staining solution (5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 1 mmMgCl2, and 1 mg/ml X-gal in PBS) for 1 h at 37 °C and photographed. NIH 3T3 or HeLa cells on glass culture slides were washed with PBS, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 10 min. Anti-FLAG mAb (1 μg/ml) was treated for 1 h and then washed in PBS. The secondary antibody, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Cappel), was used at a 1:500 dilution for 45 min. Cells were washed with PBS, incubated with Hoechst 33342 (0.2 μg/ml), and washed again in PBS. For fluorescence microscopy of live cells, Hoechst 33342 (0.2 μg/ml) was added in culture medium, and the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C before microscopic observation. Cells were washed with PBS and observed under a 40× water immersion lens (Carl Zeiss). Samples were examined, and images were collected using Axioplan2 microscope (Carl Zeiss) connected to a CCD camera. The figures were prepared using Photoshop software (Adobe). Cell lysate (100 μl) was incubated with 50 μmDEVD-7-amido-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin in reaction buffer, 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), and 1 mm EDTA and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by adding an equal volume of 50 mm glycine HCl (pH 2.3), and fluorescence emission at 460 nm (excitation at 370 nm) was measured. We established several hybridoma cell lines producing anti-MST mAbs, and purified mAbs were characterized by immunoblot analyses for HeLa cells transfected with FLAG-MST1 or FLAG-MST2 (Fig.1 A). Monoclonal antibody G2B equally recognized both MST1 and MST2, whereas A8C selectively recognized only MST1. When apoptosis was induced, G2B and A8C could detect a cleaved 34-kDa fragment of MST. On the contrary, J7B detected the C-terminal 21-kDa fragment of MST2. Other mAbs, DIH, F5C, and H3B, recognized N-terminal 34-kDa fragment of MST1 and MST2. 2K.-K. Lee, T. Ohyama, N. Yajima, S. Tsubuki, and S. Yonehara, unpublished observations. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that A8C and D1H selectively immunoprecipitated FLAG-MST1, whereas J7B immunoprecipitated only FLAG-MST2 (Fig. 1 B). A8C could not immunoprecipitate N-terminal 34-kDa fragment although A8C recognized it in immunoblot.2 Both FLAG-MST1 and FLAG-MST2 were efficiently immunoprecipitated by G2B or H3B. With G2B and A8C anti-MST mAbs, we examined the cleavage of endogenous MST1 and MST2 during Fas-mediated apoptosis in HPB-ALL cells, which expressed both MST1 and MST2. G2B recognized a 34-kDa fragment of MST at 2 h after the stimulation of Fas (Fig. 1 C). This fragment was also confirmed by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2 A). The cleavage of MST was inhibited when apoptosis was blocked by the pretreatment with Z-VAD-fmk, a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor (Fig.1 C and 2 A). The molecular weight of cleaved MST coincided with that of the previously purified protein kinase from apoptotic HPB-ALL lysate, confirming our result that MST is specifically cleaved to a 34-kDa catalytic fragment in apoptosis (Fig.2 A) (27Lee K.K. Murakawa M. Nishida E. Tsubuki S. Kawashima S. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A8C efficiently precipitated MST1 when apoptosis was not induced or Z-VAD-fmk was pretreated. However, A8C could not immunoprecipitate MST1 when apoptosis was induced (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest that MST1 was completely cleaved to a fragment that could not be precipitated by A8C because A8C could immunoprecipitate only uncleaved MST1.2 Next, we examined whether the cleavage of MST induces its activation by immune complex kinase assay using histone H2B as substrate. As depicted in Fig. 2, A–D, the phosphorylation of H2B was substantially increased by Fas ligation with approximately the same kinetics as processing of MST and DNA ladder formation. Preincubation with Z-VAD-fmk effectively prevented MST activation for up to 3 h after Fas ligation. Bacterially expressed His-tagged MST1 and MST2 were purified and incubated with active caspase-3 in vitro. His-tagged MST1 and MST2 were completely cleaved to the 34-kDa fragment, and the cleavage was blocked by Z-VAD-fmk (Fig.2 E). These results suggest that both human MST1 and MST2 are physiological substrates of caspase-3 and are proteolytically activated by caspase in Fas-mediated apoptosis. To address the functional importance of cleavage sequences in human MST1 and MST2 (hMST1 and hMST2), we cloned murine and C. eleganshomologues (mMST and cMST, respectively) and compared the polypeptide sequences of hMST1, hMST2, mMST1, mMST2, rat MST2 (rMST2, GenBankTM accession number AJ001529), and cMST (Fig.3). Murine MST1 and MST2, which show 75% identity to each other, had 97 and 96% homology to human MST1 and MST2, respectively (Fig. 3 A). Previously reported cDNA (GenBankTM accession number U28726) that encodes a murine MST2-like polypeptide deleted the C-terminal region, which is caused by single nucleotide deletion. However, we could not obtain MST2 cDNA with nucleotide deletion or alternative splicing from a murine lymphoma WR19L12a cDNA library (28Lee K.K. Murakawa M. Takahashi S. Tsubuki S. Kawashima S. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19160-19166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We obtained only one MST homologue inC. elegans, which showed similar homology (∼50%) to mammalian MST1 and MST2. The kinase domain was most conserved, with 95–100% homology between mammalian homologues. Even the kinase domain of cMST showed 75% homology to mammalian MST1 or MST2. The C-terminal 60 amino acids required for dimerization were also highly conserved in all homologues (23Creasy C.L. Ambrose D.M. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21049-21053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B). The putative caspase-cleavable sites (Fig. 3 B, indicated byarrow) were conserved in all MST homologues, and these homologues were actually cleaved when apoptosis was induced.2 Thus, the functional cleavage sequence for caspase is evolutionarily conserved in MST homologues. Previously, Taylor et al. (16Taylor L.K. Wang H.C. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10099-10104Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) identified a protein kinase responsive to stress (KRS), which was activated by treatment with staurosporine but not by Fas ligation. Subsequent biochemical purification revealed it as MST (16Taylor L.K. Wang H.C. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10099-10104Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, since our result showed that Fas ligation activated MST (27Lee K.K. Murakawa M. Nishida E. Tsubuki S. Kawashima S. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2), we compared the MST activation by staurosporine treatment and that by Fas ligation in Jurkat cells that undergo apoptosis following these stimulations. Both staurosporine treatment and Fas ligation effectively induced the cleavage of MST1 to 34 kDa (Fig.4). Unexpectedly, MST1D326Nin which the site of cleavage (Asp326) by caspase-3 is mutated to Asn (27Lee K.K. Murakawa M. Nishida E. Tsubuki S. Kawashima S. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) was also processed to a slower migrating fragment of 40 kDa. In addition, the mobility of the 34-kDa fragment was slightly but significantly different in staurosporine- and Fas-induced apoptosis. The reason for the different mobility might be that staurosporine treatment caused a change of phosphorylation state in MST1, which was not caused by Fas stimulation. We investigated the kinase activity of each MST1 fragment by in-gel phosphorylation assay using histone as substrate. Phosphorylation at 55 kDa corresponding to full-length MST1 was greatly increased at 0.5 h by staurosporine treatment and peaked at 1 h (Fig. 4, lanes 1–4). In contrast, Fas ligation could not induce phosphorylation of full-length MST1 up to 3 h (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 6). Phosphorylation at 40 kDa was also rapidly induced at 0.5 h by staurosporine, although this fragment was not detected in immunoblot analysis. Fas stimulation did not induce a 40-kDa fragment in immunoblot or kinase activity of 40-kDa in-gel kinase assay. The 34-kDa fragment with histone kinase activity was generated from FLAG-MST1 (Fig. 4, lanes 1–6) but not from FLAG-MST1D326Nwithin 3 h by staurosporine and Fas ligation (Fig. 4, lanes 7–12). These results indicate that staurosporine can activate MST by two mechanis"

However, the molecular mechanisms of photoreceptor cell death in human cases and animal models of retinal dystrophies remain undefined. Exposure of Balb/c mice to excessive levels of white light results in photoreceptor apoptosis. This study delineates the molecular events occurring during and subsequent to the induction of retinal degeneration by exposure to white light in Balb/c mice. We demonstrate an early increase in intracellular calcium levels during photoreceptor apoptosis, an event that is accompanied by significant superoxide generation and mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Furthermore, we show that inhibition of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) by 7-nitroindazole is sufficient to prevent retinal degeneration implicating a key role for neuronal nitric oxide (NO) in this model. We demonstrate that inhibition of guanylate cyclase, a downstream effector of NO, also prevents photoreceptor apoptosis demonstrating that guanylate cyclase too plays an essential role in this model. Finally, our results demonstrate that caspase-3, frequently considered to be one of the key executioners of apoptosis, is not activated during retinal degeneration.

Nyctalopia (night-blindness), an initial symptom of the disease is associated with rod photoreceptor degeneration. As the disease progresses, severe loss of peripheral and central fields occur, due to the subsequent loss of cone photoreceptors. The genetics of RP is complex and to date at least 30 genes have been implicated in the etiology of RP, the majority of which encode photoreceptor-specific proteins that are either components of the phototransduction cascade or structural components of these cells (see the Retinal Information Network available on the University of Texas School of Public Health Web server). Despite the diverse genetics underlying the pathology of RP, one feature common to both human cases and animal models is the apoptotic cell death of rod and cone photoreceptors (1Chang G.Q. Hao Y. Wong F. Neuron. 1993; 11: 595-605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 2Li Y. Chopp M. Jiang N. Yao F. Zaloga C. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1995; 15: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Apoptosis, therefore, represents a common final pathway in the pathology of RP. Exposure to excessive levels of white light induces photoreceptor apoptosis and has previously been used as a model for the study of retinal degeneration (3Reme C.E. Weller M. Szczesny P. Munz K. Hafezi F. Reinboth J. Clausen M. Anderson R.E. Degenerative Diseases of the Retina. Plenum Press, New York1995: 19-25Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, several animal studies have demonstrated that photoreceptors from retinal degeneration mutants are more susceptible to the damaging effects of excessive light than normal photoreceptors (4Naash M.L. Peachey N.S. Li Z.Y. Gryczan C.C. Goto Y. Blanks J. Milam A.H. Ripps H. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 775-782PubMed Google Scholar, 5LaVail M.M. Gorrin G.M. Yasumura D. Matthes M.T. Invest.

Yasumura D. LaVail M.M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 2978-2982PubMed Google Scholar). The evidence from these animal models suggests that excessive light may enhance the progression and severity of some forms of human RP. The mechanism by which light induces retinal degeneration is at present unclear. A recent study demonstrated that rhodopsin is essential for light-induced retinal degeneration, indicating that signal flow through the phototransduction cascade is necessary to mediate the damaging effects of light (8Grimm C. Wenzel A. Hafezi F., Yu, S. Redmond T.M. Reme C.E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Indeed, constitutive signal flow in phototransduction is thought to underlie some forms of inherited retinal disorders (9Fain G.L. Lisman J.E. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 57: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This is supported by the significant number of mutated genes that encode components of the phototransduction cascade and are implicated in the etiology of RP or of related conditions. These include rhodopsin, cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase, the rod cGMP-gated channel, and rhodopsin kinase (see the Retinal Information Network available on the Web). Although the exact mechanism of photoreceptor apoptosis resulting from exposure to excessive levels of light remains undefined, a diverse range of agents have been used to prevent photoreceptor apoptosis in this model (10Li Z.Y. Tso M.O. Wang H.M. Organisciak D.T. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1985; 26: 1589-1598PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lambiase A. Aloe L. Graefes. Arch. Clin. Exp.

These include calcium channel blockers (13Edward D.P. Lam T.T. Shahinfar S. Li J. Tso M.O. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1991; 109: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) as well as antioxidants (14Lam S. Tso M.O. Gurne D.H. Arch.

Ophthalmol. 1992; 110: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) implicating a role for both intracellular calcium and reactive oxygen species in retinal apoptosis. However, the molecular basis for the rescue of photoreceptors from apoptosis in light-induced retinal degeneration by these agents has yet to be elucidated. In this study, the molecular events that occur during light-induced photoreceptor apoptosis are delineated. We demonstrate that inhibition of NOS not only prevents photoreceptor cell death, but also additional features of apoptosis, including superoxide generation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and elevated intracellular calcium levels, implicating a key role for NO in this model. In addition, the potential involvement of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), a central component of the phototransduction cascade, is explored by examining the effects of ODQ (1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one), a potent and selective inhibitor of guanylate cyclase. Inhibition of guanylate cyclase in this study prevents light-induced retinal degeneration. These results suggest that NO mediates cell death in this model through activation of guanylate cyclase, resulting in increased levels of intracellular calcium through cGMP-gated calcium channels. Finally, our results demonstrate that caspase-3 is not activated during photoreceptor apoptosis in this model. Adult male Balb-c mice were maintained in the dark for 18 h before being exposed to constant light. Immediately prior to light exposure their pupils were dilated with 5% cyclopentolate. The mice were then exposed to 2 h of cool white fluorescent light at a luminescence level of 5000 lux. The mice were sacrificed after treatment by cervical dislocation at the following time points: 30 min and 1 h after light onset, immediately after light exposure (0 h) and after 6, 14, and 24 h of darkness that followed the 2-h light exposure. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with the following:N G-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), 100 mg kg−1 (Sigma Chemical Co., UK) in PBS or the inactive isomerN G-nitro-d-arginine methyl ester (d-NAME), 100 mg kg−1 (Sigma, UK) in PBS as a control, 7-nitroindazole (7NI), 100 mg kg−1 (Sigma, UK) in peanut oil or peanut alone as a control, and ODQ, 50 mg kg−1 (Calbiochem) in Me2SO or Me2SO alone as a control. All intraperitoneal injections were administered 1 h prior to light exposure. Jurkat T-cells were maintained in RPMI containing 10% FCS. 32D cells were cultured in RPMI containing 10% FCS and 10% WEHI-conditioned media. Agents used to induce apoptosis were anti-human Fas (300 ng/ml) (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and exposure to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation (10 min). DNA strand breaks in photoreceptor nuclei were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). Briefly, enucleated eyes were fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 24 h, dehydrated, processed, and embedded in paraffin. Sections (5 μm) were incubated in 50 μl of reaction buffer containing 2.5 mm CoCl2, 0.1 unit/ml terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) in a 0.1m sodium cacodylate (pH 7.0) buffer and 0.75 nmfluorescein-12-dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany). These sections were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in a humidified chamber. Following several washes in PBS, the sections were mounted in mowiol (Calbiochem) and viewed under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse E600) using a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter. Three animals were used for each of the time points; 0, 6, 14, and 24 h after light exposure. Enucleated eyes were placed in PBS, and retinal dissection was carried out using a watchmaker's forceps. The choroid, sclera, and pigmented epithelium were removed, and the retina was then separated from the vitreous and lens. Retinal DNA was isolated following phenol-chloroform extraction. Briefly, retinas were placed in 150 μl of lysis buffer (20 mmEDTA, 100 mm Tris, and 0.8% sodium lauryl sarcosinate) containing proteinase K (20 μg/ml) and incubated at 50 °C for 18 h, vortexing occasionally. The DNA was then extracted with phenol chloroform and chloroform isoamyl alcohol (v/v, 24:1). DNA was precipitated with ethanol, and the pellet was dissolved in Tris-EDTA. Total RNase-treated DNA was visualized by including ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml) in the agarose and observed by illuminating on a 302-nm UV transilluminator. Retinal dissection was carried out as above. Tissue dissociation was achieved in a 0.25% trypsin solution (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, UK). The cells were washed in PBS and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 30 min. The cells were then washed again with PBS and then with permeabilization buffer (PB: 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 4% FCS, 0.1% sodium azide, and 0.1% Triton X-100). Cells were resuspended in PB containing 0.125 μg of anti-active caspase-3 antibody (PharMingen International, San Diego, CA), or the same concentration of an isotype control (rabbit IgG, Sigma, UK) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Following two washes in PB, cells were resuspended in 20 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit, Sigma, UK) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After a further two washes in PB, cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS for FACScan analysis on a Becton-Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer. Retinas were dissected and washed with cold PBS. Total protein was obtained by homogenizing retinas in 50 μl of chilled lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin. The cells were incubated on ice for 20 min and then lysed by 3–4 cycles of freezing and thawing. Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifuging at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein content of each sample was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK) using bovine serum albumin as a standard, and 80 μg of protein in 50 μl of lysis buffer was dispensed into each well of a microtiter plate. An equal volume of 2× reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.2% CHAPS, 20% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol) was added to each sample with 50 μm caspase-3 substrate-DEVD-pNA (Bahcem, Saffron Walden, UK; 1 mm stock in Me2SO). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then cleavage of the peptide substrate DEVD-pNA was monitored by liberation of the chromogenicpNA in a SpectraMax-340 plate reader (Molecular Devices, CA) by measuring absorption at 405 nm. The retina was dissected, and total protein was obtained by lysing in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride) containing antipain (1 μg/ml), aprotinin (1 μg/ml), chymostatin (1 μg/ml), leupeptin (0.1 μg/ml), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.1 mm). The amount of total protein of each sample was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. 60–80 μg of total protein from each sample was electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell, Dassel, Germany) and incubated overnight with the appropriate antibodies. Antibodies reactive to caspase-3 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), ICAD (Oncogene), PARP (PharMingen), nNOS (Transduction Laboratories), iNOS and eNOS (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used in this study. Membrane development was achieved using Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK). Superoxide anion levels were measured using a modified version of the assay as previously described (16Gorman A. McGowan A. Cotter T.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (5 × 105) were loaded with 10 μm hydroethidine (DHE) (Molecular Probes), prepared from a 10 mm stock in Me2SO for 15 min at 37 °C. Superoxide anion oxidizes DHE intracellularly to produce ethidium bromide, which fluoresces upon interaction with DNA. Superoxide anion levels were assessed by monitoring the fluorescence due to ethidium bromide on a Becton-Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer with excitation and emission settings of 488 and 590 nm, respectively. Mitochondrial membrane depolarization was analyzed using the probe 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolecarbocyanine iodide (JC-1, Molecular Probes). At high mitochondrial membrane potential JC-1 forms J-aggregates, which fluoresce strongly at 590 nm (measured in FL-2). Cells were incubated with JC-1 (5 μg/ml) in darkness for 15 min at 37 °C, and fluorescence was measured on a Becton-Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer with excitation at 488 nm. Intracellular calcium levels were determined using the intracellular calcium probe, Fluo-3 AM (acetoxymethyl ester) (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). Cells were incubated in darkness with Fluo-3 (250 nm), prepared from a 500 μm stock for 15 min at 37 °C, and fluorescence was measured in FL-1 (530 nm) on a Becton-Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer with excitation at 488 nm. Exposure to excessive levels of light results in photoreceptor apoptosis (3Reme C.E. Weller M. Szczesny P. Munz K. Hafezi F. Reinboth J. Clausen M. Anderson R.E. Degenerative Diseases of the Retina. Plenum Press, New York1995: 19-25Crossref Google Scholar). In the present study, Balb/c mice were exposed to 2 h of cool white fluorescent light at a luminescence level of 5000 lux. DNA strand nicking in the outer nuclear layer was assessed by Terminal dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) over 24 h in control animals and in animals exposed to 2 h of white fluorescent light. Retinas of control animals showed no TUNEL-positive labeling in photoreceptor nuclei immediately after light exposure (Fig.1 A). At 6 h, positive labeling increased, and at 14 and 24 h, abundant TUNEL-positive cells were apparent in the ONL (Fig. 1, b–e). Apoptotic cell death was confirmed by DNA agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig.1 B). Biochemically, apoptosis is characterized by internucleosomal DNA cleavage-producing DNA fragments that are multiples of 180–200 bp, which appear in agarose gel electrophoresis as a ladder pattern. The presence of this typical ladder pattern at 14 and 24 h (lane 3 and 4) confirms apoptotic cell death in this model and verifies the efficacy of the TUNEL assay to detect apoptosis following light exposure. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of light-induced photoreceptor apoptosis we investigated the role of NOS, previously shown to be involved in another model of retinal degeneration where rats were exposed to light for 7 days at an illuminescence of 90 footcandles (17Goureau O. Jeanny J.C. Becquet F. Hartmann M.P. Courtois Y. Neuroreport. 1993; 5: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of NOS in this model of light-induced photoreceptor apoptosis, animals were treated with the NOS inhibitor l-NAME (100 mg kg−1), 1 h prior to light exposure. In treated animals no TUNEL-positive photoreceptor cells were detected immediately following light exposure or following a further incubation of 6, 14, and 24 h in darkness (Fig. 2,e–h). Animals that were injected with d-NAME, the inactive isomer of l-NAME, showed similar TUNEL labeling to untreated light-induced animals (Fig. 2, a–d). These results suggest a key role for NO in this model of light-induced retinal degeneration. A role for calcium has previously been implicated in retinal cell death in vivo. The ability of calcium channel blockers to prevent rod photoreceptor apoptosis in two different models of retinal degeneration has been demonstrated (13Edward D.P. Lam T.T. Shahinfar S. Li J. Tso M.O. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1991; 109: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Frasson M. Sahel J.A. Fabre M. Simonutti M. Dreyfus H. Picaud S. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1183-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, measurement of calcium levels during photoreceptor apoptosis has not previously been conducted. In this study, intracellular calcium levels were analyzed using the fluorescent probe Fluo-3 AM (Fig. 3). Increased levels of calcium were detected after 30 min of light exposure, and the number of cells with elevated calcium continued to increase up to 3 h. This was followed by a significant decrease in intracellular calcium concentration. These data demonstrate that calcium elevation is an early and rapid event in retinal degeneration. This transient elevation of intracellular calcium is blocked by the NOS inhibitor l-NAME, suggesting that elevated intracellular calcium requires NOS activity. A key role for ROS has been demonstrated in an in vitro model of retinal degeneration, where antioxidants prevent photoreceptor cell death (19Carmody R.J. McGowan A.J. Cotter T.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 520-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).In vivo, a number of compounds possessing antioxidant properties have prevented photoreceptor apoptosis (see “Discussion”). However, to date, little is known about the oxidative pathways involved in such retinal death, nor have ROS measurements been conducted in an in vivo model of retinal degeneration. In this study, superoxide anion formation was monitored using the probe DHE in control light-induced Balb/c mice and in those treated with l-NAME (Fig.4 a). Increased levels of superoxide were detected following 30 min of light exposure, and the number of cells with elevated superoxide levels increased up to 3 h after the light insult. This was followed by a decrease in intracellular levels. This data demonstrates, therefore, that superoxide production is an early event in light-induced retinal degeneration occurring alongside increased calcium levels. Furthermore, our results show that superoxide generation is inhibited byl-NAME, suggesting that NOS activity is also required for the generation of superoxide. Mitochondria are the major site of cellular ROS production. The increase in superoxide production observed here prompted the investigation of mitochondrial dysfunction as alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) can result in increased ROS generation. The lipophilic probe JC-1 was used to analyze Δψm. In the presence of an intact Δψm, JC-1 forms J-aggregates, which are associated with a shift in fluorescence emission (590 nm). Thus, a reduction in fluorescence emission at 590 nm can be interpreted as a reduction in Δψm. As illustrated in Fig. 4 b, a reduction in Δψm is evident in a significant number of cells after 30 min of light exposure and 3 h after light exposure 75% of cells have reduced Δψm. This reduction in Δψm is blocked by l-NAME. Although the NOS inhibitor l-NAME is an established inhibitor of in vivo NO production (20Moore P.K. Oluyomi A.O. Babbedge R.C. Wallace P. Hart S.L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 102: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar),l-NAME shows little or no selectivity for individual NOS isoforms. As both constitutive and inducible isoforms of NOS have been reported in the retina (see “Discussion”), it is unclear which of the three isoforms; inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), endothelial nitric synthase (eNOS), or neuronal nitric oxide (nNOS) is responsible for the production of NO following light exposure. Indeed, elevated levels of NO may be due to increased NOS protein expression or activation by calcium entry into the cells. Immunoblot analysis revealed no detectable increase in either iNOS or eNOS expression (Fig.5 A, part a) and Fig. 5 A (part b). However, a time-dependent increase in nNOS expression was evident (Fig. 5 A, part c). Densitometric analysis revealed a 2.5-fold increase in nNOS expression at 3 h, a 3-fold increase at 6 h, a 3.5-fold increase at 14 h, and a 5-fold increase at 24 h. The retinas taken from mice treated with 100 mg kg−1 of l-NAME 1 h prior to light exposure showed no increase in nNOS expression (Fig. 5 A,part d). These results suggest that initial NOS activity is required for up-regulation of nNOS. To clarify the role of nNOS in light-induced retinal degeneration, we investigated the effects of treatment with 7NI, a selective inhibitor of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase that has been employed in several in vivo studies to inhibit the activity of neuronal NOS. 7 NI has high selectivity for nNOS (IC50710 nm) over iNOS (IC50 20 μm). In addition, several studies have demonstrated that 7NI had no effect on eNOS in the brain in a number of animal species, including rodents (21Moore P. Wallace P. Gaffen Z. Hart S.L. Babbedge R.C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 22Kelly P.A. Ritchie I.M. Arbuthnott G.W. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1995; 15: 766-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Wang Q. Pelligrino D.A. Baughman V.L. Koenig H.M. Albrecht R.F. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1995; 15: 774-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Animals were treated with 100 mg kg−1 of 7NI or peanut oil 1 h prior to light exposure. Retinas of control animals (injected with peanut oil) had scattered TUNEL labeling at 6 h and abundant TUNEL labeling at 14 and 24 h (Fig. 5 B, a–d) similar to untreated light-induced animals (Fig. 1 A). No TUNEL-positive photoreceptor cells were detected at 6, 14, and 24 h in the retina of animals treated with 7NI (Fig. 5 B,e–h). 7 NI, therefore, prevents light-induced photoreceptor apoptosis thus establishing the role of neuronal NOS in promoting light-induced retinal degeneration. A major action of NO is to activate the soluble form of the enzyme guanylate cyclase (24Ignarro L.J. Blood Vessels. 1991; 28: 67-73PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hobbs A.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 484-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Binding of NO to guanylate cyclase increases the latter's activity leading to the formation of cGMP, which may result in excess calcium influx through cGMP-gated channels. To explore the potential involvement of cGMP in photoreceptor apoptosis, we examined the effect of ODQ, a potent and selective inhibitor of NO-sensitive guanylate cyclase. Animals were treated with 50 mg kg−1 of ODQ or Me2SO 1 h prior to light exposure. In the Me2SO control animals, positive TUNEL labeling was apparent at 6, 14, and 24 h (Fig.6, a–d), similar to untreated animals (Fig. 1 A). In animals treated with ODQ, no TUNEL-positive photoreceptor cells were detected at 6, 14, and 24 h (Fig. 6, e–h). These results demonstrate that guanylate cyclase activity is required for light-induced retinal degeneration. Caspase-3 is recognized as one of the key executioners of apoptosis. Recently, activation of caspase-3 was reported during photoreceptor apoptosis in transgenic rats with the rhodopsin mutation S334ter (26Liu C. Li Y. Peng M. Laties A.M. Wen R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4778-4785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these mutants, pretreatment with the irreversible caspase-3 inhibitor, z-DEVD-fmk prevents photoreceptor apoptosis. However, emerging evidence now suggests that not all cell types require caspase-3 to undergo apoptosis, and it has been reported that oxidative stress can inhibit caspase activation during photoreceptor apoptosis in vitro (27Carmody R.J. Cotter T.G. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Because the free radical NO appears to play a key role in light-induced retinal degeneration, we determined the activation status of caspase-3 during photoreceptor apoptosis in this model, using three different analytical techniques (Fig. 7). Caspase-3 is synthesized as a 32-kDa inactive proenzyme and is cleaved at Asp28-Ser29 and Asp175-Ser176 to generate active subunits of 17 and 12 kDa. Analysis of the levels of the 32- and 17-kDa caspase-3 species using Western blot demonstrates the absence of active, 17-kDa caspase-3 in cell lysates taken from the retinas of light-induced Balb/c mice 3, 6, and 14 h after light exposure (Fig.7 A). The murine hematopoietic 32D cell line is included as a control to demonstrate the processing of pro-caspase-3 (32 kDa) to the active 17-kDa fragment as these cells undergo apoptosis following ultraviolet light irradiation. The activity of caspase-3-like proteases was further assessed by measuring the cleavage of the colorimetric substrate AcDEVD-pNA (Fig. 7 B). Again no evidence of AcDEVD-pNA cleavage was obtained in light-induced Balb/c mice 3, 6, or 14 h after light exposure. Untreated and anti-Fas IgM-treated Jurkat cells served as negative and positive controls, respectively. To further confirm the absence of active caspase-3 in the retina of light-induced Balb/c mice, assessment of active caspase-3 content by flow cytometry was carried out using an anti-active caspase-3 antibody (Fig. 7 C). This antibody is raised against the active fragment and preferentially recognizes active caspase-3. Untreated and anti-Fas IgM-treated Jurkat cells served as negative and positive controls, respectively. There was no detectable active caspase-3 at 3, 6, or 14 h after light exposure. Western blot analysis of two caspase-3 substrates, ICAD (inhibitor of caspase-activated Dnase) and PARP (poly (ADP-ribose)polymerase) was carried out to verify the lack of caspase-3 activity during light-induced retinal degeneration. ICAD is a caspase-3 substrate that exists as a complex with CAD and is cleaved at two sites by caspase-3 during apoptosis resulting in the release of CAD. PARP is cleaved and inactivated by caspase-3 into 25- and 85-kDa fragments. Analysis of the levels of the cleaved products of ICAD (12 kDa) and PARP (85 kDa) by Western blot demonstrates the absence of these fragments in cell lysates taken from the retinas of light-induced BALB/C mice 3, 6, and 14 h after light exposure (Fig. 7,D and E).

Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine multiple sites across the long axis of the hippocampal formation while subjects performed different phases of an associative memory task, learning to associate faces with names. Viewing faces and hearing names in isolation resulted in separate hippocampal activation patterns. Pairing faces with names resulted a spatially redistributed activation pattern, rather than a simple summation of the activation patterns resulting from viewing faces and hearing names in isolation. Recalling names when cued with faces reactivated a pattern similar to that found during paired training. Finally, the activation patterns representing faces and names were found to be experience dependent, emerging with repeated exposure. Interpreted in the context of hippocampal anatomy and physiology, these findings reveal hippocampal circuit mechanisms that underlie memory encoding and retrieval."
https://openalex.org/W1507538191,"Negative regulation of neuronal serotonin (5-HT1A) receptor levels by glucocorticoids in vivo may contribute to depression. Both types I (mineralocorticoid) and II (glucocorticoid) receptors (MR and GR, respectively) participate in corticosteroid-induced transcriptional repression of the 5-HT1A gene; however, the precise mechanism is unclear. A direct repeat 6-base pair glucocorticoid response element (GRE) half-site 5′-TGTCCT separated by 6 nucleotides was conserved in human, mouse, and rat 5-HT1A receptor promoters. In SN-48 neuronal cells that express MR, GR, and 5-HT1A receptors, deletion or inactivation of the nGRE (negative GRE) eliminated negative regulation of the rat 5-HT1A or heterologous promoters by corticosteroids, whereas its inclusion conferred corticosteroid-induced inhibition to a heterologous promoter. Bacterially expressed recombinant MR and GR preferentially bound to the nGRE as a heterodimer, as identified in nuclear extracts of MR/GR-transfected COS-7 cells, and with higher affinity than MR or GR homodimers. In SN48 and COS-7 cells, concentration-dependent coactivation of MR and GR was required for maximal inhibitory action by corticosteroids and was abrogated in the L501P-GR mutant lacking DNA binding activity. Corticosteroid-mediated transcriptional inhibition was greater for MR/GR in combination than for MR or GR alone. These data represent the first identification of an nMRE/GRE and indicate that heterodimerization of MR and GR mediates direct corticosteroid-induced transrepression of the 5-HT1A receptor promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2057810961,"Huntington's Disease is an inherited neurodegenerative disease that affects the medium spiny neurons in the striatum. The disease is caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine sequence in the N terminus of Huntingtin (Htt), a widely expressed protein. Recently, we have found that Htt is an antiapoptotic protein in striatal cells and acts by preventing caspase-3 activity. Here we report that Htt overexpression in other CNS-derived cells can protect them from more than 20 days exposure to fatal stimuli. In particular, we found that cytochrome c continues to be released from mitochondria into the cytosol of cells that overexpress normal Htt. However, procaspase-9 is not processed, indicating that wild-type Htt (wtHtt) acts downstream of cytochrome c release. These data show that Htt inhibits neuronal cell death by interfering with the activity of the apoptosome complex.

Rigamonti D. Goffredo D. Zuccato C. Squitieri F. Sipione S. Trends Neurosci... 2001; 24: 182-188Google Scholar). Interest in this protein derives from the fact that an expanded polyglutamine (poly(Gln)) tract in its N terminus causes Huntington's Disease (HD),1 a neurological disorder associated with the selective loss of striatal and cortical neurons (2Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group Cell. 1993; 72: 971-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7052) Google Scholar). It is well documented that the extended poly(Gln) stretch in Htt confers a deleterious gain-of-function to the protein. More recently, the hypothesis that loss of normal Htt function might contribute to the disease has gained strong support from studies reporting a number of beneficial functions of this protein in CNS cells (Refs. 3O'Kusky J.R.

Early studies indicate that Htt serves important functions during normal embryonic development, because homozygous knockout mice die by day 7.5 (7Duyao M.P. Auerbach A.B. Ryan A. Persichetti F.

On the other hand, recent findings obtained in adult mice where conditional inactivation of wild-type Htt was elicited in mature neurons demonstrate degeneration of axon fibers and evident signs of apoptosis, which were accompanied by neurological dysfunctions similar to those observed in current transgenic mouse models of HD (5Dragatsis I. Levine M.S. Zeitlin S. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). More direct evidence of Htt function in cell survival was provided for the first time by a study from our group, where conditionally immortalized striatal derived ST14A cells engineered to express the normal or mutant protein were exposed to various apoptotic stimuli such as serum withdrawal, 3-nitroproprionic acid, or transfection of death genes (4Rigamonti D. Bauer J.H. De-Fraja C. Conti L. Sipione S. Sciorati C. Clementi E. Hackam A. Hayden M.R. Li Y. Cooper J.K. Ross C.A. Govoni S. Vincenz C. Cattaneo E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3705-3713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that these stimuli triggered apoptotic death in parental ST14A cells but were ineffective in ST14A derivatives expressing either the FL or an N terminus 548-amino acid truncation of the wild-type Htt (FLwt and N548wt, respectively). As expected, an increased propensity for death was observed in subclones expressing mutant Htt. A subsequent report suggests that the Htt antiapoptotic effect occurs via sequestration of the HIP1 proapoptotic molecule (10Hackam A.S. Yassa A.S. Singaraja R. Metzler M. Gutekunst C.A. Gan L. Warby S. Wellington C.L. Vaillancourt J. Chen N. Gervais F.G. Raymond L. Nicholson D.W. Hayden M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41299-41308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Other investigations imply a role for Htt in protein-protein interactions, modulation of gene transcription as well as in retrograde and fast axonal transport, and nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling (for reviews, see Refs. 1Cattaneo E. Rigamonti D. Goffredo D. Zuccato C. Squitieri F. Sipione S. Trends Neurosci... 2001; 24: 182-188Google Scholar and 11Cha J.H. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 387-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that Htt exerts important effects on neuronal cell survival and stability. We have also reported that wtHtt cells are protected from apoptosis induced by caspase-9 transfection (4Rigamonti D. Bauer J.H. De-Fraja C. Conti L. Sipione S. Sciorati C. Clementi E. Hackam A. Hayden M.R. Li Y. Cooper J.K. Ross C.A. Govoni S. Vincenz C. Cattaneo E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3705-3713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data, combined with the reduced activity of caspase-3 and evidence that the same cells are killed by transfection of a constitutively active form of caspase-3, suggest strongly that wtHtt acts upstream of caspase-3, probably at the level of caspase-9 (4Rigamonti D. Bauer J.H. De-Fraja C. Conti L. Sipione S. Sciorati C. Clementi E. Hackam A. Hayden M.R. Li Y. Cooper J.K. Ross C.A. Govoni S. Vincenz C. Cattaneo E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3705-3713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that Htt's neuroprotective activity does not occur via blockade of cytochrome c release from the mitochondria, but rather through inhibition of cytochromec-dependent procaspase-9 processing and activity. One hypothesis is that Htt modulates the activity of the apoptosome complex by interacting with one of the apoptosome components. Finally, we report that Htt permanently protects CNS cells from toxic insults and that this effect occurs in several different CNS-derived cells. Conditionally immortalized striatal-derived ST14A cells and subclones previously engineered to overexpress the full-length wild-type (FLwt) or full-length mutant (FLmu) proteins or an amino terminus 548-amino acid portion of Huntingtin (N548) in the wild-type or mutant versions (N548wt or N548mu cells, respectively) were utilized in this study and grown as described previously (4Rigamonti D.

Med. 2000; 6: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The MTT assay was performed as described previously (4Rigamonti D. Bauer J.H. De-Fraja C. Conti L. Sipione S. Sciorati C. Clementi E. Hackam A. Hayden M.R. Li Y. Cooper J.K. Ross C.A. Govoni S. Vincenz C. Cattaneo E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3705-3713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples of 1–2 × 106 cells were rinsed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and stored as described (4Rigamonti D. Bauer J.H. De-Fraja C. Conti L. Sipione S. Sciorati C. Clementi E. Hackam A. Hayden M.R. Li Y. Cooper J.K. Ross C.A. Govoni S. Vincenz C. Cattaneo E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3705-3713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates were then incubated at 37 °C in buffer supplemented with substrate LEHD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (afc) (25 μm) for caspase-9 or IETD-afc (25 μm) for caspase-8. Release of the fluorogenic afc moiety and protein contents were quantified as described previously (4Rigamonti D. Bauer J.H. De-Fraja C. Conti L. Sipione S. Sciorati C. Clementi E. Hackam A. Hayden M.R. Li Y. Cooper J.K. Ross C.A. Govoni S. Vincenz C. Cattaneo E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3705-3713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess specificity, caspase-9 and caspase-8 inhibitors were utilized (Z-LEHD-FMK and Z-LETD-FMK, respectively). Where indicated, 5 nm cytochrome c was added. ST14A cells and subclones overexpressing FLwt or FLmu were plated onto 100-mm dishes. At 80% confluence, cells were exposed to SDM for 4 h at 39 °C, and the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were prepared according to a protocol kindly provided by Dr. T. Greenamyre and Dr. A. Panov. Briefly, cells were lysed in a hypotonic buffer and homogenized, and tonicity was adjusted to 250 mosm. Subsequent centrifugations at 9,300 × g pelleted the mitochondrial fraction. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g to obtain the cytosolic fraction. Total cellular lysates were obtained with a hypotonic buffer containing Triton (0.5%). The blotted proteins were exposed to anti-Htt mAb2166 (dilution 1:5000, Chemicon) or anti-cytochrome c (dilution 1:2000, PharMingen) antibodies. Five 150-mm dishes of cells at 90% confluence were lysed with Buffer A. The lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g to obtain the S-100 fraction. 35S-Labeled procaspase-9 was prepared using the TNT-quick in vitro-transcription/translation kit (Promega). In the assay, 20 μg of S-100 extracts were incubated with35S-procaspase-9, 1 mm dATP, and increasing amounts of cytochrome c at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were run on 12% SDS-PAGE, and the dried gel was autoradiographed. Statistical analyses were performed by analysis of variance test as described in Rigamonti et al. (4Rigamonti D. Bauer J.H. De-Fraja C. Conti L. Sipione S. Sciorati C. Clementi E. Hackam A. Hayden M.R. Li Y. Cooper J.K. Ross C.A. Govoni S. Vincenz C. Cattaneo E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3705-3713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ST14A cells (14Ehrlich M. Conti L. Toselli M. Taglietti L. Fiorillo E. Taglietti V. Ivkovic S. Guinea B. Tranberg A. Sipione S. Rigamonti D. Cattaneo E. Exp. Neurol. 2001; 167: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which are immortalized with the temperature sensitive oncogene Large T-Antigen, stop dividing at the non-permissive temperature (39 °C), tend to differentiate, and, in chemically defined SDM undergo apoptotic cell death. ST14A subclones stably transfected with wtHtt cDNA are protected from this death stimulus (4Rigamonti D. Bauer J.H. De-Fraja C. Conti L. Sipione S. Sciorati C. Clementi E. Hackam A. Hayden M.R. Li Y. Cooper J.K. Ross C.A. Govoni S. Vincenz C. Cattaneo E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3705-3713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yet, protection by Htt was drastically reduced after 120 h of exposure to this condition as a consequence of the disappearance of the exogenous protein (4Rigamonti D. Bauer J.H. De-Fraja C. Conti L. Sipione S. Sciorati C. Clementi E. Hackam A. Hayden M.R. Li Y. Cooper J.K. Ross C.A. Govoni S. Vincenz C. Cattaneo E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3705-3713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the possibility of a permanent, long term protective effect of Htt in these engineered striatal cells could not be properly assessed. We have now obtained a new generation of subclones of striatal ST14A cells where the expression of the transgene remains constant with time of exposure at the non-permissive temperature. N548wt cDNA was retrovirally transduced into ST14A cells because it reproduces fully the effect of the FL protein. Fig.1 A shows a Western blot analysis of lysates obtained from wtHtt cells that were exposed to 39 °C in SDM for 0, 5, 15, and 20 days. As shown, N548wt Htt expression remained stable over time. In these new ST14A subclones (Fig. 1 B, iN548wt-32 (○) and iN548wt-36 (⋄), permanent protection from the apoptotic insult occurs even after a 20-day exposure to these conditions. In the figure, parental ST14A cells show the typical decrease in cell survival with time at 39 °C (■). Furthermore, application of 3-nitropropionic acid at that time point (20 days at 39 °C) did not evoke death in iN548wt-32 and iN548wt-36 cells (Fig. 1 C), confirming a permanent antiapoptotic effect of the exogenous wtHtt. In a control experiment, 3-nitropropionic acid evoked dose-dependent cell death in parental ST14A cells grown in normal passaging conditions (data not shown; Ref. 4Rigamonti D. Bauer J.H. De-Fraja C. Conti L. Sipione S. Sciorati C. Clementi E. Hackam A. Hayden M.R. Li Y. Cooper J.K. Ross C.A. Govoni S. Vincenz C. Cattaneo E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3705-3713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the antiapoptotic effect of Htt was specific for the striatal-derived cells, the N548wt cDNA was also expressed in hippocampal cells HiB5, fibroblast 3T3 cells, and fibrosarcoma L929 cells. Whereas overexpression of Htt in HiB5 cells confirmed the protective effect from SDM (Fig. 1 D) or 3-nitropropionic acid exposures (Fig. 1 E), no protection was seen in 3T3 derivatives with stable expression of wtHtt treated with 3-nitropropionic acid (data not shown) or in N548wt-expressing subclones of L929 cells exposed to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (Fig.1 F). In these same conditions, no changes in caspase-8 activity were detected in N548wt L929 cells with respect to parental cells (data not shown). We have previously shown that wtHtt protects from apoptosis upstream of caspase-3 and downstream of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members BIK and BAK (4Rigamonti D. Bauer J.H. De-Fraja C. Conti L. Sipione S. Sciorati C. Clementi E. Hackam A. Hayden M.R. Li Y. Cooper J.K. Ross C.A. Govoni S. Vincenz C. Cattaneo E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3705-3713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the toxicity that follows transfection of procaspase-9 in parental ST14A cells is prevented by expression of wtHtt (4Rigamonti D. Bauer J.H. De-Fraja C. Conti L. Sipione S. Sciorati C. Clementi E. Hackam A. Hayden M.R. Li Y. Cooper J.K. Ross C.A. Govoni S. Vincenz C. Cattaneo E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3705-3713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On this basis, we hypothesized that the molecular target of Htt neuroprotective action lies at the level of caspase-9. We therefore analyzed the effect of the temperature shift on the activity of caspase-9 by monitoring the release of the fluorogenic afc moiety from the caspase-9 substrate LEHD-afc in the absence or presence of exogenous cytochrome c. In Fig.2 A, parental ST14A cells (■) show an increased release of the fluorogenic moiety over time, which, as expected, is enhanced in FLmu cells (○). In contrast, release of the fluorogenic moiety is completely inhibited in FLwt cells (Fig.2 A, ⋄) even at 12 h. This effect appears to be modulated by cytochrome c, because addition of exogenous cytochrome c after 3 h of permanence at 39 °C increased greatly the levels of caspase-9 activation in ST14A cells (Fig. 2 B). Nevertheless, FLwt cells showed no caspase-9 activity even when exogenous cytochrome c was added (Fig.2 B). We concluded that wild-type Htt exerts its antiapoptotic effect by modulating a step upstream of caspase-9 activation. We previously reported that wtHtt cells are protected from the action of proapoptotic Bcl-2 homologs, implying that Htt acts on mitochondrial or postmitochondrial apoptotic events (4Rigamonti D. Bauer J.H. De-Fraja C. Conti L. Sipione S. Sciorati C. Clementi E. Hackam A. Hayden M.R. Li Y. Cooper J.K. Ross C.A. Govoni S. Vincenz C. Cattaneo E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3705-3713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate whether inhibition of caspase-9 activity in wtHtt cells is caused by impaired cytochrome crelease from the mitochondria, we analyzed levels of cytosolic cytochrome c in parental, FLwt, and FLmu cells. Cells were exposed to SDM at 39 °C, and the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were prepared. As shown in Fig.3, under normal growth conditions most of the cytochrome c is found in the mitochondrial fraction. Indeed, a Western analysis of the cytosolic fraction from parental and FLwt cells was negative for cytochrome c. Interestingly, in the same normal passaging conditions, cytochrome c was found in the cytosol of FLmu cells. Notably, however, exposure of the cells to a death stimulus like SDM at 39 °C for 4 h evoked a similar release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria of parental and FLwt cells (Fig. 3). We concluded that Htt protective activity does not involve inhibition of cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. Release of cytochromec from mitochondria by apoptotic signals induces ATP/dATP-dependent formation of the apoptosome complex, with subsequent autoprocessing of procaspase-9 into its two active fragments (15Srinivasula S.M.

Because our data demonstrate inhibition of caspase-9 activity in the presence of cytochrome c in the cytosolic fraction of wtHtt cells, we reasoned that Htt could play a role in caspase-9 processing. To this end, in vitro caspase-9 cleavage assays were performed (16Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4458) Google Scholar). S-100 extracts from parental ST14A cells, N548wt, FLwt, N548mu, and Flmu cells were incubated with35S-labeled in vitro transcribed/translated procaspase-9, and increasing amounts (0.4, 4, 40 ng/μl) of cytochromec. Fig. 4 shows that the appearance of the two active fragments from the inactive 48-kDa procaspase-9 in parental ST14A cells is cytochrome cconcentration-dependent. In particular, no processing is observed at the lower concentration of 0.4 ng/μl. In contrast, at that same dose, N548mu and FLmu cells were able to process procaspase-9. Thus, we also demonstrate that N548wt and FLwt cells process procaspase-9 less efficiently than parental cells, even at the maximal concentration of cytochrome c utilized in our study. We conclude that wtHtt exerts its antiapoptotic role by interfering with cytochrome c-dependent procaspase-9 processing. In our previous report we demonstrated that Htt prevents apoptosis of striatal cells (4Rigamonti D. Bauer J.H. De-Fraja C. Conti L. Sipione S. Sciorati C. Clementi E. Hackam A. Hayden M.R. Li Y. Cooper J.K. Ross C.A. Govoni S. Vincenz C. Cattaneo E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3705-3713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This evidence, combined with more recent data from other authors, together suggest that loss of Htt function plays a role in HD (1Cattaneo E. Rigamonti D. Goffredo D. Zuccato C. Squitieri F. Sipione S. Trends Neurosci... 2001; 24: 182-188Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which Htt exerts this protective effect is also beginning to be elucidated. We previously found that Htt acts upstream of caspase-3 and downstream of proapoptotic Bcl2-members (4Rigamonti D. Bauer J.H. De-Fraja C. Conti L. Sipione S. Sciorati C. Clementi E. Hackam A. Hayden M.R. Li Y. Cooper J.K. Ross C.A. Govoni S. Vincenz C. Cattaneo E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3705-3713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report an inhibition of caspase-9 activity in cells expressing wtHtt. We also report that cytochrome c redistributes normally into the cytosol of wtHtt cells exposed to apoptotic insults. However, these cells do not undergo cell death (4Rigamonti D. Bauer J.H. De-Fraja C. Conti L. Sipione S. Sciorati C. Clementi E. Hackam A. Hayden M.R. Li Y. Cooper J.K. Ross C.A. Govoni S. Vincenz C. Cattaneo E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3705-3713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During apoptosis cytochromec release from mitochondria yields to recruitment of Apaf-1 and processing of procaspase-9 into its two active fragments. We demonstrate that wild-type Htt exerts a negative effect on cytochromec-dependent processing of procaspase-9. As expected, processing of procaspase-9 occurs more efficiently in mutant Htt cells, leading to increased caspase-3 activation; the latter result was reported in several studies (4Rigamonti D. Bauer J.H. De-Fraja C. Conti L. Sipione S. Sciorati C. Clementi E. Hackam A. Hayden M.R. Li Y. Cooper J.K. Ross C.A. Govoni S. Vincenz C. Cattaneo E. J.

Med. 1999; 5: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). We also show that cells expressing the mutation have a basal leakage of cytochrome c, which may reflect an acquired activity of mutant Htt at a mitochondrial or premitochondrial level. These data are in agreement with data showing caspase-1 and caspase-8 involvement in HD (6Ona V.O. Li M. Vonsattel J.P. Andrews L.J. Khan S.Q. Chung W.M. Frey A.S. Menon A.S. Li X.J. Stieg P.E.

Lam S. Cheng A.L. Li X.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 22: 2859-2867Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Based on the described activities of Htt, we also hypothesize that the wild-type protein functions to counteract caspase-9 activation either by binding to it directly or via inhibition of the apoptosome complex formation. In particular, Htt appears specifically to inhibit an apoptotic pathway, which is likely the most active death pathway in CNS cells. In fact, we found that Htt does not interfere with another apoptotic death pathway, which is caspase-8 mediated. These data reinforce the hypothesis that Htt plays a key role in CNS cells. As a matter of fact, we found that Htt is equally neuroprotective in a number of different CNS-derived cells. We also found that cells expressing exogenous Htt do not die even after lengthy exposure to apoptotic insults. Such an effect is of potential therapeutical value, as strategies aimed at restoring or increasing normal Htt levels or activities in cells would be relevant for HD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Taken together, these data imply that Htt plays an important role in the formation and/or function of the apoptosome complex, the controlled activity of which is crucial for proper CNS cell survival. At the same time, our findings argue strongly in favor of the possibility that loss of neuroprotective Htt function occurs in HD, with resulting increased vulnerability of CNS neurons (reviewed in Ref. 1Cattaneo E.

https://openalex.org/W1997309294,"Bipolar affective disorder (manic-depressive illness) is a chronic, severe, debilitating illness affecting 1–2% of the population. The Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs lithium and valproate are not completely effective in the treatment of this disorder, and the mechanisms underlying their therapeutic effects have not been established. We are employing genetic and molecular approaches to identify common targets of lithium and valproate in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that both drugs affect molecular targets in the inositol metabolic pathway. Lithium and valproate cause a decrease in intracellular myo-inositol mass and an increase in expression of both a structural (INO1) and a regulatory (INO2) gene required for inositol biosynthesis. Theopi1 mutant, which exhibits constitutive expression ofINO1, is more resistant to inhibition of growth by lithium but not by valproate, suggesting that valproate may inhibit the Ino1p-catalyzed synthesis of inositol 1-phosphate. Consistent with this possibility, growth in valproate leads to decreased synthesis of inositol monophosphate. Thus, both lithium and valproate perturb regulation of the inositol biosynthetic pathway, albeit via different mechanisms. This is the first demonstration of increased expression of genes in the inositol biosynthetic pathway by both lithium and valproate. Because inositol is a key regulator of many cellular processes, the effects of lithium and valproate on inositol synthesis have far-reaching implications for predicting genetic determinants of responsiveness and resistance to these agents."

Specificity for interaction partners and tissue-specific patterns of expression combine to endow each mammalian Bcl-2 family protein with a unique physiological rolein vivo, resulting for example in highly diverse phenotypes when members of this multigene family are individually knocked out in mice (reviewed in Ref. 4Vaux D. Korsmeyer S. Cell. 1999; 96: 245-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). Thus, a need exists to identify comprehensively the members of the Bcl-2 family and to elucidate their functional characteristics. In this report, we describe the molecular cloning and initial characterization of a new human member of the Bcl-2 family, Bcl-B. TBLASTN searches of the human expressed sequence tag (EST) data base using the amino acid sequence of the mouse Boo/Diva as a query resulted in the identification of homologous partial cDNAs. A human EST clone (GenBankTM accession number AA098865) was obtained (Research Genetics) and sequenced in its entirety, revealing an open reading frame (ORF) encompassing the last 151 residues of a protein with homology to Boo (Bcl-B) (submitted to GenBankTM with accession number AF326964). The corresponding genomic sequence for this cDNA was identified in the human genome data base (clone CTD-2184D3), which was derived from human chromosome 15q21. Because the EST clone lacked a candidate start codon, the corresponding 5′-end of Bcl-B cDNAs was cloned by a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach, using the forward primer NKO118 (5′-CGGGCCAAGAAAACCAGCGAAGG-3′), which was designed to hybridize to a region upstream of the Bcl-B ORF as predicted from the genomic data, and the reverse primer NKO121 (5′-CACTCAAGGAAGAGCCATTTGCAT-3′), which is complementary to a region downstream of the predicted Bcl-B ORF corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region of the putative mRNA. PCR amplification using human liver cDNA (CLONTECH) as a template with the above primers yielded a single ∼0.9-kb product, which was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen, following the manufacturer's instructions) to generate TOPO-Bcl-B (pNK254) and sequenced. Expression of BCL-B mRNA in various tissues was examined by RT-PCR, using oligo(dT)-primed first-strand cDNA derived from multiple adult human tissues (CLONTECH) as templates. cDNAs were amplified following the manufacturer's instructions using the forward primer NKO120 (5′-GTGGTGACGCTCGTGACCTTCG-3′) and NKO121 as the reverse primer. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers were used as a positive control (5Kitada S. Takayama S. DeRiel K. Tanaka S. Reed J.C. Antisense Res. Dev. 1994; 4: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The ORF encoding Bcl-B was PCR-amplified from TOPO-Bcl-B (pNK254) using the forward primer NKO101 (5′-GGAATTCATGGTTGACCAGTTGCGGGAG-3′) and reverse primer NKO103 (5′-CCGCTCGAGTCATAATAATCGTGTCCAGAG-3′). The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and XhoI and cloned into theEcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3-Myc (Stratagene), and the EcoRI and SalI sites of pcI-Neo-FLAG (Invitrogen) and pEGFP-C2 (CLONTECH). A plasmid encoding Bcl-B lacking its COOH-terminal transmembrane domain (Bcl-BΔTM) was constructed by PCR-based mutagenesis using primers NKO101 and NKO131 (5′-CCGCTCGAGTCATGTTTTCTCCAAAAAGCCAGTG-3′). The resulting PCR product was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and cloned into pcDNA3-Myc. HEK293, COS7, HT1080, and PPC1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Irvine Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics. For transient-transfection apoptosis assays, cells (5 × 105) in six-well dishes were co-transfected using Superfect (Qiagen) with 0.5 μg of pcDNA3-Bax plus 0.5 μg of green fluorescence protein (GFP) marker plasmid pEGFP (CLONTECH) or 0.5 μg of pEGFP-Bak, and 1 μg of pcDNA3, pcDNA3-Myc-Bcl-B, pcDNA3-Myc-Bcl-BΔTM, or pcDNA3-FLAG-Bcl-XL. The total amount of DNA was normalized to 3 μg per transfection using pcDNA3. At 24 h post-transfection, both adherent and floating cells were collected, fixed, and stained with 0.1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The percentages of apoptotic cells were determined by counting the GFP-positive cells having nuclear fragmentation and/or chromatin condensation (mean ± S.D.; n = 3). For stable transfections, HeLa cells in 100-mm dish were transfected with pcDNA3 (control), pcDNA3-Myc-Bcl-B, or pRC-CMV-Bcl-2 plasmids using LipofectAMINE plus (Life Technologies, Inc.). Two days later, complete medium containing G418 (800 μg/ml) (Omega Scientific Inc.) was used to select stably transfected cells. Several of the resulting G418-resistant clones were recovered using cloning cylinders and individually expanded. G418-resistant clones were screened for the expression of desired genes by immunoblotting with antibodies. For apoptosis assays, stably transfected clones (5 × 105 cells) in six-well dishes (30 mm diameter) were cultured in medium containing various concentrations of staurosporine (Calbiochem) (0.2–1 μm) or of recombinant TRAIL (Biomol) (10–100 ng/ml) for 8–10 h. Both floating and adherent cells were collected, fixed, and subjected to DAPI staining, enumerating the percentage apoptosis cells by UV microscopy. The intracellular location of Bcl-B was examined using fluorescence confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation methods, essentially as described (6Guo B. Godzik A. Reed J.C. J. Biol.

At 24-h post-transfection, cells were collected and resuspended in lysis buffer (142.4 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40) containing 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Soluble lysates were incubated with 10 μl of anti-Myc (Santa Cruz) or anti-FLAG (Sigma) antibody-conjugated Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C. Beads were then washed four times in 1.5 ml of lysis buffer and boiled in Laemmli gel-loading solution before performing SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting using the following polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies: polyclonal rabbit anti-GFP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), monoclonal rat anti-HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), monoclonal mouse anti-FLAG (Sigma), monoclonal mouse anti-Myc (Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-huBcl-2, rabbit anti-hu Bcl-XL, rabbit anti-hu Bax, or rabbit anti-hu Bak (8Krajewska M.

During TBLASTN searches of the publicly available EST data bases using the amino acid sequence of the mouse Boo/Diva as a query, we discovered an EST clone (GenBankTM accession numberAA098865) encoding a predicted polypeptide harboring a BH1 domain. PCR methods were used to obtain cDNAs containing the complete ORF corresponding to a 204-amino acid protein (Fig.1 A). The predicted ORF was initiated by an AUG start codon within a favorable Kozak context. The predicted protein contains regions resembling the BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4 domains typical of anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, as well as a putative carboxyl-terminal TM domain (Fig. 1 B). Comparisons of the sequence of this predicted protein with all known Bcl-2 family members by BLAST search indicated that it is most similar to the murine Bcl-2 family protein Boo (also known as Diva) (9Song Q. Kuang Y. Dixit V.M. Vincenz C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 10Inohara N. Gourley T.S. Carrio R. Muniz M. Merino J. Garcia I. Koseki T. Hu Y. Chen S. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32479-32486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), sharing 47% amino acid sequence identity, and thus prompting the moniker “Bcl-2 family protein resembling Boo” (Bcl-B). TheBCL-B gene is located on chromosome 15 (map 15q21), as determined by in silico screening of the human genome data base at NCBI. Comparison of the BCL-B cDNA sequence with genomic data indicates a two-exon structure, in which the region encoding residues Trp163 and Asp164 (within the BH2 domain) of the Bcl-B protein are interrupted by an ∼2.3-kb intron. PCR analysis suggested that the BCL-B mRNA is widely expressed in adult human tissues (Fig. 1 C). The Bcl-B protein was tested for interactions with other Bcl-2 family proteins by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, wherein Bcl-B was expressed in HEK293T or HT1080 cells with various NH2-terminal epitope tags. These studies indicated that Bcl-B is capable of associating with itself, Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL, but not with Bak (Fig.2). The function of the Bcl-B protein was explored by transient transfection in a variety of cell lines, including HEK293T, COS7, HT1080, and PPC1. Overexpression of Bcl-B did not induce apoptosis, nor did it negate suppression of apoptosis caused by overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL (not shown), suggesting that Bcl-B is not a pro-apoptotic protein. We therefore tested the possibility that Bcl-B is a cytoprotective protein by ascertaining its effects on apoptosis induced by the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak. Co-expressing Bcl-B markedly suppressed apoptosis induced by Bax but not Bak (Fig.3), thus correlating with protein binding data demonstrating that Bcl-B associates with Bax but not Bak (Fig. 2). This suppression was not due to reduced levels of Bax protein, as determined by immunoblotting. In contrast to Bcl-B, co-expression of Bcl-XL suppressed apoptosis induced by either Bax or Bak (Fig. 3). To further explore the effects of Bcl-B on apoptosis, HeLa cells were stably transfected with a plasmid encoding Myc-tagged Bcl-B,versus control (empty) plasmid. Several stably transfected clones were tested for Bcl-B expression by immunoblotting, and their responses to apoptosis induced by staurosporine (STS) or TRAIL were compared. Comparisons were also made to HeLa cells stably transfected with a Bcl-2-encoding plasmid. Fig. 3, C–E, show representative results, where control transfected (vector) cells were compared with two Bcl-B-transfected clones. The Bcl-B-expressing clones shown here (clones 9 and 16) produced different relative amounts of Myc-Bcl-B protein, as determined by immunoblotting, with clone 16 containing ∼5 times higher levels of Bcl-B than clone 9. HeLa cell clones such as clone 16, which contained higher amounts of Myc-Bcl-B, displayed resistance to apoptosis induced by STS and TRAIL, compared with control (vector)-transfected cells. In contrast, HeLa cell clones such as clone 9, which contained lower levels of Myc-Bcl-B, demonstrated only slight resistance to these apoptotic stimuli (Fig. 3, D and E). These data thus demonstrate that Bcl-B can suppress apoptosis induced by exogenous stimuli if expressed at sufficient levels. However, even HeLa cell clones with higher levels of Bcl-B did not manifest the profound resistance to apoptosis seen in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells (Figs. 3,D and E). Many Bcl-2 family proteins associate with mitochondria in cells (reviewed in Refs. 1Reed J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3225-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar and 2Reed J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1415-1430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of GFP-tagged Bcl-B in cells revealed a punctate cytosolic pattern and partial co-localization with a mitochondria-specific dye (MitoTracker), as determined by two-color confocal microscopy (Fig.4 A). Crude subcellular fractionation analysis revealed that Myc-tagged Bcl-B protein resides predominantly in the mitochondria-containing HM fraction, similar to Bcl-2, as determined by immunoblot analysis of the cellular fractions (Fig. 4, B and C). In contrast to full-length Bcl-B, a truncation mutant of Bcl-B lacking the carboxyl-terminal TM domain (Bcl-BΔTM) targeted less efficiently to the HM fraction (Fig.4 D). The Bcl-BΔTM protein also was ineffective at blocking Bax-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4 E), even though this protein was produced at comparable levels with the full-length Bcl-B protein. Thus, efficient organellar targeting appears to be required for optimal function of Bcl-B. We describe a new member of the human Bcl-2 family protein, Bcl-B. This protein is most similar in amino acid sequence to the murine Boo (Diva) protein and the most similar among all human Bcl-2 family proteins to the CED9 protein of Caenorhabditis elegans. The Boo (Diva) protein interacts selectively with some Bcl-2 family proteins but not others, although controversy exists as to the details (9Song Q. Kuang Y. Dixit V.M. Vincenz C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 10Inohara N. Gourley T.S. Carrio R. Muniz M. Merino J. Garcia I. Koseki T. Hu Y. Chen S. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32479-32486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Interestingly, one report has suggested that the Boo protein can bind Bak but not Bax, and accordingly provided evidence that Boo suppresses apoptosis induced by overexpression of Bak but not Bax (10Inohara N. Gourley T.S. Carrio R. Muniz M. Merino J. Garcia I. Koseki T. Hu Y. Chen S. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32479-32486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Conversely, we observed that Bcl-B selectively binds and suppresses apoptosis induction by Bax, but fails to interact with or negate apoptosis triggered by Bak overexpression. The murine Boo (Diva) protein has been variably reported to either suppress or promote apoptosis (9Song Q. Kuang Y. Dixit V.M. Vincenz C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 10Inohara N. Gourley T.S. Carrio R. Muniz M. Merino J. Garcia I. Koseki T. Hu Y. Chen S. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32479-32486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In transient transfection assays performed in four different human tumor cell lines, we consistently observed an anti-apoptotic action of Bcl-B. Stable overexpression of Bcl-B in HeLa cells also resulted in increased resistance to diverse apoptotic stimuli. However, because Bcl-B is capable of associating with either the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL or with the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, it is possible that Bcl-B could display different phenotypes under some circumstances depending on cellular context. A similar phenomenon has been reported for some other Bcl-2 family proteins. For example, Bcl-2 can reportedly promote apoptosis in photoreceptor cells of the retina, while Bax can suppress cell death in some types of neurons (11Chen J. Flannery J.G. LaVail M.M. Steinberg R.H. Xu J. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7042-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 12Middleton G. Nunez G. Davies A.M. Development ( Camb. ). 1996; 122: 695-701PubMed Google Scholar). Although stably transfected clones of HeLa cells, which contained higher levels of Bcl-B, exhibited resistance to exogenous apoptotic stimuli, the resistance afforded by Bcl-B was not as profound as that observed for Bcl-2 overexpression. This difference in potency of Bcl-B could be due to variations in the relative amounts of Bcl-B and Bcl-2 produced in transfected cells, or it could reflect a fundamental difference in the mechanisms of these proteins. In this regard, because Bcl-2 blocks cell death induced by both Bax and Bak, whereas Bcl-B inhibits apoptosis induced only by Bax but not Bak, it seems likely that Bcl-B may be less efficacious under circumstances where both Bax and Bak contribute to apoptosis induction. Bcl-B therefore may provide a mechanism for selectively inhibiting Bax-dependent apoptotic processes in vivo, while allowing Bak-dependent cell death to proceed normally. The mouse Boo (Diva) protein was reported to associate with the caspase-activating Apaf1 protein (a homologue of C. elegansCED-4) (9Song Q. Kuang Y. Dixit V.M. Vincenz C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 10Inohara N. Gourley T.S. Carrio R. Muniz M. Merino J. Garcia I. Koseki T. Hu Y. Chen S. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32479-32486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Although we have observed weak interactions of Bcl-B with Apaf1 in co-immunoprecipitation assays, functional analysis has failed to reveal an effect of Bcl-B on Apaf1-induced apoptosis (not shown). Since Apaf1 is a soluble cytosolic protein (13Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar), the inability of Bcl-BΔTM to suppress Bax-induced apoptosis also suggests that Bcl-B does not play a significant role in suppressing Apaf1. Moreover, the observation that Bcl-B suppresses apoptosis induced by Bax but not Bak also argues against a role for Bcl-B as an Apaf1 suppresser, given that both Bax and Bak induce mitochondrial release of the Apaf1 activator, cytochrome c (14Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar, 15Jürgensmeier J.M. Xie Z. Deveraux Q. Ellerby L. Bredesen D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 5: 4997-5002Crossref Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). The correlation between membrane targeting and function is reminiscent of some other Bcl-2 family proteins and suggests that the site of action of Bcl-B is close to the intracellular organelles, including mitochondria, with which it associates. Although roughly half of the Bcl-BΔTM protein was associated with the HM membrane fraction in cells, this may be due to its dimerization with other resident Bcl-2 family proteins. A membrane site of action for Bcl-B would be consistent with evidence that several Bcl-2 family proteins are capable of forming ion channels or pores in membranes (reviewed in Ref. 16Gross A. McDonnell J. Korsmeyer S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3254) Google Scholar). Indeed, molecular modeling of Bcl-B on the structure of Bcl-XL suggests that it possesses a similar overall fold and that it contains amphipathic α-helices similar to the putative pore-forming α5 and α6 of Bcl-XL (not shown). The differences observed in the functions and protein interaction partners of murine Boo and human Bcl-B proteins suggest that Bcl-B does not represent the human orthologue of mouse Boo/Diva. Also consistent with this interpretation is the difference in the patterns of expression of Bcl-B and Boo. Whereas Boo (Diva) is expressed predominantly in ovary, testis, and epididymis in adult mice (9Song Q. Kuang Y. Dixit V.M. Vincenz C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 10Inohara N. Gourley T.S. Carrio R. Muniz M. Merino J. Garcia I. Koseki T. Hu Y. Chen S. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32479-32486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), RT-PCR analysis suggests that the BCL-B mRNA is widely expressed in adult human tissues. Comparisons of the sequence ofBCL-B cDNAs with human genome sequence data indicate that the BCL-B gene is comprised of two exons interrupted by a ∼2.3-kb intron. Interestingly, the location of this intron corresponds precisely to the intronic interruption in the coding region of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 and BCL-X genes (corresponding to the motif GGW^D or GGW/D in BH2 (see Fig. 1 B). (The genomic sequence of murineboo/diva is unfortunately unavailable for comparison.) In contrast to BCL-B, the pro-apoptotic genes BAXand BAK have more complicated exon-intron organizations, in which the coding regions of the gene are spread over 5 (Bak) or 6 (Bax) exons. The similar genomic organization of the BCL-2,BCL-XL, and BCL-B genes thus suggests they evolved from a common ancestor and indirectly implies a similar mechanism of action for their encoded proteins.While this manuscript was in preparation, the cDNA sequence of Bcl-B was deposited into GenBankTM(accession number AF285092) by L. H. H. Zhang (unpublished data)."

The INAP has ankyrin-repeat motifs and shares weak amino acid sequence homology with Bcl-3 and other IκB family members. The human genomic INAP gene found in the NCBI data base is located at chromosome 3q3.11. Northern blot analyses revealed that INAP was not expressed in any examined tissues without stimulation, but INAP expression was rapidly and transiently induced by IL-1 although not by tumor necrosis factor α nor by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in OP9 cells. Immunoblots with anti-INAP-specific antibody demonstrated that INAP was rapidly and specifically produced by IL-1 stimulation and was predominantly localized in the nucleus. Immunofluorescence stainings showed that the INAP newly synthesized by IL-1 stimulation was promptly translocated into the nucleus, and FLAG-tagged INAP forcibly expressed in NIH/3T3 cells was also specifically localized in the nucleus. The possible interaction of INAP with RelA/p65, NF-κB1/p50, NF-κB2/p52, C/EBPβ, and retinoid X receptor was examined, but we could detect none of these interactions in the nuclear extracts of IL-1-stimulated cells.

The classic form of NF-κB, the heterodimer of the NF-κB1/p50 and RelA/p65, is normally retained in the cytoplasm through interactions with inhibitor protein IκB. The IκB family of proteins includes IκBα, IκBβ, IκBε, Bcl-3, NF-κB1/p105, and NF-κB2/p100, all of which possess 5–7 ankyrin-repeat motifs (1Finco T.S. Baldwin A.S.

In contrast, IκBβ is degraded only when cells are stimulated with IL-1 or LPS, both of which cause persistent long term activation of NF-κB (4Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H.

Following degradation of the initial pool of IκBβ in response to IL-1 or LPS, newly synthesized IκBβ accumulates as an unphosphorylated protein that forms a stable complex with NF-κB and prevents it from binding to newly synthesized IκBα (4Thompson J.E.

This unphosphorylated IκBβ cannot block the nuclear localization signal of NF-κB, thus this NF-κB·IκBβ complex translocates into the nucleus.

Bcl-3 also interacts with retinoid X receptor (RXR) or activating protein-1 (AP-1) and functions as their transcription coactivator (17Na S.Y. Choi H.S. Kim J.W. Na D.S. Lee J.W. J. Biol.

However, the detailed characters of this unique IκB family member remain mysterious.Here we identified a novel IκB family member, termed IL-1-inducible nuclear ankyrin-repeat protein (INAP), of which expression is specifically induced by IL-1. INAP was found to be weakly homologous to Bcl-3 and localized in the nucleus like Bcl-3. We discuss here the possible function of this novel IκB family member.DISCUSSIONWe isolated a novel IL-1-inducible nuclear factor, INAP, which is related to the IκB family and the Rel family. It is well known that IκB family members bind to the RelA/p65·NF-κB1/p50 complex and prevents the complex from activating and translocating into the nucleus. Therefore, possible interaction of INAP with the RelA/p65·NF-κB1/p50 complex was examined by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analysis. However, we failed to detect the direct and/or indirect binding of INAP to RelA/p65 (data not shown). Furthermore, one of the most important factors induced by IL-1 stimulation is IL6, of which gene expression is regulated by C/EBPβ (NF-IL6), AP-1, and NF-κB (21Sanceau J. Kaisho T. Hirano T.

Therefore, we also examined the possible interactions of INAP with C/EBPβ and c-Fos/c-Jun in nuclear extracts prepared from IL-1α-stimulated OP9 cells. Once again, we could not detect the interactions of INAP with C/EBPβ or with c-Fos/c-Jun (data not shown). Moreover, the fact that Bcl-3, the protein most closely related to INAP, associates NF-κB1/p50 or NF-κB2/p52 homodimers and modulates their transactivation activities (11Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 16Bundy D.L. McKeithan T.W. J. Biol.

None of these interactions, however, was detected by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). It has also been reported that Bcl-3 binds to RXR (17Na S.Y. Choi H.S. Kim J.W. Na D.S. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30933-30938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or to AP-1 (18Na S.Y. Choi J.E. Kim H.J. Jhun B.H. Lee Y.C. Lee J.W.

We concluded that INAP could not bind to any of the binding partners with which Bcl-3 has been reported to interact and that INAP is a very unique protein in the IκB family and is clearly distinct even from the most closely related IκB family member, Bcl-3. To determine the biological function of INAP on IL-1 signalings it is very important to identify the INAP-binding proteins in the IL-1-stimulated nucleus by other means such as yeast two-hybrid screening, pull-down experiments, and far-Western screening.INAP was found to be a novel nuclear factor related to the IκB family, but by IL-1 stimulation INAP was newly produced and accumulated in the nucleus, rather than being degraded as were other IκB family members. From a gene expression point of view, INAP is quite a distinct protein from these family members. There exists no obvious nuclear localization signal in INAP, but it does exist in the nucleus. Furthermore, INAP was not phosphorylated no matter whether it was localized in the cytoplasm or nucleus, indicating that the phosphorylation status of INAP does not affect its subcellular localization.A few potential NF-κB binding sites were found around −340 bp upstream from the initiation codon in human INAP gene promoter regions. However, we demonstrated that INAP gene expression was rapidly induced by IL-1 but not by TNFα nor by PMA, all of which are known to activate the NF-κB signaling pathway. Thus, INAP gene expression is not simply regulated by NF-κB signaling. IL-1- and LPS-specific persistent activation of NF-κB has been reported (4Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H.

The mechanism is thus obscure at this moment, and further analyses are required.

There are presently five members of the mammalian NF-κB/Rel family, NF-κB1/p50, NF-κB2/p52, c-Rel, RelA/p65, and RelB (1Finco T.S. Baldwin A.S.

The classic form of NF-κB, the heterodimer of the NF-κB1/p50 and RelA/p65, is normally retained in the cytoplasm through interactions with inhibitor protein IκB. The IκB family of proteins includes IκBα, IκBβ, IκBε, Bcl-3, NF-κB1/p105, and NF-κB2/p100, all of which possess 5–7 ankyrin-repeat motifs (1Finco T.S. Baldwin A.S.

Following degradation of the initial pool of IκBβ in response to IL-1 or LPS, newly synthesized IκBβ accumulates as an unphosphorylated protein that forms a stable complex with NF-κB and prevents it from binding to newly synthesized IκBα (4Thompson J.E.

This unphosphorylated IκBβ cannot block the nuclear localization signal of NF-κB, thus this NF-κB·IκBβ complex translocates into the nucleus. The function of this complex in the nucleus is yet to be elucidated, and the mechanism by which only IL-1 and LPS can degrade IκBβ remains to be resolved.

https://openalex.org/W1999085242,"Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 is secreted as a latent form, which consists of its mature form and a latency-associated peptide (β1-LAP) in either the presence or the absence of additional latent TGF-β1-binding protein. We recently reported that three different missense mutations (R218H, R218C, and C225R) of β1-LAP cause the Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by hyperosteosis and sclerosis of the diaphysis of the long bones. Pulse-chase experiments using fibroblasts from CED patients and expression experiments of the mutant genes in an insect cell system suggest that these mutations disrupt the association of β1-LAP and TGF-β1 and the subsequent release of the mature TGF-β1. Furthermore, the cell growth of fibroblasts from a CED patient and mutant gene-transfected fibroblasts was suppressed via TGF-β1. The growth suppression observed was attenuated by neutralizing antibody to TGF-β1 or by treatment of dexamethasone. On the other hand, the proliferation of human osteoblastic MG-63 cells was accelerated by coculture with CED fibroblasts. These data suggest that the domain-specific mutations of β1-LAP result in a more facile activation of TGF-β1, thus causing CED.

Pulse-chase experiments using fibroblasts from CED patients and expression experiments of the mutant genes in an insect cell system suggest that these mutations disrupt the association of β1-LAP and TGF-β1 and the subsequent release of the mature TGF-β1. Furthermore, the cell growth of fibroblasts from a CED patient and mutant gene-transfected fibroblasts was suppressed via TGF-β1. The growth suppression observed was attenuated by neutralizing antibody to TGF-β1 or by treatment of dexamethasone. On the other hand, the proliferation of human osteoblastic MG-63 cells was accelerated by coculture with CED fibroblasts. These data suggest that the domain-specific mutations of β1-LAP result in a more facile activation of TGF-β1, thus causing CED.

In skeletal tissue, TGF-β1 serves as a systematic regulator that couples bone formation and resorption by regulating the function of the osteoblasts and osteoclasts (1Cooper M.S. Hewison M.

Gentry L.E. Purchio A.F. Moses H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1361-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 is ubiquitously distributed, and the activation of the latent form is likely an important step, because it exists as either a large latent form, composed of β1-LAP, TGF-β1, and latent TGF-β1-binding protein (LTBP), or a small latent form, which is devoid of LTBP (7Miyazono K. Olofsson A. Colosetti P. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1091-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, activation of the latent TGF-β1 is strictly controlled as follows. The large latent form is temporarily converted to the small latent form, which is then cleaved by plasmin or the plasmin-like protease to give the mature TGF-β1 (6Lyons R.M. Gentry L.E. Purchio A.F.

Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) or progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (DPD1) is an autosomal dominant disorder that is characterized by hyperosteosis and sclerosis of the diaphysis of the long bones (10Makita Y. Nishimura G. Ikegawa S. Ishii T. Ito Y. Okuno A. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 91: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The onset of CED is often during early childhood with severe pain in the legs, muscle weakness, a waddling gait, and easy fatigability. The patients occasionally suffer from systemic manifestations, such as anemia, leukopenia, or hepatosplenomegaly (11Crisp A.J. Brenton D.P. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1982; 41: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We, as well as two other groups, previously assigned the locus for CED to chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3 (12Ghadami M. Makita Y.

By a positional candidate gene approach and haplotype analyses, three different missense mutations (R218H, R218C, and C225R), which are located near the C terminus of β1-LAP, were found in nine CED families (15Kinoshita A. Takashi S. Tomita H. Makita Y. Yoshida K. Ghadami M. Yamada K. Kondo S. Ikegawa S. Nishimura G. Fukushima Y. Nakagomi T. Saito H. Sugimoto T. Kamegaya M. Hisa K. Murray J.C. Taniguchi N. Niikawa N.

In this paper, we report on the biochemical mechanism by which the domain-specific mutations of β1-LAP cause CED. R218H CED skin fibroblasts and normal skin fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), inoculated in 60-mm dishes, and then grown to near confluency. Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation procedures were performed as previously described (7Miyazono K. Olofsson A. Colosetti P. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1091-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Cells were placed in a cysteine- and methionine-free medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and incubated overnight. For pulsing, the cell culture medium was replaced with a medium containing [35S]cysteine (100 μCi/ml) and [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml), incubated for 15 min, washed with fresh DMEM, and then incubated for various periods. Media were collected, and 10 μl/ml of normal rabbit serum was added, followed by a further incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, and 15 μl/ml of rProtein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was then added. The resulting mixture was incubated for an additional 45 min at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The beads were spun down by centrifugation, and the supernatants were collected. Immunoprecipitation of these samples was carried out by adding 15 μl of LT-1 (β1-LAP antibody)-conjugated rProtein A-Sepharose, followed by an overnight incubation at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The beads were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, twice with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, and once with PBS. The proteins bound to the beads were eluted by the addition of 15 μl of SDS sample buffer, and the eluates were heated to boiling for 5 min at 95 °C. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE using 5–20% polyacrylamide gradient gels (Bio-Rad) under non-reducing conditions. The gels were dried and exposed to an imaging plate (Fuji Film).35S radioactivity was detected using a BAS2500 system (Fujix). To activate the latent TGF-β1 to the immunoreactive form, conditioned media were treated with 1n HCl for acidic activation and then neutralized with NaOH, according to the manufacturer's instructions (R & D Systems Inc.). A 1195-base pairEcoRI-XbaI cDNA fragment containing a full-length of R218H-, R218C-, C225R-, and wild-type-TGF-β1 were ligated into pFast Bac vector (Life Technologies, Inc.) and transfected to DH10Bac competent cells for recombination. Recombined Bacmid DNAs were transfected into Sf21 insect cells, and after 72 h, the resultant virus was amplified for 4 days on Sf21 monolayers in Grace medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) that contained 10% FBS. Virus stocks were then reamplified in Sf21 monolayers for 4 days. Fresh Sf21 cells were infected with reamplified virus and grown in serum-free Sf-900 (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 4 days, the recombinant protein was harvested from the Sf21-conditioned medium. Samples of each conditioned medium were concentrated to 3 mg/ml of protein using a Centricon−10 (Amicon; Millipore), and 10 μl of the concentrated conditioned media were subjected to SDS-PAGE in an 8% gel under non-reducing conditions. Each construct was recombined in a pRc/CMV vector. These vectors were transiently expressed in normal skin fibroblasts. The resulting cells were inoculated on a 96-well plate (2 × 103 cells/well) with or without a neutralizing antibody against TGF-β1 (R & D Systems Inc.). R218H CED skin fibroblasts were also cultured in the presence or absence of dexamethasone. After 48-h, 5 μCi/ml of [3H]thymidine was added, and 6 h later the cells were collected. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was determined with a β-plate counter. MG-63 cells, a transformed human osteoblastic cell line, were seeded at 1 × 104 cells/well (24-well plate) as the bottom wells, and R218H CED and normal fibroblasts were cocultured in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS at 5 × 103 cells/well using the cell culture inserts (pore size 3 μm; Falcon) as the upper wells. After 36 h, 5 μCi/ml of [3H]thymidine was added and incubated for 6 h. The MG-63 cells were then collected, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined with a β-plate counter. A hydropathy plot analysis of the domain involved in the mutations (R218H, R218C, and C225R) of β1-LAP suggested a working model in which CED mutations make conformational abnormalities of the C terminus of β1-LAP (data not shown). This domain is closely associated with the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds between two β1-LAPs at Cys-223 and Cys-225 that are needed to form a latent TGF-β1. To investigate the possibility that conformational abnormalities play a role in the processing of latent TGF-β1 in CED, the conditioned medium of skin fibroblasts bearing the R218H mutation, which had been metabolically labeled, was immunoprecipitated with an antibody for β1-LAP (7Miyazono K. Olofsson A. Colosetti P. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1091-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Analysis of the samples by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions revealed that a 100-kDa TGF-β1/β1-LAP complex (i.e. the small latent form) disappeared within 30 min, and only an 86-kDa β1-LAP homodimer band was detected in the R218H medium. Both bands were present up to 120 min in the normal medium (Fig. 1). However, neither the intracellular assembly nor its ability to secrete TGF-β1 appeared to be affected in the mutant fibroblasts, as judged from the manner in which the large latent form was processed. Moreover, no differences in plasmin or plasmin like-proteolytic activity, in terms of the conversion of the small latent TGF-β1 into the mature TGF-β1 (6Lyons R.M. Gentry L.E. Purchio A.F. Moses H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1361-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar,9Lyons R.M. Keski-Oja J. Moses H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1659-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar), were noted in either types of cells (data not shown). These observations suggest that the R218H mutation leads to the vulnerability of the small latent TGF-β1 and the subsequent release of the mature TGF-β1. To assess this hypothesis, the amount of mature TGF-β1 protein in the conditioned media of R218H and normal fibroblasts was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, which detects only the mature form (R & D Systems Inc.). Although there were no differences in secretion of the large latent form (Fig. 1) or the expression level of TGF-β1 mRNA (Fig. 2A) between R218H and normal fibroblasts, the medium from the R218H fibroblasts contained higher levels of mature TGF-β1 protein after a 48-h incubation than the normal fibroblasts (Fig. 2B). Because the mature TGF-β1 has a half-life of only about 2 min (17Wakefield L.M. Winokur T.S. Hollands R.S. Christopherson K. Levinson A.D. Sporn M.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1976-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), its concentration was very small. When the latent TGF-β1 was partially activated to give the immunoreactive form by acid treatment (9Lyons R.M. Keski-Oja J. Moses H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1659-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar), the detectable TGF-β1 in the R218H medium was more than five times that in the normal one (Fig. 2C). These results strongly suggest that the R218H mutation facilitates the dissociation of the mature TGF-β1 from β1-LAP, thus leading to the accumulation of mature TGF-β1. To study further the effect of mutations on the formation of the small latent form of TGF-β1, recombinant latent TGF-β1 proteins were prepared using a baculovirus expression system. In the conditioned media of Sf21 cells that had been infected with viruses containing the R218H, R218C, and the C225R mutant TGF-β1, the 100-kDa small latent complex was undetectable, and only the 86-kDa β1-LAP homodimer was observed (Fig. 3), whereas a recombinant wild-type TGF-β1 produced the small latent form. These results suggest that conformational changes of β1-LAP as a result of these domain-specific mutations lead to instability of the small latent form, which is consistent with the results observed in the CED cells (Fig. 1). An alteration in the activation of latent TGF-β1 in the CED cells is schematically presented in Fig. 5.Figure 5Schematic illustration of the activation of latentTGF-β1. The activation of latent TGF-β1 normally occurs via a three-step mechanism (large latent form → small latent form → mature form). In the mutants of CED, TGF-β1 does not form the small latent form. Therefore, the mutant TGF-β1 may undergo rapid activation and/or rapid turnover.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Finally, to study the effects of the β1-LAP mutations on TGF-β1 activity, the cell growth of the CED and normal fibroblasts and the transfectants that produce mutant β1-LAPs was determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA (18Hugl S.R. White M.F. Rhodes C. J.Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17771-17779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The growth of R218H CED fibroblasts was slower than that of the normal cells. Although the mRNA expression levels of the introduced TGF-β1 gene were similar (data not shown), the proliferation rates of R218H-, R218C-, and the C225R-TGF-β1 gene-transfected cells were slower than the empty vector or wild-type-TGF-β1 gene-transfected cells (Fig.4A). Furthermore, the suppression of growth in the CED cells and the cells to which mutant genes had been introduced were attenuated by a neutralizing antibody against TGF-β1 (Fig. 4A). There are some reports that experiential administration of dexamethasone and other steroids is found to be effective to CED patients (19Bas F. Darendeliler F. Petorak I. Sadikoglu B. Bilir A. Bundak R. Saka N. Gunoz H. J. Paediatr. Child Health. 1999; 35: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition, in vivo and in vitrostudies have indicated that treatment of dexamethasone brings about decrease of mRNA level of TGF-β1 (20Frank S. Madlener M. Werner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10188-10193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 21Fan W. Cooper T.M. Norris J.S. J. Cell Physiol. 1993; 156: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and that glucocorticoids alter bone cell activity and decrease bone mass by changing the local TGF-β1 actions in skeletal tissues (1Cooper M.S. Hewison M. Stewart P.M. J. Endocrinol. 1999; 163: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 2Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. Canalis E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4490-4496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied the effect of dexamethasone on the mRNA level of TGF-β1 and the proliferation of R218H CED fibroblasts. The mRNA levels of TGF-β1 in R218H CED and normal fibroblasts were reduced (Fig. 4B), and the suppression of growth in the CED fibroblasts was attenuated by the treatment of dexamethasone in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C). On the other hand, the proliferation of human osteoblastic MG-63 cells (22Subramaniam M. Oursler M.J. Rasmussen K. Riggs B.L. Spelsberg T.C. J. Cell Biochem. 1995; 57: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which were cocultured with R218H CED fibroblasts, was accelerated, and this acceleration was attenuated by treatment of dexamethasone (Fig.4D). Dexamethasone did not affect the growth of MG-63 cells when they were cultured alone (data not shown). These results suggest that TGF-β1 released from the CED fibroblast stimulated the cell growth of osteoblasts. Overall, these data indicate that the β1-LAP/TGF-β1 mutations observed in CED patients modulate TGF-β1 activity (Fig. 5). It is conceivable that a similar situation exists in bone tissues. Previous studies have indicated a strict regulation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts in bone tissues and that many factors are involved in this process (23Ducy P. Schinke T. Karsenty G. Science. 2000; 289: 1501-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 24Teitelbaum S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (3038) Google Scholar, 25Rodan G.A. Martin T.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1508-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 plays an important role in promoting bone matrix synthesis and in reducing matrix degradation and resorption in the diaphysis of long bones by inhibiting both the formation and activity of osteoclasts (1Cooper M.S. Hewison M. Stewart P.M. J. Endocrinol. 1999; 163: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 2Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. Canalis E. Mol. Cell.

The observations herein point to the importance of factors that regulate the activation of TGF-β1 in the bone matrix. In conclusion, the domain-specific mutations in β1-LAP/TGF-β1 play a role in Camurati-Engelmann disease by modifying the activation of TGF-β1. The present study may provide a new stimulus for investigating the pathophysiology and treatment of CED, as well as related disorders such as osteoporosis. We thank Drs. K. Miyazono, K. Hashimoto, and H. Yoshikawa for kindly providing the antibodies against β1-LAP, normal skin fibroblast, and MG-63 cells, respectively. We also thank Drs. H. F. Deutsch and K.

HA is the major non-protein glycosaminoglycan component of the extracellular matrix in mammalian bone marrow (8Gordon M.Y. Riley G.P. Watt S.M. Greaves M.F.

Cell. 1990; 61: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2169) Google Scholar). Association between HA and CD44 has been implicated in many physiological processes involving cell to cell or cell to extracellular matrix interactions. In particular, binding of HA to CD44 is a costimulatory signal in the activation of human T cell (12Galandrini R. Galluzzo E. Albi N. Grossi C.E. Velardi A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 21-31PubMed Google Scholar). In the same way, interaction between HA and CD44 has been shown to play a role during normal or autoimmune responsiveness by regulating murine B cell effector functions (13Rafi A. Nagarkatti M. Nagarkatti P.S. Blood. 1997; 89: 2901-2908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that HA stimulates the growth and differentiation of CD34+ umbilical cord blood cells into mature eosinophils (14Hamann K.J. Strek M.E. Baranowski S.L. Munoz N.M. Williams F.S. White S.R. Vita A. Leff A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: L301-L307PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the standard form of CD44 molecule (CD44s), the alternative splicing of at least 10 small exons, numbered v1 to v10, generates different variant isoforms (15Gunthert U. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 1993; 184: 47-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The overexpression of several CD44 splice variants in a variety of malignant tumors correlates with tumor aggressiveness. This supports the notion that interaction between CD44 and HA may play an important role in tumor growth and dissemination (16Knudson W. Biswas C. Li X.Q. Nemec R.E. Toole B.P. CIBA Found.

For example, a strong expression of CD44v6 correlates with a shorter survival of patients with acute myeloid leukemia or with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (21Legras S. Gunthert U. Stauder R. Curt F.

Blood. 1995; 85: 2885-2899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that CD44 function promotes metastatic mammary carcinoma cell survival in invaded tissue in correlation with an ability to bind and internalize HA (23Yu Q. Toole B.P. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1985-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Overexpression of human CD44 promotes lung colonization during micrometastasis of murine fibrosarcoma cells (24Kogerman P. Sy M.S. Culp L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13233-13238Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In vivo tumor formation by human lymphoma Namalwa cells can be suppressed by a soluble human CD44-immunoglobulin fusion protein (25Sy M.S. Guo Y.J. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). More recently, binding of HA to CD44 has been shown to reverse blockage of differentiation of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells providing a new therapy way in AML (26Charrad R.S. Li Y. Delpech B. Balitrand N. Clay D. Jasmin C. Chomienne C. Smadja-Joffe F. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). On the other hand, HA could act through a CD44-independent pathway. Indeed, it was suggested that HA stimulates growth of murine megakaryocyte progenitors by modifying the activity of several growth-regulating factors (27Han Z.C. Bellucci S. Shen Z.X. Maffrand J.P. Pascal M. Petitou M. Lormeau J. Caen J.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-2, and IL-6 could bind glycosaminoglycans (28Ramsden L. Rider C.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 3027-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), suggesting that this binding is likely to retain and concentrate the cytokines close to their site of secretion, thus favoring autocrine and paracrine activities. In the same way, it has been shown that IL-3 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor bind to glycosaminoglycans, suggesting that small amounts of growth factors synthesized by stromal cells can act in a paracrine pathway (8Gordon M.Y. Riley G.P. Watt S.M. Greaves M.F. Nature. 1987; 326: 403-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 29Roberts R. Gallagher J. Spooncer E. Allen T.D. Bloomfield F. Dexter T.M. Nature. 1988; 332: 376-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). More recently, hyaluronan has been shown to be a potent activator of dendritic cells from CD44-deficient mice, demonstrating that HA receptors are not required to mediate all the biological effects of HA (30Termeer C.C. Hennies J. Voith U. Ahrens T. Weiss J.M. Prehm P. Simon J.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1863-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Multiple myeloma is a neoplasia characterized by the accumulation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow compartment, where the microenvironment seems to be favorable for their growth and survival (31Bataille R. Harousseau J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The survival and proliferation of myeloma cells may be dependent upon both soluble factors and physical cell-to-cell contact between myeloma cells and stromal cells as well as interactions with the bone marrow extracellular matrix. In particular, IL-6, which is mainly produced by the stromal environment, is a major survival and proliferation factor for malignant plasma cells both in vitro and in vivo (32Chauhan D. Kharbanda S. Ogata A. Urashima M. Teoh G. Robertson M. Kufe D.W. Anderson K.C. Blood. 1997; 89: 227-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Klein B. Zhang X.G. Jourdan M. Boiron J.M. Portier M. Lu Z.Y. Wijdenes J.

Tu Y. Fady C. Vescio R. Berenson J. Cell Immunol. 1995; 162: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). IL-6 production by stromal cells from patients with multiple myeloma has been shown partly mediated by cell surface molecules such CD56, fibronectin, and especially CD44 (36Barille S. Collette M. Bataille R. Amiot M. Blood. 1995; 86: 3151-3159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Lokhorst H.M. Lamme T. de Smet M. Klein S. de Weger R.A. van Oers R. Bloem A.C. Blood. 1994; 84: 2269-2277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that CD44 could be important in the physiopathology of multiple myeloma. Indeed, the expression of v9 containing CD44 isoforms is related to a short overall survival in multiple myeloma (38Stauder R. Van Driel M. Schwarzler C. Thaler J. Lokhorst H.M. Kreuser E.D. Bloem A.C. Gunthert U. Eisterer W. Blood. 1996; 88: 3101-3108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39van Driel M. Gunthert U. Stauder R. Joling P. Lokhorst H.M. Bloem A.C. Leukemia ( Baltimore ). 1998; 12: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, the expression of the standard form of CD44 is strongly decreased on myeloma plasma cells and nonmalignant B cells in affected bone marrow of myeloma patients (39van Driel M. Gunthert U. Stauder R. Joling P. Lokhorst H.M. Bloem A.C. Leukemia ( Baltimore ). 1998; 12: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). On the same way, an abnormally low or high concentration of HA in the serum of patients with multiple myeloma is associated with a significantly shorter median survival than those with an intermediate HA concentration (40Dahl I.M. Turesson I. Holmberg E. Lilja K. Blood. 1999; 93: 4144-4148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we have analyzed the ability of HA to promote growth and survival of myeloma cells. Human myeloma cell lines obtained from patients with the terminal phase of the disease (41Zhang X.G. Gaillard J.P. Robillard N. Lu Z.Y. Gu Z.J. Jourdan M. Boiron J.M. Bataille R. Klein B. Blood. 1994; 83: 3654-3663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) represent a good model to study the biology of tumor stem cells that are present in patients with chronic disease because they are still dependent on the addition of exogenous IL-6 to grow in vitro, similar to primary myeloma cells. In this report, we demonstrate that HA acts as a survival and proliferation factor of myeloma cells through an IL-6 autocrine pathway. These effects are partly mediated by a CD44-independent mechanism, suggesting that HA could retain and concentrate IL-6 near the plasma cells, favoring an autocrine loop. We also show that HA-mediated proliferation of myeloma cells is associated with a down-regulation in the expression of p27kip1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and a hyperphosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb). Because HA is a major component of the bone marrow extracellular matrix, these data support the idea that HA could play a major role in the survival and proliferation of myeloma cells in vivo. XG-1, XG-2, and XG-6 human myeloma cell lines (HMCL) were obtained from patients with terminal disease, as described (41Zhang X.G. Gaillard J.P. Robillard N. Lu Z.Y. Gu Z.J. Jourdan M. Boiron J.M. Bataille R. Klein B. Blood. 1994; 83: 3654-3663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The survival and growth of these cell lines are completely dependent upon the addition of exogenous IL-6. The cell lines were cultured in the presence of 5 ng/ml recombinant human IL-6 (Sandoz, Vienna, Austria) in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 5 × 10−5m2-mercaptoethanol. HA from umbilical cord and rooster comb and chondroitin sulfate A and B were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and ICN Biomedicals. Monoclonal anti-p27kip1 antibody (clone 57) was obtained from Transduction Laboratories, and monoclonal anti-CD44 antibody (clone J-173) was obtained from Immunotech, France. Monoclonal anti-pRb antibody was obtained from Pharmingen International. A3 blocking anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody was obtained from Dr. M-S. Sy (42Liu D. Sy M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1987-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody against α-tubulin (clone B-5-1-2) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. The BR3 anti-gp130 antibody was obtained in the laboratory. The BE8 anti-IL-6 antibody was supplied from Dr. J. Wijdenes, and the M195 anti-gp80 antibody was a generous gift from Dr. J. Brochier. Detection of IL-6 was performed with the IL-6 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay purchased from Beckman Coulter-Immunotech. Apoptotic cells were detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V method (FITC-annexin-V, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Annexin V has a high affinity for phosphatidylserine present on the outer cytoplasmic membrane of apoptotic cells (43Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4627) Google Scholar). Cells were washed, labeled with Annexin-V-Fluos according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and analyzed by flow cytometry. The cell cycle distribution of XG cell lines was assessed by flow cytometry analysis by propidium iodide (PI) and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) double-staining. The cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a medium containing 10 μm BrdUrd and then collected by centrifugation, washed twice with phosphate buffer saline (PBS), and fixed in 70% ethanol for 20 min at room temperature. After two washes with PBS, cells were resuspended in 50 μl of 3 n HCl, 0.5% Tween 20 and incubated for 20 min at 20 °C to denature the DNA. The cells were then recovered by centrifugation, resuspended in 250 μl of 10 mm sodium tetraborate to neutralize the reaction, washed twice with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and incubated with 20 μl of anti-BrdUrd-FITC according the manufacturer's recommendations. After two additional washes, the cells were resuspended in 500 μl of PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 containing 10 μg/ml PI. The fluorescence of FL1-H (BrdUrd) and FL2-H (PI) were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). The binding of HA on myeloma cells and the expression of CD44 molecules were quantitated by direct immunofluorescence staining using HA conjugated to fluorescein (HA-FITC) (44Liu D. Liu T. Sy M.S. Cell Immunol. 1998; 190: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) or by a monoclonal antibody to the human CD44 (Immunotech, Marseille, France). 5 × 105 cells were washed twice with PBS supplemented with 1% (v/v) FBS. The cells were resuspended in 30 μl of PBS, 1% FBS containing HA-FITC or CD44-FITC monclonal antibodies and were incubated for 45 min at 4 °C. The cells were then washed twice and resuspended in 400 μl of PBS. Fluorescence analysis was performed with a FACScan fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Becton Dickinson). The nonspecific binding of the FITC conjugates was determined in control samples using a mouse IgG1-FITC negative control (Immunotech, France). The cell preparations were analyzed by size, and 104 cells were evaluated for the percentage of positive cells and their fluorescence intensity. The amount of endogenous HA associated with the cell layer was quantified by indirect immunofluorescence staining with a biotinylated hyaluronic acid-binding protein (HABP-biot) (Calbiochem). 5 × 105 cells were washed twice with PBS supplemented with 3% (v/v) FBS. The cells were resuspended in 100 μl of PBS, 3% FBS containing 10 μg/ml HABP-biot for 4 h at 4 °C. The cells were then washed twice with PBS, and HABP-biot-labeled cells were revealed with streptavidin conjugated to phycoerythrin (Immunotech, France). The cells were then washed twice and resuspended in 400 μl of PBS. Fluorescence analysis was performed with a FACScan fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Becton Dickinson). The nonspecific binding of phycoerythrin conjugate was determined in control samples using streptavidin-phycoerythrin alone. The cell preparations were analyzed by size, and 104 cells were evaluated for the percentage of positive cells and their fluorescence intensity. The cells were cultured in 96-well microtiter plates with various concentrations of IL-6 or HA. Cultures were made in triplicate. 8 h before stopping the cultures, 0.5 μCi/well of [3H]thymidine (specific activity: 25 Ci/mm, ICN France, Orsay, France) was added, and the [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined as previously described (45Jourdan M. Zhang X.G. Portier M. Boiron J.M. Bataille R. Klein B. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 4402-4407PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (1 × 106) were resuspended in 50 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide-loading buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, and 50% glycerol) and incubated 5 min at 90 °C. The proteins were fractionated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After a blocking step, the membrane was incubated with the appropriate antibody and then developed using a chemiluminescent detection system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunofluorescence was performed with anti-CD44 monoclonal antibodies (diluted 1/200). To this aim, cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in PBS, and plated on polylysine-coated slides. The cells were fixed for 5 min in PBS containing 3.7% formaldehyde. CD44 was detected with an anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody conjugated to fluorescein. Slides were viewed using a Leika microscopic, and image files were processed with the Adobe Photoshop program. The means percentages of apoptotic cells were determined for the different culture conditions, and the statistical significance was evaluated by using the Studentt test for pairs. To investigate the effect of HA on myeloma cell survival, the XG-1, XG-2, and XG-6 cell lines, whose survival and proliferation are dependent on addition of exogenous IL-6 (41Zhang X.G. Gaillard J.P. Robillard N. Lu Z.Y. Gu Z.J. Jourdan M. Boiron J.M. Bataille R. Klein B. Blood. 1994; 83: 3654-3663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were starved of IL-6 and then cultured with various concentrations of HA or with 5 ng/ml IL-6. Because cells underwent necrosis when cultured after 4 days without IL-6 (46Ferlin-Bezombes M. Jourdan M. Liautard J. Brochier J. Rossi J.F. Klein B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2692-2699PubMed Google Scholar), the percentage of apoptotic cells was evaluated on day 3 by flow cytometry analysis with the annexin V-staining method. For XG-2, apoptosis was evaluated on day 4 because this cell line is less sensitive to IL-6 removal. As shown in Fig. 1 A, 42% of XG-6 and 29% of XG-1 myeloma cells died by apoptosis within 3 days upon removal of IL-6, and 33% of XG-2 died within 4 days. The apoptosis was blocked by the addition of IL-6. These data are consistent with the differences in the IL-6 dependence previously described for each cell line (41Zhang X.G. Gaillard J.P. Robillard N. Lu Z.Y. Gu Z.J. Jourdan M. Boiron J.M. Bataille R. Klein B. Blood. 1994; 83: 3654-3663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of HA significantly reduced the percentage of apoptotic cells on the three cell lines tested (Fig. 1 A and Table I). Interestingly, the reduction in the number of apoptotic cells is more efficient for the XG-6 cell line, which exhibited the higher sensitivity to IL-6 depletion. This experiment was reproduced several times with three HA preparations of two different origins. The mean values and the statistical significance of these experiments are presented in Table I. The survival activity of HA began to be detected with 5 μg/ml HA (Fig. 1 B). An optimal survival effect was obtained for each cell line with HA concentrations ranging between 50 and 80 μg/ml (Fig. 1 B). Because HA preparations may be usually contaminated with chondroitin sulfate A and B, we have tested the effect of these two sulfated glycosaminoglycans on the survival of myeloma cells. In the same experimental conditions, the survival of myeloma cells was unaffected by the addition of each of these components (data not shown). In addition, no significant loss in HA-mediated survival activity was observed with HA previously incubated for 10 min at 95 °C, and no presence of IL-6 was detected in HA preparations by using an IL-6 immunoassay (data not shown). These data indicate that the survival of myeloma cells in the presence of HA preparations was due to HA and not to a contaminating protein or glycan. We have then analyzed the kinetics of survival induction using the XG-6 cell line and a HA concentration of 80 μg/ml. As shown in Fig. 1 C, HA-induced survival was clearly observed after 48 h of culture, 29% of apoptosis without HA versus 20% with HA, whereas no significant effect was detected at 24 h of culture. The maximal effect was observed at 96 h (65 versus 32%).Table IHA is a survival factor for human myeloma cellsCell lines% apoptotic cellsnp+IL-6−IL-6−IL-6 +HAXG-115.6 ± 1.931.4 ± 1.920.6 ± 3.560.0002XG-214.5 ± 1.030.0 ± 2.924.5 ± 2.740.0156XG-68.5 ± 1.747.5 ± 3.728.9 ± 4.290.0001The XG-1 and XG-6 cell lines were cultured for 72 h and XG-2 for 96 h in culture medium supplemented with 10% FCS in the presence or in absence of IL-6 (5 ng/ml) or in the presence of HA (80 μg/ml).

Because IL-6 is the major survival and proliferation factor for malignant plasma cells both in vitro and in vivo (32Chauhan D. Kharbanda S. Ogata A. Urashima M. Teoh G. Robertson M. Kufe D.W.

Berenson J. Cell Immunol. 1995; 162: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), we have investigated the ability of HA to support proliferation of myeloma cells in the absence of IL-6. To this aim, the cell cycle distribution of XG-6 cell line incubated for 72 h with or without IL-6 (5 ng/ml) or in the presence of 80 μg/ml HA were assessed by flow cytometry analysis with PI and BrdUrd double-staining. Cells were analyzed by size, and 2 × 104 cells were evaluated for their fluorescence intensity. To better show the cell cycle distribution, the non-apoptotic cells were gated and analyzed. In the presence of IL-6, 39% of cells (measured by the number of cells in the upper and lower right quadrants in each dot plot) were in the S phase of the cell cycle (Fig.2 A). Removal of IL-6 promoted an accumulation of cells in the G1 phase (number of cells in the lower left quadrants in each dot plot; Fig. 2 B), with a strong diminution of the number of cells in the S phase (11%), as previously described (46Ferlin-Bezombes M. Jourdan M. Liautard J. Brochier J. Rossi J.F. Klein B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2692-2699PubMed Google Scholar). In culture medium where HA was substituted for IL-6, a large increase in the percentage of cells in the S phase (22%) was observed concomitantly with a diminution of cells in the G1 phase (Fig. 2 C). These data demonstrated that HA is a survival and proliferation factor for myeloma cells. Interestingly, the kinetics of HA-restored cell cycle distribution (Fig. 3) was very similar to the kinetics of HA-induced survival, suggesting that HA-mediated survival of myeloma cells is coupled to the regulation of cell cycle progression. Similar data were obtained with the XG-1 cell lines (data not shown).Figure 3Time course of HA-induced cell cycle redistribution.

However, a lower expression of the standard form of CD44 associated with expression of various variant CD44 isoforms is observed on myeloma plasma cells, suggesting that an abnormal CD44-signaling pathway and/or CD44-mediated cellular adhesion is involved in multiple myeloma (38Stauder R.

https://openalex.org/W2143194676,"The mechanisms by which different classes of chemicals induce the same cytochrome P450 (CYP) or the same chemical differentially induces more than one CYP are not well understood. We show that in primary hepatocytes and in vivo in liver (transfected by particle-mediated delivery) two orphan nuclear receptors, constitutive androstane receptor and pregnane X receptor (PXR1), transactivate a CYP gene via the same response element in a xenobiotic-specific manner. The constitutive androstane receptor mediates the barbiturate activation of expression of CYP2B1 and CYP3A1. PXR1 activates both genes in response to synthetic steroids. To exert their effect the receptors bind to the same direct repeat site (DR4) within the phenobarbital response element of the CYP2B1 promoter and to the same DR3 site in the pregnane X response element of CYP3A1. The receptors are therefore promiscuous with respect to DNA binding but not ligand binding. Differences in enhancer half-site spacing may influence the efficiency of interactions between the receptor and the transcription machinery and hence form the basis for the differential induction of CYP2B1 and CYP3A1 in response to barbiturates and synthetic steroids."
https://openalex.org/W1975869862,"We provide convergent and multiple evidence for a CD26/CXCR4 interaction. Thus, CD26 codistributes with CXCR4, and both coimmunoprecipitate from membranes of T (CD4+) and B (CD4−) cell lines. Upon induction with stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF-1α), CD26 is cointernalized with CXCR4. CXCR4-mediated down-regulation of CD26 is not induced by antagonists or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 gp120. SDF-1α−mediated down-regulation of CD26 is not blocked by pertussis toxin but does not occur in cells expressing mutant CXCR4 receptors unable to internalize. Codistribution and cointernalization also occurs in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Since CD26 is a cell surface endopeptidase that has the capacity to cleave SDF-1α, the CXCR4·CD26 complex is likely a functional unit in which CD26 may directly modulate SDF-1α-induced chemotaxis and antiviral capacity. CD26 anchors adenosine deaminase (ADA) to the lymphocyte cell surface, and this interaction is blocked by HIV-1 gp120. Here we demonstrate that gp120 interacts with CD26 and that gp120-mediated disruption of ADA/CD26 interaction is a consequence of a first interaction of gp120 with a domain different from the ADA binding site. SDF-1α and gp120 induce the appearance of pseudopodia in which CD26 and CXCR4 colocalize and in which ADA is not present.

The physical association of CXCR4 and CD26, direct or part of a supramolecular structure, suggests a role on the function of the immune system and the pathophysiology of HIV infection. human immunodeficiency virus adenosine deaminase CXC chemokine receptor stromal-derived factor fluorescein isothiocyanate tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate monoclonal antibody phosphate-buffered saline phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate CD26 is a widely distributed lymphocyte activation antigen that displays dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity in its extracellular domain. The role of CD26 in HIV1infection has been controversial. Its postulated role as coreceptor for HIV entry (1Callebaut C. Krust B. Jacotot E. Hovanessian A.G. Science. 1993; 262: 2045-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) was rapidly contested (2Broder C.C. Nussbaum O. Gutheil W.G. Bachovchin W.W. Berger E.A.

A. 1994; 91: 9960-9964Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, it has been more recently shown that the expression of CD26 may modulate HIV infection by direct effects of dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity on the antiviral activity of several chemokines or by unknown mechanisms independent of peptidase activity (4Proost P.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).In fact, CD26 can cleave out NH2-terminal dipeptides from a protein with either l-proline or l-alanine at the penultimate position and several chemokines can be processed by CD26 (see Ref. 8De Meester I. Korom S. Van Damme J. Scharpé S. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 367-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar for review). For some chemokines proteolysis by CD26 does not affect the physiological activity. In contrast, truncation of RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) by CD26 leads to higher receptor selectivity and anti-HIV activity (9Oravecz T. Pall M. Roderiquez G.

Stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF-1α) also loses the NH2-terminal Lys-Pro dipeptide by the action of CD26. This processing significantly reduces the chemotactic and anti-HIV-1 activity of SDF-1α (4Proost P. Struyf S. Schols D. Durinx C. Wuyts A. Lenaerts J.P. De Clercq E. De Meester I. Van Damme J.

Morimoto C. Nagai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6331-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar).Besides its enzymatic activity, CD26 interacts physically with membrane-bound signal-transduction molecules. Thus, the group of Morimoto has reported that CD26 associates to CD45, a membrane-linked protein tyrosine phosphatase (12Torimoto Y. Dang N.H. Vivier E. Tanaka T. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2514-2517PubMed Google Scholar) and adenosine deaminase (ADA; Ref.13Kameoka J. Tanaka T. Nojima Y. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. Science. 1993; 261: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), which is a cytosolic globular protein that also appears on the surface of lymphocytes (14Arán J.M. Colomer D. Matutes E. Vives-Corrons J.L. Franco R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1991; 39: 1001-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the binding of iodinated ADA to CD26 is inhibited by HIV-1 particles and by the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120, with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. This inhibition is mediated by the C3 region of the gp120 protein and occurs in human T and B cell lines by a mechanism modulated by CD4 and CXCR4 expression (15Valenzuela A. Blanco J. Callebaut C. Jacotot E. Lluis C. Hovanessian A.G. Franco R. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3721-3729PubMed Google Scholar, 16Blanco J. Valenzuela A. Herrera C. Lluis C. Hovanessian A.G. Franco R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Given the functional relationship between dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity of CD26 and CXCR4, and the role of CXCR4 in gp120-mediated inhibition of ADA binding to CD26, we have studied the distribution of these proteins on the surface of human lymphocytes. In this paper we present evidence of a colocalization, coimmunoprecipitation, and comodulation of CD26 and CXCR4. On the other hand, there is a redistribution of these cell surface proteins by the action of gp120 or SDF-1α, which is the natural ligand of CXCR4. gp120-induced redistribution of CXCR4 and CD26 also affects cell surface ADA.DISCUSSIONIn this paper we demonstrate for the first time that CD26 and CXCR4 interact in primary lymphocytes from human blood and also in T and B cell lines. The CXCR4 natural ligand SDF-1α has the conserved NH2-X-Pro sequence (where X is any amino acid) at the NH2 terminus, which is a consensus sequence for substrates of dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity of CD26. It has been demonstrated that SDF-1α can be processed by CD26 (4Proost P. Struyf S. Schols D. Durinx C. Wuyts A. Lenaerts J.P. De Clercq E. De Meester I. Van Damme J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 9Oravecz T. Pall M. Roderiquez G. Gorrell M.D. Ditto M. Nguyen N.Y. Boykins R. Unsworth E. Norcross M.A. J. Exp.

Morimoto C. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore the CD26·CXCR4 complex is likely a functional unit in which the expression of CD26 on the cell surface may modulate SDF-1α-induced chemotaxis. Since SDF-1α is a natural antiviral agent (33Bleul C.C. Farzan M. Choe H. Parolin C. Clark-Lewis I. Sodroski J. Springer T.A. Nature. 1996; 382: 829-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar, 34Oberlin E. Amara A. Bachelerie F. Bessia C. Virelizier J.-L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Schwartz O. Heard J.M. Clark-Lewis I. Legler D.F. Loetscher M. Baggiolini M. Moser B. Nature. 1996; 382: 833-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar), the expression of CD26 can also modulate the activity of this substrate of CXCR4 against T-tropic strains of HIV.The fact that SDF-1α induces the cointernalization of CXCR4 and CD26 in all cells tested (Figs. 3 and 4) is also relevant. The SDF-1α-induced internalization of the CD26/CXCR4 module was not CD4-dependent, as we could detect that the level of expression of both molecules on the cell surface decreased with SDF-1α incubation in T, but also in B, cells. The specificity and physiological relevance of CD26/CXCR4 cointernalization was demonstrated by the lack of internalization in the presence of the antagonist P2G in primary lymphocytes and in cell lines. The cells expressing a chemokine receptor lacking the COOH-terminal part were also a suitable model to assess the relevance of the interaction. In fact, the lack of the cytoplasmic tail, which is known to prevent SDF-1α−induced down-regulation of CXCR4, also prevents internalization of CD26. These results indicate that treatment of lymphocytes with chemokines or agents that activate protein kinase C leads to the simultaneous internalization of CXCR4 and CD26, probably via the same endocytic pathway, as we have demonstrated for other interacting cell surface proteins (35Saura C.A. Mallol J. Canela E.I. Lluis C. Franco R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17610-17617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). SDF-1α-induced internalization of CXCR4 is mediated by coated vesicles (17Amara A. Le Gall S. Schwartz O. Salamero J. Montes M. Loetscher P. Baggiolini M. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). According to this, the blockade of the cointernalization by sucrose and by acetic acid further suggests that endocytosis of CXCR4 and CD26 follows the same endocytic pathway mediated by coated vesicles. Interestingly, after a long period of chemokine treatment, the codistribution of the two proteins inside the cell is lost. At 1 h of treatment CXCR4 is found homogeneously distributed near the plasma membrane (Fig. 3), which would fit with the rapid recycling reported for this chemokine receptor. In contrast, internalized CD26 is clustered in intracellular vesicles, thus confirming that the traffic of the two proteins after the cointernalization follows different routes. As reported previously, ligand-induced internalization of CXCR4 is not mediated by Gi proteins (17Amara A. Le Gall S. Schwartz O. Salamero J. Montes M. Loetscher P. Baggiolini M. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The assays performed in the presence of pertussis toxin indicate that blocking of G-protein-mediated signaling does not prevent the cointernalization. This interesting finding is evidence for a Gi protein-independent signaling pathway that regulates the SDF-1α-induced simultaneous internalization of the two proteins. To our knowledge this is the second example of ligand-induced cointernalization of a receptor and the enzyme that inactivates the ligand for the receptor (35Saura C.A. Mallol J. Canela E.I. Lluis C. Franco R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17610-17617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In these models of interacting proteins, the existence of membrane-bound and soluble forms of degrading enzymes is relevant. Thus, in addition to membrane-bound enzyme, soluble forms of CD26 are able to inactivate SDF-1α (4Proost P. Struyf S. Schols D. Durinx C. Wuyts A. Lenaerts J.P. De Clercq E. De Meester I. Van Damme J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 7Ohtsuki T. Hosono O. Kobayashi H. Munakata Y. Souta A. Shioda T. Morimoto C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). While the soluble enzyme could regulate circulating concentrations of SDF-1, the cell-bound enzyme should be responsible for the control of local changes in ligand concentration. Cointernalization of CD26 with CXCR4 might represent a second mechanism of control of CXCR4 signaling. Consistent with the results shown here, it has been reported that peripheral blood lymphocytes migrating toward SDF-1α show low expression of CXCR4 and CD26. This finding can be a consequence of a higher response to SDF-1α from CD26lowcells, but it could reflect a SDF-1 α-induced cointernalization of CD26 and CXCR4 (see Fig. 3).Iyengar et al. (36Iyengar S. Hildreth J.E.K. Schwartz D.H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5251-5255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have described that in peripheral blood mononuclear cells the addition of gp120 cause cocapping of CD4 and CXCR4 with subsequent pseudopodium formation. On the other hand, Feitoet al. (37Feito M.J. Bragardo M. Buonfiglio D. Bonissoni S. Bottarel F. Malavasi F. Dianzani U. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) described that gp120 from the syncytium-induced HIV-1 strain increased the cocapping of CD4 with some proteins, CD26 included. We here demonstrate that CD26·CXCR4 complexes are coredistributed into gp120-induced pseudopodia. Taken together, these results suggest that the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 induces the formation in T lymphocytes of pseudopodia in which the main virus receptor, the CD4, the coreceptor CXCR4, and the CD26 coexist.Although the importance of CD4 and chemokine receptors in the process of HIV entry has been extensively described, the role of CD26 in this process is still not well understood. Previous results of our laboratory (15Valenzuela A. Blanco J. Callebaut C. Jacotot E. Lluis C. Hovanessian A.G. Franco R. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3721-3729PubMed Google Scholar) described the inhibition of the binding of125I-labeled ADA to the CD26 by HIV-1 envelope gp120 and viral particles, suggesting that gp120 recognizes the ADA binding site of CD26. gp120 blocks binding of ADA to CD26 in a CXCR4-dependent manner (16Blanco J. Valenzuela A. Herrera C. Lluis C. Hovanessian A.G. Franco R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is possible that gp120 displaces ADA binding to CD26 in CD4-negative cells because of the presence of CXCR4. These results support the hypothesis (see Ref. 16Blanco J. Valenzuela A. Herrera C. Lluis C. Hovanessian A.G. Franco R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that gp120 has to bind to CXCR4 prior to its interaction with CD26 and the disruption of the ADA/CD26 interaction. In this report we confirm the gp120-induced inhibition of ADA binding to CD26, but we also demonstrate that gp120 provokes the release of endogenous ADA bound to CD26, and this happens without changes in the expression of cell surface CD26 (Fig. 11). These data would suggest that gp120 and ADA share a common binding site in CD26. As shown in Fig.9 B, when the FITC-conjugated gp120 incubation was done using nonfixed cells, the viral glycoprotein could produce some membrane protein rearrangements displacing cell surface ADA from CD26. However, when cells were fixed before the incubation with gp120, a marked colocalization between the viral glycoprotein and the cell surface ADA was observed (Fig. 9 A). It should be noted that fixation avoids any cell membrane protein mobility or redistribution. These results led to hypothesize the existence of a gp120 binding domain in CD26 distinct from the ADA binding site. This indicates that the gp120-mediated inability of ADA to bind to CD26 would be a consequence of a first interaction of gp120 with a distinct epitope in CD26. We detected two anti-CD26 mAb, 4H12 and 202.36p, raised against a different epitope from ADA binding center that decrease the binding degree of gp120. Both antibodies are, also, less effective in labeling CD26 when cells are incubated with the viral glycoprotein gp120. These results correlate with the hypothesis of an interaction of gp120 with CD26 at an epitope different from the ADA binding domain, and they also indicate a recognition of cell surface CD26 by the viral envelope protein gp120.Comodulation of CXCR4 and CD26 by SDF-1α, gp120-induced formation of pseudopodia in which ADA is not present, and the role of ADA in the development and function of the immune system (38Franco R. Valenzuela A. Lluis C. Blanco J. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 161: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) suggest that the ADA·CD26 and the CXCR4·CD26·ADA complex is important for the functionality of human lymphocytes. CD26 is a widely distributed lymphocyte activation antigen that displays dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity in its extracellular domain. The role of CD26 in HIV1infection has been controversial. Its postulated role as coreceptor for HIV entry (1Callebaut C. Krust B. Jacotot E. Hovanessian A.G. Science. 1993; 262: 2045-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) was rapidly contested (2Broder C.C. Nussbaum O. Gutheil W.G. Bachovchin W.W. Berger E.A.

However, it has been more recently shown that the expression of CD26 may modulate HIV infection by direct effects of dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity on the antiviral activity of several chemokines or by unknown mechanisms independent of peptidase activity (4Proost P.

In fact, CD26 can cleave out NH2-terminal dipeptides from a protein with either l-proline or l-alanine at the penultimate position and several chemokines can be processed by CD26 (see Ref. 8De Meester I.

For some chemokines proteolysis by CD26 does not affect the physiological activity. In contrast, truncation of RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) by CD26 leads to higher receptor selectivity and anti-HIV activity (9Oravecz T. Pall M. Roderiquez G.

Stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF-1α) also loses the NH2-terminal Lys-Pro dipeptide by the action of CD26. This processing significantly reduces the chemotactic and anti-HIV-1 activity of SDF-1α (4Proost P. Struyf S. Schols D. Durinx C. Wuyts A. Lenaerts J.P. De Clercq E. De Meester I. Van Damme J.

Thus, the group of Morimoto has reported that CD26 associates to CD45, a membrane-linked protein tyrosine phosphatase (12Torimoto Y. Dang N.H. Vivier E. Tanaka T. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. J.

Science. 1993; 261: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), which is a cytosolic globular protein that also appears on the surface of lymphocytes (14Arán J.M. Colomer D. Matutes E.

Given the functional relationship between dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity of CD26 and CXCR4, and the role of CXCR4 in gp120-mediated inhibition of ADA binding to CD26, we have studied the distribution of these proteins on the surface of human lymphocytes. In this paper we present evidence of a colocalization, coimmunoprecipitation, and comodulation of CD26 and CXCR4. On the other hand, there is a redistribution of these cell surface proteins by the action of gp120 or SDF-1α, which is the natural ligand of CXCR4. gp120-induced redistribution of CXCR4 and CD26 also affects cell surface ADA. DISCUSSIONIn this paper we demonstrate for the first time that CD26 and CXCR4 interact in primary lymphocytes from human blood and also in T and B cell lines. The CXCR4 natural ligand SDF-1α has the conserved NH2-X-Pro sequence (where X is any amino acid) at the NH2 terminus, which is a consensus sequence for substrates of dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity of CD26. It has been demonstrated that SDF-1α can be processed by CD26 (4Proost P. Struyf S. Schols D. Durinx C. Wuyts A. Lenaerts J.P. De Clercq E. De Meester I. Van Damme J.

Morimoto C. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore the CD26·CXCR4 complex is likely a functional unit in which the expression of CD26 on the cell surface may modulate SDF-1α-induced chemotaxis. Since SDF-1α is a natural antiviral agent (33Bleul C.C. Farzan M. Choe H. Parolin C. Clark-Lewis I. Sodroski J. Springer T.A. Nature. 1996; 382: 829-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar, 34Oberlin E. Amara A. Bachelerie F. Bessia C. Virelizier J.-L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Schwartz O. Heard J.M. Clark-Lewis I. Legler D.F. Loetscher M. Baggiolini M. Moser B. Nature. 1996; 382: 833-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar), the expression of CD26 can also modulate the activity of this substrate of CXCR4 against T-tropic strains of HIV.The fact that SDF-1α induces the cointernalization of CXCR4 and CD26 in all cells tested (Figs. 3 and 4) is also relevant. The SDF-1α-induced internalization of the CD26/CXCR4 module was not CD4-dependent, as we could detect that the level of expression of both molecules on the cell surface decreased with SDF-1α incubation in T, but also in B, cells. The specificity and physiological relevance of CD26/CXCR4 cointernalization was demonstrated by the lack of internalization in the presence of the antagonist P2G in primary lymphocytes and in cell lines. The cells expressing a chemokine receptor lacking the COOH-terminal part were also a suitable model to assess the relevance of the interaction. In fact, the lack of the cytoplasmic tail, which is known to prevent SDF-1α−induced down-regulation of CXCR4, also prevents internalization of CD26. These results indicate that treatment of lymphocytes with chemokines or agents that activate protein kinase C leads to the simultaneous internalization of CXCR4 and CD26, probably via the same endocytic pathway, as we have demonstrated for other interacting cell surface proteins (35Saura C.A. Mallol J. Canela E.I. Lluis C. Franco R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17610-17617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). SDF-1α-induced internalization of CXCR4 is mediated by coated vesicles (17Amara A. Le Gall S. Schwartz O. Salamero J. Montes M. Loetscher P. Baggiolini M. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). According to this, the blockade of the cointernalization by sucrose and by acetic acid further suggests that endocytosis of CXCR4 and CD26 follows the same endocytic pathway mediated by coated vesicles. Interestingly, after a long period of chemokine treatment, the codistribution of the two proteins inside the cell is lost. At 1 h of treatment CXCR4 is found homogeneously distributed near the plasma membrane (Fig. 3), which would fit with the rapid recycling reported for this chemokine receptor. In contrast, internalized CD26 is clustered in intracellular vesicles, thus confirming that the traffic of the two proteins after the cointernalization follows different routes. As reported previously, ligand-induced internalization of CXCR4 is not mediated by Gi proteins (17Amara A. Le Gall S. Schwartz O. Salamero J. Montes M. Loetscher P. Baggiolini M. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The assays performed in the presence of pertussis toxin indicate that blocking of G-protein-mediated signaling does not prevent the cointernalization. This interesting finding is evidence for a Gi protein-independent signaling pathway that regulates the SDF-1α-induced simultaneous internalization of the two proteins. To our knowledge this is the second example of ligand-induced cointernalization of a receptor and the enzyme that inactivates the ligand for the receptor (35Saura C.A. Mallol J. Canela E.I. Lluis C. Franco R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17610-17617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In these models of interacting proteins, the existence of membrane-bound and soluble forms of degrading enzymes is relevant. Thus, in addition to membrane-bound enzyme, soluble forms of CD26 are able to inactivate SDF-1α (4Proost P. Struyf S. Schols D. Durinx C. Wuyts A. Lenaerts J.P. De Clercq E. De Meester I. Van Damme J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 7Ohtsuki T. Hosono O. Kobayashi H. Munakata Y. Souta A. Shioda T. Morimoto C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). While the soluble enzyme could regulate circulating concentrations of SDF-1, the cell-bound enzyme should be responsible for the control of local changes in ligand concentration. Cointernalization of CD26 with CXCR4 might represent a second mechanism of control of CXCR4 signaling. Consistent with the results shown here, it has been reported that peripheral blood lymphocytes migrating toward SDF-1α show low expression of CXCR4 and CD26. This finding can be a consequence of a higher response to SDF-1α from CD26lowcells, but it could reflect a SDF-1 α-induced cointernalization of CD26 and CXCR4 (see Fig. 3).Iyengar et al. (36Iyengar S. Hildreth J.E.K. Schwartz D.H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5251-5255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have described that in peripheral blood mononuclear cells the addition of gp120 cause cocapping of CD4 and CXCR4 with subsequent pseudopodium formation. On the other hand, Feitoet al. (37Feito M.J. Bragardo M. Buonfiglio D. Bonissoni S. Bottarel F. Malavasi F. Dianzani U. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) described that gp120 from the syncytium-induced HIV-1 strain increased the cocapping of CD4 with some proteins, CD26 included. We here demonstrate that CD26·CXCR4 complexes are coredistributed into gp120-induced pseudopodia. Taken together, these results suggest that the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 induces the formation in T lymphocytes of pseudopodia in which the main virus receptor, the CD4, the coreceptor CXCR4, and the CD26 coexist.Although the importance of CD4 and chemokine receptors in the process of HIV entry has been extensively described, the role of CD26 in this process is still not well understood. Previous results of our laboratory (15Valenzuela A. Blanco J. Callebaut C. Jacotot E. Lluis C. Hovanessian A.G. Franco R. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3721-3729PubMed Google Scholar) described the inhibition of the binding of125I-labeled ADA to the CD26 by HIV-1 envelope gp120 and viral particles, suggesting that gp120 recognizes the ADA binding site of CD26. gp120 blocks binding of ADA to CD26 in a CXCR4-dependent manner (16Blanco J. Valenzuela A. Herrera C. Lluis C. Hovanessian A.G. Franco R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is possible that gp120 displaces ADA binding to CD26 in CD4-negative cells because of the presence of CXCR4. These results support the hypothesis (see Ref. 16Blanco J. Valenzuela A. Herrera C. Lluis C. Hovanessian A.G. Franco R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that gp120 has to bind to CXCR4 prior to its interaction with CD26 and the disruption of the ADA/CD26 interaction. In this report we confirm the gp120-induced inhibition of ADA binding to CD26, but we also demonstrate that gp120 provokes the release of endogenous ADA bound to CD26, and this happens without changes in the expression of cell surface CD26 (Fig. 11). These data would suggest that gp120 and ADA share a common binding site in CD26. As shown in Fig.9 B, when the FITC-conjugated gp120 incubation was done using nonfixed cells, the viral glycoprotein could produce some membrane protein rearrangements displacing cell surface ADA from CD26. However, when cells were fixed before the incubation with gp120, a marked colocalization between the viral glycoprotein and the cell surface ADA was observed (Fig. 9 A). It should be noted that fixation avoids any cell membrane protein mobility or redistribution. These results led to hypothesize the existence of a gp120 binding domain in CD26 distinct from the ADA binding site. This indicates that the gp120-mediated inability of ADA to bind to CD26 would be a consequence of a first interaction of gp120 with a distinct epitope in CD26. We detected two anti-CD26 mAb, 4H12 and 202.36p, raised against a different epitope from ADA binding center that decrease the binding degree of gp120. Both antibodies are, also, less effective in labeling CD26 when cells are incubated with the viral glycoprotein gp120. These results correlate with the hypothesis of an interaction of gp120 with CD26 at an epitope different from the ADA binding domain, and they also indicate a recognition of cell surface CD26 by the viral envelope protein gp120.Comodulation of CXCR4 and CD26 by SDF-1α, gp120-induced formation of pseudopodia in which ADA is not present, and the role of ADA in the development and function of the immune system (38Franco R. Valenzuela A. Lluis C. Blanco J. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 161: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) suggest that the ADA·CD26 and the CXCR4·CD26·ADA complex is important for the functionality of human lymphocytes. In this paper we demonstrate for the first time that CD26 and CXCR4 interact in primary lymphocytes from human blood and also in T and B cell lines. The CXCR4 natural ligand SDF-1α has the conserved NH2-X-Pro sequence (where X is any amino acid) at the NH2 terminus, which is a consensus sequence for substrates of dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity of CD26. It has been demonstrated that SDF-1α can be processed by CD26 (4Proost P. Struyf S. Schols D. Durinx C. Wuyts A. Lenaerts J.P. De Clercq E. De Meester I. Van Damme J.

Morimoto C. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore the CD26·CXCR4 complex is likely a functional unit in which the expression of CD26 on the cell surface may modulate SDF-1α-induced chemotaxis. Since SDF-1α is a natural antiviral agent (33Bleul C.C. Farzan M. Choe H. Parolin C. Clark-Lewis I. Sodroski J. Springer T.A. Nature. 1996; 382: 829-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar, 34Oberlin E. Amara A. Bachelerie F. Bessia C. Virelizier J.-L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Schwartz O. Heard J.M. Clark-Lewis I. Legler D.F. Loetscher M. Baggiolini M. Moser B. Nature. 1996; 382: 833-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar), the expression of CD26 can also modulate the activity of this substrate of CXCR4 against T-tropic strains of HIV. The fact that SDF-1α induces the cointernalization of CXCR4 and CD26 in all cells tested (Figs. 3 and 4) is also relevant. The SDF-1α-induced internalization of the CD26/CXCR4 module was not CD4-dependent, as we could detect that the level of expression of both molecules on the cell surface decreased with SDF-1α incubation in T, but also in B, cells. The specificity and physiological relevance of CD26/CXCR4 cointernalization was demonstrated by the lack of internalization in the presence of the antagonist P2G in primary lymphocytes and in cell lines. The cells expressing a chemokine receptor lacking the COOH-terminal part were also a suitable model to assess the relevance of the interaction. In fact, the lack of the cytoplasmic tail, which is known to prevent SDF-1α−induced down-regulation of CXCR4, also prevents internalization of CD26. These results indicate that treatment of lymphocytes with chemokines or agents that activate protein kinase C leads to the simultaneous internalization of CXCR4 and CD26, probably via the same endocytic pathway, as we have demonstrated for other interacting cell surface proteins (35Saura C.A. Mallol J. Canela E.I. Lluis C. Franco R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17610-17617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). SDF-1α-induced internalization of CXCR4 is mediated by coated vesicles (17Amara A. Le Gall S. Schwartz O. Salamero J. Montes M. Loetscher P. Baggiolini M. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). According to this, the blockade of the cointernalization by sucrose and by acetic acid further suggests that endocytosis of CXCR4 and CD26 follows the same endocytic pathway mediated by coated vesicles. Interestingly, after a long period of chemokine treatment, the codistribution of the two proteins inside the cell is lost. At 1 h of treatment CXCR4 is found homogeneously distributed near the plasma membrane (Fig. 3), which would fit with the rapid recycling reported for this chemokine receptor.

This discovery completes the identification of all the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A in bacteria. Coenzyme A (CoA)1fulfils a vital role in the normal metabolism of living organisms: it has been reported that ∼4% of all enzymes utilize either CoA, its thioesters or 4′-phosphopantetheine (1Lee C.H. Chen A.F. Everse J. Anderson B. You K. The Pyridine Nucleotide Coenzymes. Academic Press, Inc., New York1982: 189Crossref Google Scholar). As an essential cofactor of fatty acid synthases, polyketide synthases, and nonribosomal peptide synthases, 4′-phosphopantetheine functions as an acyl group carrier, activating carboxylic acids for biological Claisen reactions and the formation of peptides and esters. Acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA are key intermediates in energy metabolism, taking part in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. It is therefore surprising that three of the CoA biosynthetic enzymes have only recently been identified in E. coli (2Begley T.P. Kinsland C. Strauss E. Litwack G. Begley T.P. Vitamins and Hormones. Academic Press, Inc., New York2001: 157-171Google Scholar, 3Geerlof A. Lewendon A. Shaw W.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27105-27111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase (PPC-DC) catalyzes the decarboxylation of 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine (PPanCys) to form 4′-phosphopantetheine (Fig.1). From a mechanistic perspective this reaction proves to be particularly interesting as it is unclear how the stabilization of the carbanion intermediate is achieved. To study this enzyme we have repeated, with major modifications, the published purification of PPC-DC from wild-type E. coli(4Yang H. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4076-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Amino-terminal sequencing identified the dfp gene as coding for the protein having this activity. The flavin-containing Dfp protein was first identified from a temperature-sensitive mutant (dfp-707), believed to be involved in DNA and pantothenate metabolism (5Spitzer E.D. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 994-1003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Spitzer E.D. Jimenez-Billini H.E. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 872-876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the conditional lethality of the mutant was reported not to be a direct result of pantothenate auxotrophy, and its complete characterization was not achieved. While our work was in progress, Kupke et al. (7Kupke T. Uebele M. Schmid D. Jung G. Blaesse M. Steinbacher S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31838-31846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) also identified Dfp as havingPPC-DC activity by sequence comparison with EpiD, a lantibiotic-synthesizing protein catalyzing the decarboxylation of peptidylcysteine intermediates. We now report that the protein encoded by dfp also catalyzes the formation of PPanCys from 4′-phosphopantothenate andl-cysteine using cytidine 5′-triphosphate (CTP) as the activating nucleoside 5′-triphosphate. The protein releases CMP as the product of the coupling reaction, indicating the formation of an activated acyl-cytidylate intermediate. In addition, we show that the protein does not contain a covalently linked pyruvoyl group as cofactor as was reported previously (4Yang H. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4076-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).

PPC-DC activity was partially purified from 38 g of frozen E. coli B cells (Fermentation Facility, University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL) using normal protein purification methodology (TableI).

The resulting PCR product coding for Dfp from Met25 to the end of the protein was cloned into NdeI/XhoI-digested pET28a expression vector (Novagen). The sequence of the resulting plasmid, designated pCLK1210, was verified by automated DNA sequencing. The expression plasmid was transformed into the E. coli Tuner(DE3) strain (Novagen). E. coliTuner(DE3) pCLK1210 was grown in LB broth supplemented with 15 μg/ml kanamycin sulfate at 37 °C toA595 ∼0.6, and induced with 200 μm IPTG. After growing overnight at 37 °C, the cells were harvested, suspended in sonication buffer (5 mm imidazole, 0.5m NaCl, and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 10 ml/1 g of cell paste), disrupted by sonication, and centrifuged at 35,000 ×g for 30 min to collect the crude cell extract. This was applied to a 5-ml His-Bind column (Novagen). Weakly bound proteins were removed by washing with sonication buffer, followed by sonication buffer containing 100 mm imidazole. The protein of interest was eluted as a yellow band by increasing the imidazole concentration to 0.5 m. Elution was monitored atA280 and A450. Benzyl pantothenate was synthesized by alkylation of sodium pantothenate (1.00 g, 4.15 mmol dissolved in 15 ml of dry DMF) with benzyl bromide (494 μl, 4.15 mmol) by heating at 70 °C overnight. DMF was removed in vacuo, ethyl acetate (100 ml) was added, the organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous NaCl (3 × 20 ml), dried (Na2SO4), and the solvent removed. The product was purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel; ethyl acetate/hexane 2:1 to 4:1; 1.13 g, yield 88%). Dibenzylchlorophosphate was prepared in situ by reacting dibenzylphosphite (1.57 g, 6.0 mmol) and N-chlorosuccinimide in dry benzene (8 ml) for 2 h at 25 °C. The reaction mixture was filtered and added dropwise to benzyl pantothenate (615 mg, 2.0 mmol) dissolved in dry pyridine (9 ml) at −40 °C (dry ice/acetonitrile). After stirring at −40 °C for 2 h, the mixture was placed in a −20 °C freezer overnight. The reaction was warmed to 25 °C and then quenched with water (3 ml). The solvent was removed in vacuo, and ethyl acetate (25 ml) was added. The resulting suspension was washed with 1 mH2SO4 (2 × 5 ml), 1 mNaHCO3 (2 × 5 ml), and saturated Na2SO4 (1 × 5 ml), dried (Na2SO4), and the solvent removed. The resulting benzyl pantothenate 4′-(dibenzyl phosphate) was purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel; ethyl acetate/hexane 2:1), to give a clear oil (576 mg, yield 50%). Benzyl pantothenate 4′-(dibenzyl phosphate) (250 mg, 439 μmol) was dissolved in 90% aqueous methanol and hydrogenated at atmospheric pressure for 2 h in the presence of 10% palladium/carbon. After filtering and solvent evaporation, the final product (131 mg, quantitative) was dissolved in H2O, titrated to pH ∼6.5 with 1 m NaOH, and stored as frozen aliquots of a stock solution (50 mm) at −20 °C. 1H NMR (400 MHz, D2O): δ 0.70 (s, 3H), 0.77 (s, 3H), 2.43 (t, 2H), 3.31 (t, 2H), 3.43–3.45 (m, 1H), 3.64 (d of d, 1H), 3.82 (s, 1H). 4′-Phosphopantothenoylcysteine was synthesized by addingS-propyl thiopantothenate 4′-(dibenzyl phosphate) (50 mg, 93 μmol) (Ref. 8Martin D.P. Bibart R.T. Drueckhammer D.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 4660-4668Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, with phosphorylation step modified as above) tol-cysteine (12.4 mg, 102 μmol) dissolved in 102 μl of 1m NaOH and 900 μl of methanol. After stirring for 4 h, the solvent was removed under a stream of argon, 500 μl of 1m HCl was added, and the product was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 500 μl). The combined organic extracts were dried (Na2SO4) and the solvent evaporated under a stream of argon. The resulting residue was dissolved in ∼2.5 ml of liquid NH3 and sodium pieces added until the blue color persisted. Methanol (two drops) was then added, and the ammonia was allowed to evaporate. Ice water (1 ml) was added, followed by a suspension of Dowex 50WX8–100 resin in deionized water, until the pH of the solution was acidic. The suspension was loaded on a prepared Dowex 50WX8–100 column (500 μl) in a plastic pipette, the product was eluted with 2 ml of water, and the solvent was removed by lyophilization. The final product (30 mg, 80%) was dissolved in H2O, titrated to pH ∼6.5 with 1 m NaOH, and stored as frozen aliquots of a stock solution (18 mm) at −20 °C. 1H NMR (400 MHz, D2O): δ 0.64 (s,3H), 0.79 (s, 3H), 2.40 (d of t, 2H), 2.70 (d, 2H), 3.22 (d of d, 1H), 3.34 (t, 2H), 3.55 (d of d, 1H), 3.91 (s, 1H), 4.19 (t, 1H). The corresponding 14C-labeled substrate,PPan-1-[14C]Cys, was similarly synthesized on the same scale as above usingl-1-[14C]cysteine (∼0.4 mCi/mmol), prepared from l-1,1′-[14C]cystine andl-cysteine. The CO2 release assay was performed as described previously (4Yang H. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4076-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), with modifications. Assays were performed in unmodified microcentrifuge tubes, and all additions were made directly to the sample followed by immediate closure of the tube. Assay mixtures contained 10 mm DTT, 2 mmMgCl2, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, enzyme (∼2 μg) and either 3.0 mmPPan-1-[14C]Cys or 3.5 mml-1-[14C]cysteine in a total volume of 60 μl; if the synthetase activity was being assayed, mixtures also contained 2.5 mm 4′-phosphopantothenate and 3.5 mm CTP. The reaction was initiated by addition of the14C-labeled substrate (10 μl of stock solution,i.e. 21 mm cysteine or 18 mmPPanCys) to the rest of the assay components in 50 μl and stopped after 10 min at room temperature by addition of 100 μl of 5m H2SO4. The amount of CO2 released was determined as reported previously (4Yang H. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4076-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Efficiency of 14CO2 trapping was determined over the same concentration range as for the assay, using [14C]NaHCO3 as standard. Assay results were adjusted using the resulting standard curve (y = 0.70x −0.08, R2 = 0.99). Protein samples were desalted by loading onto reverse-phase protein traps (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA), washed with 2 ml of 2:96:2 methanol/H2O/acetic acid, and step eluted with 70:26:4 methanol/H2O/acetic acid. Mass spectra were acquired on a modified 6-T Finnigan FTMS with the Odyssey data system described previously (9Beu S.C. Senko M.W. Quinn J.P. Wampler F.M. McLafferty F.W. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 4: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), with nanospray sample injection (10Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). Specific ions were isolated using stored waveform inverse Fourier transform (SWIFT) (11Loo J.A. Smith R.D. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1988; 2: 207-221Crossref Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and assignment of the fragment masses and compositions was made using the computer program THRASH (12Little D.P. Speir J.P. Senko M.W. O'Connor P.B. McLafferty F.W. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 2809-2815Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Spectra were calibrated externally using bovine ubiquitin (Mr = 8,564.64). HPLC analysis was performed on reaction mixtures containing 1.5 mm4′-phosphopantothenate, 3.5 mm CTP, 3.5 mml-cysteine, 25 mm Tris, 2.5 mmMgCl2, pH 7.6, and 20 μl of purified enzyme (0.95 mg/ml in 25 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, pH 7.6) in a total volume of 500 μl. After standing at 25 °C for 4 h, protein was removed by centrifugation through a membrane (Vivaspin 500, Vivascience), and the reaction mixture was analyzed with a Supelcosil LC-18-T 3 μm, 15 cm × 4.6 mm inner diameter column (Supelco) on an HP series 1100 HPLC system eluting with 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 4 mm tetrabutylammonium hydrogensulfate. Elution was monitored at 254 nm, and identification was performed by comparison to CMP, CDP, and CTP as standards. Our procedure for the purification ofPPC-DC differed significantly from that previously published; it is summarized in Table I. Throughout the purification the protein exhibited a number of characteristics that hampered its isolation. These included copurification with proteins of high molecular weight and coagulation on concentrating membranes leading to large losses of activity. After solving these problems PPC-DC could be partially purified 1,280-fold as one of a small set of proteins (∼15% purity, the major contaminant (∼80%) being alcohol dehydrogenase (adhE gene product) as determined by NH2-terminal sequencing), the final fraction having a specific activity of 370 nmol CO2/min/mg. During the purification trials we observed that substrate analogs like 4′-phosphopantothenoylalanine and 4′-phosphopantothenoylserine did not inhibit PPC-DC activity in partially purified fractions. Furthermore, the high concentrations of PPanCys needed to saturate the enzyme, combined with the reported failure to detectPPanCys in cell extracts (13Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 370-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggested thatPPanCys was not the physiological substrate for the protein catalyzing its decarboxylation. The most likely alternative was to consider close interaction between the PPC-S andPPC-DC activities, and subsequently we tested 4′-phosphopantothenate, CTP, andl-1-[14C]cysteine as substrates. We found that 14CO2 was released from the reaction mixture, while cysteine was not decarboxylated in the absence of the other substrates. Our choice of CTP as activating nucleoside triphosphate rather than the more usual ATP was based on previous studies (13Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 370-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that had demonstrated that crude extracts from E. coli preferentially used CTP for 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase activity. However, it was not possible to determine whether these PPC-DC and PPC-S activities found in our partially purified fractions were located on the same protein, or on two distinct proteins which were copurifying, until the enzyme was purified to homogeneity. The proteins from the purified fraction with the highest specific activity were separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently electroblotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Determination of the NH2-terminal sequence of the band at 45.0 kDa gave SLAGKKILVLGV, revealed by a BLAST (14Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) search to correspond to residues 26–36 of the protein coded for by thedfp gene, annotated as a flavoprotein affecting DNA and pantothenate metabolism in an unspecified way. Amplification of the dfp gene (using ATG25as the start codon) from the E. coli genome by PCR and subsequent insertion of the product into pET28a gavepCLK1210 as the resulting plasmid. Transformation of this plasmid into the Tuner(DE3) cell strain, a lac permease deletion mutant allowing uniform entry of IPTG into cells and providing strict concentration-dependent control of induction, allowed the production of soluble overexpressed Dfp following induction at 37 °C with 200 μm IPTG (Fig. 2,lane 1). Expression in the BL21(DE3) host strain failed to produce soluble protein under a variety of conditions. The presence of an NH2-terminal 6 × His-tag made the purification of the recombinant protein possible by imidazole elution from a Ni2+-chelating affinity resin (Fig. 2, lane 2). Both the purification procedure and subsequent dialysis had to be performed at an ambient temperature as the protein precipitated at 4 °C. Solutions of the protein could be concentrated by centrifugation through a membrane if the procedure was carried out at 15 °C. The report of the first purification of PPC-DC from E. coli (4Yang H. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4076-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) claimed that the enzyme contained a base labile pyruvoyl group. We set out to determine whether we could identify such a post-translational modification by mass spectrometric analysis of the pure recombinant protein. The analysis of Dfp by high resolution ESI/FTMS showed that the protein had a molecular mass of 45,470.6 Da (Fig.3). This value corresponds exactly to the calculated mass of the recombinant protein with the NH2-terminal methionine removed (45,470.4 Da) and excludes the possibility that PPC-DC contains a pyruvoyl group or any other covalent post-translational modification. The purified protein exhibited a UV-visible spectrum characteristic of flavoenzymes, with a λmax at 455 and 378 nm. The identity of the flavin was previously found to be flavin mononucleotide (FMN) by TLC analysis of the denatured protein and comparison to standards (5Spitzer E.D. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 994-1003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed this finding by isolating the flavin cofactor from heat-denatured enzyme and subjecting it to ESI/MS analysis. The isolated product had an m/z value of 457.2 (M + H)+ corresponding to FMN (Mr 456.3 for the free acid). Further MS/MS analyses of the molecular ion confirmed this identification. No peaks corresponding to FAD molecular ions could be observed. Since our initial studies on partially purified mixtures of PPC-DC suggested that it was copurifying withPPC-S activity, we repeated our experiments with the purified Dfp protein. This enzyme catalyzes the release of14CO2 froml-1-[14C]cysteine in the presence of 4′-phosphopantothenate, CTP, and Mg2+, but not when any one of these cosubstrates was absent. Analysis of the reaction mixture by ESI/MS demonstrated the formation of 4′-phosphopantetheine. None of the other nucleoside 5′-triphosphates, i.e. ATP, GTP, and UTP, could substitute for CTP in the coupling reaction even at concentrations as high as 10 mm. The function of cytidylyltransferases in the formation of critical intermediates in the biosynthesis of lipids and complex carbohydrates has been studied extensively; these enzymes use CTP to form activated CDP-alcohols or CMP-acid sugars (Ref. 15Weber C.H. Park Y.S. Sanker S. Kent C. Ludwig M.L. Structure ( Lond. ). 1999; 7: 1113-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar and references cited therein). However, the utilization of CTP by enzymes to activate acyl groups in a transient fashion has, to our knowledge, not been reported. Furthermore, it has been reported that members of the family of cytidylyltransferases can be identified by the presence of certain conserved binding motifs, the HXGH and RTXGISTT motifs being the best examples (15Weber C.H. Park Y.S. Sanker S. Kent C. Ludwig M.L. Structure ( Lond. ). 1999; 7: 1113-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, Dfp from E. coli does not contain such a motif, or any other motif that has been associated with NTP binding. HPLC analysis of the products of the coupling reaction showed that CTP was converted exclusively to CMP. This indicates the formation of an activated acyl-cytidylate, which is subsequently attacked by cysteine (Fig. 1). This mode of action contrasts with that of the partially purified rat liver PPC-S (16Abiko Y. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 18A: 350-354Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), which was shown to produce ADP and phosphate as products of the coupling reaction, suggesting the formation of an acyl-phosphate intermediate for that system. Time course assays based on the release of 14CO2 by the Dfp protein demonstrated a linear increase of CO2 production for the first 10 min of reaction. We have therefore assumed that the average rate of a reaction quenched within this period of time is a close approximation of the initial rates of reaction. The accurate determination of the kinetic parameters was hampered by a number of factors. It was found that increasing the enzyme concentration above ∼30 μg/ml led to a rapid decrease in activity. Protein from which the His-tag had been removed by thrombin cleavage exhibited similar behavior (data not shown). Although leading to practical problems, the physiological significance of this observation is unclear, because the decrease in activity is only observed at levels of enzyme concentration above those expected to occur under normal cellular conditions. However, it does confirm the tendency of the enzyme to aggregate, a process hastened at lower temperatures. The enzyme also looses activity over time; this deterioration may be slowed by the presence of high (∼200 μm) concentrations of NaCl in the enzyme sample, but its presence negatively influences the determination of the kinetic parameters. Despite these problems, preliminary values for Kmand kcat were determined at ∼30 μg/ml enzyme, while maintaining nonvariable substrates at concentrations of at least 5 × Km (TableII). 4′-Phosphopantothenate shows substrate inhibition at high concentrations. The 2.7-fold higher value of Km(pPanCys), compared with Km(4′-phosphopantothenate), suggests that this intermediate is not the physiological substrate.Table IIKm and Kcat values of the PPC-S and PPC-DC activities of DfpSubstrateKmkcat2-akcat values are for the coupled (synthethase and decarboxylation) and decarboxylation reactions, respectively.μmmin−14′-Phosphopantothenate29053CTP290Cysteine240PPanCys780502-a kcat values are for the coupled (synthethase and decarboxylation) and decarboxylation reactions, respectively. Open table in a new tab The Dfp protein from E. colibears little resemblance to PPC-S and PPC-DC from mammalian sources: PPC-DC has been partially purified from both horse (17Scandurra R. Barboni E. Granata F. Pensa B. Costa M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 49: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and rat liver (18Abiko Y. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 18A: 354-358Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and in the case of the former, it was shown that the enzyme is pyruvoyl-dependent (19Scandurra R. Politi L. Santoro L. Consalvi V. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).PPC-S from rat liver uses ATP as the activating nucleotide, instead of CTP, and forms an acyl-phosphate intermediate as suggested by the formation of ADP and phosphate (16Abiko Y. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 18A: 350-354Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These differences between the key CoA biosynthetic enzymes in bacteria and higher organisms raise the possibility of exploiting the selective inhibition of the bacterial enzyme in the development of new antibiotics. Our identification of the Dfp protein from E. coli as having both PPC-S and PPC-DC activities leads us to suggest the renaming of the dfp gene as coaBC, in accordance with the nomenclature established for CoA biosynthetic enzymes and to accommodate the existence of separate orthologs, notably in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococci, encoding for CoaB and CoaC. This finding completes the identification of all the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A in bacteria."

The recent development of targeted gene repair, using synthetic DNA-RNA oligonucleotides (chimeraplasts), offers another possibility (14Yoon K. Cole-Strauss A. Kmiec E.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chimeraplasts contain short regions of correcting DNA bounded by long stretches of 2′-O-methyl RNA; hairpin loops and GC clamps are also incorporated to make the structure self-associating. These features promote strong, specific binding to the target genomic sequence and allow the DNA repair machinery of the cell to identify and correct the point mutation in situ (15Ye S. Cole-Strauss A.C. Frank B. Kmiec E.B. Mol. Med. Today. 1998; 4: 431-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Here, we apply chimeraplasty to recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells secreting human apoE2 and show that the gene conversion of apoE2 to apoE3 is stable and permanent at the DNA, mRNA, and protein level. In addition, we demonstrate gene repair in vivo, using transgenic mice overexpressing human apoE2, and also verify that the human genome can be targeted using lymphocytes from a patient homozygous for the ε2 allele. We conclude that it is feasible to correct the apoE2 mutation in patients with Type III hyperlipidemia by chimeraplasty. CHOdhfr− cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma), supplemented with 2 mm glutaMAX, 100 μm hypoxanthine, 16 μm thymidine, and 1% non-essential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.). Human apoE2 cDNA was cloned into p7055 (17Miloux B. Lupker J.H.

After 2–3 weeks of growth in Iscove's selection medium, which lacks hypoxanthine and thymidine, clones of CHO-E2 cells were isolated by limiting dilution; as controls, CHO-E3 cells were produced similarly.

Lymphocytes were isolated from the heparinized blood of a patient homozygous for the ε2 allele and immortalized with Epstein-Barr virus (20Negri C. Chiesa R. Ricotti G.C. Cytotechnology. 1991; 7: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Transformed cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma) and 2 mml-glutamine. The 68-mer oligonucleotides were synthesized commercially by MWG-Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany) with ten (fifteen for 88-mers) complementary 2′-O-methyl RNA residues flanking each side of the 5-base-DNA stretch; four Thr residues in each loop and a 5-bp GC clamp ensured that they self-associated into a double-hairpin structure. 24 h prior to transfections cells were seeded into 6-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well). Various concentrations (100–1000 nm) of chimeraplasts, preincubated for 10 min with PEI (ExGen 500; TCS Biologicals Ltd., Botolph Claydon, United Kingdom), usually at a 5:1 amine to phosphate molar ratio and in 50 μl containing 150 mm NaCl, were then added to each well of cells growing in 0.5 ml of serum-containing medium. After 2–24 h, the monolayers were washed with PBS, 2 ml of fresh medium was added for 24 h, and then cellular DNA was extracted. In certain experiments, we continued to passage and culture portions of the cells, in some cases to isolate clones by limiting dilution. Gene correction of APOE2 was studied in vivo using E−/−/hE2 transgenic mice. Here, the 68-mer chimeraplast (1000 nm) was preincubated with PEI (ExGen 500; 20× concentrated) in a final volume of 100 μl containing 5% glucose, and then the complex was injected into the peritoneal cavity of one mouse (treated); another mouse received PEI alone (control). Seven days later, the mice were killed, and their livers were snap-frozen before performing PCR-RFLP analysis on genomic DNA extracted from random biopsies. Genomic DNA (DNeasy kit; Qiagen) was extracted for analysis by PCR-RFLP, amplifying a 244-bp fragment by 35 cycles (97 °C for 1 min, 63 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min) with the primer pair, 5′-GATCAAGCTTCCAATCACAGGCAGGAAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GATCCGGCCGCACACGTCCTCCATG-3′ (antisense), and separating theHhaI-digested products either on 4% agarose gels or, more commonly, on 20% Tris-buffered EDTA polyacrylamide gels (NOVEX, Groningen, The Netherlands). Each genotype gave a specific combination of HhaI fragment sizes, and they are as follows: apoE2, 91 and 83 bp; apoE3, 91 and 48 bp; and a mixed population of apoE2 and apoE3 cells, 91, 83, and 48 bp (21Hixson J.E. Vernier D.T. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 545-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gene conversion frequency was estimated by scanning densitometry, normalizing the DNA in each lane to the 91-bp band, and using DNA from an E2/E3 blood donor as a standard. For automatic DNA sequencing of PCR products, the above sense primer was used on material purified on a 1.5% agarose gel. Poly(A+) RNA was extracted from cells using the QuickPrep Micro mRNA purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and after synthesizing first-strand cDNA with a RETROscript kit (Ambion, Austin, Texas), PCR amplification was carried out as described for genomic DNA. Human apoE secreted into culture medium was measured by a two-antibody sandwich ELISA, using a goat polyclonal anti-human apoE (DiaSorin Ltd., Wokingham, UK) for capture and biotinylated goat polyclonal anti-human apoE (Biogenesis Ltd., Poole, UK) for detection. The standard was calibrated human serum (YSI UK Ltd., Farnborough, UK), whereas streptavidin-HRP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB; Perbio Science UK Ltd., Tattenhall, UK) were used for color development. ApoE phenotyping was carried out by isoelectric focusing (i.e.f.) and immunoblotting (22Friedmann T. Sci. Am. 1997; 276: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), separating desialylated and delipidated proteins from culture medium or control plasma in a pH 4.0–6.5 gradient using 3% agarose gels. After blotting the proteins onto nitrocellulose membranes and immunolabeling with a monoclonal antibody against human apoE, the bands were visualized using goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP conjugate as secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Monolayers of CHOdhfr− cells were transfected with the selectable expression vector, p7055.E2, and 24 clones stably secreting human apoE2 (CHO-E2) were isolated. Seventeen clones secreted 0.5–2.0 μg of apoE/ml/24 h, and the four most productive were expanded (Fig. 1). In initial experiments, reagent concentrations and transfection times were varied, treating subconfluent CHO-E2–16 cells for 2–24 h with 100, 200, 400, and 600 nm of a 68-mer RNA-DNA chimeraplast (Fig. 2 A), complexed with PEI at an amine to phosphate molar ratio of 5:1. Cells were washed once with PBS, fresh medium was added for 24 h, and then DNA was extracted to assess apoE2 to apoE3 gene conversion by PCR-RFLP analysis. Clear conversion was seen at each concentration tested, although 400 nm was the most efficient (Fig. 2 B) with a conversion frequency of 37.7 ± 12.7% (mean ± S.D.;n = 8; range 14.8–54.8%), as judged by scanning densitometry. There was little difference between cells treated for 2 or 24 h, or on increasing the PEI to oligonucleotide ratio, although ratios >10:1 were cytotoxic. Importantly, the PCR-RFLP pattern was unchanged when CHO-E3 cells were treated with the chimeraplast (Fig. 2 B, lane 3), whereas an E3 to E2 chimeraplast as negative control did not affect the CHO-E2–16 cells.Figure 2Conversion of the apoE2 cDNA in recombinant CHO cells to apoE3 by chimeraplasty. A, the synthetic 68-mer chimeric oligonucleotide used is shown aligned with the homologous sequence in the human apoE2 gene. The 2′-O-methylated modified RNA residues arelowercase, and the DNA residues are capital; the centre DNA mutator region in shown in bold, and the bottom all-DNA strand is underlined. The apoE2 to E3 chimeraplast had X = C and Y = G, and the control apoE3 to E2 chimeraplast had X = T and Y = A; the single mismatched apoE2 to E3 chimeraplast had X = C and Y = A. The GC clamp is identified on the left by a nick in the sequence complementary to the 3′ to 5′ bridge. The targeted nucleotides in apoE cDNA aredouble-underlined, whereas the five nucleotides on each side, which were added to make the 88-mer, are singly underlined. B, a clear conversion of apoE2 to apoE3 (middle vs. CHO-E3 control cells on the right) was seen 48 h after transfecting recombinant CHO-E2–16 cells (left lane of this 4% agarose gel) with the 68-mer·PEI complex. C, this conversion efficiency was substantially increased by targeting CHO-E2–16 cells, previously treated with 68-mer·PEI (left lane of this 20% polyacrylamide gel), a second time (right). D, three additional CHO-E2 clones (numbers 7, 17, and 18; see Fig. 1) were also readily converted to apoE3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When CHO-E2–16 cells, previously treated with chimeraplast (400 nm for 4 h), were targeted a second time the initial conversion of 37.3% was increased dramatically to nearly 60% (Fig.2 C). To confirm that the apoE2 to apoE3 correction was not clone-specific, three other CHO-E2 clones (numbers 7, 17, and 18; see Fig. 1) were studied. Each clone was found to be efficiently converted to a mixture of apoE2/E3 cells with 400 nm of the chimeraplast (Fig. 2 D), and whereas treatment with 200 nm had little effect on line 7, the conversion of lines 17 and 18 was readily apparent (Fig. 2 D). Chimeraplasts of two additional designs were evaluated. The first, an 88-mer had 10 extra RNA residues to strengthen hybridization and potentially enhance conversion by the enzymatic mismatch repair machinery. This 88-mer was indeed found to give higher conversion, 23.3% at 400 nmcompared with 14.8% by our standard 68-mer (Fig. 3 A). A second chimeraplast with only a single mismatch (in the all-DNA strand) against the targeted double-stranded apoE DNA (Fig. 2 A) was also examined, but, though effective at both 400 and 200 nm(47.7 and 16.7%; see Fig.3 B), it proved inferior to the standard double-mismatched 68-mer (54.8 and 45.8%; see Fig.3 B). Chimeraplast-treated CHO-E2–16 cells were passaged 12 times using 1:10 splits, and the apoE DNA was reanalyzed by PCR-RFLP; the gene correction of apoE2 to apoE3 was unchanged (Fig. 4 A,center lane). Next, the passaged cells were cloned, and after expansion and analysis of nine clones, three different genotypes were found; four clones were apoE2/3, three were apoE2 (uncorrected), and two were apoE3 (corrected). ApoE2 (line 8) and apoE3 (line 3) clones were then compared with the starting apoE2/apoE3 mixed cell population (Fig. 4 A). Direct DNA sequencing confirmed the genotypes, in particular that the apoE3 genotype had been created by chimeraplasty (Fig. 4 B). Moreover, the expected pattern for true apoE2 and apoE3 clones was found when polyadenylated RNA was analyzed by RT-PCR-RFLP (Fig. 4 C). Importantly, PCR-independent confirmation of gene correction was obtained by separating the secreted apoE isoforms using i.e.f. As expected, non-cloned apoE2/3 cells gave two bands, identical to a plasma control sample. By contrast, the apoE2 and apoE3 clones gave the predicted single bands separated by one charge unit (Fig. 4 D), confirming that chimeraplasty had produced a phenotypic change. The APOE2 gene was targeted in vivo by injecting 1000 nm of the standard 68-mer·PEI complex into a transgenic mice overexpressing human apoE2; a second animal received PEI alone. DNA extracted from liver was analyzed 7 days later, and about 25% of hepatic APOE2 was found to be converted to APOE3 (Fig.5 A). We also targetedAPOE2 within the human genome, treating cultured lymphocytes from a homozygous ε2/ε2 patient for 16 h with increasing concentrations (0–1000 nm) of 68-mer·PEI complexes (amine:phosphate molar ratios between 5:1 and 8:1). Although low chimeraplast concentrations were ineffective, a clear conversion ofAPOE2 to APOE3 was seen at 800 and 1000 nm with a 7:1 ratio of PEI to oligonucleotide giving the highest conversion (for example, using 800 nm, 34% conversion was seen versus 22 and 3% at 8:1 and 6:1, respectively; see Fig. 5 B). Diverse techniques are being developed to introduce transgenes into various tissues to express therapeutic proteins. There are many problems to overcome, achieving efficient gene transfer and specific gene delivery to target tissues, sustaining levels of gene expression, preventing adverse immunological responses, and ensuring safety, particularly with viral vectors (22Friedmann T. Sci. Am. 1997; 276: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). By contrast, when defective proteins result from point mutations in the wild-type allele, the genes that encode them can potentially be repaired by synthetic RNA-DNA oligonucleotides, termed chimeraplasts. Chimeraplasty, or targeted gene correction, is an exciting alternative to viral gene therapy. It has the great advantage of retaining existing gene promoters and enhancers and cell-specific context. Although a new technology, there is already evidence that chimeraplast-induced corrections are permanent and produce phenotypic conversions. Examples in vitro include the restoration of tyrosinase activity in melanocytes of albino mice (23Alexeev V. Yoon K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 1343-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and correction of the bs hemoglobin allele that causes sickle cell anemia (24Cole-Strauss A. Yoon K. Xiang Y. Byrne B.C. Rice M.C. Gryn J. Holloman W.K. Kmiec E.B. Science. 1996; 273: 1386-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Phenotypic changes are also reported in vivo using natural and transgenic preclinical models of disease, including rat and dog hemophilia B, which have defective clotting factor IX (25Kren B.T. Bandyopadhyay P. Steer C.J. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), the Gunn rat model of Crigler-Najjar syndrome (26Kren B.T. Parashar B. Bandyopadhyay P. Chowdhury N.R. Chowdhury J.R. Steer C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10349-10354Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and mouse and dog models of muscular dystrophy (27Rando T.A. Disatnik M.H. Zhou L.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5363-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 28Bartlett R.J. Stockinger S. Denis M.M. Bartlett W.T. Inverardi L. Le T.T. Man N. Morris G.E. Bogan D.J. Metcalf-Bogan J. Kornegay J.N. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). As the technique has also been used in bacteria (29Kmiec E.B. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and plants (30Zhu T. Peterson D.J. Tagliani L. St Clair G. Baszczynski C.L. Bowen B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8768-8773Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), there appears no obvious restriction to DNA sequences that can be targeted. Here, we have used chimeraplasty to correct a dysfunctional variant of apolipoprotein E, termed apoE2, that causes the genetic disorder of Type III hyperlipidemia. As established human cell lines secreting apoE2 are unavailable (we found that hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells (31Fazio S. Yao Z. McCarthy B.J. Rall Jr., S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6941-6945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and THP-1 monocyte macrophages (32Banka C.L. Black A.S. Dyer C.A. Curtiss L.K. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 35-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were derived from apoE3/E3 donors), we studied recombinant CHO cells. Initial experiments with 400 nm of a standard 68-mer chimeraplast consistently gave conversion efficiencies of about 30%, whereas retargeting substantially increased this number. Moreover, the correction was specific; CHO-E3 cells were unaffected, while an apoE3 to apoE2 chimeraplast did not convert CHO-E2 cells. Although short stretches of DNA can enter cells through endocytosis, we used PEI as carrier. This polycation is a very efficient delivery vehicle for plasmids and oligonucleotides in vitro (33Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5634) Google Scholar, 34Pollard H. Remy J.S. Loussouarn G. Demolombe S. Behr J.P. Escande D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7507-7511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar) and in vivo(35Boletta A. Benigni A. Lutz J. Remuzzi G. Soria M.R. Monaco L. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; 8: 1243-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar); it condenses the chimeraplast and inhibits lysosomal degradation so that nuclear targeting is improved (33Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5634) Google Scholar). As the cells initially studied, CHO-E2–16, contained apoE2 cDNA randomly integrated into the chromosome, it was important to discount a positional effect as overtly influencing the correction. This was affirmed by showing that three additional CHO-E2 clones were converted at comparable rates to the CHO-E2–16 line. Design was important in increasing efficiency, as a chimeraplast with a single mismatch in the all-DNA strand was less effective than the standard double-mismatched 68-mer. However, this finding does not corroborate an earlier report (36Kren B.T. Cole-Strauss A. Kmiec E.B. Steer C.J. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 1462-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) suggesting that the mismatch most efficiently repaired is the one created between the target and the all-DNA strand of the chimeraplast. An 88-mer chimeraplast also gave a higher conversion, presumably because the additional RNA bases strengthened hybridization and formed a more stable complex with the target sequence (16Kren B.T. Metz R. Kumar R. Steer C.J. Semin. Liver Dis. 1999; 19: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, this does not necessarily indicate greater practical value; the increased size of an 88-mer means a more expensive reagent that is also probably of lower purity than a 68-mer. Having established that chimeraplasts can target the apoE gene in our model system, we critically evaluated whether the technique might repair the apoE2 mutation in patients with Type III hyperlipidemia. First, we determined whether the gene correction was permanent and passed to future generations of cells and whether wild-type protein was secreted. Chimeraplast-treated cells were maintained in continuous culture for 2 months (12 passages at 1:10 splits) and then clones were isolated. PCR-RFLP analysis showed an unchanged conversion efficiency and the presence of corrected apoE3. Direct DNA sequencing and RT-PCR analysis confirmed that chimeraplasty had produced permanent changes at genomic and mRNA levels, respectively. Conveniently, the single nucleotide polymorphism distinguishing apoE2 from apoE3 results in an amino acid change, Cys-158 to Arg-158, and a charge difference between the two isoforms. This is exploited in routine phenotyping using i.e.f. to separate plasma apoE isoforms with detection by immunoblotting (37McDowell I.F. Wisdom G.B. Trimble E.R. Clin. Chem. 1989; 35: 2070-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We used an identical protocol to detect apoE secreted into culture medium and to monitor chimeraplast-induced conversion of apoE2 to wild-type protein. Our analyses confirmed the genotyping data; chimeraplast-treated CHO-E2 cells secreted both apoE2 and apoE3 isoforms, whereas the corrected apoE3 clone secreted only wild-type protein. Next, we assessed whether our chimeraplast could efficiently target the liver, which synthesizes >90% of plasma apoE (38Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3382) Google Scholar). We used an animal model of Type III hyperlipidemia, the doubly transgenic E−/−/hE2 mouse, produced by crossing transgenic mice overexpressing human apoE2 with apoE-deficient mice (18van Vlijmen B.J. van Dijk K.W. van't Hof H.B. van Gorp P.J. van der Zee A. van der Boom H. Breuer M.L. Hofker M.H. Havekes L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30595-30602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and observed clear conversion of hepatic APOE2 to APOE3. This was important; it established that another cell type can be effectively targeted and that the apoE2 gene, rather than apoE2 cDNA, can be corrected. We now have studies underway to confirm that this finding is consistent, to improve targeting efficiency, and to study any reversal of the hyperlipidemia and associated atherosclerosis. Finally, we also wanted to show that our chimeraplast could target the APOEgene in context within human chromosome 19. We achieved this by successfully converting EBV-transformed lymphocytes from a homozygous ε2/ε2 patient to the apoE3 genotype. Many inherited point mutations in liver-derived proteins are associated with hyperlipidemia and premature cardiovascular diseases, whether secreted like apolipoproteins, enzymes, and transfer proteins or retained like the LDL receptor. Nevertheless, apoE is a good candidate for generic gene therapy as it has multiple antiatherogenic actions, both within the circulation and at lesion sites (39Curtiss L.K. Boisvert W.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Indeed, adenoviral-mediated expression of apoE3 from liver significantly regresses early fatty streaks in the arterial wall, as well as advanced lesions (40Tsukamoto K. Tangirala R. Chun S.H. Pure E. Rader D.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2162-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 41Desurmont C. Caillaud J.M. Emmanuel F. Benoit P. Fruchart J.C. Castro G. Branellec D. Heard J.M. Duverger N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The apoE2 isoform has defective binding to the LDL receptor and LDL receptor-related protein, leading to impaired clearance of atherogenic remnant lipoproteins from the circulation (42Kowal R.C. Herz J. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10771-10779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoE2 is also much less efficient at sequestering cellular cholesterol than apoE3 (3Huang Y. von Eckardstein A. Wu S. Assmann G. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2693-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We predict, therefore, that using chimeraplasty to convert apoE2 into apoE3 will reduce progression of atherosclerotic lesions or even promote regression in patients with Type III hyperlipidemia; heterozygous apoE2/E3 subjects do not have premature atherosclerosis. Thus, our present finding that theAPOE2 gene can be targeted and efficiently converted toAPOE3, resulting in secretion of apoE3 protein, is significant. Furthermore, it implies that apoE4 can be converted to apoE3, an intriguing possibility as the ε4 allele is strongly associated with Alzheimer's disease and a variety of other neurodegenerative disorders (43Gasparini L. Racchi M. Binetti G. Trabucchi M. Solerte S.B. Alkon D. Etcheberrigaray R. Gibson G. Blass J. Paoletti R. Govoni S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 17-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Clearly, further studies in vitro and in preclinical models will be needed to realize such long term goals. We are grateful to several colleagues for the generous provision of reagents; we thank L. Havekes and K. Willems van Dijk for providing transgenic E−/−/hE2 mouse, P. Cullen and B. Pottinger for EBV-transformed lymphocytes, J. Breslow for human apoE cDNA, and B.

Several p53-responsive genes have been identified by using different approaches and various cell types (10Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Rago C. Kinzler K.U. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These p53-responsive genes include various functional categories such as those involved in apoptosis, cell cycle, signal transduction, angiogenesis, etc. (11Zhao R. Gish K. Murphy M. Yin Y. Notterman D. Hoffman W.H. Tom E. Mack D.H. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Induction of various genes by p53 is dependent on the type of inducer used, and even with the same inducer it may be cell type-dependent (11Zhao R. Gish K. Murphy M. Yin Y. Notterman D. Hoffman W.H. Tom E. Mack D.H. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However none of the members of the caspase family have been identified as a transcriptional target of p53. Here we report that human caspase-1 is a transcriptional target of exogenous, as well as endogenous, p53. In addition we have identified a site in the caspase-1 promoter that is required for transcriptional activation by p53. The cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a CO2incubator. The transfections were done using LipofectAMINE PLUSTM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions. All the plasmids for transfections were prepared by using Qiagen columns. Total RNA was isolated using TriZOLTM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc). Semiquantitative RT-PCR1 was carried out essentially as described previously (12Kamatkar S. Radha V. Nambirajan S. Reddy R.S. Swarup G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26755-26761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). RNA was reverse transcribed using reagents from an RNA-PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The GAPDH and caspase-1 mRNAs were amplified for 23 and 40 cycles, respectively, in the same reactions. The PCR products were analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide followed by Southern blot analysis for caspase-1. Primers for amplification of GAPDH mRNA have been described (12Kamatkar S. Radha V. Nambirajan S. Reddy R.S. Swarup G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26755-26761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Primers C1P2, 5′-CGAATTCAATGTCCTGGGAAGAGGTAGAA-3′, and C1P3, 5′-CGAATTCAAGGACAAACCGAAGGTGATC-3′, were used for amplification of human caspase-1 mRNA. Primers C1P4, 5′-AAGGAGAAGAGAAAGCTGTTTATC-3′, and C1P5, 5′-ATTATTGGATAAATCTCTGCCGAC-3′, were used to distinguish among α-, β-, and γ- or δ-isoforms of caspase-1. Cells grown in 35-mm dishes were transfected with 250 ng of pCAT-ICE, 150 ng of pCMV·SPORT-βGAL (Promega), and 500 ng of wild-type p53, mutant p53 (His273), or control plasmids. Lysates were prepared 30 h post-transfection from HeLa cells and 48 h post-transfection from MCF-7 cells using reporter lysis buffer from Promega according to the manufacturer's instructions. For CAT assay 40 μl of lysate was mixed with 2 μl of14C-labeled chloramphenicol (25 μCi ml−1; 54 mCi mmol−1) and 10 μl of acetyl coenzyme A (3.5 mg ml−1) in a total volume of 60 μl and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Relative CAT activities were calculated after normalizing with β-galactosidase enzyme activities. Double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the putative p53-binding site in caspase-1 promoter (Casp-1; see Fig. 3 A) was end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP. Nuclear extracts were prepared by high salt extraction of nuclei (13Hagenbushel O. Wellover P.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3555-3559Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Binding reactions with labeled oligonucleotide and nuclear extracts were performed essentially as described (14Foord O. Navot N. Rotter V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1378-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 4.5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 100 mm sodium chloride. Nuclear extract (4 μg of protein) was then added followed by addition of 2 ng of labeled probe (50,000 cpm). The reaction mix was incubated at 25 °C for 45 min followed by incubation at 4 °C for 15 min. A polyclonal antibody (1 μg) from Roche Molecular Biochemicals was included where indicated in the binding reaction. The promoter region of human caspase-1 gene from nucleotide position −182 to +42 relative to the transcription start site was cloned in pCAT-Basic vector (Promega) and designated as pCAT-ICE-wt (15Iwase S. Furukawa Y. Kikuchi J. Saito S. Nakamura M. Nakayama R. Horiguchi-Yamada J. Yamada H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Mutated promoter-reporter plasmid named as pCAT-ICE-mt was constructed using primers mut-1, 5′-GGGAAAAGAAATAAAGAAATTCATATGAATTCACAGTGAGTATTTCC-3′, and mut-2, 5′-GGAAATACTCACTGTGAATTCATATGAATTTCTTTATTTCTTTTCCC-3′, by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using overlap extension PCR (16Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the mutant, as well as wild-type promoter, in these constructs was confirmed by automated sequencing. The level of caspase-1 mRNA was determined by RT-PCR analysis in response to transient overexpression of human wild-type p53 in MCF-7 cells. Caspase-1 mRNA level increased severalfold by overexpression of p53 as compared with the control-transfected cells or untransfected cells (Fig. 1 A). This increase in the caspase-1 mRNA level was not the result of induction of apoptosis by p53, because treatment of MCF-7 cells with some apoptosis-inducing agents, staurosporine, and cycloheximide did not increase the caspase-1 mRNA level (Fig. 1 B). Treatment with staurosporine in fact decreased the level of caspase-1 mRNA. There are five isoforms of caspase-1 mRNA (17Alnemri E.S. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4312-4317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Using another set of primers, we found that the α form, which is proapoptotic, was induced by p53 (Fig. 1, C and D), and β, γ, and δ forms were not induced. By using appropriate primers we found that the ε-isoform was also not induced (data not shown). Examination of the nucleotide sequence of human caspase-1 promoter (18Cerretti D.P. Hollingsworth L.T. Kozlosky C.J. Valentine M.B. Shapiro D.N. Morris S.W. Nelson N. Genomics. 1994; 20: 468-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) showed a sequence homologous to the consensus p53-binding site at nucleotide position −85 to −66 relative to the transcriptional start site (Fig. 2 A). A caspase-1 promoter-reporter construct (pCAT-ICE-wt) containing this region (nucleotide position −182 to +42) was activated over 6–8-fold by cotransfection with normal p53 in MCF-7, as well as HeLa, cells (Fig.2, B and C). In these experiments the ratio of p53 to reporter plasmid was 1:1 with HeLa cells (Fig. 2 C) and 2:1 with MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2 B). At a higher ratio (2:1) of p53 to reporter plasmid in HeLa cells there was an over 12-fold increase in activation of transcription from this promoter (Fig.2 D). Mutant p53 (His273) did not activate this transcription in p53-negative HeLa cells, but in MCF-7 cells, which are p53-positive, it gave a small (less than 2-fold) increase in activity (Fig. 2, B and C). The control plasmid (pCAT-Basic) gave much lower activity and did not show any activation by p53 (data not shown). Mutation of the putative p53-binding site in caspase-1 promoter completely abolished transactivation by p53 (Fig.2 D). These observations suggest that there is only one functional p53-responsive site in this region (−182 to +42) of caspase-1 promoter. To determine whether p53 binds to the putative p53-binding site in human caspase-1 promoter, we carried out electrophoretic mobility shift assays using a synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to this site (Fig. 3 A). Binding to this oligonucleotide was seen with nuclear extract prepared from MCF-7 cells treated with doxorubicin, which is known to increase the p53 protein level (Fig. 3 B, lane 2). This binding was competed out with a 50-fold excess of unlabeled self-oligonucleotide and also with a consensus p53-binding oligonucleotide but not with a mutated oligonucleotide in which the p53-binding core sequence CATG was mutated to AATT (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 3–5). A polyclonal antibody to p53 immunodepleted the shifted band (Fig. 3 B, lane 6). These results suggest that the binding to this oligonucleotide corresponding to the putative p53-binding site in caspase-1 promoter is specific and dependent on p53. To address the role of endogenous p53 in regulating endogenous caspase-1 gene expression, MCF-7 cells were treated with doxorubicin, which increases the level of p53 protein. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with doxorubicin enhanced the caspase-1 mRNA level 4–5-fold (Fig.4). Similar treatment of MCF-7-mp53, a clone of MCF-7 cells expressing mutant p53 (His273) or p53-negative HeLa cells, did not increase the caspase-1 mRNA level (Fig. 4). The basal level of caspase-1 mRNA was higher in MCF-7-mp53 that decreased upon treatment with doxorubicin.The MCF-7-mp53 cell line was obtained by transfection of MCF-7 cells with the His273 mutant of p53 followed by selection with G418. This mutant of p53 is known to function as a dominant inhibitor of wild-type p53 function (19Aurelio O.N. Kong X.-T. Gupta S. Stanbridge E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Treatment of A549 cells (which have normal p53) with doxorubicin also resulted in an increase in the caspase-1 mRNA level (Fig. 4). These results showed that endogenous p53 can regulate expression of the endogenous caspase-1 gene. To determine the role of endogenous p53 in regulating caspase-1 promoter, MCF-7, MCF-7-mp53, and HeLa cells were transfected with caspase-1 promoter-reporter plasmid, and after 24 h they were treated with doxorubicin for 40 or 48 h. Doxorubicin treatment resulted in a 4–5-fold increase in caspase-1 promoter activity in MCF-7 cells but not in MCF-7-mp53 or HeLa cells (Fig.5). These results showed that endogenous wild-type p53 can also activate transcription from the caspase-1 promoter, which is inhibited by the His273 mutant of p53. Ectopic expression of caspase-1 is known to induce apoptosis (17Alnemri E.S. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4312-4317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 20Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartweig E.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). The wild-type p53-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells was partially inhibited (50% inhibition) by YVAD-cmk (which preferentially inhibits caspase-1) but not by the caspase-3 family inhibitor DEVD-cmk (data not shown). Doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells was also partially inhibited (45% inhibition) by YVAD-cmk and not by DEVD-cmk (data not shown). These observations suggest that caspase-1 contributes in part to p53-mediated apoptosis. Apoptotic pathways are cell type- and stimulus-specific, and it is likely that caspase-1, along with other transcriptional targets, may play a role in p53-mediated apoptosis at least in some cells. The primary role of caspase-1 is in the production of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β, interleukin-16, and interleukin-18 (5Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 6Zheng T.S. Hunot S. Kuida K. Flavell R.A.

Immunity. 1999; 10: 629-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Wild-type p53 is overexpressed in several inflammatory diseases (reviewed in Ref. 4Tak P.P. Zvaifler N.J. Green D.R. Firestein G.S. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 78-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), but its potential role in inflammation is not understood. Our results, showing that caspase-1 is transcriptionally activated by p53, suggest that p53 has a role in inflammation. Mutational inactivation of p53 in human tumors would, therefore, lead to reduced inflammatory response, in addition to resistance to apoptosis. S.

In this study, results show that UVA-induced phosphorylation of p90RSK at Ser381 through ERKs and JNKs, but not p38 kinase pathways. We provide evidence that UVA-induced p90RSK phosphorylation and kinase activity were time- and dose-dependent.

UVA-induced p90RSK phosphorylation and kinase activity were markedly attenuated in JnK1−/− andJnK2−/− cells. A dominant negative mutant of JNK1 inhibited UVA-induced JNKs and p90RSK phosphorylation and kinase activity, but had no effect on ERKs phosphorylation.

Extracellular signals have been shown to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades including extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs), and p38 kinase (p38) (15Brunet A. Pouysségur J. Essays Biochem. 1997; 32: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar). Among the first substrates of ERKs are the family of 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinases (p90RSK, also known as MAPKAP-K1) (16Frödin M. Grammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). The MAPKAP-K1 family is activated via phosphorylation and shown to be ubiquitous and versatile mediators of signal transduction (17Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv.

These signaling molecules are the focus of much interest due to their potent ability to be phosphorylated by activation of ERKs (18Sturgill T.W. Ray L.B. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Nature. 1988; 334: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) and their involvement in regulation of various cellular functions (16Frödin M. Grammeltoft S. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4353-4363Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Initially, p90RSK was isolated from Xenopus and identified on the basis of its ability to phosphorylate the 31-kDa protein S6 that is a component of the 40 S ribosomal subunit in vitro (20Erikson E.

As a signal-transducing serine/threonine kinase, p90RSK is an important member of a growing subfamily of MAPKs-activated protein kinases (16Frödin M. Grammeltoft S. Mol. Cell.

The two domains are the amino-terminal kinase domain (NTD) and the carboxyl-terminal kinase domain (CTD) (16Frödin M. Grammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 22Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 89: 5889-5892Crossref Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). With regard to primary structure, the NTD of p90RSK is most closely related to p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) (16Frödin M. Grammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 23Banerjee P. Ahmad M.F. Grove J.R. Kozlosky C. Price D.J. Avruch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The CTD of p90RSK is related to camodulin-dependent protein kinases and is most similar to phosphorylase kinase (16Frödin M. Grammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). The NTD may also be activated by phosphorylation of the CTD (16Frödin M. Grammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). ERKs were shown to phosphorylate and activate p90RSK in vivo (27Fischer C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell.

To date, six phosphorylation sites have been identified, three of which are phosphorylated by MAPKs in vitro (28Zhao Y. Bjorbaek C. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29773-29779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). MAPKs-catalyzed phosphorylation of Ser364 and Thr574 is critical for activation of the NTD and CTD, respectively, and the phosphorylation of Ser381 catalyzed by the CTD is also important for activation of the NTD (28Zhao Y.

The p90RSK signal transduction pathways are involved in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptotic death (16Frödin M. Grammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that p90RSK is phosphorylated and activated when cells are exposed to UVA irradiation. To examine the potential dependence of UVA-induced phosphorylation of p90RSK on MAPK pathways, we employed dominant negative mutants of ERK2, JNK1, and p38 kinase, knockoutJnK1 and JnK2 cells, and an inhibitor of ERKs and a novel inhibitor of JNKs and p38 kinase. From these studies, we conclude that ERKs and JNKs, but not p38 kinase, are involved in UVA-induced p90RSK activation and phosphorylation at Ser381. Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were from BioWhittaker, Inc. (Walkersville, MD); Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM),l-glutamine, and G418 sulfate were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY); gentamicin sulfate was from BioWhittaker, Inc; aprotinin, leupeptin, TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate), PD98059, and SB202190 were purchased from Sigma; LY294002 was from Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA); PD169316 was from AlexisTM Biochemicals, Inc. (San Diego, CA); epidermal growth factor (EGF) was from Collaborative Research (Madison, WI). The specific antibodies against phosphorylated sites of ERKs (Tyr204 of p44 and p42), JNKs (Thr183/Tyr185), and p38 kinase (Thr180/Tyr182), and antibodies to nonphospho-ERKs, -JNKs, -p38 kinase, and -STAT3 were from New England BioLabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Activated ERK1, ERK2, JNK1, JNK2, and p38 kinases were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The phospho-specific p90RSK (Ser381) polyclonal antibody (New England BioLabs, Inc.) detects endogenous levels of Ser381-phosphorylated p90RSK recognizing FRGFS*FVATG, where S* signifies phosphorylated serine (29Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1496-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), but this antibody shows some cross-reactivity with RSK2 and RSK3 when phosphorylated at the homologous serine. The specific antibody against Thr360/Ser364 phosphorylated p90RSK(New England BioLabs, Inc.) also shows some cross-reactivity with the homologous phosphorylated sites of RSK3, but not with those of RSK2 or MSK1. Therefore, analysis of RSK with these specific antibodies indicates phosphorylated levels of total RSKs including RSK1, RSK2, and RSK3. The antibody against nonphospho-p90RSK1 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The p90RSK1 (MAPKAP-K1a) antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The UVA source used was a Philips TL100w/10R system from Ultraviolet Resources International (Lakewood, OH). It consists of a Magnetek transformer number 799-XLH-TC-P, 120 volts 60 hertz, and six bulbs each six feet long. UVA irradiation filtered through about 6 mm of plate glass, eliminating UVB and UVC light at all wavelengths below 320 nm, was performed on cultured cells in the UVA box with two ventilation fans installed to eliminate thermal stimulation. These adjustments were necessary because the normal UVA lamps also produce a small amount of UVB and UVC. The CMV-neo vector plasmid was constructed as previously reported (34Huang C. Ma W.-Y.

They were cultured in monolayers using Eagle's MEM supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mml-glutamine, and 25 μg/ml gentamicin at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2. Before each experiment, these transfectants were selected with G418 and tested with their phospho-specific MAPKs antibodies. Immunoblot analysis for phosphorylated proteins of ERKs, JNKs, and p38 kinase was carried out using the phospho-specific MAPK antibodies as reported previously (34Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Dong Z. Mol. Cell.

The antibody-bound protein complexes were detected by Western immunoblotting using a chemiluminescent detection system (ECL, New England BioLabs, Inc.). Some transfer membranes were washed with stripping buffer (7 m guanadine hydrochloride, 50 mm glycine, pH 10.8, 0.05 mm EDTA, 0.1m KCl, and 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and reprobed with other primary phospho-specific or nonphospho-specific antibodies. Cells (5 × 105) were seeded into 100-mm dishes and cultured for 24 to 48 h. After the cells reached 80-90% confluence, the Cl 41, DNM-ERK2, DNM-JNK1, or DNM-p38 cells were starved for 24 to 48 h in MEM containing 0.1% FBS, 2 mml-glutamine, and 25 μg/ml gentamicin. After treatment with UVA or kinase inhibitors as indicated (prior to UVA irradiation), the cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 200 μl of SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). The lysed samples were scraped into 1.5-ml tubes and sonicated for 5 to 10 s. Samples containing an equal amount of protein (Bio-Rad protein assay, Bio-Rad) were loaded into each lane of an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis and subsequently transferred onto Immobilon-p transfer membrane (Millipore, Danbury, CT). The phosphorylated p90RSK protein was selectively detected by Western immunoblotting using a chemiluminescent detection system and a phospho-specific antibody against phosphorylation of p90RSK at Ser381 or Thr360/Ser364 (28Zhao Y.

However, p90RSK phosphorylation shows the total levels of the homologous phosphorylated sites of RSK1, RSK2, and RSK3. p90RSK activity was measured by an immune complex kinase assay using an S6 peptide AKRRRLSSLRA as a substrate according to the procedure recommended in the S6 kinase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) (38Foncea R. Andersson M. Ketterman A. Blakesley V. Sapag-Hagar M. Sugden P.H. LeRoith D. Lavandero S. J. Biol.

Briefly, cell lysates were prepared from JB6 Cl 41 cells or JB6 Cl 41 cells with DNM-JNK1, DNM-p38, or DNM-ERK2 grown in 100-mm dishes. After starving by replacing medium with 0.1% FBS/MEM, the cells were irradiated with UVA (160 kJ/m2). The cells were harvested at the times indicated and lysed in 300 μl of buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2.5 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fractions containing equal amounts of protein were incubated with anti-p90RSK1 (MAPKAP-K1a) antibody at 4 °C overnight, and then for an additional 4 h with protein-A/G plus Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). After washing four times with phosphate-buffered saline, the immunoprecipitates were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min in a mixture of the following: 20 μl of assay dilution buffer (ADB: 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), 10 μl of substrate mixture (S6 peptide in ADB), 10 μl of inhibitor mixture (20 μm PKC inhibitor peptide, 2 μm protein kinase A inhibitor peptide, and 20 μm compound R24571 in ADB), and 10 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi/μl; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.). To stop the reaction, samples were spotted onto a numbered P81 paper square and washed three times (5 min each) with 0.75% phosphoric acid and once (3 min) with acetone. Each sample paper was transferred into a scintillation vial and counted in a β-scintillation counter. At the same time, immunoprecipitates with normal non-immune serum instead of p90RSK antibody were used as background controls. After subtraction of background from each sample, the UVA-stimulated p90RSK activity was normalized to unstimulated controls and is shown as fold change. JB6 Cl 41 cell lysates were prepared as described above. Following exposure to UVA (160 kJ/m2), cells were harvested at 15 or 30 min and lysed for 5 min in buffer A. Supernatant fractions were incubated at 4 °C overnight with normal rabbit serum as a non-immune IgG control or with antibodies against ERKs, JNKs, p38 kinase, or p90RSK1(MAPKAP-K1a) and for an additional 4 h with protein-A/G plus Sepharose (4 °C). Samples were then washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline and the final pellet resuspended in 3 × SDS sample buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by using Western immunoblotting as recommended by New England BioLabs, Inc. (40Deak M. Clifton A.C. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R.

Immunoprecipitates of ERKs, JNKs, or p38 kinase were incubated with anti-phospho-p90RSK (Ser381) as the primary antibody, whereas immunoprecipitates of p90RSK1(MAPKAP-K1a) were incubated with phospho-specific ERKs, JNKs, or p38 kinase as the primary antibody. Embryo fibroblasts from normal JnK1−/− andJNK2−/− knockout mice were isolated and prepared according to the procedure of Loo and Cotman (42Loo D.T. Cotman C.W. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Second Edition. Academic Press Inc., San Diego1998: 65-72Google Scholar). Cells were established in culture in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For analysis of protein phosphorylation and kinase activity, the cells were starved by replacing growth medium with serum-free DMEM for 24 h at which time they were exposed to UVA. The cells were lysed with SDS sample buffer and protein concentration in the cell lysates was determined (Bio-Rad assay). Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated proteins were determined by Western blotting analysis. Kinase activity of p90RSK in these cells was performed as described above. JB6 Cl 41 cell lysates were cultured in 100-mm dishes and starved for 24 h and co-immunoprecipitation experiments with p90RSK1 (MAPKAP-K1a) were performed as described above. Samples containing immunoprecipitated p90RSK1 (MAPKAP-K1a) were incubated at 30 °C for 60 min with activated ERK2, JNK2, or p38 kinase (10 ng/ml) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm ATP, and 0.01% Brij 35).

To accomplish this, we mutated residues within the putative pore forming region of the channel and analyzed the functional properties of mutant channels using a45Ca2+ flux assay and single channel electrophysiological analyses. Two IP3R mutations, V2548I and D2550E, retained the ability to release45Ca2+ in response to IP3. When analyzed at the single channel level; both recombinant channels had IP3-dependent open probabilities similar to those observed in wild-type channels. The mutation V2548I resulted in channels that exhibited a larger K+ conductance (489 ± 13 picosiemens (pS) for V2548I versus 364 ± 5 pS for wild-type), but retained a Ca2+ selectivity similar to wild-type channels (PCa2+:PK+∼ 4:1). Conversely, D2550E channels were nonselective for Ca2+ over K+(PCa2+:PK+∼ 0.6:1), while the K+ conductance was effectively unchanged (391 ± 4 pS). These results suggest that amino acid residues Val2548 and Asp2550 contribute to the ion conduction pathway. We propose that the pore of IP3R channels has two distinct sites that control monovalent cation permeation (Val2548) and Ca2+ selectivity (Asp2550).

We propose that the pore of IP3R channels has two distinct sites that control monovalent cation permeation (Val2548) and Ca2+ selectivity (Asp2550). In response to a wide variety of external stimuli, the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)1 is generated from the phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (1Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3311) Google Scholar). IP3 then diffuses through the cytosol and binds to the IP3 receptor (IP3R), an intracellular ion channel that mediates the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum. IP3R-mediated increases in cytoplasmic [Ca2+] modulate a diverse array of cellular processes (2Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2263) Google Scholar). The IP3R channel is composed of four ∼300-kilodalton subunits that together form a single ion conduction pore (3Patel S. Joseph S.K. Thomas A.P. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 247-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The C terminus of each subunit is believed to contain six transmembrane helices and is separated from the N-terminal IP3 binding domain by a large intervening cytoplasmic region (4Joseph S.K. Boehning D.B. Lin C. Putney J.W. Methods in Calcium Signaling Research. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1999Google Scholar). The basic six transmembrane domain topology of IP3Rs is shared with other cation channels, including the superfamily of voltage-gated ion channels, cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channels, vanilloid receptors, and other members of the trp family of ion channels. By analogy, it has been suggested that putative transmembrane helices 5 and 6 and the intervening intraluminal loop constitute the ion permeation pathway of IP3Rs (5Mignery G. Sudhof T.C. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 18: 247-265Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 6Michikawa T. Hamanaka H. Otsu H. Yamamoto A. Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Tashiro Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The intraluminal loop of both IP3Rs and ryanodine receptors (RyRs) contain a stretch of amino acids, GVGD and GIGD, respectively, that may be homologous to the selectivity filter of K+channels. However, there is no direct evidence that residues within this region contribute to the ion conduction pathway of IP3Rs. The present study is the first to identify key residues that regulate ion permeation and selectivity in IP3R channels. We mutated three amino acids in this region and examined the functional consequences using a45Ca2+ flux assay and single channel electrophysiological analyses, carried out by patch clamping nuclei isolated from transfected COS cells. 2D.

Two mutants (V2548I and D2550E) of the rat type 1 IP3R retained the ability to release 45Ca2+ in response to IP3. When analyzed at the single-channel level, mutant V2548I channels had a larger K+ conductance compared with wild-type channels with no alteration in the selectivity for divalent cations. However, substitution of Asp2550 with Glu resulted in channels that were nonselective for divalent cations without affecting K+conductance. We propose that the molecular mechanism for divalent cation selectivity in IP3Rs involves a ring of four aspartic acid residues at position 2550 that form a Ca2+binding site within the ion conduction pathway, with ion conductance determined by valine at position 2548. Divalent cation interaction with two sites may enable multi-ion occupancy and high ion throughput in the IP3R. The neuronal rat type I SI(−), SIII(+), SII(+) splice variant in pCMV was the kind gift of Dr. Thomas Südhof (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). This cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3.1 as described elsewhere (9Boehning D. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21492-21499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Mutations of Asp2550 (rat) to Glu, Asn, and Ala have been described previously (9Boehning D. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21492-21499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All other mutations were carried out using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit as per manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Sequences of the mutagenic primers used for the polymerase chain reactions are available upon request. COS-7 cells were maintained and transfected as described previously (9Boehning D. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21492-21499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). 45Ca2+ flux assays were performed exactly as described previously (9Boehning D. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21492-21499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 10Boehning D. Joseph S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5450-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, microsomal vesicles were prepared from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with either wild-type or mutated IP3R constructs in conjunction with SERCA-2b (human). The vesicles were then assayed for45Ca2+ uptake in the presence of potassium oxalate and MgATP. The inclusion of IP3 in the assay buffer caused a reduction in the initial rate of SERCA-dependent uptake, giving an indirect measure of IP3R activity. This assay has been shown to measure 45Ca2+ flux only through recombinant IP3Rs (9Boehning D. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21492-21499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 10Boehning D. Joseph S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5450-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The initial rate of uptake in the presence of IP3 is presented as a percentage of the rate measured without IP3. Preparations of cellular homogenates for patch clamp recording of nuclei are described in detail elsewhere.2 Briefly, cells were gently homogenized in a motor-driven glass Teflon homogenizer in a buffer containing 0.25m sucrose, 0.15 m KCl, 3 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Cell integrity was monitored by trypan blue exclusion, and homogenization was allowed to proceed until ∼30% of cells were lysed. Cell lysates were stored in the same buffer on ice and used on the same day in patch clamping experiments. Approximately 10 μl of cellular homogenate was added to a dish containing 1 ml of bath solution (see “Patch Clamp Solutions”) and transferred to the stage of a microscope for patch clamping. Isolated nuclei, visually free of extraneous cellular debris, were localized by trypan blue staining and patch-clamped at room temperature. Single channel currents were amplified using an Axopatch-1D amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) with anti-aliasing filtering at 1 kHz and transferred to a Power Macintosh 8100 via an ITC-16 interface (Instrutech Corp., Port Washington, NY). Data were digitized at 5 kHz and written directly to hard disc by Pulse + PulseFit software (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany). Single channel recordings were analyzed using TAC 3.03 (Bruxton, Seattle, WA) and plotted using Igor Pro 3 (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) and SigmaPlot (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL). Permeability ratios were calculated using the experimentally determined reversal potentials as described elsewhere (11Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). Bath solution contained 140 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 500 μmBAPTA, 0.001% trypan blue, and 250 nm[Ca2+]free adjusted to pH 7.1 with KOH. An additional 5 mm K+ ions was contributed to the solution by the adjustment of the pH. Pipette solutions contained 140 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 100 μmBAPTA, 0.5 mm NaATP, 10 μm IP3, and 1.0 μm [Ca2+]free adjusted to pH 7.1 with KOH. Free calcium concentrations in all buffers were determined using a Ca2+-selective mini-electrode as described previously (12Sigel E. Affolter H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 141: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For determinations of ionic selectivity, high Ca2+ bath buffer contained 50 mmCaCl2, 30 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.1 with KOH. Low K+ pipette solutions contained 14 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 100 μm BAPTA, 0.5 mm NaATP, 10 μmIP3, and 1.0 μm[Ca2+]free adjusted to pH 7.1 with KOH. All selectivity determinations were corrected for the liquid junction potential as described previously (13Neher E. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single Channel Recording. Plenum Press, New York1995: 147-153Google Scholar). The predicted transmembrane topology of the IP3R and the putative location of the three residues, Val2548, Asp2550, and Asp2569, examined in the present study are diagrammed in Fig.1A. All three amino acids are within a predicted intraluminal loop between transmembrane helices 5 and 6, a region that contains the pore domain in other cation channels. Within this region is a sequence GVGD, which is highly reminiscent of the GYGD signature sequence of the selectivity filter of K+channels. The Tyr residue in K+ channels plays a critical role in defining the size of the pore and thereby providing K+ selectivity (14Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5732) Google Scholar). In contrast, the selectivity filters of Ca2+-selective ion channels lack the two central residues (YG) present in the K+-selective channels (Fig.1A). Nevertheless, the permeation properties of the IP3R are more similar to those of Ca2+channels, including selectivity for divalent cations, lack of selectivity for monovalent alkali metal cations, and block by divalent cations including Mg2+ (15Mak D.O. Foskett J.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C179-C188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The similar permeation properties of IP3R, CNG, and voltage-gated Ca2+channels suggest that the IP3R channel pore likely contains a high affinity binding site for Ca2+ ions. In CNG- and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, this site is conferred by an acidic residue equivalent in sequence to Asp2550 in the IP3R channel (Fig. 1A). Because the IP3R permeation properties are reminiscent of those of other Ca2+ channels, but the putative pore sequence is more closely related to K+ channels, we examined the effects of mutations of Val2548 and Asp2550 on the permeation properties of the IP3R channel. Based on the roles of these residues in K+ and Ca2+channels, respectively, we hypothesized that Val2548 might influence conduction by its participation in the molecular interactions that control the size of the pore, whereas Asp2550 may determine divalent cation selectivity. In addition, we also mutated Asp2569, because mutation of the homologous residue in the RyR influenced its permeation properties (16Gao L. Balshaw D. Xu L. Tripathy A. Xin C. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 828-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Val2548 was mutated to Ile or Tyr, the amino acids present at the analogous position in ryanodine receptors and K+channels, respectively (Fig. 1A). Asp2550 and Asp2569 were mutated to Glu, Asn, or Ala. All the mutant IP3R channels were expressed at levels comparable with the wild-type channel when transiently transfected into COS-7 cells (Fig.1B). Mutant channels were first screened for Ca2+ release activity by measurements of IP3-dependent 45Ca2+flux from microsomes prepared from COS cells co-transfected with both SERCA2b and IP3R cDNAs (9Boehning D. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21492-21499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Mutating Val2548 to Ile did not alter channel function in this assay, whereas no Ca2+ release activity was observed with substitution by Tyr (Fig. 1C). As shown previously, Glu (but not Asn or Ala) substituted for Asp2550 in the Ca2+-release assay (9Boehning D. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21492-21499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Asp2569, predicted to be the final residue before the beginning of the putative transmembrane helix 6 (Fig. 1A), was intolerant to substitutions (Fig.1C). Mutation of the analogous position (D4917A) in the RyR type 1 channel also abolished Ca2+ permeability (16Gao L. Balshaw D. Xu L. Tripathy A. Xin C. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 828-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Patch clamp electrophysiology of transfected COS cell nuclei was performed to examine the effects of the mutations on ion permeation. Our protocol enables recording of recombinant IP3R channels specifically without contributions from endogenous IP3R channels.2 K+ was used as the permeant ion to minimize Ca2+-dependent inactivation and maximize single channel conductance (17Mak D.D. Foskett J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29375-29378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using these recording conditions, IP3-activated channels were only detected in nuclear membrane patches from cells expressing wild-type, V2548I, or D2550E channels (data not shown). Open probabilities determined at 1 μm free Ca2+ were similar for both mutant channels and wild-type channels (wild-type, 0.59 ± 0.07; V2548I, 0.65 ± 0.10; D2550E, 0.68 ± 0.13). From analyses of current-voltage relationships determined in symmetrical 140 mm KCl, the slope conductance of V2548I channels was 489 ± 13 pS, which was significantly larger than that of wild-type channels (364 ± 5 pS). In contrast, the ion selectivity of the V2548I channel was unchanged compared with that of the wild-type channel. The monovalent cation:anion selectivity, determined from reversal potentials measured in the presence of a 10-fold KCl gradient (14 mm KCl pipette, 140 mmKCl bath) (11Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar), was identical for V2548I and wild-type channels (Erev = +44.9 ± 0.5 mV;PK/PCl = 22:1; Fig.1C). To determine the Ca2+ selectivity, channels were first detected in symmetrical 140 mm KCl, and then the bath was replaced with a high Ca2+ buffer (50 mm CaCl2, 30 mm KCl). Under these conditions, V2548I channels had a Erev of +19.3 ± 1.8 mV, corresponding toPCa/PK ∼ 4.1 (Fig. 3D), not significantly different from that observed for wild-type IP3R channels (data not shown)2. Thus, these results demonstrate that mutation of Val2548 to Ile increased channel conductance but was without effect on the ion selectivity properties of the pore. The conductance of D2550E channels was similar to that of wild-type channels (391 ± 4 pS versus 364 ± 5 pS, respectively; Fig. 2B). The mutation was also without effect on the cation:anion selectivity (PK/PCl = 22:1; Fig.1C). In contrast, the mutant channel had a significantly altered cation selectivity. Erev for the D2550E channel in the presence of a Ca2+ gradient was shifted to −7.4 ± 2.8 mV (Fig. 2D), giving a calculatedPCa/PK of 0.63. Thus, D2550E channels have similar conductance properties as wild-type channels, but they have largely lost the ability to discriminate between K+ and Ca2+. The present study has identified two residues (Val2548 and Asp2550) that, when mutated, affect the conductance or divalent cation selectivity of the IP3R channel. Thus these two residues are likely to be part of the ion conduction pathway of IP3Rs. This result, taken together with analyses of IP3R topology (19Joseph S.K. Boehning D. Pierson S. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1579-1588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 20Galvan D.L. Borrego-Diaz E. Perez P. Mignery G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29483-29492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and the sequence homology with the selectivity filter of K+ channels, confirms previous predictions that the pore region of the IP3R is constructed in a manner analogous to that of several classes of voltage- and ligand-gated cation channels with the pore located between the last two transmembrane segments (5Mignery G. Sudhof T.C. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 18: 247-265Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 20Galvan D.L. Borrego-Diaz E. Perez P. Mignery G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29483-29492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A similar conclusion was reached for the RyR channel (21Zhao M.C. Li P. Li X.L. Zhang L. Winkfein R.J. Chen SRW J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25971-25974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In CNG- and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, a conserved glutamate in the pore region is critical for Ca2+selectivity (22Park C.S. MacKinnon R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13328-13333Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Ellinor P.T. Yang J. Sather W.A. Zhang J. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1121-1132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Cysteine accessibility and pH sensitivity studies of these channels have suggested that the side chains of four of these residues (contributed by each repeat or monomer) likely project into the pore to coordinate the permeant Ca2+ ion and regulate divalent cation permeation (24Wu X. Edwards H.D. Sather W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31778-31785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25Root M.J. MacKinnon R. Science. 1994; 265: 1852-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The location of Asp2550 in the analogous position in the IP3R channel and the effects of its mutation on divalent cation selectivity indicate that this residue functions similarly in the IP3R channel. The fact that mutation of this residue to Glu with preservation of its charge affected the Ca2+ selectivity suggests that steric considerations as well as electrostatic forces contribute to the positioning of the ring of carboxylate groups in the pore. Functional non-equivalence of Glu and Asp residues at analogous positions in voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and CNG channels has also been noted previously (23Ellinor P.T. Yang J. Sather W.A. Zhang J. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1121-1132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 26Seifert R. Eismann E. Ludwig J. Baumann A. Kaupp U.B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). One of the findings of the present study is that although the D2550E mutant exhibited diminished divalent cation selectivity, permeation of monovalent cations was unaffected, suggesting that a high affinity interaction at position 2550 is not rate-limiting for monovalent ion permeation. Similarly, monovalent ion permeability is not impaired when all four glutamates within the EEEE locus are mutated to Ala or Gln in voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (27Cibulsky S.M. Sather W.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This is also the observed result when the analogous Asp is mutated to Asn in vanilloid receptors (28Garcia-Martinez C. Morenilla-Palao C. Planells-Cases R. Merino J.M. Ferrier-Monteil A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32552-32558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The conserved acidic residue that is critical for divalent cation selectivity and permeation in Ca2+-selective channels is adjacent to the GXG signature sequence in other cation channels (Fig. 1A). The crystal structure of theStreptomyces lividans K+ channel indicates that this acidic residue is exposed at the outer mouth of the pore (14Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5732) Google Scholar). A distinction between the IP3R channel on one hand, and CNG channels and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels on the other, is that the latter have deletions of two amino acids (Fig. 1A) between the initial glycine and the acidic residue of the signature sequence, whereas the IP3R channel contains them. The crystal structure of the K+ channel has shown that the rigid arrangement of backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms of the selectivity filter within the GYG sequence is responsible for the precise coordination of K+ ion in the pore (14Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5732) Google Scholar). In this structure the side chain of the central tyrosine residue is directed away from the pore and makes specific interactions with other parts of the protein that contribute to holding the pore at a fixed size (14Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5732) Google Scholar). Mutation of the GVG sequence in IP3R to the GYG sequence of K+ channels resulted in an absence of detectable IP3R channel activity. On the other hand, mutation to GIG increased the K+ conductance. It is interesting to note that the single channel conductance of RyR, which contains the GIG sequence, is greater than that of IP3R (16Gao L. Balshaw D. Xu L. Tripathy A. Xin C. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 828-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 18Tinker A. Williams A.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 479-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and that the reverse mutation of Ile in the RyR to Val, as in IP3R, confers a lower conductance on RyR channels (16Gao L. Balshaw D. Xu L. Tripathy A. Xin C. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 828-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, this residue likely plays a role in IP3R channels in contributing to the mechanisms that determine the size of the pore, which in turn contribute to the magnitude of alkali metal cation conductance. We propose a model in which the pore of IP3R channels has two distinct sites that control K+ ion permeation (Val2548) and divalent cation selectivity (Asp2550). The interaction of permeant ions with two distinct sites in the IP3R pore may enable multi-ion occupancy of the pore, which could promote high throughput permeation rates by electrostatic destabilization.

The activation of JNK1 and the transactivation of c-Jun by this mutant of PKG were inhibited by a dominant negative MEKK1. In vitro assays showed that a purified PKG directly phosphorylated the N-terminal domain of MEKK1. PKG also directly phosphorylated a full-length MEKK1, and this was associated with enhanced MEKK1 phosphorylation.

It is involved in the regulation of various physiological functions, including neurotransmission, cell differentiation, proliferation, and platelet aggregation (2Vaandrager A.B. de Jonge H.R. Mol.

In recent studies we obtained evidence that in human colon cancer cell lines, novel PDE2/5 inhibitors, including exisulind (sulindac sulfone) and the high affinity derivatives CP248 and CP461, increase cellular levels of cGMP and that this leads to activation of PKG and c-Jun kinase (JNK1) and induction of apoptosis (8Soh J.W.

The present study presents evidence that the activation of PKG by cGMP leads to direct phosphorylation and activation of MEKK1. This then leads to activation of SEK1 and subsequently JNK1. This PKG-MEKK1-SEK1-JNK1 pathway represents a novel signal transduction pathway that may be important in understanding the roles of cGMP and PKG in cell proliferation and apoptosis. NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts were routinely grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) containing 10% calf serum. For reporter assays, triplicate samples of 1 × 105 cells in 35-mm plates were transfected using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 1 μg of the reporter plasmid, 0.05–5 μg of various expression vectors, and 1 μg of the control plasmid pCMV-%-gal. The pcDNA3 plasmid DNA was added to the transfections, as needed, to achieve the same total amount of plasmid DNA per transfection. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cell extracts were prepared, and luciferase assays were done using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega).

The cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 mm%-glycerophosphate, 25% glycerol) and then JNK1 was immunoprecipitated for 2 h with an anti-JNK1 antibody (Santa Cruz) and assayed for in vitro kinase activity with GST-c-Jun-(1–79) (New England Biolabs) as the substrate, in a kinase reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 20 μm ATP, 20 mm %-glycerophosphate, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), for 20 min, as described previously (8Soh J.W. Mao Y. Kim M.G. Pamukcu R. Li H. Piazza G.A. Thompson W.J. Weinstein I.B. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 4136-4141PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was then subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. For transient transfection experiments, subconfluent cultures of cells in 10-cm plates were transfected, using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.), with 2.5 μg of the pCMV5-M2-JNK1 plasmid and either 5 μg of pRc/CMV-Δ93GK or pCEP4-HA-MEKK1 plasmid DNA. The pcDNA3 plasmid DNA was used as a control. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were lysed in the lysis buffer described above and then JNK1 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) for 2 h and assayed for in vitro kinase activity, as described above. The intensities of the bands on gels were determined with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics), and the ratio of the treated sample to the control untreated sample was expressed as “relative kinase activity” or “fold activation.” The experiments were repeated three times with similar results. Purified recombinant PKG Iα (100 units, Calbiochem) was incubated with 2 μg of recombinant GST-MEKK1-(1–301) (Santa Cruz) in a reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μm dipyridamole, 10 mm DTT, 200 μm ATP, 10 mm NaF, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), for 20 min, in the absence or presence of 100 μm cGMP. The reaction mixture was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and the intensities of the bands were determined as described above. The ratio of the treated sample to the control untreated sample was expressed as fold activation. COS-7 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and subconfluent cultures in 10-cm plates were transiently transfected with either a HA epitope-tagged MEKK1 WT (wild type) or the D1369A mutant plasmid, using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.), as described above. After 24 h, the cells were lysed in the above-mentioned lysis buffer. MEKK1 was then immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody (Berkeley Antibody Company), and in vitro kinase assays were performed in the absence or presence of 100 units of purified PKG Iα (Calbiochem) in a kinase reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 20 μm ATP, 20 mm %-glycerophosphate, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), for 20 min, as described previously (13Dinerman J.L. Steiner J.P. Dawson T.M. Dawson V. Snyder S.H. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 1245-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The pCEP4-HA-MEKK1-WT and pCEP4-HA-MEKK1-D1369A plasmids encode a wild type MEKK1 and a kinase-inactive mutant, respectively (12Xu S. Robbins D.J. Christerson L.B. English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5291-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To directly address the role of PKG, we examined the effects of a constitutively active mutant of PKG on the JNK1 pathway in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts. For this purpose, we utilized the pRc/CMV-Δ93GK plasmid, which encodes a mutant PKG I% sequence with an N-terminal truncation. Deletion of the N-terminal 93 amino acids renders this PKG independent of cGMP, and therefore, it is constitutively active (10Gudi T. Lohmann S.M. Pilz R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5244-5254Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We first established that in NIH3T3 cells, as in SW480 human colon cancer cells (8Soh J.W. Mao Y. Kim M.G. Pamukcu R. Li H. Piazza G.A. Thompson W.J. Weinstein I.B. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 4136-4141PubMed Google Scholar), increased levels of cGMP lead to activation of JNK1. Exponentially growing NIH3T3 cells were treated with various cGMP modulators for 1 h, and protein extracts were then collected for JNK1 assays (Fig. 1 A). Anisomycin, a known activator of JNK1 (14Barancik M. Htun P. Schaper W. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1999; 34: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), was used as a positive control. Treatment with 8-bromo-3′:5′ cyclic GMP (8-Br-cGMP, 500 μm), a cell permeable cGMP analog, led to rapid activation of JNK1. YC-1 (100 μm), a guanylate cyclase activator, and CP248 (1 μm), a PDE2/5 inhibitor (8Soh J.W. Mao Y. Kim M.G. Pamukcu R. Li H. Piazza G.A. Thompson W.J. Weinstein I.B. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 4136-4141PubMed Google Scholar, 9Thompson W.J. Piazza G.A. Li H. Liu L. Fetter J. Zhu B. Sperl G. Ahnen D. Pamukcu R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3338-3342PubMed Google Scholar), also rapidly activated JNK1. Western blot analysis using a JNK1 antibody (Fig. 1 A) ensured that equal amounts of the immunoprecipitated JNK1 protein were added to the kinase reactions. Therefore, increase in cellular levels of cGMP does lead to activation of JNK1 in NIH3T3 cells. We then examined whether the constitutively active mutant of PKG causes JNK1 activation in NIH3T3 cells. The cells were transiently transfected with the pCMV5-M2-JNK1 plasmid and increasing amounts of the constitutively active PKG plasmid Δ93GK. The pCMV5-M2-JNK1 plasmid encodes a FLAG-tagged JNK1. The pCEP4-HA-MEKK1 plasmid, which encodes the wild type MEKK1, was used as a positive control, since when overexpressed it leads to JNK1 activation (12Xu S. Robbins D.J. Christerson L.B. English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5291-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after transfection, FLAG-tagged JNK1 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody and assayed for JNK1 in vitro kinase activity, using GST-c-Jun as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 1 B, transfection with Δ93GK activated JNK1, in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot analysis indicated that the kinase assays contained equal amounts of the FLAG-JNK1 protein (Fig. 1 B). These data demonstrate that a constitutively active PKG mutant is sufficient to induce JNK1 activity in NIH3T3 cells. We previously reported that in SW480 cells submicromolar concentrations of the exisulind analog CP248, a potent PDE2/5 inhibitor (8Soh J.W. Mao Y. Kim M.G. Pamukcu R. Li H. Piazza G.A. Thompson W.J. Weinstein I.B. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 4136-4141PubMed Google Scholar, 9Thompson W.J. Piazza G.A. Li H. Liu L. Fetter J. Zhu B. Sperl G. Ahnen D. Pamukcu R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3338-3342PubMed Google Scholar), causes rapid (within 30 min) activation of MEKK1 (8Soh J.W. Mao Y. Kim M.G. Pamukcu R. Li H. Piazza G.A. Thompson W.J. Weinstein I.B. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 4136-4141PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether MEKK1 is actually required for PKG-mediated JNK1 activation, we studied the effects of a dominant negative mutant of MEKK1, encoded by the plasmid pCEP4-HA-MEKK1-D1369A, on PKG-mediated activation of JNK1. The MEKK1-D1369A mutant encodes a kinase-inactive protein, due to an Asp1369 to Ala point mutation in its activation loop (12Xu S. Robbins D.J. Christerson L.B. English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5291-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were transiently transfected with the pCMV5-M2-JNK1 plasmid and either Δ93GK or pCEP4-HA-MEKK1-D1369A, or both of the latter two plasmids. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the FLAG-tagged JNK1 protein was immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody and assayed for JNK1 kinase activity. Fig. 1 C shows that the dominant negative MEKK1 construct strongly inhibited PKG-mediated JNK1 activation. These results indicate that in NIH3T3 cells PKG-mediated activation of JNK1 requires MEKK1, thus placing MEKK1 upstream of JNK1 in the pathway by which PKG leads to JNK1 activation. In view of the above results we investigated whether MEKK1 is a direct downstream target of PKG in the PKG-JNK1 pathway by examining whether MEKK1 is anin vitro substrate for PKG. Purified wild type PKG Iα (Calbiochem) was incubated with a recombinant GST-MEKK1-(1–301) protein, which contains the N-terminal domain of MEKK1, in a reaction buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP, in the absence or presence of 100 μm cGMP. We found that PKG did phosphorylate the N-terminal domain of MEKK1 and that this phosphorylation was stimulated by cGMP (Fig.2 A). Phosphorylation of MEKK1 activates its kinase activity, and this, in turn, leads to autophosphorylation of the MEKK1 protein (15Deak J.C. Templeton D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought evidence that the in vitrophosphorylation of MEKK1 by PKG also activates the kinase activity of MEKK1, thereby resulting in its autophosphorylation. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with either a HA epitope-tagged WT MEKK1 or the D1369A (dominant negative) mutant of MEKK1. After 24 h, the WT and mutant MEKK1 proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts with an anti-HA antibody. The immunoprecipitated MEKK1-WT or MEKK1-D1369A proteins were incubated in [γ-32P]ATP-phosphorylation assays, with or without purified wild type PKG, and in the absence or presence of cGMP. Fig. 2 B shows that in the presence of cGMP and PKG the MEKK1-WT protein underwent more extensive phosphorylation than the MEKK1-D1369A mutant protein, even though similar amounts of both proteins were immunoprecipitated. The panel on the right was exposed for a longer time than the panel on the left, because the bands in the panel on the right would otherwise not be well displayed. The more extensive phosphorylation of MEKK1-WT suggests that phosphorylation of this protein by cGMP-activated PKG leads to activation of the kinase activity of MEKK1, and subsequent MEKK1 autophosphorylation. This is consistent with evidence that when MEKK1 is activated in vivo it undergoes autophosphorylation (15Deak J.C. Templeton D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but this requires further studies. These data suggest that phosphorylation of MEKK1-D1369A is due to phosphorylation by PKG and that phosphorylation of MEKK1-WT is due to both phosphorylation by PKG and MEKK1 autophosphorylation. The high level of phosphorylation of MEKK1-WT was dependent upon the addition of both PKG and cGMP (Fig. 2 B), indicating that this was mediated by activated PKG. These results indicate that cGMP-activated PKG can directly phosphorylate MEKK1 and suggest that this activates MEKK1. Since activated PKG resulted in the activation of JNK1 in NIH3T3 cells, it was of interest to look at immediate events downstream of JNK1. Activation of JNK1 leads to phosphorylation and thereby transactivation of the transcription factor c-Jun. Therefore, we examined whether transfection of NIH3T3 cells with the constitutively active mutant of PKG led to c-Jun transactivation, using transient transfection reporter assays (Fig.3). The pG5-luciferase reporter plasmid has five copies of GAL4 binding sites, and the pGAL4-c-Jun plasmid encodes the GAL4 DNA binding domain protein fused to the transactivation domain of c-Jun (16Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Activation of c-Jun by phosphorylation of its transactivation domain leads to activation of transcription of the pG5-luciferase reporter. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with the pG5-luciferase reporter plasmid together with the pGAL4-c-Jun plasmid, and with increasing amounts of the Δ93GK plasmid or the pCEP4-HA-MEKK1 plasmid. Luciferase assays (Fig. 3 A) indicated that transfection with Δ93GK led to c-Jun transactivation, in a dose-dependent manner. Again, MEKK1 served as a positive control. In additional studies, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with the pG5-luciferase reporter plasmid and the pGAL4-c-Jun plasmid, together with either Δ93GK, pCEP4-HA-MEKK1-D1369A, or both of the latter two plasmids (Fig. 3 B). The constitutively active mutant of PKG again stimulated c-Jun activation, and this activation was markedly inhibited by the dominant negative MEKK1 construct (D1369A), in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, the ability of PKG to cause transactivation of c-Jun is mediated through MEKK1, which then, presumably, activates SEK1 and then JNK1. We then examined the ability of the Δ93GK mutant of PKG to mediate the activation of an AP-1 enhancer element. The AP-1 enhancer element is responsive to various stimuli that activate the c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimer (17Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 18Karin M. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were transfected with a pAP-1-luciferase reporter plasmid, together with increasing amounts of the Δ93GK plasmid (Fig. 3 C). Again the pCEP4-HA-MEKK1 plasmid was used as a positive control. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cell extracts were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity. We found that Δ93GK also activated the AP-1 reporter, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 C). Therefore, a constitutively active mutant of PKG is sufficient to lead to activation of the AP-1 enhancer element. We reported previously that sulindac sulfone (exisulind) and related compounds that inhibit PDEs 2 and 5 and, therefore, increase cellular levels of cGMP, can lead to activation of the MEKK1-SEK1-JNK1 pathway in SW480 human colon cancer cells (8Soh J.W. Mao Y. Kim M.G. Pamukcu R. Li H. Piazza G.A. Thompson W.J. Weinstein I.B. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 4136-4141PubMed Google Scholar). The present studies provide evidence that PKG can directly phosphorylate and activate MEKK1. A hypothetical signaling pathway based on these results is shown in Fig.4. Intracellular levels of cGMP can increase, either through activation of guanylate cyclase or through inhibition of PDEs 2 and 5. This leads to activation of PKG. Activated PKG can then directly phosphorylate and activate MEKK1. The activated MEKK1 then phosphorylates and activates SEK1, which in turn phosphorylates and activates JNK1. Previous studies indicate that JNK1 activation can play a critical role in the activation of c-Jun, gene transcription, and the induction of apoptosis (8Soh J.W. Mao Y. Kim M.G. Pamukcu R. Li H. Piazza G.A. Thompson W.J. Weinstein I.B. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 4136-4141PubMed Google Scholar, 19Basu S. Kolesnick R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3277-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). It is known that MEKK1 can play an important role in various stress responses and in apoptosis, through activation of the downstream kinases SEK1 and JNK1 (20Schlesinger T.K. Fanger G.R. Yujiri T. Johnson G.L. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D1181-D1186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise proteins that act upstream of MEKK1 to cause its activation are not clearly defined. Deaket al. (15Deak J.C. Templeton D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) identified a major site of autophosphorylation (Thr575) within the “activation loop” of MEKK1. Phosphatase treatment of a constitutively active MEKK1 or mutation of Thr575 to alanine decreased the kinase activity of MEKK1 (15Deak J.C. Templeton D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). PAK3 and PKC were reported to result in activation of MEKK1in vivo (21Siow Y.L. Kalmar G.B. Sanghera J.S. Tai G. Oh S.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7586-7594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, this interaction was indirect, since there was no direct phosphorylation of MEKK1 by PAK3 or PKC or of PAK3 by PKC. Our evidence that PKG can directly phosphorylate and activate MEKK1 suggests a novel signaling pathway that can cause apoptosis. Although the present studies were done mainly with NIH3T3 cells, in unpublished studies we found that transfection of SW480 human colon cancer cells with the constitutively active mutant of PKG also leads to JNK1 activation. Therefore, this signaling pathway probably applies to a variety of mammalian cells and may have more general relevance with respect to growth control and apoptosis.

The 85-kDa βPix-a protein contains an Src homology 3 domain, the tandem Dbl homology and Pleckstrin homology domains, a proline-rich region, and a GIT1-binding domain. In addition to those domains, βPix-a also contains a putative leucine zipper domain at the C-terminal end. In this study, we demonstrate that the previously identified putative leucine zipper domain mediates the formation of βPix-a homodimers. Using in vitro andin vivo methodologies, we show that deletion of the leucine zipper domain is sufficient to abolish βPix-a homodimerization. In NIH3T3 fibroblast cells, expression of wild type βPix-a induces the formation of membrane ruffles. However, cells expressing the leucine zipper domain deletion mutant could not form membrane ruffle structures. Moreover, platelet-derived growth factor-mediated cytoskeletal changes were completely blocked by the leucine zipper domain deletion mutant. The results suggest that the leucine zipper domain enables βPix-a to homodimerize, and homodimerization is essential for βPix-a signaling functions leading to the cytoskeletal reorganization.

In fibroblasts, RhoA induces stress fibers associated with focal adhesions, Rac1 produces lamellipodia or membrane ruffles, and Cdc42 induces filopodia on the plasma membrane (4Ridley A.J. Hall A.

Similar to all members of the Ras superfamily GTPase, the activity of Rho family proteins cycles between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound conformational states, regulated by three kinds of proteins: GTPase activating proteins, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors, and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs1) (7Aelst L.V. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar). All members of the Dbl family possess a Dbl homology (DH) domain in tandem with a Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The DH domain typically represents the motif for binding the Rho family GTPases and stimulating GDP/GTP exchange, whereas the PH domain appears to be essential for mediating the appropriate cellular localization of the protein (8Whitehead I.P.

Additionally, most members of the GEFs contain a number of other structural motifs that indicate a role in signal transduction. These domains presumably function to mediate protein/protein or protein/lipid interactions and serve to link GEFs to upstream regulators and downstream effectors (8Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported p85SPR (an SH3 domain-containing proline-rich protein) as a widely expressed focal protein (11Oh W.K. Yoo J.C. Jo D. Song Y.H. Kim M.G. Park D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The same protein was identified as a p21-activated kinase (Pak)-interacting exchange factor (named βPix or p85Cool-1) and suggested as a putative GEF for Cdc42/Rac1 (12Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G.

Two alternative spliced forms of βPix, named βPix-b and βPix-c, that are predominantly expressed in nervous tissue were also reported (14Kim S. Kim T. Lee D. Park S.H. Kim H. Park D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). βPix-a, which corresponds to βPix/p85Cool-1/p85SPR, is a multidomain protein with many potential binding sites that can mediate protein-protein interactions. In addition to the conventional tandem, a DH domain and a PH domain, βPix-a has an SH3 domain that directly binds to the proline-rich region of Pak, an important downstream effector in cellular signaling governed by Cdc42/Rac GTPases (12Manser E.

Other domains of βPix-a include a proline-rich region and a putative leucine zipper domain at the C terminus (11Oh W.K. Yoo J.C. Jo D. Song Y.H. Kim M.G. Park D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Recently, βPix-a was reported to interact with ADP ribosylation factor-GTPase activating proteins such as GIT (G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-interactingtargets), p95PKL (paxillin-kinaselinker), and Cat (cool-associated,tyrosine-phosphorylated) through the GIT1-binding domain of the C-terminal end of βPix-a (16Bagrodia S.

Earlier studies have focused on the interactions of βPix with other signaling proteins but have not considered the possibility of its self-association. The leucine zipper domain is known to mediate the formation of homo- or heterodimers in various kinds of proteins such as transcription factor, adaptor, and kinase and regulate the functions of the proteins (19Alber T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that βPix homodimerizes through its leucine zipper domain in vitro andin vivo. This ability of βPix to homodimerize was found to be necessary for the βPix-mediated membrane ruffle formation in NIH3T3 fibroblast. Our results suggest that βPix-a homodimerization plays an essential role in βPix-a signaling leading to the cytoskeletal reorganization. Schematic diagrams of the various βPix-a expression constructs used in this study are shown in Fig.1 A. Expression plasmids for hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged βPix-a, FLAG-tagged βPix-a, and Myc-tagged βPix-a were constructed by subcloning the polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNA fragments from βPix-a. In vitrotranscription and translation were performed with the TNT reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). 1 μg of supercoiled plasmid was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. The 50-μl reaction mixture contained 25 μl of TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysate, TNT reaction buffer, T7 RNA polymerase, 20 units of RNasin, and amino acid mixture without methionine, supplemented with [35S]methionine as the radioactive precursor (1000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After a 90-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction mixture was used for co-immunoprecipitation assay. GST-SH3 domain and GST-C-terminal fusion proteins were prepared for this study. Primers were taken directly from the published cDNA sequence of βPix-a. The recombinant vector was transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α, and the fusion proteins were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and affinity-purified according to the standard protocol of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. 2 μg of GST fusion proteins was incubated with 1 mg of cell lysates in a volume of 1 ml. To immobilize the GST protein, glutathione-agarose beads equilibrated in binding buffer were added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C under constant rotation. After washing the resin with the same buffer, the bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. Transfected cells were lysed on ice with 1 ml per 100-mm dish of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). After 20 min, lysates were precleared by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C and immunoprecipitated with a primary antibody for 2 h followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with the same lysis buffer, and samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore) and subjected to immunoblotting analysis. All immunoblots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence. COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and maintained in 10% CO2 at 37 °C. Mouse NIH3T3 fibroblast cells were grown in medium consisting of DMEM containing 10% bovine calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin and maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For morphological studies, cells were serum-starved for 16 h, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Actin cytoskeleton was stained by incubation with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) for 1 h followed by three washes with phosphate-buffered saline. For immunolocalization studies, cells were fixed and permeabilized as above. Myc-tagged βPix was detected by incubating with anti-Myc antibody, 9E10, for 1 h followed by a fluorescein-conjugated anti-IgG-specific secondary antibody for 1 h. Cells were observed and photographed under a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. To address whether βPix-a forms dimers (or oligomers), we first tested the ability of full-length βPix-a to form oligomers by a co-immunoprecipitation approach. For this study, two different epitope-tagged (FLAG and Myc) βPix-a expression vectors were transfected either alone or together into COS7 cells. Anti-Myc antibody, 9E10, was used to immunoprecipitate the putative βPix-a complexes. As shown in Fig.1 B, the FLAG-tagged form of βPix-a was detected only when co-expressed with Myc-tagged βPix-a, indicating that these different epitope-tagged forms of βPix-a do, in fact, form oligomers in vivo when overexpressed in COS7 cells. We next examined whether the domain of βPix-a that is responsible for the oligomerization resides in the N or C terminus of the βPix-a. For this purpose, the GST-SH3 domain and the GST-C-terminal half of βPix-a were used for GST pulldown assay using Myc-tagged βPix-a overexpressed in COS7 cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the GST-C-terminal half could form a complex with Myc-tagged βPix-a, whereas the GST-SH3 domain failed to associate with the βPix-a. These results indicate that the possible intermolecular interaction of the βPix-a SH3 domain with its own proline-rich region is not involved in βPix-a oligomerization. Thus, we focused on the involvement of the C-terminal leucine zipper domain in the oligomerization of βPix-a. The region between amino acid 587 and 634 of mouse βPix-a contains several leucines that are spaced seven residues apart, a feature characteristic of leucine-zippered coiled-coil domains. Thus, we hypothesized that βPix-a could dimerize/oligomerize through this putative leucine zipper sequence. To better characterize the leucine zipper domain, we analyzed the sequences of mouse βPix-a by using the program Multicoil (20Wolf E. Kim P.S. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A, the Multicoil program predicted the existence of a coiled-coil domain capable of forming a parallel side by side homodimer in βPix-a. Although the dimer probability is very high and considered significant, the trimer peaks at the shoulders of the dimer are due to artifacts of the algorithm and are not significant. Although we cannot exclude formation of high order oligomers, we assume and will refer to this interaction as dimerization. The alignment of βPix of other species and αPix leucine zipper domains is shown in Fig. 2 B. The key features of the leucine zipper sequence are well conserved in all Pix proteins. In the search using the BLAST network, a number of other GEFs such as p115Rho-GEF and GEF-H1 did not show any homology with βPix the LZ domain. To confirm a direct interaction between the βPix-a leucine zipper domain and itself, an HA-tagged C-terminal half of βPix-a was transcribed and translated in vitro either alone or in combination with Myc-tagged full-length βPix-a (βPix-aWT) or leucine zipper domain-deleted βPix-a (βPix-aΔLZ). As shown in Fig. 3 A, βPix-aWT was co-immunoprecipitated with the HA-tagged C-terminal region, but βPix-aΔLZ failed to co-immunoprecipitate. To determine whether the leucine zipper domain is required for βPix-a homodimerizationin vivo, Myc-tagged βPix-aWT and βPix-aΔLZ were transiently transfected in COS7 cells with FLAG-tagged βPix-aWT. As shown in Fig. 3 B, FLAG-tagged βPix-aWT co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-tagged βPix-aWT but not with Myc-tagged βPix-aΔLZ. These data demonstrate that βPix-a homodimerizes in cells in a leucine zipper domain-dependent manner. Studies in transfected cells have shown that βPix-a has the potential to localize to focal adhesions and can promote the formation of membrane ruffles that co-localize with focal adhesions (12Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). To examine a role for the leucine zipper domain in βPix-a-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization such as membrane ruffle formation, NIH3T3 fibroblast cells were transfected with either Myc-tagged βPix-aWT or βPix-aΔLZ cDNAs. Expression of βPix-aWT caused formation of membrane ruffle at cell periphery, and βPix-aWT is concentrated at F-actin-rich membrane ruffle structures (Fig.4, B and C). However, in cells expressing βPix-aΔLZ, morphological changes were not exhibited, and βPix-aΔLZ showed a diffuse cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 4, D and E). Next, serum-starved cells were stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) for 10 min to induce membrane ruffles. Cells expressing βPix-aWT exhibited polarized membrane ruffles in response to PDGF (Fig. 4, G and H). The extent of membrane ruffling in cells expressing βPix-aWT was comparable with that in PDGF-stimulated nontransfected cells (Fig. 4, A andF). However, surprisingly, cells expressing the leucine zipper domain deletion mutant did not show any apparent ruffle-like structures (Fig. 4, I and J). Blocking of PDGF-induced membrane ruffling in cells expressing βPix-aΔLZ indicates that βPix-aΔLZ could function as a dominant inhibitory mutant. Diffuse cytoplasmic localization of βPix-aΔLZ suggests that it might sequester the downstream effector molecules, such as Pak and/or other βPix-a interacting proteins, essential for membrane ruffling at the cytoplasm. To examine the importance of the C terminus in βPix-a function, the effect of co-expression of βPix-aWT with βPix-a C-ter was investigated. Cells expressing βPix-aWT alone exhibited membrane ruffles as expected (Fig.5 A). However, βPix-aWT-induced membrane ruffling was inhibited in cells co-expressing βPix-aWT with βPix-a C-ter (Fig. 5 B). Quantitation of membrane ruffle-bearing cells showed that co-expression of βPix-a C-ter inhibits membrane ruffling in 60–70% of cells expressing βPix-aWT (Fig. 5 C).Figure 5Co-expression of βPix-a C-ter blocked βPix-a-induced membrane ruffling in NIH3T3 fibroblast cells. Cells were transfected with Myc-tagged βPix-aWT alone (A) or together with HA-tagged βPix-a C-ter (B), serum-starved for 16 h, and fixed. Double immunofluorescence staining for Myc-βPix-a and HA-C-ter were carried out using anti-βPix-a antiserum (30,000:1 diluted) or anti-HA antibody (data not shown), respectively. Quantitation of a typical result from three independent experiments is shown in C. Values are expressed as the percentage of membrane ruffle-bearing cells over all transfected cells. Data represent means ± S.E. from three different fields.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, we demonstrated that the leucine zipper domain at the C-terminal end of βPix-a mediates the formation of βPix-a homodimers in vitro and in vivo. The leucine zipper domain is an α-helical structure formed by several heptad repeats of hydrophobic residues, usually leucine and isoleucine, that are commonly found in nuclear transcription factors, and its role in promoting the homo- and heterodimerization of these proteins has been well characterized (21Busch S.J. Sassone-Corsi P. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 36-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 22Blank V. Andrews N.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 437-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Leucine zipper domains have also been identified in many other proteins such as protein kinases, adaptors, and cytoskeletal proteins, but their function in these proteins has been less extensively studied. Recently, it has been reported that the leucine zipper domain-dependent homodimerization of a ZIP kinase, a serine/threonine kinase, is necessary for their activity (23Kawai T. Matsumoto M. Takeda K. Sanjo H. Akira S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In the functional study of the leucine zipper domain in βPix-a-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization, we found that the deletion of the leucine zipper domain and the resulting loss of homodimerization made βPix-a fail to induce the formation of membrane ruffles in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. These results suggest that the leucine zipper domain of βPix-a plays an important role in the regulation of the βPix-a function. Recently, Yoshii et al. (24Yoshii S. Tanaka M. Otsuki Y. Wang D.Y. Guo R.J. Zhu Y. Takeda R. Hanai H. Kaneko E. Sugimura H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5680-5690Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) reported that Pix could form a complex with PDGF receptor and mediate Cdc42/Rac signaling by PDGF stimulation. Therefore, considering our results that the leucine zipper domain deletion mutant blocked completely the morphological changes of NIH3T3 cells in response to PDGF, βPix-a homodimerization is required for the PDGF receptor-mediated signaling cascade leading to the morphological changes. βPix is, to our knowledge, the first GEF protein that is demonstrated to have the ability to homodimerize through a leucine zipper domain-dependent mechanism. The roles of the coiled-coil domain of other GEFs have been reported previously. The leucine zipper domain-mediated interaction between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 transmembrane protein gp41 and p115-RhoGEF is essential for the HIV replication cycle and p115-RhoGEF-mediated stress fiber formation (25Zhang H. Wang L. Kao S. Whitehead I.P. Hart M.J. Liu B. Duus K. Burridge K. Der C.J. Su L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1271-1274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of GEF-H1, the coiled-coil domain is essential for the GEF-H1 microtubule co-localization (26Ren Y. Li R. Zheng Y. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34954-34960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Dimeric βPix proteins could function as molecular bridges to recruit and juxtapose other βPix-binding proteins such as Pak and Nck within the signaling complex. Dimer formation could also mask or expose functional domains or residues of βPix-a as a result of conformational changes that might be induced by dimerization. For example, the deletion of the leucine zipper domain of c-Cbl, a multidomain adaptor protein, caused a decrease in both the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl and its association with the epidermal growth factor receptor (27Bartkiewicz M. Houghton A. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30887-30895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Finally, it is also possible that βPix heterodimerizes with other leucine zipper domain-containing proteins or other βPix isoforms such as βPix-b and βPix-c (14Kim S. Kim T. Lee D. Park S.H. Kim H. Park D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In our preliminary data, βPix-a could interact with βPix-b and βPix-c. 2Unpublished data. Because three βPix isoforms differ in the primary structure at the C terminus, these differences may affect the abilities of βPix isoforms to interact with each other or form distinct signaling complexes, and such heterodimerization could be crucial to understand the function of βPix isoforms. In conclusion, we have shown that the putative leucine zipper domain at the C terminus of βPix-a mediates the formation of homodimers and that the homodimerization of βPix is required for the cytoskeletal changes by βPix-a overexpression. Moreover, βPix-a homodimerization plays essential roles in PDGF-mediated signaling pathway leading to morphological changes. Further studies on the role of the leucine zipper domain and βPix-a homodimerization will provide additional important insights in the regulation of βPix activities and functions."

Biol. 1996; 261: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) TBPs are extremely similar, characterized by a TBP-induced ∼80° bend in the DNA helix. TBP also binds to numerous variant TATA sequences, many of which occur naturally in promoters (5Hahn S. Buratowski S. Sharp P. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5718-5722Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 6Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3859-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). For 21 such single-point mutants of the adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP) TATA box sequence, in vitrotranscription activity was found to range from <1% to 107% of that of the reference AdMLP TATA sequence (6Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3859-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar).The wide range of observed transcription activities suggested that TBP does not bind similarly to all TATA elements. Gel electrophoresis circular permutation analysis of TBP·DNA complexes shows that the electrophoretic mobility of the complexes is TATA sequence-dependent, with bend angles from <34° to 106° inferred from the gel mobility patterns (7Starr D.B. Hoopes B.C. Hawley D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In contrast, the co-crystal structures of 11 TATA sequence variants of varying affinity bound to A. thaliana TBP are all very similar, with the DNA helix bent as in the strong promoters (3Nikolov D.B. Chen H. Halay E.D. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. Burley S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4862-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 8Patikoglou G.A. Kim J.L. Sun L. Yang S.H. Kodadek T. Burley S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3217-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar).The present study was undertaken to further explore the TATA box sequence dependence of TBP binding and DNA structure using native, full-length S. cerevisiae TBP together with the AdMLP TATA sequence and five single-base-pair variant sequences. End-to-end distance distributions for these duplexes, free and TBP-bound, were extracted from measurements of time-resolved fluorescence emission in conjunction with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Bend angles for the DNA within each of the TBP·DNA complexes were determined using three models. The reference AdMLP and five variant TATA sequences bound to TBP have significantly different mean end-to-end distances in solution. These distances are consistent with DNA bend angles ranging from 29.9° to 61.8° for the variant sequences and 76.2° for the native AdMLP. The latter bend angle is in excellent accord with the bends observed in the co-crystal structures. A strong correlation is observed between the solution bend angles and the transcription activities (6Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3859-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with the structure of TBP·TATA complexes being a principal determinant of TATA-box-dependent transcription activity. A model is proposed that reconciles the sequence dependence of bend angles and transcription activities measured in solution with the DNA structures observed in the co-crystals.DISCUSSIONTime-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer provides a rigorous approach to the determination of the structure and dynamics of macromolecules in solution. The primary experimental findings from this work are 1) the existence in solution of DNA sequence-dependent differences in the trajectory of the DNA as it passes through TBP·TATA complexes and 2) the inverse correlation between the observed DNA bend angle and the breadth of the corresponding distance distribution.DNA Bend Angles in TBP·TATA Complexes and the Corresponding Probability Distributions Are DNA Sequence-dependentThe FRET data clearly demonstrate sequence-dependent differences in the trajectory of the DNA as it passes through TBP·DNA complexes. In sharp contrast to this result and similar conclusions drawn from circular permutation and DNA phasing studies (7Starr D.B. Hoopes B.C. Hawley D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 25Bareket-Samish A. Cohen I. Haran T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 965-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), eleven variant TATA sequences bound to TBP, including all of the sequences in this study, have essentially identical ∼ 80° DNA bends in the atomic resolution structures determined for TBP·DNA co-crystals (3Nikolov D.B. Chen H. Halay E.D. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. Burley S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4862-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 8Patikoglou G.A. Kim J.L. Sun L. Yang S.H. Kodadek T. Burley S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3217-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). These contrasting results are accommodated within a two-state allosteric model, based on an equilibrium between transcriptionally active and inactive TBP·DNA conformations (discussed below). The apparent conundrum presented by the solution and co-crystal structures is then definitively explained in the accompanying paper (24Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14623-14627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Also important for consideration of the underlying mechanism of this observation are the differences in the breadths of the corresponding distance distributions provided by the time-resolved FRET data. Clearly both structure and dynamics contribute to TBP·TATA function. The AdMLP sequence alone shows only a slight increase in the value of ς, the S.D. of the end-to-end distance distribution, upon TBP binding. A plausible hypothesis is that the complementarity of the protein-duplex interface confines the helix and restricts additional motion. This slight increase in the breadth of the distribution for the tightly bound AdMLP may derive from the presence of multiple conformers at equilibrium, each with bent DNA but differing, for example, in the extent of phenylalanine intercalation (11Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1327-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). An integrated hydroxyl radical footprinting and molecular dynamics study of the TBP-AdMLP interface supports this view of its dynamic nature (26Pastor N. Weinstein H. Jamison E. Brenowitz M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 55-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).The variant sequences show a general trend toward increasingly broader distributions as the extent of bending decreases, up to Δς = 6.2 Å for the T6 variant. The inverse correlation between bending extent and distribution broadening may derive from the increasing misfit along the protein-DNA interface as helical bending decreases, including retention of solvent molecules at the interface. Indeed, complexes of TBP with the variant duplexes may be present in multiple conformations with the DNA bent very differently among those conformers, as discussed further in the following section. The broadened distribution would then result from equilibrium exchange among such conformers occurring on a time scale that is slow relative to the nanosecond time scale of the measurements, i.e.microseconds. In this case, the broader distribution of distances wouldnot derive from any high frequency torsional and bending motions of the duplex that occur on time scales faster than nanoseconds, because such motion would be averaged out in these measurements (27Okonogi T.M. Reese A.W. Alley S.C. Hopkins P.B. Robinson B.H. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 3256-3276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).A Bi-modal Distribution Model Reconciling the Solution and Co-crystal Bend AnglesA two-state model is hypothesized, unifying into a coherent perspective the sequence-dependent solution bend angles reported herein and the x-ray results in which only an AdMLP-like structure was crystallized. Each variant duplex bound to TBP is proposed to exist in two conformations, one (conformerML) with the DNA bound and bent as in the AdMLP·TBP complex and the other (conformerTI) with the DNA significantly less bent (Fig.4 A). Only conformerML has the correct geometry to allow binding of subsequent transcription proteins and effect measurable mRNA synthesis. ConformerTI is transcriptionally inactive and has the same overall conformation for all variant DNA·TBP complexes, although the local structural and energetic features of the protein-DNA interface are sequence-dependent. The presence of conformerML is assumed for all variants, because such a conformer is crystallized (except A3 (8Patikoglou G.A. Kim J.L. Sun L. Yang S.H. Kodadek T. Burley S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3217-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar)), although the solution conditions for the crystallizations differed from those employed in the present study. The two-state model provides a unifying and simple relationship among the variants to explain their observed differences in bend angle and distance distribution variance, rather than necessitating that each variant, with a unique set of conformers, be considered separately. 7This two-state model is conceptually analogous to the allosteric model, with an R-state active form, a T-state inactive form and L, the allosteric constant, defining the R-T equilibrium. Myriad hemoglobins are well described by these two states but have widely variable value of L, depending on how substitutions alter the α1β1/α2β2interface.If the equilibrium for conformerTI ↔ conformerML occurs on a time scale significantly slower than that of the nanosecond measurements, the measured fluorescence decay for a given sequence would derive from both conformers. In fact, the probability distributions for all of the bound variant duplexes, P(R)i,bound, are very well fit globally by two constrained Gaussian distributions 8Whereas at least two distinct distributions are required to fit various higher-order DNA structures (28Yang M. Millar D.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7959-7967Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), each of the structures investigated herein were very well fit by a single distribution. It is only in the model-dependent global analysis of all bound sequences that two distributions can be distinguished, in varying proportions, accounting for all observed decays. corresponding to conformerML and conformerTI,P(R)i,bound=ΦMLP(R)ML,bound+ΦTIP(R)TI,boundEquation 8 where i specifies the variant, Φ = mole fraction, and ΦTI = 1 − ΦML.

The values obtained for the two fitted parameters were RTI,bound = 53.3 Å and ςTI,bound = 9.9 Å.

The relationship of the calculated (Eq. 9) and observed bend angles (TableIII) with the mole fraction of conformerML is shown in Fig.4 B.If the exchange between conformerTI and conformerML is fast relative to subsequent binding processes, the transcription factors “see” and appear macroscopically to bind to an average TBP·DNA structure that is sequence-dependent. The model predicts that the more AdMLP-like the average binary structure, the more efficiently transcription will proceed. Implicit in this model is a correspondence between the structure of the TBP·TATA complex and transcription activity, which is explored further below.Minimal Correspondence of TBP·DNA Complex Lifetime to Bend Angle or Transcriptional ActivityHawley and coworkers (7Starr D.B. Hoopes B.C. Hawley D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), inferring bend angles from gel mobility shifts for TBP-bound AdMLP and eight variant sequences, also observed sequence-dependent differences in bend angles. However, for the sequences common to both studies, those angles differ from those reported herein in magnitude, by up to a factor of two, but more significantly, in the ordering of sequences by decreasing bend.Although a correlation was asserted between bend angles inferred from circular permutation analysis and TBP·TATA complex stability (7Starr D.B. Hoopes B.C. Hawley D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), careful inspection of those data reveal a minimal correspondence between these two properties. A plot of the lifetime of the TBP·DNA complex versus bend angle from Table I (7Starr D.B. Hoopes B.C. Hawley D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) shows no general linear correlation (correlation = 0.76, coefficient of determination = 0.59); rather, the data form two distinct sets. The first of these sets of five sequences is composed of unstable TBP·TATA complexes, with lifetimes ≤ 0.08 that of the wild type, but with bend angles ranging from <34° to 80°. The second set of five sequences, constituting a step function relative to the first set, includes only severe bends, from 80° to 106°, but lifetimes that vary 23-fold, from 0.08 to 1.85 that of the wild type. This conclusion is further supported by the recent work of Bareket-Samish et al. (25Bareket-Samish A. Cohen I. Haran T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 965-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), who report no correlation between TBP·TATA complex stability and DNA bend angles determined similarly using gel phasing analysis.The data of Hawley and coworkers also show a minimal correspondence between transcription activities and the lifetimes of the TBP·DNA complex. A plot of the lifetime of the TBP·DNA complexversus transcription activity (Ref. 7Starr D.B. Hoopes B.C. Hawley D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, Table I) shows roughly two data sets, with a poor linear relationship (correlation = 0.73, coefficient of determination = 0.54).DNA Bends in TBP·DNA Complexes Are Highly Correlated with Relative Transcription ActivityThe correlation between the solution bend angles determined in the present study and the corresponding in vivo and in vitro transcription activities reported by Wobbe and Struhl (6Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3859-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) are shown in Figs.5, A and B, respectively. The same correlation is observed upon comparison with either the HeLa TFIID or yeast TBP in in vitro transcription assays. Two possible explanations for this correlation present themselves. First, the observed differences in transcription activity are structurally based, resulting fundamentally from the sequence-dependent differences in the DNA bend angles in the binary complexes, or second, they derive simply from different levels of saturation of the TATA site by TBP, due to sequence-dependent differences in binding affinity. The concentrations of HeLa and yeast TBP used in the in vitroassays were reported to be saturating under the experimental conditions of those studies (6Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3859-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). We therefore conclude that the >100-fold differences observed in transcription efficiency could not have arisen from differences in TBP·DNA affinity.Figure 5The correlation between the solution bend angles of the TBP-bound duplexes and the corresponding in vivo (A) and in vitro(B) transcription activities reported by Wobbe and Struhl (6Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3859-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), with the activity of the AdMLP sequence set at ++ and 1.00, respectively. The bend angles were determined using the two-kink model (Fig. 2 B). For B, the correlation = 0.98 and the coefficient of determination = 0.97. These data show a minimal relationship between transcription activity and the association equilibrium constant (correlation = 0.88 and coefficient of determination = 0.77).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Suppose, however, that only the tightly bound AdMLP sequence was saturated and the variant sequences were fractionally saturated in accord with their respective binding constants, so that transcription activity did reflect differences in affinity. Then, for example, were the AdMLP sequence 95% bound (as a lower limit), the transcription activity for the T6 sequence would be 86% that of AdMLP, based on theKa values shown in Table I. In contrast, the experimentally observed transcription activity for T6 was only 10% that of AdMLP (6Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3859-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Thus, several independent lines of evidence support the conclusion that differences in TBP·DNA binding affinity cannot account for the observed differences in transcription efficiency.In contrast, a significant correlation is observed between the solution bend angles and transcription activity. Wobbe and Struhl (6Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3859-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) similarly concluded that the in vivo activity of a TATA element is directly affected by the binary TBP·TATA structure. This conclusion was based on the close similarity between the in vitroactivity of yeast TBP (and human TFIID) and transcription activity in yeast cells. The strong correspondence between the solution geometry of the TBP·DNA complex and transcription activity is further supported by a comparison of Figs. 4 B and 5B. The relationship between transcription efficiency and bend angle is strikingly similar to the relationship between the fractional population of the allosteric conformerML and bend angle. The extent to which conformerML is populated, for a given sequence, thus closely corresponds to the relative transcription activity.The relatively large values of ς determined herein for the bound duplexes with less favorable TATA box sequences are consistent with low frequency DNA flexibility within the binary complexes. Such duplex motions cannot be effectively distinguished from multiple conformations (29Naimushin A.N. Fujimoto B.S. Schurr J.M. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1498-1518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The observed correlation between the extent of DNA bending and transcription activity thus leads us to propose that the probability for a given TBP·TATA complex to assume the conformation required for binding of subsequent proteins determines the corresponding transcription efficiency. For the bound variants, as the deviation from ∼ 80° increases, severe distortions of the duplex DNA to approach 80° become increasingly less probable. In terms of such fluctuations, a dependence of transcription efficiency on the average conformation of the binary TBP·promoter complex seems reasonable. Both biochemical and crystallographic results show that flanking sequences up- and downstream of the TATA box are contacted by TFIIA (30Lagrange T. Kim T.-K. Orphanides G. Ebright Y.W. Ebright R.H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19962-19967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and TFIIB (32Lee S. Hahn S. Nature. 1995; 376: 609-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 33Lagrange T.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), with TFIIB contacting both. Appropriately bent DNA in the TBP·DNA target may thus be critical for formation of stable ternary and quaternary complexes involving these proteins.The trajectories of the helical axes resulting from different bends diverge rapidly (Fig. 6). For example, for a 14-bp duplex centered on the TATA box, the difference in the 5′-3′ distance between a 40° and an 80° bend is ∼4 Å. Extension of the duplex by only 6 bp up- and downstream, for example, more than triples that difference, from ∼4 to ∼13 Å. TBP-bound T6 and AdMLP have angles of ∼40° and ∼80°, respectively, and 6-bp extensions correspond generally to the flanking contact regions for TFIIA and -B. Formation of a stable higher-order structure is thus predicted to be less probable for the TBP·T6 complex than for the TBP·AdMLP complex, due to the spatial requirements.Figure 6The helical trajectories corresponding to 40° (dotted lines) and 80° (solid lines) DNA bends. The lighter segments of each trajectory correspond to that part of the 14-mer duplex beyond the 5′ and 3′ phenylalanine insertion sites, beginning with positions −31 and −24, respectively. The −20 position downstream of the TATA box (●) and the −38 position upstream (○) delineate the TFIIB contact regions and the −42 position (⊗), the TFIIA contact region. The distance between the up- and downstream TFIIB contacts (double arrows) differs by ∼7 Å for 40° (T6) and 80° (AdMLP) bends.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In drawing a correlation between the apparent bend angle and transcriptional activity, however, consideration must be given to the experimental conditions of the respective studies. The in vitro transcription assays were performed in the presence of osmolyte (6Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3859-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 35Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4394-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). As shown in the accompanying paper (24Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14623-14627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the conformations of some bound variant sequences are sensitive to the presence of osmolyte. Because a significant correlation is observed between bend angle and transcriptional activity both in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 5, A andB), it is plausible that the extremely small differences in energy between conformers for these sequences (24Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14623-14627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) are compensated in osmolyte by protein·protein interactions among multiple transcription factors. How the binding of even one additional transcription protein, in osmolyte, might affect the equilibrium among sequence-dependent TBP·DNA conformers is not known. Thus, effects of osmolytes on the conformation of the binary complex within multiprotein complexes require further exploration.However, unequivocal new insight is provided by elucidation of the solution structures of TBP·AdMLP and TBP·A3. These binary complexes with the high and low extremes of the observed bend angles correspond to the high and low extremes of transcriptional activity. The solution geometries of these two complexes are insensitive to the presence of osmolyte (24Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14623-14627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and establish clearly the relationship between transcription activity and the structure of the binary complex.ConclusionsThe geometries of the TBP-bound variant TATA sequences in solution vary significantly and differ from their corresponding co-crystal structures. These solution conformations are consistent with DNA bend angles ranging from ∼30 to ∼76° based on a two-kink bending model. A strong correlation between the solution bend angles and relative transcription activity, but not with TBP·DNA affinity, is observed. This correlation is particularly notable, because efficient transcription requires complex geometric relationships among many proteins and to summarize such complexity with a single, simple bend angle must be, to some extent, an oversimplification.This model contrasts with models in which the TBP·DNA binary complex structure is conserved (8Patikoglou G.A. Kim J.L. Sun L. Yang S.H. Kodadek T. Burley S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3217-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and sequence-dependent differences in transcription efficiency derive primarily from sequence-dependent differences in the stability of that complex (7Starr D.B. Hoopes B.C. Hawley D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 8Patikoglou G.A. Kim J.L. Sun L. Yang S.H. Kodadek T. Burley S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3217-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Our results support a model in which transcription efficiency derives in significant part from the sequence-dependent structure of the TBP·TATA binary complex. More specifically, the distance distribution for the average solution structure of the TBP·TATA complex may reflect the sequence-dependent probability for the complex to assume a conformation in which the TATA box DNA is severely bent. Upon assumption of this geometry, the binary complex becomes a target for binding and co"

ARG phosphorylates Siva-1 in the cellular response to oxidative stress and induces apoptosis by a Siva-1-dependent mechanism.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo extend the findings in the yeast two-hybrid system that ARG associates with the pro-apoptotic Siva-1 protein (data not shown), lysates from MCF-7 cells expressing Flag-tagged ARG and GFP-tagged human Siva-1 were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag. Analysis of the precipitates by immunoblotting with anti-GFP demonstrated the presence of ARG-Siva-1 complexes (Fig.1A, left). Analysis of anti-Flag immunoprecipitates from cells expressing Flag-Siva-1 by immunoblotting with anti-ARG provided further support for binding of ARG and Siva-1 (Fig. 1A, right). To extend these findings, lysates from cells expressing Flag-ARG were incubated with a GST-Siva-1 fusion protein. Analysis of the adsorbates with anti-Flag confirmed the binding of ARG and Siva-1 (Fig. 1B). Other studies with GST fusion proteins prepared from the ARG SH2 and ARG SH3 domains demonstrated that both confer binding to Siva-1 (Fig. 1C). By contrast, binding of GST-ARG SH2, but not GST-ARG SH3, was detectable to the shorter, nonapoptotic Siva-2 protein (Fig.1D). Human Siva-1, but not Siva-2, contains a proline-rich PESP sequence (amino acids 82–85) for potential binding to ARG SH3. Notably, however, the PESP site is not conserved in mouse Siva-1 (22Prasad K.V. Ao Z. Yoon Y. Wu M.X. Rizk M. Jacquot S. Schlossman S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6346-6351Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar,23Yoon Y. Ao Z. Cheng Y. Schlossman S.F. Prasad K.V. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7174-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this regard, GST-ARG SH2, and not GST-ARG SH3, binds to mouse Siva-1 (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that the ARG SH2 domain interacts with Siva-1 and Siva-2 of both human and mouse origin and that binding of the ARG SH3 domain is also detectable with human Siva-1.To determine whether Siva-1 is a substrate for ARG, GST-Siva-1 was incubated with kinase-active ARG (Fig.2A, left) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Analysis of the reaction products by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography demonstrated phosphorylation of Siva-1 (Fig. 2A, right). As a control, there was no detectable phosphorylation when Siva-1 was incubated with kinase-inactive ARG(K-R) in which Lys337 in the ATP binding site was mutated to Arg (Fig. 2A). There are two potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites in Siva-1 that are located at Tyr48 and Tyr67. Mutation of these sites to Phe and then incubation of the mutant proteins with ARG demonstrated abrogation of phosphorylation with GST-Siva-1(Y48F), but not with GST-Siva-1(Y67F) (Fig. 2A, right). To assess whether ARG phosphorylates Siva-1 in vivo, Flag-Siva-1 was coexpressed with ARG and lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-P-Tyr. The results show that Siva-1 is phosphorylated by ARG in cells (Fig.2B). By contrast, there was no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of Flag-Siva-1 when this vector was coexpressed with ARG(K-R) (data not shown). Although Flag-Siva-1(Y67F) was also phosphorylated by ARG, there was no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of Flag-Siva-1(Y48F) (Fig. 2B). In concert with these findings and the presence of Tyr48 in Siva-2, coexpression of Siva-2 with ARG, but not ARG(K-R), also resulted in detectable tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). These findings thus provided support for ARG-mediated phosphorylation of Siva-1 and Siva-2 on Tyr48in vitro and in vivo. To determine whether ARG, like c-Abl (20Sun X. Wu F. Datta R. Kharbanda S.

Analysis of anti-Flag immunoprecipitates for phosphorylation of GST-Siva-1 demonstrated H2O2concentration-dependent induction of ARG activity (Fig.2C). As a control, the same anti-Flag immunoprecipitates failed to phosphorylate GST-Siva-1(Y48F) (Fig. 2C). In studies of wild-type and arg−/−MEFs, expression of Flag-Siva-1 resulted in little if any detectable phosphorylation (Fig. 2D).

By contrast, there was no detectable phosphorylation of Flag-Siva-1 in H2O2-treatedarg−/− MEFs (Fig. 2D).

There was no detectable effect of ARG or ARG(K-R) expression on MCF-7 cell growth (data not shown) or cell cycle distribution (Fig.3A). Expression of Siva-1 in the wild-type MCF-7 cells was associated with the appearance of apoptotic cells containing sub-G1 DNA (Fig. 3A). Whereas Siva-1-induced apoptosis was more pronounced in MCF-7/ARG cells, expression of Siva-1 had little if any effect on MCF-7/ARG(K-R) cells (Fig. 3A). As a control, expression of Siva-2 resulted in substantially less apoptosis in MCF-7/ARG cells as compared with that obtained with Siva-1, and had no effect on the wild-type MCF-7 and MCF-7/ARG(K-R) cells (Fig. 3A). To extend these findings, Siva-1 was expressed in the wild-type andarg−/− MEFs. The results demonstrate that, although Siva-1 induces apoptosis in wild-type cells, there was little effect of Siva-1 in the absence of ARG expression (Fig. 3B). In concert with the finding that ARG phosphorylates Siva-1 on Tyr48, the expression of Siva-1(Y48F) had little effect on the induction of apoptosis, whereas the proapoptotic effects of Siva-1(Y67F) were similar to those obtained with wild-type Siva-1 (Fig. 3C). These findings demonstrate that Siva-1-induced apoptosis is dependent on the ARG kinase function and that ARG-mediated phosphorylation of Siva-1 on Tyr48 is a proapoptotic signal.Figure 3Interaction ofARGand Siva-1 in the apoptotic response to oxidative stress.A, MCF-7, MCF-7/ARG, and MCF-7/ARG(K-R) cells were transfected to express GFP-Siva-1 or GFP-Siva-2.

The present results provide evidence for involvement of ARG in the cellular response to oxidative stress. Moreover, the induction of apoptosis by oxidative stress is attenuated in ARG-deficient cells. These findings indicate that, in addition to regulating the actin cytoskeleton, ARG functions in ROS-mediated signals that induce an apoptotic response.Siva-1 interacts with members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family and induces apoptosis in diverse cells (22Prasad K.V.

Siva-1 has also been implicated in the induction of Coxsackievirus-induced apoptosis (29Henke A. Launhardt H. Klement K. Stelzner A. Zell R. Munder T. J.

By contrast, the interaction between ARG and Siva-1, but not Siva-2, is associated with the induction of apoptosis. Our results also demonstrate that mutation of the Siva-1 Tyr48 site abrogates the apoptotic function of Siva-1 and that apoptosis induced by Siva-1 is dependent on expression of kinase-active ARG. These findings thus define ARG as an upstream effector of Siva-1 in the apoptotic response to oxidative stress.

The C-terminal regions of c-Abl and ARG share 29% identity and are distinguished from other nonreceptor tyrosine kinases by the presence of globular (G) and filamentous (F) actin-binding domains (3Van Etten R.A.

The c-Abl protein is expressed in the nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas ARG has been detected predominately in the cytoplasm (4Wang B. Kruh G.D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 193-197PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the C-terminal region of c-Abl differs from ARG by the presence of a nuclear localization signal (5Van Etten R.A. Jackson P. Baltimore D.

No functional role has been ascribed to ARG as a cell signaling molecule. The present studies demonstrate that ARG interacts with the proapoptotic Siva-1 protein (22Prasad K.V. Ao Z. Yoon Y. Wu M.X.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7174-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). ARG phosphorylates Siva-1 in the cellular response to oxidative stress and induces apoptosis by a Siva-1-dependent mechanism. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo extend the findings in the yeast two-hybrid system that ARG associates with the pro-apoptotic Siva-1 protein (data not shown), lysates from MCF-7 cells expressing Flag-tagged ARG and GFP-tagged human Siva-1 were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag. Analysis of the precipitates by immunoblotting with anti-GFP demonstrated the presence of ARG-Siva-1 complexes (Fig.1A, left). Analysis of anti-Flag immunoprecipitates from cells expressing Flag-Siva-1 by immunoblotting with anti-ARG provided further support for binding of ARG and Siva-1 (Fig. 1A, right). To extend these findings, lysates from cells expressing Flag-ARG were incubated with a GST-Siva-1 fusion protein. Analysis of the adsorbates with anti-Flag confirmed the binding of ARG and Siva-1 (Fig. 1B). Other studies with GST fusion proteins prepared from the ARG SH2 and ARG SH3 domains demonstrated that both confer binding to Siva-1 (Fig. 1C). By contrast, binding of GST-ARG SH2, but not GST-ARG SH3, was detectable to the shorter, nonapoptotic Siva-2 protein (Fig.1D). Human Siva-1, but not Siva-2, contains a proline-rich PESP sequence (amino acids 82–85) for potential binding to ARG SH3. Notably, however, the PESP site is not conserved in mouse Siva-1 (22Prasad K.V. Ao Z. Yoon Y. Wu M.X. Rizk M. Jacquot S. Schlossman S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6346-6351Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar,23Yoon Y. Ao Z. Cheng Y. Schlossman S.F. Prasad K.V. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7174-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this regard, GST-ARG SH2, and not GST-ARG SH3, binds to mouse Siva-1 (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that the ARG SH2 domain interacts with Siva-1 and Siva-2 of both human and mouse origin and that binding of the ARG SH3 domain is also detectable with human Siva-1.To determine whether Siva-1 is a substrate for ARG, GST-Siva-1 was incubated with kinase-active ARG (Fig.2A, left) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Analysis of the reaction products by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography demonstrated phosphorylation of Siva-1 (Fig. 2A, right). As a control, there was no detectable phosphorylation when Siva-1 was incubated with kinase-inactive ARG(K-R) in which Lys337 in the ATP binding site was mutated to Arg (Fig. 2A). There are two potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites in Siva-1 that are located at Tyr48 and Tyr67. Mutation of these sites to Phe and then incubation of the mutant proteins with ARG demonstrated abrogation of phosphorylation with GST-Siva-1(Y48F), but not with GST-Siva-1(Y67F) (Fig. 2A, right). To assess whether ARG phosphorylates Siva-1 in vivo, Flag-Siva-1 was coexpressed with ARG and lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-P-Tyr. The results show that Siva-1 is phosphorylated by ARG in cells (Fig.2B). By contrast, there was no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of Flag-Siva-1 when this vector was coexpressed with ARG(K-R) (data not shown). Although Flag-Siva-1(Y67F) was also phosphorylated by ARG, there was no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of Flag-Siva-1(Y48F) (Fig. 2B). In concert with these findings and the presence of Tyr48 in Siva-2, coexpression of Siva-2 with ARG, but not ARG(K-R), also resulted in detectable tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). These findings thus provided support for ARG-mediated phosphorylation of Siva-1 and Siva-2 on Tyr48in vitro and in vivo. To determine whether ARG, like c-Abl (20Sun X. Wu F. Datta R. Kharbanda S.

Analysis of anti-Flag immunoprecipitates for phosphorylation of GST-Siva-1 demonstrated H2O2concentration-dependent induction of ARG activity (Fig.2C). As a control, the same anti-Flag immunoprecipitates failed to phosphorylate GST-Siva-1(Y48F) (Fig. 2C). In studies of wild-type and arg−/−MEFs, expression of Flag-Siva-1 resulted in little if any detectable phosphorylation (Fig. 2D). Treatment of the wild-type cells with H2O2, however, was associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of Flag-Siva-1 (Fig. 2D). By contrast, there was no detectable phosphorylation of Flag-Siva-1 in H2O2-treatedarg−/− MEFs (Fig. 2D). These findings demonstrate that activation of ARG by H2O2 is associated with phosphorylation of Siva-1 on Tyr48.To assess the functional significance of the ARG-Siva-1 interaction, MCF-7 cells were prepared that stably express ARG or the ARG(K-R) mutant.

Siva-1 has also been implicated in the induction of Coxsackievirus-induced apoptosis (29Henke A. Launhardt H. Klement K. Stelzner A. Zell R. Munder T. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4284-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Full-length Siva-1 but not Siva-2, which lacks sequences encoded by exon 2, induces the apoptotic response (23Yoon Y. Ao Z. Cheng Y. Schlossman S.F. Prasad K.V. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7174-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The present studies demonstrate that ARG phosphorylates both Siva-1 and Siva-2. By contrast, the interaction between ARG and Siva-1, but not Siva-2, is associated with the induction of apoptosis. Our results also demonstrate that mutation of the Siva-1 Tyr48 site abrogates the apoptotic function of Siva-1 and that apoptosis induced by Siva-1 is dependent on expression of kinase-active ARG. These findings thus define ARG as an upstream effector of Siva-1 in the apoptotic response to oxidative stress. To extend the findings in the yeast two-hybrid system that ARG associates with the pro-apoptotic Siva-1 protein (data not shown), lysates from MCF-7 cells expressing Flag-tagged ARG and GFP-tagged human Siva-1 were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag. Analysis of the precipitates by immunoblotting with anti-GFP demonstrated the presence of ARG-Siva-1 complexes (Fig.1A, left). Analysis of anti-Flag immunoprecipitates from cells expressing Flag-Siva-1 by immunoblotting with anti-ARG provided further support for binding of ARG and Siva-1 (Fig. 1A, right). To extend these findings, lysates from cells expressing Flag-ARG were incubated with a GST-Siva-1 fusion protein. Analysis of the adsorbates with anti-Flag confirmed the binding of ARG and Siva-1 (Fig. 1B). Other studies with GST fusion proteins prepared from the ARG SH2 and ARG SH3 domains demonstrated that both confer binding to Siva-1 (Fig. 1C). By contrast, binding of GST-ARG SH2, but not GST-ARG SH3, was detectable to the shorter, nonapoptotic Siva-2 protein (Fig.1D). Human Siva-1, but not Siva-2, contains a proline-rich PESP sequence (amino acids 82–85) for potential binding to ARG SH3. Notably, however, the PESP site is not conserved in mouse Siva-1 (22Prasad K.V. Ao Z. Yoon Y. Wu M.X. Rizk M. Jacquot S. Schlossman S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6346-6351Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar,23Yoon Y. Ao Z. Cheng Y. Schlossman S.F. Prasad K.V. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7174-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this regard, GST-ARG SH2, and not GST-ARG SH3, binds to mouse Siva-1 (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that the ARG SH2 domain interacts with Siva-1 and Siva-2 of both human and mouse origin and that binding of the ARG SH3 domain is also detectable with human Siva-1. To determine whether Siva-1 is a substrate for ARG, GST-Siva-1 was incubated with kinase-active ARG (Fig.2A, left) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Analysis of the reaction products by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography demonstrated phosphorylation of Siva-1 (Fig. 2A, right). As a control, there was no detectable phosphorylation when Siva-1 was incubated with kinase-inactive ARG(K-R) in which Lys337 in the ATP binding site was mutated to Arg (Fig. 2A). There are two potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites in Siva-1 that are located at Tyr48 and Tyr67. Mutation of these sites to Phe and then incubation of the mutant proteins with ARG demonstrated abrogation of phosphorylation with GST-Siva-1(Y48F), but not with GST-Siva-1(Y67F) (Fig. 2A, right). To assess whether ARG phosphorylates Siva-1 in vivo, Flag-Siva-1 was coexpressed with ARG and lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-P-Tyr. The results show that Siva-1 is phosphorylated by ARG in cells (Fig.2B). By contrast, there was no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of Flag-Siva-1 when this vector was coexpressed with ARG(K-R) (data not shown). Although Flag-Siva-1(Y67F) was also phosphorylated by ARG, there was no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of Flag-Siva-1(Y48F) (Fig. 2B). In concert with these findings and the presence of Tyr48 in Siva-2, coexpression of Siva-2 with ARG, but not ARG(K-R), also resulted in detectable tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). These findings thus provided support for ARG-mediated phosphorylation of Siva-1 and Siva-2 on Tyr48in vitro and in vivo. To determine whether ARG, like c-Abl (20Sun X. Wu F. Datta R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7470-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 21Sun X. Majumder P. Shioya H. Wu F. Kumar S. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J.

Analysis of anti-Flag immunoprecipitates for phosphorylation of GST-Siva-1 demonstrated H2O2concentration-dependent induction of ARG activity (Fig.2C). As a control, the same anti-Flag immunoprecipitates failed to phosphorylate GST-Siva-1(Y48F) (Fig. 2C). In studies of wild-type and arg−/−MEFs, expression of Flag-Siva-1 resulted in little if any detectable phosphorylation (Fig. 2D). Treatment of the wild-type cells with H2O2, however, was associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of Flag-Siva-1 (Fig. 2D). By contrast, there was no detectable phosphorylation of Flag-Siva-1 in H2O2-treatedarg−/− MEFs (Fig. 2D). These findings demonstrate that activation of ARG by H2O2 is associated with phosphorylation of Siva-1 on Tyr48. To assess the functional significance of the ARG-Siva-1 interaction, MCF-7 cells were prepared that stably express ARG or the ARG(K-R) mutant. There was no detectable effect of ARG or ARG(K-R) expression on MCF-7 cell growth (data not shown) or cell cycle distribution (Fig.3A). Expression of Siva-1 in the wild-type MCF-7 cells was associated with the appearance of apoptotic cells containing sub-G1 DNA (Fig. 3A). Whereas Siva-1-induced apoptosis was more pronounced in MCF-7/ARG cells, expression of Siva-1 had little if any effect on MCF-7/ARG(K-R) cells (Fig. 3A). As a control, expression of Siva-2 resulted in substantially less apoptosis in MCF-7/ARG cells as compared with that obtained with Siva-1, and had no effect on the wild-type MCF-7 and MCF-7/ARG(K-R) cells (Fig. 3A). To extend these findings, Siva-1 was expressed in the wild-type andarg−/− MEFs. The results demonstrate that, although Siva-1 induces apoptosis in wild-type cells, there was little effect of Siva-1 in the absence of ARG expression (Fig. 3B). In concert with the finding that ARG phosphorylates Siva-1 on Tyr48, the expression of Siva-1(Y48F) had little effect on the induction of apoptosis, whereas the proapoptotic effects of Siva-1(Y67F) were similar to those obtained with wild-type Siva-1 (Fig. 3C). These findings demonstrate that Siva-1-induced apoptosis is dependent on the ARG kinase function and that ARG-mediated phosphorylation of Siva-1 on Tyr48 is a proapoptotic signal. As the findings demonstrate that ARG is activated by ROS, H2O2-induced apoptosis was assessed in the MCF-7, MCF-7/ARG, and MCF-7/ARG(K-R) cells. The results demonstrate that the apoptotic effects of H2O2 are attenuated in MCF-7/ARG(K-R) as compared with wild-type MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4A). Notably, however, there was a marked increase in H2O2-induced apoptosis in MCF-7/ARG cells (Fig. 4A). The apoptotic effects of H2O2 were attenuated inarg−/− (two separate embryos) as compared with wild-type MEFs (Fig. 4B). Moreover, expression of ARG in arg−/− cells corrected the defect in H2O2-induced apoptosis (Fig.4C). The ARG tyrosine kinase has, like c-Abl, been associated with the development of leukemia (25Cazzaniga G. Tosi S. Aloisi A. Giudici G. Daniotti M. Pioltelli P. Kearney L. Biondi A.

Genetic studies inDrosophila have indicated that Abl family kinases regulate cellular morphology through interactions with the cytoskeleton (27Gertler F.B. Bennett R.L. Clark M.J. Hoffmann F.M.

The present results provide evidence for involvement of ARG in the cellular response to oxidative stress. Moreover, the induction of apoptosis by oxidative stress is attenuated in ARG-deficient cells. These findings indicate that, in addition to regulating the actin cytoskeleton, ARG functions in ROS-mediated signals that induce an apoptotic response. Siva-1 interacts with members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family and induces apoptosis in diverse cells (22Prasad K.V. Ao Z. Yoon Y. Wu M.X. Rizk M. Jacquot S. Schlossman S.F. Proc. Natl.

We demonstrate here that ATM modulates c-Jun phosphorylation following exposure to ionizing radiation as well as treatment with CdCl2, a potent pro-oxidant. Exposure of AT and control fibroblasts to CdCl2 induced a biphasic increase in c-Jun phosphorylation on serine residues 63 and 73, with the extent of the second phase being markedly greater in AT cells than in control cells. Heme oxygenase-1, a marker of oxidative stress, was also significantly induced in AT fibroblasts. Expression of recombinant ATM in AT fibroblasts, however, reduced the extent of the effects of CdCl2 on both c-Jun phosphorylation and heme oxygenase-1 induction.

We have previously shown that the ionizing radiation-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun on these two residues that is apparent in normal human fibroblasts does not occur in AT fibroblasts, whereas ultraviolet radiation-induced phosphorylation of these sites is intact in both types of cells (37Lee S.A. Dritschilo A. Jung M. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 32889-32894Google Scholar). We have proposed that the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), which is responsible for the phosphorylation of c-Jun and is present in the nucleus of both normal and AT fibroblasts, is subjected to negative regulation that is relieved on exposure of normal cells to ionizing radiation (37Lee S.A. Dritschilo A. Jung M. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 32889-32894Google Scholar). We now demonstrate a role for ATM in oxidative stress-induced JNK activation and c-Jun phosphorylation. Our data indicate that ATM functions as a sensor of ionizing radiation-generated oxidative stress and as a modulator of intracellular redox regulatory systems in cells exposed to ionizing radiation or the potent pro-oxidant CdCl2. NAC, BSO, and CdCl2 were obtained from Sigma. The GST-c-Jun-(1–89) fusion protein was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies to c-Jun and to HO-1 were from Transduction Laboratories; those specific for c-Jun phosphorylated on Ser63 or on Ser73 were from Cell Signaling Technology; those specific for JNK phosphorylated on Thr183and Tyr185 were from Promega; and those to ATM were from Calbiochem. Normal human fibroblasts (MRC5CV1) and AT fibroblasts (AT5BIVA, AT4BIVA, and AT3BIVA) were cultured under 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 15% (normal cells) or 20% (AT cells) fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mmsodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml).

Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys... 1997; 37: 417-422Google Scholar). Before exposure of cells to ionizing radiation or CdCl2, the culture medium was replaced with serum-free medium for 24 h. Irradiation was performed at room temperature with a JL Shepherd Mark I Radiator containing a 137Cs source emitting at a fixed dose rate of 3.83 Gy/min. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping from the culture dishes into ice-cold equilibration buffer (EB) (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors (52Lee S.A.

The cytosolic fraction was then isolated by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm (25,000 × g) for 1 min, and the resulting pellet was washed once with EB, resuspended in a nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.42 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, and protease inhibitors), and incubated on ice for 1 h with occasional vortexing. The extracted nuclear proteins were isolated by centrifugation at 50,000 × gfor 30 min. Protein concentration was determined with the Bradford assay (53Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem... 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Subcellular fractions were denatured by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, which was then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline before exposure overnight at 4 °C to primary antibodies. Immune complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Phamacia Biotech). The kinase activity of JNK was assayed in vitro by incubation of cytosolic or nuclear proteins for 15 min at 30 °C with 5 μg of GST-c-Jun-(1–89) in 20 μl of kinase buffer (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP). Phosphorylated GST-c-Jun-(1–89) (as well as phosphorylated endogenous c-Jun) was detected by immunoblot analysis with antibody specific for c-Jun phosphorylated on Ser73. The intracellular accumulation of Cd2+ generates oxidative stress (4Stohs S.J. Bagchi D. Free Radic. Biol. Med... 1995; 18: 321-336Google Scholar, 5Acan N.L. Tezcan E.F. Biochem. Mol.

To investigate whether c-Jun is activated in response to exposure of cells to Cd2+, we first examined c-Jun phosphorylation on Ser63 and Ser73 in normal human fibroblasts (MRC5CV1) and AT fibroblasts (AT5BIVA) after incubation with 10 μm CdCl2 for various times. Nuclear extracts were prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for c-Jun phosphorylated on Ser73 (Fig. 1 A). A biphasic pattern of c-Jun phosphorylation was apparent in both MRC5CV1 and AT5BIVA cells. The first phase of c-Jun phosphorylation was characterized by a gradual increase that reached a maximum at ∼4 h after exposure to CdCl2 and had decreased to control values by 7 h in both normal and AT cells. Although the extent of the increase in c-Jun phosphorylation at 4 h was similar in both cell types, it was consistently slightly greater in AT5BIVA cells (6-fold) than in MRC5CV1 cells (5-fold). The onset of the second phase of c-Jun phosphorylation was apparent 12 h after exposure to CdCl2 and reached a maximum at 16–24 h. In contrast to the similar pattern of the first phase apparent in these two cell lines, the pattern of the second phase of c-Jun phosphorylation differed markedly between the normal and AT cells. Whereas MRC5CV1 cells exhibited only a 3-fold increase in c-Jun phosphorylation by 24 h, AT5BIVA cells showed an ∼25-fold increase at both 16 and 24 h after exposure to CdCl2. A similar pattern of c-Jun phosphorylation on Ser63 was also observed in both MRC5CV1 and AT5BIVA cells in response to CdCl2 (Fig.1 B). Activation of JNK is mediated by phosphorylation of the threonine and tyrosine residues within the TPY motif at positions 183–185 (54Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature.. 1994; 372: 794-798Google Scholar, 55Dérijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. David R.J. Science.. 1995; 267: 682-685Google Scholar, 56Lin A.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1997; 94: 7337-7342Google Scholar). Substantial amounts of p46 and p55 isoforms of JNK are present in both nucleus and cytosol of MRC5CV1 and AT5BIVA cells (37Lee S.A. Dritschilo A. Jung M. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 32889-32894Google Scholar). Furthermore, the dually phosphorylated form of p46 JNK, but not p55 isoform, is constitutively present in the nucleus of these cells (37Lee S.A. Dritschilo A. Jung M. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 32889-32894Google Scholar). Treatment with 10 μm CdCl2 for 16 h had no effect on the abundance of JNK isoforms in either the nucleus or cytosol of these cells (data not shown). However, immunoblot analysis with antibody specific for the active, dually phosphorylated form of JNK revealed that phosphorylation of the p46 isoform present in the nucleus of AT5BIVA cells was increased within 10 h after exposure to CdCl2 (Fig.2 A). Furthermore, phosphorylation of the p55 isoform was induced at 16 h after exposure of these cells to CdCl2 and sustained up to 24 h. These data suggest that both JNK isoforms are activated in response to CdCl2 in AT5BIVA cells and that the marked, second phase phosphorylation of c-Jun in AT5BIVA cells (Fig. 1,A and B) is, at least in part, attributed to the phosphorylation of p55 isoform of JNK. The phosphorylation of an unidentified protein that reacted with the antibodies to dually phosphorylated JNK also appeared to be increased 10 and 16 h after exposure of AT5BIVA cells to CdCl2 and sustained up to 24 h (Fig. 2 A). We next examined the effect of CdCl2 treatment of MRC5CV1 and AT5BIVA cells for various times to CdCl2 on JNK activity measured in cytosolic and nuclear fractions by performingin vitro kinase assay with a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing residues 1–89 of c-Jun as substrate. Phosphorylated GST-c-Jun-(1–89) was detected by immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for c-Jun phosphorylated on Ser73. Exposure of cells to CdCl2 induced a biphasic increase in JNK activity in nuclear fraction of MRC5CV1 and AT5BIVA cells (Fig. 2 B). In MRC5CV1 cells, the activity of JNK in the nucleus, as revealed by the phosphorylation of the GST-c-Jun-(1–89) fusion protein as well as by that of endogenous c-Jun, showed two peaks at 4 and 24 h. Cytosolic JNK activity showed a similar pattern of induction (data not shown). In AT5BIVA cells, the activity of JNK in the nucleus peaked at 4 and 16–24 h. Overall, the pattern of JNK activity as revealed by phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun-(1–89) did not differ substantially between MRC5CV1 and AT5BIVA cells, suggesting that the greater extent of the second phase of CdCl2-induced phosphorylation of endogenous c-Jun apparent in AT5BIVA cells is not attributable to a greater increase in JNK activity in vitro. These data also implicate that different isoforms of JNK may participate in different phases for c-Jun phosphorylation in response to CdCl2. Alternatively, another mechanism, which involves residues other than amino acids 1–89, is associated with the second phase of c-Jun phosphorylation. Recently, JNK-independent phosphorylation of c-Jun on serine 63 and 73 residues has been demonstrated by a novel protein complex, which requires COOH-terminal amino acid residues including DNA binding and dimerization domains for its activity (58Naumann M. Bech-Otschir D. Huang X. Ferrell K. Dubiel W. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 35297-35300Google Scholar, 59Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W. FASEB J... 1998; 12: 469-478Google Scholar). We have previously shown that ionizing radiation-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun is impaired in AT fibroblasts (37Lee S.A. Dritschilo A. Jung M. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 32889-32894Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the effect of ionizing radiation on c-Jun phosphorylation as well as on c-Jun expression in AT cells that had been exposed to CdCl2, a treatment that increases c-Jun phosphorylation in these cells. We also examined further the role of ATM in Cd2+-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun. For these experiments we used cell lines MRC5CV1, AT5BIVA, and AT5BIVA/pMAT1, the latter of which corresponds to AT5BIVA cells transfected with a plasmid (pMAT1) containing the full-length ATM cDNA under the control of a Cd2+-inducible promoter (50Zhang N. Chen P. Khanna K.K. Scott S. Gatei M. Kozlov S. Watters D. Spring K. Yen T. Lavin M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1997; 94: 8021-8026Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 10 μm CdCl2 for 16 h and then exposed to 20 Gy of ionizing radiation. Nuclear proteins were isolated from cells at various times after irradiation, and c-Jun expression (Fig.3 A) and phosphorylation (Fig.3 B) were examined by immunoblot analysis. Pretreatment of cells with CdCl2 for 16 h markedly increased the abundance of c-Jun in all three cell lines, and subsequent exposure to ionizing radiation did not further increase c-Jun expression (Fig. 3 A). Although c-Jun expression was maximally increased after treatment with CdCl2, such treatment induced only a small increase in c-Jun phosphorylation in MRC5CV1 cells (Fig. 3 B). Subsequent exposure of these cells to ionizing radiation further increased c-Jun phosphorylation, although not to the extent greater than that apparent in MRC5CV1 cells not pretreated with CdCl2. In AT5BIVA cells, the marked increase in c-Jun phosphorylation induced by CdCl2treatment was not further increased by subsequent exposure of the cells to ionizing radiation (Fig. 3 B). Other AT fibroblast lines (AT4BIVA and AT3BIVA) exhibited a similar pattern of c-Jun phosphorylation in response to CdCl2 and ionizing radiation (Fig. 3 C). In the absence of CdCl2 pretreatment, ionizing radiation increased both expression (Fig. 3 A) and phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B) of c-Jun in MRC5CV1 cells but not in AT5BIVA cells. In AT5BIVA/pMAT1 cells not treated with CdCl2, ionizing radiation induced a slight increase in c-Jun expression (Fig. 3 A) but had no effect on c-Jun phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B). However, pretreatment of AT5BIVA/pMAT1 cells with CdCl2, which induces ATM expression in these cells, resulted in a substantial induction of c-Jun phosphorylation that was further increased by exposure to ionizing radiation; subsequent irradiation did not further increase c-Jun expression in Cd2+-pretreated AT5BIVA/pMAT1 cells. The increases in c-Jun expression and phosphorylation induced by CdCl2 pretreatment in AT5BIVA/pMAT1 cells were smaller than those apparent in AT5BIVA cells. These data suggest that CdCl2 and ionizing radiation activate two distinct signaling pathways that converge upstream of activation of c-Jun and that ATM contributes to the regulation of c-Jun phosphorylation by both CdCl2 and ionizing radiation. The combined effects of these two pathways are most apparent in the pattern of c-Jun phosphorylation observed in AT5BIVA/pMAT1 cells exposed to both CdCl2 and ionizing radiation. To investigate further the role of ATM in CdCl2-induced c-Jun phosphorylation, MRC5CV1 cells were transfected with plasmid containing antisense ATM cDNA under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter (49Zhang N. Chen P. Gatei M. Scott S. Khanna K.K. Lavin M.F. Oncogene.. 1998; 17: 811-818Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis revealed that the amount of ATM in MRC5CV1/pEAT22 cells was reduced to ∼40% of that in the parental MRC5CV1 cells (data not shown). The extent of c-Jun phosphorylation in MRC5CV1/pEAT22 cells at 4 h after exposure to CdCl2 was similar to that in MRC5CV1 and AT5BIVA cells (Fig. 4). However, at 16 h after exposure to CdCl2, c-Jun phosphorylation in MRC5CV1/pEAT22 cells was markedly greater than that apparent in MRC5CV1 cells but less than that observed in AT5BIVA cells. Induction of c-jun gene expression by Cd2+ is thought to result from the oxidative stress induced by these metal ions (29Shimizu M. Hochadel J.F. Waalkes M.P. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health.. 1997; 51: 609-621Google Scholar). Cadmium ions react readily with thiol groups of proteins and thereby disrupt intracellular sulfhydryl homeostasis (9Vallee B.L. Ulmer D.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 1972; 41: 91-129Google Scholar, 10Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Yakuskin S. Cohen G. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 12703-12709Google Scholar, 11Beyersmann D. Hechtenberg S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol... 1997; 144: 247-261Google Scholar). Ionizing radiation also induces oxidative stress by generating reactive oxygen species that result from the ionization of intracellular water (30Elbirt K.K. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Bonkovsky H.L. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 8922-8931Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the role of oxidative stress in c-Jun phosphorylation induced by ionizing radiation or CdCl2 in normal and AT cells. Pretreatment of cells with 30 mm N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an intracellular precursor of glutathione, markedly reduced the extent of CdCl2-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun in both MRC5CV1 and AT5BIVA cells (Fig.5 A). Whereas NAC alone had no effect on c-Jun phosphorylation in MRC5CV1 cells, it induced c-Jun phosphorylation in AT5BIVA cells, possibly reflecting a difference in intracellular sulfhydryl homeostasis and basal oxidative stress between these two cell types (31Rotman G. Shiloh Y. BioEssays.. 1997; 19: 911-917Google Scholar). Pretreatment of MRC5CV1 cells with NAC also inhibited the increase in c-Jun phosphorylation induced by ionizing radiation (Fig. 5 B). These data suggest that oxidative stress contributes to the increase in c-Jun phosphorylation in response to CdCl2 treatment or ionizing radiation exposure. Exposure of cells to l-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a potent inhibitor of γ-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase, reduces the intracellular level of glutathione (29Shimizu M. Hochadel J.F. Waalkes M.P. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health.. 1997; 51: 609-621Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of BSO on c-Jun phosphorylation in response to CdCl2and ionizing radiation in MRC5CV1, AT5BIVA, and AT5BIVA/pMAT1 cells (Fig. 5 C). Incubation with 5 μm BSO alone for 24 h had little or no effect on c-Jun phosphorylation in these cells. In AT5BIVA cells, however, BSO pretreatment potentiated the increase in c-Jun phosphorylation induced either by CdCl2alone or by CdCl2 and ionizing radiation. In contrast, pretreatment of MRC5CV1 or AT5BIVA/pMAT1 cells with BSO had no effect on c-Jun phosphorylation induced by CdCl2 either alone or combined with ionizing radiation. These data are consistent with the notion that AT cells are more susceptible to disruption of intracellular redox homeostasis and more sensitive to oxidative stress than are cells in which ATM function is intact. Heme oxygenase (HO) oxidatively cleaves heme, a pro-oxidant, into carbon monoxide and biliverdin, which is subsequently converted to bilirubin, an antioxidant. Three HO isozymes encoded by three distinct genes have been identified (60Shibahara S. Yoshizawa M. Suzuki H. Takeda K. Meguro K. Endo K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ).. 1993; 113: 214-218Google Scholar, 61McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Huang T.J. Maines M.D. Eur. J. Biochem... 1997; 247: 725-732Google Scholar). The expression of HO-1 is induced in a wide variety of mammalian tissues by agents that elicit cellular injury, and induction of HO-1 has been implicated as a generalized cellular response to oxidative stress in cultured mammalian cells (62Applegate L.A. Luscher P. Tyrrell R. Cancer Res... 1991; 51: 974-978Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of CdCl2 on HO-1 expression in MRC5CV1, AT5BIVA, and MRC5CV1/pEAT22 cells (Fig.6). None of these cells expressed HO-1 at a detectable level under normal physiological conditions. However, exposure of these cells to CdCl2 resulted in an induction of HO-1 expression in both nucleus and cytosol (Fig. 6, Aand B). Whereas MRC5CV1 cells showed a low level of HO-1 expression that was first apparent at 7 h after exposure to CdCl2 and was sustained for up to 24 h (Fig.6 A), AT5BIVA cells exhibited a marked induction of HO-1 that was first apparent at 4 h and continued to increase for up to 24 h. The extent of HO-1 induction in MRC5CV1/pEAT22 cells, which express ATM antisense RNA, was intermediate between those apparent in MRC5CV1 and AT5BIVA cells (Fig. 6 B), suggesting an inverse relation between the level of CdCl2-induced oxidative stress and the abundance of ATM in these cells. These data thus indicate that ATM plays an important role in modulating intracellular oxidative stress generated by the potent pro-oxidant, CdCl2. Finally, we investigated the role of ATM in modulation of oxidative stress generated by ionizing radiation in MRC5CV1, AT5BIVA, and AT5BIVA/pMAT1 cells (Fig. 6 C). Ionizing radiation induced a low level of HO-1 expression in MRC5CV1 cells but had no effect on this parameter in AT5BIVA or AT5BIVA/pMAT1 cells. Exposure of AT5BIVA/pMAT cells to 10 μm CdCl2 for 16 h resulted in an induction of HO-1 expression that was greater than that apparent in MRC5CV1 cells but smaller than that apparent in AT5BIVA cells.

After extraction from the membranes, the toxin-binding protein was isolated in a homogenous form using wheat germ lectin-Sepharose, Q-Sepharose, and ammodytoxin-CH-Sepharose chromatography. The specific binding of 125I-ammodytoxin C to the isolated acceptor was inhibited to different extents by some neurotoxic phospholipases A2, ammodytoxins, bee venom phospholipase A2, agkistrodotoxin, and crotoxin; but not by nontoxic phospholipases A2, ammodytin I2, porcine pancreatic phospholipase A2, and human type IIA phospholipase A2; suggesting the significance of the acceptor in the mechanism of phospholipase A2neurotoxicity. The isolated acceptor was identified as calmodulin by tandem mass spectrometry. Since calmodulin is generally considered as an intracellular protein, the identity of this acceptor supports the view that secretory phospholipase A2 neurotoxins have to be internalized to exert their toxic effect. Moreover, since ammodytoxin is known to block synaptic transmission, its interaction with calmodulin as an acceptor may constitute a valuable probe for further investigation of the role of the latter in this Ca2+-regulated process."
https://openalex.org/W1984840383,"Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) plays an important role in adhesion phenomena involved in the immune response. The strength of adhesion has been shown to be modulated by changes in ICAM-1 gene expression. In T cells, signaling pathways are intimately regulated by an equilibrium between protein-tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP). The use of bis-peroxovanadium (bpV) compounds, a class of potent PTP inhibitors, enabled us to investigate the involvement of phosphotyrosyl phosphatases in the regulation of ICAM-1 gene expression in human T cells. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that inhibition of PTP results in an increase of ICAM-1 surface expression on both human T lymphoid and primary mononuclear cells. The crucial role played by the NF-κB-, Ets-, and pIγRE-binding sites in bpV[pic]-mediated activation of ICAM-1 was demonstrated using various 5′ deletion and site-specific mutants of the ICAM-1 gene promoter driving the luciferase reporter gene. Co-transfection experiments withtrans-dominant mutants and electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed the importance of constitutive and inducible transcription factors that bind to specific responsive elements in bpV-dependent up-regulation of ICAM-1 surface expression. Altogether, these observations suggest that expression of ICAM-1 in human T cells is regulated by phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activity through NF-κB-, Ets-, and STAT-1-dependent signaling pathways.

Within the immune system, ICAM-1 is expressed on cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage, B lymphocytes, plasma cells, and on both memory and activated T lymphocytes. The association between ICAM-1 and the activated form of the LFA-1 counter-receptor has many important roles in adhesion phenomena involved in the immune system. Its basic function is the induction of a specific and reversible cell-cell adhesion that enables intercellular communication, T cell-mediated defense mechanism, and inflammatory response. In addition, ICAM-1 is also involved in leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction, cell differentiation, and in many pathological complications such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, malignancies of both myeloid and lymphoid origin, and allergic asthma (6Noraz N. Verrier B. Fraisier C. Desgranges C. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1995; 11: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 7van de Stolpe A. van der Saag P.T. J. Mol.

In a normal immune response, the initial contact between T lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells is made possible through an interaction between adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 and LFA-1 expressed on the surface of both T lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells. This interaction leads to the association between the T cell receptor-CD3 complex and antigenic peptides in the context of major histocompatibility complex class I and II molecules. If the latter interaction occurs, T cell receptor-CD3 receptors and major histocompatibility complex molecules transmit activation signals in both cell partners. One of the first reactions following such activation is an increase of adhesion strength stabilizing the association between T cells and antigen presenting cells. Additional links occur between other molecules expressed on both cell surfaces that are required for completing adhesion and cell signaling and consequently determining the following response. It ensues that a dysfunction in ICAM-1 gene expression results in an immunological impairment or a physiopathological situation (7van de Stolpe A. van der Saag P.T. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 13-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar,8Roebuck K.A. Finnegan A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 66: 876-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The regulation of ICAM-1 gene expression occurs primarily at the level of transcription and is cell type-specific. This phenomenon involves different signaling pathways and several enhancer elements such as palindromic interferon-γ-responsive element (pIγRE), NF-κB, Ets, C/EBP, AP-1-like, Sp1, and retinoic acid response elements (7van de Stolpe A. van der Saag P.T.

These numerous enhancer elements contained in theICAM-1 promoter suggest a complex regulation that is still ill-defined in human T cells. In various cell types, signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) factors, and more specifically STAT-1 and STAT-3, can bind the ICAM-1 promoter pIγRE and are strongly involved in ICAM-1 gene expression (10Coccia E.M.

NF-κB has also been reported to play a pivotal role inICAM-1 gene regulation where RelA (p65)/RelA, RelA/c-Rel, and RelA/NF-κB1 (p50) dimers can potently induce ICAM-1 expression in several cell types (20Ledebur H.C.

Both JAK/STAT and NF-κB pathways have been shown to be modulated by phosphorylation events that lead to their translocation into the nucleus. In addition to JAK/STAT and NF-κB, the Ets gene family of transcriptional factors is also involved in the regulation of ICAM-1 expression (26Roebuck K.A. Rahman A. Lakshminarayanan V. Janakidevi K.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2065-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The control of highly diverse sets of genes by Ets proteins involves their own regulation at different levels which include, among others, specific phosphorylation events mediated by the Ras-MAPK pathway in response to extracellular signals (28Wasylyk B. Hagman J. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 213-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In T cells, the expression of many genes is tightly regulated by an equilibrium between two sets of enzymes with distinct properties, the protein-tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP). The role of protein-tyrosine kinases in T cell gene expression has been well documented (29Germain R.N. Stefanova I. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 467-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Recently, some reports have described the role of PTP in T cell signaling and T cell transduction (30Chan A.C. Desai D.M. Weiss A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 31Olivero S. Bléry M. Vivier É. Méd./Sci. 1998; 14: 262-268Google Scholar, 32Streuli M. Curr. Opin.

Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1941) Google Scholar), but the involvement of PTP in the regulation of ICAM-1 gene expression in T cells is unclear. Of interest is the observation that the PTP inhibitor pervanadate can mimic IFN-γ-mediated induction of ICAM-1 expression via nuclear translocation of STAT-1 proteins in human keratinocytes (17Duff J.L. Quinlan K.L. Paxton L.L. Naik S.M. Caughman S.W. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 295-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Moreover, calyculin A and okadaic acid, two phosphoseryl/threonyl phosphatase inhibitors, induce an ICAM-1/LFA-1-dependant homotypic aggregation of both Jurkat and U937 cells (36Weeks B.S. Iuorno J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms leading to this ICAM-1/LFA-1 aggregation have not been defined. Altogether, these reports suggest that both PTP and phosphoseryl/threonyl phosphatases are involved in ICAM-1 expression. The primary objective of the present work was to investigate the role of PTP in the regulation of ICAM-1 gene expression in human T cells. We show here that treatment of primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the human leukemic T cell lines Jurkat, HUT 78, and WE17/10 with the bis-peroxovanadium compound bpV[pic], a strong inhibitor of PTP, results in the induction of ICAM-1 surface expression. Further experiments revealed that NF-κB, Ets, and pIγRE-binding sites are important sequence motifs in bpV[pic]-mediated up-regulation of ICAM-1 expression. These results suggest that ICAM-1 is regulated in human T cells by PTP activity. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin (Iono) were purchased from Sigma and Calbiochem, respectively. Sodium orthovanadate (Sigma) was freshly dissolved before its use in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The bpV[pic] compound was prepared as described previously (37Posner B.I. Faure R. Burgess J.W. Bevan A.P. Lachance D. Zhang-Sun G. Fantus I.G. Ng J.B. Hall D.A. Soo Lum B.S. Shaver A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4596-4604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, V2O5 was dissolved in an aqueous KOH solution and then mixed with 30% H2O2 and an ancillary ligand (picolinic acid anion in this study hence bpV[pic]) in addition to the ethanol for optimal precipitation. Characterization of bpV[pic] was carried out by infrared 1H NMR and vanadium 51 (51V) NMR spectroscopy. Stock solutions of bpV[pic] (1 mm in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) were kept at −85 °C into small aliquots until used. The parental lymphoid T cell line Jurkat (clone E6.1) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.22% NaHCO3, in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere. The human IL-2-dependent T lymphoblastoid cell line WE17/10 (38Willard-Gallo K.E. van de Keere F. Kettmann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6713-6717Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and the human cutaneous T lymphoma cell line HUT 78 (39) were provided by the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda), and were maintained in complete culture medium in the presence of recombinant human IL-2 (50 units/ml) for WE17/10. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation and were cultured in complete culture medium in the presence of phytohemagglutinin (Sigma) (3 μg/ml) and recombinant human IL-2 (30 units/ml) for 3 days at 37 °C. Such cells were left untreated in complete culture medium containing 20% heat-inactivated FBS for 3 days prior to treatment with either bpV[pic] or PMA/Iono. The following reagent was obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program: recombinant human interleukin-2 from Maurice Gately, Hoffmann-La Roche (40Lahm H.W. Stein S. J. Chromatogr. 1985; 326: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cell surface expression of ICAM-1 was evaluated by flow cytometry as follows. Jurkat, HUT 78, WE17/10 cells, and PBMCs (1 × 106) were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% FBS (PBSA). Cells were then resuspended in 100 μl of PBSA to which was added 1 μg of monoclonal anti-ICAM-1 antibody (clone RR1/1.1.1), vortexed gently, and incubated for 30 min on ice. Cells were subsequently washed with PBS containing 2% FBS and resuspended in 100 μl of PBS containing (R)-phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (0.5 μg total) and further incubated for 30 min on ice. Cells were finally centrifuged and resuspended in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS before being analyzed by flow cytometry (EPICS XL, Coulter Corp., Miami, FL). Reporter plasmids of the ICAM-1 5′-regulatory element and mutants used in these experiments are cloned upstream from the firefly luciferase gene. pGL1.3, pGL1.3 κBmut, pGLHindIII, and pGL HindIII IRE mut were provided by Dr. T. P. Parks (Boehringer Ingelheim, Ridgefiel, CN), and pGLE WT, pGLE −138mut, pGLE −158mut, and pGLE −138/−158mut were kindly supplied by Dr. Y. de Launoit (Institut Pasteur, Lille, France). Anti-STAT-1, anti-STAT-3, and anti-p50 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Dr. N. Rice (NCI, Frederick, MD) kindly provided the polyclonal anti-p65 antibodies. Dr. Rothlein (Boehringer Ingelheim, Ridgefield, CN) provided the anti-ICAM-1 antibody RR1/1.1.1 (anti-CD54) (41Rothlein R. Dustin M.L. Marlin S.D. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 1270-1274PubMed Google Scholar). The dominant negative IκBα-expressing vector pCMV-IκBα S32A/36A has been described previously (42Sun S.-C. Elwood J. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1058-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (a kind gift from Dr. W. C. Greene, The Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco). The DNA filler pCMV-EcoRV/SmaI was constructed from the expressing vector pCMV-IκBα S32A/36A by deletion of the cDNA encoding for IκBα S32A/36A with EcoRV/SmaI digestion. Jurkat cells (5 × 106) were first washed once in TS buffer (137 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm KCl, 0.6 mm NaHPO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.7 mmCaCl2) and resuspended in 0.5 ml of TS containing 15 μg of the indicated plasmids and 500 μg/ml DEAE-dextran (final concentration). The cell/TS/plasmid/DEAE-dextran mixture was incubated for 25 min at room temperature. Thereafter, cells were diluted at a concentration of 1 × 106 per ml using complete culture medium supplemented with 100 μm chloroquine (Sigma). After 45 min of incubation at 37 °C, cells were centrifuged, washed once, resuspended in complete culture medium, and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Transiently transfected cells were seeded at a density of 105 cells per well (100 μl) in 96-well flat-bottom plates. In most experiments, cells were left untreated or were either treated with bpV[pic], sodium orthovanadate, or PMA/Iono in a final volume of 200 μl for a period of 8 h for bpV[pic] or 24 h for PMA/Iono and sodium orthovanadate. Cells were then lysed, and luciferase activity was monitored with a microplate luminometer (MLX; Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA). Jurkat cells were either left untreated or were incubated for different times at 37 °C with bpV[pic] (10 μm) or PMA/Iono (20 ng/ml and 1 μm, respectively). Incubation of Jurkat cells with the various stimulating agents was terminated by the addition of ice-cold PBS, and nuclear extracts were prepared according to the microscale preparation protocol (43Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar). In brief, sedimented cells were resuspended in 400 μl of cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After 15 min on ice, 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added. The lysate was vortexed for 10 s, and samples were centrifuged for 30 s at 12,000 × g. The supernatant fraction was discarded, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of cold buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were then rocked vigorously at 4 °C for 15 min. Cellular debris were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fraction was stored at −70 °C until used. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed with 10 μg of nuclear extracts. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic assay with a commercial protein assay reagent (Pierce). Nuclear extracts were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 15 μl of buffer C (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 40% glycerol, 10% Ficoll, 250 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmEDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 10 μg of nuclease-free bovine serum albumin (fraction V) containing 0.8 ng of radiolabeled-labeled double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) oligonucleotide. Double-stranded DNA (100 ng) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase in a kinase buffer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). This mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature, and the reaction was stopped with 5 μl of 0.2 m EDTA. The labeled oligonucleotide was extracted with phenol/chloroform and passed through a G-50 spin column. The dsDNA oligonucleotides, which were used as probes or as competitors, contained either the nonspecific probe Oct-2A (5′-GGAGTATCCAGCTCCGTAGCATGCAAATCCTCTGG-3′), the proximal NF-κB-binding site (5′-GATTGCTTTAGCTTGGAAATTCCGGAGCTG-3′), the distal NF-κB-binding site (5′-AGGGAGCCCGGGGAGGATTCCTGGGCC-3′), the pIγRE (5′-AAGGCGGAGGTTTCCGGGAAAGCAGCACC-3′), the wild-type −138/−158 Ets-binding sites (5′-CTGTCAGTCCGGAAATAACTGCAGCATTTGTTCCGGAGGGGAAG-3′), or the −138/−158-mutated Ets-binding sites (5′-CTGTCAGTCCCCAAATAACTGCAGCATTTGTTGGGGAGGGGAAG-3′) of the ICAM-1 5′-regulatory element. DNA-probe complexes were resolved from free labeled DNA by electrophoresis in native 4% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 200 mm glycine, and 1 mm EDTA. The gels were subsequently dried and autoradiographed. Cold competitor assays were carried out by adding a 100-fold molar excess of homologous unlabeled dsDNA proximal or distal NF-κB, pIγRE, or Ets oligonucleotides simultaneously with the labeled probe. Supershift assays were performed by preincubation of nuclear extracts with 1 μl of specific antibodies in the presence of all the components of the binding reaction described above for 30 min at 4 °C. Given that intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation levels are crucial in the regulation of numerous genes, we investigated the effect of the PTP-specific inhibitor bpV[pic] on ICAM-1 protein expression in the human leukemic T cell line Jurkat and also in primary cells (i.e. PBMCs). In this set of experiments, cells were treated either with the PMA/Iono combination (as a control) or bpV[pic] compound, and the percentage of ICAM-1-expressing cells as well as the mean fluorescence intensity (indicative of the number of molecules per single cell shown on a logarithmic scale) were defined by flow cytometry analyses with the use of an antibody specific for ICAM-1 (clone RR1/1.1.1). As depicted in Fig. 1,A and D, ICAM-1 is constitutively expressed on both Jurkat cells and PBMCs. PMA/Iono treatment resulted in a slight increase ICAM-1 expression on Jurkat cells, whereas a much greater induction of ICAM-1 protein was mediated by these stimuli in primary cells. Interestingly, treatment with the tyrosine phosphatase-specific inhibitor bpV[pic] resulted in a much greater up-regulation of ICAM-1 protein expression on Jurkat leukemic T cells than PMA/Iono. Inhibition of PTP by the specific inhibitor bpV[pic] also leads to a marked induction of ICAM-1 expression in PBMCs. Cell viability was not affected by PMA/Iono and bpV[pic] treatments as monitored by performing in parallel MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) assays (data not shown). These data represent the first demonstration that PTPs are implicated in ICAM-1 gene expression in human T cells. It should be noted that we have made similar observations using HUT 78, another human T cell lymphoma line, and WE17/10, an IL-2-dependent T cell receptor/CD4-expressing cell line established from the blood cells of a patient with T cell lymphoma (Fig. 1, B and C, respectively). This last series of experiments indicate that the noticed bpV[pic]-mediated induction of ICAM-1 gene expression is not an epiphenomenon since it is observed in several human T cell lines. It is well documented that ICAM-1 gene expression is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level. In an attempt to study the effect of bpV[pic] on ICAM-1 transcription, a dose-response experiment was initially carried out using increasing concentrations of this PTP inhibitor. To this end, Jurkat cells were transiently transfected with a reporter construct made of the luciferase gene placed downstream of the entire ICAM-1promoter (i.e. pGL1.3). Next, cells harboring the ICAM-1-luciferase vector were either left untreated or were treated for 8 h with the indicated bpV[pic] concentrations (Fig.2 A). A dose-dependent increase of ICAM-1 promoter activity in Jurkat cells transiently transfected with pGL1.3 was observed when using concentrations of bpV[pic] ranging from 1 to 10 μm (1.2–42.9-fold increase). A slight decrease of ICAM-1-driven luciferase activity was detected at the highest concentration tested (i.e. 20 μm) (34.0-fold increase), which could be due to cell toxicity. Subsequent experiments were thus conducted using bpV[pic] at a maximal concentration of 10 μm. Sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), a commonly used PTP inhibitor, was similarly tested in this series of investigations. As shown in Fig.2 B, a weak increase in ICAM-1-driven luciferase activity was obtained with concentrations of Na3VO4 ranging from 12.5 to 50 μm (1.1–1.5-fold induction). Therefore, these data suggest that bpV[pic] is a much more potent activator ofICAM-1 promoter transcription than the other PTP inhibitor tested, i.e. sodium orthovanadate. Kinetic analyses were also performed to define the appropriate incubation time to reach optimal bpV[pic]- and PMA/Iono-mediated activation of ICAM-1 transcription. As shown in Fig. 2 C, bpV[pic] was found to be markedly more potent than PMA/Iono combination with respect to activation of ICAM-1 transcription. Moreover, maximal activation of ICAM-1-dependent luciferase activity was reached after 8 h following bpV[pic] treatment (22.6-fold increase), whereas the highest induction of ICAM-1 transcription was seen following 24 h of treatment with PMA/Iono (6.7-fold increase). These time points were thus used for the following series of investigations. By having demonstrated that bpV[pic] compound acts as a potent inducer of ICAM-1 transcription in human T cells, we next characterized the cis-regulatory element(s) located within the 5′-flanking sequences of the ICAM-1promoter that confers responsiveness to this tyrosine phosphatase-specific inhibitor. This goal was achieved using a series of ICAM-1 reporter constructs carrying either deletions or point mutations in the 5′ region of the promoter andtrans-dominant negative mutants of some specific transcription factors. Each of these molecular constructs was transiently transfected into Jurkat cells, and the luciferase activities of control, PMA/Iono, and bpV[pic]-treated cells were determined. We initially tested the involvement of the mammalian ubiquitous transcription factor NF-κB in bpV-induced activation ofICAM-1 promoter transcription. NF-κB is a pleiotropic transcription factor complex that mediates the regulated expression of multiple immunomodulatory genes bearing cis-acting κB enhancer elements, including the κ light chain of immunoglobulins, cytokines, as well as known genes for some cell adhesion molecules including ICAM-1 (44Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2003) Google Scholar). NF-κB has been postulated to play a key role in the cell type- and stimulus-specific regulation of ICAM-1 (7van de Stolpe A. van der Saag P.T. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 13-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Considering that the proximal NF-κB-binding site located about 200 bp upstream of the translation initiation site has been demonstrated to be particularly important for the induction of ICAM-1 transcription (45Dhawan S. Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2172-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar,46Müller S. Kammerbauer C. Simons U. Shibagaki N. Li L.-J. Caughman S.W. Degitz K. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 970-975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we used pGL1.3 and a luciferase-encoding vector constituted of the full-length ICAM-1 promoter bearing a point mutation in the most proximal NF-κB-binding site (i.e. pGL1.3 κBmut). Cells were then either left untreated or were treated with bpV[pic] for 8 h and PMA/Iono for 24 h. Again, high levels of ICAM-1 induction were observed with the reporter construct containing the complete ICAM-1 promoter (Fig.3 A). However, mutation of the proximal NF-κB-binding site resulted in a significant decrease in the induction ratio in response to both bpV[pic] (compare 20.3- and 4.4-fold induction) and PMA/Iono treatment (compare 8.9- and 5.1-fol"

In fact, Vn was originally discovered as a “serum spreading factor” (23Holmes R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 32: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The cell adhesion, spreading, and migration activities of Vn are associated with its RGD sequence located near the N terminus of the protein (positions 45–47). This sequence is recognized by the family of receptors known as the integrins: heterodimers composed of α and β subunits (24Ruoslahti E.

There are 17 α and 8 β subunits that heterodimerize to produce 22 different integrins (27Ruoslahti E. Noble N.A. Kagami S. Border W.A. Kidney Int. Suppl. 1994; 44: S17-S22PubMed Google Scholar, 31Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar, 32Kumar C.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1365-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Several of these integrins, e.g. αvβ1, αvβ3, αvβ5, αvβ6, and αvβ8and the platelet-specific αIIbβ3 integrin, are known to recognize and bind Vn. It is well known that cell adhesion is a complex process that was shown to involve an activation of several Vn receptors and a variety of intra-cellular signaling pathways. For example, the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was shown to play a central role in mediating the signal from integrins (33Richardson A. Parsons J.T. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). It does so by its autophosphorylation on Tyr397 upon integrin stimulation. This autophosphorylation leads to the recruitment and activation of intra-cellular mediators such as PI3K, as well as the Src family kinases, by an interaction of their SH2 domain with the autophosphorylated Tyr397residue. The PI3K binding to Tyr397 leads to activation of PKB, whereas the Src family of kinases further phosphorylates FAK on Tyr925 leading to the recruitment of additional signaling molecules that bring about an activation of the ERK pathway (31Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar, 32Kumar C.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1365-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 33Richardson A.

Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Vn can be functionally modulated by extra-cellular phosphorylation, making use of the kinase co-substrate ATP found at micromolar levels in the exterior of cells (39Gordon J.L. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar). For example PKA, released from platelets upon their physiological stimulation with thrombin (40Korc-Grodzicki B.

Biochem. 1993; 127: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), selectively phosphorylates Vn, and, as a consequence of this phosphorylation, it reduces its grip on plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (43Shaltiel S. Schvartz I. Gechtman Z. Kreizman T. Preissner K.T. Rosenblatt S. Kost C. Wegerhoff J. Mosher D.F. Biology of Vitronectins and Their Receptors. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam1993: 311-320Google Scholar). Similarly, PKC phosphorylation of Vn was shown to attenuate its cleavage by plasmin (44Gechtman Z. Shaltiel S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Several laboratories have shown the occurrence of an extra-cellular CK2 activity on a variety of cells. These include epithelial cells (45Kubler D. Pyerin W. Burow E. Kinzel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Res. 1993; 72: 315-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we showed that Vn is a substrate for CK2, which phosphorylates Vn at Thr50 and Thr57. Furthermore, we found that this phosphorylation significantly enhances the adhesion and spreading of bovine aorta endothelial cells (BAEC), presumably because the phosphorylated Vn has a higher affinity for αvβ3 (54Seger D. Gechtman Z. Shaltiel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24805-24813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). One of the major obstacles in revealing the mechanism of action of CK2-phosphorylated Vn originates from the well known fact that Vn (like other adhesion proteins) can bind to several integrins, including the specific Vn-binding integrin, αvβ5, and that this family of integrins can, in turn, activate different intra-cellular pathways. Here we extend our studies on the consequences of the CK2 phosphorylation of Vn and show that the enhanced cell adhesion involves αvβ3 (but not αvβ5). Furthermore, we show that this enhanced adhesion coincides with a preferential activation of the FAK/PI3K/PKB cascade, rather than the ERK signaling pathway. The following materials were purchased from the commercial sources: [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell); restriction enzymes (Roche Molecular Biochemicals or Life Technologies, Inc.);Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). Monoclonal antibodies against the integrin receptor αvβ5 (P1F6), against αvβ3 (LM609), and against the β3 integrin receptor (MAB 1974) were obtained from Chemicon. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the integrin receptor α3 were from Serotec. Monoclonal antibodies against active ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK were from Sigma Chemical Co. Monoclonal antibodies against phospho-tyrosine (PY99) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal antibodies against total ERK, JNK, p38 MAPK, FAK, and goat anti-mouse IgG FITC-conjugated antibodies were purchased from Sigma; anti-active PKB (polyclonal antibodies) were from New England BioLabs. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and glutamine (0.5 mg/ml). H1299 cells were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and glutamine (0.5 mg/ml). The cells were grown in an incubator (37 °C) with an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The Sf-9 and High-5 insect cells were maintained in Grace's insect medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and grown in an incubator (27 °C). For the expression of recombinant Vns, a serum-free medium (Sf-900 II, Life Technologies, Inc.) was used. All media for insect cells were supplemented with 50 μg/ml Gentamicin and 12.5 μg/ml Fungizone (Life Technologies, Inc.). Serial dilutions of r-Vns were added to 24-well plates (250 μl) for 1.5 h at 22 °C to allow coating of the plates. Thereafter the solutions were aspirated, and 0.5 ml of serum free medium containing 1 mg/ml hemoglobin was added for 30 min at 37 °C. Confluent cells plated on 10-cm plates were labeled with 30 μCi of [35S]methionine for 3–4 h at 37 °C. The cells were collected (using 5 mm EDTA) into serum free medium, centrifuged (5 min at 1200 × g), and resuspended into a serum free medium adjusting their concentration to 106 cells/ml. Cell suspensions (250 μl) were added to each coated well for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed three times with 0.5 ml of PBS, and the adhered cells were treated with 0.5 ml of 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Samples of 0.4 ml were transferred into scintillation vials for counting. The quantitation of cell adhesion is reported as the residual radioactivity (a mean of triplicates in cpm) of the cells tested, after their extensive washing (three times with 0.5 ml of PBS). This comparison was convenient and valid, because each assay was carried out with an identical volume of cell suspension, and an identical number of cells. When cell adhesion assays were performed in 48-well plates, all the components and treatments of the assay were scaled down accordingly. The monoclonal antibodies used were: P1F6, directed against the integrin receptor αvβ5; LM609, directed against the integrin receptor αvβ3; and HA, directed against hemagglutinin as control. Plates (24 wells) were coated with 5 μg/ml of the Vn to be assayed (250 μl) for 1.5 h 22 °C, then the nonspecific adsorption sites were blocked with 0.5 ml of serum free medium containing 1 mg/ml hemoglobin (30 min at 37 °C). The cells were treated as described above to yield a concentration of 105 cells/ml. Before starting the cell adhesion assay, the cells were preincubated with increasing concentrations of monoclonal antibodies (gentle shaking, for 30 min at 22 °C). Thereafter, the cells were washed once with 10 ml of serum free medium containing 1 mg/ml hemoglobin and resuspended to yield a concentration of 105 cells/ml. An aliquot of this cell suspension (250 μl) was added to the Vn-coated wells, and the adhesion assay was allowed to proceed as described above. Confluent cells grown on 10-cm plates were collected as described under cell adhesion and brought to a concentration of 5 × 105 cells in 100 μl of PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% sodium azide. The cells were incubated with monoclonal antibodies (final concentration, 4 μg/100 μl) for 1 h on ice with occasional agitation. They were then washed three times with 1 ml of PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% sodium azide using a cooled microcentrifuge (4 °C). After the last wash, the cells were resuspended in 100 μl of the above-mentioned buffer, supplemented with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (final concentration of 5 μg/100 μl). The cells were allowed to bind the antibodies during 1 h (on ice) with occasional agitation, then washed as above and resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS (containing the above constituents) for FACS analysis in a FACScan Becton Dickinson (530 filter). For each antibody, 5000 cells were analyzed. Control cells were incubated with the secondary antibody only. The cDNA encoding the β3 integrin subunit in pGEM was kindly provided by Dr. P. J. Newman, Blood Research Institute, Milwaukee, WI. The cDNA was digested withDraI and XbaI then treated with Klenow and subcloned into an EcoRV-digested pcDNA3 vector. Transfections of H1299 cells were done using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were transfected with the β3 subunit cDNA in pcDNA3 or, for control, with the empty vector of pcDNA3. Transfected cells were grown on 0.6 mg/ml Geneticin (G418), and single stable clones were isolated. Preparation of the r-Vn mutants and their expression in insect cells was carried as described previously (54Seger D. Gechtman Z. Shaltiel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24805-24813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Plates (10 cm) were coated with the r-Vns for 1.5 h at 22 °C. Thereafter the solutions were aspirated and 3 ml of serum free medium containing 1 mg/ml hemoglobin was added and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Serum-starved cells were collected (using 5 mm EDTA) into serum free medium containing 1 mg/ml hemoglobin (106cells/ml). The cells were plated on top of the r-Vns and incubated for various time periods at 37 °C then washed three times with PBS (ice-cold) and scraped (on ice) into 500 μl of a RIPA buffer. The lysates were collected and centrifuged (20,000 × g 15 min at 4 °C), and aliquots of the resulting supernatants were assayed for their protein concentration (Pierce protein assay). Equal amounts of proteins obtained from the cell lysates described above were loaded onto SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose paper, and immunoblotted with antibodies exclusively recognizing the active form of the kinase in question (anti-activated ERK, JNK, p38 MAPK, or PKB antibodies). The same samples were also analyzed using anti-total kinase antibodies, which detect the total amount of the kinase in question (activated and non-activated). Protein samples (600 μg) obtained from the cell lysates described above were immunoprecipitated using anti-FAK antibodies immobilized on agarose beads (mixing end to end for 2 h at 4 °C). The immunoprecipitated samples were washed once with RIPA buffer, twice with 0.5 m LiCl, 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and finally twice in 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, pH 7.3, 1.5 mm EGTA, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 sodium vanadate. After the last wash, the samples were boiled in Laemmli's sample buffer and subjected on SDS-PAGE. The gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blotted either with antibodies against phosphotyrosine (PY99, to detect phosphorylated FAK), or with antibodies against FAK (to determine the total FAK as a reference value) in each lane. We have previously shown (54Seger D. Gechtman Z. Shaltiel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24805-24813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) that the CK2 phosphorylation of Vn results in a significant enhancement of BAEC cell adhesion (∼2.5-fold, average of three experiments), as indicated by the number of cells that adhere to increasing concentrations of immobilized Vn. We also showed that the effect of the CK2 phosphorylation could be reproduced with a mutant Vn(T50E,T57E) (a close analog of CK2-PVn representing the phospho form of Vn), when compared with Vn(T50A,T57A) (a close analog of Vn representing the non-phospho form of Vn). In the course of our studies we found that BAEC cells do not express αvβ5 (a characteristic binding receptor for Vn (55Felding H.B. Cheresh D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 864-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar)); therefore, we considered the possibility that this integrin might be involved in a response to CK2-PVn by cells that do express this integrin. To find out whether this is the case, we used HeLa cells (Fig. 1 A) and H1299 cells (Fig. 1 B), whose adhesion to Vn was found to be mediated mainly by αvβ5. In both cases we found an efficient inhibition of cell adhesion by anti-αvβ5 but a minor inhibition by anti-αvβ3. A similar inhibition of cell adhesion by both antibodies was also obtained with Vn(T50A,T57A) (not shown), raising the possibility that the adhesion of these cells to both forms of Vn is mediated by αvβ5. In line with this finding, the adhesion profile of HeLa as well as H1299 cells to immobilized Vn(T50E,T57E) was found to be essentially identical to their adhesion to Vn(T50A,T57A) (Fig. 1, C andD). In this context it should be noted that (i) the same adsorption profile of the cells was obtained whether Vn(T50E,T57E) or Vn(T50A,T57A) was used as a substratum (54Seger D. Gechtman Z. Shaltiel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24805-24813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and (ii) in all experiments comparing Vn(T50A,T57A) with Vn(T50E,T57E) we ran a similar experiment with wild type r-Vn and showed that, within experimental error, it was identical to Vn(T50A,T57A). The results presented above, together with our previous findings with BAEC (54Seger D. Gechtman Z. Shaltiel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24805-24813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), imply that the enhanced cell adhesion onto CK2-PVn is mediated by the αvβ3 receptor. To confirm this suggestion we endowed H1299 cells (which do not exhibit an enhanced cell adhesion in response to CK2-PVn) with a capability to exhibit an enhanced cell adhesion onto Vn(T50E,T57E) and thus to “discriminate” between the phospho- and non-phospho forms of Vn. This was achieved by transfecting H1299 cells with the β3subunit. 2The rational of transfecting only with one subunit (β3) rather than co-transfecting both αv and β3 was to use the existing αv pool and make it generate more αvβ3 at the expense of other αv partners (β5). Isolated clones of H1299 cells overexpressing αvβ3 that were identified by immunoblotting with anti-β3, and subsequently characterized by FACS analysis with anti-αvβ3 (Fig.2, A and B), were shown to contain high amounts of the αvβ3integrin on their surface. Quantitation of the FACS analysis indicated that the β3-transfected clones we used contained up to ∼7-fold more αvβ3 than the control vector-transfected clones, whereas the amounts of the αvand of a non-relevant α3 integrin were very similar to the control. In addition, we observed a ∼3-fold reduction of αvβ5 in the β3-transfected clone, presumably due to competition between β5 and the excess of β3 for the limited amount of their common partner, the αv subunit. The involvement of αvβ3 (but not αvβ5) in the enhanced cell adhesion is best illustrated in Fig. 3, which shows that the adhesion of vector-transfected H1299 cells is blocked by anti-αvβ5 and not by anti-αvβ3 (Fig. 3 A), whereas the adhesion of β3-transfected H1299 cells is blocked by anti-αvβ3 but not by anti-αvβ5 (B). In line with these findings, the vector-transfected H1299 cells do not discern Vn(T50E,T57E) from Vn(T50A,T57A), whereas cells overexpressing the β3 subunit exhibit an ability to enhance cell adhesion on the Vn(T50E,T57E) mutant (compare Fig. 3 C with Fig.3 D). It should be noted that the occurrence of a relationship between the integrin content of cells, their adhesion, and the ensuing intracellular signaling triggered by Vn were also observed with two additional β3-transfected clones (not shown). Following the identification of αvβ3 as a CK2-PVn-specific mediator of the enhanced adhesion obtained with this phosphorylation, we attempted to identify an intra-cellular signaling pathway that might be responsible for this enhancement. Because the activation of ERKs in response to the stimulation of cells by ECM proteins was already established (31Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar, 32Kumar C.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1365-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 33Richardson A. Parsons J.T.

Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar), we first examined the pattern of ERK activation in the stable αvβ3 and αvβ5expressing clones of the H1299 cells mentioned above. In response to cell adhesion to r-Vns, the ERK activation of αvβ5- and αvβ3-containing clones was found to be low and transient (Fig. 4, A andB): It was found to peak within 10 min after plating and to decline thereafter. No significant change in the pattern of ERK activation that could correlate with the enhancement of cell adhesion was observed (Fig. 4 C). These results raised the possibility that an alternative signaling pathway(s) (other than the ERK pathway), might be involved in the enhanced adhesion observed with the β3-transfected clone. Because we found that the activation of ERK cannot account for the enhanced cell adhesion, we looked into other signaling pathways such as the JNK, p38 MAPK, and PKB pathways that were previously shown to be activated by Vn-binding integrins. Although no adhesion-triggered activation of JNK and p38 MAPK was detected in the various clones we used (data not shown), we found that the activation of PKB in the β3-transfected cells (Fig. 5) led to a significantly enhanced activation of this kinase, in comparison to the very low PKB activation in the vector-transfected cells. 3This small activation is probably due to the residual cell adhesion through the αvβ3integrin in these cells (about 10%, as detected by the inhibition achieved using specific anti-αvβ3 integrin antibodies, Fig. 3 A). These results suggested to us that the activation of PKB depends on the availability of the αvβ3 integrin. As such, the extent of PKB activation in the β3-transfected cells correlates well with the extent of enhanced cell adhesion onto CK2-PVn. This was demonstrated with β3-transfected cells that were plated on Vn(T50E,T57E), whose enhanced adhesion resulted in an increased PKB activation (∼30-fold over the PDL control), whereas the PKB activation obtained in cells plated onto Vn(T50A,T57A) was found to be only 18-fold over the control (Fig. 5 C). PKB was recently implicated as an important downstream target for PI3K (56Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). To determine whether the PKB activation in our system requires the activation of PI3K (which precedes PKB in several signal transduction processes (cf.Scheme FS1), we treated β3-transfected cells with wortmannin (a PI3K inhibitor) prior to their stimulation by adhesion to Vn(T50E,T57E). Indeed, w"
https://openalex.org/W2015258215,"CooA is a heme-containing transcriptional activator that anaerobically binds to DNA at CO atmosphere. To obtain information on the conformational transition of CooA induced by CO binding to the heme, we assigned ring current-shifted 1The abbreviations used are:WTwild-typeH NMR signals of CooA using two mutants whose axial ligands of the heme were replaced. In the absence of CO, the NMR spectral pattern of H77Y CooA, in which the axial histidine (His77) was replaced with tyrosine, was similar to that of wild-type CooA. In contrast, the spectra of CooAΔN5, in which the NH2 termini including the other axial ligand (Pro2) were deleted, were drastically modulated. We assigned three signals of wild-type CooA at −4.5, −3.6, and −2.8 ppm to δ1-, α-, and δ2-protons of Pro2, respectively. The Pro2 signals were undetectable in the upfield region of the spectrum of the CO-bound state, which confirms that CO displaces Pro2. Interestingly, the Pro2 signals were observed for CO-bound H77Y CooA, implying that CO binds to the trans position of Pro2 in H77Y CooA. The abolished CO-dependent transcriptional activity of H77Y CooA is therefore the consequence of Pro2 ligation. These observations are consistent with the view that the movement of the NH2 terminus triggers the conformational transition to the DNA binding form. CooA is a heme-containing transcriptional activator that anaerobically binds to DNA at CO atmosphere. To obtain information on the conformational transition of CooA induced by CO binding to the heme, we assigned ring current-shifted 1The abbreviations used are:WTwild-typeH NMR signals of CooA using two mutants whose axial ligands of the heme were replaced. In the absence of CO, the NMR spectral pattern of H77Y CooA, in which the axial histidine (His77) was replaced with tyrosine, was similar to that of wild-type CooA. In contrast, the spectra of CooAΔN5, in which the NH2 termini including the other axial ligand (Pro2) were deleted, were drastically modulated. We assigned three signals of wild-type CooA at −4.5, −3.6, and −2.8 ppm to δ1-, α-, and δ2-protons of Pro2, respectively. The Pro2 signals were undetectable in the upfield region of the spectrum of the CO-bound state, which confirms that CO displaces Pro2. Interestingly, the Pro2 signals were observed for CO-bound H77Y CooA, implying that CO binds to the trans position of Pro2 in H77Y CooA. The abolished CO-dependent transcriptional activity of H77Y CooA is therefore the consequence of Pro2 ligation. These observations are consistent with the view that the movement of the NH2 terminus triggers the conformational transition to the DNA binding form. wild-type The photosynthetic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum has a heme-based CO sensor, CooA, which activates the expression ofcooMKLXUH and cooFSCTJ operons in response to CO (1Shelver D.

The gene products encoded in these operons constitute a CO oxidizing system that enables the bacterium to utilize CO as the sole energy source under CO atmosphere (4Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W.

CooA belongs to a family of transcriptional activators that includes the cAMP receptor protein and the fumarate-nitrate reductase activator protein (1Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The investigation on CooA is therefore important to understand the general activation mechanism of this family of transcriptional activators (1Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2He Y. Shelver D. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol.

CooA is an ∼50-kDa homodimeric protein, with each monomer possessing a low spin heme in the ferrous state (6Aono S. Nakajima H. Saito K. Ohkubo K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 7Aono S. Matsuo T. Shimono T. Ohkubo K. Takasaki H. Nakajima H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In the absence of CO, CooA possesses the six-coordinated heme with two endogenous ligands and is in the inactivated state that does not bind to DNA (the CO-free state or the low affinity state). The CO-free state denotes hereafter CooA with the ferrous heme in the absence of CO. In the presence of CO, one of the axial ligands of the ferrous heme is displaced with CO, which leads to the capability of CooA to bind to a specific sequence of DNA (the CO-bound state or the high affinity state) (7Aono S. Matsuo T. Shimono T. Ohkubo K. Takasaki H. Nakajima H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, the molecular mechanism of the conformational transition triggered by the CO binding is of essential importance to understand the function of CooA (7Aono S. Matsuo T. Shimono T. Ohkubo K. Takasaki H. Nakajima H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 8Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A significant advance in the understanding of the function of CooA has been presented in the recent x-ray crystal structure (10Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). It is confirmed that the overall fold of the protein is indeed similar to cAMP receptor protein that forms dimeric structure interfaced by long helixes (C-helix). The most prominent structural characteristic of CooA is the ligation of the NH2-terminal Pro2 of one subunit to the heme iron in the other subunit. 1We confirmed that the NH2-terminal methionine (Met1) is removed after the expression of wild-type CooA in the host cell.1We confirmed that the NH2-terminal methionine (Met1) is removed after the expression of wild-type CooA in the host cell. The other axial ligand of the heme is confirmed to be His77 as has been demonstrated in our previous studies (9Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.-Y. Roberts G.P. Reynolds M.F. Park R.B. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 11Aono S. Ohkubo K. Matsuo T. Nakajima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25757-25764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It is further proposed that the straight C-helix in the low affinity state becomes bent in the high affinity state upon the CO binding. However, since the x-ray structure of CooA is presented only for the CO-free state, the molecular mechanism that triggers the proposed conformational transition remains to be elucidated. It was suggested from the resonance Raman spectroscopy that the axial ligand of the CO-bound form is likely to be His77, and the release of the other ligand, identified as Pro2 later, triggers the conformational transition at the DNA binding domain (12Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Nakajima H. Aono S. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12747-12752Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, Roberts and his co-workers (13Vogel K.M. Spiro T.G. Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Roberts G.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2679-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Dhawan I.K. Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Roberts G.P. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12805-12813Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) proposed that CO displaces His77 instead of Pro2 and the changes in the His77 ligation triggers the DNA binding. While our recent investigations using time-resolved resonance Raman and extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopies have unequivocally indicated the ligation of His77 in the CO-bound CooA (12Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Nakajima H. Aono S. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12747-12752Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,15Nakajima H. Honma Y. Tawara T. Kato T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the site-directed mutagenesis of the axial ligands seems inconsistent with the movement of Pro2 for the trigger of the DNA binding activity. For example, the deletion of NH2-terminal residues (CooAΔN5) fully maintained the activity of CooA (15Nakajima H. Honma Y. Tawara T. Kato T. Park S.Y. Miyatake H. Shiro Y. Aono S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mutation of His77(H77Y CooA) abolished the CO-induced transcriptional activity of CooA even though the protein forms CO-bound heme (9Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 25757-25764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Investigation on the detailed coordination structures of the heme in these mutants is necessary to clarify the functional significance of these axial ligands and their functional differences. To characterize the structural changes induced by the CO binding to the heme in CooA and clarify the significance of the release of the NH2-terminal Pro2 ligand, we conducted1H NMR investigation of CooA in the absence and presence of CO. As we reported previously, reduced CooA provides characteristic 1H NMR signals between −1 and −6 ppm that show drastic changes upon the CO binding (11Aono S. Ohkubo K. Matsuo T. Nakajima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25757-25764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These ring-current-shifted signals are originating from residues around heme and therefore should provide us with the detailed information on the conformational transition triggered by the CO binding (11Aono S. Ohkubo K. Matsuo T. Nakajima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25757-25764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, due to the unprecedented coordination structure of the heme in CooA, the assignments of the upfield NMR signals have not been presented. We therefore compared the NMR spectra of CooA in the absence and presence of CO with those of the axial mutants to assign the upfield NMR signals. We confirmed that the proximal ligand of the CO-bound CooA is His77, as we have indicated in the previous studies (12Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Nakajima H. Aono S. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12747-12752Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the changes in the NMR spectra induced by the axial mutations provide us with a simple and consistent picture on the triggering event for the conformational transition of CooA. Procedures for the construction of the expression systems, the expression and purification for the axial mutants, were reported previously (6Aono S. Nakajima H. Saito K. Ohkubo K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 7Aono S. Matsuo T. Shimono T. Ohkubo K. Takasaki H. Nakajima H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A. 1997; 94: 11216-11220Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). NH2-terminal analysis for CooAΔN5 was carried out by using a protein sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, PROCISE 491cLC). Cytochrome f (turnip) was purchased from Sigma. Proton NMR experiments were performed at 25 °C on a 500-MHz spectrometer (Brucker, AVANCE DRX500) equipped with an Indy work station (Silicon Graphics) (17Uchida T. Unno M. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A 1331-pulse sequence was used to minimize resonances inside the 0–10 ppm region (18Hore P.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 54: 539Google Scholar). The proton shifts were referenced to the residual water signal at 4.81 ppm at 25 °C, which is calibrated against external tetramethylsilane. The wild-type and mutant CooA proteins were dissolved in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffers at pH 7.4 containing 10% D2O or at pD 7.4 containing 100% D2O. Protein concentrations were over 300 μm on the heme basis. CooA was converted to the reduced form by an anaerobic addition of sodium dithionite solution to a final concentration of about 2 mm. CO-bound CooA was prepared by flowing CO over the reduced protein for 10 min with mild stirring. Resonance Raman spectra were measured using the system and the method reported previously (16Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Nakajima H. Aono S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19988-19992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows the1H NMR spectrum for the CO-free state of CooA in H2O, in which several characteristic and well resolved resonances are observed in the upfield region (−6 to −1 ppm) (11Aono S. Ohkubo K. Matsuo T. Nakajima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25757-25764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These ring-current-shifted signals can be assigned to protons of the amino acid residues nearby the porphyrin ring. As shown in Fig.1D, three of the signals (b, d, ande) at −2.8, −3.6, and −4.5 ppm are nonexchangeable. Based on the intensity of an isolated resonance at 10.3 ppm from the NH of a single tryptophan at position 110 (spectrum not shown), the intensity of each signal (b, d, and e) corresponds to a single proton. Each of the exchangeable signals at −6.1 (a) and −4.0 (c) ppm is also estimated to possess a single proton intensity. While upfield shifted NMR signals have been observed for several heme proteins, the spectral pattern of CooA is unique and indicates the distinct coordination structure. For example, the ferrous state of cytochrome c550 M100K mutant (19Ubbink M. Campos A.P. Teixeira M. Hunt N.I. Hill H.A. Canters G.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10051-10059Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) indicates signals between −1 and −4 ppm that are assigned to protons of an axial ligand, Lys100. However, the upfield shifted signals of CooA were observed in the region below −4 ppm (−4.0, −4.5, and −6.1 ppm). In contrast, the ferrous cytochromef, 2The reported NMR spectrum for ferrous cytochromef only showed the region up to −5 ppm (20Rigby E.J. Moore G.R. Gray J.C. Gadsby P.M.A. George S.J. Thomson A.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We re-examined the NMR spectrum of ferrous cytochrome f and found two additional signals at −6.8 and −8.2 ppm. in which the NH2-terminal amino group of Tyr1 is coordinated to heme (21Davis D.J.

Structure ( Lond. ). 1994; 2: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) suggests that these signals can be assigned to CαH of Tyr1, Cγ1H of Tyr1, CγH of Pro2, or Cγ1H of Phe4, all of which are located within 5 Å from the heme iron. While the signal pattern of cytochrome f is different from that of CooA, the spectrum exemplifies that the coordination of NH2-terminal amino group can shift signals below −4 ppm. The coordination structure of CooA can consistently explain its NMR spectrum. Because Pro2 and His77 are the axial ligands of the CO-free heme (10Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 15Nakajima H. Honma Y. Tawara T. Kato T. Park S.Y. Miyatake H. Shiro Y. Aono S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the signals b,d, and e are likely derived from the nonexchangeable protons of the proline ring of Pro2 and/or imidazole ring of His77. The nonexchangeable protons of histidines bound to low spin ferrous hemes, however, are usually observed at around 1∼2 ppm (24Guiles R.D. Basus V.J. Kuntz I.D. Waskell L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11365-11375Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, given that the signalsb, d, and e originate from the protons in the axial ligands, they are likely due to the protons from Pro2. The x-ray structure of the CO-free CooA shows that the distances from the heme iron to protons attached to Cα and Cδ of Pro2 are less than 4 Å (7Aono S. Matsuo T. Shimono T. Ohkubo K. Takasaki H. Nakajima H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and suggests that signals b, d, ande are derived from one methyne proton at Cαand two methylene protons at the Cδ position of Pro2. Furthermore, we detected a significant cross-peak between the signals b and e in preliminary two-dimensional COSY measurements (spectra not shown). We therefore assigned signals b, d, and e to Cδ1H, 4The δ-carbon of proline residue has two protons. We differentiated one of the protons located near the heme iron as Cδ1H and other proton as Cδ2H.CαH, and Cδ2H of Pro2, respectively. The above assignments are supported by the NMR spectra of the axial ligand mutants, H77Y CooA and CooAΔN5. We constructed the CooAΔN5 mutant, in which four residues, Pro2-Pro-Arg-Phe5, are deleted from the amino terminus. 5The NH2-terminal analysis for the CooAΔN5 mutant showed that methionine is still attached at the NH2 terminus. Thus, the NH2-terminal residue of CooAΔN5 is Met5. While the optical absorption (15Nakajima H. Honma Y. Tawara T. Kato T. Park S.Y. Miyatake H. Shiro Y. Aono S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and resonance Raman spectra (spectra not shown) of CooAΔN5 in the CO-free state are very similar to those of WT6 CooA, the CooAΔN5 mutant shows distinct NMR spectra from those of wild-type CooA as shown in Fig. 1, C and F. Nonexchangeable proton signals, signals b and d, are completely missing in the mutant, confirming that these signals are derived from Pro2. In contrast to CooAΔN5, the spectral changes induced by the substitution of His77 for Tyr (H77Y CooA) are less drastic, as shown in Fig. 1, B and E. The spectra of H77Y CooA 7The optical absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopies reveal that the CO-free state of H77Y CooA contains both of the six- and five-coordinated hemes, with the six-coordinated heme as the minor component (11Aono S. Ohkubo K. Matsuo T. Nakajima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25757-25764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 13Vogel K.M. Spiro T.G. Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12805-12813Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although broad paramagnetic NMR signals were observed in the downfield region (data not shown), no paramagnetic signals from the five-coordinated heme were detected in the upfield region. The binding of CO to the five-coordinated heme in the CO-free state seems to form the six-coordinated heme, giving the signals shown in Fig. 2, B and E. Therefore, all signals in Figs. 1 and 2 are from the six-coordinated and low spin species of H77Y CooA. are almost identical to those of wild-type CooA, although an exchangeable proton signal at −4.0 ppm (c) disappears and the spectral pattern between −0.5 and −2.0 ppm is perturbed. The minor spectral changes support the assignment that the signals b, d, ande originate from the Pro2 side. While the assignments for the nonexchangeable signals are convincing, those of the exchangeable protons are still ambiguous. Since signala is the most upfield shifted and is insensitive to the substitution of His77, the signal should be a proton located near the heme iron at the Pro2 side. A most plausible candidate is the NH proton of Pro2. However, the imino group of Pro2 might be deprotonated when it coordinates to the heme iron. In addition, the chemical shift and intensity of a were pH-independent between pH 6 and 11, although generally the pKa of the NH proton of Pro is ∼10. The assignment of the signal c is also unclear. This signal disappears by the mutation at His77 and likely belongs to a residue located in the His77 side. Although NδH of His77 might be a candidate for the signal c, this is unlikely since the axial His NH proton of cytochrome b5 possesses a signal at 1∼2 ppm (24Guiles R.D. Basus V.J. Kuntz I.D. Waskell L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11365-11375Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Another candidate for the signal c would be the sulfhydryl proton of Cys75, which is one of the axial ligands for the ferric heme and displaces from the ferrous heme (7Aono S. Matsuo T. Shimono T. Ohkubo K. Takasaki H. Nakajima H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 9Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.-Y. Roberts G.P.

Soc. 1998; 120: 9080-9081Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The distance between the SH proton and the heme iron is less than 4 Å in the CO-free CooA (10Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the prominent upfield shift. The NMR signals for most of sulfhydryl protons in proteins, however, are not observed due to the rapid exchange with solvent water (26Bundi A. Wütrich K. Biopolymers. 1979; 18: 285-298Crossref Scopus (830) Google Scholar). If the signal c is due to the SH proton from Cys75, its exchange rate should be retarded, probably by a poor accessibility of solvent waters. To obtain an insight into the activation mechanism of CooA, we measured the NMR spectra of CO-bound wild-type and mutant CooA and compared them with those in the absence of CO. As shown in Fig.2A, the CO-bound form of wild-type CooA shows no NMR signals from the nonexchangeable protons of Pro2 in the region between −2 and −6 ppm. The exchangeable signal observed at −4.5 ppm is not affected by the deletion of the NH2 terminus (Fig.3, C and F). Therefore, the proton giving the signal at −4.5 ppm should be located in the His77 side and likely corresponds to the SH proton of Cys75 that indicates signal c at −4.0 ppm in the CO-free CooA (Fig. 1, B and E). The small shift of the peak upon the CO binding might indicate that the conformational transition of the His77 side is rather small. The assignment of Pro2 signals for the CO-free CooA and no proton signals from the Cα and Cδ positions of Pro2 in the upfield region of the spectrum of the CO-bound form give us clear evidence that Pro2 displaces from the heme iron in the CO-bound form of CooA. These results further support our previous conclusion from the time-resolved resonance Raman and extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopies (12Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Ishimori K.

Shiro Y. Aono S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Based on the decrease of the ring-current shift for the proton signals from Pro2 upon CO binding, the ligand should be displaced from the original location by at least 4 Å in the CO-bound form (10Lanzilotta W.N.

The large displacement of Pro2 induced by the CO binding suggests the importance of the Pro2 side as the first event of the conformational transition of CooA. While the results presented above indicate the movement of Pro2as the trigger for the activation of CooA, the activities of CooAΔN5 and H77Y CooA might be interpreted inversely as suggesting the importance of the His77 side. CooAΔN5 fully maintains the activity of CooA, while H77Y CooA completely abolishes the CO-induced transcriptional activator activity (9Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.-Y.

Examinations of1H NMR spectra of these mutants in the CO-bound state, however, give us a clear explanation on their activities based on the movements of the Pro2 side. We will first examine the CooAΔN5 mutant that maintains almost the same transcriptional activity as wild-type CooA (15Nakajima H. Honma Y. Tawara T. Kato T. Park S.Y. Miyatake H. Shiro Y. Aono S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Because the1H NMR spectra for the CO-free state of CooAΔN5 do not indicate the hyper-fine shifted signals that are characteristic of the five-coordinated ferrous hemes (spectra not shown), the ferrous heme of CooAΔN5 is in a low spin state with two axial ligands. We suggest that the two ligands are His77 and NH2-terminal amine, since no other ligands are available around the heme in the x-ray structure of wild-type CooA (10Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The ligation of the truncated amino terminus is consistent with the 1H NMR spectrum of CooAΔN5 (Fig. 1, C and F) that indicates nonexchangeable signals at −2.8, −1.4, and −0.8 ppm assignable to protons of CαH and β-methylene of the N-terminal Met5. Furthermore, the heme marker lines of the resonance Raman spectrum appear at frequencies suggesting the coordination of neutral nitrogen (spectrum not shown), since the frequencies of ν2, ν3, and ν4for the CO-free state of CooAΔN5 are 1579, 1491, and 1361 cm−1, respectively, which are similar to those of cytochrome b5 at 1583, 1493, and 1361 cm−1, respectively (27Kitagawa T. Kyogoku Y. Iizuka T. Ikeda-Saito M. Yamanaka T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1975; 78: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the truncated NH2-terminal region is flexible enough to coordinate to the heme iron. As depicted in Fig. 2, C and F, the CO-bound form of CooAΔN5 showed almost the same NMR spectra in the upfield region as those of wild-type CooA. Furthermore, the resonance Raman spectrum for the CO-bound CooAΔN5 mutant can be superimposed on that of the wild-type CooA, including the heme marker lines and the Fe-C stretching line (spectrum not shown). The frequencies of ν2, ν3, ν4, and ν(Fe-C) in the spectrum of CO-bound CooAΔN5 are 1580, 1498, 1370 and 487 cm−1, respectively. Those of CO-bound wild-type CooA are 1579, 1497, 1369, and 487 cm−1, respectively. These results indicate that the CO-bound form of CooAΔN5 retains the His77-Fe-CO coordination structure and explain the activity of the mutant that is similar to that of wild-type CooA (15Nakajima H. Honma Y. Tawara T. Kato T. Park S.Y. Miyatake H. Shiro Y. Aono S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We will next consider the H77Y mutant. Noticeably, both of the CO-free and CO-bound forms of H77Y CooA provide the characteristic three signals that are similar to those of wild-type CooA in the CO-free form (Figs. 2B and 1A). For example, the CO-bound state of H77Y CooA exhibits the triad of the nonexchangeable resonances at −2.6, −3.5, and −4.3 ppm corresponding to the signals for the CO-free state of wild-type CooA at −2.8, −3.6, and −4.5 ppm, respectively (Fig. 1A). The appearance of the Pro2 signals implies that CO binds to the trans position to Pro2 in H77Y CooA, resulting in the formation of the CO-Fe-Pro2 complex as depicted in Fig. 3D. Since H77Y CooA is not activated by CO (9Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.-Y. Roberts G.P. Reynolds M.F. Park R.B. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 11Aono S. Ohkubo K. Matsuo T. Nakajima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25757-25764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we conclude that the binding position of CO to the heme iron is crucial for the CooA function. We summarized the coordination structures of wild-type H77Y CooA and CooAΔN5 in the CO-free and CO-bound states in Fig. 3. The binding of CO to the Pro2 side (Fig. 3, B and F) can be a trigger to induce the conformational change to the high affinity form, whereas the binding of CO to the His77 side and the maintenance of the Pro2 ligation (Fig.3D) cannot induce the conformational change for the activation. These results provide us with a simple and consistent picture on the activation mechanism of CooA; the movement of the NH2-terminal loop upon the CO binding for more than 4 Å triggers the conformational transition of the whole protein to the high affinity form. As suggested in the x-ray results (10Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), the movement of the NH2-terminal loop might modulate the C-helix, which forms the dimer interface and locates near the heme, to assume the bent conformation.

However, the specific mechanisms of intracellular signal transduction of this process are largely unknown. To understand p75NTR-mediated signal transduction, we previously identified a protein that interacts with the intracellular domain of p75NTR, and we named it p75NTR-associated cell deathexecutor (NADE). To elucidate further the signaling mechanisms utilized by p75NTR and NADE, we screened for NADE-binding protein(s) with the yeast two-hybrid method, and we identified 14-3-3ε as a NADE-binding protein in vivo. To examine whether 14-3-3ε affects the induction of p75NTR-mediated apoptosis, wild type or various deletion mutant forms of 14-3-3ε were co-expressed in HEK293, PC12nnr5, and oligodendrocytes. Interestingly, transient expression of the mutant form of 14-3-3ε lacking the 208–255 amino acid region blocked nerve growth factor-dependent p75NTR/NADE-mediated apoptosis, although this mutant form of 14-3-3ε continued to associate with NADE. These results suggest that 14-3-3ε plays an important role in the modulation of nerve growth factor-dependent p75NTR/NADE-mediated apoptosis.

Abnormal cell growth, differentiation, or apoptosis results in teratogenesis or degeneration of the neural system. To understand neural system development and plasticity, many researchers have tried to identify the molecule(s) that regulate those cellular responses (1Connor B. Dragunow M. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 27: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Nerve growth factor (NGF)1 was first identified as a growth factor required for survival of specific neuronal cells during normal development (2Levi-Montalcini R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1145-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). However, some reports have indicated that NGF has diverse effects on the nervous system, including differentiation and apoptosis (2Levi-Montalcini R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1145-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 3Rabizadeh S. Bredesen D.E. Dev. Neurosci. 1994; 16: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To reveal the mechanisms by which NGF induces various cellular responses, such as cell growth, differentiation, or apoptosis, many researchers have studied the mechanisms of NGF signal transduction (4Friedman W.J. Greene L.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). NGF recognizes at least two cell surface receptors, the high affinity tyrosine kinase receptor (TrkA) and the low affinity non-tyrosine kinase type receptor p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) (5Klein R. Jing S.Q. Nanduri V. O'Rourke E. Barbacid M. Cell. 1991; 65: 189-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar, 6Chao M.V. Bothwell M.A. Ross A.H. Koprowski H. Lanahanm A.A. Buck C.R.

Cell. 1986; 47: 545-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). The TrkA contains a tyrosine kinase motif within its intracellular region. Binding of NGF to TrkA activates the kinase and subsequently induces phosphorylation of multiple substrates that lead to the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (8Peng X. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Stephens R.M. Neuron. 1995; 15: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 9Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). The TrkA receptor initiates cell survival and differentiation signals in neuronal cells (10Kaplan D.R. Stephens R.M. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1404-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 11Lachyankar M.B. Condon P.J. Quesenberry P.J. Litofsky N.S. Recht L.D. Ross A.H. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 144: 350-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In contrast, the role of p75NTR was mostly discussed as that of an accessory receptor modulating the survival signals through the TrkA receptor (12Barbacid M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2033-2042PubMed Google Scholar, 13Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 18: 321-326Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (778) Google Scholar). However, recent evidence suggests that NGF/p75NTR signaling actually induce apoptosis in some types of neuronal cells. In embryonic chick retinal cells that express p75NTR but not TrkA, NGF causes the death of retinal neurons (14Frade J.M. Rodriguez-Tebar A. Barde Y.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NGF treatment induces apoptosis in terminally differentiated primary oligodendrocytes expressing p75NTR but not TrkA (15Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Chao M.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that p75NTR is involved in NGF-induced cell death. There have been reports of NGF/p75NTR-mediated cellular responses including nuclear factor κB activation in Schwann cells and stress-activated protein kinase or c-Jun amino-terminal kinase activation in oligodendrocytes (16Carter B.D. Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Offenhauser N. Bohm-Matthaei R. Baeuerle P.A. Barde Y.A. Science. 1996; 272: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 17Ladiwala U. Lachance C. Simoneau S.J.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3273-3281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The only known consensus motif within the intracellular domain of p75NTR is a death domain, similar to that found in the p55 tumor necrosis factor receptor and in Fas. However, the precise mechanisms of apoptosis induced by p75NTR have remained elusive (19Liepinsh E. Ilag L.L. Otting G. Ibanez C.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4999-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). To identify regulatory proteins that control p75NTR-mediated signaling pathway, several groups have performed molecular cloning of p75NTR-binding proteins, such as zinc finger proteins (SC-1 and NRIF), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors, protein tyrosine phosphatase (Fas-associated phosphatase-1), and GTP-binding protein (RhoA) (20Chittka A.

Neuron. 1999; 24: 585-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of p75NTR-mediated signal transduction are still not fully understood. Recently, we identified a p75NTR-binding protein named p75NTR-associated cell death executor (NADE) (26Mukai J. Hachiya T. Shoji-Hoshino S. Kimura M.T. Nadano D. Suvanto P. Hanaoka T. Li Y. Irie S. Greene L.A. Sato T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17566-17570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Another group (27Brown A.L. Kay G.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) reported this gene as brain expressed X-linked gene 3 (BEX3) but its function remained unclear. As we reported previously, NADE consists of 124 amino acids and does not contain any known biochemical motifs other than the nuclear export signal (NES) sequence. NADE binds to the intracellular domain of p75NTR in an NGF-dependent manner. HEK293 cells co-expressing both NADE and p75NTR showed NGF-dependent apoptotic cell death, whereas cells expressing NADE alone did not. It should be noted that HEK293 cells do not express the TrkA receptor. In cells that underwent apoptosis, the apoptosis executor protease, caspase-3, was activated (26Mukai J. Hachiya T. Shoji-Hoshino S. Kimura M.T. Nadano D. Suvanto P. Hanaoka T. Li Y. Irie S. Greene L.A. Sato T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17566-17570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we also observed pheochromocytoma PC12nnr5, which expresses p75NTR but not TrkA, undergo NGF-dependent apoptosis when NADE was transiently expressed (26Mukai J. Hachiya T. Shoji-Hoshino S. Kimura M.T. Nadano D. Suvanto P. Hanaoka T. Li Y. Irie S. Greene L.A. Sato T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17566-17570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These results suggest that NADE is an essential protein for p75NTR-mediated apoptosis; however, the molecular mechanisms by which NADE regulates apoptosis are not fully clarified. To understand better the function of NADE, we performed extensive yeast two-hybrid screenings to identify NADE-associated protein(s). We identified 14-3-3ε as a candidate molecule that binds to NADE. 14-3-3 proteins were originally isolated as highly abundant acidic proteins in brain extracts (28Baldin V. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 2000; 4: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 proteins associate with a number of signaling molecules and are thought to play important roles in signal transduction pathways involved in cell cycle regulation and the induction of apoptotic cell death. Here, we show that 14-3-3ε binds to NADE and that protein complexes consisting of p75NTR, NADE, and 14-3-3ε are formed in mammalian cells. Furthermore, the mutant form of 14-3-3ε encoding 1–207 amino acids was found to suppress both caspase-3 activation and NGF-dependent-p75NTR/NADE-mediated apoptosis in HEK293, PC12nnr5, and oligodendrocytes. Taken together, these data suggest that 14-3-3ε is involved in the regulation of caspase-3 activity and in p75NTR/NADE-mediated apoptosis. Analysis of protein-protein interactions by yeast two-hybrid system was performed essentially as described by Vojtek et al. (29Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding full-length NADE was subcloned into pBTM116 (pBTM116-NADE), and the sequence was confirmed using an Applied Biosystems model 310 automated DNA sequencer. pBTM116-NADE was then transformed into the L40 yeast strain, and the yeast cells were propagated with appropriate selection. The expression of the fusion protein (LexA-NADE) was determined in protein extract by Western blotting with both an anti-LexA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and an anti-NADE antibody (26Mukai J. Hachiya T. Shoji-Hoshino S. Kimura M.T. Nadano D. Suvanto P. Hanaoka T. Li Y. Irie S. Greene L.A. Sato T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17566-17570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The L40 yeast cells containing pBTM116-NADE were transformed with a murine day 9.5 embryonic cDNA library in pVP16 (kindly provided by Dr. Stanley M. Hollenberg). Histidine prototrophy was determined on plates containing 5 mm 3-aminotriazole to screen for proteins that bind to NADE. β-Galactosidase activity was utilized as a secondary screen. Clones that were positive in both interaction tests were sequenced, and their nucleotide sequences were subjected to a BLAST search. HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Cell Culture Technologies) and cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2. 1.0 × 106 HEK293 cells in 100-mm tissue culture dishes were transfected with 20 μg of total plasmid DNA using the calcium phosphate method as described previously (30Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). PC12nnr5 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Cell Culture Technologies) and with 10% horse serum (JRH Biosciences) and were cultured at 37 °C in 10% CO2. 2.5 × 105 PC12nnr5 cells in 35-mm collagen-coated tissue culture dishes were transfected with 2 μg of total plasmid DNA using Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen). Primary cortical cultures of oligodendrocytes were obtained from post-natal (P1–2) Wister rat and were kept in M15 media (DMEM containing 15% fetal bovine serum, 6 mg/ml glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin) for 7 days. After shaking, precursor cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated dishes with M15 medium at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 15 days. Then the cells were cultured in differentiation medium (DMEM supplemented with 6 mg/ml glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 25 mg/ml insulin, 30 ng/ml sodium selenite, 100 mg/ml transferrin, 20 nm progesterone, 60 mm putrescine, 50 mm thyroxine, and 20 mg/ml triiodothyronine) for 7 days. Those differentiated oligodendrocytes in 6-well plates were transiently transfected with 2 μg of total plasmid DNA using Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen). HEK293 transfectants were cultured in growth medium for 24 h before any further treatments. 7 S NGF (Sigma) was then added at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. During NGF treatment, transfected cells were grown in serum-free DMEM for 24 h. PC12nnr5 transfectants were cultured in growth medium for 24 h before any further treatments. 7 S NGF (Sigma) was then added at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. During NGF treatment, transfected cells were grown in serum-free RPMI 1640 for 24 h. Oligodendrocytes transfected with each plasmid were cultured for 24 h and were treated with 7 S NGF (Sigma) at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml for 12 h. Murine 14-3-3ε cDNAs encoding the full-length, amino acid residues 1–207, 1–120, or 121–207 were subcloned into pCMV Tag2 (Stratagene). These FLAG epitope (MDYKDDDK amino acid sequence)-tagged constructs were then transfected into HEK293 or into PC12nnr5 for the binding assays and apoptosis assays and transfected into primary oligodendrocytes for apoptosis assays. cDNAs encoding either full-length amino acid residues 1–112, 1–80, 1–70 or 81–124 of murine NADE were subcloned into pcDNA3.1(−)myc-His vector (Invitrogen). The Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL amino acid sequence)-tagged constructs were transfected into HEK293 cells for binding assays. For apoptosis assays, murine full-length NADE cDNA subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was transfected into HEK293 and PC12nnr5 cells. Human p75NTR subcloned into pcDNA3 (a gift from Dr. Moses V. Chao) was used for apoptosis assays. The coding regions of these constructs were fully sequenced and verified to be correct. To generate GST fusion proteins, the murine 14-3-3ε and NADE cDNAs were subcloned into pGEX5X-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). These GST fusion proteins, GST/14-3-3ε and GST/NADE, were then expressed in DH5α bacteria and purified onto glutathione-Sepharose beads using standard techniques (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J.S. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar). The beads containing immobilized fusion proteins were blocked with PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C for 2 h and were washed with NETN buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin). The beads were then incubated with cell lysates extracted from HEK293 transfectant expressing wild type 14-3-3ε, (1)-14-3-3ε, (1)-14-3-3ε, or (121)-14-3-3ε. GST/14-3-3ε beads were incubated with the cell lysates extracted from HEK293 transfectants expressing wild type NADE, (1)-NADE, (1–80)-NADE, (1–70)-NADE, or (81)-NADE. Lysates were prepared as described previously in NETN buffer (26Mukai J. Hachiya T. Shoji-Hoshino S. Kimura M.T. Nadano D. Suvanto P. Hanaoka T. Li Y. Irie S. Greene L.A. Sato T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17566-17570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The incubations were carried out at 4 °C for 12–16 h, and the beads were washed three times with NETN buffer. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min and were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on gels containing 12.5% polyacrylamide. The proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and Western blotting analysis was performed. Samples were diluted in Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were incubated with 10% skim milk (Difco) at 25 °C for 1 h, were washed with PBS for 30 min, and then incubated with primary antibody. The primary antibodies used included anti-Myc 9E10 (Biomol) at 1:1000 in PBS, anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) at 1:1000 in PBS, anti-14-3-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:2000 in PBS, anti-p75NTR (Promega) at 1:10000 in PBS, and anti-NADE at 0.5 μg/ml in PBS. Immunoreactive bands were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Bio-Rad) and visualized by using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) procedure (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in NETN buffer on ice for 20 min. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, normalized for protein content, and subjected to immunoprecipitation. Lysates were incubated with anti-Myc (Biomol), anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-14-3-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-NADE antibodies (number 5), which were coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), at 4 °C for 8 h. Anti-NADE polyclonal antibody (number 5) was raised against synthetic peptide including 112–124 amino acid residues (CHHDHHDEFCLMP) of murine NADE. As a negative control, pre-immune mouse or rabbit IgG coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B was used. Immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation, washed with NETN buffer, and subjected to Western blotting, as described above. At selected time points after NGF treatments, HEK293 cells were harvested and washed in PBS. Trypan blue (Sigma) was added to suspended cells at a concentration of 0.4% w/v. After 10 min, cells were transferred to a hemocytometer, and the number of dead (blue-stained) cells was determined using a light microscope. HEK293 or PC12nnr5 transfectants, which were treated with or without NGF, were harvested and used for TUNEL assay by MEBSTAIN Apoptosis Kit Direct (Medical and Biological Laboratories), according to the manufacturer's recommended conditions (32McGahon A.J. Martin S.J. Bissonnette R.P. Mahboubi A. Shi Y. Mogil R.J. Nishioka W.K. Green D.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 153-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). After TUNEL assay, samples were analyzed on a FACScan system using the CELLQuest software (Becton Dickinson). For detection of apoptotic oligodendrocytes, NGF-treated oligodendrocyte transfectants were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.1% sodium citrate containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min on ice, and stained with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2) (Sigma). After incubation with anti-FLAG antibody, samples were processed for TUNEL assay. Then, cells were incubated with Cy-5-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Stained cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy. The numbers of TUNEL-positive or Cy-5-positive cells were counted. The activity of caspase-3 in the transfected cells were assessed with a CPP32/caspase-3 Fluorometric Protease Assay Kit (Medical and Biological Laboratories). Caspase-3 recognizes and cleaves the consensus peptide sequence DEVD. CPP32/caspase-3 Fluorometric Protease Assay is based on detection of cleaved substrate DEVD-AFC. DEVD-AFC emits a blue light (λmax = 400 nm) and, upon cleavage of the substrate by caspase-3, free AFC emits a yellowish green fluorescence (λmax = 494 nm). The fluorometer (Hitachi) was used to measure fluorescence values as a means to quantify caspase-3 activity. A yeast expression library derived from 9.5-day embryonic cDNA (cDNAs were subcloned into pVP16) was screened for proteins that associate with NADE. The full-length NADE was subcloned into pBTM116 in frame with the DNA binding domain of LexA as a target. Expression of the NADE-LexA fusion protein in yeast L40 was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-LexA and anti-NADE antibody (data not shown). Histidine prototrophy and β-galactosidase activity tests were used to select candidate proteins associated with NADE. An estimated 8.0 × 106 colonies were screened. One hundred positive clones were selected for sequencing, and the nucleotide sequences of these positive clones were then subjected to a BLAST search. Among these clones, six clones were found to encode a partial sequence of protein termed 14-3-3ε. These six positive clones contained the overlapping region encoding from Thr-91 to Leu-209 of 14-3-3ε. This overlapping region contains a motif recognized by other 14-3-3-binding proteins (Fig. 1). To confirm the interaction of NADE with 14-3-3ε in vitro, GST pull-down assays were performed. Lysates from HEK293 cells expressing Myc-tagged NADE was incubated with GST/14-3-3ε or GST proteins conjugated with glutathione beads, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The beads were then washed and subjected to Western blotting with an anti-Myc antibody. The lysates from HEK293 cells expressing Myc-tagged wild type NADE exhibited two immunoreactive bands, 22 and 44 kDa, on anti-Myc Western blotting (Fig.2 A). Both 22- and 44-kDa products bound to GST/14-3-3ε but not to GST alone (Fig.2 A). The wild type 14-3-3ε with a FLAG epitope tag was also transfected into HEK293 cells, and the resulting cell lysates were incubated with GST/NADE fusion proteins conjugated with glutathione beads. In these experiments, 14-3-3ε bound to GST/NADE fusion proteins but not to GST alone (Fig. 2 B). These results further indicate that NADE interacts with 14-3-3ε in vitro. A previous study showed that 14-3-3ε binds to phosphorylated serine residues within the consensus amino acid sequence RSXpSXP (where X is any amino acid and pS is phosphorylated serine residue). NADE does not contain this motif, although the motif has been shown to be present in many proteins bound to 14-3-3ε. To map the region within NADE required for interaction with 14-3-3ε, we utilized GST pull-down assays. Myc-tagged NADE deletion mutants encoding amino acid residues 1–112, 1–80, 1–70, or 81–124 were transfected into HEK293 cells, and the resulting cell lysates were incubated with GST/14-3-3ε fusion proteins conjugated with glutathione beads. The incubated beads were then washed and subjected to Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody. The results showed that NADE mutants encoding (1)-NADE and (81)-NADE bound to GST/14-3-3ε but not to GST alone. However, NADE deletion mutants (1–70)-NADE and (1–80)-NADE bound neither to GST/14-3-3ε nor to GST alone (Fig. 2 A). The lysates from HEK293 cells expressing (1)-NADE exhibited two immunoreactive bands estimated at 20 and 40 kDa on anti-Myc Western blotting. However, the lysates from (1–70)-NADE and (1–80)-NADE exhibited only one immunoreactive band estimated to be the same as their putative molecular weight (Fig.2 A). To map further the region within the 14-3-3ε required for interaction with NADE, we conducted a GST pull-down assay. FLAG-tagged deletion mutant forms of 14-3-3ε encoding amino acid residues 1–120, 1–207, or 121–207 were transfected into HEK293 cells, and the resulting cell lysates were incubated with GST/NADE fusion proteins conjugated with glutathione beads. The results showed that (1)-14-3-3ε and (121)-14-3-3ε bound to NADE/GST but not GST alone. However, 14-3-3ε deletion mutant (1)-14-3-3ε did not bind to NADE/GST (Fig. 2 B). The regions necessary for both bindings are summarized in Fig. 1. To confirm the association of NADE with 14-3-3ε in vivo, both Myc-tagged NADE and FLAG-tagged 14-3-3ε were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells. The resulting cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with either CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody, anti-Myc antibody, or murine IgG. We confirmed the association of 14-3-3ε with NADEin vivo by Western blotting with an anti-Myc antibody (Fig.3 A, left). The same immunoprecipitated samples were also subjected to Western blotting with an anti-FLAG antibody. These experiments also clearly showed that NADE associates with 14-3-3ε in vivo (Fig. 3 A,right). In addition, co-immunoprecipitation assays under more physiological conditions were performed using the cell lysate of pheochromocytoma PC12nnr5. Cell lysates of PC12nnr5 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with either CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B-conjugated anti-14-3-3 polyclonal antibody, anti-NADE polyclonal antibody (number 5), or rabbit IgG. We confirmed the association of 14-3-3ε with NADE in PC12nnr5 cells by Western blotting with an anti-NADE antibody (Fig.3 B, left). We detected only 20-kDa NADE products in both immunoprecipitants with an anti-NADE antibody and with an anti-14-3-3 antibody. However, we did not detect any NADE products in immunoprecipitants with rabbit IgG. The same immunoprecipitated samples were subjected to Western blotting with an anti-14-3-3 antibody. The experiments clearly showed that NADE associates with 14-3-3ε alsoin vivo (Fig. 3 B, right). We previously reported that NADE interacts with p75NTR (26Mukai J. Hachiya T. Shoji-Hoshino S. Kimura M.T. Nadano D. Suvanto P. Hanaoka T. Li Y. Irie S. Greene L.A. Sato T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17566-17570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To confirm that the protein complexes contain p75NTR, NADE, and 14-3-3ε, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with p75NTR, Myc-tagged NADE, and FLAG-tagged 14-3-3ε (p75NTR/mycNADE/FLAG14-3-3ε//HEK293). The resulting lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody, and the immune complexes were washed and analyzed by anti-p75NTR Western blotting. The results showed that exogenously expressed 14-3-3ε associates with p75NTR in p75NTR/mycNADE/FLAG14-3-3ε//HEK293 cells (Fig. 3 C). To examine whether NADE is required for the association of p75NTR with 14-3-3ε, HEK293 cells were co-expressed with p75NTR and FLAG-tagged 14-3-3ε in the absence of NADE. FLAG-tagged 14-3-3ε was immunoprecipitated from lysates of p75NTR/FLAG14-3-3ε//HEK293 cells with an anti-FLAG antibody, and the resulting immune complexes were subjected to Western blotting with an anti-p75NTR antibody. In the absence of NADE, 14-3-3ε did not associate with p75NTR (Fig.3 C). Co-expression of NADE and p75NTR-induced apoptosis followed by caspase-3 activation in HEK293 cell (26Mukai J. Hachiya T.

To examine the effect of 14-3-3ε protein on the p75NTR/NADE-mediated apoptosis, wild type or deletion mutant forms of 14-3-3ε were co-transfected into HEK293 cells expressing both p75NTR and NADE. At 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with 100 ng/ml NGF for 24 h. The transfectants were then harvested, and apoptotic cells were enumerated by trypan blue staining. The percentage of apoptotic cells was 45.2% in cells transfected with p75NTR and NADE (n = 7), 48.1% in cells transfected with p75NTR, NADE, and wild type 14-3-3ε (n = 5), and 46.9% in cells transfected with p75NTR, NADE, and"

Previous genetic studies suggested that a presumptive protein methyltransferase, Skb1, functions as a positive modulator of Shk1. However, unlike Shk1, Skb1 is not required for viability or mating of S. pombe cells and contributes only modestly to the regulation of cell morphology under normal growth conditions. Here we demonstrate that Skb1 plays a more significant role in regulating cell growth and polarity under conditions of hyperosmotic stress. We provide evidence that the inability of skb1Δ cells to properly maintain cell polarity in hyperosmotic conditions results from inefficient subcellular targeting of F-actin. We show that Skb1 localizes to cell ends, sites of septation, and nuclei of S. pombe cells. Hyperosmotic shock results in substantial delocalization of Skb1 from cell ends and nuclei, as well as stimulation of Skb1 protein methyltransferase activity. Taken together, our results demonstrate a new role for Skb1 as a mediator of hyperosmotic stress response in fission yeast. We show that the protein methyltransferase activity of the human Skb1 homolog, Skb1Hs, is also stimulated by hyperosmotic stress in fission yeast, providing evidence for evolutionary conservation of a role for Skb1-related proteins as mediators of hyperosmotic stress response, as well as mechanisms involved in regulating this novel class of protein methyltransferases.

Ras1 is required for normal morphology and mating ofS. pombe cells, but unlike Cdc42 and Shk1, it is not essential for cell viability (7Fukui Y. Kozasa T. Kaziro Y. Takeda T. Yamamoto M.

Skb1 interacts with the amino-terminal regulatory domain of Shk1, and co-overexpression of the two proteins suppresses the morphological defect of ras1Δ cells (1Gilbreth M. Yang P. Wang D. Frost J.

In contrast, overexpression of Skb1 results in a substantial delay in G2/M progression, suggesting that Skb1 has a dose-dependent mitotic inhibitory function. The G2/M delay caused by Skb1 overexpression is dependent on both Shk1 and the Cdc2 inhibitory kinase Wee1 (2Gilbreth M. Yang P. Bartholomeusz G. Pimental R.A. Kansra S. Gadiraju R. Marcus S. Proc.

The budding yeast homolog of the skb1 gene, HSL7, was discovered from a screen for mutations that are synthetically lethal in combination with a deletion of the amino terminus of histone H3 (3Ma X.J. Lu Q. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The same screen resulted in the identification of mutations in genes encoding budding yeast homologs of the fission yeast cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc2 (Cdc28) and the Wee1 inhibitory kinase Nim1 (Hsl1). Loss-of-function of Hsl7 results in a delay in G2/M progression, suggesting that Hsl7, in contrast to Skb1, functions as a mitotic inducer (3Ma X.J. Lu Q. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The G2/M delay of the hsl7 mutant can be suppressed by a null mutation in the swe1 gene, suggesting that Hsl7 is an inhibitor of Swe1 (3Ma X.J. Lu Q. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This role for Hsl7 is supported by the findings of McMillan et al. (10McMillan J.N. Longtine M.S. Sia R.A. Theesfeld C.L. Bardes E.S. Pringle J.R. Lew D.J. Mol. Cell.

The cellular functions of metazoan Skb1/Hsl7-related proteins have yet to be defined, however, a human Skb1/Hsl7 homolog, Skb1Hs (also known as IBP72 (13Krapivinsky G. Pu W. Wickman K. Krapivinsky L.

The biological significance of the interactions between Skb1Hs and these various proteins has not yet been established. Skb1/Hsl7-related proteins lack significant structural homology to any other characterized proteins. However, Pollack et al. (14Pollack B.P. Kotenko S.V. He W. Izotova L.S. Barnoski B.L. Pestka S. J.

These investigators also demonstrated that immunoprecipitates of Skb1Hs contain protein methyltransferase activity, suggesting that Skb1Hs either possesses an intrinsic protein methyltransferase function or associates with a protein methyltransferase (14Pollack B.P.

In this report, we show that Skb1, which is largely dispensable for the regulation of cell morphology under normal conditions, is a hyperosmotic shock stimulated enzyme required for normal cell viability and morphological polarity under conditions of hyperosmotic stress. We also provide molecular evidence for evolutionary conservation of a role for Skb1/Hsl7-related proteins as mediators of hyperosmotic stress response, as well as Skb1/Hsl7 regulatory mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.

Chang). This plasmid allows for expression of a triple HA epitope-tagged Skb1 protein from the nmt1 promoter (17Maundrell K. J. Biol.

Experiments with Fission Yeast: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of HA-Skb1 was performed using mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody 12CA5 (19Field J. Nikawa J. Broek D. MacDonald B. Rodgers L. Wilson I.A. Lerner R.A. Wigler M. Mol. Cell.

Cheng Q.C. Albright C.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 468-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). S. pombe cells transformed with the plasmids pART1CM, pART1CMSkb1, or pART1CMSkb1Hs were grown in 200 ml of EMM to about 107 cells/ml prior to harvesting of cells by centrifugation. Cultures were diluted with an equal volume of either EMM or EMM containing 3 m KCl and grown for 15–60 min prior to harvesting. Cell lysates were prepared as described (6Yang P. Kansra S. Pimental R.A. Gilbreth M. Marcus S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18481-18489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were performed by incubating extract volumes containing 2 mg of protein with 5 μl of anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 ascites (20Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar) and 25 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with 1 ml of yeast lysis buffer and then twice with 1 ml of methylation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA). Samples were divided into 2 equal volumes, one of which was pelleted and resuspended in 40 μl of methylation buffer and the other pelleted and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. GST-Skb1 was expressed in the E. coli host strain BL21 from the plasmid pRP259 (a gift from E. Chang), a derivative of pGEX-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST-Skb1 was purified from bacterial cell lysates using glutathione-agarose beads following the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Beads containing GST-Skb1 were resuspended in methylation buffer. Methylation assays were performed essentially as described (14Pollack B.P. Kotenko S.V. He W. Izotova L.S. Barnoski B.L. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31531-31542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). To initiate the methylation reaction, 5 μl of [3H]adenosyl methionine (specific activity, 78 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 5 μl of myelin basic protein solution (12 mg/ml in methylation buffer) were added to each 40-μl volume of immune complex or GST-Skb1 beads in methylation buffer and incubated 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by placing on ice, adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and boiling for 5 min. Reactions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and exposed to x-ray film for 3–6 days. The remaining portion of each immune complex was boiled for 5 min and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blot analysis to measure the relative amount of Skb1 protein isolated from each GST precipitation or immunoprecipitation. Under normal growth conditions, S. pombe skb1Δ mutants are only modestly defective in cell growth and divide at a length just slightly shorter than that of wild-typeS. pombe cells. We demonstrated previously that S. pombe mutants carrying a null mutation in the skb5gene, which encodes an SH3 domain protein that directly activates Shk1, are unable to maintain cell polarity under conditions of hyperosmotic stress (21Yang P. Pimental R. Lai H. Marcus S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36052-36057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PAKs have been implicated in the regulation of osmotic stress response in budding yeast and mammalian cells (22Raitt D.C. Posas F. Saito H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4623-4631Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 23Roig J. Huang Z. Lytle C. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16933-16940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Clerk A. Sugden P.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 23-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether Skb1 might play a more prominent role in regulating cell viability or morphology when S. pombe cells are subjected to hyperosmotic stress. Although not completely inhibited for growth, skb1Δ cells grew substantially slower than wild-type S. pombe cells on minimal medium containing 1.5 m KCl (Fig.1 A). We observed further thatskb1Δ cells exhibited a marked defect in the ability to maintain cell polarity in hyperosmotic medium, becoming stubby to round in appearance at a high frequency when compared with wild-type S. pombe cells, which retained a primarily rod-like appearance under the same conditions (Fig. 1 B). These observations demonstrate that Skb1, although largely dispensable for growth and maintenance of cell morphology under normal growth conditions, plays a more significant role in regulating cell growth and polarity under conditions of hyperosmotic stress. During interphase, cortical F-actin patches are concentrated at the growing ends ofS. pombe cells (25Le Goff X. Utzig S. Simanis V. Curr. Genet. 1999; 35: 571-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). When S. pombe cells are subjected to hyperosmotic shock, F-actin patches become transiently delocalized from the cell ends and randomly distributed but eventually redistribute to the cell ends after continued incubation in hyperosmotic medium (26Rupes I. Jia Z. Young P.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1495-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To determine whether the inability ofskb1Δ mutants to properly maintain cell polarity in hyperosmotic medium might correlate with a defect in regulating the polarization of F-actin patches, we examined the appearance of F-actin in wild-type and skb1Δ S. pombe cells after subjecting them to hyperosmotic stress. Consistent with previously reported observations (26Rupes I. Jia Z. Young P.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1495-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we found that F-actin patches became delocalized from cell ends and randomly distributed in both wild-type and skb1Δ cells within 30 min of exposure to EMM containing 1 m KCl (Fig. 2,EMM+KCl). After 2.5 h of incubation in EMM + 1m KCl, F-actin patches became substantially redistributed to the cell ends in wild-type S. pombe cultures but remained depolarized in skb1Δ cells (Fig. 2). After 3.5 h of incubation in 1 m KCl, cortical F-actin was redistributed to the ends of skb1Δ cells but at a lower frequency than in cultures of wild-type cells. These results suggest that the failure of skb1Δ mutants to properly maintain morphological polarity in hyperosmotic medium is likely to be due, at least in part, to a defect in effectively repolarizing the localization of F-actin patches to the cell ends, a process viewed as essential for establishing and maintaining morphological polarity in S. pombe cells (25Le Goff X. Utzig S. Simanis V. Curr. Genet. 1999; 35: 571-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To obtain additional insights into the role of Skb1 as a morphological regulator, we performed experiments to examine its subcellular localization. To do this, we constructed the plasmid pREPUHASkb1 for expressing Skb1 as a triple hemagglutinin epitope-tagged protein (HA-Skb1) from the thiamine-repressiblenmt1 promoter (17Maundrell K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10857-10864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). S. pombe cells transformed with pREPUHASkb1 were grown in medium containing thiamine to repress expression of HA-Skb1, then transferred to medium lacking thiamine, and grown for 11 h to derepress HA-Skb1 expression prior to immunofluorescence microscopy. HA-Skb1 protein was detected at either one or both cell ends in interphase cells and at what appeared to be the nuclear periphery in both interphase and mitotic cells (Fig.3, A and B). In a small percentage of dividing cells, we were able to detect HA-Skb1 at the septum-forming region (Fig. 3 B). The localization of Skb1 to cell ends is consistent with its role as a regulator of morphological polarity, because a number of S. pombeproteins required for proper control of cell polarity has been shown to localize to the cell ends (27Mata J. Nurse P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 163-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 28Sawin K.E. Nurse P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 457-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To obtain additional molecular evidence of a role for Skb1 as a mediator of hyperosmotic stress response, we determined whether its subcellular localization or protein methyltransferase activity are affected by hyperosmotic shock. S. pombe cells expressing HA-Skb1 were grown in EMM and then shifted to EMM with 1.5 m KCl. Culture samples were then processed for immunostaining at various time points after transfer to hyperosmotic medium. We found that the frequency of cells exhibiting HA-Skb1 at cell ends and nuclei was markedly reduced within 15 min of hyperosmotic shock (Fig. 4). After this initial delocalization, HA-Skb1 protein returned substantially to the cell ends and nuclei within 1 h of exposure to 1.5 mKCl. Immune complexes of both human and budding yeast homologs of Skb1 have been shown to possess protein methyltransferase activity. We determined that recombinant Skb1 protein purified from either fission yeast or bacterial cells likewise possesses protein methyltransferase activity (Fig. 5 A), thereby demonstrating for the first time that this activity represents an intrinsic enzymatic function of this class of proteins. To examine whether Skb1 methyltransferase activity is stimulated by hyperosmotic shock, cells expressing a c-Myc epitope-tagged Skb1 protein were grown in EMM and were then shifted to either EMM or EMM + 1.5 mKCl and incubated for 15 to 60 min prior to lysing the cells and assaying for Skb1 protein methyltransferase activity. As shown in Fig.5 B, Skb1 methyltransferase activity was stimulated within 15 min of hyperosmotic shock. We conclude from these experiments that hyperosmotic shock induces both a delocalization of Skb1 protein from cell ends and nuclei, as well as a concomitant increase in Skb1 protein methyltransferase activity. To address whether the methyltransferase activity of Skb1Hs is stimulated by hyperosmotic shock in fission yeast cells, we subjected cells expressing Skb1Hs to hyperosmotic shock and then prepared cell lysates and assayed Skb1Hs protein methyltransferase activity. As shown in Fig. 5 C, Skb1Hs methyltransferase activity, similar to that of fission yeast Skb1, was rapidly stimulated by hyperosmotic shock, suggesting that mediation of hyperosmotic stress response is likely to represent a conserved function of Skb1-related proteins. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that a highly conserved protein methyltransferase, Skb1, is required for normal growth and maintenance of cell polarity under conditions of hyperosmotic stress in fission yeast. We have shown that skb1Δ mutants are defective in redistributing F-actin patches to cell ends after hyperosmotic stress-induced F-actin depolarization. It is likely that the failure ofskb1Δ cells to properly maintain cell polarity in hyperosmotic medium is caused, at least in part, by this defect. Correlating with these findings, we found that in response to hyperosmotic stress, the Skb1 protein delocalizes from cell ends and nuclei and becomes markedly stimulated with respect to its protein methyltransferase activity. Cumulatively, these data establish a role for Skb1 as a mediator of hyperosmotic stress response in fission yeast. Previous genetic studies suggested that Skb1 functions as a positive modulator of the fission yeast PAK, Shk1. Whereas Shk1 plays an essential role in regulating the localization of F-actin patches and cell polarity under normal growth conditions, we consider it likely that it also shares with Skb1 a role in mediating hyperosmotic stress response because of the following. (i) Its kinase activity is rapidly stimulated by hyperosmotic stress. (ii) Similar to Skb1, it becomes delocalized from cell ends in response to hyperosmotic stress, and (iii) it is required for proper subcellular targeting of Skb1. 2Y. Qyang, R. Pimental, and S. Marcus, unpublished observations. Importantly, we have shown that the protein methyltransferase activity of the human Skb1/Hsl7 homolog, Skb1Hs, is induced by hyperosmotic stress in S. pombe cells. This result provides evidence for evolutionary conservation of a role for Skb1/Hsl7-related proteins in mediating cellular response to hyperosmotic stress. Moreover, the fact that the Skb1Hs enzyme is induced by hyperosmotic stress in S. pombe cells suggests that mechanisms involved in regulating the function of these highly conserved proteins may have also been substantially conserved through evolution. Protein sequence analyses suggest that Skb1/Hsl7-related proteins belong to the protein arginine methyltransferase family (14Pollack B.P. Kotenko S.V. He W. Izotova L.S. Barnoski B.L. Pestka S. J.

A variety of eukaryotic proteins of diverse function have been shown to undergo methylation on arginine or lysine residues (30Aletta J.M. Cimato T.R. Ettinger M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 89-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Although the functional significance of this modification remains ill defined in all but a handful of cases, recent studies have implicated arginine methylation as being of potential significance in signal transduction (31Lin W.J.

The results presented in this report suggest that protein methylation is likely to play a role in cellular response to hyperosmotic stress. The continued characterization of Skb1/Hsl7-related protein methyltransferases and in particular the identification of Skb1 substrates in the evolutionarily distant fission and budding yeasts will undoubtedly shed substantial new insights into roles for protein methylation in eukaryotic organisms."

Thus, previous data are consistent with NIK having a significant role in LMP1 activation of NF-κB. The experiments reported here further investigate the role of NIK and of the aly mutation in NF-κB activation by LMP1, LTβR, and CD40. Wild type hNIK624–947was amplified by PCR of hNIK cDNA with oligonucleotides NF3 (5′ GGATCCCCTCTCACAGCCCAGGCCATC 3′) and NR1 (5′ GAATTCTTAGGGCCTGTTCTCCAGCTGGC 3′) that included BamHI andEcoRI sites and cloned into pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for bacterial expression. The alyhNIK624–947 GST mutant was made by site-directed mutagenesis of the hNIK codon 860 with primers NF8 (5′ AGCTATTTCAATCGGGTGAAAGTCCAAATA CAG 3′) and NR6 (5′ CTGTATTTGGACTTTCACCCGATTGAAATAGCTTGG 3′) followed by PCR with theBamHI and EcoRI primers and cloned into pGEX-2TK. The BamHI/EcoRI fragments were also used to make wt and aly DN-NIK for mammalian expression by subcloning into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen).

MEFs from aly/aly and wild type mice were obtained from Dr. T. Honjo. Primary MEFs were not amenable to transfection.

After incubation at 30 °C for 1 h and preclearing with GST-bound glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C, IVTs were split into fractions for incubation with ∼5 μg of wt or aly NIK-GST fusion proteins or GST alone. The GST/IVT mix was rotated at 4 °C for 1 h, beads were washed 3–5 times with GST lysis buffer, and boiled in 30 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics). For transfections, 293T cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 5 × 105 cells/well, and 24 h later 3 wells were transfected with 1 μg of pCDNA3-F-TRAF2 or pRK5-myc-IKKα per well and 2, 3, or 4 μg/well of wt or aly DN-NIK or pCDNA3 for each immune precipitation. Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5) containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) and aprotinin (22 μg/ml) for 30 min on ice.

After rotation for 1 h at 4 °C for C-20, protein G-Sepharose was added to the samples for an additional 1 h. Immune precipitates were washed 3–5 times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Samples were denatured in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting (IB).

LMP1 expression in 293T cells strongly activated NF-κB as measured by a co-transfected reporter with three NF-κB sites from the major histocompatibility complex I promoter upstream of luciferase and a pGK-β-galactosidase control plasmid (see Fig.1 and Refs. 7Sylla B.S.

J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2968-2976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LMP1-mediated NF-κB activation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by co-expression of the wt DN-NIK fragment (aa 624–947) (Fig.1 A). In contrast to the effect of wt DN-NIK, co-expression of the DN-NIK containing the aly point mutation G860R did not inhibit LMP1 activation of NF-κB (Fig. 1 B). wt andaly DN-NIK were expressed at equivalent levels, β-galactosidase levels did not vary more than 2-fold, and LMP1 expression was not affected by either wt or aly DN-NIK (Fig.1 C), excluding an artifactual basis for the differential effect. Thus, LMP1 activation of NF-κB is resistant to alybut not to wt DN-NIK as had been previously noted for LTβR (12Shinkura R. Kitada K. Matsuda F. Tashiro K. Ikuta K. Suzuki M. Kogishi K. Serikawa T. Honjo T. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained in multiple experiments in 293 and 293T cells. To evaluate whether the differential effect of the wt andaly DN-NIK is specific for LMP1 and LTβR signaling as opposed to other TNFRs, the effect of wt and aly DN-NIK on NF-κB activation by LMP1, LTβR, and CD40 was assayed in 293T and 293 cells. The LMP1 transmembrane domains were used to provide constitutive, ligand-independent receptor aggregation. Isogenic expression constructs were made in which the LMP1 C-terminal cytoplasmic domain was replaced with the LTβR or CD40 C-terminal cytoplasmic domains. LMP1 and the LMP1/LTβR chimera activated NF-κB, and the activation was inhibited by wt but not byaly DN-NIK (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, A andB). wt and aly DN-NIK did not affect LMP1/LTβR expression, and β-galactosidase levels did not vary more than 2-fold (Fig. 2 C and data not shown). These results are consistent with the previous observation that NF-κB activation following LTβR overexpression is inhibited by wt but not by aly DN-NIK (12Shinkura R. Kitada K. Matsuda F. Tashiro K. Ikuta K. Suzuki M. Kogishi K. Serikawa T. Honjo T. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In contrast to the effects of wt but notaly DN-NIK on LMP1 or LMP1/LTβR activation of NF-κB, NF-κB activation mediated by an LMP1/CD40 cytoplasmic domain chimera or by CD40 overexpression was inhibited by both wt and alyDN-NIK (Fig. 3, A andB and data not shown). CD40 and LMP1/CD40 expression were not affected by either wt or aly DN-NIK (Fig. 3 Cand data not shown). These data support a model in which LMP1 and LTβR activation of NF-κB involves a downstream molecular interaction that can be inhibited by wt hNIK aa 624–947 but not by the corresponding fragment with the glycine to arginine mutation at codon 860.Figure 3CD40-mediated NF-κB activation is inhibited by both wt and aly DN-NIK. A and B, this experiment was identical to that shown in Fig. 1, except that 1 μg of CD40 was transfected instead of LMP1. The data shown are from one representative experiment of two with CD40 and three with LMP1/CD40 (not shown).C, IB of CD40 from cells transfected with CD40 alone (lane 1) or with CD40 plus 0.1 or 2 μg of wt DN-NIK (lanes 2 and 3). Identical expression of CD40 was seen with CD40 plus aly DN-NIK (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To evaluate the direct effect of the alymutation on LMP1, LTβR, and CD40 activation of NF-κB, NF-κB activation by isogenic LMP1, LMP1/LTβR, and LMP1/CD40 was assessed in wt and aly/aly MEFs using the co-transfected NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter and control pGK-β-galactosidase expression plasmids. Before initiating this series of experiments, the MEFs were first transformed with a human papilloma virus 16 E6 and E7-expressing retrovirus so as to enhance their growth and transfection efficiency (24Chen L. Ashe S. Singhal M.C. Galloway D.A. Hellstrom I. Hellstrom K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6523-6527Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The surprising result was that LMP1, LMP1/LTβR, and LMP1/CD40 activated NF-κB similarly in wt and aly/aly MEFs indicating that NIK is not essential for NF-κB activation by these receptors in fibroblasts (Fig. 4). Thus, the insensitivity of LMP1 and LMP1/LTβR to aly DN-NIK inhibition of NF-κB activation is not because of a specific and exclusive dependence of these receptors on wt NIK for NF-κB activation. Thealy mutation at codon 860 falls within both the TRAF binding domain (aa 624–947) and the IKK binding domain (aa 735–947) of hNIK (1Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D.

Thealy/aly phenotype is presumed to be because of the failure of aly NIK to interact with TRAFs (25Foehr E.D. Bohuslav J. Chen L.F. DeNoronha C. Geleziunas R. Lin X. O'Mahony A. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34021-34024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To more precisely determine the biochemical basis for the aly effect on NIK interactions, we compared the in vitro and in vivo binding of wt and aly NIK to TRAFs. hTRAFs 1, 2, and 3 and mTRAF6 were transcribed and translated with radiolabeled [35S]methionine, and their ability to bindin vitro to equal amounts of wt or aly hNIK aa 624–947 fused to GST (NIK624–947-GST) was assessed. Thealy mutation did not affect TRAFs binding to NIK624–947-GST in vitro (Fig. 5 B). However, TRAFs differed in their binding to NIK624–947-GST; TRAF1 and -2 bound to NIK624–947-GST at the 10 to 15% level, whereas less than 3% of TRAF3 or -6 bound to NIK624–947-GST (Fig.5 B). Because TRAF2 is an important mediator of TNFR1-induced NF-κB activation (26Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), TRAF2 associations with wt and aly NIK were evaluated in 293 cells that were co-transfected with a FLAG-tagged TRAF2 expression construct and either wt or aly DN-NIK (aa 624–947). F-TRAF2 was immune-precipitated using M2-conjugated Sepharose beads, and the complexes were blotted for the presence of NIK. F-TRAF2 consistently brought down equivalent amounts of wt oraly DN-NIK (Fig. 5 C). These data indicate that the aly/aly phenotype is unlikely to be because of the previously postulated inability of TRAFs to engage and associate withaly NIK. hNIK aa 735–947 is not only part of the domain that binds to TRAFs but is also a sufficient domain for interaction with IKKα (3Lin X. Mu Y. Cunningham E.T. Marcu K.B. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5899-5907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). hNIK aa 735–947 efficiently competes with wt NIK for binding to IKKα and is a dominant negative inhibitor of TNF-mediated NF-κB activation (3Lin X. Mu Y. Cunningham E.T. Marcu K.B. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5899-5907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, only wt but not alyNIK624–947-GST was able to pull down Myc-IKKα from lysates of 293T cells in which Myc-IKKα was expressed. About 10% of the Myc-tagged IKKα bound to wt NIK624–947-GST, whereas binding to similar amounts of alyNIK624–947-GST was below the limits of detection (Fig.6 A). In similar experiments, the binding of FLAG-tagged IKKβ expressed in 293T cells to wt or aly NIK624–947-GST was assessed. As reported for full-length NIK (27Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar), FLAG-tagged IKKβ bound very weakly to wt NIK624–947-GST, at a level of about 1% of input IKKβ (Fig. 6 A). Binding of F-IKKβ toaly NIK624–947-GST was about half the level of binding to wt and about twice as strong as to GST alone (Fig.6 A). To evaluate the association of Myc-IKKα with wt or alyDN-NIK in vivo, 293T cells were co-transfected with Myc-IKKα and wt or aly DN-NIK expression vectors, lysed in non-ionic detergent, and immune-precipitated with anti-Myc antibody followed by immune blotting for NIK. The efficiency of the Myc-IKKα IP was about 10% (data not shown). wt DN-NIK was readily detected in the immune precipitate, whereas aly DN-NIK was not detectable (Fig. 6 B). Thus, the aly mutation results in virtually complete loss of interaction or association of DN-NIK with IKKα. The data presented here indicate that LMP1, LMP1/LTβR, and LMP1/CD40 activate NF-κB similarly in wild type andaly/aly murine embryo fibroblasts. Therefore, NIK either does not have a direct role in NF-κB activation from any of these receptor cytoplasmic domains in MEFs, or another kinase substitutes for NIK in the transfected aly/aly fibroblasts and is unable to substitute under more physiologic conditions in vivo. Although this latter possibility seems a priori unlikely, similar substitution effects have been noted among MAP kinases in yeast, for example (28Kranz J.E. Satterberg B. Elion E.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 313-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 29Elion E.A. Science. 1998; 281: 1625-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 30Lee B.N. Elion E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Further, the similarity between thealy/aly and LTβR−/− phenotypes is most consistent with a physiologically significant role for thealy mutation in LTβR signaling. Moreover, the inability of the aly DN-NIK to specifically block LMP1 and LMP1/LTβR activation of NF-κB in 293 cells supports the notion that these cytoplasmic domains signal through a pathway that is specifically blocked by wt and not by aly DN-NIK. Indeed, the biochemical studies further support the hypothesis that the effect is at the level of NIK per se, in indicating that aly hNIK is most abnormal in loss of interaction with IKKα, is not abnormal in interaction with TRAF1, 2, 3, or 6, and is only minimally evident in diminished very weak interaction with IKKβ. The simplest explanation of the inability of the aly DN-NIK to block LMP1 or LMP1/LTβR activation of NF-κB is thataly NIK is unable to bind to an essential mediator of that pathway. The aly mutation is within the NIK TRAF binding domain, and the failure of aly NIK to block some TNFRs has been attributed to a putative affect of the aly mutation on TRAF binding. Our data indicate that the aly mutation does not affect NIK binding to or association with TRAF1, 2, 3, or 6, making it less likely that the aly effect is at the level of TRAF interaction with NIK. Instead, we find aly NIK to be highly deficient in binding to IKKα and that both wt and alymutant NIK bind poorly to IKKβ. Thus, the ability of wt NIK and the inability of aly NIK to block NF-κB activation from LMP1 or LMP1/LTβR are most consistent with a key role for a NIK-like kinase and IKKα in LMP1 and LTβR activation of NF-κB. Further, the blockade of CD40 and LMP1/CD40 activation of NF-κB by both wt andaly DN-NIK are most compatible with the possibility that CD40 signaling through the IKK complex is mediated by a protein that can be blocked by either the wt or aly NIK C terminus. During the preparation of this manuscript, two publications appeared that are relevant to these experiments. In one, NIK is found to associate with the p100 precursor to the NF-κB subunit p52 and induce its phosphorylation and proteolytic processing (34Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). alyNIK, however, is unable to associate with p100 or induce p100 phosphorylation and processing (34Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, p52 is not detected in aly/aly cells, despite the presence of p100 (34Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 35Yamada T. Mitani T. Yorita K. Uchida D. Matsushima A. Iwamasa K. Fujita S. Matsumoto M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 804-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, although p52−/−mice have major defects in germinal center formation and splenic architecture similar to aly/aly and LTβR−/−mice, serum Ig levels and proliferation in response to LPS and CD40L appear relatively normal in p52−/− mice but are abnormal in aly/aly mice (36Caamano J.H.

Therefore, the deficiency in p100 processing is likely to account for only part of thealy/aly phenotype. In a second very recent paper, B cells from IKKα−/− mice are found to be quite similar to aly/aly B cells in their response to LPS and CD40L (38Kaisho T. Takeda K. Tohru T. Kawai T. Nomura F. Terada N. Akira S. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This report is consistent with our finding that aly NIK is unable to interact with IKKα. Moreover, serum Ig levels are depressed in IKKα−/− bone marrow chimeras and inaly/aly mice but not in p52−/− mice (38Kaisho T. Takeda K. Tohru T. Kawai T. Nomura F. Terada N. Akira S. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus, the inability of aly NIK to process p100 into p52 and the inability of aly NIK to interact with IKKα may both contribute to the aly/aly phenotype. We thank Drs. R. Shinkura, T. Honjo, J. Inoue, E. Hung, B. Sylla, P. Howley, E. Cooper, and D. Goeddel for reagents. Also, we are grateful for helpful comments and discussion from the Kieff laboratory."

SK with mutations of groups of amino acids outside the coiled coil region of SK γ-domain, SKK278A,K279A,E281A,K282A, and SKD360A,R363A had similar HPlg activator activities as wild-type SK.

Both SKD322A,R324A,D325A and SKR330A,D331A,K332A,K334A had decreased amounts of complex formation with microplasminogen and failed to activate HPlg. SKD328A,R330A had a 21-fold reduced catalytic efficiency for HPlg activation. The studies of SK with single amino acid mutation to Ala demonstrate that Arg324, Asp325, Lys332, and Lys334 play important roles in the formation of a HPlg·SK complex.

Therefore, we conclude that the coiled coil region of SK γ-domain, SK(Leu314-Ala342), plays very important roles in HPlg activation by participating in virgin enzyme induction and stabilizing the activator complex. streptokinase human plasminogen human plasmin plasminogen polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis human microplasminogen, plasminogen fragment consisting of Lys531–Asn791 human microplasmin SKK278A,K279A,E281A,K282A SKD360A,R363A SKD322A,R324A,D325A SKD328A,R330A SKR330A,D331A,K332A,K334A Bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate p-nitrophenyl-p-guanidinobenzoate 4-methylumbelliferyl p-guanidinobenzoate Streptokinase (SK),1 a potent human plasminogen (HPlg) activator, is a single chain secretory protein produced by strains of β-hemolytic Streptococcus(1Tillet W.S.

The HPlg and SK complex can activate HPlg to plasmin (HPlm) which in turn catalyzes the hydrolysis of fibrin and dissolution of blood clots. SK, therefore, has been used as a thrombolytic agent in treatment of thromboembolic blockages in the blood vessels such as acute myocardial infarction. The NMR spectra of SK and the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of HPlm (μPlm) complexed with SK demonstrate three structurally autonomous domains in SK (4Parrado J. Conejero-Lara F. Smith R.A.G. Marshall J. Ponting C.P. Dobson C.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 693-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 5Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Based on the functional studies of truncated SK peptides, we demonstrated that SK-(158–414) in complex with equimolar HPlg could form amidolytically active virgin enzyme (6Young K.C. Shi G.Y.

The NH2-terminal domain of SK, SK-(16–251), could interact with substrate HPlg and render it to be activated by HPlg·SK activator complex more effectively (7Young K.C. Shi G.Y. Wu D.H. Chang L.C. Chang B.I. Ou C.P. Wu H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3110-3116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We also demonstrate that HPlg that binds to the COOH-terminal domains of SK functions as an enzyme to catalyze the conversion of substrate HPlg that binds to the NH2-terminal domain of SK to HPlm (7Young K.C.

The binding of HPlg and SK is very complex since HPlg consists of five kringle domains and a catalytic domain which have different affinity for SK (7Young K.C. Shi G.Y. Wu D.H. Chang L.C. Chang B.I. Ou C.P. Wu H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3110-3116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of SK and μPlm complex revealed that SK consists of three independent domains, α, β, and γ, starting from the NH2 terminus of SK (5Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Many interaction sites are proposed based on the crystal structure of SK·μPlm complex. Extensive charged and hydrophobic interactions between the SK γ-domain especially the major coiled coil region and the strandsγβ1 and γβ2with μPlm are observed (5Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Direct assistance by the SK β-domain in the docking and processing of substrate HPlg by the activator complex have been suggested (8Chaudhary A. Vasudha S. Rajagopal K. Komath S.S. Garg N. Yadav M. Mande S.C. Sahni G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2791-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The activation mechanism of HPlg by SK involving multiple interaction steps was suggested (7Young K.C.

SK forms a stable one to one complex with HPlg and induces a conformational change of HPlg to become a catalytically active enzyme that is named virgin enzyme. The HPlg·SK virgin enzyme complex is converted to HPlm·SK that functions as an enzyme activator to catalyze the activation of substrate HPlg to HPlm. To be an effective HPlg activator, HPlg and SK must form a stable activator complex, which can bind to the substrate HPlg and catalyze its conversion to HPlm. Based on the studies of the truncated SK peptides, we propose that the COOH-terminal half of SK is essential for maintaining a stable HPlg·SK or HPlm·SK complex and induction of virgin enzyme activity (6Young K.C. Shi G.Y. Chang Y.F. Chang B.I. Chang L.C. Lai M.D. Chuang W.J. Wu H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29601-29606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 7Young K.C. Shi G.Y.

On the other hand, recent studies on the mechanism by which SK forms a virgin enzyme in HPlg have led to some controversial conclusions (16Wang S. Reed G.L. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5232-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Wang S. Reed G.L. Hedstrom L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3994-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The experiments with deletion of Ile1 of SK (ΔIle1-SK) and mutations of Ile1 of SK have demonstrated that Ile1 of SK is required for the nonproteolytic activation of HPlg by SK (16Wang S. Reed G.L. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5232-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Wang S. Reed G.L. Hedstrom L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3994-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this “molecular sexuality hypothesis” model, the NH2terminus, Ile1, of SK is proposed to form a salt bridge with Asp740 of HPlg, which triggers a conformational change to produce an active site in the HPlg moiety, and thereby plays an essential role in the induction of virgin enzyme activity. It is most likely that multiple binding or contact sites between SK and HPlg are required for the induction of virgin enzyme activity and that the COOH-terminal half of SK (including all γ-domain) is also essential for induction of virgin enzyme activity as proposed by the “binding activation” model of HPlg activation (6Young K.C. Shi G.Y. Chang Y.F. Chang B.I. Chang L.C. Lai M.D. Chuang W.J. Wu H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29601-29606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 7Young K.C. Shi G.Y.

Sci. 2000; 25: 53-59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The elimination of one of the possible binding sites, such as ΔIle1-SK, may impair the induction of virgin enzyme activity (16Wang S. Reed G.L. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5232-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified the amino acid residues in the SK γ-domain which are involved in either virgin enzyme activity or the formation of a stable HPlg·SK complex by analyzing the functions of SK mutants with Ala-scanning mutagenesis. Enzymes used in DNA manipulation were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, New England Biolabs, Stratagene, orPromega Laboratories and were used according to the Cold Spring Harbor Manual (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or the recommendations by the suppliers. The full-length SK gene was obtained from Streptococcus equisimilis H46A (ATCC 12449) by the amplification with polymerase chain reaction as previously reported (6Young K.C. Shi G.Y. Chang Y.F.

Lys-Sepharose and CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; Macro-Prep High Q was from Bio-Rad; NH2-d-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide (S-2251) and p-nitrophenyl-p-guanidinobenzoate (NPGB) were obtained from Sigma. Bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) was purchased from Pierce. Aprotinin was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. SK antiserum was prepared in our laboratory from mice. HPlg was prepared from pooled human plasma as described (6Young K.C. Shi G.Y. Chang Y.F. Chang B.I. Chang L.C. Lai M.D. Chuang W.J. Wu H.L. J.

HPlg was passed through an aprotinin-substituted Sepharose 4B column to remove possible trace amounts of HPlm contamination. The method of preparing aprotinin-substituted Sepharose 4B was described in a previous paper (15Shi G.Y. Chang B.I. Chen S.M. Wu D.H. Wu H.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Form 2 of HPlg was used throughout the experiment. Human μPlg was made by incubating HPlg with HPlm in an alkaline solution and purified by Lys-Sepharose and soybean trypsin inhibitor-Sepharose 4B as described in previous reports (22Wu H.L.

Native SK (Behringwerke AG, Marburg, Germany) was further purified by passing it through a Blue-Sepharose CL 6B column to remove serum albumin (25Siefring G.E.J. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3913-3920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thirteen SK mutants were constructed in which clusters of two to four charged residues and a specific single charged residue in the SK molecule between residues 278 and 363 were converted to Ala. Since we have found previously that truncated wild-type SK-(16–378) could activate HPlg as efficiently as the authentic SK (6Young K.C. Shi G.Y. Chang Y.F. Chang B.I. Chang L.C. Lai M.D. Chuang W.J.

Primers SK-S16, SK-AS378, and pairs of mutagenic primers (as shown in Table I) were custom synthesized by Pan Asia Hospital Supply Co. (Taiwan, Republic of China). SK-S16 and SK-AS378 were a pair of DNA primers covering the coding region of SK gene encoding amino acid residues from 16 to 378.

The mutagenic sense primer (as shown in Table I), which contained a specific restriction site, and SK-AS378 primer, were used to amplify a part of SK DNA covering the mutated position to 1134 of the coding region of SK gene by a PCR technique. The mutagenic antisense primer and SK-S16 were used to amplify another part of SK DNA covering nucleotide positions 48 to mutated point of coding region of SK gene. These two amplified DNA fragments were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The mutated SK gene was constructed from these two pieces of DNA by denaturation, annealing, and extension. SKR330A,D331A,K332A,K334A (abbreviated as SK(330–334Ala)) gene was constructed by ExSite™ PCR-based Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The 1.1-kilobase DNA fragment was then ligated to pPCR-Script™ Amp SK(+) cloning vector (Stratagene) and transformed into Epicurian coliXL10-Gold™Kan ultracompetent cells. The mutations were confirmed by the sequencing of the complete coding region using dideoxy sequencing techniques (26Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52770) Google Scholar). Both strands of each mutated gene were completely sequenced to make sure no other PCR-initiated mutations had been introduced. Mutated SK gene fragments were subcloned in-frame into the overproducing plasmid pET-3a (Novagen) at the BamHI site. Transformed bacteria cells,Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS, were grown to mid-log phase, and target gene expression was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 3 h, the expressing cells were harvested, washed, and disintegrated. Then the target proteins were concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation and purified to homogeneity by a high Q anion exchange column (27Shi G.Y. Chang B.I. Su S.W. Young K.C. Wu D.H. Chang L.C. Tsai Y.S. Wu H.L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 992-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The expressed wild-type SK-(16–378) and all the SK mutant proteins were sequenced, and the results showed that an additional fusion peptide of 14 amino acid residues derived from the pET-3 plasmid and BamHI restriction site was attached at their NH2 termini. The protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using the following ε280nm1% values and molecular weights, respectively: HPlg, 17.0 and 94,000; μPlg, 16.0 and 28,617; SK-(16–387), 9.5 and 43,000. A one-stage assay as described previously was used to measure HPlg activation by SK mutants (28Wohl R.C. Summaria L. Robbins K.C. J. Biol.

Briefly, HPlg at final concentrations ranging from 0.04 to 4 μm was incubated with 0.5 mm S-2251 in an assay cuvette containing 150 μl of 0.05 m Tris buffer, pH 7.4, and 0.1 m NaCl. Activation was initiated by adding an SK mutant of fixed concentration, and the change in absorbance at 405 nm was monitored at 37 °C with a Hitachi 330 spectrophotometer. The increments of absorbance between 10 and 300 s after addition of SK samples were used to measure the initial rate of HPlg activation. Initial reaction rates were determined from the slopes of plots of absorbance versus t 2, and double-reciprocal plots were then constructed. HPlg activation parameters, Kplg(the apparent Michaelis constant for the HPlg substrate) andkplg (the catalytic rate constant of activation), were calculated as described by Wohl et al. (28Wohl R.C. Summaria L. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2005-2013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ε1m at 405 nm employed forp-nitroanilide was 9559. The generation of active sites by SK mutants in HPlg was determined by active site titration using the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferylp-guanidinobenzoate (MUGB, Fluka) in a Hitachi 850 fluorescence spectrophotometer as described (9McClintock D.K.

After 2 min, native SK (100 nm) or SK mutants (100 nm) or buffer alone was added, and the increment of fluorescence was monitored at extinction wavelength 365 nm and emission wavelength 445 nm. The stock solution of MUGB (1 mm) was prepared inNN-dimethylformamide before use and was diluted to 1 μm with the titration buffer. The HPlm-free HPlg samples used in this experiment were prepared either by passing HPlg samples through an aprotinin column or by pretreatment with NPGB immediately before experiments as described previously (10Reddy K.N.N. Markus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1683-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to remove possible trace amounts of HPlm contamination. Incubations of equimolar HPlg and SK mutant proteins (final concentration, 2 μm) were carried out at 25 °C in 10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4. Aliquots were removed at various intervals to assay the amidolytic activity and also for SDS-PAGE analysis. The amidolytic activity was measured by adding aliquots of the HPlg·SK proteins (final concentration, 0.2 μm) in an assay cuvette containing 0.5 mm S-2251 in 0.05 m Tris buffer, pH 7.4, and 0.1 m NaCl. The absorbance at 405 nm was monitored between 10 and 80 s. The initial reaction rate was calculated, and the duration to achieve maximal amidolytic activity was determined as described by Chibber et al. (33Chibber B.A.K. Radek J.T. Morris J.P.

Human Glu-plasminogen (Glu-Plg) (0.5 μm) was activated by incubation with a catalytic amount of SK protein (0.005 μm) at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 mm S-2251 as a substrate. The change in absorbance at 405 nm was monitored with a Hitachi 330 spectrophotometer. For the assay of activation of HPlg by a catalytic amount of HPlm·SK complex, equimolar HPlm and SK (0.125 μm each) were premixed at 4 °C for 2 min. HPlg (0.5 μm) was activated by incubation with a catalytic amount of the preformed HPlm·SK complex (0.005 μm) at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris, 0.1m NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 mm S-2251 as a substrate. The change in absorbance at 405 nm was monitored as described. Protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of the SK fragments were determined by Edman degradation in an Applied Biosystems Sequencer (model 477A). Human μPlg and SK protein at a concentration of 5 μm were mixed at room temperature for 2 min and followed by reaction with 0.1 mmBS3 as cross-link reagent. After 60 min, the reaction was stopped by adding ethanolamine (8 mm),N-ethylmaleimide (3 mm) in sodium phosphate buffer (8 mm, pH 7.4). Parallel samples containing either μPlg or SK were used as controls. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE in 10% acrylamide according to the method of Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The electrophoresed proteins on the gel were transferred onto Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore), stained with Amido Black and Western blotting with SK antiserum (35Burnette W.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5927) Google Scholar). The relative amount of the cross-linked product was determined by scanning the Amido Black-stained protein bands by a Bio-Imaging analyzer (Fuji, Japan) with a computer program MacBAS version 2.4. Thirteen mutants of recombinant SK in which clusters of two to four charged residues and a specific single charged residue were converted to Ala were prepared using the primers shown in TableI. All the SK mutants were made with the length from residues 16 to 378 since wild-type SK (16) could activate HPlg as efficiently as the authentic SK (6Young K.C. Shi G.Y. Chang Y.F. Chang B.I.

DNA sequencing confirmed the expected nucleotide sequence changes. Homogeneous SK proteins were obtained after ammonium sulfate precipitation and high Q column chromatography. All the SK mutant proteins had the expected molecular mass of 43 kDa as analyzed by SDS-PAGE. HPlg activation assay by a catalytic amount of SK mutants was performed to determine which mutation might affect the ability of SK to form a functional HPlg activator complex with HPlg (Fig.1). Five SK mutants, SKK278A,K279A,E281A,K282A (abbreviated as SK(278–282Ala)), SKD360A,R363A (SK(360–363Ala)), SKD331A, SKK332A, and SKK334A induced rapid activation of HPlg to HPlm as efficiently as the wild-type SK-(16–378) (Fig. 1). In contrast, SKD322A,R324A,D325A(SK(322–325Ala)), SKR324A, and SKR330A,D331A,K332A,K334A (SK(330–334Ala)) did not induce measurable HPlm generation. SKD325A, SKD328A, SKD328A,R330A (SK(328–330Ala)), and SKR330Ainduced slow activation of HPlg with lag phases ranging between 2 and 4 min, whereas SKD322A induced rapid HPlg activation with a lag phase slightly longer than that of the wild-type SK-(16–378) (Fig.1). Kinetic assays revealed that the catalytic efficiencies (kplg/Kplg) for HPlg activation of complexes of HPlg with SK(278–282Ala), SK(360–363Ala), SKD331A, SKK332A, SKK334A, and SKD322A were comparable with wild-type SK-(16–378). In contrast, kplg/Kplg values of SK(328–330Ala), SKD325A, and SKR330A were 14–21-fold lower than that of wild-type SK-(16–378), whereas kplg/Kplg value of SKD328A was 5-fold lower (TableII). In complex with SK, HPlg undergoes a conformational change and become catalytically active without cleavage of the activating peptide bond, which is the so-called virgin enzyme. The rate of HPlg activation could be slowed down by lowering the reaction temperature to 25 °C, and the virgin enzyme could be observed. To determine whether these SK mutants could form a virgin enzyme in the HPlg·SK complex, the active site generation was monitored in the presence of an acylating agent MUGB that could also inhibit any trace amounts of HPlm, as originally described by McClintock and Bell (9McClintock D.K. Bell P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 43: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Wild-type SK-(16–378) could generate an active site in HPlg in a one-to-one equimolar complex at 25 °C (Fig.2 A). Native SK could generate an active site in HPlg more rapidly than wild-type SK-(16–378) (Fig.2 A). In contrast, no active site was titrated in equimolar mixtures of HPlg with SK(322–325Ala), SK(328–330Ala), SKD322A, SKD328A, and SKD330A (Fig.2 A). SKD331A, SKK332A, and SKK334A in reaction with equimolar HPlg induced rapid formation of enzyme active sites, whereas SKR324A and SKD325A showed a greater delay than wild-type SK-(16–378) in the generation of active sites (Fig. 2 A). To investigate further the interaction of HPlg and SK mutants, amidolytic activity measurement (Fig. 2 B) and SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig.2 C) were performed to characterize the reaction products of equimolar incubation of HPlg and SK in the absence of acylating agent MUGB. HPlg samples used in this experiment were prepared by either passing through an aprotinin column or pretreatment with NPGB to remove trace amounts of HPlm as described, and the HPlg sample prepared by the two methods gave the similar result on the amidolytic activity measurement. Wild-type SK-(16–378) could form an amidolytically active enzyme with HPlg in a equimolar complex at 25 °C (Fig.2 B). No cleavage of the activating peptide bond, Arg561–Val562 was observed at up to 4 min determined at interva"

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 831-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that activation of PAK by soluble factors is highly dependent on cell adhesion (12del Pozo M.A. Price L.S. Alderson N.B. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2008-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 13Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and this may contribute to the anchorage-dependence of MAPK activation (13Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Nat.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). One of these reports offers strong evidence that the lack of PAK activation in nonadherent cells is due to an uncoupling of PAK from activated Rac at the plasma membrane (12del Pozo M.A. Price L.S. Alderson N.B. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2008-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Specifically, the deficiency in PAK activation in nonadherent cells is not due to a dramatic reduction in Rac activation but correlates with a marked decrease in the recruitment of activated Rac to the cell membrane. This is particularly interesting given observations that forced localization of PAK to the plasma membrane strongly activates PAK (15Lu W. Katz S. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 16Lu W. Mayer B.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17Bokoch G.M.

One hypothesis to explain this activation is that membrane localization of PAK is likely to increase the efficiency of its interaction with other membrane-associated regulatory elements, such as activated Rac (18Symons M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R535-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and sphingolipids (17Bokoch G.M. Reilly A.M. Daniels R.H. King C.C. Olivera A. Spiegel S. Knaus U.G.

Taken together, these data strongly suggest that membrane localization is a crucial aspect of PAK activationin vivo. The recruitment of PAK to the cell membrane may be mediated by its direct interaction with the adapter protein Nck (19Bokoch G.M. Wang Y. Bohl B.P. Sells M.A. Quilliam L.A. Knaus U.G. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Nck-PAK interaction is mediated through the second SH3 domain of Nck, which binds to a proline-rich region in the N terminus of PAK (19Bokoch G.M. Wang Y. Bohl B.P. Sells M.A. Quilliam L.A.

This suggests that in unstimulated cells, PAK and Nck exist in a constitutive complex that can be rapidly relocated to membrane-associated, phosphotyrosine-rich sites generated by growth factor stimulation or adhesion to ECM. The importance of this interaction in regulating PAK function is underscored by the observations that expression of a membrane-targeted Nck SH3 domain leads to constitutive PAK activation (15Lu W. Katz S. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and that a PAK mutant unable to bind Nck is severely impaired in its ability to promote cytoskeletal organization (27Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Given the tight regulation of PAK activation by cell adhesion to ECM and the importance of Nck binding in regulating PAK activity, I investigated whether adhesion might affect PAK-Nck interaction. Herein, I show that the ability of PAK to bind Nck is highly dependent on cell adhesion and correlates with an anchorage-dependent change in PAK phosphorylation. These data have significant implications for the regulation and localization of PAK activity. Polyclonal antibodies against the N- or C terminus of PAK1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against Nck included a monoclonal from Transduction Laboratories and a polyclonal from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal antibody against the PDGF#x03B2; receptor was a generous gift from K. DeMali and A. Kazlauskas and was used as described (28DeMali K.A. Balciunaite E. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19551-19558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Phosphotyrosine was detected using monoclonal antibody 4G10 from Upstate Biotechnology. NIH3T3 cells were cultured as described previously (13Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were serum-starved overnight and then either harvested or cultured in suspension. For suspension culture, cells were trypsinized, collected by centrifugation, washed once with DMEM, 2% BSA, 2 mg/ml trysin inhibitor and once with DMEM, 2% BSA, and then resuspended and rotated in the same at 37 °C for the indicated times. Where indicated, cells were replated, after 1 h in suspension, onto FN-coated tissue culture plates (13Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) for the indicated times. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped or resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm each EDTA and EGTA, 1% Triton X-100 containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma)). Lysates were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, vortexed vigorously for 30 s, incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at ∼15,000 × g. Precleared lysates were either frozen at −80 °C or further clarified by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads (PharMingen) for 1 h at 4 °C and then used for immunoprecipitation. The lysates were incubated with antibodies for 1–2 h at 4 °C and then with protein G-coupled Sepharose beads (PharMingen) for 1 h. In most cases, complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer. For polyclonal Nck immunoprecipitations, complexes were washed once with lysis buffer and three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Tween 20. Washed complexes were boiled in 1× Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min. Samples were run on standard Bio-Rad mini-gels (10% for Nck Western blots, 7.5% for PAK and PDGFR Western blots) or on higher resolution gels contained 8% acrylamide and 0.5% bisacrylamide and were cast in 15 × 15-cm cassettes (Hoefer Scientific). Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, which were then blocked and blotted using standard techniques. PAK immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, twice with 0.05 m Tris, pH 7.0, 0.1 m NaCl, and once with buffer A (0.05 mTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.01 m magnesium chloride). Immunoconjugates were resuspended in 50 μl of buffer A alone or buffer A containing 0.5 units of calf intenstinal alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Immunoconjugates were then washed twice in buffer A and either resuspended in 1× Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min or resuspended in 50 μl of 0.02 m MES, pH 6.0, containing 0.75 units of potato acid phosphatase (Calbiochem) and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. These latter samples were then washed in buffer A and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer as described above. Cells were serum-starved overnight then labeled for 4 h with 1.0 mCi/ml32P-labeled orthophosphate in phosphate-free DMEM containing 2% BSA. For the suspension culture, the labeling medium was removed, and the cells were rapidly washed, trypsinized, collected, and resuspended in the original labeling medium and then incubated at 37 °C with rotation for 1 h. Cells were harvested, and PAK was immunoprecipitated as described above. Radiolabeled PAK was purified on SDS-PAGE gels, and individual bands were excised and subjected to in-gel trypsinization as described elsewhere (13Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptides were analyzed by two-dimensional separation on thin layer cellulose plates (13Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) or by HPLC (AP Biotechnology) on a reverse-phase C18 column (Vydac) developed with a linear gradient of aqueous acetonitrile. For some experiments, an excess of a synthetic peptide with the sequence NTSTMIGAGSK (single-letter code), corresponding to the tryptic peptide containing Ser21 of PAK1, was added to the mix of radioactive peptides before HPLC separation. Fractions were then analyzed by scintillation counting and spectrophotometry at 215 nm. The peptide was synthesized and purified by the University of North Carolina Peptide Synthesis Facility. Nck can recruit PAK to activated RTKs (e.g.PDGFR) upon growth factor stimulation, which may play a role in regulating PAK activity (20Galisteo M.L. Chernoff J. Su Y.C. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20997-21000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Given the strong anchorage dependence of PAK activation by growth factors (12del Pozo M.A. Price L.S. Alderson N.B. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2008-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 13Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), the effect of cell adhesion on recruitment of PAK to activated PDGFR was investigated (Fig.1). As previously reported (29Lin T.H. Chen Q. Howe A. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8849-8852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), PDGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFR occurred efficiently in both adherent and nonadherent NIH3T3 cells. Growth factor stimulation of adherent cells induced the formation of a complex containing tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGFR, Nck, and PAK. In nonadherent cells, Nck was still recruited to the activated PDGFR, whereas PAK was completely absent from this complex; this suggested that although the SH2-dependent recruitment of Nck to activated receptor is anchorage-independent, the SH3-mediated interaction of Nck with PAK might be regulated by cell adhesion. To directly investigate the effects of cell adhesion on PAK-Nck interaction, anti-Nck Western blots were performed on PAK immunoprecipitates from stably adherent cells and cells that had been incubated in suspension (Fig.2). Even in the absence of serum and growth factors, PAK immunoprecipitates from stably adherent cells contained readily detectable levels of Nck, consistent with previous reports (19Bokoch G.M. Wang Y. Bohl B.P. Sells M.A. Quilliam L.A. Knaus U.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25746-25749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 20Galisteo M.L. Chernoff J. Su Y.C. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20997-21000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, little or no Nck was detected in PAK immunoprecipitates from nonadherent cells (Fig. 2). The lack of PAK-Nck association was not caused by a decrease in the amount of Nck protein in nonadherent cells, as shown by Nck Western blots of adherent and nonadherent cell extracts (data not shown and Fig. 4). Interestingly, the interaction between Nck and PAK was also ablated by treatment of adherent cells with cytochalasin D (Fig. 2). It is important to point out that although the concentration of cytochalasin D used in these experiments allowed cells to remain loosely attached, it completely disrupted the actin cytoskeleton and promoted cell rounding and complete tyrosine dephosphorylation of FAK (data not shown). This indicates that in NIH3T3 cells the growth factor-independent interaction between Nck and PAK requires a fully functional cellular interaction with the ECM.Figure 4Loss of PAK-Nck interaction correlates with dephosphorylation of PAK. A, PAK was immunoprecipitated from serum-starved, stably adherent cells (Adh), cells cultured in suspension (Susp), or cells replated onto FN-coated plates (FN) for 1 h. Immunocomplexes were separated in large, high cross-linker SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against PAK and Nck. Whole cell extracts from nonadherent or replated cells were run alongside the immunoprecipitates to distinguish bands of interest (indicated byarrowheads). B, PAK was immunoprecipitated from adherent cells or cells in suspension and incubated in phosphatase buffer alone or buffer containing potato acid phosphatase (PAP) and/or calf intenstinal phosphatase (CIP) as indicated. Proteins were resolved on high cross-linker SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against PAK.C, Nck was quantitatively immunoprecipitated from stably adherent cells, and the supernatant extract (Super) from this IP was immediately reimmunoprecipitated with antibodies against PAK. These immunocomplexes were run on high cross-linker gels alongside PAK IPs from stably adherent cells (Adh) or cells in suspension (Susp) and analyzed by anti-PAK Western blotting. The position of a 64,000-Da molecular mass marker (64) is indicated. D, 32P-labeled tryptic peptides of PAK isolated from adherent cells (white bars) or cells in suspension for 1 h (shaded bars) were doped with an excess of an unlabeled, synthetic peptide comprising amino acids 19–29 of PAK1 (see “Experimental Procedures”) and separated by HPLC. Portions of the indicated fractions were analyzed by liquid scintillation counting (bars) to determine the phosphate content (in counts/minute (CPM)) or by spectrophotometry at 215 nm (dashed line; A215) to assess the presence of the synthetic peptide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further investigate this anchorage-dependent interaction, the kinetics of PAK-Nck dissociation after cellular detachment were determined (Fig.3). The amount of Nck co-precipitating with PAK dropped dramatically (∼8-fold by densitometry) within 10 min after detachment and was essentially undetectable at 30 and 60 min. Interestingly, the loss of PAK-Nck interaction after detachment was rapidly reversed by replating cells onto the ECM protein fibronectin (FN). The amount of co-precipitating Nck in cells replated on FN for 15 min was ∼90% of the level seen in stably adherent cells, whereas the level at 30 min after replating was indistinguishable from that of adherent cells (Fig. 3). The rapid kinetics of PAK-Nck dissociation and re-association suggest that the complex might be regulated by a rapidly reversible post-translational modification, such as phosphorylation. Both PAK and Nck are known phosphoproteins (1Knaus U.G. Bokoch G.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 23McCarty J.H. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, the role of phosphorylation in regulating Nck function has yet to be determined, and while many of the details of PAK phosphorylation in vitro have been elucidated, the complexity of its regulation in vivo is not completely understood, and its regulation by cell adhesion has never been investigated. Importantly, a recent report demonstrates that the association of Nck and PAK can be regulated by phosphorylation (22Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In this report, strong biochemical data indicated that phosphorylation of Ser21, a putative autophosphorylation site at the C-terminal end of the Nck-binding region of PAK1, dramatically reduced the interaction between PAK and Nck (22Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Reduced Nck binding was also observed in cells in which PAK was robustly activated and hyperphosphorylated either by mutation or expression of a constitutively active mutant of Cdc42 (22Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), suggesting a negative feedback loop in which PAK activation down-regulates interaction with Nck. Previous work has correlated PAK phosphorylation with an electrophoretic mobility shift on SDS-PAGE gels; specifically, increasing phosphorylation of PAK correlates with slower migration (22Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar,30Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This correlation was utilized to investigate whether the loss of Nck binding in nonadherent cells coincided with a change in the phosphorylation state of PAK. Previous experiments in the current report were performed using standard mini-gels, and no shift in PAK mobility was readily apparent. Therefore, to better visualize potential PAK mobility shifts, subsequent experiments utilized larger, higher cross-linking gels (see “Experimental Procedures”). Using this method, PAK isolated from adherent, serum-starved cells runs as a discrete doublet, whereas in nonadherent cells, only the faster migrating form is present (Fig.4 A). A slower migrating form of PAK reappears within an hour of replating cells on FN (Fig.4 A). As expected, this mobility shift is due to a difference in phosphorylation, as the slower migrating species present in PAK immunoprecipitates from adherent cells are almost completely converted to the faster migrating form by phosphatase treatment in vitro (Fig. 4 B). Significantly, this differential phosphorylation correlates closely with the loss of Nck binding in nonadherent cells (Fig. 4 A) and suggests that Nck binds exclusively to the more highly phosphorylated, slower migrating form of PAK. This finding was confirmed in reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments in which the PAK present in Nck immunoprecipitates co-migrated exclusively with the slower migrating form of PAK that is present in adherent cells but completely absent from nonadherent cells (Fig. 4 C). The loss of PAK-Nck interaction in nonadherent cells and its correlation with PAK dephosphorylation indicate that Nck binding is compromised under conditions in which PAK activity is very low, which is somewhat surprising in light of the recent report suggesting high levels of PAK activity are responsible for disrupting PAK·Nck complexes (22Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, that report is in stark contrast to an earlier report in which a constitutively active double-point mutant of PAK showed enhanced binding to Nck (27Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The recovery of PAK·Nck complexes from cells stimulated with growth factors and other agonists also supports the notion that Nck remains associated with activated PAK under physiological conditions (15Lu W. Katz S. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 16Lu W. Mayer B.J.

Therefore, there are some apparent contradictions regarding the role of PAK activity or autophosphorylation in regulating Nck binding in vivo. However, there is still strong in vitro evidence indicating that PAK-Nck interaction can indeed be regulated by phosphorylation near the proline-rich Nck-binding region (22Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). How might these observations be reconciled with the current data? One possible explanation is that Ser21 appears to be a relatively poor autophosphorylation site (30Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and may be modified in this way only when PAK is activated to supraphysiological levels (e.g. by an excess of constitutively active Cdc42 or Rac). It is therefore possible that phosphorylation of this site is indeed responsible for regulating Nck binding but that in vivo this modification is catalyzed by a kinase other than PAK. Results thus far suggest that such a kinase may be activated upon cellular detachment. To directly investigate the possibility that cellular detachment might affect phosphorylation of this region, phosphopeptide mapping was performed on radiolabeled PAK immunoprecipitated from32P-labeled adherent cells and cells in suspension. Separation of tryptic phosphopeptides by two-dimensional mapping or by HPLC revealed several adhesion-dependent changes in PAK phosphorylation (Fig. 4 D and data not shown). To identify specific changes in phosphorylation in and around Ser21, an excess of purified, synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 19–29 of PAK1 (the tryptic fragment containing Ser21) was added to the phosphopeptide mixtures to serve as a marker during HPLC. Although PAK from adherent cells contained several phosphopeptides not present in the nonadherent sample (Fig. 4 D, fractions 20, 29, and 30), PAK from nonadherent cells contained a phosphopeptide that co-eluted with the synthetic peptide (Fig. 4 D, fraction 26). These data suggest that cellular detachment induces phosphorylation of PAK within a region known to regulate interaction with Nck. Regulation of PAK phosphorylation in vivo is complex and not fully understood. The shift in electrophoretic mobility observed in Fig. 4 A suggests a net dephosphorylation of PAK in nonadherent cells. However, Fig. 4 D demonstrates that under these conditions PAK retains some phosphates and even acquires new modifications that are induced specifically, and perhaps uniquely, by the state of nonadherence. Considerable effort has established that PAK is a substrate for autophosphorylation (1Knaus U.G. Bokoch G.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 30Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as phosphorylation by other kinases (e.g. PDK1 (34Borisy G.G. Svitkina T.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), PKA (13Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar)). Clearly, further analysis is required to address fully the regulation of PAK phosphorylation by cell adhesion. Among the most important issues to be addressed are the complete profile of PAK phosphorylation in adherent versus nonadherent cells and the kinases or phosphatases involved in this regulation. The importance of Nck-mediated PAK localization to the membrane is likely to be 2-fold. First, relocation to the membrane places PAK in close proximity with membrane-associated activating factors, such as activated Rac (12del Pozo M.A. Price L.S. Alderson N.B. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2008-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) and sphingolipids (17Bokoch G.M. Reilly A.M. Daniels R.H. King C.C. Olivera A. Spiegel S. Knaus U.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8137-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), increasing the efficiency of their interaction and thereby the efficiency of PAK activation (18Symons M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R535-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Second, membrane localization of PAK places it in an appropriate setting to exert its effects on lamellipodia extension and cell motility, events that involve modulation of the actin cytoskeleton near the cell membrane (36). Another possibility is that by recruiting PAK to sites of active growth factor and/or cell adhesion signaling, the Nck-PAK interaction may be important in translating extracellular gradients into intracellular asymmetry and thus in establishing cell polarity (3Daniels R.H. Bokoch G.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Given the ability of PAK to regulate the actin cytoskeleton, cell motility, cytoplasmic signaling cascades, and gene expression, the regulation of PAK-Nck interaction by cell adhesion provides an intriguing new facet of regulation to this important signaling complex.

Activated platelets, monocytes, and endothelial cells present at the site of vascular injury expose anionic phospholipid (aPL;e.g. phosphatidylserine (PS)) on their membrane surface providing a site of association for FVa and the serine protease factor Xa (FXa) in the presence of Ca2+.

Human FV is secreted into plasma as a single chain glycoprotein (2196 amino acids) composed of three homologous A domains and two homologous C domains and a unique B domain arranged in the order NH2-A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2-COOH (6Kane W.H.

FVaH and FVaL are noncovalently associated in the presence of a Ca2+ (Kd = 6 × 10−9m) (8Krishnaswamy S. Russell G.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

Localization of the Ca2+-binding site has been consequently elusive. Proteolytic activation and inactivation of FV/FVa plays a central role in regulating coagulation. At the site of vascular injury, FV is activated through a series of cleavages predominantly by thrombin, at Arg-709, Arg-1018, and Arg-1545, which excises the B domain to yield FVa (7Jenny R.J. Pittman D.D. Toole J.J. Kriz R.W. Aldape R.A. Hewick R.M. Kaufman R.J. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4846-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Factor V is initially activated by FXa in an aPL and Ca2+-dependent manner (2Foster W.B. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13970-13977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FVa is also inactivated by proteolysis. The well studied anticoagulant, activated protein C (APC), inhibits FVa by cleaving FVaH (14Odegaard B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11233-11238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), leading to dissociation of the A2 domain (15Mann K.G. Hockin M.F. Begin K.J. Kalafatis M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20678-20683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The known APC-dependent cleavage of FVaL has no known function. Both FV and FVa can also be inactivated by an additional protease, the fibrinolytic protease plasmin (Pn), although inactivation of FV is preceded by a brief phase of activation (16Omar M.N.

Circulation. 1995; 91: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Work from our laboratory has suggested a further communication mechanism between coagulation and fibrinolysis where inhibition of aPL-associated FVa coagulation activity by Pn results in a species that accelerates Pn generation (25Pryzdial E.L.G. Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17871-17877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These combined observations strongly suggest that Pn participates in maintaining balance between the opposing hemostatic pathways, coagulation and fibrinolysis. To understand the anticoagulant function of Pn, the structural basis by which FVa coagulation cofactor activity is inhibited by Pn is reported in the current work. The unique fragmentation profile mediated by Pn has further enabled localization of the Ca2+-dependent contacts between FVaL and FVaH.

LV consisting of 1–4 mg of 75:25% PC/PS was suspended in 1 ml of methanol in glass tubes and dried to a thin film under a steady stream of nitrogen at 4 °C. The phospholipid was resuspended in 0.5–1 ml of 20 mm HEPES, 300 mm sucrose, pH 7.4, vortexed for 1 min, and subjected to 10 freeze-thaw cycles. The suspension was then extruded through two 1-μm filters (Avestin, Inc.) and collected. The vesicles were then mixed 1:1 with 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (HBS/Ca2+), and harvested by centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 22 °C for 5–10 min. The pellet was resuspended in HBS and quantified using an assay for total phosphorus (27Gomori G. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1942; 27: 955-960Google Scholar). Human FVa, FXa, prothrombin, plasminogen, Pn, monoclonal antibodies (mAb) specific for human FVaH (AHV-5146) and human FVaL (AHV-5112), and polyclonal sheep anti-human FV (PAHFV-S) were from Hematologic Technologies, Inc. mAb specific for FVa A3 domain (anti-FVaA3) was produced by Dr. R. Lemieux (Hema-Quebec) for which in-house recombinant FVaL produced using the baculovirus system and purified by electroelution was used as antigen. Polymerase chain reaction-screened R506Q homozygous plasma was a generous gift from Dr. M. C. Poon, University or Calgary, Canada.

FVa (0.1 μm) was incubated with Pn (0.1 μm) in the presence of SUV (250 μm) or LV (600 μm) and Ca2+ (2 mm) in HBS/Ca2+ at 22 °C.

The digests were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar), stained with Coomassie Blue, or electrotransferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF; Immobilon-P, Millipore) (29Towbin H.

The PVDF membrane was blocked at 22 °C for 1 h in milk (5%), and cleavage products of FVa were detected by Western analysis using chemiluminescence (ECL). FVa was also cleaved by Pn when bound to aPL-coated microtiter wells prepared as described previously (25Pryzdial E.L.G. Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17871-17877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) except that the wells were blocked with gelatin (5 mg/ml) in HBS/Ca2+, and 0.001% Tween 20 was included in the wash buffer. After equilibration of the FVa with the aPL-coated well in HBS/Ca2+, the wells were washed and Pn (0.1 μm) in HBS/Ca2+ was added. At selected time points, four wells were quickly washed, and bound protein was eluted with 25 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer/well and pooled, heated to 95 °C for 10 min, and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. To visualize cleavage products, gels were either stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to PVDF and detected with anti-FVaA3, anti-FVaL, anti-FVaH, or anti-human FV. To determine whether Pn-cleaved FVa fragments observed in a purified system could also be identified in a physiological setting, FVa fragmentation in a lysing clot was studied. In these experiments, pooled plasma (2.5 μl of pooled plasma) was clotted by treatment with thromboplastin (80 μg/μl) after recalcification (10 mm CaCl2). Individual reactions were incubated for various times with Pn (50 nm) or tPA (0.5 nm) at 37 °C in a 7.5-μl final volume of HBS. The reactions were stopped by SDS, run on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF, and visualized by Western blotting with anti-FVaL and anti-FVaH antibodies. To resolve better the fragments of interest a concentration of acrylamide was used that in most cases does not allow the single chain FV to enter the gel (10%). NH2-terminal sequencing of Pn-mediated FVa fragments transferred to PVDF after reducing SDS-PAGE was conducted as described (30Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Yuen S.W. Chui A.H. Wilson K.J. Yuan P.M. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 74-82PubMed Google Scholar). To sequence exclusively the FVa-derived fragments remaining bound to aPL in the presence of Ca2+ or EDTA, FVa digestions were conducted in the presence of LV, and bound fractions were separated by centrifugation prior to electrophoresis. Individual bands were excised for sequence analysis. FVa (0.1 μm) was cleaved with Pn (0.1 μm) for selected time points on aPL-coated wells as described above except that an excess amount of aprotinin (50 kallikrein-inactivation units/ml; KIU/ml) was added to inhibit residual Pn activity. aPL-bound fragments were incubated at 22 °C for 3 h in HBS/Ca2+ or in HBS with EDTA (10 mm, HBS/EDTA) to allow for dissociation of Ca2+-dependent interactions. Protein samples were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF, and visualized with anti-FVaH and anti-FVaL. To determine whether Pn remains associated with the cleaved fragments, antiserum to human Pgn (30 ng/ml) was used on identical membranes. The 30-kDa fragment and FVaH dissociation with EDTA (10 mm) was monitored electrophoretically. FVa bound to aPL-coated wells was cleaved with Pn (0.1 μm) for 1 h, and Pn proteolytic activity was inhibited with aprotinin (50 KIU/ml). Wells were washed three times, and 200 μl of HBS/EDTA (10 mm) was added for selected time points. Dissociation of FVaH due to Ca2+ chelation was monitored after SDS-PAGE by Western blotting. In a parallel set of experiments, FVa cofactor activity for thrombin generation was assessed chromogenically (0.5 μm S2238). Following the last wash, factor Xa (0.06 μm) and prothrombin (1.0 μm) in 100 μl HBS/Ca2+ were added at 22 °C for 5 min, and the change in absorbance at 405 nm was monitored using a Vmax spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). To determine whether the 30-kDa fragment of FVaH can associate with FVaL, we had to initially obtain and concentrate sufficient amounts of the 30-kDa fragment. An aPL-coated plate was coated with FVa (300 ng/well) that was then cleaved with Pn (0.1 μm). Supernatants from all the wells (19 ml) were pooled, and the mixture was concentrated by repeated cycles of centrifugation on a Biomax-10 membrane (Millipore) to ∼2 ml. To determine whether the 30-kDa fragment can associate with intact FVaL, FVaH was separated from aPL-immobilized FVaL with EDTA for 3 h at 22 °C. The 30-kDa fragment was then incubated in HBS/Ca2+ or HBS/EDTA with FVaL remaining bound to the aPL-coated well at 22 °C for 2 h and then at 37 °C for 30 min. The wells were washed, and remaining protein was eluted with sample buffer. Association of the 30-kDa fragment was evaluated with anti FVaH by Western blotting. Pooled normal plasma or R506Q homozygous plasma in HBS/EDTA was added to aPL-coated wells and was incubated for 30 min at 22 °C. The wells were washed three times with HBS/EDTA and then once with HBS/Ca2+. In one set of experiments, wells were incubated with 50 μl of HBS/PEG/Ca2+ for 5 min with gentle shaking. In another set of experiments, human FXa (5 nm) in HBS/PEG/Ca2+ was added to the wells and incubated for 5 min to preactivate the FV. The wells were then washed three times, and Pn (0.15 μm) was added in HBS/PEG/Ca2+ for various times. Following three more washes in HBS/Ca2+, FXa (1.0 nm) and prothrombin (1.0 μm) were added to the wells and incubated for 3 min. Thrombin activity was assessed chromogenically with S2238 (0.4 mm final). To identify fragments that are generated during inactivation of FVa by Pn in the presence of SUV and Ca2+, SDS-PAGE was conducted, which revealed a sequential cleavage pattern (Fig. 1). Both the 104-kDa FVaH and the 74/71-kDa doublet of FVaL were rapidly cleaved in a Pn-dependent manner within 1 h into products of ∼50, 48, 45, 40, 34, 30, 12, and 7 kDa, along with several smaller fragments that migrated close to or at the dye front. To determine whether the digestion profile was aPL-dependent, experiments were performed in the absence of aPL vesicles but in the presence of Ca2+. It was found that the rate of digestion of the light chain was accelerated in the presence of aPL, whereas the rate of digestion of the heavy chain was not altered (not shown). Aprotinin completely inhibited the cleavage of FVa by Pn. No distinction in the size of fragments generated was observed when the digestion was performed in the absence or presence of aPL, although additional cleavages were observed when the interaction between FVaL and FVaH was inhibited by chelation (not shown). To determine which fragments remained noncovalently associated with aPL in the presence of Ca2+, FVa was equilibrated with aPL-coated microtiter wells, and fragments that remained bound to the plate after digestion with Pn were washed with buffer containing Ca2+. The remaining fragments were analyzed by Western blot using an FVaH- and two FVaL-specific mAb. These data showed that the fragments of 50, 48, 43, 40, and 30 kDa were light chain-derived (Fig.2, A and B). Since the mAb in Fig. 2 B recognizes the A3 domain, the completely different fragmentation pattern suggests the commercial mAb used in Fig. 2 A has specificity for the COOH-terminal part of FVaL containing C1/C2. As shown, the 50- and 48-kDa FVaL fragments were converted to 43 and 40 kDa, and all remained bound to aPL. Since all aPL binding of FVa is mediated by FVaL, these fragments contain at least part of the Ca2+-independent membrane-binding site(s). Furthermore, we found that fragments of 50, 45, and 30 kDa were FVaH-derived and remained bound in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2 C). The 30-kDa FVaH-derived fragment also remained at least partly bound over the time course of the experiment. Comparable Ca2+-dependent complex of fragments was observed when beginning with bovine FVa (not shown). We did not observe a detectable difference in the rate of cleavage or the cleavage pattern, between experiments performed on aPL-coated plates, LV, or SUV (not shown). Furthermore, no detectable difference in the cleavage pattern was observed when the samples were electrophoresed under nonreducing conditions, indicating no disulfide-linked fragments were produced (not shown). Whereas all the aPL-bound bands, visualized by Coomassie Blue and Silver and polyclonal staining, were detected with the mAbs (not shown), an additional unbound 34-kDa fragment, released into solution upon cleavage, was observed with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 1). In order to correlate the appearance of degradation products with observed changes in FVa cofactor activity, fragments remaining bound to aPL were assayed for FVa function. Inactivation of FVa by Pn was rapid over the time course of the experiment (Fig. 2 D). Following 8 min of incubation with Pn, aPL-bound FVa was completely inactive. The rapid loss of cofactor activity coincided with appearance of the 30-kDa A3 and the 48- and minor 50-kDa C1/C2-derived fragments and with the 45- and minor 50-kDa heavy chain-derived fragments. By having established the fragment composition of purified Pn-inactivated FVa, we determined whether these fragments were also generated under more physiological conditions. Thromboplastin was added to plasma to generate a fibrin clot, and the FV/FVa fragmentation pattern was examined following either Pn- or tPA-induced clot dissolution. Western blots (Fig. 3) showed that the FVaH- and FVaL-derived fragmentation pattern was identical to those in our purified system regardless of whether Pn or tPA was used to induce clot fibrinolysis. These data support the physiological relevance of the purified system. To identify the specific sites of Pn-mediated cleavage, amino acid sequence analyses were conducted on all Coomassie Blue-stained fragments derived from purified FVa. Fig. 4 A shows the banding pattern of the fragments subjected to analysis, and the sequences are summarized in Fig. 4 B. As expected, because of recognition by a single mAb, the 65-, 50-, 45-, and 30-kDa FVaH fragments overlap, and each contains at least a large portion of the A1 domain (starting at Leu-94). The 30-kDa FVaH band was found to be two co-migrating species, which differed by 16 amino acids starting at residues Leu-94 or Met-110 and hence were referred to as 30(L94) and 30(M110). The 34-kDa fragment not detected by the mAbs corresponded to the COOH-terminal end of FVaH and, unexpectedly, contained a conserved polymorphism at residue 352 (Leu to Thr) (Fig. 4 B). This is the first report to our knowledge of this substitution, which is consistent with FVa being purified from pooled plasma. Once generated, the 34-kDa fragment was quickly proteolyzed into fragments of less than 7 kDa, of which several were sequenced. FVaL is cleaved by Pn to give 50-, 48-, 43-, and 40-kDa fragments that overlap as predicted by antigenicity and begin toward the COOH-terminal end of A3. By this method, a 30-kDa FVaL fragment corresponding to the NH2-terminal end of the light chain was distinguishable. This fragment was short lived and was processed into several smaller fragments of which two were sequenced. Since FVaH does not contain the aPL-binding site and is anchored to aPL through divalent metal ion-dependent interactions with FVaL, we investigated the effect of EDTA on the FVa fragments remaining bound to aPL. Digestion end point fragments that remained bound to aPL-coated wells after cleavage of FVa with Pn were subjected to an additional wash containing 10 mm EDTA. Interestingly, the 30-kDa component of FVaH and the 50- and 40-kDa FVaL-derived fragments dissociated from the aPL in the presence of EDTA (Fig. 5). Conversely, the FVaL 48- and 43-kDa fragments remained associated with aPL following EDTA treatment. Collectively, these data suggest that regions within the 48/43-kDa fragments of FVaL and the 30-kDa fragment of FVaH contribute to the Ca2+-dependent intramolecular association between FVaL and FVaH. It is unknown at present why apparent Ca2+-dependent differences exist between the 48/43- and 50/40-kDa fragments. To determine if the rate of EDTA-mediated dissociation of the FVaH-derived 30-kDa species from FVaL fragments is representative of dissociation of intact FVaH from intact FVaL, a time course was conducted (Fig. 6). Release of the 30-kDa species (Fig. 6 A) or FVaH (Fig. 6 B) from aPL-coated microtiter wells by EDTA was followed by Western blot. Although the general trend was comparable over the duration of the experiment, intact FVaH has an apparently faster initial phase of dissociation than the 30-kDa fragment. This may be indicative of a role for A2 in FVaL binding. As an additional means of following FVaL and FVaH dissociation, the effect of EDTA on FVa function was followed by measuring the loss of thrombin generation in a chromogenic assay (Fig.6 C). As expected, EDTA-mediated inhibition of FVa activity correlated with the dissociation of the 30-kDa fragment or intact FVaH from FVaL and are in agreement with the slow dissociation rates reported previously (8Krishnaswamy S. Russell G.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3160-3168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hibbard L.S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 638-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that the Ca2+-dependent interactions observed for FVaPn are representative of intact FVa. The dependence of Ca2+ on the association of the 30-kDa FVaH fragment to intact FVaL was studied to investigate further whether the association we observed between Pn-mediated fragments of FVa reflect those within the intact molecule. aPL-coated microtiter wells were saturated with FVa and then treated with EDTA to dissociate FVaH, which was confirmed antigenically. The 30-kDa species of FVaH was then added in the presence of Ca2+, resulting in association specifically with intact FVaL (Fig. 6 C, inset). Binding was found to be Ca2+-dependent since no detectable association was observed in the presence of EDTA. Significant Ca2+-dependent binding of the 30-kDa fragment to aPL-coated wells depended on the presence of FVaL (not shown). These data provide additional evidence that the 30-kDa fragment constitutes the FVaH-derived portion of a Ca2+-dependent contact region with FVaL. To identify by sequence analysis the species that remained bound to aPL in the presence or absence of Ca2+, LV were utilized as a preparative affinity matrix. In this experiment, aPL-bound FVa was pelleted by centrifugation after Pn treatment. As before, the 65- and 30-kDa FVaH-derived fragments and the 50-, 48-, 43-, and 40-kDa FVaL fragments were observed to remain bound to aPL in the presence of Ca2+. Of these only the 48- and 43-kDa fragments remained bound in EDTA (Fig.7 A). Sequence analyses (Fig.7 B) confirmed their identification. An unexpected observation was made concerning the co-migrating FVaH-derived 30-kDa fragments we identified in Fig. 4. After affinity fractionation, sequencing revealed that 30(L94) remained bound to aPL. In contrast, the similarly sized fragment starting at Met-110 was not observed to remain bound in the presence of Ca2+, suggesting that the 94–109-kDa region is important for the Ca2+-sensitive intrachain contact. To determine whether Pn-dependent inactivation of FV/FVa was affected by the common “Leiden” thrombophilic mutation, normal or R506Q FV was trapped from plasma on aPL-coated microtiter wells and cleaved by P"

These binary structures are characterized by ∼80°-induced bends in the DNA helical axes, in excellent accord with the solution bend angle obtained subsequently for AdMLP using FRET. However, in contrast to the bends determined using FRET, the co-crystal structures of 11 TATA sequence variants (including those examined by FRET) bound to A. thaliana TBP are all very similar, with the DNA bent ∼80° as in the strong promoters (6Nikolov D.B.

Because assembly of the transcription complex proceeds by sequential structural alterations, a clear picture of the relevant discrete structures is fundamental to an accurate understanding of these processes. The present study was therefore undertaken to further investigate the relationship between the solution and co-crystal structures of TBP·promoter complexes. Osmolytes used as crystallizing agents for TBP·TATA complexes were postulated to induce in the bound variant sequences severe bends approaching those observed in the strong promoters. End-to-end distance distributions were therefore obtained using FRET fluorometry for the reference AdMLP and three variant sequences, free and bound to S. cerevisiae TBP, in solutions containing 0–3 methylene glycol or 3.5 m glycerol. Determination of the corresponding solution bend angles revealed little change for TBP-bound AdMLP upon addition of osmolyte. In contrast, osmolytes induced profound increases in the bend angles of the transcriptionally active variant sequences, to a common angle of ∼80° but little change in the solution geometry of the transcriptionally inactive variant (T → A substitution at position 3). The conformation of the DNA within TBP·TATA complexes appears to be conserved only in the presence of osmolytes. The top strands of each DNA duplex (denoted T*14-merdpx*F) are labeled via 6-carbon linkers with 3′-fluorescein and 5′-TAMRA, constituting a FRET donor-acceptor pair.

To ensure sufficient dye mobility in the presence of osmolyte consistent with κ2 = 2/3, semi cone angles were determined as described (1Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14614-14622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) for both TAMRA and fluorescein for free and bound AdMLP in 3 m ethylene glycol. The TBP-induced bend in DNA bearing the AdMLP promoter sequence and DNA bearing an A → C substitution at position 7 (C7) and an A → T substitution at position 6 (T6) was probed using FRET fluorometry. The mean end-to-end distance for each sequence free (Rfree) and TBP-bound (Rbound) and the corresponding ς for the distance distribution in buffer, buffer plus 3 methylene glycol, and buffer plus 3.5 m glycerol are listed in Table I. The effect of osmolytes on the unbound duplexes was similar. The values of Rfree for these duplexes were within 2% for each solution condition and increased by only ∼0.8 Å in ≥3m osmolyte. The slight increases observed inRfree may be attributable to the increase in charge-charge repulsion along the DNA backbone resulting from the decrease in the dielectric constant of the solution due to osmolytes (13Dickerson R.E. Goodsell D. Kopka M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 108-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The values of ςfree for the unbound duplexes also increased in the presence of osmolyte, from 7% to 42%, the latter for the T6 variant. The breadth of the distribution derives both from the motion of the dye linkers and from relatively slow fluctuations in the duplex. Because the linkers are invariant among these oligomers, the observed increases in ςfreeare believed to reflect osmolyte-dependent increases in the deformability of the free duplexes. The determination of the relative contributions of the linker arms and the duplex DNA to ςfree is the subject of active investigation. Remarkably, osmolytes affect complexes of TBP with the three DNA sequences very differently. In the absence of osmolyte,Rbound is significantly shorter for bound AdMLP than for either variant (Table I). In contrast, in the presence of ≥3 m osmolyte, the values ofRbound determined for the C7 and T6 variants approach that of the strong parent promoter, due to the significant decreases in the end-to-end distance for both variants. Similarly, the value of ςbound for TBP-bound AdMLP is unchanged by addition of osmolyte, whereas ςbound for both variant sequences decreases significantly. Identical results were obtained for C7 in ethylene glycol and in glycerol. The implications of these changes are discussed below. Control experiments were conducted to ensure that the changes in the value of R did not derive from osmolyte-dependent changes in R0. The semi cone angles, which are a measure of the rotational wobble of the fluorophores, determined in 3 m ethylene glycol for free and TBP-bound MLdpx*F and T*MLdpx did not differ significantly from those determined in the absence of osmolyte (1Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14614-14622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), ranging from 56° to 68° with a mean value of 64° and an average error of ±7°. The fast and slow rotational correlation times for these four cases were as follows: τfast = 0.15 ± 0.03 ns, τslow,free = 5 ± 2 ns, and τslow,bound = 23 ± 2 ns, indistinguishable from those determined in the absence of ethylene glycol (1Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14614-14622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These values taken together reflect a high degree of rotational freedom in 3m ethylene glycol for both dyes for the free and TBP-bound duplexes. Because the conformations of the bound AdMLP, T6, and C7 duplexes in osmolyte-containing solutions are very similar to each other as well as to those in the corresponding co-crystals, these controls were deemed sufficient to justify using κ2 = 2/3 in all calculations of R0 for the duplexes in osmolyte. The overlap integrals determined for free AdMLP and T6 in 3m ethylene glycol were identical, withR0 = 60.9 Å. The 3′-fluorescein emission and 5′-TAMRA absorption spectra were likewise invariant for TBP-bound AdMLP and T6, with R0 = 61.1 Å. For free T6 in 0.5, 1, and 2 m ethylene glycol, R0 = 61.1, 61.0, and 61.0 Å, respectively. The corresponding values for TBP-bound T6 were 61.2, 61.2, and 61.1 Å. Because the overlap integrals were nearly sequence- and osmolyte-independent, the integral determined for free and bound T6 in 3 m ethylene glycol was used to calculate R0 values of 60.3 and 60.5 Å for free and bound C7 in 3.5 m glycerol (η = 1.3704). These results confirm that the observed changes in the values of R do not derive from osmolyte-dependent changes in dye mobility orR0. In addition, the osmolyte independence of the slow phase of the anisotropy decays, which correspond to the rotational correlation times for the TBP·DNA complex, suggests no osmolyte-induced aggregation of the protein. This conclusion is further supported by ultracentrifugation studies in 5% glycerol (14Daugherty M.A. Brenowitz M. Fried M.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4869-4880Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) that show no effect of the osmolyte on TBP aggregation and in 10% glycerol 2S. Morris and M. Brenowitz, personal communication. that show a limitedde-stabilization of TBP oligomers. Finally, the reference AdMLP sequence serves as an effective internal control. The similarity of P(R) for the AdMLP·TBP complex with and without osmolyte suggests that the large changes inP(R) observed for bound T6 and C7 do not derive from osmolyte-induced TBP aggregation. The bend angle for TBP-bound T*MLdpx*F obtained from the ratio ofRbound/Rfreeusing the bend model shown in Fig. 1 is in excellent accord with the co-crystal structure (1Wu J. Parkhurst K.M.

This model has two kinks symmetrically positioned to coincide with the phenylalanine intercalation sites observed in the co-crystal structure with the angle, α, determined according to the relationship α=2cos−1R¯bound−L2R¯free−L2Equation 1 with L2 defined as in Fig. 1. The solution bend angles corresponding to this model for the three TBP-bound duplexes in the absence and presence of osmolyte are shown in Table II. The bend for the bound AdMLP duplex is similar, ∼80°, in buffer and in osmolyte. The solution bend angles for the bound C7 and T6 variants in buffer, 52.3° and 36.9°, respectively, are much smaller than for the strong promoter sequence, in distinct contrast to the ∼80° bends observed for both variants in their co-crystals (7Patikoglou G.A. Kim J.L. Sun L. Yang S.H. Kodadek T. Burley S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3217-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). However, upon addition of osmolyte, the solution bends for both variants increase dramatically (48 and 112%, respectively), to closely resemble the ∼ 80° bend of the consensus sequence. For the T6·TBP and C7·TBP complexes, the ethylene glycol-induced change is sequence-independent and, for the C7·TBP complex, the osmolyte-induced change is osmolyte species-independent.Table IIThe solution bend angles corresponding to the model depicted in Fig. 1 for TBP-bound AdMLP, C7, and T6 in the absence and presence of osmolyte‡ Not determined.2-a The bend angle error estimates were determined by combining N independent measurements ofRfree with N independent measurements of Rbound to yieldN 2 independently determined bend angles as described (1Wu J.

To induce crystallization, co-crystals are grown in solutions of osmolytes such as ethylene glycol + glycerol + polyethylene glycol (3Kim Y. Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 512-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar) or glycerol (4Kim J.L. Nikolov D.B. Burley S.K.

The differences in geometry observed for the TBP-bound variant TATA sequences in buffered solutions and in co-crystals thus appear to be attributable to the presence of the osmolytes used in crystallization. As the bend angles for the bound variants increase in the presence of osmolyte to approach that of the consensus sequence, ςbound decreases correspondingly. These observations are consistent with our hypothesis that the observed inverse correlation between ςbound and the solution bend angle for TBP-bound sequences is attributable to increased restriction of DNA helical motion with increased complementarity of the protein-DNA interface (1Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14614-14622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Patigkoglou et al. (7Patikoglou G.A.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3217-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) reported that all attempts to crystallize TBP bound to the A3 variant were entirely unsuccessful. Because only complexes with ∼80° bends have been crystallized, we hypothesized that osmolytes would not induce the AdMLP-like structure in TBP-bound A3, the only sequence not known to occur naturally of those investigated in this and the accompanying studies. The effect of osmolytes on R for A3 was therefore estimated from a mixture containing approximately equal amounts of free and TBP-bound A3 duplex in 3 m ethylene glycol, because the affinity of TBP for A3 is too low to achieve near-saturation of the DNA. Assuming the same Ka as for buffer alone, the value of Rboundcalculated for TBP·A3 in osmolyte was 53.1 ± 0.2 Å, consistent with a bend angle of 43 ± 7°, 3The average value ofRfree for AdMLP, C7, and T6 is used in Eq. 1 rather than Rfree for unbound A3, due to the apparent inherent bend in the latter (see accompanying paper (1Wu J.

Using the observed value of Rfree for A3 yields an even smaller bend angle for bound A3. in keeping with our hypothesis. This estimate is an upper limit on the A3 bend angle, because osmolytes generally increase Ka. For instance, a 3-fold increase in Ka would give a bend angle of 36 ± 8°. The ethylene glycol concentration dependence ofR and ς for free and TBP-bound T*T6dpx*F is shown in TableIII together with the corresponding bend angles. The successive decreases in the end-to-end distance of bound T6 as osmolyte concentration increases from 0 to 3 mcorrespond to an overall 2-fold increase in the bend angle for bound T6, with 86% of the total change occurring by 2 m. The linear decrease in the breadth of the distribution as α increases is 94% complete by 2 m (Fig. 2) and further confirms the thesis that the duplex is constrained as it conforms to the protein binding site.Table IIIThe dependence of R and ς on ethylene glycol concentration for free and TBP-bound T∗T6dpx∗F together with the corresponding bend anglesKa values were first determined at each concentration of ethylene glycol using steady-state FRET as described (11Parkhurst K.M.

Open table in a new tab Ka values were first determined at each concentration of ethylene glycol using steady-state FRET as described (11Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1327-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) to ensure ≥96% saturation of the duplex in the fluorescence decay measurements. In the accompanying paper (1Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14614-14622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), a two-state model provided insight into the close relationships among TATA sequence, solution bend angle, and transcription activity. The relationship between the T6 bend angle and osmolyte concentration has been considered in the same manner. In this model, the TBP·T6 complex exists in two forms, conformerML and conformerTI (Fig. 4Ain Ref. 1Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14614-14622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The DNA in conformerML is bent ∼80° as for the consensus sequence, with the DNA in the transcriptionally inactive conformerTI much less bent. The population distributions of conformerML and conformerTI are osmolyte concentration-dependent, with the equilibrium shifting toward conformerML as osmolyte concentration increases. The probability distributions, determined for bound T6 at all five osmolyte concentrations, were analyzed globally to obtainP(R) for conformerTI,P(R)i,bound=ΦMLP(R)ML,bound+ΦTIP(R)TI,boundEquation 2 where i specifies osmolyte concentration and all else was as described (1Wu J.

The set of all five P(R) values was very well described by the two-state model, with a correlation coefficient of 0.999 for the analysis. The values obtained for the two fitted parameters wereRTI,bound = 53.1 ± 0.1 Å and ςTI,bound = 9.9 ± 0.1 Å. Bend angles corresponding to the two-state model were then calculated as described (1Wu J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 14614-14622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) at each osmolyte concentration; these angles differ from those in Table III by only 1.6 ± 0.8°. The FRET measurements yield P(R) values for these complexes that vary both with sequence (1Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14614-14622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and with osmolyte concentration. Remarkably, this two-dimensional data set is well fit in its entirety by only two parameters corresponding to the two-state model, Rbound and ςbound for conformerTI. The osmolyte concentration-dependent analysis alone yields RTI,bound = 53.1 Å and ςTI,bound = 9.9 Å, and the sequence-dependent analysis alone yieldsRTI,bound = 53.3 Å and ςTI,bound = 9.9 Å. Thus, only two conformations of the TBP·DNA binary complex are sufficient to account for boththe osmolyte concentration- and sequence-dependent solution conformations of these TBP-bound TATA sequences, as well as the sequence dependence of transcription efficiency. The free energy required to convert confomerTI to conformerML is sequence-dependent due to variations in contacts, interactions, and solvation along the minor groove/protein interfaces, and inherent ease of deformability. The osmolyte concentration dependence of the free energy required to convert conformerTI → conformerML for the TBP·T6 complex is shown in Fig. 3. For this sequence variant, conformerTI is energetically favored in the absence of osmolyte, whereas conformerML is more stable in 3 m ethylene glycol. The largest energy difference between conformerML and conformerTI, 1.32 kcal/mol, is only 0.17 kcal/mol per core base pair. The differences in the solution and co-crystal structures thus result from very small differences inΔG 0. The A3 results may also be considered within the context of the two-state model. The mole fraction of conformerML predicted to be present in a solution of TBP and A3 approaches zero at all TBP concentrations explored, assuming the Ka measured in buffer. Co-crystals would be unlikely from such a solution, because crystallization has been reported only for a conformerML-like structure. The solution and crystallographic results thus present a coherent perspective considered either directly or within the context of the two-state model. The association binding kinetics of AdMLP·TBP have been previously investigated in our laboratory using FRET stopped-flow (10Parkhurst K.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7459-7465Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 11Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1327-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Analogous initial association curves have been obtained for TBP binding to the C7 variant in 0–3 m ethylene glycol (Fig.4). In the absence of osmolyte, the TBP association kinetics are remarkably dependent on the C7 substitution in the canonical sequence (compare the uppermost, C7, and lowest, AdMLP, curves in Fig. 4). In the presence of osmolyte, however, the kinetic trace for TBP binding to C7 changes dramatically to approach that of AdMLP. The trace for the reference AdMLP sequence is nearly unchanged in the presence and absence of osmolyte. 4R. M. Powell, unpublished data. The sequential changes in binding as osmolyte concentration is increased appear to correspond to the osmolyte-induced changes in the solution conformation of the TBP·C7 complexes. A detailed analysis of the kinetics of TBP binding the C7 variant is in progress and will be published elsewhere. Such strong coupling between structure and function for the TBP·TATA complex further validates the central role of the conformation of this binary complex in the process of transcription. This work establishes the osmolyte dependence of the DNA bend angles in transcriptionally active variant DNA·TBP complexes. The large body of work to date investigating the TBP·DNA binary complex, multiprotein transcription complexes, and transcription efficiency has been done using a wide range of osmolyte species and concentrations. The interpretation of these collective results is complicated by recognition of the effects of osmolytes on the TBP·DNA conformation. This complexity is particularly apparent in light of the very small energetic differences we have found between the two putative conformers for a given sequence, because the effects of binding of other proteins on the TBP·DNA conformation in osmolyte is not known. The sequence-dependent differences in association binding suggest that TBP·DNA kinetics may also play a significant role in ultimately determining transcription activity. We have suggested that a stable intermediate conformer in the TBP·DNA binding pathway may be the binary complex to which subsequent proteins bind (11Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1327-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Transcription efficiency would then depend on both the solution conformation and the concentration time profile of the intermediate species."
https://openalex.org/W2025046505,"Insect acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme whose catalytic site is located at the bottom of a gorge-like structure, hydrolyzes its substrate over a wide range of concentrations (from 2 μm to 300 mm). AChE is activated at low substrate concentrations and inhibited at high substrate concentrations. Several rival kinetic models have been developed to try to describe and explain this behavior. One of these models assumes that activation at low substrate concentrations partly results from an acceleration of deacetylation of the acetylated enzyme. To test this hypothesis, we used a monomethylcarbamoylated enzyme, which is considered equivalent to the acylated form of the enzyme and a non-hydrolyzable substrate analog, 4-oxo-N,N,N-trimethylpentanaminium iodide. It appears that this substrate analog increases the decarbamoylation rate by a factor of 2.2, suggesting that the substrate molecule bound at the activation site (Kd = 130 ± 47 μm) accelerates deacetylation. These two kinetic parameters are consistent with our analysis of the hydrolysis of the substrate. The location of the active site was investigated byin vitro mutagenesis. We found that this site is located at the rim of the active site gorge. Thus, substrate positioning at the rim of the gorge slows down the entrance of another substrate molecule into the active site gorge (Marcel, V., Estrada-Mondaca, S., Magné, F., Stojan, J., Klaébé, A., and Fournier, D.

Cabib E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1956; 78: 202-207Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This very efficient catalysis shows an acetylcholine hydrolysis rate close to the diffusion-controlled limit (2Quinn D.M. Chem. Rev. 1987; 87: 955-979Crossref Scopus (955) Google Scholar). The process takes place at the acylation site located at the bottom of a long narrow active site gorge. This site includes a tryptophan (Trp-84 using the numbering of the Torpedo enzyme) that interacts with the trimethylammonium group of acetylcholine and a serine (Ser-200) that is acylated and deacylated (hydrolyzed) during substrate turnover (3Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman A. Toker L. Silman I. Science. 1991; 253: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar). Another substrate binding site, located at the mouth of the active site gorge, has been discovered. This site is non-productive and is thought to be the initial binding site for substrate on the ChE catalytic pathway (4Masson P. Legrand P. Bartels C.F. Froment M-T. Schopfer L.M. Lockridge O.

This binding decreases association and dissociation substrate rate constants at the acylation site and blocks product release (5Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Thomas P.J. Rosenberry T.L.

Analysis of substrate hydrolysis at different concentrations reveals that insect cholinesterases display activation at low substrate concentrations similar to vertebrate BuChE and inhibition at high substrate concentrations similar to vertebrate AChE (7Marcel V. Gagnoux-Palacios L. Pertuy C. Masson P. Fournier D. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Analysis of product-substrate curves and the effects of a competitive inhibitor of activation led to the hypothesis that substrate binding at the peripheral site accounts for apparent activation by affecting the entrance rate constant of a second molecule to the catalytic site (8Stojan J.

Although apparent activation may be explained by steric hindrance at the mouth of the gorge, it cannot be excluded that another mechanism participates in the activation.

Acta. 1979; 567: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar): the modulation of the deacylation rate constant follows the binding of an additional substrate molecule to the acyl-enzyme intermediate.

Hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine iodide was followed spectrophotometrically at 412 nm using the method of Ellmanet al. (17Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres V. Feathersone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21721) Google Scholar) at substrate concentrations from 2 μm to 300 mm. Active site titration was carried out using 7-(methylethoxyphosphinyloxy)-1-methyl-quinolinium iodide. Enzyme was incubated with carbaryl in 25 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7, 1 mg ml−1 BSA until more than 95% of the enzyme was inhibited. The mixture was loaded onto a gel filtration column (P10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7, 1 mg ml−1 BSA. Enzyme fractions were collected. The decarbamoylation rate was followed with time at 25 °C for 9 h by sampling aliquots of the reaction mixture and by estimating free enzyme concentration spectrophotometrically through its activity with 1 mm ATCh. The reaction can be described by a simple first-order rate equation. The decarbamoylation rate constant observed (kr obs) was calculated by non-linear regression analysis using the equation, [E]t=[Ec]01−ekrcost+[E]0Equation 1 where [E]t represents the free enzyme concentration at time t, [E]0 the initial concentration of free enzyme, and [Ec]0 the initial concentration of monomethylcarbamoylated enzyme. Data were analyzed by multiple non-linear regression using a non-linear global optimization method based on simulated annealing. 2J. Czaplicki, V. Marcel, and D. Fournier, manuscript in preparation. The study of the effect of potential deacetylation accelerators on acetyl-enzyme was not possible because the deacetylation rate was too rapid. To slow down this step, we used an analog of acetyl-enzyme, the carbamoyl-enzyme. The decarbamoylation rate constant of the wild-type enzyme (0.79 × 10−4s−1) is about 106-fold slower than that of deacetylation. To test if the substrate molecule accelerates decarbamoylation of the enzyme, we first used acetylcholine and acetylthiocholine. However, because some free enzyme always remains in solution, substrate hydrolysis occurs releasing choline or thiocholine molecules into the solution. These latter molecules accelerate decarbamoylation (18Kitz R.J. Braswell L.M. Ginsburg S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1970; 6: 108-121PubMed Google Scholar) by transcarbamoylation because AChE is able to catalyze transesterification (19Wilson I.B. Bergmann F. Nachmansohn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1950; 186: 781-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hellenbrand K. Krupka R.M. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4665-4672Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). With the Drosophila enzyme, acceleration of decarbamoylation by choline and thiocholine at 1 mm was 4.7 and 140-fold, respectively. Consequently, it was impossible to separate the potential acceleration caused by the substrate molecule from that caused by choline or thiocholine. Thus to analyze acceleration of decarbamoylation by a substrate molecule, we synthesized a substrate analog, 4-oxo-N,N,N-trimethylpentanaminium iodide, which cannot be hydrolyzed (Fig.1). We checked that this molecule is indeed a competitive inhibitor of the substrate ATCh (data not shown). The decarbamoylation rate was determined in the presence of various concentrations of substrate analog from 10–500 μm (Fig.2). Considering only the decarbamoylation step and one non-productive binding site, the data were analyzed according to Scheme FS1, where Ec represents the monomethylcarbamoylated AChE; E, the decarbamoylated AChE; S, the substrate analog; SEc the substrate analog molecule bound on the peripheral site; kr, the decarbamoylation rate constant; a, the coefficient of acceleration or deceleration; and Kd, the dissociation constant of the substrate analog for the peripheral site.krobs=kr·(Kd+a·[S])Kd+[S]Equation 2 The fit of data using Equation 2, which is derived from Scheme FS1, gave the following results: the decarbamoylation rate constantkr was estimated to be 79 ± 4 × 10−6 s−1; the substrate analog activates decarbamoylation with a coefficient of acceleration aestimated at 2.2 ± 0.1; and the dissociation constantKd was estimated to be 130 ± 47 μm.Figure FS1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We investigated the effect of several ligands on the decarbamoylation rate of monomethylcarbamoylated Drosophila AChE: Triton X-100, propidium, edrophonium, CHAPS, tetramethylammonium, and decamethonium. The results are presented in Table I. The fit of data was achieved with Equation 2, previously used for the substrate analog. All ligands tested showed a significant effect on the decarbamoylation rate of the enzyme, where a decrease or increase was observed. This effect has already been reported by Roufogalis and Thomas (21Roufogalis B.D. Thomas J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1969; 5: 286-293PubMed Google Scholar) who described the acceleration of decarbamoylation by tetramethylammonium using bovine erythrocyte AChE. However the effect of ligand binding varies depending on the enzyme species, because a deceleration by tetramethylammonium using Drosophila AChE was observed (Table I). Effects were small for monovalent cations; the strongest activation having a factor of 3 and the greatest inhibition a factor of 1.6. This suggests that ligand binding to the rim or the bottom of the gorge has a limited effect on deacylation.Table IEffect of various ligands on the decarbamoylation rateLigandKdaPropidium92 × 10−9 m (±36)2.5 (±0.26)Triton X-10047 × 10−3 g/l (±29)2.28 (±0.29)Edrophonium4.7 × 10−6 m (±1.9)3 (±0.3)CHAPS53 × 10−6 m (±20)0.63 (±0.03)Tetramethylammonium2.8 × 10−3 m (±0.8)0.62 (±0.03)Decamethonium1.23 × 10−6 m (±0.17)7 (±1.3)Substrate analog130 × 10−6 m (±47)2.2 (±0.1) Open table in a new tab Furthermore, this experiment allowed us to determine the affinity of each ligand for the carbamoylated enzyme (Table I), which we compared with its affinity for the free enzyme that we had previously estimated (9Marcel V. Estrada-Mondaca S. Magné F. Stojan J. Klaébé A. Fournier D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11603-11609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The affinity of edrophonium for the free enzyme (Kd = 0.84 μm) was higher than for the carbamoyl form (Kd = 4.7 μm). This could be explained by the fact that acetylation should change the edrophonium binding site located at the bottom of the active site gorge, at the catalytic site (22Harel M. Schalk I. Ehret-Sabatier L. Bouet F. Goeldner M. Hirth C. Axelsen P.H. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9031-9035Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). By contrast, the affinity of propidium was not significantly different for the free enzyme (Kd = 119 nm) and for the carbamoyl form (Kd = 92 nm). This is in accordance with the observation of Taylor and Lappi (23Taylor P. Lappi S. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1989-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) who reported that the affinity of propidium is not affected by methanesulfonylation ofTorpedo californica AChE. The affinity of Triton X-100 for the free enzyme and for the carbamoyl form was also not significantly different: Kd = 0.052 g/liter andKd = 0.047 g/liter, respectively. Thus, binding of a ligand at the rim of the active site gorge does not seem to be affected by acetylation. We previously used a simple model to describe the kinetic pathway of Drosophila AChE activity as a function of substrate concentrations (8Stojan J. Marcel V. Estrada-Mondaca S. Klaebe A. Masson P. Fournier D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), AChE being activated at low substrate concentrations and inhibited at high substrate concentrations. This model indicated that activation of substrate hydrolysis at low substrate concentrations could be explained by the binding of a substrate molecule at the peripheral non-productive site, located at the rim of the active site gorge, which affects the entrance of another substrate molecule into the active site gorge (9Marcel V. Estrada-Mondaca S. Magné F. Stojan J. Klaébé A. Fournier D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11603-11609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, in this model, an increase of the deacylation rate as a possible additional explanation of the activation phenomenon was not considered. Because activation of Drosophila AChE results in part from an acceleration of the deacetylation (Fig. 2), we had to change our previous kinetic model. Moreover, a previous model hypothesized that the affinity of the activation site for the substrate molecule decreases when the enzyme is acetylated. As carbamoylation did not affect the affinity of ligands that bind at the rim of the gorge such as propidium and Triton X-100 (Table I and Ref. 9Marcel V. Estrada-Mondaca S. Magné F. Stojan J. Klaébé A. Fournier D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11603-11609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we could hypothesize that acetylation does not affect the binding of a substrate molecule at the rim of the gorge. Consequently, the same parameterKs1 (the affinity of the substrate molecule for the peripheral binding site involved in activation) could be applied to the free enzyme and the acetylated form. Taking into account that inhibition of substrate hydrolysis occurs for high substrate concentrations (above 1 mm), we propose here a new model, which considers the existence of two different non-productive sites, where substrate molecules (S1 and S2) bind but are not hydrolyzed (Scheme FS2). In this way, both activation of the enzyme activity at low substrate concentrations and its inhibition at higher substrate concentrations could be explained. Binding of S1 would result in substrate hydrolysis activation and binding of S2 would result in substrate hydrolysis inhibition. In SchemeFS2, E represents the AChE; EA, the acetyl enzyme; S1, the substrate molecule responsible for activation; S2, the substrate molecule responsible for inhibition; a, the coefficient of acceleration; b, the coefficient of inhibition of the deacylation rate constant; c, the effect of peripheral activation site occupation on the entrance of a new molecule inside the gorge; and d, the effect of peripheral inhibition site occupation on the entrance of a new molecule inside the gorge. ki represents the bimolecular rate constant for acylation and kcat the rate constant for deacylation. Ks1 andKs2 represent the dissociation constants of S1 and S2 for the peripheral activation site and the peripheral inhibition site, respectively. Free substrate molecules and reaction products are not represented for clarity of the scheme. The rate of ATCh hydrolysis was measured versus substrate concentration, and data were fitted using Equation 3, which was derived from Scheme FS2 (Fig. 3, Equation 3). But the fitting yielded a poor estimation of the numerous kinetic parameters. To be able to fit data accurately, we fixed two parameters, Ks1 and a, previously estimated by the effect of the substrate analog on the decarbamoylation rate. Parameter d was not necessary to fit data. It represents the effect of occupation of the inhibition site on the entrance of a new substrate molecule. To simplify, we can hypothesize that peripheral inhibition site occupation completely blocks the entrance of a new molecule inside the gorge (d = 0). Accordingly, Scheme FS2 can be simplified into SchemeFS3.Figure FS2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure FS3View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The data of the rate of ATCh hydrolysis versus substrate concentration were fitted using Equation 4, which was derived from Scheme FS3 (Fig. 4, Equation 4), after having fixed two parameters obtained by studying the effect of the substrate analog on the decarbamoylation rate of AChE. The activation coefficient of the deacetylation rate constant (a) was fixed at 2.2 and the dissociation constant of S1 (Ks1) for the peripheral activation site was fixed at 130 μm (Table I). The fit was obtained with 0.996 as the global correlation coefficient and 5.2% as the average relative deviation per point (Fig.5).Figure 5Product-substrate curves for acetylthiocholine ( ATCh ) hydrolysis by wild-typeDrosophila AChE. The curve was drawn by fitting experimental data using Equation 4 (Scheme FS3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To locate the amino acids involved in the binding of substrate analogs and in signal transmission, several enzymes with a mutation on residues lining the active site gorge were used (Table II, Fig.6). The effect of the substrate analog on the decarbamoylation rate of mutated enzymes was studied from a concentration of 1 μm to 1 mm substrate analog. Several mutations induced a decrease in acceleration, which was in some cases no longer detectable. This could be interpreted either by a decrease in the affinity of the activation site for the substrate analog (Kd >1 mm) or by the absence of the effect of substrate analog binding on the activation site on decarbamoylation rate (a is not significantly different from 1). For only one mutant, Y374A, the binding of the substrate analog induced a decrease in the decarbamoylation rate (a <1).Table IIRegulation of the decarbamoylation rate of mutated enzyme by the substrate analogEnzymeDecarbamoylationkr 10−6s−1AccelerationKd(μm)aWT79 ± 4130 ± 472.2 ± 0.1E69W (70)164 ± 9Nd 2-aNd, not detected.E69K (70)108 ± 3NdE69L (70)113 ± 4NdR70V (71)79 ± 8209 ± 1821.6 ± 0.2Y71K (72)207 ± 7NdY71D (72)155 ± 14NdY73A (74)112 ± 6NdY73Q (74)130 ± 774 ± 631.4 ± 0.1F77S (78)92 ± 1269 ± 371.9 ± 0.3W83A (84)84 ± 5NdI161W (129)77 ± 589 ± 641.5 ± 0.12V182L (150)72 ± 12513 ± 4682 ± 0.4E237Q (199)30 ± 0.6110 ± 311.4 ± 0.03G265A (227)132 ± 6.3243 ± 662.2 ± 0.13V318D (276)48 ± 2.8103 ± 421.8 ± 0.1W321L (279)141 ± 12NdY324A (284)122 ± 331 ± 141.5 ± 0.1L328F (288)57 ± 7106 ± 751.8 ± 0.2F368S (290)53 ± 3302 ± 683.3 ± 0.3G368A (328)76 ± 16110 ± 842.3 ± 0.4Y370A (330)126 ± 61NdF371G (331)34 ± 3681 ± 3463.8 ± 0.6Y374A (334)98 ± 7103 ± 1020.44 ± 0.13D375G (335)225 ± 18Nd2-a Nd, not detected. Open table in a new tab Data from ATCh hydrolysis versus substrate concentration can be analyzed considering the existence of three sites: a productive site where binding of substrate molecule triggers its hydrolysis, and two distinct non-productive sites, one responsible for the activation and the other for the inhibition of ATCh hydrolysis by Drosophila AChE. The productive site, also called the catalytic site, is located at the bottom of the gorge with Trp-83(84) as a key component interacting with the quaternary ammonium moiety of choline (24Weise C.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12074-12084Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Some ligands such as edrophonium and N-methylacridinium are specific for this site (22Harel M. Schalk I. Ehret-Sabatier L. Bouet F. Goeldner M. Hirth C. Axelsen P.H. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9031-9035Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 27Mooser G.

A non-productive site, also called a peripheral binding site, was first proposed from steady-state kinetic inhibition with various ligands (28Changeux J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1966; 2: 369-392PubMed Google Scholar). It has been implicated by equilibrium dialysis experiments (29Changeux J.P. Leuzinger W. Huguet M. FEBS Lett. 1968; 2: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), by direct fluorescence (23Taylor P. Lappi S.

Cell. 1995; 83: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) have shown that this peripheral site is located at the rim of the active site gorge and that Trp-321(279) was a key component. A multiplicity of subsites, designated as P1 through P4 by Rosenberry (34Rosenberry T.L. Adv. Enzymol. 1975; 43: 103-218PubMed Google Scholar), has been implicated on the basis of inhibition kinetics (35Roufogalis B.D. Quist E.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1972; 8: 41-49PubMed Google Scholar, 36Zorko M. Pavlic M.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 2287-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The existence of these subsites were confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis, which showed that each inhibitor binds in a distinct manner (32Barak D. Kronman C. Ordenlich A. Ariel N. Bromberg A. Marcus D. Lazar A. Velan B. Shafferman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 264: 6296-6305Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The presence of several ligand peripheral sites is consistent with the presence of two non-productive substrate binding sites, one responsible for the activation and the other for the inhibition of ATCh hydrolysis byDrosophila AChE. The rate of ATCh hydrolysis was measured versus substrate concentration. Fig. 4 shows the goodness of the fit (0.996 as global correlation coefficient and 5.2% as average relative deviation per point), allowing us to consider Scheme FS3 as a good model for the kinetic pathway ofDrosophila AChE activity. Thus we could interpret the regulation of AChE activity as the binding of substrate molecules at two non-productive sites, one being responsible for activation and one for inhibition. However, it remains to be elucidated if these two sites are independent or overlap, i.e. binding of the substrate responsible for inhibition depends on the occupation of the activation site or not. If they are dependent there are two possibilities: either the substrate molecule responsible for inhibition binds only to acetylated enzyme and the ternary complex (S1S2E) does not form, or the substrate binds only to the S1EA complex and the S2EA complex does not occur. These two possibilities were tested. Product-substrate data did not fit the equations derived from these two simplified models, suggesting that the two sites are independent. The deacetylation rate constant was estimated to be 464 s−1. By taking into account the acceleration of the deacetylation rate constant of 2.2 (Table I), we calculated a turnover number of 1020 s−1, as illustrated in Fig. 2 and which is similar to another estimation made for Drosophila AChE turnover, 1783 s−1 (37Gnagey A.L. Forte M. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13290-13298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Scheme FS3, the affinity of the substrate molecule for the peripheral binding site involved in the activation is considered to be the same for the free enzyme (E) and the acetylated form (EA). This is consistent with the observation of inhibitors binding at a peripheral site that is not modified by the carbamoylation of the enzyme. In contrast, this is contradictory to an hypothesis of our previous model, where catalytic site occupation lowers the affinity of the substrate for the peripheral site. To locate potential sites involved in the acceleration of the deacetylation rate, we studied the effect of the binding of different ligands and the effect of a single mutation on the decarbamoylation rate. Binding of all the ligands tested affected the decarbamoylation rate. Edrophonium, which binds to the catalytic site (22Harel M. Schalk I. Ehret-Sabatier L. Bouet F. Goeldner M. Hirth C. Axelsen P.H. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9031-9035Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar), increased the decarbamoylation rate. Propidium also increased the decarbamoylation rate, binding to the rim of the gorge on Trp-321(279) in vertebrates (25Shafferman A. Velan B. Ordenlich A. Kronman C. Grosfeld H. Leitner M. Flashner Y.

A. 1992; 89: 10827-10831Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), similar toDrosophila, because the dissociation constant of propidium (8 nm for the wild-type AChE) increases to 12 μm for the W321L mutant. 3D. Fournier, unpublished results. Triton X-100 increased the decarbamoylation rate, binding at the rim of the gorge at a site distinct from the propidium binding site with Glu-69(70) as the main residue involved in its binding (9Marcel V. Estrada-Mondaca S. Magné F. Stojan J. Klaébé A. Fournier D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11603-11609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). CHAPS, a non-competitive inhibitor (39Tornel P.L. Munoz-Delgado E. Vidal C.J. Bioorganic Chem. 1991; 19: 1-9Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), decreased the decarbamoylation rate. Taking into account its size, it probably also binds to the rim of the gorge. Decamethonium accelerated decarbamoylation; this bis-quaternary ammonium ligand bridges catalytic and peripheral sites (22Harel M. Schalk I. Ehret-Sabatier L. Bouet F. Goeldner M. Hirth C. Axelsen P.H. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9031-9035Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Tetramethylammonium decreased the decarbamoylation rate, and this small quaternary ligand binds to peripheral and catalytic sites (40Stojan J. Marcel V. Fournier D. Chem. Biol. Inter. 1999; 119–120: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Thus, the binding of ligands to the catalytic site or to a peripheral site affects the decarbamoylation rate, where acceleration or deceleration was observed. Studies using mutated enzymes led to the same result: several mutations affect the decarbamoylation rate. Mutated residues that affect the decarbamoylation rate can be located anywhere in the gorge from the rim to the bottom, i.e. the decarbamoylation rate can be modified by mutations anywhere in the active site gorge. For example, F330S, a mutation located in the acyl pocket, E237Q located at the bottom of the gorge, F371G located at the middle of the gorge, and V318D located at the rim of the gorge decreased the decarbamoylation rate constant (kr, Table II). The acceleration in decarbamoylation rate by substrate analog was consistent with the existence of only one substrate activation site. This substrate activation site has been recently located at the rim of the gorge with Glu-69(70) as the main component, using an inhibitor competitive with activation (Triton X-100; Ref. 9Marcel V. Estrada-Mondaca S. Magné F. Stojan J. Klaébé A. Fournier D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11603-11609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This location is consistent with mutational effects because the three mutations located at position 69 completely abolished activation of the decarbamoylation rate by the substrate analog. However, other mutations also suppressed activation by the substrate analog. We can assume that they are involved in signal transmission because they are located between the rim and the bottom of the gorge. This result consolidates two hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the activation of hydrolysis by substrate molecules in human BuChE. In the first hypothesis, a substrate molecule binds to the acyl-enzyme and accelerates deacylation (10Eriksson H. Augustinsson K-B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 567: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 41Cauet G. Friboulet A. Thomas D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1987; 65: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the second, binding of a substrate molecule at the rim of the gorge allosterically regulates the catalytic activity through a conformational change (42Ordentlich A. Barak D. Kronman C. Ariel N. Segal Y. Velan B. Shafferman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 270: 2082-2091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (110) Google Scholar,43Barak D. Ordentlich A. Bromberg A. Kronman C. Marcus D. Lazar A. Ariel N. Velan B. Shafferman A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15444-15452Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Results obtained for activation in insect AChE show that these two hypotheses are not exclusive; binding of a substrate molecule at the rim of the gorge accelerates deacylation (Table I). Several reports suggest that peripheral sites are allosteric and affect the reactivity of the esterase site. Specific inhibitors for some peripheral sites enhance the decarbamoylation rate of the carbamoylated enzyme or dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated enzyme (18Kitz R.J. Braswell L.M. Ginsburg S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1970; 6: 108-121PubMed Google Scholar, 44Crone H.D. J. Neurochem. 1973; 20: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 45Tomlinson G. Mutus B. McLennan I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1980; 18: 33-39PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we confirm these results because Triton X-100 and propidium that bind to the rim of the gorge increased the rate of decarbamoylation, which takes place at the bottom of the gorge. This allostery was also implicated by the effect of mutations at the rim of the gorge. Mutations at the peripheral site, Asp-70(72) in human BuChE, have been shown to be involved in activation by the substrate (4Masson P. Legrand P. Bartels C.F. Froment M-T. Schopfer L.M. Lockridge O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2266-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 46Masson P. Froment M-T. Bartels C. Lockridge O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 36-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and in dealkylation of the phosphoryl enzyme (47Masson P. Froment M-T. Bartels C.F. Lockridge O. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Results obtained with the Drosophila enzyme are in accordance because mutations located at the entrance of the gorge (at positions 69(70), 71(72), 321(279), or 375(335)) cancelled the activation of decarbamoylation, showing allostery between the rim of the gorge and its bottom. The question arising now is how the information is transmitted from the rim to the bottom of the gorge. Several non-exclusive hypotheses can be put forward. (i) The information is transmitted via the backbone; the binding of the substrate to the rim of the gorge changes or stabilizes a loop conformation more favorable for deacetylation. (ii) The information is transmitted by the substrate molecule; the binding at the rim of the gorge orients the molecule favorably, which then slides down and increases the decarbamoylation rate at the bottom, and (iii) the information is transmitted via motions of the side chains of amino acids lining the gorge and of water molecules. The first hypothesis involves the movement of a flexible loop (Ω-loop) from Cys-66(65) to Cys-93(94) (47Masson P. Froment M-T. Bartels C.F. Lockridge O. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that mutation of several residues located on the ω-loop affects the acceleration of decarbamoylation by substrate binding at the peripheral site (Table II). However, mutations of some residues, such as Tyr-370 or Tyr-374, also have an important effect. As these residues are not located on the loop, according to this hypothesis, their mutation would affect the conformation of the ω-loop. The second hypothesis involves a shift of the substrate molecule that first binds at the rim, slides down the gorge, and then increases deacetylation. This hypothesis agrees with the normal path of the substrate molecule. However, inhibitor effects do not support this because all inhibitors have a significant effect on decarbamoylation rate. Some of them such as propidium or CHAPS are too cumbersome to enter the gorge and most probably remain at the rim. The third hypothesis involves side chains of the amino acids paving the gorge. Sussman et al. (3Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman A. Toker L. Silman I. Science. 1991; 253: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar) showed that the active site gorge is lined by connected aromatic residues. Information could be transmitted by changes in stacking arrangement or by gear effect. Certain interactions between aromatic residues have been hypothesized and some demonstrated. Shafferman et al. (25Shafferman A. Velan B. Ordenlich A. Kronman C. Grosfeld H. Leitner M. Flashner Y. Cohen S. Barak D. Ariel N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3561-3568Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) assumed that tyrosine (334) interacts with phenylalanine (330), which may reduce the deacylation efficiency of the acyl-enzyme complex. Tyrosine 374(334) has been shown to interact with tyrosine 71(72) in theTorpedo enzyme (3Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman A. Toker L. Silman I. Science. 1991; 253: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar) and in the Drosophila enzyme (48Harel M. Kryger G. Rosenberry T.L. Mallender W.D. Lewis T. Fletcher R.J. Guss J.M. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The efficiency of deacetylation is dependent on the position of a water molecule. The location of water molecules inside the site depends on the arrangement of the amino acid side chains lining the active site gorge and on the position of the loops structure forming the gorge wall. When a molecule binds somewhere in the active site gorge, the arrangement of water molecules is modified (49Koellner G. Kryger G. Millard C.B. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Steiner T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 713-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) resulting in a change of deacetylation rate. In this way, the binding of a substrate molecule at the peripheral site would accelerate or decelerate deacylation if the water molecule involved in the hydrolysis is closer or further from the acetyl-serine in the new arrangement. The fact that a large number of mutations affects the acceleration of decarbamoylation by the substrate supports this last hypothesis and suggests that the information is transmitted through the motions of the network of side chains lining the gorge and by water molecules. The binding of a substrate molecule at the rim of the gorge seems to have several effects. It changes the probability of a substrate molecule entering the active site gorge (9Marcel V. Estrada-Mondaca S. Magné F. Stojan J. Klaébé A. Fournier D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11603-11609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); it may correctly orient positively charged substrates to slide down to the bottom of the gorge (4Masson P. Legrand P. Bartels C.F. Froment M-T. Schopfer L.M. Lockridge O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2266-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar); it may affect the entrance of another substrate molecule inside the site (9Marcel V. Estrada-Mondaca S. Magné F. Stojan J. Klaébé A. Fournier D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11603-11609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); and it may increase deacylation of the serine (this study) and therefore clean up the active site gorge before the entrance of a new substrate molecule. Thus, the activation site seems to be a regulator of the traffic between substrate molecules that enter the gorge and product molecules that exit the gorge."

We found that purified dHDAC1 and Gal4-dHDAC1 polypeptides possess substantial deacetylase activity. Thus, deacetylation by dHDAC1 does not require any additional cofactors. Gal4-dHDAC1, but not dHDAC1, was observed to repress transcription in vitro by about 2–3-fold from chromatin templates, but not from naked DNA templates, in a Gal4 site-dependent manner. This magnitude of repression is similar to that commonly seen by deacetylases in vivo, as assessed by treatment of cells with deacetylase inhibitors. Transcriptional repression by Gal4-dHDAC1 was blocked by the deacetylase inhibitor, FR901228, and thus, deacetylase activity correlates with repression. Single round transcription analyses showed that Gal4-dHDAC1 reduces the absolute number of productive initiation complexes with chromatin templates. Moreover, with chromatin templates that were assembled with completely purified components, Gal4-dHDAC1 was found to deacetylate nucleosomal histones as well as to repress transcription. These experiments provide biochemical evidence for the requirement of chromatin for transcriptional repression by dHDAC1 and further show that dHDAC1 acts to repress the transcription initiation process.

The precise control of gene transcription is essential for the proper growth and development of an organism. In eukaryotes, there are thousands of proteins that participate in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. These factors include sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that interact with enhancer and silencer elements, the RNA polymerase II transcriptional machinery, chromatin remodeling factors, and enzymes that covalently modify histones and other proteins such as transcription factors (for reviews, see Refs. 1Brown C.E.

There has recently been considerable effort devoted to the effects of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) 1The abbreviations used are:HAThistone acetyltransferaseHDAChistone deacetylasedHDAC1Drosophila histone deacetylase 1NF-κBnuclear factor κBp65NF-κB p65 proteinTSAtrichostatin AHIVhuman immunodeficiency virusNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acid as well as histone deacetylases (HDACs) upon transcriptional activity. In general, the acetylation of core histones correlates with transcriptional activation, whereas the deacetylation of core histones correlates with transcriptional repression. The importance of HATs and HDACs in the control of gene expression is well established, but the basic molecular mechanisms by which they act are a subject of current investigation. For instance, HATs can acetylate a variety of proteins other than core histones, and thus, it will be important to determine the importance of the acetylation of histones as well as nonhistone proteins. histone acetyltransferase histone deacetylase Drosophila histone deacetylase 1 nuclear factor κB NF-κB p65 protein trichostatin A human immunodeficiency virus nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Transcriptional studies of HDACs have been generally carried out in transiently transfected cells. In many instances, the treatment of cells with HDAC inhibitors, such as TSA or trapoxin, has been found to result in a 2–4-fold increase in the transcription of HDAC-repressed genes (15Heinzel T.

The ability of HDACs to repress transcription in vitro has not yet been tested. Hence, it is not yet known whether a chromatin template is required for repression by HDACs. It is possible, for instance, that HDACs repress transcription by acting through transcription factors or coregulators instead of the chromatin template. It is also not known whether HDACs repress the assembly of the transcription preinitiation complex or a post-initiation process such as transcriptional elongation. To address these questions, we performed a biochemical analysis ofDrosophila histone deacetylase 1 (dHDAC1, also known as dRPD3; Refs. 27Johnson C.A. Barlow A.L. Turner B.M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1998; 221: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar and 28De Rubertis F. Kadosh D. Henchoz S. Pauli D. Reuter G. Struhl K. Spierer P. Nature. 1996; 384: 589-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To this end, we prepared purified, recombinant dHDAC1 proteins that are highly active for the deacetylation of histones in vitro and then investigated the ability of these proteins to repress transcription by RNA polymerase II in vitro. His6-tagged NF-κB p65 protein (29Lin R. Gewert D. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3123-3131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was synthesized in Sf9 cells by using a recombinant baculovirus kindly provided by Dr. J. Hiscott (Lady Davis Institute, Montreal, Canada). The p65 protein was synthesized and purified essentially as described for His6-tagged p300 (30Kraus W.L. Kadonaga J.T.

Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 167-189Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged Sp1 was purified by using a recombinant baculovirus that was kindly provided by Drs. Soojin Ryu and Robert Tjian (University of California, Berkeley, CA). Constructions that encode His6-tagged versions of full-length dHDAC1 and Gal4-dHDAC1 were prepared from the dHDAC1 cDNA (27Johnson C.A. Barlow A.L. Turner B.M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1998; 221: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that was generously provided by Drs. Andrew Barlow and Bryan Turner (University of Birmingham, United Kingdom). The resulting dHDAC1 and Gal4-dHDAC1 proteins were synthesized in Sf9 cells by using a baculovirus expression system (PharMingen) and purified by Ni(II) affinity chromatography (Ni-NTA resin; Qiagen). Gal4-dHDAC1 consists of the N-terminal 147 amino acid residues of the yeast Gal4 protein (which contains the DNA binding region) fused to the N terminus of full-length dHDAC1 protein. The plasmid pHIV contains the proximal promoter region of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (from −137 to +38 relative to the +1 transcriptional start site). The plasmid pG5HIV is identical to pHIV except that it contains five tandem Gal4 binding sites (derived from pGIE-0; Ref. 32Pazin M.J. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1994; 266: 2007-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) upstream of the HIV-1 promoter, with the nearest Gal4 site located 48 base pairs from the upstream NF-κB site in the HIV-1 promoter. Histone deacetylase assays with free histones (as in Fig. 1) were performed as follows. PurifiedDrosophila core histones were prepared by the method of Bulger and Kadonaga (33Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Methods Mol. Genet. 1994; 5: 241-262Google Scholar) and then acetylated with [1-14C]acetic anhydride (ICN Radiochemicals), as described by Hebbes et al. (34Hebbes T.R. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1395-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). The resulting14C-acetyl histones were separated from the free labeled acetate and unreacted acetic anhydride by extensive dialysis. Histone deacetylase reactions were performed by incubation of the purified dHDAC derivatives (200 nm dHDAC1 or Gal4-dHDAC1) with 14C-acetyl histones (20 μg/ml; 1.5 μmin histone polypeptides) for 30 min at 30 °C in buffer (50 μl of total reaction volume) consisting of 50 mm Hepes, K+, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. The reactions were terminated by the addition of HCl (to 0.82 mfinal concentration) and acetic acid (to 0.12 m final concentration), and the resulting 14C-labeled acetic acid was extracted with ethyl acetate and quantitated with a liquid scintillation counter. The reported amounts of free14C-acetic acid were obtained by subtracting the background levels of 14C-acetic acid (in reactions with buffer only) from the amounts of 14C-acetic acid observed with dHDAC1 or Gal4-dHDAC1. (The background levels of14C-acetic acid were typically about 13–20% of the total radiolabeled material.) The deacetylation of nucleosomal histones (as in Fig. 4A) was assayed as follows. Purified Drosophila core histones (1 mg/ml; Ref. 33Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Methods Mol. Genet. 1994; 5: 241-262Google Scholar) were acetylated with purified His6-tagged human p300 (100 nm; Refs. 30Kraus W.L. Kadonaga J.T.

Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 167-189Google Scholar) and 1 mmacetyl-CoA for 30 min at 30 °C. The His6-tagged p300 was depleted from the sample with Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen), and the resulting p300-acetylated histones were assembled into chromatin with purified ACF and dNAP-1, as described by Ito et al. (35Ito T. Levenstein M.E. Fyodorov D.V. Kutach A.K. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1529-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). This chromatin was incubated with purified dHDAC1 derivatives (100 nm Gal4-dHDAC1 or dHDAC1) for 30 min at 30 °C, digested with micrococcal nuclease, and immunoprecipitated with anti-acetyl (Lys9, Lys14) histone H3 or anti-acetyl (Lys5, Lys8, Lys12, Lys16) histone H4 (Upstate Biotechnology). The resulting DNA fragments were resolved by 1.25% agarose gel electrophoresis and detected by Southern blot analysis. The HDAC inhibitor FR901228 (36Ueda H. Nakajima H. Hori Y. Fujita T.

Cell Res. 1998; 241: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) was a generous gift of Dr. Hidenori Nakajima (Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Ibaraki, Japan). Prior to use, FR901228 was dissolved in methanol to a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and then further diluted to a working stock solution of 0.1 mg/ml in methanol and stored at −20 °C. The HDAC inhibitor TSA (Sigma catalog number T8552; Refs. 38Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 39Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) was dissolved in ethanol to a concentration of 1.5 mg/ml and then further diluted to a working stock solution of 0.15 mg/ml in ethanol and stored at −20 °C. The addition of FR901228 or TSA resulted in a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v) methanol or ethanol in the histone deacetylase or transcription reactions. Control reactions with buffers containing 0.1% methanol or ethanol were performed to ensure that the effects seen with FR901228 or TSA were due to the specific inhibitors instead of the buffer medium. Transcription of S190-assembled chromatin (33Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Methods Mol. Genet. 1994; 5: 241-262Google Scholar, 40Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Gould H. Chromatin: A Practical Approach.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 31Kraus W.L. Kadonaga J.T. Picard D. Nuclear Receptors: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 167-189Google Scholar), except that a 3-fold mass excess (relative to the template DNA prior to chromatin assembly) of pUC118 was added to the reaction medium after chromatin assembly to remove any additional core histones. Transcription of chromatin that was assembled with purified recombinant ACF, purified recombinant dNAP-1, purified core histones, DNA, and ATP was carried out as described by Jiang et al. (41Jiang W. Nordeen S.K. Kadonaga J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39819-39822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), except that the core histones were pre-acetylated with purified recombinant p300 and acetyl CoA, as described above for the nucleosomal histone deacetylase assays. Quantitation of the data was carried out with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). All reaction conditions were performed in duplicate, and each experiment was performed a minimum of two (but typically, several) independent times to establish the reproducibility of the results. The amounts of transcription are reported as the mean ± S.D., relative to a reference indicated by parentheses. To study the mechanisms by which histone deacetylases regulate transcription by RNA polymerase II, we synthesizedDrosophila HDAC1 (dHDAC1) and Gal4-dHDAC1 in Sf9 cells by using a baculovirus expression system and then purified the proteins to near homogeneity (Fig.1A). dHDAC1 is in the Rpd3-like family of histone deacetylases and is also known as dRPD3 (27Johnson C.A. Barlow A.L. Turner B.M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1998; 221: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 28De Rubertis F. Kadosh D. Henchoz S. Pauli D. Reuter G. Struhl K. Spierer P. Nature. 1996; 384: 589-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Gal4-dHDAC1 consists of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused to the N terminus of full-length dHDAC1. The purified recombinant dHDAC1 and Gal4-dHDAC1 were then tested for histone deacetylase activity. For these assays, we prepared14C-acetyl histones by incubation of purifiedDrosophila core histones (which are mostly unacetylated) with [1-14C]acetic anhydride under conditions that result in the acetylation of essentially all of the unmodified lysine residues in the core histones (34Hebbes T.R. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1395-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). With these 14C-acetyl histones, we observed that purified dHDAC1 and Gal4-dHDAC1 can deacetylate about 38 and 15%, respectively, of the total acetyl lysine residues at a molar ratio of histone polypeptides to dHDAC1 (or Gal4-dHDAC1) of ∼7.5:1 (Fig. 1B). These findings thus indicate that the purified dHDAC1 protein is highly active for deacetylation of free histones in the absence of any other cofactors. We also observed that the HDAC activity of the recombinant proteins is completely inhibited by 10 mm sodium butyrate, 150 ng/ml (500 nm) TSA, or 100 ng/ml (185 nm) FR901228 (Fig. 1B). Whereas sodium butyrate and TSA are well known HDAC inhibitors, FR901228 has recently been found to be a potent and specific inhibitor of histone deacetylases (36Ueda H. Nakajima H. Hori Y. Fujita T.

Cell Res. 1998; 241: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). In fact, FR901228 inhibits HDAC activity at a lower concentration than TSA (37Nakajima H. Kim Y.B. Terano H. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Therefore, based on the potency, specificity, and chemical stability of FR901228, we chose to use this compound for the inhibition of HDAC activity. Next, we tested the ability of the dHDAC1 proteins to modulate transcription by RNA polymerase II. To this end, we used a chromatin transcription system based on the Drosophila S190 chromatin assembly extract (30Kraus W.L. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 31Kraus W.L. Kadonaga J.T. Picard D. Nuclear Receptors: A Practical Approach.

Acta. 1998; 1378: M1-M6PubMed Google Scholar). Two different plasmids were used as reporter templates: pHIV, which contains the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter; and pG5HIV, which is identical to pHIV except that it contains five Gal4 binding sites upstream of the HIV promoter fragment (Fig. 2). (To minimize steric effects of the binding of Gal4-dHDAC1 to the promoter, the Gal4 sites were placed upstream of the HIV-1 promoter.) The plasmids were assembled into chromatin with the S190 extract and then subjected to in vitro transcription analysis with a HeLa nuclear extract. Transcription was activated by Sp1 and NF-κB p65 proteins, which were added along with the dHDAC1 derivatives subsequent to chromatin assembly. As shown in Fig. 2, Gal4-dHDAC1, but not dHDAC1, represses transcription by about 2-fold from pG5HIV, but not from pHIV. Thus, transcriptional repression by dHDAC1 requires its recruitment to the template, which occurs, in this instance, via the Gal4 protein fusion and Gal4 binding sites. It is additionally important to note that dHDAC1 was found to have higher HDAC activity than Gal4-dHDAC1 (Fig.1B), and hence, the inability of dHDAC1 to repress transcription was not due to the lack of intrinsic HDAC activity. We further examined the repression of transcription by the Gal4-dHDAC1 protein as follows. First, we found that repression is blocked by the HDAC inhibitor, FR901228, and that repression is not observed with Gal4-(1–147) alone (which corresponds to the Gal4 portion of Gal4-dHDAC1) (Fig.3A). Thus, repression requires the dHDAC1 protein and correlates with the deacetylase activity. Second, we observed that Gal4- dHDAC1 does not repress transcription from naked DNA templates (Fig. 3B). Hence, repression by Gal4-dHDAC1 requires chromatin and is not due to an effect upon the intrinsic transcription process. To determine the step in the transcription process that is affected by Gal4-dHDAC1, we carried out single round transcription reactions. In these experiments, we used the detergent Sarkosyl, which inhibits the assembly of the transcription preinitiation complex but not the elongation of the transcriptionally engaged polymerase (43Hawley D.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8163-8172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Hawley D.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3452-3461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Kadonaga J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2624-2631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chromatin transcription reactions were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 2 and then Sarkosyl was added immediately (10 s) after the initiation of transcription by the addition of ribonucleoside 5′-triphosphates. These experiments revealed that Gal4-dHDAC1 mediates about 3.5-fold repression of the assembly of productive transcription preinitiation complexes (Fig. 3C). Moreover, repression by Gal4-dHDAC1 was found to be inhibited by FR901228 as well as dependent upon the presence of Gal4 sites in the DNA template. Therefore, these results indicate that Gal4-dHDAC1 represses the transcription initiation process. To investigate further the requirement for chromatin for repression by Gal4-dHDAC1, we tested the effect of Gal4- dHDAC1 upon chromatin templates that were assembled with completely purified components instead of the crude S190 extract. In these experiments, periodic nucleosome arrays were assembled with purified recombinant ACF, purified recombinant dNAP-1, purified core histones, plasmid DNA (pG5HIV or pHIV), and ATP, as described previously by Ito et al. (35Ito T. Levenstein M.E. Fyodorov D.V. Kutach A.K. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1529-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The chromatin that is assembled with the purified factors is not subject to potential alteration by undefined factors that are present in the S190 extract. We first tested the ability of dHDAC1 and Gal4-dHDAC1 to deacetylate histones that are packaged into chromatin. With chromatin containing five Gal4 sites, Gal4-dHDAC1 deacetylates nucleosomal histones H3 and H4 more efficiently than dHDAC1 (Fig.4A). This preferential deacetylation by Gal4-dHDAC1 relative to dHDAC1 was not seen with a template (pHIV) lacking Gal4 sites (data not shown). In addition, the deacetylation of nucleosomal H3 and H4 was inhibited by FR901228 (Fig.4A). We thus conclude that Gal4-dHDAC1 can deacetylate nucleosomal histones when the protein is recruited to the chromatin template. Next, we examined the effects of Gal4-dHDAC1 upon transcription of chromatin that is assembled with the purified components. Chromatin was assembled onto pG5HIV (five Gal4 sites) or pHIV (no Gal4 sites), as described above for the chromatin deacetylase assays (Fig.4A) and then transcribed with a HeLa extract. In these experiments, we observed that Gal4-dHDAC1 mediates a 2.5-fold repression that is dependent upon Gal4 binding sites and is inhibited by FR901228 (Fig. 4B). Thus, these results with the defined chromatin templates further support the conclusion that chromatin is required for repression by Gal4-dHDAC1. In summary, we have found that purified recombinant dHDAC1 and Gal4-dHDAC1 proteins are highly active histone deacetylases in the absence of any other factors and that Gal4-dHDAC1 is able to repress transcription in vitro in a chromatin-specific manner. Transcriptional repression by Gal4-dHDAC1 is blocked by the deacetylase inhibitor, FR901228. With chromatin templates, we observed a 2–3-fold repression of transcription by Gal4-dHDAC1. Consistent with our results, many studies carried out in vivo have found that TSA or trapoxin treatment of cells causes a 2–4-fold increase in transcription (15Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.-M.

The collective data suggest that many processes, including protein deacetylation, contribute to the proper regulation of gene activity. The findings of this study provide biochemical evidence for the requirement of chromatin for transcriptional repression by HDACs and further reveal that HDACs repress transcription initiation. In addition, the availability of highly active, purified recombinant dHDAC1 will facilitate the analysis of the role of protein deacetylation in a variety of cellular processes.
