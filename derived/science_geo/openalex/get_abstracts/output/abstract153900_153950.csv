This issue has been difficult to address because there is no indicator of cytosolic ATP, such as those available for Ca2+, capable of resolving the submembrane ATP concentration ([ATP]sm) in real time within a single cell. We show here that mutant ATP-sensitive K+ channels can be used to measure [ATP]sm by comparing the increase in current amplitude on patch excision with the ATP dose-response curve. In Xenopus oocytes, [ATP]sm was 4.6 ± 0.3 mm (n = 29) under resting conditions, slightly higher than that measured for the bulk cytoplasm (2.3 mm). In mammalian (COSm6) cells, [ATP]smwas slightly lower and averaged 1.4 ± 0.1 mm(n = 66). Metabolic poisoning (10 min of 3 mm azide) produced a significant fall in [ATP]sm in both types of cells: to 1.2 ± 0.1 mm (n = 24) in oocytes and 0.8 ± 0.11 mm for COSm6 cells. We conclude that [ATP]sm lies in the low millimolar range and that there is no gradient between bulk cytosolic and submembrane [ATP].

Ashcroft S.J.H. Cell. Signalling. 1990; 2: 197-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). In pancreatic β-cells these channels couple changes in blood glucose concentration to insulin secretion. In cardiac tissue they are involved in action potential shortening during ischemia, and in vascular smooth muscle they regulate vessel tone. Although KATP channels are inhibited by intracellular ATP with a Ki of ∼10 μm in excised patches, substantial channel activity is observed in intact β-cells under conditions where measured cytosolic [ATP] is 3–5 mm. It has therefore been proposed that the submembrane ATP concentration ([ATP]sm)1 may be lower than that of the bulk cytoplasm (1Ashcroft F.M. Ashcroft S.J.H. Cell. Signalling. 1990; 2: 197-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 2Niki I. Ashcroft F.M. Ashcroft S.J.H. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A similar suggestion has been made for liver cells under conditions of metabolic inhibition (3Aw T.Y. Jones D.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: C385-C392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Jones D.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 250: C663-C675Crossref Google Scholar). By contrast, studies of the Na/K-ATPase in erythrocytes have suggested that [ATP]sm may actually be higherthan that of the bulk cytosol (4Jones D.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 250: C663-C675Crossref Google Scholar, 5Proverbio F. Hoffman J.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 69: 605-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Resolution of this issue requires a method for measuring [ATP]sm. One way to measure [ATP]sm would be to use an ATP-sensitive channel as a biosensor, in the same way that Ca2+-activated K+ channels have been used to monitor submembrane [Ca2+] i (6Prakriya M. Solaro C.R. Lingle C.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4344-4359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The wild-type KATP channel is not suitable for this purpose because in intact cells the inhibitory effect of ATP is partially masked by an additional stimulatory action of MgADP (7Kakei M. Kelly R.P. Ashcroft S.J.H. Ashcroft F.M. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 8Nichols C.G. Shyng S.L. Nestorowicz A. Glaser B. Clement J.P., IV Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Permutt M.A. Bryan J. Science. 1996; 272: 1785-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). However, the KATP channel is an octamer of two subunits: Kir6.2 and SUR (9Clement J.P., IV Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 827-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 10Shyng S.L. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Kir6.2 is an inwardly rectifying potassium channel pore that is intrinsically sensitive to ATP, whereas SUR endows Kir6.2 with sensitivity to the stimulatory effects of MgADP (11Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement J.P., IV Namba N. Inazawa J. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Seino S. Bryan J. Science. 1995; 270: 1166-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1623) Google Scholar, 12Sakura H. Ämmälä C. Smith P.A.

Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Although wild-type KATP channels require both subunits for functional activity, a mutant form of Kir6.2 with a C-terminal truncation of 26 or 36 amino acids (Kir6.2ΔC) is capable of independent functional expression (14Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). This channel is inhibited by ATP but is not activated by MgADP, making it a potential tool for monitoring [ATP]sm. In this paper, we show that Kir6.2ΔC can be used as a biosensor for measurement of [ATP]sm. We found that in Xenopus oocytes [ATP]sm was ∼5 mm under resting conditions, whereas in mammalian cells, [ATP]sm averaged around 1 mm. Metabolic poisoning produced a significant fall in [ATP]sm in both types of cells. Thus, [ATP]sm is similar to or greater than the average [ATP]cyt, and submembrane ATP gradients are unlikely to contribute to the metabolic regulation of KATP channel activity. A C-terminal truncation of 26 or 36 amino acids of mouse Kir6.2 (GenBankTM accession numberD50581) was made by the introduction of a stop codon at the appropriate residue by site-directed mutagenesis. There was no difference in the ATP sensitivity of mutants carrying a 26- or 36-amino acid truncation (14Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar), so they are simply referred to here as Kir6.2ΔC, for simplicity. Site-directed mutations in Kir6.2ΔC were made using the pALTER vector. Synthesis of mRNA encoding wild-type and mutant mouse Kir6.2 was carried out as described previously (15Gribble F.M. Ashfield R. Ämmälä C. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. 1997; 498: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Xenopus oocytes were defolliculated and injected with ∼2 ng of mRNA encoding either wild-type or mutated Kir6.2ΔC, or Kir1.1a. The final injection volume was ∼50 nl/oocyte. Isolated oocytes were maintained in tissue culture and studied 1–4 days after injection (15Gribble F.M. Ashfield R. Ämmälä C. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. 1997; 498: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Whole-cell currents were measured at 18–24 °C using a standard 2- electrode voltage clamp (14Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar) in (mM): 90 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 5 HEPES (pH 7.4 with KOH). The holding potential was −10 mV. Currents were filtered at 1 kHz, digitized at 4 kHz, and measured 280–295 ms after the start of the voltage pulse. Macroscopic currents were recorded from giant inside-out patches at a holding potential of 0 mV and at 18–24 °C (15Gribble F.M. Ashfield R. Ämmälä C. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. 1997; 498: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The pipette solution contained (mM): 140 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 2.6 CaCl2, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with KOH). The internal (bath) solution contained (mM): 110 KCl, 1.4 MgCl2, 30 KOH, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES (pH 7.2 with KOH), and nucleotides as indicated. Macroscopic currents were recorded in response to 3-s voltage ramps from −110 to +100 mV, filtered at 0.2 kHz, and sampled at 0.5 kHz. The slope conductance was measured by fitting a straight line to the data between −20 and −100 mV; the average of five consecutive ramps was calculated in each solution, except when the currents were measured immediately after patch excision, when only 2 ramps were averaged to avoid errors due to channel rundown. Currents were corrected for leak (<1% of the total current) by subtraction of the mean current recorded in Kir6.2ΔC-injected oocytes at a maximally effective concentration of ATP. Mouse Kir6.2 and hamster SUR1 (GenBankTM accession number L40623) were used for these experiments. Point mutations were made in a Kir6.2ΔC36-C166S construct (Kir6.2ΔCS), in which the C terminus was truncated by 36 amino acids and cysteine 166 was replaced by serine. Mutations were prepared by overlap extension at the junctions of relevant residues using the sequential polymerase chain reaction (16Koster J.C. Sha Q. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 4: 203-213Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and the resulting polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned into the pCMV6b vector for transfection. In some experiments, we used a mutant form of SUR1 in which glycine 1485 was replaced by aspartic acid (abbreviated here as SUR1-GD). COSm6 cells (a variety of COS cells) were plated at a density of ∼2.5 × 105 cells per well in 30-mm 6-well dishes and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10 mm glucose supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). The next day, cells were transfected with pCMV6b-Kir6.2ΔCS (with mutations as described), pECE-SUR1-GD, and pGreenLantern (Life Technologies, Inc.) using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Currents were recorded at −50 mV from cell-attached and inside-out patches from green fluorescent cells using a chamber that allowed rapid solution changes (16Koster J.C. Sha Q. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 4: 203-213Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Current amplitudes were measured by fitting a straight line through the data points once the current had reached a steady state. Both bath (intracellular) and pipette (extracellular) solutions contained (mM): 140 KCl, 1 K-EGTA, 10 K-HEPES (pH 7.3), with additions as described. All data are given as mean ± S.E. The symbols in the figures indicate the mean, and the vertical bars indicate one S.E. (where this is larger than the symbol). ATP dose-response relationships were fit to the Hill equation: G/G c = 1/(1 + ([ATP]/Ki) h )),where G is the slope conductance in the presence of ATP, G c is the mean conductance obtained in control solution (before and after ATP application), [ATP] is the ATP concentration,Ki is the ATP concentration at which inhibition is half-maximal, and h is the slope factor (Hill coefficient). Statistical significance was tested using Student's ttest. Currents recorded from cell-attached patches on oocytes injected with Kir6.2ΔC were very small but increased ∼50-fold following patch excision (Fig.1 A). This increase in conductance was not observed in water-injected oocytes, indicating that it results from activation of Kir6.2ΔC currents that are inhibited in the cell-attached configuration. Subsequent application of 1 mm ATP to the intracellular membrane surface largely blocked Kir6.2ΔC currents, suggesting that the submembrane ATP concentration may be responsible for channel inhibition in the intact oocyte. Consistent with this idea, large currents were recorded from cell-attached patches on oocytes expressing the ATP-insensitive Kir channel Kir1.1a, and no change in conductance was observed on patch excision. The mean Kir1.1α conductance was 15.0 ± 3.6 nanosiemens in the cell-attached patch and 15.5 ± 3.9 nanosiemens after patch excision (n = 5, data not shown). The mean conductance in control (water-injected) oocytes was <0.2 nanosiemens. A critical test of whether the amplitude of Kir6.2ΔC currents in the intact cell reflects [ATP]sm is to examine mutant channels with altered ATP sensitivity, because these should produce markedly different current amplitudes in cell-attached patches yet yield similar values of [ATP]sm. We studied three different Kir6.2ΔC mutations that reduce the channel ATP sensitivity to differing extents: R50G, I167M, and E179Q (Fig. 1 B). Half-maximal inhibition (Ki) of wild-type Kir6.2ΔC currents was produced by 115 ± 6 μm ATP (n = 11). Mutation of the arginine at position 50 to glycine (R50G) reduced the Ki for ATP inhibition to 3.4 mm, mutation of isoleucine 167 to methionine (I167M) decreased the Ki to 640 μm, and mutation of glutamate 179 to glutamine (E179Q) reduced the Ki to 300 μm (17Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Proks P. Trapp S. Ryder T.J. Haug T. Reimann F. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3290-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). As expected, channels that showed lower ATP sensitivity exhibited larger currents in the cell-attached configuration and a smaller increase in conductance on patch excision (Fig. 2 A and Table I). There was a reciprocal relationship between the Ki for current inhibition by ATP and the increase in conductance on patch excision (Fig.2 B), and the [ATP]sm calculated from each set of data was similar (see Fig. 4 and Table I). This constitutes good evidence that the principal cytosolic regulator of Kir6.2ΔC activity is [ATP]sm. The mean value of the submembrane ATP concentration in oocytes calculated from all the data given in Table I(and Fig. 2) is 4.6 ± 0.3 mm (n = 29) and that from the slope of the graph in Fig. 2 B is 5.7 mm.Table IEstimation of [ATP] sm from the increase in conductance following patch excisionOocytesCloneG1G2G2/G1[ATP]smnnanosiemensmmKir6.2ΔC0.56 ± 0.0528 ± 251 ± 25.8 ± 0.39Kir6.2ΔC-E179Q2.2 ± 0.741 ± 922 ± 45.0 ± 0.88Kir6.2ΔC-I167M2.6 ± 0.816.4 ± 4.47.2 ± 0.93.2 ± 0.58Kir6.2ΔC-R50G2.3 ± 0.75.8 ± 1.92.4 ± 0.24.2 ± 0.54COSm6 cellsCloneG2/G1[ATP]smnmmKir6.2ΔCS-I154C0.15 ± 0.061.8 ± 0.64Kir6.2ΔCS + SUR1-GD0.47 ± 0.060.96 ± 0.1429Kir6.2ΔCS-I154C + SUR1-GD0.12 ± 0.041.4 ± 0.314Kir6.2ΔCS-T171C + SUR1-GD0.65 ± 0.101.83 ± 0.2819[ATP] was calculated from [ATP] = (G2/G1 − 1)1/h × Ki , where G1 is the slope conductance in the cell-attached condition, G2 is the slope conductance immediately after excision of the same patch,Ki is the concentration of ATP required to block the channel half-maximally, and h is the Hill coefficient for the dose-response curve for ATP inhibition.

We also measured the submembrane ATP concentration in mammalian cells using a similar approach with another C-terminally deleted construct of Kir6.2 (Kir6.2ΔCS-I154C). This contains the double mutation C166S and I154C, which shifts the ATP sensitivity of the channel into the appropriate physiological range:Ki = 0.54 ± 0.12 mm(n = 4). Table I shows that the estimated [ATP]sm in COSm6 cells using Kir6.2ΔCS-I154C was 1.8 + 0.6 mm. The patch current level in such experiments was generally quite low. As reported previously (14Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar), the level of current is enhanced by coexpression of SUR1. To obtain larger patch currents, and hence increase the accuracy of measured channel activities, we performed further experiments on cells coexpressing Kir6.2ΔCS constructs with a mutant SUR1 containing the point mutation G1485D (SUR1-GD). This mutation abolishes nucleotide diphosphate stimulation of KATP channel currents (8Nichols C.G. Shyng S.L. Nestorowicz A. Glaser B. Clement J.P., IV Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Permutt M.A. Bryan J. Science. 1996; 272: 1785-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 18Shyng S.L. Ferrigni T. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) such that coexpressed channels should only be sensitive to [ATP]. As shown in Fig.4 and Table I, coexpression of SUR1-GD with Kir6.2ΔCS-I154C does not significantly alter the estimated [ATP]sm (1.4 ± 0.3 mm versus1.8 ± 0.6 mm). We also examined additional Kir6.2ΔCS mutants that displayed a range of ATP sensitivities. For each patch the membrane current before and immediately after excision was measured, and the ATP dose-response curve was then constructed. The Ki for ATP inhibition of Kir6.2ΔCS-I154C + SUR1-GD, Kir6.2ΔCS + SUR1-GD, and Kir6.2ΔCS-T171C + SUR1-GD currents were 0.49 ± 0.1 (n = 14), 0.78 ± 0.09 (n = 29), and 3.09 ± 0.49 mm (n = 19), respectively. As observed in the oocyte experiments, those channels that were least sensitive to ATP exhibited the largest currents in the cell-attached configuration and the smallest increment in current on patch excision (Fig. 3). The value of [ATP]sm estimated for the different KATP channel mutants varied between 1 and 1.8 mm (Fig. 4 and Table I), with an overall mean value of 1.36 ± 0.13 mm (n = 66). These values are somewhat lower than those found in oocytes, suggesting that [ATP]sm may be lower in COSm6 cells. In intact Xenopusoocytes, inhibition of cell metabolism by 3 mm azide leads to an increase in the whole-cell KATP current (15Gribble F.M. Ashfield R. Ämmälä C. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. 1997; 498: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Using the value for resting [ATP]sm obtained above, we can estimate the fall in submembrane [ATP] following metabolic inhibition. Fig. 4 shows the estimated [ATP]sm in the presence of 3 mm azide. The mean [ATP]sm, calculated from all data, fell to 1.2 ± 0.1 mm(n = 24) when metabolism was inhibited. This value is similar to that measured biochemically for the bulk cytoplasm in the presence of 3 mm azide (1.7 mm, Ref. 15Gribble F.M. Ashfield R. Ämmälä C. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. 1997; 498: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Submembrane [ATP] also fell in mammalian cells incubated in 3 mm azide (Fig. 4) to a mean value of 0.76 ± 0.11 mm (n = 12) after 10 min (averaged for all Kir6.2ΔCS mutants coexpressed with SUR1-GD). Even greater falls in [ATP]sm were observed when cells were preincubated in the presence of 1 mm 2-deoxyglucose and 2.5 μg/ml oligomycin (Fig. 4); in this case, the mean value of [ATP]sm was 0.1 ± 0.06 mm(n = 5) after a 30-min preincubation (measured for Kir6.2ΔCS mutants coexpressed with SUR1-GD). This is consistent with earlier studies that have shown that this protocol induces a marked activation of wild-type KATP channel activity, as measured by rubidium efflux (18Shyng S.L. Ferrigni T. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). It is implicit in the use of Kir6.2ΔC to measure [ATP]sm that other cytosolic factors have little or no effect on channel activity or ATP sensitivity. Our results support this idea, because a similar estimate of [ATP]sm is obtained for channels with different Ki for ATP inhibition. We have shown elsewhere that Kir6.2ΔC is selectively inhibited by ATP and is not substantially blocked by other nucleoside triphosphates (Ki > 5 mm, Ref. 17Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Proks P. Trapp S. Ryder T.J. Haug T. Reimann F. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3290-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Only ATP, Ap4A (Ki = ∼100 μm), and ADP (Ki = ∼250 μm) were potent blockers of Kir6.2ΔC. The concentrations of Ap4A and ADP in the bulk cytoplasm are believed to lie within the low and intermediate micromolar range, respectively (19Ripoll C. Martin F. Manuel-Rovira J. Pintor J. Miras-Portugal M.T. Soria B. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1431-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Ghosh A. Ronner P. Cheong E. Khalid P. Matschinsky F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22887-22892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and are much lower than that of ATP. Thus we assume that the activity of Kir6.2ΔC in the intact cell is largely determined by [ATP]sm. Recent studies have shown that the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate decreases the sensitivity of the KATP channel to ATP and that the gradual loss of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate from the membrane that occurs following patch excision is accompanied by an enhanced ATP sensitivity (21Fan Z. Makielski J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5388-5395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 22Shyng S.-L. Nichols C.G. Science. 1998; 282: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 23Baukrowitz T. Schulte U. Oliver D. Herlitze S. Krauter T. Tucker S.J. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Science. 1998; 282: 1141-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Such a lowering of the Ki for ATP inhibition would lead to an underestimate of [ATP]sm. Thus to avoid artifactual changes in ATP sensitivity, ATP dose-response curves were measured immediately after patch excision. The mean value of the submembrane ATP concentration in oocytes (∼5 mm) is approximately double that measured from the whole oocyte using a biochemical method (2.3 mm, Ref. 15Gribble F.M. Ashfield R. Ämmälä C. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. 1997; 498: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The difference may be only apparent and reflect exclusion of ATP from certain compartments (such as the yolk platelets), or it may indicate an inverse ATP gradient between the membrane and bulk cytosol. We favor the former explanation because a similar difference was found in oocytes of the frog Rana pipiens in biochemical measurements of cytosolic (6 mm) and total (2.5 mm) [ATP] (24Miller D.S. Horowitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13911-13915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whatever the reason, our results do not support the widely held view that the submembrane ATP concentration is lower than that of the bulk cytosol (1Ashcroft F.M. Ashcroft S.J.H. Cell. Signalling. 1990; 2: 197-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 2Niki I. Ashcroft F.M. Ashcroft S.J.H. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 3Aw T.Y.

Recently, the submembrane ATP concentration has been estimated in pancreatic β-cells using a membrane-tagged luciferin and found to be ∼1 mm under resting conditions (3 mm glucose) (25Kennedy H.J.

Our results on mammalian cells are in good agreement with these studies. Furthermore, the fact that two different methods provide a similar value for [ATP]sm helps validate the different assumptions intrinsic to each method. The bulk cytosolic [ATP] in various mammalian cells is also ∼1 mm: 1.0 mmin β-cells (25Kennedy H.J. Pouli A.E. Ainscow E.K. Jouaville L.S. Rizzuto R. Rutter G.A. J. Biol.

The advantage of using Kir6.2ΔC as a biosensor is that it is able to respond very rapidly to changes in [ATP]sm. In conclusion, our results suggest that Kir6.2ΔC alone, or Kir6.2 coexpressed with a mutant SUR1, may be used as tools to monitor the submembrane ATP concentration in real time in a single cell. Inside-out patches excised from cells expressing mutant KATP channels might also be used to detect the local release of ATP from purinergic neurons, as described for acetylcholine release using acetylcholine receptor channels (28Hume R.I. Role L.W. Fischbach G.D. Nature. 1983; 305: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In a similar fashion, inside-out macropatches containing mutant KATP channels might serve to monitor exocytosis from single secretory cells, as many types of secretory granules contain ATP. Importantly, our data also demonstrate that the submembrane ATP concentration lies in the millimolar, rather than the micromolar, range in both Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2007470352,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are implicated in both cartilage aging and the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. We developed an in vitro model to study the role of chondrocyte-derived ROS in cartilage matrix protein degradation. Matrix proteins in cultured primary articular chondrocytes were labeled with [3H]proline, and the washed cell matrix was returned to a serum-free balanced salt solution. Exposure to hydrogen peroxide resulted in oxidative damage to the cell matrix as established by monitoring the release of labeled material into the medium. Calcium ionophore treatment of chondrocytes, in a dose-dependent manner, significantly enhanced the release of labeled matrix, suggesting a chondrocyte-dependent mechanism of matrix degradation. Antioxidant enzymes such as catalase or superoxide dismutase did not influence matrix release by the calcium ionophore-activated chondrocytes. However, vitamin E, at physiological concentrations, significantly diminished the release of labeled matrix by activated chondrocytes. The fact that vitamin E is a chain-breaking antioxidant indicates that the mechanism of matrix degradation and release is mediated by the lipid peroxidation process. Lipid peroxidation was measured in chondrocytes loaded withcis-parinaric acid. Both resting and activated cells showed constitutive and enhanced levels of lipid peroxidation activity, which were significantly reduced in the presence of vitamin E. In an immunoblot analysis, malondialdehyde and hydroxynonenal adducts were observed in chondrocyte-matrix extracts, and the amount of adducts increased with calcium ionophore treatment. Furthermore, vitamin E diminished aldehyde-protein adduct formation in activated extracts, which suggests that vitamin E has an antioxidant role in preventing protein oxidation. This study provides in vitro evidence linking chondrocyte lipid peroxidation to cartilage matrix protein (collagen) oxidation and degradation and suggests that vitamin E has a preventive role.

Res. 1998; 29: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we and others have documented that chondrocytes produce reactive oxygen species (ROS).1 The production of ROS by chondrocytes can contribute to degradation of the cartilage matrix. For example, ROS can mediate intracellular signaling and gene activation of cytokine and growth factor-induced products in chondrocytes (8.Lo Y.Y.C. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11727-11730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 9.Lo Y.Y.C. Wong J.M.S. Cruz T.F. J. Biol.

In activated neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages, the cell-specific gene products of “NADPH-oxidase complex” physically come together and initiate single electron reduction of oxygen and the release of ROS outside the cells. Phagocytes use the toxic properties of ROS to eliminate pathogens (10.Hiran T.S. Moulton P.J. Hancock J.T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 736-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 11.Klebanoff S.J. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Synderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. 2nd Ed.

The observation that in vitro exposure to ROS damages cartilage matrix suggests that chondrocyte-derived ROS may mediate matrix degradation (12.Greenwald R.A. Semin.

However, the in vivo role of ROS in cartilage matrix degradation is difficult to evaluate, because cartilage is avascular and ROS are extremely labile. Previously we reported that chondrocyte-derived hydrogen peroxide mediates aggrecan degradation, which can be inhibited by antioxidants (19.Tiku M.L. Gupta S. Deshmukh D.R. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 30: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigate the role of chondrocyte-derived ROS in cartilage matrix protein (collagen) degradation. Studying the mechanism of collagen degradation is important, because several studies indicate that damage to cartilage collagen is a central event in the pathogenesis of cartilage aging and osteoarthritis (20.Kempson G.E. Muir H. Pollard C. Tuke M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 297: 465-472Crossref Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 21.Hollander A.P. Pidoux I. Reiner A. Rorabeck C. Bourne R. Poole A.R. J. Clin.

To determine the role of chondrocyte-ROS in cartilage matrix protein (collagen) degradation, we followed a paradigm used previously (11.Klebanoff S.J. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Synderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1992: 541-588Google Scholar, 19.Tiku M.L. Gupta S. Deshmukh D.R. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 30: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) that has helped elucidate the functions of ROS in phagocytic cells. In these studies, phagocytic cells were often incubated with viable pathogens and cells were induced to yield oxidative bursts (11.Klebanoff S.J. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Synderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1992: 541-588Google Scholar, 19.Tiku M.L. Gupta S. Deshmukh D.R. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 30: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The role of ROS in killing pathogens is deciphered by using specific antioxidant enzymes or scavengers of ROS. In our model system, primary articular chondrocytes were cultured and collagen matrix was labeled with [3H]proline. Collagen is characterized by a triple helical structure of Gly-X-Y repeat sequence, where X and Y often are represented by proline and hydroxyproline. The major structural component of cartilage tissue is collagen type II. Incorporation of radiolabeled proline is often used to study the synthesis and degradation of cartilage collagen matrix (24.Bienkowski R.S. Cowan M.J. McDonald J.A. Crystal R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4356-4363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Daniel J.C. Pauli B.U. Kuettner K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1960-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). About 40–70% of labeled material in the matrix is associated with collagen, the rest is associated with noncollagenous material (26.Koyano Y. Hammerle H. Mollenhauer J. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 706-716PubMed Google Scholar). The release of labeled material into the medium from cell-monolayer-matrix cultures provides an index of matrix degradation. Using this model, we observed that chondrocyte activation-dependent matrix degradation was mediated by lipid peroxidation and not by the release of ROS. We also demonstrated the formation of aldehydic protein adducts with the cartilage matrix and the role of vitamin E. The relevance of these findings in the context of cartilage aging and osteoarthritis is presented. Lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli 0127:B8 (LPS), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (fMLP), calcium ionophore A23187, 4-bromo-calcium ionophore A23187, concanavalin A (ConA), superoxide dismutase, catalase,N-t-butylphenylnitrone, ascorbic acid, vitamin E, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propylgallate (PG), and deferoxamine (Def) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Hydrogen peroxide of reagent grade was from Fisher Scientific (Fairlawn, NJ). Dulbecco's minimum essential medium, fetal bovine serum, Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), Earl's balanced salt solution (EBSS),l-glutamine, gentamicin, HEPES buffer, penicillin, and streptomycin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.l-[2,3-3H]Proline, with a specific activity of 1.6 GBq/mmol, was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. New Zealand White rabbits (2.7–3.6 kg) of either sex were killed by intravenous injection of Beuthanasia-D special (Schering Corp., Kenilworth, NJ). The chondrocytes were isolated as described previously (27.Tiku K. Thakker-Varia S. Ramachandrula A. Tiku M.L. Cell. Immunol. 1992; 140: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The viability of chondrocytes was confirmed by trypan blue exclusion. Primary chondrocytes were resuspended in 10% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing antibiotics (1%) and HEPES buffer (10 mm, pH 7.4) (complete media). Primary rabbit articular chondrocytes were distributed into 24-well plates at a concentration of 1–2 × 105 cells/well in 1 ml of complete media. Chondrocytes were allowed to attach for 3–5 days, and media was changed every 3 days. Confluent cells in multiwell plates were labeled with 1–2.5 μCi/well with [3H]proline during the last 24–48 h of cell culture. The cell monolayer was washed at least four to five times with warm HBSS by flipping the plates to remove unincorporated proline from the matrix. Albumin or serum-free EBSS was added to the wells. Experiments were carried out in triplicate wells. The test reagents were added, and the total volume was adjusted to 0.5 ml with EBSS. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2incubator for 4–24 h. A 100-μl aliquot was removed and processed for scintillation counting. The plastic-bound [3H]proline-labeled matrix (i.e. residuum) was solubilized with 0.5 m NaOH and counted. Percentage release of [3H]proline label was calculated and is shown in the figures. Lipid peroxidation in chondrocytes was measured by the cis-parinaric acid (CPA) method described by Hedley and Chow (28.Hedley D. Chow S. Cytometry. 1992; 13: 686-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Trypsin-EDTA-released confluent primary chondrocytes were loaded with 10 μm cis-parinaric acid for 1 h at 37 °C and washed. The fluorescence due to parinaric acid was monitored at 37 °C using a luminescence spectrometer (LS-5B; Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT) set at 325-nm excitation/405-nm emission. Primary articular chondrocytes in high density (1 × 106/ml) were cultured in 60-mm Petri dishes to confluency, washed three times with HBSS, and set in EBSS, with or without agonist, in a total volume of 1.5 ml for the duration, as indicated in the figure legends. The medium and cell matrix were harvested with a cell scraper in the presence of mixture of inhibitors EDTA (0.5 m), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μm) and leupeptin (1 μm), and the material was transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. 150 μl of saturated trichloroacetic acid solution was added, and the tubes were incubated for 30 min on ice and microcentrifuged at 12,500 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants were discarded, and the pellets were washed with 50 μl of ethanol, resuspended in 100 μl of sample buffer (Laemmli), and frozen at −70 °C. The samples were thawed and boiled for 5 min with 5 μl of β-mercaptoethanol. They were then cooled on ice, vortexed, spun, and boiled as necessary. A total of 30 μl of each sample was loaded onto a 4% stacking gel and separated in 10% resolving SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gel in a mini-PROTEAN II electrophoresis cell (Bio-Rad). Electrophoresis was carried out under the reducing condition of Laemmli (29.Laemmli U.K. Nature (Lond.). 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). Proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane with Trans-Blot electrophoretic transfer. The blots were incubated with 50 ml of 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) with Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris/500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) containing 0.1% Tween 20, then washed three times for 15 min with 0.5% BSA with Tris-buffered saline (TBS). For immunodetection, blots were incubated with antibodies diluted in 1% BSA/TBS for 1 h. The mouse monoclonal antibodies MDA2, specific for malondialdehyde-modified lysine, and NA59, specific for 4-hydroxynonenal-modified lysine, were kindly provided by Dr. W. Palinski, University of California, San Diego (30.Palinski W. Horkko S. Miller E. Steinbrecher U.P. Powell H.C. Curtiss L.K. Witztum J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 800-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibodies were used at dilutions of 1:2500. The primary antibody was removed, and the blots were washed three times (15 min each) with TBS containing Tween 20. The blots were then incubated in horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat antimouse IgG in 1% BSA/TBS (diluted 1:2500) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were again washed with TBS (15 min each), and proteins were visualized as outlined in the ECL Western blotting protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Control blots were also developed, in which incubation with primary antibody was avoided and blots reacted with secondary antibodies and processed as usual. In the absence of monoclonal antibodies, no reactivity to secondary antibodies was observed, indicating the immunospecificity of monoclonal antibodies. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Total counts in residuum ± S.E. are reported in individual figures or tables. There was a 10% coefficient of variation between the mean and highest and lowest counts in random wells of each experiment. The differences of the means between groups in the same experiment were evaluated by Student's t test (Statview program), and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The susceptibility of [3H]proline-labeled chondrocyte matrix to oxidant damage was investigated by exposing cultures to a bolus of 2 mm hydrogen peroxide. As shown in Fig.1, the release of [3H]proline-labeled matrix was significantly enhanced at 4 h in cultures exposed to hydrogen peroxide. The release of labeled matrix by hydrogen peroxide was dose- and time-dependent (data not shown). Hydrogen peroxide is implicated in aggrecan and collagen degradation (19.Tiku M.L. Gupta S. Deshmukh D.R. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 30: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The data indicate that the release of labeled matrix in the culture media corresponds to the known oxidative-damaging potential of hydrogen peroxide on cartilage matrix. Chondrocytes were also treated with a variety of agonists (LPS, PMA, fMLP, ConA, and A23187) that have been shown to induce oxidative burst activity in chondrocytes (2.Tiku M.L. Liesh J.B. Robertson F.M. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 690-696PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Rathakrishnan C. Tiku K. Raghavan A. Tiku M.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 4.Rathakrishnan C. Tiku M.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 15: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Of the various agonists tested, only calcium ionophore A23187 produced a 4- to 10-fold increase in the release of labeled material, as compared with background release by untreated cells (Fig. 1). The A23187 treatment resulted in the release of labeled matrix in dose-dependent manner that was rapid, detected as early as 2 h, reaching a peak by 4–8 h (Fig.2). It should be noted that in a pulse-chase experiment (Fig. 2), the amount of the labeled matrix released progressively increased with time and the concentration of agonist, suggesting the release of [3H]proline-labeled material was from mature extracellular matrix (collagen) and not from intracellular [3H]proline-labeled peptides. Also, the soluble released radioactivity was 90–95% precipitable by trichloroacetic acid (10%) (data not shown), indicating that the radioactivity was associated with peptides. These observations indicate that calcium ionophore activates chondrocyte-dependent matrix release. Microscopic observation and trypan blue dye exclusion studies ruled out the possibility of chondrocyte lysis as the cause of matrix release by calcium ionophore-treated chondrocytes. The rapid timing of matrix release suggests the involvement of chondrocyte-ROS in matrix degradation. To investigate the contribution of chondrocyte-derived ROS in the damage and release of labeled matrix, chondrocyte monolayers were preincubated with either superoxide dismutase (SOD, 100 units/ml), catalase (1000 units/ml), or a combination of both, then treated with or without calcium ionophore A23187 (Fig.3). Neither SOD, catalase, nor a combination of these two antioxidant enzymes altered the release of matrix, compared with the amount of labeled material released by A23187-activated chondrocytes. These results suggest that neither superoxide anion nor hydrogen peroxide produced by activated chondrocytes are involved in the process of cartilage matrix protein degradation and release. Antioxidant enzymes had no effect on the background amount of labeled matrix released by control unstimulated cells. Preliminary experiments indicated that vitamin E inhibited the release of labeled matrix in activated chondrocytes. Data from the representative experiment are shown in TableI. Shown in Table I are counts/min of [3H]proline-labeled matrix release at 4 and 8 h. Vitamin E and diluent ethanol (into which vitamin E was dissolved) did not alter the amount of labeled matrix released by resting control chondrocytes. On the contrary, calcium ionophore A23187 caused a 3-fold increase in the release of labeled matrix. Vitamin E (250 and 500 μm) completely abolished the enhancement of matrix released by calcium ionophore A23187. The abolishing effect of vitamin E was specific and not mediated by diluent ethanol (Table I) on calcium ionophore A23178-treated chondrocytes. Because vitamin E is a chain-breaking antioxidant, the data suggest that the mechanism of matrix release by activated chondrocytes may be mediated by the process of chondrocyte lipid peroxidation (31.van Acker S.A. Koymans L.M. Bast A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 15: 311-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar).Table IEffect of vitamin E on chondrocyte-dependent collagenolysisConditions[3H]Proline-labeled collagen released4 h8 hcpm ± S.E.aMean counts per minute of triplicate wells ± S.E.

Open table in a new tab The dose-response effect of two natural antioxidant vitamins C and E, on calcium ionophore-induced chondrocyte-dependent matrix release, is shown in Fig.4. Vitamin C did not show a clear dose-dependent inhibition of [3H]proline matrix release of activated chondrocytes; only at 25 mm was significant vitamin C-induced inhibition seen, as compared with the amount released by A23187-activated chondrocytes (Fig. 4 B). There was, however, a dose-dependent inhibition of the release of matrix by activated chondrocytes in the presence of an increased concentration of vitamin E (Fig. 4 A). Interestingly, vitamin E (100 μm) in some experiments (e.g. Experiment 3) also significantly inhibited the background amount of matrix release by resting control cells, suggesting that vitamin E may be effective in quenching the lipid peroxidative activity of resting chondrocytes. Lipid peroxidation activity was determined in chondrocytes loaded withcis-parinaric acid (10 μm) (28.Hedley D. Chow S. Cytometry. 1992; 13: 686-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Serial spectrofluorometric readings of resting and activated chondrocytes in the presence of physiological concentration of vitamin E (50 μm) are shown in Fig. 5. There was progressive loss of fluorescence in resting chondrocytes, indicating the basal level of lipid peroxidation activity. Vitamin E inhibited the loss of fluorescence, which suggests that vitamin E modulated the baseline lipid peroxidation activity in chondrocytes. Calcium ionophore A23187 (4-bromo-, a nonfluorescent species) caused a rapid and progressive loss of fluorescence; the presence of vitamin E diminished fluorescence loss in A23187-activated chondrocytes. These findings suggest that vitamin E interrupts the lipid peroxidation activity in both resting and activated chondrocytes. To investigate the possibility that matrix released by activated chondrocytes may be due to the production of metalloproteinases, we determined the effect on matrix release by 1,10-phenanthroline, a general matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor (32.Arribas J. Coodly L. Vollmer P. Kishimoto T.K. Rose-John S. Massaque J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11376-11382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). 1,10-Phenanthroline (5–100 μm) did not inhibit the release of matrix by A23187-treated chondrocytes (Fig. 6), suggesting that matrix metalloproteinases are not involved in the process of matrix release by activated chondrocytes. A higher concentration of 1,10-phenanthroline (≥500 μm) resulted in nonspecific release of chondrocyte-matrix monolayer from tissue culture wells. Furthermore, soybean trypsin inhibitor, a serine protease inhibitor, did not decrease calcium-inonophore-induced matrix release (data not shown), indicating that chondrocyte-derived serine proteases are not involved in matrix release. The effects of the antioxidants, BHT and PG, known to inhibit lipid-free radical reactions, were tested in our model system (33.Aruoma O.I. Free Radic. Biol.

In addition, the effect of deferoxamine, which has been shown to interrupt the lipid peroxidation process by chelating iron (34.Gutteridge J.M.C. Clin. Chem. 1995; 41: 1819-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar), was tested. Both antioxidants and deferoxamine significantly inhibited the release of labeled matrix by activated chondrocytes (Fig.7), further suggesting that lipid-free radical reaction has a role in matrix damage. Similarly,N-t-butylphenylnitrone (500 μm), a spin-trapping agent, also showed a protective role in inhibiting matrix release by activated chondrocytes (data not shown). Malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydroxynonenal (HNE), major aldehydic products of lipid peroxidation, are believed to be largely responsible for cytopathological effects observed during oxidative stress of lipid peroxidation (35.Poli G. Parola M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 287-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar,36.Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5902) Google Scholar). MDA and HNE react with histidine and lysine residues of proteins to form stable adducts. Demonstration of aldehydic adducts therefore provides clues to the nature of oxidative stress. Protein gel electrophoresis (Fig. 8 A) and immunoblot analysis using monoclonal MDA2, specific for MDA-modified lysine (Fig. 8 B), and NA59 (30.Palinski W. Horkko S. Miller E. Steinbrecher U.P.

Compared with control chondrocyte extracts, the extracts from calcium ionophore (5 μm)-treated chondrocytes at 1, 2, and 4 h (lane 4) showed an increased appearance of immunoreactive bands to both MDA2 and NA59, suggesting the formation of activation-dependent adducts. The immunoreactivity of the bands was highest in the 1-h sample and progressively decreased, suggesting a degradative/metabolic process. Together, the data suggest the activation-dependent appearance of MDA- and HNE-protein adducts in chondrocyte extracts, indicating cell-dependent protein oxidation. We tested the effect of vitamin E on aldehyde-protein adduct formation. Protein gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis using NA59 monoclonal antibody are shown in Fig. 9. As shown, NA59 immunoreactivity of the major band increased in calcium inonophore treatment extracts. However, pretreatment and the presence of vitamin E during the activation process resulted in a diminished presence of the major immunoreactive band, suggesting that vitamin E diminished protein oxidation in activated chond"

Calcium and phosphorylation on Ser-505 by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) regulate cPLA2. Arachidonic acid release and eicosanoid production induced by stimuli that do (A23187, zymosan) or do not (phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), okadaic acid) mobilize calcium were quantitatively suppressed in cPLA2-deficient mouse peritoneal macrophages. The contribution of MAPKs to cPLA2-mediated arachidonic acid release was investigated. Both extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and p38 contributed to cPLA2 phosphorylation on Ser-505. However, although ERK inhibition did not affect A23187-induced arachidonic acid release, it suppressed zymosan-, PMA-, and okadaic acid-induced arachidonic acid release under conditions where phosphorylation of cPLA2 on Ser-505 was unaffected. This indicates an additional regulatory mechanism for the ERK pathway. A role for transcriptional regulation is suggested by data showing that cycloheximide and actinomycin D inhibited arachidonic acid release induced by zymosan, PMA and, okadaic acid but not by A23187.

A variety of agonists, such as the calcium ionophore A23187, the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, the protein kinase C activator phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and the phagocytic particle zymosan, induce arachidonic acid release in these cells. These agonists also trigger phosphorylation of cPLA2 and activation of ERKs by either protein kinase C-dependent (PMA, zymosan) or protein kinase C-independent (A23187, okadaic acid) pathways (23.Qiu Z.-H. de Carvalho M.S.

Previous studies have implicated cPLA2 in mediating arachidonic acid release from mouse peritoneal macrophages in response to a variety of stimuli (23.Qiu Z.-H. de Carvalho M.S. Leslie C.C. J. Biol.

However, since macrophages contain different types of PLA2 enzymes, experiments were carried out to conclusively determine the role of cPLA2, particularly with stimuli that do not mobilize calcium. Resident peritoneal macrophages from cPLA2-deficient mice were used to evaluate the role of cPLA2 in mediating arachidonic acid release and eicosanoid production induced by A23187, PMA, okadaic acid, and zymosan. As shown in Fig. 1, arachidonic acid release induced by all these agonists was quantitatively suppressed in macrophages derived from cPLA2-deficient mice compared with cells from wild type mice. PMA was the only agonist that induced a small but consistent release of arachidonic acid in cPLA2-deficient cells, approximately 20% of the response observed in wild type cells. PGE2 production was nearly completely abolished in cPLA2-deficient macrophages in response to A23187, PMA, zymosan, and okadaic acid. Macrophages from wild type mice produced significant amounts of LTC4 in response to the calcium-mobilizing agonists A23187 and zymosan, and this was quantitatively suppressed in cPLA2-deficient cells. Only a small amount of LTC4 was produced in response to PMA, and none was produced in response to okadaic acid, which is not unexpected because of the requirement of 5-lipoxygenase for calcium (32.Rouzer C.A. Kargman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 22: 10980-10988Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 33.Samuelsson B. Dhalen S.-E. Lindgren J.A. Rouzer C.A. Serhan C.N.

These results show that cPLA2 is required for arachidonic acid release and eicosanoid production induced by A23187, PMA, zymosan, and okadaic acid in macrophages and confirm that cPLA2-mediated arachidonic acid release can be induced in cells without an increase in intracellular calcium. Other responses known to be triggered by PMA and zymosan in wild type macrophages were measured in cPLA2-deficient macrophages (Fig. 2). The activation of NADPH oxidase (superoxide anion production) and phospholipase D (phosphatidylethanol production) induced by PMA and zymosan were similar in cells from cPLA2-deficient mice as compared with wild type mice, indicating that cPLA2-deficient macrophages are responsive to these two agonists. It has been suggested that cPLA2 is required for the activation of NADPH oxidase in human myeloid PLB-985 cells (34.Dana R. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that activation of phospholipase D2 in mouse lymphocytic leukemia L1210 cells is dependent on cPLA2 activation (35.Kim J.H. Lee B.D. Kim Y. Lee S.D. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5462-5470PubMed Google Scholar). However, the results presented here demonstrate that cPLA2 is not involved in the activation of these enzymes by PMA or zymosan in mouse peritoneal macrophages. PMA, zymosan, and okadaic acid have previously been shown to induce sustained ERK activation and phosphorylation of cPLA2 on Ser-505 (24.Qiu Z.-H. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19480-19487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Qiu Z.-H. Gijón M.A. de Carvalho M.S. Spencer D.M. Leslie C.C. J. Biol.

This phosphorylation event in itself is not sufficient for arachidonic acid release, although agonists that activate ERKs can act synergistically with agonists that transiently increase intracellular calcium (17.Lin L.-L.

However, the role of Ser-505 phosphorylation in the activation of cPLA2 by agonists that do not mobilize calcium is not known. The role of the ERK pathway was investigated using MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitors, which prevent activation of ERKs. The various agonists used in this study act by different mechanisms, and the times required for their activation of ERK and arachidonic acid release vary considerably (23.Qiu Z.-H. de Carvalho M.S. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24506-24513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Qiu Z.-H. Leslie C.C. J. Biol.

Therefore, different times of stimulation were used for each agonist in these experiments to ensure maximal activation of ERKs and maximal Ser-505 phosphorylation: 15 min for A23187 and PMA, 30 min for zymosan, and 90 min for okadaic acid. In preliminary experiments comparing PD98059 and U0126, only the latter was found to be effective at quantitatively inhibiting the strong ERK activation induced by PMA, zymosan, and okadaic acid in mouse peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 3 A and data not shown). This is consistent with the fact that U0126 has a 100-fold higher affinity than PD98059 for MEK1 (37.Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar). U0126 specifically inhibits MEK1 and MEK2, the kinases that phosphorylate and activate ERKs, with very little effect on other MAPK kinases (37.Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig.3 A, U0126 at concentrations of 1–10 μmsuppressed ERK activation in response to A23187, PMA, zymosan, and okadaic acid. The effect of U0126 on Ser-505 phosphorylation of cPLA2 was evaluated by determining the retardation in the electrophoretic mobility (gel shift) of cPLA2. Of the four known phosphorylation sites on cPLA2, only phosphorylation on Ser-505 leads to a gel shift (16.Gijón M.A. Spencer D.M. Kaiser A.L. Leslie C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 17.Lin L.-L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J.

PMA, zymosan, and okadaic acid induced stoichiometric phosphorylation of cPLA2 on Ser-505, whereas the gel shift induced by A23187 was only partial, consistent with a weak activation of ERKs (Fig. 3 B). Despite the significant inhibition of ERK activation, zymosan-induced phosphorylation of cPLA2 on Ser-505 was only slightly prevented by 0.1–10 μm U0126. The cPLA2 gel shift induced by PMA and okadaic acid was unaffected by 0.1–1 μm U0126 and only slightly inhibited by 10 μm U0126. The partial A23187-induced cPLA2gel shift was suppressed by 0.1–10 μm U0126. The effect of U0126 on agonist-induced arachidonic acid release is shown in Fig.3 C. Inhibiting the ERK pathway had no effect on A23187-induced arachidonic acid release, as described previously (25.Qiu Z.-H. Gijón M.A. de Carvalho M.S. Spencer D.M. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8203-8211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In contrast, in macrophages stimulated with zymosan, PMA, or okadaic acid, 10 μm U0126 significantly inhibited arachidonic acid release (by 65%, 90% and 99%, respectively). There was a direct correlation between the concentrations of U0126 that inhibited ERK activation and arachidonic acid release, suggesting that activation of the MEK/ERK pathway plays a critical role in regulating arachidonic acid release in macrophages in response to zymosan, PMA, and okadaic acid. Surprisingly, inhibition of arachidonic acid release occurred at concentrations of U0126 that had very little or no effect on the phosphorylation of cPLA2 on Ser-505. These data indicate that the MEK/ERK pathway regulates cPLA2-mediated arachidonic acid release through an unknown mechanism in addition to phosphorylation of Ser-505. The effects of MEK inhibition shown in Fig. 3 were investigated using macrophages from ICR mice, whereas the wild type and cPLA2-deficient macrophages used in the experiments shown in Figs. 1 and 2 were obtained from C57BL/6 mice, which are deficient in secreted PLA2"

https://openalex.org/W1633042224,"Fibrates are a group of hypolipidemic agents that efficiently lower serum triglyceride levels by affecting the expression of many genes involved in lipid metabolism. These effects are exerted via the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha). In addition, fibrates also lower serum cholesterol levels, suggesting a possible link between the PPARalpha and cholesterol metabolism. Bile acid formation represents an important pathway for elimination of cholesterol, and the sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase is a branch-point enzyme in the bile acid biosynthetic pathway, which determines the ratio of cholic acid to chenodeoxycholic acid. Treatment of mice for 1 week with the peroxisome proliferator WY-14,643 or fasting for 24 h both induced the sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase mRNA in liver. Using the PPARalpha knockout mouse model, we show that the induction by both treatments was dependent on the PPARalpha. A reporter plasmid containing a putative peroxisome proliferator-response element (PPRE) identified in the rat sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase promoter region was activated by treatment with WY-14,643 in HepG2 cells, being dependent on co-transfection with a PPARalpha expression plasmid. The rat 12alpha-hydroxylase PPRE bound in vitro translated PPARalpha and retinoid X receptor alpha, albeit weakly, in electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Treatment of wild-type mice with WY-14,643 for 1 week resulted in an increased relative amount of cholic acid, an effect that was abolished in the PPARalpha null mice, verifying the functionality of the PPRE in vivo."

Studies of rats with cancer or sepsis or normal rats treated with cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6) raise the possibility that inflammatory cytokines could be involved in initiating muscle catabolism (reviewed in Ref. 10.Chang H.R. Bistrian B. J. Parenter. Enteral Nutr. 1998; 22: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Metabolic acidosis is another condition that activates the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in muscle, but the intracellular pH in the muscle of acidotic rats is only minimally lowered (3.Mitch W.E.

Insulin can also regulate protein degradation in muscle because conditions associated with a low insulin level (e.g. acute diabetes and fasting) stimulate protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (5.Price S.R.

Binding reactions contained 0.5–0.9 ng of 32P-labeled annealed oligonucleotide (105 dpm), 5 μg of nuclear proteins, 10 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, and 2 μg of poly(dI·dC) and were incubated at 20 °C for 20 min. When competitor DNA or antibodies (e.g.polyclonal antibodies that recognize NF-κB p65; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were included in the binding reaction, the reactions without labeled DNA were incubated at 20 °C for 20 min; after the 32P-labeled DNA probe was added, the reactions were incubated for an additional 20 min at 20 °C. Reaction products were separated in 2.5% glycerol, 4% polyacrylamide gels with a buffer containing 44.5 mm Tris, 44.5 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA. L6 cells were grown to confluence, and the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum; when glucocorticoids were studied, cells were incubated with dexamethasone (50 nm). Control and treated cells were lysed, and nuclear protein extracts were prepared according to Dignam et al.(26.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9163) Google Scholar); the supernatant obtained after sedimenting the intact nuclei was used as the source of cytosolic proteins. Nuclear and/or cytosolic proteins (20 μg of protein/lane) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a 10% acrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The polyclonal antibodies used to detect IκB-α or NF-κB p65 subunit proteins were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Western blots were reacted with a 1:5000 dilution of primary antibody and a 1:10,000 dilution of a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody; blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence technology. To compare the levels of proteasome C3 subunit protein in control and dexamethasone-treated L6 muscle cells (50 nm, 24 h), cells were lysed in Laemmli sample buffer, and total cell protein (20 μg of protein/lane) was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% polyacrylamide). Western blots were reacted with a 1:13,000 dilution of a primary mouse monoclonal antibody against the human proteasome C3 subunit ( (27.Haire M.F. Clark J.J. Jones M.E.E. Hendil K.B. Schwartz L.M. Mykles D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) this antibody was prepared by Dr. K. Hendil, University of Copenhagen and was a gift from Dr. D. Mykles, Colorado State University). Afterwards, the C3 subunit was detected as described for the components of the NF-κB pathway. Earlier, we found that protein degradation in BC3H1 myocytes was minimally increased by acidification or glucocorticoids, but with both signals, protein degradation was increased significantly (15.Isozaki Y. Mitch W.E. England B.K. Price S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 97: 1967-1971Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The weak response in BC3H1 cells may be related in part to their low level of glucocorticoid responsiveness compared with L6 skeletal muscle cells (15.Isozaki Y. Mitch W.E. England B.K. Price S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 97: 1967-1971Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In L6 cells, we found that either extracellular acidification or dexamethasone (50 nm) significantly stimulated protein degradation (p < 0.02 versus control cells) but acidification plus glucocorticoid increased proteolysis the most (p < 0.05 versus other treatments; Fig.1 A). An equimolar concentration of the steroid receptor antagonist RU486 blocked the proteolytic response to dexamethasone (data not shown). We studied the proteasome C3 subunit as a representative component of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway because it is an α-subunit of the core proteolytic complex, and its transcription is increased in rat muscle by chronic uremia and acute diabetes (4.Bailey J.L. Wang X. England B.K. Price S.R. Ding X. Mitch W.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1447-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 6.Mitch W.E. Bailey J.L. Wang X. Jurkovitz C. Newby D. Price S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1132-C1138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that dexamethasone increased the amounts of both C3 subunit mRNA and protein ∼2-fold (Fig. 1, B and C). Using nuclear run-off assays, we determined that dexamethasone increased transcription of the C3 subunit gene nearly 2-fold but not the gene encoding GAPDH (Fig. 1 D). Thus, glucocorticoids induce the expression of at least one component of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in L6 cells in a manner similar to conditions associated with increased corticosterone production and muscle wasting in rats (4.Bailey J.L. Wang X. England B.K. Price S.R. Ding X. Mitch W.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1447-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 5.Price S.R. Bailey J.L. Wang X. Jurkovitz C. England B.K. Ding X.

Physiol. 1999; 276: C1132-C1138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine how glucocorticoids stimulate transcription of the proteasome C3 subunit, we transfected L6 cells with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the −460/+1 human C3 promoter fragment (+1 corresponds to the transcription start site) ligated to a firefly luciferase reporter gene (pC3–460). The transfected cells were incubated with dexamethasone (50 nm) for 48 h, which increased luciferase activity 2.9 ± 0.2-fold (p< 0.05) compared with untreated, transfected cells (Fig.2 A). This increase in luciferase activity was blocked when RU486 was added (118 ± 9% of the activity in control cells; p = not significant); RU486 alone did not change reporter enzyme activity (105 ± 11% of luciferase activity in untreated cells; p = not significant). To localize the glucocorticoid-responsive region of the C3 promoter, plasmids with shorter segments of the promoter sequence linked to the luciferase reporter gene were constructed. Shortening the promoter fragment to −400/+1(pC3–400) did not prevent the induction of luciferase activity by dexamethasone, whereas trimming the promoter region to −256/+1 (pC3–256) abolished the dexamethasone response (Fig. 2 A). The region of the C3 promoter between −400 and −256 does not contain a canonical glucocorticoid-response element but there are two elements similar to a consensus c-rel/NF-κB element: the downstream element (NF-κB(d)) is in a forward orientation, whereas the upstream element (NF-κB(u)) is in an inverted orientation (Fig. 2 B). The functional importance of NF-κB(u) in the dexamethasone response was investigated by replacing the base sequence of this site (−322/−313) with an unrelated sequence, while leaving the adjacent sequences unchanged in pC3–460 (pC3ΔNFκB(u)). In cells transfected with pC3ΔNFκB(u), basal luciferase activity was not statistically different from the activity from cells transfected with an equal amount of pC3–460 (data not shown). Dexamethasone treatment did not increase luciferase activity in cells transfected with pC3ΔNFκB(u) (Fig. 2 A) indicating that the distal inverted c-rel/NF-κB sequence is necessary for the induction of C3 subunit transcription by glucocorticoids. To address how NF-κB(u) could be involved in the response to glucocorticoids, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using a NF-κB(u) DNA probe and protein extracts from nuclei isolated from control cells or cells treated with dexamethasone. Unexpectedly, we found an abundant nuclear protein(s) in extracts from untreated L6 muscle cells that complexed with the NF-κB(u) probe (Fig.3 A). Treatment of L6 cells with dexamethasone reduced the amount of protein bound to NF-κB(u) in a time-dependent fashion (Fig.3 A); the maximal decrease in protein binding occurred within 90 min of adding dexamethasone. Notably, the amount of the protein·NF-κB(u) complex remained low when cells were treated for 24 h with a single dose of dexamethasone indicating that the effect of glucocorticoids was sustained. The interaction between the protein and NF-κB(u) was specific because a 100-fold excess of either the unlabeled NF-κB(u) probe or a probe corresponding to the immunoglobulin κ light chain gene NF-κB consensus site prevented the formation of the protein·DNA complex (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, anti-Rel A (p65) polyclonal antibodies induced a supershift in the mobility of the protein·NF-κB(u) complex confirming that the protein complex contains a member of the NF-κB family (Fig.4). Therefore, dexamethasone appears to increase C3 subunit expression by preventing activated NF-κB from binding to NF-κB(u).Figure 4p65/Rel A protein binds to NF-κB(u). Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from untreated, control L6 cells, and EMSA was performed as described in Fig. 3 A except that nuclear proteins were incubated with an antibody against the Rel A (p65) NF-κB subunit for 20 min before initiating the binding reaction with a labeled NF-κB(u) probe. In the figure, B andU indicate the positions of the protein·DNA complex and unbound DNA probe, respectively. This experiment was performed twice and the outcome was the same.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To verify there is abundant activated NF-κB in untreated L6 cells, nuclear protein extracts from untreated cells were incubated with a DNA probe corresponding to the immunoglobulin κ light chain NF-κB binding site (Ig NF-κB) (28.Schreck R. Meier B. Mannel D.N. Droge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). A protein-Ig κ chain NF-κB DNA probe complex was detected, and dexamethasone reduced the amount of this complex in a manner similar to the NF-κB(u) probe (Fig. 5). If NF-κB acts to suppress C3 subunit transcription, then reducing the intracellular level of “activated” NF-κB should increase the basal C3 promoter activity (i.e. luciferase activity), and dexamethasone should induce even higher promoter activity. Conversely, raising activated NF-κB should suppress C3 subunit promoter activity, and the response to dexamethasone should be blunted. To address the first possibility, cells were cotransfected with pC3–460 and pCMV IκB(K21R/K22R), an expression plasmid encoding a dominant negative form of IκBα because of mutations that prevent conjugation of ubiquitin to it and hence, its degradation by the proteasome (25.Scherer D.C. Brockman J.A. Chen Z. Maniatis T. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11259-11263Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Other cells were cotransfected with pC3–460 and pCMV IκB(S32A/S36A) to express another dominant negative form of IκBα in which serine is replaced by alanine in amino acid positions 32 and 36 to prevent phosphorylation of IκB by IκB kinase (25.Scherer D.C. Brockman J.A. Chen Z. Maniatis T. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11259-11263Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with either type of dominant negative IκBα plasmid had a higher basal luciferase activity compared with cells transfected with pC3–460 alone (Fig. 6). When dexamethasone was added, luciferase activity from the cells cotransfected with pC3–460 and the mutant IκBα plasmids was higher than from the cells transfected with pC3–460 alone. We also examined the influence of an inhibitor of NF-κB activation (100 μm pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (28.Schreck R. Meier B. Mannel D.N. Droge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar)) on C3 subunit expression and found that luciferase activity in L6 cells transfected with pC3–460 was 2.57 ± 0.55-fold higher (p < 0.05). Thus, blocking NF-κB activation stimulates C3 subunit transcription. To determine if increasing the amount of activated NF-κB would suppress C3 subunit transcription, L6 cells were cotransfected with pC3–460 and plasmids encoding either p65 (pCMV-p65) or a p50/p65 chimeric protein composed of the DNA binding domain of p50 and the carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain of p65 of NF-κB (pCMV-p50/65 (24.Ruben S.M. Narayanan R. Klement J.F. Chen C.H. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 444-454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). In both cases, the basal C3 promoter activity was below the activity measured in cells transfected with pC3–460 alone (Fig. 6); with dexamethasone, the increase in luciferase activity was sharply blunted compared with cells transfected with pC3–460 alone (Fig. 6). When the ratio of pCMV-p65 to pC3–460 during transfection was increased 5-fold, the basal luciferase activity was unchanged compared with cells transfected with the lower concentration of pCMV-p65, but dexamethasone no longer increased reporter activity (Fig. 6). Finally, we incubated L6 cells that had been transfected with pC3–460 with a mixture of cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, and lipopolysaccharide) for 24 h to raise the level of endogenous activated NF-κB. This treatment increased the binding of NF-κB to the NF-κB(u) probe, and basal luciferase activity was reduced by 48 ± 5% (p < 0.05 versusuntreated, transfected cells; Fig. 7,A and B). As shown before, dexamethasone increased luciferase activity in cells transfected with pC3–460. To determine if the endogenous proteasome C3 subunit gene also responds to cytokines, we incubated L6 cells with dexamethasone (50 nm) and/or the mixture of cytokines for 12 h and measured the amount of C3 subunit mRNA. Dexamethasone increased C3 subunit mRNA 76% compared with untreated, control cells, whereas incubating cells with the cytokine mixture decreased this mRNA 42% (Fig. 7 C). The cytokine mixture plus dexamethasone increased the level of C3 subunit mRNA 62%. GAPDH mRNA was unchanged by these treatments (Fig. 7 C). We conclude that the endogenous rat proteasome C3 subunit gene responds to NF-κB in a manner consistent with the artificial human C3 promoter-reporter genes and that glucocorticoids block the suppressive effect of activated NF-κB. A key question is how do glucocorticoids oppose NF-κB binding to NF-κB(u)? If activated glucocorticoid receptors directly interfere with NF-κB binding, then it would seem that the incubation time required for dexamethasone to produce a decrease in the amount of protein·NF-κB(u) complex (detected by mobility shift assays) is slow (>20 min). Therefore, we examined another potential mechanism, namely that dexamethasone induces cytosolic sequestration of the NF-κB protein. We measured the amount of NF-κB p65 subunit protein in nuclear and cytosolic fractions from control L6 muscle cells and cells treated with dexamethasone. Although the amount of nuclear p65 subunit detected in dexamethasone-treated cells was not significantly reduced relative to untreated cells, the amount of p65 protein in the cytosol was increased within 30 min of the addition of dexamethasone (Fig. 8 A). Dexamethasone treatment for as little as 30 min also increased the amount of cytosolic IκB-α (Fig. 8 B). A final issue we addressed was whether acidification and glucocorticoids act through similar mechanisms to stimulate the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The level of C3 subunit mRNA in control L6 muscle cells was compared with the level in cells that were acidified (pH 7.1) or cells incubated with dexamethasone at pH 7.1 or 7.4. Acidification plus dexamethasone increased C3 subunit mRNA more than either stimulus alone (data not shown). These results are similar to those we reported for ubiquitin and the proteasome C2 subunit mRNAs in BC3H1 cells (15.Isozaki Y. Mitch W.E. England B.K. Price S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 97: 1967-1971Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We then determined if acidification alone stimulates the C3 promoter by acting at the NF-κB(u) site; L6 cells were transfected with either pC3–460 or pC3ΔNFκB(u)(containing an unrelated linker sequence instead of NF-κB(u)) and then incubating the cells at pH 7.4 or 7.1. In cells transfected with pC3–460, acidification increased luciferase activity from 46.9 ± 3 luminescence units in control cells (pH 7.4) to 114.3 ± 9.0 units (p < 0.05). Similar results were obtained when cells were transfected with pC3ΔNFκB(u) (39.7 ± 3.3 at pH 7.4versus 135.6 ± 14.6 at pH 7.1; p < 0.05). Muscle atrophy in animal models of catabolic illnesses has been shown repeatedly to result from increased protein degradation because of activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (1.Mitch W.E. Goldberg A.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 325: 1897-1905Crossref Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). Concurrent with induction of this proteolytic pathway, there is increased transcription of its component genes in muscle suggesting that the two responses are linked. However, the complexity of animal models makes it difficult to identify specific signals initiating these responses. Our results in L6 muscle cells show that glucocorticoids increase the expression of the proteasome C3 subunit protein. Surprisingly, the mechanism involves antagonism of a transcriptional suppression imposed by constitutively active NF-κB. We also document that acidification, another stimulus that increases proteolysis in L6 cells, acts through a different mechanism because mutating the NF-κB(u) site that is required for dexamethasone-induced stimulation of the human C3 promoter did not prevent its induction by acidification. There were several unexpected findings in our studies. First, acis-acting element at position −322 (i.e.NF-κB(u)) in the upstream promoter region of the human C3 proteasome confers glucocorticoid sensitivity, but this site is homologous to a classical NF-κB binding site rather than a glucocorticoid response element. Induction of C3 subunit expression by glucocorticoids is mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor because the receptor antagonist, RU486, blocked the transcriptional response. Secondly, our results indicate that NF-κB(u) acts as a negative transcriptional regulatory element. This finding was unanticipated, but it does provide an explanation for the report of Tamura et al. (23.Tamura T. Osaka F. Kawamura Y. Higuti T. Ishida N. Nothwang H.-G. Tsurumi C. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 224: 117-124Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar) that an unidentified negative transcriptional element is located in the −439 to −256 region of the human C3 promoter region. Lastly, the protein that binds to NF-κB(u) in the C3 subunit gene is abundant in untreated L6 cells. This protein is a member of the NF-κB family (i.e. it was recognized by an anti-p65/Rel A antibody in mobility shift assays), and it appears to be a constitutively active suppressor of C3 subunit transcription in muscle cells. This was a surprise because NF-κB is typically an inducible transactivator that is inactive in the cytosol because of binding with the IκB inhibitor protein. Are these studies with artificial C3 promoter-luciferase reporter chimeric genes relevant to the regulation of the endogenous C3 subunit gene in L6 cells? We believe they are because incubation of L6 cells with a cytokine mixture (to increase activated NF-κB (29.Sen C.K. Khanna S. Reznick A.Z. Roy S. Packer A.Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 237: 645-649Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 30.Bédard S. Marcotte B. Marette A. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 467-493Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar)): 1) raised the amount of NF-κB that binds to the NF-κB(u)probe and 2) decreased the amount of C3 subunit mRNA. Conversely, dexamethasone increased both the endogenous C3 subunit mRNA and the C3 promoter-driven luciferase activity. How do glucocorticoids decrease the binding of NF-κB to NF-κB(u) in the C3 proteasome subunit promoter? We found that dexamethasone increased the cytosolic level of IκBα, which appears to sequester NF-κB in the cytosol and prevent it from translocating into the nucleus and binding to NF-κB(u). Mechanisms that could raise the cytosolic level of IκBα include increased synthesis or reduced degradation of this protein. Others have reported that activated glucocorticoid receptors can block the interaction of NF-κB with its DNA target sequence by preventing NF-κB binding or antagonizing its transactivation function through direct protein-protein interactions (31.Liden J. Delaunay F. Rafter I. Gustafsson J.-Å. Okret S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21467-21472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 32.De Bosscher K. Schmitz M.L. Berghe W.V.

Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 943-953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although we cannot exclude such actions by glucocorticoid receptors in L6 muscle cells, they seem unlikely because we did not detect protein·NF-κB(u) complexes exhibiting mobilities different from the NF-κB·NF-κB(u) complex in mobility shift assays performed with nuclear proteins from L6 cells treated with dexamethasone. In summary, we have provided evidence for an important function of NF-κB in the transcriptional regulation of at least one component of the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway in muscle. It is tempting to speculate that NF-κB regulates the transcription of other components of this pathway similarly because several of these genes have potential NF-κB-like binding sites in their promoter regions. These results also conclusively demonstrate that catabolic stimuli can increase the expression and amounts of components of the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway. Finally, our results suggest novel mechanisms by which signals like acidification and glucocorticoids influence transcription of components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and therefore, protein degradation in muscle.

https://openalex.org/W1963723016,"Hydrogen peroxide is a component of cigarette smoke known to be essential for inactivation of α1-antitrypsin, the primary inhibitor of neutrophil elastase. To establish the molecular basis of the inactivation of α1-antitrypsin, we determined the sites oxidized by hydrogen peroxide. Two of the nine methionines were particularly susceptible to oxidation. One was methionine 358, whose oxidation was known to cause loss of anti-elastase activity. The other, methionine 351, was as susceptible to oxidation as methionine 358. Its oxidation also resulted in loss of anti-elastase activity, an effect not previously recognized. The equal susceptibility of methionine 358 and methionine 351 to oxidation was confirmed by mass spectrometry. To verify this finding, we produced recombinant α1-antitrypsins in which one or both of the susceptible methionines were mutated to valine. M351V and M358V were not as rapidly inactivated as wild-type α1-antitrypsin, but only the double mutant M351V/M358V was markedly resistant to oxidative inactivation. We suggest that inactivation of α1-antitrypsin by oxidation of either methionine 351 or 358 provides a mechanism for regulation of its activity at sites of inflammation."

This paper further characterizes the time course and pattern of NHE3 phosphorylation in OK cells in response to PTH.It is presently unclear how phosphorylation of NHE3 alters its transport activity. One mechanism that has been shown to alter acutely NHE3 transport activity is the change in cell surface protein abundance. This has been demonstrated in cultured cells (46D'Souza S.

Two studies have shown that acute infusion of PTH leads to a decrease in proximal tubule apical membrane NHE3 using immunohistochemistry (53Zhang Y. Norian J.M. Magyar C.E. Holstein-Rathlou N.H.

It is unclear whether this acute decrement in apical membrane NHE3 is due to decreased exocytic insertion, endocytotic internalization, or both. Studies in rat kidney suggest that acute changes in apical membrane NHE3 abundance is microtubule-dependent (26Fan L. Wiederkehr M.R. Collazo R. Huang H. Crowder L.A. Moe O.W. J. Biol.

There is evidence in cell culture that NHE3 is recycled via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent mechanisms (46D'Souza S. Garcia-Cabado A., Yu, F. Teter K. Lukacs G. Skorecki K. Moore H.P.

Woodside M. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37551-37558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Full expression of NHE3 activity is dependent on the integrity of the cytoskeleton, and NHE3 co-sediments with the actin cytoskeleton (55Kurashima K. D'Souza S. Szászi K. Ramjeessingh R. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29843-29849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This study will define some of the mechanisms by which PTH acutely decreases surface NHE3 in a renal epithelial cell.DISCUSSIONWhen parathyroidectomized rats received an acute infusion of PTH, a biphasic response was seen when early (1–2 h) inhibition of NHE3 activity was accompanied by increased NHE3 phosphorylation and later (>2 h) inhibition was associated with decreased apical membrane NHE3 antigen (26Fan L. Wiederkehr M.R. Collazo R. Huang H. Crowder L.A. Moe O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11289-11295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). More detailed definition of this dual response is difficult in intact animals. In OK cells, a similar biphasic response was observed with slightly different kinetics. The reasons for the disparity is unclear but likely relates to differences between intact animals where multiple factors can mediate and modulate the acute PTH response and in cell culture where a pure PTH effect is seen. The timing of agonist delivery and exposure may also differ as the PTH was given intravenously in the whole animal, whereas cells were exposed instantly to the desired concentration. Nonetheless, the biphasic response of regulation is clearly present in OK cells and thus provides a model for further study of the mechanism of the response.Early inhibition of NHE3 activity by PTH is associated with increased NHE3 phosphorylation on multiple serines on the cytoplasmic domain of NHE3. Phosphorylation of multiple cytoplasmic serines on NHE3 has been described with PKA activation in fibroblasts transfected with NHE3 (39Moe O.W. Amemiya M. Yamaji Y. J. Clin.

In both OK cells and in the intact animal treated with PTH, changes in NHE3 phosphorylation and activity follow the same time course. This finding further supports the importance of phosphorylation in NHE3 functional regulation. The kinases involved in the inhibition for NHE3 by PTH has been controversial with current data suggesting a dual PKA/PKC pathway (29Moran A. Montrose M.H. Murer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 969: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 30Helmle-Kolb C. Montrose M.H. Murer H.

In this study, NHE3 phosphorylation was completely blocked by the PKA inhibitor H89 and NHE3 phosphorylation pattern from cells treated with PTH or 8-Br-cAMP were identical when compared side-by-side. This strongly suggests that the PTH-induced phosphorylation of NHE3 is mediated by PKA. In the whole animal only PKA-activating PTH peptides were competent in inducing NHE3 trafficking (53Zhang Y. Norian J.M. Magyar C.E. Holstein-Rathlou N.H. Mircheff A.K. McDonough A.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F711-F719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this does not rule out a contributory role for PKC since PKC activation can alter NHE3 activity by mechanisms independent of changes in NHE3 phosphorylation (41Yip J.W. Ko W.H. Viberti G. Huganir R.L. Donowitz M. Tse C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18473-18480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 44Wiederkehr M.R. Zhao H. Moe O.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1205-C1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There was a trend toward lesser total cellular NHE3 whole protein phosphorylation at 30 min but the phospho content was still higher than control. We did not specifically examine surface protein phosphorylation in this study. It is possible that there may be some reversal of surface NHE3 phosphorylation at 30 min. The small but statistically insignificant inhibition by PTH at 30 min when dynamin was inhibited is also compatible with reversal of modification of surface NHE3.Similar to the data from rat renal cortex, the immediate inhibition of NHE3 in OK cells was not accompanied by changes in surface NHE3 antigen. The inability of dominant negative dynamin to block the early inhibition further supports the notion that changes in NHE3 intrinsic activity may mediate the immediate inhibition. Numerous examples in either native membrane vesicles or reconstituted proteoliposomes where there is no possible NHE3 trafficking have shown regulation of transport activity (38Moe O.W. J. Am. Soc.

https://openalex.org/W2090949880,"Cell shrinkage and loss of intracellular K+ are early requisite features for the activation of effector caspases and apoptotic nucleases in Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis of Jurkat cells, although the mechanisms responsible for both process remain unclear (Bortner, C. D., Hughes, F. M., Jr., and Cidlowski, J. A. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 32436–32442). We have now investigated the role of protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent signaling in the regulation of Fas-induced cell shrinkage and loss of K+ during apoptosis. Anti-Fas induced cell shrinkage was blocked during PKC stimulation by the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-3-acetate (PMA) and by bryostatin-1. Conversely, inhibition of PKC with Go6976, enhanced the anti-Fas-mediated loss of cell volume. Analyses of mitochondrial membrane potential and DNA fragmentation revealed that the PKC-mediated effect observed in cell volume is propagated to these late features of apoptosis. Flow cytometric analyses and86Rb efflux experiments revealed that a primary effect of PKC appears to be on the modulation of Fas-induced K+efflux, since both PMA and bryostatin-1 inhibited extrusion of K+ that occurs during Fas-mediated cell death, and Go6976 exacerbated the effect of anti-Fas. Interestingly, high extracellular K+ significantly blocked the effect of anti-Fas alone or anti-Fas combined with Go6976, suggesting an underlying effect of PKC on K+ loss. Western blot analyses showed the caspase-dependent proteolysis of PKC isotypes δ, e, and θ in whole cell extracts from anti-Fas treated Jurkat T cells. However, stimulation of PKC by PMA or bryostatin-1 prevented this isotypic-specific PKC cleavage during apoptosis, providing further evidence that PKC itself exerts an upstream signal in apoptosis and controls the caspase-dependent proteolytic degradation of PKC isotypes. Finally, we show that PMA or bryostatin-1 prevents the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-8. Thus, this study shows that the protective effect that PKC stimulation exerts in the Fas-mediated apoptotic pathway occurs at a site upstream of caspases-3 and -8."

Although several different EGF-like ligands are capable of binding to a single ErbB family member, it is generally thought that the biological and biochemical responses of a single receptor dimer to different ligands are indistinguishable. To test whether an ErbB receptor dimer is capable of discriminating among ligands we have examined the effect of four EGF-like growth factors on signaling through the ErbB4 receptor homodimer in CEM/HER4 cells, a transfected human T cell line ectopically expressing ErbB4 in an ErbB-null background. Despite stimulating similar levels of gross receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, the EGF-like growth factors betacellulin, neuregulin-1β, neuregulin-2β, and neuregulin-3 exhibited different biological potencies in a cellular growth assay. Moreover, the different ligands induced different patterns of recruitment of intracellular signaling proteins to the activated receptor and induced differential usage of intracellular kinase signaling cascades. Finally, two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of ligand-stimulated ErbB4 revealed that the different growth factors induce different patterns of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. These results indicate that ErbB4 activation by growth factors is not generic and suggest that individual ErbB receptors can discriminate between different EGF-like ligands within the context of a single receptor dimer.

The mammalian ErbB signaling network, consisting of four known receptor tyrosine kinases and more than ten epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factor ligands, serves as a model for understanding how RTKs translate ligand binding into cellular response (1.Moghal N. Sternberg P.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Numerous studies point to a role for receptor dimerization in the stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinase activity by growth factors (2.Heldin C.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). Moreover, because the ten different ErbB receptor homo- and heterodimeric pairs are capable of mediating different cellular responses, dimerization also appears to be involved in signal specification (3.Riese D.J., II Stern D.F. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 4.Carraway III, K.L. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Specification is thought to arise from differences in the intrinsic abilities of each of the different tyrosine phosphorylated ErbB receptors to recruit and activate specific src homology-2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain-containing intracellular signaling proteins (4.Carraway III, K.L. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 5.Alroy I. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). The ErbB signaling network model emphasizes that it is the identity of the receptor dimer that dictates the ultimate cellular response and makes no provisions for a single receptor dimer to discriminate among ligands. In this study we examine the effects of several different ligands on cellular growth signaling in a cell line expressing a single member of the ErbB family. We observed that different ligands are capable of inducing different biological and biochemical responses, indicating that an ErbB receptor homodimer is capable of discriminating among its binding ligands. CEM/HER4 cells were from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Seattle, WA. Recombinant human betacellulin was purchased from R & D Systems. GST fusion proteins of the EGF-like domains of mouse NRG1β and NRG2β were produced, purified, and handled as described previously (6.Carraway III, K.L. Weber J.L. Unger M.J. Ledesma J., Yu, N.

GST·NRG-3 was produced by first amplifying the region corresponding to the EGF-like domain from a full-length NRG-3 cDNA clone obtained by screening a mouse C57Bl/6 lZAP cDNA library. 2C. Lai, unpublished observation. The region selected includes the 10 amino acids amino-terminal to the first cysteine residue of the NRG-3 EGF-like domain (primer sequence corresponds to the amino acid sequence STERSEHF) and ends with the sequence ESEDVYQR, which immediately precedes the predicted transmembrane domain. The resulting fragment was subcloned into theEcoRI/BamHI sites of pAcSecG2T (PharMingen). Subsequent steps were identical to those used in the preparation of GST·NRG-1β and GST·NRG-2β, as described previously (6.Carraway III, K.L. Weber J.L. Unger M.J. Ledesma J., Yu, N. Gassmann M.

Antibodies to phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of p38, JNK, ERK1/2, and Akt were from New England Biolabs. MTT, soybean trypsin inhibitor immobilized on Sepharose, and TPCK-treated trypsin were from Sigma. Cells were maintained in RPMI/10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (ΔFBS) containing 0.2 mg/ml G418 and split upon reaching a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. For immunoprecipitation experiments cells were pelleted at 500 × g, resuspended in an equal volume of RPMI/0.1% ΔFBS, and serum-starved for 16 h. Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in RPMI/0.1% ΔFBS at a density of 4 × 107 cells/ml, and 0.5 ml was diluted into 0.5 ml of 100 nm growth factor in RPMI/0.1% ΔFBS at 37 °C. After 2 min cells were pelleted with a 15-s microfuge pulse (12,000 × g) and immediately resuspended in co-immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm ZnCl2, 10 mm glycerophosphate, 5 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 4 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin; see Ref. 7.Crovello C.S.

Precipitated proteins were resolved by 6–10% gradient SDS-PAGE, and the receptor region of filters blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine RC20. Filters were also probed with appropriate antibodies to precipitated proteins. For kinase activation experiments cells were treated with growth factors as described above, and at various times cells were diluted into 5× Laemmli sample buffer. Lysates corresponding to 1.5 × 106 cells were resolved by 5–7.5% gradient SDS-PAGE, and filters were blotted with antibodies recognizing activated kinases and then re-probed with antibodies recognizing the total kinase population. 1 × 108 cells were simultaneously serum-starved and radiolabeled for 4 h at 37 °C with 24 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate in 24 ml of phosphate-free RPMI. Cells were then treated with 50 nm growth factor for 2 min, and ErbB4 was immunoprecipitated from cleared lysates. Precipitates were resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose. The ErbB4 protein was digested from the nitrocellulose overnight using 10 μg of TPCK-treated trypsin, and trypsin was removed using 20 μl of immobilized soybean trypsin inhibitor. Phosphotyrosine-containing phosphopeptides were then immunopurified using a 1:1 mixture of immobilized anti-phosphotyrosine PY20 and PY99 antibodies and eluted with low pH values. Purified phosphopeptides were resolved electrophoretically in the first dimension and by thin layer chromatography in the second, according to established procedures (9.Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptides were visualized using a Storm phosphoimaging system. CEM/HER4 cells were pelleted, resuspended at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI/0.1% ΔFBS, and seeded into 96-well plates at 0.1 ml per well. Cells were serum-starved for 16 h and then treated with 50 nm growth factor and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. MTT in phosphate-buffered saline was then added to wells to a concentration of 1 mg/ml, and cells were incubated for another 3 h at 37 °C. Lysis solution (20% SDS in 50% N,N-dimethylformamide, pH 4.7) was added to 50%, and wells were incubated overnight at 37 °C. The absorbance at 570 nm was determined, and the absorbance of wells lacking cells was subtracted. To test whether a single ErbB receptor dimer is capable of distinguishing between different EGF-like growth factors, we examined the response of ErbB4 in CEM/HER4 cells to treatment with different ligands. CEM/HER4 is a human T cell line lacking endogenous ErbB receptor expression, as assessed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, 3G. D. Plowman, personal communication. that has been stably transfected with the cDNA encoding human ErbB4 (10.Plowman G.D. Green J.M. Culouscou J.M. Carlton G.W. Rothwell V.M. Buckley S. Nature. 1993; 366: 473-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). In the absence of other ErbB family members the only signaling receptor species in these cells is an ErbB4 homodimer. We assessed the biological and biochemical outcomes of treating these cells with the following four EGF-like ligands known to bind to and stimulate ErbB4: betacellulin (BTC), neuregulin-1β (NRG1β), neuregulin-2β (NRG2β), and neuregulin-3 (NRG3). All experiments were carried out using saturating levels of purified growth factors (50 nm) to overcome any differences in receptor binding affinity and to fully activate the ErbB4 receptor. We observed that the four growth factors examined stimulated similar levels of ErbB4 receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, as determined by immunoblotting anti-ErbB4 immunoprecipitates with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 1 A). No ErbB4 tyrosine phosphorylation was observed prior to growth factor treatment. Re-probing with an anti-ErbB4 antibody revealed similar levels of receptor in all five precipitates. In addition, covalent cross-linking experiments revealed that each growth factor induced similar levels of ErbB4 dimer (not shown). Despite their abilities to induce similar levels of gross receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, the four growth factors exhibited different biological potencies in the MTT colorimetric assay (Fig.1 B). Because the MTT assay measures mitochondrial activity, differences relative to untreated cells reflect both cell growth induced by growth factors and cell survival following serum starvation. Although none of the growth factors stimulated a response as robust as serum, probably because of the relatively low ErbB4 receptor content of the CEM/HER4 cells, NRG1β reproducibly exhibited a higher activity in the MTT assay than did the other factors. NRG1β was followed by BTC, NRG2β, and then NRG3. These observations indicate that gross receptor tyrosine phosphorylation as detected by anti-phosphotyrosine blotting does not closely correlate with biological activity, and suggest that an ErbB4 homodimer is capable of discriminating between its binding ligands in mediating biological activity. To address the biochemical mechanisms underlying the observed differences in biological potencies of the activating ligands we first examined the activation of intracellular kinase cascades associated with receptor stimulation. By immunoblotting with antibodies specific for activated (phosphorylated) forms of the signaling kinases Akt, JNK, p38, and ERK1/2, we observed that the different growth factors activated the kinases to different extents in the CEM/HER4 cells (Fig.2 A). None of the factors significantly stimulated either JNK or p38 phosphorylation (not shown). However, Akt and ERK1/2 appeared to be differentially activated in CEM/HER4 cells in response to the different growth factors. Specifically, NRG1β and NRG2β were the most potent in stimulating Akt, whereas BTC appeared to be the most potent in stimulating ERK1/2. Differences were due to the overall extent of kinase activation in response to the growth factors rather than to differences in the kinetics of activation (data not shown). Intracellular kinase cascades are triggered in response to the binding of specific SH2 and PTB domain-containing proteins to specific phosphorylated tyrosine residues in tail regions of activated ErbB receptors (4.Carraway III, K.L. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 5.Alroy I. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). To determine whether the differential recruitment of signaling proteins might account for the observed differences in signaling kinase activation we examined the association of five representative signaling molecules with ErbB4 in response to growth factor treatment. The signaling proteins examined were the adaptor proteins Grb2 and Shc, the tyrosine phosphatases SHP1 and SHP2, and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. In these experiments cells were treated with growth factors, signaling proteins were immunoprecipitated with their respective antibodies, and the receptor region of the gel was probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Because the different ligands stimulated similar extents of total receptor tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A), this method is suitable for assessing the extent of ErbB4 association with each signaling protein. No evidence for ligand-stimulated association of either of the phosphotyrosine phosphatases with ErbB4 was observed (not shown). However, whereas all four growth factors stimulated the recruitment of Grb2 to ErbB4 to similar extents, BTC and NRG1β preferentially stimulated the recruitment of Shc, and NRG1β and NRG2β preferentially stimulated the association of p85 (Fig. 2 B). Taken together, the results of Fig. 2 indicate that ligand discrimination by the ErbB4 receptor results in the differential stimulation of intracellular signaling cascades, possibly through the differential recruitment of intracellular SH2 and PTB domain-containing signaling proteins. Signaling proteins are thought to become recruited to phosphorylated tyrosine residues of activated receptor tyrosine kinases in a sequence-specific manner (11.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2370) Google Scholar, 12.van der Geer P. Pawson T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 277-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). For example, the SH2 domain of p85 binds to sites containing a methionine three residues carboxyl-terminal to the phosphorylated tyrosine, whereas the SH2 domain of Grb2 selects sites that have an asparagine two residues carboxyl-terminal to the phosphotyrosine. The PTB domain of Shc selects motifs containing the sequence NPXpY, where X is any amino acid and pY is the phosphorylated tyrosine residue. The selectivity patterns of SH2 and PTB domains suggest that the observed differential recruitment of intracellular signaling proteins may result from the differential phosphorylation of specific ErbB4 tyrosine residues in response to growth factor binding. To test this possibility we metabolically labeled CEM/HER4 cells with [32P]-orthophosphate and examined ErbB4 phosphorylation by two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping. Our current (not shown) and previous studies 4C. Sweeney and K. L. Carraway III, manuscript in preparation. indicate that ErbB receptors are very highly constitutively phosphorylated on numerous serine and threonine residues. This yields very complicated phosphopeptide maps that can mask ligand-stimulated differences in receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. For this reason we developed a method for enriching in the phosphotyrosine-containing tryptic peptides by affinity for two anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies prior to mapping (see “Experimental Procedures”). We observed that the different ligands induced different tyrosine-containing phosphopeptide patterns in ErbB4 (Fig.3). No phosphopeptides were observed after anti-phosphotyrosine purification when cells were not treated with growth factor. This is consistent with our observation that ErbB4 is not constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated (Fig. 1 A) and highlights the utility of the anti-phosphotyrosine peptide purification method prior to mapping. Six to nine phosphopeptides were observed in each ErbB4 map after growth factor treatment, and the presence of several of the phosphopeptides depended on the identity of the stimulating ligand. Peptides 1–5 were similarly induced by all four growth factors. Peptide 6 was induced by three of the four (BTC, NRG1β, and NRG2β), as was peptide 7 (BTC, NRG1β, and NRG3). Peptide 8 was preferentially induced by BTC and NRG1β, and peptides 9 and 10 were specific for NRG1β and NRG3, respectively. These results indicate that the different growth factor ligands are capable of inducing the differential tyrosine phosphorylation of the ErbB4 receptor. Our observations suggest that the different EGF-like ligands are capable of influencing phosphorylation site usage in the ErbB4 homodimer, thereby dictating which intracellular signaling proteins become efficiently recruited and activated, and hence determining which kinase signaling cascades are efficiently triggered. In the heterologous context of the transfected T cell ligand discrimination is reflected in different potencies of growth factor-stimulated cellular growth properties. However, in the normal context of fetal cardiac myocytes or mammary epithelial cells, differential ligand stimulation of ErbB4 could influence diverse cellular activities such as survival, differentiation, or fate (13.Carraway III, K.L. Burden S.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 14.Burden S. Yarden Y. Neuron. 1997; 18: 847-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Our previous and unpublished results suggest that ligand-induced differential ErbB receptor phosphorylation is not unique to ErbB4. Using human mammary tumor cells that express different ErbB receptors, we have obtained evidence that EGF and BTC induce the differential phosphorylation of EGF receptor homodimers4 and that NRG1β and NRG2β induce the differential phosphorylation of4 and differential signaling through (7.Crovello C.S. Lai C. Cantley L.C. Carraway III., K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26954-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimers. Taken together our observations suggest that the stimulation of ErbB receptor signaling is not generic; several states of an activated receptor dimer may exist depending on the identity of the growth factor bound to the dimeric receptor complex. Different activation (phosphorylation) states could then influence the usage of intracellular signaling pathways, which in turn could dictate cellular response (Fig. 4 A). The physical mechanism by which ligands differentially influence ErbB receptor tyrosine phosphorylation remains a very interesting question. It has been previously suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation site usage within ErbB2 may be dictated by its dimerizing ErbB receptor partner (15.Olayioye M.A. Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Rohrer J. Gay B. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5042-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Hence, differences in the intrinsic abilities of different ligands to induce different receptor heterodimers could result in differential receptor phosphorylation and signaling. However, because the CEM/HER4 cells lack other ErbB receptors and an ErbB4 homodimer is the only signaling entity, differential receptor heterodimerization cannot account for the observed differential signaling. A number of studies have ascribed differences in the biological activities of EGF-like ligands to differences in the stability of the ligand-receptor complex during internalization and routing (16.Ebner R. Derynck R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 599-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 17.Lenferink A.E. Kramer R.H. van Vugt M.J. Konigswieser M. Di Fiore P.P. van Zoelen E.J. van de Poll M.L. Biochem.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13819-13827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In our studies we examined ErbB4 phosphorylation at 2 min, and we have observed differential phosphorylation of ErbB2 30 s after ligand treatment.4 Because differential phosphorylation appears to precede significant receptor internalization, receptor-ligand complex stability is also an unlikely explanation. Fig. 4 B illustrates three possible mechanisms for differential signaling through a single ErbB receptor dimer. One possibility (depicted by ligand 2) is that growth factors differentially promote the association of the active receptor complex with other cellular components that in turn modulate the receptor phosphorylation state. Candidates for such components are other kinases, phosphatases, or scaffolding proteins involved in the assembly of signaling complexes (19.Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our recent work has uncovered evidence for a class of cell surface proteins called modulators that directly interact with ErbB receptors to regulate their response to EGF-like ligands. 5K. L. Carraway III and C. Sweeney, manuscript in preparation. The kekkon-1 protein from Drosophila melanogaster appears to interact directly with Drosophila EGF receptor to suppress its activity (20.Ghiglione C. Carraway III, K.L. Amundadottir L.T. Boswell R.E. Perrimon N. Duffy J.B. Cell. 1999; 96: 847-856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), whereas the membrane-bound ASGP2 component of the rat mucin MUC4 interacts directly with ErbB2 to potentiate its response to NRG1β (21.Carraway III, K.L. Rossi E.A. Komatsu M. Price-Schiavi S.A. Huang D. Guy P.M. Carvajal M.E. Fregien N. Carraway C.A. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5263-5266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). These or other cell surface modulator components may also affect autophosphorylation site usage in activated ErbB receptors. Alternatively, ligand discrimination may be a property intrinsic to ErbB receptors, so that other cellular components are not required to mediate differential phosphorylation and signaling. One possibility, depicted by ligand 3 in Fig. 4 B, is that the different ligands might induce different oligomeric states of the receptor, which in turn influences phosphorylation site selection. Biochemical (22.Huang G.C. Ouyang X. Epstein R.J. Biochem J. 1998; 331: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and molecular modeling (23.Murali R. Brennan P.J. Kieber-Emmons T. Greene M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6252-6257Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) studies have pointed to a potential role for higher order oligomers of ErbB receptors in signaling. It has also been reported that differential oligomerization of the ephrin ligands induces differential signaling through the eph family growth factor RTKs (24.Stein E. Lane A.A. Cerretti D.P. Schoecklmann H.O. Schroff A.D. Van Etten R.L. Daniel T.O. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Finally, the tyrosine kinase domain of the fibroblast growth factor receptor crystallized as a dimer with the catalytic sites oriented away from each other (25.Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Because intermolecular cross-phosphorylation of the kinase domain subunits in this conformation would be difficult, it has been speculated that higher-order aggregates may be involved in RTK tyrosine phosphorylation. Another very intriguing hypothesis is that the different ligands could induce different conformations within the context of a receptor dimer (ligand 4 in Fig. 4 B; reviewed in Ref. 26.Jiang G. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 568-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Indeed, crystal structures suggest that erythropoietin (EPO) receptor ligands that exhibit different potencies induce different conformations within EPO receptor dimers (27.Syed R.S. Reid S.W. Li C. Cheetham J.C. Aoki K.H. Liu B. Zhan H. Osslund T.D. Chirino A.J. Zhang J. Finer-Moore J. Elliott S. Sitney K. Katz B.A. Matthews D.J. Wendoloski J.J. Egrie J. Stroud R.M.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5371-5379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that the rotational orientation of ErbB2 subunits within a receptor homodimer may be a critical determinant in the transforming activity of this receptor. Studies are currently underway to determine whether ligand discrimination is a property intrinsic to the ErbB receptors themselves or whether other cellular components may contribute to differential ErbB receptor tyrosine phosphorylation."

We tested the hypothesis that transcriptional activation of genes encoding these proteins accounts for their accumulation during this phenotypic transition by measuring the transcriptional activities of the murine SM22 and human smooth muscle myosin heavy chain promoters during transient transfection in subconfluent, serum fed or 7 day serum-deprived cultured canine tracheal smooth muscle cells. Contrary to our expectation, SM22 and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain promoter activities (but not viral murine sarcoma virus-long terminal repeat promoter activity) were decreased in long term serum-deprived myocytes by at least 8-fold. Because serum response factor (SRF) is a required transcriptional activator of these and other smooth muscle-specific promoters, we evaluated the expression and function of SRF in subconfluent and long term serum-deprived cells. Whole cell SRF mRNA and protein were maintained at high levels in serum-deprived myocytes, but SRF transcription-promoting activity, nuclear SRF binding to consensus CArG sequences, and nuclear SRF protein were reduced. Furthermore, immunocytochemistry revealed extranuclear redistribution of SRF in serum-deprived myocytes; nuclear localization of SRF was restored after serum refeeding. These results uncover a novel mechanism for physiological control of smooth muscle-specific gene expression through extranuclear redistribution of SRF and consequent down-regulation of its transcription-promoting activity.

About 1/6 of these cells accumulate abundant contractile apparatus proteins, increasing whole culture contents of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (smMHC)1 and SM22 by 5–7-fold (1Halayko A.J. Camoretti-Mercado B. Forsythe S.M. Vieira J.E. Mitchell R.W. Wylam M.E. Hershenson M.B. Solway J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L197-L206PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ma X. Wang Y. Stephens N.L. Am. J.

These myocytes acquire a contractile phenotype, characterized by morphological elongation, expression of functionally coupled muscarinic M3 surface receptors, and substantial contraction (shortening) upon cholinergic stimulation. Presently, the mechanism responsible for this phenotypic differentiation is unknown. In cultured skeletal muscle, differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes depends upon up-regulation of skeletal muscle-specific gene transcription, which results in abundant contractile apparatus protein accumulation (3Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 4Olson E.N. Brennan T.J. Chakraborty T. Cheng T.C. Cserjesi P. Edmondson D. James G. Li L. Mol. Cell.

This precedent in skeletal muscle suggested that similarly enhanced transcription of contractile apparatus genes might account for the substantial smMHC and SM22 accumulation we observed in long term serum-deprived tracheal smooth muscle cells. To test this hypothesis, we assessed transcription from the smMHC and SM22 gene promoters in both preconfluent serum fed and post confluent long term serum-deprived tracheal myocytes. Contrary to our expectation, we found markedly reduced transcription from these promoters in serum-deprived myocytes, an effect mediated through reduced SRF binding activity attributable to reversible, extranuclear relocation of SRF. Our study discloses a novel mechanism for physiological regulation of smooth muscle gene transcription mediated through redistribution of SRF from nucleus to cytoplasm. Canine tracheal myocytes were grown on uncoated plastic dishes or glass coverslips (1Halayko A.J. Camoretti-Mercado B. Forsythe S.M. Vieira J.E. Mitchell R.W. Wylam M.E. Hershenson M.B. Solway J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L197-L206PubMed Google Scholar) and were studied at passage 1 or 2. Serum fed myocytes were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F-12 (1:1) plus 10% FBS, 0.1 mmnonessential amino acids, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Serum-deprived cells were grown to confluence and then maintained for ≥7 days in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F-12 containing 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, and 5 ng/ml selenium (ITS), as well as nonessential amino acids and antibiotics as above. Fresh medium was provided every 48–72 h. Some myocytes deprived of serum for 7 days were refed with 20% FBS for 4 days. Long term serum-deprived myocytes from canine pulmonary artery myocytes or canine aorta were similarly prepared. In pSM22luc, transcription of the luciferase cDNA in pGL2basic is directed by bp −445 to + 41 of the mouse SM22 gene (7Solway J. Seltzer J. Samaha F.F. Kim S. Alger L.E. Niu Q. Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S.

In p5xCArGluc, luciferase expression is directed by an artificial promoter containing five copies of the SRF binding site (CC(A/T)6GG, or “CArG box”) upstream of a minimal TATA box (Stratagene); p5xCArGluc does not contain the Ets binding site contained in the c -fos serum response element. We constructed psmMHCluc, in which the human smMHC promoter drives luciferase expression, as follows. We determined that human chromosome 16p13 BAC clone CIT987SK-972D3 (GenBankTM HSU91323; provided by Dr. Ung-Jin Kim) contains the 5′-end of the human smMHC gene, as evidenced by sequence homology with rat, mouse, and rabbit smMHC genes.

Parmacek M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1006-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), were generated previously. To generate p4xAP2luc, four copies of the human keratin K14 promoter sequence from bp −257 to −211, which contains an AP-2 binding site (10Leask A. Rosenberg M. Vassar R. Fuchs E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1985-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), were cloned upstream of the minimal K14 promoter in the K14mpLuc vector (11Sinha S. Degenstein L. Copenhaver C. Fuchs E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2543-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), between the KpnI and SacI sites. In preliminary studies, transcription from this AP-2-dependent reporter was activated 5–10 times upon co-transfection with AP-2α expression plasmid in HepG2 and HeLa cells. 2S. Sinha, unpublished observation. All plasmids were purified on CsCl gradients prior to transfection. Transient transfection of plasmid DNA was accomplished with cationic lipids. LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) provided efficient transfection of subconfluent, serum fed canine tracheal myocytes, whereas DOTAP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) allowed for serum-free transfection of 7-day-old serum-deprived cells. Subconfluent myocytes in 6-well dishes were transfected in Optimem (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 14 μg of LipofectAMINE, 1.8 μg of luciferase reporter, and 0.6 μg of pMSVβgal (used to normalize transfection efficiency)/well. Myocytes were refed with serum 5 h later and harvested 48 h after transfection for measurement of luciferase and β-galactosidase activities (7Solway J. Seltzer J. Samaha F.F. Kim S. Alger L.E. Niu Q.

Results from three to four wells were averaged to provide the datum; experiments were repeated three to nine times, and the average (± S.E.) is shown. Additional serum-deprived myocytes were transfected with only pSM22βgal or pMSVβgal (2.5 μg of DNA plus 20 μg of DOTAP; n = 3–4), stained 48 h later with X-gal, and the fraction of blue-stained cells that are nonelongated determined by phase contrast microscopy. Discrimination of elongated versus nonelongated cells is easily made by visual inspection (cf. Fig. 2,a and b). The AdSM22nlacZ virus was constructed by ligating a shuttle plasmid (pCA3, Microbix Inc.) containing 445 bp of mouse SM22 promoter fused to a nuclear-localizing lacZ reporter gene to ClaI-linearized dL327 adenovirus. Viral plaques were generated in HEK cells carrying the E1 gene of adenovirus. Putative recombinant plaques were purified twice in HEK cells. High titer virus (1–2 × 1010 pfu/ml) was analyzed for nuclear lacZ reporter expression in PAC SMC (12Rothman A. Kulik T.J. Taubman M.B. Berk B.C. Smith C.W.J. Nadal-Ginard B. Circulation. 1992; 86: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at multiplicity of infection of 10–250; 50 multiplicity of infection virus resulted in 100% transduction. Serum-deprived cultured tracheal myocytes plated in 12-well dishes were transduced with AdSM22nlacZ in medium containing 2% FBS and 50 multiplicity of infection virus. After 1 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and placed in serum-free medium for 24 h. Myocytes were then fixed and stained for β-galactosidase activity using X-gal reagent. Nuclear extracts of 30–70% confluent, serum fed ,or 0–8 day serum-deprived canine tracheal myocytes were prepared at 4 °C using a modification of the method of Dignam et al. (13Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). Myocytes were trypsinized and rinsed twice with Dulbecco phosphate buffer, and then packed cells were incubated on ice for 10 min with 10 vol of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm DTT) and then washed, and nuclei were pelleted in buffer A. Packed nuclei were gently resuspended in 1 vol of extraction buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 420 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm DTT) and rocked for 30 min. After centrifugation, supernatants were dialyzed for 1 h against three changes of buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mmKCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm DTT) and then clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. Protease inhibitors (leupeptin, antipain, chymostatin, and pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml each, Sigma) were added, and nuclear extracts were frozen in aliquots at −80 °C until use. Double-stranded DNA fragments harboring the sequences of interest were prepared by annealing complementary synthetic oligonucleotides and were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. CArG-box-containing probes included those encompassing the 5′ (5′-GCTGCCCATAAAAGGTTTTTG-3′) or 3′ (5′-CTTTCCCCAAATATGGAGCCTG-3′) CArG boxes (underlined) of the mouse SM22 promoter. An oligonucleotide harboring the AP2 binding site (5′- TCGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCGT-3′) was also used. 20,000 dpm (1–5 fmol) labeled oligonucleotide were preincubated for 15 min with 1.5 μl of binding buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20% Ficoll, 375 mm KCl, 5 mmEDTA, 5 mm DTT) and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). When indicated, 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide containing an Sp1 binding site (5′- CCTGGCTAAAGGGGCGGGGCTTGGCCAGCC-3′) was added. For supershift experiments, 3 μg of antibody were added to the incubation mixture. Binding reactions (3–6 μg of nuclear extract protein) were performed at room temperature in 15 μl for 30 min. DNA·protein complex formation was analyzed by electrophoresis on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in TBE buffer (TBE, 40 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA). Supershift antibodies included anti-SRF (gift of Dr. R. Prywes), anti-human IL-5 antibody (TRFK-5; gift of Searle, Inc.), anti-SAP-1a, anti-Elk-1, anti-YY1, anti-p300/CBP, and anti-C/EBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein lysates or nuclear extracts from subconfluent, serum fed, or postconfluent, serum-deprived myocytes were resolved using 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1Halayko A.J. Camoretti-Mercado B. Forsythe S.M. Vieira J.E. Mitchell R.W. Wylam M.E. Hershenson M.B. Solway J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L197-L206PubMed Google Scholar). Serum response factor was detected as a 67-kDa band using anti-SRF primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents; AP-2α was similarly detected as a ∼50-kDa band using anti-AP-2α antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). 7-Day-old serum-deprived airway myocytes grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, treated serially with proteinase K (0.1 μg/ml in 100 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and acetic anhydride (0.25% v/v) in 0.1 m triethanolamine (pH 8.0), and then washed twice with SSC. Antisense and sense (for control comparison) cRNA probes labeled by incorporation of digoxigenin-UTP were synthesized by in vitro transcription from linearized pGEM3z containing the human SM22 cDNA (WS3–10 (14Thweatt R. Lumpkin Jr., C.K. Goldstein S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar)), using the Dig RNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and T7 or SP6 polymerase. Hybridization was performed overnight at 55 °C in 75% formamide, 1.3X SSC, 1X Denhardt's solution, 200 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 50 mm Na3PO4(pH 7.4), 0.1 gm/ml dextran sulfate, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, 250 nm α-thio-ATP, and 1 ng/μl antisense or sense cRNA probe. Thereafter, slides were washed, digested with RNaseA (200 μg/ml at 37 °C for 45 min), rewashed (1X SSC, 55 °C, 10 min; 0.5X SSC, 55 °C, 1 h; 0.5X SSC, room temperature, 5 min), and then blocked with 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline. Hybridized probe was detected with primary anti-digoxigenin antibody and secondary rhodamine-labeled antibody; cell nuclei were stained with Hoescht 33342. Total RNA isolated from subconfluent serum fed or 7-day serum-deprived tracheal myocytes was size fractionated (20 μg/lane) by electrophoresis in 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose and transferred to a Hybond plus membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Prehybridization and hybridization were performed using ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH) at 60 °C and an SRF-specific probe prepared by random primer labeling of the full-length human SRF cDNA. Cellular localization of SRF was identified by immunocytochemistry performed as described previously (1Halayko A.J. Camoretti-Mercado B. Forsythe S.M. Vieira J.E. Mitchell R.W. Wylam M.E. Hershenson M.B. Solway J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L197-L206PubMed Google Scholar), using primary anti-SRF antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antibody, and propidium iodide or Hoescht 33342 nuclear counterstain. AP-2α was immunolocalized in additional cells using primary anti-AP-2α antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Samples were photographed on a Zeiss Axioskop microscope with a Photometrics PXL cooled CCD camera and Openlab V2 software (Improvision) or on a Nikon microscope with a Photometrics Sensys CCD camera and IPLab Spectrum software (Signal Analytics). Fig.1 shows the activities of the mouse SM22, human smMHC, and MSV-LTR promoters in subconfluent or 7-day-old serum-deprived myocytes. Transcription from both the SM22 and smMHC promoters was ≥8-fold greater in subconfluent myocytes than in 7-day-old serum-deprived cells. In contrast, transcription from the MSV-LTR promoter was greater in airway myocytes cultured under long term serum deprivation. Thus, the reduction in smooth muscle gene promoter activity in serum-deprived myocytes cannot be attributed to a generalized inhibition of gene transcription in such cells. Only 1/6 of serum-deprived tracheal smooth muscle cells become elongated and accumulate large quantities of contractile apparatus associated proteins (1Halayko A.J. Camoretti-Mercado B. Forsythe S.M. Vieira J.E. Mitchell R.W. Wylam M.E. Hershenson M.B. Solway J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L197-L206PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the lower overall transcriptional activity of SM22 and smMHC promoters in serum-deprived cells was because of a differential activation of these promoters in elongated, but not nonelongated, myocytes, we performed three types of experiments. First, we transfected serum-deprived myocytes with pMSVβgal or with pSM22βgal and counted the proportion of X-gal-positive cells that were nonelongated; Fig. 2, aand b, demonstrates the typical appearance of nonelongated and elongated myocytes. The fraction of nonelongated cells expressing the lacZ transgene under control of SM22 promoter was only slightly less than that found in cells expressing lacZdriven by the MSV-LTR promoter. In both cases, over 2/3 of β-galactosidase-expressing cells were nonelongated (Fig.2 c). Thus, when exogenously introduced, the smooth muscle-specific SM22 promoter is active in nonelongated as well as in elongated myocytes. Second, we employed replication-deficient adenovirus to accomplish more uniform transfer of an SM22 promoter-driven nuclear localizing lacZ reporter gene to all myocytes in serum-deprived cultures. Almost all elongated and nonelongated myocytes (Fig.2 d) were transduced and expressed the SM22 promoter-driven reporter. This finding confirms that an exogenously introduced SM22 gene promoter is active in both elongated and flattened serum-deprived airway myocytes. Finally, we performed in situ hybridization to evaluate whether the endogenous SM22 gene is transcribed in both elongated and nonelongated serum-deprived myocytes. A specific hybridization signal using the SM22 antisense probe reveals the presence of endogenous SM22 mRNA in all myocytes (Fig. 2 e); no specific hybridization was seen with SM22 sense probe (not shown). Together, these three lines of evidence exclude restricted activation of smooth muscle-specific gene promoters to only elongated myocytes as a potential explanation for the reduced smooth muscle gene promoter activity seen in serum-deprived airway smooth muscle cells. These experiments demonstrate uniform distribution of promoter activation among serum-deprived airway myocytes and do not conflict with our demonstration above that the overall level of promoter activation is much reduced in these cells. Because of the central importance of SRF in activating smooth muscle gene transcription (7Solway J. Seltzer J. Samaha F.F. Kim S. Alger L.E. Niu Q. Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. J. Biol.

Res. 1999; 84: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), we analyzed SRF transcription-promoting activity in long term serum-deprived airway myocytes by quantifying transcription from the purely SRF-dependent promoter contained in p5xCArGluc. SRF-dependent luciferase expression was markedly reduced in long term serum-deprived airway myocytes versus the high level expression found in subconfluent serum fed cells transfected with p5xCArGluc (Fig. 3 a). In contrast, transcription from the AP-2-dependent promoter contained in p4xAP2luc was relatively elevated in long term serum-deprived airway myocytes (Fig. 3 a). Thus, SRF transcription-promoting activity is selectively diminished in serum-deprived myocytes. Next we sought to determine whether this decrease in SRF transcription-promoting activity stems from reduction in SRF gene expression or from reduced SRF DNA binding activity. Northern blot analysis showed that SRF transcript levels remained high in both serum fed and serum-deprived myocytes (Fig. 3 b). Likewise, SRF protein is abundant in both 70–100% confluent serum fed and multiday serum-deprived cells (Fig. 3 b). In contrast, binding of SRF from nuclear extracts to oligonucleotides containing either CArG element from the mouse SM22 promoter was markedly lower in serum-deprived myocytes (Fig. 3 c). This reduction of SRF binding activity was selective, in that binding of AP2 to its consensus site was similar in subconfluent or serum-deprived cells (Fig.3 d). Thus, a reduction of SRF binding activity, but not a reduction in SRF mRNA levels or SRF protein abundance, can explain its reduced transcriptional-promoting activity. To evaluate whether other nuclear factors contribute to the formation of SRF-containing DNA complexes found in extracts from subconfluent myocytes, we performed additional EMSAs including antibodies directed against SAP-1a, Elk-1, YY-1, p300/CBP, and C/EBP (Fig. 3 e). These antibodies neither prevented SRF-containing complex formation nor supershifted the SRF-containing DNA complex. Thus, none of these nuclear factors are contained within the SRF-containing complexes identified in this assay.

Biol. 1995; 15: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but regulated nuclear translocation of SRF has not yet been reported. To test whether cytoplasmic redistribution of nuclear SRF could account for the diminished nuclear SRF binding and transcription-promoting activities observed in long term serum-deprived cells, we analyzed nuclear SRF protein abundance by Western blot and immunostained smooth muscle cells to localize SRF. SRF protein is diminished in nuclear extracts from 7-day-old serum-deprived tracheal myocytes versus 70% confluent, serum fed cells (Fig. 3 f). In contrast, nuclear AP-2 protein increases with serum deprivation (Fig. 3 f). Furthermore, whereas SRF immunoreactivity is restricted to the nucleus of subconfluent, serum fed airway myocytes (Fig.4, a and b), SRF is redistributed into the cytoplasm of long term serum-deprived cells, where it appears as a perinuclear cloud (Fig. 4, c and d) or as a polar extranuclear cap (Fig. 4, g and h). Refeeding of 7-day-old serum-deprived airway myocytes with 20% FBS for 4 days restores full nuclear localization of SRF (Fig. 4, e and f). Thus, SRF undergoes reversible nuclear cytoplasmic redistribution in response to external myocyte stimuli. Localization of SRF in an extranuclear polar cap was observed not only in 10-day-old serum-deprived canine pulmonary artery myocytes (shown in Fig. 4, g and h) but also in similarly treated aortic and tracheal myocytes (not shown). In contrast to the observed redistribution of SRF out of the nucleus in serum-deprived airway myocytes, AP-2 immunostaining demonstrated cytoplasmic predominance in serum fed subconfluent cells (Fig.5, a and b), with heterogeneous (Fig. 5, c and d) or more uniform (Fig. 5, e and f) redistribution of AP-2 into the nucleus of 7-day-old serum-deprived myocytes. Together, these results confirm the specificity of intracellular SRF relocalization during long term serum deprivation.Figure 5Immunocytochemical localization of AP-2α (fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence shown as white) within cultured canine tracheal myocytes.

Moreover, after birth, cholesterol used for myelin production is made locally (4.Jurevics H. Morell P. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In contrast, fetal liver supplies about 50% of the cholesterol needed for development of heart, lung, and kidney (3.Jurevics H.A. Kidwai F.Z. Morell P. J. Lipid. Res. 1997; 38: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, during peripheral nerve regeneration, cholesterol synthesis in the nerve is down-regulated (5.Goodrum J.F. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1709-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), yet serum-derived cholesterol does not contribute significantly to myelin synthesis or axonal regeneration (6.Goodrum J.F.

Res. 1998; 23: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Instead, cholesterol from degenerating axons and myelin is proposed to be retained within the nerve and re-utilized via a lipoprotein-mediated process (8.Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3376) Google Scholar), although cholesterol uptake by neurons was not directly demonstrated. The presence of endoneural lipoproteins in regenerating, but not non-injured, nerves is well documented. These lipoproteins contain apolipoprotein (apo)1E and apoAI but not apoB (9.Boyles J.K. Zoellner C.D. Anderson L.J. Kosik L.M. Pitas R.E. Weisgraber K.H. Hui D.Y. Mahley R.W. Gebicke-Haerter P.J. Ignatius M.J. et al.J. Clin.

After peripheral nerve injury, apoE synthesis by resident macrophages increases greatly, and apoE accumulates within the nerve (12.Ignatius M.J. Gebicke-Harter P.J. Skene J.H. Schilling J.W.

The receptors involved in lipoprotein uptake by axons and Schwann cells have not been fully characterized, nor has the uptake and utilization of lipids from lipoproteins for axonal regeneration been directly demonstrated. The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) has been reported to be used by PC12 cells, Schwann cells, and sensory neuronsin vitro for uptake of plasma lipoproteins and endoneural lipoproteins isolated from crushed sciatic nerves (15.Ignatius M.J. Shooter E.M. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. Science. 1987; 236: 959-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 16.Rothe T. Muller H.W. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 2016-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In vivo, the tips of regenerating axons contain a high concentration of LDLRs (9.Boyles J.K. Zoellner C.D. Anderson L.J. Kosik L.M. Pitas R.E. Weisgraber K.H. Hui D.Y. Mahley R.W. Gebicke-Haerter P.J. Ignatius M.J. et al.J. Clin.

Science. 1987; 236: 959-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Thus, the model originally proposed for re-utilization or “salvage” of cholesterol during nerve regeneration involved apoE-containing lipoproteins and LDLRs. More recently, other lipoprotein receptors have been detected in neurons. In adult rats, the LDLR-related protein (LRP), a multifunctional apoE receptor, was found to be highly expressed in neurons of brain and spinal cord (17.Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Nerbonne J.M.

In cultured hippocampal neurons, LRP is restricted to the somatodendritic domain (22.Brown M.D. Banker G.A. Hussaini I.M. Gonias S.L. VandenBerg S.R.

Since LR11 and LR7/8B are highly expressed in neurons, and LR11 expression is regulated during central nervous system (CNS) development (24.Kanaki T. Bujo H. Hirayama S. Tanaka K. Yamazaki H. Seimiya K. Morisaki N. Schneider W.J. Saito Y. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), these receptors have been suggested to be involved in neural organization, synaptic formation, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (29.Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. Bujo H. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The lipoprotein receptors present in neurons of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) have not yet been rigorously examined although both the LDLR and LRP have been detected in rabbit dorsal root ganglia neurons (30.Handelmann G.E. Boyles J.K. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Pitas R.E. J. Lipid. Res. 1992; 33: 1677-1688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A reasonable prediction is that a different spectrum of lipoprotein receptors might be present in CNS and PNS neurons since the classes of lipoproteins that these two types of neurons would encounter are different. For example, in the PNS, distal axons would be exposed to the same types of lipoproteins as in the circulation (i.e. very low density lipoproteins, LDL, and HDL). In contrast, apoB-containing lipoproteins (LDL and very low density lipoproteins) appear to be absent from cerebrospinal fluid. Instead, lipoproteins in the vicinity of CNS neurons are HDL-sized and contain apoE, apoAI, apoD, and/or apoJ (31.Chiba H. Mitamura T. Fujisawa S. Ogata A. Aimoto Y. Tashiro K. Kobayashi K. Neurosci.

We have previously shown that cholesterol synthesis is restricted to cell bodies/proximal axons of sympathetic neurons and is not detectable in distal axons (35.Vance J.E. Pan D. Campenot R.B. Bussiere M. Vance D.E. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). When cholesterol synthesis was inhibited by pravastatin, axonal growth was severely impaired. However, normal growth was restored when cholesterol was added to either cell bodies or distal axons (36.Posse de Chaves E.I. Rusinol A.E. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30766-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Serum lipoproteins also restored normal axonal growth to these neurons. When LDL were given to either cell bodies or axons of pravastatin-treated neurons, axonal elongation proceeded normally, presumably because the LDL supplied cholesterol. In contrast, HDL restored axonal growth when added only to distal axons but not to cell bodies. These observations suggest that sympathetic neurons express multiple lipoprotein receptors and that these receptors have a polarized distribution. We now show that lipids can be supplied to sympathetic neurons from lipoproteins for use in axonal growth. Our data are consistent with the model that the uptake of lipoprotein components by these neurons occurs via receptor-mediated endocytosis. We show that the LDLR is present in both cell bodies and axons of rat sympathetic neurons, and we have identified two additional members of the LDL receptor superfamily, LR7/8B (apoER2) and LR11 (SorLA), in these neurons. However, neither LRP (which is present in CNS neurons) nor the HDL receptor, SR-BI, was detected. In addition, the experiments show that lipoprotein receptors are differentially distributed and regulated in cell bodies and distal axons of sympathetic neurons.

Lipoprotein preparations were monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to confirm the expected apoprotein compositions and to ensure that hHDL3 did not contain apoE. Chicken HDL (cHDL) was isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation as the fraction of density between 1.12 and 1.21 g/ml (41.Kiss R.S. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4327-4334Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Lipoproteins were labeled with DiI as described previously (42.Pitas R.E. Innerarity T.L. Weinstein J.N. Mahley R.W. Arteriosclerosis. 1981; 1: 177-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 4 mg of hLDL, hHDL3, or cHDL were added to 8 ml of lipoprotein-deficient calf serum. DiI in dimethyl sulfoxide (200 μl, 3 mg/ml) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. Subsequently, the density was adjusted to 1.063 g/ml for hLDL and 1.21 g/ml for hHDL3 and cHDL, by addition of KBr. Lipoproteins were re-isolated at 4 °C by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 24 h in a Beckman Ti50.2 rotor. The top 2 ml, containing DiI-labeled lipoproteins, were collected by aspiration and dialyzed against 0.9% NaCl and 0.01% EDTA. Subsequently, DiI-lipoproteins were filtered through 0.45-μm filters, stored under sterile conditions at 4 °C, and used within a month. DiI-lipoproteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis on 3–15% gradient gels. Gels were analyzed visually for DiI fluorescence and Coomassie Blue staining for identification of major apoproteins. In hHDL, bands corresponding to apoAI and apoAII were not labeled with DiI; the same was true for apoAI in cHDL. For hLDL, most fluorescence was at the gel front as free DiI. However, some DiI fluorescence was associated with apoB100 since some lipids remain associated with apoB under these conditions. 2J. Vance, unpublished results. Alexa 488-labeled lipoproteins were prepared according to manufacturer's instructions. Alexa Fluor 488 dye reacts with primary amines of proteins forming stable dye-protein conjugates. In HDL, Alexa 488 binds covalently to apoAI and apoAII (43.Gu X. Trigatti B. Xu S. Acton S. Babitt J. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26338-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis confirmed that apoB, apoAI, apoAII, and chicken apoAI were labeled. All lipoprotein preparations were essentially free of unbound Alexa. Recovery of Alexa fluorescence in the aqueous phase after extraction of Alexa lipoproteins with organic solvents was greater than 95% providing evidence that the label was primarily associated with proteins. Lipoproteins were labeled with [3H]cholesterol as described elsewhere (44.Hara H. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3080-3086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the solvent from 200 μCi of [1α,2α-3H]cholesterol was evaporated to form a thin film. The lipoprotein preparation (3 mg of protein) was added in 0.9% NaCl, and the mixture was shaken overnight at 4 °C, after which lipoproteins were re-isolated by flotation as above. The specific radioactivity of cholesterol (dpm/μg total cholesterol) was determined. Cholesterol mass was determined by an enzymatic kit (Sigma). Typically, the specific radioactivity of cholesterol was 29,700 dpm/μg for hLDL, 150,200 dpm/μg for hHDL3, and 64,100 dpm/μg for cHDL. Neurons were plated in the center compartment of compartmented dishes and cultured for 14 days. DiI or Alexa lipoproteins were added to the cell body- or distal axon-containing compartments as indicated. Lipoprotein concentration in media was normalized to 100 μg of total cholesterol/ml. In addition, fluorescence units were normalized to achieve the same fluorescence in all media by addition of unlabeled lipoproteins. After 18 h, the neurons were washed extensively with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing methylcellulose (3 g/500 ml) and fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. Coverslips were secured usingpara-phenylenediamine in glycerol as mounting medium. Fluorescence microscopy was performed with an Olympus BX-SOF fluorescence microscope equipped with a 100-watt gas mercury lamp and rhodamine filter (for DiI). Alternatively, neurons were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a Leica microscope illuminated by a 100-watt mercury burner for direct observation, a Ar/Kr laser with major emissions at 488, 568 and 647 nm for scanning, and 63 × 1.40 NA oil immersion objectives. Figs. 2, 4, and 5 were prepared using Adobe Photoshop software.Figure 4Uptake of fluorescent lipids and proteins from lipoproteins. Center-plated neurons were incubated with DiI-or Alexa-lipoproteins in either the cell body-containing compartment (B, D, F, H, J, and L) or distal axon-containing compartment (A, C, E, G, I, andK). Lipoprotein concentration was adjusted to 100 μg of cholesterol/ml and 136,000 fluorescence intensity units/ml for DiI lipoproteins or 180,000 fluorescence intensity units/ml for Alexa lipoproteins. After 18 h, neurons were processed for confocal microscopy. The images shown for each group (DiI and Alexa) were captured under identical conditions, and 50–100 fields were analyzed for each treatment. The experiment was repeated twice with comparable results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Competition of fluorescent lipoprotein uptake by unlabeled lipoproteins. Neurons were incubated in either the cell body-containing (A, D, G, and J) or distal axon-containing (B, C, E, F, H, I, K, and L) compartment with fluorescent lipoproteins, as in Fig. 4 legend. Some cultures were given a 50-fold excess of unlabeled lipoproteins. Cell bodies were visualized by confocal microscopy, and the images shown for each group (DiI and Alexa) were captured under identical conditions. The experiment was repeated twice with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Neurons were incubated with DiI lipoproteins in the cell body-containing compartment for 18 h and then washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cellular material was harvested from the center compartment in phosphate-buffered saline. The detached neurons were sonicated for 10 s with a tip probe. An aliquot was added to 2 ml of methanol, and fluorescence was analyzed in a Hitachi F-2000 spectrofluorometer with excitation light of 550 nm and emission at 565 nm. Protein content was determined using the BCA protein kit (Pierce). DiI did not interfere with the protein determinations. In experiments with [3H]cholesterol-labeled lipoproteins, neurons were given labeled lipoproteins in the cell body-containing compartment. The concentration of lipoproteins was adjusted so that the cholesterol content was 100 μg/ml, and the same specific radioactivity of cholesterol was achieved for all lipoproteins by addition of unlabeled lipoproteins. After 18 h, the cells were washed, and material from the center compartment was harvested, and radioactivity was measured. The amount of cell-associated lipoprotein-derived cholesterol was calculated from the specific radioactivity of the lipoprotein [3H]cholesterol. Neurons were plated in the left compartment of compartmented dishes. Distal axons were mechanically removed from the right-hand compartment with a jet of sterile distilled water delivered with a syringe through a 22-gauge needle. The water was aspirated and the wash repeated twice, after which fresh medium was added. This procedure, termed axotomy, effectively removes all visible traces of axons from the right-side compartment. Axonal growth was measured as described previously (45.Campenot R.B. Stevenson R.B. Gallin W. Paul D. Cell-Cell Interactions: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 275-298Google Scholar). Material from distal axon- and cell body-containing compartments was harvested separately in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cellular material was sonicated for 10 s with a probe sonicator and centrifuged at 350,000 × g for 20 min. Membrane pellets were dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The protein content was determined using the BCA protein kit (Pierce). Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for LDLR and SRBI, a 5% gel for LR11 and LR7/8B, and a 3–15% gradient gel for LRP. For LR7/8B, electrophoresis was performed under non-reducing conditions (28.Novak S. Hiesberger T. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11732-11736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for 18 h at 25 V (36.Posse de Chaves E.I. Rusinol A.E. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30766-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TTBS) with 5–10% (w/v) non-fat dried milk for at least 2 h and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibody in TTBS containing 1% non-fat dried milk using the following dilutions of primary antibodies: LDLR, 1:1000; LRP, 1:5000; SR-BI, 1:1000; LR11, 1:1500; and LR7/8B, 1:1500. Membranes were then incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase linked to anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Pierce, diluted 1:10,000), and immunoreactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. We have previously shown that inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by pravastatin impairs axonal elongation of compartmented cultures of rat sympathetic neurons. Addition of cholesterol to axons or cell bodies restored normal axonal growth to pravastatin-treated neurons. Similarly, when human lipoproteins (hLDL, hHDL2, or hHDL3) were supplied to distal axons of pravastatin-treated neurons, normal axonal growth occurred. In contrast, normal axonal elongation occurred only when hLDL, but not hHDL3 or hHDL2, were added to the cell body-containing compartment (36.Posse de Chaves E.I. Rusinol A.E. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30766-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These studies suggested that cholesterol can be taken up from lipoproteins by these neurons and used for axonal growth. The observations also raised the possibility that LDL and HDL, or the cholesterol therein, are taken up by different mechanisms, potentially involving distinct lipoprotein receptors. We have now extended these studies and analyzed the capacity of hLDL, hHDL3, and chicken HDL (cHDL) to deliver lipids, including cholesterol, for axonal growth of rat sympathetic neurons. hHDL3 lacks apoE and therefore would not be expected to interact with the apoB/apoE receptor (i.e. the LDLR). cHDL was selected because chicken apoAI has been proposed to play a role in nerve regeneration in chickens similar to that of apoE in mammals (46.Dawson P.A. Schechter N. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5681-5684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Rajavashisth T.B. Dawson P.A. Williams D.L. Shackleford J.E. Lebherz H. Lusis A.J. J.

For these experiments, rat sympathetic neurons were plated in the left side compartment of three-compartmented culture dishes. In these cultures (49.Campenot R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 58: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), all compartments contain independent fluid environments, and the cell bodies/proximal axons reside in a compartment completely separate from that containing distal axons. After 14 days, axons in the right side compartment were"

Markus R. Feldman D. Kelsey J. Osteoporosis. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1997: 801-820Google Scholar). Suggested mechanisms contributing to GC-induced osteoporosis include decreased osteoblastic bone formation, increased osteoclastic resorption, impaired intestinal calcium absorption, and decreased renal calcium reabsorption (reviewed in Refs. 2.Canalis E.

Weinstein R.S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1061-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), is poorly understood.

Inhibition of osteoblast proliferation was also suggested to contribute to GC-induced osteoporosis (15.Chen T.L. Aronow L. Feldman D. Endocrinology. 1977; 100: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16.Chen T.L. Cone C.M. Feldman D. Endocrinology. 1983; 112: 1739-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Notably, the inhibitory effects of GC on osteoblasts occur at pharmacological concentrations and should not be confused with the positive effects observed at physiological concentrations (for a review, see Ref. 17.Ishida Y. Heersche J.N. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1822-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). GC are antimitogenic in several cell types. Remarkably, however, this effect is mediated via diverse mechanisms. For example, inhibition of lymphoid cell proliferation, which partly accounts for the anti-inflammatory property of GC, is mediated by a decrease in the levels of G1 cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), in particular cyclin D3 and CDK4 (18.Reisman D. Thompson E.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1500-1509PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Rhee K. Reisman D. Bresnahan W. Thompson E.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 691-698PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Rhee K.

By contrast, in both hepatoma and lung alveolar cells, GC-induced cell cycle arrest has been attributed to induction of the CDK inhibitor (CDI) p21 (23.Cram E.J. Ramos R.A. Wang E.C. Cha H.H. Nishio Y. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2008-2014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 24.Cha H.H. Cram E.J. Wang E.C. Huang A.J. Kasler H.G. Firestone G.L.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3677-3685Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). GC-induced osteoblast cell cycle arrest has been recently addressed in two osteosarcoma cell lines (26.Rogatsky I. Trowbridge J.M. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3181-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In Rb- and p53-deficient SAOS2 cells, GC-induced cell cycle arrest involves up-regulation of the CDIs p21 and p27, whereas in U2OS osteosarcoma cells this same phenotype is mediated by repression of CDK4, CDK6, cyclin D, c-Myc, and E2F-1, all of which are positive regulators of the cell cycle. Mechanisms by which GC inhibit nontransformed osteoblast cell cycle progression have not been studied in depth. Abrogation of osteoblast cell cycle progression may contribute to impaired bone formation in two ways. First, cell proliferation is simply required to provide enough cells capable of new bone formation. Second, the cell cycle may have additional, more specific roles in phenotype development, similar to the clonal expansion necessary for adipocyte differentiation (27.Yeh W.C. Bierer B.E. McKnight S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11086-11090Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 28.Richon V.M. Lyle R.E. McGehee Jr., R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10117-10124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Osteoblast differentiation in vitro follows a multistep program, microscopically typified by (i) a proliferation period, during which the cells form a monolayer; (ii) matrix maturation, morphologically characterized by cell condensation, and (iii) the formation of nodules, in which mineral is then deposited (29.Bellows C.G. Aubin J.E. Heersche J.N. Antosz M.E. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1986; 38: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 30.Shalhoub V. Conlon D. Tassinari M. Quinn C. Partridge N. Stein G.S. Lian J.B.

Cell Res. 1995; 216: 244-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the cell condensation, which accompanies matrix maturation, reflects a unique proliferation phase required for phenotype progression. Indeed, this report demonstrates that in confluent MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cultures, a unique cell cycle control is instituted, which is mechanistically different from that operative in preconfluent cultures and is sensitive to glucocorticoids. Furthermore, we provide evidence that GC-mediated inhibition of the osteoblast persistent cell cycle is tightly linked to the inhibitory effect of GC on terminal differentiation, i.e. formation of mineralized extracellular matrix. Like other osteoblastic cell lines, MC3T3-E1 cells are phenotypically heterogeneous (32.Wang D. Christensen K. Chawla K. Xiao G. Krebsbach P.H. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). We therefore isolated 10 MC3T3-E1 subclones and screened them for calcium deposition in the absence and presence of the synthetic GC dexamethasone (DEX) at 10–1000 nm. Although mineralization in most of the subclones was strongly inhibited by 100–1000 nm, we continued the study with one subclone, which reproducibly exhibited progressive extracellular calcium deposition starting on day 10 after plating. Stock plates were maintained in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin and split every 4–7 days. To support differentiation, the medium was also supplemented with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate as described (33.Lian J.B. Shalhoub V. Aslam F. Frenkel B. Green J. Hamrah M. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2117-2127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell cycle analysis was performed according to Darzynkiewicz et al. (34.Darzynkiewicz Z. Li X. Gong J. Darzynkiewicz Z. Robinson J.P. Crissman H.A. Flow Cytometry. 2nd Ed. 41. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1994: 15-38Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lightly trypsinized, resuspended in Hanks' buffer, fixed in cold 70% ethanol, and stored at −20 °C for up to 1 week. Cells were then washed with Hanks' buffer and suspended in 1 ml of Hanks' buffer containing 20 μg/ml propidium iodide and 5 Kunitz units of DNase-free RNase A. The percentage of cells in G1, S, and G2 was determined using an EPICS® Profile Analyzer. For transient transfection assays, MC3T3-E1 cells were plated in six-well plates (80,000 cells/well), and the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method of Chen and Okayama (35.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar) was employed with 5 μg of Qiagen-purified plasmid DNA. The cells were harvested on the indicated days, always 24 h after medium change, and lysed in “reporter lysis buffer” (Promega). Luciferase activity was determined using a microtiter plate luminometer (MLX Dynex Technologies) and protein concentration determined using the Micro BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Reporter constructs contained the luciferase gene driven by the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter (a kind gift from Dr. Ron Evans, La Jolla, CA), the Id2 promoter (36.Sun X.H. Copeland N.G.

Lysates were passed through a 27-gauge needle, centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was stored at −80 °C. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared essentially according to Verona et al. (38.Verona R. Moberg K. Estes S. Starz M. Vernon J.P. Lees J.A. Mol. Cell.

Cell pellets were resuspended, by flicking the tube, in two packed cell volumes of hypotonic buffer containing 10 mmHEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm NaF, and 0.1 mmNa3VO4. Cells were left to swell on ice for 10 min and then vortexed for 10 s and spun at 500 ×g for 5 min. The supernatant, containing the cytoplasmic lysate, was supplemented with one-third the volume of 80% glycerol and clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The nuclear pellet was washed twice in hypotonic buffer and lysed in two pellet volumes of lysis buffer containing 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.5 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 28% glycerol, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors as above. The nuclear extracts were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 h to remove cell debris. Protein concentration was determined using the Micro BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Between 60 and 100 μg of protein was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane using Mini Trans-Blot Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad), and immunodetection was performed using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, followed by exposure of the membrane to x-ray film. The fluorographic signals were quantified by densitometry of the film using the AlphaImager 2000 system (Alpha Innotech Corp.) Results from one representative experiment out of three independent experiments ate shown for each analyte. The murine p27 cDNA (45.Iavarone A. Garg P. Lasorella A. Hsu J. Israel M.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1270-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction usingPfu polymerase (Stratagene). The forward primer, 5′- GAGCGTTCGAATGTCTAACGGGAGCCCGA, contained an SfuI recognition site (underlined), and the reverse primer, 5′-ATATAGCGGCCGCTTACGTCTGGCGTCGAAGG, contained aNotI recognition site (underlined). The 602-base pair amplicon was digested with SfuI and NotI and cloned into the retroviral replication-competent vector pZAPd, downstream of the encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosomal entry site (IRES), 2C. Logg and N. Kasahara, submitted for publication. to yield pZAPd-p27. In preliminary experiments with pZAPd-emd, which contains the emerald mutant (Packard Bioscience) of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the encephalomyocarditis virus IRES,2 calcium phosphate transfection (35.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar) of MC3T3-E1 cells resulted in nearly complete transduction of the entire cell population (see Fig. 4 B), which was as fast as transduction with virus prepared in 293 cells.2 Therefore, calcium phosphate transfection was subsequently employed to introduce the pZAPd vectors into MC3T3-E1 cells, evidently resulting in efficient spread of the virus throughout the entire cell populations. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts (5 μg) were subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assay as described (38.Verona R. Moberg K. Estes S. Starz M. Vernon J.P. Lees J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7268-7282Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) with 1.5 ng of 32P-end-labeled double-stranded E2F oligonucleotide probe (5′-ATTTAAGTTTCGCGCCCTTTCTCAA). The binding reaction (20–30 μl) contained 50 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 14% glycerol. Prior to the addition of the probe, the protein extracts were preincubated with 0.5–1 μg of salmon sperm DNA and either (i) 150 ng of unlabeled E2F oligonucleotide, (ii) 150 ng of unlabeled E2F mutant oligonucleotide (5′-ATTTAAGTTTCGatCCCTTTCTCAA), or (iii) for supershift analysis, antibodies to either E2F-4, p107, p130, or CDK2. Preincubation with the cold DNAs and the antibodies was for 10 min on ice, and incubation with the probe was for an additional 10 min on ice and 15 min at room temperature. For cyclin A supershift analysis, the antibody was added after the probe as described (40.Pagano M. Durst M. Joswig S. Draetta G. Jansen-Durr P. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1681-1686PubMed Google Scholar). Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis at 4 °C in 0.25% TBE, 4% native polyacrylamide gels containing 5% glycerol. Whole cell extracts (see above) were subjected to immunoprecipitation essentially as described previously (41.Smith E. Frenkel B. MacLachlan T.K. Giordano A. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For cyclin A, cyclin E, and CDK2 immunoprecipitation, 100 μg of cell lysate was incubated with 1 μg of primary antibody, followed by 20 μl of A/G-agarose bead suspension. For cyclin D1, 500 μg of cell extract was immunoprecipitated with 3 μg of primary antibody. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 buffer as above and once with kinase buffer (41.Smith E. Frenkel B. MacLachlan T.K. Giordano A. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors as above. Immunocomplexes were subjected to kinase assay in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and either histone H1 (for cyclin A, cyclin E, and CDK2) or pRb (residues 769–921) (for cyclin D1) as substrate, followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% gel containing 5% glycerol) and autoradiography. For kinase inhibition assays (41.Smith E. Frenkel B. MacLachlan T.K. Giordano A. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. J. Cell.

Calcium deposition was demonstrated histochemically by Alizarin red staining of 70% ethanol-fixed cultures as described previously (33.Lian J.B. Shalhoub V. Aslam F. Frenkel B. Green J. Hamrah M. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2117-2127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For quantitation of calcium accumulation, cell layers were initially scraped in saline solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) and 0.2% Triton X-100 and centrifuged, and an aliquot was removed for protein determination using the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). HCl was then added to 0.5 m, and the dissolved calcium was quantitated based on the light absorbance of complexes formed between calcium ions and o-cresolphthalein, using Sigma Procedure no. 587.

MC3T3-E1 is a preosteoblastic cell line that undergoes a staged developmental process, leading to deposition and then mineralization of the extracellular matrix within ∼2–4 weeks after plating (43.Sudo H. Kodama H.A. Amagai Y. Yamamoto S. Kasai S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar, 44.Choi J.Y. Lee B.H. Song K.B. Park R.W. Kim I.S. Sohn K.Y. Jo J.S. Ryoo H.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Chronic exposure of MC3T3-E1 cells to DEX results in severe attenuation of phenotype development, but only when treatment commences during the first week of culture (33.Lian J.B. Shalhoub V. Aslam F. Frenkel B. Green J. Hamrah M. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2117-2127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that GC alleviate a commitment stage during early differentiation. In pursuit of early effects of GC in MC3T3-E1 cell cultures, we noticed that, while the nontreated cells exhibited the postconfluent condensation typical of most osteoblast culture systems, this process was attenuated by DEX (Fig.1). No morphological difference was observed between nontreated and DEX-treated cultures until confluency (see Fig. 1, day 4). We postulated that a unique cell cycle control was instituted during the condensation period, and that this cell cycle control is susceptible to the antimitogenic effect of GC. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to examine the cell cycle profile before and after confluency, in the absence and presence of DEX. The results show that the cultures maintain an active cell cycle for several days after confluency (Fig.2). In multiple experiments, the percentage of postconfluent cells in S, G2, and M was 20–30%, and was equal to or only slightly lower than that in the preconfluent cultures. DEX consistently inhibited cell cycle progression in the postconfluent cultures, reflected by a ∼2-fold reduction in the percentage of cells in S, G2, and M (Fig.2). Remarkably, DEX did not inhibit the cell cycle in preconfluent cultures (Fig. 2, day 3). The GC-induced inhibition of cell cycle progression, occurring specifically in the postconfluent cultures, did not result from prolonged exposure to the steroid, because, as shown in Fig. 2, B and C, an acute (20-h) exposure of the postconfluent cells to DEX was sufficient for inhibition of cell cycle progression to levels observed in the chronically treated cultures (Fig. 2 A).Figure 2Developmental stage-specific inhibition of cell cycle progression in MC3T3-E1 cultures. MC3T3-E1 cells as in Fig. 1 were treated with 1 μm DEX either chronically, starting on day 2 (A), or acutely for 20 h (B and C) on the indicated days. Cells were collected by trypsinization, always 20 h after medium change, fixed in ethanol, and stained with propidium iodide followed by flow cytometry analysis. Percentage of cells in the S, G2, and M phases of the cell cycle is graphed in A and B, where open circles and filled squares represent nontreated and DEX-treated cells, respectively (mean ± S.D., n = 3).

To address this possibility, we compared the effects of DEX in preconfluent versus postconfluent osteoblasts on several promoter-reporter constructs. As shown in Fig.3 A, DEX strongly activated the MMTV promoter in preconfluent cultures, even more than in postconfluent cultures (130- versus 3.5-fold, respectively). The promoter of Id2, which has been implicated in cell cycle control (45.Iavarone A. Garg P. Lasorella A. Hsu J. Israel M.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1270-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), was responsive to DEX in preconfluent but not postconfluent MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 3 B). Thus, preconfluent MC3T3-E1 cultures evidently have a functional receptor. Interestingly, additional transient transfection experiments revealed one promoter, that of the CDI p21, to be specifically affected by DEX in postconfluent MC3T3-E1 cells. However, unlike the effects observed in hepatoma (24.Cha H.H. Cram E.J. Wang E.C. Huang A.J. Kasler H.G. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1998-2007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and osteosarcoma (26.Rogatsky I. Trowbridge J.M. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3181-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) cells, p21 promoter activity (as well as protein levels; see Fig.4) is decreased, not increased, in postconfluent MC3T3-E1 cells treated with DEX (Fig. 3 C), probably in a p53-dependent manner (Fig. 3 D; see Ref. 46.Maiyar A.C. Phu P.T. Huang A.J. Firestone G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 312-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To address the mechanism underlying the GC-mediated attenuation of cell cycle progression in postconfluent MC3T3-E1 cells, we initially determined the effect of DEX on expression of the CDIs p21 and p27, which play a role in the antimitogenic activity of GC in hepatoma, lung alveolar, and osteosarcoma cells (23.Cram E.J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 3181-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A, the level of p21 is decreased, not increased, in DEX-treated MC3T3-E1 cells, thus ruling out this CDI as the mediator of the GC effect. In contrast to p21, Fig. 4 A demonstrates a >2-fold DEX-induced increase in p27 levels (2.3 ± 0.2-fold in three independent experiments), which could contribute to the inhibition of G1/S transition in DEX-treated postconfluent MC3T3-E1 cells. This possibility was further addressed by overexpression of p27. We employed the replication-competent retroviral vector ZAPd, which comprises the Moloney murine leukemia virus genome into which was inserted the IRES from the encephalomyocarditis virus (Fig.4 B).2 Efficiency of this vector in MC3T3-E1 cells was evaluated by infecting cells with pZAPd-emd, in which the GFP gene was inserted downstream of the encephalomyocarditis virus IRES (Fig. 4 B). As revealed by flow cytometry analysis for GFP expression, 9% of the cells in the infected culture expressed GFP by day 8 postinfection, and this increased to 99.1% within the following 6 additional days after passing (Fig. 4 B). Next, p27 cDNA was cloned in place of GFP, and the expression of p27 in infected MC3T3-E1 cultures was evaluated by Western analysis. As shown in Fig. 4 C (top), the pZAPd-p27-infected cells expressed p27 at levels severalfold higher than those observed in control pZAPd-emd-infected cells. These levels are also higher than those of DEX-treated (Fig. 4 A) or serum-starved cells, used as control (Fig. 4 C, top). If p27 plays a pivotal role in the DEX-induced growth inhibition, then this may be mimicked by postconfluent p27-overexpressing cells in"

Here, we report that flufenamic acid shows two opposing effects on COX-2 expression; it induces COX-2 expression in the colon cancer cell line (HT-29) and macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7); conversely, it inhibits tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)- or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced COX-2 expression. This inhibition correlates with the suppression of TNFα- or LPS-induced NFκB activation by flufenamic acid. The inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, p38, or NFκB does not affect the NSAID-induced COX-2 expression. These results suggest that the NSAID-induced COX-2 expression is not mediated through activation of NFκB and mitogen-activated protein kinases. An activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2, also induces COX-2 expression and inhibits TNFα-induced NFκB activation and COX-2 expression. Flufenamic acid and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 also inhibit LPS-induced expression of inducible form of nitric-oxide synthase and interleukin-1α in RAW 264.7 cells. Together, these results indicate that the NSAIDs inhibit mitogen-induced COX-2 expression while they induce COX-2 expression. Furthermore, the results suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of flufenamic acid and some other NSAIDs are due to their inhibitory action on the mitogen-induced expression of COX-2 and downstream markers of inflammation in addition to their inhibitory effect on COX enzyme activity.

Since the well documented pharmacological action of aspirin and other NSAIDs is the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX, the rate-limiting enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis), it can be inferred that the beneficial effect of NSAIDs may be mediated through the inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis. However, experimental evidence to support this hypothesis has not been conclusively demonstrated. Several lines of experimental observations imply that the beneficial effects of NSAIDs may be mediated through both COX-dependent and COX-independent pathways.

Evidence supporting the hypothesis that the beneficial effect of NSAIDs in reducing the risk of colon cancer is mediated by the inhibition of COX activity includes the fact that cross-breeding of APCΔ716 knockout mice with COX-2 knockout mice, or the administration of the COX-2 specific inhibitor to APCΔ716 knockouts, resulted in a dramatic reduction in the numbers and size of the intestinal polyps (12Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S.L. Oshima H. Hancock B. Kwong E. Trzaskos J.M. Evans J.F. Taketo M.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 803-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2262) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been demonstrated that the overexpression of COX-2 in intestinal epithelial cells leads to enhanced tumorigenic phenotypes, metastatic potential, and angiogenesis (13Tsujii M.

Sodium salicylate and aspirin were shown to inhibit the transcription factor NFκB (16Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). NSAIDs can also activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) α and γ, and induce differentiation of pre-adipocytes to adipocytes (17Lehmann J.M. Lenhard J.M. Oliver B.B. Ringold G.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3406-3410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Results from recent studies by Meade et al. (18Meade E.A. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol.

However, Xu et al. (19Xu X.M. Sansores-Garcia L. Chen X.M. Matijevic-Aleksic N. Du M. Wu K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, the activation of PPARα by Wy 14643 leads to the inhibition of IL-1-induced COX-2 expression in smooth muscle cells (20Staels B. Koenig W. Habib A. Merval R. Lebret M. Torra I.P.

To clarify these seemingly opposing results, we studied the effects of NSAIDs on COX-2 expression in the presence or absence of a known inducer of COX-2 expression. COX-2 expression is induced by various mitogenic stimuli in different cell types (7Kujubu D.A. Fletcher B.S. Varnum B.C. Lim R.W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

The cis-acting NFκB element is present in the 5′-flanking regions of COX-2 genes of different species (23Fletcher B.S. Kujubu D.A. Perrin D.M. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

Results from our previous studies demonstrated that the activation of NFκB is required to induce the expression of COX-2 in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophage cell line (25Hwang D. Jang B.C., Yu, G. Boudreau M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs, ERK-1 and -2, and p38) alone is not sufficient to induce the expression of COX-2, but the inhibition of ERK-1 and -2 or p38 results in partial suppression of COX-2 expression (25Hwang D.

Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα and IL-1, also activate NFκB and MAPKs, and induce the expression of COX-2 in many cell types (26Schwenger P. Alpert D. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 78-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Schwenger P. Bellosta P. Vietor I. Basilico C. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, we investigated signaling pathways through which NSAIDs modulate the expression of COX-2 in a colon tumor cell line (HT-29) treated with TNFα and a macrophage-like cell line (RAW 264.7) stimulated by LPS. If NSAIDs can modulate mitogen-induced expression of COX-2 in addition to inhibiting the enzyme activity of COX, this may represent a new mechanism of anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic actions of NSAIDs. Polyclonal antibodies for COX-1 and COX-2 were prepared and characterized as described previously (28Lee S.H. Soyoola E. Chanmugam P. Hart S. Sun W. Zhong H. Liou S. Simmons D. Hwang D. J. Biol.

Polyclonal antibodies for IκBα, iNOS, and IL-1α were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and polyclonal antibody for β-actin was from Sigma. Goat anti-mouse and donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting detection reagents were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane was purchased from Millipore (Bedford, MA). PD98059, SB203580, and piroxicam were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). NS-398 and flurbiprofen were purchased from Cayman Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). G. A. Piazza (Cell Pathways, Inc., Aurora, CO) provided sulindac sulfide. All other NSAIDs were purchased from Sigma and reconstituted in Me2SO unless otherwise specified. 3-[4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (thiazol blue) reagent was purchased from Sigma and reconstituted in PBS to give 5 μg/ml and then filter-sterilized.N-Tosyl-1-phenylalanine ketone (TPCK) was purchased from Sigma. HT-29 cells (a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, ATCC HTB-38) or RAW 264.7 cells (a murine macrophage-like cell line, ATCC TIB-71) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Intergen) and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2/air environment. Cells (2 × 106) were plated in 60-mm dishes (Falcon) and cultured for an additional 18 h to allow the number of cells to approximately double. Cells were maintained in the serum-poor (0.25% FBS) medium for another 18 h prior to the treatment with indicated reagents. These were performed essentially the same as described previously (25Hwang D. Jang B.C., Yu, G. Boudreau M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 30Chanmugam P. Feng L. Liou S. Jang B.C. Boudreau M., Yu, G. Lee J.H. Kwon H.J. Beppu T. Yoshida M. Xia Y. Wilson C.B. Hwang D.

Cells (4 × 106) were plated in 100-mm dishes and cultured in medium containing 0.25% FBS for 18 h. Fifteen minutes after the TNFα stimulation with or without various NSAIDs, cells were scraped in ice-cold PBS, pelleted, and washed with PBS one more time. Pellets were resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.3 mm EGTA, 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and incubated on ice for 20 min. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 7,200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, followed by washing with buffer A. Nuclei were resuspended in 100 μl of high salt buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 320 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and incubated on ice for 15 min. After centrifugation at 13,500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were kept at −70 °C until analyzed. The protein content of the supernatant was determined by the Bradford method. A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a tandem repeat of the consensus sequence for the NFκB binding site was used: 5′-GATCCAAGGGGACTTTCCATGGATCCAAGGGGACTTTCCATG-3′, 3′-GTTCCCCTGAAAGGTACCTAGGTTCCCCGAAAGGTACCTAG-5′. Five nanograms of double-stranded oligonucleotide were end-labeled in polynucleotide kinase buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.33 μm ATP) using T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The labeled oligonucleotides were purified by G-50 Sephadex® spin columns. Five micrograms of nuclear extract were mixed with incubation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 4% (v/v) glycerol, 0.08 mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA) and incubated at 4 °C for 15 min. The labeled oligonucleotides (40,000–100,000 cpm) were added to the preincubated mixture and the incubation continued at room temperature for 20 min. Reaction mixtures were run on a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel at 150 V until the front dye reached 2–3 cm of the bottom of the gel. Following completion of running, the gel was transferred to blotter paper and dried under vacuum. The dried gel was placed in the PhosphorImager screen and exposed overnight. Cells were plated in six-well plates (4 × 105 cells/well) and transfected with the reporter gene plasmids using SuperFect transfect reagent (Quiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. HT-29 cells or RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with 2.5 μg of NFκB response element-driven pGL2 luciferase reporter plasmid, and 0.5 μg of HSP70-lacZ as an internal control (kindly provided by Robert L. Modlin, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA). For COX-2 promoter assay, 2.5 μg of murine COX-2 gene promoter (nt-1,017/+93)-driven pGL2 luciferase reporter plasmid (gift from David Dewitt, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI) was used. After 3 h, the medium was changed and further incubated for 6 h. The cells were further incubated in medium containing 0.25% FBS for an additional 15 h. The cells were treated with flufenamic acid alone or a combination of flufenamic acid with TNFα (50 ng/ml, Sigma) or LPS in the serum-poor (0.25% FBS) medium. The luciferase activity was determined using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Luciferase activity was normalized to the internal control plasmid HSP70-lacZ by measuring β-galactosidase activity. HT-29 cells or RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with 1 μg of the chimeric receptor expression construct, pcDNA3-hPPARγ/GAL4 containing the ligand binding domain of hPPARγ and the yeast GAL4 transcription factor DNA binding domain. Ligand binding activity was measured by co-transfecting 1.5 μg of the reporter gene construct, pUAS(5x)-tk-luc, which contains five copies of GAL4 response element (kindly provided by Joel Berger, Merck Research Laboratory), and 0.5 μg of HSP70-lacZ as an internal control. After 3 h, the medium was changed and further incubated for 6 h. The cells were further incubated in the serum-poor (0.25% FBS) medium for an additional 15 h. The medium was removed and fresh medium containing various NSAIDs or 1 μm of 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2(15d-PGJ2) was added to each well and incubated for another 24 h. The luciferase activity was determined as described above. HT-29 cells or RAW 264.7 cells (2.5 × 104 cells/well) were plated in 96-well plates. After treatment with flufenamic acid for 11 h, 20 μl of 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide solution (5 μg/ml) were added to each well and incubated for additional 4 h. Insoluble formazan precipitates formed in the medium were solubilized with 100 μl of 10% SDS, 0.01 nHCl solution. Optical density at 595 nm was measured using Bio-Rad plate reader. Among various NSAIDs tested, flufenamic acid and sulindac sulfide were the most potent inhibitors of TNFα-induced NFκB activation determined by IκBα degradation in HT-29 cells (data not shown). Thus, we investigated these two NSAIDs in this report. Pretreatment of HT-29 cells with flufenamic acid shows a biphasic effect on TNFα-induced COX-2 expression: enhancement at concentrations below 200 μm but inhibition at concentrations above 200 μm (Fig.1 A). However, flufenamic acid suppressed the TNFα-induced activation of NFκB in a dose-dependent fashion without showing the biphasic effect as demonstrated by both EMSA and NFκB reporter gene assay (Fig. 1,B and C). Flufenamic acid at concentrations up to 200 μm does not affect viability of HT-29 and RAW 264.7 cells as determined by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (data not shown). However, flufenamic acid induces cell death at concentrations above 200 μm. Thus, only adherent cells were harvested and analyzed by Western blot analysis for the cells treated with flufenamic acid at concentrations above 200 μm. Similar to flufenamic acid, sulindac sulfide inhibits TNFα-induced COX-2 expression and this inhibition correlates with the suppression of TNFα-induced NFκB activation by sulindac sulfide (Fig.2, A and B). In addition, TNFα-induced COX-2 expression is suppressed by the inhibitor of NFκB (data not shown). These results suggest that the inhibition of TNFα-induced COX-2 expression by flufenamic acid or sulindac sulfide is at least in part due to its inhibitory effect on TNFα-induced NFκB activation. Next, to determine whether enhancement of TNFα-induced COX-2 expression by flufenamic acid at concentrations below 200 μm (Fig.1 A) is due to COX-2 expression induced by flufenamic acid itself, cells were treated with flufenamic acid alone in the absence of other COX-2 inducers. Flufenamic acid alone induces COX-2 expression in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig.3 A). This induction was not inhibited by the pretreatment of cells with SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38, or a mixture of inhibitors, PD98059 and TPCK, for MEK1 and NFκB, respectively (Fig. 3, B and C). Sulindac sulfide also induces COX-2 in the serum-poor medium and this induction was not inhibited by inhibitors of MAPKs or NFκB (Fig.4, A–C). Flufenamic acid and other NSAIDs alone do not induce the degradation of IκBα (data not shown). Flufenamic acid and other NSAIDs do not affect COX-1 expression in HT-29 cells (data not shown). These results suggest that the expression of COX-2 induced by NSAIDs such as flufenamic acid or sulindac sulfide is not mediated through the activation of MAPKs and NFκB signaling pathway.Figure 4COX-2 expression induced by sulindac sulfide (Si) in HT-29 cells is not inhibited by the inhibitor of p38 (SB203580) or the mixture of the inhibitors of NFκB ( TPCK ) and MEK1 (PD98059).

Thus, we determined the effects of another known activator of PPARγ on COX-2 expression in HT-29 cells. Results show that, similar to flufenamic acid, other known PPARγ activators troglitazone, indomethacin, and 15d-PGJ2 induce COX-2 expression (Fig.5). In addition, pretreatment with 15d-PGJ2 results in the inhibition of TNFα-induced IκBα degradation and COX-2 expression (Fig.6, A and B). However, indomethacin, although it induces COX-2 expression, does not inhibit TNFα-induced COX-2 expression (data not shown).Figure 6Inhibitory effects of the PPAR γ activator, 15d-PGJ2 on the TNFα-induced degradation of IκBα and COX-2 expression in HT-29 cells.

Leibowitz M.D. Doebber T.W. Elbrecht A. Zhang B. Zhou G. Biswas C. Cullinan C. Hayes N.S. Li Y. Tanen M. Ventre J. Wu M.S. Berger G.D. Mosely R. Marquis R. Santini C. Sahoo S.P. Tolman R.L. Smith R.G. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6718-6725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Treatment of HT-29 cells with flufenamic acid, sulindac sulfide, or 15d-PGJ2resulted in a significantly increased ligand binding activity to hPPARγ (Fig. 7 A). The same pattern of results was shown in RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 7 B). These results imply that flufenamic acid- and sulindac sulfide-induced COX-2 expression is mediated through the activation of PPARγ both in HT-29 cells and RAW 264.7 cells. We next determined in a cell type other than HT-29 cells whether flufenamic acid induces COX-2 expression and also inhibits activation of NFκB and COX-2 expression induced by mitogenic stimulation. Pretreatment of RAW 264.7 cells with flufenamic acid leads to a dose-dependent inhibition of LPS-stimulated transcriptional activity of COX-2 promoter and NFκB reporter genes (Fig. 8, A andC, respectively). Flufenamic acid, in the absence of other inducers of COX-2 expression, enhances transcriptional activity of COX-2 promoter-reporter gene in RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 8 B). However, flufenamic acid alone does not affect the basal promoter activity of NFκB (Fig.8 D), indicating that flufenamic-induced COX-2 expression is not mediated through the activation of NFκB. This result corroborates with the results, obtained by Western blot analyses of endogenous COX-2 protein in HT-29 cells (Fig. 3), demonstrating that the inhibitor of NFκB does not suppress flufenamic-induced COX-2 expression. Pretreatment of RAW 264.7 cells with flufenamic acid or 15d-PGJ2 leads to a dose-dependent inhibition of LPS-induced expression of iNOS and IL-1α as determined by Western blot analyses (Fig.9, A and B). These results suggest that NSAIDs, which inhibit mitogen-induced activation of NFκB, can suppress the expression of many genes whose induction is mediated in part through activation of NFκB. Our results demonstrate that NSAIDs have two opposing effects on COX-2 expression; NSAIDs inhibit cytokine-induced COX-2 expression, while NSAIDs alone can induce COX-2 expression. Results from promoter-reporter assays demonstrate that flufenamic acid inhibits LPS-induced COX-2 expression and NFκB activation in RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 8, A and C), whereas it induces COX-2 expression in the absence of LPS (Fig. 8 B). The concentrations of flufenamic acid required to inhibit LPS-induced COX-2 expression and to induce COX-2 expression are in a similar range. Thus, the magnitude of the inhibition of LPS-induced COX-2 expression by flufenamic acid might have been even greater if there was no simultaneous induction of COX-2. In HT-29 cells, enhancement of TNFα-induced COX-2 expression by flufenamic acid at 200 μm or lower is likely due to the fact that the additive induction of COX-2 expression by flufenamic acid is greater than its inhibitory effect on TNFα-induced COX-2 expression at these concentrations. However, the inhibitory effect of flufenamic acid on TNFα-induced COX-2 expression at higher concentrations may far exceed the additive induction of COX-2 expression by flufenamic acid. Flufenamic acid does not cause cell death at concentrations up to 200 μm; however, it induces cell death at concentrations above 200 μm. It has been well documented that activation of NFκB suppresses apoptotic signals in many cell types (36Ferreira V. Sidénius N. Tarantino N. Hubert P. Chatenoud L. Basi F. Körner M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6442-6450PubMed Google Scholar, 37Schneider A. Martin-Villalba A Weih F. Vogel J. Wirth T. Schwaninger M. Nat.

Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar); conversely, inhibition of NFκB can induce apoptosis. Thus, it is likely that induction of apoptosis and inhibition of TNFα-induced COX-2 expression by flufenamic acid are mediated through a common signaling pathway, i.e. inhibition of NFκB. Flufenamic acid does not have an opposing effect on NFκB activation. In both cell types, pretreatment with flufenamic acid leads to a dose-dependent inhibition of TNFα- or LPS-induced NFκB activation. Flufenamic acid alone does not cause NFκB activation. Many NSAIDs bind and activate PPARs and some PPAR activators have been shown to inhibit NFκB activity (17Lehmann J.M. Lenhard J.M. Oliver B.B. Ringold G.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol.

TNFα-induced COX-2 expression in HT-29 cells was inhibited by flufenamic acid, sulindac sulfide, or 15d-PGJ2, all of which bind PPARγ (Fig. 7). However, indomethacin, a known activator of PPARγ, does not inhibit TNFα-induced COX-2 expression and NFκB activation (data not shown). It was previously shown that, unlike sulindac sulfide, indomethacin does not inhibit IκB kinase (40Yin M.J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar, 41Yamamoto Y. Yin M.J. Lin K.M. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27307-27314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that not all PPAR activators inhibit NFκB activation (21Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar) and cytokine production in macrophages (42Thieringer R.

Together, these results suggest that the inhibition of TNFα-induced COX-2 expression or NFκB activation by flufenamic acid is not mediated through the activation of PPARs. Furthermore, these results suggest that NSAIDs such as indomethacin, which do not inhibit mitogen-induced activation of NFκB, are unable to inhibit the mitogen-induced COX-2 expression. The molecular target through which flufenamic acid inhibits TNFα- or LPS-induced NFκB activation is not known. Recent studies have demonstrated that aspirin and sodium salicylate suppress NFκB activation by inhibition of IκB kinase β (16Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar, 40Yin M.J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar, 43Grilli M. Pizzi M. Memo M. Spano P. Science. 1996; 274: 1383-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Another study has demonstrated that 15d-PGJ2 inhibits NFκB by a covalent modification of a cysteine residue within its activation loop of IκB kinase β (21Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). This irreversible modification is rendered by the formation of Michael adducts between a reactive α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group in the cyclopentane ring of 15d-PGJ2 and cellular nucleophiles such as compounds containing free SH group. Salicylate and flufenamic acid do not appear to possess such a reactive group for nucleophilic attack in their structure. Thus, the mode of action in inhibiting NFκB by flufenamic acid is likely different from that of 15d-PGJ2. The flufenamic acid- or sulindac sulfide-induced COX-2 expression was not affected by either the inhibitor of p38 or by inhibitors of NFκB and MEK1 (Figs. 3 and 4). These results indicate that, unlike the TNFα-induced COX-2 expression, the NSAID-induced COX-2 expression is mediated through signaling pathways that do not require the activation of MAPKs and NFκB. Some NSAIDs and 15d-PGJ2, which are known to activate PPARγ, induce COX-2 expression in the absence of other inducers of COX-2 expression (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). Aspirin and sodium salicylate which do not activate PPARs (17Lehmann J.M. Lenhard J.M. Oliver B.B. Ringold G.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3406-3410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar) were unable to induce COX-2 expression (data not shown). Together, these results suggest, but do not prove, that flufenamic acid- and sulindac sulfide-induced COX-2 expression is mediated through the activation of PPARγ. The pharmacological significance of the induction of COX-2 expression by NSAIDs is not known. Since NSAIDs inhibit the activity of COX-2 expressed in tissues in response to NSAIDs, the inhibitory effect of NSAIDs on cytokine-induced COX-2 expression would be a more important net effect. It has been a prevailing belief that the efficacy of NSAIDs is due to their inhibitory effect on COX activity. However, the therapeutic benefit of NSAIDs is observed at plasma concentrations substantially higher than those required to inhibit COX (34McEvoy, G. K. (ed) (1997) AHFS 97 Drug Information, American Society of Health-Systems Pharmacists, Bethesda, MDGoogle Scholar). Emerging evidence now suggests that NSAIDs can also exert their anti-inflammatory and possible anti-tumor effects through COX-independent pathways (35Jiang C. Ting A.T. Seed B. Nature. 1998; 391: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrating that NSAIDs inhibit TNFα-induced activation of NFκB signaling pathways suggest that NSAIDs can inhibit the cellular responses to pro-inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting the downstream signaling pathways derived from the activation of cytokine receptors. Furthermore, flufenamic acid inhibits not only COX-2 expression (Fig.8) but also the expression of other inflammatory marker gene products such as iNOS and IL-1α induced by LPS in RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 9). These results suggest that NSAIDs inhibit not only downstream signaling pathways derived from the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokine receptors, but also the expression of pro-inflammatory marker gene products in response to inflammatory stimuli. Macrophages, important components of stromal cells in tumor tissues, can release cytokines, which in turn stimulate tumor cells and other stromal cells to induce the expression of COX-2. Our results suggest that NSAIDs can inhibit both the production of cytokines by macrophages, and the induction of COX-2 by tumor cells in response to the cytokines. These effects may represent an additional mechanism by which NSAIDs exert their anti-inflammatory and possible anti-neoplastic effects. In summary, our results presented here suggest that the pharmacological effects of NSAIDs are mediated not only through the inhibition of COX activity but also the modulation of the expression of COX-2 and other pro-inflammatory marker gene products.

https://openalex.org/W2094007125,"Abstract Members of the ETS family of transcription factors are involved in several developmental and physiological processes, and, when overexpressed or misexpressed, can contribute to a variety of cancers. Each family member has a conserved DNA-binding domain that recognizes DNA sequences containing a G-G-A trinucleotide. Discrimination between potential ETS-binding sites appears to be governed by both the nucleotides flanking the G-G-A sequence and protein-protein interactions. We have used an adaptation of the “length-encoded multiplex” approach (Desjarlais, J. R., and Berg, J. M. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.91, 11099–11103) to define DNA binding specificities for four ETS proteins: Fli-1, SAP-1, PU.1, and TEL. Our results support a model in which cooperative effects among neighboring bases flanking the central G-G-A site contribute to the formation of stable ETS/DNA complexes. These results are consistent with a mechanism for specific DNA binding that is partially governed by an indirect read-out of the DNA sequence, in which a sequence-specific DNA conformation is sensed or induced."
https://openalex.org/W2031496282,"Creatine kinase (CK) exists as a family of isoenzymes in excitable tissue. We studied isolated perfused hearts from mice lacking genes for either the main muscle isoform of CK (M-CK) or both M-CK and the main mitochondrial isoform (Mt-CK) to determine 1) the biological significance of CK isoenzyme shifts, 2) the necessity of maintaining a high CK reaction rate, and 3) the role of CK isoenzymes in establishing the thermodynamics of ATP hydrolysis.31P NMR was used to measure [ATP], [PCr], [Pi], [ADP], pH, as well as the unidirectional reaction rate of PCr → [γ-P]ATP. Developmental changes in the main fetal isoform of CK (BB-CK) were unaffected by loss of other CK isoenzymes. In hearts lacking both M- and Mt-CK, the rate of ATP synthesis from PCr was only 9% of the rate of ATP synthesis from oxidative phosphorylation demonstrating a lack of any high energy phosphate shuttle. We also found that the intrinsic activities of the BB-CK and the MM-CK isoenzymes were equivalent. Finally, combined loss of M- and Mt-CK (but not loss of only M-CK) prevented the amount of free energy released from ATP hydrolysis from increasing when pyruvate was provided as a substrate for oxidative phosphorylation. Creatine kinase (CK) exists as a family of isoenzymes in excitable tissue. We studied isolated perfused hearts from mice lacking genes for either the main muscle isoform of CK (M-CK) or both M-CK and the main mitochondrial isoform (Mt-CK) to determine 1) the biological significance of CK isoenzyme shifts, 2) the necessity of maintaining a high CK reaction rate, and 3) the role of CK isoenzymes in establishing the thermodynamics of ATP hydrolysis.31P NMR was used to measure [ATP], [PCr], [Pi], [ADP], pH, as well as the unidirectional reaction rate of PCr → [γ-P]ATP. Developmental changes in the main fetal isoform of CK (BB-CK) were unaffected by loss of other CK isoenzymes. In hearts lacking both M- and Mt-CK, the rate of ATP synthesis from PCr was only 9% of the rate of ATP synthesis from oxidative phosphorylation demonstrating a lack of any high energy phosphate shuttle. We also found that the intrinsic activities of the BB-CK and the MM-CK isoenzymes were equivalent. Finally, combined loss of M- and Mt-CK (but not loss of only M-CK) prevented the amount of free energy released from ATP hydrolysis from increasing when pyruvate was provided as a substrate for oxidative phosphorylation. creatine kinase mice lacking M-CK mice lacking both M-CK and Mt-CK the amount of free energy released from ATP hydrolysis phosphocreatine Creatine kinase (CK,1 EC2.7.3.2) plays a central role in the energetics of excitable cells, catalyzing the transfer of a phosphoryl moiety between creatine and ADP in the reaction PCr + ADP + H+ ↔ ATP + creatine (K eq of 1.66 × 109mol/l−1). CK exists as a family of five isoenzymes, three dimers located in the cytoplasm (MM, MB, and BB-CK) and two multimers that connect the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes (sarcomeric and ubiquitous Mt-CK). The distribution of these CK isoenzymes is tissue-specific, developmentally regulated, and changes in disease, especially in the heart (1.Nascimben L. Ingwall J.S. Pauletto P. Friedrich J. Gwathmey J.K. Saks V. Pessina A.C. Allen P.D. Circulation. 1996; 94: 1894-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 2.Ingwall J.S. Kramer M. Friedman W. Jacobus W.E. Ingwall J.S. Heart Creatine Kinase: The Integration of Isoenzymes for Energy Distribution. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1980: 9-17Google Scholar). During development in the heart, BB-CK activity decreases while MM-CK, and later Mt-CK, activities increase. The capacity for ATP synthesis via oxidative phosphorylation also increases during this time. Because the CK reaction is coupled to ATP synthesis, the developmental changes in CK may also be linked to substrate preference for ATP synthesis of the developing heart. Despite the fact that CK is one of the most abundant enzymes in the heart and plays a central role in the energetics of cardiac muscle, many questions about the biochemistry of CK isoenzymes remain unanswered. Several of these long-standing questions regarding the function of CK isoenzymes in the heart can be directly addressed by studying the hearts from mice bioengineered to lack either the most abundant muscle isoform (MM-CK) or the two most abundant isoforms (MM-CK and Mt-CK). Here we address four questions central to the role of CK isoenzymes in the heart. The first question is whether a feedback system exists linking changes in the amount of one isoenzyme with a change in the amounts of other isoenzymes. Such a system is suggested by the observations that a reciprocal relationship exists between BB-CK and MM-CK during both development and heart failure (1.Nascimben L. Ingwall J.S. Pauletto P. Friedrich J. Gwathmey J.K. Saks V. Pessina A.C. Allen P.D. Circulation. 1996; 94: 1894-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 2.Ingwall J.S. Kramer M. Friedman W. Jacobus W.E. Ingwall J.S. Heart Creatine Kinase: The Integration of Isoenzymes for Energy Distribution. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1980: 9-17Google Scholar). The second question is, what are the kinetic properties of each of the CK isoenzymes in the intact beating heart? The properties of the individual isoenzymes determine whether the changes in isoenzyme distribution that occur during development and disease confer a kinetic advantage or disadvantage for maintaining high [ATP]. The third issue is whether the rate of ATP synthesis via the CK reaction can fall below the rate of ATP synthesis from oxidative phosphorylation. It has been suggested that localization of specific CK isoenzymes in the mitochondria and sites of ATP utilization form an “energy shuttle” whereby PCr serves as an efficient energy transfer molecule. Whether this shuttling of phosphoryl moieties is obligatory remains controversial (3.Bessman S.P. Carpenter C.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 831-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 4.Aliev M.K. Saks V.A. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 428-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 5.Meyer R.A.

Cell Muscle Motil. 1985; 6: 239-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but can be directly tested in hearts lacking CK isoenzymes. The fourth issue addressed here is the role of specific CK isoenzymes in determining the thermodynamics of ATP hydrolysis in the heart. It is well established that the amount of free energy released from ATP hydrolysis (ΔG ATP) varies in the heart depending on which substrates for oxidative phosphorylation are present (7.Balschi J.A. Shen H. Madden M.C. Hai J.O. Bradley Jr., E.L. Wolkowicz P.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 3123-3133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). What role the CK isoenzymes play in this modulation of ΔG ATP is not known. To address these questions, hearts from wild type mice and mice lacking genes for M-CK (8.Van Deursen J. Heerschap A.

In addition to measuring CK isoenzyme distribution and V max,31P NMR spectroscopy was used to measure [ATP], [PCr], [Pi], [ADP], ‖ΔG ATP‖, and pH in the isolated, beating hearts. Additionally, the unidirectional flux through the CK reaction (rate of ATP synthesis from PCr or CKvelocity) was measured using 31P magnetization transfer in isolated, beating hearts. MCK−/− and M/MtCK−/− mice were provided by Dr. Bè Wieringa, University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands (8.Van Deursen J. Heerschap A. Oerlemans F. Ruitenbeek W. Jap P. ter Laak H. Wieringa B. Cell. 1993; 74: 621-631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 11.Steeghs K. Benders A. Oerlemans F. de Haan A. Heerschap A. Ruitenbeek W. Jost C. van Deursen J. Perryman B.

Hearts from fetal (20, 24, and 27 days post-conception), neonatal (1, 3, and 7 days post-partum), young (15 and 25 days post-partum), and adult mice (25–40 weeks of age) were rapidly excised and frozen to define the developmental pattern of change in CK V max and CK isoenzyme distribution, confirming the genotype. 185 hearts were studied, 5–15 at each time point for wild type, MCK−/−, and M/MtCK−/−. Isolated perfused beating hearts from adult mice were studied to measure CKvelocity using 31P magnetization transfer (5 wild type, 5 MCK−/−, and 5 M/MtCK−/−). This group consisted of relatively old mice (60–70 weeks) because they had larger hearts, which improved the signal to noise ratio and provided the sensitivity necessary to detect the very low level of CKvelocity in M/MtCK−/−hearts. A second set of hearts was perfused with glucose as the sole exogenous metabolic substrate (20 wild type, 13 MCK−/−, and 12 M/MtCK) or with both glucose and pyruvate (10 wild type, 10 MCK−/−, and 9 M/MtCK−/−). This group consisted of both male and female mice 25–40 weeks old. For each heart isovolumic contractile function and energetics (using31P NMR spectroscopy) were measured simultaneously. The experimental protocols were approved by the Standing Committee on Animals of Harvard Medical Area and followed the recommendations of the National Institutes of Health and American Physiological Society guidelines for the use and care of laboratory animals. Total CK activity (CKV max) and the amount of activity attributable to each isoenzyme of CK was measured (12.Saupe K.W. Spindler M. Tian R. Ingwall J.S. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 13.Rosalki S.B. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1967; 69: 696-705PubMed Google Scholar). Since 5–10 mg of tissue was needed for this measurement, where necessary, tissue from 3 to 4 fetal hearts was pooled for analysis. CK activities were measured in units of IU per mg of protein and converted to mm/s using the measured concentrations of cardiac protein. All values are expressed as mm/s at 37 °C. To determine whether B-CK (i.e. the monomer peptide) expression is affected by loss of M-CK or the combined loss of M-CK and Mt-CK, direct comparison of the amounts of BB-CK in the three types of hearts is inadequate. Some B-CK monomers exist as MB-CK in wild type hearts, whereas in MCK−/− and M/MtCK−/− hearts, all B-CK is in the form of BB-CK. Therefore, for wild type hearts we calculate the amount of BB-CK that would form if M-CK was not present (0.5 × MB-CK), and we added this to the measured amount of BB-CK. The myocardial contents of ATP (via high pressure liquid chromatography), creatine (14.Kammermeier H. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and protein (15.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were determined in a separate group of freeze-clamped hearts (5 wild type, 5 MCK−/−, and 5 M/MtCK−/−). For ATP, content was converted to concentration using the measured values for protein concentration, which average 0.16 mg of protein/mg wet weight, and the literature value for the ratio of intracellular volume to total cell volume of 0.48 (16.Polimeni P.I. Buraczewski S.I. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1988; 20: 15-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The concentrations of ATP (mm) were 9.6 ± 0.1, 9.4 ± 0.2, and 9.3 ± 0.2 for wild type, MCK−/−, and M/MtCK−/− hearts, respectively (not significant among groups). Total creatine content was 28.2 ± 0.5 mm in wild types, 32.1 ± 0.7 in MCK−/−, and 30.5 ± 0.6 in M/MtCK−/−hearts (not significant among groups). Myocardial oxygen consumption was calculated from the relationship we previously established between rate-pressure-product and myocardial oxygen consumption for wild type, MCK−/−, and M/MtCK−/− hearts (12.Saupe K.W. Spindler M. Tian R. Ingwall J.S. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Hearts were isolated and perfused in the Langendorff mode (12.Saupe K.W. Spindler M. Tian R. Ingwall J.S. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The coronary perfusate consisted of phosphate-free Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing (mm) NaCl (118), KCl (5.3), CaCl2 (2.0), MgSO4 (1.2), EDTA (0.5), and NaHCO3 (25), equilibrated with 95% O2 + 5% CO2 yielding a pH of 7.4. Either glucose alone (10.Van Dorsten F.A. Nederhoff M.G. Nicolay K. Van Echteld C.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H1191-H1199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or glucose in combination with pyruvate (0.5) was added as described above. All hearts, except those undergoing magnetization transfer, were paced at 7 Hz. 31P NMR spectra were obtained at 161.94 MHz using a GE-400 wide-bore Omega spectrometer (Freemont, CA) (12.Saupe K.W. Spindler M. Tian R. Ingwall J.S. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The measured ATP resonance areas/mg wet weight for wild type, MCK−/−, and M/MtCK−/− hearts were not different, averaging 268 ± 11, 250 ± 10, and 282 ± 16, respectively. This confirmed our finding, made using high pressure liquid chromatography, that [ATP] was not different among groups. The ATP resonance area of each heart was used as an internal standard to convert resonance areas of PCr and Pi to their respective concentrations. Intracellular pH was determined by comparing the chemical shift of the Pi and PCr peaks in each spectrum to values from a standard curve. Cytosolic free [ADP] was calculated using the equilibrium constant of the CK reaction (17.Lawson J.W. Veech R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6528-6537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and from values obtained by NMR spectroscopy and biochemical assays (Equation 1), [ADP]=([ATP][free Cr])/([PCr][H+]Keq)Equation 1 K eq = 1.66 × 109mol/liter−1 for a [Mg2+] of 1.0 mm. For purposes of clarity all values of ΔG ATP are expressed as their absolute values as shown in Equation 2, ‖ΔGATP‖(kJ/mol)=‖ΔG0+RT ln([ADP][Pi]/[ATP])‖Equation 2 where ΔG 0 (−30.5 kJ/mol) is the value of ΔG ATP under standard conditions of molarity, temperature, pH, and [Mg2+]; R is the gas constant (8.3 J/mol K), and T is in Kelvin (18.Gibbs C. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1985; 17: 727-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Magnetization transfer measurement of the forward velocity of the CK reaction, ADP + PCr → ATP + creatine, was made using the two-site chemical exchange (PCr → [γ-31P]ATP) model of Forsen and Hoffmann, providing estimates of the pseudo first-order rate constant (k for) (19.Forsen S. Hoffmann R.A. J. Chem. Phys. 1963; 39: 2892-2901Crossref Scopus (1094) Google Scholar), as modified using aM 0 M ∞ sequence developed in our laboratory (20.Friedrich J. Nascimben L. Liao R. Ingwall J.S. Magn. Reson. Med. 1993; 30: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Each of the magnetization transfer spectra consisted of scans accumulated by repetitively cycling through the two different times of presaturation (0 and 4.8 s). The integrated signal intensity of the PCr resonance peak decays fromM 0 to M ∞ (magnetization at zero and infinite saturation times, respectively) as [γ-31P]ATP is saturated. k forwas calculated as k for = (M 0 −M ∞)/(T 1 ×M ∞) using the literature value forT 1 of 3.5 s (20.Friedrich J. Nascimben L. Liao R. Ingwall J.S. Magn. Reson. Med. 1993; 30: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Multiplying the rate constant k for by the substrate (PCr) concentration yields the forward velocity of the CK reaction, CKvelocity = k for [PCr]. Acquisition of these spectra required 5 h, during which time contractile function decreased by only 10–20%. In wild type hearts CK V max increased rapidly from day −7 to day 1 due to an increase in MM-CK (Fig.1). From day 7 to day 15, CKV max continued to increase due to an increase in Mt-CK. In hearts containing only Mt-CK and BB-CK, CKV max did not increase prior to day 1; instead,V max increased only gradually after day 7 due to an increase in Mt-CK. Although Mt-CK increased after day 7 in these hearts, they had less Mt-CK activity from day 15 through adulthood than wild types (Fig. 1 and Table I). In hearts containing only BB-CK, CK V max did not increase after birth. Instead, V max gradually decreased. Since all three groups showed the same developmental pattern of change in BB-CK, it is apparent that the post-natal decrease in BB-CK is independent of accumulation of M-CK, Mt-CK, or total CK. Thus, the developmental pattern of change in BB-CK was not affected by deletion of CK isoenzymes nor was the timing of the increase in Mt-CK. However, the magnitude of the increase in Mt-CK was less in hearts lacking MM-CK than in wild types.Table ICreatine kinase isoenzyme distribution and activity (Vmax) in adult mouse heartsWild typeMCK−/−M/MtCK−/−Total CK (mm/s)46.9 ± 1.012.2 ± 1.0 aSignificantly different from wild types.1.0 ± 0.1 aSignificantly different from wild types.MMCK (mm/s)27.6 ± 2.600MBCK (mm/s)1.5 ± 0.300BBCK (mm/s)0.7 ± 0.1 bIf BCK monomers from MBCK are added to BBCK, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” the total is 1.5 ± 0.1.0.8 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.1MtCK (mm/s)17.0 ± 1.911.4 ± 0.9 aSignificantly different from wild types.0MMCK (% total)58.9 ± 1.400MBCK (% total)3.3 ± 0.300BBCK (% total)1.5 ± 0.26.5 ± 0.5100MtCK (% total)36.3 ± 1.393.5 ± 0.50a Significantly different from wild types.b If BCK monomers from MBCK are added to BBCK, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” the total is 1.5 ± 0.1. Open table in a new tab 31P magnetization transfer provides a measure of CK reaction velocity in the intact beating heart. Representative 31P magnetization transfer spectra for hearts containing all CK isoenzymes, only Mt-CK and BB-CK and only BB-CK are shown in Fig. 2. Mean values for k for and CKvelocity are shown in Table II. The decrease in the PCr resonance area during selective saturation was less in hearts containing only BB-CK and Mt-CK than in wild types, reflecting a decreased rate of ATP synthesis from PCr (CKvelocity) secondary to loss of MM-CK. In hearts containing only BB-CK there was a small but detectable CKvelocity. CKvelocity was 6.2 and 2.9 times the rate of oxidative ATP synthesis in wild type hearts and those lacking MM-CK, respectively. In hearts with only BB-CK, CKvelocity was 9% the rate of oxidative ATP synthesis (Table II).Table IIRelationship between in vivo CK reaction velocity and rate of oxidative ATP synthesisWild typesMCK−/−M/MtCK−/−k for (/s)0.48 ± 0.030.20 ± 0.01 aSignificantly less than wild types.0.008 ± 0.002 aSignificantly less than wild types.CKvelocity(mm/s)7.24 ± 0.453.03 ± 0.14 aSignificantly less than wild types.0.09 ± 0.03 aSignificantly less than wild types.CKvelocity/CKV max0.15 ± 0.010.25 ± 0.02 bSignificantly greater than wild types or M/MtCK−/−.0.09 ± 0.03Rate of oxidative ATP synthesis (mm/s) cBased on the relationship between rate, pressure and product and myocardial oxygen consumption established in these three types of hearts (12) and a P:O ratio of 3.1.161.051.03CKvelocity/ATP synthesis rate6.22.90.09a Significantly less than wild types.b Significantly greater than wild types or M/MtCK−/−.c Based on the relationship between rate, pressure and product and myocardial oxygen consumption established in these three types of hearts (12.Saupe K.W.

Open table in a new tab The values for CKvelocity and CKV max for the three types of hearts can be used to calculate the ratio of CKvelocity/CKV max for each of the pure isoenzymes (BB-CK, MM-CK, and Mt-CK). For BB-CK this ratio was 0.09, since this was the measured ratio for hearts with only BB-CK. Based on our finding that hearts that were 94% Mt-CK and 6% BB-CK had a CKvelocity/CK V max of 0.25, the CKvelocity/CK V max of Mt-CK was calculated to be 0.26. By using the values of 0.09 for BB-CK and 0.26 for Mt-CK, we calculated that MM-CK in wild type hearts had a CKvelocity/CK V max of 0.10. Thus, BB-CK and MM-CK have the same CKvelocity/CKV max, whereas the ratio for Mt-CK is ∼2.5 times higher. In wild type hearts, including pyruvate in the perfusate as a substrate for oxidative phosphorylation caused the expected changes in energetics as [PCr] increased, whereas [Pi] and [ADP] decreased, resulting in an increased ‖ΔG ATP‖ (TableIII). In hearts that contained only MtCK and BBCK, including pyruvate in the perfusate affected the thermodynamics of ATP hydrolysis in the same way as wild types. In contrast, hearts that contained only BB-CK failed to increase ‖ΔG ATP‖ in response to pyruvate. Therefore, the combined loss of MM-CK and Mt-CK (but not loss of only MM-CK) prevented hearts from increasing ‖ΔG ATP‖ when administered pyruvate as a substrate for oxidative phosphorylation.Table IIIEffect of including pyruvate in the coronary perfusate on cardiac energeticsWild typeMCK−/−M/MtCK−/−GlucoseGlucose + pyruvateGlucoseGlucose + pyruvateGlucoseGlucose + pyruvatePCr (mM)12.2 ± 0.716.4 ± 0.7 aSignificantly different from glucose alone.12.2 ± 0.715.4 ± 1.5 aSignificantly different from glucose alone.8.8 ± 0.510.0 ± 0.6Pi (mm)7.5 ± 0.44.9 ± 0.6 aSignificantly different from glucose alone.8.6 ± 0.34.9 ± 0.2 aSignificantly different from glucose alone.6.9 ± 0.65.7 ± 0.6ADP (μ m)131 ± 1163 ± 6 aSignificantly different from glucose alone.143 ± 11100 ± 16 aSignificantly different from glucose alone.201 ± 12170 ± 13‖ΔG ATP‖ (kJ/mol)54.4 ± 0.357.4 ± 0.3 aSignificantly different from glucose alone.53.7 ± 0.356.3 ± 0.5 aSignificantly different from glucose alone.53.3 ± 0.454.3 ± 0.4a Significantly different from glucose alone. Open table in a new tab The main findings of this study were as follows. First, loss of M-CK and loss of both M-CK and Mt-CK had little or no effect on either the normal developmental change in the amount of the remaining isoenzymes or the final amounts present in adult hearts. Second, the CKvelocity/CK V max of BB-CK and MM-CK were very similar, which suggests that isoenzyme shifts during development and disease do not confer any obvious kinetic advantage. Third, in hearts containing only BB-CK the rate of CKvelocity was only a small fraction of the rate of ATP synthesis from oxidative phosphorylation, demonstrating that phosphoryl shuttling is not obligatory. Finally, the combined loss of M-CK and Mt-CK, but not loss of only M-CK, prevented hearts from significantly increasing ‖ΔG ATP‖ when perfused with pyruvate as a substrate for oxidative phosphorylation. Expression of the isoenzymes of CK in the heart is developmentally regulated (2.Ingwall J.S. Kramer M. Friedman W. Jacobus W.E. Ingwall J.S. Heart Creatine Kinase: The Integration of Isoenzymes for Energy Distribution. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1980: 9-17Google Scholar). Both the developmental and tissue-specific regulation of CK expression can be explained by cis-acting elements (21.Qin W. Khuchua Z. Cheng J. Boero J. Payne R.M. Strauss A.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 184: 153-167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the genes for the CK isoenzymes are on different chromosomes, it may also be that trans-acting elements are involved in the coordinated expression of CK isoenzymes. During late fetal and neonatal development, expression of both MM-CK and Mt-CK increases dramatically, whereas BB-CK peaks at birth and then declines (Fig. 1) (2.Ingwall J.S. Kramer M. Friedman W. Jacobus W.E. Ingwall J.S. Heart Creatine Kinase: The Integration of Isoenzymes for Energy Distribution. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1980: 9-17Google Scholar). What triggers and coordinates these changes is largely unknown. One possibility is that a change in the amount of one isoenzyme triggers the appropriate changes in the other isoenzymes. Our data indicate that this is not the case, since loss of either MM-CK or both MM-CK and Mt-CK had no effect on the normal post-partum decrease in BB-CK. Also demonstrating the independence of CK isoenzyme regulation during development is the observation that the timing of post-natal increase in Mt-CK was not affected by loss of MM-CK. However, the magnitude of the increase in Mt-CK was less in hearts lacking MM-CK than wild types for unknown reasons. This independence of isoenzyme regulation during development is consistent with the finding in adult heart and skeletal muscle that loss of MM-CK does not cause a compensatory increase in Mt-CK (9.Veksler V.I. Kuznetsov A.V. Anflous K. Mateo P. van Deursen J. Wieringa B. Ventura-Clapier R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19921-19929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Less clear, due to the difficulty in quantifying the small amount of cardiac BB-CK, is whether loss of MM-CK causes an increase in BB-CK (9.Veksler V.I. Kuznetsov A.V. Anflous K. Mateo P. van Deursen J. Wieringa B. Ventura-Clapier R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19921-19929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrated that no compensatory increase in BB-CK occurred in hearts lacking MM-CK and furthermore that even loss of both MM-CK and Mt-CK did not alter the amount of BB-CK. Overall, our results in the developing and mature myocardium demonstrate that the amount of each CK isoenzyme is influenced surprisingly little, if at all, by changes in the amounts of the other isoenzymes. In the healthy mammalian heart, the rate of ATP turnover via the CK reaction (CKvelocity) is 5–10-fold higher than the net rate of ATP synthesis from glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation combined. Therefore on average each molecule of ATP synthesized from glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation is converted back and forth between ATP and PCr many times before it is finally hydrolyzed to ADP and Pi. It has been suggested that this high CKvelocity exists to facilitate movement of phosphoryl moieties from their primary site of synthesis (mitochondria), via the more easily diffusable PCr, to the primary site of hydrolysis (cytosolic ATPases) (3.Bessman S.P. Carpenter C.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 831-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 4.Aliev M.K. Saks V.A. Biophys.

Here for the first time we were able to measure the low rate of CKvelocity in hearts containing only BB-CK, and we found that the CKvelocity is only 9% of the rate of oxidative ATP synthesis. This means that transport of ATP from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm is accomplished without the use of PCr as an obligatory intermediate in these hearts. The CKvelocitymeasured in hearts containing only BB-CK, although low compared with wild type hearts, is still adequate to explain our previous finding that M/MtCK−/− hearts can hydrolyze normal amounts of PCr during increased work and have no obvious contractile deficits (12.Saupe K.W. Spindler M. Tian R. Ingwall J.S. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In that study approximately 4 mm PCr was hydrolyzed in 6 min. This would require a CKvelocity of only 0.01 mm/s, well below the measured value of 0.09 mm/s. A similar situation likely exists in skeletal muscle from MCK−/− mice where PCr was hydrolyzed at a normal rate even though the CKvelocity was immeasurable (8.Van Deursen J. Heerschap A. Oerlemans F. Ruitenbeek W. Jap P. ter Laak H. Wieringa B. Cell. 1993; 74: 621-631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The ratio of CKvelocity to CKV max indicates how fast the CK reaction is proceeding relative to its maximal capacity and has previously been reported for purified CK isoenzymes in solution (22.Van Dorsten F.A. Furter R. Bijkerk M. Wallimann T. Nicolay K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1274: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In solution, CKvelocity/CK V max was 0.15 for MM-CK and 0.30 for Mt-CK. When purified isoenzymes are studied in solution, the CKvelocity/CK V maxratio provides information about the intrinsic properties of the proteins and defines substrate control of enzyme velocity. When measured in living tissue, this ratio also reflects the influences of any additional regulatory systems (23.Ponticos M. Lu Q.L. Morgan J.E. Hardie D.G. Partridge T.A. Carling D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1688-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). By using results obtained in the present study, we calculate the CKvelocity/CKV max for the individual CK isoenzymes in beating hearts. The values we measured for the CK isoenzymes in intact beating hearts are similar to those found for purified enzymes in solution. This suggests that, at least under our perfusion conditions and for hearts containing normal CK substrate concentrations, minimal non-substrate regulation occurs in the heart in vivo and that the reaction rate is primarily under substrate control. Furthermore, the finding that the CKvelocity/CKV max of BB-CK (0.09) is no larger that MM-CK (0.10) suggests that the isoenzyme shift toward the fetal pattern of expression during cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure confers no obvious kinetic advantage. Little is known regarding the mechanism(s) by which altering the availability of substrates for oxidative phosphorylation affects ‖ΔG ATP‖ (7.Balschi J.A. Shen H. Madden M.C. Hai J.O. Bradley Jr., E.L. Wolkowicz P.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 3123-3133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It is reasonable to expect that they depend at least in part on an intact CK system since the reaction catalyzed by CK maintains [ATP] high and the concentrations of its hydrolysis products (ADP and Pi) low. Supporting a relationship between CK and ‖ΔG ATP‖ are data that demonstrated that severe acute inhibition of CK led to a fall in ‖ΔG ATP‖ (24.Tian R. Ingwall J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1207-H1216PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report that wild type hearts and hearts containing MM-CK and Mt-CK increased ‖ΔG ATP‖ in response to supplying pyruvate. In contrast, hearts with only BB-CK failed to increase ‖ΔG ATP‖ when supplied with pyruvate. These results raise the possibility that substrate-dependent changes in ‖ΔG ATP‖ may depend on Mt-CK, the isoenzyme primarily responsible for PCr synthesis. Alternatively. it may be that the CKvelocity rate in these hearts is inadequate to maintain [ADP] low and [PCr] high. We are not able to distinguish between these two possibilities."
https://openalex.org/W2083927760,"Activation of the serine/threonine kinase, protein kinase D (PKD/PKCμ) via a phorbol ester/PKC-dependent pathway involves phosphorylation events. The present study identifies five in vivophosphorylation sites by mass spectrometry, and the role of four of them was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis. Four sites are autophosphorylation sites, the first of which (Ser916) is located in the C terminus; its phosphorylation modifies the conformation of the kinase and influences duration of kinase activation but is not required for phorbol ester-mediated activation of PKD. The second autophosphorylation site (Ser203) lies in that region of the regulatory domain, which in PKCμ interacts with 14-3-3τ. The last two autophosphorylation sites (Ser744and Ser748) are located in the activation loop but are only phosphorylated in the isolated PKD-catalytic domain and not in the full-length PKD; they may affect enzyme catalysis but are not involved in the activation of wild-type PKD by phorbol ester. We also present evidence for proteolytic activation of PKD. The fifth site (Ser255) is transphosphorylated downstream of a PKC-dependent pathway after in vivo stimulation with phorbol ester. In vivo phorbol ester stimulation of an S255E mutant no longer requires PKC-mediated events. In conclusion, our results show that PKD is a multisite phosphorylated enzyme and suggest that its phosphorylation may be an intricate process that regulates its biological functions in very distinct ways.

Sinnet-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 2.Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKD contains two cysteine-rich domains that bind diacylglycerol or phorbol ester, but it lacks the calcium binding domain seen in the classical PKCs. However, PKD also contains a pleckstrin homology domain that regulates its kinase activity (3.Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 410-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) but does not harbor the typical PKC autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate motif. Moreover, the PKD catalytic domain is only distantly related to the kinase subdomains of the PKC family but shows homology to that of the Ca2+-regulated kinases, such as myosin light chain kinase and calcium/calmodulin kinase I. Finally, the substrate specificity of PKD is probably different from that of other PKCs, because it is specific for a unique peptide sequence (4.Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). These characteristics have rendered it difficult to classify PKD in the scheme of protein kinases (5.Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar), and PKD might be the first member of a new protein kinase family and/or subgroup. Regulation of protein kinases is achieved through a variety of mechanisms that include auto- and transphosphorylation 2Transphosphorylation refers to a phosphorylation catalyzed by another kinase. 2Transphosphorylation refers to a phosphorylation catalyzed by another kinase. events and control by regulatory domains or subunits. Mutagenesis studies have highlighted the regulatory domain of PKD/PKCμ in the negative control of its activity (3.Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 410-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 6.Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that most protein kinases share a largely conserved catalytic domain structure, their regulation by phosphorylation is very diverse (7.Johnson L.N. Lowe E.D. Noble M.E.M. Owen D.J FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 8.Johnson L.N. Noble M.E.M. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of specific threonine, serine, or tyrosine residues can occur at a number of sites, some of which are located at the N- or C-terminal ends of the enzyme (e.g. in calmodulin-dependent kinase II and PKCβII) or on other subunits (e.g. on phosphorylase kinase). A key feature for regulation is the phosphorylation of residues in the so-called kinase “activation loop” located between subdomains VII and VIII of the kinase core. Here again, this general mechanism holds for most but not for all protein kinases. Phosphorylation of residue(s) in the activation loop may be due to autophosphorylation (e.g. cAMP-dependent protein kinase, c-Src, and insulin receptor kinase) or transphosphorylation catalyzed by another protein kinase (e.g. protein kinase Bα, p70S6K, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, PKCζ). Finally, the phosphorylation of protein kinases, either by autophosphorylation or transphosphorylation, can be the cause of activation or its consequence. For example, three phosphorylation events regulate PKCβII activation, the first is catalyzed by an upstream kinase (probably 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1), which phosphorylates Thr-500 in the activation loop, thereby leading to kinase activation and autophosphorylation of two other sites in the C terminus (9.Edwards A.S. Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6461-6468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). PKD/PKCμ has been shown to be activated by pharmalogical agents such as phorbol ester and bryostatin 1 (10.Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

Van Lint J. Laudenslager J. Vandenheede J.R. Faulkner D.J. Malhotra V. Cell. 1999; 98: 59-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PKD may also serve as a molecular switch to promote cell proliferation while inhibiting apoptosis (16.Johannes F.J. Horn J. Link G. Haas E. Siemienski K. Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18.Bowden E.T. Barth M. Thomas D. Glazer R.I. Mueller S.C.

Int J Cancer. 1999; 80: 98-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKD activation was first described as a phorbol ester or diacylglycerol/phospholipid-dependent process. In vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that immunopurified PKD is markedly stimulated by either biologically active phorbol ester or diacylglycerol, in the presence of phosphatidylserine (10.Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 11.Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). More recently, attention was focussed on phosphorylation events that control the PKD activity (21.Rozengurt E. Sinnett-Smith J. Zugaza J.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These observations were based on the fact that PKD activation was maintained during cell disruption and immunoprecipitation. Additional data, including the use of PKC inhibitors and cotransfection of PKD with constitutively active mutants of PKCε and PKCη, indicated that PKD was activated by phosphorylation in vivo through a PKC-dependent signal transduction pathway (11.Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 12.Matthews S.A. Pettit G.R. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 23952-23960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Recent results have demonstrated that PKCη interacts with the PH domain of PKD, suggesting a direct link between PKCη and PKD (22.Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9224-9230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Little is known about how phosphorylation regulates PKD activity, and the phosphorylation sites that mediate its biological functions have not been identified. The group of Rozengurt (23.Iglesias T. Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27662-27667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) proposed that thein vivo activation of PKD by phorbol ester results from the phosphorylation of two activation loop serine residues, namely Ser744 and Ser748, via a novel PKC-dependent signal transduction pathway. However, no sequence studies were undertaken to unambiguously determine that these two serines were actually being phosphorylated in vivo. The C-terminal Ser916 was suggested to be autophosphorylated in PKCμ/PKD, because it was recognized by a phosphospecific peptide antibody (24.Matthews S.A. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26543-26549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser916 was also reported to be induced by phorbol ester treatment of cells in vivo. The present study identifies five phosphorylation sites in PKD by mass spectrometry, and several of these sites were individually mutated to alanine or glutamate to study their functional role. DMEM and phosphate-free DMEM were from Life Technologies. Protein A-TSK gel was from Affiland (Sart-Tilman, Belgium). Glutathione-Sepharose 4B was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Sequencing grade trypsin and chymotrypsin were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. HPLC solvents were from Lab Scan. Bisindolylmaleimide I (Gö 6850) was from Calbiochem. Shrimp alkaline phosphatase, [γ-32P]ATP, and [32P]orthophosphate were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other materials were from Sigma or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The phagemid, called pBluescript (SK)II+/PKD (pBS/PKD), containing the full-length PKD cDNA (10.Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), was used as a template to create eight single mutations (S916A, S916E, S744A, S748A, S744E, S748E, S255A, and S255E) using the QuickChange kit (Stratagene) following instructions provided by the manufacturer. The different mutations were verified by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. A kinase-dead mutant of PKD (K628N) was also generated by the same strategy. The DNA sequence encoding wild-type or mutated PKD was subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pGMEX-T3 that has been used to overexpress gluthatione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in eukaryotic cells under an EF1a promoter. The pBS/PKD phagemids were cleaved with NotI to release the cDNA for PKD, which was then inserted into the compatible ends of pGMEX-T3 to create pGMEX-T3-PKD. To overexpress untagged PKD constructs, wild-type and mutant proteins were also cloned in pcDNA3 vector as described (10.Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) To prepare the PKD catalytic domain fusion protein (GST-catPKD), a 1014-base pair fragment comprising the entire catalytic domain of PKD was generated by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into pBluescript (SK)II+. The assembled fragment was then subcloned into pGMEXT-3 between the SalI and NotI restriction sites. To prepare purified GST-PKD or GST-catPKD, 10-cm diameter dishes of human embryonic kidney 293 T cells (HEK 293T), expressing the SV40 large T antigen, were cultured, and each dish was transfected with 7 μg of pGMEX-T3-PKD plasmid DNA using the modified calcium phosphate method (25.Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 106 HEK 293T cells/dish were grown for 24 h before transfection at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The DNA was mixed with equal volumes of 0.25 m CaCl2and BES-buffered solution and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The calcium phosphate-DNA solution was added onto medium-containing plates and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C, 3% CO2. The medium was then replaced with fresh DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were used for experimental purposes 48 h later. Phorbol ester treatment was with 1 μm PDBu for 15 min. The cells were then washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and each dish was lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer A, pH 7.5 (50 mmTris, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 5 mmNaPPi, 0.2 μm microcystin, 0.27 m sucrose, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100). Lysates were briefly vortexed and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were pooled and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotating platform with 25 μl (gel bed volume)/dish of glutathione-Sepharose previously equilibrated in one bed volume of Buffer A. The suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 × g, and the beads were washed once with 10 bed volumes of Buffer A containing 0.5m NaCl and once with 10 bed volumes of Buffer B, pH 8.0 (50 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.27 msucrose, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol (v/v), and 50 mm NaCl). GST-PKD was eluted from the gel with 2× one bed volume of Buffer B containing 20 mm reduced glutathione. The combined eluates were divided into aliquots and stored at −80 °C. PKD activity was measured with syntide-2 peptide as substrate (1.Valverde A.M. Sinnet-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) under the conditions described in the legends to the figures and tables. One unit of PKD activity corresponds to the amount of enzyme catalyzing the formation of 1 nmol of product/min under the assay conditions. Immunoprecipitation of PKD from cell lysates with a polyclonal antibody and kinase assay was as described (15.Van Lint J. Ni Y. Valius M. Merlevede W. Vandenheede J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7038-7043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Purified GST-PKD (30 μg) was incubated in buffer containing 15 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm[γ-32P] MgATP (specific radioactivity of 200 cpm/pmol) for up to 60 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer (1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mmdithiotreitol, and 12 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8), and the samples were boiled for 5 min for SDS-PAGE in 7.5% acrylamide gels. To determine 32P incorporation, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. The bands corresponding to GST-PKD were counted in a Hewlett-Packard Instant Imager together with spotted dried aliquots of the diluted stock solution of [γ-32P]MgATP used in the phosphorylation experiments. Stoichiometries of 32P incorporation (mol/mol of enzyme) were calculated from the amount of protein loaded onto the gel as quantified by the ninhydrin method (see below), and the molecular masses of the GST-PKD and GST-catPKD, taken as 127,575 and 66,975 Da, respectively. HEK 293T cells were cultured and transfected as described above. The dishes were washed five times with phosphate free DMEM containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and labeled for 4 h with 3 ml/dish of phosphate-free DMEM containing 150 μCi/ml of [32P]orthophosphate. Cells were stimulated with PBDu, and the PKD-GST proteins were purified as described above. To identify autophosphorylation sites, GST-PKD (50 μg) was incubated at 30 °C, with 0.1 mm [γ-32P]MgATP (specific activity, 300–500 cpm/pmol). After 60 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 10% trichloroacetic acid (v/v) and left on ice for 1 h. Precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation (12,000 ×g for 15 min), washed once with ice-cold acetone, and resuspended in 50 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.6% (w/v) n-octylglucoside for overnight digestion at 30 °C with 1 μg of sequencing grade chymotrypsin or trypsin. Peptides were separated by reversed-phase narrowbore HPLC on a Vydac C18 column (1.0 mm × 25 cm) in an acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A). Elution was performed with the following gradient program: 5–100% solvent B (70% acetonitrile in solvent A) over 100 min at a flow rate of 40 μl/min generated by a model 140B Applied Biosystems solvent delivery system. Peptides were collected by hand, and radioactive peptides were identified by Cerenkov counting. Radioactive peptides were dried under vacuum and redissolved in 4–6 μl of 60% (v/v) methanol, 1% (v/v) acetic acid for nanospray ESI-MS/MS. To identify transphosphorylation sites, GST-PKD (50 μg) purified from32P-labeled cells, was precipitated, redissolved, and digested as described above. Peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC on a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech C2/C18 column (2.1 mm × 10 cm) connected to a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech SMART system. Column was equilibrated in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A). Elution was performed with the following gradient program: 7–70% solvent B (100% acetonitrile, 0.1%(v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) over 80 min at a flow rate of 80 μl/min. Peptides absorbing at 215 nm were collected, counted, dried, and dissolved as described above for nanospray ESI-MS/MS. Radioactive peaks were analyzed by nanospray ESI-MS/MS. Briefly, 2–3 μl of the radioactive peptides were analyzed in a LCQ (Finnigan MAT LCQ, San Jose, CA) equipped with a nano-electrospray ionization source. Spectra were taken in full MS and zoom scan mode to determine parent masses and their charge state. The source voltage was set at 0.8 kV with a scan time of 3.6 s. The collision energy was adjusted to the minimum needed for fragmentation. To identify in vivo phosphorylation sites, peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC on a C18 capillary column (0.3 mm × 25 cm, LC Packings) with an acetonitrile gradient in 0.05% (v/v) formic acid (solvent A). Elution was performed with the following gradient: 0–100% solvent B (95% acetonitrile (v/v) in 0.05% (v/v) formic acid) over 100 min at a flow rate of 5 μl/min generated by a 140B pump (Applied Biosystems) connected to a flow splitter (1/20, Accurate solvent splitter, LC Packings). Mass spectra were recorded on-line in the LCQ (Finnigan MAT LCQ, San Jose, CA) using the standard electrospray ionization source. Electrospray was performed at a voltage of 5.6 kV with a scan time of 1.2 s. Mass spectra were acquired in a mode that alternated single MS scans (m/z 500–2000) with MS2 and MS3 scans. Protein was measured by the Bradford method (26.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211536) Google Scholar) using γ-globulin as a standard or by the reaction with ninhydrin after trichloroacetic acid precipitation and complete alkaline hydrolysis (27.Allen G.

SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis in 10% or 7.5% (w/v) acrylamide was as described (28.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205406) Google Scholar). Kinetic constants were calculated by fitting data to a hyperbola by nonlinear least square regression using a computer program (Ultrafit, Biosoft, Cambridge, UK) Engineering of a N-terminal GST tag in PKD allowed rapid purification of the protein by a one-step procedure. Cell lysates were directly mixed with glutathione-Sepharose 4B, and GST-PKD preparations were eluted with reduced gluthatione. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the purified preparations of wild-type PKD (GST-PKD), PKD catalytic domain (GST-catPKD), and mutant proteins showed single 132,000- or 68,000-Da bands in agreement with the calculated masses. The purified proteins were stored in elution buffer at −80 °C with no appreciable loss of activity over several months. The catalytic domain of PKD had a 12-fold higherk cat than wild-type PKD (6 s−1 versus 0.5 s−1). The affinities for MgATP and syntide-2 were similar for the two recombinant enzymes, suggesting that the overall structure of the catalytic domain was maintained and that the GST tag had no influence on the kinetic properties of the enzyme (Table I). Likewise, addition of a N-terminal green fluorescent protein tag in PKD has previously been shown to have no influence on PDBu-induced translocation, basal catalytic activity, phorbol ester binding, and kinase activation (29.Matthews S.A. Iglesias T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Moreover, in vitro incubation of GST-PKD with PS/PDBu micelles led to a 5-fold stimulation of PKD activity (not shown). A comparable stimulation was observed with untagged PKD (10.Van Lint J.

Incubation of HEK 293T cells with PDBu caused a 3-fold increase ink cat for GST-PKD with no effect on the affinities for MgATP and syntide-2 (Table I). By contrast, PDBu treatment had no effect on the activity of GST-catPKD. Therefore, deletion of the regulatory domain of PKD leads to a constitutively active kinase, and these results suggest that the region for PKC-dependent activation is located outside the catalytic domain. These results support those obtained in experiments using partial deletions or point mutations in the regulatory domain of PKD (3.Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 410-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 6.Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Time course experiments of in vitro autophosphorylation showed that 32P incorporation into GST-PKD was maximal after 60 min and was maintained for up to 80 min (not shown). The initial rate of GST-PKD autophosphorylation was independent of enzyme concentration with an activity of 50 pmol/min/mg (not shown), indicating that autophosphorylation of GST-PKD occurs via an intramolecular event at a very slow rate. Indeed, forDictyostelium myosin light chain kinase, which has a catalytic domain possessing 40% identity with the PKD kinase domain, autophosphorylation is also intramolecular but with a 15-fold faster rate (30.Tan J.L. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13818-13824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of autophosphorylation of GST-PKD and GST-catPKD was 0.4 and 0.2 mol of phosphate incorporated per mol of enzyme, respectively, suggesting the existence of at least two autophosphorylation sites, one located in the catalytic domain and the other in the regulatory domain. The low incorporation of radioactive phosphate in vitro could reflect the fact that these sites were already largely phosphorylated in vivo (see below). Purified GST-PKD was autophosphorylated in vitro by incubation with [γ-32P]MgATP. Following trichloroacetic acid precipitation, the protein was digested with chymotrypsin, and peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC, and one major radioactive peak was observed (not shown).

In vivo this interaction results in the regulated plasma membrane recruitment of cytosolic group I PH domain-containing proteins following agonist-stimulated PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 production. Among group I PH domain-containing proteins, the Ras GTPase-activating protein GAP1IP4BP is unique in being constitutively associated with the plasma membrane. Here we show that, although the GAP1IP4BP PH domain interacts with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, it also binds, with a comparable affinity, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) (K d values of 0.5 ± 0.2 and 0.8 ± 0.5 μm, respectively). Intriguingly, whereas this binding site overlaps with that for Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, consistent with the constitutive plasma membrane association of GAP1IP4BPresulting from its PH domain-binding PtdIns(4,5)P2, we show that in vivo depletion of PtdIns(4,5)P2, but not PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, results in dissociation of GAP1IP4BP from this membrane. Thus, the Ins(1,3,4,5)P4-binding PH domain from GAP1IP4BPdefines a novel class of group I PH domains that constitutively targets the protein to the plasma membrane and may allow GAP1IP4BPto be regulated in vivo by Ins(1,3,4,5)P4rather than PtdIns(3,4,5)P3.

Cell. 1993; 73: 629-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Subsequently PH domains have been identified in more than 100 different proteins that ,despite possessing low sequence similarities (10–20%) ,have been shown, or predicted to have, very similar overall topologies (3Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Sigler P.B. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10472-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Many of these PH domain-containing proteins are involved in intracellular signaling, where the majority require membrane association for their function. Recent work has highlighted a pivotal role for PH domains in this membrane targeting (4Irvine R.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 557-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Katan M. Allen V.L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although some PH domains have been reported to bind other proteins (6Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G.

Commun. 1994; 205: 1770-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), a consensus is emerging that many PH domains are designed to bind phosphoinositides, particularly phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), and their corresponding water-soluble inositol head-groups, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4), respectively (9Bottomley M.J. Salim K. Panayotou G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 165-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For example, the PH domain of phospholipase C-δ1 (PLC-δ1) binds with high affinity and stereospecificity to both PtdIns(4,5)P2 and Ins(1,4,5)P3. The interaction of PLC-δ1 with PtdIns(4,5)P2 results in its plasma membrane association, which, since PLC-δ1 hydrolyzes PtdIns(4,5)P2to generate Ins(1,4,5)P3, is a reversible process governed by whether the PH domain is bound to PtdIns(4,5)P2 or cytosolic Ins(1,4,5)P3. Indeed, this competition has been proposed to have an important role in regulating PLC-δ1activity in vivo (reviewed in Ref. 10Katan M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). More recent studies have demonstrated that certain PH domains specifically bind 3-phosphoinositides generated following agonist stimulation of class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI 3-kinases) (11Rameh L.E.

Other proteins that bind Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 in vitro, with an affinity and isomeric specificity typical of group I PH domains, are those of the GAP1 family of Ras GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) (24Cullen P.J.

Irvine R.F. Nature. 1995; 376: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), a C-terminal Ins(1,3,4,5)P4-binding PH domain that is linked to a 26-amino acid Btk motif (PH/Btk) (25Fukuda M.

In keeping with the other group I PH domain-containing proteins, GAP1m is a cytosolic protein that undergoes rapid plasma membrane recruitment following agonist activation of PI 3-kinase (28Lockyer P.J.

Given the high sequence identity (63%) and similar Ins(1,3,4,5)P4-binding characteristics of the GAP1m and GAP1IP4BPPH/Btk domains (29Cullen P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 35-47.33Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), one would expect that GAP1IP4BP may behave in a similar manner. Surprisingly, however, a number of studies have suggested that rather than being localized within the cytosol, both endogenous (30O'Rourke F. Matthews E. Feinstein M.B. Biochem.

Gaines P. Thackeray J. Carlson J. Gaul U. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), are constitutively associated with the plasma membrane. The precise manner of this membrane association is unclear, although there is no evidence that GAP1IP4BP contains either transmembrane-spanning domains or post-translational membrane-targeting sequences (29Cullen P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 35-47.33Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined the molecular interactions required for the constitutive plasma membrane association of GAP1IP4BP. In particular, we describe experiments that highlight a unique and pivotal role for the GAP1IP4BP PH/Btk domain in this membrane association. d-Ins(1,3,4,5)P4and dipalmitoyl PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 were kind gifts from Professor Robin Irvine (Department of Pharmacology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom (UK)) and Drs. Len Stephens and Phill Hawkins (Babraham Institute, Cambridge, UK), respectively. CHO-M3 cells were a kind gift from Drs. John Challis and Andrew Tobin (Department of Pharmacology, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK). Unless otherwise stated, all other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce the following unique restriction sites in both GAP1m and GAP1IP4BP: at the start of the PH domain, anAgeI site; and at the end of the Btk motif, anAscI site. The AgeI site was introduced into GAP1IP4BP using the Transformer Kit™ (CLONTECH) and pCI-neo-GAP1IP4BP as template (primer BP-AgeI, 5′-CAAGAGTGTTGAGCAACCGGTCGTGCTTAAAGAAG-3′). TheAscI site was subsequently introduced using the Quikchange Kit™ (Stratagene) (primer BP-AscI, 5′-CCCTGCACTGGCGGCGCGCCAGCCAACATCCAG-3′; primer BP-AscIrc, 5′-CTGGATGTTGGCTGGCGCGCCGCCAGTGCAGGG-3′). Similarly, the corresponding mutations in GAP1m were sequentially introduced using the Quikchange Kit™ with pCI-neo-GAP1m being the initial template (primer M-AgeI, 5′-AGTGGTACGAGTGAACCGGTGCACCTGAAAGAAGG-3′; primer M-AgeIrc, 5′-CCTTCTTTCAGGTGCACCGGTTCACTCGTACCACT-3′, M-AscI, 5′-CCATGTACTGCAGGCGCGCCTGCAGACATCCAA-3′; and primer M-AscIrc, 5′-TTGGATGTCTGCAGGCGCGCCTGCAGTACATGG-3′). The under- lined region in each primer indicates the restriction site, and “rc” designates reverse compliment. Subcellular localization of these mutants, visualized using transient transfection and indirect immunofluorescence, was identical to wild-type. Using a double digest of AgeI and AscI, the PH/Btk motifs were swapped to give GAP1IP4BP/GAP1m-PH/Btk and GAP1m/GAP1IP4BP-PH/Btk. This was performed as described previously (32Lockyer P.J.

Primers used were as follows: K585R, 5′-GAAGGGTTCATGATCAGGAGGGCCCAAGGACGG-3′; A587F, 5′-TTCATGATCAAGAGGTTCCAAGGACGGAAGCGC-3′; N597D, 5′-TTTGGGATGAAGGATTTTAAGAAGAGATGG-3′; F598Q, 5′-TTTGGGATGAAGAATCAGAAGAAGAGATGGTTTC-3′; R601K, 5′-GATGAAGAATTTTAAGAAGAAGTGGTTTCGTTTGACCAAC-3′; R601C, 5′-GATGAAGAATTTTAAGAAGTGCTGGTTTCGTTTGACCAAC-3′; K614E, 5′-GAATTTACCTACCACGAAAGCAAAGGGGACCAG-3′. In each case, the underlined codon describes the particular mutation. For prokaryotic expression of the various GAP1IP4BPsite-directed mutants, the corresponding cDNAs were removed from the pCIneo vector by digestion with SalI andNotI. The liberated cDNAs were gel-purified and ligated into the corresponding sites within pGEX4T-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Expression and purification of GAP1IP4BPand GAP1IP4BP site-directed mutants were as described previously (35Várnai P. Balla T. J.

Lipid mixtures phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol (all in CHCl3) supplemented with either phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate (PtdIns(4)P), PtdIns(4,5)P2 (both in 90% CHCl3, 9% MeOH, 1% H2O) or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (in H2O) were dried down to form a thin film in a 0.5-ml minifuge tube (Beckmann) and then bath sonicated in 0.2 msucrose, 20 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.01% azide to yield a 10× dense lipid stock. This was diluted 10-fold in reaction buffer (0.12 m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm CaCl2 (free Ca2+ concentration of approximately 50 nm), 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmKCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing 250–500 ng of recombinant GAP1IP4BP. GAP1IP4BP-lipid complexes were allowed to form by incubation at 30 °C for 4 min prior to centrifugation (100,000 × g for 30 min). After spinning, supernatants were carefully removed and the pellets retrieved by addition of an equal volume of 60 °C SDS sample buffer and subsequent bath sonication. GAP1IP4BP present in both the supernatant and lipid vesicles were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Western blotting. Detection was performed using the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Developed films were analyzed by volume integration using ImageQuant software (version 3.3, Molecular Dynamics Inc.) in a similar manner to that described previously (31Lockyer P.J. Vanlingen S. Reynolds J.S. McNulty T.J. Irvine R.F. Parys J.B. Cullen P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). COS-7 and HeLa cells, cultured as described (32Lockyer P.J. Bottomley J.R. Reynolds J.S. Venkatewarlu K. Potter B.V.L. Dempsey C.E. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 1007-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), were plated on glass coverslips and transfected with vector DNA at 50–60% confluence by lipofection using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a ratio of 0.15 μg of DNA/μl of cationic lipid. At 48 h after transfection, cells were serum-starved for 2 h prior to being fixed and stained for GAP1IP4BP or GAP1m expression as described previously (32Lockyer P.J. Bottomley J.R. Reynolds J.S. Venkatewarlu K. Potter B.V.L. Dempsey C.E. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 1007-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence staining was visualized by a Leica TCS-NT confocal microscope equipped with a krypton/argon laser. The confocal was attached to a Leica DM RBE upright epifluorescence microscope. 48 h after transfection serum-starved cells, expressing GFP-tagged proteins, were analyzed at 37 °C in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (136 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.25 mmMgSO4, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 5 mm sodium phosphate) containing 2 mmNaHCO3 and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Fluorescence imaging was performed with either a Leica DM IRBE inverted confocal microscope controlled with TCS-NT4 software (Leica) or an UltraView™ MultiUser confocal optical scanner (EG&G Wallac). To address whether regions outside the GAP1IP4BP PH/Btk domain are necessary for plasma membrane association, we generated various GAP1IP4BP/GAP1m chimeras in which the PH/Btk domain from GAP1IP4BP was replaced with the corresponding domain from GAP1m(GAP1IP4BP/GAP1m-PH/Btk) and the PH/Btk domain from GAP1m was replaced with that from GAP1IP4BP (GAP1m/GAP1IP4BP-PH/Btk) (Fig. 1 A). Expression of these constructs in serum-starved COS-7 cells, followed by analysis of their resultant subcellular distribution, revealed that, whereas GAP1IP4BP/GAP1m-PH/Btk was cytosolic, GAP1m/GAP1IP4BP-PH/Btk was constitutively associated with the plasma membrane (Fig. 1 B). Co-expression of GAP1IP4BP/GAP1m-PH/Btk with a membrane-targeted, constitutively active class I PI 3-kinase catalytic subunit (p110 CAAX) resulted in the recruitment of this chimera specifically to the plasma membrane (Fig.1 B), an observation consistent with the GAP1mPH/Btk domain-binding 3-polyphosphoinositides (28Lockyer P.J. Wennström S. Kupzig S. Venkateswarlu K. Downward J. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 265-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, not only is GAP1IP4BP devoid of its PH/Btk domain unable to associate with the plasma membrane, but the GAP1IP4BP PH/Btk domain is sufficient, when substituting the corresponding domain from GAP1m, to direct plasma membrane targeting. Given that the PH/Btk domain of GAP1IP4BP also comprises the in vitro Ins(1,3,4,5)P4-binding site (27Bottomley J.R. Reynolds J.S. Lockyer P.J. Cullen P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the results described above raise the possibility that binding of the PH/Btk domain to phosphoinositides may be required for plasma membrane association of GAP1IP4BP. To examine this we generated a number of site-directed mutants within the GAP1IP4BP PH/Btk domain designed to inhibit in vitro Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 binding. Two groups of mutants were produced: first, those located within the positively charged potential Ins(1,3,4,5)P4-binding pocket (GAP1IP4BP-K585R, -R601C, -R601K, and -K614E) and second, mutants analogous to those found in the PH domain of Btk that are known to inhibit Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 binding (GAP1IP4BP-A587F, -N597D, and -F598Q Ref. (15Fukuda M. Kojima T. Kabayama H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30303-30306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar)). Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 binding to GAP1IP4BP-K585R, -A587F, -F598Q, and -R601C was inhibited by greater than 90% compared with wild-type GAP1IP4BP, whereas binding to the -N597D, -R601K and, significantly, -K614E mutants was inhibited by 81.4 ± 3.1%, 75.4 ± 4.1%, and only 15.2 ± 3.1%, respectively (n = 3; data not shown). In order to determine the correlation between Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 binding to GAP1IP4BP and the ability to associate with the plasma membrane, the subcellular localization of the GAP1IP4BPmutants was determined. As seen in Fig.2, GAP1IP4BP mutants with dramatically reduced abilities to bind Ins(1,3,4,5)P4(GAP1IP4BP-K585R, -A587F, -N597D, -F598Q, -R601K, and -R601C) no longer associate with the plasma membrane but were instead primarily cytosolic. This contrasted with GAP1IP4BP-K614E, which, consistent with its ability to bind Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, retained a predominant plasma membrane localization (Fig. 2). However, detailed image analysis revealed a detectable increase in cytosolic fluorescence compared with wild type (Fig.3). Thus there does appear to be a strong correlation between the ability of the PH/Btk domain to bind phosphorylated forms of inositol and an ability to associate with the plasma membrane. Such a relationship suggests a potential molecular explanation for the plasma membrane localization of GAP1IP4BP, namely that the PH/Btk domain may directly bind phosphoinositides present within the inner plasma membrane leaflet. To test whether GAP1IP4BP is capable of interacting with phosphoinositides, we generated sucrose-loaded liposomes composed of a mixture of phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylinositol (respective ratio of 28.5:28.5:28.5:14.5% (w/w); total lipid content of 70 μm), to which was added 7% (w/w) of PtdIns, PtdIns(4)P, PtdIns(4,5)P2, or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. As shown in Fig. 4, although GAP1IP4BPbinding to mixed liposomes containing PtdIns or PtdIns(4)P was barely detectable, a clear association was seen with liposomes containing PtdIns(4,5)P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Fig.4 A). Under these conditions, the association of GAP1IP4BP occurred via a binding site that appeared to overlap with the in vitro Ins(1,3,4,5)P4-binding site since addition of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 resulted in the dissociation of GAP1IP4BP. Furthermore, a GAP1IP4BP mutant with a significantly reduced ability to bind Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and the plasma membrane (GAP1IP4BP-R601C; see Fig. 2) failed to associate with the liposomes (Fig. 4 B). By sequentially lowering PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels, but maintaining the same total lipid content by increasing the mass of PtdIns, the specificity of this association was determined. Assuming an even distribution of the lipids within the aqueous environment, GAP1IP4BP bound PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 with apparent association constants of 0.8 ± 0.5 and 0.5 ± 0.2 μm, respectively (Fig. 4 C). Given that PtdIns(4,5)P2 is far more abundant than PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 even after agonist stimulation (34Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), these affinities suggest that the plasma membrane association of GAP1IP4BP may result from its PH/Btk domain predominantly binding PtdIns(4,5)P2 rather than PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. A prediction arises from the conclusions drawn from Figs. 1 and 4. If the plasma membrane association of GAP1IP4BP is a consequence of an ability to directly bind PtdIns(4,5)P2, then given that GAP1m is cytosolic in unstimulated cells, its affinity for PtdIns(4,5)P2 should be lower than that of GAP1IP4BP. In parallel experiments the association constants of GAP1m for PtdIns(4)P, PtdIns(4,5)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 were determined to be >24.5 (3.5 ± 1.5% association at this concentration), >24.5 (21.1 ± 8.3% association), and 0.4 ± 0.2 μm, respectively (Fig.5). Thus, although GAP1m and GAP1IP4BP have almost identical affinities for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, the affinity of GAP1m for PtdIns(4,5)P2 is at least 30-fold lower than that of GAP1IP4BP for PtdIns(4,5)P2. To address whether the plasma membrane association of GAP1IP4BP may result from binding to a low resting level of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, we transiently transfected COS-7 cells with a plasmid encoding a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged GAP1IP4BP construct (GFP-GAP1IP4BP). Using live cell confocal imaging we observed the plasma membrane localization of GFP-GAP1IP4BPprior to and during incubation with wortmannin at a concentration that specifically inhibits PI 3-kinase (100 nm). Under these conditions, no detectable dissociation of GFP-GAP1IP4BPfrom the plasma membrane was observed during the course of a 10-min incubation with wortmannin (data not shown). To circumvent the unlikely possibility that the dissociation rate of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3from GAP1IP4BP is slow (i.e. in the order of minutes), serum-starved COS-7 cells were microinjected with the plasmid encoding for GFP-GAP1IP4BP and cultured for 4 h in the continual presence of either LY294002 (50 μm changed every 30 min) or wortmannin (100 nm similarly changed every 30 min) (Fig. 6). Again, GFP-GAP1IP4BP remained predominantly localized to the plasma membrane. Together, these data emphasize that the plasma membrane association of GAP1IP4BP is unlikely to result from its PH/Btk domain-binding resting levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. If the plasma membrane association of GAP1IP4BP is a consequence of its PH/Btk domain-binding PtdIns(4,5)P2, then manipulation of the concentration of this lipid should result in the dissociation of GAP1IP4BP from the plasma membrane. Two methods were used to manipulate PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels. First, HeLa cells expressing GFP-GAP1IP4BP were incubated with ionomycin (1 μm) in the presence of external Ca2+ (1.2 mm). Under these conditions ionomycin induces a large increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+] i ) that activates endogenous PLC and results in a subsequent decrease in plasma membrane PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels (35Várnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.7, addition of ionomycin caused the dissociation of GFP-GAP1IP4BP from the plasma membrane and a simultaneous appearance of GFP fluorescence in the cytosol (Fig.7 A). This dissociation was rapid and paralleled control experiments using the well characterized in vivoPtdIns(4,5)P2-binding PH domain from PLC-δ1(Fig. 7 B; Refs. 35Várnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar and 36Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 343-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the role of PLC in the ionomycin-induced GAP1IP4BP dissociation, we incubated GFP-GAP1IP4BP-expressing HeLa cells with the relatively specific PLC inhibitor U73122 (37Bleasdale J.E. Thakur N.R. Gremban R.S. Bundy G.L. Fitzpatrick F.A. Smith R.J. Bunting S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 756-768PubMed Google Scholar). Before ionomycin addition, the localization of GFP-GAP1IP4BP was unaltered and upon ionomycin addition U73122-treated cells failed to show the plasma membrane dissociation observed in control cells (Fig.7 C). As a second, independent, approach, we made use of the observation that high concentrations of wortmannin (1 μm) induce a gradual fall in the levels of plasma membrane PtdIns(4,5)P2 due to an inhibition of type III PtdIns 4-kinase (38Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 39Willars G.B. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5037-5046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Incubation of GFP-GAP1IP4BP-transfected HeLa cells with 1 μm wortmannin resulted in a slow dissociation of GFP-GAP1IP4BP from the plasma membrane (Fig.8 A). Importantly, this rate of dissociation was significantly enhanced by stimulation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis via histamine-induced activation of PLC (100 μm; Fig. 8 B). In the above experiments, agonist and ionomycin stimulation of PLC induces not only hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 but also Ins(1,4,5)P3 production. This cytosolic second messenger, which triggers the well characterized release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, is the substrate for an Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase that generates the potential second messenger Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (40Batty I.R. Nahorski S.R. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Given that the high affinity PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding site overlaps with that for Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (see Fig. 4), one interpretation of the data in Figs. 7 and 8 is that GAP1IP4BP may undergo a regulated dissociation from the plasma membrane as a consequence of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 competing with PtdIns(4,5)P2 for binding to the PH/Btk domain. To test this, we transiently transfected CHO cells stably overexpressing the M3 muscarinic receptor (CHO-M3) with GFP-GAP1IP4BP and observed its subcellular localization prior to, and during, carbachol stimulation. In control cells overexpressing GFP-PLC-δ1, a clear transient dissociation of GFP-PLC-δ1 was observed, with maximal dissociation occurring at about 60 s after carbachol addition (Fig. 9 A). However, no such dissociation was detectable in cells expressing GFP-GAP1IP4BP (Fig. 9 B). Similar data were also obtained following histamine stimulation of HeLa cells stably overexpressing the B-isoform of Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase and transiently transfected with the construct encoding GFP-GAP1IP4BP. 2T. H. Millard and G. Banting, unpublished data. In this study we have examined the molecular interactions required for the constitutive plasma membrane association of the Ras GTPase-activating protein GAP1IP4BP. Initially, through the generation of GAP1IP4BP/GAP1m chimeras, we have shown that the GAP1IP4BP PH/Btk domain is the sole determinant required to direct plasma membrane association. Furthermore, by site-directed mutagenesis, we have highlighted a correlation between the ability of the GAP1IP4BP PH/Btk domain to bind phosphorylated forms of inositol, as characterized byin vitro Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 binding, and the resultant plasma membrane association of GAP1IP4BP. Such a relationship clearly suggests that the plasma membrane association of GAP1IP4BP results from the ability of its PH/Btk domain to directly bind inositol-containing lipids present in the inner leaflet. Previously, the PH/Btk domain of GAP1IP4BP has been classified, along with those from Btk, GAP1m and the ADP-ribosylation factor exchange factors GRP1, ARNO, and cytohesin-1, as a member of the group I family of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4-binding PH domains (14Rameh L.E. Arvidsson A. Carraway III, K.L. Couvillon A.D. Rathburn G. Crompton A. VanRentergham B. Czech M.P. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Wang D.S. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30497-30508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In this study, however, through the use of artificial liposomes, we have shown that, although the PH/Btk domain of GAP1IP4BP does indeed bind PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 with an affinity similar to that of the PH/Btk domain of GAP1m (0.5 ± 0.2 and 0.4 ± 0.2 μm, respectively), unlike this protein, GAP1IP4BP does not have a 30-fold lower affinity for PtdIns(4,5)P2. On the contrary, GAP1IP4BP binds PtdIns(4,5)P2 with an almost identical affinity to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (0.8 ± 0.5 μm). The PH/Btk domain of GAP1IP4BP is therefore a unique Ins(1,3,4,5)P4-binding PH domain, which, we propose, defines a novel class of group I PH domains (14Rameh L.E. Arvidsson A. Carraway III, K.L. Couvillon A.D. Rathburn G. Crompton A. VanRentergham B. Czech M.P. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Wang D.S. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30497-30508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we suggest that the group I PH domains should be subdivided into group IA, comprising those that specifically bind PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (i.e. Btk, ARNO, GRP1, cytohesin-1, and GAP1m), and group IB, which, although retaining an ability to bind Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (a characteristic distinct from group II PH domains), nevertheless bind PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(4,5)P2 with comparable affinities (i.e. GAP1IP4BP). The similar affinity of GAP1IP4BP for PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 suggests, given that plasma membrane PtdIns(4,5)P2 is more abundant than PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 even after agonist stimulation (34Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), that the constitutive plasma membrane association of GAP1IP4BP may occur as a consequence of its PH/Btk domain-binding plasma membrane PtdIns(4,5)P2. If such a mechanism were correct, then one would expect that since GAP1m is not constitutively associated with the plasma membrane it should have a lower affinity for PtdIns(4,5)P2. As stated above, this is indeed the case. Furthermore, any mechanism that induces a significant depletion of plasma membrane PtdIns(4,5)P2 should result in the dissociation of GAP1IP4BP. Experimentally, we have presented direct evidence that reducing PtdIns(4,5)P2 content within the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane does indeed result in the plasma membrane dissociation of GAP1IP4BP. Together, therefore, these data strongly suggest that, in an unstimulated cell, the plasma membrane association of GAP1IP4BP results from its PH/Btk domain binding PtdIns(4,5)P2. A major issue regarding GAP1IP4BP is whether it functions as a receptor for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 or Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. From this study, the similar affinity of GAP1IP4BP for PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 suggests that, given that the cellular levels of PtdIns(4,5)P2 exceed those of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 even after agonist stimulation (34Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar),in vivo GAP1IP4BP may not significantly bind, and hence be regulated by, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The only other potential in vivo ligand is therefore Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. Support for a role of GAP1IP4BPas an Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 receptor comes from two sources. First, in the presence of artificial liposomes, membrane-associated GAP1IP4BP is inactive as a RasGAP (24Cullen P.J. Hsuan J.J. Truong O. Letcher A.J. Jackson T.R. Dawson A.P. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1995; 376: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, but not PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, can specifically stimulate the RasGAP activity (24Cullen P.J. Hsuan J.J. Truong O. Letcher A.J. Jackson T.R. Dawson A.P. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1995; 376: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Second, GAP1IP4BP can enhance the well documented ability of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 to regulate Ca2+ homeostasis in permeabilized L1210 cells (42Cullen P.J. Irvine R.F. Dawson A.P. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 43Loomis-Husselbee J.W. Cullen P.J. Dreikhausen U.E. Irvine R.F. Dawson A.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 44Loomis-Husselbee J.W. Walker C.D. Bottomley J.R. Cullen P.J. Irvine R.F. Dawson A.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 947-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The conclusion that GAP1IP4BP constitutes a receptor for Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 rather than PtdIns(3,4,5)P3has a significant bearing on the molecular events that may follow Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 binding to GAP1IP4BP. In this study, we have presented evidence that the PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding site located within the GAP1IP4BP PH/Btk domain overlaps with the Ins(1,3,4,5)P4-binding site. For instance, PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding to this site can be blocked by competition with Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and is also significantly reduced by the introduction of the R601C mutation. Based simply on these results, it may be predicted that, following agonist-stimulated Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 production, GAP1IP4BP could dissociated from the plasma membrane as a result of cytosolic Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 competing for binding with PtdIns(4,5)P2. Such a conclusion is not supported, however, by the following experimental evidence. First, endogenous GAP1IP4BP, when associated with the plasma membrane of platelets, is capable of binding Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 with nanomolar affinity (K d of 6.3 nm) via the characterized Ins(1,3,4,5)P4-binding site (29Cullen P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 35-47.33Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 45Cullen P.J. Patel Y. Kakkar V.V. Irvine R.F. Authi K.S. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Under these conditions Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 binding does not lead to the dissociation of GAP1IP4BP from the membrane. 3J. S. Reynolds and P. J. Cullen, unpublished data. Second, in the current study, we have been unable to detect any plasma membrane dissociation of GAP1IP4BP following agonist-stimulated Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 production. Together, these data strongly argue that Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, on competing with PtdIns(4,5)P2, does not induce the plasma membrane dissociation of GAP1IP4BP. Currently, a molecular explanation for this observation is lacking; however, it is tempting to speculate that the formation of the GAP1IP4BP/Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 complex may result in it interacting with either a plasma membrane-associated protein and/or lipid. In summary, therefore, we have presented experimental evidence of the molecular interactions that occur in order for GAP1IP4BP to constitutively associate with the plasma membrane. We have highlighted the vital and unique role of the PH/Btk domain and furthermore suggested some of the events that may occur following the agonist-stimulated production of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and/or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Future experiments will need to address the downstream consequences of these interactions on GAP1IP4BP-regulated Ras signaling."

Here, we describe how two genes from Trypanosoma brucei, coding for the first two enzymes of the pentose-phosphate pathway, i.e. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconolactonase, were identified by in silicoscreening of trypanosome genome project data bases. These genes were cloned and sequenced. Analysis of the lactonase sequence revealed that it contained a C-terminal peroxisome targeting signal in agreement with its subcellular localization in the bloodstream form trypanosome (15% glycosomal and 85% cytosolic). However, the dehydrogenase sequence did not reveal any targeting signal, despite its localization inside glycosomes. The corresponding enzymes have been overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified, and their biochemical characteristics have been determined. pentose-phosphate pathway base pair(s) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase polymerase chain reaction 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase 6-phosphogluconolactonase glucose 6-phosphate peroxisome targeting signal Glycolysis and the pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP)1 are the two metabolic pathways in which glucose is catabolized providing the cell with energy (ATP) and reductive power (NADPH), respectively. Although the former process has been well characterized in various species of the pathogenic protozoa of the family Trypanosomatidae, only a few details are known about the latter one. Nevertheless, the PPP plays a crucial role in these parasites by generating NADPH, which not only serves as a hydrogen donor in biosynthetic processes but may also play an important role in the defense against the oxidative attack by the infected host. Finally, it provides also ribose 5-phosphate as nucleic acid precursor and several metabolic intermediates, such as fructose 6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (for a review, see Ref. 1Barrett M.P. Parasitol. Today. 1997; 13: 11-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). All enzyme activities involved in the PPP were clearly detected in insect stage (procyclic) forms of Trypanosoma brucei, and many of them were also detected in the bloodstream form (2Cronin C.N. Nolan D.P. Voorheis H.P. FEBS Lett. 1989; 244: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) of this parasite, which is responsible for African sleeping sickness. So far, one gene coding for 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH) (EC1.1.1.44), the third enzyme of the oxidative branch of the pathway (3Barrett M.P. Le Page R.W.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 57: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), has been cloned and characterized. The enzyme has been overexpressed and purified, its kinetics have been analyzed, and recently, its crystal structure was solved (4Barrett M.P. Phillips C. Adams M.J. Le Page R.W.F. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 5Hanau S. Rippa M. Bertelli M. Dallocchio F. Barrett M.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 592-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 6Phillips C. Dohnalek J. Gover S. Barrett M.P. Adams M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 667-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). More recently, the first enzyme of the T. brucei PPP, the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) (EC 1.1.1.49), has also been purified and characterized (7Heise N. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionation indicated that half of the total cellular activity was present in the cytosol and the other half was found associated with glycosomes, the peroxisome-like organelles of trypanosomes that have as their main characteristic the presence of glycolytic enzymes. Until recently, no sequence had been reported for the second enzyme of the PPP, 6-phosphogluconolactonase (6PGL) (EC 3.1.1.31), which hydrolyzes 6-phosphogluconolactone to 6-phosphogluconate. However, based on the homology between products of bacterial devBgenes (which are often found in the proximity of the G6PDH genes), yeast Sol proteins, and the C-terminal part of the hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (which is present in the endoplasmic reticulum of mammalian cells (8Mason P.J. Stevens D. Diez A. Knight S.W. Scopes D.A. Vulliamy T.J. Blood Cell. Mol. Dis. 1999; 25: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)), Van Schaftingen and co-workers (9Collard F. Collet J.-F. Gerin I. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) proposed that devB might code for 6PGL. Indeed, expression of the human cDNA resulted in a protein that displayed lactonase activity. Here, we report the cloning of the genes encoding the first two enzymes of the oxidative branch of the PPP from T. brucei and the expression and preliminary characterization of the recombinant proteins. The results contribute to a better understanding of the overall trypanosome metabolism and may offer perspectives for the search to new drug targets in the parasite. The T. brucei genome project data bases at the Sanger Center and the Institute for Genomic Research were screened with amino acid sequences of Escherichia coli, yeast, and human glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD_ECOLI, G6PD_YEAST, and G6PD_HUMAN (SwissProt data base), respectively) using the TblAstN program (10Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). Two short overlapping gel readings (trypA72a4.q1t, 448 bp; trypA67a9.q1t, 346 bp) were found in the Sanger Center data base (March 1999 release) and were 97.8% identical. The same approach was used for 6-phosphogluconolactonase with proteins of bacterial DevB and yeast Sol families (DEVB_ACTAC and SOL1_YEAST) as query sequences. One hit was obtained by screening the Institute for Genomic Research data base (June 1999 release; 25D11.TRM13Rev, 668 bp). Sense and antisense oligonucleotides were specified and synthesized (Life Technologies, Inc.) for each gene: G6PDH (sense), SG6, 5′-CGATCATTATCTTGGGAAGG-3′, and (antisense) ASG6, 5′-TGAAAGGATCTGGGTAAGG-3′; 6PGL, S6P, 5′-GACTCCACCGATTCCAAC-3′, and AS6P, 5′-GAAAGTCAAAACTTTGCC-3′. These primers were used to amplify by PCR a 211-bp fragment of the g6pdh gene and a 571-bp fragment of the 6pgl gene from T. brucei genomic DNA, with VentR polymerase (New England Biolabs). PCR products were cloned in the pZErO-2 vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced using the Thermo Sequenase fluorescent labeled primer cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on a 4000dNA Analysis Sequencer (LI-COR). For both genes, the inserts of a positive recombinant plasmid was purified and used to screen a λGEM11 T. brucei genomic library (11Michels P.A.M. Marchand M. Kohl L. Allert S. Wierenga R.K. Opperdoes F.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) according to standard methods (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Positive phages were amplified, and their DNAs were purified with the Wizard Lambda Preps DNA purification system (Promega). The genes were subcloned in the pZErO-2 vector and sequenced as described above. Sequence alignments were performed with the Staden package (13Staden R. Mol. Biotechnol. 1996; 5: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar), version 1999. ClustalX (14Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 24: 4876-4882Crossref Scopus (35620) Google Scholar) was used to obtain alignments and to calculate identity scores. Alignment editing was performed with BoxShade. 2K. Hofman and M. D. Baron, unpublished data. Pairwise percentages of identity between the protein sequences were calculated from an uncorrected distance matrix created in ClustalX using the “Trees” option after exclusion of all positions with gaps. Protein sequences were retrieved from SwissProt data base release 37. Secondary structure predictions were made with the program Jpred (15Cuff J.A. Clamp M.E. Siddiqui A.S. Finlay M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 892-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). The complete genes were amplified via PCR using oligonucleotides also containing restriction sites for subcloning in the expression vector. For the g6pdh gene, primers were NG6 (sense), containing aNdeI site, 5′-CATATGCAGAATTGTAGAAAGGTTG-3′, and CG6 (antisense) with a XhoI site, 5′-CTCGAGTTACAAATGATGAAGCTTC-3′; the restriction sites are underlined. The 6pgl gene was amplified using oligonucleotides N6P with a NdeI site, 5′-CATATGTCATTCAAGCCAACCATC-3′ and C6P with aBamHI site, 5′-GGATCCTCAAAACTTTGCCAAG-3′. Both PCR products were cloned in pZErO-2, sequenced, and subcloned in pET-28b (Novagen) using appropriate enzymes. The E. coliBL21(DE3)pLysS strain was then transformed with recombinant pET-28b containing either the 6pgl or the g6pdh gene. The pET28 vectors allowed purification of the recombinant proteins by immobilized metal affinity chromatography, based on the synthesis of a His-tagged fusion protein. For expression and purification of the 6PGL from T. brucei, an overnight-grown preculture was used to start a 200-ml culture in LB medium at 37 °C with 30 μg·μl−1kanamycin and 15 μg·μl−1chloramphenicol. When the A 600 reached a value of 0.6, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Promega) was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, to induce protein expression, after which growth was continued for 3 h. For expression of the G6PDH, cells were grown at 30 °C in the minimal medium M9 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 0.05% NaCl, 1 mm CaCl, 10 mm MgSO4, 2% glucose, 30 μg·μl−1 kanamycin and 15 μg·μl−1 chloramphenicol. 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added at an A 600 of 0.6, and growth was continued overnight. Cells were collected by centrifugation (5000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C) and resuspended in 10 ml of cell lysis buffer containing 100 mm triethanolamine-HCl (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine-HCl (Pierce), 2 mm imidazole, and a protease-inhibitor set (Roche). Cells were lysed by two passages through a SLM-Aminco French pressure cell (SLM Instruments Inc.) at 13,000 p.s.i. Nucleic acids were removed by treatment with 250 units of Benzonase (Merck) for 30 min at room temperature and protamine sulfate (0.5 mg·ml−1) followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000 × g and 4 °C. Both G6PDH and 6PGL proteins were further purified from the soluble cell fraction. The supernatant containing 6PGL was directly applied on Talon resin (CLONTECH) for immobilized metal affinity chromatography purification, whereas G6PDH was first further enriched by precipitation with 50% ammonium sulfate followed by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer and loaded on the Talon resin. Subsequent purification steps were performed as recommended by the resin manufacturer, with lysis buffer containing 10% glycerol and 10 mm imidazole and at room temperature. Elution of the His6-tagged proteins was obtained with lysis buffer plus 120 mm imidazole. Purity of G6PDH and 6PGLase was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Proteins were stored at 4 °C for several weeks in elution buffer, but specific activities were measured after dialysis of the enzymes (3 h at 4 °C in 100 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine-HCl, and the protease inhibitor set). Enzymatic activities were measured at 340 nm and 25 °C in a 1-ml reaction mixture. G6PDH assays were performed as described (7Heise N. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Determination of the pH optimum of the enzymes was carried out in acetate-sodium barbital buffers. The K m of T. brucei G6PDH for glucose 6-phosphate (G-6-P) was determined by varying its concentration between 5 μm and 5 mm, whereas the K m for NADP+was measured with concentrations varying between 0.01 and 0.5 mg·ml−1. 6PGL activity was measured according to Ref. 9Collard F. Collet J.-F. Gerin I. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, but with several modifications. The concentrations of G-6-P and NADP+ were increased 3-fold (until concentrations of 0.15 mm G-6-P and 0.6 mm NADP+ were reached) to synthesize a sufficient amount of substrate for 6PGL (6-phosphogluconolactone) in order to attain a linear relationship between enzyme concentration and reaction rate also at higher protein levels in the assay. Moreover, the reaction buffer was 100 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.4, instead of 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.1. Linking enzymes were purchased from Roche (yeast G6PDH) and Sigma (yeast 6PGDH), and used at 1.75 and 0.5 units per assay, respectively. One activity unit is defined as the amount that hydrolyzes 1 μmol of substrate (G-6-P or 6-phosphogluconolactone) per min under these conditions. Homogenates were obtained by grinding the washed parasite pellets with silicon-carbide abrasive grain (mesh 300) in STE buffer, and a cytosolic extract devoid of unbroken cells, nuclei, and debris (postnuclear fraction) was prepared by centrifugation at 1500 ×g for 10 min. For fractionation using isopycnic centrifugation, the postnuclear fractions were layered on top of linear sucrose gradients ranging from 1.05 to 1.30 g·cm−3 and centrifuged for 120 min at 200,000 × g in a Beckman VTi 50 rotor. In all, 13 fractions of 3 ml each were collected as described in Ref. 16Steiger R.F. Opperdoes F.R. Bontemps J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 105: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar. Initial attempts to identify a g6pdh gene in the T. brucei genome by PCR amplification with degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to conserved regions of eukaryotic and prokaryotic G6PDH sequences were unsuccessful. Thus, we chose to use anin silico gene identification approach through the T. brucei genome sequencing project. Screening of data bases using homologous sequences from human, yeast, and bacterial G6PDH or 6PGL proteins as query sequences allowed us to identify gel readings obtained from random sheared T. brucei libraries. Two plausible trypanosome G6PDH gene fragments were detected in the Sanger Center data base. However, searching for homologs of 6PGL in this data base did not give any significant hit, whereas positive matches with a seemingly significant score were obtained by analyzing the data available from the Institute for Genomic Research. To ascertain those identifications, each retrieved sequence was used to screen back general protein data bases using BlAstX. This was especially essential for the 6PGL, because the TblAstN identities were only based on very short peptidic fragments (data not shown). This procedure confirmed the homology also for 6PGL, because the trypanosome fragment coded for a product that recognized in GenBankTM both the DevB protein homolog of Synechocystis PCC6803 and the Sol1 protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SOL1_YEAST), with 36 and 30% identity, respectively; but now, those identity percentages were related to the predicted amino acid sequence of the entire fragment (25D11.TRM13Rev, 668 bp). For the g6pdh gene, although the two shared DNA fragments that were retrieved were larger than 300 bp (trypA72a4.q1t, 448 bp; trypA67a9.q1t, 346 bp), only a smaller fragment (211 bp) was chosen for PCR amplification, in order to prevent mismatches due to possible errors that may be present at the ends of the preliminary sequences retrieved from the data base. A similar choice (571 bp) was made for amplification of a fragment of the putative 6pgl gene (25D11.TRM13Rev). The PCR products were subsequently used to screen a genomic library by hybridization and to identify the corresponding recombinant phages. After subcloning and sequencing of phage DNA fragments, open reading frames possibly coding for either G6PDH or 6PGL were revealed. The putative g6pdh gene is present on T. bruceichromosome I, as its sequence was obtained through the current sequencing project of this chromosome by the Sanger Center. No chromosomal localization could be assigned as yet to the putative 6PGL open reading frame because it was obtained by an overall genome sequencing approach at the Institute for Genomic Research. For each gene, two independent phages were analyzed by restriction with various endonucleases and mapping with the PCR fragment as hybridization probe, subcloning and sequencing. No difference was found between independent phages. The G6PDH open reading frame contains two potential start codons, 111 nucleotides apart. To get further information about the most plausible start codon, the 5′ end of the mRNA was determined by a reverse transcription-PCR experiment. This was performed by using total RNA purified from procyclic and bloodstream form trypanosomes: as antisense primer, an oligonucleotide corresponding to residues 25–30 in Fig.1, and as sense primer, an oligonucleotide with the sequence of the mini-exon, the spliced leader sequence present at the 5′ end of all trypanosomatid mRNAs (17Laird P.W. Trends Genet. 1989; 5: 204-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar,18Allert S. Ernest I. Poliszczak A. Opperdoes F.R. Michels P.A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The result (not shown) suggests that the most probable start codon is the second one, giving the shorter protein of 520 amino acids, because the first potential codon, which was only 86 nucleotides downstream of the mini-exon sequence, would result in an unusually short 5′ untranslated region. The polypeptide has a predicted molecular mass, pI, and net charge of 58,990 Da, 7.95, and +1, respectively. The second ATG codon has also been considered as the start codon of the G6PDH when preparing the construct for the expression of the recombinant protein (see below). T. brucei 6PGL is a 266-residue protein with a calculated molecular mass of 28,645 Da and a calculated pI of 6.58. Its net charge is –4. When these two trypanosome PPP proteins were compared with their homologs from other organisms, high identity scores were obtained (Table I), especially for G6PDH. TheT. brucei 6PGL is also homologous to glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase (EC 3.5.99.6) from bacteria (21.5% identical with NAGB_ECOLI) and human. The relatedness between these two classes of enzymes was recently noticed (9Collard F. Collet J.-F. Gerin I. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Moreover, T. bruceilactonase is 24.6% identical to the N-terminal extension of the unusual 107-kDa Plasmodium falciparum G6PDH (19O'Brien E. Kurdi-Haidar B. Wanachiwanawin W. Carvajal J.L.

Open table in a new tab Both the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (7Heise N. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and the lactonase displayed a dual distribution inT. brucei bloodstream forms. In a subcellular fractionation of a cellular extract by sucrose-gradient centrifugation, the majority of their activities behaved as a soluble enzyme and remained at the top of the gradient (cf. the cytosolic marker enzyme alanine aminotransferase). However, some 10% of the total activity of the lactonase and almost 40% of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were associated with particulate material that banded at the same density in sucrose (1.23 g·cm−1), as did the glycosomal marker enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase (Fig.2). Analysis of the primary structure revealed that the T. brucei G6PDH contains the NADP+-binding domain75GASGDLARNK84, where underlined residues represent strictly conserved amino acids (20Hankoglu I. Gutfinger T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase signature (209DHYLGKE215) (see Fig. 1). Also conserved are the residues Asp-209, His-210, and His-272, which by analysis of the Leuconostoc mesenteroides G6PDH were shown to be involved in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme (21Cosgrove M.S. Naylor C. Paludan S. Adams M.J. Levy H.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2759-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We used the Jpred program to predict the secondary structure of trypanosome G6PDH (Fig. 1). L. mesenteroides and human G6PDH, for which the crystal structures have been determined (1DPG.PDB (21Cosgrove M.S. Naylor C. Paludan S. Adams M.J. Levy H.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2759-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and 1QKI.PDB (22Au S.W.N. Gover S. Lam V.M.S. Adams M.J. Structure. 2000; 8: 293-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) respectively), served as controls. Jpred was able to predict correctly 78% of the secondary structure; errors made were the fusion of three α-helices (helices 10, 11, and 13) and the absence of one β-sheet (sheet O) and of four α-helices (helices 14, 15, 16, and 17). α-Helix 7 was wrongly assigned by the program, positioning the 209DH210 residues in a short α-helix. Note that the topology of human dehydrogenase is very similar to that of L. mesenteroides (22Au S.W.N. Gover S. Lam V.M.S. Adams M.J. Structure. 2000; 8: 293-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). No motif corresponding to an established peroxisome targeting signal (PTS) of type 1 or 2 was detected in the T. brucei G6PDH sequence, although previous studies located part of the activity of the enzyme in the glycosome. In contrast, the trypanosome 6PGL contains a PTS-1 variant, the C-terminal tripeptide264AKF266. Alignment of the 6PGL amino acid sequences of T. brucei and several other organisms (Fig. 3) revealed conservation of the amino acids proposed to be involved in substrate binding (Asp-75, His-165, and Lys-223) and those considered as a lactonase signature (Arg-77, Phe-153, and Arg-200) (9Collard F. Collet J.-F. Gerin I. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). By comparison, the N-terminal extension of the unusual P. falciparum G6PDH only contains Asp and His residues in the proposed substrate-binding motif and the first Arg residue in the lactonase signature. The function of this N-terminal extension has not been yet elucidated (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). One insertion was found in the sequence of the T. bruceienzyme (143GEAGP147). Interestingly, this sequence contains Gly and Pro residues, which could allow the formation of a turn in the parasite protein. However, no stretch of positively charged amino acids was found to be associated with this insertion, a characteristic feature of several glycosomal enzymes (23Misset O. Bos O.J.M. Opperdoes F.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 24Wierenga R.K. Swinkels B. Michels P.A.M. Osinga K. Misset O. Van Beeumen J. Gibson W.C. Postma J.P.M. Borst P. Opperdoes F.R. Hol W.G.J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the trypanosome G6PDH, no unique insertion was found. For 6PGL, secondary structure prediction suggested that the trypanosomal enzyme could contain 10 β-sheets and 7 α-helices (Fig.3). Based on the available structure of E. coliglucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase (1HOT.PDB) (25Oliva G. Fontes M.R.M. Garratt R.C. Altamirano M.M. Calcagno M.L. Horjales E. Structure. 1995; 3: 1323-1332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), Jpred found 65.2% of these structural elements. However, four helices were not predicted by the program (helices 5, 7, 8, and 11), and two were found as β-sheets (sheets 7 and 11). Two β-sheets were not predicted (sheets D and C′). Finally, downstream β-sheet E, Jpred found a short sheet (2 residues, HI) that does not exist in the E. colideaminase. As could be inferred from this comparison (see Fig. 3),in silico prediction seems to provide a plausible model of the lactonase structure. Both enzymes were expressed in E. coli cells as recombinant proteins and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. His-tagged G6PDH could be purified 183-fold to homogeneity (TableII), but its overexpression required specific growth conditions (see under “Materials and Methods”), whereas 6PGL was expressed under standard conditions, to much higher levels than G6PDH, and required only a 4.1-fold purification (Fig. 4 and Table II). This suggests that even at high levels, soluble trypanosome 6PGL is not toxic to the bacterial host.

C/EBPδ is involved in regulating G0 growth arrest and apoptosis of mouse mammary epithelial cells. This study shows that activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), but not activation of Stat1 or Stat5, occurs concurrently with G0growth arrest of HC11 mouse mammary epithelial cells, but not NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Promoter analysis demonstrates that the C/EBPδ promoter fragment involved in transcriptional activation during G0growth arrest contains a Stat3 binding site and that mutation of this site eliminates the G0 growth arrest inducibility of the C/EBPδ promoter. Overexpression of Stat3 increases C/EBPδ promoter activity during G0 growth arrest of HC11 cells, whereas dominant negative Stat3 decreases C/EBPδ promoter activity under the same conditions. Neither Stat3 overexpression nor dominant negative Stat3 expression influences C/EBPδ promoter activity in growing HC11 cells or G0 growth-arrested NIH3T3 cells, demonstrating that the effect is specific to G0 growth arrest of mammary epithelial cells. Band shift assays and antibody interference assays demonstrate specific binding of Stat3 to the acute phase response element in the C/EBPδ promoter in G0 growth-arrested HC11 cell extracts and 24 h involuting mouse mammary gland extracts.

The signaling pathways involved in the induction of G0 growth arrest and apoptosis during normal tissue homeostasis are poorly understood. Because disruption of the signaling pathways involved in regulating these major cell fate-determining pathways is a feature of many types of neoplasia, elucidating these pathways is of critical importance to our understanding of not only normal tissue homeostasis but also the development of different types of cancer. Recently, our laboratory demonstrated a role for CCAAT enhancer-binding protein δ (C/EBPδ)1 in the induction of G0 growth arrest and apoptosis of mouse mammary epithelial cells (1O'Rourke J. Yuan R.

C/EBPs have been implicated in the control of growth and differentiation in a variety of tissue and cell types (4Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L.

The six C/EBP family members (α, β, δ, γ, ε, and the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)) form homo- or heterodimers with C/EBPs and other leucine zipper proteins and bind to DNA to activate or repress transcription (10Hurst H.C.

C/EBPδ mRNA and protein levels are markedly induced in cultured mouse mammary epithelial cells during G0 growth arrest and apoptosis initiated by serum and growth factor withdrawal (1O'Rourke J. Yuan R. DeWille J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6291-6296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The marked increase in C/EBPδ in quiescent mammary epithelial cells is due to increased gene transcription (12O'Rourke J.P. Hutt J.A. DeWille J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 696-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). C/EBPδ antisense cell lines continue to proliferate in low serum media and have a lower rate of apoptosis compared with controls. These cells exhibit elevated levels of cyclin D1 and phosphorylated Rb and reduced levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27. In contrast, constitutive overexpression of C/EBPδ increases the rate of cell cycle exit and apoptosis in response to serum and growth factor withdrawal, with a concomitant increase in p27 protein accumulation, cyclin D1 down-regulation, and phosphorylated Rb disappearance. Thesein vitro results linking C/EBPδ with mammary epithelial cell G0 growth arrest and apoptosis are consistent within vivo studies that demonstrate that C/EBPδ mRNA is markedly induced within the first 12–24 h of mouse mammary gland involution (3Gigliotti A.P. DeWille J.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). During this time, the mammary epithelial cell compartment undergoes massive apoptosis (13Walker N.I. Bennett R.E. Kerr J.F. Am. J. Anat. 1989; 185: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The signaling pathways that regulate transcription of C/EBPδ have been studied in fibroblasts and hepatoma cells. Basal expression of C/EBPδ in rat fibroblasts is mediated by multiple cis elements, including an Sp1 site (14Yamada T. Tobita K. Osada S. Nishihara T. Imagawa M. J. Biochem.(Tokyo). 1997; 121: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). C/EBPδ has been most extensively studied during the acute phase response. C/EBPδ is markedly induced in many tissues during the acute phase response and activates transcription of several acute phase genes in hepatocytes in response to interleukin 6 (15Alam T. An M.R. Papaconstantinou J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5021-5024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ray A. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell.

In hepatoma cells, IL6-inducible C/EBPδ gene expression is mediated, at least in part, by activated Stat3 (14Yamada T. Tobita K. Osada S. Nishihara T. Imagawa M. J. Biochem.(Tokyo). 1997; 121: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17Cantwell C.A. Sterneck E. Johnson P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2108-2117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) proteins are latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that, upon activation form homo- or heterodimers, translocate to the nucleus and bind consensus DNA sequences to activate transcription. Stat3 activation occurs by phosphorylation of tyrosine 705 by non-receptor or receptor tyrosine kinases (18Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell J.E.J. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). Stat3, initially described as the acute phase response factor, binds to a consensus DNA sequence known as the acute phase response element (APRE) (19Wegenka U.M. Buschmann J. Lutticken C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 20Seidel H.M. Milocco L.H. Lamb P. Darnell J.E.J. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3041-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Binding of activated Stat3 homodimers to a modified APRE and Sp1 to two flanking Sp1 sites confers IL6 inducibility to the mouse C/EBPδ promoter (17Cantwell C.A. Sterneck E. Johnson P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2108-2117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The overall goal of this study is to investigate the signal transduction pathway involved in regulating C/EBPδ transcription in G0 growth-arrested mouse mammary epithelial cells. Interestingly, Stat3 activation, like C/EBPδ transcription, occurs in the involuting mouse mammary gland within 12 h of the onset of involution (21Li M. Liu X. Robinson G. Bar-Peled U. Wagner K.U. Young W.S. Hennighausen L. Furth P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3425-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 22Philp J.A. Burdon T.G. Watson C.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The in vitro data demonstrating a role for C/EBPδ in mammary epithelial cell G0 growth arrest and apoptosis, and the previously reported transcriptional activation of C/EBPδ by Stat3 in hepatocytes, led us to investigate the interaction of Stat3 with the mouse C/EBPδ promoter in growth-arrested mammary epithelial cells. The work described herein shows that Stat3 activation contributes to C/EBPδ mRNA up-regulation during G0 growth arrest of cultured mouse mammary epithelial cells. C/EBPδ is markedly induced during G0 growth arrest of mammary epithelial cells; however, C/EBPδ is elevated during growth and remains unchanged during G0 growth arrest of NIH 3T3 cells. Stat3, but not Stat1 or Stat5, is phosphorylated (Tyr-705) early in the induction of G0 growth arrest in mammary epithelial cells, but not NIH 3T3 cells, consistent with an upstream location in the C/EBPδ signal transduction pathway in mammary epithelial cells. Cotransfection experiments using luciferase reporter gene constructs and Stat3 and dominant negative Stat3 expression vectors show that Stat3 activates the C/EBPδ promoter in G0 growth-arrested mammary epithelial cells. Neither Stat3 nor dominant negative Stat3 has any effect on growing mammary epithelial cells or G0growth-arrested NIH 3T3 cells, demonstrating that the interaction is specific for cell type and growth status. Band shift and antibody interference assays demonstrate specific binding of Stat3 to the APRE in the C/EBPδ promoter during G0 growth arrest in vitro and during involution in vivo. In summary, these data demonstrate the specific transcriptional up-regulation of C/EBPδ in G0 growth-arrested mammary epithelial cells by activated Stat3. A 2.1-kb fragment of the mouse C/EBPδ promoter (a generous gift of Dr. Steven McKnight, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) in the pGL2 basic luciferase vector (12O'Rourke J.P. Hutt J.A. DeWille J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 696-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was digested with SstI andSpeI, NsiI, and StuI to create deletion constructs with end points at –322, –1181, and –1673 bp, respectively, relative to the transcription start site. Fragments with end points at –127 and –81 bp were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the 2.1-kb promoter-luciferase construct (template), the GL2 primer (Promega), and the following C/EBPδ promoter-specific primers: 5′-GAGCTCGGGCAGAGGGCGGGTCGTTCCCAGCAGCACCCCAG-3′ (–127) and 5′-GAGCTCTCCGGTCTCCGACCCACTGGGGCCGGGG-3′ (–81). These fragments were digested with HindIII and SstI and ligated into the pGL2 basic luciferase vector to give promoter constructs with end points at –127 and –81 bp upstream of the transcription start site. A 127-bp C/EBPδ promoter fragment with a mutated Stat3 binding site (APRE mutant, TTCCCAGCA → TTCCCAGGG) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the 127-bp C/EBPδ promoter fragment (template), the GL2 primer (Promega), and the following mutagenic primer: 5′-GAGCTCGAGGGGCAGAGGGCGGGTCGTTCCCAGGGGCACCCCAGTCCCTCCCCG-3′. The resultant polymerase chain reaction product was ligated into a TA cloning vector (Invitrogen), which was then digested withSstI and HindIII. The fragment was then ligated into the pGL2 basic luciferase vector. The sequences of all constructs were verified by thermal cycler mediated sequencing (DNA Sequencing Facility, The Ohio State University Neurobiotechnology Center). Stat3 and dominant negative Stat3 (truncated after lysine 685) constructs were a generous gift from Dr. Alice Mui (DNAX Research Institute) (23O'Farrell A.M. Liu Y. Moore K.W. Mui A.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1006-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). These fragments were excised from pMX-neo and pBabe-X-puro constructs withEcoRI and NotI, gel-purified, and ligated into pcDNA3. A second dominant negative Stat3 construct (pcDNA3.1) with a mutated tyrosine 705 (Y705F) was provided as a generous gift from Dr. R. Iyengar (24Ram P.T. Horvath C.M. Iyengar R. Science. 2000; 287: 142-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). HC11 cells (a generous gift of Dr. Wolfgang Doppler, Universitat Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria), a non-transformed line of mouse mammary epithelial cells, were cultured in complete growth medium containing RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, and 10 μg/ml bovine insulin (Life Technologies, Inc.). NIH 3T3 cells (ATCC CRL 1658) were cultured in complete growth medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4.5 g/ml glucose) supplemented with 10% calf serum and 10 μg/ml bovine insulin. Comma D cells (a generous gift of Dr. Daniel Medina, Baylor College of Medicine), another non-transformed line of mouse mammary epithelial cells, were cultured in complete growth medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4.5 g/ml glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, and 10 μg/ml bovine insulin. The transformed mouse mammary epithelial cell line, Mm5MT (ATCC CRL 1637), was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4.5 g/ml glucose) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. G0 growth arrest experiments were carried out by switching near-confluent cultures from complete growth medium to growth arrest medium (RPMI medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% fetal bovine serum or calf serum, respectively). Cells were harvested at the designated times for RNA or protein analysis. For the C/EBPδ promoter fragment and APRE mutant promoter fragment luciferase assays, transient transfections were performed with 30 or 80% confluent cells in 24-well tissue culture plates. Transfectam reagent (Promega) was used as a vehicle to cotransfect 1 μg of each C/EBPδ promoter-deletion construct with 0.25 ng of the cytomegalovirus-renilla luciferase plasmid (internal control for transfection efficiency), as suggested by the manufacturer. Two hours after transfection, the medium was changed to complete medium (30% confluent) or growth arrest medium (80% confluent). Cells were harvested and assayed for firefly and renilla luciferase activities 48 h later using the Dual Luciferase Assay kit (Promega). Luminescence was measured by liquid scintillation counting or using a Hewlett-Packard Lumicount microplate luminometer. C/EBPδ promoter activities in growing and G0growth-arrested cells were normalized to renilla luciferase activity, and the fold induction in promoter activity during growth arrest was calculated. Results shown are the average-fold increase from 2–4 independent experiments with 3–6 replicates per fragment per experiment. A Taylor series expansion was used to estimate the standard errors of the ratios, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated (25Casella G. Berger R. Statistical Inference. Wadsworth and Brooks/Cole, Pacific Grove, CA1990: 328-331Google Scholar). For the Stat3 and dominant negative Stat3 co-transfection experiments, 80% confluent cells in 24-well plates were transfected with 0.4 μg of the 2.1-kb C/EBPδ promoter-firefly luciferase plasmid, 4 ng of cytomegalovirus-renilla luciferase plasmid, and 0.15 μg of expression constructs for either Stat3, dominant negative Stat3, or pcDNA3 control vector, as described above. Two hours after transfection, medium was changed to growth arrest medium. After 48 h, cells were harvested, and luciferase activities were assayed. C/EBPδ promoter activities were normalized to renilla luciferase activities, and the results for the different expression constructs were compared. Results represent the average of three independent experiments with 3–6 replicates per construct per experiment. Results were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, and treatment effects were compared with controls using Dunnett's test. Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using RNAzol B (Tel-Test). Northern blots were carried out using standard procedures (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Blots were probed with the following random primer labeled ([α-32P]dCTP) cDNAs: C/EBPδ (a generous gift of Dr. Steven McKnight, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center), gas1 (a generous gift of Dr. Claudio Schneider, Cosorzio Interuniversitario Biotecnologie), TRPM2, and histone 2B (Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD). Cyclophilin receptor protein partial cDNA was used as a constitutive probe. Fold induction was calculated from densitometric measurements taken using an AlphaImager 2000 (Alpha Innotech). Figures depicting multiple mRNAs (Figs. 1, 4 A, 5 A, and 9 B) were either coprobed or stripped and sequentially reprobed. Results are representative of 2–4 experiments.Figure 4Time course of C/EBP δ mRNA induction closely parallels Stat3 phosphorylation in near-confluent HC11s subjected to G0 growth arrest conditions. 80% confluent HC11 cells were switched to growth arrest (GA) medium, and RNA and whole cell proteins were harvested at the indicated time points.

B, Western blot showing phosphorylation of Stat3 during growth arrest induction and disappearance after reinitiation of the cell cycle. Stat3 activation and C/EBPδ mRNA and C/EBPδ protein induction occurred concurrently. Note that overall amount of Stat3 remained unchanged. Loss of Rb phosphorylation and up-regulation of p130 indicated that growth arrest had occurred. Up-regulation of gp130, the signaling component of the IL6 type cytokine receptors, occurred by 12 h GA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5Stat3 phosphorylation and C/EBP δ mRNA induction occur concurrently during G0 growth arrest of other mammary epithelial cell lines in vitro.

Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 30 s at 14,000 × g to pellet cells. The supernatant was removed, and cells were suspended in whole cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1%SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 2 mm EDTA). Protease, kinase and phosphatase activities were inhibited by the addition of Complete tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO3, 1 mmNa2MoO4, and 10 nm okadaic acid to the protein isolation solution. Nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extracts were prepared as described for the band shift assays (see below). Proteins were quantified using the BCA microprotein assay kit (Pierce). Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting. Evenness of loading was verified by examination of gels stained with Coomassie Blue. Western blots were probed with primary antibodies to Stat3, phospho-Stat3 (Tyr-705), Stat1, phospho-Stat1 (Tyr-701) (New England BioLabs), Stat5 (Transduction Laboratories), phospho-Stat5 (Tyr-694) (New England BioLabs), Rb, phospho-Rb (New England BioLabs), glycoprotein 130 (Upstate Biotechnology), C/EBPδ, and p130 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (New England BioLabs) were used to detect primary antibodies, and the signal was developed using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fold induction was calculated from densitometric measurements taken using an AlphaImager 2000 (Alpha Innotech). Figures depicting multiple proteins (Figs. 3, 4 B,5 B, and 9 A) were either stripped and sequentially reprobed or were prepared by running multiple gels using the same lysates. Results are representative of experiments performed three or four times. Nuclear extracts for Stat3 band shift assays were harvested from logarithmically growing and from confluent, 48 h growth-arrested HC11 cells or from 14 day lactating and 24 h involuting mouse mammary gland (C57BL/6 mice). Tissue culture cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into a microcentrifuge tube. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 s, and the supernatant was removed. Cells were suspended in hypotonic buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 8.0, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmNa4P2O7, 0.125 μmokadaic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 EDTA-free Complete (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) mini-tablet per 10 ml), gently mixed, and allowed to swell for 5 min on ice. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 s, the supernatant was removed, and the nuclei were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Nuclei were resuspended in high salt buffer (420 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmNa4P2O7, 0.125 μmokadaic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 EDTA-free Complete (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) mini-tablet per 10 ml) and mixed gently at 4 °C for 30 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 ×g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −70 °C. Lactating and involuting glands were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground to a coarse powder with a mortar and pestle. The powder was suspended in the hypotonic buffer described above and subsequently treated identically to the tissue culture cells to obtain nuclear extracts. Oligonucleotides (Oligos Etc.) were annealed by boiling followed by cooling, and end-labeled by a fill-in reaction using Klenow polymerase and [α-32P]dCTP. Labeled fragments were separated from residual [α-32P]dCTP using Quick Spin columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The upper strand C/EBPδ promoter APRE oligonucleotide sequence used was 5′-TGGAGTTCCCAGCAG-3′. The upper strand mutant C/EBPδ promoter oligonucleotide sequence used was 5′-TGGAGTTCCCAGGGG-3′. Binding reactions were carried out by mixing 10 μg of nuclear extract with 4 μl of 5× binding buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 200 mm KCl, 0.4 mm EDTA, 20 mmMgCl2, 40% glycerol, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% bromphenol blue) in a total volume of 18 μl and incubating at 4 °C for 1 h. Approximately 90,000 cpm (2 μl of ∼ 0.5 ng/μl) of [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probe were added per reaction and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction mixtures were loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel (0.75 mm thick) and separated for 3 h at 200 volts in 0.5× TBE. The gel was transferred to 3MM paper, dried for 30 min under vacuum, and exposed to autoradiograph film or a phosphorimager screen (Molecular Dynamics). For antibody interference assays, 3.0 μl of antibodies to phospho-Stat3, phospho-Stat1 (New England Biolabs), or normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were incubated with the protein and binding buffer for 1 h at 4 °C in a total volume of 18 μl. For competition assays, consensus (5′-TTCTGGGAATT-3′) or mutant (5′-TTCTGGGCCGT-3′) Stat3 oligonucleotides (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were incubated with the protein and binding buffer in a total volume of 18 μl. After addition of probe, subsequent steps were identical to those for the band shift assays. C/EBPδ expression increased markedly during G0 growth arrest of HC11 cells, as compared with growing cells (Fig. 1) (1O'Rourke J. Yuan R. DeWille J. J. Biol.

In NIH 3T3 cells, C/EBPδ expression was detectable in growing cells and remained unchanged during G0 growth arrest. The marked decrease in histone 2b levels indicated that growth arrest was achieved in both cell types. These data suggest a unique mechanism of regulation of C/EBPδ mRNA induction during G0 growth arrest of mammary epithelial cells.

To understand the biological role of RXRα in the liver, we have generated hepatocyte-specific RXRα knockout mice using a cre/loxP recombination system (29Wan Y.-J.Y. An D. Cai Y. Repa J.J. Chen H.-P.

In this study, we further characterized the impact of RXRα in PPARα-mediated pathways. A line of mice in which the RXRα gene is conditionally mutated by introduction of loxP sites into introns flanking exon 4 of the RXRα gene was provided by Dr. K. Chien (University of California, San Diego) (30Chen J. Kubalak S.W. Chien K.R. Development. 1998; 125: 1943-1949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This modified “floxed” allele is fully functional, in those animals which are homozygous for this allele are normal and viable. Moreover, this mutated allele was used to specifically ablate RXRα function in the cardiomyocyte lineage (30Chen J. Kubalak S.W. Chien K.R. Development. 1998; 125: 1943-1949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To abolish RXRα function in the hepatocytes, the albumin promoter/enhancer was employed to express cre recombinase. Dr. M. A. Magnuson (Vanderbilt Medical Center) provided this albumin-cre transgenic line, which provides liver-specific expression. Heptocyte-specific RXRα knockout was established by crossing albumin-cre transgene with the RXRα flox/flox background (29Wan Y.-J.Y. An D. Cai Y. Repa J.J. Chen H.-P. Flores M. Postic C.

Pelleted mouse chow, which was composed of 21.4% protein, 55% carbohydrates, 4% fat, 6.7% ash, 4% fiber, and less than 10% moisture, was commercially prepared containing either 0.0% (control) or 0.1% (w/w) Wy14,643 (Bioserv, Frenchtown, NJ). For all the experiments 10–16-week-old male mice were used. Mice were fed either control or Wy14,643 diet ad libitum for 10 days. For the starvation experiment, mouse chow was removed from mice for 48 h. Animals were housed in groups of two or three in plastic microisolator cages at 25 °C with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. At the end of the treatment, animals were weighed and anesthetized with pentobarbital (60 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). Blood samples were obtained by intracardiac puncture. Blood triglycerides and cholesterol levels were determined by automated analysis. The liver was removed immediately, weighed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and processed for RNA extraction. Part of liver was fixed by formalin and 1.5% glutaraldehyde for light and electron microscopy analysis, respectively. Molecular aspects of hepatocyte-specific RXRα mutation were evaluated by Northern blotting analysis of RNA levels in the liver for the expression of PPARα target genes.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 5321-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) (purchased from American Type Culture Collection). For Northern analysis, hepatocyte and liver total RNA was extracted by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method (34Chomczynski P. Sauhi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Twenty μg of total RNA per lane was resolved by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and then transferred to nylon membranes by capillary blotting. cDNA fragments were labeled by random priming and hybridized to membranes in 7% (w/v) SDS, 0.5m sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 68 °C overnight. The membranes were washed twice in 1% SDS, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mmEDTA at 68 °C for 15 min each and autoradiographed using intensifying screens. Four animals from each group were studied for each gene. The amount of mRNA expressed was quantitated by densitometry and then normalized with the level of 18 S rRNA to obtain mean and standard deviation. Statistical relevance of discrepancies between groups was evaluated by Student's t test. Prolonged starvation induces dramatic changes in metabolism, including the release of large amounts of fatty acids from the adipose tissue, followed by fatty acid oxidation in the liver. It has been demonstrated that PPARα mediates the adaptive response to fasting (11Kroetz D. Yook P. Costet P. Bianchi P. Pineau T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31581-31589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 12Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Inves. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). To analyze the role of RXRα in fasting-activated PPARα pathways, PPARα-null mic, hepatocyte RXRα-deficient mice, and wild-type controls were deprived from food for 48 h and then the expression of PPARα target genes in the livers was examined by Northern hybridization. In mice fed the control diet, PPARα deficiency caused a reduction in the level of acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX) and cytochrome P450 4A1 (CYP4A1) mRNA encoding the key enzymes involved in fatty acid β- and ω-oxidation pathways (Fig. 1). PPARα deficiency also resulted in a decreased expression of liver fatty acid-binding protein (LFABP) mRNA and a weak induction of apoA-I mRNA. In comparison, RXRα deficiency resulted in inhibition of expression of CYP4A1 and LFABP mRNA. The level of AOX and medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) mRNA remained unchanged. The most striking difference between the PPARα- and RXRα-deficient mice was that the expression of apoA-I and apoC-III mRNA was markedly increased in the absence of RXRα, whereas the induction was very weak, if there was any, in the PPARα-null mice (Fig. 1). In wild-type mice, starvation caused significant induction of the PPARα target gene except for the apoC-III gene (Fig. 1). PPARα deficiency completely abolished PPARα target gene activation induced by starvation. The reduced expression of AOX , MCAD , CYP4A1, and LFABP genes in fasted PPARα-null mice suggested that the transcription of these genes was dependent on PPARα in the fasting state. RXRα deficiency had a similar effect; starvation induced PPARα activation was prevented in the absence of RXRα. Starvation only caused a weak induction of MCAD and CYP4A1 mRNA in RXRα-deficient mice (1.8- and 4-fold induction, respectively) compared with wild-type mice (10- and 20-fold induction, respectively); this weak effect caused by starvation probably was due to the presence of RXRβ and -γ. These data unambiguously proved that in vivo in the hepatocyte, the effect of PPARα and RXRα is coupled. In addition, hepatocyte RXRα has a unique effect in regulating the expression of apolipoprotein genesin vivo. To further analyze the role of RXRα in PPARα/RXRα-mediated pathways; the expression of the PPARα/RXRα target genes was examined in Wy14,643-treated mice. Wild type and RXRα-deficient mice were treated with Wy14,643 (0.1%, w/w) for 10 days. Total liver RNA was extracted for analyzing the expression of PPARα target genes. The results of two representative mouse liver samples from two mice are shown in Fig.2. Consistent with the data demonstrated in Fig. 1, the basal AOX, MCAD, and malic enzyme mRNA level remained unchanged in mutant mouse livers. After Wy14,643 treatment, the expression of AOX, MCAD, and malic enzyme mRNA (× 50, × 20, and × 50, respectively) in the wild-type mouse livers was significantly induced (Fig. 2). In contrast, the inductions were markedly reduced due to hepatocyte RXRα deficiency (only 2–5-fold induction). The expression of the catalase gene was not affected by Wy14,643 in wild-type and mutant mouse livers (Fig. 2). These data indicate that at the physiological level, PPARα/RXRα or RXRα/RXRα do not regulate the basal transcription of the AOX , MCAD, and malic enzyme gene in vivo and that only exogenous ligand (Wy14,643)-activated PPARα/RXRα can regulate the expression of these genes. The weak residual inducibility of these genes by Wy14,643 in the mutant mouse livers may be due to the presence of RXRβ and -γ. In contrast to the AOX , MCAD, and malic enzymegenes, the basal transcription of the CYP4A1 andLFABP genes can be controlled by PPARα/RXRα at the physiological level. CYP4A1 and LFABP mRNA level was reduced about 3-fold in RXRα-deficient mouse livers compared with the wild-type livers (Fig. 3). However, the inducibility of these two genes by Wy14,643 remained the same in mutant mouse livers (Fig. 3). After Wy14,643 administration, there was a 50- and 10-fold induction of CYP4A1 and LFABP mRNA level, respectively, in both wild-type and mutant mouse livers. These data suggest that the basal transcription of the CYP4A1 and LFABP genes is constitutively regulated by PPARα/RXRα or RXRα/RXRα through endogenous ligands such as polyunsaturated fatty acids or 9-cis-retinoic acid in vivo. Therefore, in the absence of RXRα, these genes are expressed at a reduced level. However, when pharmacological levels of exogenous ligands are present, the availability of RXRβ and -γ is sufficient to mediate the inductive effect of Wy14,643. To further understand the role of RXRα in regulating cholesterol and lipid homeostasis, the expression of apoA-I and apoC-III mRNA was examined in Wy14,643-treated mice. In normal cells, PPARα agonists suppress the expression of these genes. RXRα is involved in the basal transcription of the apolipoprotein genes because the basal mRNA levels in normally fed mice were increased in the absence of RXRα (Fig. 4). However, the inhibitory effect of Wy14,643 on apolipoprotein gene expression remained in the absence of hepatocyte RXRα. Taken together, the expression pattern of these PPARα target genes can be divided into two groups. In the first group exemplified by theAOX , MCAD, and malic enzyme genes, these genes' basal mRNA level remains unchanged in mutant mouse liver, but the inducibility of the gene by Wy14,643 is decreased remarkably. In the second group, which includes the CYP4A1 , LFABP , apoA-I, andapoC-III genes, the basal mRNA level is altered in the absence of RXRα, but the regulatory effect of Wy14,643 on gene expression remains unchanged in mutant mouse liver.

These effects were tested in the hepatocyte RXRα-deficient mice. As shown in Fig. 5, basal serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels were elevated in the RXRα-deficient mice, which is consistent with the Northern data (Figs. 1 and 4) demonstrating the induction of apoA-I and apoC-III mRNA in the mutant mouse livers. Administration of Wy14,643 reduced serum triglyceride and cholesterol level not only in wild-type but also in mutant mice. Therefore, Wy14,643 still can exert its hypolipidemic effect even when RXRα is not expressed in the hepatocyte. It is well characterized that Wy14,643 causes liver enlargement due to hypertrophy and hyperplasia (hepatomegaly) of hepatocytes (1Reddy J.K. Mannaerts G.P. Annu. Rev.

In our system, the data was reproducible where Wy14,643 also produced a marked increase in liver weight in the wild-type mouse. The liver/body weight ratio of the wild-type mice increased 2.4-fold after 10 days of Wy14,643 feeding compared with mice fed a standard control diet (TableI). In contrast, the liver/body ratio of hepatocyte RXRα-deficient mouse only increased by 1.6-fold after Wy14,643 treatment. Therefore, the hepatomegaly caused by treatment with the peroxisome proliferator was partially prevented when RXRα was absent.Table ILiver/body weight ratio of wild-type (RXRα +/+) and hepatocyte RXRα-deficient (RXRα −/−) miceRXRα (+/+)RXRα (−/−)ControlWy14,643ControlWy14,643Liver/body weight0.048 ± 0.0050.118 ± 0.0101-ap < 0.05.0.046 ± 0.0050.080 ± 0.0081-ap < 0.05.Mice were fed either a control diet or 0.1% Wy14,643 for 10 days.

Results are the mean ± S.D. of four determinations. Using light and electron microscopy, the liver morphology of the wild-type and RXRα-deficient mice was evaluated (Fig. 6). Compared with wild-type mouse livers, RXRα-deficient mouse livers had normal morphology under light and electron microscope (Fig. 6,a-d). Treatment of wild-type mice with Wy14,643 resulted in pale pink staining of enlarged cells which had increased homogeneous cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic rough endoplasmic reticulum was strikingly reduced (Fig. 6 e). Furthermore, the number and size of peroxisome were significantly increased after the administration of Wy14,643 as demonstrated by electron microscopy (Fig. 6 f). In contrast, under light microscopy, the mutant mouse liver contain both normal and enlarged cells after administration of Wy14,643 (Fig.6 g). Electron microscopy revealed that Wy14,643 still induced hepatocyte peroxisome proliferation in RXRα-deficient mice (Fig. 6 h). Using biochemical and morphological analyses, we have analyzed the hepatic role of RXRα and demonstrated both essential and redundant effects of RXRα in RXRα/PPARα-mediated pathways. Hepatocyte RXRα is crucial for basal lipid and cholesterol homeostasis since serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels are elevated in normally fed mice lacking RXRα. RXRα deficiency can partially prevent the hepatomegaly effect of peroxisome proliferator. Hepatocyte RXRα is essential for maintaining the physiological level of CYP4A1, LFABP, apoA-I, and apoC-III. Hepatocyte RXRα deficiency also significantly prevents starvation and Wy14,643-induced PPARα activation. Mice with hepatocyte RXRα deficiency are unable to increase the capacity for cellular fatty acid utilization in the context of short-term starvation. However, hepatocyte RXRα deficiency neither prevents hepatocyte peroxisome proliferation nor the hypolipidemic effect of the peroxisome proliferators. Since the RXRα, -β, and -γ genes are expressed in different types of liver cells including parenchyma, endothelial, Kupffer, and stellate cells (35Ulven S.M. Natarajan V. Holven K.B. Lvdal T. Berg T.

In PPARα knockout mice, basal serum cholesterol level is elevated to the same extent (1.6-fold induction) as in the hepatocyte-specific RXRα knockout mice. However, young adult male PPARα-null mice have normal serum triglyceride and apoC-III level (16Peters J.M. Hennuyer N. Staels B. Fruchart J.-C. Fievet C. Gonzalez F.J. Auwerx J. J. Biol.

In contrast, in hepatocyte RXRα-deficient mice, a 1.7-fold induction of serum triglyceride level and a remarkable induction ofapoC-III gene expression were observed in 2-month-old male mice. The early induction in serum triglyceride level defines the unique and important role of hepatocyte RXRα in controlling lipid homeostasis. It is possible that the effect of RXRα in regulatingapoC-III gene expression and serum triglyceride level is mediated through dimerization with PPARγ rather than PPARα.Table IIPhenotype comparison between hepatocyte-specific RXRα-deficient and PPARα-null micePhenotypesHepatocyte RXRα-deficient mousePPARα-null mouseHepatomegalyYesNoPeroxisome proliferation induced by PPYesNoSerum cholesterol levelInduced (1.6×)Induced (1.6×)Serum triglyceride level in young adult male miceInduced (1.7×)No changeSerum triglyceride level in aged mice (6–12-month-old)Not doneInduced (higher in females (2×) than males (1.5×))Gene expressionHepatocyte RXRα-deficient mousePPARα-null mouseBasal levelRegulation by PPRegulation by fastingBasal levelRegulation by PPRegulation by fastingAcyl-CoA oxidaseNo changeWeak inductionNo inductionDecreaseNo inductionInhibitionMedium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenaseNo changeWeak inductionWeak inductionNo changeNo inductionInhibitionMalic enzymeNo changeWeak inductionNo response to fastingDecreaseNo inductionNo response to fastingCYP4A1DecreaseInductionWeak inductionDecreaseNo inductionNo inductionLiver fatty acid-binding proteinDecreaseInductionInhibitionDecreaseNo inductionInhibitionApoA-IIncreaseInhibitionNo inductionIncreaseNo inhibitionNo inductionApoC-IIIIncreaseInhibitionNo response to fastingNo changeNo inhibitionNo response to fasting Open table in a new tab In PPARα-null mice, peroxisome proliferators such as clofibrate and Wy14,643 are completely unable to induce hepatomegaly and hepatocyte peroxisome proliferation, and have no effect in regulating the expression of PPARα target genes including AOX , bifunctional enzymes, CYP4A1 , CYP4A3, LFABP , apoA-I, and apoC-III(15Lee S.S.-T.

These data suggest that the effect of PPARα is unique in peroxisome proliferator-mediated pathways, and that PPARβ and -γ cannot replace PPARα. In contrast, in vivo, the roles of RXRα, -β, and -γ appear to be at least partially redundant. Based on our results, the PPARα/RXRα target genes can be categorized into several groups. The first group of genes includesAOX and malic enzyme. The basal transcriptional rate of these genes is controlled by PPARα, but not by RXRα. The second group of genes is CYP4A1 , LFABP, andapoA-I. Within this group, the basal transcriptional rate of the genes is constitutively maintained by PPARα as well as by RXRα through endogenous ligands. The third group of genes include apoC-III. The basal transcriptional rate of the apoC-III gene is controlled by RXRα, but not by PPARα. Since RXRα controls the basal transcription of the CYP4A1 , LFABP, andapoA-I genes, but has no effect on the AOX , MCAD ,and malic enzyme genes, these data suggest that in vivo at the physiological level RXRα is crucial for microsomal ω-hydroxylation of fatty acids, fatty acid transport, and cholesterol and fatty acid homeostasis, whereas RXRα may only become important for AOX- and MCAD-mediated fatty acid β-oxidation and malic enzyme-mediated lipogenesis when pharmacological dose of PPARα ligand is employed. Even though RXRβ and -γ are able to substitute RXRα, the total amount of RXRs is critical in mediating the action of RXRs because in the absence of RXRα, fatty acid is not utilized efficiently in response to starvation and Wy14,643 cannot fully exert its effects. RXR dimerizes with more than 10 different kinds of receptor. Activation one of these RXR-mediated pathways might alter other pathways in opposite directions. When the pool of RXRs is decreased, many RXR-mediated regulatory pathways may be impaired. Based on our data, it seems that the level of RXR, rather than the type of RXR, has a major impact in mediating the effect of peroxisome proliferator. It is crucial to understand the regulation of the RXR genes. RXR can be freely activated in permissive heterodimers with PPAR (37Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonam D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar) although it also can be silent in nonpermissive heterodimers with the thyroid hormone receptor or the vitamin D receptor (38Blumberg B. Evens R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3149-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to test if 9-cis-retinoic acid has the same effect as Wy14,643 on RXRα-deficient mice. 9-cis-Retinoic acid can activate RXR/RAR and RXR/RXR, and that would further deprive the availability of RXR to PPARα. Therefore, challenge the mutant mice with 9-cis-retinoic acid may produce more phenotypes. Taken together, nuclear factors might have unique, redundant, synergistic, or antagonistic effects. These effects depend on the relative level of the receptors, presence of hormones, or the pathological condition. Comprehension of the regulation of liver gene transcription provides insight into the understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to liver physiology, function, development, and differentiation, as well as proliferation.

These comprise kidney glomerular filtration, protease degradation, and active removal from the circulation via specific receptors for various determinants on the protein.

Native serum-derived cholinesterases were found to reside in the circulation for long periods, whereas recombinant cholinesterases produced in tissue culture systems were cleared from the circulation rather rapidly (7Kronman C. Velan B. Marcus D. Ordentlich A. Reuveny S. Shafferman A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 959-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8Chitlaru T. Kronman C. Zeevi M. Kam M. Harel A. Ordentlich A.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7481-7489Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), suggesting that post-translationally related factors determine the circulatory behavior of these enzymes. In the case of AChE, the contribution of carbohydrates to circulatory residence was demonstrated by the finding that bacterially generated recombinant AChE, as well as N-glycanase-treated cholinesterases of animal cell origin, both devoid ofN-glycans, were cleared rapidly from the circulation of experimental animals (7Kronman C. Velan B. Marcus D. Ordentlich A. Reuveny S. Shafferman A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 959-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 10Fischer M. Ittah A. Liefer I. Gorecki M. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1993; 13: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the pharmacokinetic profiles of an array of mutated recombinant human acetylcholinesterases (rHuAChEs), differing by the number of N-glycosylation sites (7Kronman C. Velan B. Marcus D. Ordentlich A. Reuveny S. Shafferman A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 959-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggested that although N-glycosylation in itself does play a role in determining circulatory residence, the structural features of the N-glycans, rather than their actual number, play a decisive role in circulatory retention of cholinesterases. Among the glycan structural features affecting clearance, variations in the level of terminal sialylation are of particular importance because of the recognition and removal of undersialylated glycoproteins by the liver-specific asialoglycoprotein receptor (11Weiss P. Ashwell G. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1989; 300: 169-184PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, enzymatic removal of sialic acid moieties resulted in a catalytically active form of rHuAChE displaying accelerated elimination from the circulation (7Kronman C. Velan B. Marcus D. Ordentlich A. Reuveny S. Shafferman A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 959-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), indicating that sialylation plays a pivotal role in determining the circulatory residence of rHuAChE. The importance of sialylation efficiency was further demonstrated by determining the clearance rates of various derivatives of rHuAChE that differ one from another by their number of N-glycan side chains. Based on direct measurement of the sialic acid content of each one of the examined forms of the enzyme, an inverse linear relationship was found to exist between the number of unoccupied sialic acid attachment sites and the circulatory half-life values of the various enzyme forms (7Kronman C. Velan B. Marcus D. Ordentlich A. Reuveny S. Shafferman A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 959-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This line of studies served as a basis for the conversion of the rHuAChE molecule into its highly sialylated form (8Chitlaru T. Kronman C. Zeevi M. Kam M. Harel A. Ordentlich A. Velan B. Shafferman A. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) by the genetic modulation of the glycosylation machinery of AChE producer cell lines. Although highly sialylated rHuAChE was indeed retained in the circulation for extended periods, it was still cleared from the circulation more rapidly than serum-derived FBS-AChE or HuS-BChE (7Kronman C.

Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), suggesting that additional factors participate in determining the circulatory behavior of cholinesterases. In this context, it should be noted that cholinesterases can occur in multiple forms. Cell-bound AChEs consist of tetramers attached to membrane-anchored noncatalytic subunits such as the ColQ gene-encoded collagen-like tail, through the proline-rich attachment domain (PRAD (13Bon S. Massoulie J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3007-3015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)), whereas secreted cholinesterases such as those residing in the circulation (e.g. FBS-AChE) are usually composed of soluble homotetramers. In contrast to the tetrameric serum-derived cholinesterases, recombinant cholinesterases produced in tissue culture systems were found to consist mostly of dimers and monomers (7Kronman C. Velan B.

In a previous report, we documented the cloning of the bovine acetylcholinesterase gene and developed systems for the high level production of recombinant bovine AChE (rBoAChE) in a human cell line (16Mendelson I. Kronman C. Ariel N. Shafferman A. Velan B. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This recombinant enzyme displayed a distinct pharmacokinetic profile that was characterized by its rapid removal from the circulation. In contrast, native serum-derived FBS-AChE, with which rBoAChE shares an identical amino acid sequence, was retained in the circulation for extended periods. Thus, two versions of the same protein that differ in their post-translational processing only exhibit markedly different pharmacokinetic behaviors and can therefore serve as a model system for inspection of post-translational factors involved in circulatory residence. This could not be achieved with the human recombinant enzyme due to the lack of an available native long lived form of human AChE. In the work presented in this report, we determined the effects of the various post-translational features of the recombinant bovine enzyme upon its circulatory behavior. Exhaustive MALDI-TOF analysis of derivatized N-glycans associated with both rBoAChE and native FBS-AChE allowed us to determine the exact structures of the carbohydrates of the respective enzymes. We found that the native and recombinant forms of bovine acetylcholinesterase differ in their glycan-terminal occupancy. The efficient capping of glycans with either sialic acid or with α-galactose, which characterized the native form of bovine AChE, was evaluated for their contribution to circulatory longevity. On the basis of this analysis, a genetic approach for the pharmacokinetic remediation of rBoAChE was designed and implemented. This line of studies was then followed by a series of experiments in which the effect of rBoAChE subunit assembly modulation on circulatory residence was examined. We demonstrate that a series of modulations can convert the rapidly cleared rBoAChE into a circulatory long lived enzyme, exhibiting a pharmacokinetic profile that is indistinguishable from that of the native fetal bovine serum acetylcholinesterase. Finally, by creating a large collection of carefully defined bovine AChE glycoproteins differing in the extent of glycan sialylation and enzyme subunit oligomerization, we demonstrate that a hierarchic pattern of post-translational factors determines circulatory longevity. Generation of HEK-293 cell lines stably expressing high levels of rBoAChE was described previously (16Mendelson I. Kronman C. Ariel N. Shafferman A. Velan B. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The generation ofin vivo highly sialylated rBoAChE was achieved by transfecting the recombinant sialyltransferase expressor HEK-293ST-2D6 cell line (see below) with the pBoAChE-nc vector followed by G418 selection to form rBoAChE stable producer cells. Purification of the secreted rBoAChE and purification of FBS-AChE from calf serum (Biological Industries, Beth Hemeek, Israel) were all described previously (16Mendelson I. Kronman C. Ariel N. Shafferman A. Velan B. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Individual HEK-293 cell clones stably transfected with the pCEP4-α2,6ST plasmid carrying the rat β-galactoside α2,6-sialyltransferase gene (8Chitlaru T. Kronman C. Zeevi M. Kam M. Harel A. Ordentlich A. Velan B. Shafferman A. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) were tested for their ability to generate highly sialylated glycoproteins as follows: 96-well plates (Nunc, Maxisorp) were coated with decreasing amounts of cleared cell extracts (8Chitlaru T. Kronman C. Zeevi M. Kam M. Harel A. Ordentlich A. Velan B. Shafferman A. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) of the various clones (5–0.3 μg/ml in carbonate buffer pH 9.6, 4 h at 37 °C). Plates were then rinsed 3 times in 0.9% NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 and subjected to a consecutive series of incubations (1 h at 37 °C each) in the following: 1) 0.5% Tween 20, 1% gelatin, PBS; 2) biotinylated Sambucus nigra lectin (Sigma, 1 μg/ml in 0.5% Tween 20/PBS); and 3) streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma, 500 milliunits/ml in 0.5% Tween 20/PBS). Following each incubation step, plates were rinsed 3 times in 0.9% NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20. Plates were developed and read in a Thermomax (Menlo Park, CA) as described before (17Shafferman A. Kronman C. Flashner Y. Leitner S. Grosfeld H. Ordentlich A. Gozes Y. Cohen S. Ariel N. Barak D. Harel M. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Velan B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17640-17648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Optical density was plotted against bound cellular protein and cell-associated sialic acid levels (measured as mOD/μg protein) of the various clones were calculated. Clone HEK-293ST-2D6 displayed the highest level of sialic acid and subsequently served as the master cell line for expression and production of highly sialylated AChE. AChE activity was measured according to Ellman et al. (18Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21721) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in the presence of 0.5 mm acetylthiocholine, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 0.3 mm5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid). The assay was carried out at 27 °C and monitored by a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Clearance experiments in mice (3–6 ICR male mice per enzyme sample) and analysis of pharmacokinetic profiles were carried out as described previously (7Kronman C. Velan B. Marcus D. Ordentlich A. Reuveny S. Shafferman A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 959-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The study was approved by the local ethical committee on animal experiments. Residual AChE activity in blood samples was measured, and all values were corrected for background activity determined in blood samples withdrawn 1 h before performing the experiment. The clearance patterns of the various enzyme preparations were usually biphasic and fitted to a bi-exponential elimination pharmacokinetic model (Ct =Ae −kα t +Be −kβt) as described previously (7Kronman C. Velan B. Marcus D. Ordentlich A. Reuveny S. Shafferman A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 959-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This model enables determination of the parameters A and B that represent the fractions of the material removed from the circulation in the first-fast and second-slow elimination phases, respectively, andT½α and T½β that represent the circulatory half-life values of the enzyme in the fast and slow phases. The pharmacokinetic parameters MRT (which reflects the average length of time the administered molecules are retained in the organism) and CL (clearance, which represents the proportionality factor relating the rate of substance elimination to its plasma concentration (CL, dose/area under the concentration time curve) (19Rowland M. Tozer T.N. Clinical Pharmacokinetics: Concepts and Applications. Lea and Febiger, Philadelphia1989Google Scholar)) were independently obtained by analyzing the clearance data according to a noncompartmental pharmacokinetic model using the WinNonlin computer program (20Laub P.B. Gallo J.M. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 85: 393-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). N-Glycans of purified enzyme preparations (∼100 μg of protein) were released by N-glycosidase F (Glyco) treatment as described before (21Kronman C. Velan B. Gozes Y. Leitner M. Flashner Y. Lazar A. Marcus D. Sery T. Grosfeld H. Cohen S. Shafferman A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 121: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Deglycosylated protein was removed by ethanol precipitation, and glycans were recovered and purified from the supernatant as described by Kuster et al.(22Kuster B. Wheeler S.F. Hunter A.P. Dwek R.A. Harvey D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 82-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). To increase sensitivity (23Anumula K.R. Dhume S.T. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 24Okafo G. Burrow L. Carr S.A. Roberts G.D. Johnson W. Camilleri P. Anal.

Chem. 1997; 69: 4985-4993Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) purified glycans were fluorescently labeled. Fluorescent labeling of purified glycans with 2-aminobenzamide (2-AB) was performed according to Bigge et al. (26Bigge J.C. Patel T.P. Bruce J.A. Goulding P.N. Charles S.M. Parekh R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 230: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar) using a commercial labeling kit (Glyco). During the 2-h labeling incubation, the temperature was kept at 55 °C to prevent heat-induced desialylation of the glycans. Agarose-bound sialidase (0.04 unit, Sigma) was prewashed 5 times with water and incubated at room temperature for 16 h with 2-AB-labeledN-glycans released from 1.5 to 2.0 nmol AChE. Sialidase was removed by Eppendorf centrifugation. Desialylated N-glycans were vacuum-dried, resuspended in 30 μl of water, and stored at −20 °C until use. Glycans prepared in this manner were subjected to MALDI-TOF analysis or to further glycosidase treatments followed by MALDI-TOF analysis. Desialylated 2-AB-labeled N-glycans obtained from 0.05 to 0.07 nmol of AChE (in 1 μl of water) were incubated for 24 h with 1 μl of bovine kidney fucosidase (1.3 unit/ml, Glyco), β-galactosidase (5 units/ml, Glyco), or Green coffee bean α-galactosidase (0.5 unit/ml, Sigma). Water was added to a final volume of 10 μl, and samples were stored at −20 °C until analyzed by MALDI-TOF. Pure rBoAChE (1.8 nmol) was incubated for 20 h at 37 °C in the presence of 2 milliunits of α2,6ST (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 100 nmol of CMP-N-acetyl-neuraminic acid in 50 mm NaCl (final volume = 800 μl). In vitro sialylated rBoAChE was extensively dialyzed against PBS for pharmacokinetics studies. AChE (100 nmol of enzyme) in PBS was incubated for 16 h with 1.2 units of agarose-bound sialidase at room temperature. Sialidase was removed by Eppendorf centrifugation. Desialylated enzyme was dialyzed against PBS to remove free sialic acid. Highly purified FBS-AChE (6 nmol in PBS) was incubated for 5 h at 37 °C with 8 units of α-galactosidase, followed by extensive dialysis against PBS. To determine whether α-galactose removal proceeded to completion, a portion of the α-galactosidase-treated enzyme was subjected toN-glycosidase F treatment, 2-AB labeling, and desialylation as detailed above, followed by MALDI-TOF analysis. Following AChE treatment with modifying glycosidases (sialidase or α-galactosidase), ChE activity was measured, to verify that enzyme integrity was not compromised by the treatment. To allow the concomitant measurement by MALDI-TOF analysis of both neutral and acidic glycans, the carboxylic groups of sialylated 2-AB-labeled glycans were converted into their neutral methylated forms by methyl iodide esterification, essentially as described by Kuster et al. (22Kuster B. Wheeler S.F. Hunter A.P. Dwek R.A. Harvey D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 82-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). We note that in this procedure the 2-AB moiety itself undergoes methylation, and therefore both neutral and acidic glycans invariably display an increment in molecular mass of 14.015 kDa in addition to the increase in mass size resulting from sialic acid methylation in the case of acidic glycans. Esterified glycans were purified as described (22Kuster B. Wheeler S.F. Hunter A.P. Dwek R.A. Harvey D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 82-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and stored at −20 °C until MALDI-TOF analysis. Mass spectra were acquired on a Micromass TofSpec 2E reflectron time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer. 2-AB-labeled desialylated or 2-AB-labeled esterified glycan samples were mixed with an equal volume of freshly prepared 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (10 mg/ml in 70% acetonitrile) and loaded onto the mass spectrometer target. Routinely, 1 μl of glycan samples diluted 1:10 in water were subjected to analysis. Dried spots were recrystallized by adding 0.5 μl of ethanol and allowed to dry again. Neutral glycans were observed as [M + Na]+ions. 1 μl of peptide mixture (renin substrate, ACTH fragment 18–39, and angiotensin, 10 pmol/μl all from Sigma), which served as a three-point external calibrant for mass assignment of the ions, was mixed with freshly prepared α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 mg/ml in 49.5% acetonitrile; 49.5% ethanol; 0.001% trifluoroacetic acid), loaded on the mass spectrometer target, and allowed to dry. All oligosaccharides were analyzed at 20 kV with a single stage reflectron in the positive ion mode. Between 100 and 200 scans were averaged for each of the spectra shown. The PRAD peptide CLLTPPPPPLFPPPFFRG was synthesized manually in a T-bag by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry, as described (27Houghten R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5131-5135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). The peptide was dialyzed against 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid for 48 h. Quality control of the peptide was performed by MALDI-TOF-MS, and its concentration was evaluated by its absorbance at 215 nm following reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Purified rBoAChE was incubated together with the synthetic PRAD peptide for 12–16 h at room temperature, in the presence of 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. In analytical tetramerization experiments designed for sucrose gradient analysis of tetramer formation, 0.12 nmol of rBoAChE (equivalent to 25 units) were mixed with different ratios of the PRAD peptide as indicated, in a final volume of 70 μl. Preparative tetramerization for the generation of milligram amounts of tetrameric rBoAChE for pharmacokinetic studies included 14.4 nmol of rBoAChE (equivalent to 3000 units) that were incubated with 28.8 nmol of PRAD peptide in a final volume of 2 ml. Prior to administration to mice,in vitro tetramerized rBoAChE was dialyzed extensively against PBS. Analytical sucrose density gradient centrifugation was performed on 5–25% sucrose gradients containing 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. Centrifugation was carried out in an SW41 Ti rotor (Beckman) for 26 h at 160,000. Fractions of 0.2 ml were collected and assayed for AChE activity. Alkaline phosphatase, catalase, and β-galactosidase were used as a sedimentation markers. To determine whether the differential pharmacokinetic patterns of FBS-AChE and its recombinant version expressed in a mammalian cell line (16Mendelson I. Kronman C. Ariel N. Shafferman A. Velan B. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) can be correlated with the presence/absence of specific glycan structures, the N-glycans associated with the two enzymes were subjected to a detailed structural analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy in conjunction with specific exoglycosidase digestions. In a first series of studies, the glycans derived from rBoAChE and FBS-AChE were deacidified by sialidase treatment and extensively analyzed in their nonsialylated form. This treatment which removes terminal sialic acids enables easy detection of the glycans by overcoming the inherent difficulty of analyzing negatively charged oligosaccharides by MALDI-TOF (22Kuster B. Wheeler S.F. Hunter A.P. Dwek R.A. Harvey D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 82-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 28Powell A.K. Harvey D.J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 29Papac D.I. Wong A. Jones A.J.S. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 3215-3223Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). To increase sensitivity further, N-glycans released by the N-glycosidase F digestion were fluorescently labeled with 2-AB (see “Materials and Methods”). The analysis of N-glycans generated by this procedure provided the complete basic structure, branching/antennary typing and specific monosaccharide substitutions (e.g.fucosylation, presence of GalNAc) regardless of the terminal sialic acid occupancy status. The MALDI-TOF spectra obtained for rBoAChE and FBS-AChE (Fig.1 A and Table I) revealed that the oligosaccharide species associated with both enzymes are comprised of a large variety of 8–11 basic glycan structures, differing both quantitatively in their relative abundance and qualitatively with respect to branching and monosaccharide substitutions. Based on molecular weight matching, the basic structural identity of most of the glycans could be deduced. In some cases, an ambiguity remained due to equivalent masses of isomeric or anomeric monosaccharides. To resolve these ambiguities, desialylated glycan pools were subjected to a series of monosaccharide-specific exoglycosidase (α-galactosidase, β -galactosidase, and fucosidase) treatments, and the resulting glycan products were subjected to MALDI-TOF analysis. Based on the molecular weight shift of the trimmed glycans (Fig. 1, B–D) the structures of the entire spectrum of glycans could be deciphered unequivocally (Table I). The relative abundance of the various oligosaccharide structures could thereby be determined, provided that these comprise more than 1% of the total glycan pool.Table IComparison of the basic glycan structures of desialylated rBoAChE and FBS-AChEMolecular weights, deduced structures, and relative abundances of enzymatically desialylated N-glycan structures associated with rBoAChE and FBS-AChE were determined from the MALDI-TOF spectra represented in Fig. 1.

Here, we report identification of 12 distinct transcripts of human RGS12 that arise by unusually complex splicing of the RGS12 gene, which spans 70 kilobase pairs of genomic DNA and contains 16 exons. These transcripts arise by both cis- andtrans-splicing mechanisms, are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, and encode proteins ranging in size from 356 to 1447 amino acids. Both 5′- and 3′-splicing of two primary RGS12 transcripts occur to generate RGS12 mRNAs encoding proteins with four distinct N-terminal domains, three distinct C-terminal domains, and a common internal region where the semiconserved RGS domain is located. Confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation of COS-7 cells expressing RGS12 proteins with three different N termini (brain (B), peripheral (P), and trans-spliced (TS)) and a shared short (S) C-terminal domain demonstrated exclusive nuclear localization of these proteins and an influence of the N-terminal region on the pattern of intranuclear distribution. Both native RGS12TS-S in HEK-293T cells and ectopically expressed RGS12TS-S localized to discrete nuclear foci (dots), a characteristic of various tumor suppressor proteins. Subnuclear localization of RGS12TS-S into nuclear dots was cell cycle-dependent. Native RGS12TS-S associated with the metaphase chromosome during mitosis, and ectopically expressed RGS12TS-S induced formation of abnormally shaped and multiple nuclei in COS-7 cells. Expression of RGS12 proteins with long and intermediate C-terminal domains was not observed in COS-7 cells, suggesting that 3′-splicing of RGS12 transcripts may influence the expression or stability of the encoded proteins.

Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4682) Google Scholar for review). These receptors activate G proteins by stimulating exchange of GTP for GDP on the α subunit (Gα) of the inactive G protein heterotrimer (Gαβγ) to promote dissociation into Gα-GTP and Gβγ subunits. Both of these G protein subunits function as signal-transducing molecules by regulating activities of various effector proteins including enzymes and ion channels. The intensity and duration of signaling by G proteins are highly regulated. The key element that controls the lifetime of active Gα and Gβγ is the intrinsic GTPase activity of the Gα subunits, producing Gα-GDP and its reassembly with Gβγ.RGS (regulators of G proteinsignaling) proteins constitute a family of proteins originally defined by the presence of a semiconserved region of ∼120 amino acids called the RGS domain (3Koelle M.R. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). These proteins appear to function as negative regulators of G protein signaling in organisms ranging from yeast to man (4Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

The discovery that RGS proteins, or their isolated RGS domains, function as GTPase-activating proteins for certain Gα subunits in vitro (6Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 7Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27209-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) provided the first insight into how these proteins may exert regulatory influences on G protein signaling. The crystal structure of RGS4 bound to Gαi1 demonstrated interaction of the RGS domain with the G protein switch regions and suggested that the mechanism of GTPase activation by RGS proteins may be due to a reduction in the free energy of the transition state (8Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Coleman and Sprang (9Coleman D.E. Sprang S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16669-16672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) recently suggested that RGS proteins may both stabilize the transition state and release Gα subunits from an autoinhibited ground state to enhance their GTPase activity. Additional studies have raised the possibility that some RGS proteins may interact with effectors or receptors to attenuate G protein signaling. These studies showed that recombinant RGS proteins can block phosphoinositide-dependent phospholipase C activation by active Gq in vitro and produce receptor-selective attenuation of Gq signaling when added to permeabilized cells (10Hepler J.R.

Although Koelle and Horvitz (3Koelle M.R. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) first predicted the existence of at least 15 mammalian RGS family members, this number has grown to exceed that of the number of identified Gα subunits; yet the GTPase-activating protein activity of RGS proteins appears to be limited to proteins in the Gi and Gq family (4Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), raising an interesting dilemma regarding the physiological significance of such a large family of RGS proteins.We undertook studies to clone members of the human RGS protein family to further our understanding of the structural diversity within this family. This knowledge is crucial to understanding the structural determinants that might be involved in regulating the specificity and function(s) of RGS proteins. Here we report the identification of 12 distinct transcripts of human RGS12 and define their molecular basis of origin. These transcripts arise by extraordinarily complex splicing of the RGS12 gene, providing the first documentation of alternative splicing of an RGS protein gene. Transcripts encoding the different N-terminal forms of RGS12 were expressed in a tissue-specific fashion, and the expression and intracellular pattern of distribution of RGS12 proteins were affected by splicing at the 5′- and 3′-ends of their corresponding mRNAs. Our results demonstrate the exclusive nuclear localization of three distinct N-terminal forms of RGS12 in COS-7 cells, with one form (RGS12TS-S) localizing to discrete foci (nuclear dots), a characteristic of various tumor suppressor proteins. We developed an antibody to RGS12TS proteins and identified the endogenous expression of RGS12TS-S in HEK-293T cells. Localization of native RGS12TS-S in nuclear dots was cell cycle-dependent and independent of changes in the level of RGS12TS-S protein. Native RGS12TS-S associated with the metaphase chromosome in mitotic cells and ectopically expressed RGS12TS-S induced formation of abnormally shaped and multiple nuclei in COS-7 cells.DISCUSSIONThis study has elucidated a remarkable complexity in processing of the RGS12 gene to produce 12 distinct forms of RGS12 differing in both N- and C-terminal sequences. These results are the first to document alternative splicing of an RGS protein gene. Thus, both genes for RGS proteins and their presumed regulatory targets, Gα subunits, may be spliced differentially to produce proteins with distinct structural features. Our results show that transcripts encoding the different N-terminal forms of RGS12 are expressed in a tissue-specific fashion and that the expression and intracellular pattern of distribution of RGS12 proteins are affected by splicing at the 5′- and 3′-ends of their corresponding mRNAs. Our demonstration that the short forms of RGS12 proteins are nuclear proteins suggests that the functional role of these proteins might be very different from that proposed for many members of the RGS protein family. Indeed, we demonstrate here that native RGS12TS-S exhibits a pattern of subnuclear targeting to nuclear dots (characteristic of various tumor suppressor proteins) that is cell cycle-dependent and associates with the metaphase chromosome during mitosis. Ectopic expression of RGS12TS-S in COS-7 cells induced nuclear abnormalities and multinucleated cells that were not observed in cells expressing other RGS proteins.The complexity and mechanism of splicing of the RGS12 gene are extraordinary. First, there appears to be two distinct primary transcripts arising from the RGS12 gene, one that includes exon 1 and one that does not. The latter apparently arises from an alternate transcriptional start site resulting in retention of sequences from intron 1 and an in-frame translational start site located 24 bp 5′ to exon 2. Second, the primary transcript lacking exon 1 can be spliced to remove or retain intron 3, producing the RGS12P and RGS12L transcripts, respectively. Third, the primary transcript retaining exon 1 undergoes cis- or trans-splicing to generate RGS12B and RGS12TS, respectively. Finally, the 3′-ends of the RGS12 transcripts are spliced to retain exons 14–16, to skip exon 14, or to retain intron 15 to produce the long, short, and intermediate 3′-splice forms of RGS12. This splicing appears to occur in each of the four different 5′-splice forms of RGS12. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that the RGS12 transcripts encoding the four N-terminal forms of RGS12 are expressed in a tissue-specific fashion,i.e. with transcripts encoding RGS12B present only in brain, those encoding RGS12L present only in lung, and those encoding RGS12P and RGS12TS present in several tissues. Thus, these unique transcripts appear to originate in an orderly and tissue-specific fashion.RGS12TS is unique in being the only RGS12 protein encoded by splicing of transcripts from discontinuous gene segments, a particularly noveltrans-splicing mechanism that has been described previously in only a limited number of genes. Such intermolecular splicing has been implicated in the generation of mRNA species in protozoa, plants, and mammals (16Bonen L. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In mammals, rat androgen-binding protein/sex hormone-binding globulin gene transcripts, located on chromosome 10, are fused in mature mRNA transcripts to histidine decarboxylase gene transcripts, originating from chromosome 3 (27Sullivan P.M. Petrusz P. Szpirer C. Joseph D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 143-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similartrans-splicing of coding sequences from different chromosomes generates c-Myb mRNA in human thymic cells (28Vellard M. Sureau A. Soret J. Martinerie C. Perbal B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2511-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).trans-Splicing also generates multi-isotype immunoglobulin transcripts from a single B lymphocyte and multiple types of chimeric germ-line immunoglobulin heavy chain transcripts in human B cells (29Shimizu A. Honjo T. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar,30Fujieda S. Lin Y.Q. Saxon A. Zhabg K. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3450-3459PubMed Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that RGS12TS could arise from a recombinant gene, arising in a somatic cell from chromosomal breakage and gene rearrangement. However, no evidence indicates the occurrence of such widespread gene rearrangements in a subpopulation of cells in healthy individuals (i.e. CLONTECHcDNAs), and the existing gene data bases show that the sequence encoding the 5′-end of RGS12TS is located 170 kilobases downstream from the RGS12 gene on the opposite DNA strand.It seems likely that the complex pattern of splicing of RGS12 mRNAs is reflective of cellular mechanisms for orchestrating a diversity of functions for the encoded RGS12 proteins. Our results suggest that splicing at the 3′-end of RGS12 transcripts affects expression/stability of the protein, whereas RGS12 transcripts encoding three different N-terminal forms of RGS12 showed equivalent levels of expression in the nucleus. However, splicing at the 5′-end of the primary RGS12 transcript can produce RGS12 proteins that are targeted to discrete intranuclear sites as observed for RGS12TS-S. On the other hand, retention of RGS12 mRNA sequences encoding the 491-amino acid C-terminal region of all short forms of RGS12 may reflect the importance of this region for RGS12 activity. Although this region includes the conserved RGS domain, it shares no homology with any other protein except RGS14, whose function is not yet known.Both ectopically expressed short forms of RGS12 proteins and native RGS12TS-S in HEK-293T cells are localized to the nucleus, suggesting that these proteins are constitutively nuclear proteins; yet we cannot discount the possibility that RGS12 proteins might translocate out of the nucleus in response to some type of cellular stimulus. The presence of RGS proteins in the nucleus suggests a dramatic separation in space from their presumed regulatory targets, i.e. Gα proteins. We are unaware of evidence for nuclear localization of Gα subunits, although Park et al. (31Park J.-G Muise A. He G.-P. Kim S.-W. Ro H.-S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4004-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) recently showed that Gβγ5 complexes localize to the nucleus in NIH 3T3-L1 cells and attenuate the transcriptional repression activity ofadipocyte enhancer-bindingprotein (AEBP1). If Gα subunits do not localize to and exert regulatory effects in the nucleus, it seems possible that RGS proteins could have other functions in the nucleus. This seems particularly likely for RGS12 proteins in view of their apparent exclusive localization within the nucleus and the considerable contribution of non-RGS domain sequences to the primary structure of these proteins. However, RGS12 proteins are not unique among RGS proteins in their nuclear localization. We recently showed that RGS4 and RGS16, although predominantly cytoplasmic proteins, shuttle in and out of the nucleus via a leptomycin B-sensitive pathway, whereas RGS2 and RGS10 are predominantly nuclear proteins (14Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24013-24021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).However, RGS12TS-S is unique among RGS proteins in its subnuclear organization into nuclear dots, a feature shared by various tumor suppressor proteins. Our results suggest that RGS12TS-S localizes to nuclear dots during the G1/S phase of the cell cycle and that this occurs independent of changes in the steady-state concentration of the protein. BRCA1 and BARD1 also localize to nuclear dots during progression to S phase and disperse thereafter (19Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 20Jin Y. Xu X.L. Yang M.-C.W. Wei F. Ayi T.-C. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12075-12080Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Although BRCA1 localization into these structures is accompanied by increases in both its steady-state level and phosphorylation state, localization of BARD1 in these nuclear dots occurs independent of changes in its content (20Jin Y. Xu X.L. Yang M.-C.W. Wei F. Ayi T.-C. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12075-12080Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Whether the mechanism underlying formation of RGS12TS-S nuclear dots involves its phosphorylation or other modification and/or its interaction with other proteins as part of a multiprotein complex is not known at present. However, RGS12TS-S is rich in consensus sites for phosphorylation by various protein kinases and possesses various protein-binding modules including a PDZ domain (amino acids 30–99), a phosphotyrosine-binding domain (amino acids 225–374), a phosphotyrosine-interacting domain (amino acids 928–939), two Ras-like Raf-binding domains (amino acids 962–1032 and 1034–1104), and a guanylyl nucleotide exchange factor domain (amino acids 1187–1209) in addition to its RGS domain (amino acids 715–832). Although the precise function of BRCA1 is unknown, the sensitivity of S phase BRCA1 nuclear dots to DNA damage (19Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), the inability of BRCA1-deficient stem cells to carry out transcription-coupled DNA repair (32Gowen L.C. Avrutskaya A.V. Latour A.M. Koller B.H. Leadon S.A. Science. 1998; 281: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), and the presence of germ-line mutations in BRCA1 in approximately half the heritable forms of breast and ovarian cancers (33Easton D.F. Bishop D.T. Ford D. Crockford G.P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 52: 678-701PubMed Google Scholar) suggest an important role in genome surveillance.Thus, it is interesting to note that RGS12TS-S is unique among various RGS proteins we examined in its ability to produce abnormal nuclear morphology and multinucleated cells when ectopically expressed in COS-7 cells. The mechanism by which RGS12TS-S influences nuclear morphology is not clear; however, it appears that ectopic expression of RGS12TS-S dysregulates cytokinesis and/or nuclear division in COS-7 cells. The precise biochemical events involved in regulation of nuclear and cell division processes are not fully understood. Among various proteins implicated in cytokinesis and DNA replication checkpoint control areaurora and Ipl1-likemidbody-associated protein (AIM-1) and ataxiatelangiectasia mutated- and Rad3-related protein (ATR) (34Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Suzuki F. Yasuda Y. Fujita S. Otsu M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 35Cliby W.A. Roberts C.J. Cimprich K.A. Stringer C.M. Lamb J.R. Schreiber S.L. Friend S.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of AIM-1 or its kinase-inactive mutant induces abnormally shaped and multiple nuclei in cells (34Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Suzuki F. Yasuda Y. Fujita S. Otsu M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), as we observed here for RGS12TS-S. Obviously, further studies are needed to define the precise biological role of RGS12TS-S and the mechanisms underlying its localization/delocalization in nuclear dots and its ability to induce nuclear anomalies upon its overexpression. The observed cell cycle-dependent localization of RGS12TS-S in nuclear dots and its ability to induce nuclear aberrations may indicate the involvement of RGS12TS-S in nuclear processes that are cell cycle-regulated.It is important to consider the present results in relation to previous studies of RGS12. Koelle and Horvitz (3Koelle M.R. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) first identified and named a partial expressed sequence tag as RGS12 based upon its homology to the RGS domains of Egl-10, RGS1, and RGS2. Although the identity of this transcript is unknown because it includes only 51 amino acids of the RGS domain, we utilized this sequence to amplify the RGS12 transcripts described here. Snow et al. (36Snow B.E. Antonio L. Suggs S. Gutstein H.B. Siderovski D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) first isolated, by hybridization screening, a rat homolog of the cDNA named RGS12TS-I in the present study. We then reported sequences encoding the long forms of the four N-terminal forms of RGS12 in the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank. Snow et al. (37Snow B.E. Hall R.A. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Bouchard D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17749-17755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) used a probe to the unique 3′-end of one of the sequences we reported to show that RGS12TS transcripts also exist with this unique 3′-end (i.e. corresponding to the long forms described here). In this same report, these workers identified a cDNA encoding a rat homolog of RGS12B and showed that a recombinant fusion protein of the RGS domain of rat RGS12 acted as a GTPase-activating protein in vitro for recombinant Gαi and Gαo, but not Gαs or Gαq. However, we failed to detect Gαi immunoreactivity in RGS12TS-S nuclear dots or changes in plasma membrane-associated Gαiimmunoreactivity in EcR293–12TS-GFP cells following inducible expression of RGS12TS-S (data not shown). Mao et al. (38Mao J. Yuan H. Xie W. Simon M.I. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27118-27123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) recently showed that transfection of NIH 3T3 cells with rat RGS12TS-I attenuated serum response factor activation mediated by GTPase-deficient forms of G12 and G13 as well as by receptors acting through both Gq/11-dependent and -independent pathways. These results raise interesting questions concerning how this effect of RGS12TS-I is mediated, in part due to the lack of GTPase-activating protein activity of the isolated RGS domain of this protein toward Gq (37Snow B.E. Hall R.A. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Bouchard D. Brothers C.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Gilman A.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Siderovski D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17749-17755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Moreover, the ability of rat RGS12 to inhibit responses mediated by GTPase-deficient forms of G12/13suggests this effect is not likely a result of GTPase activation. Although we cannot discount the sequence differences between the rat RGS12TS used in the study by Mao et al. (38Mao J. Yuan H. Xie W. Simon M.I. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27118-27123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) or their use of NIH 3T3 cells, our results show that this form of RGS12TS is not measurably expressed in COS-7 cells. In view of our evidence for nuclear expression of RGS12, its interesting to consider a possible direct nuclear role of RGS12 in inhibition of serum response factor-mediated gene transcription, particularly that mediated by GTPase-deficient forms of G12/13.It is still unclear why such a large family of genes encoding RGS proteins exists in man and other species. Here, we have complicated this issue by demonstrating that a single gene in this family can be processed to 12 distinct RGS protein transcripts. Perhaps the observed differential expression of these forms in a heterologous system and their nuclear patterns of expression reflect attributes fundamentally important to the cellular activities of these proteins. Despite the presence of an RGS domain, the apparent constitutive nuclear localization of RGS12 proteins implicates them in activities distinct from regulation of cell-surface G protein-coupled receptor signaling. Hopefully, these results will facilitate studies to define the biological functions of RGS proteins in the nucleus. Heterotrimeric G proteins are components of many major signaling systems used by cells to transduce a variety of signals (neurotransmitters, hormones, light, and olfactory and taste signals) from specific cell-surface receptors to effector proteins (see Refs. 1Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholarand 2Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4682) Google Scholar for review). These receptors activate G proteins by stimulating exchange of GTP for GDP on the α subunit (Gα) of the inactive G protein heterotrimer (Gαβγ) to promote dissociation into Gα-GTP and Gβγ subunits. Both of these G protein subunits function as signal-transducing molecules by regulating activities of various effector proteins including enzymes and ion channels. The intensity and duration of signaling by G proteins are highly regulated. The key element that controls the lifetime of active Gα and Gβγ is the intrinsic GTPase activity of the Gα subunits, producing Gα-GDP and its reassembly with Gβγ. RGS (regulators of G proteinsignaling) proteins constitute a family of proteins originally defined by the presence of a semiconserved region of ∼120 amino acids called the RGS domain (3Koelle M.R. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). These proteins appear to function as negative regulators of G protein signaling in organisms ranging from yeast to man (4Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 5Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3871-3874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The discovery that RGS proteins, or their isolated RGS domains, function as GTPase-activating proteins for certain Gα subunits in vitro (6Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 7Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27209-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) provided the first insight into how these proteins may exert regulatory influences on G protein signaling. The crystal structure of RGS4 bound to Gαi1 demonstrated interaction of the RGS domain with the G protein switch regions and suggested that the mechanism of GTPase activation by RGS proteins may be due to a reduction in the free energy of the transition state (8Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Coleman and Sprang (9Coleman D.E. Sprang S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16669-16672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) recently suggested that RGS proteins may both stabilize the transition state and release Gα subunits from an autoinhibited ground state to enhance their GTPase activity. Additional studies have raised the possibility that some RGS proteins may interact with effectors or receptors to attenuate G protein signaling. These studies showed that recombinant RGS proteins can block phosphoinositide-dependent phospholipase C activation by active Gq in vitro and produce receptor-selective attenuation of Gq signaling when added to permeabilized cells (10Hepler J.R.

To identify further targets of the 2A proteinase of human rhinovirus serotype 2 (HRV2), an in vitro cleavage assay followed by two-dimensional electrophoresis was employed. Cytokeratin 8, a member of the intermediate filament group of proteins, was found to be proteolytically cleaved in vitro by the 2A proteinase of HRV2 and of coxsackievirus B4 and in vivo during HRV2 infection of HeLa cells. The cleavage results in removal of 14 amino acids from the N-terminal head domain of cytokeratin 8. However, other intermediate filament proteins (cytokeratins 7 and 18 and vimentin) were not cleaved in the course of the HRV2 infection. Compared with the processing of the eucaryotic translation initiation factors 4GI and 4GII, cleavage of cytokeratin 8 occurs late in the infection cycle at the time of the onset of the cytopathic effect.

By proteolytically attacking host proteins, viruses interfere with cellular metabolism and structural organization to promote expression of their own genome. Proteolytic processing is essential for viral replication, since picornaviruses are small positive strand RNA viruses that contain a single long open reading frame. The RNA is translated into a large polyprotein precursor, which is cleaved into the mature viral proteins by a sequence of proteolytic cleavages. In the case of rhino- and enteroviruses, at least two viral proteinases are involved in processing of the primary translation product. The first proteolytic step is the cleavage of the polyprotein by 2A proteinase (2Apro),1 which cleaves between the C terminus of VP1 and its own N terminus to separate the capsid protein region from the nonstructural protein precursor (1.Hellen C.U.T. Kräusslich H.G. Wimmer E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9881-9890Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). All remaining cleavages are carried out by the 3C proteinase (3Cpro) or its precursor 3CD except for the cleavage of VP0 to the capsid proteins VP4 and VP2, which occurs during viral maturation. Since these proteinases are highly specific (2.Sommergruber W. Ahorn H. Klump H. Seipelt J. Zoephel A. Fessl F. Krystek E. Blaas D. Kuechler E. Liebig H.D. Skern T.

Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22639-22644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is to be expected that only a small number of cellular proteins will be cleaved by these proteinases. This is indeed the case, as was observed in extracts of poliovirus-infected HeLa cells examined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (4.Urzaniqui A. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4729-4735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using purified enzymes, it has been demonstrated that poliovirus 3Cpro cleaves transcription factors TFIIIC and TFIID (the TATA-binding protein) (5.Clark M.E. Hämmerle T. Wimmer E. Dasgupta A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2941-2947Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 6.Clark M.E. Lieberman P.M. Berk A.J. Dasgupta A. Mol. Cell.

Virology. 1997; 239: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). 3Cpro also cleaves the microtubule-associated protein MAP-4, which is thought to contribute to the collapse of microtubules late in the infection (9.Joachims M. Etchison D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5797-5804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,10.Joachims M. Harris K.S. Etchison D. Virology. 1995; 211: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, the 3Cpro of foot-and-mouth-disease virus was shown to cleave histone H3 (11.Tesar M. Marquardt O. Virology. 1990; 174: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Action of 2Apro on host cell proteins early during infection has been studied extensively. The 2Apro of rhino-, polio-, and coxsackieviruses are responsible for the cleavage of the eucaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G, formerly p220) leading to shut-off of host cell protein synthesis (12.Etchison D. Fout S. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 634-638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Kräusslich H.G. Nicklin M.J. Toyoda H. Etchison D. Wimmer E. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 19200-19203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage by 2Apro of these viruses occurs at the identical amino acid sequence of eIF4G. It results in separation of the N-terminal domain of eIF4G, which binds the cap-binding protein eIF4E, from the C-terminal region, which binds eIF4A, eIF3, and hence the 40 S ribosomal complex (for review, see Ref. 15.Morley S.J. Curtis P.S. Pain V.M. RNA. 1997; 3: 1085-1104PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence, cellular cap-dependent initiation is inhibited. Translation of uncapped viral RNA, however, remains intact and is even stimulated as viral protein synthesis is initiated internally at the internal ribosome entry segment (IRES) (16.Jackson R.J. Howell M.T. Kaminski A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 477-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 17.Jang S.K. Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U.T. Witherell G.W. Wimmer E.

Indeed, IRES-driven translation appears stimulated under conditions in which eIF4G is cleaved (19.Ziegler E. Borman A.M. Deliat F.G. Liebig H.D. Jugovic D. Kean K.M. Skern T. Kuechler E.

Kuechler E. Skern T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7581-7588Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). During foot-and-mouth-disease virus infection, cleavage of eIF4G is mediated by the leader proteinase, which cuts at a different amino acid sequence at a site close to that of 2Apro (22.Devaney M.A. Vakharia V.N. Lloyd R.E. Ehrenfeld E. Grubman M.J. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4407-4409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Kirchweger R. Ziegler E. Lamphear B.J. Waters D. Liebig H.D. Sommergruber W. Sobrino F. Hohenadl C. Blaas D. Rhoads R.E. Skern T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5677-5684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a homologue of eIF4G has been identified and termed eIF4GII (24.Gradi A. Imataka H. Svitkin Y.V. Rom E. Raught B. Morino S. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). eIF4G has therefore been renamed eIF4GI. In HeLa cells infected with human rhinovirus serotype 14 (HRV14) or poliovirus, cleavage of eIF4GII lags behind that of eIF4GI (25.Gradi A. Svitkin Y.V. Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11089-11094Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Cleavage of both eIF4GI and eIF4GII is required for complete inhibition of cap-dependent cellular translation (26.Svitkin Y.V. Gradi A. Imataka H. Morino S. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3467-3472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another cellular target of 2Apro is the 70-kDa poly(A)-binding protein (PABP). In HeLa cells infected with coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), cleavage of PABP starts at a time when cleavage of eIF4GI has been completed (27.Kerekatte V. Keiper B.D. Badorff C. Cai A.L. Knowlton K.U. Rhoads R.E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 709-717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PABP is also specifically degraded during poliovirus infection and can be cleaved in vitro by CVB3 2Apro and by both 2Apro and 3Cpro of poliovirus (28.Joachims M. Van Breugel P.C. Lloyd R.E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 718-727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that 2Apro of CVB4 cleaves dystrophin of heart muscle myocytes in vitro. Cleavage was also found in the heart of mice infected with CVB3 (29.Badorff C. Lee G.H. Lamphear B. Martone M.E. Campbell K.P. Rhoads R.E. Knowlton K.U. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). This is proposed to lead to the disruption of the cytoskeleton of heart muscle myocytes by disconnecting actin filaments from the membrane-bound dystrophin. In this paper, we describe the identification of cytokeratin 8 (K8) as a target of proteolytic cleavage in HeLa cells infected with human rhinovirus serotype 2 (HRV2). This cleavage is also observed in cytoplasmic extracts incubated with highly purified 2Aprofrom HRV2 or from CVB4. Scission with both proteinases occurs at the same site in the head domain of K8 at a distance of 14 amino acids from the N terminus. Compared with proteolysis of the eIF4G homologues, K8 is cleaved late in the infection cycle. Other intermediate filament proteins such as K18 and vimentin remain uncleaved upon HRV2 infection. In this context, it is important to emphasize that the N-terminal domain of K18, the dimerization partner of K8, is cleaved during adenovirus infection, whereas K8 is not affected by the adenoviral proteinase (30.Chen P.H. Ornelles D.A. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage of K18 has been shown to result in dramatic changes of cell morphology, leading to the cytopathic effect of adenovirus infection. Since K8 and K18 are involved in pair formation during filament assembly, cleavage within the N-terminal region of K8 by 2Apro of HRV2 might similarly contribute to changes in the cytoskeletal network late in HRV2 infection and in this way facilitate virus release from the infected cell. HeLa cells, strain Ohio (ATCC CCL2.2) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Infection of HeLa cells and preparation of HRV2 was carried out as described (31.Skern T. Sommergruber W. Blaas D. Pieler C. Kuechler E. Virology. 1984; 136: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). All manipulations were performed at 4 °C. 8 × 107 HeLa cells grown in four 15-cm Petri dishes were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.5 mmCaCl2 and 1.5 mm MgCl2 and once with phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+. The monolayer was scraped off, taken up in phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged at 300 × gfor 5 min. The pellet was washed with 2 ml of homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4) and centrifuged again. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of homogenization buffer using a 1-ml pipette tip and were lysed by passing through a 22-gauge needle attached to a syringe several times. Disruption of cells was monitored by phase-contrast microscopy. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 ×g in a Beckman TLA100.3 rotor. The clear cytoplasmic supernatant was frozen at −70 °C or used for in vitrocleavage assays directly. Protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA system (32.Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Ohlson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18685) Google Scholar). The expression and purification of recombinant 2Apro of HRV2 and 2Apro of CVB4 was as described (21.Liebig H.D. Ziegler E. Yan R. Hartmuth K. Klump H. Kowalski H. Blaas D. Sommergruber W. Frasel L. Lamphear B. Rhoads R. Kuechler E. Skern T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7581-7588Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic extract containing 1 mg of total protein was diluted 1:1 with buffer A (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA), brought to a final concentration of 5 mm dithiothreitol, and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 20 μg of purified 2Apro of HRV2 or 2Aproof CVB4 in a total volume of 600 μl. After cleavage, proteins were precipitated with methanol/chloroform (33.Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3176) Google Scholar). High resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was carried out using the Protean II electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad). Samples containing cytoplasmic proteins were dissolved in 10 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 0.5% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol supplemented with 2% (v/v) ampholytes (Merck). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g. Isoelectric focusing was performed at 15,500 V-h in a stepwise fashion (2 h at 200 V; 3 h at 500 V; 17 h at 800 V) in 4% acrylamide (Gerbu, Germany), 0.1% piperazine diacrylamide (Bio-Rad) in 1.5 mm × 16 cm tube gels. The gel buffer contained 0.035% Nonidet P-40 and 2% ampholytes (1 volume pH 3.5–10, 1 volume pH 4–8, 2 volumes pH 5–7). Degassed 20 mm NaOH served as catholyte, and 6 mmH3PO4 served as anolyte. For SDS-PAGE, the extruded tube gels were equilibrated for 3 min in 2.9% SDS, 70 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.003% bromphenol blue and were placed on top of 1.5-mm thick 10% polyacrylamide slab gels. Gels were silver-stained (34.Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2501) Google Scholar) and scanned for evaluation. Protein identification was done by comparing molecular weight/pI data with those of previous experiments (35.Gerner C. Holzmann K. Meissner M. Gotzmann J. Grimm R. Sauermann G. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 145-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For preparative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, 1 mg of protein was loaded onto a 2.3-mm tube gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was blotted onto an Immobilon-polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.) and stained with Coomassie R-250. Spots were cut out and subjected to automated N-terminal sequencing using an ABI 476A sequencer. Peptide sequence manipulations and data base searching were performed using routines supplied by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (available on the World Wide Web) (36.Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Hochstrasser D.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 258-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). 300,000 HeLa cells per well of a six-well plate were infected with HRV2 at a multiplicity of infection of 200 plaque-forming units in minimal essential medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal calf serum and 1.5 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C. At the times indicated, the medium was removed, and the cells were lysed by the addition of 100 μl of protein sample buffer 3% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.04% bromphenol blue 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8). Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Blocking and incubation with antibodies was done using 0.2% Tween 20 and 0.2% I-block (Tropix) in phosphate-buffered saline. Staining using alkaline phosphatase reaction was as described (21.Liebig H.D. Ziegler E. Yan R. Hartmuth K. Klump H. Kowalski H. Blaas D. Sommergruber W. Frasel L. Lamphear B. Rhoads R. Kuechler E. Skern T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7581-7588Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Cleavage of peptide substrates with 2Apro of HRV2 and 2Apro of CVB4 was carried out as described (3.Sommergruber W. Ahorn H. Zöphel A. Maurer-Fogy I. Fessl F. Schnorrenberg G. Liebig H.D. Blaas D.

The relative cleavage efficiency (V max/K m)relvalue was calculated as described (37.Pallai P.V. Burkhardt F. Skoog M. Schreiner K. Bax P. Cohen K.A. Hansen G. Palladino D.E. Harris K.S. Nicklin M.J.

Rychlik W. Etchison D. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23226-23231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was supplied by Dr. R. Rhoads (Louisiana State University, Shreveport, LA). Rabbit anti-eIF4GII serum was supplied by Drs. A. Gradi and N. Sonenberg (McGill University, Montreal, Canada) (24.Gradi A. Imataka H. Svitkin Y.V. Rom E. Raught B. Morino S. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). A polyclonal rabbit anti-HRV2 2Apro serum was generated by injecting insoluble material of a 2Apro preparation following standard methods. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against cytokeratins were M20 (anti-K8), Cy-90 (anti-K18), and 8.13 (anti-K1, -K5, -K6, -K7, -K8, -K10, and -K11) from Sigma. Mouse monoclonal anti-vimentin (V9) was from Dako. Secondary antibodies were alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig and anti-mouse Ig (Sigma), respectively. In order to identify cellular proteins that are cleaved by 2Apro of HRV2, an in vitro cleavage system was used. Cytoplasmic HeLa cell extracts were incubated with purified recombinant 2Apro. A control sample lacking the proteinase was incubated in parallel. The enzymatic activity of 2Apro was monitored by cleavage of eIF4GI on SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. eIF4GI was completely cleaved after 2 h of incubation at 37 °C under these conditions (data not shown). At this point, total protein was precipitated and subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis. After silver staining, the two-dimensional protein pattern of the 2Apro-treated extract was compared with that of the untreated sample. As expected, no gross change in the two-dimensional pattern was observed in extracts incubated with 2Apro, indicating that most cytoplasmic proteins are refractory to this proteinase. This is in agreement with the high degree of cleavage specificity of 2Apro of HRV2 observed in previous studies (2.Sommergruber W. Ahorn H. Klump H. Seipelt J. Zoephel A. Fessl F. Krystek E. Blaas D. Kuechler E. Liebig H.D. Skern T. Virology. 1994; 198: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 3.Sommergruber W. Ahorn H. Zöphel A. Maurer-Fogy I. Fessl F. Schnorrenberg G. Liebig H.D. Blaas D. Kuechler E. Skern T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22639-22644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, upon close inspection of the pattern, certain specific changes were noted when comparing the sample incubated with 2Apro with the control sample (2Apro has a molecular mass of 16.2 kDa and migrates out of the gel under these conditions). Fig.1 shows a selected region of a typical gel pattern. An arrow denotes a prominent new spot in the 2Apro-treated sample corresponding to a polypeptide of a molecular mass of about 52 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.3. This new species obviously represents the cleavage product of a cellular protein. This result was reproducibly obtained in four independent 2Apro cleavage experiments. To identify the corresponding polypeptide, 2Apro-treated extract was subjected to preparative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, blotted onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The spot marked in Fig. 1 was cut out and sequenced as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The resulting N-terminal peptide sequence XPRAFSSRSY was compared with the Swiss-Prot database and was unambiguously identified as corresponding to amino acids 16–24 of human cytokeratin 8 (accession no. P05787), a member of the intermediate filament proteins. Since this sequence was generated by N-terminal sequencing, it should represent the P′ part of the 2Apro cleavage site of the corresponding protein (the nomenclature Pn-P1↓P1′-Pn′ of substrate is that of Schechter and Berger (39.Schechter I. Berger A. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3371-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), with the scissile bond lying between P1 and P1′). Indeed, the derived cleavage site of K8 is VSTS↓GPRAFSSRSY, resembling the known consensus cleavage site of 2Apro of HRV2, which is (L/I)xTx↓GP (x designates amino acids that are not critical for specificity) (2.Sommergruber W. Ahorn H. Klump H. Seipelt J. Zoephel A. Fessl F. Krystek E. Blaas D. Kuechler E. Liebig H.D. Skern T. Virology. 1994; 198: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 3.Sommergruber W. Ahorn H. Zöphel A. Maurer-Fogy I. Fessl F. Schnorrenberg G. Liebig H.D. Blaas D. Kuechler E. Skern T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22639-22644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same experiment was performed using 2Apro of CVB4. At the corresponding position marked in Fig. 1, an identical spot appeared upon incubation with the CVB4 proteinase. This spot was again blotted and cut out. The resulting N-terminal sequence (GPRAFS) identified the corresponding protein as K8 and clearly showed that in vitro2Apro of CVB4 cleaves K8 at the identical site as 2Apro of HRV2. To assess whether K8 is also cleaved in vivo, HeLa cells were infected with HRV2 and harvested at different times from 1 to 10 h postinfection. Cells were lysed in the presence of SDS, and extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blots of these samples obtained with antibodies against eIF4GI, eIF4GII, K8, K18, vimentin, and 2Apro of HRV2, respectively, are shown in Fig.2. Under these conditions, eIF4GI and eIF4GII are cleaved completely at 4 h postinfection (Fig. 2,A and B). There is no discernible difference in the rate of cleavage of the two proteins. The cleavage of K8 starts at 6 h after infection and continues up to 10 h, when approximately 50% of K8 is cleaved (Fig. 2 C). This corresponds to the time frame between the onset of the cytopathic effect, when the infected cells start to round up, and the final stage, when cells detach and lyse, releasing virus into the medium. By 10 h, a large percentage of the cells is already lysed, resulting in the progressive loss of intracellular proteins (data not shown). Cleavage of K8 (molecular mass of 53.5 kDa) by 2Apro removes 14 amino acids of the head domain, resulting in a cleavage product with a calculated molecular mass of 51.9 kDa, which agrees with the size of the band obtained in the Western blot. As a control, the same blots were probed with antibodies against K18 (Fig. 2 D) and the intermediate filament protein vimentin (Fig. 2 E). These proteins were clearly not cleaved by 2Apro during infection. Similarly, a control employing antibody 8.13, which is capable of recognizing K1, K5, K6, K7, K8, K10, and K11, indicated cleavage of only K8 (data not shown). Fig. 2 F shows the amount of 2Apro produced during infection. At 6 h after infection, a clear band is visible, representing about 20 ng of proteinase as judged from comparison with 2Apro-spiked cellular extracts in Western blotting (data not shown). Thus, in contrast to cleavage of eIF4GI and eIF4GII, which starts at an early time when 2Apro could not even be detected by our anti-2Apro antibody, cleavage of the cytokeratin K8 commences at a later point when a high amount of 2Apro has accumulated in the infected cell. Obviously, the translation initiation factors eIF4GI and eIF4GII, which are the targets for the shut-off of host cell protein synthesis, are much more susceptible to 2Apro than K8, which is a component of the cytoskeletal network. Due to the limited resolution of the two-dimensional gel electrophoretic system, no spot corresponding to the uncleaved K8 could be unambiguously identified in the protein pattern. In order to quantify the extent of in vitro cleavage of K8 by 2Apro and to correlate it with the time course of eIF4GI cleavage, SDS-PAGE of 2Apro digests of cell extracts was performed, followed by Western blotting with anti-K8 antibody. Fig.3 shows the kinetics of the cleavage reaction using 60 μg of HeLa cell cytoplasmic extract and 500 ng of purified 2Apro of HRV2 in a total volume of 60 μl. Cleavage of K8 starts at 4 h of incubation. When the amount of 2Apro was raised to 2 μg, most of the K8 was processed after 24 h of incubation. This cleavage was specific for 2Apro, since a 24-h incubation with buffer alone did not lead to degradation of K8. Again, controls using antibodies against K18, K7, or vimentin did not show any cleavage of these proteins (data not shown). As seen in Fig. 3 B, cleavage of eIF4GI is visible already at 5 min of incubation, leading to a total cleavage of eIF4GI after 1 h. The order of in vitro cleavages thus resembles that observed in the HRV2-infected cells. It is noteworthy that after a 24-h incubation with the high amount of 2Apro, two of the primary cleavage products of eIF4GI are further processed and appear to co-migrate with the fastest running species. This has been observed previously (23.Kirchweger R. Ziegler E. Lamphear B.J. Waters D. Liebig H.D. Sommergruber W. Sobrino F. Hohenadl C. Blaas D. Rhoads R.E. Skern T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5677-5684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar digestion experiments were also carried out with 2Apro of CVB4. Previous studies have shown that both 2Apro of HRV2 and CVB4 cleave eIF4GI at the identical site of the amino acid sequence (14.Lamphear B.J. Yan R.Q. Yang F. Waters D. Liebig H.D. Klump H. Kuechler E. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19200-19203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to compare the two proteinases with respect to their cleavage activity for K8, HeLa cell extracts were incubated with purified 2Apro of HRV2 and 2Apro of CVB4, respectively. Indeed, both 2Aproof HRV2 and 2Apro of CVB4 were found to produce the same size K8 cleavage product as indicated by SDS-PAGE (Fig.4). N-terminal sequencing of the K8 fragment (see above) clearly showed that in fact both proteinases use the same cleavage site on K8. In order to determine whether the difference in cleavage efficiency between eIF4GI and K8 is defined by the amino acid sequence at the cleavage site, synthetic peptides were employed as substrates for 2Apro of HRV2 and for 2Apro of CVB4. The peptides used are summarized in Table I. Peptide eIF4GI (termed p220-1 in Ref. 2.Sommergruber W. Ahorn H. Klump H. Seipelt J. Zoephel A. Fessl F. Krystek E. Blaas D. Kuechler E. Liebig H.D. Skern T. Virology. 1994; 198: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) spans the 2Aprocleavage site of human eIF4GI. This peptide was taken as a reference in competition experiments. The PABP peptide represents the amino acid sequence of the cleavage site of PABP for 2Apro of CVB3 (28.Joachims M. Van Breugel P.C. Lloyd R.E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 718-727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (see Table I). The K8 peptide corresponds to the cleavage site of K8 as determined in this paper. Peptides K8 and PABP were used in competition experiments against the eIF4GI peptide as the reference substrate. Fig.5 shows the results. The efficiency of cleavage by both proteinases drops from the eIF4GI peptide ((V max/K m)rel = 1.0) to K8 (0.76 for 2Apro of HRV2, 0.54 for 2Apro of CVB4), whereas the PABP peptide is hardly cleaved under these conditions (<0.03 for both 2Apro of HRV2 and 2Apro of CVB4). Subtle differences in substrate specificities between 2Apro of HRV2 and 2Aproof CVB4 are observed, but the order of cleavage rates is the same for both enzymes. Thus, the peptide corresponding to the cleavage site of K8 is processed rather efficiently, although not as rapidly as that corresponding to the cleavage site of eIF4GI. In the life cycle of picornaviruses, a well ordered sequence of cleavages of viral and cellular proteins occurs. The hierarchy of cleavages is responsible for consecutive processing of the viral protein precursors as well as for the pleiotropic effects on the host cell, e.g. the reduction of cellular transcription and the shut-off of host cell protein synthesis. In previous studies of poliovirus infection of HeLa cells, it has been demonstrated by two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis that only nine acidic and five basic cellular proteins were degrade"

Following internalization into epithelial cells, Shigella mediate actin polymerization at one pole of the bacterium by exploiting various host cell functions through which the bacteria gain a propulsive force and move in the host cell cytosol (1Bernardini M.L.

Upon contact of the motile bacterium with the inner surface of the cell plasma membrane, a long membranous protrusion (filopodium) appears behind the bacterium, which is endocytosed by the neighboring cells, resulting in the bacterium being surrounded by a double membrane (2Kadurugamuwa J.L. Rohde M. Wehland J. Timmis K.N. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 3463-3471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Shigella then disrupts the membranes and escapes into the new host cytoplasm to multiply again. Thus, the ability ofShigella to elicit actin assembly in mammalian cells is crucial for spreading among colonic epithelial cells (3Goldberg M.B. Sansonetti P.J. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4941-4946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of intracellular Shigella flexneri to evoke actin-based motility is mediated by the virG(icsA) gene product (4Makino S.

Actin polymerization mediated by VirG in mammalian cells requires various host proteins. Immunofluorescence of fixed infected cells has indicated an association of vinculin (2Kadurugamuwa J.L.

Biol. 1999; 9: 89-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) with the actin tail from motile S. flexneri. N-WASP and Arp2/3 complex have been indicated to play a key role in initiating actin polymerization (14Bi E. Zigmond S.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R160-R163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15Zigmond S.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R654-R657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the vicinity of the bacterial surface, a ternary complex composed of VirG, N-WASP, Arp2/3 complex is thought to be formed, where the Arp2/3 complex activated by N-WASP mediates actin nucleation with the aid of other host proteins (16Egile C. Loisel T.P. Laurent V. Li R. Pantaloni D. Sansonetti P.J. Carlier M.-F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1319-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Based on the in vitro motility of N-WASP-coated, VirG-expressing Escherichia coli, Loisel et al. concluded that actin, Arp2/3 complex, actin depolymerizing factor/cofilin, and capping protein are sufficient to promote bacterial motility (17Loisel T.P. Boujemaa R. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Nature. 1999; 401: 613-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). In subsequent reconstitution experiments, they also indicated that profilin and α-actinin promoted the rate of movement of E. coli-expressing VirG (IcsA), but neither of the proteins are essential (17Loisel T.P. Boujemaa R. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Nature. 1999; 401: 613-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). N-WASP is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, including colon (18Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). N-WASP possess several distinctive domains: a pleckstrin homology domain that binds phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), a GTPase-binding domain that binds Cdc42, a proline-rich (P) region that binds SH3 domains as well as profilin (19Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6516-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), a G-actin-binding verprolin homology (V) domain, an actin-depolymerizing protein cofilin homology (C) domain, and finally a C-terminal acidic (A) domain that binds Arp2/3 complex (20Miki H. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). N-WASP is a critical target for filopodium formation downstream of Cdc42 (21Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) and can be bound by profilin, required for rapid actin polymerization (19Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6516-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Activation of N-WASP by Cdc42 unmasks the VCA region (22Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar), which in turn leads to direct interaction with and activation of Arp2/3 complex, thus mediating actin nucleation (22Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). Profilin, originally identified as a G-actin sequestering protein (23Carlsson L. Nystrom L.E. Sundkvist I. Markey F. Lindberg U. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 115: 465-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), has been indicated to be variously involved in modulating actin dynamism. In vitro, profilin can accelerate either actin assembly or the sequestering of actin depending on the presence of other actin binding proteins and on the state of the barbed ends of F-actin. Profilin accelerates the polymerization of actin from the G-actin pool at the free barbed ends of the actin filaments. Profilin also catalyzes the exchange of ADP to actin-bound ATP to promote actin assembly from the G-actin pool (24Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Machesky L.M. Doberstein S.K. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). On the other hand, when the barbed ends of the F-actin filaments are capped by proteins, such as capping protein, profilin acts as an actin sequestering factor that accelerate the depolymerization of F-actin or the inhibition of actin assembly. Profilin can interact with various host components such as G-actin, PI(4,5)P2 (25Lassing I. Lindberg U. Nature. 1985; 314: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), poly-l-proline (26Tanaka M. Shibata H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and proteins with proline-rich sequences such as N-WASP (19Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6516-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), VASP (27Reinhard M. Giehl K. Abel K. Haffner C. Jarchau T. Hoppe V. Jockusch B.M. Walter U. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1583-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), MENA (28Gertler F.B. Niebuhr K. Reinhard M. Wehland J. Soriano P. Cell. 1996; 87: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), p140mDia (29Watanabe N. Madaule P. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Kakizuka A. Saito Y. Nakao K. Jockusch B.M. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3044-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar), and Arp2/3 complex (30Machesky L.M. Atkinson S.J. Ampe C. Vandekerckhove J. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Profilin exists in two isoforms in mammals, profilins I and II, and their distributions vary among tissues, including host species (31Honoré B. Madsen P. Andersen A.H. Leffers H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 32Lambrechts A. Van Damme J. Goethals M. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the affinity of each isoform for the ligand proteins varies; in vitro, profilin I has a higher affinity for N-WASP (K d = 60 nm) than does profilin II (K d = 400 nm) (19Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6516-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Although different functions for profilins I and II have been indicated, the biological significance of the profilin isoforms still remains obscure. The VirG protein of S. flexneri interacts directly with N-WASP for actin-based motility, which leads to the formation of long filopodium (12Suzuki T. Miki H. Takenawa T. Sasakawa C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2767-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Suetsugu et al. (19Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6516-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) reported that the interaction of profilin I with the P-region of N-WASP was involved in rapid actin polymerization in filopodium formation, suggesting that binding of profilin to the P-region of N-WASP plays a functional role in filopodium extension and probably the elongation of actin tail generated from motile Shigella. However, H133S-mutated profilin that was unable to bind to poly-l-proline was shown to enhance the rate of movement of E. coli-expressing VirG in profilin-depleted cell extracts to the exact same extent as bovine profilin, suggesting that the interaction of profilin with poly-l-proline sequences, including N-WASP, is not involved in the enhancement of actin-based bacterial motility (16Egile C. Loisel T.P. Laurent V. Li R. Pantaloni D. Sansonetti P.J. Carlier M.-F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1319-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). In this context, we wished to clarify the role of profilin I in the VirG·N-WASP-mediated Shigella motility in mammalian cells. The present study provides evidence that profilin I is an important host component for sustaining high speed Shigellamovements within the primary infected host cells and into the adjacent cells and that the functional interactions of profilin I with N-WASP and G-actin are both involved in the actin-based bacterial motility in mammalian cells. The S. flexneri 2a YSH6000 and Listeria monocytogenes serotype 1/2a EGD strains have been described previously (33Sasakawa C. Kamata K. Sakai T. Murayama Y. Makino S. Yoshikawa M. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 470-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli MC1061 ompT::Km carrying pD10-1 was also described previously (6Suzuki T. Saga S. Sasakawa C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21878-21885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). All strains were grown in brain-heart infusion broth (Difco) at 37 °C. HeLa cells were maintained in minimal essential medium (Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Sigma). Caco-2 cells were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 0.1 mmnon-essential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.). COS-7 cells and MDCK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% FCS. Sf9 insect cells used for baculovirus expression were cultured in Sf-900 II SFM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% FCS at 27 °C with vigorous shaking. The anti-N-WASP-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody was described previously (34Fukuoka M. Miki H. Takenawa T. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 196: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Anti-profilin I antibody was produced by immunizing rabbits with GST-profilin I. For purification of anti-profilin I antibody, the antiserum was incubated with GST-profilin II-conjugated glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads to remove the Ig fraction that reacted with GST-profilin II, then the specific antibody for profilin I was purified by affinity column chromatography. The anti-VirG-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody was described previously (35Nakata N. Tobe T. Fukuda I. Suzuki T. Komatsu K. Yoshikawa M. Sasakawa C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The anti-Myc antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-actin mouse monoclonal antibody and anti-ZO-1 rat monoclonal antibody were from Chemicon International Inc. The anti-E-cadherin mouse monoclonal antibody was from Transduction Laboratory. The secondary antibodies linked to fluorescein, peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody, and peroxidase-conjugated protein A were from Sigma. The secondary antibody linked to Cy5 was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Rhodamine-labeled phalloidin was from Molecular Probes Inc. The GST-VirG α-domain fusion protein (GST-α1) constructed using pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was obtained as reported previously (6Suzuki T. Saga S. Sasakawa C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21878-21885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). VirG without GST was obtained from GST fusion protein by cleavage with thrombin (Sigma) as described previously (12Suzuki T. Miki H. Takenawa T. Sasakawa C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2767-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The histidine 133 to serine-substituted (H133S) profilin was generated from pGEX-2T-profilin I using a Unique Site Elimination mutagenesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Expression and purification of GST-profilins (wild-type, histidine 119 to glutamic acid-substituted (H119E) mutant and H133S mutant profilin I) were carried out as described previously (19Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6516-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Profilins without GST were obtained from GST-profilins by thrombin digestion as described previously (36Self A.J. Hall A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Recombinant baculovirus expressing rat N-WASP was prepared by using the BAC-TO-BAC expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.) (20Miki H. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The construction of Δp mutant N-WASP (lacking amino acids 276–401) was carried out as follows; the cDNA coding for the N-terminal (nucleotides 1–825) region of Δp mutant N-WASP cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using a plasmid encoding full-length N-WASP on pBluescript (Stratagene) as a template. The C terminus region (nucleotides 1206–1518) was obtained from full-length N-WASP on pBluescript by digestion with PstI andEcoRI to delete the DNA fragment coding nucleotides 1–1205. These fragments were ligated through PstI sites in the polymerase chain reaction primer. The resulting cDNAs were ligated to pFASTBAC1 plasmid (Life Technologies, Inc.) for baculovirus expression. Purification of N-WASP proteins from cell lysates of infected Sf9 cells was performed as described previously (12Suzuki T. Miki H. Takenawa T. Sasakawa C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2767-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The plasmid containing pEF-BOS-myc-profilin I was constructed as described (19Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6516-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The cDNAs for H119E mutant, H133S mutant, or wild-type profilin I were cloned into pEGFP-C1 plasmid (CLONTECH) for expression of green fluorescence protein (GFP)-tagged profilins in cultivated cells. The constructs of full-length or Δp mutant of N-WASP on pcDL-SRα were described previously (19Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6516-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Recombinant plasmids for transfection were prepared from E. coli using a plasmid Mini Kit (Qiagen). A total of 7 × 105 COS-7 cells was mixed with each purified plasmid (20 μg) and transfected by electroporation. The cells were reseeded and cultured for 48 h before bacterial infection. Cells were seeded on coverslips and infected withS. flexneri or L. monocytogenes as described previously (12Suzuki T. Miki H. Takenawa T. Sasakawa C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2767-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, the coverslips were permeabilized and blocked. Immunofluorescence staining was performed by incubation with anti-N-WASP or anti-Myc antibodies. FITC-conjugated secondary antibody was used to visualize Myc, CyDye-conjugated secondary antibody was used to visualize N-WASP, and rhodamine-phalloidin was used to visualize F-actin. To avoid the bleed-through of the signals, each fluorescence image was collected sequentially by a single channel excitation using a MicroRadiance confocal scanning system equipped with image processing software (LaserSharp Radianceplus version 3.2, Bio-Rad). Accumulation of F-actin around the intracellular bacteria was defined as areas where the intensity was higher than an arbitrary threshold of 80 estimated in non-infected cells using LaserSharp Radianceplus. COS-7 transfectants were reseeded in 35-mm glass-base dishes (Mat Tek Corp.) and cultured for 48 h before bacterial infection. Infection with S. flexneri YSH6000 was carried out as described above. At 1–2 h after infection, movement of S. flexneri was observed with an Axiovert 135 microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a SenSys 1400 CCD camera (Roper Scientific) in a chamber maintained at 37 °C with a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The GFP-overexpressing cells were observed in fluorescence, and the bacteria were observed in phase-contrast mode. The bacterial movements in GFP-overexpressing cells were recorded as time-lapse images, and velocity was analyzed using IPLab Spectrum software (Signal Analytics Corp.). The non-motile bacteria were omitted from the records. Differences in migration velocities were analyzed using the unpaired Student's ttest. Recombinant GST-human profilin I or GST alone immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads was incubated with 0.4 μm full-length or Δp mutant of recombinant N-WASP in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (TBS-TX) at 4 °C for 1 h. Samples were washed three times in TBS-TX and subsequently incubated with 0.4 μm VirG (α1) at 4 °C for 1 h. After another wash, samples were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-VirG or anti-N-WASP antibodies. COS-7 transfectants of full-length or Δp mutant (Δp) of N-WASP on pcDL-SRα plasmid or pcDL-SRα plasmid alone (vector) were grown in 100-mm dishes and lysed in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer as described previously (12Suzuki T. Miki H. Takenawa T. Sasakawa C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2767-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). For GST-α1 pull-down assay, the cell lysates were incubated with recombinant human profilin I (1 mm) and GST-α1 beads overnight at 4 °C. Samples were washed four times in radioimmune precipitation buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-N-WASP and anti-profilin I antibodies. Meiotically arrested cytoplasmic extracts of Xenopus laevis eggs were prepared as described previously (37Theriot J.A. Rosenblatt J. Portnoy D.A. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 505-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). G-actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle as described (38Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified G-actin was covalently labeled with tetramethylrhodamine iodoacetamide (Molecular Probes) as an actin tail tracer. Depletion of N-WASP from Xenopus egg extracts using anti-N-WASP antibody was carried out as described previously (12Suzuki T. Miki H. Takenawa T. Sasakawa C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2767-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Poly-l-proline peptides (Sigma) were conjugated with CNBr-activated Sepharose FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (39Lindberg U. Schutt C.E. Hellsten E. Tjäder A.-C. Hult T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 967: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). For control beads, the N-terminal-activated residues of CNBr-activated Sepharose FF beads were blocked by incubation with blocking buffer (0.1 m glycine, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). A 20-μl volume of beads was washed twice with 1 ml of XB (100 mm KCl, 50 mmsucrose, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.7) and incubated with 30 μl of extract for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed by centrifugation and treated as the poly-l-proline-depleted extract. Aliquots of the pellets and supernatant were analyzed by Western blotting. Motility assay was carried out as described (40Theriot J.A. Fung D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) using a microscope equipped with a CCD camera. The bacterial movement and fluorescence intensity during a 10- to 60-min period were recorded as time-lapse images and analyzed using IPLab Spectrum software (Signal Analytics Corp.). Total fluorescence intensity was determined by multiplying the average pixel intensity by the pixel area. The fluorescence intensity value of the actin tail was calculated by subtraction of the intensity of a background area from that of the selected area. The illumination level of the observation was in the range of 10–2000 counts/pixel in which the CCD camera responds linearly. Transfection of pEGFP-C1 plasmid containing profilin I (or its mutants) or pcDL-SRα plasmid containing N-WASP (or its mutant was carried out by electroporation, and cell clones were isolated based on resistance to geneticin. The expression levels of profilin and N-WASP in stable transformants were examined by Western blot analysis using the whole cell lysates. For localization of actin filaments, GFP-tagged proteins, N-WASP, ZO-1, and E-cadherin, immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described above. MDCK cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates and incubated for 2 days at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Each well was infected with S. flexneri YSH6000 at a multiplicity of infection of 10. After 4 h, cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 μg/ml gentamicin, and 60 μg/ml kanamycin. At 3 days post-infection, the average size of plaques on cells was measured by a phase-contrast microscope equipped with a CCD camera using the IPLab Spectrum software. To investigate the association of profilin with the actin tail of intracellular S. flexneri, we constructed COS-7 transfectants overexpressing Myc-tagged human profilin I. A cDNA encoding Myc-tagged human profilin I was cloned into pEF-BOS vector, and the resulting plasmid (pEF-BOS-myc-profilin I) was transfected into COS-7 cells. The Myc-tagged protein localized to sites of actin-cytoskeletal reorganization (data not shown). The transfectants were then infected with a wild-type S. flexneri strain (YSH6000), and the localization of Myc-profilin I in the COS-7 transfectants was examined at 2 h post-infection by double immunostaining. As shown in Fig.1, Myc-profilin I was incorporated into the front of and throughout the actin tail generated by intracellular bacterium. Similar results were obtained by single staining of Myc-profilin I or double immunostaining of Myc-profilin I and F-actin in HeLa and Caco-2 cells (data not shown). To investigate whether the association of profilin with intracellular Shigella plays a functional role in bacterial motility, COS-7 cells overexpressing GFP-profilin I H119E or H133S mutants were infected by S. flexneri YSH6000 and examined for the effect on bacterial motility. The H119E mutant, possessing a histidine 119 to glutamate substitution, was unable to bind to G-actin but not to other ligands such as p140mDia, gephyrin, MENA, N-WASP, and VASP (19Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6516-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), whereas the H133S mutant, containing a histidine 133 to serine substitution, was unable to interact with proteins possessing proline-rich sequences (41Björkegren-Sjögren C. Korenbaum E. Nordberg P. Lindberg U. Karlsson R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), including N-WASP (data not shown). Immunoblotting with anti-profilin I antibody confirmed that each mutant GFP-profilin I was expressed at a much higher level in the transfectants than the native endogenous profilin I (data not shown). The distribution of GFP-profilin in the COS-7 transfectants was similar to that of the Myc-tagged profilin in COS-7 cells (data not shown). The transfectants were then infected with S. flexneri YSH6000, and the motility rate was assayed at 1–2 h after infection using fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig.2, overexpression of profilin I"
https://openalex.org/W2041690893,"Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) is reported to have an essential function in stress-induced apoptosis although the physiological function of ASM in receptor-triggered apoptosis is unknown. Here, we delineate a pivotal role for ASM in CD95-triggered apoptosis of peripheral lymphocytes or hepatocytes in vivo. We employed intravenous injection of anti-CD4 antibodies or phytohemagglutinin that was previously shown to result in apoptosis of peripheral blood lymphocytes or hepatocytes via the endogenous CD95/CD95 ligand system. Our results demonstrate a high susceptibility in normal mice whereas ASM knock-out mice fail to immunodeplete T cells or develop autoimmune-like hepatitis. Likewise, ASM-deficient mice or hepatocytes and splenocytes ex vivo manifest resistance to anti-CD95 treatment. These results provide in vivo evidence for an important physiological function of ASM in CD95-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1980437429,"Induction of homosynaptic long term depression (LTD) in the CA1 field of the hippocampus is thought to require activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, an elevation of postsynaptic Ca2+ levels, and a subsequent increase in phosphatase activity. To investigate the spatial and temporal changes in protein phosphatase activity following LTD induction, we determined the in situ phosphorylation state of a pre- (GAP-43/B-50) and postsynaptic (RC3) protein kinase C substrate during N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-dependent LTD in the CA1 field of rat hippocampal slices. We show that LTD is associated with a transient (<30 min) and D-AP5-sensitive reduction in GAP-43/B-50 and RC3 phosphorylation and that LTD is prevented by the phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and cyclosporin A. Our data provide strong evidence for a transient increase in pre- and postsynaptic phosphatase activity during LTD. Since the in situ phosphorylation of the calmodulin-binding proteins GAP-43/B-50 and RC3 changes during both LTD and long term potentiation, these proteins may form part of the link between the Ca2+ signal and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent processes implicated in long term potentiation and LTD.

Our data provide strong evidence for a transient increase in pre- and postsynaptic phosphatase activity during LTD. Since the in situ phosphorylation of the calmodulin-binding proteins GAP-43/B-50 and RC3 changes during both LTD and long term potentiation, these proteins may form part of the link between the Ca2+ signal and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent processes implicated in long term potentiation and LTD. long term potentiation long term depression protein kinase C phosphatase field excitatory postsynaptic potentials N-methyl-d-aspartate artificial cerebrospinal fluid calmodulin α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole Several forms of activity-dependent plasticity can be induced in the Schaffer collateral CA1 synapses of the hippocampus, including long term potentiation (LTP)1 and long term depression (LTD) (1Bliss T.V.

In CA1, the major forms of LTP and LTD depend on activation of NMDA receptors and a subsequent elevation of the intracellular Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+] i) (4Yang S.N. Tang Y.G. Zucker R.S. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 81: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that specific properties of the Ca2+ signal (magnitude and temporal structure) determine the direction of the synaptic change (5Cummings J. Mulkey R. Nicoll R. Malenka R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 825-833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 6Artola A. Singer W.

During LTP, a large rise in [Ca2+] i presumably activates protein kinases such as calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and/or PKC, whereas during LTD a small rise in [Ca2+] i favors an activation of protein phosphatases (8Lisman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3055-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar).The involvement of kinases and, notably, PKC in LTP has been shown in several ways (3Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Science. 1999; 285: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar, 9Roberson E.D. English J.D. Sweatt J.D. Learn.

Direct evidence for an involvement of phosphatases (PPases) in LTD is, however, less abundant. Pharmacological studies have shown that inhibitors of PPase 1, PPase 2A, and PPase 2B, applied intra- or extracellularly block the induction of LTD (12Mulkey R. Herron C.E. Malenka R.C. Science. 1993; 261: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 13Mulkey R. Endo S. Shenolikar S. Malenka R.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). In addition to this effect on LTD induction, there have been contradictory results on the effect of PPase inhibitors on basic synaptic transmission. Figurov et al. (14Figurov A. Boddeke H. Muller D. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) report that calyculin A, in a concentration of 1 μm, induced a potentiation of the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) of 40%. In addition, it has been shown that calyculin A increased synaptic transmission in an activity-dependent manner (15Herron C.E. Malenka R.C. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6013-6020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, no effect on synaptic transmission in the hippocampus and visual cortex have been reported by others (12Mulkey R. Herron C.E. Malenka R.C. Science. 1993; 261: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 16Kirkwood A. Bear M. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3404-3412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the contradictory pharmacological data and the fact that it cannot be ruled out that the blocking effect of the PPase inhibitors on LTD induction was due to modulation of NMDA receptor function, we used another approach to investigate the role of PPases in LTD. We monitored substrate phosphorylation in hippocampal slices labeled with inorganic phosphate after the induction of LTD, a method we have exploited successfully in LTP (17Gianotti C. Nunzi M. Gispen W. Corradetti R. Neuron. 1992; 8: 843-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 18Ramakers G.M. De Graan P.N. Urban I.J. Kraay D. Tang T. Pasinelli P. Oestreicher A.B. Gispen W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13892-13898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).The phosphoproteins of which the in situ phosphorylation state was monitored were GAP-43/B-50 (also known as F1, neuromodulin) and RC3 (also known as neurogranin, BICKS). GAP-43/B-50 is a nervous tissue-specific protein that is highly expressed in neurons during development and nerve regeneration and has been implicated in neurite outgrowth, long term potentiation, neuronal signal transduction, and neurotransmitter release. In mature, non-damaged nervous tissue GAP-43/B-50 is expressed in most neurons, but at lower levels; expression levels are highest in human associative brain areas and rat hippocampal and olfactory areas. In mature neurons, GAP-43/B-50 is predominantly found in presynaptic plasma membranes and not in dendrites. RC3 is a neuron-specific PKC substrate, mostly expressed in forebrain neurons during postnatal development and maturity and in hippocampus predominantly localized in dendritic spines (19Baudier J.

Binding to CaM stabilizes the amphiphilic α-helix within RC3 and GAP-43/B-50 only when Ca2+ is absent (28Gerendasy D. Herron S. Jennings P. Sutcliffe J. J. Biol.

Purified, PKC-phosphorylated RC3 and GAP-43/B-50 can be dephosphorylated by purified PPase 1, PPase 2A, and PPase 2B (29Hens J. Oestreicher A. De Wit M. Marquart A. Gispen W. De Graan P. J.

Biophys. 1995; 316: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).To test the involvement of pre- and postsynaptic phosphatases in LTD, we have examined changes in GAP-43/B-50 and RC3 phosphorylation at different times after the induction of LTD in the Schaffer collateral CA1 pathway. We show that both GAP-43/B-50 and RC3 phosphorylation are transiently decreased shortly after the induction of LTD, a reduction that is not observed when LTD induction is blocked by D-AP5. In parallel experiments we showed that inhibitors of PPases potently inhibit the induction of LTD. These data provide strong evidence for activation of both pre- and postsynaptic phosphatases immediately after the induction of LTD.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESHippocampal slices (450 μm) were prepared as described before (18Ramakers G.M. De Graan P.N. Urban I.J. Kraay D. Tang T. Pasinelli P. Oestreicher A.B. Gispen W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13892-13898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Slices were stored in phosphate-free artificial cerebrospinal fluid (phosphate-free ACSF; 124 mm NaCl, 4.5 mmKCl, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 10 mm glucose, 20 mm NaHCO3, and 2.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2) until the start of the experiment.For electrophysiological recordings three slices were transferred to a recording chamber and superfused (1 ml/min) for at least 60 min with gassed phosphate-free ACSF at 30 °C. fEPSPs were recorded in the radial layer of CA1 field in response to orthodromic stimulation as described before (18Ramakers G.M. De Graan P.N. Urban I.J. Kraay D. Tang T. Pasinelli P. Oestreicher A.B. Gispen W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13892-13898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In all three slices the maximal fEPSP was determined first. Only slices in which the maximal fEPSP was bigger than 1 mV were selected. Two slices were randomly chosen to be used for electrophysiological recordings. Stimulation intensity was adjusted to evoke half-maximal responses, and this intensity was kept constant throughout the experiment. Thirty min after placement of stimulation and recording electrodes, the superfusion medium was changed to ACSF containing 100 μCi/ml [32Pi]orthophosphate, and after 90 min, base-line recordings of fEPSPs were started (0.05 Hz, 30 min). Subsequently one slice received a low frequency train of stimuli (1 Hz, 15 min) at test intensity, and recordings were continued for another 10, 30, 60, or 120 min. The other stimulated slice did not receive the 1-Hz stimulation, and the third slice served as an unstimulated control. In some experiments slices were treated with 50 μm D-AP5 (Cambridge Research Biochemicals, Norwich, UK), 1 μm okadaic acid (Anawa, Wangen, Switzerland), or 1 μm cyclosporin A (gift from Dr. H. Boddeke, Sandoz AG, Basel, Switzerland) 10 min before the 1-Hz stimulation was applied or with 1 mm chelerythrine (Sigma) 45 min after the 1-Hz stimulation. At the end of the experiments, all three slices were removed from the recording chamber, washed, and homogenized (see below). Evoked fEPSPs were recorded using a conventional AC-coupled amplifier, and data were digitized using pCLAMP (Axon Instruments) software. Data were analyzed using the same software, and the initial slope of the fEPSPs was calculated. For graphical presentation, the data are expressed as percentages of the average of the base-line slope of the fEPSPs.After the electrophysiological recordings had ended, the slices were rapidly washed twice in 2 ml of ice-old H2O containing 100 mm NaF, 1.2 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA and homogenized in 100 μl of H2O containing 100 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, and 5 mm EGTA. Of the total homogenate, 60 μl was added to 40 μl of stop-mix solution containing (final concentration) 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol (v/v), 5% β-mercaptoethanol (v/v), 0.001% bromphenol blue, and after boiling for 10 min, samples were stored at −20 °C. The remainder of the homogenate was used to determine protein content (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar) with BSA as a standard. The degree of GAP-43/B-50 and RC3 phosphorylation was determined using quantitative immunoprecipitation as described earlier (18Ramakers G.M. De Graan P.N. Urban I.J. Kraay D. Tang T. Pasinelli P. Oestreicher A.B. Gispen W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13892-13898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 32Dekker L. De Graan P. De Wit M. Hens J. Gispen W. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1645-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, for GAP-43/B-50 immunoprecipitation, 10 μg of the protein homogenate was incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibody 9527 (1:200 final dilution), and for RC3 immunoprecipitation, 0.33 μg of protein homogenate was incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibody 8420 (1:100 final dilution). Antigen complexes were precipitated with Pansorbin (Calbiochem) and solubilized, and immunoprecipitates were separated using 11% (GAP-43/B-50) or 15% (RC3) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 32P incorporation into proteins was detected using a Fuji BAS1000 imaging system (Raytest, Germany) and quantified using TINA analysis software. The total 32P incorporation into proteins was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation as described previously, and32P incorporation into GAP-43/B-50 and RC3 was normalized accordingly (18Ramakers G.M. De Graan P.N. Urban I.J. Kraay D. Tang T. Pasinelli P. Oestreicher A.B. Gispen W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13892-13898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis were carried out using a Student's t test for paired or unpaired samples.RESULTSIn the present experiments we monitored the phosphorylation state of GAP-43/B-50 and RC3 in 32P-labeled hippocampal slices from young rats (less than 2 weeks old) at different times after the induction of LTD. Fig. 1 shows that prolonged (15 min) low frequency (1 Hz) stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals induced a robust and long-lasting decrease in the slope of the fEPSP, showing that LTD can be induced in 32P-labeled slices. Ten minutes after the 1-Hz stimulation was stopped, the slope of the fEPSP was reduced to 57.6 ± 4.8% (n = 6), and this reduction in the slope of the fEPSP remained at 30 min (58.0 ± 7.8%, n = 6), 60 min (50.1 ± 4.6%, n = 6), and 120 min (38.1 ± 2.3%). The normally stimulated slices, placed in the same recording chamber, did not show any run-down in synaptic responses (95.3 ± 3.7%, 107.2 ± 4.1%, 90.0 ± 5.4%, 98.8 ± 6.5% at 10, 30, 60 and 120 min after the LTD slice received the 1-Hz stimulation). The competitive NMDA receptor antagonist D-AP5 completely blocked the induction of LTD (data not shown). Therefore, we can conclude that the stimulation paradigm used in the present study induces a reproducible, robust, and NMDA receptor-dependent LTD in the CA1 field of 32P-labeled hippocampal slices.To examine the effect of LTD on the in situ GAP-43/B-50 and RC3 phosphorylation, GAP-43/B-50 and RC3 phosphorylation was determined 10 min after LTD induction. At this time point there is a decrease in the in situ phosphorylation of both GAP-43/B-50 and RC3 (Fig. 2). GAP-43/B-50 phosphorylation is reduced to 61.8 ± 8.4% (Fig. 2 A, n = 6), and RC3 phosphorylation is reduced to 69.9 ± 6.8% (Fig.2 B, n = 6). When LTD induction is blocked by 50 μm D-AP5, there is no change in the phosphorylation of both GAP-43/B-50 (96.4 ± 4.3%, n = 5) and RC3 (95.9 ± 4.9%, n = 5) compared with the normal stimulated slices (97.4 ± 8.3% and 107.8 ± 12.6% for GAP-43/B-50 and RC3, respectively). Typical examples of immunoprecipitates of a control slice, a slice expressing LTD for 10 min, and a slice only receiving normal stimulation are shown as insets in Fig. 2, A and C. Ten minutes after LTD induction there is a significant correlation between the decrease in the in situ GAP-43/B-50 and RC3 phosphorylation and the decrease in the slope of the fEPSP (correlation coefficient = 0.97, p < 0.001, n = 6 for GAP-43/B-50 and correlation coefficient = 0.89, p < 0.001,n = 6 for RC3; Fig. 2, B and D). We also performed experiments on slices from older animals (4 to 6 weeks) in which the likelihood of LTD induction is reduced (33Dudek S.M. Bear M.F. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2910-2918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prolonged (15 min) low frequency (1 Hz) stimulation failed to induce significant LTD in these slices; the slope of the fEPSP returned to 93.8 ± 7.4% (n = 4) of the base-line value within 10 min after the end of the low frequency stimulation. In these slices we determined the phosphorylation of GAP-43/B-50 and RC3. There was no reduction of GAP-43/B-50 (101.2 ± 4.3%, n= 4) and RC3 (98.5 ± 6.3%, n = 4) phosphorylation in these slices. The decrease in GAP-43/B-50 and RC3 phosphorylation seems to be specific, since the in situphosphorylation of another well defined PKC substrate, the myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate, MARCKS (34Blackshear P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), does not change after the induction to LTD (35Ramakers G.M. McNamara R.K. Lenox R.H. De Graan P.N. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2175-2183PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 2Reduced in situphosphorylation of GAP-43/B-50 and RC3 10 min after LTD induction. A and C, 10 min after LTD induction, the 32P-labeled hippocampal slices were removed from the recording chamber, washed, and homogenized, and the in situphosphorylation of GAP-43/B-50 (A) and RC3 (C) was determined using a quantitative immunoprecipitation. GAP-43/B-50 and RC3 phosphorylation is significantly reduced in slices expressing LTD for 10 min (LTD) compared with the unstimulated control (CON; p ≤ 0.05, n = 6). GAP-43/B-50 and RC3 phosphorylation was not changed in slices receiving only normal stimulation (normal stimulated slice (NSS); not significant, n = 6) or slices in which LTD induction had been blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonist D-AP5 (LTD/AP5; not significant, n = 5). Typical examples of phosphoimaging analysis of immunoprecipitated, 32P-labeled GAP-43/B-50 and RC3 are shown as insets. B and D, the decrease in the individual slices in situ phosphorylation of GAP-43/B-50 (B) and RC3 (D) was plotted against the decrease in the slope of the fEPSP in each individual slice (data from Fig. 1 A). The decrease in the phosphorylation of GAP-43/B-50 and RC3 was strongly and significantly correlated with the change in the evoked fEPSP (correlation coefficient = 0.97,p = 0.001, n = 6 for GAP-43/B-50 and correlation coefficient = 0.89, p ≤ 0.001,n = 6 for RC3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To study the temporal relationship between the decrease in phosphorylation of pre- and postsynaptic PKC substrates, experiments were stopped at different times after low frequency stimulation (Fig.3). The in situphosphorylation state of postsynaptic protein RC3 is significantly reduced 10 min after LTD induction (see also Fig. 2) and is back to control levels at 30 min after LTD induction (98.3 ± 10.0%) and remains unaltered at 60 and 120 min (100.2 ± 11.6% and 92.4 ± 8.3%, n = 6 and 5, respectively). At the presynaptic site, GAP-43/B-50 phosphorylation, which is decreased at 10 min after LTD induction (see also Fig. 2), is still reduced at 30 min (74.0 ± 4.9%, n = 6). One hour after LTP induction GAP-43/B-50 phosphorylation is increased (132.7 ± 8.8%, n = 6) and returns to control levels 120 min after LTD induction (102.3 ± 6.7%,n = 5).Figure 3Temporal profile of changes in the in situ RC3 and GAP-43/B-50 phosphorylation. Experiments were stopped at different times after LTD induction (Fig. 1), and thein situ phosphorylation of GAP-43/B-50 (filled circles) and RC3 (open circles) was determined using a quantitative immunoprecipitation. Ten minutes after LTD induction, both RC3 and GAP-43/B-50 were significantly reduced (p ≤ 0.05). RC3 phosphorylation was back to control levels again at 30 min and remained unchanged. GAP-43/B-50 phosphorylation was still slightly reduced at 30 min (non-significant), but at 60 min, there was a significant increase (p ≤ 0.05), and at 120 min, GAP-43/B-50 phosphorylation was not different from control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To investigate the involvement of phosphatases in the transient decrease in RC3 and GAP-43/B-50 phosphorylation, we determined the effect of two different phosphatase inhibitors known to increase basal RC3 and GAP-43/B-50 phosphorylation in hippocampal slices on LTD induction (Fig. 4). The addition of 1 μm okadaic acid (Fig. 4 A) or 1 μm cyclosporin A (Fig. 4 B) starting 10 min before and ending 5 min after the 15-min 1-Hz stimulation paradigm completely blocked the induction of LTD. The average slope of the fEPSP 60 min after the 1-Hz stimulation in the presence of okadaic acid or cyclosporin A was 100.5 ± 5.4% and 96.0 ± 4.8%, respectively (n = 5), whereas the 1-Hz stimulation in phosphate-free ACSF resulted in a long-lasting decrease in the slope of the fEPSP (see Fig. 1).Figure 4LTD induction is prevented by the PPase inhibitors okadaic acid and cyclosporin A. The involvement of PPases in the induction of LTD was investigated by applying the potent inhibitors okadaic acid (1 μm (A)) and cyclosporin A (1 μm (B)) to the phosphate-free ACSF. The duration of application of the PPase inhibitors is indicated by the black bars, and the LTD induction protocol is indicated by the shaded bar. The fEPSPs in slices perfused with either okadaic acid or cyclosporin A (filled circles) did not change after the LTD induction protocol, showing that LTD has been blocked. The LTD induction protocol induced a robust and strong depression of the fEPSP in slices perfused with normal phosphate-free ACSF (open circles).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The increase in GAP-43/B-50 1 h after LTD induction (see Fig. 3) could be caused by either decreased PPase activity or increased kinase activity. Since it is at present not possible to pharmacologically activate phosphatases, we decided to assess if increased PKC activity was causing the increase in GAP-43/B-50 phosphorylation. We treated slices with chelerythrine, a specific PKC inhibitor known to block a phorbol ester-induced increase in GAP-43/B-50 phosphorylation (18Ramakers G.M. De Graan P.N. Urban I.J. Kraay D. Tang T. Pasinelli P. Oestreicher A.B. Gispen W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13892-13898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The addition of 1 μm chelerythrine to the phosphate-free ACSF starting 30 min after LTD induction for 30 min did not affect the expression of LTD as compared with untreated control slices (Fig.5). The slope of the fEPSP was still depressed to 43.7 ± 8.1% (n = 5) of the base line in chelerythrine-treated slices as compared with the depression to 38.1 ± 2.3% in control slices (see Fig. 1).Figure 5LTD expression does not require increased PKC activity. The possibility that LTD expression requires increased PKC activity was investigated by applying the specific PKC inhibitor chelerythrine (1 μm, open bar) to slices 30 min after LTD had been induced (black bar). Chelerythrine had no apparent effect on reduction of the slope of the fEPSP; 120 min after LTD induction there was no significant difference between slices that had been perfused with chelerythrine (filled circles) and controls (open circles).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this study we show that LTD induction in the CA1 field of the hippocampus is accompanied by a transient decrease in GAP-43/B-50 and RC3 phosphorylation. This reduction in phosphorylation is firmly linked to LTD, because (i) it is NMDA receptor-dependent, (ii) it is significantly correlated with the degree of LTD, (iii) it is not elicited by test stimulation, (iv) it is not observed in slices from older animals in which low frequency stimulation fails to induce LTD, and (v) it is specific for certain PKC substrates since no effect was found on myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS) phosphorylation (35Ramakers G.M. McNamara R.K. Lenox R.H. De Graan P.N. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2175-2183PubMed Google Scholar). The transient reduction in the phosphorylation of GAP-43/B-50 and RC3 we find after LTD induction most likely reflects an increased phosphatase activity. Our pharmacological studies confirm the involvement of phosphatases (PPase 1, 2A, and 2B) in LTD, as already indicated by others, since okadaic acid and cyclosporin A block LTD. However, these pharmacological studies do not address the temporal and spatial aspects of PPase involvement in LTD. Our findings clearly show an NMDA receptor-dependent decrease in the in situ phosphorylation state of two identified pre- and postsynaptic phosphoproteins, providing independent evidence for an increased pre- and postsynaptic PPase activity following NMDA receptor activation. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the decrease in GAP-43/B-50 and RC3 phosphorylation is caused by reduced kinase activity. Application of the kinase inhibitor H7 or the specific PKC inhibitor chelerythrine to naive slices mimics and occludes the maintenance of homosynaptic LTD in the CA1 field of the hippocampus. In addition, it was shown that LTD is accompanied with a reduction in the levels of protein kinase Mζ (the constitutively active catalytic fragment of PKCζ) and the PKC isoforms PKCγ and PKCε in homogenates (mixed pre- and postsynaptic compartments) 30 min after LTD induction and a concomitant reduction in constitutive PKC activity (36Hrabetova S. Sacktor T. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5324-5333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At present it is not known whether GAP-43/B-50 or RC3 are substrates for these forms of PKC.Repetitive low frequency stimulation (15 min, 1 Hz) of the afferent fibers in the CA1 field of the hippocampus of young rats induced a robust and long-lasting decrease in synaptic transmission, which is comparable to that found by others (37Dudek S. Bear M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4363-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). The stimulation and recording electrodes were separated as far as possible to guarantee the biggest possible area in which LTD was induced. The reduction in in situ GAP-43/B-50 and RC3 phosphorylation we observed probably is an underestimation of that in individual affected synapses, since our experimental approach averages phosphorylation in the whole slice. Although in the hippocampus GAP-43/B-50 and RC3 are found in high concentrations in the CA1 area, they are also present in other parts of the hippocampus (21Represa A. Deloulme J.C. Sensenbrenner M.

https://openalex.org/W1984020741,"We have previously described thrombin (Th)-protease nexin 1 (PN1) inhibitory complex binding to cell surface heparins and subsequent low density lipid receptor-related protein (LRP)-mediated internalization. Our present studies examine the catabolism of urinary plasminogen activator (uPA)-PN1 inhibitory complexes, which, unlike Th·PN1 complexes, bind almost exclusively through the uPA receptor. In addition, the binding site in PN1 required for the LRP-mediated internalization of Th·PN1 complexes is not required for the LRP-mediated internalization of uPA·PN1 complexes. Thus, the protease moiety of the complex partially determines the mechanistic route of entry. Because cell surface heparins are only minimally involved in the binding and internalization of uPA·PN1 complexes, we then predicted that complexes between uPA and the heparin binding-deficient PN1 variant, PN1(K7E), should be catabolized at the same rate as complexes formed with native PN1. Surprisingly, the uPA·PN1(K7E) complexes were degraded at only a fraction of the rate of native complexes. Internalization studies revealed that both uPA·PN1(K7E) and native uPA·PN1 complexes were initially internalized at the same rate, but uPA·PN1(K7E) complexes were rapidly retro-endocytosed in an intact form. By examining the pH dependence of complex binding in the range of 4.0–7.0, it was determined that the uPA·PN1 inhibitory complexes must specifically bind to endosomal heparins at pH 5.5 to be retained and sorted to lysosomes. These studies are the first to document a role for heparins in the catabolism of SERPIN-protease complexes at a point further in the pathway than cell surface binding, and this role may extend to other heparin-binding LRP-internalized ligands.

Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). PN1 is a potent inhibitor of thrombin (Th) and urinary plasminogen activator (uPA) (2.Scott R.W.

Although the precise molecular nature of the PN1-protease inhibitory complexes under native conditions remains controversial, it is most likely a 1:1 covalently linked stoichiometric complex or is at least very stable under physiological conditions (3.Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. Day D.E. Berkenpas M.B. Verhamme I.M. Kvassman J.-O. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25309-25312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 4.Shieh B.H.

Complexes formed between PN1 and all of the proteases that it inhibits are stable to SDS-PAGE after boiling and reduction (6.Baker J.B. Low D.A. Simmer R.L. Cunningham D.D. Cell. 1980; 21: 37-45Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the presence of heparin, PN1 is a faster thrombin inhibitor than heparin-activated antithrombin III (ATIII), the most physiologically important inhibitor of Th in plasma (2.Scott R.W. Bergman B.L. Bajpai A. Hersh R.T. Rodriguez H. Jones B.N. Barreda C. Watts S. Baker J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7029-7034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, because of the physiological distribution of PN1, which is restricted primarily to tissues with the exception of a low abundance form in platelets (7.Gronke R.S. Bergman B.L. Baker J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3030-3036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PN1 probably inactivates extravasated thrombin and does not participate directly in the fibrinolytic system. Because of the limited range of specificity of PN1 and the nature of the proteases it inhibits, PN1 has been implicated in neurite outgrowth (8.Guenther J. Nick H. Monard D. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1963-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), the protection of neuronal cells from proteolytic damage and thrombin-induced apoptosis in brain injury (9.Cunningham D.D.

An integral aspect of PN1 physiology is the catabolism of PN1-protease inhibitory complexes, because the only way to ensure the removal of protease activity is through endocytosis and intracellular degradation. In addition, the endocytosis of inhibitory complexes may act as a feedback signaling mechanism to regulate inhibitor synthesis and secretion (12.Perlmutter D.H. Travis J. Punsal P.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1774-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Recent progress has revealed that the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) is responsible for the cellular internalization of PN1-protease (12.Perlmutter D.H. Travis J. Punsal P.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1774-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13.Knauer M.F. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17886-17892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of Th·PN1 complexes, LRP binding is regulated by the exposure of a cryptic binding site that is rendered LRP binding-competent only when PN1 is in complex with a protease (16.Knauer D.J. Thompson J.A. Cunningham D.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 117: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Using a synthetic peptide library, this binding site has been narrowed to a 12-amino acid sequence, 47PHDNIVISPHGI58 (13.Knauer M.F. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12261-12264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This is a predicted transition sequence between the A helix and strand 6 of sheet B in PN1, based on the projected structure of PN1 using α-1-antitrypsin coordinates as a model (1.Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). More recent studies using an antibody directed against this sequence, as well as site-directed variants of PN1 with point, isosteric amino acid substitutions in this sequence, have confirmed this region as a structural determinant required for the LRP-mediated internalization of Th·PN1 complexes (17.Knauer M.F. Crisp R.J. Kridel S.J. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 275-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the role of this sequence is limited to complex internalization by the LRP. The majority of the cellular binding of Th·PN1 complexes, which plays a substantial role in the overall rate of catabolism of the complexes, is mediated by the heparin-binding site in PN1 and its interactions with cell surface heparins or heparan sulfate proteoglycans (14.Knauer M.F. Kridel S.J. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29039-29045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The catabolism of uPA·PN1 complexes is also mediated by the LRP but reportedly proceeds through a pathway that utilizes the uPA receptor (uPAR) (15.Conese M. Olson D. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17886-17892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Conese M. Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Cremona O. Pardi R. Andreasen P.A. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. Blasi F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1609-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The apparent mechanism is a sequential series of events that is initiated by the binding of uPA·PN1 complexes to uPAR, followed by LRP-mediated internalization as a ternary complex (18.Conese M. Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Cremona O. Pardi R. Andreasen P.A. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. Blasi F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1609-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Because the association constant of uPA·PN1 complexes for the uPAR is much greater than the association constant of the uPA·PN1 complexes for heparin, this raises the question of the role of the heparin-binding site in PN1 in the catabolism of uPA·PN1 complexes. It also raises the question of the role of the LRP-binding site in PN1 in the catabolism of uPA·PN1 complexes. These questions have particular biological relevance for three reasons. First, the catabolic route of PN1-protease complexes may be determined by the identity of the protease present in the inhibitory complex. If indeed two different pathways exist, the pathway used may affect the cellular response to these inhibitory complexes and may augment the up- or down-regulation of inhibitor synthesis and secretion (12.Perlmutter D.H. Travis J. Punsal P.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1774-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Second, uPAR occupied by uPA has been shown to localize to the leading edge of migrating smooth muscle cells in a wound-healing model. The uPA-uPAR complexes at the cell surface activate the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, and removal of the complexes by LRP-mediated internalization deactivates the pathway (19.Bochaton-Piallat M.L. Gabbiani G. Pepper M.S. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1086-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, PN1 has the potential to regulate this signaling pathway, depending on the entry route of uPA·PN1 complexes into the cell. Third, little is known about the clearance mechanism of SERPIN-protease inhibitory complexes in general. Based on several reports from one group, it was initially believed that all SERPIN-enzyme complexes were cleared by a common receptor, referred to as the SERPIN-enzyme complex receptor or SEC receptor (20.Joslin G. Krause J.E. Hershey A.D. Adams S.P. Fallon R.J. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21897-21902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Perlmutter D.H. Glover G.I. Rivetna M. Schasteen C.S. Fallon R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3753-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This receptor was thought to recognize a common structural motif in the carboxyl-terminal region of all of the SERPINs. This original hypothesis has not held true (22.Maekawa H. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18604-18609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and there are now several published reports showing that the LRP acts as the endocytosis receptor for nearly all of the SERPINs examined (13.Knauer M.F. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12261-12264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14.Knauer M.F. Kridel S.J. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). It has also been determined that the structural site responsible for binding to LRP does not reside within the carboxyl-terminal domain (13.Knauer M.F. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12261-12264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17.Knauer M.F. Crisp R.J. Kridel S.J. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 275-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the present studies we have investigated the catabolic pathways of Th·PN1 complexes and uPA·PN1 complexes using a polyclonal antibody raised against the LRP-binding site in PN1 (13.Knauer M.F. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12261-12264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17.Knauer M.F. Crisp R.J. Kridel S.J. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 275-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and a heparin binding-deficient variant of PN1 that forms inhibitory complexes with Th and uPA but is unable to bind to cell surface heparins (14.Knauer M.F. Kridel S.J. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29039-29045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The results of these studies demonstrate that the catabolism of uPA·PN1 complexes and Th·PN1 complexes do indeed proceed through two different pathways that converge at the point of the LRP. The cell surface binding of uPA·PN1 complexes is heparin-independent and internalization does not involve the LRP-binding site in PN1. In contrast, the cell surface binding of Th·PN1 complexes is mediated by heparins, and the internalization of Th·PN1 complexes is dependent on the LRP-binding site in PN1. We have also made the unexpected observation that although the heparin-binding site in PN1 is not involved in the cell surface-binding of uPA·PN1 complexes, it is apparently required for the endosomal retention of uPA·PN1 complexes after endocytosis. Cell culture media and reagents were purchased from Irvine Scientific and JRH Scientific. Cell culture plastics were from Corning. Thrombin, 3,000 NIH units/mg, and high molecular weight urokinase (uPA), 80,000 IU/mg, were purchased from Calbiochem. Na125Iodine was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Porcine mucosal heparin was from Calbiochem. Soybean trypsin inhibitor and monensin were from Sigma. Protein G-Sepharose beads, high trap heparin-Sepharose and Cibacron blue-Sepharose were all from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other common reagents were from Sigma, Calbiochem, or Irvine Scientific. Peptide synthesis (AE78 and Pro47–Ile58-Cys) and antiserum generation in rabbits, using Pro47–Ile58-Cys coupled to ovalbumin, have been previously described (25.Smith J.W. Dey N. Knauer D.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8950-8957Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The LRP agonist, receptor-associated protein (RAP), was expressed as a fusion protein (RAP-GST) consisting of an amino-terminal glutathioneS-transferase sequence followed by the rat RAP sequence. The fusion protein was affinity purified on a glutathione-Sepharose column as described (26.Orlando R.A. Kerjaschki D. Kurihara H. Biemesderfer D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6698-6702Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The generation, purification and characterization of the K7E variant of PN1 that shows decreased affinity for heparin has been described elsewhere (14.Knauer M.F. Kridel S.J. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J.

Human foreskin fibroblasts (HF) were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously (13.Knauer M.F. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12261-12264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14.Knauer M.F. Kridel S.J. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol.

When the cells reached confluence, they were changed to serum free medium and used 48 h later. Purified samples of PN1 and PN1(K7E) were titrated with active thrombin to determine the percentage of activity. 30 ng of thrombin were added to various amounts of PN1 or PN1(K7E), which were then diluted to a final total volume of 80 μl in PBS, pH 7.2, containing 0.1% BSA. At the end of a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were chilled on ice for 15 min, followed by the addition of a 200-fold molar excess of Chromozym-Th. The reactions were returned to room temperature for 30 min to allow for color development as a measure of residual thrombin activity. Absorbance measurements were taken at 405 nm to quantify color development. 125I-Thrombin (16.Knauer D.J. Thompson J.A. Cunningham D.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 117: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and125I-uPA (27.Donovan F.M. Vaughan P.J. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17199-17205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared as described previously using the Iodogen method. Specific activities for 125I-thrombin ranged from 8,000 to 15,000 cpm/ng of protein. Specific activities for the 125I-uPA ranged from 6,000 to 15,000 cpm/ng of protein. Complexes were formed by combining a known amount of 125I-Thrombin or125I-uPA with a 3-fold molar excess of either PN1 or PN1(K7E) as determined by the active site titration described above. Reactions were carried out in 300 μl of PBS. At the end of a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were diluted with binding medium or buffer to the appropriate concentration, typically 100–200 ng/ml. After dilution, 5-μl aliquots were removed and added to 15 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels (28.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207129) Google Scholar). 2-μl aliquots of the complexes were also collected and quantified by γ counting to ensure that equal concentrations of complexes were added to cells. Binding and internalization experiments were done in binding medium that consisted of serum-free, bicarbonate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 20 nmHepes buffer, pH 7.2, and 0.1% BSA. When binding assays were done at 4 °C, all reagents were prechilled, and the cells were placed on ice in a 4 °C cold room. Competing ligands were added simultaneously with radiolabeled ligands. Concentrations of ligands are indicated in the text and figure legends. At the completion of the incubations, unbound ligand was removed, and the cells were washed rapidly four times with 1 ml of PBS, and finally lysed with 1 ml of 10% SDS. Radioactivity in the samples was quantified by γ counting. Nonspecific binding, which accounts for approximately 25% of total binding, was determined by incubating three wells with a 400-fold excess of unlabeled complexes. Degradation assays were done by monitoring increases in trichloroacetic acid nonprecipitable radioactivity as described previously (13.Knauer M.F. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12261-12264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14.Knauer M.F. Kridel S.J. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29039-29045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Internalization/surface-associated complex assays were done in the same binding medium described above. 300-μl samples of complexes were added to triplicate wells at 37 °C. At the indicated times the cells were rapidly chilled to 4 °C and washed to remove free ligand. 1 ml of ice-cold trypsin solution in PBS (200 μg/ml) was then added to the cells on ice and allowed to proteolytically digest cell surface proteins for 10 min. The trypsinized cells were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes containing 200 μl of ice-cold soybean trypsin inhibitor at 5 mg/ml. Following centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 3 min, the supernatants and cells were quantified separately by γ counting to discriminate between cell surface-associated and internalized complexes. The trypsinization efficiency was determined to be 90% in control experiments where endocytosis was inhibited by incubation at 4 °C, and the ability of trypsin to release cell surface-bound complexes was tested. 125I-uPA·PN1 and125I-uPA·PN1(K7E) complexes were incubated with either anti-(Pro47–Ile58-Cys) IgG or with preimmune IgG overnight at 4 °C. 50 μl of a 1:1 protein G-Sepharose bead slurry in PBS was added, followed by an additional 30 min incubation at room temperature. The samples were centrifuged for 1 min in a refrigerated microcentrifuge at 10,000 × g. Following one wash with PBS, the centrifugation step was repeated, and the antigen-antibody complexes were released from the Sepharose beads by the addition of 100 μl of reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were fixed with methanol:acetic acid:water (5:1:5), and exposed to a Bio-Rad Phospho-Imager screen for 30 min. The image was developed on a Bio-Rad GS-250 Molecular Imager. 125I-uPA·PN1 and125I-uPA·PN1(K7E) complexes at a concentration of 200 ng/ml were added to 10.0-cm plates of HF cells (5 × 106 cells) in 2.5 ml of binding medium. The plates were placed on a rocker in a warm room at 37 °C and were allowed to incubate for 2 h to ensure an internalized pool of complexes. After the incubation, free complexes were removed by aspiration, and the plates were washed four times with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS. BSA-free binding medium (1.5 ml) was added back to the plates, and they were placed back on the rocker in the warm room. At the indicated times, the supernatants were removed from the cells and added to 10 ml of 12.5% trichloroacetic acid for 1 h on ice in a 4 °C cold room. The precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min, and washed once with 1 ml of ice-cold 50/50 acetone/H2O. Following a second wash with 100% acetone and air drying, the precipitates were resuspended in 75 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. To evaluate the binding of uPA·PN1 complexes to the surface of HF cells, a series of binding buffers were prepared at different pH levels using 20 mm Hepes as the starting buffer and titrating it with either HCl or NaOH. BSA was added to a final concentration of 0.1% prior to titration. Complexes were diluted into each of the buffers and incubated with the cells at 4 °C for 2 h. Binding and heparin dissociation of complexes were determined as described above. The ability to bind heparin after SERPIN-protease complex formation is unique to PN1 (29.Stone S.R. Brown-Luedi M.L. Rovelli G. Guidolin A. McGlynn E. Monard D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7731-7735Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (30.Stefansson S. Muhammad S. Cheng X.F. Battey F.D. Strickland D.K. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6358-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Other heparin-binding SERPINs (such as ATIII) lose affinity for heparin after complex formation with a protease (31.Rosenberg R.D. Damus P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6490-6505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This heparin binding capacity is an important feature of Th·PN1 complex catabolism because it provides cells with a mechanism for concentrating Th·PN1 complexes at the cell surface for subsequent internalization via the LRP (14.Knauer M.F. Kridel S.J. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29039-29045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In recent studies we have carefully characterized the role of the PN1 heparin-binding site in Th·PN1 complex catabolism, but its potential role in uPA·PN1 complex catabolism has not been previously addressed. The fact that uPA·PN1 complexes bind to the cell surface primarily through the uPAR afforded us the unique opportunity to examine any role for the heparin-binding site in the catabolic pathway separate from its role in cell surface binding. We have previously generated and characterized a heparin binding-deficient variant of PN1, designated PN1(K7E). PN1(K7E) reacts with thrombin and forms complexes in a manner indistinguishable from native PN1 and also binds to the LRP (14.Knauer M.F. Kridel S.J. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29039-29045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because this variant had not been examined for its interaction with uPA, however, its ability to form complexes with uPA was first established (Fig.1 A). Complexes of125I-uPA with either active PN1 and PN1(K7E) were prepared for addition to HF cells as described in the figure legend. Aliquots of 10 μl were removed and resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels. In the digitized image, the position of free 125I-uPA is indicated as well as the position of 125I-uPA·PN1 and125I-uPA·PN1(K7E) complexes. Importantly, the K7E variant of PN1 formed complexes with 125I-uPA as well as native PN1, and there were only trace amounts of free 125I-uPA present in both the variant and native complexes. This is an important point, because free 125I-uPA is also able to bind to the uPAR and could lead to misleading conclusions if present in high concentrations. These same radiolabeled complexes were then added to HF cells in binding medium at 4 °C to evaluate cell surface binding. At the end of a 3-h incubation at 4 °C, the HF cultures were washed to remove unbound ligand, lysed with 10% SDS and quantified by γ counting (Fig. 1 B). As shown by the control bars, nearly identical amounts (approximately 17 fmol) of variant125I-uPA·PN1(K7E) and native 125I-uPA·PN1 complexes bound to the cell surface. This contrasts to previous studies of PN1(K7E) in complex with a different target protease, thrombin (Th), where the cell surface binding of these variant complexes was shown to be 10-fold lower than native Th·PN1 complexes (14.Knauer M.F. Kridel S.J. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29039-29045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cell surface binding of the native Th·PN1 complexes was shown in the same studies to be mediated primarily by cell surface heparins, accounting for the dramatically lowered binding of the heparin binding-deficient Th·PN1(K7E) complexes. Unlike thrombin, uPA binds with high affinity to the uPAR present on the cell surface, and native uPA·PN1 complexes have been previously shown to bind via the uPAR (15.Conese M. Olson D. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17886-17892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To demonstrate that cell surface binding of our variant uPA·PN1(K7E) complexes also proceeded via high affinity binding of the uPA moiety of the complex to the uPAR, we tested the ability of a peptide that specifically binds uPAR to compete for cell surface binding. Peptide AE78, derived from the amino-terminal uPAR-binding region of uPA (32.Goodson R.J. Doyle M.V. Kaufman S.E. Rosenberg S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pyk2 as well as kinase-inactive Pyk2-K457A, was phosphorylated at tyrosine residues 402, 580, and 881 upon T cell antigen receptor cross-linking, indicating that these residues are phosphorylated by other tyrosine kinase(s). However, no tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2-Y402F was detected while more than 60% of the tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in Pyk2-Y881F. Pyk2-Y402F inhibited the activation of endogenous Pyk2. The degree of activation of both c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase but not extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase after concurrent ligation of T cell antigen receptor and CD28 was reduced by more than 50% in the clones expressing Pyk2-Y402F. Consistent with this inhibition, IL-2 production was significantly diminished in the Pyk2-Y402F-expressing clones. Furthermore, we found that Pyk2, when overexpressed, associates with Zap70 and Vav. Taken together, these findings suggest that Pyk2 is involved in the activation of T cells through its tyrosine 402."
https://openalex.org/W1967108192,"In an earlier study, the ATP10 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was shown to code for an inner membrane protein required for assembly of the F0 sector of the mitochondrial ATPase complex (Ackerman, S., and Tzagoloff, A. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 9952–9959). To gain additional insights into the function of Atp10p, we have analyzed a revertant of an atp10 null mutant that displays partial recovery of oligomycin-sensitive ATPase and of respiratory competence. The suppressor mutation in the revertant has been mapped to theOLI2 locus in mitochondrial DNA and shown to be a single base change in the C-terminal coding region of the gene. The mutation results in the substitution of a valine for an alanine at residue 249 of subunit 6 of the ATPase. The ability of the subunit 6 mutation to compensate for the absence of Atp10p implies a functional interaction between the two proteins. Such an interaction is consistent with evidence indicating that the C-terminal region with the site of the mutation and the extramembrane domain of Atp10p are both on the matrix side of the inner membrane. Subunit 6 has been purified from the parental wild type strain, from the atp10 null mutant, and from the revertant. The N-terminal sequences of the three proteins indicated that they all start at Ser11, the normal processing site of the subunit 6 precusor. Mass spectral analysis of the wild type and mutants subunit 6 failed to reveal any substantive difference of the wild type and mutant proteins when the mass of the latter was corrected for Ala → Val mutation. These data argue against a role of Atp10p in post-translational modification of subunit 6. Although post-translational modification of another ATPase subunit interacting with subunit 6 cannot be excluded, a more likely function for Atp10p is that it acts as a subunit 6 chaperone during F0 assembly.

This important constituent of the larger F1-F0 complex catalyzes vectorial transfer of protons across the inner membrane, the direction being dependent on whether the enzyme is functioning in an ATP synthetic or hydrolytic mode (1Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In bakers' yeast, three subunits of F0 are encoded in mitochondrial DNA (2Dujon B. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Life Cycle and Inheritance. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980: 505-635Google Scholar). The other F0 subunits are all products of nuclear genes. Most of the F0 subunits are required for binding and conferral of oligomycin sensitivity on the F1-ATPase (3Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1545-1551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Velours J. Spannagel C. Chaignepain S. Vaillier J. Arselin G. Graves P.V. Velours G. Camougrand N. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1998; 80: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The exception are three recently described subunits (5Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schagger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) that have been proposed to be involved in dimerization of the F1-F0 complex in the membrane. Mutations in these subunits do not appear to influence the basic ATPase activity of the complex (5Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schagger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Maintenance of functional ATPase depends not only on the expression of mitochondrially and nuclearly encoded subunits of the enzyme but also on nuclear gene products that promote essential events during ATPase assembly. Some factors such as Atp11p and Atp12p have been shown to interact with the α- and β-subunits and to render them competent to oligomerize into the F1-ATPase (6Ackerman S. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 7Wang Z.-G. Ackerman S. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1486-1493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other factors are required for transcription/translation of subunit 9 of the complex (9Payne M.J. Schweizer E. Lukins H.B. Curr. Genet. 1991; 19: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar,10Ellis T.P. Lukins H.B. Nagley P. Corner B.E. Genetics. 1999; 151: 1353-1363PubMed Google Scholar). In an earlier study we reported that the product of theATP10 gene does not affect assembly of F1 or synthesis of subunit 9 but is essential for expression of functional F0 (11Ackerman S. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9952-9959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in ATP10 resulted in a loss of oligomycin sensitivity and a more labile interaction of F1 with the membrane. Both of these properties are hallmarks of a defect in F0. Atp10p is localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane but is not a constituent of the ATPase complex. As with so many factors that have been implicated in assembly of ATPase and of respiratory chain complexes, its precise function has remained obscure. To learn more about the role of Atp10p in F0 assembly, we have extended the analysis of the atp10 null mutant and have studied an extragenic suppressor that rescues the respiratory defect of the mutant. The suppressor has been mapped to mitochondrial DNA and identified as a single amino acid substitution in the OLI2gene for subunit 6 of F0. These data suggest a functional interaction of Atp10p with subunit 6. The location of the suppressor mutation near the C-terminal region of subunit 6 argues against a role of Atp10p in processing of the subunit 6 precursor. This is also supported by the presence of mature subunit 6 in the atp10mutant. Mass spectrometric analysis of subunits 6 and 9 purified from wild type and mutants have also excluded a role of Atp10p in post-translational chemical modification of these ATPase constituents. Atp10p, therefore, is more likely to be a chaperone for subunit 6.

The second primer was complementary to sense strand from nucleotides +867 to +893 of the sequence except for two base changes to form a HindIII site. The products obtained from the synthesis were digested withBamHI and HindIII and were ligated to YEp352 (18Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A.

Mitochondria (80–250 mg) were suspended at a protein concentration of 12–18 mg/ml and extracted in 10 volumes of chloroform/methanol (1:1) by stirring the mixture at room temperature for 18 h. The organic extract was clarified by centrifugation and was washed by addition of water and chloroform (final proportion, chloroform/methanol/water, 8:4:3 v/v/v). The organic phase was dried down in rotary evaporator and dissolved in 2 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1), and proteins were precipitated by addition of 4 volumes of ether at −80 °C for 10 min. Two different methods were used to purify subunits 6 and 9. In the first method the ether precipitate was suspended in 1 ml chloroform/methanol (2:1) and chromatographed on a Primesphere 5 C4 high pressure liquid chromatography column (Phenomenex). The column was equilibrated in a solution containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in methanol/water (3:1). The column was developed over 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with linear gradient from 0 to 100% chlororoform/methanol (2:1) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Subunit 6, which eluted at 23 min, was collected and dried down under vacuum. This preparation of pure subunit 6 was used for protein sequencing. In the second method the ether precipitate was dissolved in 2 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1) and chromatographed on a 1.5 × 45-cm column of Sephadex LH60 equilibrated with chloroform/methanol/0.1m HCl (1:1:0.05) (20Bizzozero O. Besio-Moreno M. Pasquini J.M. Soto E.F. Gomez C.J. J. Chromatogr. 1982; 227: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Fractions of 2 ml were collected and checked for protein by SDS-PAGE1 on a 15% polyacrylamide gel. Fractions enriched for subunit 6 were precipitated with ether as above. Fractions containing subunit 9 were extracted with 0.5 volumes of chloroform and 0.37 volumes of water. The organic phase was used for mass determinations. The samples were used either directly or concentrated under vacuum before mixing with the matrix (1% sinapinic acid in acetonitrile containing 1% trifluoroacetic acid). Spectra were obtained with a Voyager DE-PRO (PerSeptive Biosystems). Standard methods were used for the preparation and ligation of DNA fragments and for transformation and recovery of plasmid DNA from Escherichia coli (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The method of Maxam and Gilbert was used to sequence 5′-end labeled single stranded DNA fragments (22Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 49-56Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE in the buffer system of Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). Immunodetection of proteins on Western blots was carried out with 125I-labeled protein A (24Schmidt R.J. Myers A.M. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1984; 1: 317-334PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). a W303ΔATP10, abbreviated as ΔATP10 in this text, is a haploid strain of yeast with an atp10 null allele (11Ackerman S. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9952-9959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mutant grows very poorly on nonfermentable carbon sources such as ethanol and/or glycerol. The compromised respiratory activity of mitochondria in the null mutant as well as in atp10 point mutants was previously attributed to a defect in the F0 component of the ATPase (11Ackerman S. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9952-9959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To learn more about the biochemical lesion responsible for the F0 assembly defect, spontaneous revertants of ΔATP10 were isolated. Such revertants appear frequently (104–105 reversion frequency) on medium containing ethanol and glycerol as carbon sources. Three independent revertants (10R1, 10R2, and 10R3) were chosen for further study. The generation time of the revertants in liquid medium containing glycerol was estimated to be about two times longer than the parental wild type (Table II). The revertant phenotype was found to be transmitted in a stable manner after propagation of the cells on glucose or galactose.Table IIGeneration time of wild type and mutant strains on rich glycerol mediumStrainDoubling timeminW303–1A210ΔATP10ND10R147010R233010R3410The different strains of yeast were inoculated at approximately the same densities into liquid medium containing 2% glycerol, 2% peptone, and 1% yeast extract.

Open table in a new tab The different strains of yeast were inoculated at approximately the same densities into liquid medium containing 2% glycerol, 2% peptone, and 1% yeast extract. Growth was monitored by absorbance at 600 nm. ND, not determined. The revertants were further characterized by crosses to E103, anatp10 mutant obtained by mutagenesis of the respiratory competent strain D273-10B/A1 with ethylmethane sulfonate (26Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Diploid cells issued from the cross grew on respiratory substrates with approximately the same generation time as the haploid revertant indicating that the suppressor(s) were either nuclear dominant or mitochondrial mutations. To distinguish between these two possibilities, spontaneous ρ− derivatives were isolated from each revertant and were crossed to E103. Diploid cells formed in these crosses failed to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources, indicating extragenic mutations in mitochondrial DNA. This was confirmed by segregation tests. The revertants were crossed to E103 in glucose containing medium for 6 h. Diploid cells were prototrophically selected on minimal glucose. Following 20–30 generations they were spread for single colonies on rich glucose medium, and after 2 days of growth at 30 °C were replicated on rich medium containing glycerol. Two distinct growth phenotypes were noted on the glycerol medium. In all cases 30–50% of the colonies displayed the revertant phenotype, whereas the remaining cells showed the very slow growth characteristics of the mutant. Several respiratory competent diploid cells from the first segregation were grown on glucose and tested a second time for mitotic segregation as described above. In every instance all of the segregants displayed revertant properties. The possibility that the revertant harbored a second nuclear suppressor that, together with the mitochondrial mutation, was responsible for the respiratory competent phenotype was excluded from the results of a cross of revertant 10R3 to the atp10 null mutant. Respiratory competent diploid cells produced from this cross were sporulated, and the meiotic spore progeny were analyzed by tetrad dissections. In nine complete tetrads all the spores exhibited the revertant phenotype. These data together with the results of the crosses of the ρ− derivatives of the revertants to theatp10 point mutant indicated that the suppressor is inherited as a mutation in the mitochondrial genome. The mitotic and meiotic segregation results also exclude the suppressor from being a rearrangement of mitochondrial DNA that coexists as an independently replicating ρ− genome in an otherwise ρ+background (27Muller P.P. Reif M.K. Zonghou S. Sengstag C. Mason T.L. F 0 x T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 431-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 28Dieckmann C.L. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4722-4731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mitochondrial suppressor was transferred to a wild type nuclear background by crossing 10R3 to a ρo derivative of W303-10B. The diploid cells were sporulated and Leu−meiotic progeny with the ATP10 gene were obtained (10R3/ATP10). These cells grew on glycerol as well as the wild type strain at 30 °C but were partially temperature sensitive at 37 °C (Fig. 1). The temperature-sensitive phenotype was also detected in the atp10 mutant and revertant. The normal growth of 10R3/ATP10 on glycerol at 30 °C indicates that suppressor does not affect the ATPase in cells expressing Atp10p. In earlier studies atp10 mutants were found to have normal F1-ATPase (11Ackerman S. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9952-9959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The larger F1-F0 complex, however, had altered properties, one of which was decreased oligomycin sensitivity. Assays of mitochondrial ATPase activity from different strains indicated that sensitivity to oligomycin is partially restored in the revertants (Table III). The ATPase activities in the three revertants 10R1, 10R2, and 10R3 were inhibited 25–33% by oligomycin. In the same assay the mitochondrial ATPase of the wild type was inhibited by 75%, whereas in ΔATP10, the ATPase was completely insensitive to the antibiotic. The partial restoration of oligomycin-sensitive ATPase in the revertants is consistent with the ability of the revertants to grow on respiratory substrates.Table IIIATPase activity of mutants and revertantsStrainATPaseInhibition− Oligomycin+ Oligomycinμmol/min/mg%W303–1A5.89 ± 0.071.49 ± 0.0175ΔATP103.09 ± 0.343.02 ± 0.08010R14.02 ± 0.032.99 ± 0.012510R23.79 ± 0.052.90 ± 0.122410R33.50 ± 0.202.32 ± 0.0233Mitochondria were prepared from the indicated strains grown on YPGal.

The values reported are averages of duplicate assays. The ranges of the activities are indicated. The absence of oligomycin sensitivity in the atp10 mutant has previously been ascribed to the failure of F1 to correctly interact with F0 (11Ackerman S. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9952-9959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oligomycin sensitivity observed in the revertants therefore indicated that the suppressor permits some F1 to be assembled with F0. This was confirmed by sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis of detergent extracts of wild type and mutant mitochondria. In agreement with previous results (29Tzagoloff A. Meagher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 7328-7336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), all the α- and β-subunits of F1in the wild type extract co-sedimented as part of the larger F1-F0 complex (Fig.2). This was also true of the extract from 10R3/ATP10, which contains the suppressor in the context of the wild type ATP10 gene. Even though the F1subunits also co-sedimented in the extract from the atp10mutant, their slower sedimentation indicated that they were part of the F1 oligomer but not of the F1-F0complex (29Tzagoloff A. Meagher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 7328-7336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the revertant extract, two separate peaks were observed. Approximately 30% of the α- and β-subunits sedimented as the F1-F0 complex, whereas the remainder of the subunits sedimented as the F1 oligomer (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained when the sedimentation analysis was extended to subunits 4 and d of the F0 (data not shown). In this case also, only a fraction of the F0subunits in the revertant extract co-sedimented with the F1-F0 complex. Subunits 6, 8, and 9 of the F0 sector are encoded in mitochondrial DNA (2Dujon B. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Life Cycle and Inheritance. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980: 505-635Google Scholar). These hydrophobic constituents are products of OLI2, AAP1, and OLI1, respectively. Two different approaches were used to estimate the levels of these proteins in the mutants and revertants. The chloroform/methanol extraction conditions of Michon and Velours (19Michon T. Galante M. Velours J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) were used to isolate subunits 6 and 9 from mitochondria of theapt10 null mutant ΔATP10, from the three revertants and from the parental wild type strain. The extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the proteolipids were visualized by silver staining. Quantitation of the stained gel revealed about 16 times less subunit 6 in the mutant than in the wild type extract (Fig.3). The amount of subunit 6 in the revertant extracts was significantly increased in the mutant, although it was still lower than in the wild type. It is interesting that theoli2 point mutant, which is able to grow slowly on glycerol, also has a low level of subunit 6 that can be extracted with chloroform/methanol. The decreased steady-state concentration of subunit 6 in the mutant could be because of an effect of the mutation either on synthesis or on turnover of the protein. The synthesis of the ATPase proteolipids in the different strains was estimated by in vivo labeling of the mitochondrial translation products with35SO42− in the presence of cycloheximide. Subunit 6 was found to be synthesized in all the atp10 mutants (Fig. 4), indicating that the low level of this protein in the chloroform/methanol extract of ΔATP10 mitochondria was not a consequence of a translational defect but rather of an increased turnover of the protein in the mutant. Similar results were obtained when the mitochondrial translation products were synthesized in isolated mitochondria (data not shown). The lability of subunit 6 is not unique to atp10 mutants and has also been reported in other strains that are blocked in F0 assembly because of mutations in the structural genes (31Paul M, F. Velours J. Arselin de Chateaubodeau G. Aigle M. Guerin B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 32Norais N. Prome D. Velours J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20284-20290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Significantly, subunit 6 detected in the 10R3 revertant had an altered electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 4). The slightly faster migration of subunit 6 was also discerned in the other two revertants, 10R1 and 10R2, (data not shown). The faster migration of subunit 6 from the revertant is probably due to an increased capacity of the protein to bind sodium dodecyl sulfate as a result of the C-terminal mutation (see below). To map the mitochondrial suppressor, the three revertants were treated with ethidium bromide, and the resultant ρ− derivatives were collected. The ρ− clones of each library were crossed to theatp10 mutant, and the diploid cells that formed in the crosses were tested for appearance of the suppressed phenotype. The regions of mitochondrial DNA conserved in several ρ−clones that were able to suppress the respiratory defect of theatp10 mutant were determined by physical analysis of their ρ− genomes. In each case the ρ− genomes were ascertained to contain the OLI2 gene for subunit 6 of the ATPase (17Macino G. Tzagoloff A. Cell. 1980; 20: 507-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial OLI2 gene was amplified from mitochondrial DNA of W303-1A, ΔATP10, and the three revertants 10R1, 10R2, and 10R3 were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction. The sequences of the genes cloned from the wild type strain and from the ΔATP10 null mutant were identical to the sequence of OLI2 previously reported for the respiratory competent strain D273-10B/A1 (17Macino G. Tzagoloff A. Cell. 1980; 20: 507-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The sequences of the genes obtained from the three revertants, however, showed a single identical C → T base change at nucleotide 746. The C → T transition replaces the the alanine at residue 249 near the C terminus of the protein with a valine. In view of the identical mutation in the three revertants all subsequent experiments on the revertant made use of 10R3. An alignment of the C-terminal 16 residues of subunit 6 from fungal, plant, and animal sources shows that the Ala249 is not a conserved amino acid (Table IV). It is also interesting that some fungi lack the C-terminal sequence corresponding to the region of the yeast protein with the mutation.Table IVC-terminal sequences of subunit 6 from fungal, plant, and animal sourcesS. cerevisiae241WTILT(A)SYLKDTLYLH259S. cerevisiae241WAILT(A)SYLKDAVYLH259Schizosaccharomyces pombe242FAILT(C)GFINDSLNLH257Candida parapsilosis231FSILL(S)GYIKDSVELH246Penicillium chrysogenum242FVVLA(C)SYIKDGLDLH257Neurospora crassa246FVVLT(S)GYIKDALDLH261Agaricus bitorquis241FTLLV(C)SYLKDSLNLH256Sorghum bicolor364FTILI(C)IYLNDAINLH379Chrysodidymus synuroideus239FSILI(S)MYINSAINLH254Arabidopsis thaliana241FTLLT(C)IYLNDVLEMH256Zea mays399FTILI(C)IYLNDAINLH414Rickettsia prowazekii227FTILS(C)MYLNDAINLH242Paracentrotus lividus220FTALV(H)FYLQQNV232Homo sapiens214FTLLV(S)LYLHDNT226Drosophila melanogaster212FAVLS(T)LYSSEVN224Xenopus laevis214FVLLL(S)LYLQENV226Caenorhabditis elegans189FSRLI(F)LYLNE199Some fungi such as Scleroderma hypgaeum and Gyroporus cyanescens lack the C-terminal sequence.

The residues corresponding to Ala246 are indicated by the parentheses. Subunit 6 of yeast ATPase is synthesized as a precursor with a 10-amino acid extension at the N terminus (19Michon T. Galante M. Velours J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The mature protein starts with the serine at residue 11 of the primary translation product (19Michon T. Galante M. Velours J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To determine whether subunit 6 is correctly processed in the mutant and the revertants, the protein was purified from the different strains by reverse-phase chromatography of chloroform/methanol extracts of mitochondria. No significant difference was noted in the elution times of the protein obtained from the wild type and the ΔATP10 mutant or revertant. The sequences of the first 10 residues indicated that the proteins purified from the mutant and revertant strains begin with Ser11 as did the wild type protein. This result indicates that Atp10p is not involved in processing of the precusor. Atp10p was previously found to be associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane. It was solubilized with NaBr, suggesting that it may be an extrinsic membrane protein (11Ackerman S. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9952-9959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This could not be confirmed in the present study. When submitochondrial vesicles were extracted with carbonate, the alkaline conditions failed to release Atp10p from the membrane, indicating that it is an intrinsic membrane constituent (Fig.5 A). The ability of a single amino acid substitution in the C-terminal region of subunit 6 to partially rescue the atp10 null mutant could indicate that Atp10p interacts with the C-terminal region of subunit 6. Subunit a, the E. coli homolog of mitochondrial subunit 6, has been proposed to have five transmembrane domains with its N terminus on the periplasmic and the C terminus on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane (34Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16241-16247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 35Wada T. Long J.C. Zhang D. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17353-17357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). An alignment of the E. coli and yeast subunit 6 sequences suggests a similar number of transmembrane domains in the latter protein. Moreover, based on the E. coli model (35Wada T. Long J.C. Zhang D. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17353-17357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the 17 C-terminal residues of the yeast protein, including the site of the mutation, are predicted to lie outside of the phospholipid bilayer in the matrix compartment. The topology of Atp10p was probed by testing its sensitivity to proteinase K digestion. Mitochondria and mitoplasts prepared by hypotonic swelling of mitochondria were treated with proteinase K under conditions that digest proteins exposed to the intermembrane space. Western blots disclosed that Atp10p is completely protected against proteinase K in both intact and hypotonically treated mitochondria (Fig. 5 B). Antiserum against cytochromeb2, an intermembrane marker, was used as a control. As expected, cytochrome b2 is detected in proteinase K treated and untreated mitochondria but is severely reduced in mitoplasts (Fig. 5 A). Thus, the location of the C-terminal region of subunit 6 is consistent with the topology of Atp10p, which, based on its resistance of proteinase K digestion, faces the matrix side of the inner membrane. There are two ways in which Atp10p could interact with subunit 6 during F0 assembly. The more obvious function is that Atp10p modifies subunit 6 post-translationally. As indicated above Atp10p is not involved in proteolytic removal of the presequence from the subunit 6 precursor. Other types of modifications were also excluded on the basis of mass measurement on subunit 6 isolated the wild type, the mutant, and the revertant. The apparent masses of subunit 6 from theatp10 mutant and revertant (corrected for the Ala → Val mutation) differed by less than 11 daltons from the wild type protein (Table V). This difference, which lies within the accuracy of the instrument, is too small to be due to a chemical modification. The mass of subunit 9 obtained from the same strains agreed well with the known sequence of the protein (data not shown), thereby excluding a role of Atp10p in chemical modification of subunit 9. Rather these data suggest the alternative explanation that Atp10p acts as a subunit 6-specific chaperone that may confer an assembly-competent conformation on subunit 6 or facilitate its insertion into the inner membrane. Attempts to detect a complex of Atp10p and subunit 6 by cross-linking experiments have so far failed.Table VMass determinations of subunit 6 of yeast mitochondrial ATPaseStrainApparent massNumber of DeterminationsCorrectionCorrected massW303–1A27,931.4 ± 4.85027,931.4 ± 4.8ΔATP1027,935.9 ± 4.33027,935.9 ± 4.310R327,954.2 ± 7.3328aThe experimentally determined masses of subunit 6 from the two strains containing the Ala → Val mutation were normalized to that of the wild type and atp10null mutant by subtracting 28 daltons, the mass difference between alanine and valine.

The values reported are averages with the ranges next to them. Open table in a new tab Atp10p could also be involved in modification of a neighboring subunit. In the absence of the modification, interaction with subunit 6 would be weakened, causing a defect in F0 assembly. The presence of a bulkier and more hydrophobic residue in the C-terminal region of subunit 6 might act to stabilize the protein-protein interface. Such an interaction would need to occur outside the phospholipid bilayer on the matrix side of the inner membrane. This follows from the site of the mutation in subunit 6. There is evidence for a contact of the N-terminal regions of subunits 4 and the 6 on the intermembrane space (37Spannagel C. Vaillier J. Chaignepain S. Velours J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). An interaction of the first transmembrane α helix of subunit 6 and of the transmembrane helix of subunit i has also been described (38Paumard P. Vaillier J. Napias C. Arselin G. Brethes D. Graves P.-V. Velours J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4199-4205Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). At present, however, information concerning possible interactions of the C-terminal tail of subunit 6 with other F0 or stalk constituents is lacking."

Accordingly, ligand blotting experiments revealed that bovine FGF-BP bound FGF-2. The theoretical mass of the protein predicted from the cDNA sequence is 22.5 kDa.

Signaling by members of the FGF family is dependent upon a dual-receptor system, consisting of four high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors, termed fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), and of low affinity heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) that enhances ligand presentation to the FGFRs (7.Klagsbrun M. Baird A. Cell. 1991; 67: 229-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 8.Ornitz D.M. Leder P. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1737-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Despite the ubiquitous presence of FGFs throughout the body, their interaction with the signal-transducing receptors is tightly controlled. Sequestration of FGF by the heparan sulfate-rich extracellular matrix (ECM) seems to fulfill this role by inflicting a local differential distribution of FGFs and FGFRs. Furthermore, the binding and release from ECM seem important as means of protection and optimizing the biological effect of FGF-2 (10.Saksela O. Moscatelli D. Sommer A. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 11.Dinbergs I.D. Brown L. Edelman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (22929): 29822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms have been proposed for the release of active FGFs from the ECM reservoir. The classical route is release of the growth factors upon digestion of HSPG by glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzymes or protease activity (9.Bashkin P. Doctrow S. Klagsbrun M. Svahn C.M. Folkman J.

However, recent transfection studies have revealed the existence of an alternate mode that does not require matrix degradation but instead involves an FGF-binding protein (FGF-BP). The heparin-binding protein FGF-BP is distinct from cellular receptor molecules and binds to FGF-1 and FGF-2 in a non-covalent, reversible manner. Besides decreasing the affinity or accessibility of FGF for ECM-HSPGs, FGF-BP has been shown to protect FGF-2 from degradation and preserves its mitogenic activity (16.Czubayko F. Smith R.V.

Wang H.L. Darwiche N. Harris V. Wellstein A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2671-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).

The involvement of FGF-BP in skin cancer is supported by the findings that the chemotherapeutic agent all-trans-retinoic acid reduces FGF-BP expression in SCC xenografts, inhibits their angiogenesis, and leads to a decrease of the tumor growth rate (22.Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E.

Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 179-184PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, FGF-BP mRNA expression is up-regulated by direct transcriptional mechanisms in phorbol ester-promoted skin cancer (19.Kurtz A. Wang H.L.

The significance of FGF-BP expression in tumors has also been assessed in vitro and in situ by transfection studies.

The purified form of FGF-BP is a 17-kDa heparin-binding protein (HBp17), derived from culture medium conditioned by the human epidermal carcinoma cell line A431. HBp17 binding of FGF-1 and FGF-2 can be reversed by heparin, which in turn binds a cluster of basic amino acids in the C-terminal half of the molecule (20.Wu D.Q. Kan M.K. Sato G.H. Okamoto T.

Because of its scarcity, very little information is available regarding structural features of FGF-BP so far.In bovine mammary gland the growth-promoting activity peaks in the early stage of the last trimester of gestation. Accordingly, mammary gland secretion drawn from this period is a rich source of different growth-promoting substances (26.Sandowski Y. Peri I. Gertler A. Livest. Prod. Sci. 1993; 35: 35-48Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 27.Talhouk R.S. Neiswander R.L. Scharnbacher F.L. J. Reprod.

In the present study, we report the purification and structural characterization of bovine FGF-BP recovered from bovine prepartum mammary gland secretion (BPMS). Peptide mapping, cDNA cloning, and N-terminal amino acid sequencing allowed disclosure of the primary structure of a member of the FGF-BP family for the first time.DISCUSSIONThis paper describes the purification and characterization of a novel heparin-binding protein secreted from the bovine mammary gland. Partial amino acid sequences obtained from purified material enabled isolation of a full-length cDNA from a mammary gland library and deduction of the amino acid sequence of bovine FGF-BP. The derived amino acid sequence was confirmed by peptide mapping, covering 74% of the purified protein. Glycosylation sites and disulfide bridges were also assigned (Fig. 5).Inspection of the cDNA sequence predicts that the unprocessed bovine FGF-BP is 234 residues long, which is equivalent to the human counterpart. Based on the known structural requirements it is expected that signal peptidase would cleave between residues 23 and 24 during the secretion process, resulting in Lys24 at the N terminus. Nevertheless, the predominant forms of the purified protein observed in the present study started at Gly32 and Ser52, respectively. The enzyme responsible for this processing remains to be elucidated. However, it is noteworthy that a dibasic sequence is found in the C terminus of the removed peptides (Arg30–Arg31 and Lys48-X-X-Arg51), suggesting that one or more subtilisin-like endopeptidases may be responsible for the processing (31.Barr P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). A similar phenomenon is seen in human FGF-BP, where it has been reported that the purified protein starts with Lys34 (20.Wu D.Q. Kan M.K. Sato G.H. Okamoto T. Sato J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16778-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, no dibasic sequence prior to an eventual processing site is found in the human precursor. Whether secondary modification of the N-terminal is a common phenomenon linked to FGF-BPs must await further investigations as well as elucidation of the proteases involved.Applied methods for estimating the molecular weight of the isolated FGF-BP gave different results. Based on the amino acid composition, the molecular mass of the predominant 203-residue form was calculated to 22,648 Da. Measurement by mass spectrometry estimated the molecular mass to 28,549 Da, whereas the protein migrates as a 36-kDa protein in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The discrepancy in mass between the isolated protein and the translated cDNA sequence was at least partly due to post-translational modifications. A search for glycosylation sites revealed the presence of glycans on Asn155 and Ser172, resulting in an additional mass of about 3074 Da. The collected data do not explain the remaining difference between the calculated and observed molecular weights. However, the apparently anomalous behavior of the bovine FGF-BP in SDS-polyacrylamide gels is most likely a result of the basic nature of the protein (estimated pI is 9.3) and the attached carbohydrate. The literature provides no data on glycosylation of the other FGF-BPs; however, the bovineN-linked glycosylation site has no counterpart in the predicted amino acid sequences of human and mouse FGF-BP. Although theO-glycosylated residue in the bovine protein is conserved in human and mouse FGF-BP, a prediction of the presence ofO-linked glycosylation in the two proteins is currently not possible.Contrary to the bovine homolog, human FGF-BP purified from A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells migrates notably faster in SDS-PAGE than the molecular mass prescribed by its translated cDNA sequence,i.e. 17 versus 22.7 kDa (20.Wu D.Q. Kan M.K. Sato G.H. Okamoto T. Sato J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16778-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is unclear whether the apparent molecular mass of the human FGF-BP reflected an electrophoretic artifact or is due to the lack of protein sequence per se. Considering the similarity in overall amino acid composition, charge, and hydrophobic character between the predicted human and bovine molecule, the difference in SDS-PAGE migration pattern is unexpected. Whereas protein sequencing of the purified bovine protein identifies the predicted C terminus unambiguously, this is not so for the human counterpart, and the precise position of its C-terminal is unknown. Hence, our observations support the notion by Wu and co-workers (20.Wu D.Q. Kan M.K. Sato G.H. Okamoto T. Sato J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16778-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the purified form of human FGF-BP could result from proteolytic C-terminal processing.Cleavage using a combination of trypsin and chymotrypsin allowed us to solve the organization of the disulfide bridges for bovine FGF-BP. All cysteine residues are involved in disulfide bonds, and the pattern is as follows: Cys71–Cys88, Cys97–Cys130, Cys106–Cys142, Cys198–Cys234, and Cys214–Cys222. Care was taken to reduce the probability of disulfide bond shuffling, and indeed no alternate bonding patterns were identified. No information is available regarding the three-dimensional structure or the disulfide bridge pattern of human or mouse FGF-BP, but the finding that all cysteines are positionally conserved in the three proteins suggests that they are structurally alike.The principal heparin-binding site of human FGF-BP purified from A431-conditioned medium has recently been localized to residues Arg110–Phe143 (25.Wang X.C. Chen J.H. Crab J.W. Sato J.D. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 46: 81-87PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence does not include any of the proposed consensus sequences for protein-heparin interactions (32.Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Weiler J.M. Linhardt R.J. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). However, the high content of basic amino acid clusters in this region may contribute to the binding specificity. Similar to its human counterpart, a highly positive net charge characterizes the region in the bovine FGF-BP homolog (estimated pI value of the human and bovine fragments are 10.8 and 10.9, respectively).Previously, direct physical evidence for interaction between FGF-BP and FGF-2 has been based on chromatographic methods. By using the ligand blotting technique, we confirmed that FGF-BP has a heparin-sensitive binding activity toward FGF-2. Although previous cross-linking experiments have shown that HBp17 binds FGF-1 (20.Wu D.Q. Kan M.K. Sato G.H. Okamoto T. Sato J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16778-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we were not able to confirm this in the bovine system using the ligand blotting technique nor by reproducing the cross-linking experiment (data not shown). The suggested alternate processing and/or truncation may explain the differences in the binding specificity of human HBp17 and bovine FGF-BP. Alternatively, divergence in species or applied methodology may have influenced the apparent functionality of the purified binding proteins.Previous studies have shown that high expression of FGF-BP is found in the skin and intestine of the perinatal only (19.Kurtz A. Wang H.L. Darwiche N. Harris V. Wellstein A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2671-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). On the protein level, FGF-BP has so far been detected only in epidermal and colon carcinoma cells (20.Wu D.Q. Kan M.K. Sato G.H. Okamoto T. Sato J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16778-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Wang X.C. Chen J.H. Crab J.W. Sato J.D. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 46: 81-87PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, we found that expression of FGF-BP is not restricted to perinatal and pathological conditions. A physiological role for FGF-BP in pregnant mammary gland is not known. However, it is notable that the importance of FGF-2 signaling in pregnancy-dependent lobuloalveolar development of the mammary gland recently has been reported (12.Jackson D. Bresnick J. Rosewell I.

The accessibility of purified bovine FGF-BP opens for future investigations concerning the involvement of FGF-BP in physiological and pathological processes. The fibroblast growth factor (FGF)1 family, with its prototype members FGF-1 and FGF-2, comprises structurally related heparin-binding proteins involved in a variety of biological processes including morphogenesis, angiogenesis, and tissue remodeling (1.Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 2.Friesel R.E. Maciag T.

Signaling by members of the FGF family is dependent upon a dual-receptor system, consisting of four high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors, termed fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), and of low affinity heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) that enhances ligand presentation to the FGFRs (7.Klagsbrun M. Baird A. Cell. 1991; 67: 229-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 8.Ornitz D.M. Leder P. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1737-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Despite the ubiquitous presence of FGFs throughout the body, their interaction with the signal-transducing receptors is tightly controlled. Sequestration of FGF by the heparan sulfate-rich extracellular matrix (ECM) seems to fulfill this role by inflicting a local differential distribution of FGFs and FGFRs. Furthermore, the binding and release from ECM seem important as means of protection and optimizing the biological effect of FGF-2 (10.Saksela O. Moscatelli D. Sommer A. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 11.Dinbergs I.D. Brown L. Edelman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (22929): 29822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms have been proposed for the release of active FGFs from the ECM reservoir. The classical route is release of the growth factors upon digestion of HSPG by glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzymes or protease activity (9.Bashkin P. Doctrow S. Klagsbrun M. Svahn C.M. Folkman J. Vlodavsky I. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1737-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 13.Saksela O. Rifkin D.B. J.

However, recent transfection studies have revealed the existence of an alternate mode that does not require matrix degradation but instead involves an FGF-binding protein (FGF-BP). The heparin-binding protein FGF-BP is distinct from cellular receptor molecules and binds to FGF-1 and FGF-2 in a non-covalent, reversible manner. Besides decreasing the affinity or accessibility of FGF for ECM-HSPGs, FGF-BP has been shown to protect FGF-2 from degradation and preserves its mitogenic activity (16.Czubayko F. Smith R.V. Chung H.C. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28243-28248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Czubayko F. Liaudet-Coopman E.D. Aigner A. Tuveson A.T. Berchem G.J. Wellstein A. Nat.

Chem. 1991; 266: 16778-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In rodents in situ hybridization and Northern analysis have shown that FGF-BP expression is prominent in skin and intestine during the perinatal growth (19.Kurtz A. Wang H.L. Darwiche N. Harris V. Wellstein A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2671-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The down-regulation of FGF-BP in the adults is, however, reversed in tumor samples, cell lines derived from squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), and some colon cancers (16.Czubayko F. Smith R.V. Chung H.C. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28243-28248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Wu D.Q. Kan M.K. Sato G.H. Okamoto T. Sato J.D. J. Biol.

Anim. 1996; 32: 69-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The involvement of FGF-BP in skin cancer is supported by the findings that the chemotherapeutic agent all-trans-retinoic acid reduces FGF-BP expression in SCC xenografts, inhibits their angiogenesis, and leads to a decrease of the tumor growth rate (22.Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21303-21308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,23.Liaudet-Coopman E.D. Berchem G.J. Wellstein A. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 179-184PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, FGF-BP mRNA expression is up-regulated by direct transcriptional mechanisms in phorbol ester-promoted skin cancer (19.Kurtz A. Wang H.L. Darwiche N. Harris V. Wellstein A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2671-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,24.Harris V.K. Liaudet-Coopman E.D. Boyle B.J. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19130-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The significance of FGF-BP expression in tumors has also been assessed in vitro and in situ by transfection studies. Overexpression or conversely reduced expression by ribozyme targeting suggests that FGF-BP mobilizes and activates extracellular stored FGF-2 and promotes angiogenesis and growth of xenografted tumors in mice (16.Czubayko F. Smith R.V. Chung H.C. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28243-28248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Czubayko F. Liaudet-Coopman E.D. Aigner A. Tuveson A.T. Berchem G.J.

In the present work, we found that expression of FGF-BP is not restricted to perinatal and pathological conditions. A physiological role for FGF-BP in pregnant mammary gland is not known. However, it is notable that the importance of FGF-2 signaling in pregnancy-dependent lobuloalveolar development of the mammary gland recently has been reported (12.Jackson D. Bresnick J. Rosewell I. Crafton T. Poulsom R. Stamp G. Dickson C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1261-1268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Plath A. Einspanier R. Gabler C. Peters F. Sinowatz F. Gospodarowicz D. Schams D. J.

The accessibility of purified bovine FGF-BP opens for future investigations concerning the involvement of FGF-BP in physiological and pathological processes. This paper describes the purification and characterization of a novel heparin-binding protein secreted from the bovine mammary gland. Partial amino acid sequences obtained from purified material enabled isolation of a full-length cDNA from a mammary gland library and deduction of the amino acid sequence of bovine FGF-BP. The derived amino acid sequence was confirmed by peptide mapping, covering 74% of the purified protein. Glycosylation sites and disulfide bridges were also assigned (Fig. 5). Inspection of the cDNA sequence predicts that the unprocessed bovine FGF-BP is 234 residues long, which is equivalent to the human counterpart. Based on the known structural requirements it is expected that signal peptidase would cleave between residues 23 and 24 during the secretion process, resulting in Lys24 at the N terminus. Nevertheless, the predominant forms of the purified protein observed in the present study started at Gly32 and Ser52, respectively. The enzyme responsible for this processing remains to be elucidated. However, it is noteworthy that a dibasic sequence is found in the C terminus of the removed peptides (Arg30–Arg31 and Lys48-X-X-Arg51), suggesting that one or more subtilisin-like endopeptidases may be responsible for the processing (31.Barr P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). A similar phenomenon is seen in human FGF-BP, where it has been reported that the purified protein starts with Lys34 (20.Wu D.Q. Kan M.K. Sato G.H. Okamoto T. Sato J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16778-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, no dibasic sequence prior to an eventual processing site is found in the human precursor. Whether secondary modification of the N-terminal is a common phenomenon linked to FGF-BPs must await further investigations as well as elucidation of the proteases involved. Applied methods for estimating the molecular weight of the isolated FGF-BP gave different results. Based on the amino acid composition, the molecular mass of the predominant 203-residue form was calculated to 22,648 Da. Measurement by mass spectrometry estimated the molecular mass to 28,549 Da, whereas the protein migrates as a 36-kDa protein in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The discrepancy in mass between the isolated protein and the translated cDNA sequence was at least partly due to post-translational modifications. A search for glycosylation sites revealed the presence of glycans on Asn155 and Ser172, resulting in an additional mass of about 3074 Da. The collected data do not explain the remaining difference between the calculated and observed molecular weights. However, the apparently anomalous behavior of the bovine FGF-BP in SDS-polyacrylamide gels is most likely a result of the basic nature of the protein (estimated pI is 9.3) and the attached carbohydrate. The literature provides no data on glycosylation of the other FGF-BPs; however, the bovineN-linked glycosylation site has no counterpart in the predicted amino acid sequences of human and mouse FGF-BP. Although theO-glycosylated residue in the bovine protein is conserved in human and mouse FGF-BP, a prediction of the presence ofO-linked glycosylation in the two proteins is currently not possible. Contrary to the bovine homolog, human FGF-BP purified from A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells migrates notably faster in SDS-PAGE than the molecular mass prescribed by its translated cDNA sequence,i.e. 17 versus 22.7 kDa (20.Wu D.Q. Kan M.K. Sato G.H. Okamoto T. Sato J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16778-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is unclear whether the apparent molecular mass of the human FGF-BP reflected an electrophoretic artifact or is due to the lack of protein sequence per se. Considering the similarity in overall amino acid composition, charge, and hydrophobic character between the predicted human and bovine molecule, the difference in SDS-PAGE migration pattern is unexpected. Whereas protein sequencing of the purified bovine protein identifies the predicted C terminus unambiguously, this is not so for the human counterpart, and the precise position of its C-terminal is unknown. Hence, our observations support the notion by Wu and co-workers (20.Wu D.Q. Kan M.K. Sato G.H. Okamoto T. Sato J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16778-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the purified form of human FGF-BP could result from proteolytic C-terminal processing. Cleavage using a combination of trypsin and chymotrypsin allowed us to solve the organization of the disulfide bridges for bovine FGF-BP. All cysteine residues are involved in disulfide bonds, and the pattern is as follows: Cys71–Cys88, Cys97–Cys130, Cys106–Cys142, Cys198–Cys234, and Cys214–Cys222. Care was taken to reduce the probability of disulfide bond shuffling, and indeed no alternate bonding patterns were identified. No information is available regarding the three-dimensional structure or the disulfide bridge pattern of human or mouse FGF-BP, but the finding that all cysteines are positionally conserved in the three proteins suggests that they are structurally alike. The principal heparin-binding site of human FGF-BP purified from A431-conditioned medium has recently been localized to residues Arg110–Phe143 (25.Wang X.C. Chen J.H. Crab J.W. Sato J.D. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 46: 81-87PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence does not include any of the proposed consensus sequences for protein-heparin interactions (32.Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Weiler J.M. Linhardt R.J. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). However, the high content of basic amino acid clusters in this region may contribute to the binding specificity. Similar to its human counterpart, a highly positive net charge characterizes the region in the bovine FGF-BP homolog (estimated pI value of the human and bovine fragments are 10.8 and 10.9, respectively). Previously, direct physical evidence for interaction between FGF-BP and FGF-2 has been based on chromatographic methods. By using the ligand blotting technique, we confirmed that FGF-BP has a heparin-sensitive binding activity toward FGF-2. Although previous cross-linking experiments have shown that HBp17 binds FGF-1 (20.Wu D.Q. Kan M.K. Sato G.H. Okamoto T. Sato J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16778-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we were not able to confirm this in the bovine system using the ligand blotting technique nor by reproducing the cross-linking experiment (data not shown). The suggested alternate processing and/or truncation may explain the differences in the binding specificity of human HBp17 and bovine FGF-BP. Alternatively, divergence in species or applied methodology may have influenced the apparent functionality of the purified binding proteins. Previous studies have shown that high expression of FGF-BP is found in the skin and intestine of the perinatal only (19.Kurtz A. Wang H.L. Darwiche N. Harris V. Wellstein A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2671-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). On the protein level, FGF-BP has so far been detected only in epidermal and colon carcinoma cells (20.Wu D.Q. Kan M.K.

In this bacterium, CobU is the adenosylcobinamide kinase/adenosylcobinamide-phosphate guanylyltransferase needed to convert cobinamide to adenosylcobinamide-GDP during the late steps of adenosylcobalamin biosynthesis. The guanylyltransferase reaction has been proposed to proceed via a covalently modified CobU-GMP intermediate. Here we show that CobU requires a nucleoside upper ligand on cobinamide for substrate recognition, with the nucleoside base, but not the 2′-OH group of the ribose, being important for this recognition. During the kinase reaction, both the nucleotide base and the 2′-OH group of the ribose are important for γ-phosphate donor recognition, and GTP is the only nucleotide competent for the complete nucleotidyltransferase reaction. Analysis of the ATP:adenosylcobinamide kinase reaction shows CobU becomes less active during this reaction due to the formation of a covalent CobU-AMP complex that holds CobU in an altered conformation. Characterization of the GTP:adenosylcobinamide-phosphate guanylyltransferase reaction shows the covalent CobU-GMP intermediate is on the reaction pathway for the generation of adenosylcobinamide-GDP.

In Salmonella typhimuriumLT2, nucleotide loop assembly has been divided into two activation branches that involve four enzymes, CobU, CobT, CobC, and CobS (1Rondon M.R. Trzebiatowski J.R.

American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 710-720Google Scholar). CobT and CobC are involved in 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole activation whereby 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole is converted to its riboside, α-ribazole (3Trzebiatowski J.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 26503-26511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The second branch of the nucleotide loop assembly pathway is the cobinamide (Cbi) activation branch where adenosylcobinamide (AdoCbi) or adenosylcobinamide-phosphate (AdoCbi-P) is converted to the activated intermediate AdoCbi-GDP by the bifunctional enzyme CobU (5O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23560-23569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The final step in AdoCbl biosynthesis is the condensation of AdoCbi-GDP with α-ribazole, which is catalyzed by cobalamin synthase (CobS) to yield AdoCbl (6Maggio-Hall L.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11798-11803Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Work reported in this paper, further analyzes the bifunctional enzyme CobU. This enzyme has kinase and guanylyltransferase activities. However, it appears that both activities are not required at all times. The kinase activity has been proposed to function only when S. typhimurium LT2 is assimilating Cbi from its environment (7Brushaber K.R. O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2684-2691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). 2Thomas, M. G., and Escalante-Semerena, J. C. (2000) J. Bacteriol. 182, 4227–4233. 2Thomas, M. G., and Escalante-Semerena, J. C. (2000) J. Bacteriol. 182, 4227–4233. In contrast, the guanylyltransferase activity is required for both the assimilation of exogenous Cbi and for de novo synthesis of AdoCbl (Fig.1) (7Brushaber K.R. O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2684-2691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).2 Biochemical and structural analysis on CobU have given insights into how this enzyme may work (5O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23560-23569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 9Thompson T.B. Thomas M.G. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12995-13004Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies showed the reactions catalyzed by CobU are as follows: Reaction 1 (kinase): AdoCbi + NTP → AdoCbi-P + NDP; Reaction 2 (guanylyltransferase) (i) CobU + GTP → CobU-GMP + PPi and (ii) CobU-GMP + AdoCbi-P → AdoCbi-GDP + CobU. The kinase reaction (Reaction 1) can use either ATP or GTP as a γ-phosphate donor to generate the AdoCbi-P intermediate (5O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23560-23569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), as does its orthologue, CobP, in Pseudomonas denitrificans (11Blanche F. Debussche L. Famechon A. Thibaut D. Cameron B. Crouzet J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6052-6057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The guanylyltransferase reaction is proposed to occur via two half-reactions (Reaction 2). First, the enzyme forms a CobU-GMP covalent phosphoramidate bond, followed by the transfer of the GMP moiety to AdoCbi-P to generate the final product AdoCbi-GDP (5O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23560-23569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Structural data showed CobU functions as a homotrimer, forming three prominent clefts with the conserved phosphate-binding loop of each monomer at the base of each cleft (9Thompson T.B. Thomas M.G. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7686-7695Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 10Thompson T. Thomas M.G. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12995-13004Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Co-crystallization of CobU with GTP determined there is a substantial substrate-induced conformational change associated with the formation of the CobU-GMP intermediate (10Thompson T. Thomas M.G. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12995-13004Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This conformational change closes the clefts and, in the process, forms a GMP-specific binding pocket. The structural work also suggested there may be an overlap between the proposed GTP-binding site for guanylylation and the proposed nucleotide-binding site for phosphorylation. This raises the question of how this enzyme coordinates the binding of two different nucleotides for two separate enzymatic activities. Additionally, the finding that CobU functions as a guanylyltransferase or a kinase/guanylyltransferase raises questions as to how the enzyme binds two relatively large substrates, AdoCbi or AdoCbi-P, and discriminates between kinase or guanylyltransferase activities. Interestingly, CobU was found structurally and topologically similar to the central domain of the RecA protein of Escherichia coli(9Thompson T.B. Thomas M.G. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7686-7695Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). CobU and RecA both contain a phosphate binding loop (Walker A box), a Walker B box, and a non-prolyl cis peptide bond in similar positions in the three-dimensional structures (9Thompson T.B. Thomas M.G. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7686-7695Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 10Thompson T. Thomas M.G. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12995-13004Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 12Story R.M. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 13Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Additionally, both proteins bind nucleotides and three-dimensional structures have been solved for both proteins in the presence of nucleotide; GMP for CobU (10Thompson T. Thomas M.G. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12995-13004Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and ADP for RecA (12Story R.M. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Based on these similarities, CobU and RecA most likely shared a common ancestor, and information obtained from the analysis of either protein may give insights into how both proteins function. The specificity of the CobU enzyme for the corrin ring substrate during the kinase reaction and the specificity of the enzyme for its nucleotide substrate for both the kinase and nucleotidyltransferase reactions was investigated. It is demonstrated that during the ATP:AdoCbi kinase reaction, in the absence of GTP, CobU is altered to a less active conformation due to the formation of a stable, covalent CobU-AMP complex. It is also shown that the CobU-GMP intermediate is a true intermediate of the guanylyltransferase reaction, and that histidine 46 is the site of guanylylation. Strain JE3207 ((hisG-cob)Δ299/pGP1–2rpo + T7 RNA polymerasekan +, pJO52 cobU +) was used for the overexpression of wild-type CobU protein (5O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23560-23569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Conditions for the overexpression of wild-type CobU protein were as follows. Strain JE3207 was grown at 30 °C in 2-liter batches of LB medium containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and ampicillin (100 μg/ml) in 4-liter Erlenmeyer flasks. Mid-log phase cultures (A 650 = 0.6) were shifted to 42 °C for 1 h followed by expression at 37 °C for 2 h. After 2 h, cells were harvested and resuspended in 25 ml (per 2-liter batch) of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 4 °C containing 1.4m glycerol. Cells were frozen at −20 °C until use. Cell paste obtained from four 2-liter cultures of the overexpression strain JE3207 was used for each purification. Frozen cells were thawed and the following reagents were added: 10 mm (final concentration) dithiothreitol (DTT), 200 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA. Cells were broken by sonication (550 Sonic Dismembrator, Fisher Scientific, Itasca, IL) at setting 7, 50% duty. Sonication was performed four times for 5 min at 1-s intervals while keeping the sample below 15 °C. Cell debris was cleared from the extracts by centrifugation at 34,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman J2–21 centrifuge using a KA21.50 rotor (Composite Rotor, Inc., Mountain View, CA). Finely ground UltrapureTM ammonium sulfate (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Cleveland, OH) was added to the cell-free extracts to 30% saturation. The sample was incubated on ice with stirring for 30 min. Protein precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g (Beckman J2–21 centrifuge, KA21.50 rotor) for 20 min. Supernatant was recovered and ammonium sulfate was added to 55% saturation. Sample was incubated on ice with stirring for 30 min. Protein precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation as above. Supernatant was poured off, and the precipitated protein was resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 4 °C, 10 mm DTT, 200 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA). Resuspended protein was dialyzed against buffer A. Dialyzed, ammonium sulfate-precipitated protein was loaded at 0.4 cm/min onto a 50-ml DEAE Sepharose fast-flow (Sigma) column (10 × 2.5 cm) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. After the sample was loaded, the column was washed with 250 ml of buffer A. CobU was eluted using a 500-ml linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in buffer A. Fractions containing CobU, detected by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Coomassie Blue staining, were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A. Pooled fractions from the DEAE column were dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 4 °C, 10 mm DTT, 200 μmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm MgCl2). After dialysis, pooled fractions were loaded at 0.2 cm/min onto a 50-ml Cibacron Blue type 3000 (Sigma) column (10 × 2.5 cm) pre-equilibrated with buffer B. After loading, the column was washed with 100 ml of buffer B. CobU was subsequently eluted with a 500-ml linear gradient of 0–2.0 m NaCl in buffer B. Fractions containing CobU, detected by 12% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, were pooled and dialyzed against buffer B. Fractions from the Cibacron Blue column containing CobU were pooled, concentrated to a final volume of ∼10 ml with Centriprep 10 concentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA), and dialyzed against buffer C (1.8 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 4 °C, 5 mm DTT, 5 mmEDTA). After dialysis, sample was concentrated to ∼5 ml and was loaded at 0.3 cm/min through a 130-ml Sephacryl S-300-HR (Sigma) column (75 × 1.5 cm) pre-equilibrated with buffer C. Fractions containing CobU, based on 12% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, were pooled and dialyzed extensively against buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 4 °C, 5 mm DTT, 0.1m NaCl, 680 mm glycerol). Protein was concentrated to 1.4 mg/ml and stored at −80 °C after drop-freezing in liquid nitrogen. Protein was stable under these conditions for months. During size exclusion chromatography a high Tris-HCl concentration (1.8m) was used as a mild denaturant, as described previously for actin purification (14Schafer D.A. Jennings P.B. Cooper J.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This step was included to enhance the release of any components that may be bound in the active site of CobU. The inclusion of the mild denaturant did not have a detectable effect on the specific activity of CobU when compared with the specific activity of CobU obtained through other protocols (data not shown). This denaturant was essential for consistent CobU crystal formation during structural analysis of the enzyme. 3T. B. Thompson and I. Rayment, unpublished data. Protein quantitation was determined by either the commercially available Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit or trichloroacetic acid-turbidimetric assay (15Kunitz M.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1952; 35: 423-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) both using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Assays gave comparable results and were consistent with protein concentration determined by amino acid analysis (data not shown). Synthesis and purification of AdoCbi and AdoCbi-P were performed as described elsewhere.2 For dAdoCbi, GuoCbi, InoCbi, and CyoCbi synthesis, the reactions mixtures were identical to those described2 except 800 mm ATP was replaced by 800 mm dATP, GTP, ITP, or CTP. Purification and quantitation of Cbi substrates was performed as described elsewhere.2 All reactions mixtures contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, at 25 °C, 1.25 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP-HCl), 10 mm MgCl2, 680 mm glycerol, 0.1m NaCl in addition to CobU and substrate at concentrations as indicated. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 0.1 m KCN, pH 10.0, and immediately incubated at 70 °C for 10 min. Samples were centrifuged for 30 s at 14,000 ×g and 5 μl of each sample was spotted onto cellulose TLC plates (Macherey-Nagel PolygramTM CEL 400, Düren, Germany). Products and reactants were separated using ascending TLC with a solvent system of isobutyric acid:water:ammonium hydroxide (66:33:1) (5O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23560-23569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Ronzio R.A. Barker H.A. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 2344-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). TLC resolution was allowed to run for 1.5 h, which corresponded to a 10-cm migration of the solvent front. All assays were performed in dim light to minimize the photolysis of the Co-C bond of the Cbi substrate. To quantitate the amount of product synthesized, the TLC plate was dried, then cut in half to remove the unincorporated label. The portion of the TLC plate containing the (CN)2Cbi-P or (CN)2Cbi-GDP product was exposed to a PhosphorImager screen along with standards containing known amounts of radioactivity. A standard curve was generated, and determination of the product synthesized in each reaction mixture was based on this standard curve. The amount of product synthesized was calculated by adjusting for decay of radioactivity, the known ratio of radiolabeled to unlabeled nucleotide at time 0, and the 32P specific activity of the sample determined by liquid scintillation counting. Calculations were periodically verified by cutting product spots from the TLC plate and determining the amount of radioactivity in each sample by liquid scintillation. At all times, the calculated values using the PhosphorImager standard curve were in agreement with the values obtained by scintillation counting. Reaction mixture components, assay conditions, and assay termination were the same as described above. The enzyme and substrate concentrations were as indicated. For the separation of the products and reactants a previously reported HPLC profile (11Blanche F. Debussche L. Famechon A. Thibaut D. Cameron B. Crouzet J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6052-6057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used with the following modifications. The chromatograph used was a computer-controlled Waters model 996 with a photodiode array detector and model 600 quaternary delivery system (Waters, Milford, MA). Separations were performed at room temperature on a LUNA 5 μ C18 (2O'Toole G.A. Rondon M.R. Trzebiatowski J.R. Suh S.-J. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Neidhardt F.C. Curtis III R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C.

The solvents used were as follows: solvent A (0.1 m PO4, pH 6.5, 10 mmKCN) and solvent B (0.1 m PO4, pH 8.0, 100% acetonitrile (1:1), 10 mm KCN). The complete reaction mixture for each sample (20 μl) was loaded onto the column pre-equilibrated with 98% A, 2% B. The following protocol was used for separation. One-min isocratic development with 98% A, 2% B; 5-min linear gradient from 98% A, 2% B to 75% A, 25% B; 15-min linear gradient from 75% A, 25% B to 65% A, 35% B; 4-min linear gradient from 65% A, 35% B to 98% A, 2% B. Cbi products and substrate eluted at times indicated in Fig. 3 B. Product generated was determined by analyzing the ratio of products ((CN)2Cbi-P and (CN)2Cbi-GDP) and substrate ((CN)2Cbi). Quantitation of product generated using either the HPLC or TLC assay were in good agreement. CobU (60 nm) was incubated in the following 20-μl reaction mixtures. Tris-HCl (100 mm), pH 8.5, at 25 °C, 5 mmMgCl2, 30 μm AdoCbi, 100 μmATP, 0.3 μm [α-32P]ATP (800 Ci/mmol) (NEN Life Science Products) in the presence or absence of 100 μm GTP. Reactions were incubated for 20 min at 25 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 2 × loading buffer (17Gallagher S.R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. Wiley Interscience, New York1996: Unit 10.2AGoogle Scholar) and incubated at 70 °C for 10 min. Separation of the unincorporated label and CobU-[α-32P]AMP was achieved by 12% SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and exposed to a PhosphorImaging plate for visualization. Analysis of the chemical stability of the CobU-[32P]AMP complex was performed as described previously (18Forst S. Delgado J. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6052-6056Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. A 120-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, at 25 °C, 10 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm TCEP-HCl, 680 mm glycerol, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 μm[α-32P]ATP (800 Ci/mmol), and 0.86 μmCobU was incubated at 25 °C. After 10 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 18 μl of stop buffer (10% SDS, 1.5 mDTT, 1.36 m glycerol) and the sample was heated to 70 °C for 10 min. Twenty-three-μl samples of the reaction mixture were then transferred to fresh tubes containing 5 μl of 1.0 m HCl, 0.16 m HCl, ddH20, 1.8 m NaOH, or 3.3 m NaOH to alter the final pH to ∼1, 3, 8.5, 11, and 13, respectively. Twenty-eight μl of 2 × loading buffer (17Gallagher S.R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. Wiley Interscience, New York1996: Unit 10.2AGoogle Scholar) was then added to each sample and heated to 70 °C for 10 min. Samples were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE and visualized by PhosphorImaging. For the analysis of the CobU-[32P]GMP chemical stability, the same procedure was followed, however, [α-32P]GTP replaced [α-32P]ATP. Starting reaction mixtures for CobU-[32P]GMP exchange reactions contained the following: Tris-HCl (50 mm), pH 8.5, at 25 °C, 10 mmMgCl2, 1.25 mm TCEP-HCl, 680 mmglycerol, 0.1 m NaCl, 52 nm[α-32P]GTP (800 Ci/mmol), and 0.25 μmCobU (trimer). This concentration of label to enzyme was chosen to minimize the formation of more than one molecule of CobU-[32P]GMP per trimer. Reaction mixtures (180 μl) were incubated for 5 min at 25 °C. At time 0, a 15-μl sample was removed and added to 15 μl of 2 × loading buffer (17Gallagher S.R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. Wiley Interscience, New York1996: Unit 10.2AGoogle Scholar). After removal of the zero time point sample, nonradioactive GTP was added to a final concentration of 2 mm to bring the final volume to 220 μl. Samples were mixed by pipetting, and 20-μl samples were removed at specified time points and added to 20 μl of 2 × loading buffer (17Gallagher S.R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. Wiley Interscience, New York1996: Unit 10.2AGoogle Scholar). After the addition of loading buffer, the reactions were incubated at 70 °C for 10 min. Equal protein concentrations were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE to differentiate between covalently bound and unincorporated label. Identical reactions were run for the ATP nucleotide exchange reactions where [α-32P]ATP replaced [α-32P]GTP and nonradioactive ATP was added to a final concentration of 2 mm instead of GTP. A previously described protocol (19Yang L.S.-L. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2980-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20Cartwright J.L. McLennan A.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 361: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), with minor modifications, was used to characterize the guanylylated amino acid residue with minor modifications. CobU (1.4 μg) was added to a reaction mixture (100 μl final volume) containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5, at 25 °C, 10 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm TCEP-HCl, 680 mm glycerol, 0.1m NaCl, 10 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (800 Ci/mmol) and incubated for 10 min at 25 °C to allow formation of the CobU- [32P]GMP intermediate. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 200 μl of 15% trichloroacetic acid and incubated on ice 30 min. Precipitated protein was recovered by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 5 min). The pellet was washed once with 200 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid followed by 3 washes with 0.5 ml of cold acetone. After the final acetone wash, the pellet was allowed to dry. The precipitated protein was resuspended in 100 μl of 50 mm sodium carbonate, pH 10.5, 1% SDS. Sodium periodate (NaIO4) was added to a final concentration of 10 mm and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. Ethylene glycol was added to a final concentration of 50 mm to quench periodate. pH was adjusted to 11 with 1m NaOH and the sample was incubated at 50 °C for 1 h. NaOH was then added to a final concentration of 3 m and the sample was incubated at 110 °C for 3 h to hydrolyze the protein. The hydrolysate was neutralized with 10% (v/v) perchloric acid (HClO4) and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g (Marathon 13 K/M microcentrifuge, Fisher Scientific) for 5 min. A 5-μl sample of the supernatant was mixed with carrier standard amino acids (phospholysine, phosphohistidine, and phosphoarginine) and analyzed by silica gel TLC (20Cartwright J.L. McLennan A.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 361: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 21Tuhackova Z. Krivanek J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) along with samples of the individual phosphorylated amino acids. Phosphohistidine and phospholysine standards were synthesized as described previously (22Wei Y.F. Matthews H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 388-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), while phosphoarginine was commercially available (Sigma). To generate the cobUH46A mutation a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that incorporated the phosphorylated mutagenic oligonucleotide (5′-GAGAATTCAGCATGCTAAAGATGGCA-3′) was used (23Michael S.F. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 410-414PubMed Google Scholar). The bases in bold-face type identify the altered codon. The external primers used in the mutagenesis were the −40 5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′) and reverse (5′-AGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGA-3′) universal primers and the DNA template used was plasmid pJO51 (5O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23560-23569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The PCR-amplified product was cloned into pUC119 usingBamHI/HindIII sites and then subcloned into the overexpression vector pT7-7 using NdeI/HindIII restriction sites. The mutated, overexpression plasmid is pCOBU9 (cobUH46A). To generate the cobUH46N, cobUH45A/H46A, andcobUH45A mutations the EcoRI site immediately upstream of the histidine codons was used as a convenient restriction site in each mutagenic primer. Each mutagenic primer was used in a PCR reaction with the −40 primer shown above. The DNA template was pJO51 (5O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23560-23569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which allowed amplification from the internal EcoRI site of cobU to the external −40 primer site. The PCR product was then digested with EcoRI/HindIII and the digested fragment was cloned intoEcoRI/HindIII-digested pJO52. This resulted in the exchange of the wild-type 3′-half of cobU with the mutagenized PCR product. The mutagenic primers used were as follows: H46N (5′-GCGAGAATTCAGCATAATAAAGATGGCAGG-3′), H45A/H46A (5′-GCGAGAATTCAGGCTGCTAAAGATGGCAGG-3′), and H45A (5′-GCGAGAATTCAGGCGCATAAAGATGGCAGG-3′). The bases in bold-face type indicate the altered codon(s). The resulting plasmids carrying the cobUH46N, cobUH45A/H46A,and cobUH45A mutations were pCOBU10, pCOBU11, and pCOBU12, respectively. All mutant clones were sequenced to ensure correct incorporation of the mutated codon, and that no additional PCR-induced mutations were present. Nonradioactive sequencing was performed at the University of Wisconsin, Madison Biotechnology Center. Plasmids pCOBU9-12 were individually transformed into JE2587 ((hisG-cob)Δ299/pGP1-2rpo + T7 RNA polymerasekan +) and used for overexpression and purification of the respective proteins as described above for wild-type CobU.

https://openalex.org/W2158510285,"Amyloid beta-peptide-binding alcohol dehydrogenase (ABAD) is a member of the family of short chain dehydrogenase/reductases whose distinctive properties include the capacity to bind amyloid beta-peptide and enzymatic activity toward a broad array of substrates including n-isopropanol and beta-estradiol. In view of the wide substrate specificity of ABAD and its high activity on l-beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA derivatives, we asked whether it might also catalyze the oxidation of the ketone body d-3-hydroxybutyrate. This was indeed the case, and oxidation proceeded with K(m) of approximately 4.5 mm and V(max) of approximately 4 nmol/min/mg protein. When placed in medium with d-beta-hydroxybutyrate as the principal energy substrate, COS cells stably transfected to overexpress wild-type ABAD (COS/wtABAD) better maintained 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide reduction, cellular energy charge, and morphologic phenotype compared with COS/vector cells. Using a severe model of metabolic perturbation, transgenic mice with targeted neuronal expression of ABAD subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion showed strokes of smaller volume and lower neurologic deficit scores in parallel with increased brain ATP and decreased lactate, compared with nontransgenic controls. These data suggest that ABAD contributes to the protective response to metabolic stress, especially in the setting of ischemia."

Prior studies have focused on a potent cis-acting enhancer element located in the near 5′-flanking region of the rat and human gelatinase A genes (Harendza, S., Pollock, A. S., Mertens, P. R., and Lovett, D. H. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 18286–18796; Mertens, P. R., Alfonso-Jaume, M. A., Steinmann, K., and Lovett, D. H. (1999) J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 10, 2480–2487). Given the combinatorial nature of transcriptional regulation, we examined additional regions of the 5′-flanking region of the rat gelatinase A gene to identify further regulatory elements. In this study the identification of a silencing element located between −1903 and −1847 base pairs of the 5′-flanking region of the rat gelatinase A gene is reported. Sequence analysis, electrophoretic mobility studies, and transfection experiments demonstrate that a specific binding sequence for the hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1 is present within the silencing sequence. PU.1 activity is absolutely required for the expression of silencing activity within the context of transfected glomerular mesangial cells. Western blots identify the PU.1 protein within nuclear extracts of mesangial cells, and cotransfection with a PU.1 expression vector directly augments silencing activity. These studies underscore the complex patterns of gelatinase A transcriptional regulation and also strongly suggest that glomerular mesangial cells are ultimately derived from bone marrow cells.

As with all members of this family, gelatinase A is secreted in a latent proenzyme form, is dependent upon zinc for catalytic activity, and is inhibited by a family of low molecular weight proteins, the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (4.Woessner Jr., J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (3091) Google Scholar). Gelatinase A is secreted in vitro by many cells of mesenchymal or neoplastic origin and displays highly regulated expression during murine embryogenesis (5.Reponen P. Sahlberg C. Huhtala P. Hurskainen T. Thesleff I. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7856-7862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous studies have defined a critical role for gelatinase A in renal inflammatory processes affecting both the glomerulus and interstitium (6.Lovett D.H. Johnson R.J. Marti H.-P. Martin J. Davies M. Couser W.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 141: 85-98PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Harendza S. Schneider A. Helmchen U. Stahl R.A.K. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 1999; 14 (2287): 2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For example, enhanced gelatinase A synthesis by a proliferating glomerular mesangial cell population is characteristic of a model of immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis in rats (6.Lovett D.H. Johnson R.J. Marti H.-P. Martin J. Davies M. Couser W.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 141: 85-98PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Harendza S. Behrens U. Zahner G. Schneider A. Stahl R.A.K. Nephrol. Dial.

Yang C.W. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Reponen P. Tryggvason K. Striker G.E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1994; 5: 1391-1399PubMed Google Scholar). The functional significance of enhanced gelatinase A synthesis during these processes was underscored by the observation that inhibition of gelatinase A expression in glomerular mesangial cells blocks cellular proliferation and interstitial scar collagen formation (10.Turck J. Pollock A.S. Lee L. Marti H.-P. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 25: 15074-15083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Recent studies with hepatic stellate cells, a myofibroblast that closely resembles the mesangial cell, have also demonstrated that gelatinase A is a direct determinant of cellular proliferation and interstitial collagen formation (11.Préaux A.-M. Mallat A. Van Nhieu J.T. D'Ortho M.-P. Hembry R.M. Mavier P. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 944-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 12.Benyon R.C. Hovell C.J. Da Gaça M. Jones E.H. Iredale J.P. Arthur M.J.P. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Given the functional significance of gelatinase A expression for multiple glomerular disease processes, our laboratories have focused on a detailed analysis of the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that determine gelatinase A expression by the mesangial cell type. We initially identified a potent 80-bp1 enhancer element, denoted RE-1, located at −1342 to −1262 bp relative to the translational start site of the rat gelatinase A gene that drives in a cell-specific manner high level gene expression (1.Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Mertens P.R. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18786-18796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Subsequent expression cloning studies have demonstrated the specific interaction of the highly conserved transcription factor, YB-1, with the RE-1 sequence (2.Mertens P.R. Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22905-22912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Positive transactivation by YB-1 is further augmented by cooperative interactions with the transcription factor, AP-2, leading to major increases in gelatinase A transcription and translation rates (13.Mertens P.R. Alfonso-Jaume M.A. Steinmann K. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32957-32965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). An analogous sequence in the human gelatinase A gene has been recently identified and shown to also interact in a specific manner with YB-1 and AP-2 (3.Mertens P.R. Alfonso-Jaume M.A. Steinmann K. Lovett D.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2480-2487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our initial series of studies focused on the near 5′ (up to −1686 bp)-flanking region of the human and rat gelatinase A genes, and the current investigation was designed to identify additional regulatory sequences located in the further upstream regions of the rat gelatinase A gene. In this report we define a specific silencer element located at −1869 to −1845 bp relative to the translational start site that specifically interacts with the hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1. Overexpression of PU.1 results in highly significant silencing of gelatinase A gene transcription and further underscores the complex combinatorial nature of the regulation of this important gene. Rat glomerular mesangial cells were isolated and characterized as reported in detail (6.Lovett D.H. Johnson R.J. Marti H.-P. Martin J. Davies M. Couser W.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 141: 85-98PubMed Google Scholar). Mesangial cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Human monocytic leukemia U937 cells and rat renal fibroblast NRK cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were maintained in the same growth medium as defined above. For experiments with differentiated U937 cells, 1 × 10−7m phorbol myristoyl acetate (PMA) was added to the culture medium 24 h prior to study. A rat λDASHII genomic library (Stratagene) was screened with a radiolabeled 250-bp fragment representing the 5′ proximal end of the cloned rat gelatinase A cDNA (14.Marti H.-P. McNeil L. Davies M. Martin J. Lovett D.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Prior studies have focused on a 6-kbKpnI-NotI fragment extending from −1686 bp relative to the translational start site through the second intron (1.Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Mertens P.R. Lovett D.H.

For this study the adjacent 5′ PstI-KpnI 1311-bp fragment (see map in Fig. 1) was subcloned into pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene) and sequenced. Plasmid pT4-Luc1686 consists of 1686 bp of the immediate 5′-flanking region of the rat gelatinase A gene subcloned into the promoterless luciferase expression vector, pGL2-Basic (Promega), as reported in detail (1.Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Mertens P.R. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18786-18796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For these studies the 1311-bp PstI-KpnI fragment was subcloned into pT4-Luc1686 5′ to the 1686-bp insert (see diagram of constructs, Fig.2). This construct is denoted pT4-LucA2997. A series of truncation constructs extending over the 1311-bp PstI-KpnI segment was prepared by polymerase chain reaction using thePstI-KpnI fragment as a template. These constructs were terminated at −2783, −2563, −2343, −2123, and −1903 bp relative to the translational start site and are denoted pT4-LucA2686, pT4-LucA2486, pT4-LucA2286, pT4-LucA2086, and pT4-LucA1903, respectively. A second series of deletion constructs was prepared with 5′ terminations at −1847 and −1791 bp, and the constructs are denoted pT4-LucA1847 and pT4-LucA1791, respectively. The sequence between bp −1687 and −1903 was also subcloned in the reverse orientation into pT4-Luc1686 and is denoted pT4-LucA1903inv (see diagram of constructs, Fig. 2). The pT4-Luc1686 construct includes the strong enhancer element located between −1342 and −1262 bp (1.Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Mertens P.R. Lovett D.H. J. Biol.

To assess silencing activity in the absence of this enhancer element, a deletion construct, pT4-Luc1007, which extends to −1007 bp was prepared. The sequence between −1903 and −1687 bp was subcloned into pT4-Luc1007 yielding pT4-Luc1007/1903-1687. The sequences between −1847 and −1687 bp and −1791 and −1687 bp were also subcloned into pT4-Luc1007, yielding pT4-Luc1007/1847-1687 and pT4-Luc1007/1791-1687, respectively. A final series of constructs was designed to map further the silencer activity located between −1903 and −1687 bp. The sequence between −1903 and −1792 was subcloned into pT4-Luc1007 to yield pT4-LucA1007/1903-1792. Constructs pT4-Luc1007/1903-1847 and pT4-Luc1007/1847-1792 were prepared similarly. Finally, the consensus PU.1-binding motif −1854GAGGAA−1849 in pT4-Luc1007/1903-1847 was mutated to−1854CTATCG−1849, yielding construct pT4-Luc1007/1903-1847mut (see diagram of constructs, Fig. 2). Transient transfection of mesangial cells was performed with polyethyleneimine (PEI) according to Boussifet al. (15.Boussif O. Lezoualch F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5654) Google Scholar). In brief, 50 kDa PEI (Sigma) was prepared as a neutralized, sterile-filtered aqueous 10 mm stock. Triplicate cultures were plated at a density of 100,000 cells/well (Falcon 6-well dishes) and cultured overnight prior to transfection. The cultures were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and given fresh growth medium without serum. Purified pT4-Luc expression plasmids (2 μg/well) and a normalizing pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid (2 μg/well) were diluted in 100 μl of PBS and vortexed. In a separate tube 10.8 μl of PEI stock solution was vortexed into 100 μl of PBS. After 10 min the solutions were mixed, vortexed, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature, followed by addition to the cultures. After 4 h the medium was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and the cells were harvested after an additional 18 h. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays of cell lysates were performed as described (16.Brasier A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). All transfections were performed in triplicate for each construct, and all transfection sets were repeated at least three times. Transfection results were averaged, normalized with the β-galactosidase results, and expressed as the means (S.D less than 15%). For cotransfection experiments, 1 μg of the PU.1 expression plasmid PU-pECE or control pECE plasmid (the kind gift of Matthew J. Fenton, Boston) was included in the transfection mixture. The effects of bacterial endotoxin (LPS) and PMA on silencer function were assessed by addition of 1 ng/ml LPS or 1 × 10−7m PMA for the final 6 h of the transfection period. Nuclear extracts from mesangial cells, phorbol-differentiated U937 cells, and NRK cells were prepared as reported in detail (1.Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Mertens P.R. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18786-18796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Synthetic oligonucleotides were annealed and end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]dATP according to standard methodology. Nuclear extracts were used at 10 μg of protein/reaction, incubated with oligonucleotides, and electrophoresed as reported in detail (1.Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Mertens P.R. Lovett D.H. J. Biol.

For competition experiments, unlabeled oligonucleotides were added to 50-fold molar excess to the nuclear extracts for 15 min prior to addition of labeled oligonucleotides to the reaction mixture. Antibody supershift experiments were performed by preincubation of the nuclear extracts for 1 h at 4 °C with 1–2 μg/ml rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse PU.1 or control rabbit serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) prior to addition of labeled oligonucleotide and electrophoresis. Nuclear extracts (50 μg) were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose blots (Hybond ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were blocked in 5% dried milk in wash buffer (1× PBS, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with wash buffer containing 1 μg/ml rabbit anti-mouse PU.1 antibody. Membranes were then washed three times in wash buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1 μg/ml wash buffer, Southern Biotechnology). Washed blots were then developed using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions and exposed to film for 10 min. For our initial investigations of the transcriptional regulation of the gelatinase A gene, a 17-kb genomic clone was isolated from a rat λ phage genomic library using a cDNA probe composed of exon 1 (1.Harendza S.

These studies have demonstrated a potent, cell-specific 80-bp enhancer element located between −1342 and −1262 bp (1.Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Mertens P.R. Lovett D.H. J. Biol.

The adjacent 1311-bp PstI/KpnI fragment (fragment 2 in Fig. 1) was subcloned into pBluescript KS+ and sequenced. This fragment was also subcloned into the plasmid pT4-Luc1686, which includes 1686 bp of the 5′-flanking region in a promoterless luciferase expression plasmid, yielding plasmid pT4-LucA2997 (see Fig. 2for a schematic outline of all constructs used in this study). A series of deletions of this construct was prepared and used to transfect cultured rat glomerular mesangial cells (Fig.3). Deletion construct pT4-LucA1903 reduced the luciferase activity of the original construct pT4-Luc1686 by 50%, whereas the other deletion constructs had no significant effects on pT4-Luc1686 reporter activity. These first experiments suggested that a silencing activity existed within the 217-bp fragment extending from bases −1903 to −1687. The nucleotide sequence of this fragment is shown in Fig. 4. Analysis of this sequence using the TRANSFAC data base (18.Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter I. Hermjakob H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Ignatieva E.V. Ananko E.A. Podkolodnaya O.A. Kolpakov F.A.

The box indicates a potential binding site for the transcription factor PU.1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To map the silencing activity within this 217-bp fragment of the gelatinase A gene, serial deletions of this fragment were subcloned into pT4-Luc1686 and used to transfect mesangial cells (Fig.5 A). Moderate but not significant decreases in luciferase activity were observed with constructs pT4-LucA1791 and pT4-LucA1847, as compared with construct pT4-Luc1686. Luciferase expression was reduced by 50% following transfection with construct pT4-LucA1903, as compared with pT4-Luc1686. When the 217-bp fragment was cloned into pT4-Luc1686 in the reverse orientation (construct pT4-LucA1903inv), there was also a 50% reduction in luciferase activity, as compared with pT4-Luc1686. These experiments suggested that one or more regions with silencing activity are present within the −1903 to −1847 sequence. They also indicate that this region can act in an orientation-independent manner, which is characteristic of some silencer elements (19.Ogbourne S. Antalis T.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To determine whether the silencing activity identified in sequence −1903 to −1687 was the result of direct suppression of the strong enhancer element located at −1342 to −1262 bp, a second series of deletions was subcloned into plasmid pT4-Luc1007, which does not include the enhancer sequence (Fig. 5 B). As observed with the earlier set of deletion constructs, only the construct including −1903 to −1686 bp reduced the luciferase activity of construct pT4-Luc1007. These experiments indicate that the silencing activity of the −1903 to −1687-bp sequence is not dependent upon interactions with the enhancer element and is more probably the consequence of interaction with the proximal promoter. For further mapping of the silencing activity, an additional series of deletion constructs of the −1903 to −1687-bp region was prepared, using the enhancerless pT4-Luc1007 reporter construct (Fig.5 C). Deletion constructs including the most 5′ 83 and 56 bp (plasmids pT4-Luc1007/1903-1820 and pT4-Luc1007/1903-1847, respectively) had the same degree of silencing activity as obtained with the complete −1903- to −1687-bp fragment. The 27-bp sequence extending from −1847 to −1820 bp (pT4-Luc1007/1847-1820) did not demonstrate any significant silencing activity, thereby mapping the silencer to the sequence spanning −1903 to −1847 bp. The 56-bp −1903 to −1847 sequence includes the consensus core PU.1-binding site discussed above. In order to determine the functional significance of this site, an additional construct was prepared in which the core PU.1-binding site was mutated to 5′-CTATCG-3′, according to Klemsz et al. (20.McKercher S.R. Torbett B.E. Anderson K.L. Henkel G.W. Vestal D.J. Baribault H. Klemsz M. Feeney A.J. Wu G.E. Paige C.J. Maki R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5647-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar), creating plasmid pT4-Luc1007/1903-1847mut). This mutated plasmid did not express silencing activity as compared with control pT4-Luc1007, indicating that an intact PU.1 core consensus binding site is required for silencing activity. EMSA using nuclear extracts from mesangial cells and a synthetic oligonucleotide extending from −1869 to −1845 bp, which includes the PU.1-binding site, was performed. In the presence of mesangial cell nuclear extract, the radiolabeled −1869 to −1845-bp oligonucleotide showed significant mobility retardation with formation of a single major oligonucleotide-protein complex (Fig. 6,2nd lane). The formation of the oligonucleotide-protein complex was significantly reduced when the mesangial cell nuclear extracts were preincubated with a specific rabbit anti-PU.1 IgG (Fig. 6, 3rd lane), whereas preincubation with a control rabbit anti-mouse IgG had no significant effect on the formation of the oligonucleotide-protein complex (Fig. 6,4th lane). The specificity of the oligonucleotide-protein complex formation was further confirmed by competition experiments. A 50-molar excess of cold −1869- to −1845-bp oligonucleotide strongly competed for nuclear protein binding, resulting in the disappearance of the major shifted complex (Fig. 6,5th lane), whereas a 50-molar excess of the cold −1875 to −1856 oligonucleotide, which lacks the PU.1 consensus binding site, did not compete for complex formation (Fig. 6, 6th lane). A synthetic oligonucleotide extending from −1869 to −1845 was prepared in which the consensus PU.1 site was mutated. Preincubation with a 50-molar excess of this oligonucleotide had no effect on nuclear protein-oligonucleotide complex formation (Fig. 6,7th lane), providing further confirmation that the PU.1 protein is required for complex formation. The cell-specific nuclear protein binding activity for the −1869 to −1845 oligonucleotide was investigated by comparing nuclear extracts from mesangial cells, phorbol ester-differentiated U937 monocytic leukemia cells, which express PU.1 protein, and fibroblastic NRK cells, which do not. EMSA with nuclear extracts from mesangial cells and differentiated U937 cells yielded identically retarded complexes following incubation with radiolabeled −1869 to −1845 oligonucleotide (Fig. 7 A), whereas nuclear extracts from PU.1-negative NRK cells did not yield oligonucleotide-protein complexes. When a Western blot with anti-PU.1 antibody was performed with the respective nuclear extracts, specific bands of 42 kDa, consistent with the molecular mass of PU.1, were detected in the mesangial and U937 cell extracts but not with the NRK extracts. These studies provide further confirmation for the direct role of the PU.1 protein in the formation of the oligonucleotide-protein complexes. To assess directly the influence of PU.1 on the silencing activity, cotransfection experiments with the luciferase reporter constructs and a eukaryotic expression vector PU-pECE encoding PU.1 were performed. The results of these experiments are summarized in Fig. 8. Cotransfection of the PU-pECE plasmid with the pT4-Luc1686 construct had no significant effect on relative luciferase activity, as compared with cotransfection with a control pECE plasmid. Cotransfection of PU-pECE, but not control pECE, with the pT4-LucA1903 plasmid, which includes the PU.1-binding site, further reduced luciferase activity by more than 50%. The phosphorylation status of the PU.1 protein has been previously shown to affect DNA binding and transcriptional regulatory activity (21.Carey J.O. Posekany K.J. deVente J.E. Pettit G.R. Ways D.K. Blood. 1996; 87: 4316-4324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Shackelford R. Adams D.O. Johnson S.P. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1374-1382PubMed Google Scholar). By using hematopoietic cells, incubation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or phorbol ester (PMA) enhances PU.1 activity through protein kinase-dependent pathways (24.Lodie T.A. Savedra Jr., R. Golenbock D.T. Van Beveren C.P. Maki R.A. Fenton M.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1848-1856PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Xue Y. Alford P. Shackelford R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To determine whether a similar pathway is operative for PU.1-mediated gelatinase A silencing, cultured mesangial cells were transfected with the reporter constructs pT4-Luc1686 and pT4-LucA1903. Following transfection the cultures were incubated either in control medium, 1 ng/ml LPS, or 1 × 10−7m PMA for 6 h. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig.9. Treatment with either LPS or PMA had no significant effect on the transcriptional activity of the pT4-Luc1686 plasmid, whereas both reagents significantly increased the silencing activity contained with the pT4-LucA1903 plasmid, which includes the PU.1-binding site. Taken together with the PU.1 transfection experiments, these studies provide direct experimental evidence for the involvement of PU.1 in the silencing activity mapped to −1903 to −1847. Enhanced gelatinase A expression is a critical component of the glomerular inflammatory process and is directly associated with the development of sclerosis and loss of renal function. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of the transcriptional regulation of this gene within the context of glomerular mesangial cells is an important experimental goal. In this study we have further analyzed the 5′-flanking region of the rat gelatinase A gene and have identified the transcription factor PU.1 as a potent silencer of gelatinase A transcription. The silencer activity was localized to a 56-bp sequence located between −1903 and −1847 bp relative to the translational start site. Inspection of this sequence revealed the consensus core PU.1-binding sequence, GAGGAA, which is flanked on the 3′ aspect by GG. The GAGGAAGG sequence is present in the promoters of the FcγRI and FcγRIIIA genes and specifically binds PU.1 (23.Li S.L. Schlegel W. Valente A.J. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32453-32460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Mutation of this sequence in the gelatinase A gene resulted in complete loss of silencing and EMSA activity. Furthermore, studies with a highly specific anti-PU.1 antibody confirmed the presence of PU.1 protein binding with the GAGGAAGG-containing oligonucleotide, whereas Western blot analysis of mesangial cell nuclear extracts specifically detected the 42-kDa PU.1 protein. Cotransfection with a PU.1 expression plasmid significantly enhanced the silencing activity of this sequence, as did incubation with bacterial endotoxin and phorbol esters. Bacterial endotoxin and phorbol esters have been demonstrated to increase the transcriptional activity of PU.1 through casein kinase II- or protein kinase C-mediated PU.1 phosphorylation (24.Lodie T.A. Savedra Jr., R. Golenbock D.T. Van Beveren C.P. Maki R.A. Fenton M.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1848-1856PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Xue Y. Alford P. Shackelford R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). PU.1 is an important member of the large Ets family of transcriptional regulatory proteins. PU.1 expression is generally considered to be restricted to cells of hematopoietic lineage, including stem cells, macrophages, B-cells, and neutrophils (20.McKercher S.R. Torbett B.E. Anderson K.L. Henkel G.W. Vestal D.J. Baribault H. Klemsz M. Feeney A.J. Wu G.E. Paige C.J. Maki R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5647-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 27.McKercher S.R. Henkel G.W. Maki R.A.

Smith K.A. Perkin H. Hermanson G. Anderson C.G. Jolly D.J. Maki R.A. Torbett B.E. Blood. 1999; 94: 2310-2318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glomerular mesangial cells are multipotential pericytes that can execute macrophage-like functions, including phagocytosis, release of reactive oxygen species, and antigen presentation (30.Schlöndorff D. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 31.Radeke H.H. Emmendorffer A. Uciechowski P. von der Ohe J. Schwinzer B. Resch K. Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 763-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These properties have given rise to speculation that mesangial cells derive from the bone marrow, a speculation that has been recently confirmed using transplanted green fluorescent protein-expressing transgenic bone marrow cells (32.Utsunomiya Y., Yu, Z. Kawamua T. Nagasawa R. Okabe M. Maruyama N. Hosoya T. Ohno T. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10 (abstr.): 406Google Scholar). Hence, the observation in this report that cultured glomerular mesangial cells express PU.1 protein is consistent with a hematopoietic origin for these cells. Most studies examining the transcriptional regulatory activity of PU.1 have demonstrated positive transactivation. For example, PU.1 enhances transcription of a large group of genes involved in myeloid differentiation, including the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor, the macrophage scavenger receptor, and the common β subunit of the interleukin-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin-5 receptors (29.Anderson K.L.

Thus, PU.1-mediated gelatinase A transcriptional silencing in mesangial cells may be but one component of a larger group of PU.1-regulated genes in this cell type. Transcriptional silencers have been found in a number of genes, including vimentin, thyrotropin-β, plasminogen activator inhibitor type-2, platelet-derived growth factor, and c-fos (26.Natesan S.

It has been suggested that bound silencer proteins repress transcription by interfering at a distance with the core proximal promoter, by interfering with an enhancer element directly, or by interfering with enhancer-core promoter interactions (19.Ogbourne S. Antalis T.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The behavior of the PU.1-silencing element in the gelatinase A gene is most consistent with the first model, since core proximal promoter activity was repressed in the absence of the enhancer element. A similar pattern has been demonstrated for the vimentin silencer (40.Farell F.X. Sax C.M. Zeher Z.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2349-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In summary, this study has characterized a PU.1-binding silencer element in the 5′-flanking region of the rat gelatinase A gene. Recent sequence analysis of the human gelatinase A gene has detected a highly homologous sequence within the same region, suggesting that the current observations are applicable to regulation of the human gene as well. 2D. H. Lovett, unpublished observations. These studies underscore the complex patterns of gelatinase A transcriptional regulation within glomerular mesangial cells and provide further support for the macrophage-like nature of this critical inflammatory effector cell."

The reduction of the potential by either decreasing the light intensity or by adding increasing concentrations of the ionophore carbonylcyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) revealed a marked inhibition of the cytochromeb 6 oxidation rate (10-fold) without substantial modifications of cytochrome f oxidation kinetics. Partial recovery of this inhibition could be obtained in the presence of ionophores provided that the membrane potential was re-established by illumination with a train of actinic flashes fired at a frequency higher than its decay. Measurements of isotopic effects on the kinetics of cytochrome b 6 oxidation revealed a synergy between the effects of ionophores and the H2O-D2O exchange. We propose therefore, that protonation events influence the kinetics of cytochromeb 6 oxidation at the Qi site and that these reactions are strongly influenced by the light-dependent generation of a transmembrane potential.

We propose therefore, that protonation events influence the kinetics of cytochromeb 6 oxidation at the Qi site and that these reactions are strongly influenced by the light-dependent generation of a transmembrane potential. photosystem I and II, respectively redox midpoint potential high potential heme of cytochrome b 6 low potential heme of cytochrome b 6 dicyclohexyl-18-crown-6 carbonylcyanidep-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (6-O-(N-heptylcarvamoyl)-methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside quinol-reducing site of cytochromeb 6 f complex quinol-oxidizing site of cytochromeb 6 f complex N-tris (hydroxymethyl)methylglycine reference transmittance difference between the transmittance of the measuring sample and that of the reference The cytochrome b 6 fcomplex is a central component of the photosynthetic chain, transferring electrons from the photosystem II (PSII)1 to the photosystem I (PSI).

Sequence comparisons have shown that cytochromeb 6 and subunit IV are, respectively, homologous to the N- and C-terminal parts of mitochondrial and bacterial cytochromes b (6Widger W.R. Cramer W.A. Herrmann R.G. Trebst A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). As a member of the bc-type proteins, cytochromeb 6 f complex couples proton translocation across the membrane to electron transfer from a lipophilic two-electron donor (plastoquinol) to a hydrophilic one-electron acceptor protein (plastocyanin or a c-type cytochrome). This electron transfer operates through a high potential chain (also called the linear path) formed by the Rieske protein and cytochromef. The most widely accepted hypothesis to explain the function mechanism of bc complexes is the “Q cycle” hypothesis of Mitchell (7Mitchell P. FEBS Lett. 1975; 56: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). It predicts that oxidation of quinols not only involves the linear path but also a cyclic path composed of the b hemes, b l andb h , and termed the low potential chain. This mechanism, as modified by Crofts et al. (8Crofts A.R. Meinhardt S.W. Jones K.R. Snozzi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 723: 202-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), postulates both an oxidation and a reduction of plastoquinol at two distinct sites of the protein, the Qo and Qi sites, on opposite sides of the membrane. The oxidation of plastoquinol at the Qo site is associated with the reduction of both cytochrome f and b l (7Mitchell P. FEBS Lett. 1975; 56: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 8Crofts A.R. Meinhardt S.W. Jones K.R. Snozzi M. Biochim. Biophys.

Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the extramembrane domain of the Rieske protein assumes different conformations with respect to its transmembrane helix (10Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V. Chi Y. Kim K. Hung L. Crofts A. Berry E. Kim S. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 11Iwata S. Lee J. Okada K. Lee J. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.

A movement of the quinol molecule has also been predicted, on the basis of the position within the Qo site of residues responsible for the resistance to different inhibitors (10Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V. Chi Y. Kim K. Hung L. Crofts A. Berry E. Kim S. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 11Iwata S. Lee J. Okada K. Lee J. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.

An interpretative model has been then proposed (11Iwata S. Lee J. Okada K. Lee J. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T. Ramaswamy S. Jap B. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 14Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) according to which the quinol and the oxidized Rieske protein remain close together at the Qo site until an electron is transferred from the quinol to the iron of the Rieske. They then move apart to reduce the b l and the c heme, respectively. We have recently confirmed the validity of this model in the case of the cytochrome b 6 fcomplex, measuring the effects of different inhibitors of the Qo site on the kinetics of electron injection into the low and the high potential paths (15Barbagallo R.P. Finazzi G. Forti G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12814-12821Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Less information is available on the oxidation mechanism of theb 6 hemes (16Cramer W.A. Soriano G.M. Ponomarev M. Huang D. Zhang H. Martinez S.E. Smith J.L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 477-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 17Hope A.B. Biochim.

According to the Q cycle, this occurs through a two-step reduction of a plastoquinone molecule at the Qi site. Thus, under oxidizing conditions, the electron transfer sequence is the reduction by plastoquinol of cytochromeb l , which is in turn oxidized by cytochromeb h . A second turnover places bothb l and b h in a reduced state and causes the reduction of a plastoquinone to a plastoquinol at the Qi site, b hemes reoxidation, and proton uptake from the stromal space. The redox cofactors involved in plastoquinol oxidation through the linear path (the Fe2S2 cluster and the c-type heme) lie in a plane parallel to that of the membrane, whereas the b hemes axis (cyclic path) is essentially perpendicular to it (9Xia D., Yu, C.A. Kim H. Xian J.Z. Kachurin A., M. Zhang L., Yu, L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 10Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V. Chi Y. Kim K. Hung L. Crofts A. Berry E. Kim S. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 11Iwata S. Lee J. Okada K. Lee J. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.

A. 1998; 95: 8026-8033Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). As a consequence, only the cyclic path is electrogenic, as it involves the vectorial transfer of one charge across the membrane. This charge movement, in addition to PSI and PSII charge separation, is responsible for the generation of an electric field across the membrane (Δψ) (19Witt H.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 505: 355-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The Δψ contributes with the ΔpH (resulting from the activity of PSII and of cytochrome b 6 f) to the generation of the electrochemical proton gradient (Δμ̃H+) (19Witt H.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 505: 355-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). This model has been confirmed experimentally in the case of the cytochrome bc 1 complex, mainly on the basis of results obtained in the presence of the inhibitor antimycin (20Dutton P.L. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 30: 495-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), which is known to bind selectively to the Qi site (9Xia D., Yu, C.A. Kim H. Xian J.Z. Kachurin A., M. Zhang L., Yu, L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 10Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V. Chi Y. Kim K. Hung L. Crofts A. Berry E. Kim S. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 11Iwata S. Lee J. Okada K. Lee J. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T. Ramaswamy S. Jap B. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 21Degli Esposti M. de Vries S. Crimi M. Ghelli A. Patarnello T. Meyer A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 243-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). However, these results cannot be transposed directly to the cytochromeb 6 f complex for the following different reasons. (i) Antimycin is not effective in the case of theb 6 f complex (21Degli Esposti M. de Vries S. Crimi M. Ghelli A. Patarnello T. Meyer A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 243-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 22Selak M.A. Whitmarsh J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1984; 39: 485-489Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Other inhibitors specifically affect the Qi site of theb 6 f complex (e.g.2-n-nonyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide; NQNO; 22), the mechanism of which seems to be similar to that of antimycin (23Joliot P. Joliot A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 849: 211-222Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 24Jones R.W. Whitmarsh J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 933: 258-268Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), although not identical (see a discussion in Ref.17Hope A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar); (ii) the redox potentials of the b hemes are different in the bc 1 and theb 6 f complexes (reviewed in Ref. 25Hauska G. Schutz M. Buttner M. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1996: 377-398Google Scholar). This difference probably explains why the equilibrium between the heme b h and the quinone molecule is shifted in favor of the latter in the bc 1 complexes and of the former in the case of cytochromeb 6 f complexes (16Cramer W.A. Soriano G.M. Ponomarev M. Huang D. Zhang H. Martinez S.E. Smith J.L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 477-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 17Hope A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This has a relevant consequence on the mechanism of quinone reduction at the Qi site; although the two electrons can be injected consecutively onto the quinone molecule in the case of the bc 1, the transfer must occur essentially in a concerted manner in the case of the cytochrome b 6 f complex (16Cramer W.A. Soriano G.M. Ponomarev M. Huang D. Zhang H. Martinez S.E. Smith J.L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 477-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 17Hope A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have studied the mechanism of cytochromeb 6 oxidation in intact cells of the green algaeChlamydomonas reinhardtii. We have observed an inhibition of the cytochrome b 6 oxidation rate (by a factor of ∼10) when the membrane potential decay was accelerated by the addition of the ionophore FCCP, without substantial modifications of cytochrome f oxidation kinetics. The same phenomenon was observed also when the Δμ̃H+ was reduced by changing the light intensity. Moreover, a partial recovery of this inhibition was obtained in the presence of ionophores when the potential was re-established by illumination with a train of actinic flashes fired at a frequency higher than its decay. Measurements of isotopic effects on the kinetics of cytochromeb 6 oxidation revealed a synergy between the effects of ionophores and the H2O-D2O exchange. We propose therefore, that protonation events influence the kinetics of cytochrome b 6 oxidation at the Qi site and that these reactions are strongly influenced by the light-dependent generation of a Δμ̃H+. C. reinhardtii wild type cells derived from the strain 137C were kindly provided by the Laboratoire de Physiologie Membranaire et Moléculaire du Chloroplaste at the Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique, Paris, France. They were grown at 27 °C in acetate-supplemented medium (26Gorman D.S. Levine R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1665-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar) under ∼60 μE m−2s−1 of continuous white light. They were harvested during exponential growth and resuspended at the required concentration in a 20 mm Hepes medium (pH 7.2) with 20% (w/v) Ficoll to avoid sedimentation. The ratio of the pellet and the resuspension buffer was usually 1:10. Alternatively, algae were resuspended in the same buffer containing D2O (99.8% deuterium atom) and stirred for an hour. After a second centrifugation the pellet was resuspended in the same buffer with a pellet volume to resuspension buffer volume ratio of 1:20. No increase in the kinetic isotope effect was observed when the duration of the incubation in D2O was increased. FCCP was purchased from Sigma. Spectroscopic measurements were performed at room temperature using a Joliot-type spectrophotometer as described in Joliot et al. (27Joliot P. Beal D. Frilley B. J. Chem. Phys. 1980; 77: 209-216Crossref Google Scholar). Actinic flashes were provided by a xenon lamp (3 μs at half-height) filtered through a Schott filter (RG 695). They were fired at a frequency of 0.15 Hz and were non-saturating (hitting ∼25% of the centers) unless otherwise indicated. Algae were kept in the dark under argon atmosphere in a large reservoir connected to the measuring cuvette to ensure dark reduction of the plastoquinone pool. The transmembrane potential was estimated by the amplitude of the electrochromic shift at 515 nm, which yields a linear response with respect to the electric component of the Δμ̃H+ (28Junge W. Witt H.T. Z. Naturforsch. 1968; 24: 1038-1041Google Scholar). Under the conditions employed here, the kinetics of the electrochromic signal displayed two rising phases previously described in Joliot and Delosme (29Joliot P. Delosme R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 357: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar): a fast phase completed in less than 1 μs, associated with PSI and PSII charge separation (phase a), and a slow phase, which develops in the ms time range, associated with the turnover of the cytochromeb 6 f complex (phase b). A third, slow decay was also present (phase c) that is mainly dependent on the passive ion leak through the membrane and the proton flux through the CF0-CF1 ATP synthase (29Joliot P. Delosme R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 357: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 30Rumberg B. Sieggel U. Z. Naturforsch. 1968; 23: 239-244Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). PSII absorption changes were prevented by a preillumination in the presence of 3-(3′,4′-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) (10 μm) and hydroxylamine (1 mm) (31Bennoun P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 216: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Thus, the phase a was indicative of the sole PSI charge separation. Cytochrome f redox changes were evaluated as the difference between absorption at 554 nm and a base line drawn between 545 and 573 nm. A small correction for the contribution of the electrochromic signal (5% of the signal observed at 515 nm) was made. Cytochromeb 6 redox changes were measured as the difference between the absorption at 564 nm and the same base line. Biochemical analysis was performed on thylakoid membranes obtained from cells that were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C and treated with 30 μm FCCP. Thylakoid membranes were purified after breaking the cells with a French press. The cytochrome b 6 f complex was specifically solubilized from the thylakoid membranes with 30 mm Hecameg (2Pierre Y. Breyton C. Kramer D. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29342-29349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and the solubilization supernatant was submitted to sucrose density gradient (10–30% sucrose, 20 mm Hecameg, 0.1 g/liter phosphatidylcholine, 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 3 mmMgCl2, 3 mm KCl; see Ref. 2Pierre Y. Breyton C. Kramer D. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29342-29349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12.5% acrylamide) followed by silver staining was performed on the fractionated gradient. Fig.1 shows the effects of increasing concentrations of the ionophore FCCP on the kinetics of the electrochromic signal (A), of cytochromeb 6 (B), and cytochrome f(C) redox changes. In Fig. 1 A, the kinetics of the electrochromic signal is presented after normalization to the amplitude of the fast, PSI driven generation of the membrane potential (phase a). In these experiments indeed, the addition of hydroxylamine and 3-(3′,4′-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) blocked PSII activity and the consequent light generation of plastoquinol by PSII. Nevertheless, the plastoquinone pool was fully reduced in the dark by cellular metabolism (32Joliot P. Joliot A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1034-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and the cytochromeb 6 f Qo site was consequently saturated (see e.g. Ref. 33Finazzi G. Büschlen S. de Vitry C. Rappaport F. Joliot P. Wollman F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2867-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The addition of the ionophore FCCP induced an acceleration of the membrane potential decay that was concentration-dependent. Thus, the decaying phase (phase c, see “Experimental Procedures”) largely superimposed the rising one (phase b) in which amplitude was reduced accordingly. At higher concentrations of the ionophore, phase c became as fast as the phase b, and no net signal increase could be observed (Fig. 1 A, diamonds). In Figs. 1, B and C, the reduction phases of the cytochrome redox changes are shown as upward changes, whereas oxidation phases are shown as downward changes. The kinetics of cytochromeb 6 redox changes is presented in panel B. In the presence of 1 μm FCCP, a small signal increase (reflecting cytochrome b l reduction) was observed followed by a large decrease signal. The latter is attributable to the oxidation of the b h heme at the Qi site. Indeed, no redox signal changes are expected during the electron transfer between the b l andb h hemes, for their spectra are almost identical (Refs. 2Pierre Y. Breyton C. Kramer D. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29342-29349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar and 34Joliot P. Joliot A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 933: 319-333Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar; but see, however, Ref. 35Kramer D.M. Crofts A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 193-201Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). When the concentration of FCCP was increased from 1 μm to 40 μm, the kinetics of cytochrome b 6 oxidation became slower, whereas its reduction rate was substantially unaffected. As a consequence, the amplitude of the reduction phase increased at the expense of the oxidation signal. The inhibitory efficiency of FCCP was increased at higher temperatures, which decreased the incubation time required to observe such effects (not shown). The kinetics of cytochrome f is reported in panel C. Both the oxidation and the reduction rates were not substantially affected by the addition of FCCP. We have verified that the signals measured in the presence of high concentrations of FCCP represented genuine changes of the cytochrome b 6hemes; Fig. 2 shows the spectra of the redox changes measured in the 558–573-nm region in the presence of 1 μm (panel A) or 40 μm(panel B) of FCCP. In both cases, typical spectra of cytochromes b 6 were recorded (2Pierre Y. Breyton C. Kramer D. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29342-29349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 34Joliot P. Joliot A. Biochim. Biophys.

To test whether the inhibitory effect of FCCP was due to any artifact induced by the presence of large amounts of the chemical in the membranes (e.g. monomerization of the complex), we have examined some biochemical properties of cytochromeb 6 f complexes extracted from thylakoid membranes treated or not with high concentrations of FCCP. The oligomerization state of the solubilized complex as well as its subunit composition were investigated by sucrose density gradient. The results are presented in Fig. 3, where it appears that FCCP did not alter either the oligomeric state cytochrome b 6 f complex nor its composition. The treated complex migrated as a dimer (36Breyton C. Tribet C. Olive J. Dubacq J.-P. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21892-21900Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and all subunits comigrated, especially the Rieske protein. This is important evidence for the structural integrity of the complex, as it has been shown that in case of any perturbation of the complex, the Rieske protein is the first subunit to be lost (4Takahashi Y. Rahire M. Breyton C. Popot J.-L. Joliot P. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3498-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 33Finazzi G. Büschlen S. de Vitry C. Rappaport F. Joliot P. Wollman F.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21892-21900Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A more careful analysis of the data in Fig. 1 revealed a small but significant inhibition of both cytochromes b 6and f reduction at very high FCCP concentrations (40 mm, Fig. 1, B and C,diamonds), suggesting the possible occurrence of nonspecific inhibition. To rule out the occurrence of any artifact in the observed phenomenon, we have repeated the same experiments using other ionophores (nigericin plus nonactin (37Cramer W.A. Knaff D.B. Cantor C.R. Energy Transduction in Biological Membranes : A Textbook in Bioenergetics. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1989: 79-138Google Scholar) and crown (34Joliot P. Joliot A. Biochim. Biophys.

We found that they were equally effective in promoting the slowing down of cytochrome b 6 oxidation kinetics provided they were added at concentrations that substantially increased the membrane potential decay (not shown, see Fig. 6 below). On an other hand, the addition of the H+/K+ exchanger nigericin (37Cramer W.A. Knaff D.B. Cantor C.R. Energy Transduction in Biological Membranes : A Textbook in Bioenergetics. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1989: 79-138Google Scholar) at concentrations inducing the relaxation of the ΔpH-only did not modify the kinetics of cytochromeb 6 oxidation at all (not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that the amplitude of the Δμ̃H+ is able to affect the kinetics of cytochrome b 6oxidation. This conclusion is reinforced by the data of Fig.4, where the relationship between the rate of membrane potential decay and that of cytochromeb 6 oxidation is presented. Apparently there is a threshold effect; when the Δμ̃H+ decay remained low as compared with the kinetics of cytochromeb 6 oxidation, the latter did not show any slowing, even when the rate of membrane potential decay was accelerated. However, when this rate became closer to that of cytochrome b 6 oxidation, an inverse proportionality could be observed. A new plateau level appeared for higher rates of the membrane potential decay. Two complementary experiments further confirmed the influence of the Δμ̃H+ on the kinetics of cytochromeb 6 oxidation. In the first one we modulated the amplitude of the membrane potential by changing the intensity of the actinic light at a constant concentration of ionophores. This is shown in Fig. 5 A, where the traces of the electrochromic signal measurements are shown. When the light intensity was decreased, the amplitude of the Δμ̃H+ was diminished, because a smaller fraction of PSI reaction centers performed the charge separation. Under these conditions the cytochrome b 6 oxidation kinetics was slowed by a factor of 6–7, i.e. to an extent somewhat smaller but still comparable with that calculated in the presence of high concentration of ionophores (Fig. 1). In a second experiment, we increased the amplitude of the membrane potential in high ionophore concentration-treated samples by firing a series of flashes at a frequency that was sufficiently high to prevent its complete relaxation between two consecutive illuminations. According to the hypothesis mentioned above, an acceleration of cytochrome b 6 oxidation kinetic is expected upon rebuilding of the membrane potential. The results of this experiment are reported in Fig. 6; five flashes were fired to samples treated with low (squares) and high concentrations of ionophores (circles). The interval between two consecutive flashes (20 ms) was smaller than the rate of potential decay both in the low and the high ionophore concentration-trea"
https://openalex.org/W2161371945,"Quiescent cell proline dipeptidase (QPP) is an intracellular serine protease that is also secreted upon cellular activation. This enzyme cleaves N-terminal Xaa-Pro dipeptides from proteins, an unusual substrate specificity shared with dipeptidyl peptidase IV (CD26/DPPIV). QPP is a 58-kDa protein that elutes as a 120–130-kDa species from gel filtration, indicating that it forms a homodimer. We analyzed this dimerization with in vivoco-immunoprecipitation assays. The amino acid sequence of QPP revealed a putative leucine zipper motif, and mutational analyses indicated that this leucine zipper is required for homodimerization. The leucine zipper mutants showed a complete lack of enzymatic activity, suggesting that homodimerization is important for QPP function. On the other hand, an enzyme active site mutant retained its ability to homodimerize. These data are the first to demonstrate a role for a leucine zipper motif in a proteolytic enzyme and suggest that leucine zipper motifs play a role in mediating dimerization of a diverse array of proteins."

These hormones are powerful regulators of whole body metabolism and are released in response to gastrointestinal, nutritional, and neuronal signals (1Genuth S.M. Berne R.M. Levy M.N. Physiology. 3rd Ed. Mosby-Year Book, Inc., St. Louis1993: 851-875Google Scholar). One important function of somatostatin is to limit the secretion of insulin, glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide, and somatostatin itself (1Genuth S.M. Berne R.M. Levy M.N. Physiology. 3rd Ed.

Molecular cloning identified six somatostatin receptors (sst1, sst2A, sst2B, sst3, sst4, and sst5) that bind somatostatin with high affinity, are coupled to G-proteins, and regulate various cellular effectors (for review see Refs. 3Meyerhof W.

The sst subtypes are encoded by five genes that are differentially expressed in human and rat pancreatic islets. sst1 has been exclusively detected in human β-cells, whereas sst2 is confined to α-cells. sst3 and sst4 were found in subpopulations of β-cells. sst5 is present in β- and δ-cells (5Kumar U.

An sst1-specific agonist, [des-Ala1,des-Gly2,des-Asn5,d-Trp8,IAmp9]somatostatin-14 (CH-275), became recently available (11Liapakis G. Hoeger C. Rivier J. Reisine T. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Chem. 1991; 266: 837-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it was concluded that, in addition to sst5, sst1 receptors may be involved in the regulation of insulin release as well (5Kumar U. Sasi R. Suresh S. Patel A. Thangaraju M. Metrakos P.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The observed differential expression of the sst1 gene in pancreatic islets, the gastrointestinal tract, and distinct regions of the brain and the pituitary suggests that cell type-specific transcription factors regulate the sst1 gene promoter (17Bruno J.F.

A number of such factors are necessary for pancreatic gene expression and cellular differentiation (22Edlund H. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1817-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Many of these regulators belong to the large family of homeodomain proteins, such as IPF-1, ISL1, Pax4, Pax6, Nkx2.2, and Nkx6.1. POU domain proteins constitute a subfamily of the homeodomain proteins and are characterized by the additional presence of a POU-specific domain (23Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Members of this family, such as Pit-1, Brn-2, and Brn-4, are well known as regulators of neuroendocrine gene expression and cellular differentiation in the brain, pancreatic α-cells, and the pituitary (24Andersen B. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29335-29338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hussain M.A. Lee J. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell.

In the pituitary, the POU domain protein Pit-1 has been identified recently as an essential regulator of the sst1 gene (27Baumeister H. Wegner M. Richter D. Meyerhof W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 255-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the present paper we investigated whether other POU domain proteins could be responsible for the activation of the sst1 gene in pancreatic β-cells. Pancreatic ducts of decapitated adult rats were clamped at the distal end, and 5 ml of 1% bovine serum albumin, 8 mg/ml collagenase (type IV, 273 units/mg, Worthington) in Hanks' buffered saline solution was injected into the gallbladder duct. The pancreas was removed and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The digestion was stopped by addition of ice-cold Hanks' buffered saline solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Islets released from the pancreatic tissue were picked with a 20-μl pipette under a light microscope and, for RT-PCR1 analysis, immediately transferred to ice-cold PeqGold solution (PeqLab, Erlangen, Germany). All of the plasmids and experimental techniques have been described in detail recently (27Baumeister H. Wegner M. Richter D. Meyerhof W. Mol.

For luciferase assays it should be noted that the luciferase activities were normalized for efficiency of transfection by determination of β-galactosidase activities and protein concentrations (Bradford dye kit, Bio-Rad). p-324sst1Luc DNA was digested either with KpnI (which cleaves in the polylinker 5′ to thesst1 gene fragment) and BssHII (position +52) or with MluI (which cuts in the polylinker 5′ to thesst1 gene fragment) and PvuII (positions +45). For labeling the coding and noncoding strand, the 5′-overhangs of theBssHII site or of the MluI site were filled in, respectively, using [α-32P]dCTP and [α-32P]dGTP. Fragments were separated on 5% polyacrylamide, purified, digested with DNase I using the Hotfoot kit (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany), and analyzed on 8% sequencing gels. Total RNA was isolated from RIN 1046-38 cells, 30 isolated rat pancreatic islets, and rat brain using PeqGold (PeqLab, Erlangen, Germany) and treated with DNase I (2 units/5 μg RNA) for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of 44 units of RNase Inhibitor (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania), 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. 2 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using mouse mammary leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and oligo(dT)18primers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). sst1 and β-actin cDNA fragments were amplified as described previously (15Roosterman D. Glassmeier G. Baumeister H. Scherübl H. Meyerhof W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 21Schäfer J. Meyerhof W. Neuropeptides. 1999; 33: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For analysis of tst-1 gene expression the rat tst-1specific primers (5′-CGCTGCACGAGGACGGCCAC-3′; position 606–625, and 5′-TCGAGCGCGCCTTTGACACC-3′; position 1101–1082, of the rat Tst-1 cDNA (30Monuki E.S. Kuhn R. Weinmaster G. Trapp B.D. Lemke G. Science. 1990; 249: 1300-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar)) were employed as described (31Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Enderich J. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16050-16057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Protein extracts were prepared from RIN 1046-38 and CV1 cell nuclei as described previously (32Renner K. Sock E. Bermingham Jr., J.R. Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4552-4557Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), analyzed on SDS-15% polyacrylamide gels (15 μl, 20 μg of protein), and transferred onto cellulose nitrate membranes (Optitran BA-S 83, Schleicher & Schüll). Immobilized proteins were stained with Amido Black (33Wilson C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 96: 263-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) to control the transfer of proteins. Following destaining, membranes were incubated in 5% milk powder, 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated overnight at room temperature with the 1:3000 diluted primary antibody directed against Tst-1 (32Renner K. Sock E. Bermingham Jr., J.R. Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4552-4557Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with sheep alkaline phosphatase was employed as secondary antibody (Sigma). A ready-made protein mixture was used as molecular weight marker (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany). Animal experimentation was carried out in accordance with the German Animal Protection Act and approved by local authorities (No. 48-3560-0/3). Following transcardial perfusion of adult rats with 4% paraformaldehyde, the isolated pancreata were post-fixed in the same fixative for 3 h and then infiltrated overnight in 20% sucrose at 4 °C. After mounting the tissue onto cryostat chucks, serial sections of 14 μm were cut at −20 °C (Mikrom HM 505 E, Walldorf, Germany) and mounted onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides. For immunohistochemical detection the Tst-1-specific primary antiserum (1:4000) and a secondary anti-rabbit IgG antibody coupled to peroxidase (ABC-Kit, Vector, Burlingame, CA) were used. For control, a rabbit serum raised against Pit-1 was used as primary antiserum in a final dilution of 1:4000. The expression of Pit-1 in adult rats is restricted to pituitary cells (24Andersen B. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29335-29338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that the sst1 gene is expressed in human pancreatic β-cells (5Kumar U. Sasi R. Suresh S. Patel A. Thangaraju M. Metrakos P. Patel S.C. Patel Y.C. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), but no such data were available for the rat. Therefore we examined whether sst1 mRNA can be detected in rat pancreatic islets. In fact, Fig. 1 showssst1 transcripts to be present in this tissue. In line with this observation, sst1 has been identified as major somatostatin receptor in rat insulinoma RIN 1046-38 cells (15Roosterman D. Glassmeier G. Baumeister H. Scherübl H. Meyerhof W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Hence, this cell line represents an appropriate model to study sst1 gene promoter function in β-cells. 5′-Flanking sequences of various lengths from the sst1 gene were fused to the luciferase reporter gene, and the resulting constructs were employed in transfection assays of RIN 1046-38 cells (TableI). A construct comprising the region from −1985 to +190 (−1985sst1Luc) showed a 14-fold increase of luciferase activity in RIN 1046-38 cells compared with basicLuc lacking a gene promoter. Deletion of the DNA region from −1985 to −165 did not significantly change the activity of the reporter (Table I). However, further reduction of the 5′-flanking sequences by 48 bp decreased the luciferase activity by 62 ± 4%. The residual activity was abolished upon deletion of the region from −48 to +52. Therefore, it is concluded that the regions from −165 to −117 and −48 to +52 are essential for transcription of the sst1 gene in RIN 1046-38 cells. In CHO cells, the reporter activity of −1985sst1Luc is low, only about 2-fold above background. Luciferase activity remained almost unaffected by the 5′-deletions down to −48 and is abolished using the +52sst1Luc construct. These observations suggest that the region between −48 and +52 contains the basalsst1 gene promoter and that the region between −165 and −117 does not contribute to the low promoter activity in this cell line.Table ILuciferase activities of sstl gene promoter/reporter gene constructsConstruct1-aAll promoter/reporter constructs contain sst1 gene segments from the indicated 5′ position to +190.

Relative luciferase activities obtained with basicLuc were set to 1. The data represent the mean of two independent experiments carried out in triplicate. Open table in a new tab DNase I protection assays were performed to detect binding sites for transcriptional regulators in the promoter region of thesst1 gene. Three regions, fp1, fp2a, and fp2b, were protected from DNase I digestion in the presence of nuclear proteins extracted from RIN 1046-38 cells (Fig.2). fp1 is located between −3 and +19 around the transcriptional start site (34Hauser F. Meyerhof W. Wulfsen I. Schönrock C. Richter D. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B). Since fp1 is located within the region that mediated low promoter activity in RIN 1046-38 and CHO cells, it likely represents the basalsst1 gene promoter. fp2a covers 71 bp between −126 and −56. Although no functional activity could be assigned to this region it contains several putative binding sites for nuclear factors (Fig.2 B). Directly adjacent to fp2a, fp2b extents from −163 to −134. It contains an A/T-rich sequence element located between −154 and −140. The location of the fp2b site within the region from −165 to −117 suggests that it is of functional importance. This assumption has been assessed by fusing a pentameric fp2b site in both orientations to the heterologous SV40 early promoter. The corresponding constructs, fp2bfSV40Luc and fp2brSV40Luc, were transfected into RIN 1046-38 cells and, for control, in CHO cells. Fig.3 A clearly shows that fp2b DNA enhanced the activity of the heterologous SV40 promoter in an orientation-independent manner in insulinoma cells only. Mutations of the fp2b region (Table II) revealed that the A/T-rich sequence element 5′-TTAATCATT-3′ located between −151 and −143 is necessary for full promoter activity (Fig. 3 B). Both findings demonstrate that the fp2b region represents acis-acting positive regulatory element of thesst1 gene promoter in RIN 1046-38 cells.Figure 3The fp2b DNA constitutes an essential region of the sst1 gene promoter in RIN 1046-38 cells. A, the fp2b DNA has been fused to the SV40 early promoter/luciferase reporter gene (SV40Luc). Five copies of the fp2b DNA were present in forward (fp2bfSV40Luc) or in reverse orientation (fp2brSV40Luc). Following transient transfection of RIN 1046-38 cells, or for control, CHO cells luciferase activities were determined and related to those obtained with SV40Luc.B, mutations of the fp2b region reduced the sst1gene promoter activity. The four mutations, m1, m2, m3, and m4, presented in Table II were introduced into the −324sst1Luc construct. RIN 1046-38 cells were transiently transfected with the resulting plasmids, −324m1Luc, −324m2Luc, −324m3Luc, −324m4Luc, wild type −324sst1Luc, and basicLuc. Luciferase activities were related to that of basicLuc.

Four DNA-protein complexes, c1, c2, c3, and c4, were detected with fp2b DNA and RIN 1046-38 cell nuclear proteins (Fig.4 A, left panel, lane 2). The complexes c3 and c4 appeared as double band on the gels. Several POU domain proteins were tested for their ability to bind fp2b DNA. Antisera directed against Brn-1, Brn-2, Tst-1, Oct-1, or Pit-1 were applied in EMSAs. Two fp2b DNA-binding proteins forming complexes c2 and c4 were identified as Oct-1 and Tst-1, respectively (Fig. 4 A, left panel). In contrast, no binding of Brn-1, Brn-2, and Pit-1 could be detected. The identity of Tst-1 as an fp2b DNA-binding protein was confirmed by EMSA analysis of nuclear extracts from CV1 cells previously transfected with a Tst-1 expression plasmid (CV1/Tst-1, Fig.4 A, right panel). The major complex co-migrated with complex c4 and was completely abolished by the Tst-1 antiserum (Fig. 4 A, right panel, lane 3). These results indicate that Tst-1 and Oct-1 bind to the fp2b DNA. The proteins that formed complexes c1 and c3 remain to be identified. Binding of the RIN 1046-38 cell nuclear proteins at the fp2b site was also analyzed by competition studies with mutant fp2b DNA (Table II). Three mutants, m1fp2b, m2fp2b, and m3fp2b, did not compete or only weakly competed with the wild type fp2b DNA for binding of Tst-1, Oct-1, and the unidentified proteins (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, m4fp2b showed strong competition. Thus, the sequence 5′-TTAATCATT-3′ that has been demonstrated to be essential for full sst1gene promoter activity (Fig. 3 B) appears to be the binding site of Tst-1. CV1 cells were co-transfected with increasing amounts of the expression plasmid pCMVTst-1 and constant amounts of the p-324sst1Luc plasmid or the promoter-less plasmid pbasicLuc. Fig.5 A shows that co-transfections with pbasicLuc resulted, independently of the amount of pCMVTst-1, only in basal luciferase activities. However, co-transfections of p-324sst1Luc with pCMVTst-1 caused a dose-dependent 7-fold increase in luciferase activity. The half-maximal effect was observed at a ratio of 1:2 of the expression plasmid pCMVTst-1 and p-324sst1Luc (Fig. 5 A). Therefore, it is concluded that Tst-1 not only binds to the fp2b DNA but also trans-activates thesst1 gene promoter in a heterologous expression system. In order to demonstrate that the fp2b region is necessary for activation by Tst-1, CV1 cells were co-transfected with the mutant constructs p-324m1Luc, p-324m2Luc, p-324- m3Luc, or p-324m4Luc and the expression plasmid CMVTst-1 (Fig. 5 B). In line with the previous results, the mutants p-324 m1Luc, p-324m2Luc, and p-324m3Luc did not show promoter activity nor could they be trans-activated by Tst-1. These results indicate that Tst-1 trans-activates thesst1 gene promoter by binding to the 5′-TTAATCATT-3′ element of the fp2b DNA. If Tst-1 is a physiological regulator of thesst1 gene in vivo, Tst-1 mRNA and protein must be present in the insulinoma cell line and, in particular, in pancreatic islets. Clearly, cDNA fragments of the predicted size of 497 bp were amplified using RNA from insulinoma cells (Fig.6 A) and pancreatic islets (Fig. 6 B) by RT-PCR. To exclude cross-reactivities of the primers with cDNA encoding related POU domain transcription factors, the DNA sequence of the amplified fragment was determined and found to be identical to the published Tst-1 cDNA sequence (data not shown). In Western blot experiments the anti-Tst-1 antiserum detected a major protein band of approximately 50 kDa in nuclear extracts of RIN 1046-38 cells (Fig. 6 C). A band of identical size was also detected in nuclear extracts of CV1 cells previously transfected with the Tst-1 expression plasmid pCMVTst-1. The observed apparent molecular weight of Tst-1 is in good agreement with that seen in other tissues (35He X. Gerrero R. Simmons D.M. Park R.E. Lin C.R. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 36Wierman M.E. Xiong X. Kepa J.K. Spauling A.J. Jacobsen B.M. Fang Z. Nilaver G. Ojeda S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1652-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To extend these observations further, immunohistochemistry was used to localize Tst-1 in islets of adult rat pancreas. All islets were stained with the anti-Tst-1 antiserum (data not shown), and within an islet, all or almost all cells were immunoreactive (Fig. 6 D). However, no immunoreactivity was seen in the exocrine pancreas and in control sections (Fig. 6,D and E). These results show unequivocally that, in addition to its presence in the insulinoma cell line, Tst-1 is also expressed in pancreatic islets. The fp2b promoter element, located between −158 and −136, plays a dominant role for transcriptional regulation of the sst1gene. In pituitary GH3 cells the POU domain protein Pit-1trans-activates the sst1 gene by binding to this site in vitro and in vivo (27Baumeister H. Wegner M. Richter D. Meyerhof W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 255-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Here, the importance of the fp2b element is emphasized by our findings that it also confers transcriptional activity to the sst1 gene in insulin-producing pancreatic cells. First, deletion of a 48-bp region containing the fp2b element abolished most of the promoter activity in transient transfection experiments. Second, the fp2b element served as an enhancer in RIN 1046-38 cells when fused to a heterologous promoter. Third, mutants of the fp2b region diminished transcription. In pancreatic RIN 1046-38 cells a transcription factor other than Pit-1 must be responsible for the fp2b-dependent activation ofsst1 gene transcription since Pit-1 is restricted to pituitary cells. Our data identify the POU domain protein Tst-1 as the activator. Tst-1 binds the fp2b DNA and trans-activates thesst1 gene promoter dose-dependently in heterologous CV1 cells previously transfected with a Tst-1 expression plasmid. Mutations within the fp2b DNA prevented binding of Tst-1, strongly reduced promoter activities in RIN 1046-38 cells, and blockedtrans-activation by Tst-1 in CV1 cells completely. Therefore, whereas Pit-1 is necessary for sst1 gene transcription in pituitary cells, another POU domain protein, Tst-1, activates the sst1 gene in the insulinoma cell line. The fp2b region might represent a promoter element that confers cell-type specificity when bound by appropriate POU domain proteins. Within the fp2b region the exact binding site of Tst-1 has been determined by mutagenesis analysis to be the 5′-TTAATCATT-3′ motif located between −151 and −143. This A/T-rich sequence represents a typical bipartite binding site of POU domain proteins that are characterized by two conserved domains, the POU-specific domain and the POU homeodomain (23Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The POU-specific domain contacts the 5′-CAT-3′ motif and the POU homeodomain the A/T-rich element (37Herr W. Cleary M.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1679-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 38Ryan A.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1207-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 39Schonemann M.D. Ryan A.K. Erkman L. McEvilly R.J. Bermingham J. Rosenfeld M.G. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 449: 39-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). There are differences between the binding specificities among the POU proteins of different subclasses. Class I and II proteins (Pit-1, Oct-1 and Oct-2) prefer the orientation 5′-TAATNCAT-3′, whereas binding sites of POU-III and -IV proteins (Brn-1, Brn-2, Brn-4, Tst-1, Brn-3.0, Brn-3.1, and Brn-3.2) mostly represent the opposite orientation 5′-CATNTAAT-3′ (40Li P. He X. Gerrero M.R. Mok M. Aggarwal A. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2483-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, class III POU proteins exhibit remarkable flexibility in DNA site recognition (40Li P. He X. Gerrero M.R. Mok M. Aggarwal A. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2483-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Tst-1 tolerates linkers of 0, 2, or 3 nucleotides between the two motifs and binding sites with both orientations (40Li P. He X. Gerrero M.R. Mok M. Aggarwal A. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2483-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 41Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Leger H. Sock E. Renner K. Grummt F. Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3738-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 43Renner K. Leger H. Wegner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6433-6437Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This explains the ability of Tst-1 to bind to the element 5′-TTAATCATT-3′ within the sst1 gene promoter. Additional RIN 1046-38 cell nuclear proteins, represented as minor bands in the EMSA analyses, bind to the fp2b region. Analysis of protein binding to the mutant fp2b sequences indicated that all fp2b-binding proteins show the same sequence requirements. CV1 cells that were co-transfected with sst1 promoter/reporter gene constructs and a Tst-1 expression plasmid showed lower promoter activity than RIN 1046-38 cells. It is therefore concluded that the additional fp2b-binding proteins may be necessary for full promoter activity. One may be the ubiquitous POU protein Oct-1 that was shown by EMSA to bind to the fp2b element. In co-transfection experiments of an Oct-1 expression plasmid with p-324sst1Luc, we observed a dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity (results not shown). The increase was similar to that seen with the Tst-1 expression plasmid, and the effects of both were additive. Therefore we conclude that Oct-1 can contribute to the regulation of the sst1gene. However, since Oct-1 is ubiquitously expressed including endocrine pancreatic cells (25Hussain M.A. Lee J. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7186-7194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wegner M. Drolet D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), its presence alone is not sufficient to explain the tissue-specific expression of thesst1 gene. In the pituitary and endocrine pancreassst1 gene expression depends on Pit-1 and Tst-1. Additional regulators may be represented by the unidentified fp2b DNA-binding proteins. Tst-1 transcripts have been detected in testis, distinct areas of the brain, skin, and myelinating Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system (36Wierman M.E. Xiong X. Kepa J.K. Spauling A.J.

In an attempt to identify POU domain transcription factors that may be involved in the process of self-renewal of the epithelium, the expression of Tst-1 has been observed in the gastrointestinal tract (48Fuller P.J. Beveridge D.J. Taylor R.G. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Yet the low level of Tst-1 expression detected by S1 nuclease protection assays was suggested to reflect the presence of Tst-1 in the Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system. A hint for a pancreatic expression of Tst-1 was given by Hussain et al. (25Hussain M.A. Lee J. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7186-7194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) who detected Tst-1 transcripts in the mouse insulinoma βTC-1 cell line. However, a functional role for Tst-1 has not been determined. In the present study, RT-PCR, EMSA analysis, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that Tst-1 is present in clonal insulinoma cells and pancreatic islets. Since Tst-1 is present in almost all islet cells, and since about 80% of rat islet cells represent insulin-producing β-cells, it is concluded that Tst-1 must be present in β-cells. POU domain proteins are well known as regulators of development of distinct tissues and cell types (39Schonemann M.D. Ryan A.K. Erkman L. McEvilly R.J. Bermingham J. Rosenfeld M.G. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 449: 39-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Tst-1 appears to be an important regulator of glial (46Jaegle M. Meijer D. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1998; 41: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), epidermal (44Andersen B. Weinberg W.C. Rennekampff O. McEvilly R.J. Bermingham J.R.J. Hooshmand F. Vasilyev V. Hansbrough J.F. Pittelkow M.R. Yuspa S.H. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1873-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and neuronal differentiation (26McEvilly R.J. Rosenfeld M.G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 223-255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other POU domain proteins, i.e. Pit-1, Brn-2, and Brn-4, represent essential regulators of neuroendocrine function in the pituitary, hypothalamus, and pancreatic α-cells, respectively (24Andersen B. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29335-29338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hussain M.A. Lee J. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell.

Here it is shown for the first time that Tst-1 is also important for transcriptional regulation in a neuroendocrine cell type,i.e. the activation of the sst1 gene. Tst-1 probably also activates a number of other genes in the endocrine pancreas. This assumption is supported by the observation that sequences homologous to the Tst-1 consensus sequence 5′-GAWTWANA-3′ (35He X. Gerrero R. Simmons D.M. Park R.E. Lin C.R. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) are present within the rat insulin I (−552 to −559 (49Soares M.B. Schon E. Henderson A. Karathanasis S.K. Cate R. Zeitlin S. Chirgwin J. Efstratiadis A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2090-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar)) and II gene (−535 to −541 (49Soares M.B. Schon E.

Res. 1995; 218: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar)), and the glucagon receptor gene (−134 to −150 (51Portois L. Maget B. Tastenoy M. Perret J. Svoboda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8181-8190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)). Tst-1 gene expression is induced upon exposure of cells to forskolin, a compound that increases the intracellular cAMP concentration (30Monuki E.S. Kuhn R. Weinmaster G. Trapp B.D. Lemke G. Science. 1990; 249: 1300-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 52Monuki E.S. Weinmaster G. Kuhn R. Lemke G. Neuron. 1989; 3: 783-793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This observation may be of importance for pancreatic β-cells since increased cAMP levels mediate the effect of insulin secretagogues, such as the glucagon-like peptide-1 (53Gromada J. Holst J.J. Rorsman P. Pfluegers Arch. 1998; 5: 583-594Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that the Tst-1 gene is induced by cAMP in β-cells. In turn it could activate the sst1 gene and thereby up-regulate the number of sst1 receptors on the plasma membrane. As a result, β-cells would respond to somatostatin in a more pronounced way to limit the release of insulin. Analysis of the expression profile of Tst-1 in pancreatic islets and identification of additional target genes of Tst-1 are likely to improve our understanding of the function of Tst-1 in pancreatic islets. We thank Dr. T. Hübschle for help with immunohistochemistry, Dr. M. Strowski (Rahway) for help with the preparation of pancreatic islets, and Dr. M. Wegner (Hamburg) for the generous gift of the expression plasmids CMVTst-1 and CMVOct-1 and of antisera against Brn-1, Brn-2, and Tst-1."
https://openalex.org/W1517430465,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF)-dependent transacetylase (TA) is an enzyme that transfers an acetyl group from PAF to acceptor lipids such as lysophospholipids and sphingosine. This enzyme is distributed in membrane and cytosol of the cells. We previously revealed that TA purified from rat kidney membrane showed an amino acid sequence similarity to that of bovine PAF-acetylhydrolase (AH) (II). In the present study, we purified TA from the rat kidney cytosol and analyzed its amino acid sequence. The amino acid sequence of the cytosolic TA is similar to that of bovine PAF-AH (II) and membrane TA. To clarify the relationship between TA and PAF-AH (II), we isolated cDNA of rat PAF-AH (II). The predicted amino acid sequence of rat PAF-AH (II) from isolated cDNA included all the sequences found in TAs purified from the membrane and cytosolic TAs. In addition, monoclonal antibody to recombinant PAF-AH (II) cross-reacted with both cytosolic and membrane TAs. Consistent with sequence identity, recombinant PAF-AH (II) showed TA activity, whereas recombinant PAF-AH Ib, which is a different subtype of intracellular PAF-AHs, did not possess TA activity. Analysis of a series of site-directed mutant PAF-AH (II) proteins showed that TA activity was decreased, whereas PAF-AH activity was not affected in C120S and G2A mutant proteins. Thus, Cys120 and Gly2 are implicated in the catalysis of TA reaction in this enzyme. Furthermore, the transfer of acetate from PAF to endogenous acceptor lipids was significantly increased in a time-dependent manner in CHO-K1 cells transfected with PAF-AH (II) gene. These results demonstrate that PAF-AH (II) can function, as a TA in intact cells, and PAF-AH (II) and TA are the same enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2087460346,"Polyadenylation increases the stability of mRNA molecules. By studying the effect of the length of 3′-untranslated region (UTR) on mRNA levels, we have found that α-globin pre-mRNA is stabilized by a mechanism that does not modulate the half-life of mature mRNA. The insertion of DNA fragments of various unrelated sequences into the 3′-UTR of the human α-globin gene strongly reduces mRNA abundance upon transfection into choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells. We found an inverse relationship between mRNA levels and the length of the introduced fragments. In fact, mRNA levels as low as 1% were observed after inserting a 477-nucleotide (nt) fragment, whereas inserting a fragment of 86 nt at the same position had no effect on mRNA accumulation. DNA insertion induced no change in transcription rate or in half-life of mature mRNA. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that inserting a 477-nt fragment in the 3′-UTR resulted in decreased levels of nuclear pre-mRNA in proportion to that observed for mature mRNA. In contrast, the insertion of the 477-nt exogenous DNA in the last intron had no effect on mRNA levels despite the presence of intronic sequences in the pre-mRNA. This shows that the reduction of pre-mRNA level was not due to the insertion of putative ribonuclease cleavage sites or the insertion of a segment DNA that reduces the elongation efficiency. Taken together, our results strongly support the existence of a pre-mRNA stabilizing mechanism that can be disrupted by increasing the length of the 3′-UTR. The fact that the half-life of mature mRNA is not affected by DNA insertion is compatible with a pre-mRNA-specific stabilizing mechanism that acts specifically before polyadenylation.

Little or no effect on 3′-end formation was observed by deleting the donor site of the last intron indicating that the intron removal per se is not essential in 3′-end formation. This conclusion was reinforced by the observation that pre-mRNAs transcribed from two human β-globin genes defective in splicing were cleaved and polyadenylated as the normal β-globin pre-mRNA (29Antoniou M. Geraghty F. Hurst J. Grosveld F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A favored model to explain the role of the acceptor site is that spliceosome assembly at the 3′ splice site of the last intron may facilitate cleavage and polyadenylation processes (18Chiou H.C. Dabrowski C. Alwine J.C. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6677-6685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nesic D. Cheng J. Maquat L.E. Mol. Cell.

Berget S.M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1552-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if the enhancing effect of the intron on 3′-end formation involves an interaction between elements present in the two regions, then the length between the last intron and the polyadenylation site should influence the efficiency of 3′-end formation and, hence, the steady state levels of mRNA.To study the interaction between a cis-acting element of the polyadenylation region and other element(s) located further upstream, we have increased the length of the terminal exon of the α-globin gene, more precisely, the length of its 3′-untranslated region (UTR),1 and analyzed mRNA steady state level. This was performed by inserting DNA fragments of various length and sequences. Co-transfection of the resulting clones with the parental plasmid into a choriocarcinoma cell line, JEG-3, that does not express the endogenous globin genes revealed that the length of the 3′-UTR strongly influences the level of α-globin mRNA. We succeeded in linking this effect to the disruption of pre-mRNA stability with no change in mature mRNA decay.RESULTSAn α-globin DNA, beginning in the 5′-UTR sequences and extending over the polyadenylation site, was placed under the control of the SV40 early promoter (Fig. 1 A). Except when indicated, all plasmid constructs were derived from this parental clone, named SV-αGL.To study specifically the effect of the length of the 3′-UTR on α-globin mRNA levels, transfections were performed in non-erythroid JEG-3 cells to eliminate possible effects of putative tissue-specific elements. The endogenous α-globin gene contains a CpG island extending both upstream and downstream from the transcription start site (44Bird A.P. Taggart M.H. Nicholls R.D. Higgs D.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 999-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). As it has been suggested that CpG island DNA may increase transcription specifically upon integration in the genome, we performed transient transfections.Two overlapping fragments originating from the type 1 3β-HSD cDNA clone were inserted in the unique BalI restriction site of the α-globin gene localized 14 bases downstream of the stop codon (Fig. 1 A). The resulting clones, containing an insertion of DNA of 477 bp (SV-αGL/3β-477-S) or of 370 bp (SV-αGL/3β-370-S) in sense orientation, were each co-transfected with SV-αGL into JEG-3 cells. Their relative transient expression levels were analyzed by Northern blot. Although the insertion of the 370-bp 3β-HSD-1 fragment reduced the level of mRNA to 15% that of parental α-globin mRNA, the effect of the 477-bp 3β-HSD-1 fragment was more pronounced, leading to an mRNA level 1% that of α-globin mRNA (Fig. 1 B). Similar results were observed in COS-7 cells (data not shown) indicating that the effect of DNA insertion is not specific to choriocarcinoma cells.Effect of the Sequence and the Length of Exogenous DNA Inserts on α-Globin mRNA LevelsTo define the properties of putative inhibitory inserts, we first studied the same DNA fragments inserted in both orientations. Both orientations of the 477- and the 370-bp 3β-HSD-1 segments decreased mRNA levels to the same extent (Fig.1 C), showing that the effect of DNA insertion is orientation-independent. To determine whether the sequence of the DNA insert is important, a 295-bp cDNA segment originating from the ORF of the 17β-HSD-1 cDNA was cloned into the same BalI restriction site of SV-αGL. The sequence identity between the 3β-HSD-1 3′-UTR and 17β-HSD-1 cDNA fragments was less than 5%. Co-transfections with SV-αGL revealed that the 17β-HSD-1 fragment reduced mRNA levels to approximately that of the 370-bp 3β-HSD-1 insert (Fig. 1 D). Thus, the inhibitory effects of DNA insertion are independent of the sequence of the DNA insert.To determine whether the length of the DNA insert correlates with mRNA levels, we introduced two DNA fragments of 286 and 86 bp in both orientations into the BalI site of the α-globin gene. The four clones were each co-transfected with SV-αGL in JEG-3 cells. Clones containing the 477- or the 370-bp 3β-HSD-1 fragment in both orientations were included as controls. An example of a Northern blot with clones containing an insertion in the sense orientation is shown in Fig. 2 A. The 86-bp 3β-HSD-1 fragment had no effect on mRNA levels in both sense and antisense orientations (Fig. 2 B). This observation demonstrates that DNA insertion does not destroy any putative α-globin regulatory element encompassing the BalI site. Thus, the insertion of DNA per se does not explain the above observations. Moreover, a negative correlation was found between the relative expression of plasmids and the length of the DNA inserts (Fig.2 C). Therefore, the effects of DNA inserts on mRNA levels depend of the length of these inserted fragments.The Effect of Exogenous DNA Insert Is Function of Its Localization in the α-Globin SequencesWe also examined whether exogenous DNA alters mRNA levels when introduced into the last intron. The SV-αGL/3β/INTRON clone was constructed in which the 477-bp 3β-HSD-1 fragment was inserted into the first half of the second intron of the α-globin gene (Fig.3 A). Messenger RNA from SV-αGL/3β/INTRON and SV-αGL had similar lengths, indicating that RNA splicing occurred correctly, albeit the presence of an insert into intron 2 (Fig. 3 B). No difference in mRNA levels was observed between the clones after readjustment with γ-actin mRNA for the amount of RNA loaded per lane. These results demonstrate that the strong effect observed on α-globin mRNA levels by insertion of DNA fragments depends on its localization in the α-globin sequence. Moreover, because the presence of the 477-nt insert in the transfected plasmid does not necessarily correlate with low steady state mRNA levels, the decrease observed with SV-αGL/3β-477-S and -A compared with the parental plasmid is not an artifact caused by unequal transport of individual plasmid during transfection.α-Globin-specific Regulatory Element Downstream from the Site of DNA InsertionThe fact that the length of DNA inserts determine the extent of the effect suggests that an interaction between two hypothetical cis-acting elements localized on each side of the BalI site is disrupted by DNA insertion. The next experiment was designed to determine whether an α-globin-specific regulatory element may be found downstream from the site of insertion. Sequences downstream from the stop codon of SV-αGL (Fig.4 A,SV-αGL-Δ3′UTR-A) were deleted by joining the stop codon directly to the vector sequence, which contains its own polyadenylation signal originating from SV40. The replacement of the α-globin 3′-UTR by the 3′-UTR of the vector in both JEG-3 and COS-7 cells had no or only a weak effect on mRNA accumulation (Fig.4 B). Thus, in JEG-3 and COS-7 cells, no α-globin-specific regulatory element can be mapped within the 3′-UTR by substitution.Does insertion of DNA also decrease the abundance of mRNA when all sequences positioned downstream from the site of insertion in the 3′-UTR are replaced by heterologous 3′-UTR sequences? To answer this question, plasmids SV-αGL-Δ3′UTR-B and SV-αGL-Δ3′UTR-B/3β-477-S were constructed (Fig. 4 A). Results indicate that DNA insertion into the BalI site had similar effects on mRNA levels in both the α-globin and the vector 3′-UTR contexts (Fig. 4 C). The only common features downstream from the BalI site between the two 3′-UTR might be the cis-acting elements involved in 3′-end formation. For this reason, if any cis-acting regulatory element positioned downstream from the site of insertion is disrupted by DNA insertion, this element might be included within sequences involved in 3′-end formation.DNA Insertion and Promoter ActivityWe verified whether insertion of DNA in the 3′-UTR also reduces expression of the α-globin gene under the control of its promoter. The 3β-HSD-1 477-bp fragment was inserted in both orientations at the BalI site of the plasmid pUCα, which contains the α-globin promoter and gene (30Raymond V. Atwater J.A. Verma I.M. Oncogene Res. 1989; 5: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar). Co-transfections in JEG-3 cells revealed that insertion of DNA in both orientations strongly reduced the expression of the α-globin gene under the control of its promoter (Fig. 5). We conclude that insertion of DNA had similar effects both in homologous and heterologous promoter contexts.Figure 5The effect of DNA insertion is not promoter-specific. Plasmids pUCα/3β-477-S (lane 1) and -A (lane 2) were each co-transfected with pUCα in JEG-3 cells. As control, plasmids SV-αGL/3β-477-S and SV-αGL were also co-transfected (lanes 3 and 4). Experiments were performed as described in Fig. 1 B. Lanes 1–3 were from an 18-h exposure, and lane 4 corresponds to 3 h of exposure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Nuclear runoff experiments were performed using clones SV-αGL-Δ3′UTR-B and SV-αGL-Δ3′UTR-B/3β-477-S. Although these two clones showed strong differences in mRNA accumulation (Fig.4 C), they produced signals of similar intensity in runoff assay (Fig. 6). This result indicates that insertion of DNA does not alter the rate of transcription.Figure 6The presence of the 477-bp insert does not change the rate of transcription. Nuclear runoff assay was performed using nuclei isolated from JEG-3 cells transfected with SV-αGL-Δ3′UTR-B (dots 1 and 2 in Aand B) or SV-αGL-Δ3′UTR-B/3β-477-S (dots 3and 4 in A and B). Dots 1–4 in A and dots 1 and 3 in B are SV-αGL-Δ3′UTR-B DNA, and dots 2 and 4 in B are γ-actin DNA. A and B are from two different series of experiments. Awas of 1-h exposure at room temperature, and B was of 1-h exposure at −80 °C with a Lightning Plus intensifying screen. Substitution of SV-αGL-Δ3′UTR-B DNA for SV-αGL-Δ3′UTR-B/3β-477-S DNA for dot blot also gave similar results (data not shown). C, transcription rate of plasmid SV-αGL-Δ3′UTR-B (no DNA insert) and SV-αGL-Δ3′UTR-B/3β-477-S (+477) are presented after normalization to γ-actin using values obtained by PhosphorImager scanning of membranes autoradiographed in B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DNA Inserts Do Not Affect α-Globin Mature mRNA Half-lifeIs mature mRNA decay affected by insertion of DNA into the BalI site? We used two different approaches to examine this possibility. The first is based on the fact that two mRNAs with different half-lives, but transcribed from the same promoter, give a ratio close to 1.0 soon after transfection, but this ratio changes over time until the mRNAs eventually reach steady state levels. Each of the two clones, SV-αGL/3β-477-S and -370-S, were co-transfected with SV-αGL, and their mRNA levels were analyzed at different times. We observed no variation in SV-αGL/3β-370-S/SV-αGL or in SV-αGL/3β-477-S/SV-αGL mRNA ratios over time (Fig.7 A). In fact, the ratios were independent of the establishment of mRNA steady state levels. Second, we did a time course experiment in the presence of actinomycin D (ActD) after co-transfection of SV-αGL/3β-370-S and SV-αGL. SV-αGL/3β-370 and SV-αGL mRNAs had very close t12 values, as evidenced by the stable mRNA ratio over time (Fig. 7 B). These two observations indicate that the addition of an insert DNA into the BalI site of the α-globin gene did not alter mRNA decay.Figure 7DNA insertion does not alter cytoplasmic mRNA half-life. A, plasmids SV-αGL/3β-370-S (left) and SV-αGL/3β-477-S (right) were co-transfected with SV-αGL in JEG-3 cells. t0was fixed at 20 h after the addition of the calcium-phosphate precipitates. Northern blots were probed with α-globin DNA.B, plasmids SV-αGL/3β-370-S and SV-αGL were co-transfected in JEG-3 cells. Cells were trypsinized, pooled, and re-plated after transfection to eliminate inter-variations. The next day, ActD (5 μg/ml) was added for 45 min, and RNA was extracted at different times. The t0 corresponds to the end of the ActD treatment. Samples were processed as described in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Levels of Nuclear Pre-mRNAWe next planned an experiment to show whether the effect of DNA insertion occurs before RNA processing. RT-PCR was performed on nuclear RNA isolated from JEG-3 cells transfected with SV-αGL-Δ3′UTR-B and/or SV-αGL-Δ3′UTR-B/3β-477-S. To amplify specifically pre-mRNA, the 5′ primer was located in the last intron, and the 3′ primer was positioned 157 bases downstream from the polyadenylation signal (Fig.8 A). The presence of the 477-nt insert into the BalI site of the 3′-UTR strongly reduced levels of nuclear pre-mRNA (Fig. 8 B). It should be noted that when plasmid DNA was added in a negative RNA sample before the DNase I reaction that preceded the RT-PCR, no amplification product was observed (data not shown). Therefore, the addition of an insert DNA into the BalI site resulted in a proportional decrease of pre-mRNA and mRNA levels, indicating that the effect of DNA insertion occurs before RNA processing.Figure 8DNA insertion and pre-mRNA levels.JEG-3 cells were transfected with plasmids SV- αGL-Δ3′UTR-B and/or SV-αGL-Δ 3′UTR-B/3β-477-S, and nuclear RNA was extracted.A is a schematic representation of SV-αGL-Δ3′UTR-B pre-mRNA, and the position of the 477-nt exogenous sequences (thick line) present in SV-αGL-Δ3′UTR-B/3β-477-S pre-mRNA is indicated. Black boxes correspond to ORF sequences; open box corresponds to 3′-UTR, thin line to intron 2, and wavy line corresponds to RNA sequences present in pre-mRNA but removed by endonucleolytic cleavage during the polyadenylation process. Arrows show position of the oligonucleotides used in RT-PCR. RT reaction was performed using 5 μg of nuclear RNA and the specific 3′ primer, and semi-quantitative PCR conditions were obtained using only 2% of RT reactions. B, analysis of RT-PCR end products by Southern blot using the 1119-bp HinfI-HinfI α-globin probe. Because sequences localized downstream from the BalI site of these clones are not α-globin sequences, the α-globin probe hybridized specifically to a segment of the same length for the two RT-PCR products, which extend from the 5′ primer to the BalI site. Fragments amplified from plasmids SV-αGL-Δ3′UTR-B and SV-αGL-Δ3′UTR-B/3β-477-S were of 574 and 1051 bp, respectively. JEG-3 cells were transfected with SV-αGL-Δ3′UTR-B (lanes 1–3) and/or SV-αGL-Δ3′UTR-B/3β-477-S (lanes 1, 4and 5). The relative intensity of specific signals are the same than those observed with ethidium bromide staining. Relative levels of SV-αGL-Δ 3′UTR-B and SV-αGL-Δ3′UTR-B/3β-477-S mRNAs were similar to these observed in Fig. 4 as determined by Northern blot analysis of the corresponding cytoplasmic RNA (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)α-Globin Regulatory Elements in the ORF and the IntronsWe next examined the possibility that the effect of DNA insertion may be related to an α-globin-specific regulatory element localized in the ORF or in an intron. Messenger RNA levels were only slightly lowered by deletion of DNA regions encompassing the intron 1 (SV-αGL Δin1) or intron 2 (SV-αGL Δin2) of the α-globin gene (Fig.9, A and B). When the 477-nt fragment was inserted in the BalI site of these two clones, a strong decrease in mRNA accumulation was observed (Fig. 9 C). The segment SmaI-NarI was then removed from SV-αGL. This deletion overlaps the deletion of clones SV-αGL Δin1 and SV-αGL Δin2. Again, the addition of the 477-nt insert into the BalI site strongly reduced levels of mRNA accumulation (Fig. 9 C). Therefore, we failed to associate the effect of DNA insertion to the presence of any single α-globin specific sequence between the 10th nt of the ORF to the stop codon.Because common features exist between introns as donor and acceptor sites, it is possible that the effect of the DNA insertion into the BalI site persists as long as one intron is present in the gene. To study this possibility, both introns were removed (clone SV-αGL-cDNA, Fig. 9 A). The resulting clone had mRNA levels similar to that observed after the insertion of the 477-nt fragment into the BalI restriction site of SV-αGL (Fig. 9 D). However, the addition of the 477-nt insert into the BalI site of SV-αGL-cDNA also strongly reduced levels of mRNA accumulation (Fig. 9 D). Therefore, the effect of DNA insertion is independent of the presence of intron sequences in the gene.DISCUSSIONWe have clearly demonstrated that increasing the length of the 3′-UTR by insertion of DNA segments had a strong negative effect on α-globin mRNA level. In our model, neither the nucleotide sequence of the insert nor that of the 3′-UTR itself, excluding features common to all 3′-UTR, contribute to the observed effect. The only characteristic of the inserts that was related to the level of mRNA was their length.We first postulated that increasing the length of the α-globin 3′-UTR might disrupt an interaction between the acceptor site of the last intron and the polyadenylation site, thereby reduce polyadenylation efficiency and levels of mRNA. It is now clear that the strong decrease in mRNA levels observed by increasing the length of the 3′-UTR was not due to the disruption of such a mechanism because the effect of the length of the 3′-UTR was observed in the absence of intronic sequences as well (clone SV-αGL-cDNA). In fact, insertion of DNA into the BalI site did not change the rate of transcription but decreased levels of pre-mRNA and mature mRNA proportionally. Therefore, our results strongly suggest that the α-globin pre-mRNA was actively protected from degradation in the nucleus and that the insertion of DNA into the BalI site, but not within intron 2, had disrupted this mechanism of stabilization. The decrease in mRNA amount was not due to insertion of putative ribonuclease sites present on the exogenous DNA insert, as demonstrated by the insertion of the same DNA segment within intron 2 with no effect on α-globin mRNA level. Interestingly, stabilization of α-globin pre-mRNA is achieved through a mechanism that seems to be inactive in mature polyadenylated mRNA, as witnessed by the absence of effect of DNA insertion on mature mRNA half-lives.The negative correlation between RNA abundance and the length of DNA inserts strongly suggest the disruption of an interaction between two elements positioned on each side of the BalI restriction site used for DNA insertion. Substitution of 3′-UTR sequences downstream from the site of insertion did not change the effect of DNA insertion. Therefore, if a downstream cis-acting element is actually related to the effect of DNA insertion, it might be positioned within sequences related to polyadenylation. The upstream cis-acting element(s) that is aimed at interacting with this 3′ element is unknown, but our results allow the conclusion that it is not localized within introns and that at least one copy of it might be localized between the beginning of exon 3 and the BalI site. This arises from the observation that no effect on mRNA abundance was observed when the 477-nt segment was introduced within the intron 2. However, the effect of DNA insertion in the BalI site was conserved even though all sequences localized between the fourth codon and the stop codon were sequentially deleted. Therefore, our results appear to be in agreement with reiterated 5′-cis-acting elements.Increasing the length of the α-globin 3′-UTR resulted in destabilization of α-globin pre-mRNA but not mature mRNA, and this was true in both homologous and heterologous 3′-UTR contexts. Considering also the fact that α-globin is not normally expressed in JEG-3 and COS-7 cells, it is tempting to suggest that pre-mRNA stabilization could be a general mechanism of eucaryotic pre-mRNAs. Further investigation will help to elucidate this point, but some cases of modulation of gene expression, probably through the control of pre-mRNA decay, have yet been reported. For example, GM-CSF pre-mRNA accumulation was observed following treatment o"
https://openalex.org/W1539919344,"Skeletal myogenesis is acutely affected by growth factors and subsequent activation of their respective intracellular signaling cascades. Components of the mitogenic Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling module are potent inhibitors of myoblast differentiation. However, the means by which these kinases prevent myocyte formation and activation of the muscle gene program is unknown. Activator protein 1 (AP-1) is a transcriptional regulator the actions of which are up-regulated by signaling events, including elevated MAPK. Because activated Raf inhibits avian myogenesis in a MAPK-dependent fashion, we investigated the role of AP-1 as a mediator of the Raf-imposed block to myogenesis. Avian myoblasts overexpressing activated Raf contain elevated levels of AP-1 DNA binding and transcriptional activity. Introduction of an AP-1 dominant inhibitory protein (AFOS) into Raf-expressing myoblasts prevented acquisition of a transformed morphology. Interestingly, these cells remained differentiation-defective. Myogenic cells cotransduced with RCAS(A)-Raf BXB and RCAS(B)-AFOS remained mononuclear and myosin-negative and did not activate significantly muscle-specific reporter genes. These results argue that Raf inhibits muscle differentiation independent of AP-1-mediated cell transformation. Our results provide evidence for AP-1 as a critical component of the transforming capacity of activated Raf and evidence that AP-1 is not involved in the myogenic inhibitory effects of the kinase."
