This finding shows that enzymatic penetration of cuticle is involved in pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2000612587,"Quartz grains in granitic rocks usually have blue cathodoluminescence (CL). Within the blue-luminescing grains, there are often red-luminescing domains which are frequently impossible to detect without CL contrast. This finding suggests that the red-luminescing quartz is sealing preexisting mnicrocracks. The presence of these now-healed microcracks has important implications with respect to the role of pore fluid pressure and fluid transfer in metamorphism, the origih of granites, longperiod crustal deformation, earthquake mechanics, physical properties of rocks, and deep-seated geothermal energy."
https://openalex.org/W2034607361,"The plasma and field perturbations of magnetospheres that would surround magnetized galilean satellites embedded in the corotating jovian plasma differ from those produced by interaction with an unmagnetized conductor. If the intrinsic satellite dipole is antiparallel to that of Jupiter, the magnetosphere will be open. It is predicted that Io has an internal magnetic field with a dipole moment of 6.5 Ã— 1022 gauss-cubic centimeters antiparallel to Jupiter's, and Io's special properties can be interpreted on the basis of a reconnecting magnetosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2036949248,Solitary waves in reaction-diffusion systems usually annihilate on collision. A nonlinear system of reaction-diffusion equations has been constructed which has solitons: solitary waves whose interaction in a collision results in the emergence of two solitary waves identical to the colliding waves.

https://openalex.org/W1976281170,"The energy requirements to build and operate the proposed Solar Power Satellite are evaluated and compared with the energy it produces. Because the technology is so speculative, uncertainty is explicitly accounted for. For a proposed 10-gigawatt satellite system, the energy ratio, defined as the electrical energy produced divided by the primary nonrenewable energy required over the lifetime of the system, is of order 2, where a ratio of 1 indicates the energy breakeven point. This is significantly below the energy ratio of today's electricity technologies such as light-water nuclear or coal-fired electric plants."
https://openalex.org/W2033482579,"In the burrowing cockroach Arenivaga, two giant interneurons in each connective of the ventral nerve cord provide gravity orientation information. The interneurons receive input from plumb bob-like equilibrium receptors on the ventral surface of the cerci. Ouir results support the theory that the cerci of cockroaches are specialized equilibrium organs."

Comparisons of these estimates show a moderate positive correlation and no evidence for relative bias, although the precision of the predictions is quite limnited."
https://openalex.org/W2090158624,"Electrostatic fields of up to 7000 volt/cm have been applied across air/solution interfaces by means of parallel-plate electrodes, and the resulting surface tension changes were obtained by measuring, through a balance linkage, the deflection of mica plates floating on the surface. Surface tension changes (always negative) of up to 0.5 dyne/cm have been observed in both distilled water and dilute sodium chloride solutions."
https://openalex.org/W2024432140,"Beryllium in nutrient solution inhibited the growth of bush beans. The initial symptom was retarded root development. Although severe stunting of plants occurred, the foliage retained normal color. Roots accumulated beryllium. Increased beryllium concentrations decreased calcium in roots, stems, leaves, and fruits, and also decreased magnesium in roots and stems. Phosphorus was slightly increased in stems, leaves, and fruit."
