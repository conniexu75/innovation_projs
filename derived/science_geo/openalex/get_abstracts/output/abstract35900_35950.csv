https://openalex.org/W2026159754,"Neuronal activity in the superior temporal sulcus of monkeys, a cortical region that plays an important role in analyzing visual motion, was related to the subjective perception of movement during a visual task. Single neurons were recorded while monkeys (Macaca mulatta) discriminated the direction of motion of stimuli that could be seen moving in either of two directions during binocular rivalry. The activity of many neurons was dictated by the retinal stimulus. Other neurons, however, reflected the monkeys' reported perception of motion direction, indicating that these neurons in the superior temporal sulcus may mediate the perceptual experience of a moving object."

https://openalex.org/W1536008717,"Uptake of cholesterol-containing lipoproteins by macrophages in the arterial intima is believed to be an important step in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. There are a number of possible mechanisms by which macrophages might accumulate cholesterol, and one that has attracted much interest recently involves the uptake of oxidatively modified low density lipoprotein (LDL) via a specific cell surface receptor, termed the scavenger or acetyl-LDL receptor. Previous studies have shown that chemical derivatization of LDL with reagents that result in neutralization of the charge of lysine amino groups also allows recognition by this receptor. As well, it has been shown that oxidation of LDL is accompanied by a decrease in free lysine groups and binding of lipid products to apolipoprotein B. The present studies were done to further characterize the receptor-binding domain on oxidized LDL. It was found that LDL could be modified by incubation with water-soluble products derived from autoxidized unsaturated fatty acids under conditions that inhibited oxidation of the LDL itself. The LDL modified in this way had increased electrophoretic mobility but showed no evidence of the oxidative damage that typifies LDL oxidized by exposure to metal ions. Furthermore, the oxidation product-modified LDL was rapidly degraded by cultured macrophages through the scavenger receptor pathway. Bovine albumin modified by oxidation products also showed greatly accelerated degradation by macrophages. When analyzed by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, the reactive oxidation products appeared less polar than fatty acids or simple medium-chain aldehydes. When treated with the carbonyl reagent 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, the reactive fractions yielded derivatives, some of which were identified by mass spectrometry as hydrazones of nonenal, heptenal, pentenal, and crotonaldehyde. A series of 2-unsaturated aldehydes (acrolein to 2-nonenal) were all found to modify LDL, but none of these aldehyde-modified LDLs were recognized by the scavenger receptor of macrophages and all were degraded much more slowly by these cells than LDL modified with oxidation products. Furthermore, copper-oxidized LDL had only very slight immunoreactivity toward a panel of antibodies specific for adducts of simple 2-unsaturated aldehydes. Analysis of underivatized autoxidized fatty acids by coupled liquid chromatography/thermospray mass spectrometry revealed compounds with m/z corresponding to M+17, M+31, and 2M+31 in fractions that were capable of modifying LDL. The unoxidized fatty acids showed a dominant peak at M-1. These results indicate that the scavenger receptor of macrophages can recogn"

https://openalex.org/W2088103235,"Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) can mimic the biophysical effects of associative learning on neurons. Furthermore, classical conditioning of the rabbit nictitating membrane (a form of associative learning) produces translocation of PKC activity from the cytosolic to the membrane compartments of the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Evidence is provided here for a significant change in the amount and distribution of PKC within the CA1 cell field of the rabbit hippocampus that is specific to learning. This change is seen at 1 day after learning as focal increments of [3H]phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate binding to PKC in computer-generated images produced from coronal autoradiographs of rabbit brain. In addition, 3 days after learning, the autoradiographs suggest a redistribution of PKC within CA1 from the cell soma to the dendrites."

https://openalex.org/W2054389778,"Cocaine abuse has reached epidemic proportions in the United States, and the search for an effective pharmacotherapy continues. Because primates self-administer most of the drugs abused by humans, they can be used to predict the abuse liability of new drugs and for preclinical evaluation of new pharmacotherapies for drug abuse treatment. Daily administration of buprenorphine (an opioid mixed agonist-antagonist) significantly suppressed cocaine self-administration by rhesus monkeys for 30 consecutive days. The effects of buprenorphine were dose-dependent. The suppression of cocaine self-administration by buprenorphine did not reflect a generalized suppression of behavior. These data suggest that buprenorphine would be a useful pharmacotherapy for treatment of cocaine abuse. Because buprenorphine is a safe and effective pharmacotherapy for heroin dependence, buprenorphine treatment may also attenuate dual abuse of cocaine and heroin."
https://openalex.org/W1514958964,"Transcription factor ETF stimulates the expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene which does not have a TATA box in the promoter region. Here, we show that ETF recognizes various GC-rich sequences including stretches of deoxycytidine or deoxyguanosine residues and GC boxes with similar affinities. ETF also binds to TATA boxes but with a lower affinity. ETF stimulated in vitro transcription from several promoters without TATA boxes but had little or no effect on TATA box-containing promoters even though they had strong ETF-binding sites. These inactive ETF-binding sites became functional when placed upstream of the EGFR promoter whose own ETF-binding sites were removed. Furthermore, when a TATA box was introduced into the EGFR promoter, the responsiveness to ETF was abolished. These results indicate that ETF is a specific transcription factor for promoters which do not contain TATA elements."
https://openalex.org/W1641450356,"Abstract A simple rapid and reproducible procedure for transferring monoclonal antibodies into mammalian cells by electroporation is described. Two functionally different monoclonal antibodies (Mab 3F3 and Mab 2B4) specific for asparagine synthetase (EC 6.3.1.1) were used for electroporation into HeLa, HT-5, and L5178Y D10/R (L-asparaginase-resistant) cells. The conditions were optimized so that the viability of the electroporated cells was very high (80-90%), and 90% of the viable cells had antibody incorporated. Electropermeabilized cells were structurally intact, and the high voltage electric pulse had no inhibitory effect on overall cellular DNA and protein synthesis. Incorporated immunoglobulins showed unaltered structural integrity and were functionally active. L5178Y D10/R cells incorporated with an antibody (Mab 3F3) known to be a potent inhibitor of tumor asparagine synthetase showed increased dependence on an exogenous source of asparagine in the culture medium, while the growth of cells incorporated with a control (noninhibitory) antibody (Mab 2B4) remained unaffected. These studies demonstrate that electroporation can be employed successfully for large scale transfer of antibodies into cultured mammalian cells for the study of cellular metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1570872125,"Diphtheria toxin (DTx) is an extremely potent inhibitor of protein synthesis. Cell death has been generally accepted as a straightforward effect of translation inhibition. Using human U937 cells, we found that DTx intoxication leads to cytolysis; indeed, release of 51Cr- and 75Se-labeled proteins could be detected within 7 h. However, little or no cell lysis was observed over a 20-50-h period when human U937 cells were exposed to cycloheximide, amino acid-deficient medium, or metabolic poisons even though protein synthesis was rapidly inhibited to levels observed with DTx. Likewise, investigations with human K562 cells revealed full resistance to the cytolytic action of DTx over a 50-h period despite a severe reduction in translation activity. These observations establish that inhibition of protein synthesis per se is not sufficient to provoke cell lysis. A characterization of DTx-induced cytolysis revealed a long lag period (6-7 h) which could be shortened considerably by a short exposure to low pH. NH4Cl and metabolic poisons blocked the cytolytic action of DTx, indicating that endocytic uptake of toxin is required for lytic activity. Surprisingly, DTx also induced extensive internucleosomal degradation of cellular DNA, a characteristic feature of apoptosis or programmed cell death. DNA-fragmentation preceded cell lysis and did not occur in DTx-treated K562 cells or in U937 cells that were treated with the other protein synthesis inhibitors. From these observations, we conclude that DTx-mediated cytolysis is not a simple consequence of translation inhibition and that internucleosomal DNA fragmentation is a newly identified and relatively early step in the cytolytic pathway of DTx."
https://openalex.org/W1593631074,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) is the etiological agent of adult T-cell leukemia. The 3' end of HTLV-I proviral DNA encodes the synthesis of two regulatory proteins, tax and rex. The 40-kDa tax protein is a nuclear protein which positively stimulates transcription from the U3 region of the viral long terminal repeat sequence. Three 21-base pair sequences in the U3 region have been found to serve as the cis-element for tax-mediated trans-activation. We now report that the tax protein can trans-activate HTLV-I LTR in the absence of de novo cellular protein synthesis. Saturated mutagenesis of the 21-base pair repeat sequence showed that specific mutations clustered in sequences homologous to the cAMP responsive element (TGACGTCA) abolish trans-activation by tax. Furthermore, although the TGACGTCN element is nearly palindromic, the mutations that abolish trans-activation are localized exclusively in the 5' 6 bases, suggesting the orientation of this element may play a role in transcription. That the purified tax protein does not bind the 21-base pair repeats or nonspecific DNA lends further support to the notion that tax protein does not directly interact with the 21-base pair repeats to activate transcription. Instead, tax most likely acts via cellular transcriptional factor(s) to bring about trans-activation."

https://openalex.org/W1489042738,"Abstract Amplification of the H region has been previously observed in methotrexate (MTX)-resistant strains of Leishmania major and in unselected laboratory stocks of L. tarentolae. We now show that selection of L. major with the structurally unrelated drugs primaquine or terbinafine generated resistant lines exhibiting H region amplification and 23- and 12-fold cross-resistance to MTX, respectively. These and other drug-resistant lines bearing H region amplification also exhibited weak cross-resistance to primaquine and terbinafine, associating the amplified H region with pleiotropic resistance to MTX and other drugs. In contrast, lines selected for chloroquine or pentamidine resistance did not show H region amplification or this pattern of drug cross-resistance. The primaquine- and terbinafine-selected lines exhibited wild-type levels of dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase and normal uptake and accumulation of MTX, and the MTX resistance of these lines was not reversed by verapamil. These data suggest that the mechanism of MTX cross-resistance associated with H region amplification is novel and distinct from that mediated by overexpression of MDR genes in multidrug-resistant mammalian cells. Structural studies indicated that the amplified H region DNA in these L. major lines was largely (possibly exclusively) extra-chromosomal and consisted of circular inverted repeats joined at two DNA rearrangement junctions. Southern blot analyses showed that these rearrangement junctions were identical in four independent cell lines, suggesting that these sites are hotspots for DNA rearrangement. H region amplification in all of these lines was conservative, defined as retention of the chromosomal H region locus without structural alteration or reduction in copy number. This finding is consistent with an over-replication/recombination model for amplification of the H region."
https://openalex.org/W1480251615,"Abstract Highly purified lysosomal membrane vesicles, obtained from rat liver lysosomes, were used to study characteristics of NeuAc transport across the lysosomal membrane. Uptake of [14C]NeuAc was found to be strongly influenced by a pH gradient across the membrane. When a proton gradient (pHin greater than pHout) was generated by impermeable buffers, NeuAc uptake above equilibrium level (overshoot) was observed. The influence of membrane diffusion potentials was ruled out by experiments where K+ and valinomycin were present. The overshoot appeared to be specifically produced by protons, since gradients of other cations (Na+ and K+) did not give stimulation. Proton-driven uptake was saturable (Kt = 0.24 mM) and mediated by a single system, as shown by linearity of the Scatchard plot. Stimulation of transport was also obtained by preincubation of vesicles with MgATP and the effect was blocked by 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, but not by the protonophore carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazone. Monocarboxylic sugars like glycuronic acids were competitive inhibitors of sialic acid transport. Transstimulation of [14C] NeuAc uptake was observed when vesicles were preloaded either with unlabeled NeuAc or with glucuronic acid. The data demonstrate that lysosomal membrane vesicles from rat liver are a suitable system for kinetic studies of solute transport events. The presence of a proton-driven carrier in the lysosomal membrane specific for sialic acid and other acidic sugars, including glucuronic acid, is shown. The possible physiological significance of these findings for the human lysosomal carrier and the patients with a sialic acid transport defect is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1558434341,"Abstract The rat preprotachykinin I gene mRNA is alternatively spliced to yield three different mRNA species differing in their protein coding regions. We have produced recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing alpha-, beta-, and gamma-preprotachykinin to examine the tachykinin-related peptides produced upon post-translational processing of each individual precursor. Infection of BSC-40 or AtT-20 cell lines with a beta-preprotachykinin-encoding vaccinia virus recombinant results in the expression of the precursor protein. The pro-form (signal peptide removed) can be immunoprecipitated from extracts of infected cells. Infected cells of both types secrete into the culture medium a product(s) which reacts in radioimmunoassay with an antiserum shown to recognize precursor as well as mature substance P. Infected AtT-20, but not BSC-40, cells secrete into the culture medium a processed form(s) of beta-preprotachykinin which reacts in radioimmunoassay with an anti-serum which recognizes the amidated carboxyl terminus of substance P. The molecular nature of the tachykinin products produced in and secreted from AtT-20 cells infected with alpha-, beta-, and gamma-preprotachykinin-encoding recombinants was analyzed by combined high performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay. Peptides were identified based on comigration with synthetic standards and antisera cross-reactivity. We determined that alpha-preprotachykinin is processed to the mature undecapeptide, substance P. beta-Preprotachykinin was processed into multiple products, including substance P, neurokinin A, neurokinin A(3-10), and neuropeptide K. gamma-Preprotachykinin was processed into substance P, neurokinin A, neurokinin A(3-10), and neuropeptide gamma. These five tachykinin peptide products were all routed through the regulated secretory pathway and were secreted into the medium in a cAMP-stimulatable fashion. Since all of these peptides have been shown to be biologically active, it is important to consider the biological consequences of their co-secretion in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1569789584,"Endocytosis of 125I-mannose-bovine serum albumin (BSA) and exocytosis of 125I-mannose-poly-D-lysine by rabbit alveolar macrophages were examined as a function of temperature. A plot for total ligand uptake (cell-associated ligand plus degraded ligand) versus time shows a single inflection point at 20 degrees C. Ligand degradation does not occur below 20 degrees C. Internalization of surface-bound 125I-mannose-BSA is negligible below 10 degrees C. The rate constant for internalization increases dramatically above 20 degrees C: 0.02 min-1 at 20 degrees C, 0.05 min-1 at 25 degrees C, 0.13 min-1 at 30 degrees C, and 0.29 min-1 at 35 degrees C. 125I-Mannose-N-acetyl-poly-D-lysine preloaded in lysosomes is exocytosed in a temperature and time-dependent fashion. Even at lower temperatures (2-10 degrees C), secretion of 125I-mannose-N-acetyl-poly-D-lysine was detected, indicating that movement of lysosomal content to plasma membrane and beyond cannot be suppressed at these temperatures. Thus, the temperature dependence of exocytosis of an 125I-labeled ligand is quite different from that of endocytosis, suggesting that the two processes are controlled by different mechanisms. Stimulation of secretion of preloaded 125I-mannose-N-acetyl-poly-D-lysine by mannose-BSA was more pronounced at lower temperatures with a sharp inflection point at 10 degrees C. These findings suggest that endosomes containing newly internalized mannose-BSA interact with the exocytosis pathway and enhance secretion of 125I-mannose-N-acetyl-poly-D-lysine from lysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1970892357,"It has long been an open question whether individual rod receptors in the mammalian retina show any light adaptation. The prevailing evidence so far has suggested that these cells, unlike those in lower vertebrates, adapt little if at all. The experiments on cat rods reported here, however, indicate that this is not really true. Since the cone system in the cat retina has a fairly high light threshold, the rods also need to adapt so that they do not saturate with light before the cones fully take over vision at higher light intensities. In similar experiments, adaptation was found in rods of other mammalian species, including primates."
https://openalex.org/W1511075716,"The proximal promoter of the human H4 histone gene F0108 contains two in vivo protein binding domains, sites I and II. In this report we show that these sequences interact with three nuclear factors: HiNF-D, HiNF-C, and HiNF-A. HiNF-C is a metal ion-requiring protein that binds to an Sp1 consensus binding site. HiNF-C and HiNF-A bind independently to the distally located site I, possibly in conjunction with other proteins, and deletion of site I reduces transcription rates 4- to 6-fold in vitro. Factor HiNF-D binds to an H4 histone-specific element (5'-dGGTPyPyTCAATCNG-GTCCG, where Py indicates pyrimidine) present in site II that has previously been shown to be essential for in vivo expression of this H4 histone gene. All three binding activities are present in human HeLa S3 cells throughout the cell cycle and in exponentially growing mouse C127 and human HL60 cells. This result is consistent with the transcription of H4 histone genes throughout the cell cycle. However, unlike HiNF-A and HiNF-C, HiNF-D is not present in terminally differentiated HL60 cells, in which histone gene transcription is down-regulated. These findings suggest a crucial role for HiNF-D, with an auxiliary role for HiNF-C and possibly HiNF-A, in the regulation of H4 histone gene transcription. Furthermore, the conservation of potential HiNF-D binding sites in mammalian H4 histone gene promoters suggests that HiNF-D has an essential role in the coordinate transcriptional down-regulation of the H4 histone multigene subfamily during the shutdown of proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1575986179,"Abstract Inhibition of protein synthesis initiation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates occurs in response to a variety of conditions including heme deficiency, addition of oxidants, and heat stress. The inhibition of translation occurs due to the activation of a heme-regulated protein kinase (HRI), which specifically phosphorylates the alpha-subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF-2. How the activation of HRI in hemin-supplemented lysate occurs in response to oxidants and heat stress is not well understood. Recently, the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp 90) has been reported to co-purify with HRI activity. In this report, we have used monoclonal antibodies directed against hsp 90 to determine whether HRI and hsp 90 are functionally associated in the reticulocyte lysate in situ. The AC88 antibody recognizes only free hsp 90 and only bound significant amounts of hsp 90 upon prolonged incubation in the absence of heme or upon N-ethylmaleimide treatment of hemin-supplemented lysates. HRI activity is not absorbed by the AC88 antibody. The 8D3 monoclonal antibody, which binds to both free hsp 90 and hsp 90 complexed to steroid hormone receptors, absorbed the hsp 90 present in hemin-supplemented lysates and reduced the HRI activity by 70-95%. Progressively more HRI activity is not adsorbed by the 8D3 antibody the longer the reticulocyte lysate is incubated in the absence of hemin. The HRI that is adsorbed from heme-deficient lysates by the 8D3 antibody is also more active. The sedimentation rate of HRI was analyzed by glycerol gradient centrifugation. HRI present in hemin-supplemented lysate was found to have a sedimentation coefficient of approximately 7.5-8 S and was adsorbed from fractions by the 8D3 antibody in association with hsp 90. A second peak of HRI activity with a sedimentation coefficient of approximately 4.5-5 S was detected upon glycerol gradient centrifugation of heme-deficient lysates. Upon Western blot analysis, heme-deficient lysates were found to have less hsp 90 in the 7.5-8 S region of glycerol gradients than hemin-supplemented lysates. The data suggest that HRI is associated with hsp 90 in an inactive form in hemin-supplemented lysates and dissociates from hsp 90 upon activation. There also appears to be an intermediate of active HRI which is associated with hsp 90 or which can reversibly associate with hsp 90. Similarities between the stages of HRI activation and steroid hormone receptor activation and transformation are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2138852121,"In order to define the mechanisms responsible for the regulated expression of a human 90-kDa heat shock protein (HSP90) gene, we have determined the complete genomic sequence of the gene encoding HSP90 beta, including 1102 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site. This gene consists of 12 exons and 11 introns. The exons range in size from 99 to 396 base pairs and the introns range from 91 to 1433 base pairs. Analysis of the 5' promoter region revealed TATA and CAAT consensus sequences. Additionally, Sp1 factor binding sites and presumptive heat shock element consensus sequences were found surrounding the transcription initiation site. Three out of the six identified potential heat shock elements reside within the first intron. The ability of the promoter region to respond to heat shock was examined by constructing a plasmid containing the 5' end of the HSP90 beta gene driving a neomycin phosphotransferase reporter gene. This plasmid was used to stably transform human K562 erythroleukemia cells. With heat shock, the abundance of HSP-neo transcripts increased, demonstrating that the promoter region of this gene contains the cis-acting DNA elements required for the heat shock response."
https://openalex.org/W1481327162,"Abstract Egress of free NeuAc from normal lysosome-rich granular fractions was assessed at NeuAc concentrations of up to 221 pmol/hexosaminidase unit, achieved by exposure of growing fibroblasts to 40-125 nM N-acetylmannosamine for up to 7 days. The normal velocity of NeuAc egress increased with NeuAc loading and with temperature, exhibiting a Q10 of 2.4, characteristic of carrier-mediated transport. Fibroblasts cultured from five patients with infantile free sialic acid storage disease (ISSD) contained approximately 139 nmol of free NeuAc/mg of whole cell protein, or 100 times the normal level. Differential centrifugation, as well as density gradient analysis using 25% Percoll, showed that the stored NeuAc cosedimented with the lysosomal enzyme beta-hexosaminidase. The velocity of appearance of free NeuAc outside ISSD granular fractions was negligible, even at initial loading levels of up to 3500 pmol/hexosaminidase unit. The lack of egress from ISSD granular fractions was found for both endogenous and N-acetylmannosamine-derived NeuAc. Fibroblasts from ISSD parents did not accumulate excess free NeuAc and did not display a velocity of NeuAc egress significantly different from normal. The defect in ISSD, like that in Salla disease, appears to be an impairment of carrier-mediated transport of free NeuAc across the lysosomal membrane. Clinical and biochemical differences between Salla disease and ISSD may reflect differences in the amount of residual NeuAc transport capacity."
https://openalex.org/W1596601112,"Abstract The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor from Torpedo sp. occurs as a dimer, disulfide-cross-linked between delta subunits. We determined the sidedness of the COOH terminus of the acetylcholine receptor delta subunit by locating the delta-delta disulfide relative to the membrane and by identifying the Cys residue forming the disulfide. We used receptor-rich native membrane vesicles isolated from Torpedo californica electric tissue and characterized as to orientation and intactness. These vesicles had not been extracted and retained v (43-kDa protein) as a marker of the cytoplasmic surface. Using the reduction of v as an assay of permeability, we showed that two reductants, 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate and reduced glutathione, were relatively impermeant. Both of these reductants reduced the delta-delta disulfide in sealed right-side-out vesicles equally in the presence and absence of saponin, and 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate reduced this disulfide equally in the presence and absence of Triton X-100. By contrast, surfactants enhanced the reduction of dimer in inside-out and sequestered vesicles. We conclude that the disulfide is extracellular. To identify the Cys residue forming the disulfide, we labeled the sulfhydryls both in receptor dimer and in monomer generated by mild reduction of dimer. By high performance liquid chromatography and NH2-terminal sequencing of cyanogen bromide fragments of labeled delta-delta dimer and delta monomer, we found that the penultimate residue, delta-Cys-500, uniquely formed an intersubunit disulfide and that this disulfide was uniquely reduced when receptor dimer was reduced to monomer. Therefore, the delta COOH terminus is extracellular."
https://openalex.org/W1590267007,"Abstract A high molecular mass aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex has been isolated from a murine erythroleukemia cell line. This multienzyme complex contains activities for the arginyl-, aspartyl-, glutamyl-, glutaminyl-, isoleucyl,- leucyl-, lysyl-, methionyl-, and prolyl-tRNA synthetases. This enzyme composition, the polypeptide pattern observed upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the relative stoichiometry of the component polypeptides are characteristic of high molecular mass complexes of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases isolated from a variety of mammalian tissues and cell types. Negatively stained preparations of native complex and of glutaraldehyde-treated material have been examined by electron microscopy. In both cases, a distinctive particle is observed which appears in several orientations. The most common views are of two different projections of a squarish particle that measures approximately 27 x 27 nm. Other commonly observed views are of a shape, a rectangle, and a triangle. All of these views are seen in both gradient-purified samples and those prepared directly from material as isolated. These data are consistent with a model for the multienzyme aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex as a cup or elongated U structure. These studies demonstrate that the high molecular mass complex of eukaryotic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases does have a coherent structure that can be visualized by electron microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W1674775418,"The quantitation of intracellular sodium ion concentration [Na+]in perfused organs using NMR spectroscopy requires a knowledge of the extent of visibility of the 23Na resonance and of the intracellular volume of the organ. We have used a multinuclear NMR approach, in combination with the extracellular shift reagent dysprosium (III) tripolyphosphate, to determine the NMR visibility of intra- and extracellular 23Na and 35Cl ions, intracellular volume, and [Na+]in in the isolated Langendorff perfused rat heart. Based on a comparison of the extracellular volumes calculated using 2H and 23Na, 35Cl, or 59Co NMR of the perfused heart we conclude that resonances of extracellular sodium and chloride ions (including ions in interstitial spaces) are fully visible, contrary to assumptions in the literature. Furthermore, prolonged hypoxia or ischemia caused a dramatic increase in intracellular Na+ and [Na+] in rose to approach that in the external medium indicating full visibility of the intracellular 23Na resonance. Resonance intensities of intra- and extracellular 23Na ions, along with a knowledge of the extracellular space as a fraction of the total organ water space, yielded an average [Na+] in of about 10 mM (10 +/- 1.5 mM) for the rat heart at 37 degrees C. Double-quantum filtered 23Na NMR of the perfused rat heart in the absence and presence of paramagnetic reagents revealed, contrary to assumptions in the literature, that both intra- and extracellular sodium ions contribute to the detected signal."
https://openalex.org/W1604136203,"Diphtheria toxin contains a trypsin-sensitive region with 3 closely spaced arginines in the sequence (Asn189, Arg190, Val191, Arg192, Arg193, Ser194). Cleavage of the toxin to yield A- and B-fragments (nicking) appears to occur in a stochastic manner after either of these arginine residues. Isoelectric focusing of A-fragment prepared in vitro showed four bands of varying intensity with pI between 4.5 and 5.0, three of which could be accounted for by the three different cleavage sites. Exposure of cells with surface-bound toxin to pH less than 5.3 induces translocation of A-fragment to a position where it is shielded from external Pronase, presumably in the cytosol. A-fragment translocated in this manner had the same pI as the most acidic A-fragments, indicating that only A-fragments lacking both Arg192 and Arg193 are translocation-competent. This was confirmed by amino acid sequencing. Treatment of A-fragment with carboxypeptidase B eliminated the two bands with the highest pI while there was a concomitant increase in the bands corresponding to the two most acidic A-fragments. Such treatment of nicked diphtheria toxin increased the amount of translocated A-fragment and the ability of toxin to form cation-selective pores in the cell membrane. The site of trypsin cleavage therefore appears to be one of the factors limiting toxin entry to the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1545821492,"Abstract The 100-kDa heat shock protein, HSP100, was purified from mouse lymphoma cells. Amino acid sequences of three peptide fragments which were obtained from the purified protein by lysylendopeptidase digestion were completely or nearly identical with those of a mouse endoplasmic reticulum protein, ERp99, of a hamster glucose-regulated protein, GRP94, and of a chicken heat shock protein, HSP108, all of which have been known to have strong homology with the 90-kDa heat shock protein, HSP90. HSP100 bound to actin filaments and an apparent Kd for the binding was determined to be 8 x 10(-7) M in 2 mM MgCl2 + 100 mM KCl. Calmodulin inhibited the binding in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Equilibrium gel filtration demonstrated that HSP100 has an ability to bind to calmodulin only in the presence of Ca2+. Moreover, HSP100 competed with HSP90 for binding to actin filaments. These results together with our previous findings that HSP90 and HSP100 have similar physicochemical properties (Koyasu, S., Nishida, E., Kadowaki, T., Matsuzaki, F., Iida, K., Harada, F., Kasuga, M., Sakai, H., and Yahara, I. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 83, 8054-8058) and HSP90 is a calmodulin-regulated actin-binding protein (Nishida, E., Koyasu, S., Sakai, H., and Yahara, I. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 16033-16036), strongly suggest that HSP100 is structurally and functionally related to HSP90."
https://openalex.org/W1570521579,"Ascorbic acid requirements for norepinephrine biosynthesis were investigated in intact bovine chromaffin granules using the physiologic substrate dopamine and a novel coulometric electrochemical detection high pressure liquid chromatography system for ascorbic acid. 10 mM external dopamine, 1 mM Mg-ATP, and 1 mM ascorbic acid produced maximal norepinephrine biosynthesis without granule lysis. When external ascorbic acid was omitted, intragranular ascorbic acid was consumed in a 1:1 ratio with respect to norepinephrine biosynthesis. The initial concentration of intragranular ascorbic acid was 10.5 mM, which was depleted in stepwise fashion to 15 lower concentrations over the range of 9.2-0.2 mM. Chromaffin granules containing these varying concentrations of intragranular ascorbic acid were then incubated with 1 mM exogenous ascorbic acid, and norepinephrine biosynthesis from dopamine was determined. The apparent Km of norepinephrine biosynthesis for intragranular ascorbic acid was 0.57 mM by Eadie-Hofstee analysis and 0.68 mM by Lineweaver-Burk analysis. These data indicate that intragranular ascorbic acid is available and required for norepinephrine biosynthesis, that ascorbic acid is a true co-substrate for dopamine beta-monooxygenase, and that intragranular ascorbic acid is maintained by extragranular ascorbic acid. Continued norepinephrine biosynthesis in granules is dependent on both intragranular and extragranular concentrations of the vitamin. Furthermore, in situ kinetics of dopamine beta-monooxygenase for ascorbic acid may be most accurately determined using intact granules and the true physiologic substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1512811424,"Two glucuronic acid-containing glycosphingolipids were purified from larvae of the green-bottle fly, Lucilia caesar by DEAE-Sephadex and Iatrobeads column chromatography. Structures of these acidic glycolipids, glycolipids X and Y, were elucidated by means of sugar analysis, permethylation, enzymatic hydrolysis, negative-ion fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, and NMR studies. Glycolipid X was determined to have the following structure: GlcA beta 1-3Gal beta 1-3GalNAc alpha 1-4 GalNAc beta 1-4 GlcNAc beta 1-3Man beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1 ceramide. The other acidic glycolipid, glycolipid Y contains a phosphoethanolamine residue linked through the 6-hydroxy group of the N-acetyl-glucosamine unit of glycolipid X. The ceramide moieties were composed of saturated fatty acids (16:0-22:0) and tetradeca- and hexadeca-4-sphingenines. Based on the structural similarity of the ceramide moieties it appears likely that glycolipid X is an intermediate from which glycolipid Y is synthesized by addition of a phosphoethanolamine residue."

https://openalex.org/W1518642767,"Previous analyses of glycolytic metabolites in Artemia embryos indicate that an acute inhibition of glucose phosphorylation occurs during pHi-mediated metabolic arrest under anoxia. We describe here kinetic features of hexokinase purified from brine shrimp embryos in an attempt to explain the molecular basis for this inhibition. At saturating concentrations of cosubstrate, ADP is an uncompetitive inhibitor toward glucose and a partial noncompetitive inhibitor toward ATP (Kis = 0.86 mM, Kii = 1.0 mM, Kid = 1.9 mM). With cosubstrates at subsaturating concentrations, the uncompetitive inhibition versus glucose becomes noncompetitive, while inhibition versus ATP remains partial noncompetitive. The partial noncompetitive inhibition of ADP versus ATP is characterized by a hyperbolic intercept replot. These product inhibition patterns are consistent with a random mechanism of enzyme action that follows the preferred order of glucose binding first and glucose-6-P dissociating last. We propose that inhibition by glucose-6-P (Kis = 65 microM) occurs primarily by competing with ATP at the active site, resulting in the formation of the dead-end complex, enzyme-glucose-glucose-6-P. Versus glucose, inhibition by glucose-6-P is uncompetitive at pH 8.0 and noncompetitive at pH 6.8. Over a physiologically relevant pH range of 8.0 to 6.8 alterations in Km and Ki values do not account for the reduction in glucose phosphorylation, and no evidence suggests that Artemia hexokinase activity is modulated by reversible binding to intracellular structures. Total aluminum in the embryos is 4.01 +/- 0.36 micrograms/g dry weight, or, based upon tissue hydration, 72 microM. This concentration of aluminum dramatically reduces enzyme activity at pH values less than 7.2, even in the presence of physiological metal ion chelators (citrate, phosphate). When pH, aluminum, citrate, phosphate, substrates, and products were maintained at cellular levels measured under anoxia, we can account for a 90% inhibition of hexokinase relative to activity under control (aerobic) conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1635028622,"We report here that the 64-base pair (bp) guanine-rich polypurine:polypyrimidine tract derived from the right end of the rat long interspersed DNA element is reactive in a supercoil-dependent manner with a variety of chemical probes of non-B DNA structure. At pH 5.0 in the presence of Mg2+, part of the sequence (position 10-40) forms the following two types of triplexes: a G.G.C triplex, and an unusual C.G.C triplex. The latter structure is much more prevalent than the former and is unusual in that the resultant free purine strand forms a hairpin loop. In the absence of Mg2+ the G.G.C triplex disappears and the amount of C.G.C triplex is diminished, and at pH 7.5 in the presence or absence of Mg2+, little or no triplex is observed. Deletion of the 24-bp region just 3' of the triplex-forming region greatly reduces the amount of triplex formed. In this region, which includes an 18-bp polypurine:polypyrimidine sequence, both strands exhibit a moderate symmetric reactivity with the chemical probes tested, independent of pH and Mg2+. The implications of this structurally complex region for the properties of the rat L1 element are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1564126555,"The kidney is the principal physiologic site of production of biologically active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1 α-hydroxylase (1-OHase) activity found in renal mitochondria is under tight hormonal control. Parathyroid hormone stimulates the renal conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in young animals, which is accompanied by dephosphorylation of ferredoxin (Fx), a component of the mitochondrial 1-OHase enzyme complex (Siegel, N., Wongsurawat, N., and Armbrecht, H. J. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 16998–17003). The present study investigates the capacity of Fx to be phosphorylated in vitro and to modulate the 1-OHase activity of a reconstituted system. Fx was phosphorylated by renal mitochondrial type II protein kinase. Phosphorylation did not alter Fx mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels but did decrease the pI as measured by isoelectric focusing. Amino acid analysis demonstrated that 1 mol of serine and 1 mol of threonine were phosphorylated per mol of Fx. Peptide mapping of phosphorylated Fx was consistent with phosphorylation of serine 88 and threonine 85 or 97. Fx was selectively dephosphorylated by rabbit skeletal muscle protein phosphatase C2 but not C1. Phosphorylation of Fx significantly inhibited the 1-OHase activity of a reconstituted system consisting of Fx reductase, Fx, and renal mitochondrial cytochrome P-450. These findings suggest that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Fx may play a role in modulating renal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production."
https://openalex.org/W1603882405,"Abstract A putative processing enzyme for proenkephalin, with activity directed toward basic residues, was purified over 2000-fold from washed bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin granule membranes. The molecular mass of this membrane-bound adrenal trypsin-like enzyme (mATLE) is 31 kDa as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the enzyme is extremely basic, binding to carboxymethyl-Sephadex at pH 8.5. The pH optimum of mATLE using t-butoxycarbonyl-Glu-Lys-Lys-aminomethylcoumarin as a substrate is 8.5-8.7, and its Km value for this substrate is 2.2 mM. mATLE activity was inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor, lima bean trypsin inhibitor, and aprotinin but not by metal chelators or thiol-directed reagents. Sequencing of cleavage products released from Peptide B revealed that the enzyme preferentially cleaves between and following the paired basic residues at positions 23 and 24 of Peptide B (thus generating [Met-enkephalin]-Arg-Phe and Arg-[Met-enkephalin]-Arg-Phe). Dynorphin A was cleaved following a single lysine at position 11 but not at the paired arginine site. Our results suggest that mATLE is a trypsin-like serine protease with the specificity appropriate to that of a proenkephalin processing enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1673249540,"(+)-Pinene cyclase from sage (Salvia officinalis) catalyzes the isomerization and cyclization of geranyl pyrophosphate to (+)-alpha-pinene and (+)-camphene, and to lesser amounts of (+)-limonene, myrcene, and terpinolene, whereas (-)-pinene cyclase from this tissue catalyzes the conversion of the acyclic precursor to (-)-alpha-pinene, (-)-beta-pinene, and (-)-camphene, and to lesser quantities of (-)-limonene, myrcene, and terpinolene. The bicyclic products of these enzymes (pinene and camphene) are derived via the cyclization of the cisoid, anti-endo-conformers of the bound, tertiary allylic intermediates (3R)-linalyl pyrophosphate [+)-pinene cyclase) and (3S)-linalyl pyrophosphate [-)-pinene cyclase). When challenged with either enantiomer of linalyl pyrophosphate or with neryl pyrophosphate (cis-isomer of geranyl pyrophosphate) as substrate, both pinene cyclases synthesize disproportionately high levels of acyclic olefins (myrcene and ocimene) and monocyclic olefins (limonene and terpinolene), compared with the product mixtures generated from the natural geranyl precursor. Resolution of the limonene derived from linalyl pyrophosphate and neryl pyrophosphate demonstrated that this monocyclic olefin was formed via conformational foldings in addition to the cisoid,anti-endo-pattern. These results indicate that the alternate substrates are ionized by the cyclases prior to their achieving the optimum orientation for bicyclization. In the case of geranyl pyrophosphate, a preassociation mechanism is suggested in which optimum folding of the terpenyl chain precedes the initial ionization step."
https://openalex.org/W1510640413,"Neonatal rat aortic smooth muscle cell cultures produce two major soluble elastin molecules termed protropoelastin (77 kDa) and tropoelastin (71 kDa). Cell layer extracts are protroproelastin-enriched, while protropoelastin, tropoelastin, and significant amounts of discrete elastin fragments (Mr of 66,000, 61,000, 56,000, and 45,000) are present in preparations from the medium of these cultures. To determine the role of the various elastin molecules in the metabolism of elastin in neonatal rat aortic smooth muscle cell cultures, the amino termini of these proteins were sequenced. All soluble elastin components present in the medium were purified as a single peak by high performance liquid chromatography; further separation of the components was achieved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotting. The bands were excised and sequenced. The amino-terminal sequences of protropoelastin, tropoelastin, and the 66-kDa, 61-kDa, and 56-kDa fragments were identical: Gly-Gly-Val-Pro-Gly-Ala-Val-Pro-Gly-Gly. This sequence is identical with published amino-terminal sequences of tropoelastins from several other species. As expected, when the cell cultures were pulsed with [3H]valine, all the soluble elastin molecules were radioactive, while only protropoelastin appeared radioactive after [35S] cysteine pulsing. Since cysteine is present only in the carboxyl-terminal end of the molecule, all the data indicate that the cleavage of the elastin fragments identified in the culture are occurring at the carboxyl end of protropoelastin. These results are consistent with the original hypothesis that a precursor-product relationship exists between the 77-kDa and 71-kDa soluble elastin molecules. Based on known tropoelastin sequences and the molecular weights of the discrete fragments, additional fragmentation of protropoelastin and/or tropoelastin most likely occurs at the lysine/alanine-enriched domains presumably involved in cross-link formation."

https://openalex.org/W1485820573,"Abstract Chloride ion (Cl-) effects on chloroperoxidase (CPO)-catalyzed peroxidation of catechol were used to probe the involvement of Cl- in CPO reactions. High concentrations of Cl- inhibit catechol peroxidation by competing with hydrogen peroxide (KI = 370 mM). However, at lower concentrations, Cl- is a linear competitive activator versus catechol (KDC = 35 mM). Addition of good halogenation substrates to the peroxidatic reaction mixture converts Cl- from a competitive activator to a competitive inhibitor. The KI (10 mM) for this halogenation substrate promoted Cl- inhibition is equivalent to the KM (11 mM) for Cl- in CPO-catalyzed halogenation reactions. During this inhibition, the halogenation substrate is consumed and, at the point where its consumption is complete, Cl- again becomes an activator. Also, at 2.0 mM hydrogen peroxide, CPOs chlorination reaction and its Cl- -activated peroxidatic reaction have similar apparent kcat values. All data are consistent with a mechanism in which Cl- competes with catechol for binding to CPO Compound I. Catechol binding initiates the Cl- -independent path, in which Compound I acts as the oxidizing agent for catechol. When Cl- binds to Compound I, it reacts to yield the enzymatic chlorinating intermediate which is responsible for either the oxidation of catechol in the Cl- -dependent path or the chlorination of substrates in the halogenation pathway. Cl- activation of the peroxidatic reaction is due to a shift from the Cl- -independent pathway to the Cl- -dependent process. The mechanism is unique in that exclusion of the substrate from its primary binding site leads to an increase in the catalytic efficiency of the reaction. This catechol-Cl- system also offers further potential for probing the specificity and chemistry of the key enzymatic intermediates in haloperoxidase-catalyzed reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1549496586,"The effect of protein synthesis inhibitors on low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene expression was examined in human skin fibroblasts. Incubations in cycloheximide led to a marked increase in LDL receptor mRNA abundance as detected by Northern or slotblot hybridization analyses. Incubation in puromycin had a similar effect. After the addition of cycloheximide, induction of LDL receptor mRNA levels was rapid (peaking between 2 and 3 h) and transient (falling to control levels by 24 h). This incubation could not be accounted for by the modest stabilization of mature LDL receptor mRNA species produced by cycloheximide and was completely abolished by concurrent addition of actinomycin D. Nuclear run-off transcription assays demonstrated increased LDL receptor gene transcription after 20-min incubations in cycloheximide. Induction of LDL receptor mRNA by cycloheximide was partially resistant to sterol suppression and was at least additive with induction produced by growth activation of cells using platelet-derived growth factors. These results indicate that inhibition of protein synthesis leads to rapid stimulation of LDL receptor gene transcription by a mechanism which is partially resistant to sterol suppression. We further conclude that early stimulation of LDL receptor gene expression associated with growth-activation of quiescent cells is independent of new protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1501180628,"The structure, biosynthesis, and distribution of cell-associated proteoglycans in a clonal line of parathyroid cells, which exhibit differentiated characteristics such as calcium-regulated hormone secretion and cell growth, were studied by metabolic labeling with (3H) glucosamine and (35S)sulfate as precursors. Proteoglycans were isolated by two consecutive ion exchange chromatography steps and then analyzed by gel filtration, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and specific enzyme and chemical reactions. The cells synthesize almost exclusively (greater than 95%) heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans with a glycosaminoglycan synthesis rate of approximately 0.5 micrograms/10(6) cells/24 h. Two major HS proteoglycan species were identified. HS proteoglycan-I has a mass of approximately kDa with a single HS chain (approximately 12 kDa) and a core protein of approximately 150 kDa including oligosaccharides. HS proteoglycan-II has a mass of approximately 170 kDa with 3-4 HS chains (approximately 30 kDa) and a core protein of 70-80 kDa including oligosaccharides. In the medium with low ionized calcium (0.05 mM), HS proteoglycan-I is synthesized at approximately 1.6 times the rate and HS proteoglycan-II at a similar rate as for cells cultured in the medium with high ionized calcium (2.1 mM). The distribution of proteoglycans, examined by the accessibility of the molecules to trypsin, was dramatically influencedmore » by environmental calcium concentration; at low calcium levels 70-80% of the HS proteoglycans are trypsin-accessible while only 20-30% are accessible at high calcium levels. This suggests that the proteoglycans are primarily on the cell surface in low calcium and in trypsin-inaccessible compartments in high calcium conditions.« less"
https://openalex.org/W1487331805,"Abstract The activity of rat liver glutaminase from sedimented fractions of freeze-thawed mitochondria is strongly affected by variation in pH over a physiologically relevant range at approximate physiological concentrations of activators. As pH increases from 7.1 to 7.7 at 0.7 mM ammonium and 10 mM phosphate, the S0.5 for glutamine decreases 3.5-fold, from 38 to 11 mM. This results in an 8-fold increase in reaction velocity at 10 mM glutamine. In addition, the M0.5 for phosphate activation decreases from 21 to 8.9 mM as pH increases from 7.1 to 7.7. This apparent effect of pH on the affinity of glutaminase for phosphate is similar to previous reports of the pH effect on activation by ammonium (Verhoeven, A. J., Van Iwaarden, J. F., Joseph, S. K., and Meijer, A. J. (1983) Eur. J. Biochem. 133, 241-244; McGivan, J. D., and Bradford, N. M. (1983) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 159, 296-302). Glutaminase does not respond to variation in pH between 7.1 and 7.7 when phosphate and ammonium are saturating. The effects of the two modifiers are additive. Each is still effective, as is pH, when the other is saturating. Therefore, it appears that the effects of pH on the apparent affinity of the enzyme for ammonium and phosphate account for the enzyme's response to pH. These results may help explain previous reports of minimal effects of pH on glutaminase at saturating concentrations of related substances (McGivan, J. D., Lacey, J. H., and Joseph, K. (1980) Biochim. J. 192, 537-542; Horowitz, M. L., and Knox, W. E. (1968) Enzymol. Biol. Clin. 9, 241-255; McGivan, J. D., and Bradford, N. M. (1983) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 759, 296-302). Glutaminase binds glutamine cooperatively with Hill coefficients ranging from 1.7 to 2.2, which suggests at least two and probably three or more interacting binding sites for glutamine. The strong response of liver glutaminase to pH and the fact that the reaction can supply metabolites for urea synthesis suggest a possible regulatory role of glutaminase in ureagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1567416586,"We have shown that purified bovine soluble dopamine β-hydroxylase can reconstitute onto preformed phosphatidylserine containing vesicles. The binding is dependent on pH and vesicle phosphatidylserine composition but does not require calcium. Reconstitution appears to be irreversible, with the lipid-bound enzyme possessing hydroxylase activity. Additionally, [14C] phosphatidylserine binds to soluble dopamine β-hydroxylase and remains bound after several detergent washes. Thus the reconstituted soluble form of the enzyme appears to be functionally analogous to the membranous form. Both the reconstitution data and the lipid binding data suggest that multiple phosphatidylserine molecules bind to the soluble hydroxylase. We propose that noncovalently bound phosphatidylserine moieties, which copurify with the membrane bound form of the enzyme, alone are responsible for anchoring membranous dopamine β-hydroxylase to chromaffin granule and model membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1493892823,"Abstract The interaction between bovine testes calmodulin and rabbit fast skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase was investigated with the zero-length cross-linking reagent N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. A cross-linked product of 110 kDa was produced only in the presence of Ca2+. The reaction mixture was separated on diethylaminoethyl cellulose, and a fraction containing the cross-linked complex of calmodulin and myosin light chain kinase was found to have an elevated kinase activity in the absence of Ca2+, which constituted approximately 50% of the maximally stimulated kinase activity of control, and additional kinase activity in the presence of Ca2+, which constituted the remaining 50% of control activity. Calmodulin added exogenously to the cross-linked complex had no effect on the measured Ca2+ dependence or the maximal extent of kinase activity, which is consistent with the cross-linking of calmodulin in close proximity to a regulatory region of myosin light chain kinase. Moreover, the results are consistent with a mechanism whereby the association of calmodulin is sufficient to stimulate kinase activity and the binding of Ca2+ to bound calmodulin increases catalytic efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1558346428,"Abstract The human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 differentiates to monocyte/macrophage cells when incubated with NADPH-linked high-Km aldehyde reductase (EC 1.1.1.2) purified from the cytosol of rat kidney. Differentiation was assessed by cell growth, morphology, adhesiveness, nitro blue tetrazolium reduction, and nonspecific esterase activity. The extent of differentiation induced by the reductase and measured at 4 days by nitro blue tetrazolium reduction is dose-dependent with an ED50 (dose required for half-maximal effect) of 71 nM. In the presence of 10 nM retinoic acid the ED50 for reductase is reduced to 18 nM and an isobologram analysis of this effect indicates that the combination is synergistic. Inactivation of the enzymatic activity is not associated with a decrease in differentiation-induced activity. These results suggest that the structure of the enzyme protein and not its enzymatic activity is involved with induction of differentiation. This view is supported by the demonstration that aldehyde reductase binds specifically to HL60 cells with a KD of 70 nM and that there are 13,000 binding sites/cell. Thus, the extent of differentiation induced by various concentrations of aldehyde reductase are directly related to the expected level of receptor occupancy."
