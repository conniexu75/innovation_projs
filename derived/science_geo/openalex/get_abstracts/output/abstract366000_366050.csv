For many electronics applications, larger areas are needed. Li et al. (p. 1312 , published online 7 May) show that graphene grows in a self-limiting way on copper films as large-area sheets (one square centimeter) from methane through a chemical vapor deposition process. The films, which are mainly one layer in thickness, can be transferred to other substrates and have electron mobilities as high as 4300 square centimeters per volt second."
https://openalex.org/W2057151160,"Little is known about the mechanisms by which breast cancer cells metastasize to the brain. Bos et al. now identify three genes that are involved in this process. COX2 and HBEGF have previously been shown to also mediate breast cancer metastasis to the lung, suggesting common biological processes that regulate dissemination to these two organs. In addition, they find that ST6GALNAC5 is specifically involved in brain metastasis, by increasing the adhesion of breast cancer cells to the brain endothelium and migration through the blood–brain barrier. Little is known about the mechanisms by which breast cancer cells metastasize to the brain. By performing gene expression analysis on cells that preferentially infiltrate the brain it has now been possible to identify three genes that are involved in this process, two of which—COX2 and HBEGF—have previously been shown to mediate breast cancer metastasis to the lung. The molecular basis for breast cancer metastasis to the brain is largely unknown1,2. Brain relapse typically occurs years after the removal of a breast tumour2,3,4, suggesting that disseminated cancer cells must acquire specialized functions to take over this organ. Here we show that breast cancer metastasis to the brain involves mediators of extravasation through non-fenestrated capillaries, complemented by specific enhancers of blood–brain barrier crossing and brain colonization. We isolated cells that preferentially infiltrate the brain from patients with advanced disease. Gene expression analysis of these cells and of clinical samples, coupled with functional analysis, identified the cyclooxygenase COX2 (also known as PTGS2), the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand HBEGF, and the α2,6-sialyltransferase ST6GALNAC5 as mediators of cancer cell passage through the blood–brain barrier. EGFR ligands and COX2 were previously linked to breast cancer infiltration of the lungs, but not the bones or liver5,6, suggesting a sharing of these mediators in cerebral and pulmonary metastases. In contrast, ST6GALNAC5 specifically mediates brain metastasis. Normally restricted to the brain7, the expression of ST6GALNAC5 in breast cancer cells enhances their adhesion to brain endothelial cells and their passage through the blood–brain barrier. This co-option of a brain sialyltransferase highlights the role of cell-surface glycosylation in organ-specific metastatic interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2001682194,"Despite enormous progress in the past few years the specific contribution of newly born granule cells to the function of the adult hippocampus is still not clear. We hypothesized that in order to solve this question particular attention has to be paid to the specific design, the analysis, and the interpretation of the learning test to be used. We thus designed a behavioral experiment along hypotheses derived from a computational model predicting that new neurons might be particularly relevant for learning conditions, in which novel aspects arise in familiar situations, thus putting high demands on the qualitative aspects of (re-)learning. In the reference memory version of the water maze task suppression of adult neurogenesis with temozolomide (TMZ) caused a highly specific learning deficit. Mice were tested in the hidden platform version of the Morris water maze (6 trials per day for 5 days with a reversal of the platform location on day 4). Testing was done at 4 weeks after the end of four cycles of treatment to minimize the number of potentially recruitable new neurons at the time of testing. The reduction of neurogenesis did not alter longterm potentiation in CA3 and the dentate gyrus but abolished the part of dentate gyrus LTP that is attributed to the new neurons. TMZ did not have any overt side effects at the time of testing, and both treated mice and controls learned to find the hidden platform. Qualitative analysis of search strategies, however, revealed that treated mice did not advance to spatially precise search strategies, in particular when learning a changed goal position (reversal). New neurons in the dentate gyrus thus seem to be necessary for adding flexibility to some hippocampus-dependent qualitative parameters of learning. Our finding that a lack of adult-generated granule cells specifically results in the animal's inability to precisely locate a hidden goal is also in accordance with a specialized role of the dentate gyrus in generating a metric rather than just a configurational map of the environment. The discovery of highly specific behavioral deficits as consequence of a suppression of adult hippocampal neurogenesis thus allows to link cellular hippocampal plasticity to well-defined hypotheses from theoretical models."
https://openalex.org/W2073449362,"Controlling Chronic Viral Infections Chronic viral infections such as HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses are major public health concerns. T cell—mediated immune responses are critical for controlling viral infections. In contrast to acute infections, chronic viral infections are characterized by “exhausted” cytotoxic CD8 + T cells, cells which exhibit reduced proliferative capacity, cytokine secretion, and cytotoxicity. Treatments that reverse exhaustion result in increased viral control. Despite their exhaustion, these CD8 + T cells eventually help to control chronic infections by killing virally infected cells, and require CD4 + T cell help to do so. How do CD4 + T cells provide help to CD8 + T cells during chronic infection (see the Perspective by Johnson and Jameson )? Elsaesser et al. (p. 1569 , published online 7 May), Yi et al. (p. 1572 , published online 14 May), and Fröhlich et al. (p. 1576 , published online 28 May) now show that the cytokine, interleukin-21 (IL-21), known to be critical for the differentiation of certain CD4 + T cell effector subsets, is an essential factor produced by CD4 + T cells that helps CD8 + T cells to control chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection in mice. Acute and chronic infections resulted in differing amounts of IL-21 production by virus-specific CD4 + T cells. CD8 + T cells required IL-21 directly, and when CD8 + T cells were unable to signal through IL-21 or IL-21 was not available, they were reduced in number, exhibited a more exhausted phenotype, and were not able to control the virus. In contrast, the absence of IL-21–dependent signaling did not affect primary CD8 + T cell responses to acute infection or responses to a viral rechallenge, suggesting that differentiation of memory CD8 + T cells is independent of IL-21."

https://openalex.org/W1972362666,"Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases have become a major global environmental problem with important public health, economic, and political consequences. The etiologic agents of most emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, and anthropogenic environmental changes that affect wildlife communities are increasingly implicated in disease emergence and spread. Although increased disease incidence has been correlated with biodiversity loss for several zoonoses, experimental tests in these systems are lacking. We manipulated small-mammal biodiversity by removing non-reservoir species in replicated field plots in Panama, where zoonotic hantaviruses are endemic. Both infection prevalence of hantaviruses in wild reservoir (rodent) populations and reservoir population density increased where small-mammal species diversity was reduced. Regardless of other variables that affect the prevalence of directly transmitted infections in natural communities, high biodiversity is important in reducing transmission of zoonotic pathogens among wildlife hosts. Our results have wide applications in both conservation biology and infectious disease management."

https://openalex.org/W2126712329,"The importance of post-transcriptional mechanisms for the regulation of the homoeostasis of the immune system and the response to challenge by microorganisms is becoming increasingly appreciated. We investigated the contribution of microRNAs (miRNAs) to macrophage activation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We first observed that Dicer knockout in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) increases the LPS-induced expression of some inflammation mediators. miRNA microarray analysis in BMDMs revealed that LPS significantly induces the expression of a single miRNA, miR-155, and this induction depends on enhanced miR-155 maturation from its precursors. The single-strand RNA-binding protein KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP) binds to the terminal loop of miR-155 precursors and promotes their maturation. Both inhibition of miR-155 and KSRP knockdown enhance the LPS-induced expression of select inflammation mediators, and the effect of KSRP knockdown is reverted by mature miR-155. Our studies unveil the existence of an LPS-dependent post-transcriptional regulation of miR-155 biogenesis. Once induced, miR-155 finely tunes the expression of select inflammation mediators in response to LPS."

Gubernator et al. (p. 1441 , published online 7 May) introduce a means to observe neurotransmitter release optically, by the design of fluorescent false neurotransmitters, which act as substrates for the synaptic vesicle monoamine transporter. These endogenous monoamine optical tracers enabled visualization of neurotransmitter uptake and release from individual synaptic terminals and were used to evaluate dopamine neurotransmission in the striatum. The fraction of synaptic vesicles that release neurotransmitter per stimulus was frequency dependent, and a frequency-dependent selection of presynaptic terminals was observed."

The current study dissects the mechanisms by which a chemokine, CCL2, induces TJ disassembly. It investigates the potential role of selective internalization of TJ transmembrane proteins (occludin and claudin-5) in increased permeability of the brain endothelial barrier in vitro. To map the internalization and intracellular fate of occludin and claudin-5, green fluorescent protein fusion proteins of these TJ proteins were generated and imaged by fluorescent microscopy with simultaneous measurement of transendothelial electrical resistance. During CCL2-induced reductions in transendothelial electrical resistance, claudin-5 and occludin became internalized via caveolae and further processed to early (EEA1+) and recycling (Rab4+) endosomes but not to late endosomes. Western blot analysis of fractions collected from a sucrose gradient showed the presence of claudin-5 and occludin in the same fractions that contained caveolin-1.

The transcellular pathway can be either passive or active and is characterized by low conductance and high selectivity. In contrast, the paracellular pathway is exclusively passive, being driven by electrochemical and osmotic gradients, and has a higher conductance and lower selectivity (3.Bazzoni G. Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 95: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).Brain endothelial barrier paracellular permeability is maintained by an equilibrium between contractile forces generated at the endothelial cytoskeleton and adhesive forces produced at endothelial cell-cell junctions and cell-matrix contacts (1.Garcia J.G. Schaphorst K.L. J. Invest. Med. 1995; 43: 117-126PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Harhaj N.S. Antonetti D.A. Int. J. Biochem.

A dynamic interaction among these structural elements controls opening and closing of the paracellular pathway and serves as a fundamental mechanism regulating blood-brain exchange. How this process occurs is under intense investigation. Two possible mechanisms may potentially increase paracellular permeability: phosphorylation of TJ proteins and/or endocytosis of transmembrane TJ proteins.Changes in TJ protein phosphorylation seem to be required to initiate increased brain endothelial permeability and a redistribution of most TJ proteins away from the cell border (4.Farshori P.

Several types of endocytosis may be involved in TJ protein uptake, including clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis (for reviews, see Refs. 8.Hommelgaard A.M. Roepstorff K.

After first forming cell membrane-derived endocytotic vesicles, these vesicles fuse with early endosomes whose contents are further sorted for transport to lysosomes for degradation or recycling back to the plasma membrane for reuse (11.Kirkham M. Parton R.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1745: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar).Although there is a lack of definitive knowledge regarding endocytotic internalization of brain endothelial cell TJ proteins, several studies on epithelial cells have indicated that occludin may be internalized via caveolae-mediated endocytosis whereas ZO-1, claudin-1, and junctional adhesion molecules-A may undergo macropinocytosis in response to stimuli such as TNF-α and INF-γ (13.Bruewer M.

In contrast, there is evidence that Ca2+ may induce internalization of claudin-1 and occludin via clathrin-coated vesicles (8.Hommelgaard A.M. Roepstorff K. Vilhardt F. Torgersen M.L.

All of these studies pinpoint endocytosis as an underlying process in TJ complex remodeling and redistribution, and thus regulation of paracellular permeability in epithelial cells.The present study examines whether internalization of transmembrane TJ proteins could be one process by which adhesion between brain endothelial cells is changed during increased paracellular permeability. Our results show that a pro-inflammatory mediator, the chemokine CCL2, induces disassembly of the TJ complex by triggering caveolae-dependent internalization of transmembrane TJ proteins (occludin and claudin-5). Once internalized, occludin and claudin-5 are further processed to recycling endosomes awaiting return to the plasma membrane.DISCUSSIONBlood-brain barrier opening during inflammatory leukocyte recruitment is still a poorly understood event. Most studies have focused on the role of the endothelial apical region in mediating leukocyte-endothelial interactions (23.Medina R. Rahner C. Mitic L.L. Anderson J.M. Van Itallie C.M. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 178: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 24.Diacovo T.G. Roth S.J. Buccola J.M. Bainton D.F. Springer T.A. Blood. 1996; 88: 146-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Ley K. Laudanna C. Cybulsky M.I. Nourshargh S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 678-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (3019) Google Scholar). There is very limited data regarding leukocyte movement between adjacent endothelial cells and the role of interendothelial junctional complexes in this process. The objective of the present study was, therefore, to investigate the effects of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) on TJ assembly and function in brain endothelial cells. We found that: (a) alterations in brain endothelial barrier permeability are associated with the internalization of two transmembrane TJ proteins, occludin and claudin-5; (b) they were internalized via a lipid raft/caveolin-1 and cholesterol-sensitive pathway; (c) internalized occludin and claudin-5 are “stored” in early as well as recycling endosomes and are available for recycling back to the cell surface; (d) recycling of “internalized” occludin and claudin-5 plays a pivotal role in re-establishing the brain endothelial barrier integrity during recovery. These findings are discussed below.Technical ConcernsBefore discussing the findings, a potential technical concern needs to be addressed: the use of GFP-tagged occludin or claudin-5 to examine TJ protein kinetics during brain endothelial barrier opening. Two potential concerns are: (a) whether overexpression of these proteins affects barrier structure and (b) whether tagged proteins behave as native occludin and claudin-5. Several studies have shown that TJ protein overexpression does not have any specific influence on the structural and functional integrity in different barrier tissues (23.Medina R. Rahner C. Mitic L.L. Anderson J.M. Van Itallie C.M. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 178: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26.Amasheh S. Meiri N. Gitter A.H. Schöneberg T. Mankertz J. Schulzke J.D.

Invest. 2001; 107: 1319-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). We also found no effect of occludin and claudin-5 overexpression on brain endothelial cell permeability properties. Using stable cell lines expressing GFP-claudin-5 and GFP-occludin, instead of transient transfection, decreases any potential transfection effect on the vesiculo-vacuolar system and endocytosis. Occludin and claudin-5 were tagged with GFP at the N-terminal to avoid disruption of physiological interactions of occludin and claudin-5 with other TJ proteins, signal molecules, and actin (22.Bamforth S.D.

Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and these proteins were found at cell borders as with endogenous claudin-5 and occludin.Experiments were performed in parallel on both primary brain endothelial cells and a brain endothelial cell line. We did not find any significant differences in cell response (TJ unsealing) during CCL2 exposure. In most of our presented results, we have shown both cell types except for the time-lapse experiments where the tagged proteins were a major advantage. The rationale for utilizing the brain endothelial cell line (bEnd.3) over primary brain endothelial cells was that bEnd.3 cells have a higher proliferative capacity and better transfection rate than primary cell cultures facilitating establishment of cells stably expressing tagged occludin and claudin-5.Caveolae-dependent Internalization of Occludin and Claudin-5 as a Mechanism Unsealing the TJ ComplexDespite their complex organization, TJs can be rapidly disassembled and reorganized in response to various extracellular stimuli. TJ protein internalization is one putative mechanism for removing these proteins from cell membranes during cell migration (endothelial and epithelial cells) or during the disassembly of an epithelial barrier (14.Utech M.

In epithelia, inflammatory mediators such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, and cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1, induce internalization of TJ transmembrane proteins, changing adhesion between adjacent epithelial cells and causing barrier disruption (13.Bruewer M.

Similarities in TJ structure and function between brain endothelial cells and epithelial cells led us to test whether occludin and claudin-5 internalization is a mechanism underlying brain endothelial barrier opening. Recent findings from our and other laboratories clearly indicate that increased brain endothelial barrier paracellular permeability is associated with redistribution of TJ proteins (7.Stamatovic S.M.

Although we do not exclude TJ protein phosphorylation as a critical component in altering adhesive interactions between the endothelial cells, some morphological (loss of continuous staining for TJ proteins at cell borders) and biochemical (redistribution from membrane to cytosolic and actin cytoskeletal fractions) evidence indicates that transmembrane TJ proteins are removed from the plasma membrane. Results in this study indicate that transmembrane TJ protein internalization is an underlying mechanism for these morphological and biochemical changes during TJ complex unsealing as well as determining the mechanisms involved in internalization of occludin and claudin-5.There is strong evidence that occludin and claudin-5 are localized in lipid rafts/caveolae. It has been suggested that such localization is probably critical for TJ complex stability (38.Yamamoto M. Ramirez S.H. Sato S. Kiyota T. Cerny R.L. Kaibuchi K. Persidsky Y. Ikezu T. Am. J.

Thus, it is not surprising that our membrane traffic analysis pointed out that caveolae/lipid raft-dependent internalization is an important mechanism for removing occludin and claudin-5 from brain endothelial borders during opening of the paracellular route.Lipid rafts/caveolae are cholesterol-sphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains (42.Nabi I.R. Le P.U. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Many studies have revealed that the depletion of cholesterol from the plasma membrane with agents such as filipin III, nistatin, or MβCD causes disruption of these structures and inhibits their functions without altering clathrin-mediated endocytosis (43.Lambert D. O'Neill C.A. Padfield P.J. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2007; 20: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 44.Chen J. Chen L. Wang G. Tang H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 2005-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, caveolae/lipid raft- and clathrin-dependent endocytosis can be distinguished by means of cholesterol sensitivity. Taking the above issues into consideration, our finding, that depletion of membrane cholesterol using either filipin III or MβCD inhibited CCL2-induced increases in brain endothelial barrier permeability and internalization of occludin and claudin-5, strongly suggests an important role for caveolae/lipid rafts in these processes. The observed inhibitory effects of MβCD could be reversed by cholesterol reconstitution.This study also found that internalization of occludin and claudin-5 requires caveolin-1 (results using siRNA knockdown of caveolin-1). Caveolin-1 is another major constituent of caveolae. Caveolin-1 is thought responsible for the invaginated flask-shaped morphology of caveolae through association with select raft domains (45.Nichols B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4707-4714Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). However, caveolin-1 is also one of the key regulators of caveolae/raft endocytosis. Together with the cholesterol results, these findings strongly support the concept that CCL2-induced internalization of occludin and claudin-5 is almost entirely mediated by caveolae/lipid rafts and dependent on caveolin-1.Our findings are in concordance with the previously reported findings for epithelial cells treated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, lymphotoxin-like inducible protein-LIGHT, INF-γ, and TNF-α (46.Poritz L.S. Garver K.I. Tilberg A.F. Koltun W.A. J. Surg. Res. 2004; 116: 14-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 47.Schwarz B.T. Wang F. Shen L. Clayburgh D.R. Su L. Wang Y. Fu Y.X. Turner J.R. Gastroenterology. 2007; 132: 2383-2394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). On the other hand, there is recent evidence that junctional molecules, Ve-cadheins and β-catenin, could be internalized by the clathrin-dependent pathway during the opening of the paracellular route induced by vascular epidermal growth factor (8.Hommelgaard A.M. Roepstorff K. Vilhardt F. Torgersen M.L. Sandvig K. van Deurs, B. Traffic. 2005; 6: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 48.Gavard J. Gutkind J.S. Nat.

Cell. 2005; 16: 5141-5151Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Apparently, the type of internalization of junctional molecules during the forming of paracellular route greatly depends on cell type, type of stimuli, as well as the localization of junctional molecules on the specific membrane microdomains.Another possibility is that, under certain conditions, there may be cross-talk between different internalization pathways and involvement of one or more endocytotic pathway (i.e. caveolin and clathrin internalization). Because sorting of internalized proteins was via EEA1 vesicles, it is necessary to note that “classic” caveolae-dependent internalization does not perfectly fit the process described in this study (42.Nabi I.R. Le P.U. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Further investigation is needed to define this pathway as well as the degree of cell and stimulus specificity.Finally, it is important to address the controversy over the role of caveolin-1 in regulating vascular permeability. There are studies showing that inhibiting caveolae formation by knocking down caveolin-1 with siRNA or gene deletion can increase vascular permeability rather than, as in our study, acting as a stabilization factor (50.Jasmin J.F. Malhotra S. Singh Dhallu M. Mercier I. Rosenbaum D.M. Lisanti M.P. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 51.Lin M.I. Yu J. Murata T. Sessa W.C.

A possible explanation for these discrepancies could be that the absence of caveolin-1, a major component of caveolae, may shift internalization to another pathway (e.g. clathrin-dependent) (53.D'Alessio A. Al-Lamki R.S. Bradley J.R. Pober J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 166: 1273-1282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). There is also the possibility that other caveolin proteins (caveolin-2 or -3) can be expressed as a “compensatory mechanism,” even in cells that do not normally have significant levels of these proteins (54.Shakirova Y. Bonnevier J. Albinsson S. Adner M. Rippe B. Broman J. Arner A. Swärd K. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2006; 291: C1326-C1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 55.Park D.S. Woodman S.E.

Pathol. 2002; 160: 2207-2217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Persistent vascular hyperpermeability, even in basal conditions, in caveolin KO mice could be the aftermath of a lack of caveolin-1 signaling during the biogenesis of TJ complexes. Such signaling has been shown to play a pivotal role by several studies (56.Yu J. Bergaya S. Murata T. Alp I.F. Bauer M.P. Lin M.I. Drab M. Kurzchalia T.V. Stan R.V. Sessa W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1284-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 57.Murata T. Lin M.I. Huang Y. Yu J. Bauer P.M. Giordano F.J. Sessa W.C. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 2373-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Thus, caveolin-1 and caveolae-dependent endocytosis plays a pivotal role in biogenesis and dynamic changes in the TJ complex. Stimulus type, exposure duration, cell type, and the specific microenvironment are potential factors determining the role of caveolin-1 in TJ regulation, and this needs further investigation.Fate of Internalized Endothelial TJ Proteins, Occludin and Claudin-5The current study examined whether internalized occludin and claudin-5 are degraded or recycled back to the cell surface. Recycling of internalized TJ proteins has been shown in dynamic situations where contacts between epithelial or endothelial cells must be rapidly broken and remade (12.Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 34.Hopkins A.M. Walsh S.V. Verkade P. Boquet P. Nusrat A. J.

Cell. 2006; 17: 2465-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast, some recent studies have shown that down-regulation of cell-cell adhesion and/or permanent disturbance of junctional complexes is associated with TJ protein degradation (6.Haorah J. Ramirez S.H. Schall K. Smith D. Pandya R. Persidsky Y. J. Neurochem. 2007; 101: 566-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 36.Schreibelt G. Kooij G. Reijerkerk A. van Doorn R.

Our findings on the localization and timing of TJ protein internalization in CCL2-treated brain endothelial cells and recovery experiments clearly indicate that occludin and claudin-5 undergo recycling. We have found no evidence that internalized TJ proteins undergo degradation or that any mechanism other than recycling contributes to TJ complex recovery. Considering the role of CCL2 during inflammation, the effects of this chemokine on TJ protein endocytosis could play a pivotal role in supporting leukocyte entry into brain by allowing paracellular route formation. Recycling of TJ proteins back to the plasma membrane would allow resealing after leukocyte entry.Finally, we would like to address the issue of whether brain endothelial and epithelial cells show similar mechanisms of paracellular route opening. Although both cell types express claudins, the type of expression, e.g. claudin-5 versus claudin 1, 2, and 4 (1.Garcia J.G. Schaphorst K.L. J. Invest. Med. 1995; 43: 117-126PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Harhaj N.S. Antonetti D.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1206-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 3.Bazzoni G. Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 95: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and their response to stimuli can differ. Brain endothelial cells and epithelial cells show differences in response to inflammatory mediators. For example, there are temporal and spatial differences in the Ca2+ response to TNF-α, INF-γ, and interleukin-8 (60.Deli M.A. Abrahám C.S. Kataoka Y. Niwa M. Cell. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2032367884,"Reflex circuits are carefully and specifically formed between sensory and motor neurons based on the class of sensory cell and the muscle type innervated by the motor neuron. Pecho-Vrieseling et al. now report that this fine synaptic specificity is mediated by selective expression of Sema3e and PlexinD1 by specific motor and sensory neuron populations, respectively. Signalling cascades activated by these molecular repellents affected not only monosynaptic circuit anatomy, but also circuit function. Reflex circuits are specifically formed between sensory and motor neurons based on the class of sensory cell and the muscle type innervated by the motor neuron. Here, this fine synaptic specificity is found to be mediated by selective expression of the class 3 semaphorin Sema3e and its high-affinity receptor plexin D1 (Plxnd1) by specific motor and sensory neuron populations, respectively. Spinal reflexes are mediated by synaptic connections between sensory afferents and motor neurons1,2,3. The organization of these circuits shows several levels of specificity. Only certain classes of proprioceptive sensory neurons make direct, monosynaptic connections with motor neurons4. Those that do are bound by rules of motor pool specificity: they form strong connections with motor neurons supplying the same muscle, but avoid motor pools supplying antagonistic muscles1,5,6,7. This pattern of connectivity is initially accurate and is maintained in the absence of activity8, implying that wiring specificity relies on the matching of recognition molecules on the surface of sensory and motor neurons. However, determinants of fine synaptic specificity here, as in most regions of the central nervous system, have yet to be defined. To address the origins of synaptic specificity in these reflex circuits we have used molecular genetic methods to manipulate recognition proteins expressed by subsets of sensory and motor neurons. We show here that a recognition system involving expression of the class 3 semaphorin Sema3e by selected motor neuron pools, and its high-affinity receptor plexin D1 (Plxnd1) by proprioceptive sensory neurons, is a critical determinant of synaptic specificity in sensory–motor circuits in mice. Changing the profile of Sema3e–Plxnd1 signalling in sensory or motor neurons results in functional and anatomical rewiring of monosynaptic connections, but does not alter motor pool specificity. Our findings indicate that patterns of monosynaptic connectivity in this prototypic central nervous system circuit are constructed through a recognition program based on repellent signalling."

However, data are often insufficient at region-wide scales to assess the effects of extraction in coral reef ecosystems of developing nations. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, I overcome this difficulty by using a publicly accessible, fisheries-independent database to provide a broad scale, comprehensive analysis of human impacts on predatory reef fish communities across the greater Caribbean region. Specifically, this study analyzed presence and diversity of predatory reef fishes over a gradient of human population density. Across the region, as human population density increases, presence of large-bodied fishes declines, and fish communities become dominated by a few smaller-bodied species. Conclusions/Significance Complete disappearance of several large-bodied fishes indicates ecological and local extinctions have occurred in some densely populated areas. These findings fill a fundamentally important gap in our knowledge of the ecosystem effects of artisanal fisheries in developing nations, and provide support for multiple approaches to data collection where they are commonly unavailable."

However, the molecular basis for Cripto coupling to these pathways during embryogenesis and tumorigenesis is not fully understood. In this regard, we recently demonstrated that Cripto forms a cell surface complex with the HSP70 family member glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78). Here, we provide novel functional evidence demonstrating that cell surface GRP78 is a necessary mediator of Cripto signaling in human tumor, mammary epithelial and embryonic stem cells. We show that targeted disruption of the cell surface Cripto/GRP78 complex using shRNAs or GRP78 immunoneutralization precludes Cripto activation of MAPK/PI3K pathways and modulation of activin-A, activin-B, Nodal and transforming growth factor-β1 signaling. We further demonstrate that blockade of Cripto binding to cell surface GRP78 prevents Cripto from increasing cellular proliferation, downregulating E-Cadherin, decreasing cell adhesion and promoting pro-proliferative responses to activin-A and Nodal. Thus, disrupting the Cripto/GRP78 binding interface blocks oncogenic Cripto signaling and may have important therapeutic value in the treatment of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1968740507,"Rapid and accurate diagnosis for pathogens and their antibiotic susceptibility is critical for controlling bacterial infections. Conventional methods for determining bacterium's sensitivity to antibiotic depend mostly on measuring the change of microbial proliferation in response to the drug. Such “biological assay” inevitably takes time, ranging from days for fast-growing bacteria to weeks for slow-growers. Here, a novel tool has been developed to detect the “chemical features” of bacterial cell wall that enables rapid identification of drug resistant bacteria within hours. The surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) technique based on our newly developed SERS-active substrate was applied to assess the fine structures of the bacterial cell wall. The SERS profiles recorded by such a platform are sensitive and stable, that could readily reflect different bacterial cell walls found in Gram-positive, Gram-negative, or mycobacteria groups. Moreover, characteristic changes in SERS profile were noticed in the drug-sensitive bacteria at the early period (i.e., ∼1 hr) of antibiotic exposure, which could be used to differentiate them from the drug-resistant ones. The SERS-based diagnosis could be applied to a single bacterium. The high-speed SERS detection represents a novel approach for microbial diagnostics. The single-bacterium detection capability of SERS makes possible analyses directly on clinical specimen instead of pure cultured bacteria."

Urinary tract infections caused by Proteus vulgaris typically form biofilms and are resistant to commonly used antibiotics. The Rts1 conjugative plasmid from a clinical isolate of P. vulgaris carries over 300 predicted open reading frames, including antibiotic resistance genes. The maintenance of the Rts1 plasmid is ensured in part by the HigBA toxin-antitoxin system. We determined the precise mechanism of action of the HigB toxin in vivo, which is distinct from other known toxins. We demonstrate that HigB is an endoribonuclease whose enzymatic activity is dependent on association with ribosomes through the 50 S subunit. Using primer extension analysis of several test mRNAs, we showed that HigB cleaved extensively across the entire length of coding regions only at specific recognition sequences. HigB mediated cleavage of 100% of both in-frame and out-of-frame AAA sequences. In addition, HigB cleaved approximately 20% of AA sequences in coding regions and occasionally cut single As. Remarkably, the cleavage specificity of HigB coincided with one of the most frequently used codons in the AT-rich Proteus spp., AAA (lysine). Therefore, the HigB-mediated plasmid maintenance system for the Rts1 plasmid highlights the intimate relationship between host cells and extrachromosomal DNA that enables the dynamic acquisition of genes that impart a spectrum of survival advantages, including those encoding multidrug resistance and virulence factors."
https://openalex.org/W2028257597,"The structure of the membrane integral rotor ring of the proton translocating F(1)F(0) ATP synthase from spinach chloroplasts was determined to 3.8 A resolution by x-ray crystallography. The rotor ring consists of 14 identical protomers that are symmetrically arranged around a central pore. Comparisons with the c(11) rotor ring of the sodium translocating ATPase from Ilyobacter tartaricus show that the conserved carboxylates involved in proton or sodium transport, respectively, are 10.6-10.8 A apart in both c ring rotors. This finding suggests that both ATPases have the same gear distance despite their different stoichiometries. The putative proton-binding site at the conserved carboxylate Glu(61) in the chloroplast ATP synthase differs from the sodium-binding site in Ilyobacter. Residues adjacent to the conserved carboxylate show increased hydrophobicity and reduced hydrogen bonding. The crystal structure reflects the protonated form of the chloroplast c ring rotor. We propose that upon deprotonation, the conformation of Glu(61) is changed to another rotamer and becomes fully exposed to the periphery of the ring. Reprotonation of Glu(61) by a conserved arginine in the adjacent a subunit returns the carboxylate to its initial conformation."

The expression of BAFF-R on all mature B cells might suggest a role for BAFF-R signaling also for their in vivo maintenance. Here, we show that, 14 days following a single injection of an anti-BAFF-R mAb that prevents BAFF binding, both follicular and marginal zone B cell numbers are drastically reduced, whereas B-1 cells are not affected. Injection of control, isotype-matched but non-blocking anti-BAFF-R mAbs does not result in B cell depletion. We also show that this depletion is neither due to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity nor to complement-mediated lysis. Moreover, prevention of BAFF binding leads to a decrease in the size of the B cell follicles, an impairment of a T cell dependent humoral immune response and a reduction in the formation of memory B cells. Collectively, these results establish a central role for BAFF-BAFF-R signaling in the in vivo survival and maintenance of both follicular and marginal zone B cell pools."

Suppression of RACK1 by small interfering RNA ablates FAK phos pho ryl a tion and reduces cell adhesion, cell spreading, and clonogenic growth.

For example, IGF-I-mediated dissociation of PP2A from RACK1 is required for recruitment of β1 integrin, and both PP2A and β1 integrin compete for binding to tyrosine 302 in RACK1 (5Kiely P.A.

FAK is a well characterized kinase in mediating integrin signaling and is associated with the enhanced migratory potential of several cancer cell types (16Mitra S.K. Schlaepfer D.D. Curr. Opin.

FAK is phosphorylated on tyrosine 397 in response to the clustering of integrins (for review, see Ref. 19Schlaepfer D.D. Mitra S.K. Curr. Opin. Genet.

This results in recruitment of Src and subsequent phosphorylation of target proteins that are associated with focal adhesion formation and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. FAK becomes rapidly dephosphorylated when cells are detached, and this is thought to be essential for focal adhesion dissolution and cell migration. FAK dephosphorylation can be stimulated by IGF-I (5Kiely P.A. O'Gorman D. Luong K. Ron D. O'Connor R. Mol. Cell.

Interestingly, we have observed that IGF-I-mediated dephosphorylation of FAK is enhanced in cells overexpressing RACK1, which also have enhanced migratory potential and increased activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (28Kiely P.A. Sant A. O'Connor R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22581-22589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, it is not known how the phosphorylation and subsequent dephosphorylation of FAK are coordinated. In particular, the role of RACK1 in regulation of FAK phosphorylation remains undefined. Here we investigated this in the context of IGF-I and adhesion signaling by determining the role of RACK1 in FAK function. Recombinant IGF-I and EGF were purchased from Pepro Tech. Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). The anti-RACK1 and anti-Abl (554148) were from BD Transduction Laboratories. The anti-IGF-IR polyclonal antibody and anti c-Abl antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-phospho-Akt, anti-Akt, and anti-phospho FAK (Tyr-397) polyclonal antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The anti-Shc polyclonal antibodies, the anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10, anti-ERK-2, anti-FAK antibodies, and recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Crk was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc.

R− cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3/IGF-IR WT or IGF-IR Y1250F/Y1251F or empty pcDNA3 vectors (8 μg of DNA) using Lipofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen). After 24 h in culture the transfected cells were seeded into 10-cm plates and cultured for an additional 18 h. For analysis of signaling responses in adherent cells, the cells were then washed with PBS and starved from serum for 4 h before stimulation with IGF-I or EGF for the indicated times. For analysis of signaling responses in non-adherent cells (Fig. 1A) confluent R− cells were detached with trypsin/EDTA and then washed with PBS. Cells were resuspended in serum-free medium and maintained in suspension for 4 h before stimulation with IGF-I for the indicated times. siRNAs targeted to human RACK1 were purchased from Ambion. The sequences are: siRNA ID 135615 (siRNA 1) 5′-ccaucaagcuauggaauactt-3′ (sense), 5′-guauuccauagcuugauggtt-3′ (antisense); siRNA ID 135616 (siRNA 2) 5′-gcuauggaauacccugggutt-3′ (sense), 5′-acccaggguauuccauagctt-3′ (antisense); siRNA ID135617 (siRNA 3) 5′-ccuuuacacgcuagauggutt-3′ (sense), 5′-accaucuagcguguaaaggtg-3′ (antisense). MCF-7 cells were seeded at 50% confluency and transfected with 100 μm siRNA using the OligofectAMINE transfection reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (5Kiely P.A. O'Gorman D. Luong K. Ron D. O'Connor R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4041-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). After 24 h the cells were starved and stimulated as described above or lifted using trypsin/EDTA and replated for cell assays. Cellular protein extracts were prepared by washing cells with PBS and then scraping into lysis buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 plus the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor Na3VO4 (1 mm), and the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), pepstatin (1 μm), and aprotinin (1.5 μg/ml). After incubation at 4 °C for 20 min nuclear and cellular debris were removed by microcentrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins from stimulated or unstimulated cells, cells were initially precleared using bovine serum albumin-coated protein G-agarose beads (15 μl of beads per 400 μg of total protein in 700 μl of lysis buffer) by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle rocking. The lysates were recovered from the beads by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 3 min and transferred to fresh tubes for incubation with primary antibody (3 μg of each antibody) overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Immune complexes were obtained by adding 20 μl of protein G-agarose beads for 3 h at 4 °C, washing (×3) with ice-cold lysis buffer, and removal from the beads by boiling for 5 min in 20 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer before electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. For RACK1 immunoprecipitations, 700 μg of protein was incubated with 1 μg of anti-RACK1 IgM antibodies, 5 μg of goat anti-mouse IgM Fab fragment, 30 μl of protein G-agarose beads, 500 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% deoxycholate together with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor Na3VO4 (1 mm) and protease inhibitors as described previously (Kiely et al. (25Kiely P.A. Leahy M. O'Gorman D. O'Connor R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7624-7633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)). Protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 4–20% gradient gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% milk (w/v). Primary antibody incubations were overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibody incubations were at room temperature for 1 h. Where indicated, membranes were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris-Cl, 1% SDS, and 0.7% 2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C followed by extensive washing in 0.2 and 0.05% Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. Secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were used for detection of Shc with enhanced chemiluminescence (Super Signal from Pierce). In all other cases we used Alexa Fluor 680- and 800-coupled anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies (LI-COR Biosciences) for detection with the Odyssey® infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). Plates (96 wells) were coated with collagen I (10 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C and washed twice with 2× PBS and then blocked with 2.5% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 37 °C. MCF-7 cells transfected with siRNA targeting RACK1 or a control siRNA for 24 h were-serum starved for 4 h before harvesting with trypsin/EDTA, washing with serum-free media (SFM), and resuspending in SFM to give a final density of 2.0 × 105 cells/ml. This cell suspension (100 μl/2.0 × 104 cells) was plated onto collagen-coated plates and allowed to attach for the indicated times at 37 °C. Unbound cells were removed by inverting and gentle washing in PBS before the cells were fixed in methanol at −20 °C for 5 min. Cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet and measured by reading the absorbance at 595 nm. To assess cell spreading, MCF-7 cells (transfected with siRNA targeting RACK1 or a control siRNA) were harvested with trypsin/EDTA and replated onto multiple wells of a collagen-coated 24-well plate. After 8 h the cells were inspected and photographed. MCF-7 cells transfected with siRNA targeting RACK1 or a control siRNA were harvested after 24 h with trypsin/EDTA, washed in serum-free medium, and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal bovine serum at a final density of 3.0 × 104 cells/well in multiple wells of a 24-well plate. At regular intervals (48, 72, and 96 h post-transfection) the cells were removed from triplicate wells and counted using a hemocytometer and trypan blue exclusion. To assess plating efficiency cells were seeded in triplicate wells of a 6-well plate at 500 cells/well in 3 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum and cultured for 14 days. Cells were fixed in methanol at −20 °C for 5 min and stained with Giemsa. Colonies were examined, counted, and photographed. Peptides arrays of RACK1 in nitrocellulose were generated as previously described (30Frank R. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 267: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 31Frank R. Overwin H. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 149-169PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kramer A. Schneider-Mergener J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 87: 25-39PubMed Google Scholar). Essentially, scanning libraries of overlapping 25-mer peptides covering the entire sequence of RACK1 were produced by automatic SPOT synthesis and synthesized on continuous cellulose membrane supports on Whatman 50 cellulose using Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl) chemistry with the AutoSpot-Rosbot ASS 222 (Intavis Bioanalytical Instruments). The interaction of GST, GST-FAK, and c-Abl with the RACK1 array was investigated by overlaying the cellulose membranes with 10 μg/ml concentrations of each recombinant protein. Bound protein was detected with specific rabbit antisera for each protein and a secondary anti-rabbit antibody coupled with horseradish peroxidase. Once the binding site of FAK on the full-length RACK1 array was determined, specific alanine scanning substitution arrays were generated for selected peptides using the same synthesis procedure. c-Abl kinase was first immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of cell lysate by incubating 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads and 3 μg of anti-c-Abl (K-12) overnight. Beads were washed twice in lysis buffer and once with the kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 μm sodium vanadate). The in vitro kinase reaction was performed using 10 μg of GST-Crk as an exogenous substrate in the presence of 10 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 15 min. The reaction mixture was then subjected to SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and autoradiography phosphorimaging analysis. To assess the phosphorylation of peptide arrays, the membrane was placed in membrane phosphorylation buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was blocked overnight at 4 °C in membrane phosphorylation buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μm ATP. Each membrane was phosphorylated in 20 ml of membrane phosphorylation buffer containing 50 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP with and without kinase at 30 °C for 30 min. After extensive washing with 1 m NaCl (10 × 10 min), H2O (3 × 5 min), 5% H3PO4 (3 × 15 min), and H2O (3 × 5 min), the membrane was exposed by autoradiography phosphorimaging analysis. We have shown previously that FAK phosphorylation on Tyr-397 is increased in RACK1-overexpressing cells and that IGF-I induced FAK dephosphorylation is accelerated (25Kiely P.A. Leahy M. O'Gorman D. O'Connor R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7624-7633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We, therefore, investigated whether RACK1 is required for FAK phosphorylation and dephosphorylation by cell adhesion and IGF-I stimulation, respectively. To do this we suppressed RACK1 expression with siRNA in MCF-7 cells. In cells transfected with control siRNA, FAK phosphorylation on Tyr-397 was evident in adherent serum-starved cell cultures and was decreased after IGF-I stimulation. However, in cells transfected with three different siRNAs targeting RACK1, FAK phosphorylation on Tyr-397 was not detectable in either the presence or absence of IGF-I (Fig. 1A). This indicates that FAK phosphorylation on Tyr-397 requires RACK1. We next investigated whether FAK phosphorylation was dependent on an interaction between RACK1 and the IGF-IR. To test this, R− cells were transfected with either wild type IGF-IR (IGF-IR WT) or an IGF-IR mutant (Y1250F/Y1251F) that does not interact with RACK1 and does not promote cell migration (25Kiely P.A. Leahy M. O'Gorman D. O'Connor R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7624-7633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 1B, FAK phosphorylation was decreased in response to IGF-I in cells expressing wild type IGF-IR but was unresponsive to IGF-I in cells expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant. Moreover, when R− cells expressing WT IGF-IR were maintained in suspension culture, FAK phosphorylation was not detected (Fig. 1B). These data confirm that FAK phosphorylation requires cell adhesion and demonstrate that IGF-I-mediated dephosphorylation of FAK requires association of RACK1 with the IGF-IR. These results led us to hypothesize that FAK association with RACK1 may be regulated by IGF-I. To test this we investigated the co-immunoprecipitation of FAK with RACK1 in MCF-7 cells, R+ cells, and R− cells. FAK was found to be constitutively associated with RACK1 in immunoprecipitates from all three cell lines (Fig. 1C). This suggests that the association is not dependent on the presence of the IGF-IR. However, although RACK1-associated FAK was phosphorylated in serum-starved cultures with all cell lines, IGF-I-mediated dephosphorylation of FAK was observed in both MCF-7 and R+ cells but not in R− cells. This indicates that phosphorylation of FAK in response to integrin ligation and dephosphorylation of FAK in response to IGF-I, both, occur when RACK1 is associated with the IGF-IR. We next investigated whether suppression of RACK1 would affect the ability of MCF-7 cells to attach and spread on collagen and proliferate under different conditions. In cells with RACK1 suppressed, attachment to collagen was decreased by almost 50% in comparison to control siRNA- transfected MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, as can be seen in Fig. 2B, cell spreading after 8 h of attachment was greatly impaired compared with untransfected or control cells. Although cells in which RACK1 was suppressed were attached and viable, they clearly occupied a smaller surface area than control cells (Fig. 2B). Proliferation was assessed in normal monolayer cultures and in plating efficiency assays, which measure the ability to form foci at low density, a feature of transformed cells. In monolayer cultures the proliferation rate of MCF-7 cells with RACK1 suppressed was reduced by 60% compared with controls (Fig. 2C). In plating efficiency assays these cells also yielded fewer and smaller foci than control cells (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these data indicate that RACK1 is required for FAK phosphorylation, cell attachment, initiation of cell spreading, proliferation, and foci formation. The data suggest that RACK1 may be required for the initial stages of cell attachment necessary for both proliferation and migration. Our co-immunoprecipitation results suggest that FAK is constitutively associated with RACK1 (Fig. 1C). To determine whether this is a direct interaction and to define the site of interaction, we employed peptide arrays, which we have recently used to identify the binding site for PP2A and β1 integrin on RACK1 (15Kiely P.A. Baillie G.S. Lynch M.J. Houslay M.D. O'Connor R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22952-22961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and sites for RACK1 and β arrestin2 on PDE4D5 (33Bolger G.B. Baillie G.S. Li X. Lynch M.J. Herzyk P.

A library of overlapping peptides (25-mers) each shifted by 5 amino acids encompassing the entire sequence of RACK1 (60 in all) was spot-synthesized on nitrocellulose membranes to generate RACK1 peptide arrays. These arrays were then probed with recombinant GST or GST-FAK. GST did not bind to any peptide spot within the RACK1 array. GST-FAK bound to a number of peptides with the positive reactions indicated by dark spots (8, 9, 12, 22, and 23) (Fig. 3A). All of these peptides are derived from the RACK1 sequence spanning WD repeats 1–3. To identify the specific amino acids within these peptides required for FAK binding we generated an array of peptides derived from the 25-mer parent peptides corresponding to spot 10 (Thr-46 to Val-70) and spot 22 (Lys-106 to Lys-130). For each parent peptide, 25 progeny were generated where each new peptide in the array had a single alanine substitution in successive amino acids in the sequence. These two alanine-scanning peptide arrays were then probed with recombinant GST-FAK. Results showed that FAK binding to these peptides was either severely attenuated or ablated by alanine substitution of Arg-47, Tyr-52, Arg-57, Arg-60, and Phe-65 in peptide 10 and by alanine substitution of Lys-127 and Lys-130 in peptide 22 (Fig. 3B). Dual substitution of the positively charged Arg-57 and Arg-60 in peptide 10 and the positively charged Lys-127 and Lys-130 in peptide 22 completely ablated binding of FAK. Dual substitutions of either Val-69 and Val-70 or His-62 and His-64 in peptide 10 and Lys-106 and Asp-107 or Ser-114 and Ser-115 in peptide 22 had no effect on the binding of FAK to RACK1 and, thus, provide internal controls. The interaction of FAK with the peptides was quantified by densitometry and is presented in Fig. 3B as a percentage of binding of FAK to the control parent peptide. Together these analyses confirm that the binding of FAK to RACK1 is direct and demonstrates that key amino acids required for binding are located in the RACK1 sequence immediately after WD1 and running into WD2 as well as into WD3. During the course of this work no crystal structure was available for RACK1, although we had previously developed a seven-bladed β-propeller RACK1 model based on homologous proteins (35Steele M.R. McCahill A. Thompson D.S. MacKenzie C. Isaacs N.W. Houslay M.D. Bolger G.B. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To direct subsequent mutagenesis studies, this model was used to assess the likely surface exposure of array peptide residues implicated in FAK binding. The clustered residues from peptide 10 (Arg-47, Tyr-52, Arg-57, and Arg-60) were predicted to occupy surface-exposed positions on a single β-hairpin motif (Fig. 4Ai), and peptides encompassing this region might reasonably preserve the native structure of the intact protein. In contrast, Phe-65 fell within a loop region in WD2, and its structural organization in the array peptides and mimicry of the intact protein was considered to be l"

Although recent progress has advanced our understanding of DNA damage checkpoint regulations, little is known as to how DNA repair, especially the RAD51-dependent homologous recombination repair pathway, is executed in vivo. Here, we reveal novel properties of the BRCA2-associated protein PALB2 in the assembly of the recombinational DNA repair machinery at DNA damage sites. Although the chromatin association of PALB2 is a prerequisite for subsequent BRCA2 and RAD51 loading, the focal accumulation of the PALB2 x BRCA2 x RAD51 complex at DSBs occurs independently of known DNA damage checkpoint and repair proteins. We provide evidence to support that PALB2 exists as homo-oligomers and that PALB2 oligomerization is essential for its focal accumulation at DNA breaks in vivo. We propose that both PALB2 chromatin association and its oligomerization serve to secure the BRCA2 x RAD51 repair machinery at the sites of DNA damage. These attributes of PALB2 are likely instrumental for proficient homologous recombination DNA repair in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2146356260,"Physiological studies of perfectly still observers have shown interesting correlations between increasing effortfulness of observed actions and increases in heart and respiration rates. Not much is known about the cortical response induced by observing effortful actions. The aim of this study was to investigate the time course and neural correlates of perception of implied motion, by presenting 260 pictures of human actions differing in degrees of dynamism and muscular exertion. ERPs were recorded from 128 sites in young male and female adults engaged in a secondary perceptual task.Our results indicate that even when the stimulus shows no explicit motion, observation of static photographs of human actions with implied motion produces a clear increase in cortical activation, manifest in a long-lasting positivity (LP) between 350-600 ms that is much greater to dynamic than less dynamic actions, especially in men. A swLORETA linear inverse solution computed on the dynamic-minus-static difference wave in the time window 380-430 ms showed that a series of regions was activated, including the right V5/MT, left EBA, left STS (BA38), left premotor (BA6) and motor (BA4) areas, cingulate and IF cortex.Overall, the data suggest that corresponding mirror neurons respond more strongly to implied dynamic than to less dynamic actions. The sex difference might be partially cultural and reflect a preference of young adult males for highly dynamic actions depicting intense muscular activity, or a sporty context."
https://openalex.org/W1999050844,"Background The development of new therapeutic targets and strategies to control highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus infection in humans is urgently needed. Broadly cross-neutralizing recombinant human antibodies obtained from the survivors of H5N1 avian influenza provide an important role in immunotherapy for human H5N1 virus infection and definition of the critical epitopes for vaccine development. Methodology/Principal Findings We have characterized two recombinant baculovirus-expressed human antibodies (rhAbs), AVFluIgG01 and AVFluIgG03, generated by screening a Fab antibody phage library derived from a patient recovered from infection with a highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 clade 2.3 virus. AVFluIgG01 cross-neutralized the most of clade 0, clade 1, and clade 2 viruses tested, in contrast, AVFluIgG03 only neutralized clade 2 viruses. Passive immunization of mice with either AVFluIgG01 or AVFluIgG03 antibody resulted in protection from a lethal H5N1 clade 2.3 virus infection. Furthermore, through epitope mapping, we identify two distinct epitopes on H5 HA molecule recognized by these rhAbs and demonstrate their potential to protect against a lethal H5N1 virus infection in a mouse model. Conclusions/Significance Importantly, localization of the epitopes recognized by these two neutralizing and protective antibodies has provided, for the first time, insight into the human antibody responses to H5N1 viruses which contribute to the H5 immunity in the recovered patient. These results highlight the potential of a rhAbs treatment strategy for human H5N1 virus infection and provide new insight for the development of effective H5N1 pandemic vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2034570201,"Chk1 is phosphorylated within its C-terminal regulatory domain by the upstream ATM/ATR kinases during checkpoint activation; however, how this modulates Chk1 function is poorly understood. Here, we show that Chk1 kinase activity is rapidly stimulated in a cell-cycle phase-specific manner in response to both DNA damage and replication arrest, and that the extent and duration of activation correlates closely with regulatory phosphorylation at serines (S) S317, S345 and S366. Despite their evident co-regulation, substitutions of individual Chk1 regulatory sites with alanine (A) residues have differential effects on checkpoint proficiency and kinase activation. Thus, whereas Chk1 S345 is essential for all functions tested, mutants lacking S317 or S366 retain partial proficiency for G2/M and S/M checkpoint arrests triggered by DNA damage or replication arrest. These phenotypes reflect defects in Chk1 kinase induction, as the mutants are either partially (317A and 366A) or completely (345A) resistant to kinase activation. Importantly, S345 phosphorylation is impaired in Chk1 S317A and S366A mutants, suggesting that modification of adjacent SQ sites promotes this key regulatory event. Finally, we provide biochemical evidence that Chk1 catalytic activity is stimulated by a de-repression mechanism."

We show here that intracellular neuroserpin polymers activate NF-κB by a pathway that is independent of the IRE1, ATF6, and PERK limbs of the canonical unfolded protein response but is dependent on intracellular calcium. This pathway provides a mechanism for cells to sense and react to the accumulation of folded structures of mutant serpins within the endoplasmic reticulum.

Our results provide strong support for the endoplasmic reticulum overload response being independent of the unfolded protein response. An increasing number of disorders are recognized to result from the aggregation and tissue deposition of misfolded proteins. Indeed, their shared mechanism provides the basis for a new class of disorder, the conformational diseases (1.Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Lancet. 1997; 350: 134-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). These include Alzheimer, Huntington, and Parkinson diseases as well as the amyloidoses and serpinopathies. The serpinopathies are characterized by the aggregation and tissue deposition of members of the serine protease inhibitor or serpin superfamily of proteins (2.Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Point mutations of serpins such as α1-antitrypsin, antithrombin, and α1-antichymotrypsin result in a sequential linkage between the exposed mobile reactive center loop of one molecule and β-sheet A of another (3.Gooptu B.

The resulting inclusions lead to progressive dementia, with the age of onset of disease being inversely proportional to the rate at which the mutants form polymers in vitro and the number of intra-cerebral inclusions (6.Davis R.L.

The accumulation of misfolded proteins within the lumen of the ER activates the PERK (PKR-like ER kinase), IRE1 (inositol-requiring kinase 1), and ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6) limbs of the unfolded protein response (UPR). This pathway serves to attenuate protein translation and increase the production of molecular chaperones to promote polypeptide folding and remove terminally misfolded proteins by ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (8.Ron D. Walter P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4929) Google Scholar). The UPR is increasingly being implicated in the pathogenesis of human disease (9.Marciniak S.J. Ron D. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 1133-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). It is striking that accumulation of mutant Z α1-antitrypsin polymers within the ER of hepatocytes does not elicit the UPR (10.Graham K.S. Le A. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20463-20468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but does activate NF-κB (11.Hidvegi T. Schmidt B.Z. Hale P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39002-39015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 12.Lawless M.W. Greene C.M. Mulgrew A. Taggart C.C. O'Neill S.J. McElvaney N.G. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 5722-5726Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This has been explained by the activation of the ER overload response (EOR) (13.Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2580-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), a stress signaling pathway that links the accumulation of folded proteins within the ER with the activation of NF-κB. The term EOR was originally coined to describe the NF-κB response to ER accumulation of viral proteins (14.Pahl H.L. Sester M. Burgert H.G. Baeuerle P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 511-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), but was subsequently extended to include other proteins retained within the ER despite achieving native or near native conformations (15.Knorre A. Wagner M. Schaefer H.E. Colledge W.H. Pahl H.L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16.Pahl H.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 683-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). However, NF-κB activation in response to ER dysfunction has been shown to require PERK signaling, and so the very existence of an EOR pathway distinct from the UPR remains controversial (17.Deng J. Lu P.D. Zhang Y. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Sonenberg N. Harding H.P. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10161-10168Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Here we have used wild-type and mutants of neuroserpin to investigate the consequences of ordered protein accumulation within the ER. We demonstrate that neuroserpin polymers activate NF-κB by a calcium-dependent pathway that is independent of the IRE, ATF6, and PERK limbs of the canonical UPR. These data provide strong support for a signaling pathway that directly links the activation of NF-κB with the accumulation of ordered proteins within the ER. The rabbit polyclonal anti-neuroserpin antibody was produced by Abcam (Cambridge, UK) using purified recombinant wild-type neuroserpin as the antigen (18.Belorgey D. Crowther D.C. Mahadeva R. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17367-17373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-GAPDH and donkey polyclonal anti-rabbit IgG (Texas Red) antibodies were also from Abcam. Goat polyclonal anti-rabbit IgG (horseradish peroxidase) and rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse IgG (horseradish peroxidase) antibodies were from Sigma-Aldrich. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Phospho-eIF2α (S51) from Cell Signaling was a kind gift from Dr. Shiu-Wan Chan (Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, UK). All pharmacological cell-permeable inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem (Merck Chemicals Ltd., Nottingham, UK). Unless stated otherwise, reagents for cell culture were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% v/v Tet Approved Fetal Bovine Serum (BD Biosciences), 10 mm HEPES, 1× non-essential amino acids, 0.2 unit/ml bovine insulin, 200 μg/ml Geneticin, and 100 μg/ml Hygromycin B (selective antibiotics from Invitrogen), and incubated at 37 °C and 5% v/v CO2 in a humidified incubator. Neuroserpin expression was typically induced with 10 μg/ml doxycycline (BD Biosciences). Immortalized wild-type and eIF2α S51A/A MEFs were transduced with pBABE retrovirus encoding WT, S52R, G392E, and ΔNS neuroserpin using previously described protocols (19.Bartz S.R. Vodicka M.A. Methods. 1997; 12: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 20.Lu P.D. Jousse C. Marciniak S.J. Zhang Y. Novoa I. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Ron D. Harding H.P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were selected for stable transgene expression by selection with 2.5 μg/ml puromycin, with surviving cells considered as stable expressing pools. Several stable pools expressing neuroserpin were established, and these were then used in the functional studies. All results described are the average of at least three independent repeats. Cell lysates and culture media were analyzed in 10% w/v SDS-PAGE or 7.5% w/v acrylamide non-denaturing gels as described previously (21.Miranda E. Römisch K. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28283-28291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling experiments with 35S-Met/Cys were performed as described previously (21.Miranda E. Römisch K. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28283-28291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were treated with 200 μm leupeptin, 25 μm lactacystin, or 3 μm brefeldin A from Calbiochem (CN Biosciences, Nottingham, UK) for 1 h prior to starvation and these agents were present in all subsequent steps until harvesting. Total RNA was isolated from mammalian cells using the recommended protocol in the Qiagen RNeasy Isolation kit. (Qiagen, UK). The concentration of RNA was determined, and 1 μg of total RNA was used as a template for first strand cDNA synthesis using the manufacturer's recommended protocols (Promega, Madison, WI). This was then used to semi-quantify the relative levels of neuroserpin and β-actin mRNA expression and the unspliced to spliced ratio of XBP1. The primers were RT_NS_S (5′-TCT CCA TTG AGT ATT GCT CTT GC), RT_NS_AS (5′-TCT CCT TGC TGA TAC ATC ATT GG), Actin_S (5′-CTT CGC GGG CGA CGA TGC), Actin_AS (5′-TGG TGG TGA AGC TGT AGC C), RtXBP1S (5′-AAA CAG AGT AGC AGC ACA GAC TGC), and RtXBP1AS (5′-TCC TTG TGG GTA GAC CTC TGG GAG). Optimal PCR conditions were used as described previously (22.Marciniak S.J. Yun C.Y. Oyadomari S. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Jungreis R. Nagata K. Harding H.P. Ron D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed in 6-well plates that had been pre-coated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine. Typically, 2 μg of either p(5×)ATF6-luc (firefly) or pELAM1-luc (firefly) and 50 ng of pRL-TK (Renilla) transfection efficiency control reporter plasmids (all kind gifts from Dr. Timothy Weaver, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH) were mixed with 6.25 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in serum-free Opti-MEM culture medium (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were lysed post-transfection using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay (Promega) recommended protocol in 1× passive lysis buffer. Both firefly and Renilla luciferase activity were measured using a Glomax Luminometer (Promega), and firefly luciferase activity was calculated relative to Renilla transfection efficiency. All measurements were performed in triplicate. PC12 cells were resuspended at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml and loaded with Fluo-4 NW dye assay buffer (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommend protocol for 30 min at 37 °C and then 15 min at room temperature. The cells were then loaded onto a FACSCalibur cell cytometer (BD Biosciences) and read at 488 nm over time. Calcium was mobilized by the addition of 1 μm thapsigargin (TG) and the measurements continued to a relative increase in fluorescence that was stable over time. Control cells were pre-treated with 2 μg/ml tunicamycin for 16 h, or the calcium store was depleted by the addition of 1 μm TG for 30 min and recovery for 1 h in fresh media before analysis. All experiments were performed in triplicate and analyzed with FlowJo software (BD Biosciences). When comparing within a series, for example when analyzing the effects of a drug on each cell line, a paired t test was used. When comparing data between series, then two-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni post test was used. To study the cellular responses to the expression of mutant neuroserpin, we used rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) Tet-On cell lines that conditionally expressed wild-type human neuroserpin (WT) or the S52R and G392E mutants that are associated with moderate and severe forms of the dementia FENIB, respectively (23.Miranda E. MacLeod I. Davies M.J. Pérez J. Römisch K. Crowther D.C. Lomas D.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 1527-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). In addition, we generated a stable cell line that expressed a novel misfolding mutant of neuroserpin, with deletion of the C-terminal 134 amino acids, which include the reactive loop (ΔNS) (Fig. 1A). This mutant is equivalent to the null Hong Kong variant of the serpin α1-antitrypsin, which cannot form ordered polymers and is an efficient activator of the UPR and a potent substrate for ERAD (24.Sifers R.N. Brashears-Macatee S. Kidd V.J. Muensch H. Woo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7330-7335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We first assessed the presence of neuroserpin in these cells lines by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (supplemental Fig. S1). All four PC12 cell lines expressed neuroserpin when the cells were treated with increasing concentrations of doxycycline. WT, S52R, and G392E neuroserpin migrated with a molecular mass of 50 kDa, whereas the truncated version of neuroserpin, ΔNS, migrated at 28 kDa. Our previous work showed that in these cell lines WT neuroserpin was mainly stored in secretory granules at the tips of neurites, characteristic of a protein secreted through the regulated secretory pathway (23.Miranda E. MacLeod I. Davies M.J. Pérez J. Römisch K. Crowther D.C. Lomas D.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 1527-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In contrast, S52R and G392E neuroserpin formed inclusions within the ER that were found to be endoglycosidase H-sensitive polymers (21.Miranda E. Römisch K. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28283-28291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 23.Miranda E. MacLeod I. Davies M.J. Pérez J. Römisch K. Crowther D.C. Lomas D.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 1527-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). ΔNS neuroserpin displayed diffuse ER staining, but no signal was detected within the Golgi complex (results not shown), suggesting that none of the misfolded mutant protein was trafficked out of the ER. We next quantified neuroserpin secretion from each cell line by metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine/cysteine followed by immunoprecipitation of neuroserpin, SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography. WT neuroserpin was almost completely secreted into the culture medium by 4 h, compared with 78 and 18% of S52R and G392E neuroserpin, respectively (Fig. 1B). ΔNS neuroserpin was not detected in the culture medium despite being cleared from the cell lysates within 1 h of chase (Fig. 1B). We predicted that ΔNS neuroserpin would be a substrate for ERAD. To test this hypothesis we investigated the degradation of each neuroserpin variant by pulse-chase in the presence or absence of lactacystin (which irreversibly inhibits the proteasome (25.Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar)) or leupeptin (which inhibits lysosomal proteases (26.Libby P. Goldberg A.L. Science. 1978; 199: 534-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 27.Seglen P.O. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 737-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar)). Treatment with lactacystin increased intracellular WT, S52R, G392E, and ΔNS neuroserpin by 1.3-, 1.6-, 2.7-, and 9.5-fold, respectively (Fig. 1C, middle panels and graph). In contrast, treatment with leupeptin had no effect on the intracellular levels of any neuroserpin species, suggesting lysosomal protease digestion plays a limited role in the degradation of mutant neuroserpin (Fig. 1C, bottom panels and graph). Taken together, these data demonstrate that WT neuroserpin traffics normally through the secretory pathway and that S52R and G392E neuroserpin are secreted less efficiently and partially retained within the ER of PC12 cell lines. ΔNS neuroserpin is synthesized in the ER but rapidly cleared by ERAD without a detectable fraction being secreted into the media. We next characterized the nature of the proteins retained within the ER up to 10 days after induction of expression by non-denaturing PAGE and Western blot analysis of PC12 cell lysates (Fig. 2A). WT neuroserpin migrated as a single monomeric band, whereas S52R and G392E neuroserpin formed the high molecular mass ladders that are characteristic of serpin polymers (Fig. 2A, native gel panels, arrow, and bracket). A proportion of S52R neuroserpin migrated as a monomeric band (Fig. 2A, S52R, native, arrow). Although we could detect the presence of ΔNS neuroserpin by Western blot after SDS-PAGE, we did not see any signal after non-denaturing PAGE, probably due to lower steady-state levels of this mutant protein and/or the inability of this misfolded protein to be resolved by non-denaturing PAGE. Because the mutants of neuroserpin accumulated within the ER, we next assessed their effect on the UPR. None of the proteins activated the UPR as assessed by expression levels of glucose-regulated protein 94, immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (BiP), and protein disulfide isomerase (Fig. 2a). In contrast, tunicamycin, a canonical UPR stimulus that inhibits N-linked glycosylation, caused an increase in the steady-state levels of all these ER luminal chaperones (Fig. 2A, DMSO versus Tun). Nuclear lysates were prepared from the same samples and analyzed for the up-regulation of CAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein, a transcription factor specifically activated by the UPR (22.Marciniak S.J. Yun C.Y. Oyadomari S. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Jungreis R. Nagata K. Harding H.P. Ron D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar, 28.Ma Y. Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Hendershot L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1351-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). There was no detectable CAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein expression in any of the PC12 cell lines expressing neuroserpin (data not shown). The apparent absence of a UPR even in response to ΔNS, the ERAD substrate, might represent an issue of sensitivity. We therefore assessed the activation of the UPR by the splicing of X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA, which reports activation of IRE1, a proximal UPR sensor in the ER membrane. When the PC12 cell lines were induced to express wild-type or mutant neuroserpin with 10 μg/ml doxycycline for 4 days, no XBP1 mRNA splicing was detected (Fig. 2B, XBP1u). In contrast, cells treated with 2 μg/ml tunicamycin generated a faster migrating species corresponding to spliced XBP1 mRNA (Fig. 2B, Tun, XBP1u, and XBP1s). We did detect XBP1 mRNA splicing in cells expressing ΔNS neuroserpin when the cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 16 h prior to harvesting (Fig. 2B, ΔNS+/+). This raised the possibility that the methods we had used to detect UPR activation were insufficiently sensitive to detect subtle perturbations caused by the expression of mutant neuroserpin. To address this concern, we next assessed the activation of ATF6 using a highly sensitive reporter construct (pAT6(5×)-Luc, also known as the pUPRE-Luc (29.Shen J. Prywes R. Methods. 2005; 35: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)). In these experiments, co-transfection with pRL-TK 24 h prior to cell collection reported transfection efficiency (Fig. 2, C and D). Only PC12 cells expressing ΔNS activated ATF6 (p < 0.001, ΔNS versus WT, two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post test (Fig. 2C)). This up-regulation was increased when the cells were treated with 100 nm MG132 for 16 h prior to harvesting, whereas the other neuroserpin variants failed to activate ATF6 after proteasome inhibition (p < 0.001, ΔNS-MG132 versus ΔNS+MG132, two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post test (Fig. 2D)). These data show that the ER accumulation of neuroserpin polymers did not activate the UPR and that this failure was not due to defective UPR signaling, because an appropriate activation of ATF6 and XBP1 splicing response occurred during accumulation of ΔNS neuroserpin. It has been reported that the accumulation of Z α1-antitrypsin in the ER of hepatocytes can activate NF-κB (11.Hidvegi T. Schmidt B.Z. Hale P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39002-39015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 12.Lawless M.W. Greene C.M. Mulgrew A. Taggart C.C. O'Neill S.J. McElvaney N.G. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 5722-5726Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether the accumulation of polymeric neuroserpin could also activate this transcription factor. The stable PC12 Tet-On cell lines expressing neuroserpin variants were induced with 10 μg/ml doxycycline and subsequently co-transfected with the NF-κB reporter pELAM1-Luc and the transfection efficiency reporter pRL-TK (Fig. 3). We found low levels of NF-κB activation in cells expressing WT and ΔNS neuroserpin (p < 0.001, WT and ΔNS versus PC12, two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post test (Fig. 3A)). The expression of ER-retained S52R and G392E neuroserpin, however, resulted in much higher levels of NF-κB activation than WT (p < 0.001, S52R and G392E versus WT, two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post test (Fig. 3A)). There was no further increase in NF-κB activation following the addition of MG132 (Fig. 3B), suggesting that NF-κB activation does not report the accumulation of ERAD substrates. The addition of conditioned media from PC12 cells expressing S52R and G392E neuroserpin to parental PC12 cells for 10 days did not activate NF-κB. In addition to IRE1 and ATF6, UPR signaling occurs via the ER-localized kinase PERK (30.Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D.

We investigated whether polymers of neuroserpin could activate NF-κB independently of the PERK branch of the UPR by using eIF2αA/A knock-in cells, in which mutation of serine 51 to alanine renders eIF2α unable to be phosphorylated by PERK (32.Scheuner D.

Both eIF2αS/S and eIF2αA/A MEFs were treated with 1 μm thapsigargin for 30 min to confirm that only the eIF2αS/S cells could phosphorylate serine 51 when the UPR is activated (Fig. 4A). The eIF2αS/S and eIF2αA/A MEF cells were next transduced with parental pBABE VSV-G pseudotyped retrovirus alone (ψ) or encoding WT, S52R, G392E, or ΔNS neuroserpin. Stable pools of neuroserpin transgene-expressing cells were selected with puromycin, and neuroserpin expression levels were assessed in all the cell pools by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. The steady-state levels of all neuroserpin variants were similar in cell lysates and culture media for both eIF2αS/S and eIF2αA/A cells (Fig. 4B, Cells and Medium). As a control, TNF-α, which activates NFκB via phosphorylation of IκB, activated the NF-κB reporter in both eIF2αS/S and eIF2αA/A MEF cells (p < 0.005, both MEF lines untreated versus 8-h TNF-α, t test (Fig. 4C)). In contrast, only the eIF2αS/S MEF cell line activated NF-κB in response to the UPR activating agent thapsigargin, confirming the role of eIF2α phosphorylation in UPR-induced NFκB activation but not in TNFα signaling (p < 0.005, eIF2αS/S untreated versus 8 h thapsigargin, t test, p > 0.05 eIF2αA/A untreated versus 8-h thapsigargin (Fig. 4C)). The stable pools of neuroserpin transgene-expressing cells were then co-transfected with the NF-κB and control luciferase reporters, and the relative levels of NF-κB activity were determined. The empty virus control cells and cells expressing WT neuroserpin did not activate the NF-κB reporter (p > 0.05, t test, Fig. 4d, ψ and WT). ΔNS neuroserpin-expressing cells were able to activate NF-κB in the eIF2αS/S MEF cells, but this signal was abrogated in eIF2αA/A cell lines (p < 0.001, ψ versus ΔNS in eIF2αS/S, p > 0.05 in eIF2αA/A cells, t test; Fig. 4D, ΔNS), suggesting that in this case NF-κB activation is mediated through the PERK limb of the UPR. In contrast, the S52R and G392E neuroserpin polymer-forming cell lines were able to activate NF-κB in both eIF2αS/S and eIF2αA/A MEF cell lines (Fig. 4D, S52R and G392E). These data provide clear evidence that the accumulation of ordered protein polymers within the ER can activate NF-κB independently of the canonical UPR signaling pathway. Activation of NF-κB has previously been shown to be dependent on calcium (13.Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2580-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 34.Biswas G.

We therefore treated the PC12 cell lines induced to express neuroserpin with chelators of either extracellular (EGTA, pH 7.4) or intracellular (BAPTA-AM) calcium. Increasing concentrations of EGTA had no effect on the activity of NF-κB in any of the cell lines (Fig. 5A). In contrast, chelating intracellular calcium resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in NF-κB signaling in PC12 cells expressing WT, S52R, G392E, and ΔNS neuroserp"

Because statins can reduce chemokine expression in patients with coronary diseases, we wanted to test whether this can be achieved in patients with Crohn's disease.We investigated plasma levels of chemokines (CCL2, CCL4, CCL11, CCL13, CCL17, CCL22, CCL26, CXCL8, CXCL10) and endothelial cytokines (sP-selectin, sE-selectin, sICAM-3, thrombomodulin) in ten Crohn's disease patients before and after thirteen weeks' daily treatment with 80 mg atorvastatin. Of the 13 substances investigated, only CXCL10 was found to be significantly reduced (by 34%, p = 0.026) in all of the treated patients. Levels of CXCL10 correlated with C-reactive protein (r = 0.82, p<0.01).CXCL10 is a ligand for the CXCR3 receptor, the activation of which results in the recruitment of T lymphocytes and the perpetuation of mucosal inflammation. Hence the reduction of plasma CXCL10 levels by atorvastatin may represent a candidate for an approach to the treatment of Crohns disease in the future.(ClinicalTrials.gov) NCT00454545."
https://openalex.org/W2027683776,"We recently found that induction of the anti-inflammatory SOCS-3 gene by cyclic AMP occurs through novel cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase-independent mechanisms involving activation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) transcription factors, notably C/EBPβ, by the cyclic AMP GEF EPAC1 and the Rap1 GTPase. In this study we show that down-regulation of phospholipase (PL) Cϵ with small interfering RNA or blockade of PLC activity with chemical inhibitors ablates exchange protein directly activated by cyclic AMP (EPAC)-dependent induction of SOCS-3 in COS1 cells. Consistent with this, stimulation of cells with 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, both cell-permeable analogues of the PLC product diacylglycerol, are sufficient to induce SOCS-3 expression in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Moreover, the diacylglycerol- and Ca2+-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) isoform PKCα becomes activated following cyclic AMP elevation or EPAC stimulation. Conversely, down-regulation of PKC activity with chemical inhibitors or small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of PKCα or -δ blocks EPAC-dependent SOCS-3 induction. Using the MEK inhibitor U0126, we found that activation of ERK MAPKs is essential for SOCS-3 induction by either cyclic AMP or PKC. C/EBPβ is known to be phosphorylated and activated by ERK. Accordingly, we found ERK activation to be essential for cyclic AMP-dependent C/EBP activation and C/EBPβ-dependent SOCS-3 induction by cyclic AMP and PKC. Moreover, overexpression of a mutant form of C/EBPβ (T235A), which lacks the ERK phosphorylation site, blocks SOCS-3 induction by cyclic AMP and PKC in a dominant-negative manner.

Bossemeyer D. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2001; 41: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, this view changed in 1998 with the discovery of a family of guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs), called EPAC (exchange proteins directly activated by cyclic AMP). EPAC1 and EPAC2 directly activate the small GTPase Rap1, in response to elevations in intracellular cyclic AMP, with no involvement of PKA (2Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M.

EPACs contain an auto-inhibitory cyclic AMP-binding domain that interacts with and inhibits the catalytic region and facilitates their direct activation by cyclic AMP.

Very recent work has started to shed light on the function of EPAC proteins in health and disease. In particular, there is growing awareness that EPAC1-Rap1 signaling may serve to negatively modulate inflammatory processes in response to cyclic AMP. For example, EPAC proteins have been implicated in the positive regulation of cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, thereby promoting endothelial barrier function and limiting vascular permeability (4Sehrawat S. Cullere X. Patel S. Italiano Jr., J. Mayadas T.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1261-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 5Cullere X. Shaw S.K. Andersson L. Hirahashi J. Luscinskas F.W.

Biol. 2005; 25: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In addition, the EPAC-Rap1 pathway has been reported to inhibit inflammatory signaling processes in vascular endothelial cells by promoting the induction of the SOCS-3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 3) gene, thereby limiting pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling (7Sands W.A. Woolson H.D. Milne G.R. Rutherford C. Palmer T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6333-6346Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). SOCS-3 proteins bind to and inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation signaling from activated cytokine receptors by blocking activation of adjacent Janus tyrosine kinases and thus preventing signal transducers and activators of transcription recruitment and phosphorylation (8Kubo M. Hanada T. Yoshimura A. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 1169-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). In addition, SOCS-3 can target Src homology 2 domain-bound partners for interaction with an elongin B/C-Cul5-Rbx1 complex and associated ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase activity thereby directing them for proteasomal degradation (9Rui L. Yuan M. Frantz D. Shoelson S. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42394-42398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Therefore, the induction of SOCS-3 represents a novel function of EPAC that provides a previously unknown mechanism by which cyclic AMP can suppress cytokine signaling. Targeting the cyclic AMP-EPAC-Rap1-SOCS-3 pathway might therefore prove to be a useful strategy for combating pathologies associated with chronic vascular inflammation. A crucial step in this direction will be to delineate the intracellular signaling pathway leading from EPAC and Rap1 to SOCS-3 induction. Our recent observations suggest that C/EBP transcription factors, most notably C/EBPβ, are activated by cyclic AMP and EPAC and mediate SOCS-3 induction in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells (10Yarwood S.J. Borland G. Sands W.A. Palmer T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6843-6853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which EPAC activates C/EBP transcription factors still remain unclear but may well depend on covalent modification of the C/EBP proteins by intermediate EPAC-activated protein kinases. In this respect, it has been demonstrated that certain C/EBP isoforms are substrates for ERK, ribosomal S6 kinase, and PKC protein kinases (11Ramji D.P. Foka P. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 561-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, there has been some suggestion that in neurons activation of PKC, particularly PKCϵ, by EPAC may mediate responses such as pain and inflammation (12Gekel I. Neher E. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 7991-8002Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 13Wang C. Gu Y. Li G.W. Huang L.Y. J. Physiol. 2007; 584: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 14Hucho T.B.

In this study we present evidence that activation of the PKCα isoform by EPAC is a critical requirement for efficient ERK- and C/EBPβ-dependent SOCS-3 induction by cyclic AMP in COS1 cells. These findings reveal, for the first time, a central role for EPAC in governing gene regulatory cross-talk between the cyclic AMP and PKC signaling pathways.

COS1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 2 mml-glutamine, and 2% penicillin/streptomycin, at 37 °C in 5% (v/v) CO2. COS1 cells were grown until 90–95% confluent and then transfected with expression constructs for PKCδ, EPAC1-HA, PDZ-GEF1-HA, hLAP (human C/EBPβ wild type), or C/EBPβ (T235A) using the DOTAP (Roche Applied Science) transfection reagent. Briefly, for every well to be transfected, 15 μl of DOTAP diluted to 50 μl with Hanks' buffered saline and 2.5 μg of DNA diluted to 25 μl with Hanks' buffered saline were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The mixture was then added to COS1 cells in complete medium and incubated overnight before treatment of the cells as detailed in figure legends. Samples were lysed directly into SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. COS1 cells were grown on 12-well plates until 50–60% confluence and then were transfected with 0.125 μg of Renilla luciferase (pGL4.74) together with 1.125 μg of C/EBP firefly luciferase reporter construct using DOTAP. Cells were incubated with DNA for 24 h, and the medium was then changed for Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium after which the cell treatments were applied and incubated for a further 24 h. Cells were then harvested according to the protocols in the Promega dual luciferase reporter assay kit and analyzed using a BMG Labtech luminometer. For SOCS-3 induction experiments, confluent COS1 cells were treated for 5 h with inhibitors of PKC (Ro-31-7549 or GF 109203X) or PLC (U73122) in the presence or absence of cyclic AMP stimuli (forskolin plus rolipram, 8-pCPT-cyclic AMP, or 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cyclic AMP) as described in figure legends. Samples were lysed directly into SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-SOCS-3 and anti-GAPDH antibodies. For PKC down-regulation experiments, COS1 cells were stimulated with 1 μm PMA or DMSO for 48 h and then stimulated for 5 h in the presence of MG132 with PMA, forskolin plus rolipram, or 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cyclic AMP. Following this, cell lysates were immunoblotted using anti-pan-PKC, anti-SOCS-3, and anti-GAPDH antibodies. All experiments were carried out in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 to prevent SOCS-3 degradation following its synthesis (7Sands W.A. Woolson H.D. Milne G.R. Rutherford C. Palmer T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6333-6346Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This allowed us to directly measure effects of cAMP on the de novo synthesis of SOCS-3 protein. COS1 cells were seeded into 6-well plates at ∼1 × 105 cells/cm2 and transfected the following day with either 200 nm EPAC1-specific siRNA (Dharmacon; catalogue number M-007676-01), PKCα-, or PKCδ-specific siRNA (Qiagen HP validated siRNA, catalogue number SI00605927 or catalogue number SI02660539, respectively), phospholipase Cϵ (Ambion; PLCE1 validated siRNA, catalogue number 4390824), or nontargeting control oligonucleotides (Qiagen AllStars Negative Control siRNA, catalogue number 1027280) using Oligofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the protocols described previously (16Kooistra M.R. Corada M. Dejana E. Bos J.L. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4966-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The transfection was repeated the following day, and experiments were carried out 2 days later. For C/EBPβ siRNA experiments, COS1 cells were grown in either 6-well or 12-well plates. C/EBPβ siRNA (Qiagen validated siRNA; catalogue number SI02777292) was used at a concentration of 50 nm, and transfections were carried out for 24 h in serum-containing medium using HiPerFect reagent (Qiagen). All siRNA experiments were confirmed using a second siRNA targeting a different region in the gene of interest. The second EPAC1 siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon (catalogue number D-007676-03-0005), and siRNAs to C/EBPβ (catalogue number SI00073619), PLCϵ (catalogue number SI00115521), PKCα (catalogue number SI00605934), and PKCδ (catalogue number SI00301329) were all purchased from Qiagen. COS1 cells were harvested in 300 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing phosphatase and protease inhibitor mixtures (Roche Applied Science) following stimulation with 10 μm forskolin plus 10 μm rolipram or 10 μm 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cyclic AMP. Cell suspensions were then subjected to freeze-thaw at −80 °C followed by lysis with seven strokes of a 26½-gauge needle attached to a disposable syringe. Unbroken cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C after which the supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 75,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was retained, and the pellet fraction was washed an additional two times with phosphate-buffered saline. Following this, the supernatant and pellet fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-total PKCα, anti-phospho-PKCα/β (Thr-638/641; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-total PKCδ, anti-phospho-PKCδ/θ (Ser-643/676; Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-RACK1 antibodies as detailed in figure legends. Cells were harvested by scraping into 300 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and then samples were electrophoresed on 12% resolving gels before being electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in either 5% (w/v) milk powder in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST) or 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for phospho-specific antibodies and then incubated overnight in primary antibody at 4 °C. Blots were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in appropriate secondary antibody and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence following the manufacturer's instructions. Nonsaturating exposures from multiple experiments were quantified densitometrically using ImageJ software (rsbweb.nih.gov). SOCS-3 densitometric values were usually normalized to the expression of GAPDH protein in the same sample, and PKC levels were normalized to the expression of RACK1 protein. Statistical significance was determined using one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni post test. The two-tailed t test was also used, where appropriate. Previously we had shown in human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts that EPAC1 and its downstream target, Rap1 GTPase, mediate novel signaling linking elevations in intracellular cyclic AMP to activation of C/EBP transcription factors and induction of the SOCS-3 gene (7Sands W.A. Woolson H.D. Milne G.R. Rutherford C. Palmer T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6333-6346Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 10Yarwood S.J. Borland G. Sands W.A. Palmer T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6843-6853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We show here that in COS1 cells stimulation with the EPAC-selective cyclic AMP analogue, 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cyclic AMP (8Me), is sufficient to induce expression of SOCS-3 (Fig. 1a). Moreover, depletion of endogenous levels of EPAC1 with specific siRNA blocks induction of the SOCS-3 protein by 8Me and by a combination of the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin and the type 4 phosphodiesterase inhibitor rolipram (F/R). These results demonstrate that EPAC is necessary for the induction of the SOCS-3 gene by cyclic AMP in COS1 cells. To further understand the mechanisms by which EPAC activation is coupled to SOCS-3 induction, we tested the involvement of the cellular target of EPAC, the Rap1GTPase, in signal transduction to the SOCS-3 gene. Treatment with siRNA specifically targeting the Rap1a isoform was found to cause a significant reduction in Rap1 expression in COS1 cells (Fig. 1b). This was concomitant with a significant reduction in the ability of F/R to stimulated SOCS-3 induction in these cells (Fig. 1b). The ability of Rap1a siRNA to reduce SOCS-3 induction by F/R was comparable with the level of inhibition achieved with EPAC1 siRNA (Fig. 1a). This suggests that Rap1GTPase lies downstream of EPAC in the EPAC-dependent induction of SOCS-3 by cyclic AMP in COS1 cells. To verify the specificity of our EPAC1 and Rap1a siRNA toward their respective genes, we used a second siRNA sequence targeting a different region of either gene as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” These additional siRNAs were also found to effectively inhibit SOCS-3 induction in response to F/R (supplemental Fig. 1) thereby confirming the specificity of gene knockdown. We did note however that whereas EPAC1 siRNA almost completely ablates EPAC1 expression in COS1 cells, it does not completely ablate SOCS-3 induction by F/R (Fig. 1a). This suggests that there may also be additional EPAC1-independent mechanisms coupling cyclic AMP to SOCS-3 induction in these cells. This mechanism is unlikely to involve PKA because we have previously shown that SOCS-3 induction by F/R is insensitive to the PKA inhibitor, H-89, in a range of different cell types (7Sands W.A.

Chem. 2008; 283: 6843-6853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that a cyclic AMP GEF other than EPAC1 may be involved. The only other cyclic AMP GEFs known to activate Rap1 in response to cyclic AMP elevation are EPAC2 and PDZ-GEF1, otherwise known as CNRasGEF or RapGEF2 and PDZ-GEF2 (19Pham N. Cheglakov I.

Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Zwartkruis F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1593: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We therefore used a specific antibody to test whether COS1 cells express significant amounts of EPAC2 protein (Fig. 1d). We found that although EPAC2 protein is abundantly expressed in rat cerebellum, we could not detect any EPAC2 in COS1 cells (Fig. 1c). This is consistent with the recent findings of Islam et al. (21Islam D. Zhang N. Wang P. Li H. Brubaker P.L. Gaisano H.Y. Wang Q. Jin T. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 296: E174-E181Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) who were also unable to detect EPAC2 expression in these cells using immunofluorescence. We next tested the involvement of PDZ-GEF1 in mediating SOCS-3 induction by cyclic AMP in COS1 cells. However, we could not detect expression of PDZ-GEF1 in COS1 cells using specific antibodies (Fig. 1d). Moreover, when we overexpressed PDZ-GEF1 or PDZ-GEF2 cDNAs (results not shown) in COS1 cells, we found that they actually inhibited SOCS-3 induction by F/R (Fig. 1d), which is in contrast to overexpression of EPAC1 that induced SOCS-3 expression (Fig. 1d). We therefore conclude that neither EPAC2 nor PDZ-GEF1/2 is involved in SOCS induction by cyclic AMP in COS1 cells. EPAC1 therefore is the principal cyclic AMP GEF present in these cells that mediates induction of SOCS-3 through the activation of Rap1a. The fact that EPAC1 siRNA does not completely ablate SOCS-3 induction in these cells is because of the presence of an EPAC1-insensitive signaling component that is also required for full induction of the SOCS-3 gene by cyclic AMP. Formation of the second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG), through cleavage of plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC isoforms is one of the fundamental cellular signaling responses. Classically, PLC signaling is thought to be initiated through two major routes as follows: activation of PLCβ by Gq-coupled receptors or free βγ dimers or phosphorylation and activation of PLCγ by receptor or nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. However, there are now six known families of PLC isoforms, each with unique regulatory requirements (22Bunney T.D. Katan M. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 640-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Indeed, recent work now points toward an involvement of PLC in cyclic AMP signaling initiated by Gsα-coupled receptors. This is based on the findings that EPAC couples elevations in intracellular cyclic AMP to activation of PLCϵ through Rap2 (23Schmidt M. Evellin S. Weernink P.A. von Dorp F. Rehmann H. Lomasney J.W. Jakobs K.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1020-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). However, because Rap1 and Rap2 share GEFs, GAPs, and effectors in common (24Ohba Y. Mochizuki N. Matsuo K. Yamashita S. Nakaya M. Hashimoto Y. Hamaguchi M. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6074-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), it is likely that Rap1 activation by cyclic AMP may couple to the activation of PLCϵ in COS1 cells. To test for an involvement of PLC in cyclic AMP-induced SOCS-3 induction, we stimulated COS1 cells for 5 h with F/R and inhibited endogenous PLC activity by co-incubation with the general PLC inhibitor U73122 (10 or 50 μm) or its inactive control U73343. Immunoblotting with anti-SOCS-3 antibodies demonstrated that F/R treatment evoked significant increases in SOCS-3 expression in COS1 cells that were completely blocked by co-incubation with 50 μm U73122 but not U73343 (Fig. 2a). This suggests that one or more PLC isoforms may be involved in the induction of SOCS-3 by cyclic AMP in COS1 cells. To investigate a specific role for PLCϵ in EPAC-dependent SOCS-3 induction, COS1 cells were treated with various concentrations of PKCϵ-specific siRNA, and the effect on PKCϵ expression was monitored by Western blotting (Fig. 2b). Concentrations of PLCϵ siRNA between 200 and 400 nm were found to both reduce PLCϵ expression in COS1 cells and inhibit SOCS-3 induction by F/R (Fig. 2b). A second control siRNA targeting a different region of PLCϵ was also found to significantly decrease SOCS-3 induction by F/R in these cells demonstrating the specificity of the knockdown (supplemental Fig. 1). To test for a specific involvement of PLCϵ in mediating downstream signaling from EPAC to the SOCS-3 gene, we tested the ability of PLCϵ siRNA to block SOCS-3 induction by the EPAC-selective analogue 8Me (Fig. 2c). 8Me and F/R each induced a robust increase in SOCS-3 expression, which was completely ablated by treatment with PLCϵ siRNA (Fig. 2c). PMA also induced a strong induction of SOCS-3; however, in this case the induction was insensitive to the PLCϵ siRNA (Fig. 2c). This is explained by the fact that PMA exerts its actions downstream of PLC by directly activating PKC isoforms. Together, these results demonstrate that PLCϵ lies downstream of EPAC in a signaling pathway connecting increases in intracellular cyclic AMP concentrations to induction of the SOCS-3 gene in COS1 cells. One of the best known consequences of PLC activation is production of DAG and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, leading to Ca2+ mobilization and activation of PKC. To test for an involvement of Ca2+ in EPAC-dependent SOCS-3 induction, COS1 cells were stimulated with various concentrations of the EPAC activator, 8Me, in the presence or absence of the cell-permeable Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM (Fig. 3a). Treatment with BAPTA-AM markedly reduced SOCS-3 induction in response to 8Me (Fig. 3a). Similar results were seen when SOCS-3 was induced by F/R rather than 8Me (Fig. 3b). These results suggest that intracellular Ca2+ is required for SOCS-3 induction by cyclic AMP and EPAC in COS1 cells. To further test the involvement of products of PLC activity in SOCS-3 induction, we tested the ability of various concentrations of the cell-permeable DAG analogue OAG to stimulate SOCS-3 induction in COS1 cells (Fig. 3c). We found that OAG treatment was sufficient to induce expression of SOCS-3 and that this induction was ablated by co-incubation with BAPTA-AM (Fig. 3c), indicating that intracellular Ca2+ is required for OAG action. This suggests that DAG production is sufficient for Ca2+-dependent SOCS-3 induction in COS1 cells, indicating an involvement of downstream signaling from PLC in regulating th"

In high burden regions for malnutrition, the treatment of individual children is limited by available resources. Here, we evaluate a large-scale distribution of a nutritional supplement on the prevention of wasting.A new ready-to-use food (RUF) was developed as a diet supplement for children under three. The intervention consisted of six monthly distributions of RUF during the 2007 hunger gap in a district of Maradi region, Niger, for approximately 60,000 children (length: 60-85 cm). At each distribution, all children over 65 cm had their Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) recorded. Admission trends for severe wasting (WFH<70% NCHS) in Maradi, 2002-2005 show an increase every year during the hunger gap. In contrast, in 2007, throughout the period of the distribution, the incidence of severe acute malnutrition (MUAC<110 mm) remained at extremely low levels. Comparison of year-over-year admissions to the therapeutic feeding program shows that the 2007 blanket distribution had essentially the same flattening effect on the seasonal rise in admissions as the 2006 individualized treatment of almost 60,000 children moderately wasted.These results demonstrate the potential for distribution of fortified spreads to reduce the incidence of severe wasting in large population of children 6-36 months of age. Although further information is needed on the cost-effectiveness of such distributions, these results highlight the importance of re-evaluating current nutritional strategies and international recommendations for high burden areas of childhood malnutrition."
https://openalex.org/W2082964395,"The integrity of lung alveoli is maintained by proper circulating levels of α-1 antitrypsin (A1AT). Next to cigarette smoking, A1AT deficiency is a major risk factor for lung emphysema development. We recently reported that in addition to neutralizing neutrophil elastases in the extracellular compartment, A1AT is internalized by lung endothelial cells and inhibits apoptosis. We hypothesized that the intracellular uptake of A1AT by endothelial cells may be required for its protective function;therefore, we studied the mechanisms of A1AT internalization by primary rat lung microvascular endothelial cells and the effect of cigarette smoke on this process both in vitro and in vivo (in mice). Purified A1AT was taken up intracellularly by endothelial cells in a time-dependent, dose-dependent, and conformer-specific manner and was detected in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells of nondiseased human lung sections. Despite a critical role for caveoli in endothelial cell endocytosis in general, specific inhibition of clathrin-mediated, but not caveoli-mediated, endocytosis profoundly decreased A1AT internalization and reversed the A1AT's antiapoptotic action. Further more, A1AT associated with clathrin heavy chains, but not with caveolin-1 in the plasma membrane fraction of endothelial cells. Interestingly, cigarette smoke exposure significantly inhibited A1AT uptake both in endothelial cells and in the mouse lung and altered the intracellular distribution of clathrin heavy chains. Our results suggest that clathrin-mediated endocytosis regulates A1AT intracellular function in the lung endothelium and may be an important determinant of the serpin's protection against developing cigarette smoke-induced emphysema.

https://openalex.org/W2066507448,"Recent studies in human fibroblasts have provided a new general paradigm of tumor suppression according to which oncogenic signaling produces DNA damage and this, in turn, results in ATM/p53-dependent cellular senescence. Here, we have tested this model in a variety of murine experimental systems. Overexpression of oncogenic Ras in murine fibroblasts efficiently induced senescence but this occurred in the absence of detectable DNA damage signaling, thus suggesting a fundamental difference between human and murine cells. Moreover, lung adenomas initiated by endogenous levels of oncogenic K-Ras presented abundant senescent cells, but undetectable DNA damage signaling. Accordingly, K-Ras-driven adenomas were also senescent in Atm-null mice, and the tumorigenic progression of these lesions was only modestly accelerated by Atm-deficiency. Finally, we have examined chemically-induced fibrosarcomas, which possess a persistently activated DNA damage response and are highly sensitive to the activity of p53. We found that the absence of Atm favored genomic instability in the resulting tumors, but did not affect the persistent DNA damage response and did not impair p53-dependent tumor suppression. All together, we conclude that oncogene-induced senescence in mice may occur in the absence of a detectable DNA damage response. Regarding murine Atm, our data suggest that it plays a minor role in oncogene-induced senescence or in p53-dependent tumor suppression, being its tumor suppressive activity probably limited to the maintenance of genomic stability."
https://openalex.org/W2115754379,"Clarin-1 is the protein product encoded by the gene mutated in Usher syndrome III. Although the molecular function of clarin-1 is unknown, its primary structure predicts four transmembrane domains similar to a large family of membrane proteins that include tetraspanins. Here we investigated the role of clarin-1 by using heterologous expression and in vivo model systems. When expressed in HEK293 cells, clarin-1 localized to the plasma membrane and concentrated in low density compartments distinct from lipid rafts. Clarin-1 reorganized actin filament structures and induced lamellipodia. This actin-reorganizing function was absent in the modified protein encoded by the most prevalent North American Usher syndrome III mutation, the N48K form of clarin-1 deficient in N-linked glycosylation. Proteomics analyses revealed a number of clarin-1-interacting proteins involved in cell-cell adhesion, focal adhesions, cell migration, tight junctions, and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Consistent with the hypothesized role of clarin-1 in actin organization, F-actin-enriched stereocilia of auditory hair cells evidenced structural disorganization in Clrn1(-/-) mice. These observations suggest a possible role for clarin-1 in the regulation and homeostasis of actin filaments, and link clarin-1 to the interactive network of Usher syndrome gene products."
https://openalex.org/W2067876601,"Background Invasive species are a serious problem in ecosystems, but are difficult to eradicate once established. Predictive methods can be key in determining which areas are of concern regarding invasion by such species to prevent establishment [1]. We assessed the geographic potential of four Eurasian cyprinid fishes (common carp, tench, grass carp, black carp) as invaders in North America via ecological niche modeling (ENM). These “carp” represent four stages of invasion of the continent (a long-established invader with a wide distribution, a long-established invader with a limited distribution, a spreading invader whose distribution is expanding, and a newly introduced potential invader that is not yet established), and as such illustrate the progressive reduction of distributional disequilibrium over the history of species' invasions. Methodology/Principal Findings We used ENM to estimate the potential distributional area for each species in North America using models based on native range distribution data. Environmental data layers for native and introduced ranges were imported from state, national, and international climate and environmental databases. Models were evaluated using independent validation data on native and invaded areas. We calculated omission error for the independent validation data for each species: all native range tests were highly successful (all omission values <7%); invaded-range predictions were predictive for common and grass carp (omission values 8.8 and 19.8%, respectively). Model omission was high for introduced tench populations (54.7%), but the model correctly identified some areas where the species has been successful; distributional predictions for black carp show that large portions of eastern North America are at risk. Conclusions/Significance ENMs predicted potential ranges of carp species accurately even in regions where the species have not been present until recently. ENM can forecast species' potential geographic ranges with reasonable precision and within the short screening time required by proposed U.S. invasive species legislation."
https://openalex.org/W1971084689,"Resistance and relapse are still primary causes that result in poor effectiveness of chemotherapy in malignant gliomas. Therefore, development of new therapeutic strategies requires the identification of key molecular pathways regulating chemoresistance. We previously found that abnormal high expression of the Tie2 receptor in gliomas was associated with tumor malignancy. Here, we studied the role of Tie2 activation in drug resistance by testing the cytotoxicity of several chemotherapeutic drugs in a panel of human glioma cell lines and brain tumor stem cells and found that Tie2 activation was significantly related to chemoresistance. The essential role of Tie2 in this phenotype was illustrated by silencing Tie2 using specific siRNA, and the subsequent abrogation of the angiopoietin 1 (Ang1)-mediated chemoresistance. Using quantitative real-time PCR and functional drug efflux studies, we observed that Tie2 activation resulted in increased expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Consistent with these results, downmodulation of ABCG2 or ABCC2 resulted in the inability of Tie2 activation to induce a chemoresistant phenotype. Our results indicate that Tie2 activation may be important in modifying the evolution of gliomas during conventional chemotherapy regimens, and open new avenues for the search of more effective therapies to avoid the inevitable brain tumor recurrence."

https://openalex.org/W1977840008,"Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is a safe, highly attenuated orthopoxvirus that is being developed as a recombinant vaccine vector for immunization against a number of infectious diseases and cancers. However, the expression by MVA vectors of large numbers of poxvirus antigens, which display immunodominance over vectored antigens-of-interest for the priming of T cell responses, and the induction of vector-neutralizing antibodies, which curtail the efficacy of subsequent booster immunizations, remain as significant impediments to the overall utility of such vaccines. Thus, genetic approaches that enable the derivation of MVA vectors that are antigenically less complex may allow for rational improvement of MVA-based vaccines.We have developed a genetic complementation system that enables the deletion of essential viral genes from the MVA genome, thereby allowing us to generate MVA vaccine vectors that are antigenically less complex. Using this system, we deleted the essential uracil-DNA-glycosylase (udg) gene from MVA and propagated this otherwise replication-defective variant on a complementing cell line that constitutively expresses the poxvirus udg gene and that was derived from a newly identified continuous cell line that is permissive for growth of wild type MVA. The resulting virus, MVADeltaudg, does not replicate its DNA genome or express late viral gene products during infection of non-complementing cells in culture. As proof-of-concept for immunological 'focusing', we demonstrate that immunization of mice with MVADeltaudg elicits CD8+ T cell responses that are directed against a restricted repertoire of vector antigens, as compared to immunization with parental MVA. Immunization of rhesus macaques with MVADeltaudg-gag, a udg(-) recombinant virus that expresses an HIV subtype-B consensus gag transgene, elicited significantly higher frequencies of Gag-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells following both primary (2-4-fold) and booster (2-fold) immunizations as compared to the udg(+) control virus MVA-gag, as determined by intracellular cytokine assay. In contrast, levels of HIV Gag-specific antibodies were elicited similarly in macaques following immunization with MVADeltaudg-gag and MVA-gag. Furthermore, both udg(-) and udg(+) MVA vectors induced comparatively similar titers of MVA-specific neutralizing antibody responses following immunization of mice (over a 4-log range: 10(4)-10(8) PFU) and rhesus macaques. These results suggest that the generation of MVA-specific neutralizing antibody responses are largely driven by input MVA antigens, rather than those that are synthesized de novo during infection, and that the processes governing the generation of antiviral antibody responses are more readily saturated by viral antigen than are those that elicit CD8+ T cell responses.Our identification of a spontaneously-immortalized (but not transformed) chicken embryo fibroblast cell line (DF-1) that is fully permissive for MVA growth and that can be engineered to stably express MVA genes provides the basis for a genetic system for MVA. DF-1 cells (and derivatives thereof) constitute viable alternatives, for the manufacture of MVA-based vaccines, to primary CEFs -- the conventional cell substrate for MVA vaccines that is not amenable to genetic complementation strategies due to these cells' finite lifespan in culture. The establishment of a genetic system for MVA, as illustrated here to allow udg deletion, enables the generation of novel replication-defective MVA mutants and expands the repertoire of genetic viral variants that can now be explored as improved vaccine vectors."

Both H5N1 strains, originally isolated from patients in 1997 and 2004, showed significantly higher polymerase activity compared with two classical human strains, A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/NT/60/68 (H3N2) in vitro. This increased polymerase activity correlated with enhanced promoter binding. The N-terminal region of the PA subunit was the major determinant of this enhanced promoter activity.Overall we suggest that the N-terminal region of the PA subunit of two recent H5N1 strains can influence promoter binding and we speculate this may be a factor in their virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2083930605,"Background In many cooperatively breeding vertebrates, subordinates assist a dominant pair to raise the dominants' offspring. Previously, it has been suggested that subordinates may help in payment for continued residency on the territory (the ‘pay-to-stay hypothesis’), but payment might also be reciprocated or might allow subordinates access to reproductive opportunities. Methodology/Principal Findings We measured dominant and subordinate female alloparental brood care and reproductive success in four separate experiments and show that unrelated female dominant and subordinate cichlid fish care for each other's broods (alloparental brood care), but that there is no evidence for reciprocal ‘altruism’ (no correlation between alloparental care received and given). Instead, subordinate females appear to pay with alloparental care for own direct reproduction. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest subordinate females pay with alloparental care to ensure access to the breeding substrate and thereby increase their opportunities to lay their own clutches. Subordinates' eggs are laid, on average, five days after the dominant female has produced her first brood. We suggest that immediate reproductive benefits need to be considered in tests of the pay-to-stay hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2091724588,"Background The role of the MYC oncogene in the apoptotic pathways is not fully understood. MYC has been reported to protect cells from apoptosis activation but also to sensitize cells to apoptotic stimuli. We have previously demonstrated that the down-regulation of Myc protein activates apoptosis in melanoma cells and increases the susceptibility of cells to various antitumoral treatments. Beyond the well-known role in the G1→S transition, MYC is also involved in the G2-M cell cycle phases regulation. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study we have investigated how MYC could influence cell survival signalling during G2 and M phases. We used the microtubules damaging agent paclitaxel (PTX), to arrest the cells in the M phase, in a p53 mutated melanoma cell line with modulated Myc level and activity. An overexpression of Myc protein is able to increase endoreduplication favoring the survival of cells exposed to antimitotic poisoning. The PTX-induced endoreduplication is associated in Myc overexpressing cells with a reduced expression of MAD2, essential component of the molecular core of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), indicating an impairment of this checkpoint. In addition, for the first time we have localized Myc protein at the spindle poles (centrosomes) during pro-metaphase in different cell lines. Conclusions The presence of Myc at the poles during the prometaphase could be necessary for the Myc-mediated attenuation of the SAC and the subsequent induction of endoreduplication. In addition, our data strongly suggest that the use of taxane in antitumor therapeutic strategies should be rationally based on the molecular profile of the individual tumor by specifically analyzing Myc expression levels."
https://openalex.org/W2081750772,"Background Mycobacteria produce two unique families of cytoplasmic polymethylated polysaccharides - the methylglucose lipopolysaccharides (MGLPs) and the methylmannose polysaccharides (MMPs) - the physiological functions of which are still poorly defined. Towards defining the roles of these polysaccharides in mycobacterial physiology, we generated knock-out mutations of genes in their putative biosynthetic pathways. Methodology/Principal Findings We report here on the characterization of the Rv1208 protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its ortholog in Mycobacterium smegmatis (MSMEG_5084) as the enzymes responsible for the transfer of the first glucose residue of MGLPs. Disruption of MSMEG_5084 in M. smegmatis resulted in a dramatic decrease in MGLP synthesis directly attributable to the almost complete abolition of glucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase activity in this strain. Synthesis of MGLPs in the mutant was restored upon complementation with wild-type copies of the Rv1208 gene from M. tuberculosis or MSMEG_5084 from M. smegmatis. Conclusions/Significance This is the first evidence linking Rv1208 to MGLP biosynthesis.

Here we show that these same sites are also phosphorylated by ATR in response to various types of replication stress including UVC, aphidicolin, and hydroxyurea.

Furthermore, we show that Artemis interacts with the F-box protein Fbw7, and that this interaction regulates cyclin E degradation through the SCFFbw7 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The interaction between Artemis and Fbw7 is regulated by phosphorylation of Ser516 and Ser645 sites that occur in response to replication stress.

As an arm of the DNA damage response cell cycle checkpoints maintain genomic stability by allowing time for DNA repair processing to be completed before resumption of the cell cycle (1.Harper J.W.

Much progress has been made on the elucidation of the mechanisms that lead to the detection of structural alterations in DNA and the implementation of checkpoint pathways, however, the processes by which the cell cycle reinitiates are not as well understood. Resumption of cell cycle progression after genotoxic stress is usually referred to as the recovery process. Recent findings have shown that recovery is an active process and not simply an attenuation of the initial checkpoint response (2.Bartek J. Lukas J. Curr. Opin.

Cdk2 and its partners cyclin E and cyclin A are crucial regulators of G1/S transition and progression through S phase. Cyclin E accumulates in late G1 as a result of E2F-mediated transcriptional regulation, which has been previously activated by cyclin D-associated kinases. During S phase cyclin E is degraded by two independent pathways. Cyclin E unbound to Cdk2 is targeted by the Cul3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase (13.Singer J.D. Gurian-West M. Clurman B. Roberts J.M.

Interestingly, ectopic overexpression of cyclin E has been shown to accelerate entry into S phase, but somewhat paradoxically also slows progression through S phase (22.Ohtsubo M. Roberts J.M.

DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 556-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). With regard to its cell cycle functions, we have shown previously that Artemis is involved in regulating the recovery from the G2 checkpoint in response to ionizing radiation (IR) through regulation of the activation of cyclin B-Cdk1 (28.Geng L. Zhang X. Zheng S. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2625-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 32.Zhang X. Succi J. Feng Z. Prithivirajsingh S. Story M.D. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9207-9220Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Artemis was shown to be phosphorylated on its Ser516 and Ser645 residues by ATM, and mutation of these two sites to alanine led to a slower recovery from the G2/M checkpoint. In prior work (32.Zhang X. Succi J. Feng Z. Prithivirajsingh S. Story M.D. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9207-9220Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) we have also shown that Artemis is phosphorylated in vivo in response to UV irradiation, however, the functional significance of phosphorylation in response to this agent has not been elucidated. We show here that Artemis is involved in the recovery from the S phase checkpoint in response to replication fork blocking lesions, and that this function is dependent upon phosphorylation at the Ser516 and Ser645 sites by ATR. Furthermore, we show that the role of Artemis in S phase checkpoint recovery is through an involvement in the degradation of cyclin E by the SCFFbw7 E3 ligase complex. Artemis interacts with Fbw7 to promote degradation of cyclin E and to enhance recovery from S phase. Phosphorylation of Artemis on Ser516 and Ser645 promotes the interaction between Artemis and Fbw7, thus facilitating the turnover of cyclin E and S phase recovery. HEK293 cells stably expressing Artemis alleles, tissue culture protocols, and DNA transfections were previously described (28.Geng L. Zhang X. Zheng S. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell.

FLAG-Fbw7 expression plasmids were gifts from B. Clurman (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA). Artemis siRNAs were described previously (32.Zhang X. Succi J. Feng Z.

Cyclin E (1214563-H/904; 1214564) and ATR (1214725/747; 121426-H) siRNAs were purchased from Sigma. Immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation (IP), and IP kinase assays have been previously described (32.Zhang X. Succi J. Feng Z. Prithivirajsingh S. Story M.D. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9207-9220Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors and 10 mm sodium fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 8 mm β-glycerol phosphate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Cell lysates were then incubated with primary antibody for 2 h and protein A/G beads for an additional 45 min at 4 °C. IP kinase assays were carried out in 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 70 mm NaCl, 10 μm ATP, 0.1 μg/μl histone H1 (Millipore), and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at room temperature for 30 min. pCMV-HA-ubiquitin was transfected into HEK293 cells to facilitate detection of ubiquitin conjugates. Transfection efficiency was monitored by cotransfection of 100 ng of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) plasmid. Twenty-four h after transfection cells were treated with MG-132 for 4 h and cell lysates were prepared for immunoblotting. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry and BrdUrd labeling were previously described (28.Geng L. Zhang X. Zheng S. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2625-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with 10 μm BrdUrd for 15 or 30 min prior to harvesting, or released into regular medium and harvested at various time points. Cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and incubated in PBS containing 4% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. DNA was denatured in 2 n HCl for 20 min, washed with PBS, and resuspended in 0.1 m sodium tetraborate. Cells were exposed to monoclonal anti-BrdUrd (BD Transduction Laboratories) for 1 h, washed with PBS, and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat antibodies to mouse IgG (Jackson Laboratories) for 30 min. After washing with PBS, cells were resuspended in PBS containing 40 μg/ml propidium iodide, and 50 μg/ml DNase-free RNase (Calbiochem). Fluorescence was measured on a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using 488 nm laser excitation. We have shown previously that in response to IR Artemis is rapidly phosphorylated on four serine residues, namely Ser516, Ser534, Ser538, and Ser645 (28.Geng L. Zhang X. Zheng S. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2625-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Two of these sites, Ser534 and Ser538, undergo rapid phosphorylation and dephosphorylation within 1–2 h after exposure to DNA damage, whereas the other two sites, Ser516 and Ser645, exhibit rapid and prolonged phosphorylation for up to approximately 24 h. We have also previously shown that Artemis is phosphorylated in response to UV irradiation (32.Zhang X. Succi J. Feng Z. Prithivirajsingh S. Story M.D. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9207-9220Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we therefore examined the kinetics of these phosphorylation events in response to UV. Phosphorylation at Ser516 and Ser645 was observable at 30 min, peaked from 2 to 12 h, and then slowly declined until 24 h (Fig. 1A). Rapid and prolonged phosphorylation of Artemis at Ser516 and Ser645 was also observed in vivo in response to aphidicolin and hydroxurea (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Thus similar to IR, Artemis also exhibits rapid and prolonged phosphorylation at Ser516 and Ser645 in response to replication stress. We have also shown previously that ATM was the principal kinase for phosphorylation of Ser516 and Ser645 in response to IR (28.Geng L. Zhang X. Zheng S. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2625-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To determine the kinase responsible for UV-induced phosphorylation at these two sites, we examined their phosphorylation after UV in the presence of caffeine, an inhibitor of ATM and ATR. Reduced phosphorylation was observed in the cells treated with caffeine (Fig. 1C). To further identify the kinase, we used siRNA to deplete ATR, and then examined the phosphorylation at each site. siRNA-mediated knockdown of ATR significantly reduced the phosphorylation at each site (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that ATR is the major kinase responsible for Artemis phosphorylation at the Ser516 and Ser645 sites in response to UV. We previously reported that HEK293 cells expressing a mutant of Artemis in which the serines at Ser516 and Ser645 had been mutated to alanine residues exhibited defective recovery from the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint after IR (28.Geng L. Zhang X. Zheng S. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2625-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 32.Zhang X. Succi J. Feng Z. Prithivirajsingh S. Story M.D. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9207-9220Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Because UV induces a significant S phase arrest, we examined this Artemis mutant (termed S516A/S645A) to determine whether these two phosphorylation sites also affect the recovery from the S phase checkpoint. As shown (Fig. 2A), cells expressing the S516A/S645A mutant showed an accumulation of cells in S phase 12–18 h after UV treatment compared with cells expressing wild-type Artemis. In addition, expression of a mutant Artemis (S516D/S645D) in which the serines at 516 and 645 were mutated to aspartic acid residues to mimic phosphorylation, resulted in an essentially wild-type phenotype. To further support these results, cells were incubated with BrdUrd for 15 min, treated with UV, and returned to regular medium. Twelve h later cells expressing the S516A/S645A mutant exhibited a higher S phase content compared with cells expressing wild-type Artemis or the S516D/S645D mutant (Fig. 2B). To ensure that the accumulation in S phase observed after UV treatment was not the result of effects in the G1 or G2/M stages of the cell cycle, we synchronized cells at early S phase by treatment with aphidicolin, and then released them into regular medium without drug. At 12 h after release a greater accumulation was observed in the G1/S phase in cells expressing the S516A/S645A mutant compared with wild-type Artemis or the S516D/S645D mutant (Fig. 2C). In addition, we repeated this experiment, but introduced a 30-min pulse labeling of the cells with BrdUrd immediately before harvesting. Again this experiment indicated that a greater fraction of cells expressing the S516A/S645A mutant were in S phase compared with the control cell lines (Fig. 2D). Finally, we compared cells expressing the S516A/S645A mutant with those expressing the S516D/S645D mutant and found that in the absence of DNA damage the former did not exhibit a prolonged S phase (Fig. S1). Taken together, these results demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser516 and Ser645 of Artemis facilitates recovery from the replication checkpoint in response to DNA damage. A possible explanation for the S phase accumulation in cells expressing the S516A/S645A mutant is a prolongation of the S phase checkpoint via the ATR-Chk1 pathway (36.Bartek J. Lukas C. Lukas J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 792-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 37.Lambert S. Carr A.M. Biochimie. 2005; 87: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, an examination of phosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser345, a marker of S phase checkpoint activation, after exposure of cells to aphidicolin or UV showed no significant differences among the three cell lines expressing the various forms of Artemis (Fig. S2). Thus, prolonged activation of the S phase checkpoint does not explain the accumulation of cells caused by the S516A/S645A mutant. The target of the S phase checkpoint is the cell cycle kinase Cdk2. Using an IP kinase assay we found that the activity of this enzyme was reduced in cells expressing the S516A/S645A mutant particularly at 12 h after UV exposure when the greatest levels of S phase accumulation were observed (Fig. 3A). Thus, the Cdk2 kinase, which is principally responsible for driving cells through S phase, has reduced activity in cells expressing the S516A/S645A Artemis mutant. Cyclin E and cyclin A are the principal cyclins that regulate Cdk2 activity during the S to G2 transition (38.Murray A.W. Cell. 2004; 116: 221-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 39.Neganova I. Lako M. J. Anat. 2008; 213: 30-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 40.Woo R.A. Poon R.Y. Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Ectopic overexpression of cyclin E in specific cell lines is known to cause a delayed progression through S phase (22.Ohtsubo M. Roberts J.M. Science. 1993; 259: 1908-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 23.Resnitzky D. Gossen M. Bujard H. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1669-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 24.Spruck C.H. Won K.A. Reed S.I. Nature. 1999; 401: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 25.Wimmel A. Lucibello F.C. Sewing A. Adolph S. Müller R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 995-997PubMed Google Scholar), and previous studies have shown that replication stress causes an increase in cyclin E levels and a slowing of DNA replication (41.Yin M.B. Guo B. Panadero A. Frank C. Wrzosek C. Slocum H.K. Rustum Y.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined cyclin E protein levels in cells expressing wild-type Artemis, and the S516A/S645A and S516D/S645D mutants after UV irradiation or release from aphidicolin. We observed significantly higher cyclin E levels in cells expressing the S516A/S645A mutant, whereas cyclin A levels were not significantly different (Fig. 3B). Overexpression of cyclin E could slow S phase progression by competing with cyclin A for binding to Cdk2. An examination of the interaction between cyclin A and Cdk2 by co-IP analysis showed that less cyclin A was bound to Cdk2 in cells expressing the S516A/S6456A mutant (Fig. 3C). Thus a likely explanation for our findings is that the S516A/S645A mutant prevents the normal degradation of cyclin E that occurs during S phase upon recovery from the checkpoint, and this failure to degrade cyclin E interferes with the normal activation of cyclin A-Cdk2. As shown above, HEK293 cells that overexpress the S516A/S645A Artemis mutant exhibit a delayed progression through S phase after replication stress. To directly demonstrate that Artemis is required for normal recovery from the S phase checkpoint, we depleted endogenous Artemis by siRNA, exposed the cells to aphidicolin for 14 h, and then released them into regular medium. As shown (Fig. 4, A and B), depletion of Artemis resulted in a slower recovery from the aphidicolin treatment similar to that observed with overexpression of the S516A/S645A mutant. We next determined whether depletion of Artemis also resulted in stabilization of cyclin E as observed above with overexpression of the S516A/S645A mutant. Upon release from aphidicolin cyclin E is strongly stabilized in cells depleted of Artemis compared with cells treated with a control siRNA (Fig. 4C). These findings suggest that Artemis is required for degradation of cyclin E during recovery from the replication stress checkpoint, and that the S516A/S645A mutant acts as a dominant negative in this pathway. To elucidate the mechanism by which Artemis affects cyclin E abundance, we first examined the effect of the S516A/S645A mutation on cyclin E protein stability. Cycloheximide was added to HEK293 cells stably expressing wild-type Artemis or the S516A/S645A mutant 30 min before treatment with UV. Samples were collected at the indicated times and cyclin E levels were determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 5A). The Artemis S516A/S645A mutant exhibited a reduced cyclin E turnover compared with wild-type Artemis. Because cyclin E is degraded through ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, we next assessed the ubiquitylation of cyclin E in vivo. In the presence of the proteosome inhibitor MG-132, levels of ubiquitinated cyclin E were far lower in cells expressing the S516A/S645A mutant compared with cells expressing wild-type Artemis (Fig. 5B). This result demonstrates that ubiquitylation of cyclin E is impaired by the expression of the S516A/S645A Artemis mutant. Cyclin E is a substrate of the Skp1-Cul1-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and the F-box protein or substrate receptor for cyclin E is Fbw7/Cdc4 (16.Koepp D.M. Schaefer L.K. Ye X. Keyomarsi K. Chu C. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Because Artemis affects cyclin E ubiquitylation in vivo we examined whether Artemis interacts with Fbw7. Fbw7 has three isoforms α, β, and γ, two of which, α and γ, have been implicated in the ubiquitylation of cyclin E, although the functions of these isoforms are distinctly different (21.van Drogen F. Sangfelt O. Malyukova A. Matskova L. Yeh E. Means A.R. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 37-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To assay for an interaction between Artemis and Fbw7, we cotransfected HEK293 cells with GST-Artemis and FLAG-Fbw7 α, β, or γ isoforms, and performed reciprocal co-IPs. Interestingly, Artemis co-IPed with the Fbw7 α and γ isoforms, but not with the β isoform (Fig. 5C), which indicates that the interaction is specific for the former two isoforms. Because the phosphorylation state of Artemis affects the stabilization of cyclin E, we examined the interaction between Artemis and the Fbw7 α and γ isoforms after UV irradiation. As shown (Fig. 5D), UV irradiation increased the co-IP between these proteins. Furthermore, prior treatment of the cells with wortmannin decreased the interaction suggesting that phosphorylation of Artemis helped to promote the interaction with Fbw7 α and γ. To confirm this possibility, the co-IP wild-type and S516A/S645A or S516D/S645D mutants of Artemis with Fbw7 α and γ were compared. As shown (Fig. 5E), after UV irradiation the wild-type protein interacted more efficiently than did the S516A/S645A mutant protein (upper panel). Interestingly, the S516D/S645D mutant appeared to exhibit an enhanced interaction particularly in the untreated samples (lower panel). Note, however, that phosphorylation of Artemis is not necessary for the interaction between Fbw7 isoforms and cyclin E (Fig. S3), suggesting that Artemis is required subsequent to cyclin E recruitment. Finally, as shown above (Fig. 1), ATR is required for the phosphorylation of Artemis at Ser516 and Ser645 in response to replication stress. We, therefore, examined whether ATR affected the interaction between Artemis and Fbw7 isoforms, and whether it affected the ubiquitylation of cyclin E. As shown (Fig. 6, A and B), in both cases depletion of ATR by siRNA reduced Artemis-Fbw7 interactions and reduced cyclin E ubiquitylation to levels observed with the expression of the S516A/S645A mutant after exposure to UV irradiation. Taken together, these findings indicate that Artemis is involved in the ubiquitylation of cyclin E by the SCFFbw7 E3 ligase through an interaction with the α and γ isoforms of Fbw7, and that phosphorylation of Artemis on residues Ser516 and Ser645 by ATR positively regulates this association. As we and others have shown previously Artemis is a substrate of both ATM and ATR, and is phosphorylated by at least one of these kinases in response to various types of genotoxic stress (28.Geng L.

In this report we demonstrate that Artemis is phosphorylated at residues Ser516 and Ser645 in response to UV irradiation or aphidocolin exposure by the ATR kinase. Cells that express a mutant of Artemis with these residues converted to alanine exhibit a prolonged S phase and a failure to recover normally from the S phase checkpoint. There are a number of possible mechanisms that could lead to this phenotype. One is that a failure to repair UV-induced lesions would lead to a prolonged checkpoint response. However, whereas Artemis has been reported to have a role in the repair of double strand breaks, no such function has been ascribed for Artemis in the repair of photolesions. Furthermore, Artemis-deficient cells are not sensitive to fork blocking adducts such as those induced by mitomycin C or etoposide (31.Rooney S. Sekiguchi J. Zhu C. Cheng H.L. Manis J. Whitlow S. DeVido J. Foy D. Chaudhuri J. Lombard D. Alt F.W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1379-1390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 35.Wang J. Pluth J.M. Cooper P.K. Cowan M.J. Chen D.J. Yannone S.M. DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 556-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, our results indicate that there is not a prolonged activation of Chk1 in cells expressing the S516A/S645A mutant. Rather, our results indicate that the abnormal recovery from the S phase checkpoint is due to stabilization of cyclin E that preferentially occurred in cells expressing the mutant form of Artemis in comparison to the wild-type protein. Previous studies have shown that ectopic overexpression of cyclin E results in a more rapid transition from the G1 to S phase, but a slower progression through S phase (22.Ohtsubo M. Roberts J.M. Science. 1993; 259: 1908-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 23.Resnitzky D. Gossen M. Bujard H. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1669-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 24.Spruck C.H. Won K.A. Reed S.I. Nature. 1999; 401: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 25.Wimmel A. Lucibello F.C. Sewing A. Adolph S. Müller R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 995-997PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the abnormal stabilization of cyclin E observed due to expression of the S516A/S645A mutant likely accounts for the failure of cells to properly recover from the S phase checkpoint, and indicates that phosphorylation of Artemis at Ser516 and Ser645 is necessary for degradation of cyclin E after genotoxic stress. Depletion of Artemis by siRNA also resulted in the same phenotypic consequences, thus adding support for this model. Our results further show that the reduced degradation of cyclin E during S phase checkpoint recovery in cells expressing the S516A/S645A mutant results in impaired Cdk2 activity concomitant with a reduced interaction between Cdk2 and cyclin A. Thus, high levels of cyclin E appear to interfere with the association between Cdk2 and cyclin A, which is required for reinitiation of DNA replication during checkpoint recovery. Cyclin E is ubiqutinated and ultimately degraded during S phase by the SCFFbw7 E3 ligase complex and the 26 S proteosome (16.Koepp D.M. Schaefer L.K. Ye X. Keyomarsi K. Chu C. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Of the three alternative splice isoforms of Fbw7 only two, α and γ, participate in the ubiquitylation of cyclin E, although with distinct functions (21.van Drogen F. Sangfelt O. Malyukova A. Matskova L. Yeh E. Means A.R. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 37-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Fbw7α is required for the recruitment of Pin1 and cyclin E to the SCFFbw7γ complex to promote prolyl cis/trans isomerization of cyclin E. The isomerized cyclin E is then competent for multiubiquitylation by the SCFFbw7γ complex. Our results also show that expression of wild-type Artemis, but not the S516A/S645A mutant, induces strong ubiquitylation of cyclin E in vivo. Furthermore, Artemis interacts with the Fbw7α and Fbw7γ isoforms, but not with the Fbw7β isoform, in vivo, and this interaction is enhanced by UV irradiation. In addition, consistent with the reduced degradation of cyclin E observed in cells expressing the S516A/S645A mutant, the interaction between the Fbw7α and Fbw7γ isoforms with this mutant protein were reduced, whereas the interactions appeared to be enhanced in cells expressing the S516D/S645D mutant. Nevertheless, the degradation of cyclin E was not enhanced by the S516D/S645D mutant, thus suggesting that Artemis is necessary, but not sufficient, for triggering checkpoint recovery. This is a reasonable scenario because phosphorylation of Artemis occurs rapidly after UV irradiation, whereas the degradation of cyclin E during checkpoint recovery occurs hours later. Thus, our findings indicate that in addition to its well recognized role in the initiation of the replication checkpoint, ATR, via Artemis, also regulates recovery from the checkpoint. This mechanism is highly similar to our published findings showing that ATM regulates recovery from the G2/M checkpoint after IR via phosphorylation of Artemis (28.Geng L. Zhang X. Zheng S. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2625-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 32.Zhang X. Succi J. Feng Z. Prithivirajsingh S. Story M.D. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9207-9220Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A trivial explanation for these findings, namely that Artemis is a substrate of the SCFFbw7 complex and that its overexpression competes with cyclin E is not supported by our results. Overexpression of wild-type Artemis causes increased ubiquitylation of cyclin E and increased interaction with Fbw7α and Fbw7γ, results, which are contrary to the predictions of this model. Rather, Artemis appears to interact with the SCFFbw7 complex to promote ubiquitylation of cyclin E, perhaps acting as a substrate specificity factor to enhance rapid degradation of cyclin E during checkpoint recovery. This model is further supported by our finding that DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of Artemis by ATR enhances its interaction with Fbw7 and the multiubiquitylation of cyclin E. Interestingly, it has recently been shown that cyclin E is a direct phosphorylation substrate of ATR in response to DNA damage indicating that ATR may regulate cyclin E through multiple pathways (46.Matsuoka S. Ballif B.A. Smogorzewska A. McDonald 3rd, E.R. Hurov K.E. Luo J. Bakalarski C.E. Zhao Z. Solimini N. Lerenthal Y. Shiloh Y. Gygi S.P. Elledge S.J. Science. 2007; 316: 1160-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (2386) Google Scholar). Artemis has, in cooperation with DNA-PKCs, a defined role in the cleavage of DNA hairpins at coding joints during V(D)J recombination (29.Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1987-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Artemis also functions in the recovery from the G2/M checkpoint after IR treatment via regulation of the activation of cyclin B-Cdk1 (28.Geng L. Zhang X. Zheng S. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2625-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which showed initially that Artemis has a role in cell cycle regulation. Here we have demonstrated an additional function for Artemis in the recovery from the S phase checkpoint via regulation of cyclin E. Furthermore, we show that the mechanism of this regulation of cyclin E by Artemis is as an interacting partner of the SCFFbw7 E3 ligase complex. Taken together, these findings define a dramatically novel role for Artemis as a component of the ubiquitin-proteosome system. Download .zip (.6 MB) Help with zip files"

We evaluated the functional benefit of 4 months oral glutamine in DMD. Methodology/Principal Findings 30 ambulant DMD boys were included in this double-blind, randomized crossover trial with 2 intervention periods: glutamine (0.5 g/kg/d) and placebo, 4 months each, separated by a 1-month wash-out, at 3 outpatient clinical investigation centers in France. Functional benefit was tested by comparing glutamine versus placebo on change in walking speed at 4 months. Secondary outcome measures were: 2-minute walk test, work, power, muscle mass (urinary creatinine), markers of myofibrillar protein breakdown (urinary 3-methyl-histidine/creatinine), serum creatine phospho-kinase, body composition (fat free mass, fat mass percentage), safety and oral nutrient intake. There was no improvement in the primary end point (walking speed) or in secondary measures of muscle function (2-minute walk test, work, power) in the glutamine group compared with placebo. However, subjects receiving glutamine or placebo showed no deterioration in functional measures over the course of the 9-month trial. No differences in muscle mass, markers of protein breakdown or serum creatine phosho-kinase were observed, except for a blunted increase in fat free mass in the glutamine group which led to a greater increase in fat mass percentage. Glutamine was safe and well-tolerated. Conclusions This trial did not identify additional benefit of 4 months oral glutamine over placebo on muscle mass or function in ambulatory DMD boys. Although apparently safe, current data cannot support routine supplementation in this population as a whole, until further research proves otherwise.

https://openalex.org/W2092447712,"Background Sexual conflict theory predicts sexually antagonistic coevolution of reproductive traits driven by conflicting evolutionary interests of two reproducing individuals. Most studies of the evolutionary consequences of sexual conflicts have, however, to date collectively investigated only a few species. In this study we used the annual herb Collinsia heterophylla to experimentally test the existence and evolutionary consequences of a potential sexual conflict over onset of stigma receptivity. Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted crosses within and between four greenhouse-grown populations originating from two regions. Our experimental setup allowed us to investigate male-female interactions at three levels of geographic distances between interacting individuals. Both recipient and pollen donor identity affected onset of stigma receptivity within populations, confirming previous results that some pollen donors can induce stigma receptivity. We also found that donors were generally better at inducing stigma receptivity following pollen deposition on stigmas of recipients from another population than their own, especially within a region. On the other hand, we found that donors did worse at inducing stigma receptivity in crosses between regions. Interestingly, recipient costs in terms of lowered seed number after early fertilisation followed the same pattern: the cost was apparent only if the pollen donor belonged to the same region as the recipient. Conclusion/Significance Our results indicate that recipients are released from the cost of interacting with local pollen donors when crossed with donors from a more distant location, a pattern consistent with a history of sexually antagonistic coevolution within populations. Accordingly, sexual conflicts may have important evolutionary consequences also in plants."
https://openalex.org/W1967094871,"Both estrogen receptor (ER) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) regulate bone metabolism, and because steroid receptor coactivator (SRC)-2 (TIF-2) enhances ER and PPARgamma activity, we examined the consequences of deletion of SRC-2 on bone using SRC-2 knock out (KO) mice. Loss of SRC-2 resulted in increased bone mass, with SRC-2 KO mice having 80% higher trabecular bone volume as compared with wild type mice. SRC-2 KO mice also had a marked decrease (by 50%) in bone marrow adipocytes. These data suggested that marrow precursor cells in the SRC-2 KO mice may be resistant to the inhibitory effects of endogenous PPARgamma ligands on bone formation. Consistent with this, compared with cultures from wild type mice, marrow stromal cultures from SRC-2 KO mice formed significantly more mineralized nodules (by 3-fold) in the presence of the PPARgamma agonist, rosiglitazone. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we demonstrated that in bone marrow stromal cells, loss of SRC-2 leads to destabilization of the transcription complex at the peroxisome proliferator response elements of a number of PPARgamma target genes, resulting in an overall decrease in the expression of adipocyte-related genes and a marked decrease in adipocyte development. Using ovariectomy with or without estrogen replacement, we also demonstrated that SRC-2 KO mice were partially resistant to the skeletal actions of estrogen. Collectively, these findings indicate that loss of SRC-2 leads to partial skeletal resistance to the ER and PPARgamma, but resistance to PPARgamma is dominant, leading to increased bone mass. Modulating SRC-2 action may, thus, represent a novel therapeutic target for osteoporosis."

A yeast protein DOA1/UFD3 has been shown to bind to CDC48 by both indirect and direct ways (5.Decottignies A. Evain A. Ghislain M. Yeast. 2004; 21: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 6.Ghislain M. Dohmen R.J. Levy F. Varshavsky A.

Biol. 2006; 26: 822-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), suggesting that DOA1 may be involved in ERAD. Evidence indicates that DOA1 directly competes with UFD2 at the same docking site on CDC48, which determines whether a substrate is multiubiquitinated and routed to the proteasome for degradation or deubiquitinated and released for other purposes (8.Rumpf S. Jentsch S. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The direct interaction between DOA1 and Ub was suggested by recent studies (7.Mullally J.E. Chernova T. Wilkinson K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 822-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 9.Russell N.S. Wilkinson K.D. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4844-4854Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Moreover, DOA1 also plays roles in the monoubiquitination of histone H2B and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (10.Lis E.T. Romesberg F.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4122-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and in sorting ubiquitinated membrane proteins into multivesicular bodies (11.Ren J. Pashkova N. Winistorfer S. Piper R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21599-21611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The mammalian homolog of DOA1 is called phospholipase A2-activating protein (PLAA), which can bind to P97/VCP (a CDC48 homolog) with its C-terminal domain PUL (7.Mullally J.E. Chernova T. Wilkinson K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 822-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Having high sequence similarity (31% identity) with DOA1, PLAA is proposed to possess similar function of DOA1. Like DOA1, PLAA has an N-terminal WD40 domain with yet unknown function. The central region of PLAA contains a putative PLAA family ubiquitin-binding (PFU) domain, which is supposed to bind with Ub as observed in yeast DOA1 (7.Mullally J.E. Chernova T. Wilkinson K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 822-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism underlying the function of PLAA remains unclear, Ub binding of PLAA might be the central role that connects ubiquitination and degradation in ERAD. Thus, elucidating the molecular mechanism for specific binding of PLAA with Ub is prerequisite for understanding the function of PLAA as well as DOA1. To further understand the Ub-binding mechanism by which PLAA functions in ERAD pathway, we identified a small Ub-binding domain from human PLAA (12.Hurley J.H. Lee S. Prag G. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) and elucidated the domain structure and Ub-binding properties by NMR and mutagenesis approaches. The DNA sequences encoding UIM-PFU (residues 312–465), PFU (residues 340–465), and PFUC (residues 386–465) were cloned into the pET-32 M vector through BamHI/XhoI sites. For convenience of NMR assignments, PFU or PFUC was renumbered from 3 or 49 to 128 according to amino acid residues of the PFU domain. All of the mutants of PFUC were generated via PCR and cloned into the pET-32 M vector, which produces Trx-fused proteins. These proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity columns (Qiagen), followed by on-column cleavage of the Trx tag by thrombin. UIM (312–331) was cloned into the pGBTNH vector through BamHI/XhoI sites, which produces a GB1-fused protein (13.Bao W.J. Gao Y.G. Chang Y.G. Zhang T.Y. Lin X.J. Yan X.Z. Hu H.Y. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 47: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). GB1-UIM was purified through a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column. UIM-PFU was also cloned into the pGEX-4T-3 vector to produce a GST-fused protein. GST-UIM-PFU was purified through a glutathione affinity column. All of the proteins were further purified by Superdex 75 gel filtration chromatography (GE Healthcare). The procedure for expression and purification of NEDD8 was similar to that for Ub. SUMO-1 was prepared from a GST-fused form followed by thrombin cleavage. Two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled Ub (∼200 μm) in an NMR buffer (20 mm phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 0.01% NaN3, pH 6.5) were recorded at different points of titration with the PLAA fragments, including UIM-PFU, GB1-UIM, PFU, and PFUC and its mutants. 15N-Labeled PFUC and P77A mutant were dissolved into the same buffer to a concentration of about 200 μm, and different amounts of unlabeled Ub or Ub-like proteins were added with each step monitored by acquiring a two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectrum. The average chemical shift changes (Δδ) were used for the binding assay and for the calculation of dissociation constants (KD) (14.Hu H.Y. Horton J.K. Gryk M.R. Prasad R. Naron J.M. Sun D.A.

The PFU and PFUC samples (∼1 mm) were dissolved into the NMR buffer (20 mm phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.01% NaN3, pH 6.5), and the spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a 600-MHz Varian Unity Inova spectrometer. Backbone and side chain assignments were completed by analyzing the following spectra: HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, HNHA, C(CO)NH, H(CCO)NH, and HCCH-TOCSY. Total dihedral angle restraints (Φ/Ψ) were obtained from chemical shifts of 1Hα,13Cα,13Cβ, and 13CO using TALOS (15.Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional 15N- and 13C-edited nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy spectra were acquired to provide the distance restraints for structure computation by using ARIA2.0 (16.Rieping W. Habeck M. Bardiaux B. Bernard A. Malliavin T.E. Nilges M. Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 381-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). A family of 200 structures was calculated using the simulated annealing protocol, and 15 of the lowest energy structures were selected. Structure assessment was performed by PROCHECK (17.Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4281) Google Scholar). The structure of PFUC-Ub complex was calculated based on chemical shift perturbation data by using HADDOCK software (18.de Vries S.J. van Dijk A.D. Krzeminski M. van Dijk M. Thureau A. Hsu V. Wassenaar T. Bonvin A.M. Proteins. 2007; 69: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Fifteen NMR structures of PFUC and one crystal structure of Ub (Protein Data Bank code 1UBQ) were used for mapping the interfaces and docking the structures. The solvent accessibilities of different amino acid residues were calculated by the NACCESS program. Residues with average chemical shift changes (Δδ) greater than the mean value and with high solvent accessibilities were selected as the active residues, whereas the solvent-accessible surface neighbors of these active residues were defined as passive residues. An ambiguous distance restraint of 3.0 Å was invoked between all active residues in one molecule to any atoms within the active and passive residues of the other partner. Initially, 1000 complex structures were generated by rigid body energy minimization, and the best 200 structures with the lowest energy were selected for torsion angle dynamics and Cartesian dynamics calculation in an explicit water solvent. It totally produced one major cluster of about 30 structures. Glutathione-Sepharose beads (30 μl) were washed three times with 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (20 mm phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, pH 7.3), then incubated with 500 μl of GST-UIM-PFU (200 μm, in the phosphate-buffered saline buffer) for 30 min at 4 °C, and washed two times with the same buffer to remove the unbound protein. Whole cell lysate from HEK 293T cells was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. 1 ml of the supernatant was incubated with GST-UIM-PFU-conjugated beads for 30 min. After being washed with 200 μl of the phosphate-buffered saline buffer, the beads were then further washed with 50 μl of the washing buffer (10 mm reduced glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Eventually, 40 μl of the sample eluted from the beads was subjected to Western blotting analysis. GST protein was set as a control. PLAA is a homologous protein of yeast DOA1 (7.Mullally J.E. Chernova T. Wilkinson K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 822-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These proteins share a similar domain architecture (Fig. 1A), consisting of an N-terminal WD40 domain of seven repeats, a central region, and a C-terminal PUL domain that can bind to CDC48 or P97 (5.Decottignies A. Evain A. Ghislain M. Yeast. 2004; 21: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The central region contains a PFU domain with high sequence homology (Fig. 1B), which was previously proposed to bind with Ub (7.Mullally J.E. Chernova T. Wilkinson K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 822-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Interestingly, sequence alignment shows a conserved region in between WD40 and PFU of human PLAA (residues 312–331) that is homologous to the UIM motifs (Fig. 1C). The UIM motifs from S5a subunit of proteasome (19.Wang Q. Young P. Walters K.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 727-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 20.Fujiwara K. Tenno T. Sugasawa K.

Falquet L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 347-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) are critical for the binding (23.Fisher R.D. Wang B. Alam S.L. Higginson D.S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 36621-36627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This implies that, in addition to the PFU domain, the putative UIM motif of PLAA may provide an alternative candidate for binding with Ub. It was previously reported that yeast DOA1 binds with Ub through its central PFU domain (7.Mullally J.E. Chernova T. Wilkinson K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 822-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). By GST pulldown assay, we confirmed that this corresponding region of PLAA (residues 312–465, UIM-PFU) including the putative UIM motif and the PFU domain can bind with mono-Ub, poly-Ub and/or ubiquitinated proteins from cell lysate (Fig. 1D). This suggests that either PFU or probably UIM of PLAA serves as the Ub-binding domain as observed in that of yeast DOA1. To clarify which domain or motif in this region binds with Ub, we labeled Ub with 15N and performed chemical shift perturbation experiments by titration of the three fragments of PLAA: UIM-PFU (residues 312–465), GB1-UIM (residues 312–331), and PFU (residues 340–465), respectively. As expected, the UIM-PFU titration causes significant chemical shift changes of the residues in Ub (Fig. 2A), further corroborating that the central region of PLAA can bind with Ub. However, the putative UIM motif cannot bind with Ub, for no significant change occurs in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of Ub upon its titration (Fig. 2B). By contrast, titration of Ub with PFU also results in chemical shift changes of residues Leu8, Ile44, His68, and Val70 (Fig. 2C) that construct a canonical binding surface on Ub (12.Hurley J.H. Lee S. Prag G. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), strongly supporting that the PFU domain in PLAA possesses Ub binding ability. Because the PFU domain can bind with Ub, we labeled this fragment (PLAA(340–465) or PFU(3–128)) with 15N/13C and partially assigned the backbone resonances. The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the PFU fragment is well dispersed, indicating a well folded domain in this fragment (supplemental Fig. S1). However, the backbone resonances of the N-terminal residues exhibit relatively low intensities or peak missing. The three-dimensional 15N- or 13C-edited nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy spectra also exhibit few nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy signals among the N-terminal residues (data not shown). These all suggest that the N-terminal region of the PFU fragment is flexible and does not adopt a defined conformation. Moreover, titration of the PFU fragment with Ub results in chemical shift perturbation mostly on the C-terminal residues, suggesting that the Ub-binding sites on PFU are located in its C terminus (supplemental Fig. S1). We thus subcloned the Ub-binding domain from PLAA (namely PFUC for PFU core domain, PLAA(386–465)) and determined its solution structure by NMR. The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of PFUC also exhibits well dispersed and homogenous (Fig. 3A). Most of the peaks of PFUC reside in the same positions as they do in the spectrum of PFU (supplemental Fig. S1), indicating that PFUC possesses a compact structure as in the PFU fragment. Again, chemical shift perturbation analysis demonstrates that PFUC still retains the ability to bind with Ub (Fig. 3, B and C), in which the Ile44 residue locates in the center of the canonical binding surface on Ub. To compare the binding abilities of these PLAA fragments, we performed titration of 15N-labeled Ub with UIM-PFU, PFU, and PFUC, respectively, and determined their dissociation constants (KD) (see Fig. 6A). The binding of these three fragments with Ub is relatively weak with same affinities of millimolar range (Table 1). This result demonstrates that the core domain of PFU retains the Ub binding activity and implies that the PFUC domain represents most of the properties of the PFU fragment structurally and functionally.TABLE 1Dissociation constants (KD) for the binding affinities of PFU fragments and its mutants with Ub or Ub-like proteinsPUF and mutantsKDaThe data were obtained from titration of 15N-labeled Ub with different PFU fragments and mutants.

Open table in a new tab We assigned all the chemical shifts of the PFUC domain by NMR. Interestingly, residues 70–80 exhibit duplicate peaks in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum (Fig. 3A), as they do in that of PFU (supplemental Fig. S1), indicating that there are two conformers in solution with slow exchange. The Gly76–Pro77 prolyl bond exists both in the cis- and trans-conformations as evidenced by the characteristic nuclear Overhauser effect correlations between Gly76 and Pro77, as well as the 13Cβ and 13Cγ chemical shifts of Pro77 (supplemental Fig. S2) (26.Schubert M. Labudde D. Oschkinat H. Schmieder P. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Judging from the signal intensities, the two sets of resonance peaks show a population ratio of about 1:1 (50.3% cis versus 49.7% trans), suggesting that the cis- and trans-conformers have the same free energy level. To our knowledge, this is the first illustration of a protein with equal population of the cis- and trans-isomers in solution. Normally, the cis-isoform of a protein occurs with a very low population (5% or so) or is scarcely observed in solution. On the other hand, mutation of Pro77 (P77A) results in only one set of peaks for residues 70–80 in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum (supplemental Fig. S2). This confirms that the Gly76–Pro77 prolyl bond is the main source for the conformational heterogeneity of the PFUC domain in solution. We then performed titration of 15N-labeled PFUC and its P77A mutant with different amounts of Ub (Fig. 6B). The dissociation constants (KD) are 1.8 ± 0.6 and 1.4 ± 0.2 mm for WT PFUC and P77A, respectively (Table 1). Although an ensemble of equal population of cis- and trans-PFUC binds with Ub relatively weakly, the all-trans-conformer of P77A mutant binds Ub with a similar affinity, suggesting that both cis- and trans-conformers have equivalent Ub binding ability. We then obtained two sets of distance restraints for each isomer of PFUC from 15N- and 13C-edited nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy spectra, and calculated the structures of cis and trans conformers independently. A summary of the NMR experimental restraints for structural calculation and statistics for both conformers is presented in supplemental Table S1. Fig. 4A shows an ensemble of the 15 lowest energy structures superimposed on the backbones for the two conformers. Both cis- and trans-isomers fold into a compact globular domain of (α + β) pattern consisting of four β-strands and two α-helices (Fig. 4B). The four β-strands, β1, β2, β3, and β4, arrange into two separate anti-parallel β-sheets. The meander between β2 and β3 contains only one residue of Asp65, and the angle between them is about 60°. However, there are hydrophobic contacts between Val57 in β1 and Val67 in β3 (supplemental Fig. S3), probably stabilizing the atypical fold. The two α-helices arrange at an angle about 45° to each other and keep in contact with the β-sheet of β3 and β4 (Fig. 4B). The major difference of the backbone structures between the cis- and trans-conformers lies in the loop of Ile70–Lys80 around Pro77 (P77 loop) connecting the β3 and β4 strands (Fig. 4C). Sequence analysis indicates that there is no homologous sequence of the known structure in Protein Data Bank data base with that of PFUC. By using the DALI server (27.Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar), we identified a most similar structure (Protein Data Bank code 1G2R, Z = 3.5) of a hypothetical protein YlxR (28.Osipiuk J. Górnicki P. Maj L. Dementieva I. Laskowski R. Joachimiak A. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1747-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This structure shows a folding pattern partially similar with that of PFUC, but the β1β2 sheet in PFUC is missing in the 1G2R structure (supplemental Fig. S3). Although the β1β2 sheet displays a little apart from the core pattern (β-flap), it still contacts with the β3β4 sheet by hydrophobic interactions (supplemental Fig. S3). This structure is not consistent with the previous prediction that PFU may have structural homology with the UEV domain (7.Mullally J.E. Chernova T. Wilkinson K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 822-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12.Hurley J.H. Lee S. Prag G. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Because there is no similar structure deposited in Protein Data Bank, the structure of PFUC could be considered as a novel domain fold. The clear delineation of the binding interface between PFUC and Ub has been brought out by an NMR restraint-guided docking approach (HADDOCK) (18.de Vries S.J. van Dijk A.D. Krzeminski M. van Dijk M. Thureau A. Hsu V. Wassenaar T. Bonvin A.M. Proteins. 2007; 69: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Fig. 5A shows an overlay of 10 lowest interaction energy and water-refined structures. The root mean square deviation of all backbone atoms in the interfaces is 1.2 ± 0.8 Å for the cis-PFUC-Ub complex and 1.1 ± 0.9 Å for trans-PFUC-Ub. Both isomers of PFUC bind Ub on the canonical hydrophobic interfaces mainly constructed by α2-helix of PFUC and β-sheet of Ub. Met105 of PFUC is in close contact with the side chain of Ile44 of Ub by hydrophobic interactions, whereas Asp108 contacts with Arg42 possibly by electrostatic interactions (Fig. 5B). To confirm the binding mode of the PFUC-Ub complex, we performed mutagenesis of the residues that experience larger chemical shift changes upon Ub binding (Fig. 3B) and NMR titration experiments (Fig. 6). Mutation of the residues on α1-helix (L91A and L97A) does not significantly affect the binding, whereas mutation on α2-helix (M105A and D108N) shows increased KD values to several millimolars (Fig. 6C and Table 1). In addition, double mutation of these residues almost abolishes the binding of PFUC with Ub, because the chemical shifts of residues on the canonical binding surface of Ub have no significant changes upon addition of the M105A/D108N mutant. This result demonstrates that PFUC binds Ub through the surface of its C-terminal α2-helix.FIGURE 6Quantitative analysis of the Ub binding affinities of PFUC and its mutants. A, titration of 15N-labeled Ub with three PFU fragments, PFUC, PFU, and UIM-PFU. B, titration of 15N-labeled wild-type and P77A mutant of PFUC with unlabeled Ub. C, titration of 15N-labeled Ub with unlabeled PFUC mutants in α1-helix (L91A and L97A) and in α2-helix (M105A, D108N, and M105A/D108N). D, titration of 15N-labeled Ub with unlabeled PFUC mutants in the P77 loop region (D71N, V72F, and V72G). The average chemical shift changes of Leu71 in Ub are shown in A, C, and D, and those of Ala111 in PFUC or the P77A mutant are shown in B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To define the binding specificity of the PFU core domain, we prepared two Ub-like proteins, NEDD8 and SUMO-1 and determined their binding affinities with PFUC (supplemental Fig. S4). As a result, NEDD8 exhibits similar binding affinity with Ub, whereas SUMO-1 has no PFUC binding ability (Table 1). NEDD8 shows high sequence and structural similarities with Ub, especially the conserved hydrophobic patch (Ile44, Val70, and Leu8) (29.Whitby F.G. Xia G. Pickart C.M. Hill C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34983-34991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). On the contrary, SUMO-1 is quite different from Ub in this characteristic surface; it is reasonable that SUMO-1 has lost the binding ability with PFUC. Therefore, the PFU core domain binds to the Ub-like proteins or domains weakly but specifically with a canonical mode via the conserved hydrophobic interfaces. Some residues, such as Asp71 and Val72 in the P77 loop region, also show large chemical shift changes upon titration of Ub (Fig. 3B). To make clear whether these residues are involved in direct Ub binding, we performed mutations of Asp71 and Val72 and NMR titration experiments. As a result, D71N, V72I, and V72F mutants do not show change of their Ub binding affinities (Fig. 6D and Table 1), suggesting that the loop region is not directly involved in the Ub binding. Intriguingly, the mutants V72K, V72D, V72A, and V72G exhibit significantly enhanced Ub binding affinities (Fig. 6D and Table 1). The V72A and V72G mutations make the side chain smaller in the Val72 position, and the V72K and V72D mutations alter the charges in this position. These four mutations confer the loop more flexible, suggesting that the loop flexibility may considerably affect their Ub binding affinities. Thus, the results demonstrate that the P77 loop does not directly contact Ub but somehow affects PFUC binding with Ub. It was previously reported that the PFU domain of yeast DOA1 binds with both mono- and poly-Ub (7.Mullally J.E. Chernova T. Wilkinson K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 822-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We have characterized the Ub binding specificity of PLAA by identifying a novel small domain that is distinct from other known Ub-binding domains in amino acid sequence and three-dimensional structure. Our structural and biochemical data suggest that this PFUC domain binds Ub through the surfaces mainly in the α-helical region with the Ub surface centered on the Ile44 patch (12.Hurley J.H. Lee S. Prag G. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5B). Because Met105, Asp108, and Gln109 all reside in the α2-helical region, we conclude that PFUC binds with Ub through the surface on the second α-helix (Fig. 7A), which is to some extent analogous to those of some known Ub-binding domains, such as UBA, CUE, and UIM domains (12.Hurley J.H. Lee S. Prag G. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). All of these domains bind Ub on the surface centered by the Ile44 residue of Ub. The UBA and CUE domains are structurally homologous, with a common three-helix bundle structure. UBA (from BMSC-UbP) binds Ub through its α1- and α3-helices as well as the loop between α1 and α2 (Fig. 7B) (30.Chang Y.G. Song A.X. Gao Y.G. Shi Y.H. Lin X.J. Cao X.T. Lin D.H. Hu H.Y. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 1248-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), whereas CUE (from Cue2-1) uses the α1- and α3-helices for the binding (Fig. 7C) (31.Kang R.S. Daniels C.M. Francis S.A. Shih S.C. Salerno W.J. Hicke L. Radhakrishnan I. Cell. 2003; 113: 621-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The single-helical UIM binds Ub through the conserved alanine neighbored by some hydrophobic residues, closely contacting with Ile44 of Ub (Fig. 7D) (19.Wang Q. Young P. Walters K.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 727-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The binding surfaces of double-sided UIM (DUIM) (32.Hirano S. Kawasaki M. Ura H. Kato R. Raiborg C. Stenmark H. Wakatsuki S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 272-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and the inverted UIM (MIU) (33.Lee S. Tsai Y.C. Mattera R. Smith W.J. Kostelansky M.S. Weissman A.M. Bonifacino J.S. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 34.Penengo L. Mapelli M. Murachelli A.G. Confalonieri S. Magri L. Musacchio A. Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Schneider T.R. Cell. 2006; 124: 1183-1195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) are similar to that of normal UIM. The major difference of PFUC binding with Ub is that the flexibility of the P77 loop that considerably affects its Ub binding affinity. Besides, other Ub-binding domains have been identified with different binding patterns. The PHD fold of Pru domain from Rpn13 subunit of proteasome binds the common hydrophobic pocket of Ub through exclusive loops (35.Schreiner P. Chen X. Husnjak K. Randles L. Zhang N. Elsasser S. Finley D. Dikic I. Walters K.J. Groll M. Nature. 2008; 453: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 36.Husnjak K. Elsasser S. Zhang N. Chen X. Randles L. Shi Y. Hofmann K. Walters K.J. Finley D. Dikic I. Nature. 2008; 453: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). However, the GLUE domain from ESCRT-II EAP45 binds the Ile44-containing surface of Ub through the residues within secondary structural elements including C-terminal helix (37.Alam S.L. Langelier C. Whitby F.G. Koirala S. Robinson H. Hill C.P. Sundquist W.I. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 1029-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), although it also adopts a PHD fold. The PFUC-binding surface on Ub is comprised of several hydrophobic residues centered by Ile44. There are high sequence similarity (58% identity) and structural similarity between NEDD8 and Ub (29.Whitby F.G. Xia G. Pickart C.M. Hill C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34983-34991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The residues on the binding surface of Ub, including Ile44, Val70, Arg42, and Leu8, are all conserved in NEDD8, but this hydrophobic patch does not exist in SUMO-1. So, it is not surprising that NEDD8 has the binding affinity with PFUC as in the case of Ub binding, whereas SUMO-1 has not. On the other hand, the major difference between NEDD8 and Ub is the residue in position 72 (Ala in NEDD8 and Arg in Ub), which is the main determinant of their selectivity in E1 recognition (38.Walden H. Podgorski M.S. Huang D.T. Miller D.W. Howard R.J. Minor Jr., D.L. Holton J.M. Schulman B.A. Mol.

Embo J. 2005; 24: 1341-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this regard, the hydrophobic patch centered by Ile44 may be the major source for the binding selectivity of Ub-like proteins or domains with the PFU domain of PLAA. In summary, we have provided the solution structure and binding mode of a novel Ub-binding domain from human PLAA. Although the function of PLAA remains largely unknown, it is most likely that its major cellular function, similar to that of its counterpart DOA1 in yeast, is correlated with Ub binding. The Ub recognition by the PFU domain confers PLAA to function in cellular processes, such as mediating ERAD (4.Raasi S. Wolf D.H. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 18: 780-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), controlling the concentration of free Ub in cells (41.Johnson E.S. Ma P.C. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17442-17456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), regulating monoubiquitination for DNA repair (10.Lis E.T. Romesberg F.E. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2008; 283: 21599-21611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Despite the weak binding of PFU with mono-Ub, it may bind poly-Ub cooperatively, and its Ub binding ability would be improved significantly. In this regard, the PFU domain may work as a recognition signal in all the above-mentioned processes. Whether binding of PFUC with poly-Ub or full-length PLAA with Ub provides a stronger affinity remains to be elucidated in the future.

https://openalex.org/W2037971006,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) E7 is essential in inducing S-phase progression in differentiating epithelial cells. We have previously shown that HPV-16 E7 activity can be controlled by a direct interaction with the viral transcriptional activator E2, thereby inhibiting transforming potential of E7. We have extended these analyses to show that E2 induces a generalized re-localization of E7 within the cell nucleus, one potential consequence of which is the inhibition of E7-induced degradation of pRb. Most importantly, we show that E2 can also inhibit the ability of E7 to induce centrosome abnormalities, thus preventing aberrant mitoses. Taken together, these studies highlight the central importance of E2 in controlling the functions of E7, independently of the ability of E2 to regulate transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2048620098,"Control of the onset of DNA synthesis in mammalian cells requires the coordinated assembly and activation of the pre-Replication Complex. In order to understand the regulatory events controlling preRC dynamics, we have investigated how the timing of preRC assembly relates temporally to other biochemical events governing progress into S-phase.In murine and Chinese hamster (CHO) cells released from quiescence, the loading of the replicative MCM helicase onto chromatin occurs in the final 3-4 hrs of G(1). Cdc45 and PCNA, both of which are required for G(1)-S transit, bind to chromatin at the G(1)-S transition or even earlier in G(1), when MCMs load. An RNA polymerase II inhibitor (DRB) was added to synchronized murine keratinocytes to show that they are no longer dependent on new mRNA synthesis 3-4 hrs prior to S-phase entry, which is also true for CHO and human cells. Further, CHO cells can progress into S-phase on time, and complete S-phase, under conditions where new mRNA synthesis is significantly compromised, and such mRNA suppression causes no adverse effects on preRC dynamics prior to, or during, S-phase progression. Even more intriguing, hyperphosphorylation of Rb coincides with the start of MCM loading and, paradoxically, with the time in late-G(1) when de novo mRNA synthesis is no longer rate limiting for progression into S-phase.MCM, Cdc45, and PCNA loading, and the subsequent transit through G(1)-S, do not depend on concurrent new mRNA synthesis. These results indicate that mammalian cells pass through a distinct transition in late-G(1) at which time Rb becomes hyperphosphorylated and MCM loading commences, but that after this transition the control of MCM, Cdc45, and PCNA loading and the onset of DNA replication are regulated at the post-transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W2046085692,"Mitochondria are central to the metabolism of cells and participate in many regulatory and signaling events. They are looked upon as dynamic tubular networks. We showed recently that the Carboxy-Terminal Modulator Protein (CTMP) is a mitochondrial protein that may be released into the cytosol under apoptotic conditions.Here we report an unexpected function of CTMP in mitochondrial homeostasis. In this study, both full length CTMP, and a CTMP mutant refractory to N-terminal cleavage and leading to an immature protein promote clustering of spherical mitochondria, suggesting a role for CTMP in the fission process. Indeed, cellular depletion of CTMP led to accumulation of swollen and interconnected mitochondria, without affecting the mitochondrial fusion process. Importantly, in vivo results support the relevance of these findings, as mitochondria from livers of adult CTMP knockout mice had a similar phenotype to cells depleted of CTMP.Together, these results lead us to propose that CTMP has a major function in mitochondrial dynamics and could be involved in the regulation of mitochondrial functions."
https://openalex.org/W2057310363,"Insurance companies use medical information to classify the mortality risk of applicants. Adding genetic tests to this assessment is currently being debated. This debate would be more meaningful, if results of present-day risk prediction were known. Therefore, we compared the predicted with the observed mortality of men who applied for life insurance, and determined the prognostic value of the risk assessment.Long-term follow-up was available for 62,334 male applicants whose mortality risk was predicted with medical evaluation and they were assigned to five groups with increasing risk from 1 to 5. We calculated all cause standardized mortality ratios relative to the Dutch population and compared groups with Cox's regression. We compared the discriminative ability of risk assessments as indicated by a concordance index (c).In 844,815 person years we observed 3,433 deaths. The standardized mortality relative to the Dutch male population was 0.76 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.73 to 0.78). The standardized mortality ratios ranged from 0.54 in risk group 1 to 2.37 in group 5. A large number of risk factors and diseases were significantly associated with increased mortality. The algorithm of prediction was significantly, but only slightly better than summation of the number of disorders and risk factors (c-index, 0.64 versus 0.60, P<0.001).Men applying for insurance clearly had better survival relative to the general population. Readily available medical evaluation enabled accurate prediction of the mortality risk of large groups, but the deceased men could not have been identified with the applied prediction method."
https://openalex.org/W2112230987,"In the Origin of Species Darwin hypothesized that the ""manufactory"" of species operates at different rates in different lineages and that the richness of taxonomic units is autocorrelated across levels of the taxonomic hierarchy. We confirm the manufactory hypothesis using a database of all the world's extant avian subspecies, species and genera. The hypothesis is confirmed both in correlations across all genera and in paired comparisons controlling for phylogeny. We also find that the modern risk of extinction, as measured by ""Red List"" classifications, differs across the different categories of genera identified by Darwin. Specifically, species in ""manufactory"" genera are less likely to be threatened, endangered or recently extinct than are ""weak manufactory"" genera. Therefore, although Darwin used his hypothesis to investigate past evolutionary processes, we find that the hypothesis also foreshadows future changes to the evolutionary tree."

A marked up-regulation was found for the zinc-finger protein ZAC1 under hypertonic stress (219-fold, p < 0.001). Changes in expression for ZAC1 were verified by quantitative PCR for message and Western blotting for protein. In mouse and human kidney tissues, ZAC1 expression was substantial in the papilla and was absent in the cortex. Furthermore, ZAC1 expression significantly increased in the papilla of mice following 36 h of fluid restriction and decreased in polyuric mice consuming sucrose in water. Because ZAC1 has been described to be a potential negative regulator of sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) in hippocampal cells, we examined whether this relationship also occurs in kidney cells under hypertonic stress. We found that stable IMCD3 clones silenced for ZAC1 to varying levels demonstrated an inverse effect on SDH expression. ZAC1 binds to a consensus repression site within the promoter of SDH, pointing to a mechanism whereby ZAC1 acts by repressing SDH transcriptional activity during hypertonic conditions. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that ZAC1 is up-regulated under hypertonic stress and negatively regulates expression of SDH, allowing for accumulation of sorbitol as a compatible organic osmolyte.

The cells that inhabit the hypertonic environment of the inner medulla, unlike most cells in mammals, possess a number of adaptive mechanisms that allow them to survive this harsh environment. This survival is mediated initially by the activation of acute cellular efflux of water, ion transport systems, and thereafter by the cellular accumulation of a number of compatible organic osmolytes (1Beck F.X.

Spengler D. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11975-11982Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) recently published a list of genes that are up- and down-regulated by ZAC1 expression. Among these genes, SDH expression appeared to be substantially down-regulated when ZAC1 expression was increased. Although ZAC1 has been shown to be present in kidney tissues (14Abdollahi A.

We therefore undertook the present study (a) to explore whether ZAC1 expression is regulated by tonicity, (b) to establish its renal and cellular localization, (c) to determine whether it plays a role in the hypertonicity-mediated accumulation of sorbitol, and (d) to elucidate the mechanism whereby it regulates SDH expression. Cell culture medium, fetal calf serum, and antibiotics were from Invitrogen. Antibody to mouse ZAC1 was a kind gift from Dr. Dietmar Spengler from the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, Munich, Germany, and was generated in rabbit against fusion proteins of specific ZAC epitopes. Antibodies to β-actin were obtained from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Antibody to SDH was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). All other chemicals were ultra high purity grade and purchased from Sigma. The established murine inner medullary collecting duct cell line (IMCD3) originally developed by Rauchman et al. (15Rauchman M.I. Nigam S.K. Delpire E. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1993; 265: F416-F424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. Steve Gullans (Boston, MA). Cell stocks were prepared and adapted to 600 and 900 mosmol/kg H2O in our laboratory as described previously (16Capasso J.M. Rivard C.J. Enomoto L.M. Berl T. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 986: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 17Capasso J.M. Rivard C.J. Berl T. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 280: F768-F776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments involving hypertonic stress, the media in culture dishes were exchanged for that with added NaCl to the specified osmolality depending on the experiment. Osmolality was determined with a Micro-Osmometer (model 3300; Advanced Instruments, Norwood, MA). We used the mouse gene array 430-2.0, containing 39,000 transcripts, from Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA). RNA transcription to cDNA, biotinylation to cRNA, fragmentation, hybridization to the chip, and chip analysis using a HP GeneArray Scanner were done according to the manufacturer's recommendations and performed by the University of Colorado Gene Array Core. Gene array data were analyzed using both the Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 and GeneSpring (Silicon Genetics) software analysis programs. IMCD3 cultures were transfected with the pSM2 empty vector (v2MM_173061) or the stable small interfering RNA vector pSM2-ZAC1 (v2MM_58373; Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. Stable transfectants (clones) were selected from colonies growing in plates from a 10-fold dilution series in media prepared with 10 μg/ml puromycin antibiotic (Sigma). Clones were subjected to a second round of 10-fold dilutions and replated in puromycin medium, and a second colony selection was performed to provide clean clones for further analysis. Mouse and human ZAC1 (mZAC1 and hZAC1, respectively) were generated by standard PCR amplification with primers harboring EcoRI and NotI sites from mouse and human kidney tissues, respectively: mZAC1, 5′-GAC GAA TTC ATG GCT CCA TTC CGC TGT CAA AAA TGT GGC AAG T-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAC GCG GCC GCT TAT CTA AAT GCG TGA TGG AAA TGG-3′ (antisense); hZAC1, 5′-GAC GAA TTC ATG GCT ACC CAT TCT CCC CAG AAA TCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAC GCG GCC GCT TAT CTG AAT GCA TGA TGG AAA TGA-3′ (antisense). The amplicons were purified, digested, and cloned directionally into the pIRES puro3 vector (Clontech). The recombinant vector obtained was analyzed and verified by sequencing at the University of Colorado Cancer Center DNA sequencing and analysis core at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. Cells kept at isotonic conditions or hypertonically stressed were harvested and extracted using the perchloric acid method as described previously (18Flögel U. Willker W. Engelmann J. Niendorf T. Leibfritz D. Dev. Neurosci. 1996; 18: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and 20 μl of extract was analyzed using a SDH-based enzymatic kit (Megazyme International Ireland Ltd., Wicklow, Ireland) according to the manufacturer's protocol. C57/B6 mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were subjected to food and ad libitum water, 2% sucrose/water for 2 weeks, or fluid-restricted for 36 h. Mice were harvested by cervical dislocation. Urine samples were collected from the bladder for osmolality analysis; kidneys were removed, and papilla and cortex tissues were dissected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were homogenized using a glass tissue grinder on ice with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) lysis buffer and analyzed as described previously (17Capasso J.M. Rivard C.J. Berl T. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 280: F768-F776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human kidney tissues from cortex, medulla, and papilla were obtained under Institutional Review Board COMIRB#05 and National Institutes of Health Program Project Grant U19 A10636030 from a kidney that was not suitable for transplantation. Tissues were processed as described above. Cytosolic RNA was isolated from confluent cultures in 100 × 20-mm tissue culture using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Prior to qPCR, RNA was converted to cDNA using the iScript reverse transcriptase kit (Bio-Rad) as described by the manufacturer. qPCR primers specific to ZAC1, AR, SDH, and β-actin were designed using Beacon Designer 5.0 software (Premier Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA). qPCR was performed using ZAC1 forward primer 5′-GTCTGGGTTGGAGTCTGTG-3′ and ZAC1 reverse primer 5′-GCAAATACGAAGCCGATGG-3′ (70 nm each) and the SYBR Green JumpStart Taq Readymix qPCR kit (Sigma) on a Bio-Rad I-Cycler. qPCR runs were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and melt curve to verify that the correct amplicon was produced. β-Actin RNA was used as internal control, and the amount of RNA was calculated by the comparative CT method as recommended by the manufacturer. IMCD3 cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline to 5 × 105 cells/ml. DNA/protein interaction was cross-linked at room temperature for 10 min with paraformaldehyde to a final concentration of 1%. The cross-linking reaction was quenched by the addition of glycine, and cells were pelleted and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 5 mm PIPES, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl supplemented with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and mixture protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). The nuclear extract was pelleted by microcentrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 5 min, and genomic DNA was sheared into fragments of ∼500 bp by ultrasonic treatment (Branson 1200, Ventura, CA). Sheared products were analyzed in a 1.5% agarose gel. Genomic DNA was then precleared by the addition of protein A/G-agarose slurry and further centrifugation. ZAC1-DNA complexes were pulled down by overnight incubation at 4 °C with an anti-ZAC1 antibody and further addition of protein A/G-agarose slurry. Agarose beads were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS, followed by four washes in buffer containing 100 mm Tris pH 8.0, 500 mm LiCl supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40 and 1% deoxycholate. Agarose beads were collected by centrifugation, and cross-linking was reversed by overnight incubation at 67 °C. DNA was then isolated from proteins with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, and PCR analysis for the mouse SDH promoter sequence was performed for 30 cycles employing the following primers: forward, 5′-CCTGAGGACTTCTTTTAAGT3-′; and reverse, 5′-ATGTATGTGTGTGCACGACT-3′ (see supplemental Fig. 1). PCR products were separated using a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Cell protein lysates and Western blotting were performed from confluent cell cultures as described previously (16Capasso J.M. Rivard C.J. Enomoto L.M. Berl T. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 986: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). IMCD3 cells were grown to confluence in 8-well glass slides (177402; NUNC, Rochester, NY) and fixed with methanol at −20 °C for 2 min. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated overnight with ZAC1 antibody. Cells were rinsed and incubated with a goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Preparations were imaged with a 40× water immersion objective using a laser scanning confocal microscope (model LSM510; Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Data were analyzed using the LSM image analyzer postacquisition software (Zeiss). All data are presented as the means ± S.E. Data graphics and statistical analysis were performed using Instat (version 3.0) and Prism 4 (both from GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Data were analyzed for normality tests and using the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test. Multiple group corrections were performed using the method of Bartlett. In most cases experiments were performed three times with independent replicates. Total independent replicates for each data point (n) are identified in the figure legends. p values <0.05 were recognized as statistically significant. Correlation between mRNA for SDH and ZAC1 expression was evaluated employing linear regression analysis (Prism 4 software). The mouse Affymetrix GeneChip array representing >39,000 transcripts was employed as a discovery tool to study changes in expression in IMCD3 cells chronically adapted to increasing levels of tonicity. IMCD3 cells originally developed by Rauchman et al. (15Rauchman M.I. Nigam S.K. Delpire E. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1993; 265: F416-F424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were chronically adapted to 600 and 900 mosmol/kg H2O (16Capasso J.M. Rivard C.J. Enomoto L.M. Berl T. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 986: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 17Capasso J.M. Rivard C.J. Berl T. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 280: F768-F776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were compared directly with cells grown at isotonic conditions. GeneChip data shown in Fig. 1A, left bars, reveal that ZAC1 mRNA is essentially absent in cells maintained at isotonic conditions but substantially up-regulated in cells chronically adapted to 600 mosmol/kg H2O (109-fold, p < 0.001) and 900 mosmol/kg H2O (219-fold, p < 0.001). Data shown in Fig. 1A, right bars, confirm by qPCR that ZAC1 mRNA is up-regulated under hypertonic stress in a pattern that mimics the GeneChip data. Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B) also demonstrates a similar pattern for ZAC1 protein expression with a 56-fold increase (p < 0.001) in expression at 600 mosmol/kg H2O and a 239-fold increase (p < 0.001) at 900 mosmol/kg H2O. To assess whether the changes seen in cultured cells are also observed in renal tissues, protein expression was also examined in kidney tissues when mice were subjected to ad libitum water and fluid restriction for 36 h (urine osmolality increased from 1,424 ± 211 to 3,105 ± 524 mosmol/kg H2O, n = 6). Western blot data shown in Fig. 2A indicate a relative absence of ZAC1 protein expression in the cortex and substantial presence of the protein in the papilla (7.4-fold, p < 0.001). Furthermore, ZAC1 protein expression increased 2.2-fold (p < 0.01) in papilla tissues upon fluid restriction for 36 h, with no significant change in the cortex. When mice were subjected to 2% sucrose/water loading for 2 weeks (urine osmolality decreased from 1,312 ± 121 to 231 ± 53 mosmol/kg H2O, n = 3) to reduce the tonicity in the medulla, ZAC1 protein expression was substantially down-regulated (4.1-fold (p < 0.001) compared with ad libitum water in papilla) to those levels found in the cortex. Analysis of ZAC1 protein expression in normal human kidney is shown in Fig. 2B for comparison and demonstrates the greatest expression in the hypertonic papilla and medulla with little comparable expression in the isotonic cortex tissues. ZAC1 protein expression in IMCD3 cells subjected to acute sublethal osmotic stress was evaluated to determine the timing of the onset of expression. To this end we undertook Western blot analysis for protein at numerous time points following exposure to sublethal hypertonicity. Data shown in Fig. 3 demonstrate a significant increase in ZAC1 protein after 8 h of hypertonic stress (550 mosmol/kg H2O) with a maximum level of protein determined after 20–24 h. Analysis of half-life for ZAC1 message and protein in IMCD3 cells (treated with 0.5 μg/ml actinomycin D or cycloheximide for 72 h to avoid new synthesis of message and protein, respectively) is shown in Fig. 4. Data were curve fit for exponential decay, and the half-life was calculated to be 6.5 and 112 h for ZAC1 message and protein, respectively.FIGURE 4Estimation of half-lives for ZAC1 mRNA and protein in IMCD3 cells. Cells chronically adapted to 900 mosmol/kg H2O were treated with 0.5 μg/ml actinomycin D or cycloheximide for 72 h to avoid new message and protein production in conjunction with a medium change to isotonic conditions. Replicate plates were harvested at different time points with analysis of message and protein by qPCR and Western blotting, respectively. Data were subjected to decay analysis (solid line) for message and protein. The half-life was calculated from the one-phase exponential decay equation. Results are from three independent experiments performed in duplicate (50 μg of total protein per lane, n = 3). A representative Western blot including β-actin loading control is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because sorbitol is an important compatible osmolyte that accumulates during hypertonic stress and ZAC1 has been suggested as a negative regulator of the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of sorbitol (SDH) (13Barz T. Hoffmann A. Panhuysen M. Spengler D. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11975-11982Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of hypertonicity on SDH message and protein expression. Fig. 5A reveals that SDH message as assessed by qPCR progressively decreases in cells chronically exposed to 600 and 900 mosmol/kg H2O whereas the message of AR, which is responsible for the generation of sorbitol, is markedly up-regulated. Fig. 5B demonstrates that this change in message is accompanied by a decrement in SDH protein expression in cells exposed to increasing levels of tonicity for 24 h as ZAC1 and AR expression concomitantly increases. To assess the physiologic significance of the osmotic up-regulation of ZAC1, we undertook to silence protein expression and its impact on SDH expression. A plasmid-based system generating fold-back stem-loop structures that are processed into the specific small interfering RNA was used (pSM2-ZAC1). BLAST and alignment analyses were initially performed to ascertain the selectivity of the silencing sequence with other genes that may induce off-target responses. Analysis reveals <70% homology of the silencing sequence with other cDNAs reflecting the specificity of the target employed. The vector was lipid-transfected into IMCD3 cells, and stable clones were selected by growth in puromycin-containing medium. Expression of ZAC1 protein by Western blotting in silenced clones and the empty vector control cells was assessed following incubation under acute osmotic stress for 24 h. Because some clonal variation may occur by silencing ZAC1, we studied nine separate clones depicted in Fig. 6A. In general, inspection of the representative message by qPCR for these two proteins reveals an inverse relationship between ZAC1 and SDH expression. Specifically, clones fully silenced for ZAC1 such as A, D, H, and I show substantial SDH mRNA expression under hypertonic conditions. Clones partially silenced for ZAC1 expression (B, F, and G) demonstrate partial SDH expression. In contrast, clones not silenced for ZAC1 (C and E) and an empty vector control (CTR) show little or no signal of SDH mRNA expression. Fig. 6A, bottom, shows quantitatively the inverse correlation between ZAC1 and SDH in mRNA (R2 value of 0.9156) obtained from triplicate measurements. We then focused on the partially silenced clone (G) and the fully silenced clone (H) to study protein expression and the possible effect of silencing ZAC1 on AR. Fig. 6B shows little or no ZAC1 and AR protein expression at isotonic conditions (300 mosmol/kg H2O) with marked SDH expression. However, under acute hypertonic conditions, ZAC1 and AR are both up-regulated with a concomitant decrease in SDH levels in empty vector control cells. A comparison of ZAC1-silenced clones reveals that clone G demonstrates a partial reduction in ZAC1 protein levels (42.2%, p < 0.01) under acute hypertonic stress (550 mosmol/kg H2O), whereas clone H is fully silenced. Western blot data reveal that silencing ZAC1 expression does not substantially affect the up-regulation of AR under hypertonic conditions (Fig. 6B, middle). In contrast, ZAC1 silencing allows SDH expression to be maintained to corresponding degrees (30.8-fold (p < 0.001) increase for partially silenced clone G and 50.2-fold (p < 0.001) increase for totally silenced clone H) (Fig. 6B, bottom). Because the blunted SDH response could be caused by a clonal selection rather than direct effects of ZAC1 knockdown, we performed ZAC1 overexpression and add-back experiments to evaluate whether we could restore SDH expression to those levels physiologically found at isotonic and hypertonic conditions. We first started by expressing ZAC1 in wild-type IMCD3 cells maintained at isotonic conditions. To this end, we cloned mZAC1 coding sequence into the overexpressing vector pIRES, and we transiently transfected IMCD3 cells with this construct. As shown in Fig. 7A, we obtained substantial ZAC1 expression at isotonic conditions in cells transfected with this construct. In contrast, no mZAC1 expression was found in either wild-type IMCD3 cells or in cells transfected with an empty pIRES vector. Levels of SDH expression were substantially down-regulated in pIRES-mZAC1-transfected cells with no difference in the empty vector control cells. Because employing a mZAC1 overexpressor construct would have no effect in cells stably expressing a mZAC1 silencer, we also cloned hZAC1 in pIRES as a mouse RNA interference-resistant ZAC1 to add back to IMCD3 silenced cells under hypertonic conditions. We transfected the IMCD3 totally silenced clone H with hZAC1, and we exposed the cells to acute hypertonicity for 48 h. As shown in Fig. 7B, upper, expression of hZAC1 in the silenced clone H was validated by qPCR using specific primers against hZAC1 that would not amplify mZAC1. As demonstrated in Fig. 7B, lower, expression of the resistant hZAC1 substantially down-regulated SDH expression under hypertonic conditions. Because previous studies reported that ZAC1 may act as a transactivator or as a repressor of the transcription of different genes (19Hoffmann A. Ciani E. Boeckardt J. Holsboer F. Journot L. Spengler D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 988-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we investigated whether this mechanism is operating in our studies. To regulate gene expression, ZAC1 has to be translocated to the nucleus. As shown in Fig. 8A, confocal immunofluorescence analysis demonstrates that ZAC1 (red) is located inside the nucleus of IMCD3 cells chronically exposed to hypertonicity (900 mosmol/kg H2O) where it colocalizes with the nuclear marker 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (blue). To determine whether ZAC1 has an effect on SDH mRNA transcription, different ZAC1-silenced clones were analyzed under hypertonic conditions by qPCR as shown in Fig. 6A, and the results strongly suggest that a transcriptional mechanism is involved. The transactivation or gene repression effect of ZAC1 depends on the ZAC1-DNA binding sequence located within the promoter region of the gene. Analysis of the proximal promoter region of mouse SDH (first 2.5 kb upstream from the transcription start) reveals complete absence of any of the well characterized DNA consensus sites for ZAC1 transactivation properties (supplemental Fig. 1A) (19Hoffmann A. Ciani E. Boeckardt J. Holsboer F. Journot L. Spengler D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 988-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found a repressor consensus site at 1.4 kb upstream from the first exon. This consensus site, represented as a “half-part” binding site for monomeric ZAC1 (G4TTAGGCTG4), resembles the idealistic ZAC1 repression site G4N6G4 (19Hoffmann A. Ciani E. Boeckardt J. Holsboer F. Journot L. Spengler D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 988-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To determine whether ZAC1 binds to this region within the SDH promoter under hypertonic stress, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis against ZAC1 in IMCD3 cells chronically exposed to 600 mosmol/kg H2O. As shown in Fig. 8B, left, a single band at ∼130 kDa was detected after immunoprecipitation and detection with ZAC1 antibodies. In contrast, no signal was found when the antibody was replaced by IgG. PCR analysis of the precipitated DNA using specific primers revealed that ZAC1 binds to the repressor region within the SDH promoter (Fig. 8B, right). To determine whether the maintenance of SDH expression in ZAC1-silenced clones affects the overall accumulation of sorbitol in these cells, we measured intracellular sorbitol concentration after perchloric acid extraction as described previously (4Klawitter J. Rivard C.J. Brown L.M. Capasso J.M. Almeida N.E. Maunsbach A.B. Pihakaski-Maunsbach K. Berl T. Leibfritz D. Christians U. Chan L. Nephron Physiol. 2008; 109: p1-p10Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 9A and as a control, a significant increase in sorbitol accumulation is observed in IMCD3 cells in response to higher levels of tonicity (45.2-fold (p < 0.001) for 600 mosmol/kg H2O-adapted cells and 151.8-fold (p < 0.001) for 900 mosmol/kg H2O). In contrast, as shown in Fig. 9B, there is a substantial reduction in cellular sorbitol accumulation under acute hypertonic stress in clones silenced for ZAC1 expression (91.2% (p < 0.001) reduction for totally silenced clone H and 80.2% (p < 0.001) reduction for the partially silenced clone G compared with the empty vector control cells) with no significant change in sorbitol levels between both clones and the empty vector control cells at isotonic conditions. Changes in the cellular genome and proteome are required for cells of the renal inner medulla to survive and adapt to extreme changes in hypertonicity. Although a large body of information already exists regarding the osmotic stress response involving organic osmolyte accumulation, ion transport, and DNA repair (3Burg M.B. Kwon E.D. Kültz D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 437-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 20Berl T. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 2000; 35: xlvii-lAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 21Dmitrieva N.I.

Nephron. 2001; 87: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the survival of these cells under hypertonic stress requires substantial regulation by proteins that as yet have not been identified. The major osmolyte accumulated in the osmotic stress response in IMCD3 cells is sorbitol (4Klawitter J. Rivard C.J. Brown L.M. Capasso J.M. Almeida N.E. Maunsbach A.B. Pihakaski-Maunsbach K. Berl T. Leibfritz D. Christians U. Chan L. Nephron Physiol. 2008; 109: p1-p10Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), which is an intermediate product in the polyol pathway produced by the reduction of glucose by AR (6Petrash J.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, SDH, the second enzyme in the polyol pathway, metabolizes sorbitol into fructose, maintaining low intracellular levels of sorbitol under physiologic isotonic conditions. Under hypertonic conditions, we found previously that SDH mRNA expression is down-regulated in IMCD3 cells (4Klawitter J. Rivard C.J. Brown L.M. Capasso J.M. Almeida N.E. Maunsbach A.B. Pihakaski-Maunsbach K. Berl T. Leibfritz D. Christians U. Chan L. Nephron Physiol. 2008; 109: p1-p10Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In contrast, other groups have found little or no difference in SDH mRNA levels under acute hypertonic stress (24Burger-Kentischer A. Müller E. März J. Fraek M.L. Thurau K. Beck F.X. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 1417-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25Grunewald R.W. Wagner M. Schubert I. Franz H.E. Müller G.A. Steffgen J. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 1998; 8: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In these studies, the acute nature of the hypertonic stress may have minimized the changes determined for SDH mRNA. In the present study, we confirmed our previous observation regarding the down-regulation of message for SDH and complemented with parallel decrement in protein expression. Although it is well known that hypertonic stress activates AR expression through tonicity enhancer-binding protein (7Miyakawa H. Woo S.K. Dahl S.C. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 2538-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 8Woo S.K. Dahl S.C. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol.

Cytol. 2002; 215: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the mechanisms leading to a potential down-regulation of SDH remain unexplored. In the present work, by using Affymetrix GeneChip, we found that the zinc-finger protein ZAC1 is one of the most robustly up-regulated genes in IMCD3 cells under hypertonic stress (219-fold (p < 0.001) between 900 and 300 mosmol/kg H2O). ZAC1 is a zinc-finger protein also known as LOT1 and PLAGL1 and is characterized by its potential role in tumor suppression (11Piras G. El Kharroubi A. Kozlov S. Escalante-Alcalde D. Hernandez L.

It has been reported that ZAC1 directly or through p53 (31Hoffmann A. Ciani E. Houssami S. Brabet P. Journot L. Spengler D. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 865: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 32Huang S.M. Schönthal A.H. Stallcup M.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2134-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) decreases cell proliferation by regulation of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (12Spengler D. Villalba M. Hoffmann A. Pantaloni C. Houssami S. Bockaert J. Journot L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2814-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 33Pagotto U. Arzberger T. Ciani E. Lezoualc'h F. Pilon C. Journot L. Spengler D. Stalla G.K. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The up-regulation of ZAC1 in IMCD3 cells in response to hypertonicity as determined by GeneChip analysis was validated both by qPCR for message and Western blotting for protein. Under isotonic conditions, IMCD3 cells were found to express very low levels of ZAC1, which increased during acute or chronic exposure to hypertonicity. The expression of ZAC1 protein in response to hypertonicity was also demonstrated in kidney tissues of mice and human with substantial ZAC1 protein levels in the hypertonic papilla tissues and nearly absent in the isotonic cortex. Fluid-restricted mice were found to increase further expression of ZAC1 in papilla tissues, whereas ZAC1 expression was down-regulated in papilla tissues from water-loaded mice (sucrose/water). Because ZAC1 has been suggested to function as a negative regulator of SDH in hippocampal cells (13Barz T. Hoffmann A. Panhuysen M. Spengler D. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11975-11982Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we assessed the role of ZAC1 up-regulation in our observed decrement in SDH expression in IMCD3 cells. Silencing ZAC1 expression by using a stable small hairpin RNA vector resulted in a variable loss of expression in IMCD3 clones under isotonic and hypertonic exposure, which inversely correlated (R2 = 0.9156) with SDH expression. However, changes in ZAC1 expression had no effect on AR expression. To determine whether the effect observed on SDH expression was caused by clonal variation rather than by knockdown of ZAC1, we performed ZAC1 overexpression in isotonic cells and in a clone fully silenced for ZAC1 to restore SDH expression. In both of these settings, the inverse relationship between ZAC1 and SDH was fully maintained, further supporting a direct role for ZAC1 in regulating SDH. We further investigated the mechanism whereby ZAC1 down-regulates SDH. The above noted effect on SDH message suggested transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, we unveiled within the SDH promoter a consensus site for ZAC1-dependent gene transcriptional repression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that ZAC1 binds to this consensus site. Finally, we measure the final product of the pathway, the intracellular levels of the osmolyte sorbitol. Silencing ZAC1 expression also led to a parallel decrease in cellular sorbitol accumulation, reflecting the important role of ZAC1 in the maintenance of sorbitol in the inner medulla by decreasing levels of SDH. Comparison of these data with previous studies on SDH in the laboratories of Beck (24Burger-Kentischer A. Müller E. März J. Fraek M.L. Thurau K. Beck F.X. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 1417-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and Grunewald (25Grunewald R.W. Wagner M. Schubert I. Franz H.E. Müller G.A. Steffgen J. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 1998; 8: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) may be reconciled relative to their determination of a doubling in SDH activity in the settings of hypertonic stress by considering that increasing AR expression and sorbitol substrate levels thereby enhance SDH enzyme activity, even in the face of diminished protein expression. Furthermore, we found previously that under chronic exposure to increased levels of tonicity, IMCD3 cells do not accumulate detectable levels of fructose (4Klawitter J. Rivard C.J. Brown L.M. Capasso J.M. Almeida N.E. Maunsbach A.B. Pihakaski-Maunsbach K. Berl T. Leibfritz D. Christians U. Chan L. Nephron Physiol. 2008; 109: p1-p10Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), which could further enhance SDH enzymatic activity. Our studies suggest that the effects on SDH activity notwithstanding, the down-regulation of SDH expression is a vital component in the maintenance of cellular sorbitol levels. It is of interest to postulate one potential application that emanates from these observations in which accumulation of sorbitol is implicated in complications of diabetes mellitus including diabetic nephropathy, neuropathy, and cataracts (34Kador P.F.

Diabetes Complications. 1998; 12: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). ZAC1 could therefore become a potential target in the treatment of these complications related to diabetes, either alone or in combination with well established AR inhibitors. To this end, additional studies are currently under way to elucidate the signaling pathways responsible for ZAC1 expression. In conclusion, this study is the first to identify ZAC1 as an osmotic response protein. We describe its nuclear localization in cultured IMCD3 cells as well as in the papilla (but not in the cortex) of mouse and human kidneys. We also demonstrated that this zinc-finger protein plays a central role in maintaining high levels of sorbitol during hypertonic conditions by a mechanism involving the transcriptional repression of SDH.

https://openalex.org/W2039644903,"Growth and division of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is dependent on the action of SNARE proteins that are required for membrane fusion. SNAREs are regulated, through a poorly understood mechanism, to ensure membrane fusion at the correct time and place within a cell. Although fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane is important for yeast cell growth, the relationship between exocytic SNAREs and cell physiology has not been established.Using genetic analysis, we identified several influences on the function of exocytic SNAREs. Genetic disruption of the V-ATPase, but not vacuolar proteolysis, can suppress two different temperature-sensitive mutations in SEC9. Suppression is unlikely due to increased SNARE complex formation because increasing SNARE complex formation, through overexpression of SRO7, does not result in suppression. We also observed suppression of sec9 mutations by growth on alkaline media or on a non-fermentable carbon source, conditions associated with a reduced growth rate of wild-type cells and decreased SNARE complex formation.Three main conclusions arise from our results. First, there is a genetic interaction between SEC9 and the V-ATPase, although it is unlikely that this interaction has functional significance with respect to membrane fusion or SNAREs. Second, Sro7p acts to promote SNARE complex formation. Finally, Sec9p function and SNARE complex formation are tightly coupled to the physiological state of the cell."
