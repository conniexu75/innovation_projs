https://openalex.org/W2028805003,"Silicon oxynitride, a new mineral, has been discovered in the Jajh deh Kot Lalu enstatite chondrite. Nitrogen and oxygen have been measured quantitatively with an electron microprobe by means of prototypes of newly developed curved crystal detection systems. X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained from silicon oxynitride separated from the meteorite and from synthetic Si2N2O."

https://openalex.org/W2086627304,"The first high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer operated at 30 Mcy/sec (7.05 kilogauss). The magnets constituted the only major obstacle to raising the frequency, but by continuous development over 10 years this frequency for proton resonance was increased to 100 Mcy/sec (23.4 kilogauss). Now, in one step, a system has been made to operate at twice this frequency and field intensity. It is not expected that superconducting magnets will generally replace iron magnets, but it is interesting to note that very few laboratories use the 30- and 40-Mcy/sec proton systems today. Notwithstanding the cost and operating problems of the superconducting magnet system for the nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer, the fact that this is the only practical means of developing both a stable and a high-intensity field puts it in a class by itself. For this reason, even though the maintenance of spectrometers with superconducting magnets requires rather specialized skills, this type of instrumentation will clearly have an important role in advancing scientific knowledge, by making possible analyses which have not been possible with presently available instruments."

The amino acid sequence in the hexapeptide ring is confirmed to be -Orn-Orn-Orn-Ser-Ser-Gly-, and the conformation of this ring is trans at each peptide linkage. The absolute configuration of the three hydroxamate rings at the iron atom is that of a left-handed propeller. Disorder is found concerning the positions of some of the side chains and one of the four water molecules."

https://openalex.org/W1984262321,"New techniques of x-ray fluorescence spectrography have provided, for the first time, abundant data regarding chemical variability of granitic rocks on different scales. The results suggest that current designs of sampling plans for trend surface analysis should be modified; in particular several specimens, preferably drillcores, may be required at each locality."

For the genera Chlamys, Ostrea, and Glycymeris the temperature rises from early to mid-Tertiary, then falls again to the present."

https://openalex.org/W1980525010,"Sodium perxenate in alkaline solutions is reduced in a single step to xenon at the dropping-mercury electrode. The half-wave potential for perxenate changes from -0.21 to -0.31 volts against a Hg(2)SO(4)-Hg reference electrode in the pH range 10.1 to 11.3. Xenon (II) difluoride in acidic solution is reduced in a single step to xenon, at the potential of approximately zero against the Hg2SO4-Hg reference electrode. The reduction wave is followed by a broad maximum which can be effectively suppressed by fluoride ion. The diffusion current varies in linear fashion with concentration."

https://openalex.org/W2064758708,The perfection of relatively large single crystals can be tested by Laue transmission x-ray diffraction photographs by using much higher voltages for the x-ray generation than are used in conventional diffraction experiments. The technique can be used for determining the orientation spread of subcrystal units and for studying the loss of primary extinction due to occluded chemical impurities. An advantage of this method is its possible application to crystals inside polycrystalline or glass containers.
