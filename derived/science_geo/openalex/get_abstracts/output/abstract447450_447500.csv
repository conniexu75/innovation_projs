https://openalex.org/W1989547126,"The current experimental and theoretical status of spin–orbit coupling in ultracold atomic systems is discussed, highlighting unique features that enable otherwise impossible physics. Quantum gases — such as atomic Bose–Einstein condensates and degenerate Fermi gases — are suitable for realizing a range of physical phenomena. Their properties can be engineered on demand through the manipulation of synthetic spin–orbit couplings using laser fields. In this review, Victor Galitski and Ian Spielman outline the current experimental and theoretical status of spin–orbit coupling in ultracold atomic systems, discussing the unique features that enable physics impossible in any other known setting. Spin–orbit coupling links a particle’s velocity to its quantum-mechanical spin, and is essential in numerous condensed matter phenomena, including topological insulators and Majorana fermions. In solid-state materials, spin–orbit coupling originates from the movement of electrons in a crystal’s intrinsic electric field, which is uniquely prescribed in any given material. In contrast, for ultracold atomic systems, the engineered ‘material parameters’ are tunable: a variety of synthetic spin–orbit couplings can be engineered on demand using laser fields. Here we outline the current experimental and theoretical status of spin–orbit coupling in ultracold atomic systems, discussing unique features that enable physics impossible in any other known setting."
https://openalex.org/W1984236815,"The DNA cytosine deaminase APOBEC3B is shown to be overexpressed and highly active in most breast cancers; deamination by APOBEC3B could serve as an endogenous, continual source of DNA damage leading to mutations, including C-to-T transitions and other aberrations seen in many breast tumours. The profile of C-to-T transition mutations in breast cancer suggests a non-spontaneous origin. This paper shows that some of these mutations may arise from the upregulation of a cytosine deaminase, APOBEC3B (A3B), in such cancer cells. Deamination catalysed by A3B could serve as an endogenous, continual source of DNA damage that leads to mutations and DNA fragmentation, whereas inactivation of TP53, which is frequently observed in cells overexpressing A3B, would prevent the elimination of such damaged cells by apoptosis. A3B may be a useful marker for breast cancer and also a candidate for targeted intervention, especially given its non-essential nature. Several mutations are required for cancer development, and genome sequencing has revealed that many cancers, including breast cancer, have somatic mutation spectra dominated by C-to-T transitions1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Most of these mutations occur at hydrolytically disfavoured10 non-methylated cytosines throughout the genome, and are sometimes clustered8. Here we show that the DNA cytosine deaminase APOBEC3B is a probable source of these mutations. APOBEC3B messenger RNA is upregulated in most primary breast tumours and breast cancer cell lines. Tumours that express high levels of APOBEC3B have twice as many mutations as those that express low levels and are more likely to have mutations in TP53. Endogenous APOBEC3B protein is predominantly nuclear and the only detectable source of DNA C-to-U editing activity in breast cancer cell-line extracts. Knockdown experiments show that endogenous APOBEC3B correlates with increased levels of genomic uracil, increased mutation frequencies, and C-to-T transitions. Furthermore, induced APOBEC3B overexpression causes cell cycle deviations, cell death, DNA fragmentation, γ-H2AX accumulation and C-to-T mutations. Our data suggest a model in which APOBEC3B-catalysed deamination provides a chronic source of DNA damage in breast cancers that could select TP53 inactivation and explain how some tumours evolve rapidly and manifest heterogeneity."
https://openalex.org/W2050648603,"A linear relationship between the sensitivity of tropical land carbon storage to warming and the sensitivity of the annual growth rate of atmospheric CO2 to tropical temperature anomalies provides a tight constraint on the sensitivity of tropical land carbon to climate change. In response to climate change, tropical forests may release vast amounts of carbon, accelerating the pace of further climate change. Or they may not: research to date has been conflicting and controversial. Peter Cox and colleagues now use the response of the tropical land carbon cycle to interannual climate variability to constrain the likely future response. They find that the tropics will emit 53 ± 17 gigatonnes of carbon per degree of warming, a much more muted response that suggested in previous work. The release of carbon from tropical forests may exacerbate future climate change1, but the magnitude of the effect in climate models remains uncertain2. Coupled climate–carbon-cycle models generally agree that carbon storage on land will increase as a result of the simultaneous enhancement of plant photosynthesis and water use efficiency under higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but will decrease owing to higher soil and plant respiration rates associated with warming temperatures3. At present, the balance between these effects varies markedly among coupled climate–carbon-cycle models, leading to a range of 330 gigatonnes in the projected change in the amount of carbon stored on tropical land by 2100. Explanations for this large uncertainty include differences in the predicted change in rainfall in Amazonia4,5 and variations in the responses of alternative vegetation models to warming6. Here we identify an emergent linear relationship, across an ensemble of models7, between the sensitivity of tropical land carbon storage to warming and the sensitivity of the annual growth rate of atmospheric CO2 to tropical temperature anomalies8. Combined with contemporary observations of atmospheric CO2 concentration and tropical temperature, this relationship provides a tight constraint on the sensitivity of tropical land carbon to climate change. We estimate that over tropical land from latitude 30° north to 30° south, warming alone will release 53 ± 17 gigatonnes of carbon per kelvin. Compared with the unconstrained ensemble of climate–carbon-cycle projections, this indicates a much lower risk of Amazon forest dieback under CO2-induced climate change if CO2 fertilization effects are as large as suggested by current models9. Our study, however, also implies greater certainty that carbon will be lost from tropical land if warming arises from reductions in aerosols10 or increases in other greenhouse gases11."
https://openalex.org/W2055807959,"Blood production is ensured by rare, self-renewing haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). How HSCs accommodate the diverse cellular stresses associated with their life-long activity remains elusive. Here we identify autophagy as an essential mechanism protecting HSCs from metabolic stress. We show that mouse HSCs, in contrast to their short-lived myeloid progeny, robustly induce autophagy after ex vivo cytokine withdrawal and in vivo calorie restriction. We demonstrate that FOXO3A is critical to maintain a gene expression program that poises HSCs for rapid induction of autophagy upon starvation. Notably, we find that old HSCs retain an intact FOXO3A-driven pro-autophagy gene program, and that ongoing autophagy is needed to mitigate an energy crisis and allow their survival. Our results demonstrate that autophagy is essential for the life-long maintenance of the HSC compartment and for supporting an old, failing blood system."

https://openalex.org/W2012391873,"Plant roots constantly secrete compounds into the soil to interact with neighboring organisms presumably to gain certain functional advantages at different stages of development. Accordingly, it has been hypothesized that the phytochemical composition present in the root exudates changes over the course of the lifespan of a plant. Here, root exudates of in vitro grown Arabidopsis plants were collected at different developmental stages and analyzed using GC-MS. Principle component analysis revealed that the composition of root exudates varied at each developmental stage. Cumulative secretion levels of sugars and sugar alcohols were higher in early time points and decreased through development. In contrast, the cumulative secretion levels of amino acids and phenolics increased over time. The expression in roots of genes involved in biosynthesis and transportation of compounds represented in the root exudates were consistent with patterns of root exudation. Correlation analyses were performed of the in vitro root exudation patterns with the functional capacity of the rhizosphere microbiome to metabolize these compounds at different developmental stages of Arabidopsis grown in natural soils. Pyrosequencing of rhizosphere mRNA revealed strong correlations (p<0.05) between microbial functional genes involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids and secondary metabolites with the corresponding compounds released by the roots at particular stages of plant development. In summary, our results suggest that the root exudation process of phytochemicals follows a developmental pattern that is genetically programmed."

https://openalex.org/W2002255627,"Mammalian telomeres repress DNA-damage activation at natural chromosome ends by recruiting specific inhibitors of the DNA-damage machinery that form a protective complex termed shelterin. Within this complex, TRF2 (also known as TERF2) has a crucial role in end protection through the suppression of ATM activation and the formation of end-to-end chromosome fusions. Here we address the molecular properties of TRF2 that are both necessary and sufficient to protect chromosome ends in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Our data support a two-step mechanism for TRF2-mediated end protection. First, the dimerization domain of TRF2 is required to inhibit ATM activation, the key initial step involved in the activation of a DNA-damage response (DDR). Next, TRF2 independently suppresses the propagation of DNA-damage signalling downstream of ATM activation. This novel modulation of the DDR at telomeres occurs at the level of the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF168 (ref. 3). Inhibition of RNF168 at telomeres involves the deubiquitinating enzyme BRCC3 and the ubiquitin ligase UBR5, and is sufficient to suppress chromosome end-to-end fusions. This two-step mechanism for TRF2-mediated end protection helps to explain the apparent paradox of frequent localization of DDR proteins at functional telomeres without concurrent induction of detrimental DNA-repair activities."
https://openalex.org/W1995184016,"A mass-loss event 40 days before the explosion of the type IIn supernova SN 2010mc has been detected; the outburst indicates that there is a causal relation between explosive mass-loss events seen in some massive stars before their explosion and the onset of the supernova explosion. Various lines of evidence suggest that very massive stars experience extreme mass-loss episodes shortly before they explode as supernovae. This paper reports the observation of one such event: 40 days before the explosion of the type IIn supernova SN 2010mc its progenitor underwent an energetic outburst that released 0.01 solar masses of material at velocities of around 2,000 km per second.The luminosity and velocity of the outburst are consistent with the predictions of the wave-driven pulsation model of supernova explosions. Some observations suggest that very massive stars experience extreme mass-loss episodes shortly before they explode as supernovae1,2,3,4, as do several models5,6,7. Establishing a causal connection between these mass-loss episodes and the final explosion would provide a novel way to study pre-supernova massive-star evolution. Here we report observations of a mass-loss event detected 40 days before the explosion of the type IIn supernova SN 2010mc (also known as PTF 10tel). Our photometric and spectroscopic data suggest that this event is a result of an energetic outburst, radiating at least 6 × 1047 erg of energy and releasing about 10−2 solar masses of material at typical velocities of 2,000 km s−1. The temporal proximity of the mass-loss outburst and the supernova explosion implies a causal connection between them. Moreover, we find that the outburst luminosity and velocity are consistent with the predictions of the wave-driven pulsation model6, and disfavour alternative suggestions7."

https://openalex.org/W2039502415,"Talin activates integrins, couples them to F-actin, and recruits vinculin to focal adhesions (FAs). Here, we report the structural characterization of the talin rod: 13 helical bundles (R1-R13) organized into a compact cluster of four-helix bundles (R2-R4) within a linear chain of five-helix bundles. Nine of the bundles contain vinculin-binding sites (VBS); R2R3 are atypical, with each containing two VBS. Talin R2R3 also binds synergistically to RIAM, a Rap1 effector involved in integrin activation. Biochemical and structural data show that vinculin and RIAM binding to R2R3 is mutually exclusive. Moreover, vinculin binding requires domain unfolding, whereas RIAM binds the folded R2R3 double domain. In cells, RIAM is enriched in nascent adhesions at the leading edge whereas vinculin is enriched in FAs. We propose a model in which RIAM binding to R2R3 initially recruits talin to membranes where it activates integrins. As talin engages F-actin, force exerted on R2R3 disrupts RIAM binding and exposes the VBS, which recruit vinculin to stabilize the complex."

https://openalex.org/W2038181219,"Adult stem cells reside in specialized niches where they receive environmental cues to maintain tissue homeostasis. In mammals, the stem cell niche within hair follicles is home to epithelial hair follicle stem cells and melanocyte stem cells, which sustain cyclical bouts of hair regeneration and pigmentation. To generate pigmented hairs, synchrony is achieved such that upon initiation of a new hair cycle, stem cells of each type activate lineage commitment. Dissecting the inter-stem-cell crosstalk governing this intricate coordination has been difficult, because mutations affecting one lineage often affect the other. Here we identify transcription factor NFIB as an unanticipated coordinator of stem cell behaviour. Hair follicle stem-cell-specific conditional targeting of Nfib in mice uncouples stem cell synchrony. Remarkably, this happens not by perturbing hair cycle and follicle architecture, but rather by promoting melanocyte stem cell proliferation and differentiation. The early production of melanin is restricted to melanocyte stem cells at the niche base. Melanocyte stem cells more distant from the dermal papilla are unscathed, thereby preventing hair greying typical of melanocyte stem cell differentiation mutants. Furthermore, we pinpoint KIT-ligand as a dermal papilla signal promoting melanocyte stem cell differentiation. Additionally, through chromatin-immunoprecipitation with high-throughput-sequencing and transcriptional profiling, we identify endothelin 2 (Edn2) as an NFIB target aberrantly activated in NFIB-deficient hair follicle stem cells. Ectopically induced Edn2 recapitulates NFIB-deficient phenotypes in wild-type mice. Conversely, endothelin receptor antagonists and/or KIT blocking antibodies prevent precocious melanocyte stem cell differentiation in the NFIB-deficient niche. Our findings reveal how melanocyte and hair follicle stem cell behaviours maintain reliance upon cooperative factors within the niche, and how this can be uncoupled in injury, stress and disease states."

The cellular prion protein (PrPC) was recently identified as a high affinity neuronal receptor for Aβ oligomers. We report that fibrillar Aβ oligomers recognized by the OC antibody, which have been shown to correlate with the onset and severity of AD, bind preferentially to cells and neurons expressing PrPC. The binding of Aβ oligomers to cell surface PrPC, as well as their downstream activation of Fyn kinase, was dependent on the integrity of cholesterol-rich lipid rafts. In SH-SY5Y cells, fluorescence microscopy and co-localization with subcellular markers revealed that the Aβ oligomers co-internalized with PrPC, accumulated in endosomes, and subsequently trafficked to lysosomes. The cell surface binding, internalization, and downstream toxicity of Aβ oligomers was dependent on the transmembrane low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1). The binding of Aβ oligomers to cell surface PrPC impaired its ability to inhibit the activity of the β-secretase BACE1, which cleaves the amyloid precursor protein to produce Aβ. The green tea polyphenol (−)-epigallocatechin gallate and the red wine extract resveratrol both remodeled the fibrillar conformation of Aβ oligomers. The resulting nonfibrillar oligomers displayed significantly reduced binding to PrPC-expressing cells and were no longer cytotoxic.

The prion protein as a receptor for amyloid-β.Nature. 2010; 466: E3-E4Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Aβ is cleaved out of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through the sequential action of the β-secretase BACE1 (β-site APP-cleaving enzyme-1) and the presenilin-containing γ-secretase complex (23Vardy E.R.

Med. 2005; 11: 464-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In the alternative nonamyloidogenic pathway, APP is first cleaved by the α-secretase, members of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family of zinc metalloproteases, within the Aβ sequence thus precluding production of intact Aβ peptides. In both cell and animal models, PrPC lowered Aβ production through the inhibition of BACE1, the rate-limiting enzyme in the generation of Aβ from APP (24Parkin E.T. Watt N.T. Hussain I. Eckman E.A.

On the basis of these data, we have previously proposed a model in which a normal function of PrPC is to maintain a low level of Aβ through the inhibition of BACE1 (26Kellett K.A. Hooper N.M. Prion protein and Alzheimer disease.Prion. 2009; 3: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Several different Aβ oligomers have been isolated from natural sources, such as AD brain extracts and cerebrospinal fluid, and also prepared synthetically from lyophilized peptide (27Walsh D.M. Selkoe D.J. Aβ oligomers–a decade of discovery.J. Neurochem. 2007; 101: 1172-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). These oligomers range in size from low n dimers and trimers to high molecular mass assemblies of over 1 MDa. Because of the heterogeneity in size and morphology of Aβ oligomers, the identification of the precise assemblies responsible for neurotoxicity in AD has proven difficult. The classification of oligomers according to their structural conformation can be considered a more biologically relevant parameter than size, as this provides information about the surface epitopes that may be important for binding to neuronal receptors (28Glabe C.G. Structural classification of toxic amyloid oligomers.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29639-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). A panel of conformation-specific antibodies, generated by Glabe (28Glabe C.G. Structural classification of toxic amyloid oligomers.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29639-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), indicates that oligomers can be classified into three categories based on the presentation of one of three mutually exclusive structural epitopes. The OC antibody recognizes the so-called fibrillar oligomers, which share a common structural epitope with fibrils, and may represent small fibril protofilaments (29Kayed R. Head E. Sarsoza F. Saing T. Cotman C.W. Necula M. Margol L. Wu J. Breydo L. Thompson J.L. Rasool S. Gurlo T. Butler P. Glabe C.G. Fibril-specific, conformation-dependent antibodies recognize a generic epitope common to amyloid fibrils and fibrillar oligomers that is absent in prefibrillar oligomers.Mol. Neurodegener. 2007; 2: 18-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The A11 antibody recognizes pre-fibrillar oligomers that are early kinetic intermediates (30Kayed R. Glabe C.G. Conformation-dependent anti-amyloid oligomer antibodies.Methods Enzymol. 2006; 413: 326-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and the α-annular protofibril antibody recognizes annular protofibrils or ring-shaped, pore-like oligomers (31Kayed R. Pensalfini A. Margol L. Sokolov Y. Sarsoza F. Head E. Hall J. Glabe C. Annular protofibrils are a structurally and functionally distinct type of amyloid oligomer.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4230-4237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Of these three types of Aβ oligomers, only the fibrillar (OC-positive) oligomers were elevated significantly in human AD brain extracts and correlated with the onset and severity of AD (32Tomic J.L. Pensalfini A. Head E. Glabe C.G. Soluble fibrillar oligomer levels are elevated in Alzheimer's disease brain and correlate with cognitive dysfunction.Neurobiol. Dis. 2009; 35: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to determine whether PrPC mediates the neuronal binding and toxicity of soluble, fibrillar OC-positive Aβ oligomers, which correlate with neuropathology in the AD brain, and to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved. We report that soluble, fibrillar OC-positive Aβ oligomers bind preferentially to, and display selective toxicity toward, cells and neurons expressing PrPC. Disruption of lipid rafts through depletion of cholesterol reduces binding of the Aβ oligomers to the cells and blocks the downstream activation of a member of the Src family kinases (SFK), Fyn kinase. Aβ oligomers stimulate the endocytosis of cell surface PrPC in a mechanism dependent on the transmembrane low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1). LRP1 is also critical for the Aβ oligomer-mediated cytotoxicity. In addition, we show that the Aβ oligomers impair the PrPC-mediated inhibition of BACE1, thus increasing the amyloidogenic processing of APP. Finally, using the polyphenolic compounds (−)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and resveratrol, which are known to remodel the conformation of Aβ oligomers (33Bieschke J. Russ J. Friedrich R.P.

The conformation-specific antibodies OC and A11 were kind gifts from C. Glabe (University of California), and 1A9 (anti-sAPPβ) was provided by I. Hussain (GlaxoSmithKline, Harlow, UK). The fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies donkey anti-mouse and anti-goat AlexaFluor® 488 and 594 were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)- and Texas Red-conjugated streptavidin and goat anti-rabbit Cy5-IgG were purchased from Invitrogen. SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with either empty pIRESneo (BD Biosciences) or expressing murine PrPC containing the 3F4 epitope tag (human M108/M111) were prepared as described previously (36Perera W.S.

In the pIRES vector the cDNA encoding PrPC and the antibiotic resistance gene are translated from a single mRNA transcript, such that expression of the antibiotic resistance gene in the absence of PrPC does not occur (37Rees S.

Therefore, all cells that survive the selection process express PrPC, which was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-PrPC antibodies. Cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS). NB7 human neuroblastoma cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS. Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. The hippocampi of 6–8-day-old Wistar rats were removed as described previously (38Watt N.T. Taylor D.R. Kerrigan T.L. Griffiths H.H. Rushworth J.V. Whitehouse I.J. Hooper N.M. Prion protein facilitates uptake of zinc into neuronal cells.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Brain tissue was removed and incubated with 0.25 μg/ml trypsin for 15 min at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Trypsin digestion was terminated by the addition of equal amounts of PBS, supplemented with 16 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (type I-S; Sigma), 0.5 μg/ml DNase I (type II from bovine pancreas; 125 kilounits/ml; Sigma), and 1.5 mm MgSO4. The tissue was then pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min, resuspended in 2 ml of PBS with 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.5 μg/ml DNase I, and 1.5 mm MgSO4, triturated gently, and then centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min to pellet the hippocampal neurons. The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of minimal Earle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 13 mm glucose, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin and added to poly-l-lysine (1.5 mg/ml)-coated coverslips (0.5 ml/well for 24-well plates). After 24 h, the medium was topped up to 1 ml. After a further 24 h, the culture medium was replaced with one containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated horse serum and 80 μm fluorodeoxyuridine to prevent proliferation of non-neuronal cells. After a further 24 h, the medium was replaced with serum-free Neurobasal medium, supplemented with 2% (v/v) B27, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 80 μm fluorodeoxyuridine, 25 mm glutamic acid, and 0.5 mm glutamine. All experiments were conducted on cells after 5–7 days in culture. Synthetic biotin-Aβ(1–42) containing a 6-carbon linker between the biotin moiety and the N terminus of Aβ was purchased from AnaSpec (San Jose, CA). Aβ oligomers were prepared essentially as described previously (11Laurén J. Gimbel D.A. Nygaard H.B. Gilbert J.W. Strittmatter S.M.

Self-assembly of Aβ(1–42) into globular neurotoxins.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12749-12760Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Briefly, Aβ peptide was dissolved in 1,1,1,3,3,3,-hexafluoropropan-2-ol to break down any aggregated material, dried under a stream of N2 gas, and stored at −80 °C. Peptide films of biotin-Aβ(1–42) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to 1 mm and then resuspended in Ham's F-12 medium (Lonza; Basel, Switzerland) to a final monomer concentration of 100 μm. Monomeric Aβ was taken at this point, whereas the remaining solution was incubated at room temperature for 16 h. The resulting preparation was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min to pellet out any fibrillar material, and the supernatant was retained as the oligomer preparation. Pre-formed Aβ oligomers were incubated in the presence or absence of EGCG (4:1 molar excess) or resveratrol (10:1 molar excess) for 24 h at room temperature to remodel Aβ oligomers, and the resulting preparation was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min to pellet out any fibrillar material (33Bieschke J.

Samples were diluted in F-12 medium to ∼500 nm peptide concentration and a 20-μl drop was placed onto a freshly cleaved mica film. Protein was allowed to adhere to the film for 90 s after which time the film was washed in distilled H2O and dried under a stream of N2 gas. Tapping mode AFM was performed using a Nanoscope IIIa Multimode-AFM instrument (Digital Instruments/Veeco; Phoenix, AZ) under ambient conditions. PointProbe®Plus AFM cantilevers (Windsor Scientific; Slough, UK) with a tip radius of <10 nm and resonance frequency of ∼160 kHz were used. Fifty randomly selected particles were measured, and their volumes were calculated based on their shape being ellipsoid due to deposition on a surface (Vellipsoid = 4/3π × r2 × height). The diameter of the sphere of corresponding volume was calculated for each particle, by rearranging the equation (Vsphere = 4/3π × r3) to give the diameter of the particle as it would exist in solution. SH-SY5Y cells were treated with Aβ oligomers at 4 °C to minimize internalization. Cells were then harvested in PBS containing EDTA, blocked with fish skin gelatin, incubated with FITC-streptavidin, and washed. Fluorescence was quantitated using a BD-LSRFortessaTM flow cytometer. Ten thousand events for each condition were measured, having gated the cell population to ensure that only live cells were monitored. Samples were applied to dry nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare). Membranes were blocked overnight in 10% (w/v) nonfat milk in the corresponding antibody diluent buffer (OC antibody (0.1 m Tris, 0.85% (w/v) NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.4), A11 antibody (20 mm Tris, 0.8% (w/v) NaCl, 0.001% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.4), or 6E10 antibody (0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS (PBST 1.5 mm NaH2PO4, 2.7 mm Na2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4)).

https://openalex.org/W2091974799,"The global ridge system is dominated by oceanic rises reflecting large variations in axial depth associated with mantle hotspots. The little-studied Marion Rise is as large as the Icelandic Rise, considering both length and depth, but has an axial rift (rather than a high) nearly its entire length. Uniquely along the Southwest Indian Ridge systematic sampling allows direct examination of crustal architecture over its full length. Here we show that, unlike the Icelandic Rise, peridotites are extensively exposed high on the rise, revealing that the crust is generally thin, and often missing, over a rifted rise. Therefore the Marion Rise must be largely an isostatic response to ancient melting events that created low-density depleted mantle beneath the Southwest Indian Ridge rather than thickened crust or a large thermal anomaly. The origin of this depleted mantle is probably the mantle emplaced into the African asthenosphere during the Karoo and Madagascar flood basalt events. Systematic sampling along the Marion Rise of the Southwest Indian Ridge reveals that its crust is discontinuous and thin, indicating that the rise is supported by low-density depleted mantle beneath it. The Marion Rise, a 3,100-kilimetre-long stretch of the Southwest Indian Ridge beneath the Southern Indian Ocean, is as large as the more extensively studied Icelandic Rise, but has a deep rift valley along most of its length rather than an axial 'high'. Oceanic rises are elevated regions that are normally associated with mantle hotspots and a thickened crust, indicating that they are the result of thermal anomalies in the mantle. Huaiyang Zhou and Henry Dick now show that, surprisingly, the crust is generally thin and often missing on the Marion Rise. They conclude that the rise must be largely an isostatic response to ancient melting events that created low-density depleted mantle beneath the ridge."

https://openalex.org/W1993069510,"Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), a master regulator of heat shock responses, plays an important role in tumorigenesis. In this study we demonstrated that HSF1 is required for chemotherapeutic agent-induced cytoprotective autophagy through transcriptional up-regulation of autophagy-related gene ATG7. Interestingly, this is independent of the HSF1 heat shock response function. Treatment of cancer cells with the FDA-approved chemotherapeutic agent carboplatin induced autophagy and growth inhibition, which were significantly increased upon knockdown of HSF1. Mechanistic studies revealed that HSF1 regulates autophagy by directly binding to ATG7 promoter and transcriptionally up-regulating its expression. Significantly, breast cancer patient sample study revealed that a higher ATG7 expression level is associated with poor patient survival. This novel finding was further confirmed by analysis of two independent patient databases, demonstrating a prognostic value of ATG7. Furthermore, a strong positive correlation was observed between levels of HSF1 and ATG7 in triple-negative breast cancer patient samples, thus validating our in vitro findings. This is the first study identifying a critical role for HSF1 in controlling cytoprotective autophagy through regulation of ATG7, which is distinct from the HSF1 function in the heat shock response. This is also the first study demonstrating a prognostic value of ATG7 in breast cancer patients. These findings strongly argue that combining chemotherapeutic agents with autophagy inhibition by repressing HSF1/ATG7 axis represents a promising strategy for future cancer treatment."

Microglia are resident brain macrophages, which become inflammatory activated in response to infection or tissue damage, producing proinflammatory cytokines (such as tumor necrosis factor α, TNF-α), becoming phagocytic, and in some circumstances inducing neuronal death. Numerous mechanisms of neuronal death have been described, including phagoptosis, necrosis, and apoptosis. Phagoptosis is a recently described mode of cell death caused by phagocytosis of otherwise viable cells and can occur progressively in vivo and in vitro when inflamed microglia phagocytose viable neurons that temporarily expose phosphatidylserine due to mild oxidative stress (2Neher J.J.

Apoptosis is controlled by the intrinsic or extrinsic pathways. The intrinsic pathway is mediated by Bcl-2 family proteins causing release of cytochrome c from mitochondria leading to activation of caspase-9 via formation of the cytosolic apoptosome complex with Apaf-1. The extrinsic pathway is triggered by binding of death ligands (such as TNF-α) to death receptors of the tumor necrosis family (TNF), which results in assembly of a receptor-associated complex, allowing activation of the initiator caspase-8. Once activated by their respective upstream signals, caspase-8 and -9 may cleave and activate downstream executioner caspases -3 and -7, which, in turn, cleave a plethora of target proteins resulting in apoptotic death (7Taylor R.C. Cullen S.P. Martin S.J. Apoptosis: controlled demolition at the cellular level.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). Novel non-apoptotic roles for caspase-8 have been described recently. For example, in response to TNF-α, caspase-8 can play a prosurvival role in complex with binding partner FLIPL (FLICE-like inhibitory protein long).

The specific RIPK1 inhibitor necrostatin-1 inhibits any necrotic death that is dependent on RIPK1 activity, and this regulated form of necrosis has been referred to as necroptosis or programmed necrosis (6Galluzzi L.

Identification of RIP1 kinase as a specific cellular target of necrostatins.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1468) Google Scholar). Necrostatin-1 was identified as a compound that reduced infarct size in a rodent model of stroke, indicating that necroptosis may contribute to neuronal death following ischemic injury (11Degterev A.

Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2023) Google Scholar). In addition to suppression of necroptosis, caspase-8 has been demonstrated to be required for inflammatory activation of BV2, a transformed microglial cell line (12Burguillos M.A. Deierborg T. Kavanagh E. Persson A. Hajji N. Garcia-Quintanilla A. Cano J. Brundin P. Englund E. Venero J.L. Joseph B. Caspase signalling controls microglia activation and neurotoxicity.Nature. 2011; 472: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). We were therefore interested to test whether inflammatory stimuli would cause caspase-8 activation in primary microglia and whether such activity would play a role in activation or survival of these cells. Here, we demonstrate that caspase-8 activity is required for the survival of inflammatory activated microglia and that caspase inhibitors can exert a neuroprotective effect by killing neurotoxic microglia by necroptosis. receptor-interacting protein kinase benzyloxycarbonyl fluoromethyl ketone Z-Ile-Glu(OMe)-Thr-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin propidium iodide Toll-like receptor 4 Z-Asp(OMe)-Glu(OMe)-Val-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone. All experiments were performed in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act (1986) and approved by the Cambridge University local ethical committee. Mixed neuronal/glial cultures were prepared from the cerebella of postnatal day 5–7 rats as described previously (13Kinsner A. Pilotto V. Deininger S. Brown G.C. Coecke S. Hartung T. Bal-Price A.

Pure microglia were prepared from mixed cortical astroglial cultures as described previously (2Neher J.J. Neniskyte U. Zhao J.W. Bal-Price A. Tolkovsky A.M. Brown G.C. Inhibition of microglial phagocytosis is sufficient to prevent inflammatory neuronal death.J. Immunol. 2011; 186: 4973-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Reagents were procured as follows: lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Sigma), lipoteichoic acid (LTA, InvivoGen), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α, Sigma), Z-Val-Ala-d,l-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-fmk, Bachem).

Neuronal and microglial cell survival was quantified as described previously (2Neher J.J. Neniskyte U. Zhao J.W. Bal-Price A. Tolkovsky A.M. Brown G.C. Inhibition of microglial phagocytosis is sufficient to prevent inflammatory neuronal death.J. Immunol. 2011; 186: 4973-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Briefly, live mixed neuronal glial cultures were incubated in culture medium with 1 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) and 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342. Cells with PI-positive nuclei were counted as necrotic, whereas cells with PI-negative but condensed and fragmented nuclei as shown by Hoechst staining were counted as apoptotic. Microglia were visualized with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled isolectin-B4 (1 μg/ml, Invitrogen). Anti-TNF-α (Abcam) blocking antibody was Fc-blocked with an F(ab′)2 fragment antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The soluble TNF-α level was assessed in culture medium using Quantikine Elisa Kits (R&D Systems). Caspase-8 activity was measured using the fluorogenic substrate Ac-IETD-AMC following a protocol from Ref. 14Ciechomska I.A. Goemans C.G. Tolkovsky A.M. Molecular links between autophagy and apoptosis.Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 445: 175-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. The normality of data was verified using the Shapiro-Wilk test. In vitro data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and post hoc Bonferroni test. Results were considered significant if p < 0.05. We previously demonstrated that microglia can phagocytose live neurons upon induction of inflammatory signals and that caspase inhibitors can prevent this method of neuronal loss, although the exact mechanism of neuroprotection was unclear (2Neher J.J. Neniskyte U. Zhao J.W. Bal-Price A. Tolkovsky A.M. Brown G.C. Inhibition of microglial phagocytosis is sufficient to prevent inflammatory neuronal death.J. Immunol. 2011; 186: 4973-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 13Kinsner A. Pilotto V. Deininger S. Brown G.C. Coecke S. Hartung T. Bal-Price A. Inflammatory neurodegeneration induced by lipoteichoic acid from Staphylococcus aureus is mediated by glia activation, nitrosative and oxidative stress, and caspase activation.J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 1132-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recently, caspase-8 has been found to suppress RIPK1-mediated necroptosis (15Green D.R. Oberst A. Dillon C.P. Weinlich R. Salvesen G.S. RIPK-dependent necrosis and its regulation by caspases: a mystery in five acts.Mol. Cell. 2011; 44: 9-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that caspase inhibitors may induce death of microglial cells following inflammatory activation, thereby sparing the neurons. To test this possibility, we prepared mixed cultures of neurons, astrocytes, and microglia from rat cerebella, and treated cultures with LPS, a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist, to induce inflammatory activation of glial cells. Cultures were stained with Hoechst 33342 and PI to examine viability and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled isolectin-B4 to visualize microglia (Fig. 1A). After 72 h of LPS treatment, we observed a significant increase in microglial numbers as well as altered morphology indicative of microglial activation (Fig. 1, A–D). A numbers of astrocytes were unaffected after 72 h of LPS treatment (Fig. 1E). In the absence of LPS, treatment of cultures with the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk had no effect on number or viability of any cell type (Fig. 1, B and E). However, addition of Z-VAD-fmk to cultures pretreated with LPS resulted in a large increase in the number of PI-positive dead microglia (Fig. 1B). This finding suggested that caspases were preventing necrosis in the activated microglia. To test which caspases were required for microglial survival in LPS-stimulated cultures, we used two relatively selective caspase inhibitors; DEVD-fmk, which preferentially inhibits caspase-3 and -7, and the caspase-8 inhibitor IETD-fmk. Addition of DEVD-fmk had no effect on microglial survival in the presence or absence of LPS (Fig. 1, A and C). In contrast, addition of IETD to LPS-treated cultures resulted in almost complete death of microglia (Fig. 1, A and D). Of note, cell death induced by caspase inhibition in LPS-treated cultures was restricted to microglia as neither astrocytic nor neuronal viability or numbers were affected in these conditions (Fig. 1E and data not shown). In sum, the data indicated that in the presence of LPS, inhibition of a select set of caspases, most likely caspase-8, induced death of microglia specifically. Burguillos and colleagues (12Burguillos M.A. Deierborg T. Kavanagh E. Persson A. Hajji N. Garcia-Quintanilla A. Cano J. Brundin P. Englund E. Venero J.L. Joseph B. Caspase signalling controls microglia activation and neurotoxicity.Nature. 2011; 472: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that LPS treatment could induce caspase-8 activity in the immortalized microglial cell line BV2. To test whether this occurred in primary cells, we prepared cultures of pure microglia from rat cortices and then made cell extracts following LPS treatment to test for caspase-8 activity using the specific fluorogenic substrate IETD-AMC (12Burguillos M.A. Deierborg T. Kavanagh E. Persson A. Hajji N. Garcia-Quintanilla A. Cano J. Brundin P. Englund E. Venero J.L. Joseph B. Caspase signalling controls microglia activation and neurotoxicity.Nature. 2011; 472: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Indeed, LPS treatment induced a 2.6-fold increase in IETDase activity in extracts from pure microglia (Fig. 1F), similar to that previously reported using the BV2 cell line (12Burguillos M.A. Deierborg T. Kavanagh E. Persson A. Hajji N. Garcia-Quintanilla A. Cano J. Brundin P. Englund E. Venero J.L. Joseph B. Caspase signalling controls microglia activation and neurotoxicity.Nature. 2011; 472: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The IETDase activity was inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of the inhibitor IETD-CHO, whereas increased DEVDase activity extracted from apoptotic UV-treated microglia was not inhibited by IETD-CHO (data not shown), indicating that increased IETDase activity indeed reflected increased caspase-8 activity and not activity of caspase 3/7. Importantly, a short 2-h incubation of LPS-treated microglia with Z-VAD-fmk prior to measurement was sufficient to inhibit the IETDase activity induced by 24-h stimulation with LPS (Fig. 1F). Thus, LPS activated caspase-8 in microglia, and this activity was inhibited by both IETD and Z-VAD. The above data indicated a prosurvival role for caspase-8 activity following stimulation of microglia with the TLR4 ligand LPS. We next tested whether a similar response occurred in microglia activated by other proinflammatory stimuli. In addition to TLR4, the Toll-like receptor family member TLR2 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory neurodegenerative processes (13Kinsner A. Pilotto V. Deininger S. Brown G.C. Coecke S. Hartung T. Bal-Price A. Inflammatory neurodegeneration induced by lipoteichoic acid from Staphylococcus aureus is mediated by glia activation, nitrosative and oxidative stress, and caspase activation.J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 1132-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We tested whether TLR2 ligation would induce a similar response to LPS using the TLR2 ligand LTA. Following pretreatment of cultures with LTA for a 24-h addition of Z-VAD for a further 24 h resulted in the death of almost all microglia, whereas astrocytes were not affected (Fig. 1, H and E). We also tested TNF-α as a proinflammatory stimulus as its levels are elevated in many brain pathologies (16Venters H.D. Dantzer R. Kelley K.W. A new concept in neurodegeneration: TNFα is a silencer of survival signals.Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 175-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Addition of TNF-α to mixed cultures had little effect on microglial numbers or viability alone; however, TNF-α pretreatment for 24 h followed by addition of Z-VAD for 24 h killed most microglia in culture (Fig. 1G). In addition, a significant 2-fold induction of IETDase activity was detected in cell extracts prepared from pure microglia following TNF-α, which was inhibited by further addition of Z-VAD (Fig. 1F). Thus, our data indicate that prosurvival caspase-8 activity was induced in microglia stimulated by a TLR4 ligand, a TLR2 ligand, and TNF-α. Inflammatory activation of microglia with TLR ligands such as LPS and LTA results in the release of soluble TNF-α into the surrounding medium (2Neher J.J. Neniskyte U. Zhao J.W. Bal-Price A. Tolkovsky A.M. Brown G.C. Inhibition of microglial phagocytosis is sufficient to prevent inflammatory neuronal death.J. Immunol. 2011; 186: 4973-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). As we also observed that treatment with TNF-α alone was capable of inducing the prosurvival caspase activity, we postulated that the LPS- and LTA-induced effects were secondary to TNF-α release and binding to microglia. To test whether TLR signaling could induce prosurvival caspase activity independently of TNF-α, we used GM6001, a matrix metalloprotease and TNF-α converting enzyme inhibitor shown previously to prevent TNF-α processing and release (17Solorzano C.C. Ksontini R. Pruitt J.H. Auffenberg T. Tannahill C. Galardy R.E. Schultz G.P. MacKay S.L. Copeland 3rd, E.M. Moldawer L.L. A matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor prevents processing of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF α) and abrogates endotoxin-induced lethality.Shock. 1997; 7: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although pretreatment of cultures with GM6001 prevented TNF-α release following LPS treatment (Fig. 2B), it did not prevent microglial death induced by Z-VAD in LPS- and GM6001-treated cultures (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, although a TNF-α blocking antibody prevented Z-VAD-induced microglial death in cultures treated with recombinant TNF-α, it did not prevent the microglial death in cultures treated with LPS and Z-VAD, despite the fact that LPS induced release of TNF-α at lower concentrations than that of recombinant TNF-α added in our experiments (250–300 pg/ml TNF-α release following LPS versus 50 ng/ml recombinant TNF-α added) (Fig. 2, B and C). We conclude that although TNF-α signaling is sufficient to induce a prosurvival caspase response in microglia, TNF-α release is not required for LPS to trigger a similar response. Recently, a number of studies have demonstrated a prosurvival role for caspase-8 activated by the TNF-α receptor or TLR3 (15Green D.R. Oberst A. Dillon C.P. Weinlich R. Salvesen G.S. RIPK-dependent necrosis and its regulation by caspases: a mystery in five acts.Mol. Cell. 2011; 44: 9-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Caspase-8 in “survival mode” has been demonstrated to suppress a novel form of necrotic death, termed necroptosis, by suppressing the pronecrotic action of RIPK1. Necroptosis is specifically defined in molecular terms as a form of regulated necrosis, which is dependent on RIPK1 activity, and as such, is inhibitable by compounds that inhibit RIPK1 kinase activity such as necrostatin-1 (6Galluzzi L. Vitale I. Abrams J.M. Alnemri E.S. Baehrecke E.H. Blagosklonny M.V. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. El-Deiry W.S. Fulda S. Gottlieb E. Green D.R. Hengartner M.O. Kepp O. Knight R.A. Kumar S. Lipton S.A.

Molecular definitions of cell death subroutines: recommendations of the Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death 2012.Cell Death Differ. 2012; 19: 107-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). Necrostatin-1 was first discovered in a screen for regulators of necrotic death, and its death inhibiting activity is wholly dependent on inhibition of RIPK-1 activity (9Degterev A. Hitomi J. Germscheid M. Ch'en I.L. Korkina O. Teng X. Abbott D. Cuny G.D. Yuan C. Wagner G. Hedrick S.M. Gerber S.A. Lugovskoy A. Yuan J.

Activity and specificity of necrostatin-1, small molecule inhibitor of RIP1 kinase.Cell Death Differ. 2013; 20: 366Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, we found that microglia killed by caspase inhibition, and inflammatory stimuli were always PI-positive (Fig. 1A), indicating necrosis, particularly as Z-VAD inhibits apoptosis, and thus, PI-positive cells were unlikely to appear due to secondary necrosis following apoptosis. To test whether inflammatory activated microglia died by RIPK1-dependent necroptosis following caspase inhibition, we tested the effects of the inhibitor of RIPK1, necrostatin-1. Cultures were stimulated with LPS or TNF-α for 24 h prior to addition of necrostatin-1 (30 μm), and then 1 h later, caspase inhibitors were added. Remarkably, necrostatin-1 treatment almost completely prevented Z-VAD-induced microglial death in LPS-treated cultures (Fig. 3A). In addition, necrostatin-1 also prevented IETD-induced death of LPS-activated microglia (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, we found that IETD, in contrast to Z-VAD, induced a low but consistent amount of microglial death in unstimulated cultures, which was also completely rescued by necrostatin-1 treatment (Fig. 3, B and D). This low level of necroptosis induced by IETD may reflect a low level activation of microglia in unstimulated cultures. Necrostatin-1 treatment was also sufficient to inhibit caspase inhibitor-induced microglial death in TNF-α stimulated cultures (Fig. 3, C and D). Furthermore, we tested an inactive analog of necrostatin-1, necrostatin-1I, which does not inhibit RIPK1 or necroptosis in other settings (28Degterev A. Maki J.L. Yuan J. Activity and specificity of necrostatin-1, small molecule inhibitor of RIP1 kinase.Cell Death Differ. 2013; 20: 366Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In contrast to necrostatin-1, necrostatin-1-I was unable to protect microglia against LPS- and Z-VAD-induced death, further supporting the finding that caspase inhibitor induced death of activated microglia was indeed executed by necroptosis (Fig. 3E). We conclude that both LPS and TNF-α induce prosurvival caspase-8 signaling in microglia that acts by suppressing RIPK1-dependent necroptosis. We next tested whether caspase-dependent neuroprotection in a model of inflammatory neurodegeneration might be dependent on necroptotic killing of microglia rather than via direct protective effects on neurons. We have previously described microglial-dependent neuronal death in vitro and in vivo that is triggered by a number of proinflammatory stimuli, including LPS, LTA, and Aβ peptide, with neuronal death occurring between 48–72 h after addition of the inflammatory stimulus (2Neher J.J. Neniskyte U. Zhao J.W. Bal-Price A. Tolkovsky A.M. Brown G.C. Inhibition of microglial phagocytosis is sufficient to prevent inflammatory neuronal death.J.

Primary phagocytosis of viable neurons by microglia activated with LPS or Aβ is dependent on calreticulin/LRP phagocytic signalling.J. Neuroinflammation. 2012; 9: 196Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Interestingly treatment with either Z-VAD or IETD prevented microglial-mediated death of neurons induced by LPS treatment (Fig. 4, A and B; for microglial data from these experiments, see Fig. 1, B and D). In contrast, the selective caspase-3 and -7 inhibitor DEVD did not prevent LPS-induced primary phagocytosis, correlating with the fact that it did not induce microglial death in LPS-activated cultures (Figs. 1C and 4C). Remarkably, necrostatin-1 rescue of microglia from Z-VAD-induced necroptosis was sufficient to restore neuronal loss following 72 h of LPS treatment (Fig. 4, D and E). These data demonstrate that caspase inhibitors can exert a neuroprotective effect by inducing necroptosis of microglia. We have found that inhibition of caspase-8 causes necroptosis in inflammatory activated microglia but not in neurons, astrocytes, or unactivated microglia. In a disease model where inflamed microglia exert a neurotoxic action, caspase-8 inhibition was sufficient to cause neuroprotection in a manner dependent on necroptosis of microglia. We considered the possibility that inhibition of caspase-8 might in principle protect neurons from inflammatory neuronal loss by either by blocking inflammation in the glia, blocking death in the neurons, or inducing death in the microglia. However, we show that inflammatory activation was not impeded by the caspase inhibitors that induced necroptosis, as the amount of LPS-induced inflammation measured by TNF-α in the culture medium (Fig. 2B) was not reduced. Moreover, we added the caspase inhibitors 24–48 h after adding the LPS specifically to avoid blocking prior to inflammatory activation. Most importantly, we found that necrostatin-1, which prevented necroptosis of the microglia, fully restored the neuronal loss prevented by caspase inhibition. We have previously shown that specifically killing microglia (with leucine methyl ester) prevents LPS and LTA induced neuronal loss in the model used here (2Neher J.J. Neniskyte U. Zhao J.W. Bal-Price A. Tolkovsky A.M. Brown G.C. Inhibition of microglial phagocytosis is sufficient to prevent inflammatory neuronal death.J. Immunol. 2011; 186: 4973-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 5Fricker M. Oliva-Martín M.J. Brown G.C. Primary phagocytosis of viable neurons by microglia activated with LPS or Aβ is dependent on calreticulin/LRP phagocytic signalling.J. Neuroinflammation. 2012; 9: 196Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that by killing microglia, caspase inhibition is sufficient to prevent inflammatory neuronal loss in this model. Administration of the relatively caspase-3/-7 specific inhibitor DEVD-fmk was not sufficient to kill inflammatory activated microglia. In addition, we reported previously that the caspase inhibitor boc-aspartyl(OMe)-fluoromethylketone inhibited etoposide-induced apoptosis in neurons but did not affect microglial activation, proliferation, or survival following addition of LPS and thus did not prevent LPS-induced neuronal loss (4Fricker M. Neher J.J. Zhao J.W. Théry C. Tolkovsky A.M. Brown G.C. MFG-E8 Mediates Primary Phagocytosis of Viable Neurons during Neuroinflammation.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 2657-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In contrast Z-VAD-fmk and IETD-fmk, both of which prevented an increase in caspase-8 IETDase activity in activated microglia, induced necroptosis of activated microglia. Together, these data support the conclusion that inhibition of caspase-8 activity (rather than caspase-3/-7) is required to induce necroptosis of inflamed microglia and raise the intriguing possibility that further development of caspase family member-specific inhibitors may allow selective modulation of neuronal death or inflamed microglial survival in vivo. It was recently demonstrated that LPS activates microglia via caspase-8, and it was concluded that inhibition of caspase-8 blocks inflammatory microglia-mediated neurotoxicity by preventing inflammatory activation of microglia (12Burguillos M.A. Deierborg T. Kavanagh E. Persson A. Hajji N. Garcia-Quintanilla A. Cano J. Brundin P. Englund E. Venero J.L. Joseph B. Caspase signalling controls microglia activation and neurotoxicity.Nature. 2011; 472: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in contrast to our findings, Burguillos et al. (12Burguillos M.A. Deierborg T. Kavanagh E. Persson A. Hajji N. Garcia-Quintanilla A. Cano J. Brundin P. Englund E. Venero J.L. Joseph B. Caspase signalling controls microglia activation and neurotoxicity.Nature. 2011; 472: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) did not note any microglial death in response to caspase-8 inhibition. However, they were using a microglial cell line, BV2, rather than primary microglia, and we have repeated our experiments in BV2 cells and find that caspase-8 inhibition does not induce death in LPS-activated BV2 cells (data not shown). This difference might be the result of BV2 transformation by v-myc and v-raf or other genetic changes. In vivo, caspase-8 inhibition protected neurons in a MPTP model of Parkinson disease and reduced the density of activated microglia. This finding is compatible with caspase-8 inhibition causing necroptosis of microglia (12Burguillos M.A. Deierborg T. Kavanagh E. Persson A. Hajji N. Garcia-Quintanilla A. Cano J. Brundin P. Englund E. Venero J.L. Joseph B. Caspase signalling controls microglia activation and neurotoxicity.Nature. 2011; 472: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Burguillos et al. (12Burguillos M.A. Deierborg T. Kavanagh E. Persson A. Hajji N. Garcia-Quintanilla A. Cano J. Brundin P. Englund E. Venero J.L. Joseph B. Caspase signalling controls microglia activation and neurotoxicity.Nature. 2011; 472: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) also reported that caspase-8 was activated in microglia from patients with Alzheimer and Parkinson disease, supporting the possibility that caspase-8 inhibition might be beneficial in these neurodegenerative diseases. Caspase-8 inhibition by IETD has been shown to be protective in vivo against the delayed neuronal loss that occurs after focal cerebral ischemia in rats (a model of stroke) and also to reduce tissue damage following hypoxicischemic brain injury in newborn rats (18Inoue S. Davis D.P. Drummond J.C. Cole D.J. Patel P.M. The combination of isoflurane and caspase 8 inhibition results in sustained neuroprotection in rats subject to focal cerebral ischemia.Anesth.

In addition the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh can also inhibit caspase-8 and exert neuroprotective effects in a number of neurodegenerative disease models (23Venero J.L. Burguillos M.A. Brundin P. Joseph B. The executioners sing a new song: killer caspases activate microglia.Cell Death Differ. 2011; 18: 1679-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which these caspase inhibitors exert neuroprotective effects merits further investigation given the recent findings of Burguillos et al. (12Burguillos M.A. Deierborg T. Kavanagh E. Persson A. Hajji N. Garcia-Quintanilla A. Cano J. Brundin P. Englund E. Venero J.L. Joseph B. Caspase signalling controls microglia activation and neurotoxicity.Nature. 2011; 472: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) and those presented in this paper. We and others found that LPS, LTA, and TNF-α caused limited caspase-8 activation in microglia without inducing microglial apoptosis (12Burguillos M.A. Deierborg T. Kavanagh E. Persson A. Hajji N. Garcia-Quintanilla A. Cano J. Brundin P. Englund E. Venero J.L. Joseph B. Caspase signalling controls microglia activation and neurotoxicity.Nature. 2011; 472: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In certain cell lines, LPS can activate caspase-8 via TLR4 recruitment of TRIF (TIR-domain containing adapter-inducing interferon-β), and TRIF recruitment of RIPK1 to form a complex with FADD, which recruits and activates procaspase-8 (24Kaiser W.J. Offermann M.K. Apoptosis induced by the toll-like receptor adaptor TRIF is dependent on its receptor interacting protein homotypic interaction motif.J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 4942-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, inhibition of caspase-8 results in the formation of an alternative complex (IIb) containing at least RIPK1 and RIPK3, which triggers necroptosis, and this can be prevented by necrostatin-1, which blocks the kinase activity of RIPK1. Active caspase-8 can cleave RIPK1 to block its activity (25Rébé C. Cathelin S. Launay S. Filomenko R. Prévotat L. L'Ollivier C. Gyan E. Micheau O. Grant S. Dubart-Kupperschmitt A. Fontenay M. Solary E. Caspase-8 prevents sustained activation of NF-κB in monocytes undergoing macrophagic differentiation.Blood. 2007; 109: 1442-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and cleave the deubiquitinase CYLD to block its activation of RIPK1 (26O'Donnell M.A. Perez-Jimenez E. Oberst A. Ng A. Massoumi R. Xavier R. Green D.R. Ting A.T. Caspase 8 inhibits programmed necrosis by processing CYLD.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 1437-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). TLR3 ligation in the presence of suppressors of cIAP activity results in recruitment and activation of a preformed cytosolic complex containing caspase-8 and RIP1K, termed the ripoptosome, which is capable of inducing both apoptotic and necroptotic death (27Feoktistova M. Geserick P. Kellert B. Dimitrova D.P. Langlais C. Hupe M. Cain K. MacFarlane M. Häcker G.

Thus, it is possible that ligation of TLR2 and TLR4 in microglia may result in engagement of a ripoptosome-like complex, whereupon caspase-8 inhibition deinhibits RIPK1, allowing necroptosis to occur (Fig. 5). In conclusion, caspase-8 inhibition protects neurons in a model of inflammatory neuronal loss by specifically killing activated microglia by enabling necroptosis. It will be important to test whether caspase-8 inhibition is protective in vivo in models of neurological disease by similar mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2093872436,"Secreted levels of HSP90α and overexpression of TCF12 have been associated with the enhancement of colorectal cancer (CRC) cell migration and invasion. In this study, we observed that CRC patients with tumor TCF12 overexpression exhibited both a higher rate of metastatic occurrence and a higher average serum HSP90α level compared with patients without TCF12 overexpression. Therefore, we studied the relationship between the actions of secreted HSP90α and TCF12. Like overexpressed TCF12, secreted HSP90α or recombinant HSP90α (rHSP90α) induced fibronectin expression and repressed E-cadherin, connexin-26, connexin-43, and gap junction levels in CRC cells. Consistently, rHSP90α stimulated invasive outgrowths of CRC cells from spherical structures during three-dimensional culture. rHSP90α also induced TCF12 expression in CRC cells. Its effects on CRC cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration, and invasion were drastically prevented when TCF12 was knocked down. This suggests that TCF12 expression is required for secreted HSP90α to enhance CRC cell spreading. Through the cellular receptor CD91, rHSP90α facilitated the complex formation of CD91 with IκB kinases (IKKs) α and β and increased the levels of phosphorylated (active) IKKα/β and NF-κB. Use of an IKKα/β inhibitor or ectopic overexpression of dominant-negative IκBα efficiently repressed rHSP90α-induced TCF12 expression. Moreover, κB motifs were recognized in the gene sequence of the TCF12 promoter, and a physical association between NF-κB and the TCF12 promoter was detected in rHSP90α-treated CRC cells. Together, these results suggest that the CD91/IKK/NF-κB signaling cascade is involved in secreted HSP90α-induced TCF12 expression, leading to E-cadherin down-regulation and enhanced CRC cell migration/invasion."
https://openalex.org/W1973180459,"Three Sec7 guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) activate ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) to facilitate coating of transport vesicles within the secretory and endosomal pathways. GBF1 recruits COPI to pre-Golgi and Golgi compartments, whereas BIG1 and BIG2 recruit AP1 and GGA clathrin adaptors to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes. Here, we report a functional cascade between these GEFs by showing that GBF1-activated ARFs (ARF4 and ARF5, but not ARF3) facilitate BIG1 and BIG2 recruitment to the TGN. We localize GBF1 ultrastructurally to the pre-Golgi, the Golgi, and also the TGN. Our findings suggest a model in which GBF1 localized within pre-Golgi and Golgi compartments mediates ARF activation to facilitate recruitment of COPI to membranes, whereas GBF1 localized at the TGN mediates ARF activation that leads to the recruitment of BIG1 and BIG2 to the TGN. Membrane-associated BIG1/2 then activates ARFs that recruit clathrin adaptors. In this cascade, an early acting GEF (GBF1) activates ARFs that mediate recruitment of late acting GEFs (BIG1/2) to coordinate coating events within the pre-Golgi/Golgi/TGN continuum. Such coordination may optimize the efficiency and/or selectivity of cargo trafficking through the compartments of the secretory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2058241702,"Mannan-binding lectin (MBL)-associated serine proteases, MASP-1 and MASP-2, have been thought to autoactivate when MBL/ficolin·MASP complexes bind to pathogens triggering the complement lectin pathway. Autoactivation of MASPs occurs in two steps: 1) zymogen autoactivation, when one proenzyme cleaves another proenzyme molecule of the same protease, and 2) autocatalytic activation, when the activated protease cleaves its own zymogen. Using recombinant catalytic fragments, we demonstrated that a stable proenzyme MASP-1 variant (R448Q) cleaved the inactive, catalytic site Ser-to-Ala variant (S646A). The autoactivation steps of MASP-1 were separately quantified using these mutants and the wild type enzyme. Analogous mutants were made for MASP-2, and rate constants of the autoactivation steps as well as the possible cross-activation steps between MASP-1 and MASP-2 were determined. Based on the rate constants, a kinetic model of lectin pathway activation was outlined. The zymogen autoactivation rate of MASP-1 is ∼3000-fold higher, and the autocatalytic activation of MASP-1 is about 140-fold faster than those of MASP-2. Moreover, both activated and proenzyme MASP-1 can effectively cleave proenzyme MASP-2. MASP-3, which does not autoactivate, is also cleaved by MASP-1 quite efficiently. The structure of the catalytic region of proenzyme MASP-1 R448Q was solved at 2.5 Å. Proenzyme MASP-1 R448Q readily cleaves synthetic substrates, and it is inhibited by a specific canonical inhibitor developed against active MASP-1, indicating that zymogen MASP-1 fluctuates between an inactive and an active-like conformation. The determined structure provides a feasible explanation for this phenomenon. In summary, autoactivation of MASP-1 is crucial for the activation of MBL/ficolin·MASP complexes, and in the proenzymic phase zymogen MASP-1 controls the process."
https://openalex.org/W2063092400,"Nitric oxide (NO) appears to play an important role in the regulation of thrombosis and hemostasis by inhibiting platelet function. The discovery of NO generation by reduction of nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻) in mammals has led to increased attention to these anions with respect to potential beneficial effects in cardiovascular diseases. We have previously shown that nitrite anions at 0.1 µM inhibit aggregation and activation of human platelet preparations in vitro in the presence of red blood cells and this effect was enhanced by deoxygenation, an effect likely due to NO generation. In the present study, we hypothesized that nitrite and nitrate derived from the diet could also alter platelet function upon their conversion to NO in vivo. To manipulate the levels of nitrite and nitrate in mouse blood, we used antibiotics, NOS inhibitors, low nitrite/nitrate (NOx) diets, endothelial NOS knock-out mice and also supplementation with high levels of nitrite or nitrate in the drinking water. We found that all of these perturbations affected nitrite and nitrate levels but that the lowest whole blood values were obtained by dietary restriction. Platelet aggregation and ATP release were measured in whole blood and the results show an inverse correlation between nitrite/nitrate levels and platelet activity in aggregation and ATP release. Furthermore, we demonstrated that nitrite-supplemented group has a prolonged bleeding time compared with control or low NOx diet group. These results show that diet restriction contributes greatly to blood nitrite and nitrate levels and that platelet reactivity can be significantly affected by these manipulations. Our study suggests that endogenous levels of nitrite and nitrate may be used as a biomarker for predicting platelet function and that dietary manipulation may affect thrombotic processes."

Using two independent protein interaction screens, we show that these kinases associate, in an oxidation-dependent manner, with Prdx1, an enzyme that regulates the cellular redox state by reducing hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. Mst1 inactivates Prdx1 by phosphorylating it at Thr-90 and Thr-183, leading to accumulation of hydrogen peroxide in cells. These results suggest that hydrogen peroxide-stimulated Mst1 activates a positive feedback loop to sustain an oxidizing cellular state."
https://openalex.org/W2094490061,"LL-37 is an antimicrobial peptide produced by human cells that can down-regulate the lipopolysaccharide-induced innate immune responses and up-regulate double-stranded (ds) RNA-induced innate responses through Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). The murine LL-37 ortholog, mCRAMP, also inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced responses, but unlike LL-37, it inhibited viral-induced responses in mouse cells. A fluorescence polarization assay showed that LL-37 was able to bind dsRNA better than mCRAMP. In the human lung epithelial cell line BEAS-2B, LL-37, but not mCRAMP, colocalized with TLR3, and the colocalization was increased in the presence of dsRNA. The presence of poly(I:C) increased the accumulation of LL-37 in Rab5 endosomes. Signaling by cells induced with both LL-37 and poly(I:C) was sensitive to inhibitors that affect clathrin-independent trafficking, whereas signaling by poly(I:C) alone was not, suggesting that the LL-37-poly(I:C) complex trafficked to signaling endosomes by a different mechanism than poly(I:C) alone. siRNA knockdown of known LL-37 receptors identified that FPRL1 was responsible for TLR3 signaling induced by LL-37-poly(I:C). These results show that LL-37 and mCRAMP have different activities in TLR3 signaling and that LL-37 can redirect trafficking of poly(I:C) to effect signaling by TLR3 in early endosomes in a mechanism that involves FPRL1."
https://openalex.org/W2100178504,"Skeletal muscle remodeling in response to muscle disuse and unloading is known to be associated with so-called ER stress, which, in turn, activates autophagy and contributes to muscle atrophy. Different molecules are involved in ER stress-induced autophagy, among which PKCθ has recently been described. In this study, we dissected both in vitro and in vivo ER stress-induced autophagy pathways in muscle. Using C2C12 muscle cells in culture, we demonstrated that PKC activation induced autophagy in the absence of ER stress. We further demonstrated that PKCθ was strongly activated in cultured myoblasts and myotubes during ER stress induced by different stimuli, such as TG or TN treatment, and that it localized into Lc3-positive autophagic dots upon TG treatment. Neither Akt dephosphorylation nor Foxo or GSK3β activation was observed in these conditions. Moreover, PKCθ inhibition in myoblasts and myotubes prevented ER stress-induced Lc3 activation and autophagic dot formation, but not ER stress. In vivo, lack of PKCθ prevented both food deprivation- and immobilization-induced autophagy and muscle atrophy, irrespective of Akt pathway inhibition. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PKCθ functions as an ER stress sensor in skeletal muscle, required for ER-stress-dependent autophagy activation, and can be proposed as a novel molecular target to maintain muscle homeostasis in response to external stimuli, such as disuse and unloading, still allowing intracellular clearance.—Madaro, L., Marrocco, V., Carnio, S., Sandri, M., Bouché, M.

https://openalex.org/W1978652875,"WNK1 is a widely expressed serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates multiple cellular and organ functions via diverse mechanisms. We previously reported that endothelial-specific deletion of Wnk1 in mice results in embryonic lethality, with angiogenesis and cardiac defects beginning at embryonic day ∼10.5. Here, we further investigated the signaling mechanism by which WNK1 regulates embryonic cardiovascular development. We found that mice with a global deletion of Osr1, which encodes oxidative stress-responsive kinase-1, a protein kinase activated by WNK1, died in utero beginning at embryonic day ∼11. The defects in Osr1-null yolk sacs and embryos were virtually identical to those observed in Wnk1-knock-out mice: no mature large vessels in yolk sacs, defective angiogenesis in the brain and intersomitic vessels, and smaller chambers and reduced myocardial trabeculation in mutant hearts. Endothelial-specific deletion of Osr1 generated by crossing Osr1(flox/flox) mice with Tie2-Cre mice phenocopied defects caused by global Osr1 deletion. To investigate whether OSR1 acts downstream of WNK1 in embryonic angiogenesis, we generated a mouse line that carries a catalytically and constitutively active human OSR1 transgene in the ROSA26 locus under the control of a cassette of floxed transcription stop codons. We found that endothelial-specific expression of the constitutively active mutant OSR1, generated by Tie2-Cre-mediated excision of floxed stop codons in the mutated ROSA26 locus, rescued angiogenesis and cardiac defects in global Wnk1-null embryos. These results indicate that WNK1 activation of the OSR1 signaling cascade is an essential pathway that regulates angiogenesis and cardiac formation during mouse embryo development."
https://openalex.org/W2049987250,"Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is an important component in the inflammatory response generated in diseases characterized by autoantibody reactivity to proteins such as SSA/Ro in complex with endogenous nucleic acids. Complement receptor 3 (CR3), a genetic variant of which has been identified as a risk factor in systemic lupus erythematosus, has been shown to induce tolerogenic responses in dendritic cells and suppress TLR4 responses in a murine sepsis model. Accordingly, this study addressed the hypothesis that activation of CR3, influenced by genotype of CD11b, negatively regulates TLR7/8-dependent effector function. Allosteric activation of CD11b via pretreatment with the small molecule, leukadhedrin 1 (LA1), significantly attenuated TLR7/8-induced (hY3 RNA, R848) secretion of TNFα in THP-1 cells and human macrophages isolated from donors homozygous for the ancestral common ITGAM allele at rs1143679. This inhibition was accompanied by profound degradation of the adaptor protein MyD88, an effect not observed with direct inhibition of TLR ligation by an antagonist oligonucleotide. In contrast, the addition of LA1 after incubation with the TLR agonists did not result in MyD88 degradation and subsequent attenuation of TNFα secretion. In TLR7/8-stimulated macrophages isolated from donors heterozygous for the CD11b variant, pretreatment with LA1 did not down-regulate TNFα release. These novel findings support a negative cross-talk between CR3 and TLR pathways likely to be induced by antibodies reactive with ribonucleoproteins and point to the development of CR3-specific agonists as potential therapeutics for diseases such as neonatal lupus."
https://openalex.org/W2050507620,"Breakthroughs in G protein-coupled receptor structure determination based on crystallography have been mainly obtained from receptors occupied in their transmembrane domain core by low molecular weight ligands, and we have only recently begun to elucidate how the extracellular surface of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) allows for the binding of larger peptide molecules. In the present study, we used a unique chemoselective photoaffinity labeling strategy, the methionine proximity assay, to directly identify at physiological conditions a total of 38 discrete ligand/receptor contact residues that form the extracellular peptide-binding site of an activated GPCR, the angiotensin II type 1 receptor. This experimental data set was used in homology modeling to guide the positioning of the angiotensin II (AngII) peptide within several GPCR crystal structure templates. We found that the CXC chemokine receptor type 4 accommodated the results better than the other templates evaluated; ligand/receptor contact residues were spatially grouped into defined interaction clusters with AngII. In the resulting receptor structure, a β-hairpin fold in extracellular loop 2 in conjunction with two extracellular disulfide bridges appeared to open and shape the entrance of the ligand-binding site. The bound AngII adopted a somewhat vertical binding mode, allowing concomitant contacts across the extracellular surface and deep within the transmembrane domain core of the receptor. We propose that such a dualistic nature of GPCR interaction could be well suited for diffusible linear peptide ligands and a common feature of other peptidergic class A GPCRs."

https://openalex.org/W2094036652,"Sodium-coupled neurotransmitter transporters play a key role in neuronal signaling by clearing excess transmitter from the synapse. Structural data on a trimeric archaeal aspartate transporter, Glt(Ph), have provided valuable insights into structural features of human excitatory amino acid transporters. However, the time-resolved mechanisms of substrate binding and release, as well as that of coupling to sodium co-transport, remain largely unknown for this important family. We present here the results of the most extensive simulations performed to date for Glt(Ph) in both outward-facing and inward-facing states by taking advantage of significant advances made in recent years in molecular simulation technology. The generated multiple microsecond trajectories consistently show that the helical hairpin HP2, not HP1, serves as an intracellular gate (in addition to its extracellular gating role). In contrast to previous proposals, HP1 can neither initiate nor accommodate neurotransmitter release without prior opening of HP2 by at least 4.0 Å. Aspartate release invariably follows that of a sodium ion located near the HP2 gate entrance. Asp-394 on TM8 and Arg-276 on HP1 emerge as key residues that promote the reorientation and diffusion of substrate toward the cell interior. These findings underscore the significance of examining structural dynamics, as opposed to static structure(s), to make inferences on the mechanisms of transport and key interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2030786210,"Caspases are intracellular cysteine-class proteases with aspartate specificity that is critical for driving processes as diverse as the innate immune response and apoptosis, exemplified by caspase-1 and caspase-3, respectively. Interestingly, caspase-1 cleaves far fewer cellular substrates than caspase-3 and also shows strong positive cooperativity between the two active sites of the homodimer, unlike caspase-3. Biophysical and kinetic studies here present a molecular basis for this difference. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments show that mature caspase-1 exists predominantly as a monomer under physiological concentrations that undergoes dimerization in the presence of substrate; specifically, substrate binding shifts the KD for dimerization by 20-fold. We have created a hemi-active site-labeled dimer of caspase-1, where one site is blocked with the covalent active site inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone. This hemi-labeled enzyme is about 9-fold more active than the apo-dimer of caspase-1. These studies suggest that substrate not only drives dimerization but also, once bound to one site in the dimer, promotes an active conformation in the other monomer. Steady-state kinetic analysis and modeling independently support this model, where binding of one substrate molecule not only increases substrate binding in preformed dimers but also drives the formation of heterodimers. Thus, the cooperativity in caspase-1 is driven both by substrate-induced dimerization as well as substrate-induced activation. Substrate-induced dimerization and activation seen in caspase-1 and not in caspase-3 may reflect their biological roles. Whereas caspase-1 cleaves a dramatically smaller number of cellular substrates that need to be concentrated near inflammasomes, caspase-3 is a constitutively active dimer that cleaves many more substrates located diffusely throughout the cell."

Here, we report a proteasome-independent mechanism by which bortezomib induces autophagy in HCC. Our data indicate that bortezomib activated autophagy in a dose- and time- dependent manner in HCC cell lines including Huh-7, Sk-Hep1, and Hep3B. Bortezomib downregulated CIP2A, phospho-Akt (P-Akt) and phospho-4EBP1 (P-4EBP1) in a dose- and time-dependent manner in all tested HCC cells. Ectopic expression of CIP2A abolished the effect of bortezomib on autophagy. Co-treatment of bortezomib and calyculin A, a PP2A inhibitor, reduced the effect of bortezomib on P-Akt, P-4EBP1, and autophagy. Increased phosphorylation of either Akt or 4EBP1 by ectopic overexpression protected cells from bortezomib-induced autophagy. Furthermore, we examined the effect of ΔBtz, a bortezomib derivative that closely resembles bortezomib structurally but has no proteasome activity, in HCC. Interestingly, ΔBtz demonstrated similar effects to bortezomib on autophagy, CIP2A, P-Akt and P-4EBP1, suggesting that the effect of bortezomib on autophagy is independent of proteasome inhibition. Moreover, our in vivo data showed that both bortezomib and ΔBtz inhibited tumor growth, downregulated CIP2A, P-Akt and induced autophagy in Huh-7 tumors. In conclusion, bortezomib induces autophagy in HCC through a CIP2A-PP2A-Akt-4EBP1 pathway."

A single point mutation of HSPB8, such as K141N, can cause cardiac disease.

B8 (also known as HSP22, H11 kinase, or αC-crystallin) is assigned to the small HSP family that also includes HSP20 (HSPB6), HSPB2, HSPB3, HSPB4 (αA-crystallin (CryAA)), HSPB5 (αB-crystallin (CryAB)), and HSP27 (HSPB1) (1Taylor R.P.

MacRae T.H. Small heat shock proteins. Molecular structure and chaperone function.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2460-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The small HSPs share sequence similarity within the α-crystallin domain but exhibit different patterns of gene expression, transcriptional regulation, and subcellular localization (1Taylor R.P.

The chaperone-like activity of the small HSPs, which are grouped together based on their ability to prevent protein aggregation and/or restore the biological activity of cell substrates, is widely believed to be a protective mechanism against protein misfolding and denaturation triggered by noxious environmental stimuli such as hyperthermic stress, heavy metals, ischemic injury, and some genetic diseases (1Taylor R.P.

Missense mutations in small HSPs, such as CryAA and CryAB, can cause dominant disease, such as cataracts and myofibrillar myopathy (1Taylor R.P. Benjamin I.J. Small heat shock proteins.

These diseases, characterized by the formation of aggregates, are misfolded protein-related diseases that can be recapitulated in transgenic (TG) mice, for example, by the presence of a mutant HSP protein in the lens of the eye or in cardiomyocytes (5Sanbe A.

Similar to the effect of missense mutations of CryAA and CryAB, a missense mutation of HSPB8 such as K141N or K141E causes autosomal dominant distal hereditary motor neuropathy (HMN) type II in some European families, which is characterized by the formation of inclusion bodies in cells (7Irobi J. Van Impe K. Seeman P. Jordanova A. Dierick I. Verpoorten N. Michalik A. De Vriendt E. Jacobs A. Van Gerwen V. Vennekens K. Mazanec R. Tournev I. Hilton-Jones D. Talbot K. Kremensky I.

Genet. 2004; 36: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In another study, HSPB8 K141N was also shown to cause axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease type 2L in a large Chinese family (8Tang B.S. Zhao G.H. Luo W. Xia K. Cai F. Pan Q. Zhang R.X.

Genet. 2005; 116: 222-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The K141N mutation affects a highly conserved residue in the central α-crystallin domain of the protein. Overexpression of the HSPB8 K141N protein in COS cells increased the interaction of HSPB8 and HSPB1, leading to the formation of intracellular aggregates (7Irobi J. Van Impe K. Seeman P. Jordanova A. Dierick I. Verpoorten N. Michalik A. De Vriendt E. Jacobs A. Van Gerwen V. Vennekens K. Mazanec R. Tournev I. Hilton-Jones D. Talbot K. Kremensky I. Van Den Bosch L. Robberecht W.

A recent study reported that an HSPB8 gene KO mouse showed normal development and no obvious abnormalities in tissue function, but cardiac dysfunction and remodeling, as well as transition into heart failure, were accelerated by pressure-induced overload to the heart (9Qiu H. Lizano P. Laure L. Sui X. Rashed E. Park J.Y. Hong C. Gao S. Holle E. Morin D. Dhar S.K. Wagner T. Berdeaux A. Tian B. Vatner S.F. Depre C.

These results suggest that the overexpression of mutant HSPB8 can lead to the induction of some degree of cellular toxicity in cultured cells, although no similar phenotype was detected in the HSPB8 knock-out mouse. Thus, it is unclear whether a missense mutation of HSPB8 alone can cause neurodegenerative diseases such as HMN and CMT disease because of loss of function, particularly in vivo. Furthermore, it is known that the HSPB8 expression pattern is ubiquitous, with the highest expression in muscle tissue (10Kappé G. Verschuure P. Philipsen R.L. Staalduinen A.A. Van de Boogaart P. Boelens W.C. De Jong W.W. Characterization of two novel human small heat shock proteins. Protein kinase-related HspB8 and testis-specific HspB9.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1520: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This implies that mutant HSPB8 protein can be present in muscle tissue, such as the heart, and can affect cardiac function as well as neuronal tissues. To study the structure-function relationship of a single missense mutation of HSPB8 in vivo, cardiac-specific TG mice expressing HSPB8 K141N as well as wild-type HSPB8 TG mice as controls were generated using tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activator (tTA) and the attenuated myosin heavy chain system (11Sanbe A. Gulick J. Hanks M.C. Liang Q. Osinska H. Robbins J. Reengineering inducible cardiac-specific transgenesis with an attenuated myosin heavy chain promoter.Circ.

Protective effect of geranylgeranylacetone via enhancement of HSPB8 induction in desmin-related cardiomyopathy.PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5351Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The phenotype of HSPB8 K141N TG mice is an accumulation of aggregates containing HSPB8, causing slightly impaired cardiac function, mild ventricular hypertrophy, and apical cardiac fibrosis with cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction at approximately 6 months of age. Our results indicate that mutant HSPB8 TG mice have a cardiomyopathy phenotype, whereas no abnormality was observed in wild-type HSPB8 TG mice. Thus, our data suggest that the HSPB8 mutation can act in a dominant negative manner and that the cellular toxicity of the mutant protein may play an important role in disease development. Our results imply that the HSPB8 mutation can cause cardiomyopathy as well as neuronal degenerative diseases such as HMN and CMT disease and that a phenotype induced by the mutant HSPB8 may result from the mild toxicity of the mutated HSPB8 protein. cDNAs of HSPB8 and CryAB were isolated by reverse transcription-PCR and used to generate recombinant protein and adenoviral constructs as described previously (13Sanbe A.

The missense mutations HSPB8 K141N and CryAB R120G were introduced using reverse transcription-PCR and subcloned into the pBSKII vector (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). To distinguish the transgenic products from endogenous protein, a FLAG epitope was introduced at the N terminus of CryAB R120G. An HA epitope was introduced at the N terminus of HSPB8 as described previously (12Sanbe A. Daicho T. Mizutani R. Endo T. Miyauchi N. Yamauchi J. Tanonaka K. Glabe C. Tanoue A.

The cellular toxicity of the recombinant HSPB8, HSPB8 K141N, CryAB, and CryAB R120G protein in HEK293T cells as well as cardiomyocytes was determined using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Recombinant proteins were added to give a final concentration of 0.4 mg/ml in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for 12 h.

Whole body cryotherapy, a relatively new form of cold therapy, consists of short whole-body exposure to extremely cold air (−110°C to −140°C). Cryostimulation is gaining wider acceptance as an effective part of physical therapy to accelerate muscle recovery in rugby players. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of repeated cryostimulation sessions on the hematological profile and martial status markers in professional rugby players. Twenty-seven professional rugby players received 2 daily cryostimulation treatments for 7 consecutive days. Blood samples were collected before and after administration of the cryotherapic protocol and hematological profiles were obtained. No changes in the leukocyte count or composition were seen. There was a decrease in the values for erythrocytes, hematocrit, hemoglobin and mean corpuscular hemoglobin content, and an increase in mean corpuscular volume and red cell distribution width. Platelet count and mean volume remained unchanged. Serum transferrin and ferritin decreased, while soluble transferrin receptor increased. Serum iron and transferrin saturation were unchanged, as was reticulocyte count, whereas the immature reticulocyte fraction decreased substantially. In conclusion, in this sample of professional rugby players, cryostimulation modified the hematological profile, with a reduction in erythrocyte count and hemoglobinization paralleled by a change in martial status markers."

Aberrant growth promotion occurs because of the inactivation of tumor suppressors and activation of oncogenes. Classical tumor suppressors such as p53, pRB, and PTEN are frequently mutated in many human tumors. The Hanahan-Weinberg model (1Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Hallmarks of cancer. The next generation.Cell. 2011; 144: 646-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42748) Google Scholar) suggests that at least 10 different genetic and physiologic alterations occur in a mammalian cell before reaching the full-blown malignant state. These include resistance to apoptosis, enhanced motility, development of neovasculature, activation of tumor-proliferating inflammation, and loss of anti-tumor immunity. Several of these processes are dependent on cytokines and/or other secretory factors. The interferon (IFN) family of cytokines is a critical player in promoting host defenses against pathogens and neoplastic cells (2Kalvakolanu D.V. The GRIMs. A new interface between cell death regulation and interferon/retinoid induced growth suppression.Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2004; 15: 169-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Unlike many other cytokines, which primarily attack the tumor through activation of immune cells, IFNs not only activate direct growth-suppressive gene expression in the tumor cells but also activate immune cells (3Dunn G.P. Koebel C.M. Schreiber R.D. Interferons, immunity, and cancer immunoediting.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 836-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Their direct anti-tumor effects include the inhibition of cell cycle and activation of apoptosis. A number of tumor suppressor genes such as STAT1 (4Chan S.R. Vermi W. Luo J. Lucini L. Rickert C.

Kimchi A. DAPk protein family and cancer.Autophagy. 2006; 2: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) were discovered originally as critical players in IFN action. That endogenous IFNs act as sentinels against tumors (9Gresser I. Belardelli F. Endogenous type I interferons as a defense against tumors.Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2002; 13: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), many cell types are capable of producing and responding to IFNs; and the fact that most of the above proteins are transcription factors it is likely that we have not fully uncovered the tumor-suppressive gene spectrum controlled by these cytokines. In addition, we and others have shown that IFN in association with other biological response modifiers, such as retinoic acid, exhibit potent tumor suppression in several clinical and preclinical models (2Kalvakolanu D.V. The GRIMs. A new interface between cell death regulation and interferon/retinoid induced growth suppression.Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2004; 15: 169-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To investigate the underlying mechanisms of tumor growth suppression, we employed a genome-wide knockdown strategy and identified few potent growth suppressors. One such growth inhibitor was GRIM-19, a novel protein whose depletion promoted and overexpression suppressed tumor growth (10Alchanati I. Nallar S.C. Sun P. Gao L. Hu J. Stein A. Yakirevich E. Konforty D. Alroy I. Zhao X. Reddy S.P. Resnick M.B. Kalvakolanu D.V.

Chem. 2000; 275: 33416-33426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). GRIM-19 targets STAT3 to inhibition via a direct interaction (12Zhang J. Yang J. Roy S.K. Tininini S. Hu J. Bromberg J.F. Poli V. Stark G.R. Kalvakolanu D.V. The cell death regulator GRIM-19 is an inhibitor of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

GRIM-19, a death-regulatory gene product, suppresses Stat3 activity via functional interaction.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1325-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). STAT3 was originally identified as a cytokine-inducible transcription factor whose activity was critical for embryonic development and differentiation (14Stark G.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. The JAK-STAT pathway at twenty.Immunity. 2012; 36: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). In normal resting cells, STAT3 is transiently activated via tyrosyl phosphorylation by the JAK family of protein-tyrosine kinases upon specific ligand-receptor engagement, which causes STAT3 homo-dimerization, nuclear migration, and transcriptional induction of target genes (14Stark G.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. The JAK-STAT pathway at twenty.Immunity. 2012; 36: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Excessive STAT3 phosphorylation is prevented by cessation of JAK activity and nuclear export of active STAT3 (14Stark G.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. The JAK-STAT pathway at twenty.Immunity. 2012; 36: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). In contrast, STAT3 is highly active and is primarily found in the nucleus of a number of human tumors. Consistent with these observations, an experimentally generated spontaneously dimerizing STAT3 transforms cells to an oncogenic state (15Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stat3 as an oncogene.Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). STAT3 meets at least 5 of the 10 criteria of the Hanahan-Weinberg model of tumorigenesis such as promotion of proliferation and neoangiogenesis, resistance to apoptosis, evasion of immune response, and development of tumor-promoting inflammatory response (16Yu H. Pardoll D. Jove R. STATs in cancer inflammation and immunity. A leading role for STAT3.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 798-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar). Although STAT3 tyrosyl phosphorylation is one important step in growth promotion, mechanisms that deregulate STAT3 activity are far from clear, as mutations in STAT3 are not reported in human tumors to date. Therefore, we hypothesized that inactivation of STAT3 inhibitors is an important event in promoting tumor growth. Earlier we showed that expression of GRIM-19 is suppressed in a number of primary renal cell carcinomas (10Alchanati I. Nallar S.C. Sun P. Gao L. Hu J. Stein A. Yakirevich E. Konforty D. Alroy I. Zhao X. Reddy S.P. Resnick M.B. Kalvakolanu D.V. A proteomic analysis reveals the loss of expression of the cell death regulatory gene GRIM-19 in human renal cell carcinomas.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7138-7147Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Whether GRIM-19 mutations occur in human tumors is unclear at this stage. Here we show that the GRIM-19 gene is mutated in primary human head and neck cancers. We also show that the tumor-derived mutants fail to counteract the growth-promoting effects of STAT3 and are ineffective at suppressing metastasis due to their weak binding to STAT3. These studies not only show a new way tumor cells lose control over STAT3 but also highlight the importance of GRIM-19 mutations in tumor development. Antibodies specific for FLAG (Sigma) and Myc (Cell signaling technology) epitopes, actin (Sigma), and cyclin D1, Bcl2, and MMP-9 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used in these studies. Alexa fluor 700-coupled anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa fluor 750-coupled anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) were used to capture specific signals using the Odyssey Infrared system (LI-COR), and band intensities were quantified using the manufacturer's software. Tumors were collected with informed consent of the patients undergoing surgical excision at the Cleveland Clinic under an institutionally approved protocol. Adjacent normal tissue was used as a control in each case. Samples were snap-frozen in liquid N2 and then stored at −80 °C until use. Total RNA and genomic DNA were isolated from these samples using a commercially available Allprep DNA/RNA/Protein mini kit (Qiagen, Inc.). Total RNA was converted to cDNA using SuperScript® III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and used templates for qualitative and quantitative PCR using gene-specific primers (supplemental Table S1). GRIM-19 ORF from tumor and normal tissue was PCR-amplified and sequenced at the Biopolymer/Genomics core facility, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD. Base changes, if any, were verified using matched genomic DNA as the background. The presence or absence of such base changes in the matched normal tissue was used to score changes as germ line or somatic origin, respectively. A FLAG-tagged spontaneously dimerizing STAT3 variant (S3C) has been described (15Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stat3 as an oncogene.Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar), and transfected cells were selected with G418. Tumor-derived GRIM-19 mutant ORFs were expressed as C-terminal myc-tagged protein using the pLVX-Puro expression vector (Clontech, Inc). Preparation of lentiviral particles were as per our earlier reports. Briefly, medium from the cultures were collected for 3 consecutive days, pooled, passed through a 0.45-μm filter, and used to transduce target cell lines. 3Y1, a non-oncogenic rat fibroblast cell line (JCRB0734, Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources, Osaka, Japan) (17Kimura G. Itagaki A. Summers J. Rat cell line 3y1 and its virogenic polyoma- and sv40- transformed derivatives.Int. J. Cancer. 1975; 15: 694-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), was grown in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. This cell has two point mutations (K130T and A136T) in one of the p53 alleles (18Ushijima T. Makino H. Nakayasu M. Aonuma S. Takeuchi M. Segawa K. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Presence of p53 mutations in 3Y1-B clone 1–6. A rat cell line widely used as a normal immortalized fibroblast.Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1994; 85: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These mutations do not belong to the category of “hotspot mutations” observed in human tumors that destroy its DNA binding capacity (19Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Surfing the p53 network.Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5798) Google Scholar). HaCaT (non-oncogenic keratinocytes) was grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. HSC3 cells (human oral squamous carcinoma cell line) was grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS; this cell line harbors mutant the p53 allele(s). PC3 cells (prostate cancer cell line) were grown in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, glutamine, and sodium pyruvate. Cells were electroporated with the S3C expression plasmid using the Nucleofector® technology (Amaxa, Inc.). After transfection with the genes of interest, cells were selected with G418 (1500 μg/ml) for 10–12 days. Drug-resistant colony pools (n > 50) were expanded to avoid a clonal bias and transduced with lentiviral GRIM-19 and selected with puromycin. Expression-positive population was used in all experiments. A lentiviral luciferase reporter (pCCL-c-MNDU3c-Luc) (20Wang X. Rosol M. Ge S. Peterson D. McNamara G. Pollack H. Kohn D.B.

Dynamic tracking of human hematopoietic stem cell engraftment using in vivo bioluminescence imaging.Blood. 2003; 102: 3478-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) was used to transduce cells and monitor metastasis in real time. Total RNA (5 μg) was reverse-transcribed using a commercially available ImProm-II enzyme (Promega). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using JumpStart SYBR Green master mix (Sigma) on Stratagene Mx3005P real-time PCR machine. Input cDNA was 10 ng per reaction, and relative transcript abundance was calculated using RPL32 as the internal control by the ΔΔCt method. For all cell line-based experiments, three separate batches of RNA (n = 3) were employed for a sample. Multiple technical replicates per sample were used for calculating transcript levels, and the statistical significance of differences between various groups was assessed using Student's t test. These were performed as described in our previous publications (21Kalakonda S. Nallar S.C. Lindner D.J. Hu J. Reddy S.P. Kalvakolanu D.V. Tumor-suppressive activity of the cell death activator GRIM-19 on a constitutively active signal transducer and activator of transcription 3.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 6212-6220Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses were performed as described earlier (21Kalakonda S. Nallar S.C. Lindner D.J. Hu J. Reddy S.P. Kalvakolanu D.V. Tumor-suppressive activity of the cell death activator GRIM-19 on a constitutively active signal transducer and activator of transcription 3.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 6212-6220Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Three- to four-week-old athymic nude (nu/nu) NCr mice (Taconic) were used for these studies as described earlier (22Lindner D.J. Borden E.C. Kalvakolanu D.V. Synergistic antitumor effects of a combination of interferons and retinoic acid on human tumor cells in vitroin vivo.Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 931-937PubMed Google Scholar). Procedures involving animals were conducted in conformity with an institutionally approved protocol compliant with United States National Institutes of Health policies. Each experimental group contained 10 mice, with 1 tumor injection site per mouse. Cells (1 × 106) were inoculated into flanks, and tumor development was monitored for several weeks. Every week, tumor volume was calculated using caliper measurements and the formula V = (4/3)πa2b, where 2a = minor axis, and 2b = major axis of prolate spheroid. Student's two-tailed t test was used to assess the statistical significance of difference between pairs of means of tumor volume. For metastasis experiments, after laparotomy, 5 × 105 PC3 cells in 10 μl were inoculated into the ventral lobe of the prostate gland using a 27-gauge needle. These cells also carried a stably integrated firefly luciferase gene, which permits live imaging. Animals were monitored for metastasis after 45 days using the Xenogen IVS100 live imaging system. Mice were anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane and administered 3 mg of luciferin intraperitoneally 5 min before imaging. Image acquisition settings were: Bin 8, FOV25, f1, 30-s exposure, background subtracted, flat-fielded, cosmic. Data obtained with each mutant were subjected to Student's t test with respect to wild-type GRIM-19. Effects of wild-type GRIM-19 on S3C were compared with corresponding data from S3C/EV cells. A p value <0.05 was considered significant in all experiments. We recently obtained several primary human oral squamous cell carcinomas (n = 12) and adjacent normal tissues from patients who were tobacco chewers. Total RNA and genomic DNA were isolated from pathologist-certified surgically isolated tumors and the adjacent normal tissues. RT-PCR analysis showed GRIM-19 mRNA levels in some of these tumors was lower compared with their matched normal tissue, whereas there was no significant difference in others. Three of these tumors (from different patients and arbitrarily named as sample IDs 1, 2, and 3) selected for this study had higher GRIM-19 than their normal counterparts (Fig. 1A, top blot). Based on our previous studies that showed a loss of GRIM-19 correlates with elevated STAT3 levels in clear cell renal cell carcinomas (10Alchanati I. Nallar S.C. Sun P. Gao L. Hu J. Stein A. Yakirevich E. Konforty D. Alroy I. Zhao X. Reddy S.P. Resnick M.B. Kalvakolanu D.V. A proteomic analysis reveals the loss of expression of the cell death regulatory gene GRIM-19 in human renal cell carcinomas.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7138-7147Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we expected lower STAT3 mRNA levels in these tumors compared with their control. Contrary to this notion, STAT3 mRNA levels were very high compared with their matched normal tissue (Fig. 1A, middle blot). Real-time PCR analysis (Fig. 1B) of two STAT3-regulated genes, BCL2-L1 (BCL-XL) and CCND1 (cyclin D1), showed increased expression, which was consistent with elevated STAT3 levels. Based on this confounding observation that high GRIM-19 levels in a tumor corresponded to an increased STAT3 activity, we hypothesized that the GRIM-19 in these tumors may have suffered mutation and consequently lost its anti-STAT3 activity. Therefore, we sequenced the GRIM-19 cDNA and genomic DNA from the selected tumors and their matched normal tissues. These studies identified three separate point mutations in the tumor GRIM-19 gene but not in those of normal cells (supplemental Fig. S1). Because these mutations were absent in the matching normal tissues, they truly appear to be tumor-derived and somatic in nature. Each mutation was identified from a tumor derived from one patient. Within the given tumor, the mutant GRIM-19 ORF appears to be the dominant form. No other mutations were observed in the same tumor. These mutations resulted in the following amino acid substitutions in the coding region: L71P (Fig. 1 sample ID 2), L91P (Fig. 1 sample ID 1), and A95T (Fig. 1 sample ID 3). Because the available patient sample size is smaller, we could not determine the frequency of their occurrence at this time. We first determined if the GRIM-19 mutants had an effect on the growth of non-oncogenic cells. We infected 3Y1, a non-oncogenic rodent fibroblast cell line, with lentiviral particles expressing wild-type GRIM-19 and the tumor-derived mutants, and stable cell lines were isolated by selecting with puromycin. The growth profiles of cells expressing mutants were compared with those expressing wild-type GRIM-19 (supplemental Fig. S2). The mutants did not significantly stimulate cell growth compared with wild-type GRIM-19, except for A95T, which seemed to slow down cell growth slightly. Thus, mutants seem not to differ significantly from wild-type GRIM-19 in terms of their effects on normal cell growth. Because GRIM-19 is an inhibitor of STAT3, we next determined the impact of these mutations on STAT3-induced cell growth. A constitutively active form of STAT3 (S3C) was stably transfected into 3Y1 cells, which is known to cause oncogenic transformation. Because S3C is the only oncogenic product under these conditions, the anti-STAT3 effects of GRIM-19 and its mutants can be readily discerned using this model. Stable cell pools expressing S3C were generated after selecting cells with G418 followed by GRIM-19 transduction via lentiviral particles and selection with puromycin. First, we wanted to ascertain whether the mutants differ from wild-type GRIM-19 in regulating cell growth in the presence of the S3C oncogene. S3C alone stimulated cell growth, which was strongly suppressed by wild-type GRIM-19 (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2A). In contrast, all three mutants significantly lost their ability to suppress S3C-induced growth compared with wild-type GRIM-19 under the same conditions. These differences in growth characteristics are not due to differences in expression levels of the proteins (Fig. 2B). Because growth stimulation occurred in the presence of GRIM-19 mutants, we next determined their effects on oncogenic phenotype using two models. In the first model, 3Y1 cells expressing S3C alone or in combination with GRIM-19 mutants were used for anchorage-independent growth on soft agar media. As expected, S3C-expressing cells formed a large number of soft-agar colonies, unlike the empty vector or GRIM-19 singly transfected cells (Fig. 3A). S3C-dependent soft agar colony formation was robustly suppressed by GRIM-19. We then quantified and compared the differences between wild-type and mutant GRIM-19 to measure their impact on S3C-induced transformation (Fig. 3B). The mutants, L71P, L91P, and A95T significantly lost (p < 0.001, <0.008, and <0.0001, respectively) their ability to suppress S3C-induced transformation compared with wild type. The mutants alone did not have any transforming effect in these cells. In a second model, we employed a human oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line, HSC3, which expresses a very low level of GRIM-19 (23Nallar S.C. Kalakonda S. Sun P. Ohmori Y. Hiroi M. Mori K. Lindner D.J. Kalvakolanu D.V. Identification of a structural motif in the tumor-suppressive protein GRIM-19 required for its antitumor activity.Am. J. Pathol. 2010; 177: 896-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and high basal STAT3 activity, to determine the impact of mutants on colony formation. We noted similar effects of GRIM-19 mutants on colony formation in HSC3 cells (Fig. 3C). However, A95T mutant was least inhibitory in 3Y1 cells, whereas the same mutant was strongest in HSC3 cells. The expression of mutants is shown in Fig. 3D. The A95T mutant had a lower expression than the wild-type protein in these cells. Overall, in S3C-transformed rat fibroblasts and human oral squamous carcinomas cells, GRIM-19 mutants were significantly weaker than the wild type at suppressing transformed phenotype. One of the major phenotypes of transformed cells is the acquisition of rapid motility. In the next experiments we examined the effects of GRIM-19 on S3C-dependent cell motility. Because HSC3 cells may have more than one genetic alteration that contributes to its transformed phenotype, it is difficult to precisely say whether all oncogenic effects are STAT3-driven. Therefore, we employed 3Y1 and HaCaT (a non-oncogenic keratinocyte) cells to study the impact of GRIM-19 mutants on S3C-dependent motility. In the initial assays, we employed 3Y1 cells expressing S3C in the presence or absence of GRIM-19 mutants. A confluent monolayer of each of these cell lines was scratched with a sterile pipette tip, and cell motility into the denuded area was monitored over time. As shown in Fig. 4A, very few cells moved into the denuded area in empty vector (EV) 2The abbreviations used are: EVempty vectorIPimmunoprecipitationU-STAT3un(tyrosyl)-phosphorylated STAT3. -transfected cells. Several S3C-expressing cells migrated into the denuded area within 4 h. Wild-type GRIM-19 blunted S3C-induced motility. In contrast to the wild type, the L71P, L91P, and A95T mutants significantly lost their capacity to block S3C-induced motility, as evidenced by migration of cells into the denuded area. Fig. 4B shows quantified data from a number of plates (n = 6; three replicates per experiment). HaCaT cells were stably transfected with a modified S3C expression vector. The original pRc/CMV-S3C with BGH-poly(A) signals did not express in keratinocytes; hence, we replaced this sequence with a poly(A) signal sequence from KRT-14. After establishing stable cell lines that expressed S3C (Fig. 4C), they were infected with lentiviral particles coding for wild-type or mutant versions of GRIM-19. In HaCaT cells, L71P mutant expressed to a lower extent than wild type or L91P, whereas A95T mutant expressed very weakly. empty vector immunoprecipitation un(tyrosyl)-phosphorylated STAT3. In the next set of experiments migration was scored using Transwell® migration assays. 3Y1 and HaCaT cells expressing the indicated gene products were employed for this study (Fig. 4D). Relative to S3C-expressing cells, fewer GRIM-19-expressing cells moved into the lower chamber. In contrast, significantly higher numbers of mutant-expressing cells migrated into the lower chambers in both cell types. More importantly, both these appear to be resulting from a failure to antagonize S3C. Lastly, we investigated the impact of these mutants on IL-6-induced cell migration using HSC3 cells expressing GRIM-19 mutants in Transwell® chambers (Fig. 4E) given recent reports that IL-6 is a potential growth factor for many tumors (24Hong D.S. Angelo L.S. Kurzrock R. Interleukin-6 and its receptor in cancer. Implications for translational therapeutics.Cancer. 2007; 110: 1911-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). IL-6-stimulated cell migration was high in the EV transfectants, which was strongly suppressed by wild-type GRIM-19 (p < 0.0001). The mutants when compared with wild-type GRIM-19 significantly (p < 0.002) lost the capacity to block IL-6-induced migration. To determine the effects of GRIM-19 mutants on tumor growth, we subcutaneously transplanted HSC3 and PC3 cells expressing these mutants into athymic nude mice (Figs. 5, A and B). We showed earlier that these cells express an extremely reduced level of endogenous GRIM-19 and high STAT3 activity (23Nallar S.C. Kalakonda S. Sun P. Ohmori Y. Hiroi M. Mori K. Lindner D.J.

Hence, the effects of mutants on cell growth can be readily distinguished in these cells. HSC3 cells formed relatively smaller-sized tumors unlike PC3 cells. Nonetheless, in both cell types wild-type GRIM-19 suppressed tumor formation robustly (p < 0.001), whereas the mutants (L71P, L91P, and A95T) were relatively weaker (p < 0.01) at suppressing tumor growth. Among these, L71P and L91P were the weakest growth suppressors. Relative to these mutants, A95T retained a significantly higher growth inhibitory capacity (p < 0.05). Thus, patient-derived mutant GRIM-19 proteins failed to suppress tumor growth. The above experiments did not unequivocally prove whether the anti-tumor effects"

In addition to several proteins identified, microRNAs also play a critical role in the process. In this study, we identified microRNA-140 (miR-140) as a direct downstream component of the BMP4 signaling pathway during the commitment of C3H10T1/2 cells to adipocyte lineage. Overexpression of miR-140 in C3H10T1/2 cells promoted commitment, whereas knockdown of its expression led to impairment. Additional studies indicated that Ostm1 is a bona fide target of miR-140, which is significantly decreased during commitment, and Ostm1 was also demonstrated to function as an anti-adipogenic factor."

https://openalex.org/W2098133447,"Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato is the causative agent of Lyme disease. Recent studies have shown that recognition of the spirochete is mediated by TLR2 and NOD2. The latter receptor has been associated with the induction of the intracellular degradation process called autophagy. The present study demonstrated for the first time the induction of autophagy by exposure to B. burgdorferi and that autophagy modulates the B. burgdorferi-dependent cytokine production. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells treated with autophagy inhibitors showed an increased IL-1β and IL-6 production in response to the exposure of the spirochete, whereas TNFα production was unchanged. Autophagy induction against B. burgdorferi was dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS) because cells from patients with chronic granulomatous disease, which are defective in ROS production, also produced elevated IL-1β. Further, the enhanced production of the proinflammatory cytokines was because of the elevated mRNA expression in the absence of autophagy. Our results thus demonstrate the induction of autophagy, which, in turn, modulates cytokine production by B. burgdorferi for the first time."
https://openalex.org/W2048998123,"Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the major pathway for recycling of granule membrane components after strong stimulation and high exocytotic rates. It resembles ""classical"" receptor-mediated endocytosis but has a trigger that is unique to secretion, the sudden appearance of the secretory granule membrane in the plasma membrane. The spatial localization, the relationship to individual fusion events, the nature of the cargo, and the timing and nature of the nucleation events are unknown. Furthermore, a size mismatch between chromaffin granules (∼300-nm diameter) and typical clathrin-coated vesicles (∼90 nm) makes it unlikely that clathrin-mediated endocytosis internalizes as a unit the entire fused granule membrane. We have used a combination of total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy of transiently expressed proteins and time-resolved quantitative confocal imaging of endogenous proteins along with a fluid-phase marker to address these issues. We demonstrate that the fused granule membrane remains a distinct entity and serves as a nucleation site for clathrin- and dynamin-mediated endocytosis that internalizes granule membrane components in small increments."

Ral GTPases mediate their biological effects by cycling between a GDP-bound inactive conformation and GTP-bound active conformation in which they engage downstream effector proteins that regulate various cellular processes. Ral GTPases are largely found in an inactive state in cells. However, extracellular stimuli can signal for activation of these proteins. Ral is directly activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 2The abbreviations used are: GEFguanine nucleotide exchange factorGAPGTPase-activating proteinRGCRalGAP complexGDSGDP dissociation stimulatorTSCtuberous sclerosis complexDIGdigoxigeninpASphospho-Akt substrateDNdominant-negative. that bind to the inactive GTPase and catalyze the release of GDP so that GTP, which is ∼10 times more abundant in cells than GDP (10Traut T.W.

Two families of RalGEFs have been identified in mammalian cells. The RalGDS family contains four members (RalGDS, Rgl, Rlf/Rgl2, and Rgl3) that share sequence homology and a similar domain structure (11Ferro E. Trabalzini L. RalGDS family members couple Ras to Ral signalling and that's not all.Cell. Signal. 2010; 22: 1804-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These proteins are bona fide Ras effectors that bind to active Ras GTPases through a C-terminal Ras binding domain, thus recruiting RalGEFs to membranes where they can then activate Ral GTPases (12Matsubara K.

The RalGAP complex (RGC) consists of two proteins: a catalytic subunit (RGC2) that contains a C-terminal GAP domain with specificity for RalA and RalB and a regulatory subunit (RGC1) that stabilizes the GAP. A second RalGAP, GARNL1, shares high sequence homology with RGC2 and can also form a catalytically active complex with RGC1 (20Chen X.W. Leto D. Xiong T. Yu G. Cheng A. Decker S. Saltiel A.R.

These novel RalGAPs are only beginning to be studied, and the functional differences between RGC2 and GARNL1 are currently unknown. However, these two proteins are expressed differentially in cell and tissue types 3D. Leto, M. Uhm, A. Williams, and A. R. Saltiel, unpublished observation. , suggesting that they may serve specialized roles. We reported previously that the RGC is negatively regulated by Akt-catalyzed phosphorylation of RGC2 on multiple serine/threonine residues (20Chen X.W. Leto D. Xiong T. Yu G. Cheng A. Decker S. Saltiel A.R. A Ral GAP complex links PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling to RalA activation in insulin action.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2011; 22: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the RGC by phosphorylation allows for an insulin-stimulated increase in RalA activity in adipocytes, where this small GTPase plays a critical role in Glut4 exocytosis and glucose uptake (7Chen X.W. Leto D. Chiang S.H. Wang Q. Saltiel A.R. Activation of RalA is required for insulin-stimulated Glut4 trafficking to the plasma membrane via the exocyst and the motor protein Myo1c.Dev.

Thus, in this system, the RGC serves as an important regulatory point for modulation of RalA activity. Although GEFs are generally thought to serve as the primary drivers of small GTPase activation, there are multiple examples in which a GAP, either alone or in conjunction with a GEF, plays a role in activation (22Csépányi-Kömi R. Lévay M. Ligeti E. Small G proteins and their regulators in cellular signalling.Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2012; 353: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Of note, this seems to be the case for the small GTPase Rheb, which is activated by hormone signaling through inhibition of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a GAP complex that has a striking similarity to the RGC (21Shirakawa R.

Thus, at least in some cases, relieving negative regulation by a GAP appears to be necessary for the activation of the target small GTPase. Phosphorylation-induced inhibition of GAPs can occur through direct inactivation of catalytic activity or through indirect mechanisms, such as altering the interactions of the GAP with other proteins, stability, or localization (22Csépányi-Kömi R.

Cells were pretreated with 100 nm wortmannin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h or 1 μm Akti-1/2 (Calbiochem) for 2 h before addition of insulin (Sigma-Aldrich). Lentiviral constructs encoding a shRNA control sequence (Open Biosystems) or a shRNA sequence that targets RGC1 (Open Biosystems, clone identification no. V2LHS_32227) were obtained from the University of Michigan Vector Core Facility. 293T cells were transfected with shRNA constructs as described above. 48 h after transfection, cells stably expressing the shRNA were selected by culturing in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 μg/ml puromycin. The medium was replaced every 3 days, and after 2 weeks the GFP-positive population of cells was collected by FACS (University of Michigan Flow Cytometry Core). Stably transfected cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.5 μg/ml puromycin. GST proteins were induced and purified as described previously (34Liu J. Wu J. Oliver C.

The elution was monitored by A280 readings, and fractions containing protein were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 4 liters of ice-cold PBS. The proteins were then concentrated using an Amicon centrifugal filtration unit (Millipore). Concentrated proteins were stored at −80 °C in PBS containing 10% glycerol and 10 mm DTT. Unless noted otherwise, the 14-3-3θ isoform was used for all experiments. For immunoprecipitations, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS before lysis in 1 ml of 14-3-3 immunoprecipitation buffer (IP buffer; 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% TX-100, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA) supplemented with an EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche). Lysates were cleared by centrifuging at 13,000 × g for 10 min and then incubated with 5 μg of antibody for 4 h at 4 °C. For the last 2 h, protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz) were added to precipitate the antibody. Beads were washed three times with IP buffer and then resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer. For 14-3-3 pull-downs, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and then lysed in 1 ml of 14-3-3 pull-down buffer (PD buffer; 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT) supplemented with an EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche). Lysates were cleared by centrifuging at 13,000 × g for 10 min and then incubated with 10 μg of GST or GST-14-3-3θ bound to glutathione beads (GE Healthcare) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. For samples treated with phosphatase, lysates were preincubated with 5000 units of λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs, Inc.) at 30 °C or 500 units of calf intestinal phosphatase (New England Biolabs, Inc.) at 37 °C for 1 h before adding GST-14-3-3 beads. Beads were washed three times with 1 ml of PD buffer and then resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer. RalA activation assays were performed as described previously (7Chen X.W. Leto D. Chiang S.H. Wang Q. Saltiel A.R. Activation of RalA is required for insulin-stimulated Glut4 trafficking to the plasma membrane via the exocyst and the motor protein Myo1c.Dev.

Membranes were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies (Pierce) before reacting with ECL Western blotting substrate (Pierce). Western blot analyses were quantified by densitometry using ImageJ. GST or GST-14-3-3θ was labeled with DIG by incubating 25 μg of protein with 30 μm digoxigenin-3-O-methylcarbonyl-ϵ-aminocaproic acid-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Roche) in 350 μl of PBS for 15 min at room temperature. The labeling reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Labeled protein was dialyzed against 1 liter of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) for 1 h at room temperature, then against 4 liters of PBS (pH 7.4) for 4 h at 4 °C, and finally against 4 liters of fresh PBS (pH 7.4) for 16 h at 4 °C. Labeled protein was then diluted in 25 ml of TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl) containing 2 mg/ml BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.01% sodium azide (Sigma-Aldrich). DIG-labeled proteins were stored at 4 °C. For overlay assays, the RGC was immunoprecipitated from 293T cells or 3T3-L1 adipocytes and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked at room temperature overnight in blocking buffer (5% skim milk in TBS-Tween). The membrane was incubated with DIG-labeled proteins for at least 4 h at 4 °C and then washed three times with TBS-T. The membrane was incubated with blocking buffer containing anti-DIG HRP antibody (1:10,000, Roche) for 2 h at room temperature and washed three times with TBS-T. Overlays were visualized by reacting with ECL Western blotting substrate (Pierce). 293T cells were lysed in 1 ml of PD buffer supplemented with 50 mm NaF, and overexpressed RGC was immunoprecipitated from cleared lysates using an anti-FLAG antibody conjugated to agarose beads. Beads were washed three times with 1 ml of PD buffer containing NaF and two times with 1 ml of PD buffer without NaF. The beads were incubated with or without 10 μg of GST-14-3-3θ for 1 h at 4 °C and then washed five times with 1 ml of PD buffer without NaF. The beads were then resuspended in 250 μl of PD buffer without NaF supplemented with 1 mm MnCl2. Beads were equilibrated to 30 °C, and then 800 units of λ-phosphatase was added to each sample. To stop the reaction, 50 μl of the reaction was removed at the indicated time points and placed into a chilled Eppendorf tube containing 5× SDS sample buffer. The protocols used for GAP assays and kinase assays were described previously (20Chen X.W. Leto D. Xiong T. Yu G. Cheng A. Decker S. Saltiel A.R.

For the GAP assay containing GST-14-3-3, RGC1/2 was prebound to 14-3-3 as described above. The 14-3-3 recognition motifs (RXXpS/TXP and RX(F/Y)XpSXP) coincide with sequences that are phosphorylated by AGC kinase members, and there are numerous examples that demonstrate roles for 14-3-3 proteins in modulating signaling downstream of AGC kinases (29Li Y.

Biol. 2003; 13: 2082-2090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). On the basis of our recent finding that the RGC is negatively regulated by Akt-catalyzed phosphorylation of RGC2 (20Chen X.W. Leto D. Xiong T. Yu G. Cheng A. Decker S. Saltiel A.R. A Ral GAP complex links PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling to RalA activation in insulin action.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2011; 22: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that 14-3-3 may interact with the RGC. We investigated whether the RGC was a putative 14-3-3 binding partner by immunoprecipitating the endogenous complex from 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with or without insulin and immunoblotting with an antibody that detects phosphorylated residues that lie within a 14-3-3 binding site motif (p14-3-3 binding site antibody, Fig. 1A). As shown previously (20Chen X.W. Leto D. Xiong T. Yu G. Cheng A. Decker S. Saltiel A.R. A Ral GAP complex links PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling to RalA activation in insulin action.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2011; 22: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), both the RGC1 and RGC2 subunits of the complex were immunoprecipitated using an anti-RGC2 antibody, whereas the complex was absent from a control immunoprecipitation using rabbit IgG antibody. The p14-3-3 binding site antibody weakly detected a band corresponding to the molecular weight of RGC2 in the RGC2 immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1A, arrow). Detection of RGC2 by this phospho-antibody was enhanced when the complex was immunoprecipitated from lysates treated with insulin. RGC2 phosphorylation that was detected by the p14-3-3 binding site antibody was maximal by 2 min after insulin stimulation and was sustained for up to 90 min after stimulation (Fig. 1B). Phosphorylation was increased by insulin in a dose-dependent manner that correlated with activation of Akt, which we previously showed catalyzes RGC2 phosphorylation on multiple residues (20Chen X.W. Leto D. Xiong T. Yu G. Cheng A. Decker S. Saltiel A.R. A Ral GAP complex links PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling to RalA activation in insulin action.Mol. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2005058366,"The novel rhomboid-like protein RHBDD2 is distantly related to rhomboid proteins, a group of highly specialized membrane-bound proteases that catalyze regulated intramembrane proteolysis. In retina, RHBDD2 is expressed from embryonic stages to adulthood, and its levels show age-dependent changes. RHBDD2 is distinctly abundant in the perinuclear region of cells, and it localizes to their Golgi. A glycine zipper motif present in one of the transmembrane domains of RHBDD2 is important for its packing into the Golgi membranes. Its deletion causes dislodgment of RHBDD2 from the Golgi. A specific antibody against RHBDD2 recognizes two forms of the protein, one with low (39 kDa; RHBDD2(L)) and the other with high (117 kDa; RHBDD2H) molecular masses in mouse retinal extracts. RHBDD2(L) seems to be ubiquitously expressed in all retinal cells. In contrast, RHBDD2H seems to be present only in the outer segments of cone photoreceptors and may correspond to a homotrimer of RHBDD2(L). This protein consistently co-localizes with S- and M-types of cone opsins. We identified a homozygous mutation in the human RHBDD2 gene, R85H, that co-segregates with disease in affected members of a family with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa. Our findings suggest that the RHBDD2 protein plays important roles in the development and normal function of the retina."
https://openalex.org/W2155968587,"The expression of cytokines, such as IL-1β, and the activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are crucial regulators in the process of carcinogenesis. The correlation between growth factor and activated cytokine signals in the control of tumor development is a critical issue to be clarified. In our study, we found that the IL-1β gene and protein expression were induced by EGF in squamous cell carcinoma. To clarify the mechanism involved in EGF-regulated IL-1β expression, we examined the transcriptional activity and mRNA stability of IL-1β in EGF-treated cells. We found that EGF induced the expression of IL-1β and was mediated through transcriptional activation, but not through mRNA stability. The involvement of Akt and NF-κB signaling pathways in the EGF-induced IL-1β gene expression was confirmed by knockdown of RelA and Akt in cells or treating cells with Akt and NF-κB inhibitors, LY294002 and parthenolide, respectively. The expression of dominant negative IκB also repressed the activation of NF-κB and inhibited EGF-induced IL-1β expression. Using immunofluorescence staining assay, the EGF-stimulated nuclear translocation of NF-κB (p65) was inhibited by pre-treating cells with LY294002 and parthenolide. Furthermore, EGF increased the binding of NF-κB to the NF-κB binding site of the IL-1β promoter through the activation of the Akt/NF-κB pathway, which resulted in activating IL-1β promoter activity. The expression and secretion of IL-1β induced by EGF considerably reduced chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin-induced cell death. These results showed that EGF enhanced the expression of IL-1β, which was mediated by the Akt/NF-κB pathway. The activation of EGF signaling and increase of IL-1β contributed to chemotherapeutic resistance of cancer cells, suggesting that the expression of IL-1β may be used as a biomarker to evaluate successful cancer treatment."
