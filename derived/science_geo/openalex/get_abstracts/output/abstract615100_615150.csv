We aimed to assess CMV seroprevalence in a nationally representative sample of adults in Germany and to identify sociodemographic factors associated with CMV seropositivity.Blood samples from 6552 participants (18-79 years) of the ""German National Health Interview and Examination Survey 1998"", a population-based sample of the adult population in Germany, were tested for the presence of CMV antibodies using an Ig-multiplex assay. Weighted seroprevalence was calculated and weighted binomial regression was used to identify factors associated with CMV seropositivity.Overall CMV seroprevalence was 56.7% (95%CI: 54.8-58.7%), with a higher seroprevalence in women (62.3%) than in men (51.0%). Seroprevalence increased with age: from 31.8% to 63.7% in men and from 44.1% to 77.6% in women when comparing the 18-29 with the 70-79 year age-group, respectively. CMV seroprevalence in women of childbearing age (18-45 years) was 51.7%. Factors significantly associated with CMV seropositivity were age, country of birth, smoking status, education, living in northern Germany and number of household members. In addition, having attended child care was associated with seropositivity in men, and number of siblings and living in East Germany in women.Our results indicate that half the women of childbearing age were susceptible for primary CMV infection during pregnancy. CMV screening during pregnancy and informing seronegative women about CMV risk reduction measures could prevent congenital CMV infections with its serious consequences."

Although prior studies have examined the effects of traditional media on children's development, there is limited evidence on the impact of mobile device use. The current study aimed to clarify the link between mobile device use and child adjustment. The sample included 1,642 children aged 6 in first grade at elementary schools in Japan. Parents completed a self-report questionnaire regarding their children's use of mobile devices and emotional/behavioral adjustment. We performed inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) logistic regression to compute odds ratios (OR) for emotional/behavioral problems according to mobile device use. The values for IPTW analysis were computed based on variables assessing sociodemographics and child characteristics. Among the participants, 230 (14.0%) were regular users (60 minutes or more on a typical day) and 1,412 (86.0%) non-regular users (under 60 minutes on a typical day). Relative to non-regular use, regular use of mobile devices was significantly linked to conduct problems (IPTW-OR: 1.77, 95% CI: [1.03-3.04], p < .05) and hyperactivity/inattention (IPTW-OR: 1.82, 95% CI: [1.15-2.87], p < .01). Based on these results, routine and frequent use of mobile devices appear to be associated with behavioral problems in childhood."
https://openalex.org/W2882976060,"Spring frosts, as experienced in Europe in April 2016 and 2017, pose a considerable risk to agricultural production, with the potential to cause significant damages to agricultural yields. Meteorological blocking events (stable high-pressure systems) have been shown to be one of the factors that trigger cold spells in spring. While current knowledge does not allow for drawing conclusions as to any change in future frequency and duration of blocking episodes due to climate change, the combination of their stable occurrence with the biological system under a warming trend can lead to economic damage increases. To evaluate future frost risk for apple producers in south-eastern Styria, we combine a phenological sequential model with highly resolved climate projections for Austria. Our model projects a mean advance of blooming of -1.6 ± 0.9 days per decade, shifting the bloom onset towards early April by the end of the 21st century. Our findings indicate that overall frost risk for apple cultures will remain in a warmer climate and potentially even increase due to a stronger connection between blocking and cold spells in early spring that can be identified from observational data. To prospectively deal with frost risk, measures are needed that either stabilize crop yields or ensure farmers' income by other means. We identify appropriate adaptation measures and relate their costs to the potential frost risk increase. Even if applied successfully, the costs of these measures in combination with future residual damages represent additional climate change related costs."
https://openalex.org/W2883297454,"Circulating tumor-derived cell-free DNA (ctDNA) enables non-invasive diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment susceptibility testing in human cancers. However, accurate detection of variant alleles, particularly during untargeted searches, remains a principal obstacle to widespread application of cell-free DNA in clinical oncology. In this study, isolation of short cell-free DNA fragments is shown to enrich for tumor variants and improve correction of PCR- and sequencing-associated errors. Subfractions of the mononucleosome of circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) were isolated from patients with melanoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and colorectal adenocarcinoma using a high-throughput-capable automated gel-extraction platform. Using a 128-gene (128 kb) custom next-generation sequencing panel, variant alleles were on average 2-fold enriched in the short fraction (median insert size: ~142 bp) compared to the original ccfDNA sample, while 0.7-fold reduced in the fraction corresponding to the principal peak of the mononucleosome (median insert size: ~167 bp). Size-selected short fractions compared to the original ccfDNA yielded significantly larger family sizes (i.e., PCR duplicates) during in silico consensus sequence interpretation via unique molecular identifiers. Increments in family size were associated with a progressive reduction of PCR and sequencing errors. Although consensus read depth also decreased at larger family sizes, the variant allele frequency in the short ccfDNA fraction remained consistent, while variant detection in the original ccfDNA was commonly lost at family sizes necessary to minimize errors. These collective findings support the automated extraction of short ccfDNA fragments to enrich for ctDNA while concomitantly reducing false positives through in silico error correction."
https://openalex.org/W2883746841,"Despite gains in life expectancy between 1992 to 2012, large disparities in life expectancy continue to exist in the United States between subgroups of the population. This study aimed to develop detailed life tables (LT), accounting for mortality differences by race, geography, and socio-economic status (SES), to more accurately measure relative cancer survival and life expectancy patterns in the United States.We estimated an extensive set of County SES-LT by fitting Poisson regression models to deaths and population counts for U.S. counties by age, year, gender, race, ethnicity and county-level SES index. We reported life expectancy patterns and evaluated the impact of the County SES-LT on relative survival using data from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program cancer registries.Between 1992 and 2012, the largest increase in life expectancy was among black men (6.8 years), however there were still large geographical differences. Life expectancy was highest for Asian or Pacific Islanders (API), and lowest for American Indians and Alaskan Natives (AIAN). In 2010, life expectancies by state ranged from 73 to 82 years for white males, 78 to 86 years for white females, 66 to 75 for black males, and 75 to 81 for black females. Comparisons of relative survival using National LT and the new County SES-LT showed that relative survival using County SES-LT improved relative survival estimates for some demographic groups, particularly in low and high SES areas, among Hispanics and AIAN, and among older male cancer patients. Relative survival using County SES-LT was 7.3% and 6.7% survival points closer to cause-specific survival compared to the National LT relative survival for AIAN and Hispanic cancer patients diagnosed between ages 75 and 84 years, respectively. Importantly, the County SES-LT relative survival estimates were higher in lower SES areas and lower in higher SES areas, reducing differences in relative survival comparisons.The use of these new socio-economic life tables (County SES-LT) can provide more accurate estimates of relative survival, improve comparisons of relative survival among registries, better illustrate disparities and cancer control efforts, and should be used as default for cancer relative survival using U.S. data."
https://openalex.org/W2883827605,"In the last few years, increasing numbers of viruses infecting fungi have been identified. In this study, we used an in silico approach for the analysis of deep RNA sequencing data in order to discover and characterize putative genomic ssRNA or dsRNA mycovirus sequences in Aspergillus fumigatus. RNA sequencing reads of A. fumigatus strains were mapped against the A. fumigatus Af293 reference genome. Unmapped reads were collected for de novo assembly. Contigs were analyzed by Blastx comparison with a mycovirus protein database. Assembled viral genomes were used as template for remapping of RNA sequencing reads. In total, deep RNA sequencing results from 11 A. fumigatus strains were analyzed for the presence of mycoviral genomic RNAs. In 9 out of 11 strains, putative mycoviral RNA genomes were identified. Three strains were infected with two different mycovirus species. Two strains were infected with Aspergillus fumigatus polymycovirus type-1 (AfuPmV-1). Four strains contained fully recovered genomic RNA of unknown narna-like viruses designated as Aspergillus fumigatus narnavirus-1 and Aspergillus fumigatus narnavirus-2 (AfuNV-1 and AfuNV-2). Both viruses showed 38% amino acid sequence identity to Beihai narna-like virus-21. Three strains contained partially recovered genomic RNA of an unknown narna-like virus. Two strains contained fully recovered genomic RNAs of an unknown partitivirus designated as Aspergillus fumigatus partitivirus-2 (AfuPV-2) which showed 50% amino acid sequence identity to Alternaria alternata partitivirus-1. Finally, one strain contained fully recovered genomic RNA of an unknown mitovirus designated as Aspergillus fumigatus mitovirus-1 (AfuMV-1) which showed 34% amino acid sequence identity to Sclerotina sclerotiorum mitovirus. In silico analysis of deep RNA sequencing results showed that a majority of the A. fumigatus strains used here were infected with mycoviruses. Four novel A. fumigatus RNA mycoviruses could be identified: two different Aspergillus fumigatus narna-like viruses, one Aspergillus fumigatus partitivirus, and one Aspergillus fumigatus mitovirus."
https://openalex.org/W2951816104,"Publicly available genomes are crucial for phylogenetic and metagenomic studies, in which contaminating sequences can be the cause of major problems. This issue is expected to be especially important for Cyanobacteria because axenic strains are notoriously difficult to obtain and keep in culture. Yet, despite their great scientific interest, no data are currently available concerning the quality of publicly available cyanobacterial genomes. As reliably detecting contaminants is a complex task, we designed a pipeline combining six methods in a consensus strategy to assess the contamination level of 440 genome assemblies of Cyanobacteria. Two methods are based on published reference databases of ribosomal genes (SSU rRNA 16S and ribosomal proteins), one is indirectly based on a reference database of marker genes (CheckM), and three are based on complete genome analysis. Among those genome-wide methods, Kraken and DIAMOND blastx share the same reference database that we derived from Ensembl Bacteria, whereas CONCOCT does not require any reference database, instead relying on differences in DNA tetramer frequencies. Given that all the six methods appear to have their own strengths and limitations, we used the consensus of their rankings to infer that >5% of cyanobacterial genome assemblies are highly contaminated by foreign DNA (i.e., contaminants were detected by 5 or 6 methods). Our results will help researchers to check the quality of publicly available genomic data before use in their own analyses. Moreover, we argue that journals should make mandatory the submission of raw read data along with genome assemblies in order to facilitate the detection of contaminants in sequence databases."
https://openalex.org/W2883621368,"The epidemic of obesity in developed countries is commonly associated with poor dietary habit and sedentary lifestyle. However, other determinants, including education background and family income, may contribute towards the problem especially in developing countries. This study aimed to determine the influence of socioeconomic status (SES) on obesity among 12-year-old school adolescents in Terengganu, Malaysia. Body weight and height were measured and BMI was categorised based on WHO z-score cut-off points. Information was obtained from self-reported questionnaire on parents' education background, family income and occupation. A total of 3,798 school adolescents aged 12 years (44% boys and 56% girls) were recruited. There was no significant difference in BMI status between boys and girls, or between rural and urban participants. There were significant differences between BMI categories and gender, household income and SES level within rural areas. In the urban areas, significant differences were found between BMI categories and gender, parents' occupational and educational level, household income and size, and SES level. A logistic regression model found several SES factors to be predictors of obesity in this population, namely, gender, household size, father's occupation level, household income level and SES level. Each component of SES has been significantly associated with the BMI category of school adolescents, particularly in the urban areas. This suggests the requirement of multifaceted approaches, including the role of family, society and authorities, in the effort to curtail adolescent obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2883198230,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from adult human tissues are capable of proliferating in vitro and maintaining their multipotency, making them attractive cell sources for regenerative medicine. However, the availability and capability of self-renewal under current preparation regimes are limited. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) now offer an alternative, similar cell source to MSCs. Herein, we established new methods for differentiating hiPSCs into MSCs via mesoderm-like and neuroepithelium-like cells. Both derived MSC populations exhibited self-renewal and multipotency, as well as therapeutic potential in mouse models of skin wounds, pressure ulcers, and osteoarthritis. Interestingly, the therapeutic effects differ between the two types of MSCs in the disease models, suggesting that the therapeutic effect depends on the cell origin. Our results provide valuable basic insights for the clinical application of such cells."
https://openalex.org/W2883982058,"Background Multidisciplinary management of Klinefelter cases is now considered good clinical practice in order to ensure optimal quality of life. Reproductive performance of Klinefelter men is an important issue however literature in this domain is limited and prone to bias. Study design This was a retrospective longitudinal cohort study performed at a tertiary referral University Centre for Reproductive Medicine and Genetics. One hundred thirty-eight non-mosaic azoospermic Klinefelter patients undergoing their first testicular biopsy (TESE) between 1994 and 2013, followed by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) with fresh or frozen-thawed testicular sperm in the female partner, were followed-up longitudinally. The main outcome measure was cumulative live birth rate per Klinefelter patient embarking on TESE-ICSI. Findings In forty-eight men (48/138) sperm were successfully retrieved at the first TESE (34.8%). The mean age of the patients was 32.4 years. Younger age at first TESE was associated with a higher sperm retrieval rate (p<0.001). Overall 39 couples underwent 62 ICSI cycles and 13 frozen embryo transfer cycles resulting in in 20 pregnancies and 14 live birth deliveries (16 children). The mean age of the female partner was 28.1 years. The crude cumulative delivery rate after four ICSI cycles was 35.9%. Per intention-to-treat however, only 10.1% (14/138) of the Klinefelter men starting treatment succeeded in having their biologically own child(ren). Conclusion Non-mosaic Klinefelter patients with azoospermia seeking treatment by TESE-ICSI should be counseled that by intention-to-treat the chance of retrieving sperm is fair, however only a minority will eventually father genetically own children."
https://openalex.org/W2884232052,"The minimally invasive transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is the most prevalent method to treat aortic valve stenosis. For pre-operative surgical planning, contrast-enhanced coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is used as the imaging technique to acquire 3-D measurements of the valve. Accurate localization of the eight aortic valve landmarks in CT images plays a vital role in the TAVI workflow because a small error risks blocking the coronary circulation. In order to examine the valve and mark the landmarks, physicians prefer a view parallel to the hinge plane, instead of using the conventional axial, coronal or sagittal view. However, customizing the view is a difficult and time-consuming task because of unclear aorta pose and different artifacts of CCTA. Therefore, automatic localization of landmarks can serve as a useful guide to the physicians customizing the viewpoint. In this paper, we present an automatic method to localize the aortic valve landmarks using colonial walk, a regression tree-based machine-learning algorithm. For efficient learning from the training set, we propose a two-phase optimized search space learning model in which a representative point inside the valvular area is first learned from the whole CT volume. All eight landmarks are then learned from a smaller area around that point. Experiment with preprocedural CCTA images of TAVI undergoing patients showed that our method is robust under high stenotic variation and notably efficient, as it requires only 12 milliseconds to localize all eight landmarks, as tested on a 3.60 GHz single-core CPU."
https://openalex.org/W2883310024,"The human skin microbiome can vary over time, and inter-individual variability of the microbiome is greater than the temporal variability within an individual. The skin microbiome has become a useful tool to identify individuals, and one type of personal identification using the skin microbiome has been reported in a community of less than 20 individuals. However, identification of individuals based on the skin microbiome has shown low accuracy in communities larger than 80 individuals. Here, we developed a new approach for personal identification, which considers that minor taxa are one of the important factors for distinguishing between individuals. We originally established a human skin microbiome for 66 samples from 11 individuals over two years (33 samples each year). Our method could classify individuals with 85% accuracy beyond a one-year sampling period. Moreover, we applied our method to 837 publicly available skin microbiome samples from 89 individuals and succeeded in identifying individuals with 78% accuracy. In short, our results investigate that (i) our new personal identification method worked well with two different communities (our data: 11 individuals; public data: 89 individuals) using the skin microbiome, (ii) defining the personal skin microbiome requires samples from several time points, (iii) inclusion of minor skin taxa strongly contributes to the effectiveness of personal identification."
https://openalex.org/W2883338283,"Neuroblastoma is the second most common childhood tumor. Survival is poor even with intensive therapy. In a search for therapies to neuroblastoma, we assessed the oncolytic potential of Zika virus. Zika virus is an emerging mosquito-borne pathogen unique among flaviviruses because of its association with congenital defects. Recent studies have shown that neuronal progenitor cells are likely the human target of Zika virus. Neuroblastoma has been shown to be responsive to infection. In this study, we show that neuroblastoma cells are widely permissive to Zika infection, revealing extensive cytopathic effects (CPE) and producing high titers of virus. However, a single cell line appeared poorly responsive to infection, producing undetectable levels of non-structural protein 1 (NS1), limited CPE, and low virus titers. A comparison of these poorly permissive cells to highly permissive neuroblastoma cells revealed a dramatic loss in the expression of the cell surface glycoprotein CD24 in poorly permissive cells. Complementation of CD24 expression in these cells led to the production of detectable levels of NS1 expression after infection with Zika, as well as dramatic increases in viral titers and CPE. Complementary studies using the Zika virus index strain and a north African isolate confirmed these phenotypes. These results suggest a possible role for CD24 in host cell specificity by Zika virus and offer a potential therapeutic target for its treatment. In addition, Zika viral therapy can serve as an adjunctive treatment for neuroblastoma by targeting tumor cells that can lead to recurrent disease and treatment failure."
https://openalex.org/W2884105827,"The Early Cretaceous (?Berriasian-Barremian) Teete vertebrate locality in Western Yakutia, East Siberia, Russia, has produced mammal remains that are attributed to three taxa: Eleutherodontidae indet. cf. Sineleutherus sp. (Haramiyida; an upper molariform tooth), Khorotherium yakutensis gen. et sp. nov. (Tegotheriidae, Docodonta; maxillary fragment with three molariform teeth and dentary fragment with one molariform tooth), and Sangarotherium aquilonium gen. et sp. nov. (Eutriconodonta incertae sedis; dentary fragment with one erupted molariform tooth and one tooth in crypt). This is the second occurrence of Mesozoic mammals in high latitudes (paleolatitude estimate N 63–70°) of the Northern Hemisphere. In spite of the presumed Early Cretaceous age based on freshwater mollusks, the Teete mammal assemblage has a distinctive Jurassic appearance, being most similar to the Middle-Late Jurassic mammal assemblages known from Siberia, Russia and Xinjiang, China. The smooth transition from Jurassic to Cretaceous biota in Northern Asia is best explained by stable environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2883755085,"Antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) has most often been associated with dengue virus (DENV). Studies using leukemia cell lines suggest that DENV specific antibodies can enhance Zika virus (ZIKV) infectivity, and vice versa. To examine the mechanisms of ADE of ZIKV infection in primary human cells, we assessed 40 serum samples obtained from convalescent DENV-1 or DENV-3 infected subjects. All sera tested exhibited high binding potency, while modest or none neutralization activities against ZIKV. Primary CD14+ monocytes, rather than B and T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), were found to be the mediators of the enhancement of ZIKV infectivity by DENV immune sera. Monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells (DCs), but not mature DCs were highly permissive to ZIKV infection, whereas neither immature nor mature DCs could mediate enhanced ZIKV infection in the presence of DENV immune sera. In addition, antibody blocking of either FcγRI (CD64), or FcγRII (CD32), or FcγRIII (CD16) resulted in diminished ADE of ZIKV infection. Our findings provide an improved understanding of the pathogenesis of ZIKV infection, and inform rational vaccine design."
https://openalex.org/W2884358808,"Objective The United States Public Health Service released clinical practice guidelines for daily oral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in May 2014. Local health departments (LHDs) are expected to play a critical role in PrEP implementation. We surveyed LHDs to assess awareness of and interest in supporting PrEP implementation, what roles they were taking, or believed they should take, in supporting PrEP, and what resources would be required to do so. Methods LHDs were surveyed in 2015 to assess their engagement in PrEP implementation (n = 500). The study employed a cross-sectional survey design with a randomly selected stratified sample. Results Among responding LHDs (n = 284), 109 (29%, weighted proportion) reported engagement in PrEP implementation. LHDs serving large jurisdictions (population 500,000+) and located in the West were more likely to be engaged in PrEP implementation. Making referrals for PrEP (74%) and conducting education and outreach to community members (51%) were the activities most frequently reported by LHDs engaged in PrEP implementation; 45% anticipated expanding their level of engagement. Among LHDs not engaged in PrEP implementation, 13% expected to become engaged over the next four years, 46% were undecided, and 41% reported it was unlikely. Information about PrEP for health care providers and information about PrEP for health department staff were the most frequently reported resource needs for LHDs engaged and not engaged in PrEP implementation, respectively. Conclusions PrEP implementation by LHDs was limited in 2015, three years after Food and Drug Administration approval and one year after the U.S. Public Health Service issued clinical practice guidelines. PrEP is a recently available intervention that is requiring LHDs to adjust existing HIV prevention efforts and service delivery models. Additional resources and implementation research is needed to effectively support PrEP scale-up by LHDs. Efforts must also be undertaken to increase PrEP awareness, knowledge, and implementation capacity among LHDs."
https://openalex.org/W2884834614,"Adolescent men who have sex with men (AMSM) account for disproportionately high numbers of new HIV diagnoses. Non-adherence to daily use limiting the effectiveness of oral PrEP (Truvada) has led to current trials with adult MSM testing Cabotegravir, a long-term injectable medication. Once comparative studies with young adult MSM have established relative safety and efficacy of these medications, there will be a need for such comparative trials involving adolescents. Trends in state laws and IRB protocol review indicate that many of these studies will permit youth to provide independent consent for participation. Understanding the motivations of AMSM to participate in HIV biomedical prevention studies is important to ensure their agreement is voluntary without misunderstanding and undue influence. This study examined AMSM attitudes toward participation in oral/injectable PrEP RCTs to inform protections of youth's rights and welfare in future studies.We administered to 198 ethnically diverse U.S. AMSM, 14-17 years, a web-based survey including demographic and sexual health questions, description of a year-long oral versus injectable PrEP RCT and 26 Likert-type and one open-ended item assessing motivations for and against participation including: perceived benefits and risks of PrEP; free HIV/STI testing and counseling; confidentiality concerns; random assignment; and benefit to others.Sixty-two percent indicated they were likely to participate in the study. The majority endorsed daily HIV protection, free HIV/STI testing, sexual health counseling, not having to rely on partner's condom use, and altruism as reasons to participate. Reasons against participation included medication side effects, concern taking the pill daily and clinic visits would reveal their sexual orientation and behaviors to parents. Over half erroneously assumed they would be assigned to the condition best for them and 39% indicated free access to services would lead them to participate even if they did not want to. Multiple regression indicated these factors accounted for 55% of the variance in participation choice. Nether age or ethnicity yielded significance.Results suggest future biomedical HIV prevention research will need to develop procedures to address AMSM's confidentiality concerns, enhance youth's understanding of random assignment, the continued importance of medication adherence and partner condom use during trial participation, and availability of alternative sexual health services to avoid the potentially undue influence of access to free sexual health services."
https://openalex.org/W2883948458,"Birth asphyxia resulting in brain hypoxia-ischemia (H-I) can cause neonatal death or lead to persistent brain damage. Recent investigations have shown that group II metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR2/3) activation can provide neuroprotection against H-I but the mechanism of this effect is not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether mGluR2/3 agonists applied a short time after H-I reduce brain damage in an experimental model of birth asphyxia, and whether a decrease in oxidative stress plays a role in neuroprotection. Neonatal H-I in 7-day-old rats was used as an experimental model of birth asphyxia. Rats were injected intra peritoneally with mGluR2 (LY 379268) or mGluR3 (NAAG) agonists 1 h or 6 h after H-I (5 mg/kg). The weight deficit of the ischemic brain hemisphere, radical oxygen species (ROS) content levels, antioxidant enzymes activity and the concentrations of reduced glutathione (GSH) were measured. Both agonists reduced weight loss in the ischemic hemisphere and mitigated neuronal degeneration in the CA1 hippocampal region and cerebral cortex. Both agonists reduced the elevated levels of ROS in the ipsilateral hemisphere observed after H-I and prevented an increase in antioxidant enzymes activity in the injured hemisphere restoring them to control levels. A decrease in GSH level was also restored after agonists application. The results show that the activation of mGluR2 and mGluR3 a short time after H-I triggers neuroprotective mechanisms that act through the inhibition of oxidative stress and ROS production. The prevention of ROS production by the inhibition of glutamate release and decrease in its extracellular concentration is likely the main mechanism involved in the observed neuroprotection."
https://openalex.org/W2884021628,"Proper bioelement content is crucial for the health and wellness of all organisms, including honeybees. However, the situation is more complicated in these important pollinators due to the fact that they change their physiology during winter in order to survive the relatively harsh climatic conditions. Additionally, honeybees are susceptible to many diseases such as nosemosis, which during winter can depopulate an entire colony. Here we show that summer bees have a markedly higher content of important bioelements such as: Al, Cu, P, V, (physiologically essential); Ca, K, Mg, (electrolytic); Cr, Se, Zn, (enzymatic); As, Hg, (toxic). In contrast, a markedly higher content of: Fe (physiologically essential); Mn, Ni, (enzymatic); Cd (exclusively toxic) were present in winter bees. Importantly, N. ceranae infection resulted in an increased honeybee bioelement content of: S, Sr (physiologically essential) and Pb (exclusively toxic), whereas the Nosema-free worker-bees had higher amounts of B and Si (physiologically essential). We propose that the shortages of Fe, Mn, Ni, and Na observed in Nosema-infected bees, could be the reason for the higher mortality of Nosema-infected bees throughout overwintering. In addition, a shortage of bioelements such as B and Si may be a reason for accelerated aging in foragers that is observed following N. ceranae infection. Therefore, in winter, bioelement content was more strongly affected by N. ceranae infection than during summer. We found a strong correlation between the bioelement content of bees and seasons (summer or winter) and also with Nosema infection. We conclude that the balance of bioelements in the honeybee is altered by both seasonal affects and by Nosema infection."

Furthermore, identification of changes in globulins in animals with poaching and other injuries can guide discovery of potentially useful biomarkers of inflammation. The aim of this study was to develop reference intervals for agarose gel SPE in healthy white rhinoceros and to compare these serum protein electrophoresis results to those from animals with tissue trauma. Reference intervals for total serum protein and agarose gel electrophoretic albumin and globulin fractions were generated using serum samples from 49 healthy free-ranging adult white rhinoceros. A standardised gating system together with identification of specific proteins by mass spectrometry aided in fraction identification. Six globulin fractions were identified: α1a, α1b, α2, β1, β2 and γ. Reference intervals were generated for total serum protein (76–111 g/L), albumin (10–27 g/L) and globulin fractions (α1a: 1.6–3.2 g/L; α1b: 1.7–3.6 g/L; α2: 16.1–26.6 g/L; β1: 6.6–18.2 g/L; β2: 11.8–30.4 g/L; γ: 10.4–23.1 g/L; albumin: globulin ratio: 0.12–0.39). Results were compared to those from 30 animals with various degrees and chronicities of tissue trauma. Wounded animals had lower concentrations of total serum protein, albumin, total globulin, α and β1 globulins, lower percentages of α2 and β1 globulins, and higher percentages of β2 and γ globulins. These protein changes are similar to those seen in human patients with wounds rather than classic acute phase or chronic inflammatory responses."

This study (1) examines factors that influence when individuals transition from a negative to positive test (acquisition) or a positive to negative test (loss) of rhinovirus (HRV) and other respiratory tract viruses in 26 households followed weekly for one year, (2) investigates evidence for intrahousehold and interhousehold transmission and the characteristics of individuals implicated in transmission, and (3) builds data-based simulation models to identify factors that most strongly affect patterns of prevalence.We detected HRV, coronavirus, paramyxovirus, influenza and bocavirus with the FilmArray polymerase chain reaction (PCR) platform (BioFire Diagnostics, LLC). We used logistic regression to find covariates affecting acquisition or loss of HRV including demographic characteristics of individuals, their household, their current infection status, and prevalence within their household and across the population. We apply generalized linear mixed models to test robustness of results.Acquisition of HRV was less probable in older individuals and those infected with a coronavirus, and higher with a higher proportion of other household members infected. Loss of HRV is reduced with a higher proportion of other household members infected. Within households, only children and symptomatic individuals show evidence for transmission, while between households only a higher number of infected older children (ages 5-19) increases the probability of acquisition. Coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses and bocavirus also show evidence of intrahousehold transmission. Simulations show that age-dependent susceptibility and transmission have the largest effects on mean HRV prevalence.Children are most likely to acquire and most likely to transmit HRV both within and between households, with infectiousness concentrated in symptomatic children.

Some aleocharine staphylinid beetles employ chemical and tactile strategies to invade colonies, where they later consume ant brood and participate in parasitic trophallaxis with host ants. By producing compounds that both appease their hosts and stimulate adoption, the beetles are able to live in and deposit their own eggs in the well defended ant nest. In the current paper, previous findings on the myrmecophilous behavior and morphological features of the staphylinid beetle Lomechusoides (formerly Lomechusa) strumosus are reviewed and re-evaluated. Hitherto unpublished results concerning the beetles’ ability to participate in the social food flow of their host ants are reported. Furthermore, we present an analysis and documentation of the behavioral interactions between beetles and host ants during the adoption process, and we report new histological and scanning electron microscopic analyses of the exocrine glands and morphological adaptations that underlie the myrmecophilous behavior of L. strumosus. The main features of L. strumosus are compared with those of the staphilinid myrmecophile Lomechusa (formerly Atemeles) pubicollis. The paper concludes with a description of the life trajectory of L. strumosus and presents a brief history and discussion of the hypotheses concerning the evolution of myrmecophily in L. strumosus and other highly adapted myrmecophilous parasites."
https://openalex.org/W2884336556,"Deep-sea midwater ""saccopharyngiform"" eels of the families Cyematidae, Monognathidae, Eurypharyngidae and Saccopharyngidae (order Anguilliformes) are extraordinary fishes having major skeletal reductions and modifications compared to the general anguilliform body structure. Little is known about most aspects of the systematics, phylogeny, and ecology of these families, and few of the approximately 30 species described from adult specimens have been matched with their leptotocephalus larvae. Based on mitogenomic sequence data from rare new specimens, we show that the long-speculated-about larval form referred to as ""Leptocephalus holti"", which was thought to possibly be the larva of the rare orange-colored eels of Neocyema (5 known specimens; speculated to belong to the Cyematidae) are actually the larvae of the one-jaw eels of the family Monognathidae. One of the 5 types of L. holti larvae that were collected in the Pacific is genetically matched with Monognathus jesperseni, but multiple species exist based on larval sequence data and the morphology of adult specimens. A rare leptocephalus from the Sargasso Sea, with unique morphological characteristics including many small orange spots on the gut, was found to be the larva of Neocyema, which is presently only known from the Atlantic Ocean. We demonstrate that Neocyema constitutes a separate family being most closely related to Eurypharyngidae and Saccopharyngidae based on mitogenomic DNA sequences and unique mitochondrial gene orders."
https://openalex.org/W2884623692,"We have synthesized a bimodal theranostic nanodelivery system (BIT) that is based on graphene oxide (GO) and composed of a natural chemotherapeutic agent, chlorogenic acid (CA) used as the anticancer agent, while gadolinium (Gd) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were used as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modality. The CA and Gd guest agents were simultaneously loaded on the GO nanolayers using chemical interactions, such as hydrogen bonding and π-π non-covalent interactions to form GOGCA nanocomposite. Subsequently, the AuNPs were doped on the surface of the GOGCA by means of electrostatic interactions, which resulted in the BIT. The physico-chemical studies of the BIT affirmed its successful development. The X-ray diffractograms (XRD) collected of the various stages of BIT synthesis showed the successive development of the hybrid system, while 90% of the chlorogenic acid was released in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) at pH 4.8. This was further reaffirmed by the in vitro evaluations, which showed stunted HepG2 cancer cells growth against the above 90% cell growth in the control cells. A reverse case was recorded for the 3T3 normal cells. Further, the acquired T1-weighted image of the BIT doped samples obtained from the MRI indicated contrast enhancement in comparison with the plain Gd and water references. The abovementioned results portray our BIT as a promising future chemotherapeutic for anticancer treatment with diagnostic modalities."
https://openalex.org/W2884445027,"The natural world is filled with substrates of varying properties that challenge locomotor abilities. Birds appear to transition smoothly from aerial to terrestrial environments during take-offs and landings using substrates that are incredibly variable. It may be challenging to control movement on and off compliant (flexible) substrates such as twigs, yet birds routinely accomplish such tasks. Previous research suggests that birds do not use their legs to harness elastic recoil from perches. Given avian mastery of take-off and landing, we hypothesized that birds instead modulate wing, body and tail movements to effectively use compliant perches. We measured take-off and landing performance of diamond doves (Geopelia cuneata (N = 5) in the laboratory and perch selection in this species in the field (N = 25). Contrary to our hypothesis, doves do not control take-off and landing on compliant perches as effectively as they do on stiff perches. They do not recover elastic energy from the perch, and take-off velocities are thus negatively impacted. Landing velocities remain unchanged, which suggests they may not anticipate the need to compensate for compliance. Legs and wings function as independent units: legs produce lower initial velocities when taking off from a compliant substrate, which negatively impacts later flight velocities. During landing, significant stability problems arise with compliance that are ameliorated by the wings and tail. Collectively, we suggest that the diamond dove maintains a generalized take-off and landing behavior regardless of perch compliance, leading us to conclude that perch compliance represents a challenge for flying birds. Free-living diamond doves avoid the negative impacts of compliance by preferentially selecting perches of larger diameter, which tend to be stiffer."
https://openalex.org/W2951537566,"Self-reported social mixing patterns are commonly used in mathematical models of infectious diseases. It is particularly important to quantify patterns for school-age children given their disproportionate role in transmission, but it remains unclear how the structure of such social interactions changes over time. By integrating data collection into a public engagement programme, we examined self-reported contact networks in year 7 groups in four UK secondary schools. We collected data from 460 unique participants across four rounds of data collection conducted between January and June 2015, with 7,315 identifiable contacts reported in total. Although individual-level contacts varied over the study period, we were able to obtain out-of-sample accuracies of more than 90% and F-scores of 0.49–0.84 when predicting the presence or absence of social contacts between specific individuals across rounds of data collection. Network properties such as clustering and number of communities were broadly consistent within schools between survey rounds, but varied significantly between schools. Networks were assortative according to gender, and to a lesser extent school class, with the estimated clustering coefficient larger among males in all surveyed co-educational schools. Our results demonstrate that it is feasible to collect longitudinal self-reported social contact data from school children and that key properties of these data are consistent between rounds of data collection."
https://openalex.org/W2764116991,"How can we find patterns and anomalies in a tensor, i.e., multi-dimensional array, in an efficient and directly interpretable way? How can we do this in an online environment, where a new tensor arrives at each time step? Finding patterns and anomalies in multi-dimensional data have many important applications, including building safety monitoring, health monitoring, cyber security, terrorist detection, and fake user detection in social networks. Standard tensor decomposition results are not directly interpretable and few methods that propose to increase interpretability need to be made faster, more memory efficient, and more accurate for large and quickly generated data in the online environment. We propose two versions of a fast, accurate, and directly interpretable tensor decomposition method we call CTD that is based on efficient sampling method. First is the static version of CTD, i.e., CTD-S, that provably guarantees up to 11× higher accuracy than that of the state-of-the-art method. Also, CTD-S is made up to 2.3× faster and up to 24× more memory-efficient than the state-of-the-art method by removing redundancy. Second is the dynamic version of CTD, i.e. CTD-D, which is the first interpretable dynamic tensor decomposition method ever proposed. It is also made up to 82× faster than the already fast CTD-S by exploiting factors at previous time step and by reordering operations. With CTD, we demonstrate how the results can be effectively interpreted in online distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack detection and online troll detection."

Here, we use Lyse-It® for bacterial cellular lysis, genomic DNA fragmentation, and protein release and degradation for both Listeria monocytogenes and Vibrio cholerae. The concept of Lyse-It® employs a conventional microwave and Lyse-It® slides for intensely focused microwave irradiation onto the sample. High microwave power and a <60 second irradiation time allow for rapid cellular lysis and subsequent intracellular component release. The pathogenic bacteria are identified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), which subsequently demonstrates the viability of DNA for amplification post microwave-induced lysis. Intracellular component release, degradation, and detection of L. monocytogenes and V. cholerae has been performed and shown in this paper. These results demonstrate a rapid, low-cost, and efficient way for bacterial sample preparation on both food and water-borne Gram-positive and -negative organisms alike."
https://openalex.org/W2884331039,"Given the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance, antibiotics that employ new strategies are urgently needed. Bacterial survival is dependent on proper function of the signal recognition particle (SRP) and its receptor (FtsY). A unique set of interactions in FtsY:SRP-RNA represents a promising candidate for new antibiotic development as no antibiotic targets this complex and these interactions are functionally replaced by protein:protein interactions in eukaryotes. We used a Fragment Based Drug Design (FBDD) approach to search for new compounds that can bind FtsY, and have identified three lead fragments. In vitro and in vivo analyses have shown that despite a high micromolar binding affinity, one fragment has some antimicrobial properties. X-ray structures of E. coli FtsY:fragments reveal the fragments bind in the targeted RNA interaction site. Our results show that FBDD is a suitable approach for targeting FtsY:SRP-RNA for antibiotic development and opens the possibility of targeting protein:RNA interactions in general."

The construction of a reliable and dynamic mathematical model for multiplex qPCR that analyzes the effects of interactions between variables is therefore especially important. This work aimed to analyze the effects of interactions between variables through response surface method (RSM) for uni- and multiplex qPCR, and further optimize the parameters by constructing two mathematical models via RSM and back-propagation neural network-genetic algorithm (BPNN-GA) respectively. The statistical analysis showed that Mg2+ was the most important factor for both uni- and multiplex qPCR. Dynamic models of uni- and multiplex qPCR could be constructed using both RSM and BPNN-GA methods. But RSM was better than BPNN-GA on prediction performance in terms of the mean absolute error (MAE), the mean square error (MSE) and the Coefficient of Determination (R2). Ultimately, optimal parameters of uni- and multiplex qPCR were determined by RSM."
https://openalex.org/W2883120908,"Background Total knee replacement (TKR) is increasingly performed in short term hospital stay, making same day mobilization an important issue is after surgery. This implies little joint effusion by reducing intra-articular blood loss, which will enhance knee range of motion. The application of a topical fibrin sealant on the intraoperative bare bone and synovial tissue may contribute to better early full mobilization and thus improved functional outcomes. Since ambulation with a fully extended knee is less strenuous, we hypothesized that patients who received fibrin sealant would demonstrate improved early knee extension after six weeks compared to patients who received standard care. Methods A multicenter randomized controlled trial in a consecutive series of osteoarthritis patients scheduled for TKR surgery. Participants were randomized to receive fibrin sealant or not before closing the knee joint capsule. Primary outcome was change in knee extension angle(°) at short term (2 weeks) follow-up (cExt). Secondary outcomes were 6-week extension angle, knee flexion angle, hemoglobin loss, blood transfusion rates, complication rates, the Knee Society Score, and the KOOS and EQ5D questionnaires. Results When data on primary outcome became available from 250 patients, an interim analysis was performed by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board for safety and effectivity assessment. This analysis showed that sufficient patients were included to detect a cExt of 10° between both groups. Inclusion was stopped however, all in the meantime included patients were treated according to their randomization. A total of 466 were available for analysis. Both groups were comparable in terms of baseline characteristics. The estimated mean cExt difference was 0.2° (95%CI -0.5 to 0.9). No differences in secondary outcomes were found. Conclusions No beneficial effects or side effects were found of a topically applied fibrin sealant during TKR surgery. These results discourage the clinical use of a fibrin sealant in TKR.

Methods This study employed a cross-sectional survey design using a quantitative self-administered questionnaire among 309 Saudi men with type 2 diabetes. The study was conducted in hospital-based primary care clinics at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia during the period from July to September 2015. Results The mean age of the patients was 60.2 years with the mean duration of diabetes approximately 12.5 years. Few of the patients (9.7%) had been asked by their physicians about ED within the last year of attending the clinics although most patients (84.8%) were willing to discuss this issue. The presence of ED among the respondents was 89%. Two participants’ characteristics were associated with a willingness to discuss ED with the physicians. These characteristics were age above 60 (OR = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.11–0.55), and having severe ED (OR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.08–0.85). The respondents’ main barriers to discussing ED with their physicians were embarrassing the doctor, ED is a personal issue, too old or too sick to address ED issues now, no effective treatment available, and the doctor is too young to discuss ED with. Conclusions Most patients who have type 2 diabetes are not asked about ED within the last year of attendance even though most are willing to discuss it with their physicians. Being older and suffering more severe ED will result in being less willing to discuss ED with their doctor. Further research is needed to explore the barriers which prevent physicians from discussing ED with their patients who have diabetes."

It brings together biologists, mathematicians, computer scientists, physicists, and engineers, so it has both biology-oriented components and systems-oriented components. We applied several computational tools to analyze the bibliographic information of published articles in systems biology to answer the question: Did the research topics of systems biology become more biology-oriented or more systems-oriented from 1992 to 2013? We analyzed the metadata of 9923 articles on systems biology from the Web of Science database. We identified the most highly cited 330 references using computational tools and through close reading we divided them into nine categories of research types in systems biology. Interestingly, we found that articles in one category, namely, systems biology's applications in medical research, increased tremendously. This finding was corroborated by computational analysis of the abstracts, which also suggested that the percentages of topics on vaccines, diseases, drugs and cancers increased over time. In addition, we analyzed the institutional backgrounds of the corresponding authors of those 9923 articles and identified the most highly cited 330 authors over time. We found that before the mid-1990s, systems-oriented scientists had made the most referenced contributions. However, in recent years, researchers from biology-oriented institutions not only represented a huge percentage of the total number of researchers, but also had made the most referenced contributions. Notably, interdisciplinary institutions only produced a small percentage of researchers, but had made disproportionate contributions to this field."

In the process of measuring the data using a sensor, the damage of the data caused by the defect of the sensor or the environmental factor greatly degrades the performance of data classification. Instead of the traditional PCA based on L2-norm, the PCA features were extracted based on L1-norm and updated by iteratively reweighted fitting using the generalized objective function to obtain robust features for the outlier data. The damaged data samples were reconstructed using weighted linear combination using these features and the projection vectors of L1-norm based PCA. The experimental results on various types of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) data show that the proposed method can be used to reconstruct the damaged data to the original form of the undamaged data and to prevent degradation of classification performance due to data corruption through data reconstruction."

Here we present the crystal structures of human procathepsin H at 2.00 Å and 1.66 Å resolution. These structures allow us to explore in detail the molecular basis for the inhibition of the mature domain by the prodomain. Comparison with cathepsin H structure reveals how mini-chain reorients upon activation. We further demonstrate that procathepsin H is not auto-activated but can be trans-activated by cathepsin L."
https://openalex.org/W2883240303,"The ears of many mammals have a set of uniformly spaced horizontal ridges that form groove arrays. Contact of coherent waves (e.g. acoustic waves) with a series of slits or grooves causes diffraction, which produces constructive and destructive interference patterns. Increases in signal strength will occur but will depend on the frequencies involved, the groove number and their separations. Diffraction effects can happen for a wide range of frequencies and wavelengths, but no array can diffract wavelengths greater than twice the groove separation, and it is for those wavelengths comparable in size with the groove separation that the effects are greatest. For example, when ridges in bat ears are 1 mm apart, the strongest influence will occur for a 1 mm wavelength which corresponds to a frequency of 343 kHz. If bats could use these wavelengths, it would help them to resolve objects or surface textures of about 0.5 mm. Given how critical acoustics are for bat function, we asked whether bats may be taking advantage of diffraction effects generated by the grooves. We hypothesize that groove number varies with bat foraging strategy. Examining 120 species, we found that groove number is related to both guild and ear length. Bats in guilds that glean prey items from foliage or ground have on average more grooves than bats in other guilds. Harmonics generated by echolocation calls are the most likely source for the wavelengths that would correspond to the groove separations. We apply the physical principles of wave reflection, diffraction, and superposition to support the hypothesis that acoustic responses generated from grooves may be useful to bats. We offer an explanation why some bat species do not have grooves. We also discuss the presence of groove arrays in non-echolocating Chiropterans, and five additional mammalian orders."

High self-esteem consistency describes when implicit and explicit self-esteem match (e.g., both high or both low). In the current study, we investigated if implicit and explicit self-esteem and self-esteem consistency predict the course of treatment efficacy of a cognitive behavioral depression therapy. Explicit self-esteem was assessed by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, implicit self-esteem by a priming task. Participants were 31 patients with a major depressive or recurrent depressive disorder receiving cognitive behavioral therapy treatment in an inpatient setting. Self-esteem measures were administered before treatment. The development of depression symptoms during treatment and at the 4-month follow-up was measured on the Beck Depression Inventory. Implicit and explicit self-esteem did not predict the course of the therapy. Patients with congruent self-esteem, however, improved faster and showed lower severity of symptoms throughout treatment. In contrast, neither explicit nor implicit self-esteem nor self-esteem consistency predicted the stability of effects after treatment. Practical implications such as targeting discrepancies in self-esteem during treatment are discussed."

We divided our cohort into four groups by the quartile points of serum ferritin level: G1 (≤55 ng/mL, n = 148), G2 (56-130 ng/mL, n = 142), G3 (131-243 ng/mL, n = 144) and G4 (≥244 ng/mL, n = 144). We analyzed the recurrence and survival of patients using the Kaplan-Meier method. We also evaluated pathological iron deposition among patients with a solitary tumor smaller than 2 cm.The cumulative rates of overall recurrence and survival at 5 years were 81.6% and 66.3%, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2884603232,"Many of the cytokine-based cancer immunotherapies are hindered by the devastating side effects of systemic delivery of the cytokines. To address this problem, we previously described a novel approach to locally achieve high doses of interleukin-12 (IL-12) in tumors and demonstrated that bi-functional fusion protein mIL-12/FasTI expressed by stable clones of TC-1 cells efficiently suppressed tumor proliferation by activating natural killer (NK) cells and other cytolytic killer cells and sending apoptotic signals into tumor cells. In the present study, we employed a lentiviral vector-based gene delivery system to deliver this fusion construct directly into tumor cells. We show that lentiviral vector efficiently delivers the fusion constructs into Hela cells in vitro as assayed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC). We also confirm that fusion protein mIL-12/FasTI delivered by the viral vector significantly enhanced killer cell activation, increased caspase-3 activity and decreased tumor growth in vitro. This study offers a further step for fusion protein cancer therapy for cancer patients."

Pedicularis delavayi was described from northwestern Yunnan, and widely adopted as a variety of P. siphonantha. Unfortunately, the name ""P. siphonantha var. delavayi' incorrectly referred to P. milliana (a new species described in this study) or P. tenuituba in some herbarium specimens and publications. Moreover, phylogenetic relationships among P. delavayi, P. siphonantha and its allies (P. milliana and P. tenuituba) were not fully resolved. In this study, we sampled 76 individuals representing 56 taxa. Of them, 10 taxa were from P. siphonantha lineage, and 11 individuals of P. delavayi represented 9 populations. These species were named as P. siphonantha group on the basis of morphological similarity. Nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (nrITS) and four chloroplast genes/regions were used for phylogenetic analyses. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the P. siphonantha group was polyphyletic: P. delavayi was sister to P. obliquigaleata in clade A; and the remaining species of P. siphonantha group were monophyletic in clade B, named as P. siphonantha lineage. In the P. siphonantha lineage, P. milliana, P. siphonantha, and P. tenuituba were well supported as monophyletic, and P. dolichosiphon was sister to P. leptosiphon. Morphologically, P. delavayi differs from species of the P. siphonantha lineage in having a long petiole (~ 50 mm) and pedicel (~ 40 mm), a ridged corolla tube, and a folded lower-lip of the corolla. Therefore, both morphological characters and phylogenetic evidence strongly supported to reinstate P. delavayi as an independent species and describe P. milliana as new species. In addition, P. neolatituba was proposed to reduce as a new synonymy of P. delavayi."

Assistive technology devices have been developed to allow such patients to obtain independence in oral self-care and can be a cost-effective approach to improving oral care in this population. The objective of this study was to describe the development of assistive devices to facilitate daily oral hygiene in older people with enduring leprosy-related impairments. Methodology Case study realized among elders with a history of leprosy residents in a former isolation colony in Betim, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The elders were evaluated for dependence on others for denture hygiene and mouthwash using the Daily Oral Hygiene Activity Index (ADOH). Those deemed partially or completely dependent on others were eligible for an intervention based on assistive technology. We adopted a personalized approach to each case, taking into account medical history, physical impairment and living environment. Six months after the intervention, the participants were assessed again using the ADOH and an unstructured interview about use of the devices. Principal findings Assistive devices for denture hygiene and mouthwash were developed for 16 elders. These devices facilitated oral hygiene in most patients and there was no worsening in any of the cases. Patients’ report suggested they were satisfied with the devices provided. Conclusions This study demonstrated that assistive devices can facilitate oral hygiene activities in leprosy patients. It also reinforces the importance of using a multidisciplinary team for the rehabilitation of these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2884773375,"One important organizational property of morphology is competition. Different means of expression are in conflict with each other for encoding the same grammatical function. In the current study, we examined the nature of this control mechanism by testing the formation of comparative adjectives in English during language production. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded during cued silent production, the first study of this kind for comparative adjective formation. We specifically examined the ERP correlates of producing synthetic relative to analytic comparatives, e.g. angrier vs. more angry. A frontal, bilaterally distributed, enhanced negative-going waveform for analytic comparatives (vis-a-vis synthetic ones) emerged approximately 300ms after the (silent) production cue. We argue that this ERP effect reflects a control mechanism that constrains grammatically-based computational processes (viz. more comparative formation). We also address the possibility that this particular ERP effect may belong to a family of previously observed negativities reflecting cognitive control monitoring, rather than morphological encoding processes per se."

The amplitude (Amp), phase shift (PS) and mean values of these kinetics were obtained by harmonic analysis. The mean values of all of these responses during walking at a sinusoidally changing speed became greater under hypoxia compared to normoxia (FiO2 = 21%), indicating that moderate hypoxia could achieve an increased energy expenditure (increased and ) and hyperventilation. The Amp values of the , , and kinetics were not significantly different between normoxia and hypoxia at most periods, although a significantly smaller Amp of the HR was observed at faster oscillation periods (1 or 2 min).The PS of the HR was significantly greater under hypoxia than normoxia at the 2, 5, and 10 min periods, whereas the PS of the , , and responses was not significantly different between normoxia and hypoxia at any period.

https://openalex.org/W2884068237,"The aim of this study was to identify factors associated to the duration of symptoms of cystitis.We conducted a nested survival study using Druti study data. Druti was a cross-sectional survey conducted in adult women visiting a general practitioner in France, for a suspected urinary tract infection between January 2012 and February 2013. For this study, urine cultures were systematically performed for all women. The evolution of symptoms were monitored daily for two weeks. This nested study considered only women with suspected cystitis from Druti; women with pyelonephritis were excluded. To identify independent predictors for duration of symptoms, a Cox proportional hazards regression model was performed.In Druti, 449 patients had a suspected cystitis. Among them, 440 had a follow up at two weeks. Out of the 440 patients, 424 had a prescription of antibiotic treatment (96.4%). The urine culture was positive for 326 patients (74.1%). The median duration of symptoms after consultation was two days (interquartile 1-3). The absence of urinary frequency (median two days versus three days, p = 0.008), age over 55 years (median two days versus three days, p<0.001) and patient's bet about the presence of a urinary tract infection (median two days, p = 0.021) were associated to a longer duration of symptoms. Positive culture (p = 0.99) and presence of a multi-drug resistant organism (p = 0.38) did not influence the duration of symptoms.In a real-life study, factors influencing the duration of symptoms are clinical factors.

Previous studies have not examined these factors in combination, especially within the urban context of sub-Sahara Africa, where the private sector is rapidly growing. This study aims to explore factors associated with urban residents' preferences between private MD-led and private nurse-led outpatient care and how these factors vary by type of private health facility ownership (FP and NFP) and levels of disease severity (severe and non-severe cases).A cross-sectional household survey was conducted in July-November 2011 on a random final sample of 2064 adults (646 households). We used a face-to-face interview to capture participants' choice of provider and their associated factors. A multivariable logistic regression was applied.For severe conditions, participants, almost equally sought FP and NFP facilities, only 36.4% preferred nurses compared to MDs, while for non-severe cases 53.2% preferred FP facilities and only 29.2% patronized nurses. For non-severe conditions, university educated were more likely to use MDs-led FP compared to nurse-led FP facilities (Odds Ratio [OR] = 4.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.62-8.30) and MD-led FP over MD-led NFP facilities (OR = 1.03, 95%CI = 1.01-1.04), for severe health conditions. Having insurance predicted MD-led FP preference over nurse-led FP. Furthermore, insurance predicted the preference for MD-led FP over MD-led NFP facilities. Employment did not distinguish participants' choice of provider.The findings suggest that, at different levels, MDs and nurses from FP and NFP facilities importantly contribute to health services delivery regardless of the severity of health conditions. The results offer some valuable evidence for policy orientation in the current rising tide of the private system, including workforce development, and practitioners' role definition. We suggested that health insurance mechanism would reinforce the private health services utilization and could enhance progress towards the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals."

However, a lack of access to care has not been considered when modeling the population. Populations at high risk for contracting HIV are twice as likely to lack access to reliable medical care. In this paper, we consider three contributors to the HIV population dynamics: at-risk population exhaustion, lack of access to care, and usage of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) by diagnosed individuals. An extant problem in the mathematical study of this system is deriving parameter estimates due to a portion of the population being unobserved. We approach this problem by looking at the proportional change in the infected subpopulations. We obtain conservative estimates for the proportional change of the infected subpopulations using hierarchical Bayesian statistics. The estimated proportional change is used to derive epidemic parameter estimates for a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Model fit is quantified to determine the best parametric explanation for the observed dynamics in the infected subpopulations. Parameter estimates derived using these methods produce simulations that closely follow the dynamics observed in the data, as well as values that are generally in agreement with prior understanding of transmission and diagnosis rates. Simulations suggest that the undiagnosed population may be larger than currently estimated without significantly affecting the population dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2884236921,"Knowledge about the spatial patterns and movements of crustaceans has gained importance since the creation of marine protected areas and the development of spatial management for benthic ecosystems. The Juan Fernández spiny lobster (Jasus frontalis) is an endemic marine species and most valuable resource that exhibits migratory dynamics in a highly spatially regulated fishery. To study movement patterns around Alexander Selkirk Island, a mark-recapture program was implemented in 2008, when approximately 7000 non-commercial (undersized) lobsters were tagged and followed for nearly 14 months. Using quantitative georeferenced data, this study revealed spatial structuring of Juan Fernández spiny lobster and tested hypotheses about alongshore and inshore-offshore movements. Eight clusters were identified around Alexander Selkirk Island, with moderate time-varying connectivity between them. Seasonal inshore-offshore movements were detected all around the island, but more conspicuously to the north. Average travelling distance was 1.2 km (1.7 sd). Our results confirmed that towards the end of austral spring males and females embark in a seasonal offshore migration to deeper waters, returning to shallower waters only during winter. These findings quantitatively consolidate the conceptual migratory model that local fishermen had already inferred for this resource from about a century of sustainable fishing."
