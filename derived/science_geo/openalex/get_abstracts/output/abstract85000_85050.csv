https://openalex.org/W1519470329,"Previous studies in a cell-free proteolytic system from reticulocytes indicated that the conjugation of ubiquitin with proteins plays a role in protein breakdown. To examine some of the physiological functions of the ubiquitin conjugation system, and immunochemical method was developed for the isolation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates from intact cells. A specific antiserum was raised against ubiquitin and purified by affinity chromatography on ubiquitin-Sepharose. When cells are labeled with tryptophan (which is missing from ubiquitin), labeled immunoreactive material isolated by the antibody is derived from the protein moiety of ubiquitin-protein conjugates. There is a marked increase in the labeling of ubiquitin-protein conjugates during the formation of abnormal proteins in reticulocytes (induced by the incorporation of amino acid analogs), suggesting that proteins with abnormal structure are more readily conjugated to ubiquitin than most normal proteins. Essentially similar, although less marked, effects of amino acid analogs were observed in Ehrlich ascites cells. When further protein synthesis was blocked with cycloheximide, ubiquitin conjugates decayed more extensively than the corresponding average labeled cellular proteins. This is consistent with the interpretation that a considerable part of ubiquitin conjugates is derived from a pool of rapidly degradable proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2014395675,"A cell line transformed by Abelson murine leukemia virus, called PD, is capable of carrying out κ-gene rearrangement while growing in culture. Subclones of PD have diverse κ-gene structures, and some derivatives show evidence of continued joining activity after as many as three subclonings. Analysis of PD sublineages has shown that a rearranged chromosome can undergo secondary κ-gene rearrangements, producing either a new rearrangement or a deletion of Cκ. Although the PD line actively rearranges its κ genes, its rearranged heavy-chain genes show little variation, and there is no rearrangement of λ genes. In PD subclones, DNA fragments representing the reciprocal product of κ-gene rearrangement are often evident, and they may undergo either further rearrangement or deletion. The implications of multiple rearrangements on a single chromosome and of the maintenance of reciprocal fragments are considered in the context of a model that postulates that the Vκ and Jκ segments are not all organized in the DNA in the same transcriptional direction, leading to inversions rather than deletions during joining."
https://openalex.org/W2089015567,"A cDNA clone of the mRNA encoding the glycoprotein (G) of vesicular stomatitis virus was inserted into plasmid vectors under the control of either the SV40 early promoter (pSV2G) or the SV40 late promoter (pSVGL). Synthesis of G protein was observed in mouse L cells injected with pSV2G DNA or in COS1 cells transfected with pSVGL DNA. Immunofluorescent staining of G protein produced in both cell types showed a pattern of internal and cell-surface staining indistinguishable from that seen in cells infected with vesicular stomatitis virus. The G protein produced in transfected COS1 cells was the size of normal G protein and was glycosylated. Expression of a G protein lacking 79 amino acids from the COOH terminus was also examined. This G protein lacks the transmembrane domain and the hydrophilic COOH terminus, which, we postulated, anchor G protein in the lipid bilayer. This ""anchorless"" protein is glycosylated and is secreted, albeit slowly."
https://openalex.org/W1989665007,"Synthesis of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor was studied by incubation of cultured human fibroblasts with 35S-methionine followed by immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antireceptor antibody. The receptor was synthesized as a precursor with an apparent molecular weight of 120 kilodaltons (kd) that was converted to a mature form of 160 kd. This novel form of processing occurred 15–30 min after synthesis and did not appear to be due to the simple addition of N-linked oligosaccharide chains. Fibroblasts from a child with the phenotype of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia showed a disruption in receptor processing. This child has two different mutant alleles at the LDL receptor locus. One allele, inherited from his heterozygous mother, produces an abnormal 120 kd protein that cannot be processed to the mature 160 kd form. The other allele, inherited from his heterozygous father, produces a receptor that is synthesized as an elongated 170 kd precursor which undergoes a 40 kd increase in molecular weight to form an abnormally large receptor of 210 kd."
https://openalex.org/W1574870186,"The endogenous retinoids associated with three cellular retinoid-binding proteins from bovine retina and retinal pigment epithelium have been identified by their spectral characteristics and their co-migration with authentic retinoids on high performance liquid chromatography. All-trans-retinol is the only retinoid associated with the cellular retinol-binding protein from retina and retinal pigment epithelium. The saturation of the binding site with native ligand is 0.95 +/- 0.05 mol of retinoid/mol of protein for cellular retinol-binding protein purified from frozen and fresh retina and retinal pigment epithelium. All-trans-retinoic acid has been identified as the endogenous ligand associated with the cellular retinoic acid-binding protein of cattle retina. The saturation of the binding site of cellular retinoic acid-binding protein from frozen and fresh retina (the protein is absent in extracts of retinal pigment epithelium) is about 0.2 mol of retinoid/mol of protein, probably a minimum value due to losses of the ligand. Retinoic acid has not been detected previously in retina. Cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein from retina purifies with two endogenous ligands which cochromatograph on high performance liquid chromatography with 11-cis-retinaldehyde and 11-cis-retinol and occur in a ratio of approximately 3:1, respectively. The binding site of cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein from frozen retina is nearly fully occupied with these two ligands (saturation greater than 0.9 mol of retinoids/mol of protein). In contrast, purified cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein from retinal pigment epithelium carries only 11-cis-retinaldehyde as an endogenous ligand. The saturation of the binding site with this ligand is greater than 0.95."
https://openalex.org/W1530113502,"Radioimmunoassays have been developed for cellular retinol-binding protein and cellular retinoic acid-binding protein, postulated mediators of vitamin A action in nonvisual functions. These assays are considerably more sensitive for detection and quantitation of these proteins than previous methods. The higher sensitivity has permitted the detection of cellular retinoic acid-binding protein in adult rat tissues previously considered negative. These include kidney, lung, and spleen. The only tissues negative for both binding proteins were adrenals, skeletal muscle, ileal mucosa, and serum. Assay of tissue levels of cellular retinol-binding protein and cellular retinoic acid-binding protein reveals them to be widely distributed throughout most organs of the rat. No tissue or sex differences in these proteins were detected in these studies."
https://openalex.org/W1611526608,"Lysosomes containing large amounts of the amino acid, cystine, were obtained from transformed, cultured, human lymphoblasts which had been exposed to cystine dimethyl ester. Lysosomal cystine efflux was greatly enhanced by exogenous ATP in cell lines from normal individuals. Cystine efflux was unresponsive to ATP in lysosomes from individuals with the disorder, cystinosis. Efflux of cystine from normal cell lysosomes was inhibited by both the ATP analog, 5-adenylylimidodiphosphate, and the proton translocator, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. Efflux was not affected by ouabain or oligomycin. Thus, lysosomal cystine efflux is dependent upon the functioning of a proton-pump ATPase. ATPase-dependent cystine efflux appears to be aberrant in cystinotic cell lysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W72700671,"The studies presented herein were aimed at characterizing the pathway involved in the internalization and degradation of human choriogonadotropin by cultured Leydig tumor cells. A quick biochemical method that differentiates between the surface-bound and internalized hormone was developed. Using this method and two hormone derivatives labeled exclusively (with 125I) in the alpha or beta subunits, it was possible to follow the fate of each hormone subunit during hormone binding, internalization, and degradation. The results show that the hormone is internalized in the intact form and that it reaches its place of degradation (presumably the lysosomes) in the intact form. The pathway for degradation of the internalized hormone is complex, and it appears to involve processing of one or both subunits of the intact hormone, followed by subunit dissociation and further degradation of the individual subunits. The alpha subunit is quickly degraded by the cells. The only detectable degradation products are extracellular amino acids. The beta subunit is degraded slower, and several intracellular degradation products are detectable before amino acids appear in the medium."
https://openalex.org/W1495101953,"The saxitoxin receptor of the sodium channel purified from rat bran contains three types of subunits: alpha with Mr approximately 270,000, beta 1 with Mr approximately 39,000, and beta 2 with Mr approximately 37,000. These are the only polypeptides which quantitatively co-migrate with the purified saxitoxin receptor during velocity sedimentation through sucrose gradients. beta 1 and beta 2 are often poorly resolved by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), but analysis of the effect of beta-mercaptoethanol on the migration is covalently attached to the alpha subunit by disulfide bonds while the beta 1 subunit is not. The alpha and beta subunits of the sodium channel were covalently labeled in situ in synaptosomes using a photoreactive derivative of scorpion toxin. Treatment of SDS-solubilized synaptosomes with beta-mercaptoethanol decreases the apparent molecular weight of the alpha subunit band without change in the amount of 125I-labeled scorpion toxin associated with either the alpha or beta subunit bands. These results indicate that the alpha and beta 1 subunits are labeled by scorpion toxin whereas beta 1 is not and that the beta 2 subunit is covalently attached to alpha by disulfide bonds in situ as well as in purified preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1538207723,"The ompB region on the Escherichia coli chromosome codes for two genes, ompR and envZ, which are required for the osmolarity sensitive biosynthetic regulation of the outer membrane matrix proteins (porins), OmpF and ompC. A part of the ompB region containing the ompR gene has been cloned (Wurtzel, E. T., Movva, N. R., Ross, F. L., and Inouye, M. (1981) J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1, 61-69). We have determined the DNA sequence, including the promoter and structural regions encompassed in a 1.3-kilobase pair Ava I-Eco RI subfragment. This fragment codes for the entire ompR gene as well as the 5' end of the envZ gene. The ompR gene codes for a protein of 32,489 daltons, consisting of 284 amino acid residues. This was confirmed by identifying the gene product by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and determining a partial amino acid sequence of the NH2-terminal region of the gene product. A sequence of 57 amino acid residues located in the COOH-terminal region of the protein is extremely basic. It contains 10 arginine plus lysine residues in contrast to 1 glutamic acid residue in this region. In vitro transcription of the DNA from this region indicates that ampR and envZ are co-transcribed as a polycistronic mRNA from a promoter located 5' to the ompR gene. Translation of the am pR gene terminates at two tandem TAS codons and translation of the envZ gene initiates 29 nucleotides downstream. Cloning of the promoter region of ompB at a site 5' to the structural portion of the beta-galactosidase gene indicates that transcription of ompB is under positive control by cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W2029707717,"The right repeat in Tn5, which encodes protein absolutely required for transposition, is also capable of inhibiting Tn5 transposition. Analysis of Tn5 mutants indicates that the left repeat is defective in supplying the transposition-inhibition function because of the sequence difference between the repeats located at nucleotide 1443; that the transposition-inhibition activity is a function of the quantity of right-repeat protein synthesis; that the smaller of the right-repeat proteins, protein 2, is sufficient for supplying the transposition-inhibition function (but not for the transposase activity); and that the transposition-inhibition function can act in trans, as opposed to the transposase activity, which functions efficiently only in cis. Gene fusion experiments indicate that the transposition-inhibition activity cannot be explained by autogenous regulation of right-repeat protein synthesis. Finally, immunoprecipitation assays of right-repeat protein-lacZ fusion proteins indicate that protein 2 is synthesized in significantly greater amounts than protein 1 in whole cells. This synthetic ratio may be important with respect to the control of Tn5 transposition."
https://openalex.org/W1527069372,"PC12 cells, a clonal rat pheochromocytoma cell line, possess voltage-dependent calcium channels that bind the high affinity dihydropyridine calcium antagonist [3H]nitrendipine and other calcium channel blockers. The binding is temperature-dependent and saturable, and shows no cooperativity. The calcium antagonists inhibit potassium-induced 45Ca uptake into the cells with approximately the same potencies as those needed to inhibit [3H]nitrendipine binding to cell membranes. The affinity of these compounds for the PC12 cell calcium channel is slightly lower than that reported for binding to brain and heart. Potassium-stimulated 45Ca uptake into PC12 cells is rapid, being half-maximal within 30 s at 20 degrees C. Different classes of calcium antagonists seem to block calcium flux at different sites on the calcium channel. A lower limit of the rate of calcium movement through a single channel is given. PC12 cells seem to be a suitable model system for the study of the pharmacology and biochemistry of the voltage-dependent calcium channel."
https://openalex.org/W1542489867,"Human interferon alpha A, produced in Escherichia coli by recombinant DNA technology, was labeled with 125I to study its binding to receptors on human lymphoblastoid Daudi cells. This binding showed a marked temperature dependency, with maximum binding obtained at 30-37 degrees C. About 60% of the cell-bound radioactivity was released upon subsequent addition of unlabeled interferon, indicating that only part of the cell-bound interferon could be displaced by competitor. Moreover, about 30-50% of cell-bound interferon was not released by treating the cells with 0.2 N acetic acid, a procedure which removes polypeptide hormones on the cell surface, indicating that part of the interferon bound at 37 degrees C was internalized. This interferon was slowly degraded to acid-soluble products, which were released into the culture medium. Treatment of DAudi cells with the lysosomotropic amines chloroquine and methylamine inhibited the degradation of interferon. Methylamine, however, also inhibited the internalization of interferon. Daudi cells treated with interferon in the presence of chloroquine showed an increase in the interferon-induced enzyme 2',5'-oligo(A) polymerase comparable to that of cells treated with interferon alone. This enzyme increased to a similar extent in cells treated with interferon and cytochalasin, a drug which inhibited internalization of interferon by 50%. These results suggest that degradation and possibly internalization of interferon are not required for at least some of its biological activities."
https://openalex.org/W1633786871,"A method has been developed for the isolation of sealed plasma membrane vesicles from rabbit white skeletal muscle. The final preparation was highly purified as indicated by enrichment of plasma membrane marker enzymes (i.e. ouabain-sensitive (Na+,K+)-ATPase, adenylate cyclase, and acetylcholinesterase). The absence of sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria as contaminants was indicated by the low specific activity of marker enzymes, i.e. Ca2+-ATPase, succinate-cytochrome c reductase, and monoamine oxidase. Thin section and negative staining electron microscopy confirmed the absence of sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial contamination. The plasma membrane preparation consisted largely of sealed vesicles as observed by electron microscopy and as also demonstrated by latency of enzymic activities, which were unmasked by preincubation with detergent (sodium dodecyl sulfate). Membrane sidedness was estimated from latency of ouabain-sensitive (Na+,K+)-ATPase activity and acetylcholinesterase activity. The latency studies suggest that most of the vesicles are oriented inside out with respect to the orientation of the sarcolemma membrane in the muscle fiber. The inside-out plasma membrane vesicles actively accumulated sodium ions upon addition of ATP. The sodium ions were concentrated greater than 8-fold inside the vesicles and were released upon addition of the ionophore monensin. The sodium ions were taken up in the presence of K+ or NH4+ but not of choline. Uptake was inhibited by low concentrations of vanadate or digitoxin. The Na+ uptake was concomitant with Rb+ efflux. Therefore, the sodium ion transport and the resulting gradients formed appear to have been generated by the ouabain-sensitive (Na+,K+)-ATPase. Batrachotoxin, which opens Na+ channels in excitable tissues, prevents most of the Na+ uptake, suggesting the presence of toxin-activated Na+ channels in these plasma membrane vesicles."

https://openalex.org/W1606963643,"The effect of H2O2, Cl-, and pH on human myeloperoxidase activity has been examined. The Km for H2O2 is shown to be affected by the combined presence of Cl- and acid pH conditions. The Km for H2O2 is independent of pH in the absence of Cl- and dependent on pH in the presence of Cl-. Conversely, the dependence of the Km for H2O2 on Cl- concentration increases as the pH decreases. A model is proposed in which Cl- has a dual role, acting both as a substrate and as an inhibitor. According to this model, the inhibitor Cl- binding site must be protonated prior to the binding of Cl- and is distinct from the substrate Cl- binding site which is unaffected by pH. The rate equation derived from this model is used to further analyze the data presented. The values of Km for H2O2 predicted by the rate equation are in good agreement with the experimentally determined values."
https://openalex.org/W1563195770,"The Escherichia coli dnaB and dnaC proteins form a tight complex in the presence of ATP (Wickner, S., and Hurwitz, J., (1975) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 72, 921-925). The complexed dnaC protein is resistant to inhibition by the sulfhydryl reagent, N-ethylmaleimide. This protection is not observed when ATP is substituted by AMP, ADP, adenyl 5'-yl imidodiphosphate, or adenosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); dATP provides partial protection. A sedimentation coefficient of 15.2 S determined by glycerol gradient sedimentation and a Stokes radius of 64 A determined by gel filtration suggests a molecular weight in the range of 400,000. The complex isolated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography contains six dnaC protein monomers of 29,000 daltons contains six dnaC protein monomers of 29,000 daltons contains six dnaC protein monomers of 29,000 daltons per dnaB protein hexamer (300,000 daltons) consistent with a calculated weight of 474,000. The isolated dnaB-dnaC protein complex functions in vitro in the replication of phage phi X174 single-stranded DNA to the duplex replicative form. Tritium-labeled dnaC protein, absent from an isolated prepriming com-dnaC protein, absent from an isolated prepriming complex intermediate, was nevertheless bound to the phiX replicative form DNA synthesized in vitro. These results suggest that stable inclusion od dnaC protein in the priming complex bound to DNA requires a completely assembled primosome."
https://openalex.org/W2079925920,"The transposon Tn5 consists of inverted repeats, called IS50R and IS50L, each of which encode two proteins. We show here that the larger protein encoded on IS50R, protein 1, is absolutely required for transposition. Deletion or insertion mutants that fail to make this protein fail to promote gene movement. In addition, this protein acts in cis preferentially. We also show that the smaller protein encoded on IS50R, protein 2, is competent to inhibit transposition of a Tn5 freshly introduced into the cell on a λ phage. In contrast, the proteins from IS50L possess neither of these two activities. By assaying expression of proteins that are hybrids between β-galactosidase and IS50R proteins, we find that the regulation of transposition cannot be due to the inhibitor repressing synthesis of Tn5 proteins. Control experiments, in which we assay synthesis of IS50 proteins synthesized from a λ::IS50R that has been infected into cells carrying the transposition inhibitor, confirm this conclusion."

https://openalex.org/W1581952926,"The binding of 125I-labeled alpha A interferon to human lymphoblastoid Daudi cells decreased when these cells were incubated with unlabeled alpha or beta interferon. This decrease could not be accounted for by the occupancy of interferon receptors with unlabeled interferon and it apparently resulted from the loss or down-regulation of receptors. The binding activity gradually increased when Daudi cells were incubated in fresh medium after a treatment with interferon, but inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide prevented this recovery. Treatment of Daudi cells with this inhibitor resulted in the loss of half the interferon binding activity within 5 h. These findings suggested that the interferon receptors turn over at a basal rate in interferon-free medium and at an increased rate in cells incubated with interferon. The dose-response for the down-regulation was investigated by treating Daudi cells with different concentrations of alpha interferon. Down-regulation was observed in cells treated with relatively low doses of interferon, sufficient to elicit a biological response. The synthesis of the enzyme (2',5')oligo(A) polymerase was induced at the lowest interferon concentrations tested which caused receptor down-regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1582921669,"A segment of the Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) genome was inserted into an Escherichia coli plasmid designed to allow the expression of the protein encoded by the viral gene. Bacteria expressing the A-MuLV-encoded protein were isolated; they had new phosphorylated proteins in which the phosphate was linked to tyrosine residues. These proteins included many that must be E. coli protein. One phosphotyrosine-containing protein of 62,000 molecular weight had reactivity with antiserum specific for authentic A-MuLV protein. The A-MuLV protein thus appears to be a tyrosine-specific protein kinase which is active in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W2059780474,"Octopine-type tumor tissue was obtained both by infection of plants or isolated protoplasts with Agrobacterium tumefaciens and by somatic hybridization of normal and crown gall tobacco cells. Analysis of T-DNA by Southern blotting of clones and uncloned tissue reveals that, whereas tumors induced on plants are heterogeneous mixtures of cells differing in T-DNA organization, each tissue derived from transformed protoplasts or from somatic hybridization is homogeneous. Detailed analysis of T-DNA organization showed that TL- or ""core"" T-DNA was always present at one or two copies per diploid genome. However, sometimes it was present in a modified form, either deleted, extended, tandemly duplicated or probably methylated. TR-DNA was not detected. The observed variation in the organization of T-DNA in octopine crown gall tissue did not appear to be a characteristic of the way the tissue was derived."
https://openalex.org/W1581044592,"Treatment of leukotriene A4 (LTA4) methyl ester with sodium hydroxide in aqueous methanol at 4 degrees C afforded LTA4, the presence of which was inferred from the UV spectrum of the compound, its rate of reaction with water, and the identity of the hydration products obtained. The half-life of LTA4 in water (pH 7.4, room temperature) was increased from 14 to 500 s by 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin. This stabilized (chiral) LTA4 was converted to LTB4 by an epoxide hydrolase activity in the 100,000 x g supernatant fraction from sonified rat basophilic leukemia cells. Neither the ester of LTA4 nor the biologically incorrect enantiomer of LTA4 was metabolized to LTB4 under these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1574086163,"The extracellular matrix, prepared by extraction of confluent cultures of human lung WI-38 fibroblasts with a dipolar tonic detergent, contains four major glycoproteins: fibronectin, GP250, GP170, and GP140. All the glycoproteins can be surface-labeled; however, only fibronectin and GP170 can be readily removed by digestion with trypsin (Carter, W. G., and Hakomori, S. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 6953-6960). Most of the noncovalently bound GP250, GP170, and GP190, an additional minor glycoprotein, can be dissociated from the matrix by extraction with 8 M urea. The remaining insoluble matrix is stabilized by extensive intermolecular disulfide bonds and contains primarily GP140 and fibronectin (Carter, W. G. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 3249-3257). Affinity-purified, monospecific antibodies were prepared against GP[140 and fibronectin and utilized for detection of GP140 and fibronectin in extracts and conditioned media of WI-38, WI-38 VA13, WI-26, WI-26 VA4, and HT-1080 cells. Additional affinity-purified, polyspecific antibodies that react with GP250, GP190 GP170, and GP140 were also utilized. Fibronectin, GP250, GP190, GP170, and GP140 were all absent from transformed cells. With the exception of GP140, the absence of these glycoproteins from the matrix of transformed cells was paralleled by their accumulation in the conditioned culture media. Incubation of conditioned culture media with collagenase indicated that GP190, GP170, and GP140, as well as other glycoproteins, were digested. Antibodies to GP140 did not react with any other cellular component indicating that it is not a processing product of other matrix glycoproteins. GP140 has characteristics unlike all reported collagen types and appears to be a new collagen-like glycoprotein. In contrast, neither Gp250 nor fibronectin were sensitive to digestion with collagenase. Antibodies that react with GP250 did not react with fibronectin and vice versa, suggesting that GP250 and fibronectin do not share antigenic determinants. The interaction of labeled fibronectin and the labeled, gelatin-binding domain of fibronectin with cells after fractionation on polyacrylamide gels indicated that GP170 is the primary procollagen receptor for fibronectin in the extracellular matrix. GP140 also bound fibronectin but to a lesser degree. Soluble GP170 and GP190 present in the conditioned medium of cultured cells also bound to insolubilized fronectin, confirming the association of GP170 and GP190 with fibronectin. The interaction of the glycoprotein components in the matrix are discussed in relation to their potential cooperative function in cell attachment and their failure to adhere to the surface of transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W2105601424,"Cloned DNA containing 22.2 kb of the chicken lysozyme gene region was screened with use of a nitrocellulose filter binding technique for specific recognition by nuclear DNA binding proteins from chicken oviduct cells. The analysis showed specific retention of four restriction fragments (BS1-BS4), which map approximately 6.1 and 3.9 kb upstream from the transcription start, and 2.8 and 6.2 kb downstream from the poly(A)-addition point of the lysozyme gene. The four DNA fragments mutually served as efficient competitors, indicating that only one class of proteins is involved in the recognition of all four sites. An apparent binding constant of KD = 6 X 10(-12) M was estimated for one of the binding fragments (BS1). Fine mapping of this fragment resolved two closely spaced contact areas at least 43 bp apart."

The binding was dependent on time and temperature, equilibrium being reached after 5 min at 37 degrees C. The specific binding constituted about 70% of the total binding at 37 degrees C, and 55% at 0 degrees C. The maximal binding was obtained in the presence of 100 mM sodium ion and at pH 8. The equilibrium dissociation constant and the maximal concentration of binding sites as determined by Scatchard analysis were 28 +/- 7 nM and 0.45 pmol/mg of protein (n = 3), respectively. Hill coefficient was 1.15, indicating a single entity of binding sites and no cooperativity. The binding sites were highly specific for PGD2; the Ki values for PGD1 and PGF2 alpha were 523 and 693 nM, respectively. Other PGs including 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGD2, an inactive metabolite of PGD2, had 150- to 1000-fold lower affinities than PGD2. The binding was inhibited by boiling or treatment with proteases, phospholipases, or beta-galactosidase. The specific activity of PGD2 binding was highest in the pituitary gland, followed by the hypothalamus and the olfactory bulb od the rat brain, this pattern being almost parallel to that of the cytosolic NADP-linked PGD2 dehydrogenase activity. The results suggest that PGD2 plays a significant role in these regions of the rat brain."

In order to determine if this protein was related to pp60src, the transformation-specific protein from Rous sarcoma virus, partial proteolysis maps of in vitro 32P-labeled pp58 and pp60src were prepared using Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease and papain. The maps were clearly different, indicating the pp58 is distinct from pp60src. However characterization of the tryptic fragment containing the single site of in vitro tyrosine phosphorylation in pp58 has revealed that the amino acid sequence around this site is extremely homologous to, if not identical with the sequence around the site of tyrosine phosphorylation in pp60src."

The activity was assayed by complementation of a mutant dnaC extract or by reconstitution of a purified protein system which converts phi X174 single-stranded DNA to the duplex replicative form. In this conversion the dnaC protein is required during the initial prepriming stage of phi X174 DNA replication. Antiserum against dnaC protein specifically inhibits this stage but not the subsequent priming and elongation steps carried out by primase and the PolIII holoenzyme. Requirement for dnaC protein was also manifested in the in vitro replication of a plasmid DNA containing the E. coli origin of replication (oriC) by complementation of a mutant extract and specific inhibition by dnaC antiserum."

Upon excitation at 330-350 nm, these derivatives exhibited maximum fluorescence emission at 430-445 nm in aqueous solution with quantum yields of 0.11-0.26. Their fluorescence was sensitive to the polarity of solvent; in N,N-dimethylformamide quantum yields of 0.8-0.95. The major differences between the two fluorophores were the longer wavelength of the emission maximum of the N-methylanthraniloyl group and its greater quantum yield. The derivatives were substrates for beef heart cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, 15-24% as effective as the natural substrate cAMP. When combined with thin layer chromatography techniques, two apparent Km values (3-4 microM and 36-76 microM) for the cAMP derivatives and one value (10-18 microM) for the cGMP derivatives were obtained. The results indicate that these 2'-hydroxyl-modified cAMP and cGMP can be useful fluorescent substrate analogs for cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase."
https://openalex.org/W1528445472,"Myeloperoxidase, HeO2, and a halide (chloride, bromide, iodide) constitute a powerful microbicidal system which is active against a wide variety of microorganisms and is believed to contribute to the antimicrobial activity of neutrophils. The precise mechanism by which this system exerts its toxicity is unknown. We report here that the microbicidal activity of the myeloperoxidase-H2O-chloride system on Escherichia coli is associated with the loss of iron into the medium as measured by the release of 59Fe from prelabeled organisms. Iron loss (but not bactericidal activity) was considerably increased by the addition of EDTA or other iron chelators; it was not associated with a corresponding release of protein with 14C-amino-acids. Iron loss was observed with chloride or bromide as the halide, but not when iodide was employed in microbicidal concentrations. Microbicidal activity was detected at an earlier time period and at a lower halide concentration than was iron loss. Analogous changes were observed when cytochrome c was oxidized by the myeloperoxidase H2O2-halide system. The initial response was a shift in the Soret maximum, followed by a fall in absorbance accompanied by the loss of iron. As with the intact organism, iron loss was evident with chloride and bromide, but not with iodide as the halide. These findings suggest that microbial iron centers are a target for the myeloperoxidase-mediated antimicrobial system and that their oxidation may contribute to microbicidal activity."
https://openalex.org/W1600908381,"HpCl, a Charon 4A bacteriophage containing a 16.3-kilobase insert of human genomic DNA, has been identified as representing the 3' portion of the human alpha 2(I) collagen gene by hybrid selected translation and cross-reactivity with characterized sheep and chick collagen genes. Evaluation of HpCl by restriction endonuclease mapping and alpha 2(I) mRNA hybridization demonstrated that the alpha 2(I) mRNA coding regions are separated by noncoding regions including one of 2.7 kilobase pairs near the 3' end of the mRNA coding region. In addition, a 1.8-kilobase XbaI-BamHI fragment containing the 2' a 1.8-kilobase XbaI-BamHI fragment containing the 3' end of the alpha 2(I) mRNA coding region includes a region of DNA that is repeated many times throughout the human genome. Quantification of alpha 2(I) gene number, using the technique of DNA dot hybridization, with two EcoRI fragments from HpClo as probes, demonstrated that HpCl is represented once in the human genome. In this context, it is unlikely that human alpha 2(I) collagen chain production is modulated by differential transcription of multiple alpha 2(I) genes."
https://openalex.org/W1608852935,"Isolated rat liver cells maintained in suspension culture for 4 to 5 h synthesize the gluconeogenic cytosolic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase at a rate approximately 5-fold lower than the in vivo hepatic rate. Glucagon rapidly re-induces phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase synthesis in such cells. The rate of enzyme synthesis doubles in 40 min and plateaus at a level 6- to 13-fold higher than in control cells 120 min after glucagon addition at maximal concentration. Consistent with the presumed role of cyclic AMP as a mediator of enzyme induction, the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, added simultaneously with glucagon, shifts the hormone dose-response curve 2 log units to the left. Moreover, cyclic AMP supplied exogenously to the cells mimics the inductive effect of glucagon. Total cellular RNA isolated from hepatocytes induced by glucagon contains an increased level of mRNA coding for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, as determined by translational assay. The kinetics and extent of the rise in mRNA level are adequate to explain the stimulation of enzyme synthesis. Although glucagon on its own induces a build-up of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA and a commensurate stimulation of enzyme synthesis, the glucagon induction is very markedly amplified when the cells are first preincubated with dexamethasone. The glucocorticoid by itself, however, does not have any substantial effect on the level of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA or on the rate of enzyme synthesis. Its role can therefore be characterized as permissive."

Complexes of VPg-related polypeptide and newly made RNA could be immunoprecipitated by anti-VPg antibody from the host-factor-stimulated products of the replicase reaction. The complexes appeared to be covalently linked and involved 50 to 150 nucleotide chains of RNA that were RNAase-T1-resistant and could be largely poly(U)."
https://openalex.org/W1623414689,"Monoclonal antibodies (CGS-1, 2, 3, and 4) and rabbit antisera have been produced against bovine heart cyclic GMP-stimulated cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase. The monoclonal antibodies were all of the IgG1 subclass and had relatively high affinities (kd values, 1-5 X 10(-10) M), making them suitable for many sensitive immunological and analytical procedures. Most of the monoclonal antibodies did not inhibit the enzyme, which allowed a rapid and specific assay for this form of phosphodiesterase to be developed. All of the activity could be adsorbed from purified preparations of cGMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase by each of the antibodies indicating antigenic homogeneity of the cGMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase. Neither the monoclonal antibodies nor the antisera inhibited cGMP-binding to the phosphodiesterase. Substrate specificity, Electrophoresis, and cyclic GMP binding studies carried out on immunoadsorbed material indicated that a major part of the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity present in bovine lung was due to the cyclic GMP-stimulated form. The presence of this enzyme was difficult to identify by other more common procedures and has not been previously demonstrated in this tissue. These studies also indicated that the cGMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase was immunologically distinct from the other major cGMP-binding proteins present in lung extract and that it could be separated from these binding proteins by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. Finally, the data suggest that none of the other peaks of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity, seen upon DEAE-cellulose fractionation of lung extracts, contain the immunological determinants present on the cGMP-stimulated form which are recognized by the antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W1557573585,"Specific receptors and metabolic responses to luteinizing hormone (LH) were analyzed in testicular Leydig cells purified by centrifugation of collagenase-dispersed rat interstitial cells on density gradients of 14-32% Metrizamide. This procedure separated the interstitial cells into an upper, poorly responsive fraction and a lower, more dense population with high LH receptor content and prominent cyclic AMP and testosterone responses of gonadotropic stimulation. The upper layer consisted of morphologically heterogeneous and extensively vacuolated cells, of which relatively few were structurally identifiable as Leydig cells. The lower layer was comprised of almost homogenous Leydig cells when analyzed by electron microscopy and autoradiography, and sedimented as two adjacent bands with similar hormonal responses and densities of 1.085 and 1.105 g/cm3. The lighter and less responsive cell population appeared to result from the presence of damaged cells in the interstitial cell preparation and could be removed during density gradient isolation of the homogeneous and biologically active Leydig cell fraction. The more dense and active Leydig cell population retained hormonal responsiveness during culture for 24 h and showed loss of LH receptors and low concentrations of gonadotropin in vitro. These findings emphasize the importance of appropriate fractionation of rat interstitial cells to isolate the structurally intact and functionally active population of Leydig cells during studies on LH receptors and section in the testis."

https://openalex.org/W186259361,"High and low spin complexes of ferric and ferrous heme a have been prepared and characterized spectroscopically. Bis(1-methylimidazole) heme a provides a good model for cytochrome a in both oxidation states while several spectral properties of cytochrome a3 can be reproduced by 1,2-dimethylimidazole heme a3. The visible absorbance spectra of these analogs account well for the absorbance spectra of oxidized and reduced cytochrome oxidase and support the conclusion (Vanneste, W. (1966) Biochemistry 5, 838-848) that cytochrome a provides the major contribution to the spectral changes in the 600 nm band upon reduction. The 655 nm band present in cytochrome oxidase appears to be a characteristic of high spin heme a+3."
https://openalex.org/W2170563251,"Human lymphoblasts lose >90% of their plasma membrane 5’-nucleotidase activity within 24 h when grown in zinc-deficient (<0.05 ~LM Zn(I1)) culture media prepared with either bovine serum albumin/fatty acids/ transferrin or with extensively dialyzed fetal bovine serum as supplements. The loss of 5’-nucleotidase activity is accompanied by a decrease in substrate affinity. The inactivation of plasma membrane 5’-nucleotidase is temperature dependent and requires the metabolically active cell. When isolated plasma membranes are incubated under the same conditions as the whole cells, they do not lose their 5‘-nucleotidase activity. Supplementation of the zinc-deficient culture media with 10 p~ zinc prevents the loss of 5’-nucleotidase activity. Addition of 10 p~ zinc to zinc-deficient cells or plasma membranes prepared from cells with low 5’nucleotidase activity due to zinc depletion leads to complete recovery of activity within 24 h. The recovery is not prevented by inhibition of protein synthesis. The reactivation of 5’-nucleotidase shows a dependence on temperature which is clearly distinct from the inactivation process. The addition of Co(II), Cu(II), or Cd(I1) to zinc-deficient cultures leads to some activation of 5’nucleotidase, but none of the divalent cations tested were nearly as effective as zinc. The observed changes in 5’-nucleotidase activity were not found in other divalent cation-requiring plasma membrane enzymes (ATPase, alkaline phosphatase). Our findings suggest that 1) plasma membrane 5’-nucleotidase can exist as an inactive apoenzyme and 2) zinc plays a unique role in the expression of plasma membrane 5’-nucleotidase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1511827139,"The interaction of the beta-adrenergic receptor (R) with different forms of the regulatory protein (G) was studied. For this purpose, the reconstituted system formed from separate soluble preparations of R and G was employed (Citri, Y., and Schramm, M. (1980) Nature (Lond.) 287, 297-300). Soluble preparations of the native nonactive G, to which GDP is bound (GGDP), and the persistently active G, to which guanyl-5'-yl-imidophosphate (Gpp(NH)p) is bound GGPP(MH)P), were prepared. Reconstituted systems made of GGDP, GGPP(NH)P, and R were used to test whether each of the two forms of G can affect the other's interaction with R. GGPP(NH)P was found to compete with GGDP for the interaction with R. However, GGDP was unable to interfere with the interaction of R with GGPP(NH)P. Similar experiments were carried out with another persistently active G (GGTP gamma S). In sharp contrast to GGPP(NH)P, GGTP gamma S was found incapable of competing with GGDP for R. The above experiments suggest that GGDP and GGPP(NH)P interact with the same coupling site on R. However, the degree of recognition of G by R depends strongly on the guanyl nucleotide which is bound to G. The relative order of recognition being GGPP(NH)P greater than GGDP greater than GGTP gamma S approximately 0. These findings may also explain the known irreversible effects of GTP gamma S in the adenylate cyclase system."
https://openalex.org/W1598835488,"Iodinated native bovine parathyroid hormone (bPTH(1-84)) was separated from uniodinated hormone by reversed-phase liquid chromatography techniques after lactoperoxidase labeling. Analysis of iodinated residues after enzymatic digestion indicated that the major labeled product was largely monoiodinated on the sole tyrosine residue. This material retained full bioactivity in an in vitro renal adenylate cyclase assay. Binding of 125I-bPTH(1-84) to rabbit renal membranes at 4 degrees C was proportional to membrane protein concentration and was saturable and dissociable. Radioligand binding was inhibited by concentrations of unlabeled bPTH(1-84) required to stimulate adenylate cyclase in the same membrane preparation but was not inhibited by non-PTH peptides other than adrenocorticotropin at high concentrations (greater than 10 microM). Synthetic NH2-terminal analogues of bPTH(1-84) all elicited approximately equivalent inhibition of radioligand binding which was, however, less potent than unlabeled bPTH(1-84), suggesting a role for the carboxyl region of the molecule in the interaction of bPTH(1-84) with its receptor. Activity of the NH2-terminal agonists was similar to bPTH(1-84) in stimulating adenylate cyclase. Although substitution in sequence position one, of serine in human PTH(1-34) for alanine in bPTH(1-34), reduced activity in the adenylate cyclase assay, inhibition of 125I-bPTH(1-84) binding by both peptides and by an analogue of bPTH(3-34) was equivalent, consistent with a minimal contribution of the first 2 residues for receptor binding of the NH2-terminal region of PTH. The results illustrate the utility of the radiolabeled preparation of native bPTH we have developed and emphasize the importance of probing the PTH receptor with an intact hormone to maximize information concerning the mechanism of PTH action."

https://openalex.org/W1674735933,"Phosphorylase kinase from rabbit skeletal muscle can be phosphorylated and activated by a cyclic nucleotide- and Ca2+-independent protein kinase previously identified as a glycogen synthase kinase (Itarte, E., and Huang, K.-P. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 4052-4057). This independent kinase phosphorylates the beta subunit of phosphorylase kinase approximately 15 times faster than it does the alpha subunit. The cAMP-dependent and -independent kinases separately catalyze the incorporation of 1 mol of phosphate into the beta subunit. Analyses of the tryptic peptides from the beta subunit phosphorylated with either kinase by isoelectric focusing and peptide mapping indicate that both kinases phosphorylate the same site on the beta subunit. Activation of phosphorylase kinase catalyzed by the independent kinase is only 60% of that observed with cAMP-dependent kinase. If phosphorylase kinase is first incubated with the independent kinase to phosphorylate the beta subunit, subsequent addition of cAMP-dependent kinase results in a predominant phosphorylation of the alpha subunit. This additional phosphorylation of the alpha subunit is accompanied by a further activation of the alpha subunit is accompanied by a further activation of phosphorylase kinase to the same extent as that achieved by cAMP-dependent kinase alone. Hence, the phosphorylation of the alpha subunit is clearly required for full activation of phosphorylase kinase, even at low [Mg2+]."
