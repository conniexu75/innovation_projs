https://openalex.org/W2165810797,"The authors analyze a large corpus of the neuroscience literature and demonstrate that nearly half of the published studies considered incorrectly compared effect sizes by comparing their significance levels. In theory, a comparison of two experimental effects requires a statistical test on their difference. In practice, this comparison is often based on an incorrect procedure involving two separate tests in which researchers conclude that effects differ when one effect is significant (P < 0.05) but the other is not (P > 0.05). We reviewed 513 behavioral, systems and cognitive neuroscience articles in five top-ranking journals (Science, Nature, Nature Neuroscience, Neuron and The Journal of Neuroscience) and found that 78 used the correct procedure and 79 used the incorrect procedure. An additional analysis suggests that incorrect analyses of interactions are even more common in cellular and molecular neuroscience. We discuss scenarios in which the erroneous procedure is particularly beguiling."
https://openalex.org/W2028169108,"Cellular senescence suppresses cancer by preventing the proliferation of cells that experience potentially oncogenic stimuli. Senescent cells often express p16(INK4a), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, tumor suppressor, and biomarker of aging, which renders the senescence growth arrest irreversible. Senescent cells also acquire a complex phenotype that includes the secretion of many cytokines, growth factors, and proteases, termed a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The SASP is proposed to underlie age-related pathologies, including, ironically, late life cancer. Here, we show that ectopic expression of p16(INK4a) and another cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21(CIP1/WAF1), induces senescence without a SASP, even though they induced other features of senescence, including a stable growth arrest. Additionally, human fibroblasts induced to senesce by ionizing radiation or oncogenic RAS developed a SASP regardless of whether they expressed p16(INK4a). Cells induced to senesce by ectopic p16(INK4a) expression lacked paracrine activity on epithelial cells, consistent with the absence of a functional SASP. Nonetheless, expression of p16(INK4a) by cells undergoing replicative senescence limited the accumulation of DNA damage and premature cytokine secretion, suggesting an indirect role for p16(INK4a) in suppressing the SASP. These findings suggest that p16(INK4a)-positive cells may not always harbor a SASP in vivo and, furthermore, that the SASP is not a consequence of p16(INK4a) activation or senescence per se, but rather is a damage response that is separable from the growth arrest."
https://openalex.org/W1976248697,"Tumor recurrence after chemotherapy or radiation remains a major obstacle to successful cancer treatment. A subset of cancer cells, termed cancer stem cells, can elude conventional treatments and eventually regenerate a tumor that is more aggressive. Despite the large number of studies, molecular events that govern the emergence of aggressive therapy-resistant cells with stem cell properties after chemotherapy are poorly defined. The present study provides evidence for the rare escape of tumor cells from drug-induced cell death, after an intermediate stay in a non-cycling senescent stage followed by unstable multiplication characterized by spontaneous cell death. However, some cells appear to escape and generate stable colonies with an aggressive tumor stem cell-like phenotype. These cells displayed higher CD133 and Oct-4 expression. Notably, the drug-selected cells that contained low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) also showed an increase in antioxidant enzymes. Consistent with this in vitro experimental data, we observed lower levels of ROS in breast tumors obtained after neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with samples that did not receive preoperative chemotherapy. These latter tissues also expressed enhanced levels of ROS defenses with enhanced expression of superoxide dismutase. Higher levels of Oct-4 and CD133 were also observed in tumors obtained after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Further studies provided evidence for the stabilization of Nrf2 due to reduced 26 S proteasome activity and increased p21 association as the driving signaling event that contributes to the transition from a high ROS quiescent state to a low ROS proliferating stage in drug-induced tumor stem cell enrichment."
https://openalex.org/W1992014522,"NALP3 inflammasome, composed of the three proteins NALP3, ASC, and Caspase-1, is a macromolecular complex responsible for the innate immune response against infection with bacterial and viral pathogens. Formation of the inflammasome can lead to the activation of inflammatory caspases, such as Caspase-1, which then activate pro-inflammatory cytokines by proteolytic cleavage. The assembly of the NALP3 inflammasome depends on the protein-interacting domain known as the death domain superfamily. NALP3 inflammasome is assembled via a pyrin domain (PYD)/PYD interaction between ASC and NALP3 and a caspase recruitment domain/caspase recruitment domain interaction between ASC and Caspase-1. As a first step toward elucidating the molecular mechanisms of inflammatory caspase activation by formation of inflammasome, we report the crystal structure of the PYD from NALP3 at 1.7-Å resolution. Although NALP3 PYD has the canonical six-helical bundle structural fold similar to other PYDs, the high resolution structure reveals the possible biologically important homodimeric interface and the dynamic properties of the fold. Comparison with other PYD structures shows both similarities and differences that may be functionally relevant. Structural and sequence analyses further implicate conserved surface residues in NALP3 PYD for ASC interaction and inflammasome assembly. The most interesting aspect of the structure was the unexpected disulfide bond between Cys-8 and Cys-108, which might be important for regulation of the activity of NALP3 by redox potential.

Currently, four distinct inflammasomes have been identified as follows: the NALP1 inflammasome, the NALP2 inflammasome, the NALP3 inflammasome, and AIM2 inflammasome (6Fernandes-Alnemri T. Yu J.W. Datta P. Wu J. Alnemri E.S. Nature. 2009; 458: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). The most studied among these is the NALP3 inflammasome, which is activated by several bacterial ligands, nucleic acids, synthetic antiviral compounds, cellular toxins, and some Toll-like receptor agonists (7Kolly L.

The critical function of the NALP3 inflammasome in the cell has been well indicated by studying a relationship between mutations within the NALP3 gene with autoinflammatory diseases.

NALP3 contains N-terminal PYD (pyrin domain), a central NACHT (NAIP, CIITA, HET-E, and TP1), and a C-terminal leucine-rich region and performs an important role in sensing signal and oligomerization (12Martinon F. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2008; 83: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). ASC is a bipartite adaptor protein containing an N-terminal PYD domain and a C-terminal CARD domain and plays a role in connecting NALP3 and Caspase-1 (13Shiohara M. Taniguchi S. Masumoto J. Yasui K.

The assembly of the NALP3 inflammasome depends on the protein interacting domain known as the death domain superfamily, which is composed of the following four subfamilies: death domain (DD), death effector domain (DED), caspase-recruitment domain (CARD), and PYD (17Park H.H.

Apoptosis. 2011; 16: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Death domain superfamily is the one of the biggest families of protein domains and highly prevalent in apoptotic and inflammatory signaling proteins (19Damiano J.S. Reed J.C. Curr. Drug Targets. 2004; 5: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). NALP3 inflammasome is assembled via a PYD/PYD interaction between ASC and NALP3 and a CARD/CARD interaction between ASC and Caspase-1 (3Martinon F. Burns K. Tschopp J. Mol.

Despite the fundamental importance of the inflammasome, including NALP3 inflammasome in innate immunity and many immune disorders, limited structural information is available. Moreover, several reported PYD structures were derived from studies by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). These include the PYD of NALP1 (21Hiller S. Kohl A. Fiorito F. Herrmann T. Wider G. Tschopp J.

Chem. 2006; 281: 31863-31875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Structural studies of the PYD domain and the PYD/PYD interaction have been difficult because PYD domains are subject to self-aggregation under physiological conditions (26Jang T.H. Park H.H. J. Biotechnol. 2011; 151: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although several DD superfamily complex structures have been reported, no structural information is available for PYD complexes. The structural studies of many PYDs are essential for understanding the molecular basis of inflammation signaling. Here, we report the first crystal structure of NALP3 PYD at 1.7 Å resolution. Although NALP3 PYD has the canonical six-helical bundle structural fold similar to other PYDs, the high resolution structure reveals possible biologically important homodimeric interface and the dynamic properties of the fold. Comparison with other PYD structures showed both similarities and differences that may be functionally relevant. Structural and sequence analyses further implicated conserved surface residues in NALP3 PYD, many of which are hydrophobic and charged, for ASC interaction and inflammasome assembly. The most interesting aspect of the structure was the unexpected disulfide bond between Cys-8 and Cys-108, which might be important for regulation of the activity of NALP3 by redox potential. The expression and purification methods used in this study have been described elsewhere in detail. In summary, human NALP3 PYD (amino acids 3–110) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE 3) by overnight induction at 20 °C. The protein contained a C-terminal His tag and was purified by nickel affinity and gel filtration chromatography. Superose 6 gel filtration column 10/30 (GE healthcare) that had been pre-equilibrated with a solution of 20 mm sodium citrate at pH 5.0 and 150 mm NaCl was used. The protein was concentrated to 6–8 mg/ml. The molar mass of NALP3 PYD was determined by MALS. NALP3 PYD was injected onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in a buffer containing 20 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.0, and 150 mm NaCl. The chromatography system was coupled to a MALS detector (mini-DAWN EOS) and a refractive index detector (Optilab DSP) (Wyatt Technology). The crystallization conditions were initially screened at 20 °C by the hanging drop vapor-diffusion method using various screening kits. Initial crystals were grown on the plates by equilibrating a mixture containing 1 μl of protein solution (6–8 mg ml−1 protein in 20 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.0, 150 mm NaCl) and 1 μl of a reservoir solution containing 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium acetate trihydrate, pH 4.6, 30% polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 2.000 against 0.4 ml of reservoir solution. Crystallization was further optimized by searching over a range of concentrations of protein, PEG MME 2.000, ammonium sulfate. Selenomethionine-substituted NALP3 PYD was produced using previously established method (27Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar) and crystallized similarly. A single wavelength anomalous diffraction data set was collected at the selenium peak wavelength at the BL-4A beamline at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory, Republic of Korea. Data processing and scaling were carried out in the HKL2000 package (28Otwinowski Z. DENZO Data Processing Package. Yale University, New Haven, CT1990Google Scholar). A 2.2-Å native data set was also collected. Selenium positions were found with HKL2MAP (29Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 2008; 64: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (80563) Google Scholar) using the data set collected at the peak wavelength. Phase calculation and phase improvement were performed at a resolution of 1.7 Å using the programs SOLVE and RESOLVE (30Terwilliger T. J. Synchrotron Radiat. 2004; 11: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Approximately 80% of the structure was auto-traced. Model building and refinement were performed in COOT (31Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23229) Google Scholar) and Refmac5 (32Vagin A.A. Steiner R.A. Lebedev A.A. Potterton L. McNicholas S. Long F. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2184-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar), respectively. Water molecules were added automatically with the ARP/wARP function in Refmac5 and then were examined manually for reasonable hydrogen bonding possibilities. The final atomic model contains residues 5–94 for A chain and 5–110 for B chain. The quality of the model was checked using PROCHECK and was found to be good. A total of 96.4% of the residues are located in the most favorable region, and 3.6% are in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Ribbon diagrams and molecular surface representations were generated using the program PyMOL (45DeLano W.L.

Open table in a new tab The amino acid sequence of PYDs was analyzed using ClustalW. The coordinates and structural factors have been deposited in Protein Data Bank with accession code 3QF2. The 1.7 Å crystal structure of NALP3 PYD was solved using a single wavelength anomalous diffraction method and refined to an Rwork = 18.5% and Rfree = 23.5%. The high resolution structure of NALP3 PYD showed that it includes six helices, H1 to H6, which form the canonical anti-parallel six-helical bundle fold characteristic of the DD superfamily (Fig. 1A). There were two monomers in the asymmetric unit, called chain A and chain B (Fig. 1A). Model of chain B was built from residues 3 to 110, and that of chain A was built from residues 3 to 96. Extra residues built in chain B at the C terminus are indicated by a dashed box (Fig. 1A, right panel). They formed a symmetric dimer. Helix 3 (H3) that was not well defined in the structure of NALP1 PYD is obviously detected in this structure. The length of H3 is shorter than that of other helices. The N and C termini of NALP3 PYD reside at the same side of the molecule. The six helices consisting of residues 6–16, 21–31, 43–48, 51–62, 64–78, and 81–90 are numbered H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6, respectively (Fig. 1A). The helix bundle tightly packed by a central hydrophobic core included Leu-10, Ala-11, Tyr-13, and Leu-14 from H1; Phe-25 and Leu-29 from H2; Leu-54, Ala-55, and Met-58 from H4; Ala-67, Ile-74, and Phe-75 from H5; and Ala-87 from H6 (Fig. 1B). The second hydrophobic cluster that was essential for the stabilizing H3 to the core of the NALP7 PYD was also detected at the NALP3 PYD structure (Fig. 1C). Residues Phe-32, Ile-39, Pro-40, Leu-41, Pro-42, Leu-57, and Phe-61 are involved in the formation of the second hydrophobic patch for NALP3 PYD (Fig. 1C). Residues buried within the core of NALP3 PYD and residues for second hydrophobic cluster are conserved among different PYDs that are supposed to interact with ASC (Fig. 2A). Five loops, including residues 17–20 (H1-H2 loop), 32–42 (H2-H3 loop), 49–50 (H3-H4 loop), 63–64 (H4-H5 loop), and 79–80 (H5-H6 loop), connect the six helices.FIGURE 2Structural based sequence alignment and B-factor distribution.

Plotting individual B factors for each residue showed that H2, H3, H4, and H5 have the lowest B factors, whereas the H2-H3 loop has the highest B factor (Fig. 2, B and C). The C-terminal sequences are also more flexible with higher B factors. This trend in B factor distribution may be consistent with the lack of further polar interactions between the H2 and H3 loop and the remaining part of the structure. As expected, residues that are buried in the hydrophobic core tend to have lower B factors, both in their main chains and their side chains. In contrast, the more exposed residues may have low main chain B factors but often have higher side chain B factors. The positional spread of the NMR structures of NALP1 PYD and NALP7 PYD shows a similar distribution of flexibility, suggesting that this dynamic behavior may be universal for all PYDs (21Hiller S. Kohl A. Fiorito F. Herrmann T. Wider G. Tschopp J. Grütter M.G. Wüthrich K. Structure. 2003; 11: 1199-1205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 22Pinheiro A.S. Proell M. Eibl C. Page R. Schwarzenbacher R. Peti W. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27402-27410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The structure of NALP3 PYD provides the first step toward elucidating the inflammasome-mediated Caspase-1 activation. Conserved hydrophobic residues are essential for the formation of the overall fold. The second hydrophobic patch that allows for the formation of H3 and anchors it to H2, which detected the structure of NALP7 PYD but not that of NALP1 PYD, was also detected at NALP3 PYD. The hydrophobicity of this patch is not as strong as that of NALP7 PYD. This second hydrophobic patch is important for the formation of H3. The structure of NALP3 PYD also reveals interesting insights on the novel homodimeric interfaces that may be formed by crystallographic packing. The two NALP3 PYDs in the asymmetric unit are packed as a symmetric dimer whose interface is predominantly electrostatic interaction (Fig. 3A). A total dimer surface buries 641 Å2 (a monomer surface area of 320 Å2), which represents 5.5% of dimer surface area. The principal contacts are made by Glu-30 (on H2), Asp-31 (on H2), and Arg-43 (H3) from one NALP3 PYD molecule (chain A) and by same residues from the second molecule (chain B) (Fig. 3B). Arg-43 of H3 on chain A forms a salt bridge with Glu-30 and Asp-31 of H3 on chain B (Fig. 3B) and vice versa. Because the isolated NALP3 PYD behaves as a monomer or dimer in solution depending on the salt concentration and pH, as judged by size-exclusion chromatography and MALS, stoichiometry of NALP3 PYD is hard to determine (supplemental Fig. 1). Thus, this dimeric structure might be coincidentally formed by crystal packing. However, it is still possible that this dimer is a biologically meaningful dimer. However, it is still possible that this dimer is a biologically meaningful dimer because the DD superfamily openly forms a stable dimer for the function (33Coussens N.P. Mowers J.C. McDonald C. Nuñez G. Ramaswamy S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 353: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, several reports showed that monomer/dimer transition can be detected at the DD superfamily (34Srimathi T. Robbins S.L. Dubas R.L. Hasegawa M. Inohara N. Park Y.C. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 1319-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although the oligomerized form of NALP3 PYD was detected, the majority of NALP3 PYD exists as a monomer in a physiological condition based on MALS experiment. The calculated monomeric molecular mass of NALP3 PYD, including the C-terminal His tag, was 12.685 Da, and the calculated molecular mass from MALS was 12.019 Da (0.7% fitting error), with a polydispersity of 1.000 (supplemental Fig. 1). A structural homology search with DALI (35Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar) showed that NALP3 PYD is highly similar to other PYDs (Table 2).

Detecting two DED structures as a structurally similar domain with NALP3 PYD indicates that the structure of PYD is relatively close to that of DED among the death domain superfamily. A structure-based sequence alignment showed that most of the residues buried in the hydrophobic core of NALP3 PYD are also conserved among these highly divergent PYD structures, suggesting a conserved hydrophobic core across all PYDs (Fig. 2).TABLE 2Structural similarity search using DALI (35Holm L.

For example, in comparison with NALP7 and NALP1, helix H2 of NALP3 PYD shows differences in orientations. The conspicuous differences are detected at the loops connecting the helices, especially those at H2-H3 (Fig. 4). The location of the H2-H3 loop, especially compared with NALP1, is completely opposite, indicating the dynamic property of this loop among various PYDs. A relatively small helix of H3 is also an interesting feature that is only detected on the structure of PYDs. NALP3 PYD has similar gross features in its electrostatic surface, in comparison with other ASC-binding PYDs such as NALP1 PYD and ASC2 PYD (Fig. 5). Similar to the charged nature of most of the other ASC-binding PYDs, NALP3 PYD surface is also the mixture of positively and negatively charged features. This is the case for both sides of the molecule (Fig. 5). Because PYDs are protein interaction modules, their surface features dictate their mode of interactions with partners. In the case of ASC2 PYD, although no direct structural information is available, it has been implicated that its charged surface is important for interaction with ASC PYD (39Srimathi T. Robbins S.L.

Intensive mutagenesis study showed that the positively charged residues, Lys-21 and Arg-41, on the H2 and H3 helices of ASC2 PYD might be counterparts in the interaction with the negatively charged patch containing Asp-6, Glu-13, Asp-48, and Asp-54 on the H1 and H4 helices of ASC PYD (39Srimathi T.

For the complex formation of the other death domain superfamily, the charged interactions are also known to be important. In the structure of a DD complex, between the Drosophila proteins Pelle and Tube (40Xiao T. Towb P. Wasserman S.A. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1999; 99: 545-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), the interaction is mixed, with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic components. In the Apaf-1·Caspase-9 CARD complex, the interaction is mediated largely by charge complementarity (41Qin H. Srinivasula S.M. Wu G. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). A hydrophobic patch formed by Ile-39, Pro-40, Leu-41, and Pro-42 at the H2-H3 loop and Leu-57 and Phe-61 at H4 and detected at the structures of NALP7, ASC, and ASC2 was also conserved on the NALP3 PYD. This hydrophobic patch exposed to the surface may also have functional significance in the assembling of the inflammasome for Caspase-1 activation. Based on the analysis of the electrostatic surface of NALP3, it might be possible to use both charged and hydrophobic interactions that have been found for the interaction of the other death domain superfamily. A number of residues on the surface are conspicuously conserved among NALP3 PYD from other PYD domains that are supposed to interact with ASC PYD (Fig. 2). These include Leu-17, Leu-22, Pro-33, Pro-34, His-51, Val-52, Ile-59, Gly-63, Ile-78, and Tyr-84, which are conserved as large hydrophobic residues on the surface of NALP3 PYD. In addition to hydrophobic residues, 10 surface-charged residues, Glu-15, Asp-21, Lys-23, Lys-24, Lys-48, Asp-53, Glu-64, Glu-65, Arg-81, and Lys-89, are conserved among different PYDs. Mapping of these residues onto the NALP3 PYD surface shows that two hydrophobic patches are located in two opposite directions, and more charged regions are dispersed all over the surface of NALP3 PYD (Fig. 6). The mapping analysis suggests that this extensive surface of NALP3 PYD, including both a hydrophobic central region and a more charged peripheral region, may be involved in interaction with ASC PYD. Lys-48, which is a critical residue for self-dimerization, may also be involved in the heterotypic interaction. Because NALP3 PYD is involved in the assembly of the oligomeric inflammasome, it is possible that this mapped region of the NALP3 PYD surface interacts with multiple molecules of ASC, which is detected for the assembly of other caspase-activating complexes such as PIDDosome, DISC. In the case of PIDDosome assembly, most of the surface on the RIP-associated Ich-1 (RAIDD)/CED homologous protein with death domain was involved in the interaction with p53-induced protein with death domain (PIDD) (42Park H.H. Logette E. Raunser S. Cuenin S. Walz T. Tschopp J. Wu H. Cell. 2007; 128: 533-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In the case of FADD, the adaptor protein involved in the assembly of the DISC for extrinsic cell death, initially residues in H2 and H3 helices of FADD DD were shown to be important for Fas interaction. Subsequently, an extensive surface of FADD DD, with residues spreading all six helices of its structure, also was shown to participate in assembly of the DISC (43Wang L. Yang J.K. Kabaleeswaran V. Rice A.J. Cruz A.C. Park A.Y. Yin Q. Damko E. Jang S.B. Raunser S. Robinson C.V. Siegel R.M. Walz T. Wu H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 1324-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In NALP3 PYD, the conserved surface residues distribute to many regions of the protein sequence indicating that NALP3 interaction with ASC for inflammasome formation may be mediated by using most surfaces of NALP3 PYD. The involvement of most surfaces of the death domain in the assembly of PIDDosome and DISC supports this idea. Multiple complex formations of death domains are a critical step for assembly of those complexes. Therefore, these conserved residues may be involved in the self-association and the interaction with NALP3 binding partner, ASC. However, it is possible that the assembly of the inflammasome and the other caspase-activating complexes such as DISC, apoptosome, and PIDDosome may be quite different in detail, including stoichiometry, nature of the interface, and region of the molecular surface. More structural studies are needed to unravel the molecular architectures of these complexes. In summary, the structure of NALP3 PYD provides a first step toward elucidating the molecular basis of formation of the NALP3 inflammasome. Disulfide bond between Cys-8 and Cys-108 was unexpectedly detected in our structure. The disulfide bond observed in the structure was formed between H1 and long loops connecting the PYD domain and the nucleotide-binding site domain (Fig. 7A). Cys-8 and Cys-108 that participate in the formation of the disulfide bond were conserved crossed species (Fig. 7B) indicating that this disulfide bond might be important for the function of NALP3. Recently, inflammation activation by reactive oxygen species has been identified. ROS generated by an NADPH oxidase participated in NALP3 inflammasome activation (44Dostert C. Pétrilli V. Van Bruggen R. Steele C. Mossman B.T. Tschopp J. Science. 2008; 320: 674-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar). Although ROS, generated by NAPDH oxidase after microbe phagocytosis, is known to constitute one of the most well known danger signals and is a candidate of activator for NALP3 inflammasome, the activation mechanism by ROS is not clear. Based on our structure, it is possible that the regulation of the formation of a disulfide bond by ROS is a critical point for NALP3 inflammasome activation. Particularly, it might be speculated that NALP3 is autoinhibited by not being formed by a disulfide bond. Upon activation by ROS, NALP3 became activated by forming a disulfide bond and changing the conformation of the structure of NALP3. The relationship between an unexpectedly identified disulfide bond and a redox potential that is known to be an activator of NALP3 inflammasome has to be identified by further research. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2044702399,"Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a prime candidate for promoting oxidative stress during inflammation. This abundant enzyme of neutrophils uses hydrogen peroxide to oxidize chloride to highly reactive and toxic chlorine bleach. We have identified 2-thioxanthines as potent mechanism-based inactivators of MPO. Mass spectrometry and x-ray crystal structures revealed that these inhibitors become covalently attached to the heme prosthetic groups of the enzyme. We propose a mechanism whereby 2-thioxanthines are oxidized, and their incipient free radicals react with the heme groups of the enzyme before they can exit the active site. 2-Thioxanthines inhibited MPO in plasma and decreased protein chlorination in a mouse model of peritonitis. They slowed but did not prevent neutrophils from killing bacteria and were poor inhibitors of thyroid peroxidase. Our study shows that MPO is susceptible to the free radicals it generates, and this Achilles' heel of the enzyme can be exploited to block oxidative stress during inflammation."

We explored the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in ethanol-induced apoptosis of neuronal cells. Ethanol-sensitive miRNAs in SH-SY5Y, a human neuroblastoma cell line, were identified using real-time PCR-based TaqMan low-density arrays. Long-term exposure to ethanol (0.5% v/v for 72 h) produced a maximum increase in expression of miR-497 (474-fold) and miR-302b (322-fold). Similar to SH-SY5Y, long-term exposure to ethanol induced miR-497 and miR-302b in IMR-32, another human neuroblastoma cell line. Using in silico approaches, BCL2 and cyclin D2 (CCND2) were identified as probable target genes of these miRNAs. Cotransfection studies with 3'-UTR of these genes and miRNA mimics have demonstrated that BCL2 is a direct target of miR-497 and that CCND2 is regulated negatively by either miR-302b or miR-497. Overexpression of either miR-497 or miR-302b reduced expression of their identified target genes and increased caspase 3-mediated apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells. However, overexpression of only miR-497 increased reactive oxygen species formation, disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential, and induced cytochrome c release (mitochondria-related events of apoptosis). Moreover, ethanol induced changes in miRNAs, and their target genes were substantially prevented by pre-exposure to GSK-3B inhibitors. In conclusion, our studies have shown that ethanol-induced neuronal apoptosis follows both the mitochondria-mediated (miR-497- and BCL2-mediated) and non-mitochondria-mediated (miR-302b- and CCND2-mediated) pathway."

Cell type-specific gene expression patterns, subunit stoichiometry, and interplay between presynaptic and postsynaptic specializations are thought to underlie the spatial and temporal localization of these receptors. In particular, a postsynaptic matrix of receptor-associated proteins is essential for the dynamic localization of both GABAARs and GlyRs and also recruits components of specific signaling cascades to synapses (1Fritschy J.M.

GABAARs containing the α4, α5, and α6 subunits are located preferentially at extrasynaptic sites (9Belelli D. Harrison N.L. Maguire J. Macdonald R.L. Walker M.C. Cope D.W. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 12757-12763Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and are likely to be localized by other clustering factors, such as the actin-binding protein radixin (10Loebrich S.

Hence, although the majority of GlyRs are likely to be clustered by gephyrin, only certain GABAAR subtypes are subject to gephyrin-dependent clustering. Curiously, the subcellular localization of gephyrin is in turn dependent on the presence of certain GABAAR subtypes. For example, targeted deletion of the GABAAR α1, α3, and γ2 subunit genes results in a loss of synaptic gephyrin clusters (11Schweizer C. Balsiger S. Bluethmann H. Mansuy I.M. Fritschy J.M. Mohler H.

Cloning resulted in an in-frame fusion of the GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4BD; vector pYTH16) (25Fuller K.J. Morse M.A. White J.H. Dowell S.J. Sims M.J. BioTechniques. 1998; 25: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) or GAL4 activation domain (GALAD; vector pACT2) to the N termini of all expressed proteins. Mutations were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and all constructs were verified by Sanger DNA sequencing. A hemagglutinin (HA) tag (YPYDVPDYA) was inserted between amino acids 32 and 33 of the rat GABAAR α3 subunit (Uniprot P20236; NCBI Entrez Gene ID 24947) using the GeneSOEing (Gene Splicing by Overlap Extension) technique. Because the α3 signal peptide comprises amino acids 1–28, the HA tag is located between amino acids 4 and 5 of the mature polypeptide. There are two published versions of the rat GABAAR subunit α3 intracellular loop in the protein data base Uniprot with regard to amino acid 381, which is either a leucine (nucleotides TTG) or lysine (nucleotides AAG). Because this amino acid is near the critical region for α3 subunit-gephyrin interactions, we compared both constructs in our experiments. Deletions were made in α3L381 using the GeneSOEing technique. GST fusion proteins were constructed by cloning the intracellular loops into an engineered pGEX vector, which provided a C-terminal His6 tag for purification of the fusion protein. The yeast strain Y190 was co-transformed with pYTH16-GABAAR α1 or α3 or GlyR β subunit intracellular M3–M4 loop bait plasmids together with pACT2-gephyrin prey constructs. pACT2-gephyrin deletions and alanine block mutants were described previously (18Harvey K. Duguid I.C. Alldred M.J. Beatty S.E. Ward H. Keep N.H. Lingenfelter S.E. Pearce B.R. Lundgren J. Owen M.J. Smart T.G. Lüscher B. Rees M.I. Harvey R.J. J.

Additional pYTH16-GABAAR α3 deletion mutants and the pYTH16-GABAAR α3inα1 chimera were generated during this study. Transformations were plated on selective dropout media (either −LeuTrpHis +30 mm 3-AT or -LeuTrp). After incubation at 30 °C for 3–6 days, LacZ reporter gene assays were performed as described (18Harvey K. Duguid I.C. Alldred M.J. Beatty S.E. Ward H. Keep N.H. Lingenfelter S.E. Pearce B.R. Lundgren J. Owen M.J. Smart T.G. Lüscher B. Rees M.I. Harvey R.J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5816-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Hippocampal cultures were made from E18 rats from Charles River as described previously (26Kittler J.T. Thomas P. Tretter V. Bogdanov Y.D. Haucke V. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 12736-12741Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Transfections were made using the Amaxa System with GABAAR α3 and mutant expression constructs in the vector pCI (Promega). Transfected neurons were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and maintained in Neurobasal/B27 medium for 18 days. Plasmid DNA used for transfection was prepared with the Endofree maxi kit (Qiagen). HEK293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573) were co-transfected with pCI expression constructs encoding HA-tagged GABAAR α3 and deletion mutants together with the GABAAR β3 subunit. Cells were initially plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips in DMEM containing 10% FCS. For transfection we used the TurboFect transfection reagent (Fermentas) and 0.5 μg of pCI GABAAR β3 DNA together with 0.5 μg of pCI GABAAR α3 DNAs (deletions 1–4) according to the manufacturer's protocol using serum-free medium. Three hours after transfection, the culture medium was changed to one also containing 10% FCS. Cells were fixed and stained 48 h after lipofection. Primary antibodies were anti-HA rabbit polyclonal antibody (dilution 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-gephyrin mouse monoclonal antibody (dilution 1:100, reconstituted as recommended; Synaptic Systems), and rabbit affinity-purified anti-GABAA receptor α3 antibody (27Fritschy J.M. Mohler H. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 359: 154-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) (tested for specificity in α3 knock-out brains, at 1 μg/ml). Secondary antibodies were FITC (fluorescein) goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) with minimal cross-reactivity (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and Cy3 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) with minimal cross-reactivity (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Neurons grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose in PBS. HEK293 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde without sucrose. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation with 5% BSA in PBS. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 1% BSA/PBS. Secondary antibodies included FITC and Cy3 anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgGs. For detecting intracellular epitopes, cells were permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 for 5 min prior to blocking with BSA. After incubation with secondary antibodies, coverslips were washed with PBS and finally with water and mounted using Mowiol mounting solution (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA). GST fusion proteins were purified from Escherichia coli BL21 extracts under denaturing conditions on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose column as described (Qiagen Expressionist Manual). The protein concentration of purified proteins was quantified using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Approximately 5 μg of each fusion protein was separated on two 10% polyacrylamide gels (NuPAGE, Invitrogen) using MOPS SDS running buffer (50 mm MOPS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.7). One gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, the other gel was blotted onto a PVDF membrane (Immobilon, Millipore). The membrane was incubated in 7 m guanidinium chloride in renaturation buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 70 mm KCl, 80 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 1 h at 4 °C. This solution was diluted every hour with renaturation buffer to a final concentration of 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 m guanidinium hydrochloride. Finally the membrane was incubated in renaturation buffer without guanidinium hydrochloride for 1 h, blocked with 5% BSA and 0.03% Triton X-100 in renaturation buffer for 1 h and another 1 h in 1% BSA in detergent-free renaturation buffer. In vitro translation and [35S]methionine labeling of gephyrin was performed using the TNT®T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation kit (Promega) and [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol at 10 mCi/ml). 0.5 μg of the pRK5 gephyrin P1 plasmid was mixed with 2 μl of [35S]methionine, 6 μl of nuclease-free ddH2O, and 40 μl of TNT T7 Master Mix and incubated for 90 min at 30 °C. The blot was incubated overnight at 4 °C in 20 ml of 1% BSA in detergent-free renaturation buffer with 50 μl of in vitro-translated 35S-labeled gephyrin. Subsequently, the blot was washed with 1% BSA in detergent-free renaturation buffer for 1 h and air-dried. The dry membrane was exposed to a PhosphorImager screen for 4 h and analyzed using the Quantity One software. To determine relative gephyrin binding affinities to different GST fusion proteins, the Coomassie-stained gel was analyzed by densitometry, and variations of intensities were used as correction factors when quantifying the overlay assays. The assays were repeated three times under identical conditions. For statistical evaluation, the intensities of bands were compared with the wild-type construct using an unpaired Student's t test with a confidence interval of p < 0.01. Electrophysiological properties of α3β3γ2 GABAARs expressed in Xenopus oocytes were measured using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Methods for isolating, culturing, injecting, and defolliculating of oocytes were as described previously (28Sigel E. Baur R. Trube G. Möhler H. Malherbe P. Neuron. 1990; 5: 703-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). In brief, mature female Xenopus laevis (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI) were anesthetized in a bath of ice-cold 0.17% Tricain (ethyl-m-aminobenzoate; Sigma) before decapitation and removal of the ovaries. Stage 5–6 oocytes with the follicle cell layer intact were removed from the ovary using a platinum wire loop. Oocytes were stored and incubated at 18 °C in modified Barth's medium (88 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm KCl, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.34 mm Ca(NO3)2) that was supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Oocytes with an intact follicular cell layer were subjected to nuclear injection with a total of 3 ng of cDNA in aqueous solution per oocyte. The subunit ratio was 1:1:5 for α3β3γ2 receptors consisting of wild-type or mutant α3 subunits together with β3 and γ2 subunits. After injection of cDNAs, oocytes were incubated for at least 24 h before the enveloping follicle cell layers were removed. Collagenase treatment (type IA; Sigma), and mechanically defolliculating of the oocytes was performed as described previously (29Li X. Cao H. Zhang C. Furtmueller R. Fuchs K. Huck S. Sieghart W. Deschamps J. Cook J.M. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 5567-5570Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For electrophysiological recordings, oocytes were placed on a nylon grid in a bath of Xenopus Ringer solution (XR; containing 90 mm NaCl, 5 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm KCl, and 1 mm CaCl2). The oocytes were constantly washed by a flow of 6 ml/min XR, which could be switched to XR containing GABA and/or diazepam. Diazepam was diluted into XR from dimethyl sulfoxide solutions resulting in a final concentration of 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide perfusing the oocytes. Diazepam was preapplied for 30 s before the addition of GABA, which was then co-applied with the diazepam until a peak response was observed. Between two applications, oocytes were washed in XR for up to 15 min to ensure full recovery from desensitization. For current measurements, the oocytes were impaled with two microelectrodes (1–3 megaohms) which were filled with 2 m KCl. Maximum currents measured in cDNA-injected oocytes were in the microampere range for all GABAA receptor subtypes. To test for modulation of GABA-induced currents by diazepam, a concentration of 3 μm GABA was co-applied to the cell with 1 μm diazepam. All recordings were performed at room temperature at a holding potential of −60 mV using a Dagan CA-1B Oocyte Clamp or a Dagan TEV-200A two-electrode voltage clamp (Dagan Corporation, Minneapolis, MN). Data were digitized, recorded, and measured using a Digidata 1322A data acquisition system (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and analyzed using GraphPad Prism. Data for GABA-dependent dose-response curve were fitted to the equation Y = Bottom + (Top − Bottom)/(1 + 10(LogEC50−X) * nH), where EC50 is the concentration of the compound that increases the amplitude of the GABA-evoked current by 50%, and nH is the Hill coefficient. Data are given as mean ± S.E. from at least three oocytes and two oocyte batches. Statistical significance was calculated using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test. Partial GABAAR α3 subunit variants were PCR-amplified and cloned into the NcoI/NotI sites of pETM11. M3–M4 fusion proteins were expressed in the E. coli strain BL21 (Stratagene) as His6-tagged proteins. Cells were grown in LB medium at 30 °C, and protein expression was induced following addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 18 h. Cells were then resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, pH 8.0), passed through a French pressure cell, and centrifuged (4000 × g). Proteins were initially purified using a 5-ml HisTrap FF crude column according to the instructions of the manufacturer (GE Healthcare). Protein-containing fractions were collected, concentrated, and applied to a 26/60 Superdex 200 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm NaCl, pH 8.0). Pure fractions were pooled, concentrated to 5–100 mg/ml, flash-frozen in 0.5-ml aliquots, and stored at −80 °C. The gephyrin E domain was prepared as described previously (20Schrader N. Kim E.Y.

Vannier C. Schwarz G. Schindelin H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1385-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Prior to all ITC experiments, gephyrin and GABAAR α3 M3–M4 loop variants were extensively dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0, at 4 °C overnight, followed by filtration and degassing. A 200 μm solution of the GABAAR α3 variants was titrated as the ligand into the sample cell containing 9 μm gephyrin E domain. A volume of 10–15 μl of ligand was added at a time with a total number of 20–30 injections, resulting in a final molar ratio of ligand to protein of 4:1. All experiments were performed using a VP-ITC instrument (MicroCal, Northampton, MA) at 25 °C. Buffer-to-buffer titrations were performed as described above, so that the heat produced by injection, mixing, and dilution could be subtracted prior to curve fitting. The binding enthalpy was measured directly, whereas affinity (KD) and stoichiometry (N) were obtained by data analysis using the ORIGIN software. Native PAGE gels containing 1% agarose and Tris/glycine, pH 8.4, were used to separate the E domain of gephyrin from the E domain-GABAAR α3 complex. 10 μl of the E domain (5 μm) mixed with the respective ligand (80 μm) was loaded in each lane. To assess the possible interaction of the GABAAR α3 subunit with gephyrin we performed overlay assays using GST-tagged GABAAR α3 fusion proteins and recombinant 35S-labeled gephyrin, using the abundant P1 isoform that lacks the C3 and C4 cassettes (1Fritschy J.M. Harvey R.J. Schwarz G. Trends Neurosci. 2008; 31: 257-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Because the most likely binding site is located in the large intracellular domain between membrane-spanning domains 3 and 4, we split the 99-amino acid domain (constructs HL1 and HL2) and engineered several deletion constructs (Δ1–Δ4; Fig. 1A). The HL1 construct was generated in two versions, due to an apparent polymorphism at amino acid 381 (Leu-381 versus Lys-381). Quantitative analysis (Fig. 1, B and C) revealed that the intact GST-GABAAR α3 M3–M4 domain fusion protein (but not GST alone) showed a robust interaction with recombinant gephyrin (Fig. 1, B and C). This interaction was retained by both versions of the N-terminal portion of the M3–M4 domain (HL1L381 and HL1K381; amino acids Asn-332–Asp-382), but binding of the C-terminal HL2 fragment was negligible (amino acids Thr-383–Lys-430). This suggested that the polymorphism at amino acid 381 does not influence GABAAR α3-gephyrin interactions and, more importantly, that a gephyrin-binding motif is likely to reside in the N-terminal 51 amino acids of the M3–M4 domain. Consistent with this hypothesis, further analysis revealed that α3-gephyrin interactions were most severely reduced by the overlapping deletions α3Δ1 (Pro-357–Ile-377) and α3Δ4 (Phe-368–Ile-377) that lie within the N-terminal HL1 fragment, although deletion Δ3 (Thr-361–Thr-367) also appeared to reduce α3-gephyrin interactions, albeit to a lesser extent than Δ1 and Δ4. As a second confirmatory assay, we utilized the yeast two-hybrid system to test interactions between the M3–M4 intracellular loops of the GABAAR α1 and α3 subunits and GlyR β (control) with full-length P1 gephyrin and α3 deletion mutants. Although all bait proteins are expressed in yeast (23Saiepour L. Fuchs C. Patrizi A. Sassoè-Pognetto M. Harvey R.J. Harvey K. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 29623-29631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) the GABAAR α3 and GlyR β baits, but not the GABAAR α1 bait, interact with full-length gephyrin and two N-terminal deletion mutants (Geph276–736 and Geph305–736), as assessed by LacZ freeze-fracture assays (Fig. 2). Using deletion and domain swap mutations (Fig. 2), we found that consistent with overlay assays, deletion of the Thr-361–Ile-377 (α3Δ5) and Phe-368–Ile-377 (α3Δ4) abolished the interaction of the GABAAR α3 subunit with gephyrin (Fig. 2, A and B). By contrast, deletion of Thr-361–Thr-367 (α3Δ3) revealed that this motif was dispensable for GABAAR α3-gephyrin interactions in yeast. Because both overlay and yeast two-hybrid assays suggest that the motif FNIVGTTYPI (Phe-368–Ile-377) contains key determinants of GABAAR α3-gephyrin interactions, we inserted Phe-368–Ile-377 from α3 into a wild-type GABAAR α1 subunit bait, which does not normally interact with gephyrin (23Saiepour L. Fuchs C. Patrizi A. Sassoè-Pognetto M. Harvey R.J. Harvey K. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 29623-29631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) in yeast (Fig. 2C). This bait (named α3inα1) was able to interact with gephyrin (Fig. 2C), confirming that we have identified key residues involved in the GABAAR α3-gephyrin interaction. To verify the nature of the identified gephyrin binding motif on GABAAR α3 in a neuronal context, we transfected hippocampal neurons with wild-type HA-tagged GABAAR α3 and selected deletion mutants by nucleofection before plating (Fig. 3). At 17 days in vitro, neurons were immunostained with HA antibodies under nonpermeabilizing conditions and after permeabilization with mAb7a, which recognizes gephyrin. We first examined the subcellular distribution of wild-type HA-α3, which formed clusters on the surfaces of both neuronal processes and the cell body (Fig. 3A) that co-localized with endogenous gephyrin (Fig. 3, B–D). Consistent with our overlay and yeast two-hybrid data, construct HA-α3Δ1 (removing Pro-357–Ile-377) exhibited a diffuse distribution on the plasma membrane and showed little or no co-localization with gephyrin (Fig. 3, E–H). By contrast, HA-α3Δ3 (lacking Thr-361–Thr-367) showed robust co-localization with gephyrin (Fig. 3, I–L), confirming that this motif is dispensable for both gephyrin binding and synaptic targeting. Finally, HA-α3Δ4 (lacking the minimal gephyrin binding motif Phe-368–Ile-377) showed a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution with some small puncta that did not co-localize with endogenous gephyrin (Fig. 3, M–P). To control for possible alterations in the assembly of the GABAARs containing α3, their capacity to access the plasma membrane and form functional benzodiazepine-responsive GABAARs was assessed using recombinant expression in HEK293 cells (Fig. 4). Using immunofluorescence under permeabilizing and nonpermeabilizing conditions, it was evident that all deletion constructs except α3Δ2 localized to the cell membrane (Fig. 4A). This mutant also showed changes in the maximal response to GABA (Fig. 4B), but normalization of dose-response curves indicated no significant changes in EC50 values (Fig. 4C). Importantly, the deletion mutants affecting the gephyrin binding site (α3Δ1 and α3Δ3; see Fig. 1) had no significant influence on membrane localization or electrophysiolog"

Structurally, the cyanobacterial NDH-1 complexes closely resemble energy-converting NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (or Complex I) of eubacteria (for example Escherichia coli) and the mitochondrial respiratory chain (4Friedrich T.

However, the enzymatic activity of cyanobacterial NDH-1 complexes remains a subject of debate because three subunits that constitute the catalytically active core of E. coli Complex I do not exist in cyanobacterial genomes. Significant progress has been made in resolving the subunit compositions and functions of the multiple NDH-1 complexes in several cyanobacterial strains (for recent reviews, see Refs. 7Battchikova N.

Four types of NDH-1 have been shown to exist in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter Synechocystis 6803). Reverse genetics and proteomics approaches demonstrated that NDH-1L and NDH-1L′ complexes participate in respiration, whereas NDH-1MS and NDH-1MS′ are responsible for CO2 uptake. Recently, Bernát et al. (11Bernát G. Appel J. Ogawa T. Rögner M. J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) demonstrated that all four types of NDH-1 are involved in NDH-1-mediated cyclic electron transfer (NDH-CET). The NDH-CET allows optimal functioning of photosynthesis by increasing the pH gradient and supplying extra ATP for CO2 assimilation. This function would be particularly important in environmental stress conditions, such as high light (12Endo T. Shikanai T. Takabayashi A. Asada K. Sato F.

A common feature of this group, apart from the absence of the three active subunits homologous to NuoE, -F, and -G of the E. coli enzyme, is the presence of several subunits specific for complexes originating from cells performing oxygenic photosynthesis. Electron microscopy studies revealed that in Synechocystis 6803 these subunits, NdhL, -M, -N, and -O, are located together, comprising the oxygenic photosynthesis-specific domain of unknown function (10Battchikova N. Eisenhut M. Aro E.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1807: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 14Birungi M. Folea M. Battchikova N. Xu M. Mi H. Ogawa T. Aro E.M. Boekema E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1797: 1681-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The NDH complexes of chloroplasts, however, contain many subunits that are absent from cyanobacterial NDH-1 complexes (for reviews, see Refs. 15Peng L. Yamamoto H. Shikanai T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1807: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar and 16Ifuku, K., Endo, T., Shikanai, T., Aro, E. M. (July 23, 2011) Plant Cell Physiol. 10.1093/pcp/pcr098.Google Scholar). These subunits, encoded by nuclear genes, form two subcomplexes, the lumenal complex and the subcomplex B, which are specific for chloroplast NDH. Furthermore, the subcomplex B and two minor light-harvesting complex I subunits, Lhca5 and Lhca6, interact with PSI, resulting in the formation of a chloroplast NDH-PSI supercomplex (17Peng L. Fukao Y. Fujiwara M. Takami T. Shikanai T. Plant Cell. 2009; 21: 3623-3640Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The severe alteration of the complexes during evolution from cyanobacteria to green plants (16Ifuku, K., Endo, T., Shikanai, T., Aro, E. M. (July 23, 2011) Plant Cell Physiol. 10.1093/pcp/pcr098.Google Scholar) implies that the chloroplast NDH-like complexes and cyanobacterial NDH-1 complexes might have divergent functional features. Despite considerable progress, the studies of cyanobacterial NDH-1 complexes are far from complete. Recently, Nowaczyk et al. (18Nowaczyk M.M. Wulfhorst H. Ryan C.M. Souda P. Zhang H. Cramer W.A. Whitelegge J.P. Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 1121-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) reported the discovery of two novel small subunits, NdhP and NdhQ, in the NDH-1L complex of Thermosynechococcus elongatus. Here we report the discovery of the novel NdhS subunit in the NDH-1 complexes of Synechocystis 6803, and this novel subunit is reported to play an important role in the efficient operation of NDH-CET in vivo. Synechocystis 6803 glucose-tolerant strain (wild type) and its mutants, Δssl0352, ΔndhB (M55) (1Ogawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 4275-4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), Ssl0352-YFP-His6, and NdhM-YFP-His6 (14Birungi M. Folea M. Battchikova N. Xu M. Mi H. Ogawa T. Aro E.M. Boekema E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1797: 1681-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), were cultured at 30 °C in BG-11 medium (19Allen M.M. J. Phycol. 1968; 4: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar) buffered with Tris-HCl (5 mm, pH 8.0) and bubbled with 2% (v/v) CO2 in air. Solid medium was the same BG-11 supplemented with 1.5% agar. Continuous illumination was provided by fluorescent lamps at 40 μmol of photons m−2 s−1. By using a Genomic Priming System (New England Biolabs), a library of 662 cosmids was obtained by random insertion of a transposon containing the chloramphenicol resistance (CmR) gene into each unknown gene of Synechocystis 6803 (20Ozaki H. Ikeuchi M. Ogawa T. Fukuzawa H. Sonoike K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2007; 48: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The wild-type strain of Synechocystis 6803 was transformed with this transposon inactivation library, and CmR mutants that displayed a slow growth phenotype under high light but not under growth light were isolated. Genomic DNA isolated from each mutant was digested with HhaI and after self-ligation was used as a template for inverse PCR with primers (supplemental Table 1) complementary to the N- and C-terminal regions of the CmR cassette. The exact position of the cassette in the mutant genome was determined by sequencing the PCR product. A fragment of 137 bp between the SalI and XbaI sites was removed from the ssl0352 gene, and a fragment containing the kanamycin resistance cartridge (KamR) cassette was inserted between the two restriction sites by using the corresponding PCR primers (supplemental Table 1). The sequences upstream of the SalI site and downstream of the XbaI site were used to design the PCR primers, ssl0352-G and -H, respectively. The constructed vector was used to transform the wild-type cells of Synechocystis 6803 using the protocol of Williams and Szalay (21Williams J.G. Szalay A.A. Gene. 1983; 24: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The transformants were spread on agar plates containing BG-11 medium and kanamycin (10 mg ml−1) buffered at pH 8.0, the plates were incubated in 2% (v/v) CO2 in air, and continuous illumination was provided by fluorescent lamps generating photosynthetically active radiation of 40 μmol of photons m−2 s−1. The mutated ssl0352 in the transformants was segregated to homogeneity (by successive streak purification) as determined by PCR amplification and immunoblotting. To obtain the Ssl0352-YFP-His6 mutant, ssl0352 ORF with the upstream region was amplified by PCR using ssl0352-YFP-L-Sal-Fw and ssl0352-YFP-L-Bam-Rev primers (supplemental Table 1) followed by restriction with SalI and BamHI. The region downstream to ssl0352 was amplified using ssl0352-YFP-R-RI-Fw and ssl0352-YFP-R-Spe-Rev primers followed by restriction with EcoRI and SpeI. The SalI-SpeI vector and the BamHI-EcoRI fragment containing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) ORF and the spectinomycin/streptomycin resistance cassette were obtained from the pEYFP-His6-SpR plasmid described in Birungi et al. (14Birungi M. Folea M. Battchikova N. Xu M. Mi H. Ogawa T. Aro E.M. Boekema E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1797: 1681-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The four fragments were ligated together, and the obtained plasmid was used for transformation of Synechocystis 6803. The transient increase in chlorophyll fluorescence after actinic light (AL) had been turned off was monitored as described (22Ma W. Mi H. Physiol. Plant. 2005; 125: 135-140Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The redox kinetics of P700 was measured according to previously described methods (23Shikanai T. Endo T. Hashimoto T. Yamada Y. Asada K. Yokota A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 9705-9709Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, changes in the levels of P700+, assessed by monitoring absorbance at 820 nm, were measured by using a Dual-PAM-100 instrument (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) with an ED-101US/MD emitter-detector unit. Far-red light (FR; >705 nm; 5.2 μmol of photons m−2 s−1) and AL (800 μmol of photons m−2 s−1 for 30 s) were applied to cells via the multibranched fiberoptic system that was equipped with the detector. P700+ reduction was monitored as an absorption change at 820 nm as described by Appel et al. (24Appel J. Phunpruch S. Steinmüller K. Schulz R. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 173: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The first order kinetics of P700+ rereduction was determined in the dark after illumination of cells with 26.5 watts m−2 FR with a maximum at 715 nm. Five liters of 4-day-old cells (A730 = 0.8–1.0) were harvested, washed, and resuspended in 10 ml of disruption buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, and 25% glycerol (v/v)). Zirconia/silica beads (0.5 mm) were added to the cell suspension, and the cells were disrupted by 10 × 30-s pulses with a BeadBeater (Biospec) followed by a 3-min incubation on ice. To remove the glass beads and debris, the sample was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min. Subsequently, the membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation at 150,000 × g for 40 min and resuspended in storage buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5). The cell cultures (800 ml) were harvested at the logarithmic phase and washed twice by suspending in 50 ml of fresh BG-11 medium, and the thylakoids were isolated according to Gombos et al. (25Gombos Z. Wada H. Murata N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 8787-8791Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) with some modifications as follows. The cells suspended in 5 ml of disruption buffer were supplemented by zirconia/silica beads and broken by vortexing 12 times at the highest speed for 15 s at 4 °C with 5 min of cooling on ice between the runs. The crude extract was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min to remove the glass beads and unbroken cells. By further centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min, we obtained membrane and soluble fractions from the precipitation and supernatant, respectively. Subsequently, membranes were resuspended in storage buffer (50 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.5, 600 mm sucrose, 30 mm CaCl2, and 1 m glycine betaine). Plasma and thylakoid membranes were isolated from Synechocystis 6803 cells by aqueous polymer two-phase partitioning. In this process, the total Synechocystis membrane pellet (isolated as described above) was fractionated by two-phase partitioning using the polymers Dextran T-500 and PEG 3350 (26Norling B. Zak E. Andersson B. Pakrasi H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 27Jansén T. Kanervo E. Aro E.M. Mäenpää P. J. Plant Physiol. 2002; 159: 1205-1211Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). CP43 and SbtA proteins were used as markers of the purity of the thylakoid and plasma membranes (26Norling B. Zak E. Andersson B. Pakrasi H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 28Zhang P. Battchikova N. Jansen T. Appel J. Ogawa T. Aro E.M. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3326-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Blue native (BN)-PAGE of Synechocystis 6803 membranes was performed as described earlier (29Kügler M. Jänsch L. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. Braun H.P. Photosyn. Res. 1997; 53: 35-44Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar) with slight modifications (28Zhang P. Battchikova N. Jansen T. Appel J. Ogawa T. Aro E.M. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3326-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Isolated membranes were prepared for BN-PAGE as follows. Membranes were washed with 330 mm sorbitol, 50 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.0, and 0.5 mm PMSF (Sigma) and resuspended in 20% glycerol (w/v), 25 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 units of RNase-free DNase RQ1 (Promega, Madison, WI) at a chlorophyll a concentration of 1 mg ml−1, and 0.5 mm PMSF. The samples were incubated on ice for 10 min, and an equal volume of 3% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside was added. Solubilization was performed for 10 min on ice followed by incubation at room temperature for 20 min. Insoluble components were removed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 15 min. The collected supernatant was mixed with 110 volume of sample buffer, 5% Serva Blue G, 100 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.0, 30% sucrose (w/v), 500 mm ϵ-amino-n-caproic acid, and 10 mm EDTA. Solubilized membranes were then applied to a 0.75-mm-thick, 5–12.5% acrylamide gradient gel (Mighty Small mini-vertical unit, Hoefer, San Francisco, CA). Samples were loaded on an equal chlorophyll a basis of 6 μg/lane. Electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C by increasing the voltage gradually from 50 up to 200 V during the 5.5-h run. For electrophoresis in the second dimension, a lane of the BN gel was cut out and incubated in Laemmli SDS sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and 6 m urea for 1 h at 25 °C. The lane was then laid onto a 1-mm-thick 12 or 17% SDS-polyacrylamide gel with 6 m urea (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the proteins were visualized by silver staining (31Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3741) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, the proteins were electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) and detected by protein-specific antibodies using an ECL assay kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Antibodies against NdhS subunit (the Ssl0352 protein) of Synechocystis 6803 were raised in our laboratory. To amplify the ssl0352 gene, primer sequences were designed and appear in supplemental Table 1. The polymerase chain reaction products were ligated into a vector, pET32a, and the construct was amplified in E. coli DH5α. The plasmid was used to transform E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS for expression. The gene expression products from E. coli were purified and used as antigens to immunize rabbits to produce polyclonal antibodies. The NDH-1 complexes were detected using the antibodies against NdhH, -I, -K, and -M, respectively, which were raised previously in our laboratory (22Ma W. Mi H. Physiol. Plant. 2005; 125: 135-140Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Clear native (CN)-PAGE was performed with 0.02% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside and 0.05% deoxycholate additives to the cathode buffer as described in Wittig et al. (32Wittig I. Karas M. Schägger H. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2007; 6: 1215-1225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). YFP fluorescence of the protein complexes was recorded with a Geliance 1000 Imaging System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Fluorescence was excited with light <500 nm obtained with the low pass filter LS500 (Corion, Newport Corp., Franklin, MA), and the fluorescence emission was detected in the range of 550–600 nm (SyberGold filter, Geliance 1000 Imaging System, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Purification of proteins containing the His6 tag was performed using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) or His SpinTrap columns (GE Healthcare). Chromatography buffers contained 25 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.0, 20% glycerol (w/v), 20 mm NaCl, and 0.015% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside supplemented with 5, 10, and 200 mm of imidazole for binding, washing, and elution of the proteins, respectively. After Ni2+ affinity chromatography and prior to CN-PAGE, the eluted material was concentrated using Microcon YM-100 (Millipore) centrifuge filter devices. Silver-stained bands containing protein complexes were excised from CN-PAGE and digested with Trypsin Gold (Promega) followed by extraction of peptides as described in Shevchenko et al. (33Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7816) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS using an Linear trap quadrupole Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) connected in line with an Easy-nLC II HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). Peptides were dissolved in 12 μl of 2% formic acid, loaded onto a 2-cm × 100-μm-inner diameter precolumn packed with a Magic C18 AQ 200-Å resin (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA) and subjected to reverse-phase chromatography on a 15-cm × 75-μm-inner diameter nanoscale LC column packed with the same resin. A gradient of 2–30% acetonitrile in 0.2% formic acid was applied for 28 min followed by a gradient of 30–100% acetonitrile in 0.2% formic acid for 2 min with a flow rate of 300 nl/min. Positively charged precursor ions were analyzed in the Orbitrap set to a resolution of 30,000, and MS/MS of the top 10 ions in each duty was performed in the LTQ. The raw data were processed with Protein Discoverer software, version 1.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) using default parameters to generate concatenated Mascot generic files. Database searches were performed using an in-house Mascot server (version 2.2; Matrix Science) against a database of Synechocystis 6803 proteins supplemented with sequences of common protein contaminants (the ABSciex_ContaminantDB FASTA file recommended by Applied Biosystems, MDS-Sciex) and with a reverse decoy database. The search criteria allowed for one miscleavage of trypsin, oxidation of methionine, and 5-ppm and 0.5-Da mass accuracies for MS and MS/MS modes, respectively. Cell imaging was performed using an LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) with a 100×/1.4 plan apochromat oil immersion objective and an 80-μm confocal pinhole. The argon laser line (514 nm) and the helium laser line (543 nm) were used for the excitation of enhanced YFP and autofluorescence, respectively. Enhanced YFP fluorescence emission was selected with a 515-nm dichroic mirror and a band pass filter of 535–590 nm. Autofluorescence was collected through a 545-nm dichroic mirror and a long pass filter of 560 nm. Protein was determined using a DC (detergent-compatible) protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). NCBI, Joint Genome Initiative, Cyanobase, and TAIR were used as sequence information resources. BLAST searches were performed to search for homologous sequences. To compare protein sequences or a protein sequence with an expressed sequence tag, FASTA and FASTX were applied, respectively. Amino acid sequences were aligned using the ClustalW 1.83 program (34Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55720) Google Scholar). Domain analysis was performed by pfam software. The NDH-CET has a protective role against high light stress in cyanobacteria (13Mi H. Deng Y. Tanaka Y. Hibino T. Takabe T. Photosynth. Res. 2001; 70: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and in higher plants (12Endo T. Shikanai T. Takabayashi A. Asada K. Sato F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Therefore, upon exposure of cells to high light, the growth of NDH-CET-defective mutants, such as ΔndhB (M55), is markedly retarded in comparison with wild type (WT) despite similar growth under moderate irradiation. To screen the NDH-CET-defective mutants, we transformed WT cells with a transposon-bearing library, thus tagging and inactivating many genes, and then cultured the mutant cells under high light conditions. We isolated two mutants, which grew slowly on the plate under high light but similarly to WT under moderate growth light (Fig. 1A). To investigate whether the high light-dependent phenotype of the two mutants resulted from defective NDH-CET, we monitored the postillumination rise in chlorophyll a fluorescence, which is extensively used to analyze the rate of NDH-CET in cyanobacteria (35Asada K. Heber U. Schreiber U. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 34: 39-50Google Scholar, 36Mano J. Miyake C. Schreiber U. Asada K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 1589-1598Google Scholar, 37Mi H. Endo T. Ogawa T.

As shown in Fig. 1B, the rate of NDH-CET in both mutants 1 and 2 was much lower than that in WT as judged by the height and the relative rate of postillumination increase in chlorophyll fluorescence. The results indicated that the NDH-CET was impaired in mutants 1 and 2. To identify the genes inactivated by the transposon, we analyzed the sites of transposon insertion in both mutants. As shown by the PCR results (Fig. 1C), both mutants were tagged in the same unknown gene, ssl0352. The transposon insertion occurred in position 2735537 of the Synechocystis 6803 genome (NCBI gi:16331625; Ref. 41Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2121) Google Scholar). To prove the effect of ssl0352 mutation on NDH-CET, we first replaced the majority of the ssl0352 coding region by the kanamycin resistance marker (KamR) (Fig. 2, A and B). Because Synechocystis 6803 cells usually contain multiple copies of their genome, the PCR analysis of the ssl0352 locus was used to confirm the complete segregation of the Δssl0352 mutant allele (Fig. 2C). To demonstrate the complete inactivation of the gene in the Δssl0352 mutant, Western blot analysis was performed using an antibody specifically prepared for Ssl0352 (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 2D). Next, the postillumination rise in chlorophyll fluorescence was measured from the Δssl0352 mutant. The rate of NDH-CET in Δssl0352 was much lower compared with WT, yet the rate remained relatively high when compared with the M55 mutant (Fig. 2E). It is of note that no differences were observed in growth rates and photosynthetic O2 evolution between the WT and Δssl0352 (supplemental Fig. 1), indicating that the mutation of Ssl0352 did not affect the linear electron transport at high CO2 and growth light. Furthermore, comparable levels of oxidizable P700 monitored by far-red light in the absence and presence of 10 μm methyl viologen (supplemental Fig. 2) showed that the ssl0352 mutation did not influence the PSI activity in agreement with the effect of the ndhB deletion on the PSI activity (37Mi H. Endo T. Ogawa T. Asada K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 661-668Google Scholar). To further confirm the effect of ssl0352 inactivation on NDH-CET, we compared the oxidation of P700 by FR after AL illumination among the WT, Δssl0352, and M55 strains. After 30-s illumination by AL (800 μmol of photons m−2 s−1) supplemented with FR, AL was turned off, P700+ was transiently reduced by electrons from the plastoquinone pool, and subsequently P700 was reoxidized by background FR. The operation of the NDH-1 complexes, which transfer electrons from the reduced stromal pool to plastoquinone, hinders the reoxidation of P700 (16I"
https://openalex.org/W2070823425,"Viral infections frequently cause endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in host cells leading to stimulation of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which subsequently targets unassembled glycoproteins for ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. However, the role of the ERAD pathway in the viral life cycle is poorly defined. In this paper, we demonstrate that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection activates the ERAD pathway, which in turn controls the fate of viral glycoproteins and modulates virus production. ERAD proteins, such as EDEM1 and EDEM3, were found to increase ubiquitylation of HCV envelope proteins via direct physical interaction. Knocking down of EDEM1 and EDEM3 increased the half-life of HCV E2, as well as virus production, whereas exogenous expression of these proteins reduced the production of infectious virus particles. Further investigation revealed that only EDEM1 and EDEM3 bind with SEL1L, an ER membrane adaptor protein involved in translocation of ERAD substrates from the ER to the cytoplasm. When HCV-infected cells were treated with kifunensine, a potent inhibitor of the ERAD pathway, the half-life of HCV E2 increased and so did virus production. Kifunensine inhibited the binding of EDEM1 and EDEM3 with SEL1L, thus blocking the ubiquitylation of HCV E2 protein. Chemical inhibition of the ERAD pathway neither affected production of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) nor stability of the JEV envelope protein. A co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that EDEM orthologs do not bind with JEV envelope protein. These findings highlight the crucial role of the ERAD pathway in the life cycle of specific viruses.

IntroductionQuality control of proteins, such as the elimination of misfolded proteins, is largely connected with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 2The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumCHXcycloheximideEDEMER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like proteinERADER-associated degradationHCVhepatitis C virusJEVJapanese encephalitis virusKIFkifunensineManImannosidase Im.o.i.multiplicity of infectionTMtunicamycinXBP1X-box-binding protein 1IREinositol-requiring enzyme. which is an organelle responsible for the folding and distribution of secretory proteins to their sites of action. This pathway is termed ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and is triggered by ER stress. It results in retrotranslocation of misfolded proteins into the cytosol, followed by polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation (1Vembar S.S. Brodsky J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol.

The activated IRE1 removes an intron from X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA, which then encodes a potent transcription factor for activation of genes, for example, ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein (EDEM). EDEM1 (5Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar), along with its two homologs EDEM2 (6Mast S.W. Diekman K. Karaveg K. Davis A.

EDEMs are thought to function as lectins that deliver misfolded glycoproteins to the ERAD pathway. However, the precise mechanism by which they assist in glycoprotein quality control remains unclear.Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease. The RNA genome of HCV, a member of the Flaviviridae family, encodes the viral structural proteins Core, E1, E2, and p7, as well as six nonstructural proteins (8Bartenschlager R. Lohmann V. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1631-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 9Reed K.E. Rice C.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 55-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Two N-glycosylated envelope proteins E1 and E2 are exposed on the surface of the virus and are necessary for viral entry.The aim of this study was to investigate whether the ERAD pathway is activated upon HCV infection and whether this affects the quality control of virus glycoproteins and virion production. We show that HCV infection triggers the ERAD pathway, possibly through IRE1-mediated splicing of XBP1. Moreover, EDEM1 and EDEM3, but not EDEM2, interact with HCV glycoproteins, resulting in increased ubiquitylation. EDEM1 knockdown and chemical inhibition of the ERAD pathway increases glycoprotein stability, as well as production of infectious virus particles, whereas overexpression of EDEM1 decreases virion production. These results provide insight into the mechanism by which HCV triggers the ERAD pathway and subsequently affects the quality control of virus glycoproteins and virus particle production.DISCUSSIONAccumulating evidence points to a role of the ERAD pathway in the pathogenesis of different genetic and degenerative diseases. However, the involvement of ERAD in the life cycle of viruses and infectious diseases remains poorly understood. Until recently, an experimental HCV cell culture infection system has been lacking such that studies evaluating the effect of HCV infection on the ERAD pathway were performed by either using HCV subgenomic replicons which lack structural proteins or by ectopic expression of one or multiple structural proteins (21Tardif K.D.

FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1510-1512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this problem was solved by identification of an HCV clone, JFH-1, capable of replicating and assembling infectious virus particles in cultured hepatocytes (15Wakita T. Pietschmann T. Kato T. Date T. Miyamoto M. Zhao Z. Murthy K. Habermann A. Kräusslich H.G. Mizokami M. Bartenschlager R. Liang T.J. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (2399) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used JFH-1 to examine the effect of HCV infection on activation of the ERAD pathway and its role in the virus life cycle. Our results show that the ERAD pathway is activated in HCV-infected cells, as evidenced by the maturation of XBP1 mRNA to its active form and up-regulation of EDEM1 (Fig. 1, A–D). Knocking down IRE1 reversed the induction of EDEM1, indicating that HCV infection-induced activation of the ERAD pathway is mediated through IRE1 (Fig. 1F). Loss- and gain-of-function analyses indicated that EDEM1 and EDEM3, particularly EDEM1, are involved in the post-translational control of HCV glycoproteins by which viral production is down-regulated (Figs. 3, D and E, and 4A). Our results suggest that EDEM1 and EDEM3 play a role in delivery of viral glycoproteins to the SEL1L-containing ubiquitin-ligase complex. It has recently been reported that coronavirus infection causes an accumulation of EDEM1 in membrane vesicles which are sites of viral replication, but that EDEM1 is not required for coronavirus replication (23Reggiori F. Monastyrska I. Verheije M.H. Calì T. Ulasli M. Bianchi S. Bernasconi R. de Haan C.A. Molinari M. Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 7: 500-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate regulation of the viral life cycle by ERAD machinery through interaction of EDEMs with viral glycoproteins.We propose that the mechanisms described here are important during the early stages of establishing persistent HCV infection. ER stress caused by high levels of HCV infection during the acute phase presumably results in activation of the ERAD pathway. Induced EDEMs enhance the degradation of HCV envelope proteins, thereby reducing virus production. Maintenance of moderately low levels of HCV in the infected liver may contribute to the persistence of HCV infection, often associated with a lengthy asymptomatic phase that can last for decades. A range of viruses, including flaviviruses such as JEV, dengue virus, and West Nile virus, have been reported to induce XBP1 mRNA splicing triggered by ER stress (2Yu C.Y. Hsu Y.W. Liao C.L. Lin Y.L. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 11868-11880Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 3Barry G. Fragkoudis R. Ferguson M.C. Lulla A. Merits A. Kohl A. Fazakerley J.K. J.

J. Virol. 2007; 81: 10849-10860Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, we demonstrate here that, in contrast to HCV, the envelope protein of JEV, which causes acute encephalitis, is not recognized by EDEMs, and the ERAD pathway does not control JEV production.N-Linked glycoproteins displaying the glycan precursor Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 bind ER chaperones, such as calnexin or calreticulin, which facilitates protein folding. Removal of the terminal Glc from glycans disrupts this interaction with chaperones leading to Man trimming and delivery to ERAD machinery. A glucosyltransferase can transfer the terminal Man-linked Glc back to glycans, thereby allowing the “calnexin cycle” to continue until the glycoproteins are properly folded (for review, see Ref. 25Molinari M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). During this cycle, the decision of when to abandon additional folding attempts for immature polypeptides and to direct them instead toward the degradation pathway appears to be a crucial element of protein quality control. The basis by which this occurs, however, is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that stabilization of HCV envelope proteins and increased virus production occurs with KIF treatment (Fig. 5, A and B) and with gene silencing of either EDEM1 or EDEM3 (Figs. 3, D and E, and 4A). It is generally accepted that ERAD functions to eliminate proteins that are unable to adopt their native structure after translocation into the ER. From our results, however, one could argue that, during the HCV life cycle, at least a fraction of the competently folded viral glycoprotein intermediates may be released from the calnexin cycle before maturation and thereby be recognized as ERAD substrates. As suggested previously, the processes of protein folding and ERAD compete to some extent for newly synthesized polypeptides (26Eriksson K.K. Vago R. Calanca V. Galli C. Paganetti P. Molinari M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44600-44605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 27Wu Y. Swulius M.T. Moremen K.W. Sifers R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 8229-8234Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Under conditions in which high concentrations of ERAD-related factors are found in the ER due to induction of ER stress by viral infection, activated ERAD machinery may efficiently capture protein intermediates with folding/refolding capacity and cause premature termination of chaperone-assisted protein folding.EDEM1 has recently been found to bind SEL1L, which is involved in the translocation of ERAD substrates from the ER to the cytoplasm (20Cormier J.H. Tamura T. Sunryd J.C. Hebert D.N. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 627-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate efficient binding of EDEM1 and EDEM3 to SEL1L, whereas EDEM2 exhibits only residual binding. In agreement with these results, increased ubiquitylation of HCV E2 protein was observed in cells overexpressing EDEM1 and EDEM3, but not in cells overexpressing the EDEM2 ortholog (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, KIF inhibited the binding of EDEM1 and EDEM3 with SEL1L, thus abrogating the ubiquitylation and enhancing the stability of HCV E2 protein (Fig. 5, B and D). It has been reported that KIF inhibits the interaction between EDEM1 and SEL1L, thus stabilizing ERAD substrates (4Isler J.A. Skalet A.H. Alwine J.C. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 6890-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Therefore, our results confirm previous findings and show that, along with EDEM1, KIF inhibits the binding of SEL1L to EDEM3. Furthermore, we have been the first to show that HCV E2 is a virus-derived ERAD substrate that can be used to analyze the mechanisms of this pathway. Taken together, our results indicate that EDEM1 and EDEM3, but not EDEM2, might be involved in targeting ERAD substrates to the translocation machinery, which may partly explain the different roles of the three EDEMs in HCV production. Although both EDEM1 and EDEM3 bind SEL1L and HCV envelope proteins, EDEM1 appears to have a larger role in regulation of HCV production than EDEM3. This is supported further by the finding that enhanced ubiquitylation of HCV E2 occurs in the presence of EDEM1 overexpression (Figs. 3B and 5D). In EDEM3-knockdown cells, EDEM1 may take over the function of delivering ERAD substrates to the translocation machinery. We also speculate that EDEM1 may function as a helper for EDEM3. This is supported by the observation that EDEM1 and EDEM3 synergistically increase HCV production when knocked down together (data not shown). HCV glycoproteins are a suitable means by which to investigate differences and redundancies pertaining to the role of EDEMs in the ERAD pathway.HCV-infected and TM-treated cells demonstrated the greatest activation of EDEM1 transcript production among EDEMs (Fig. 1, C and D, and supplemental Fig. S1). Although it is known that XBP1 binds to specific ER stress-responsive cis-acting elements to induce EDEMs (28Olivari S. Galli C. Alanen H. Ruddock L. Molinari M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2424-2428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 29Yoshida H. Matsui T. Hosokawa N. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), the exact mechanism of transcriptional regulation is not fully understood. It will be interesting to examine regulatory mechanism(s) specific to individual EDEM homologs in an ER stress-dependent or -independent manner.These findings highlight the crucial role of the ERAD pathway in the HCV life cycle. Further studies are needed to clarify the details of this complex pathway. The data generated in this work, however, further contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms that govern the maturation and fate of viral glycoproteins in the ER.

Although both EDEM1 and EDEM3 bind SEL1L and HCV envelope proteins, EDEM1 appears to have a larger role in regulation of HCV production than EDEM3. This is supported further by the finding that enhanced ubiquitylation of HCV E2 occurs in the presence of EDEM1 overexpression (Figs. 3B and 5D). In EDEM3-knockdown cells, EDEM1 may take over the function of delivering ERAD substrates to the translocation machinery. We also speculate that EDEM1 may function as a helper for EDEM3. This is supported by the observation that EDEM1 and EDEM3 synergistically increase HCV production when knocked down together (data not shown). HCV glycoproteins are a suitable means by which to investigate differences and redundancies pertaining to the role of EDEMs in the ERAD pathway.HCV-infected and TM-treated cells demonstrated the greatest activation of EDEM1 transcript production among EDEMs (Fig. 1, C and D, and supplemental Fig. S1). Although it is known that XBP1 binds to specific ER stress-responsive cis-acting elements to induce EDEMs (28Olivari S. Galli C. Alanen H. Ruddock L. Molinari M. J. Biol.

It will be interesting to examine regulatory mechanism(s) specific to individual EDEM homologs in an ER stress-dependent or -independent manner.These findings highlight the crucial role of the ERAD pathway in the HCV life cycle. Further studies are needed to clarify the details of this complex pathway. The data generated in this work, however, further contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms that govern the maturation and fate of viral glycoproteins in the ER. Accumulating evidence points to a role of the ERAD pathway in the pathogenesis of different genetic and degenerative diseases. However, the involvement of ERAD in the life cycle of viruses and infectious diseases remains poorly understood. Until recently, an experimental HCV cell culture infection system has been lacking such that studies evaluating the effect of HCV infection on the ERAD pathway were performed by either using HCV subgenomic replicons which lack structural proteins or by ectopic expression of one or multiple structural proteins (21Tardif K.D. Mori K. Kaufman R.J. Siddiqui A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17158-17164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 22Chan S.W. Egan P.A. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1510-1512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this problem was solved by identification of an HCV clone, JFH-1, capable of replicating and assembling infectious virus particles in cultured hepatocytes (15Wakita T. Pietschmann T. Kato T. Date T. Miyamoto M. Zhao Z. Murthy K. Habermann A. Kräusslich H.G. Mizokami M. Bartenschlager R. Liang T.J. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (2399) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used JFH-1 to examine the effect of HCV infection on activation of the ERAD pathway and its role in the virus life cycle. Our results show that the ERAD pathway is activated in HCV-infected cells, as evidenced by the maturation of XBP1 mRNA to its active form and up-regulation of EDEM1 (Fig. 1, A–D). Knocking down IRE1 reversed the induction of EDEM1, indicating that HCV infection-induced activation of the ERAD pathway is mediated through IRE1 (Fig. 1F). Loss- and gain-of-function analyses indicated that EDEM1 and EDEM3, particularly EDEM1, are involved in the post-translational control of HCV glycoproteins by which viral production is down-regulated (Figs. 3, D and E, and 4A). Our results suggest that EDEM1 and EDEM3 play a role in delivery of viral glycoproteins to the SEL1L-containing ubiquitin-ligase complex. It has recently been reported that coronavirus infection causes an accumulation of EDEM1 in membrane vesicles which are sites of viral replication, but that EDEM1 is not required for coronavirus replication (23Reggiori F. Monastyrska I. Verheije M.H. Calì T. Ulasli M. Bianchi S. Bernasconi R. de Haan C.A. Molinari M. Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 7: 500-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate regulation of the viral life cycle by ERAD machinery through interaction of EDEMs with viral glycoproteins. We propose that the mechanisms described here are important during the early stages of establishing persistent HCV infection. ER stress caused by high levels of HCV infection during the acute phase presumably results in activation of the ERAD pathway. Induced EDEMs enhance the degradation of HCV envelope proteins, thereby reducing virus production. Maintenance of moderately low levels of HCV in the infected liver may contribute to the persistence of HCV infection, often associated with a lengthy asymptomatic phase that can last for decades. A range of viruses, including flaviviruses such as JEV, dengue virus, and West Nile virus, have been reported to induce XBP1 mRNA splicing triggered by ER stress (2Yu C.Y. Hsu Y.W. Liao C.L. Lin Y.L. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 11868-11880Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 3Barry G. Fragkoudis R. Ferguson M.C. Lulla A. Merits A. Kohl A. Fazakerley J.K. J.

J. Virol. 2007; 81: 10849-10860Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, we demonstrate here that, in contrast to HCV, the envelope protein of JEV, which causes acute encephalitis, is not recognized by EDEMs, and the ERAD pathway does not control JEV production. N-Linked glycoproteins displaying the glycan precursor Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 bind ER chaperones, such as calnexin or calreticulin, which facilitates protein folding. Removal of the terminal Glc from glycans disrupts this interaction with chaperones leading to Man trimming and delivery to ERAD machinery. A glucosyltransferase can transfer the terminal Man-linked Glc back to glycans, thereby allowing the “calnexin cycle” to continue until the glycoproteins are properly folded (for review, see Ref. 25Molinari M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). During this cycle, the decision of when to abandon additional folding attempts for immature polypeptides and to direct them instead toward the degradation pathway appears to be a crucial element of protein quality control. The basis by which this occurs, however, is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that stabilization of HCV envelope proteins and increased virus production occurs with KIF treatment (Fig. 5, A and B) and with gene silencing of either EDEM1 or EDEM3 (Figs. 3, D and E, and 4A). It is generally accepted that ERAD functions to eliminate proteins that are unable to adopt their native structure after translocation into the ER. From our results, however, one could argue that, during the HCV life cycle, at least a fraction of the competently folded viral glycoprotein intermediates may be released from the calnexin cycle before maturation and thereby be recognized as ERAD substrates. As suggested previously, the processes of protein folding and ERAD compete to some extent for newly synthesized polypeptides (26Eriksson K.K. Vago R. Calanca V. Galli C. Paganetti P. Molinari M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44600-44605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 27Wu Y. Swulius M.T. Moremen K.W. Sifers R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 8229-8234Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Under conditions in which high concentrations of ERAD-related factors are found in the ER due to induction of ER stress by viral infection, activated ERAD machinery may efficiently capture protein intermediates with folding/refolding capacity and cause premature termination of chaperone-assisted protein folding. EDEM1 has recently been found to bind SEL1L, which is involved in the translocation of ERAD substrates from the ER to the cytoplasm (20Cormier J.H. Tamura T. Sunryd J.C. Hebert D.N. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 627-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate efficient binding of EDEM1 and EDEM3 to SEL1L, whereas EDEM2 exhibits only residual binding. In agreement with these results, increased ubiquitylation of HCV E2 protein was observed in cells overexpressing EDEM1 and EDEM3, but not in cells overexpressing the EDEM2 ortholog (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, KIF inhibited the binding of EDEM1 and EDEM3 with SEL1L, thus abrogating the ubiquitylation and enhancing the stability of HCV E2 protein (Fig. 5, B and D). It has been reported that KIF inhibits the interaction between EDEM1 and SEL1L, thus stabilizing ERAD substrates (4Isler J.A. Skalet A.H. Alwine J.C. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 6890-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Therefore, our results confirm previous findings and show that, along with EDEM1, KIF inhibits the binding of SEL1L to EDEM3. Furthermore, we have been the first to show that HCV E2 is a virus-derived ERAD substrate that can be used to analyze the mechanisms of this pathway. Taken together, our results indicate that EDEM1 and EDEM3, but not EDEM2, might be involved in targeting ERAD substrates to the translocation machinery, which may partly explain the different roles of the three EDEMs in HCV production.

https://openalex.org/W1970248053,"Chemokines control several cell functions in addition to chemotaxis. Although much information is available on the involvement of specific signaling molecules in the control of single functions controlled by chemokines, especially chemotaxis, the mechanisms used by these ligands to regulate several cell functions simultaneously are completely unknown. Mature dendritic cells (maDCs) migrate through the afferent lymphatic vessels to the lymph nodes, where they regulate the initiation of the immune response. As maDCs are exposed to chemokine CXCL12 (receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7) during their migration, its functions are amenable to be regulated by this ligand. We have used maDCs as a model system to analyze the mechanisms whereby CXCL12 simultaneously controls chemotaxis and survival in maDCs. We show that CXCL12 uses CXCR4, but not CXCR7, and the components of a signaling core that includes G(i)/Gβγ, PI3K-α/-δ/-γ, Akt, ERK1/2 and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which organize hierarchically to control both functions. Downstream of Akt, Forkhead box class O (FOXO) regulates CXCL12-dependent survival, but not chemotaxis, suggesting that downstream of the aforementioned signaling core, additional signaling molecules may control more selectively CXCL12-dependent chemotaxis or survival. Finally, the data obtained also show that CXCR4 uses a signaling signature that is different from that used by CCR7 to control similar functions."

This is the first report of a fungalysin that targets a nonstructural host protein and the first to implicate this class of virulence-related proteases in plant disease. Fungalysins are a family of zinc metalloproteases (M36) that occur in pathogenic fungi and some bacteria. Fungalysins contain peptide motifs similar to those of bacterial thermolysins but have little sequence homology to this well studied class of proteases. Like thermolysins and most secreted bacterial proteases, fungalysins are expressed as inactive precursors that contain N-terminal propeptides. Propeptides are intermolecular chaperones that both inhibit activity and guide the correct folding of the protease (1Shinde U. Inouye M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 442-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The first fungalysin described was MEP42, a protease secreted by Aspergillus fumigatus, a human pathogen that causes respiratory infections (2Markaryan A. Morozova I. Yu H. Kolattukudy P.E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2149-2157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sirakova T.D. Markaryan A. Kolattukudy P.E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4208-4218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MEP42 was isolated because of its ability to degrade a nonspecific protease substrate (azocasein). The purified protein was then shown to degrade the structural protein elastin, which is a component of human lungs, suggesting that fungalysins promote pathogenicity by degrading extracellular matrix proteins. This model was strengthened by the observation that a fungalysin from Microsporum canis, which causes skin diseases in cats and dogs, is able to degrade the structural protein keratin (4Brouta F. Descamps F. Monod M. Vermout S. Losson B. Mignon B. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 5676-5683Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Besides these examples, few protein-based studies of fungalysin proteins or their substrates have been reported. Molecular studies of fungalysins also suggest that their expression is involved in fungal diseases of insects (5Xu J. Baldwin D. Kindrachuk C. Hegedus D.D. Can. J. Microbiol. 2006; 52: 550-559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and amphibians (6Rosenblum E.B. Stajich J.E. Maddox N. Eisen M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Analysis of genome sequences has shown that the number of different fungalysins that fungi have varies. As noted previously (7Lilly W.W. Stajich J.E. Pukkila P.J. Wilke S.K. Inoguchi N. Gathman A.C. Mycol. Res. 2008; 112: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the model mushroom Coprinopsis cinerea has eight predicted fungalysins, whereas bakers' yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and bread mold (Neurospora crassa) have none.

Their biological role is not known, and to date, fungalysins have not been linked to plant pathogenesis.

The expression of many genes has been reported to correlate with pathogenicity, but, with exception (16Takken F. Rep M. Mol. Plant Pathol. 2010; 11: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), few observations of secreted proteins or small molecules that directly manipulate host plant biology have been reported. Previously, we surveyed the chitinase content of maize ears rotted by fungal pathogens. Maize seeds contain abundant amounts of the class IV chitinases ChitA and ChitB, which, in purified form, were shown to inhibit the growth of some fungi growing on agar plates (17Huynh Q.K. Hironaka C.M. Levine E.B. Smith C.E. Borgmeyer J.R. Shah D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6635-6640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that when ears were rotted by Bipolaris zeicola (G. L. Stout) Shoemaker (holomorph, Cochliobolus carbonum R. R. Nelson) or Stenocarpella maydis (Berkeley) B. Sutton (synonym, Diplodia maydis (Berkeley) Saccardo), the maize class IV chitinases ChitA and ChitB were truncated (18Naumann T.A. Wicklow D.T. Kendra D.F. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 2009; 74: 134-141Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19Naumann T.A. Wicklow D.T. Phytopathology. 2010; 100: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This resulted from the activity of unidentified proteases termed chitinase-modifying proteins (cmps). 2The abbreviations used are: cmpchitinase-modifying proteinFv-cmpF. verticillioides cmprFv-cmp(FL)full-length recombinant Fv-cmprFv-cmp(PROT)recombinant Fv-cmp proteaseCAPS3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acidCFMcell-free medium. cmps are also secreted by these fungi when grown in culture, and their activity can be detected by incubating secreted proteins with purified ChitA and ChitB. We hypothesized that cmps are likely to represent a broader pathogenic mechanism that would be conserved among fungal species differing in other lineage-specific pathogenic innovations (20Soanes D.M. Richards T.A. Talbot N.J. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 3318-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we grew cultures of isolates from five different species of Fusarium distributed among three phylogenetically distinct Fusarium species complexes that are associated with maize diseases. We extracted proteins and determined that these pathogens do indeed secrete cmps.

Fusarium isolates (see Table 1) were grown as potato dextrose-agar slant cultures (14 days, 25 °C).

The seed/water mixture was incubated overnight, autoclaved (15 p.s.i., 30 min), and inoculated with a suspension of hyphal cells (propagule density of 4 × 104 ml−1).

Secreted protein extracts were prepared by combining 5 g of culture with 5 ml of extraction buffer (10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.2), 0.2 mm PMSF, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm ascorbic acid) in a 50-ml conical tube. Cultures were incubated with buffer for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The protein extracts were then diluted to a concentration of 1 mg/ml protein as determined by the DCTM protein assay (Bio-Rad). The supernatants were assayed by adding 1 μl to a 10-μl reaction.TABLE 1Fusarium isolates used in this studyIsolateStrainDescriptionF. graminearum Schwabe Fg1NRRL 31084Zea mays, Michigan (PH-1; H.

Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar) from a plasmid containing the chiB gene (GRMZM2G005633) (19Naumann T.A. Wicklow D.T. Phytopathology. 2010; 100: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The cDNA was then amplified by PCR and cloned into expression vector pPICZαA (Invitrogen). Two Fv-cmp expression strains were created. One encoded secreted expression of the full-length recombinant protein (rFv-cmp(FL)), whereas the other encoded only the protease (rFv-cmp(PROT)). Both cDNAs were amplified from a plasmid cDNA library (22Brown D.W. Cheung F. Proctor R.H. Butchko R.A. Zheng L. Lee Y. Utterback T. Smith S. Feldblyum T. Glenn A.E. Plattner R.D. Kendra D.F. Town C.D. Whitelaw C.A. Fungal Genet. Biol. 2005; 42: 848-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and cloned into pPICZαA. For each expression strain and a vector-only control, plasmid DNA was purified from Escherichia coli cultures, linearized, and transformed into Pichia pastoris X-33 by electroporation. Protein-expressing isolates were selected by plating transformed cells on yeast/peptone/dextrose-agar supplemented with sorbitol and Zeocin (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose, 1 m sorbitol, 2% agar, and 100 μg of Zeocin). Oligonucleotide primers are listed in supplemental Table 1. Expression of recombinant ChitA-LH82 and ChitA-B73 and their purification from heterologous P. pastoris were as described previously (23Naumann T.A. Mol. Plant Pathol. 2011; 12: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recombinant ChitB was expressed and purified by the same method. Heterologous P. pastoris strains that express Fv-cmp and negative control strains with integrated vectors were grown in 25 ml of buffered glycerol complex medium at 30 °C using an EasySelect Pichia expression kit (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Cultures were grown to an absorbance of 10. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 25 ml of buffered methanol complex medium at 30 °C. Samples were tested after 1 day and after 4 days. For testing, 1 ml of culture was removed, cells were removed by centrifugation, and the medium was concentrated 10-fold by ultrafiltration. Reactions consisted of recombinant maize chitinase (20 μg) and various amounts of fungal protein solution in 10 μl of 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.2). Reactions with purified Fv-cmp contained 10 ng of protease. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C and stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading dye, followed by heat denaturation (1 min in boiling water). All reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fv-cmp was purified from 32 flasks of F. verticillioides (NRRL 20956). 95 ml of extraction buffer was added to each flask and mixed. The extract was filtered through cheesecloth and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Ethanol was added to the extract to 35%. The solution was stirred at room temperature for 10 min and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and precipitated proteins were dried overnight at 4 °C. Dried precipitated proteins were resuspended in 40 ml of buffer containing 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.7) and 250 mm NaCl; the solution was centrifuged and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. The resuspended pellet was loaded onto a mixed-mode cation exchange column (HiTrap Capto MMC, 5 ml). Bound proteins were eluted by increasing the pH and ionic strength with a linear gradient in 100 mm MES (pH 6.0) and 1 m NaCl. Fractions of 1 ml were collected. The activity of each elution fraction was tested by cmp assay. The two fractions with the highest activity were combined, and saturated ammonium sulfate was added to 35%. This solution was loaded onto a hydrophobic interaction chromatography column (HiTrap butyl HP, 1 ml) in 50 mm MES (pH 6.0) and 35% ammonium sulfate. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient in buffer with reduced ionic strength (50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 250 mm NaCl). Elution fractions of 0.5 ml were collected, and 1 μl of each was tested by cmp assay. Based on the results, seven elution fractions were concentrated in Centricon YM-30 concentrators (Millipore). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane with a semidry transfer unit using 10 mm CAPS (pH 11.0) and 10% (v/v) methanol. After transfer, the membrane was stained (10 mg of Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, 1 ml of acetic acid, 40 ml of methanol, and 59 ml of water) for 30 s and then destained for 10 min (50% methanol). Protein bands were removed with a scalpel and submitted to Edman degradation analysis at the Protein Sciences Facility of the University of Illinois (Urbana, IL) (24Edman P. Begg G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 1: 80-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker Daltonics OmniFLEX instrument. Protein samples (typically 2 μl) were co-crystallized with a mixed matrix (50:50 (w/w) 2,5-dihydrobenzoic acid and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 2 μl of acetonitrile) onto a conventional 49-place target. Ion source 1 was set to 19.0 kV and source 2 to 14.0 kV, with lens and reflector voltages of 9.20 and 20.00 kV, respectively. A 200-ns pulsed ion extraction was used with matrix suppression up to 400 Da for low mass range acquisitions and up to 3000 Da for the higher mass range. Low mass range spectra were acquired in reflectron mode and high mass range spectra in linear mode. Excitation was at 337.1 nm (typically at 75% of 150-μJ maximum output), and 200 laser shots were accumulated. Solid substrate fermentation cultures were grown for four isolates from each of five species from the genus Fusarium reported to cause maize seed disease: F. verticillioides, F. oxysporum, F. graminearum, F. proliferatum, and F. subglutinans (Table 1). Isolates Fv1 (NRRL 20956), Fo1 (NRRL 34936), and Fg1 (NRRL 31084) were chosen because they have complete genome sequences (8Cuomo C.A. Güldener U. Xu J.R. Trail F. Turgeon B.G. Di Pietro A.

The remaining 17 were chosen because they were isolated from diseased maize. Secreted proteins were extracted from each of the 20 cultures, and each extract was incubated with three different class IV chitinases from maize: ChitA-LH82 and ChitA-B73 (alloforms of the ChitA protein produced by maize inbreds LH82 and B73) and ChitB (an isoform of ChitA encoded by a different gene). Reactions were incubated for 16 h and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). All 20 isolates secreted cmps that converted the three chitinase substrates into a form with increased electrophoretic mobility. The F. oxysporum and F. proliferatum extracts converted all three substrates without preference. The F. verticillioides and F. subglutinans extracts degraded a higher percentage of the ChitA-B73 substrate, whereas the other two were degraded equally. In contrast, the F. graminearum extracts degraded a lower percentage of the ChitA-B73 substrate than the other two. In all extracts, ChitA-LH82 and ChitB were equivalent as substrates, whereas ChitA-B73 was sometimes recognized differently, leading to either a higher (F. verticillioides and F. subglutinans) or lower (F. graminearum) percentage of product. Although these subtle substrate preferences were observed, all protein extracts efficiently truncated each of the three chitinases. Fv-cmp was purified from F. verticillioides Fv1, an isolate with a sequenced genome. Secreted proteins were extracted from solid substrate cultures. Proteins were precipitated by the addition of ethanol, followed by centrifugation. Precipitated proteins were resuspended in buffer and subjected to chromatography by mixed-mode cation exchange (supplemental Fig. 1). Analysis of elution fractions by cmp assay indicated that the majority of the activity was confined to two of the 12 fractions. These fractions were combined, ammonium sulfate was added, and proteins were separated by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (Fig. 2a). The flow-through and elution fractions were tested for activity (data not shown). The results indicated that Fv-cmp bound the column and eluted near the end of the elution gradient. The final seven elution fractions and a sample of the flow-through were concentrated by ultrafiltration. Each concentrated sample was analyzed for protein content by SDS-PAGE and for activity by cmp assay (Fig. 2b). cmp activity correlated with a protein band of ∼45 kDa (Fig. 2b, star). To determine their N termini, the ChitA-LH82 substrate and the truncated Fv-cmp-cleaved product were analyzed by Edman degradation (Fig. 3a) (24Edman P. Begg G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 1: 80-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar). For the substrate, the first four amino acids were glutamate, phenylalanine, glutamine, and asparagine, whereas the fifth amino acid did not yield a signal (consistent with the presence of cysteine), as reported previously for ChitA-B73 (23Naumann T.A. Mol. Plant Pathol. 2011; 12: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For the product, the first amino acid did not yield a signal, suggesting that it was cysteine, whereas the next four amino acids were glutamine, serine, glycine, and proline. This matches an internal ChitA-LH82 sequence that is after the region that is predicted to be critical for chitin binding (25Aboitiz N. Vila-Perelló M. Groves P. Asensio J.L. Andreu D. Cañada F.J. Jiménez-Barbero J. ChemBioChem. 2004; 5: 1245-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) but prior to a polyglycine hinge that separates the chitin-binding and chitinase domains. To determine whether the amino acids surrounding the cleavage site are conserved in plant class IV chitinases, the sequences of the maize chitinases were compared with those of four class IV chitinases from dicotyledonous angiosperms (carrot, common bean, thale cress, and tobacco) and one class IV chitinase from a gymnosperm (Norway spruce) (Fig. 3b) (26De Jong A.J.

Bot. 2003; 54: 2691-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A comparison of the sequences revealed that seven of the 14 amino acids that flank the targeted peptide bond are conserved (−4, −3, −1, +1, +4, +5, and +6), whereas two additional amino acids differ in only one protein (−5 and +2). To augment this analysis, the target sequence was used to search for hypothetical proteins with similar sequences in the GenBankTM nr Database (supplemental Fig. 2). This analysis identified additional chitinases with these conserved residues from monocots, dicots, gymnosperms, and a bryophyte (moss). Visualization of the C-terminal cleavage product by SDS-PAGE and sequencing of its N terminus suggested that Fv-cmp is an endoprotease that converts ChitA-LH82 into two products by cleaving a specific peptide bond (Fig. 4, a and b). To confirm this mechanism, the reaction products were analyzed by mass spectrometry. ChitA-LH82 was incubated in the presence or absence of Fv-cmp. Samples were mixed with matrix, ionized by MALDI, and detected with a TOF mass analyzer. In the control reaction (Fig. 4c, lower left panel), ChitA-LH82 was observed as a singly charged ion. In the Fv-cmp reaction, the substrate and both peptide products were observed. Both the substrate and C-terminal product were visible in the high mass range (upper left panel). The smaller N-terminal product, not detected by SDS-PAGE, was visible in the low mass range as both protonated and sodium adduct ions (upper right panel). Multiply charged ions were also detected (supplemental Fig. 3). The N-terminal sequence of purified Fv-cmp was determined by"
https://openalex.org/W2033577358,"Using transcriptome profiling to determine differential gene expression between the permanent mouse articular cartilage and the transient growth plate cartilage, we identified a highly expressed gene, Cilp2, which is expressed differentially by articular chondrocytes. CILP-2 is highly homologous to CILP-1 (cartilage intermediate layer protein 1), which is expressed in the intermediate zone of articular cartilage and has been linked to cartilage degenerative diseases. We demonstrated that Cilp2 has a restricted mRNA distribution at the surface of the mouse articular cartilage during development, becoming localized to the intermediate zone of articular cartilage and meniscal cartilage with maturity. Although the extracellular CILP-2 protein localization is broadly similar to CILP-1, CILP-2 appears to be more localized in the deeper intermediate zone of the articular cartilage extracellular matrix at maturity. CILP-2 was shown to be proteolytically processed, N-glycosylated, and present in human articular cartilage. In surgically induced osteoarthritis in mice, Cilp1 and Cilp2 gene expression was dysregulated. However, whereas Cilp1 expression was increased, Cilp2 gene expression was down-regulated demonstrating a differential response to mechanically induced joint destabilization. CILP-2 protein was reduced in the mouse osteoarthritic cartilage. Ultrastructural analysis also suggested that CILP-2 may be associated with collagen VI microfibrils and thus may mediate interactions between matrix components in the territorial and inter-territorial articular cartilage matrix. mRNA expression analysis indicated that whereas Cilp1 and Cilp2 are expressed most abundantly in cartilaginous tissues, expression can be detected in muscle and heart."
https://openalex.org/W2066051957,"Proteasomes consist of a 19-subunit regulatory particle (RP) and 28-subunit core particle (CP), an α7β7β7α7 structure. The RP recognizes substrates and translocates them into the CP for degradation. At the RP-CP interface, a heterohexameric Rpt ring joins to a heteroheptameric CP α ring. Rpt C termini insert individually into the α ring pockets to form a salt bridge with a pocket lysine residue. We report that substitutions of α pocket lysine residues produce an unexpected block to CP assembly, arising from a late stage defect in β ring assembly. Substitutions α5K66A and α6K62A resulted in abundant incorporation of immature CP β subunits, associated with a complete β ring, into proteasome holoenzymes. Incorporation of immature CP into the proteasome depended on a proteasome-associated protein, Ecm29. Using ump1 mutants, we identified Ecm29 as a potent negative regulator of RP assembly and confirmed our previous findings that proper RP assembly requires the CP. Ecm29 was enriched on proteasomes of pocket lysine mutants, as well as those of rpt4-Δ1 and rpt6-Δ1 mutants, in which the C-terminal residue, thought to contact the pocket lysine, is deleted. In both rpt6-Δ1 and α6K62A proteasomes, Ecm29 suppressed opening of the CP substrate translocation channel, which is gated through interactions between Rpt C termini and the α pockets. The ubiquitin ligase Hul5 was recruited to these proteasomes together with Ecm29. Proteasome remodeling through the addition of Ecm29 and Hul5 suggests a new layer of the proteasome stress response and may be a common response to structurally aberrant proteasomes or deficient proteasome function.

The proteasome mediates the breakdown of ubiquitin-protein conjugates and is a key regulator of cell function in eukaryotes (1Finley D. Annu. Rev.

It is the most complex protease known, having 33 integral subunits, at least nine dedicated assembly chaperones, and a substantial number of weakly associated accessory factors that control its activity.

Because the passage between the RP and the CP is narrow, substrate translocation requires unfolding of the substrate, which is accomplished through the mechanical action of six ATPases present in the RP. Removal of ubiquitin from the substrate may also avert blockage of the translocation channel by ubiquitin, which is relatively resistant to unfolding. regulatory particle core particle 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide methyl methanesulfonate LLVY-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin proteasome-associated control element. The CP is composed of four stacked heteromeric rings of subunits, each with seven members, forming an α7β7β7α7 structure (2Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar). The proteolytic sites are found within β subunits (β1, β2, and β5), whereas the α subunits mediate complex formation with the RP. The α subunits also form the substrate translocation channel (3Groll M. Bajorek M. Köhler A. Moroder L. Rubin D.M. Huber R. Glickman M.H. Finley D. Nat. Struct.

This closed configuration can be disrupted by the insertion of peptides into the intersubunit pockets of the α subunits (5Rabl J. Smith D.M. Yu Y. Chang S.C. Goldberg A.L. Cheng Y. Mol.

Insertion of an Rpt tail into an α pocket is stabilized by a salt bridge formed between the C-terminal carboxylate of each tail and the ϵ-amino group of the so-called “pocket lysine” from the corresponding α pocket (7Förster A.

The interface formed between the Rpt and α rings is an important site of regulation in the proteasome. For example, docking of the C-terminal tails of the Rpt proteins into the α pockets regulates opening of the CP gate as well as assembly of the RP (6Smith D.M. Chang S.C. Park S. Finley D. Cheng Y.

Also, the ubiquitin ligase Hul5 and the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp6/Usp14 can extend or disassemble ubiquitin chains bound to the proteasome (16Crosas B. Hanna J. Kirkpatrick D.S. Zhang D.P. Tone Y.

Several factors, such as PA28 and Blm10/PA200, can take the place of the RP at the end of the CP cylinder, open the CP channel and activate it for ubiquitin-independent protein degradation (19Bader M.

Science. 2007; 316: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Among the least understood of the major proteasome-associated proteins is Ecm29. Ecm29 was identified as a salt-sensitive proteasome component in 2002 and shown to have the capacity to stabilize proteasomes in the absence of ATP (32Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Ploegh H. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The proteasome-stabilizing activity of Ecm29 has been confirmed for mammalian proteasomes as well (33Gorbea C. Goellner G.M. Teter K. Holmes R.K. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54849-54861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and is likely related to the presence of Ecm29 binding sites on both the RP and CP (32Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Ploegh H. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). In general, when examined in extracts of yeast, Ecm29 specifically binds only proteasome species that contain both RP and CP, an apparently unique property, which may reflect that stable association between Ecm29 and proteasome complexes requires the presence of both RP and CP binding sites (32Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Ploegh H. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, under some conditions, such as upon oxidative damage, the presence of Ecm29 promotes dissociation of the RP and CP (34Wang X. Yen J. Kaiser P. Huang L. Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: ra88Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The influence of Ecm29 on the proteasome has also been linked to the ubiquitin ligase Not4 (35Panasenko O.O. Collart M.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 31: 1610-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), proteasome assembly (36Lehmann A. Niewienda A. Jechow K. Janek K. Enenkel C. Mol. Cell. 2010; 38: 879-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and, in mammals, a role of the proteasome in endocytic pathways (33Gorbea C. Goellner G.M. Teter K. Holmes R.K. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54849-54861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 37Gorbea C. Pratt G. Ustrell V. Bell R. Sahasrabudhe S. Hughes R.E. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 31616-31633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although several distinct models to explain proteasome regulation by Ecm29 have been proposed, there is agreement that it is a strong and evolutionarily conserved regulator of the proteasome. In this study, we report the first pocket lysine mutants in the proteasome α ring and proceed to examine the cellular response to these and other mutational perturbations of the RP-CP interface. One common phenotype in these mutants is enhanced loading of Ecm29 onto proteasomes. In this context, Ecm29 has striking effects. In some mutants, it allows for the aberrant incorporation of immature CP into the holoenzyme. In other mutants, Ecm29 exerts marked effects on RP assembly. The state of the substrate translocation channel is also modulated by Ecm29 in several mutants. In summary, these studies indicate that Ecm29 functions as part of a larger cellular response to the stress of deficient proteasome function, but rather than compensating for defective proteasome output by simply enhancing proteasome activity, Ecm29 alters proteasome function via multiple mechanisms. All yeast manipulations were conducted according to standard protocols (38Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1991: 3-37Google Scholar). To generate pocket lysine mutants, the open reading frames of α subunit genes were first cloned into the pCR2.1 plasmid (Invitrogen). For each α subunit, the conserved Lys codon corresponding to Lys-66 of proteasome-activating nucleotide (5Rabl J. Smith D.M. Yu Y. Chang S.C. Goldberg A.L. Cheng Y. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 360-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 7Förster A. Masters E.I. Whitby F.G. Robinson H. Hill C.P. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 589-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) was then substituted to an Ala codon, using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Following sequence verification, the mutated open reading frames were amplified by PCR. A selectable marker and the 3′-UTR of each α subunit in question were PCR-amplified in parallel. These three PCR fragments were then joined via another round of PCR using Phusion DNA polymerase. The resulting PCR fragments were transformed into DF5 (diploid) or SUB62 (haploid) strains (39Finley D. Ozkaynak E. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1987; 48: 1035-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) to replace the endogenous loci of each α subunit gene. The transformants were sequence-verified. A complete list of yeast strains is provided in the supplemental Table S1. Overnight yeast cultures were diluted into fresh YPD and grown to A600 = 0.8–1.2. 4-fold serial dilutions of yeast cultures were made in H2O in 96-well plates with the highest concentration of cells equivalent to A600 = 0.2. The cells were spotted on plates and grown for 2–3 days at 30 °C. 4-Nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO) and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) plates were prepared the day before the spot assay. Antibodies to β2 (a gift from J. Dohmen) (40Marques A.J. Glanemann C. Ramos P.C. Dohmen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34869-34876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), Rpt1, Rpt6 (gifts from C. Mann), and Rpt4 (a gift from W. Tansey) were used. Antibodies to Rpn5, Rpn8, Ecm29, and Hul5 were generated in our laboratory and described previously (10Park S. Roelofs J. Kim W. Robert J. Schmidt M. Gygi S.P. Finley D. Nature. 2009; 459: 866-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 11Roelofs J. Park S. Haas W. Tian G. McAllister F.E. Huo Y. Lee B.H. Zhang F. Shi Y. Gygi S.P. Finley D.

HRP-conjugated anti-HA antibody (clone 3F10; Roche Applied Science) was used to detect HA-tagged Hul5. Anti-Pgk1 antibody (Invitrogen) was used as a loading control. Yeast cultures were harvested at A600 = 2 by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min. The cell pellets were washed with cold H2O, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground with mortar and pestle in the presence of liquid nitrogen (10Park S. Roelofs J. Kim W. Robert J. Schmidt M. Gygi S.P. Finley D. Nature. 2009; 459: 866-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 41Kusmierczyk A.R. Kunjappu M.J. Funakoshi M. Hochstrasser M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The resulting powders were hydrated with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm ATP, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to obtain whole cell lysates. Detailed procedures for native PAGE were described previously (42Elsasser S. Schmidt M. Finley D. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 398: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For in-gel peptidase assay with LLVY-AMC, the native gels were incubated for 20–25 min at 30 °C and photographed using an LAS-3000 Fuji imaging system. Native gels were further incubated in the presence of 0.02% SDS for 20 min to induce complete opening of the CP gate (3Groll M. Bajorek M. Köhler A. Moroder L. Rubin D.M. Huber R. Glickman M.H. Finley D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of native gels was conducted as described (10Park S. Roelofs J. Kim W. Robert J. Schmidt M. Gygi S.P. Finley D. Nature. 2009; 459: 866-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 12Kleijnen M.F. Roelofs J. Park S. Hathaway N.A. Glickman M. King R.W. Finley D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1180-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). For second dimension SDS-PAGE following native PAGE, the gels were incubated with LLVY-AMC, and then proteasome-containing strips were excised on a UV light box. Native gel strips were soaked in 1× SDS Laemmli sample buffer for 10 min at room temperature and subjected to SDS-PAGE as described previously (9Tomko Jr., R.J. Funakoshi M. Schneider K. Wang J. Hochstrasser M. Mol Cell. 2010; 38: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). All of the biochemical and genetic experiments were conducted at least twice. Yeast cultures were grown to A600 = 2–4. The cells were lysed in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle. Proteasome purifications were carried out essentially as described (43Leggett D.S. Glickman M.H. Finley D. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 301: 57-70PubMed Google Scholar). Throughout the purification, all buffers contained 10% glycerol, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitors. To retain Ecm29 and Hul5, whose association with the proteasome is sensitive to salt (32Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Ploegh H. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), IgG resins were washed with a low salt buffer (50 mm NaCl in lysis buffer). After destaining the gel bands, each band was digested in gel with 5 ng/μl of trypsin in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Peptides extracted from the gel pieces after digest were separated by nanoscale reversed phase liquid chromatography coupled to a tandem mass spectrometer (Velos Orbitrap, Thermo Electron). The Sequest algorithm was used to search the MS/MS spectra against a yeast database (44Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5472) Google Scholar). The data were filtered to a false discovery rate of 2% at the protein level using target decoy database approach with multivariate filtering based on linear discriminant analysis (45Elias J.E. Gygi S.P. Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2873) Google Scholar, 46Huttlin E.L. Jedrychowski M.P. Elias J.E. Goswami T. Rad R. Beausoleil S.A. Villén J. Haas W. Sowa M.E. Gygi S.P. Cell. 2010; 143: 1174-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). To examine the function of the pocket lysine residues of the proteasomal α subunits in the assembly and function of the RP-CP interface, these residues were individually substituted with alanine. The mutations were integrated at their respective chromosomal loci by one-step gene replacement (see “Experimental Procedures”). In the case of α1, the only subunit that lacks a pocket lysine (7Förster A. Masters E.I. Whitby F.G. Robinson H. Hill C.P. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 589-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), we replaced the cognate residue of Tyr-71 with Lys. We note that each α pocket is formed by two subunits. Thus, α3K65A is found in the α2/α3 pocket, α4K63A is found in the α3/α4 pocket, and so forth. The α1/α2 pocket mutant has not been characterized. The effects of the pocket lysine mutations on RP-CP dynamics were initially analyzed in whole cell extracts by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, which allows for fine resolution of the multiple species of the proteasome (42Elsasser S. Schmidt M. Finley D. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 398: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). One might expect the pocket lysine mutations to weaken the interaction between the RP and CP and consequently to lead to a reduction in the ratio of proteasome holoenzyme (RP2-CP and RP-CP) to free CP. On the contrary, proteasomes from these mutants were found predominantly in the holoenzyme form (Fig. 1, A–D), and the level of free CP fell below the detection limit (Fig. 1B). Among holoenzymes, the RP2-CP species predominated over RP-CP in all pocket lysine mutants. The peptidase activity of the proteasome was reduced in most pocket lysine mutants, particularly in α6K62A mutants (Fig. 1, A and B). The reduction in the activity of free CP seen in the pocket lysine mutants prompted us to assess CP levels directly by immunoblotting from native gels, using an antibody against a CP catalytic subunit, β2 (Fig. 1C). Remarkably, all pocket lysine mutants accumulated CP assembly intermediates (Fig. 1C), which lack peptide hydrolytic activities (Fig. 1B). The major accumulated assembly intermediates differed in abundance as well as electrophoretic mobility from mutant to mutant; at least three forms of intermediates were resolved electrophoretically (Fig. 1C; see also supplemental Fig. S1). Using antibodies to Rpt6, a subunit of the RP, we observed an accumulation of free RP in each mutant (Fig. 1D). This finding suggested that an imbalance of RP and CP in the mutants exacerbates the depletion of free CP (which also owes to the CP assembly defect) and leads to a preferential formation of RP2-CP over RP-CP (Fig. 1, A–D). The completion of CP assembly is marked by the release of propeptides from the three catalytically active subunits (β1, β2, and β5) (47Murata S. Yashiroda H. Tanaka K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 104-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2D). Propeptide release provides a simple way to track the progress of CP assembly (47Murata S. Yashiroda H. Tanaka K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 104-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 48Dohmen R.J. London M.K. Glanemann C. Ramos P.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 301: 243-254PubMed Google Scholar). Using the anti-β2 antibody (40Marques A.J. Glanemann C. Ramos P.C. Dohmen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34869-34876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we tested by immunoblotting whether propeptide release is retarded in the mutants. Indeed, each mutant showed strong accumulation of the immature form of β2 (Fig. 1E). The extent of the defect was again largely comparable among the mutants, with only α3K65A showing a somewhat weaker effect. It was not anticipated that the pocket lysine mutants should generally show defects in CP assembly (Fig. 1, C and E). The strength of the α1Y71K mutant phenotype is especially surprising, because the absence of a conserved lysine residue at the base of this pocket led to its being hypothesized to be the sole pocket that is not occupied by an Rpt C-terminal ligand (7Förster A. Masters E.I. Whitby F.G. Robinson H. Hill C.P. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 589-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). All pocket lysine mutants resulted in an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, indicating deficient proteasome function (Fig. 1E). CP assembly mutants are characteristically resistant to the UV mimetics such as 4-NQO and MMS (49Le Tallec B. Barrault M.B. Courbeyrette R. Guérois R. Marsolier-Kergoat M.C. Peyroche A. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 660-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 50Le Tallec B. Barrault M.B. Guérois R. Carré T. Peyroche A. Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 389-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) in contrast to generic proteasome hypomorphs, which are extremely sensitive to these drugs (51London M.K. Keck B.I. Ramos P.C. Dohmen R.J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 52Stitzel M.L. Durso R. Reese J.C. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, the hyper-resistance phenotypes to 4-NQO and MMS can distinguish assembly deficiency from general impairment of proteasome function. The pocket lysine mutants showed a strong resistance to 4-NQO and MMS (Fig. 1F), consistent with their marked CP assembly defects. In addition, substantial growth defects were evident for α4K63A, α6K62A, and α1Y71K mutants. These three mutants were also hypersensitive to proteotoxic stresses such as CdCl2 and canavanine (Fig. 1F). To better understand the defects of the pocket lysine mutants in proteasome assembly, we analyzed CP precursors and proteasome holoenzymes from α4K63A, α5K66A, and α6K62A mutants by mass spectrometry. In the CP assembly pathway, the α ring is formed first and then serves as a template for the β ring (47Murata S. Yashiroda H. Tanaka K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 104-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). α ring formation employs two pairs of chaperone complexes, Pba1-Pba2 and Pba3-Pba4. Pba3-Pba4 assists in the positioning of α subunits to initiate α ring assembly (41Kusmierczyk A.R. Kunjappu M.J. Funakoshi M. Hochstrasser M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). During this process, Pba1-Pba2 prevents self-dimerization between α rings (53Hirano Y. Hendil K.B. Yashiroda H. Iemura S. Nagane R. Hioki Y. Natsume T. Tanaka K. Murata S. Nature. 2005; 437: 1381-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and premature association of α rings with the RP (54Kusmierczyk A.R. Kunjappu M.J. Kim R.Y. Hochstrasser M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 622-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), presumably by occupying two of the α pockets (54Kusmierczy"
https://openalex.org/W2032516953,"Mouse mast cell protease-4 (mMCP-4) has been linked to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, although the exact mechanisms underlying its role in these pathological conditions remain unclear. Here, we have found that mMCP-4 is critical in a mouse model of the autoimmune skin blistering disease bullous pemphigoid (BP). Mice lacking mMCP-4 were resistant to experimental BP. Complement activation, mast cell (MC) degranulation, and the early phase of neutrophil (PMN) recruitment occurred comparably in mMCP-4(-/-) and WT mice. However, without mMCP-4, activation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 was impaired in cultured mMCP-4(-/-) MCs and in the skin of pathogenic IgG-injected mMCP-4(-/-) mice. MMP-9 activation was not fully restored by local reconstitution with WT or mMCP-4(-/-) PMNs. Local reconstitution with mMCP-4(+/+) MCs, but not with mMCP-4(-/-) MCs, restored blistering, MMP-9 activation, and PMN recruitment in mMCP-4(-/-) mice. mMCP-4 also degraded the hemidesmosomal transmembrane protein BP180 both in the skin and in vitro. These results demonstrate that mMCP-4 plays two different roles in the pathogenesis of experimental BP, by both activating MMP-9 and by cleaving BP180, leading to injury of the hemidesmosomes and extracellular matrix of the basement membrane zone."

https://openalex.org/W2047249890,"The proteasome is a large and complex protease formed by 66 polypeptides. The assembly of the proteasome is assisted by at least nine chaperones. One of these chaperones, Nas2/p27, binds to the C-terminal region of the AAA-ATPase Rpt5. We report here that the tail of Rpt5 provides two functions. First, it facilitates the previously reported interaction with the proteasome core particle (CP). Second, it is essential for the interaction with Nas2. Deletion of the C-terminal amino acid of Rpt5 disrupts the CP interaction, but not the binding to Nas2. The latter is surprising considering Nas2 contains a PDZ domain, which is often involved in binding to C termini. Interestingly, deletion of the last three amino acids interferes with both functions. The disruption of the Rpt5-CP interactions gave distinct phenotypes different from disruption of the Nas2-Rpt5 interaction. Additionally, proteasomes purified from a Saccharomyces cerevisiae rpt5-Δ3 strain show a strong enrichment of Ecm29. The function of Ecm29, a proteasome-associated protein, is not well understood. Our data show that Ecm29 can inhibit proteasomes, because our Ecm29-containing proteasomes have reduced suc-LLVY-AMC hydrolytic activity. Consistent with this apparent role as negative regulator, the deletion of ECM29 rescues the phenotypes of rpt5-Δ3 and nas2Δ in an hsm3Δ background. In sum, the interactions facilitated by the tail of Rpt5 act synergistically to minimize the formation of faulty proteasomes, thereby preventing recognition and inhibition by Ecm29."

Here we demonstrate that ΔNp63α, a p63 isoform lacking the N-terminal transactivation domain, induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in primary human keratinocytes in a TGF-β-dependent manner. Rapidly proliferating normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) were infected with retroviral vector expressing ΔNp63α or empty vector and serially subcultured until replicative senescence. No phenotypic changes were observed until the culture reached senescence. Then the ΔNp63α-transduced cells underwent morphological changes resembling mesenchymal cells and acquired the EMT phenotype. Treatment with exogenous TGF-β accelerated EMT in presenescent ΔNp63α-transduced cells, whereas the inhibition of TGF-β signaling reversed the EMT phenotype. TGF-β treatment alone led to growth arrest in control NHEK with no evidence of EMT, indicating that ΔNp63α altered the cellular response to TGF-β treatment. ΔNp63α-transduced cells acquiring EMT gained the ability to be differentiated to osteo-/odontogenic and adipogenic pathways, resembling mesenchymal stem cells. Furthermore, these cells expressed enhanced levels of Nanog and Lin28, which are transcription factors associated with pluripotency. These data indicate that EMT required ΔNp63α transduction and intact TGF-β signaling in NHEK. p63 is a p53 family protein required for morphogenesis and postnatal regeneration of epithelial tissues.

ΔNp63α protein triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transition and confers stem cell properties in normal human keratinocytes.Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 287Issue 16PreviewVOLUME 286 (2011) PAGES 38757–38767 Full-Text PDF Open Access p63 is a member of the p53 gene family, along with p73, that shares sequence and functional homologies (1Yang A.

Cell. 1998; 2: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar). p63 is transcribed from two distinct promoters, resulting in TAp63 and ΔNp63 isoforms, based on alternative transcription start sites, and additional α, β, and γ isoforms, resulting from varied C-terminal lengths. p63 is highly expressed in basal cell nuclei of stratified epithelia in adult skin and absent in the underlying connective tissues. TAp63 is expressed in the early stage of skin morphogenesis and is responsible for initiation of epithelial stratification (2Koster M.I. Kim S. Mills A.A. DeMayo F.J. Roop D.R. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mature epithelium primarily expresses ΔNp63, which is required for keratinocyte terminal differentiation and basement membrane integrity (3Koster M.I. Dai D. Marinari B. Sano Y. Costanzo A. Karin M. Roop D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3255-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Embryonic knock-out of the p63 gene in mice resulted in impaired craniofacial, skin, and limb development and embryonic lethality (4Mills A.A. Zheng B. Wang X.J. Vogel H. Roop D.R. Bradley A. Nature. 1999; 398: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar, 5Yang A. Schweitzer R. Sun D. Kaghad M. Walker N. Bronson R.T. Tabin C. Sharpe A. Caput D. Crum C. McKeon F. Nature. 1999; 398: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar). The most striking feature of these knock-out mice was the complete absence of stratified epithelium of skin, oral mucosa, and gut as well as other epithelial tissues. When p63 was deleted postnatally, mice exhibited shortened life span, features of accelerated aging, and cellular senescence (6Keyes W.M. Wu Y. Vogel H. Guo X. Lowe S.W. Mills A.A. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1986-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Because p63 is involved in epithelial stem cell maintenance (7Pellegrini G. Dellambra E. Golisano O. Martinelli E. Fantozzi I. Bondanza S. Ponzin D. McKeon F. De Luca M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 3156-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar), lack of epithelial structure in p63 knock-out mice may result from premature senescence of epithelial stem cells. These studies underscore the importance of p63 in morphogenesis and homeostasis of epithelial tissues, especially for keratinocytes, although the detailed mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) 2The abbreviations used are: EMTepithelial-mesenchymal transitionNHEKnormal human epidermal keratinocytesMSCmesenchymal stem celliMSCinduced MSCE-CadE-cadherinFNfibronectinK7 and K14keratin 7 and 14, respectivelyTβRTGF-β receptorTβRI-iTGF-β receptor I inhibitorHMLEhuman epithelial cell linesWCEwhole cell extractSCCsquamous cell carcinoma(a)DSPdentin sialoproteinDPSCdental pulp stem cellsSCAPstem cells of apical papillaeNHOFnormal human oral fibroblastsNHOKnormal human oral keratinocytesPDpopulation doublingsqPCRquantitative PCRSPside populationALPalkaline phosphatase. is a process by which epithelial cells lose their characteristics to gain mesenchymal phenotype, and this process is known to play crucial roles in embryogenesis, wound healing, cancer invasion, and metastasis. Through EMT, the cells lose epithelium-specific protein expressions, such as those of cytokeratins and E-cadherin (E-Cad), and enhance the expression of fibronectin (FN), vimentin, and N-Cad, resulting in increased cell motility (8Cavallaro U. Christofori G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 118-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar, 9Kalluri R. Weinberg R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 1420-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (7457) Google Scholar). EMT may occur as part of embryogenesis or wound healing and in disease processes, such as organ fibrosis and cancer metastasis. Although EMT may be induced by a plethora of signaling pathways, activation of TGF-β signaling plays critical roles in EMT either through its downstream Smad signaling or through a Smad-independent pathway (10Xu J. Lamouille S. Derynck R. Cell Res. 2009; 19: 156-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). Smad signaling is triggered by activation of the TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII) upon binding of extracellular TGF-β ligand, which then recruits TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI), causing subsequent phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad2/3 (11Moustakas A. Pardali K. Gaal A. Heldin C.H. Immunol. Lett. 2002; 82: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 12Shi Y. Massagué J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4867) Google Scholar). Independent of Smad, TGF-β may lead to EMT through activation of ERK MAPK, Rho GTPases, and the PI3K/Akt pathways (10Xu J. Lamouille S. Derynck R. Cell Res. 2009; 19: 156-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). In addition, TGF-β up-regulates Snail and ZEB family proteins, which are the key transcription factors responsible for EMT (13Jamora C. Lee P. Kocieniewski P. Azhar M. Hosokawa R. Chai Y. Fuchs E. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e11Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 14Shirakihara T. Saitoh M. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3533-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Some studies show cooperative effects of TGF-β and other factors, such as activated Ras, in causing EMT, suggesting that TGF-β alone may not be sufficient in certain cell types (15Davies M. Robinson M. Smith E. Huntley S. Prime S. Paterson I. J.

EMT has been demonstrated in human cells using various methods. Overexpression of TGF-β, Snail, or Twist induced EMT in HMLE, human mammary epithelial cells immortalized with SV40 large T antigen (16Mani S.A. Guo W. Liao M.J. Eaton E.N. Ayyanan A. Zhou A.Y.

EMT was also observed in MCF10A, immortalized human breast epithelial cell line, by transduction of ΔNp63γ, through enhanced TGF-β production (17Lindsay J. McDade S.S. Pickard A. McCloskey K.D. McCance D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 3915-3924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Primary human mammary epithelial cells underwent EMT when exposed to exogenous TGF-β protein alone without any additional factors (18Lindley L.E. Briegel K.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 399: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some of these studies show a gain of stemlike properties in cells after conversion through EMT. Both HMLE and human mammary epithelial cells exhibited CD24low/CD44high surface marker profiles, which are linked with normal mammary and cancer stem cells, as well as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (19Al-Hajj M. Wicha M.S. Benito-Hernandez A. Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 3983-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (8512) Google Scholar, 20Sleeman K.E. Kendrick H. Ashworth A.

Res. 2009; 88: 792-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). Another study showed multilineage differentiation capacity of HMLE into osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic pathways through EMT (22Battula V.L. Evans K.W. Hollier B.G. Shi Y. Marini F.C. Ayyanan A. Wang R.Y. Brisken C. Guerra R. Andreeff M. Mani S.A. Stem Cells. 2010; 28: 1435-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). These studies raise a hypothesis that EMT may be a novel approach to reprogram normal human epithelial cells to acquire multipotency and transdifferentiation. However, a great deal of research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms, cell type specificity, functional resemblance or dissimilarity with MSCs, and tumorigenic potential. Most prior studies demonstrate EMT in human mammary epithelial cells, and no report has shown EMT in primary human keratinocytes. In this report, we demonstrate EMT in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) by transduction of ΔNp63α in a TGF-β-dependent manner. Our data show the transdifferentiation ability of ΔNp63α in NHEK into osteo-/odontogenic and adipogenic pathways and phenotypic and functional resemblance to MSCs. Hence, altering the p63 level in NHEK may be a novel approach in generating “induced MSCs” with multipotent capacity. Primary NHEK were prepared from foreskin epidermal tissues according to the methods described elsewhere (23Kang M.K. Bibb C. Baluda M.A. Rey O. Park N.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The epithelial tissues were obtained from discarded surgical specimens according to the approval and guidelines of the UCLA Institutional Review Board. The primary cells were maintained in EpiLife medium supplemented with the growth factors (Invitrogen). These cells were serially subcultured, being passaged at 60–70% confluence levels until they reached senescence, and the replication kinetics were determined as described previously (23Kang M.K. Bibb C. Baluda M.A. Rey O. Park N.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For some experiments, keratinocyte differentiation was induced by Ca2+ exposure for 3 days at 1.5 mm. Normal human oral fibroblasts (NHOF) were obtained from gingival connective tissue explants and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen). SCC9 was cultured according to the methods described previously (24Kang M.K. Guo W. Park N.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 85-95PubMed Google Scholar). DPSC and SCAP were cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% FBS (Invitrogen). Primary human sebocyte culture was obtained from Celprogen (San Pedro, CA) and maintained in Sebocyte culture medium from the same vendor supplemented with 10% FBS. We constructed retroviral vectors expressing wild-type ΔNp63α or TAp63α. Full-length cDNAs of ΔNp63α and TAp63α were cloned from the cDNA library obtained from primary human keratinocytes by PCR amplification using the following primers: ΔNp63α-Forward, 5′-CGGCTCGAGATGTTGTACCTGGAAAACAAT-3′; TAp63α-Forward, 5′-CGGCTCGAGATGAATTTTGAAACTTCA-3′; Reverse (common for both ΔNp63α and TAp63α), 5′-CGGGGATCCTCACTCCCCCTCCTCTTTG-3′. ΔNp63α and TAp63α cDNAs were then subcloned into pLXSN retroviral expression vector (Clontech) at XhoI/BamHI restriction sites (underlined sequences). The resulting clones were sequenced to confirm their isoform. Retroviral vector construction and infection were performed according to the methods described elsewhere (25Kang M.K. Park N.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 151-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The infected cells were selected with 200 μg/ml G418 (Sigma), and drug-resistant cells were maintained in serial subculture as described above. Total RNA was isolated from the cultured cells using the High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche Applied Science). DNA-free total RNA (5 μg) was dissolved in 15 μl of H2O, and the RT reaction was performed in the first strand buffer containing 300 units of Superscript II (Invitrogen), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μg of random hexamer (Promega, Madison, WI), and 125 μm dNTP mixture (Promega). qPCR was performed in triplicates for each sample with LC480 SYBR Green I master (Roche Applied Science) using universal cycling conditions on a LightCycler 480 (Roche Applied Science). A total of 50 cycles were executed, and the second derivative Cq value determination method was used to compare -fold differences. The primer sequences for RT-qPCR are shown in supplemental Table S1. Genomic DNA was extracted from cultured cells using the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen). Relative telomere length was determined by using the approach as previously described (26Cawthon R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e47Crossref PubMed Scopus (2567) Google Scholar). We also assayed for telomerase activity in cells using the quantitative telomeric repeat amplification protocol (Q-TRAP) assay (27Liu L. Ishihara K. Ichimura T. Fujita N. Hino S. Tomita S. Watanabe S. Saitoh N. Ito T. Nakao M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 5165-5174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Complete methods are described in the supplemental material. Whole cell extract (WCE) from cultured cells was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon protein membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and probed with the following antibodies: Inv and FN (Sigma); Snail-1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA); and p63/4A4, ΔNp63/N16, E-Cad, K14, p16INK4A, Twist, GAPDH, and β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Chemiluminescence signal was detected using the HyGLO Chemiluminescent HRP antibody detection reagent (Denville Scientific Inc., South Plainfield, NJ). Scratch wound assay was performed as described previously (28Liang C.C. Park A.Y. Guan J.L. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (3193) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were seeded at 1.5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well tissue culture plates. After cells reached 100% confluence level, a wound was made in the center of each well. Photographs were taken immediately or after 12 or 24 h of wounding. Cell migration was quantitated by measuring the area remaining from the original wounding, using Scion Image software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Cell migration was measured using transwell chambers with polycarbonate membranes (Corning Glass), according to the methods described elsewhere (29Giannelli G. Falk-Marzillier J. Schiraldi O. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quaranta V. Science. 1997; 277: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in the upper chamber of a transwell in EpiLife (Invitrogen) and were allowed to migrate for 24 h. The transwell was then washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 10% formalin for 10 min, and stained with 1% crystal violet dissolved in 10% formalin for 1 h. After removing the non-migratory cells from the chamber, the transwells were photographed under phase-contrast microscopy. Migrated cells were measured by counting the number of cells that had crossed the membrane. A TGF-β1 ELISA was performed according to the protocol (BD OptEIA Set Human TGF-β1; BD Biosciences). To measure secreted TGF-β1 level by NHEK, supernatants at low population doublings (PDs) with or without ΔNp63α transduction, senescent NHEK (PD 23), and NHEK/ΔNp63α-M (PD 25) were collected and centrifuged to remove any particulate materials. Briefly, 96-well microplates were coated with purified anti-human TGF-β1 antibody overnight at 4 °C. The plates were then blocked with an assay diluent for 1 h and incubated with the collected samples for 2 h. The plates were incubated with the substrate solution for 30 min, and the substrate reaction was stopped using the stop solution. The samples were read at 450 nm by a microplate reader within 20 min. The standard curve was established according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the reading value was normalized against cellular protein amount. TGF-β-responsive promoter activities were measured by p3TP-Luc plasmid, which is one of the standard reporters for assessing TGF-β activity. Prior to transfection, a 6-well plate with ∼5 × 104 cells/well was inoculated and cultured for 24 h. p3TP-Luc plasmid (3 μg/well) was introduced into cells using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Transfection efficiencies were controlled by pRL-SV40 plasmid (2 ng/well) containing the Renilla luciferase cDNA under the control of SV40 enhancer/promoter. Cells were treated with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) after 24 h post-transfection for 24 h and then collected, and the lysates were prepared using the Dual Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). p3TP-Luc activity was determined as the mean of at least triplicates per experiment. Following trypsinization, the cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 4 °C. The cells were suspended in 2% FBS for a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml for 10 min at 4 °C. Monoclonal antibodies against human CD24 (conjugated with FITC) and CD44 (conjugated with allophycocyanin) were added to the cell suspension and incubated at 4 °C in the dark for 1 h. The labeled cells were resuspended in PBS containing 3% FBS after washing with the incubation buffer and then analyzed using a BD FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The fluorophore-conjugated antibodies were obtained from BD Biosciences. For the Hoechst dye exclusion assay, the cells were resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 2% FBS and then incubated with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) for 90 min at 37 °C. A parallel aliquot of cells was stained with Hoechst 33342 after pretreatment with 40 nm reserpine (Sigma) for 10 min at 37 °C. After washing the cells with PBS, the cells were kept in 500 μl of PBS containing 3% FBS in ice and analyzed for Hoechst 33342 dye efflux using a BD FACSAria II cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Hoechst 33342 dye was excited at 350 nm using a UV laser. Side population (SP) was defined as reported previously (30Matsuzaki Y. Kinjo K. Mulligan R.C. Okano H. Immunity. 2004; 20: 87-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min and then permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Blocking was carried out in 10% normal goat serum for 1 h. Rabbit polyclonal anti-E-Cad (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and Alexa Fluor®488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) were used as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. Cells were counterstained with DAPI. Images were obtained using an Olympus BH2-RFCA fluorescence microscope under appropriate filters. Cells were placed at 1.5 × 105 cells/cm2 in 6-well plates. When the culture reached confluence, osteo-/odontogenic differentiation was induced in calcifying conditions (100 μm l-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 nm dexamethasone, 0.18 mm KH2PO4, 5 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate) in α-minimum Eagle's medium containing 15% FBS. After 7 days of induction, the cells were stained for ALP activity in situ using an ALP staining kit (Sigma). To determine formation of mineralized nodules in vitro, cells were cultured to confluence and exposed to calcifying conditions for up to 3 weeks. The cultures were fixed in 70% ethanol for 1 h at 4 °C, rinsed in 1× PBS, and stained for 10 min with 40 mm Alizarin Red solution (pH 4.2) at room temperature. The cells were then rinsed five times in H2O, followed by a 15-min wash in 1× PBS to eliminate nonspecific staining. Rapidly proliferating NHOF or NHEK/ΔNp63α-M were placed at 1 × 105 cells/cm2 in 12-well plates. When the culture reached confluence, adipogenic differentiation was induced in induction medium (DMEM, 10% FBS, 60 μm indomethacin, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 μm dexamethasone, 5 μg/ml insulin, and 5 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate), as described previously (31Gronthos S. Mankani M. Brahim J. Robey P.G. Shi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 13625-13630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3415) Google Scholar). Basal, non-inducing medium consisted of DMEM, 10% FBS, and 5 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate. After 3 weeks of induction, cells were washed once with PBS and fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were washed in 60% isopropyl alcohol and stained for 1 h with 0.3% Oil Red O (Sigma). After three consecutive washes in deionized water, the stained cells were photographed using bright field microscopy. We constructed retroviral vectors expressing ΔNp63α (LXSN-ΔNp63α) or TAp63α (LXSN-TAp63α). Rapidly proliferating NHEK were infected with these viral vectors along with the empty vector (LXSN). To confirm expression of the transgenes, we performed Western blotting using pan-p63 and ΔNp63-specific antibodies (Fig. 1A). SCC9 was included as a control because it lacks endogenous p63 expression. NHEK infected with empty vector exhibited two bands approximately at 63 and 75 kDa and lacked expression of endogenous TAp63. Transduction of ΔNp63α led to a specific band near 63 kDa in both SCC9 and NHEK, and TAp63α transduction led to a single band at ∼80 kDa. ΔNp63α overexpression in the transduced cells was confirmed by RT-qPCR (supplemental Fig. S1A). Interestingly, ectopic ΔNp63α expression in NHEK reduced the level of the ΔNp63 band at ∼75 kDa. NHEK infected with LXSN or LXSN-TAp63α (denoted NHEK/LXSN and NHEK/TAp63α, respectively) replicated for 32 PDs and senesced (Fig. 1B). Replicating cultures of NHEK expressed ΔNp63 isoforms, which were drastically lost in cells approaching subculture-induced senescence (supplemental Fig. S1B). NHEK infected with LXSN-ΔNp63α (NHEK/ΔNp63α) followed the replication profiles of NHEK/LXSN and NHEK/TAp63α and did not show any phenotypic alteration, including cell morphology or replication kinetics. When the culture entered the senescing phase past PD 30, NHEK/ΔNp63α exhibited morphological changes resembling mesenchymal cells (Fig. 1C). These cells were designated NHEK/ΔNp63α-M to reflect their mesenchymal phenotype. Occurrence of EMT by ΔNp63α transduction in NHEK was determined by assessing the expression of respective molecular markers. Western blotting was performed for FN, E-Cad, and keratin 14 (K14) in NHEK/LXSN or NHEK/ΔNp63α using WCE (Fig. 2A). FN expression level increased in NHEK/LXSN with increase in PD numbers. ΔNp63α transduction led to stronger induction of FN, higher than that of NHOF. E-Cad and K14 levels were unaltered in NHEK/LXSN during subcultures. At PD 26, NHEK/ΔNp63α showed similar levels of E-Cad and K14 as the controls but completely lost expression of these proteins at higher PDs. Loss of E-Cad and K14 expression coincided with the point at which NHEK/ΔNp63α acquired the mesenchymal morphology at PD 32 (Figs. 1B and 2A). Likewise, expression of Snail, which is linked with EMT (32Peinado H. Olmeda D. Cano A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 415-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (2585) Google Scholar), was observed in NHEK/ΔNp63α-M at PD 39 but not at PD 26 nor in NHEK/LXSN (Fig. 2B). In addition, NHEK/ΔNp63α-M cells expressed a negligible level of involucrin, which is a marker of keratinocyte differentiation (23Kang M.K. Bibb C. Baluda M.A. Rey O. Park N.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and their response to increased Ca2+ level was drastically reduced (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that ectopic ΔNp63α expression in NHEK triggers EMT. Enhanced cell migration is a hallmark of EMT phenotype (33Vuoriluoto K. Haugen H. Kiviluoto S. Mpindi J.P. Nevo J. Gjerdrum C. Tiron C. Lorens J.B. Ivaska J. Oncogene. 2011; 30: 1436-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the next experiment, we performed an in vitro scratch assay with NHEK/LXSN, NHEK/TAp63α, NHEK/ΔNp63α, and NHEK/ΔNp63α-M to compare cell migration capacity. After the cultures reached confluence, a scratch wound was made to induce cell migration, and the cultures were photographed at 0, 12, and 24 h after wounding (Fig. 3A). During the 24-h period, NHEK/LXSN and NHEK/TAp63α showed limited migration, and the wound closure was not complete. NHEK/ΔNp63α showed a similar degree of limited migration, but NHEK/ΔNp63α-M acquired enhanced migration, which led to complete closure of wound after 24 h. When we assessed cell migration in transwell inserts, NHEK/ΔNp63α-M demonstrated notably increased migration compared with the other cell types (Fig. 3B). These data provide functional evidence of EMT in NHEK/ΔNp63α-M. Next, we tested the possibility that NHEK/ΔNp63α-M cells represent contaminating sebocytes, which comprise sebaceous glands of skin. We assayed for the expression of sebocyte markers (e.g. keratin 7 (K7) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)) (34Thiboutot D. Jabara S. McAllister J.M. Sivarajah A. Gilliland K.

Acta. 2007; 1771: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). As shown in supplemental Fig. S2A, K7 and PPARγ were uniquely expressed in primary human sebocytes but not in NHEK, even after the occurrence of EMT by ΔNp63α transduction. Morphologically, sebocytes differ from NHEK exhibiting the EMT phenotype (supplemental Fig. S2B). Thus, sebocyte contamination in NHEK culture is unlikely. Our data show that EMT phenotype in NHEK/ΔNp63α did not appear until the cells entered the senescing phase past PD 30 (Fig. 1C). This indicates that ΔNp63α requires an additional endogenous factor that only appears in senescing cells. Because TGF-β accumulates in subcultured NHEK to mediate senescence-associated differentiation (36Kim R.H. Lieberman M.B. Lee R. Shin K.H. Mehrazarin S. Oh J.E. Park N.H. Kang M.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2010; 316: 2600-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that ΔNp63α cooperates with TGF-β to induce EMT. To test this possibility, we compared the kinetics at which EMT occurred in NHEK/ΔNp63α with and without exogenous TGF-β. ΔNp63α transduction alone led to EMT phenotype after 25 days postinfection, and the number of EMT cells had since increased exponentially (Fig. 4A). NHEK/ΔNp63α-M appeared after 6 days of TGF-β treatment (5 ng/ml), notably faster than the control culture, although the exponential kinetics remained the same. Exogenous TGF-β treatment caused growth inhibition and terminal differentiation in control NHEK (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. S3). TGF-β also led to growth suppression in NHEK/ΔNp63α before emergence of cells demonstrating the EMT phenotype. Thus, ΔNp63α did not evade TGF-β-induced gr"
https://openalex.org/W2011218054,"MOZ (monocytic leukemic zinc-finger protein) and MORF (MOZ-related factor) are histone acetyltransferases important for HOX gene expression as well as embryo and postnatal development. They form complexes with other regulatory subunits through the scaffold proteins BRPF1/2/3 (bromodomain-PHD (plant homeodomain) finger proteins 1, 2, or 3). BRPF proteins have multiple domains, including two PHD fingers, for potential interactions with histones. Here we show that the first PHD finger of BRPF2 specifically recognizes the N-terminal tail of unmodified histone H3 (unH3) and report the solution structures of this PHD finger both free and in complex with the unH3 peptide. Structural analysis revealed that the unH3 peptide forms a third antiparallel β-strand that pairs with the PHD1 two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. The binding specificity was determined primarily through the recognition of arginine 2 and lysine 4 of the unH3 by conserved aspartic acids of PHD1 and of threonine 6 of the unH3 by a conserved asparagine. Isothermal titration calorimetry and NMR assays showed that post-translational modifications such as H3R2me2as, H3T3ph, H3K4me, H3K4ac, and H3T6ph antagonized the interaction between histone H3 and PHD1. Furthermore, histone binding by PHD1 was important for BRPF2 to localize to the HOXA9 locus in vivo. PHD1 is highly conserved in yeast NuA3 and other histone acetyltransferase complexes, so the results reported here also shed light on the function and regulation of these complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2022498921,"SMYD2 belongs to a subfamily of histone lysine methyltransferase and was recently identified to methylate tumor suppressor p53 and Rb. Here we report that SMYD2 prefers to methylate p53 Lys-370 over histone substrates in vitro. Consistently, the level of endogenous p53 Lys-370 monomethylation is significantly elevated when SMYD2 is overexpressed in vivo. We have solved the high resolution crystal structures of the full-length SMYD2 protein in binary complex with its cofactor S-adenosylmethionine and in ternary complex with cofactor product S-adenosylhomocysteine and p53 substrate peptide (residues 368-375), respectively. p53 peptide binds to a deep pocket of the interface between catalytic SET(1-282) and C-terminal domain (CTD) with an unprecedented U-shaped conformation. Subtle conformational change exists around the p53 binding site between the binary and ternary structures, in particular the tetratricopeptide repeat motif of the CTD. In addition, a unique EDEE motif between the loop of anti-parallel β7 and β8 sheets of the SET core not only interacts with p53 substrate but also forms a hydrogen bond network with residues from CTD. These observations suggest that the tetratricopeptide repeat and EDEE motif may play an important role in determining p53 substrate binding specificity. This is further verified by the findings that deletion of the CTD domain drastically reduces the methylation activity of SMYD2 to p53 protein. Meanwhile, mutation of EDEE residues impairs both the binding and the enzymatic activity of SMYD2 to p53 Lys-370. These data together reveal the molecular basis of SMYD2 in specifically recognizing and regulating functions of p53 tumor suppressor through Lys-370 monomethylation."

As one of the major adhesion complexes on endothelial cells, it plays a vital role in adhesion and migration along the extracellular matrix.

The levels of α5β1 integrin on the cell surface are maintained by recycling of endocytosed complexes back to the plasma membrane (PM). Internalization of the α5β1 integrin complexes occurs via both clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent endocytic pathways (4Caswell P.T. Vadrevu S. Norman J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 843-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Subsequently, these complexes traffic to early endosomes (EEs) and then to the perinuclear recycling compartment, from which they are recycled to the PM (5Roberts M.S. Woods A.J. Dale T.C.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1505-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Binding of fibronectin to the α5β1 integrin triggers endocytosis that does not involve integrin recycling; in this case the integrin complexes move from the EEs into the multivesicular endosomes for degradation (8Lobert V.H.

This phenomenon highlights the importance of α5β1 integrin trafficking at the EE compartment in regulating integrin levels at the PM. Members of the SNARE family of proteins participate in vesicular fusion events during the intracellular transport of cargo molecules from a donor vesicle to a target membrane along the endocytic and secretory transport pathways (9Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 10Hong W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1744: 493-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). As each SNARE has a precise subcellular distribution, it has been suggested that selective interactions between SNAREs contribute to the specificity of membrane exchanges between intracellular compartments. This concept has been documented by in vitro and permeabilized cell studies (11McNew J.A. Parlati F. Fukuda R. Johnston R.J. Paz K. Paumet F. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E.

Neuron. 2000; 26: 457-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). SNAREs are operationally divided into two groups: those found primarily on the transport vesicle, known as v-SNAREs (or VAMPs), and those found primarily on the target membrane, called t-SNAREs (syntaxins and SNAPs) (9Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 10Hong W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1744: 493-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The demonstration that VAMPs and SNAPs are involved in α5β1 integrin trafficking suggested that SNARE proteins more generally play roles in the regulation of integrin trafficking (6Gonon E.M.

Recently, we showed that the functional t-SNARE syntaxin 6 is required for the post-Golgi trafficking of VEGFR2/KDR/Flk-1 in vitro, and for VEGF-induced angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo (17Manickam V. Tiwari A. Jung J.J. Bhattacharya R. Goel A. Mukhopadhyay D. Choudhury A. Blood. 2011; 117: 1425-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In epithelial cells and fibroblasts, syntaxin 6 localizes not only to the Golgi apparatus, but also to EEs, where it interacts with early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) (17Manickam V. Tiwari A. Jung J.J.

The EE is one of the major vesicular compartments from which integrins are sorted into the recycling and degradative (endo-lysosomal) pathways (8Lobert V.H. Brech A. Pedersen N.M. Wesche J. Oppelt A.

Traffic. 2006; 7: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In the current study, we show that syntaxin 6 is present at the EEs within human ECs, and that it colocalizes with α5β1 integrin at these locations. We investigated the possibility that EE-localized syntaxin 6 regulates endocytic sorting of α5β1 integrin complexes and, thereby, surface integrin-mediated EC migration. We found that when syntaxin 6 function was inhibited, EC adhesion to fibronectin was decreased. Consistent with these findings, trafficking of α5β1 integrin complexes from the EEs to the PM was impaired, and more of the complexes were transported to the late endosomes (LEs) and lysosomes for degradation. As a result of the decrease in PM levels of α5β1 integrin, the integrin-dependent signaling associated with cell spreading and migration was severely compromised. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that syntaxin 6 regulates the movement of ECs along fibronectin by facilitating endocytic, PM-targeted sorting of the α5β1 integrin complex.

Primary human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) were obtained from Lonza (Walkersville, MD), and cultures were maintained on collagen-coated plates in complete medium (endothelial-cell basal medium containing supplements from Lonza). HUVECs were used only between passages 3 and 7. Most of the experiments were carried out with HUVECs cultured on fibronectin (10 μg/ml)-coated surfaces. Recombinant adenoviruses expressing the cytosolic domains of syntaxin 6 and syntaxin 16 (designated syntaxin 6-cyto and syntaxin 16-cyto, respectively) were used as described previously (17Manickam V. Tiwari A. Jung J.J. Bhattacharya R. Goel A. Mukhopadhyay D. Choudhury A. Blood. 2011; 117: 1425-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Choudhury A. Marks D.L. Proctor K.M. Gould G.W. Pagano R.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Except as noted, cells were infected with the indicated adenovirus (titer ∼1.5 × 107 pfu/ml), at a multiplicity of infection of 1:75, in serum-free culture medium. The virus-containing medium was replaced 12 h later with normal medium supplemented with 10% FBS. The cells were used in experiments 12–24 h later. RNAi-mediated knockdown was performed using Silencer Select pre-designed siRNAs against human syntaxin 6 (siSTX6; 5′-GCAACUGAAUUGAGUAUAA-3′) and human syntaxin 16 (siSTX16; 5′-CAGCGAUUGGUGUGACAAA-3′), as described previously (17Manickam V. Tiwari A. Jung J.J. Bhattacharya R. Goel A. Mukhopadhyay D. Choudhury A. Blood. 2011; 117: 1425-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). HUVECs were electroporated with STX6- or STX16-specific siRNA oligonucleotides, using the HUVEC Nucleofector Kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) and the protocols recommended by Amaxa Biosystems (Gaithersburg, MD). The extent of protein knockdown was determined by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence assay 72 h after electroporation. 24-well cell culture dishes were coated with 10 μg/ml of collagen (heterotrimer composed of two α1 chains and one α2 chain), fibronectin, vitronectin, and laminin-1 (is a heterotrimer, composed of α1β1γ1 chain) overnight at 4 °C, and blocked with 2% heat-denatured BSA in PBS for 1 h. 24-h following infection with syntaxin-cyto, cells were harvested by trypsinization and collected by centrifugation in the presence of soybean trypsin inhibitor (20 μg/ml). Cells were allowed to adhere to dishes for different time periods at 37 °C in adhesion buffer (HEPES-buffered Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 2 mmol/liter of MgCl2, 2 mmol/liter of CaCl2, and 0.2 mmol/liter of MnCl2). In the integrin-blocking experiments, cells were suspended with antibodies against either β1 (P4C10; 50 μg/ml) or β3 (B3A; 50 μg/ml) integrin subunits and, intergrin heterodimers, either α5β1 (JBS5; 50 μg/ml) or αvβ3 (LM609; 50 μg/ml), and then allowed to adhere for different times at 37 °C. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing each well four times with adhesion buffer. Adherent cells were then fixed for 15 min, using 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and stained with a 2% crystal violet solution. After extensive washing in water to remove excess crystal violet, plates were dried overnight. Crystal violet was extracted by incubating the plates in 10% acetic acid for 15 min, after which absorbance at 562 nm was measured as an indicator of the number of cells bound. Each experiment was performed in triplicate (triplicate samples per condition). The data are presented as the percentage of adhesion exhibited by the positive control (adhesion medium alone) ± S.D. Microscopy and image analysis were performed using procedures described previously (17Manickam V. Tiwari A. Jung J.J. Bhattacharya R. Goel A. Mukhopadhyay D. Choudhury A. Blood. 2011; 117: 1425-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on acid-washed glass coverslips. They were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in Dulbecco's modified phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 25 min at room temperature (RT), quenched with 100 mm glycine in PBS for 15 min at RT and washed with PBS. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min at RT, blocked with PBS containing 5% glycine and 5% normal goat or donkey serum for 60 min, and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Slides were incubated for 1 h in a 1:100 dilution of either Alexa Fluor 488- or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary Ab, and mounted using Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI. Fluorescent images were acquired using a Leica spinning-disk confocal microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu EM-CCD digital camera (Hamamatsu Photonics) and “Metamorph” image acquisition and processing software (Molecular Devices Corp., Downingtown, PA). All images were acquired using a ×63, 1.3 NA objective. In any given experiment, all photomicrographs were exposed and processed identically for a given fluorophore. Images were corrected for background fluorescence using unlabeled specimens. For double labeling experiments, control samples were labeled identically with the individual fluorophores and exposed identically to the dual-labeled samples at each wavelength to verify that there was no crossover between emission channels at the exposure settings. For immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation studies, cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented with inhibitors of proteases and phosphatases as described previously (17Manickam V. Tiwari A. Jung J.J. Bhattacharya R. Goel A. Mukhopadhyay D. Choudhury A. Blood. 2011; 117: 1425-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and then immunoblotted. Ab binding was visualized using the ECL reagent. For immunoprecipitation studies, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing a protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture. Lysates were precleared with uncoupled protein A or G beads, and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with Ab-coupled beads. Immune complexes were washed with lysis buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. To measure recycling of the surface pool of α5β1 integrin, we covalently labeled cell surface proteins using a membrane-impermeant biotinylation reagent (NHS-SS-biotin; Pierce) as described previously (17Manickam V.

Norman J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1392-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Samples were then incubated at 16 °C for an additional 30 min, to allow internalized α5β1 integrin to accumulate in EEs. Biotin remaining at the cell surface was removed by reduction with sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (MesNa). MesNa was quenched by the addition of 20 mm iodoacetamide for 10 min. The cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS. Intracellular, biotin-labeled α5β1 integrin complexes were further chased at 37 °C, to allow integrins to recycle to the PM. In some experiments, the extent of α5β1 recycling was assessed after each time point of the 37 °C chase; in this case, cells were immediately returned to ice at the time point, and biotin was removed from the recycling pool by reduction with MesNa. In other experiments, the biotin-removal step was not undertaken, and the levels of biotinylated α5β1 integrin were determined using a capture ELISA assay. Maxisorb 96-well plates (Invitrogen) were coated overnight with 5 μg/ml of the appropriate anti-α5 integrin Ab in 0.05 m Na2CO3 (pH 9.6) at 4 °C, and blocked in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) with 5% BSA for 1 h at RT. α5 integrin was captured by overnight incubation of 50 μl of cell lysate at 4 °C. Unbound material was removed by extensive washing with PBS-T, after which streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) in PBS-T containing 1% BSA was placed into each well; samples were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Following subsequent washing, biotinylated integrins were detected using a chromogenic reaction with ortho-phenylenediamine. Endocytic trafficking of β1 integrin from the cell surface was followed using anti-β1 integrin Ab (clone P5D2), as described previously with some modifications (25Teckchandani A. Toida N.

HUVECs were maintained at 10 °C (a temperature at which endocytosis does not occur) (26Sharma D.K. Choudhury A. Singh R.D. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Biol.

Samples were then incubated at 16 °C for 30 min, in HMEM buffer to allow the internalized Ab·β1 integrin complex to accumulate in EEs (17Manickam V. Tiwari A. Jung J.J. Bhattacharya R. Goel A. Mukhopadhyay D. Choudhury A. Blood. 2011; 117: 1425-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Subsequently, samples were moved to a cold station maintained at 10 °C, and the remaining surface-bound Ab was removed by an acid wash (three washes with ice-cold 50 mm glycine in HMEM buffer, pH 2.5, and two washes with HMEM buffers, pH 7.5). The cells were then subjected to a chase of varying length at 37 °C, in HMEM buffer. At each of several time points, the cells were moved to a 10 °C cold station and washed with acid to remove any Ab that may have recycled to the surface during the chase. The intracellular distribution of the Ab·β1 integrin complex was assessed by fixing and permeabilizing cells, and labeling them with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies and then processing them for fluorescence microscopy. Harvested cells (2 × 104) were replated in triplicates onto the upper chamber of a Transwell filter with 8-μm pores (6.5 mm, polycarbonate, Costar) coated on the lower side with 20 μg/ml of fibronectin (coating was done overnight at 4 °C in tissue culture hood), and the chamber was placed in serum-free DMEM. After 4–6 h, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Non-migrated cells on the upper side of the filter were removed with a cotton swab, and cells on the underside of the filter were stained with 2% crystal violet in 10% ethanol. After extensive washing in water to remove excess crystal violet, filters were dried overnight. The number of migrated cells was determined by eluting the crystal violet dye from the stained cells on the underside of the filter in 250 μl of 10% acetic acid (for 15 min) followed by measuring OD at 562 nm. In parallel, cells were also separately plated in triplicates to transwell filters not coated with fibronectin for estimating the total number of attached cells. Relative cell migration was determined by the number of the migrated cells normalized to the total number of the cells adhering to transwell filters. Cells were trypsinized and replated onto coverslips precoated with 20 μg/ml of either fibronectin or collagen (type I) or, laminin-1 or vitronectin at a concentration of 20,000 cells/well. The cells were allowed to spread for different times, after which they were fixed and labeled with 0.2 units/ml of Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated phalloidin and 1 mg/ml of Hoechst (Sigma) for 1 h. Cell surface boundaries were outlined for ≥100 cells (chosen randomly) for each time point, and Metamorph software was used to measure the surface area of each cell. The levels of Rac1-GTP were measured by affinity precipitation using the GST-Cdc42/Rac interactive binding domain of PAK1, as described previously (27Scita G. Nordstrom J. Carbone R. Tenca P. Giardina G. Gutkind S. Bjarnegård M. Betsholtz C. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 1999; 401: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8), 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor mixture. Lysates were incubated with 30 μg of GST-Pak1-protein binding domain protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) beads, for 1 h at 4 °C. Specifically bound GTP-Rac1 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-Rac1 antibody. All values are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined using a two-sided Student's t test, run on GraphPad Prism version 4.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA); unless stated otherwise, a value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. In a recent study we demonstrated that syntaxin 6 plays a role in regulating VEGF-induced EC migration and angiogenesis (17Manickam V. Tiwari A. Jung J.J. Bhattacharya R. Goel A. Mukhopadhyay D. Choudhury A. Blood. 2011; 117: 1425-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix is a prominent haptotactic mechanism by which cells migrate (28Davis G.E. Senger D.R. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1093-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated whether syntaxin 6-regulated trafficking events contribute to adhesion between ECs and the extracellular matrix by two methods that reduce syntaxin 6 or syntaxin 16 function in HUVECs: (i) expression of the inhibitory cytosolic domains of syntaxin 6 and syntaxin 16 (designated syntaxin 6-cyto and syntaxin 16-cyto) and (ii) application of siRNAs targeting endogenous syntaxin 6 (STX6) and STX16, as syntaxins are tail-anchored proteins with a majority of the polypeptide exposed to the cytosol. The cytosolic part of syntaxin proteins interacts with its counterpartner to form a SNARE complex. The SNARE complex subsequently facilitates the docking and fusion of the two membrane compartments by functioning as a linker. However, the mutant syntaxin, which lacks the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic region (syntaxin-cyto) essential for localization to intracellular membranes, competes with endogenous syntaxin in binding to its cognate SNARE partner. Thus, mutant syntaxin acts as a dominant-negative syntaxin (29Mallard F. Tang B.L. Galli T. Tenza D. Saint-Pol A. Yue X. Antony C. Hong W. Goud B. Johannes L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). To inhibit the syntaxin-mediated intracellular vesicular fusion process this approach has been used by several groups including our previously published studies (17Manickam V. Tiwari A. Jung J.J.

Cells were infected with syntaxin 6-cyto or syntaxin 16-cyto, this resulted in expression of the respective protein at detectable levels in ≥95% of the cells by 12 h post-infection; the cells were used in experiments at 12–24 h post-infection (Fig. 1A). In the case of siRNA application, the extent of syntaxin 6 and syntaxin 16 knockdown in cell lysates was ≥80% (Fig. 1B), and the fraction of cells in which protein levels were reduced at least 10-fold was ≥95%, as judged by immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 1C). Depletion of syntaxin 6 would inhibit cargo delivery from donor to target membrane due to lack of specific SNARE complex formation between donor and target membranes. These loss-of-function approaches, have shown similar effects in terms of syntaxin 6-mediated cargo transport between endosomes and Golgi complex (19Choudhury A. Marks D.L. Proctor K.M. Gould G.W.

The latter invades the decidualized endometrium. Glycodelin-A (GdA) is abundantly synthesized by the decidua but not the trophoblast. Previous data indicate that GdA suppresses the invasion of trophoblast cell lines by down-regulating proteinase expression and activities. This study addresses the signaling pathway involved in the above phenomenon. GdA was found to suppress phosphorylation of ERKs and expression of their downstream effector c-Jun, a component of the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1). The involvement of ERKs and c-Jun in suppressing trophoblast invasion and biosynthesis of proteinases was confirmed by using siRNA knockdown and pharmacological inhibitors. Desialylation reduced binding affinity of GdA toward and invasion suppressive activities on the trophoblast. Co-immunoprecipitation showed that Siglec-6 on the trophoblast was the binding protein of GdA. The binding of GdA to Siglec-6 was sialic acid-dependent. Treatment with anti-Siglec-6 antibody abolished the invasion suppressive activities of GdA. These results show that GdA interacts with Siglec-6 to suppress trophoblast invasiveness by down-regulating the ERK/c-Jun signaling pathway."

It mediates multiple signal transduction pathways to modulate cellular proliferation, survival, differentiation, and migration. However, the mechanisms for the regulation of its expression remain greatly elusive. We reported previously that galectin-1 is a direct target of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a key heterodimeric transcriptional factor for the cellular response to hypoxia. Here we show that CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα), a critical transcriptional factor for hematopoietic cell differentiation, can directly activate galectin-1 through binding to the −48 to −42 bp region of its promoter. Based on the physical interaction of C/EBPα and HIF-1α, the synergistic transcriptional activity of C/EBPα and HIF-1α on the promoter of the galectin-1 gene is also found by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), ChIP followed by ChIP (ChIP-reChIP), and luciferase assay. Moreover, knockdown or chemical inhibition of galectin-1 partially blocks the differentiation induced by HIF-1α or C/EBPα, which can be rescued by recombinant galectin-1.

Here we report that C/EBPα directly up-regulates the transcriptional expression of galectin-1 and presents a synergistic effect with HIF-1α for the induction of galectin-1 expression. More intriguingly, suppression of galectin-1 by shRNA or the classical galectin inhibitor lactose antagonizes HIF-1α- and C/EBPα-induced cell differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which can be restored by recombinant galectin-1. Understanding the mechanisms of the regulation of galectin-1 expression provides new insights into the roles of HIF-1α and C/EBPα in leukemic cell differentiation. Leukemic cell lines, U937, NB4, and Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640, and human embryonic kidney 293T cells and gastric cancer SGC7901 cells were cultured in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Both media were supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen). U937T cells, which were kindly provided by Daniel G. Tenen of Harvard Medical School, were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS, 1 μg/ml of tetracycline (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.5 μg/ml of puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich). U937T stable transformants with inducible HIF-1α, C/EBPα, galectin-1, and empty vector, which were designated respectively as U937THIF-1α, U937TC/EBPα, U937TGal-1, and U937TPTRE cells, were established as described previously (17Zhao M.

For the inducible expression of HIF-1α, C/EBPα, or galectin-1, these cells were cultured in tetracycline-free medium for the indicated number of days. All cell lines were cultured in 5% CO2 and 95% air in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. For hypoxic treatment, cells were cultured in a specially designed hypoxia incubator (Thermo Electron, Forma, MA) in an atmosphere that consists of 94% N2, 5% CO2, and 1% O2. Total RNA was isolated by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI). Reverse transcription was performed with the TaKaRa RNA PCR kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China), and double-stranded DNA dye SYBR Green PCR Master Mix reagent (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) was used for Q-PCR analysis as described previously (19Zhao K.W. Li X. Zhao Q. Huang Y. Li D. Peng Z.G. Shen W.Z. Zhao J. Zhou Q. Chen Z. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. Chen G.Q. Blood. 2004; 104: 3731-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).

The folds of changes were shown as mean ± S.D. in three independent experiments, each with triplicate samples. The indicated sequence (-569 bp ∼ +194 bp) in the promoter of galectin-1 was obtained from the NCBI, amplified by PCR from genomic DNA, and subcloned into the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) to construct a luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL3-Gal-1). A site-directed mutagenesis kit was used to make the point mutations of the sequence of pGL3-Gal-1 reporter plasmids according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For the luciferase assay, 293T cells were seeded in a 12-well plate (BD Biosciences) and cotransfected with pEF-BOS-HIF-1α (kind gift from Dr. K. Sogawa, Tohoku University, Japan) and/or pcDNA3.1(-)-C/EBPα, pGL3-Gal-1, and pRLSV40-Renilla. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were lysed and analyzed by the dual luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). A ChIP assay was performed according to our previous report (13Zhao X.Y. Chen T.T. Xia L. Guo M. Xu Y. Yue F. Jiang Y. Chen G.Q. Zhao K.W. Carcinogenesis. 2010; 31: 1367-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, U937 cells were grown under normoxia or hypoxia for 24 h and then cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. Then, cells were pelleted and resuspended in 400 μl of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)). Cellular DNA was sonicated and sheared to small fragments of 500–1000 bp with a Sonicator ultrasonic processor (Misonix, Farmingdale, NY). Subsequently, the supernatant of the sonicated cells was collected, diluted, and precleared by protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-human HIF-1α antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) or anti-human C/EBPα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was added to the supernatant for immunoprecipitation with normal preimmuned IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) as a normal control. After overnight incubation, the protein G-agarose for HIF-1α or protein A-agarose for C/EBPα were added and incubated for 3 h. For the ChIP-reChIP assay, the primary immunoprecipitate was eluted by elution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCL, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT) with rotation at 37 °C for 30 min, and its supernatant was immunoprecipitated with the secondary antibody. The immunoprecipitated DNA was retrieved by 5 m NaCl at 65 °C for 4 h and purified with a PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) (20Furlan-Magaril M. Rincón-Arano H. Recillas-Targa F. Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 543: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). PCR for the HIF-1α or C/EBPα binding site as well as negative control in the promoter of galectin-1 was performed with specific primers: 5′-GCATGCCCCTCATTTTGC-3′ (forward, P1) and 5′-CGGAGAAGTGCCTGGCTTT-3′ (reverse, P2) for negative control, 5′-AACTATTTTCCACTGGCTTCCC-3′ (forward, P3) and 5′-CTGAAAGTTCAGCCAATTGCA-3′ (reverse, P4) for the C/EBPα binding site, and 5′-CCCAGCCTTTCTTTAGCCTTCC-3′ (forward, P5) and 5′-GATGATGAGCTAGGCCCACAAG-3′ (reverse, P6) for the hypoxia responsive element (HRE). The target shRNA sequences for galectin-1, HIF-1α, and C/EBPα were synthesized, annealed, and ligated into pSilencer 3.1-H1-neo according to the manufacturer's instructions (Ambion, Austin, TX) as described previously (13Zhao X.Y.

Then, these targets and negative control shRNA-containing plasmids were transfected into U937T cells using the Bio-Rad Gene-Pulser II for electroporation. After 48 h, 1500 μg/ml G418 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was added to the medium to select stable transformants. Twenty micrograms of the indicated cell lysates was separated by 10 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), blocked by 5% nonfat milk in TBS, and immunoblotted with antibodies against HIF-1α, HIF-1β (BD Transduction Laboratories), galectin-1, and C/EBPα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) together with β-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich) as the internal control. Followed by incubation with HRP-linked second antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) for 1 h at room temperature, detection was performed with a SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell differentiation was evaluated by morphological feature, myeloid differentiation-related surface antigens CD11b/c, and nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction. For morphological observation, cells were collected onto slides by cytospin (Shandon, Runcorn, UK) and then stained with Wright-Giemsa staining. The morphology was examined under an Olympus BX51 microscope, and the images were photographed with a SPOT digital camera. The nuclear and cellular areas of each cell were measured by NIS-Elements software (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), and the nucleus/cytoplasm (N/C) ratio was calculated according to the formula N/C ratio = Nuclear area/(Cellular area - Nuclear area) (21Smitha T. Sharada P. Girish H. J. Oral Maxillofac. Pathol. 2011; 15: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The percentage of differentiated cells with typical morphological changes such as condensed chromatin, smaller nuclei, and more abundant cytoplasm was calculated by randomly counting 200 cells on each slide. The percentage of CD11b- and CD11c-positive cells was measured by using FITC- or phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled antibodies on a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) as in our previous report (18Song L.P. Zhang J. Wu S.F. Huang Y. Zhao Q. Cao J.P. Wu Y.L. Wang L.S. Chen G.Q. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The NBT reduction assay was performed as described previously (22Rosania G.R. Merlie Jr., J. Gray N. Chang Y.T. Schultz P.G. Heald R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 4797-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The percentage of NBT-positive cells was calculated by randomly counting 200 cells on each slide under an Olympus BX-51 light microscope. To detect the presence of the galectin-1 on the cell surface, 4 × 105 cells were collected and incubated with anti-human galectin-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h. After washing, the FITC-labeled anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was incubated for 30 min followed by detection on a flow cytometer (23Kovács-Sólyom F. Blaskó A. Fajka-Boja R. Katona R.L. Végh L. Novák J. Szebeni G.J. Krenács L. Uher F. Tubak V. Kiss R. Monostori E. Immunol. Lett. 2010; 127: 108-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Ninety-six-well microplates were incubated with 200 ng/well diluted galectin-1 capture antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) overnight at room temperature. After blocking with 1% BSA/PBS, samples for testing (100 μl) were added to the coated microplates and incubated at room temperature for 2 h and then washed three times with wash buffer (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS). Subsequently, each well was incubated with galectin-1 detection antibody (R&D Systems) and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (R&D Systems). Then the plate was developed with a tetramentylbenzidine (TMB) substrate kit (Pierce), and the optical density of each well was determined at 450 nm with an Epoch multivolume spectrophotometer system (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT). A standard curve with a gradient dose of recombinant galectin-1 protein (R&D Systems) was generated for each ELISA analysis. Human recombinant galectin-1 protein was prepared, and its CRD activity was measured according to a previous report (24Pace K.E. Hahn H.P. Baum L.G. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 363: 499-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, galectin-1 cDNA was amplified from total cDNA of U937 cells with primers 5′-ATTCCATGGCTTGTGGTCTGGTCGCC-3′ and 5′-ATTAAGCTTTCAGTCAAAGGCCACACATTTG-3′ and inserted into prokaryotic expression vector pET28a (Novagen, Madison, WI). The plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and galectin-1 protein was induced by 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich) for 6 h in 25 °C. After sonication and centrifugation, the cell supernatant was purified by α-lactose-agarose (Sigma-Aldrich), and the bound galectin-1 protein was eluted with PBS containing 200 mm lactose and 8 mm DTT. Purified galectin-1 protein was desalted with a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove lactose and DTT before application. The CRD activity of recombinant galectin-1 was determined by its ability to induce the apoptosis of Jurkat cells, which was measured with an annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit I (BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. The values were expressed as mean ± S.D. A paired t test was used for statistical analysis between two groups. The significant difference was set at p < 0.05. In the engineered U937TC/EBPα cells, as described previously (17Zhao M. Duan X.F. Zhao X.Y. Zhang B. Lu Y. Liu W. Cheng J.K. Chen G.Q. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e6552Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), C/EBPα protein was induced significantly after tetracycline withdrawal (Fig. 1A). Upon the conditional induction of C/EBPα, galectin-1 was significantly up-regulated in terms of both mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 1A, right panel). Of note, tetracycline removal did not alter the expression of galectin-1 in empty vector-transfected U937TPTRE cells (Fig. 1A, left panel). As documented (25Miller M. Shuman J.D. Sebastian T. Dauter Z. Johnson P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15178-15184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 26Smith L.T. Hohaus S. Gonzalez D.A. Dziennis S.E. Tenen D.G. Blood. 1996; 88: 1234-1247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the C/EBPα prefers to bind to the consensus sequence GCAAT in the promoters of its target genes. Bioinformatic analysis showed that there was such a potential C/EBPα binding site between −48 to −42 bp of the galectin-1 gene (Fig. 1B). Hence, we subcloned the fragment between −569 to +194 bp of the galectin-1 gene into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Basic to construct the pGL3-Gal-1 plasmid (Fig. 1B). The plasmid was cotransfected with different doses of C/EBPα-expressing plasmids as well as Renilla as a normalizing control vector into 293T cells. As depicted in Fig. 1C, C/EBPα expression increased luciferase activities driven by the galectin-1 promoter in a dose-dependent manner. Mutating −48TTGCAAT−42 to −48TTAAGGT−42 significantly reduced the promoter activity (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, anti-C/EBPα antibody but not normal IgG could precipitate the C/EBPα-binding consensus sequence between −48 to −42 bp but not that between −2021 to −2017 bp in the ChIP assay of U937 cells (Fig. 1E). All of these results suggest that galectin-1 is a direct target of C/EBPα protein. Hypoxia or treatment with hypoxia-mimetic agents, such as cobalt chloride (CoCl2) or the iron chelator desferrioxamine (DFO), can stabilize and accumulate HIF-1α protein. The stabilized HIF-1α protein translocates into nuclei where it forms a heterodimer with HIF-1β and recognizes the HREs at promoters of its target genes (12Semenza G.L. Sci. STKE. 2007; 2007: cm8Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). When HIF-1α was induced in U937THIF-1α cells after tetracycline removal as described previously (18Song L.P. Zhang J. Wu S.F. Huang Y. Zhao Q. Cao J.P. Wu Y.L. Wang L.S. Chen G.Q. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the increased galectin-1 mRNA and protein levels could be seen by Q-PCR (supplemental Fig. S1B), differential in-gel electrophoresis (supplemental Fig. S1A), and Western blot analysis (supplemental Fig. S1B). On the contrary, galectin-1 expression was inhibited in U937 cells with knockdown of HIF-1α by its specific shRNAs (named α14 and α16) under hypoxia (supplemental Fig. S2A). Moreover, the ChIP assay showed that hypoxia-stabilized HIF-1α could bind to HREs in the promoter of galectin-1 in U937 cells (supplemental Fig. S2B). These results suggest that HIF-1α directly targets the promoter of galectin-1, like that found in colorectal cancer cell lines (13Zhao X.Y. Chen T.T. Xia L. Guo M. Xu Y. Yue F. Jiang Y. Chen G.Q. Zhao K.W. Carcinogenesis. 2010; 31: 1367-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Considering that C/EBPα can interact with HIF-1α protein (27Yang L. Jiang Y. Wu S.F. Zhou M.Y. Wu Y.L. Chen G.Q. Carcinogenesis. 2008; 29: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and that galectin-1 is also a direct target of C/EBPα, we addressed the potential relationship between C/EBPα and HIF-1α on the expression of galectin-1. For this, U937THIF-1α transformants were transfected by shRNA specifically against C/EBPα (sh-C2) or a scrambled negative control (NC). The sh-C2, but not NC shRNA, significantly suppressed C/EBPα expression in U937THIF-1α cells, regardless of HIF-1α expression (Fig. 2A). The silencing of C/EBPα expression remarkably suppressed HIF-1α-induced galectin-1 expression in terms of both its mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 2A). This was the case in the U937 cells under hypoxia-induced HIF-1α protein accumulation (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, different doses of C/EBPα were cotransfected into 293T cells with pGL3-Gal-1 luciferase and the Renilla-expressing plasmid in the presence or absence of the HIF-1α-expressing plasmid. The results showed that C/EBPα could increase the galectin-1 promoter-driven luciferase activity, which could be remarkably enhanced by the ectopic expression of HIF-1α (Fig. 2C). Such a synergistic effect of C/EBPα and HIF-1α on the endogenous expression of galectin-1 could also be found in the gastric cancer cell line SGC7901 (Fig. 2D). Two HREs were also found in the promoter of the galectin-1 gene (Figs. 1B and 2E). In the ChIP-reChIP assay, both the HREs between −441 to −423 bp and the C/EBPα-binding site between −48 to −42 bp, but not −2021 to −2017 bp, in the promoter region of galectin-1 could be precipitated by anti-HIF-1α followed by anti-C/EBPα antibody or anti-C/EBPα followed by HIF-1α antibody (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, the sh-C2 partially suppressed the binding activity of HIF-1α to HREs in the galectin-1 promoter (Fig. 2F), whereas sh-α14/α16 also partially inhibited the binding of C/EBPα to the C/EBPα-binding site in the promoter of galectin-1 (Fig. 2G). Collectively, C/EBPα and HIF-1α proteins synergistically regulate galectin-1 expression. Several reports propose that hypoxia, hypoxia-mimetic agents, and conditional induction of HIF-1α can induce differentiation of AML cells through its interaction with the hematopoietic transcriptional factor C/EBPα (14Jiang Y. Xue Z.H. Shen W.Z. Du K.M. Yan H. Yu Y. Peng Z.G. Song M.G. Tong J.H. Chen Z. Huang Y. Lübbert M. Chen G.Q. Leukemia. 2005; 19: 1239-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 18Song L.P.

Pathophysiology. 2009; 16: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Hence, we addressed whether the increased galectin-1 expression was involved in the differentiation of U937 induced by HIF-1α and/or C/EBPα. For this purpose, a shRNA specifically targeting galectin-1 (sh-G8) was transfected into U937THIF-1α or U937TC/EBPα cells together with a scrambled NC shRNA plasmid as a control. We found that sh-G8 significantly suppressed endogenous or the HIF-1α- or C/EBPα-induced galectin-1 expression after tetracycline removal in U937T cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Under HIF-1α or C/EBPα induction, as reported previously (15Radomska H.S. Huettner C.S. Zhang P. Cheng T. Scadden D.T. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4301-4314Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 18Song L.P. Zhang J. Wu S.F. Huang Y. Zhao Q. Cao J.P. Wu Y.L. Wang L.S. Chen G.Q. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), U937 cells presented morphological features of differentiated myeloid cells, such as condensed chromatin, smaller nuclei, and a decreased N/C ratio, although nucleoli were visible in some cells (Figs. 3, C and D, and 4, A and B). HIF-1α or C/EBPα-induced differentiation could also be confirmed further by the increase of the percentage of cells positive for the myeloid differentiation-associated antigens CD11b/c (Fig. 3, E and F) and the expressions of M-CSFR, G-CSFR, and GM-CSFR (Fig. 3, G and H). More intriguingly, the suppression of galectin-1 expression by sh-G8 partially inhibited granulocytic differentiation under the conditional induction of HIF-1α and C/EBPα in U937THIF-1α cells (Figs. 3, C, E, and G, and 4A) and U937TC/EBPα cells (Figs. 3, D, F, and H, and 4B), respectively.FIGURE 4Morphologic evidences demonstrate the contribution of galectin-1 to HIF-1α- or C/EBPα-induced differentiation in AML cells. A and B, the NC or shRNA against galectin-1 (sh-G8) -transfected U937THIF-1α and U937TC/EBPα cells were grown for days as indicated after tetracycline removal (Tet R). C and D, U937 and NB4 cells, which stably expressed sh-G8 or NC, were grown for 6 days under CoCl2 (50 μm) or for 8 days under hypoxia (HP, 1% O2). E, U937THIF-1α and U937TC/EBPα cells were grown for 4 days and 8 days in the indicated treatments, respectively. F, U937THIF-1α-NC and -sh-G8 cells were grown for 4 days in tetracycline-free medium in the presence or absence of the recombinant galectin-1 (rGal-1, 10 μg/ml) or control buffer. All cells were stained by Wright-Giemsa staining, and morphologic images (×1000) were taken with an Olympus BX-51 light microscope. The values represent mean ± S.D. of the percentage of the nuclear differentiated cells of three independent experiments. *, p < 0.05 for comparison between NC and sh-G8 (A–D), lactose and sucrose treatment (E), and recombinant galectin-1 (rGal-1) and control buffer treatment groups (F).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also transfected NC or sh-G8 shRNAs into U937 or NB4 cell lines (named U937-NC/sh-G8 or NB4-NC/sh-G8, respectively). With CoCl2 or hypoxia treatment, the expression of galectin-1 was remarkably suppressed in U937-sh-G8 and NB4-sh-G8 cells when compared with that in U937-NC and NB4-NC cells (Fig. 5, A and B). Such inhibition also partially antagonized CoCl2- or hypoxia-induced differentiation in these two cell lines (Figs. 4, C and D, and 5, C–H). As depicted in Fig. 6, A and B, the amount of secreted galectin-1 in the culture medium together with the percentage of galectin-1-binding U937T cells significantly increased upon HIF-1α or C/EBPα induction. To address whether the secreted galectin-1 contributed to HIF-1α- or C/EBPα-induced U937 cell differentiation, the classical galectin inhibitor lactose (32Puche A.C. Key B. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 357: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) was used to compete for the CRD activity of galectin-1 on β-galactosides on the cell surface, and sucrose was used as a negative control. The results showed that lactose, but not sucrose, dramatically reduced the percentage of galectin-1-binding U937T cells (Fig. 6C), suggesting the effectiveness of lactose for the inhibition on galectin-1 binding. As expected, lactose, but not sucrose, also partially inhibited the differentiation of U937T cells induced by HIF-1α or C/EBPα after tetracycline removal (Figs. 4E and 6, D and E). The recombinant galectin-1 protein was expressed and purified in a prokaryotic system (supplemental Fig. S3A). The recombinant protein was active because it was capable of inducing apoptosis of Jurkat T cells (supplemental Fig. S3, B and C) (5He J. Baum L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4705-4712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 33Brandt B. Büchse T. Abou-Eladab E.F. Tiedge M. Krause E. Jeschke U. Walzel H. Histochem.

Histochem Cell Biol. 2009; 132: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Using the solvent of galectin-1 protein as a control buffer, the recombinant galectin-1 was added into the culture medium of U937THIF-1α-sh-G8 cells after HIF-1α induction by tetracycline removal. Compared with the solvent treatment, recombinant galectin-1 protein could remarkably rescue sh-G8-inhibited differentiation under HIF-1α induction in U937THIF-1α cells (Figs. 4F and 7). To further determine whether galectin-1 was sufficient for myeloid differentiation, we established a U937TGal-1 cell line. As depicted in supplemental Fig. S4A, galectin-1 protein was significantly induced after tetracycline removal in this cell line. According to the N/C ratio (supplemental Fig. S4B), the percentage of morphologically differentiated cells (supplemental Fig. S4C) and the percentage of CD11b/c-positive cells (supplemental Fig. S4D), the inducible expression of galectin-1 only induced U937T cells to undergo a lower degree of differentiation. In addition, recombinant galectin-1 treatment only triggered U937 cells to present incomplete differentiation-related morphological features (supplemental Fig. S4, E and F) but did not change the percentage of CD11b/c-positive cells (supplemental Fig. S4G). Here we provide the first demonstration that C/EBPα binds to the −48TTGCAAT−42 region of the promoter of the galectin-1 gene and induces its expression. On the basis of the fact that C/EBPα interacts with HIF-1α and its transcriptional activity is enhanced (14Jiang Y. Xue Z.H. Shen W.Z. Du K.M. Yan H. Yu Y. Peng Z.G. Song M.G. Tong J.H. Chen Z. Huang Y. Lübbert M. Chen G.Q. Leukemia. 2005; 19: 1239-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and that galectin-1 is also a direct target of these two transcriptional factors, it would be rational to ask whether C/EBPα and HIF-1α could comodulate galectin-1 expression. Our results revealed that C/EBPα and HIF-1α synergistically regulated galectin-1 expression because the silencing of C/EBPα expression by its specific shRNA could remarkably suppress HIF-1α- or hypoxia-induced expression of galectin-1, whereas ectopic expression of HIF-1α remarkably enhanced C/EBPα-increased activity of the galectin-1 promoter. Such a synergistic effect of C/EBPα and HIF-1α on the endogenous expression of galectin-1 could also be found in the gastric cancer cell line SGC7901. More intriguingly, the ChIP-reChIP assay showed that C/EBPα and HIF-1α could both bind to the promoter of the galectin-1 gene, in which both HREs- and C/EBPα-binding sites were present. Furthermore, the silencing of C/EBPα and HIF-1α expressions by their cognate shRNAs partially suppressed the binding activity of HIF-1α to HREs and C/EBPα to its consensus sequence in the galectin-1 promoter, respectively. Recently, Takubo et al. (35Takubo K. Goda N. Yamada W. Iriuchishima H. Ikeda E. Kubota Y. Shima H. Johnson R.S. Hirao A. Suematsu M. Suda T. Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) reported that normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) maintain intracellular hypoxia and stabilize HIF-1α protein and that HSCs maintain cell cycle quiescence through the precise regulation of the HIF-1α level. It was also shown that HIF-1α plays a role in myeloid leukemic cell differentiation induced by hypoxia (14Jiang Y. Xue Z.H. Shen W.Z. Du K.M. Yan H. Yu Y. Peng Z.G. Song M.G. Tong J.H. Chen Z.

Song L.P. Huang Y. Zhao Q. Zhao K.W. Chen G.Q. Haematologica. 2008; 93: 1480-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). On the other hand, C/EBPα contributes to the granulocytic differentiation of hematopoietic cells, and its abnormality is related to the pathogenesis of many kinds of AML (39Preudhomme C. Sagot C. Boissel N. Cayuela J.M. Tigaud I. de Botton S. Thomas X. Raffoux E. Lamandin C. Castaigne S. Fenaux P. Dombret H. Blood. 2002; 100: 2717-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 40Leroy H. Roumier C. Huyghe P. Biggio V. Fenaux P. Preudhomme C. Leukemia. 2005; 19: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, we addressed whether increased galectin-1 expression contributed to HIF-1α- and/or C/EBPα-mediated AML cell differentiation. Our results showed that the silencing of galectin-1 expression by shRNA blocked HIF-1α or C/EBPα-induced differentiation of U937T cells as well as U937 and NB4 cells treated with CoCl2 or hypoxia. These results collectively suggested a role of galectin-1 in HIF-1α- or C/EBPα-induced leukemic cell differentiation. Furthermore, galectin-1, which was modulated by HIF-1α or C/EBPα after tetracycline removal in U937THIF-1α or U937TC/EBPα cells, also externalized and, subsequently, bound to the cell surface in an autocrine-like manner. Moreover, inhibition of galectin-1 CRD activity by lactose reduced the HIF-1α- or C/EBPα-induced galectin-1-mediated differentiation, suggesting that CRD activity of galectin-1 was crucial in mediating U937T cell differentiation. Notably, although all of the expression of the differentiation-associated genes, M-CSFR, G-CSFR, and GM-CSFR, could be induced after tetracycline removal in U937THIF-1α or U937TC/EBPα cells, only the expression of M-CSFR and GM-CSFR could be inhibited, whereas the expression of G-CSFR could be activated by lactose treatment. One probable explanation was that the galectin family proteins such as galectin-4 and galectin-8 play opposite roles to galectin-1 (41Hittelet A. Legendre H. Nagy N. Bronckart Y. Pector J.C.

Rao U.S. Int. J. Cancer. 2011; 129: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) so that in this case, the expression of G-CSFR might be more potently regulated by the other members of the galectin family via a different pathway. Even though lactose treatment might inhibit galectin-1-induced G-CSFR expression, as a common inhibitor of the galectin family, lactose might recover the G-CSFR expression inhibited by the other galectins, and the final result might be the activation of G-CSFR. Interestingly, the contradictory effect of lactose on G-CSFR expression did not affect the inhibitory effect of lactose on HIF-1α- or C/EBPα-induced differentiation of U937THIF-1α or U937TC/EBPα cells. Moreover, an active recombinant galectin-1 could restore HIF-1α-induced differentiation of U937THIF-1α cells under the suppression of galectin-1 by its shRNA. However, the inducible expression of galectin-1 or recombinant galectin-1 treatment alone was not sufficient for the myeloid differentiation. Taken together, galectin-1 is synergistically induced by C/EBPα and HIF-1α and contributes to HIF-1α-induced and C/EBPα-dependent differentiation, although these findings remain to be further investigated in the primary cells and in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2129032853,"Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a systemic disorder of the connective tissues caused by insufficient fibrillin-1 microfibril formation and can cause cardiac complications, emphysema, ocular lens dislocation, and severe periodontal disease. ADAMTSL6β (A disintegrin-like metalloprotease domain with thrombospondin type I motifs-like 6β) is a microfibril-associated extracellular matrix protein expressed in various connective tissues that has been implicated in fibrillin-1 microfibril assembly. We here report that ADAMTSL6β plays an essential role in the development and regeneration of connective tissues. ADAMTSL6β expression rescues microfibril disorder after periodontal ligament injury in an MFS mouse model through the promotion of fibrillin-1 microfibril assembly. In addition, improved fibrillin-1 assembly in MFS mice following the administration of ADAMTSL6β attenuates the overactivation of TGF-β signals associated with the increased release of active TGF-β from disrupted fibrillin-1 microfibrils within periodontal ligaments. Our current data thus demonstrate the essential contribution of ADAMTSL6β to fibrillin-1 microfibril formation. These findings also suggest a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of MFS through ADAMTSL6β-mediated fibrillin-1 microfibril assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2044599046,"During orthodontic tooth movement, the application of adequate orthodontic forces allows teeth to be moved through the alveolar bone. These forces are transmitted through the periodontal ligaments (PDL) to the supporting alveolar bone and lead to deposition or resorption of bone, depending on whether the tissues are exposed to a tensile or compressive mechanical strain. Fibroblasts within the PDL (PDLF) are considered to be mechanoresponsive. The transduction mechanisms from mechanical loading of the PDLF to the initiation of bone remodeling are not clearly understood. Recently, members of the ephrin/Eph family have been shown to be involved in the regulation of bone homeostasis. For the first time, we demonstrate that PDLF exposed to tensile strain induce the expression of ephrin-B2 via a FAK-, Ras-, ERK1/2-, and SP1-dependent pathway. Osteoblasts of the alveolar bone stimulated with ephrin-B2 increased their osteoblastogenic gene expression and showed functional signs of osteoblastic differentiation. In a physiological setting, ephrin-B2-EphB4 signaling between PDLF and osteoblasts of the alveolar bone might contribute to osteogenesis at tension sites during orthodontic tooth movement. During orthodontic tooth movement, the application of adequate orthodontic forces allows teeth to be moved through the alveolar bone. These forces are transmitted through the periodontal ligaments (PDL) to the supporting alveolar bone and lead to deposition or resorption of bone, depending on whether the tissues are exposed to a tensile or compressive mechanical strain. Fibroblasts within the PDL (PDLF) are considered to be mechanoresponsive. The transduction mechanisms from mechanical loading of the PDLF to the initiation of bone remodeling are not clearly understood. Recently, members of the ephrin/Eph family have been shown to be involved in the regulation of bone homeostasis. For the first time, we demonstrate that PDLF exposed to tensile strain induce the expression of ephrin-B2 via a FAK-, Ras-, ERK1/2-, and SP1-dependent pathway. Osteoblasts of the alveolar bone stimulated with ephrin-B2 increased their osteoblastogenic gene expression and showed functional signs of osteoblastic differentiation. In a physiological setting, ephrin-B2-EphB4 signaling between PDLF and osteoblasts of the alveolar bone might contribute to osteogenesis at tension sites during orthodontic tooth movement. Teeth are moved through alveolar bone during orthodontic tooth movement by the application of adequate orthodontic forces. The applied mechanical stress must then be communicated to the alveolar bone via the periodontal ligaments (PDL). 2The abbreviations used are: PDLperiodontal ligamentPDLFperiodontal ligament fibroblastsALPLliver/bone/kidney-type alkaline phosphataseFAfocal adhesionFAfocal adhesionFAKfocal adhesion kinasefwforward primerGPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolp-FAKphosphorylated focal adhesion kinaseqRT-PCRquantitative real time PCRrvreverse primert-FAKtotal focal adhesion kinaseECMextracellular matrix. Mechanosensitive cells of the PDL, the PDL fibroblasts (PDLF), are able to transduce mechanical strain into intracellular signals. This information is then transmitted to other cells like osteoblasts of the alveolar bone. This initiates fundamental processes leading to a profound remodeling of mineralized and nonmineralized periodontal tissues. The sequence of events from the application of mechanical forces to the complex biochemical events commanding the tightly controlled accomplishment of osteogenesis at tension sides and osteoclastogenesis at compressive sides is not completely understood. periodontal ligament periodontal ligament fibroblasts liver/bone/kidney-type alkaline phosphatase focal adhesion focal adhesion focal adhesion kinase forward primer glycosylphosphatidylinositol phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase quantitative real time PCR reverse primer total focal adhesion kinase extracellular matrix. Some effectors of physiological bone remodeling have been identified and characterized. Of paramount importance for bone remodeling is the receptor activator of nuclear factor κB/receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand/osteoprotegerin signaling pathway (1Teitelbaum S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (3104) Google Scholar, 2Boyce B.F. Xing L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 473: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). For the differentiation and function of osteoblasts, a member of the Runx (Runt-related protein) family of transcription factors, Runx2, is of leading importance. Runx2 binds to the promoter regions of osteoblastic genes and activates, among others, the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALPL), osteocalcin, bone sialoprotein (BSP-1), and collagen 1A1 (COL1A1), which include hallmarks of osteoblast differentiation. Ephrins and Ephs are involved in various developmental processes during embryogenesis (3Holder N. Durbin L. Cooke J. Ernst Schering Res. Found. Workshop. 2000; 29: 123-147Google Scholar, 4Adams R.H. Klein R. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and have been characterized for their roles in neuronal development, during which they mediate patterning of hindbrain rhombomeres, guidance of migrating neural precursor cell axon guidance (5Wilkinson D.G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 6Kullander K. Klein R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar), and physiological and pathological angiogenesis (7Pasquale E.B.

Vajkoczy P. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 628-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The Eph receptors include the largest known group of receptor tyrosine kinases. Although they share a conserved domain structure, sequence homology analysis and binding preferences served as criteria for subdividing the 14 mammalian Ephs into two groups: 8 EphA- (EphA1–8) and 6 EphB receptors (EphB1–6). The EphA receptors bind preferentially to the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked ephrin-A ligands (ephrins A1–5), althoughthe EphB receptors bind the transmembrane ephrin-B ligands (ephrins B1–3). Ephs, like other receptor tyrosine kinases, initiate signal transduction through autophosphorylation after ligand-receptor engagement, referred to as “forward signaling.” However, in contrast to other soluble ligands for receptor tyrosine kinases, the ephrins possess a unique feature as follows. Ephrins are membrane-bound and capable of receptor-like active signaling (“reverse signaling”), resulting in bi-directional cell-to-cell communication (reviewed in Refs. 6Kullander K. Klein R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 9Himanen J.P. Nikolov D.B. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 46-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Major functions of the ephrin/Eph system are within the regulation of cellular motility and alteration in adhesions to the extracellular matrix. Ephrin/Eph interactions frequently modulate cellular repulsion or attraction, indicating a causal relation between ephrins, Ephs, the ECM, and the cytoskeleton. However, the strain that alters the interaction of cells with the ECM and/or influences the organization of the cytoskeleton has an impact on the function and expression of members of the ephrin/Eph family (10Korff T. Braun J. Pfaff D. Augustin H.G. Hecker M. Blood. 2008; 112: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 11Obi S. Yamamoto K. Shimizu N. Kumagaya S. Masumura T. Sokabe T. Asahara T. Ando J. J. Appl. Physiol. 2009; 106: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Recently members of the ephrin/Eph family have been shown to be involved in the regulation of bone homeostasis. Zhao et al. (12Zhao C. Irie N. Takada Y. Shimoda K. Miyamoto T. Nishiwaki T. Suda T. Matsuo K. Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 111-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) reported an NFATc1-dependent ephrin-B2 expression during the receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand-induced differentiation of osteoclasts. Moreover, Zhao et al. (12Zhao C. Irie N. Takada Y. Shimoda K. Miyamoto T. Nishiwaki T. Suda T. Matsuo K. Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 111-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) could show that osteoblasts expressed the EphB4 receptor, and the bi-directional activation of the ephrin-B2-EphB4 signaling pathway on osteoclasts and osteoblasts led to the suppression of osteoclast differentiation with a concurrent stimulation of osteoblastogenesis and in consequence to bone formation (12Zhao C. Irie N. Takada Y. Shimoda K. Miyamoto T. Nishiwaki T. Suda T. Matsuo K. Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 111-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 13Mundy G.R. Elefteriou F. Cell. 2006; 126: 441-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The mechanism for osteogenesis at tension sites in tooth movement is not well understood. Mechanical forces during orthodontic tooth movement are initially transmitted to the PDL. Fibroblasts within the PDL are the first cellular recipients of mechanical strain. Under cyclic strain, PDL fibroblasts in vitro increased their osteogenic gene expression (14Wescott D.C. Pinkerton M.N. Gaffey B.J. Beggs K.T. Milne T.J. Meikle M.C. J. Dent. Res. 2007; 86: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). An in vivo model of tooth movement indicated enhanced expression of Runx2 and the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (pERK1/2) under tension (15Kawarizadeh A. Bourauel C. Götz W. Jäger A. J. Dent. Res. 2005; 84: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Based on their involvement in bone remodeling, their causal relation between ECM and the cytoskeleton, and also their modulation by mechanical stress, it is tempting to speculate that ephrins and Ephs are modulated by cellular strain in PDLF and/or osteoblasts of the alveolar bone. The anatomical localization of PDLF in proximity to osteoblasts of the alveolar bone would allow cell to cell signaling via ephrin/Eph interactions and might contribute to cellular responses leading to osteogenesis at sites of cellular strain. Besides the interplay between PDL fibroblasts and osteoblasts of the alveolar bone via ephrin/Eph interactions, bi-directional signaling between ephrins and Ephs may also occur within PDLF and osteoblast populations themselves. The communication between ephrin-B2 and EphB4 has recently been shown to be involved in the initiation of osteoblast differentiation within the osteoblast lineage (16Martin T.J. Allan E.H. Ho P.W. Gooi J.H. Quinn J.M. Gillespie M.T. Krasnoperov V. Sims N.A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2010; 658: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We recently showed at compression sites during orthodontic tooth movement that ephrin-A2 is up-regulated in PDLF and that this up-regulation leads to an attenuated osteogenesis in the alveolar bone (17Diercke K. Sen S. Kohl A. Lux C.J. Erber R. J. Dent. Res. 2011; 90: 1108-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence that ephrin-B2-EphB4 signaling links mechanical strain on PDLF with osteoblastic gene expression in osteoblasts of the alveolar bone. We also investigated the molecular mechanism by which mechanical strain regulates ephrin-B2 gene expression in PDLF. In vitro, ephrin-B2 stimulated osteoblastogenic gene expression, ALP activity, and mineralization in osteoblasts, suggesting that strain-induced ephrin-B2 up-regulation in PDLF contributes to osteogenesis at tension sites of orthodontic tooth movement. Moreover, we have shown that ephrin-B2-EphB4 signaling in PDLF led to the induction of osteoblastogenic gene expression, indicating a dual role for ephrin-B2-EphB4 signaling in osteogenesis at tension sites by stimulating the osteoblastic differentiation of osteoblasts and PDL fibroblasts. Together, these findings establish a role for this ligand/receptor system in osteogenesis during orthodontic tooth movement. Primary PDLF were obtained from juvenile patients (12–20 years) following premolar extraction during orthodontic treatment. Alveolar bone tissue was obtained from patients following osteotomy of third molars. The Ethics Committee (Medical Faculty, University of Heidelberg; Vote S147/2010) has approved the harvest of the tissues, and informed consent was obtained from the patients following explanation of the study. Small tissue fragments were established as explant cultures in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics (penicillin, 100 units/ml, streptomycin 100 μg/ml, kanamycin 50 mg/ml) and antimycotics (amphotericin, 2.5 μg/ml). After reaching 80% confluence, primary PDLF and osteoblasts were used for the experiments. Primary cells were used between passages 3 and 9. Mechanical strain was carried out according to the method described by Hasegawa et al. (18Hasegawa S. Sato S. Saito S. Suzuki Y. Brunette D.M. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1985; 37: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3.5 × 103/cm2 PDLF or osteoblast cells were seeded on flexible bottomed dishes (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany), coated with 20 μg/ml collagen type-I (IBM, Leipzig, Germany) and 10 μg/ml fibronectin (Biomol, Hamburg, Germany), and grown until 80% confluence. The bottom of each dish was strained by induction of a continuous average strain of 2.5% for 2 min to 72 h. The exact durations are given in the figures, representing the individual experiments. To test for putative functional consequences of ephrin-B2-dependent EphB4 receptor stimulations, we have used ephrin-B2-Fc chimeras (recombinant ephrin-B2 fused with Fc; R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany). For appropriate signaling, soluble ephrin ligands require preclustering with anti-Fc antibodies (19Egea J. Klein R. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 230-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Ephrin-B2-Fc was preclustered with anti-human IgG-Fc (1:10 stoichiometry) in cell medium for 30 min at room temperature. Anti-human IgG-Fc alone in cell medium served as a control. U0126 (Merck), a selective inhibitor of MEK1/2, was used to block the MAPK/ERK cascade pathway. Cells were incubated with the concentrations of UO126 indicated in the experiments or with the appropriate amount of DMSO. Validated siRNAs (FlexiTube Gene Solution) designed to knock down the endogenous expression of FAK and EphB4 and scrambled siRNA as a negative control were purchased from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). Transfections of siRNA to PDLF or osteoblasts were carried out with HiPerfect reagent (Qiagen). Transfections were performed on 4 × 105 cells with 500 ng of each siRNA and 20 μl of HiPerfect reagent in 60-mm dishes. At 12 h post-transfection, cells were subjected to cellular strain. Knockdown of the mRNA for FAK and EphB4 was monitored using qRT-PCR and for FAK additionally using Western blotting. Ras activity (GTP-Ras) was evaluated using a commercially available Ras activation assay (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was used to evaluate the expression of ephrin-A1, ephrin-A2, ephrin-B1, ephrin-B2, ephrin-B3, EphA2, EphA5, EphB2, EphB3, and EphB4 mRNA. Total RNA was isolated from PDLF and osteoblasts using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen; Hilden, Germany) and subjected to reverse transcription using poly(dT) primers. Single-stranded cDNA was used for PCR amplification, according to standard protocols (for annealing temperatures and MgCl2 concentrations, see the primer list) to detect the expression of receptors and ligands. PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. The RT-PCR experiments were performed in triplicate. The primer sequences were as follows: ephrin-A1 (human ephrin-A1), fw, CTG GCCAGG CCC CGC GCT AT, and rv, CAA CCT CAA GCA GCG GTC TT, 55 °C, 1.5 mm; ephrin-A2 (human ephrin-A2), fw, TGC GAC TGA AGG TGT ACG TG, and rv, CGG GCT GCT ACA CGA GTT AT, 55 °C, 1.5 mm; ephrin-B1 (human ephrin-B1), fw, CAG AGC AGG AAA TAC GCT TT, and rv, CAC CGA CAG CCG CGA ACA AT, 55 °C, 1.5 mm; ephrin-B2 (human ephrin-B2), fw, TCC CAA TGC TCA GCG CTT AA, and rv, TAC TTC CTA GTC TAC GGT TC, 55 °C, 1.5 mm; ephrin-B3 (human ephrin-B3), fw, CCG CTC GCA CCA CGA TTA CT, and rv, GCC CGC CGT CTC CGC CAA CA, 55 °C, 1.5 mm; EphA2 (human EphA2), fw, GGG GTG AAG AGC CCC GTA TG, and rv, GTGTGC AAG GCA TCG ACG CT, 55 °C, 1.5 mm; EphA5 (human EphA5), fw, GTA GAG GAA GGC TAT CGT CT, and rv, GAA AAT CTC TGT ATA CCG GC, 55 °C, 2.0 mm; EphB2 (human EphB2), fw, GCC ATT GAG CAG GAC TAT CG, and rv, GAT CAT CTT GTC TAG CGT GT, 66 °C, 1.5 mm; Eph3 (human EphB3), fw, CTC TGC CGC CTC GTT ATG CG, and rv, GCT TCC TGA GGC AGA CGA TA, 55 °C, 1.5 mm; EphB4 (human EphB4), fw, CCT TCC TGC GGC TAA ACG AC, and rv, GTT GAC TAG GAT GTT GCG AG, 66 °C, 1.5 mm. Total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen; Hilden, Germany). RNA integrity was monitored by capillary electrophoresis (Experion System, Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription using poly(dT) primers. Single-stranded cDNA was used for qRT-PCR analyses. qRT-PCR was done using the TaqMan chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt Germany) or the SYBR Green chemistry (Bio-Rad) on an iCycler Instrument (Bio-Rad). To ensure equal amplification efficiencies, we used predesigned TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems) for quantitative detection of EphB4, ephrin-B2, GAPDH, and TATA box-binding protein or RT2 qRT-PCR primer assays (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for ALP, Runx2, and GAPDH. For the quantitative detection of FAK and GAPDH, Quantitect primer assays (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) were used. The assay IDs (TaqMan) were as follows: ephrin-B1, Hs00270004_m1; ephrin-B2, Hs00187950_m1; ephrin-B3, Hs00154861_m1; ephrin-A1, Hs00358886_m1; ephrin-A2, Hs01023290_m1; EphB2, Hs01031827_m1; EphB3, Hs00177903_m1; EphB4, Hs00174752_m1; EphA2, Hs00171656_m1; EphA5, Hs00300724_m1; and GAPDH, Hs03929097_g1 together with TATA box-binding protein, Hs00300806_m1, as the reference/housekeeping gene. The following RT2 qRT-PCR primer assays were used: Runx2, PPH01897B; ALP, PPH01311E, and GAPDH, PPH00150E. The following Quantitect primer assay was used: FAK, QT00057687; GAPDH, QT01192646. The amplification efficiencies were evaluated and found to be comparable and reproducible. Therefore, in stretch and ephrin-B2 stimulation experiments, the relative gene expression, compared with untreated control cells, was determined using the ΔΔCT method. To determine the ephrin-Eph expression in different PDLF and osteoblast populations, the expression was determined using the Qgene software (20Muller P.Y. Janovjak H. Miserez A.R. Dobbie Z. BioTechniques. 2002; 32 (1376, 1378–1379): 1372-1374PubMed Google Scholar). After strain application, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, fixed for 5 min with methanol/acetone (1:1, −20 °C), and air-dried. For immunostaining, membranes of the flexible bottomed dishes were cut in parts. Incubation with primary antibodies (anti-FAK, 1:50, Abcam, Cambridge, UK; anti-p-FAK (Tyr576), 1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany; anti-α-actinin, 1:200, Sigma) was performed overnight at 4 °C. After washing, membranes were incubated with the appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were mounted in Mowiol with DAPI as a counterstain. Microphotographs were taken using a Leica DMRE microscope equipped with a digital camera (DFC300 FX, Leica, Bensheim, Germany). Image acquisition and processing were done using the Leica application suite software (Leica, Bensheim, Germany). Cell lysates (50 μg/ml) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with EphB4-Fc (5 μg/ml). 50 μl of immobilized protein A (Trisacryl GF-2000, Pierce) were added and incubated 2 h at room temperature. Precipitates were washed, lysed, and run on 4–12% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen). Western-blotted gels were processed as described below. Protein lysates were obtained by lysis with ice-cold RIPA buffer, supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). 25 μg of proteins were separated on 4–12% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen). The separated proteins were transferred onto PVDF membranes (Invitrogen). Membranes were probed with antibodies against EphB4 (1 μg/ml, H-200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phosphotyrosine (1:2000; Cell Signaling/New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany), FAK (1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), phospho-specific FAK (Tyr576) (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) (1:2000 and 1:1000, both Cell Signaling/New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany). The Western Breeze Chromogenic Immunodetection System (Invitrogen) was used for visualization. Blots were scanned, and densitometric analysis was performed (where appropriate) using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). After cross-linking the cells with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min, cells were harvested, centrifuged, and resuspended in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.1) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) and then sonicated (four times for 10 s). Supernatants were diluted 1:10 in dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 167 mm NaCl, 16.7 mm Tris, pH 8.1) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture. 20 μl of each sample was reserved as a positive control (“input”). Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight with a specific antibody against Sp1 (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany) at 4 °C. Then protein A-agarose/salmon sperm DNA (50% slurry) was added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed sequentially with the following buffers: low salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris, pH 8.1), high salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris, pH 8.1), and LiCl wash buffer (0.25 mm LiCl, 1% IGEPAL-CA630, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris, pH 8.1). Bead precipitates were washed twice with Tris-EDTA buffer (1 mm EDTA and 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0) and eluted with 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3. Eluates were heated for 4 h at 65 °C to reverse the formaldehyde cross-linking. Supernatants were incubated for 1 h at 45 °C with 20 μg/ml proteinase K, and genomic DNA fragments were recovered. PCR was performed with the primers amplifying the part of the ephrin-B2 promoter containing the Sp1-binding site, 5′-ACCCAATGTCGGGAGGGGATG-3′ and 5′-AGCGAGGAGCTGCGCACGCAG-3′ (11Obi S. Yamamoto K. Shimizu N. Kumagaya S. Masumura T. Sokabe T. Asahara T. Ando J. J. Appl. Physiol. 2009; 106: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (0.2% Triton X-100). Lysates were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (alkaline phosphatase substrate, Sigma) in reaction buffer (0.15 m Tris, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 8.5). The reactions were stopped by adding 1 n NaOH. Absorbance at 405 nm was read using a multiwell spectrophotometer (Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany). ALP activity was normalized to the total protein concentration. Cells were fixed with neutral buffered formalin and stained with 2% Alizarin Red, pH 4.3, for 5 min. Cells were rinsed with distilled water and mounted with glycerol gelatin. Results are presented as means ± S.D. Differences between groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance followed by the appropriate post-hoc test. All statistics were performed using SigmaStat software (SPSS Inc., Chicago). Results were considered significant with a p value < 0.05. To study the relevance of ephrins and Ephs in the context of bone remodeling during orthodontic tooth movement, we started our examinations with an expression analysis of ephrin and Eph mRNAs in human primary periodontal cells. PDLF and osteoblasts of the alveolar bone were tested by standard RT-PCR for the presence of five ephrin ligands (ephrin-B1, ephrin-B2, ephrin-B3, ephrin-A1, and ephrin-A2) and five Eph receptors (EphB2, EphB3, EphB4, EphA2, and EphA5) (Fig. 1A). In PDLF and osteoblasts, we detected the mRNA expression of ephrin-B1, ephrin-B2, and ephrin-B3. We could not detect the expression of mRNAs for ephrin-A1 and ephrin-A2. Of the Eph receptors analyzed, EphB2, EphB3, EphB4, EphA5, and EphA2 were detected in osteoblasts of the alveolar bone and in PDLF (Fig. 1A). To gain a more detailed insight into the expression profiles of selected ephrins and Ephs in PDLF and osteoblasts, we have conducted a qPCR analysis using TaqMan chemistry on the three individual PDLF and osteoblast cell lines used in this study. The results are summarized in Fig. 1B for PDLF and Fig. 1C for osteoblasts. The quantitative analysis revealed a specific expression profile of ephrins and Ephs in PDLF and osteoblasts. Both cell types were characterized by high level expressions of ephrin-B1 and EphB2. PDLF displayed higher expressions of ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3, as compared with osteoblasts. The expression of EphB3 was low in both cell types. EphB4, EphA2, and, unlike the results obtained by standard RT-PCR, EphA5 were present in both PDLF and osteoblasts. We have only detected minimal amounts of ephrin-A2 and ephrin-A5 by means of TaqMan qRT-PCR. We have found ephrin-B2 expression in PDLF, which has previously not been reported. A possible function has not been investigated yet. We have found ephrin-B2 in osteoblasts; this is line with previous findings (12Zhao C. Irie N. Takada Y. Shimoda K. Miyamoto T. Nishiwaki T. Suda T. Matsuo K. Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 111-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). The prominent expression of ephrin-B1, which we observed, is in line with its known function during embryonic cell differentiation and bone formation as mutations of ephrin-B1 in humans result in craniofrontonasal syndrome. Mechanical forces applied to the PDLF regulate cellular events via interactions between the ECM and integrin receptors that are located at focal adhesions (FA). A major component of FA is the nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase FAK. FAK plays a pivotal role in signaling pathways initiated by integrins. α-Actinin facilitates FA formation and physically links integrin-associated FA complexes with the cytoskeleton (21Rajfur Z. Roy P. Otey C. Romer L. Jacobson K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 286-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). PDLF were subjected to mechanical strain and immunostainings for FAK, and p-FAK and α-actinin were performed to elucidate a possible involvement in mechanotransduction in PDLF. Mechanical loading caused changes in the cellular distribution of FAK and α-actinin in PDLF (Fig. 2). The application of tensile stress induced lamellipodial protrusions at the cell periphery within 15 min without a preferential direction. By 1 h, FAK was recruited to FAs under the lamellipodial protrusion (arrowheads in Fig. 2, C–F; 1–72 h). In static control cells, α-actinin was primarily localized to regions near the end of actin bundles (Fig. 2A). After exposure to cellular strain, stress fibers formed, and α-actinin was more evenly distributed throughout the cells and along the stress fibers (Fig. 2, A–F). We have used a phospho-FAK-specific antibody to localize tyrosine-phosphorylated FAK (Tyr576) during the application of cellular strain. Static control cells and cells stretched for 15 min showed mainly perinuclear staining for p-FAK. During the course of cellular strain, we observed an increase in p-FAK staining in the cellular periphery (e.g. lamellipodia), suggesting a redistribution of phosphorylated/activated FAK. The expression and activation of FAK were further analyzed using Western blotting with antibodies specific for FAK (total-FAK, t-FAK) and for the Tyr576-phosphorylated and -activated state of FAK (p-FAK) (Fig. 3A). The expression of t-FAK and p-FAK was normalized for β-actin. Densitometric analysis of t-FAK intensities did not reveal a significant impact on the expression of t-FAK (data not shown). Tyr576-phosphorylated FAK, indicating FAK activity, was slightly elevated after 15 min increasing to 18.3% after 30 min. Interestingly, phosphorylation was sustained between 24 and 72 h, peaking at 44.7% elevation (24 h), as compared with static control cells. Nevertheless, FAK phosphorylation did not reach significance during the course of the experiment. These findings suggested a slight but sustained FAK activation throughout the application of mechanical strain in PDLF.

Downstream signaling events emerged by FAK activation are directly associated with members of the Rho small GTPase family, including RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac (23Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E.

https://openalex.org/W2080525960,"Acidocalcisomes are acidic calcium and polyphosphate storage organelles found in a diverse range of organisms. Here we present evidence that the biogenesis of acidocalcisomes in Trypanosoma brucei is linked to the expression of adaptor protein-3 (AP-3) complex. Localization studies in cell lines expressing β3 and δ subunits of AP-3 fused to epitope tags revealed their partial co-localization with the vacuolar proton pyrophosphatase, a marker of acidocalcisomes, with the Golgi marker Golgi reassembly and stacking protein, and with antibodies against the small GTPase Rab11. Ablation of the β3 subunit by RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in disappearance of acidocalcisomes from both procyclic and bloodstream form trypanosomes, as revealed by immmunofluorescence and electron microscopy assays, with no alterations in trafficking of different markers to lysosomes. Knockdown of the β3 subunit resulted in lower acidic calcium, pyrophosphate, and polyphosphate content as well as defects in growth in culture, resistance to osmotic stress, and virulence in mice. Similar results were obtained by knocking down the expression of the δ subunit of AP-3. These results indicate that AP-3 is essential for the biogenesis of acidocalcisomes and for growth and virulence of T. brucei."

A dominant negative form of NFAT rescued the inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway triggered by the Ca2+ signal. NFAT functioned downstream of β-catenin without interfering with its stability, but influencing the interaction of β-catenin with Dvl by its competitively binding to Dvl. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NFAT is a regulator in the proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells by modulating canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in the neural tube of chick embryo.

Proteins of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family are Ca2+-regulated transcription factors, which were initially identified in the immune system but now are known to have integral function in multiple signaling pathways (12Rao A.

Five members of this family, including NFATc1/2/c, NFATc2/1/p, NFATc3/4/x, NFATc4/3, and NFAT5/TonEBP, have been identified in mammals. All members of the NFAT family have highly conserved DNA-binding domain, the Rel homology region (RHR), which confers common DNA-binding specificity (17Jain J. Burgeon E. Badalian T.M. Hogan P.G. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4138-4145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Except for NFAT5, NFATc1–c4 are activated upon a rise in intracellular Ca2+, which stimulates the serine/threonine phosphatase activity of calcineurin (18Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R.

Nature. 1993; 365: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Calcineurin directly dephosphorylates NFAT resulting in the nuclear import of NFAT. In the nucleus, NFAT transcription complexes reassemble on DNA to initiate gene transcription (19Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Miner Z. Kerppola T.K. Lambert J.N. Verdine G.L. Curran T. Rao A.

A study of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) suggested that NFATc2 represses CDK4 expression (20Baksh S. Widlund H.R. Frazer-Abel A.A. Du J. Fosmire S. Fisher D.E. DeCaprio J.A. Modiano J.F.

NFATc1 also induces transcriptional repression by interacting with histone deacetylases after sumoylation modification (21Terui Y. Saad N. Jia S. McKeon F. Yuan J. J. Biol.

Previously, it has been reported that Ca2+ signaling or Wnt/Ca2+ signaling can block the canonical Wnt signaling transduction through an activation of NFAT in Xenopus embryos (23Saneyoshi T. Kume S. Amasaki Y. Mikoshiba K. Nature. 2002; 417: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanism is not clear. Here, we report that NFAT participates in the inhibition of Wnt signaling through direct interaction with Dvl in the nucleus. The binding of NFAT to Dvl prevents Dvl recruiting to the β-catenin transcription complex, thus reducing the transcriptional activity of β-catenin. Furthermore, our data also reveal that the cross-talk between NFAT and Wnt signaling is involved in the proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells in the neural tube of chick embryo. Mouse NFATc4 cDNA was cloned into CMV promoter-based mammalian cell expression vector and subcloned into pET-28c plasmid. The expression plasmid of Dvl has been described previously (11Gan X.Q.

Chow at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York. Mouse anti-β-catenin (BD Bioscience), anti-TCF-4 (Millipore), anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-HA (Covance), and rabbit anti-phosphor-β-catenin (Ser-33/Ser-37/Thr-41) (Cell Signaling Technology) were acquired commercially. Wnt-3a conditioned medium (CM) and its control were described previously (24Mao J. Wang J. Liu B. Pan W. Farr 3rd, G.H. Flynn C. Yuan H. Takada S. Kimelman D. Li L. Wu D. Mol.

HEK293T were transfected with DNA using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). SW480, Caco-2, and LS174T cells were transfected with DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The LacZ plasmid was added to make the total amount of DNA equal (0.5 μg/well in a 24-well plate for SW480 cells and 0.25 μg/well for HEK293T cells). Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (25Li L. Yuan H. Weaver C.D. Mao J. Farr 3rd, G.H. Sussman D.J. Jonkers J. Kimelman D. Wu D.

His6-tagged and GST-fused proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and were partially purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid and GSH-Sepharose 4B beads, respectively. The in vitro pulldown assay was performed as described previously (11Gan X.Q. Wang J.Y. Xi Y. Wu Z.L. Li Y.P. Li L. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 1087-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The extraction of Total RNAs and the reverse transcription of the purified RNA was performed as described previously (11Gan X.Q. Wang J.Y. Xi Y. Wu Z.L. Li Y.P. Li L. J.

The quantification of all gene transcripts was done by quantitative PCR using the SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa) and an ABI 7500 apparatus (ABI). The primer pair used for human Axin2 was 5′-CTGGCTTTGGTGAACTGTTG-3′ and 5′-AGTTGCTCACAGCCAAGACA-3′, for DKK1 was 5′-CTGCAAAAATGGAATATGTGT-3′ and 5′-CTTCTTGTCCTTTGGTGTGA-3′, and for GAPDH was 5′-GCACCACCAACTGCTTA-3′ and 5′-AGTAGAGGCAGGGATGAT-3′. HEK293T cells were scraped into PBS and were fractionationed as described previously (26Li M. Wang H. Huang T. Wang J. Ding Y. Li Z. Zhang J. Li L. J. Biol.

For the endogenous interaction assay, the nucleus of 3–5 × 107 HEK293T cells were lysed, and the nuclear extracts were sonicated four times for 5 s in 1 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, and CompleteTM protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). ChIP assays were performed as described previously (27Wang G. Balamotis M.A. Stevens J.L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar); however, the immunoprecipitated DNA was quantified using quantitative PCR. The primer pair for human Axin2 TBE site was 5′-CTGGAGCCGGCTGCGCTTTGATAA-3′ and 5′-CGGCCCCGAAATCCATCGCTCTGA-3′. For human c-myc TBE site was 5′-CTCTCCACTTGCCCCTTTTAG-3′ and 5′-GAAGAGACAAATCCCCTTTGC-3′. Fertilized eggs were obtained from the Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences. The chick embryo in ovo electroporation was performed as described previously (28Yan Y. Bian W. Xie Z. Cao X. Le Roux I. Guillemot F. Jing N. Dev. Dyn. 2004; 231: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Section in situ hybridization was performed as described previously (29Birren S.J. Lo L. Anderson D.J. Development. 1993; 119: 597-610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Dvl protein family is an essential yet also perhaps the most enigmatic component of the Wnt signaling pathway. To address its function further, we sought to identify proteins acting directly with Dvl. A yeast two-hybrid screen of a mouse embryonic cDNA library was performed using mouse Dvl-1-C1 (residues 377–695) as the bait. A positive clone that encodes the C-terminal half of mouse NFATc4 (mNFATc4-C1) interacted strongly with the bait. To confirm this interaction, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation after transfecting HEK293T cells with HA-tagged mNFATc4 and FLAG-tagged Dvl-1, 2, and 3. All three Dvl homologs were co-immunoprecipitated with HA-tagged mNFATc4 (Fig. 1A), which suggests that NFAT binds to Dvl and has a universal binding activity to Dvl family members. We further purified His6-tagged full-length mNFATc4 and GST-mDvl-1 from E. coli. GST-mDvl-1, not GST alone, pulled down recombinant His6-tagged mNFATc4 in vitro (Fig. 1B), suggesting that NFAT can physically interact with Dvl. Moreover, we delineated the binding region within mNFATc4. As described in Fig. 1C, the N terminus of NFAT composed of the transactivation domain and regulatory domain is dispensable for interacting with Dvl, whereas the RHR has binding activity slightly less than that of full-length NFAT. Thus, we consider the RHR as the region critical for binding to Dvl. Proteins of the NFAT family play important roles in the Ca2+ signaling which induces dephosphorylation of NFAT leading to its nuclear transport. Thus, we examined whether calcium affected the interaction of NFAT and Dvl. We used the calcium ionophore ionomycin to mimic the Ca2+ signaling (30Macián F. García-Cózar F. Im S.H. Horton H.F.

Because the available NFAT-specific antibody does not detect endogenous NFAT well, we stably expressed FLAG-tagged mNFATc4 in HEK293T cells. NFAT was highly phosphorylated upon the stimulation with CsA, a calcineurin inhibitor, and was dephosphorylated after ionomycin was added (supplemental Fig. S1A), indicating that the cells responded to calcium signaling. We then carried out immunoprecipitation to detect the interaction of endogenous Dvl-3 with NFAT upon CsA or ionomycin treatment. As shown in Fig. 1D, Dvl-3 efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with NFAT in the presence of ionomycin, but did so weakly upon CsA treatment. To confirm further whether the two different forms of NFAT caused by CsA and ionomycin treatment have different affinity for Dvl, we stimulated the cells stably expressing NFAT with CsA or ionomycin and carried out immunoprecipitation with a FLAG antibody. Then, Dvl expressed in HEK293T cells was added. As shown in Fig. 1E, NFAT from Ca2+-stimulated samples appeared to have a higher binding affinity for Dvl. Given that the dephosphorylated form of NFAT is located predominantly in the nucleus. We further performed a co-IP experiment using an extract of the nucleus fraction to verify whether the interaction happens in the nucleus. Indeed, NFAT forms complex with Dvl in the nucleus upon the stimulation of Ca2+ signal (Fig. 1F). These data suggest that the interaction between NFAT and Dvl possibly takes place in the nucleus upon Ca2+ concentration elevation. It has been reported that Ca2+ or Wnt/Ca2+ signaling plays a negative role in regulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling (23Saneyoshi T. Kume S. Amasaki Y. Mikoshiba K. Nature. 2002; 417: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Thus, we used the LEF1/TCF-dependent reporter TOP-Flash to validate its effect in our system. As shown in Fig. 2A, ionomycin or expression of ΔCnA inhibited reporter gene activity induced by Wnt3a CM. This inhibition was reversed by a dominant negative form of mNFATc4 (DN-NFAT, mNFATc4-N in Fig. 1C) which only contains the N-terminal region of mNFATc4 and blocks endogenous NFAT activation (34Chow C.W. Rincón M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2300-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 35Luo C. Burgeon E. Rao A. J. Exp.

Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1B). However, DN-NFAT could not reverse the inhibitory effect caused by a constitutively active form of mNFATc4 (mNFATc4-CA) (Fig. 2C). mNFATc4-CA lacks its phosphorylation sites (sp1, sRR1/2) and is constitutively localized in the nucleus (supplemental Fig. S1C). It also interacts with Dvl (supplemental Fig. S1D). We also examined the effects of calcineurin or DN-NFAT expression on the mRNA levels of Axin-2 and DKK1, specific Wnt target genes (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. S2A), which provides a coincident result as reporter gene assay. These data confirmed the previous findings that NFAT is not only a component of calcium signaling (Fig. 2D, right), but also a regulator that mediates the inhibition of the Wnt pathway by calcium signaling, especially via calcineurin. NFAT proteins can also act as transcriptional activator. We investigated whether the transcriptional activity of NFAT was required for its inhibitory effect on Wnt signaling. The RHR domain of mNFATc4 contains the DNA-binding activity but not transactivation activity (supplemental Fig. S2B). The fact that RHR alone could suppress Wnt signaling (Fig. 2E) suggests that the transcriptional activity of NFAT is dispensable for its ability to suppress Wnt signaling. It has been reported previously that NFAT participates in the regulation of Wnt signaling by acting upstream of β-catenin (23Saneyoshi T. Kume S. Amasaki Y. Mikoshiba K. Nature. 2002; 417: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). However, in our system, neither calcineurin expression nor NFAT-CA expression interfered with the contents of phosphorylated β-catenin (Ser-33, Ser-37, and Thr-41) or β-catenin nuclear accumulation whereas expression of GSK3β or Axin did (Fig. 3, A and B). These results indicate that NFAT may not influence the stability of β-catenin. Therefore, we postulated that NFAT may repress Wnt signaling in the nucleus by blocking the transactivation function of β-catenin. This hypothesis is consistent with the aforementioned finding that the interaction of NFAT with Dvl is induced by Ca2+ signals in the nucleus. To test this hypothesis, LS174T cells that contain oncogenic mutation of β-catenin gene (37Yang M. Zhong W.W. Srivastava N. Slavin A. Yang J. Hoey T. An S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 6027-6032Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 38Mahmoudi T. Li V.S. Ng S.S. Taouatas N. Vries R.G. Mohammed S. Heck A.J. Clevers H. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 3329-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and Caco-2 or SW480 cells which contain mutated adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) (39Santoro I.M. Groden J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 488-494PubMed Google Scholar) were used to examine the effect of Ca2+ signaling/NFAT on Wnt reporter activity. As shown in Fig. 3C, overexpression of calcineurin or NFAT-CA led to a repression of Wnt reporter gene activity in these cells. Taken together, these data suggest that calcineurin and NFAT regulate Wnt signaling downstream of β-catenin. Saneyoshi et al. reported that NFAT functions upstream of β-catenin when co-expressed with β-catenin in Xenopus (23Saneyoshi T. Kume S. Amasaki Y. Mikoshiba K. Nature. 2002; 417: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). We believed that this difference may be caused by using different system or different detection approach. We further delineated the regions within Dvl responsible for its interaction with NFAT to residues 450–695, which is the same region that binds to β-catenin (Fig. 4A). The interaction of Dvl with β-catenin was shown to enhance the stability of β-catenin-TCF complex (11Gan X.Q. Wang J.Y. Xi Y. Wu Z.L. Li Y.P. Li L. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 1087-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Thus, we suspected that NFAT might disrupt the interaction between Dvl and β-catenin to inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We purified His6-tagged β-catenin, His6-tagged NFAT-FLAG, and GST-mDvl-1 from E. coli. In the competition binding assay, NFAT disrupted GST-mDvl-1 and His6-β-catenin interaction in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, the endogenous interaction of Dvl and β-catenin in the nucleus under Wnt stimulation could also be disrupted by overexpression of NFAT-CA and ΔCnA (Fig. 4C). These data together suggest that NFAT inhibits Wnt signaling by interfering with the formation of stable Dvl-β-catenin complex. Given that the interaction of Dvl and β-catenin is important for the transcription complex formation on the Wnt target gene promoter (11Gan X.Q. Wang J.Y. Xi Y. Wu Z.L. Li Y.P. Li L. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 1087-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), we used ChIP to determine the effect of NFAT on the binding of β-catenin and Dvl to the Axin-2 (Fig. 4D) and the c-myc promoters (supplemental Fig. S2C). Overexpression of ΔCnA or NFAT-CA decreased the amounts of Dvl and β-catenin on the Axin-2 promoters, whereas TCF4 bound to the promoters remained unaffected (Fig. 4D). Moreover, DN-NFAT could rescue the inhibition effect of ΔCnA (Fig. 4D). These results support a conclusion that NFAT functions downstream of β-catenin probably by disrupting the interaction of β-catenin with Dvl. To investigate the physiological role of NFAT in modulating canonical Wnt signaling, we extended our analysis to the central nerve system development in chick embryos. Wnt proteins are important morphogens during the development of the CNS. Wnt signaling through activation of the β-catenin/TCF pathway promotes the proliferation of neural precursor cells and prevents differentiation (40Megason S.G. McMahon A.P. Development. 2002; 129: 2087-2098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether NFAT plays a role in this process via its regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling. First, we performed in situ hybridization analysis to detect the expression of three predicted chick NFAT genes, NFATc1, c2, and c3 in the developing spinal cord. As shown in supplemental Fig. S3, NFATc1 is expressed predominantly in the neural tube among three NFATs in chick spinal cord. Interestingly, the expression of NFATc1 is restricted in the ventricular zone during development, and it is highly expressed in the late stages, where Wnt activity must be limited for progenitor cell differentiation (40Megason S.G. McMahon A.P. Development. 2002; 129: 2087-2098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, we electroporated a NFAT reporter pNFAT-RE-TK-RFP into the developing neural tube of chicken embryos at Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) stages 10 and 11 (41Hamburger V. Hamilton H.L. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 195: 231-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar) to detect the active form of endogenous NFAT. The expression of RFP was controlled by four repeats of the NFAT responsible element (NFAT-RE) from NFAT-luciferase reporter and was analyzed at HH stages 17 and 18 to visualize the endogenous NFAT activity. As shown in Fig. 5A, RFP was expressed across the neural tube from the dorsal to the ventral side, which indicates that endogenous NFAT is activated during the course of development. Moreover, we tested whether NFATc1 could also interact with Dvl. We cloned both human and mouse NFATc1, respectively, and the immunoprecipitation was carried out. As shown in Fig. 5B, hNFATc1 and mNFATc1 were co-immunoprecipitated with Dvl as well as mNFATc4. Given that the RHR domain in NFAT is responsible for binding to Dvl and it is conserved among species, we assume that chick NFAT protein could also interact with Dvl. We further co-electroporated the pTOP-Flash reporter with DN-NFAT to test whether endogenous NFAT would modulate Wnt signaling in the neural tube. Overexpression of DN-NFAT which inhibits endogenous NFAT activity (Fig. 5A) increased the luciferase activity of pTOP-Flash (Fig. 5C), which suggests an inhibitory effect of NFAT in Wnt signaling. Because chick NFATc1 is expressed predominantly in the neural tube (supplemental Fig. S3), we performed RNAi experiment to knock down endogenous cNFATc1 (supplemental Fig. S4A), which led to increase in the activity of TOP-Flash (supplemental Fig. S4B). We also used pTOP-TK-RFP to mark the range of activity of the Wnt signaling. RFP expression was also up-regulated by DN-NFAT and spread throughout the whole neural tube, with a disturbed Wnt gradient along the dorsal-ventral axes (Fig. 5, D and E). Taken together, these results indicate that endogenous NFAT activity also negatively regulates Wnt signaling in chick neural tube. During CNS development, the canonical Wnt pathway functions as a mitogenic signal of neural progenitor cells (40Megason S.G. McMahon A.P. Development. 2002; 129: 2087-2098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway blocks neural precursors differentiation (42Ille F. Atanasoski S. Falk S. Ittner L.M. Märki D. Büchmann-M⊘ller S. Wurdak H. Suter U. Taketo M.M. Sommer L. Dev. Biol. 2007; 304: 394-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that NFAT may participate in regulating this process by interfering with Wnt signaling. Immunostaining of Tuj1, a neuron-specific class III β-tubulin, was used to measure the number of mature neurons at HH stages 20 and 21. Overexpression of DN-NFAT significantly decreased Tuj1-positive cells on the transfected side compared with the control side, whereas transfection of a GFP plasmid had no effect (Fig. 5, F and G, left). In contrast, BrdUrd staining, which monitors the proliferation of neural progenitor cells, was increased by DN-NFAT (Fig. 5, F and G, right). These data indicate that endogenous Ca2+/NFAT signaling negatively regulates neural progenitor cell proliferation and positively regulates differentiation. To test whether this function depends on its inhibition of Wnt signaling, we co-electroporated with ΔN-LEF1 to repress Wnt signaling through binding to the TBE site (Fig. 5, F and G). Consistent with our hypothesis, co-expression of ΔN-LEF1 rescued the decrease of Tuj1-positive cell number as well as the increase of BrdUrd cell numbers (Fig. 5, F and G). Taken together, the above data suggest that NFAT pathway regulates neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation in the neural tube of chick embryo by antagonizing Wnt signaling. We noticed that Graef and colleagues employed triple mutant mice to illustrate that the NFATc2/c3/c4 mutant did not interfere with βIII-tubulin or certain cell-specific markers in the CNS (43Graef I.A. Wang F. Charron F. Chen L. Neilson J. Tessier-Lavigne M. Crabtree G.R. Cell. 2003; 113: 657-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In our system, chick NFATc1, among the three chick NFAT types, was expressed predominantly in the neural tube. Furthermore, we used a dominant negative form of NFAT to block the activation of all three NFAT types. Thus, as a result, we observed the function of NFAT in the regulation of neural differentiation. The negative regulation of Wnt signaling by NFAT allows the progenitor cell to exit the cell cycle and differentiate (Fig. 5, F and G). However, the upstream stimulation of NFAT is not clear yet. The Ca2+-calcineurin signal is the most important signal for regulating NFAT activation, but the signal that leads to Ca2+ influx during neural tube differentiation is still unclear. In summary, we propose a framework in which NFAT modulates canonical Wnt signaling based on this work and our previous finding (11Gan X.Q. Wang J.Y. Xi Y. Wu Z.L. Li Y.P. Li L. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 1087-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5H). NFAT negatively regulates the Wnt signaling through interacting with Dvl, which disrupts the association of Dvl and β-catenin, leading to the destabilization of β-catenin-LEF1/TCF transcriptional complex. Furthermore, NFAT functions as a “modulator” of neural progenitor cell differentiation. In the neural tube of chick embryos, endogenous NFAT is progressively expressed in the ventricular zone of neural tube at the time when the Wnt signaling needs to be reduced. The suppression of the Wnt signaling induces precursor cells to exit the cell cycle and promotes their differentiation, which comprises the function of NFAT in the development of the CNS. We thank D.

ER Ca(2+) depletion initiates the oligomerization of stromal interaction molecules (STIM) that control SOCE activation, but whether ER Ca(2+) refilling controls STIM de-oligomerization and SOCE termination is not known. Here, we correlate the changes in free luminal ER Ca(2+) concentrations ([Ca(2+)](ER)) and in STIM1 oligomerization, using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between CFP-STIM1 and YFP-STIM1. We observed that STIM1 de-oligomerized at much lower [Ca(2+)](ER) levels during store refilling than it oligomerized during store depletion. We then refilled ER stores without adding exogenous Ca(2+) using a membrane-permeable Ca(2+) chelator to provide a large reservoir of buffered Ca(2+). This procedure rapidly restored pre-stimulatory [Ca(2+)](ER) levels but did not trigger STIM1 de-oligomerization, the FRET signals remaining elevated as long as the external [Ca(2+)] remained low. STIM1 dissociation evoked by Ca(2+) readmission was prevented by SOC channel inhibition and was associated with cytosolic Ca(2+) elevations restricted to STIM1 puncta, indicating that Ca(2+) acts on a cytosolic target close to STIM1 clusters. These data indicate that the refilling of ER Ca(2+) stores is not sufficient to induce STIM1 de-oligomerization and that localized Ca(2+) elevations in the vicinity of assembled SOCE complexes are required for the termination of SOCE."

Activase is thought to play a central role in coordinating the rate of CO2 fixation with the light reactions of photosynthesis. Here, we present a 1.9 Å crystal structure of the C-domain core of creosote activase. The fold consists of a canonical four-helix bundle, from which a paddle-like extension protrudes that entails a nine-turn helix lined by an irregularly structured peptide strand. The residues Lys-313 and Val-316 involved in the species-specific recognition of Rubisco are located near the tip of the paddle. An ionic bond between Lys-313 and Glu-309 appears to stabilize the glycine-rich end of the helix. Structural superpositions onto the distant homolog FtsH imply that the paddles extend away from the hexameric toroid in a fan-like fashion, such that the hydrophobic sides of each blade bearing Trp-302 are facing inward and the polar sides bearing Lys-313 and Val-316 are facing outward. Therefore, we speculate that upon binding, the activase paddles embrace the Rubisco cylinder by placing their hydrophobic patches near the partner protein. This model suggests that conformational adjustments at the remote end of the paddle may relate to selectivity in recognition, rather than specific ionic contacts involving Lys-313. Additionally, the superpositions predict that the catalytically critical Arg-293 does not interact with the bound nucleotide.

https://openalex.org/W1991107453,"Carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D β-lactamases (CHDLs) represent an emerging antibiotic resistance mechanism encountered among the most opportunistic Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. We report here the substrate kinetics and mechanistic characterization of a prominent CHDL, the OXA-58 enzyme, from Acinetobacter baumannii. OXA-58 uses a carbamylated lysine to activate the nucleophilic serine used for β-lactam hydrolysis. The deacylating water molecule approaches the acyl-enzyme species, anchored at this serine (Ser-83), from the α-face. Our data show that OXA-58 retains the catalytic machinery found in class D β-lactamases, of which OXA-10 is representative. Comparison of the homology model of OXA-58 and the recently solved crystal structures of OXA-24 and OXA-48 with the OXA-10 crystal structure suggests that these CHDLs have evolved the ability to hydrolyze imipenem, an important carbapenem in clinical use, by subtle structural changes in the active site. These changes may contribute to tighter binding of imipenem to the active site and removal of steric hindrances from the path of the deacylating water molecule."

The manipulation of bacterial protein glycosylation systems from Gram-negative bacteria for the synthesis of recombinant glycoproteins is a promising alternative to the current production methods. Proteins carrying Lewis antigens have been shown to have potential applications for the treatment of diverse autoimmune diseases. In this work, we developed a mixed approach consisting of in vivo and in vitro steps for the synthesis of glycoproteins containing the Lewis x antigen. Using glycosyltransferases from Haemophilus influenzae, we engineered Escherichia coli to assemble a tetrasaccharide on the lipid carrier undecaprenylphosphate. This glycan was transferred in vivo from the lipid to a carrier protein by the Campylobacter jejuni oligosaccharyltransferase PglB. The glycoprotein was then fucosylated in vitro by a truncated fucosyltransferase from Helicobacter pylori. Diverse mass spectrometry techniques were used to confirm the structure of the glycan. The strategy presented here could be adapted in the future for the synthesis of diverse glycoproteins. Our experiments demonstrate that bacterial enzymes can be exploited for the production of glycoproteins carrying glycans present in human cells for potential therapeutic applications."

Prendergast M.M. Appelmelk B.J. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1996; 16: 105-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The critical role of LOS sialylation in pathogenesis is also reflected by the constitutive expression and maintenance of a highly conserved LOS-specific sialyltransferase in the clinically invasive Neisseria pathogens (sequence identity >95%) (17Rest R.F.

The Neisseria LOS-specific sialyltransferase (NST) catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid (Neu5Ac) from the donor (CMP-Neu5Ac) to the non-reducing end of the galactosyl residue at the terminus of the LOS acceptor. In addition, NST is bifunctional in both acceptor specificity (e.g. the globotriaose- and lacto-N-neotetraose-containing LOS acceptors) and flexibility in catalyzing either α2,3 or α2,6 glycosidic bond formation (9Moran A.P.

In N. meningitidis expressing the L1-type LOS and some Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains that express an acceptor LOS with a globotriaose terminus, NST catalyzes α2,6 glycosidic bond formation between the sialic acid and the terminal galactosyl residue on the acceptor (16Gulati S.

In N. meningitidis serotypes L2, -3, -5, -7, and -9 and some N. gonorrhoeae strains, NST catalyzes α2,3 linkage formation from sialic acid to the lacto-N-neotetraose moiety on LOS (9Moran A.P. Prendergast M.M. Appelmelk B.J. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1996; 16: 105-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on sequence relationships, sialyltransferases have been categorized into five different glycosyltransferase families (GT-29, -38, 42, -52, and -80) in the Carbohydrate Active enZYmes data base (CAZY) (20Coutinho P.M. Deleury E. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Under this convention, NST is placed within the GT-52 family. The structures of the bacterial sialyltransferases are of biochemical and pharmaceutical interest because sialylation contributes directly to bacterial virulence, and the three-dimensional structure of sialyltransferases can provide insight into the design of specific inhibitors that have promise as potential antibacterials. The four previously reported sialyltransferase structures (from CAZY families GT29, -42, -80) have showed either of two types of protein fold typical of all nucleotide-activated glycosyltransferase families, denoted as GT-A and GT-B (21Lairson L.L.

The crystal structures of the LOS-specific sialyltransferases from Campylobacter jejuni (CST-I and -II) in family GT-42 is representative of the GT-A fold (22Chiu C.P. Watts A.G. Lairson L.L.

Glycobiology. 2008; 18: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) in family GT-80 employ a GT-B fold. In addition, NST has a predicted transmembrane helix at the N terminus that anchors the catalytic domain to the outer membrane on the extracellular surface (18Shell D.M. Chiles L. Judd R.C. Seal S. Rest R.F. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3744-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this work we have developed a detergent-based purification strategy that significantly improves the solubility of an engineered form of NST from N. meningitidis, facilitating biochemical and crystallographic analysis. The NST structures and accompanying kinetic/mechanistic analysis of structure-based point mutations reveal many unique features that are distinct from previously published glycosyltransferases. In particular, observation of a domain-swapped dimeric form of the enzyme that appears to be mediated by lipid binding and the observed requirement for the presence of high affinity acceptor substrates and analogs for crystallization of the NST-donor complex could imply a potential activating role of the acceptor substrate in regulating NST function at the extracellular surface of the bacterial membrane. The truncation mutant Δ29NST was constructed from the previously cloned N. meningitidis 126E(L1) LOS sialyltransferase structural gene (GenBankTM accession number U60662) (27Wakarchuk W.W. Watson D. St. Michael F. Li J. Wu Y. Brisson J.R. Young N.M. Gilbert M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12785-12790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Two versions of the Δ29NST were constructed. One carries a thrombin-cleavable maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion tag at the N terminus of Δ29NST in the pCW vector described previously (28Wakarchuk W.W. Campbell R.L. Sung W.L. Davoodi J. Yaguchi M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The other carries a thrombin-cleavable His8 tag at the C terminus of Δ29NST in the pET41b+ vector (Novagen), to which a thrombin-cleavable sequence was introduced in between the HindIII and NotI restriction sites. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the Pfu HT QuikChange kit (Stratagene) on both the MBP-fused Δ29NST structural gene in pCW vector and the His8-tagged Δ29NST structural gene in pET41 vector to make the following single point mutants: E124A (GAG → GCT), H280A (CAC → GCG), R282A (CGC → GCA), D258A (GAC → GCG), D258N (GAC → AAC), D164N (GAC → AAC), and D165N (GAC → AAC). The DNA sequences of the constructs and mutants were validated via DNA sequencing by the Nucleic Acid Protein Service Unit at the University of British Columbia (Vancouver, BC, Canada). All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The substrate analogs, CMP-3F(axial)-Neu5Ac (a synthetic Neu5Ac with a fluorine atom substitution at axial) and CMP-3F(equatorial)-Neu5Ac were synthesized and purified using previously established methods (29Yu H. Yu H. Karpel R. Chen X. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2004; 12: 6427-6435Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The Δ29NST structural gene was directly amplified by PCR from MBP-NST with the forward primer, 5′-GCTGGAGCTGGACATATGGGGGAAAGGAATGCGGTTTCCCTGC-3′, which contains a NdeI restriction site (underlined) in the 5′ end, and the reverse primer, 5′-CCTAGGTCGACTCATTAATTTTTATCGTCAAATGTCAAAATC-3′, which contains a SalI restriction site (underlined). The amplified PCR products were digested with NdeI and SalI and then ligated using T4 DNA ligase into the expression vector, pCWMalET, which encodes the MBP fusion domain for enhanced solubility and ease of purification. The plasmid product was transformed into Escherichia coli AD202 (E. coli Genetic Stock Center, CGSC #7297) using electroporation, and the Δ29NST was expressed in the form of the MBP fusion protein. 1100 volume of the overnight starter culture was used to inoculate the 2x yeast extract-tryptone (2YT) media supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.2% (w/v) of d(+)-glucose. The cultures were incubated with shaking (200 rpm at 37 °C) until an A600 of ∼ 0.2 and were induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 20 °C with further overnight incubation. Approximately 11 g of cell pellet was collected from 2 liters of overnight culture. Protein purification was carried out at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (2 mm EDTA (pH 7.5), 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol) supplemented with a Roche Applied Science EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet and lysed at 20,000 p.s.i. using the Avestin Emulsiflex homogenizer. The lysate was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting supernatant was loaded onto a column (1 column volume of 20 ml) of amylose resin (New England Biolabs) that was equilibrated with the binding buffer (2 mm EDTA (pH 7.5), 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The bound MBP-Δ29NST fusion protein was fractionated with the elution buffer (binding buffer plus 10 mm maltose). The MBP-Δ29NST was dialyzed overnight in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 10% (v/v) glycerol and then further purified on a Mono Q (GE Healthcare) ion exchange column equilibrated with the binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 10% (v/v) glycerol). Fractions with pure MBP-Δ29NST eluted between 150 and 250 mm NaCl. Last, the MBP-Δ29NST was concentrated on a Centricon 30-kDa cutoff membrane and buffer-exchanged to 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol over a Superdex 200 gel-filtration column (GE Health). The primers for the Δ29NST destined for the pET-41b+ vector were 5′-GCATTACGCATATGGGGGAAAGGAATGC-3′ (NdeI restriction site is underlined) and 5′-GCATTACGAAGCTTATCGTCAAATGTCAAA-3′ (HindIII restriction site is underlined). The PCR reaction was performed using the MBP-Δ29NST in pCW vector as a template. The PCR products were restricted with NdeI and HindIII and then ligated to a modified pET-41b+ expression vector in which a thrombin-cleavable sequence has been introduced to facilitate removal of the His8 tag from expressed Δ29NST. The plasmid product was transformed into the expression strain E. coli BL21(DE3). 1100 volume of the overnight starter culture was used to inoculate the LB media. The culture was incubated with shaking at 200 rpm and 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.6 and then heat-shocked at 42 °C by air for 45 min (30Chen J. Acton T.B. Basu S.K. Montelione G.T. Inouye M. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 4: 519-524PubMed Google Scholar). After heat shock, the culture was cooled to 20 °C in a water bath followed by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 0.75 mm for induction (30Chen J. Acton T.B. Basu S.K. Montelione G.T. Inouye M. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 4: 519-524PubMed Google Scholar) and was further incubated overnight with shaking at 200 rpm in a 20 °C incubator. Approximately 6 g of cell pellet was collected from a 1-liter culture. All protein purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in the lysis buffer (20 mm MES (pH 6.5), 500 mm NaCl, 0.090% (w/v) Triton X-100) supplemented with the Roche Applied Science EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet and lysed using a high pressure homogenizer (Avestin Emulsiflex). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 40 min. Expressed Δ29NST in the supernatant was bound to a Ni2+-charged Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare). 10 column volumes of wash buffer (20 mm MES (pH 6.5), 50 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 0.0090% (w/v) Triton X-100) followed by 10 column volumes of re-equilibration buffer (20 mm MES (pH 6.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.0090% (w/v) Triton X-100) were applied to wash the protein-bound column. Δ29NST was fractionated with the elution buffer (20 mm MES (pH 6.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.0090% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 50 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)). Digestion of the His8 tag was carried out with a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml thrombin (Sigma) on the purified Δ29NST for 2 days at 4 °C (>80% digested). The thrombin-digested reaction was concentrated 35-fold on a Centricon 30-kDa cutoff centrifugal concentrator and then further purified on a Superdex 200 (HR 10/30, column volume of 24 ml, GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm MES (pH 6.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.0045% (w/v) of Triton X-100. The eluted Δ29NST was concentrated 2-fold on a 30-kDa cutoff centrifugal concentrator maintaining the final Triton X-100 concentration at or below 0.009% (w/v) and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage. The final concentration of Δ29NST is typically in the range of 3–5 mg/ml, which is suitable for crystallization. The selenomethionine-labeled Δ29NST was prepared using the culture media described by Doublié (31Doublié S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar) and purified using the procedure as described above. The crystallization and subsequent crystal manipulations were performed at 4 °C. Δ29NST was crystallized by vapor diffusion methods using 1-μl drops of protein as prepared above mixed with an equal volume of crystallization buffer from the well reservoir. Initial screens were performed with the selenomethionine labeled apo form of Δ29NST. Ordered crystals formed in 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.2–4.4) and 1.7 m di-ammonium sulfate (space group P21212; Table 1, column b). Crystallization of native (non-selenomethionine-containing) Δ29NST with CDP was also achieved in this same crystal form (Table 1, column c). Attempts to co-crystallize under the same conditions Δ29NST in complex with both the equatorial variant of the donor substrate analog CMP-3F(equatorial)-Neu5Ac (5 mm) and the acceptor, lactose (25 mm), resulted in density defining only CMP bound to NST (Table 1, column a). This suggests that the 3F(equatorial)-Neu5Ac of the donor was likely hydrolyzed and released during the crystallization process. Further co-crystallization of ternary complex structures was attempted with 25–50 mm various acceptors (see below) and 0.35 mm CMP-3F(axial)-Neu5Ac donor analog (which showed better resistance to hydrolytic cleavage than the equatorial counterpart in our kinetic studies). Despite the testing of a variety of acceptors including the higher affinity lactosides benzyl lactoside, thiophenyl lactoside, BODIPY lactoside, and n-propyl lactoside, no density corresponding to the acceptor was visualized in our resulting electron density maps. However, interestingly, the presence of these acceptors in the crystallization mix was necessary to generate the binary complex structures of intact donor CMP-3F(axial)-Neu5Ac bound to NST. Highly similar donor analog complexes crystallized in space group C2221 were generated in this way using either 50 mm n-propyl lactoside (Table 1, column d) or benzyl lactoside acceptors in 180 mm trisodium citrate, 5 mm MnCl2, and 15% (v/v) PEG4000 (pH 6.5) in the reservoir as well as with 25 mm thiophenyl lactoside acceptor in 180 mm trisodium citrate, 5 mm MnCl2, and 17% (v/v) PEG2000 (pH 6.5) in the reservoir.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsParametersabcdSeMet-NST·CMP complexSeMet-NST Free enzymeNST·CDP complexNST·CMP-3F(axial)-Neu5Ac complexLigand(s) used for co-crystallizationCMP-3F(equatorial)-Neu5Ac + LactoseCDPCMP-3F(axial)-Neu5Ac + n-propyl lactosideLigand observed in the structureCMPCDPCMP-3F(axial)-Neu5AcLipid binding site modeled withaThe head group of the detergent Triton X-100 is polyethylene glycol (PEG) composed of 9 or 10 units of ethylene glycol.PEGTriton X-100PEGPEGPDB entry2yk52yk42yk62yk7Data collection statistics BeamlineALS 822ALS 822Rigaku MicroMax 007HFRigaku MicroMax 007HF Wavelength (Å)0.9800.9801.541.54 Resolution limits (Å)2.33 (2.41-2.33)1.94 (1.97-1.94)2.83 (2.88-2.83)2.18 (2.22-2.18) Space groupP21212P21212P21212C2221 Unit cell dimension (Å)85.7, 124.1, 41.986.6, 124.7, 41.986.1, 123.5, 41.742.8, 101.4, 166.6 Unique reflections19,83934,36511,16219,377 Redundancy7.1 (7.1)8.8 (8.5)6.8 (5.1)7.6 (5.4) Completeness (%)100.0 (100.0)100 (99.9)99.7 (97.8)97.1 (84.9) I/σ(I)17.0 (3.89)35.5 (3.22)15.4 (2.70)23.9 (2.64) Rmerge (%)13.7 (40.0)6.7 (46.2)12.1 (52.2)9.0 (46.7) Mosaicity0.18-0.260.20-0.320.38-0.470.68-0.82Refinement statistics Resolution limits (Å)2.32.02.82.2 Number of reflections in working set18,82532,60410,61317,844 Number of reflections in test set1,0081,735529957 Rfactor of working set (%)17.519.318.119.6 Rfree (%)22.022.024.025.3 r.m.s.d. bond length (Å)0.0190.0200.0200.019 r.m.s.d. bond angles (°)1.6801.8801.8351.773 Average B factors (Å2)20.733.028.430.4 Ramachandran analysis (most favored, allowed, disallowed)98.2, 1.8, 0%99.4, 0.6, 0%95.0, 5.0, 0%97.8, 2.2, 0%a The head group of the detergent Triton X-100 is polyethylene glycol (PEG) composed of 9 or 10 units of ethylene glycol. Open table in a new tab The initial model of the selenomethionine-incorporated Δ29NST (CMP-bound NST complex; Table 1, column a) was solved in the P21212 space group at 2.4 Å resolution from single wavelength anomalous dispersion data collected on the peak of the selenium absorption edge (0.9798 Å with an F′ of −8.0 and an F″ of 4.5) on beamline 822 at the Advanced Light Source (Berkeley, CA). Diffraction data were indexed and integrated with DENZO and reduced with SCALEPACK using the HKL2000 program suite (32Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38527) Google Scholar). A calculated Matthews coefficient of VM = 2.79 Å3/dalton suggests 1 monomer of NST per asymmetric unit and a solvent content of 56%. The scaled data together with the amino acid sequence of the Δ29NST was input into the Phenix-AutoSol suite, which located 11 of the 12 selenium sites (Met-1 is not detected) and built 214 of the 340 residues (Rfactor of 40%). Improvement of the initial model was carried out interactively with the model building program Coot (33Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23229) Google Scholar) and refined with the program Refmac in the CCP4 software suite (34Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13855) Google Scholar). During refinement of the initial model, it became clearly evident from the observed electron density that a domain swap of the 2 monomers aligning on the 2-fold crystallographic symmetry axis was present as judged by the 2Fo − Fc composite omit map. The refined selenomethionine-labeled structure was subsequently used as a phasing model to solve the apo and binary complex structures of the ligand-bound NST in both space groups P21212 and C2221 using the program MolRep. The crystallographic asymmetric unit in the space groups C2221 and P21212 contains a monomer of NST in association with another subunit related by a crystallographic dyad axis of 180°, suggesting an extensive homo-dimerization of NST. This same homo-dimerization interface is also supported by lower resolution NST structures solved in space group P212121, for which the crystallographic asymmetric unit contains the two molecules of a similarly domain swapped dimer of NST (data not shown). We also note that in our electron density maps, residues Pro-49—Lys-370 and the engineered C-terminal thrombin cleavage sequence are clearly visible, but the segment from Gly-30 to Gln-48 is disordered, suggesting mobility of the N termini in the crystal lattice. In the four structures listed in Table 1, columns a–d, Ramachandran analysis (Procheck (35Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar)) indicated that all the backbone ψ and φ angles are in the most favored (98.15, 99.38, 95.05, and 97.81%) and in the allowed (1.85, 0.62, 4.95, and 2.19%) conformations, respectively. Sialyltransferase activity was monitored using a continuous coupled assay analogous to that previously described (22Chiu C.P. Watts A.G. Lairson L.L. Gilbert M. Lim D. Wakarchuk W.W. Withers S.G.

https://openalex.org/W2067332977,"Zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIPK) has been implicated in Ca(2+)-independent smooth muscle contraction, although its specific role is unknown. The addition of ZIPK to demembranated rat caudal arterial strips induced an increase in force, which correlated with increases in LC(20) and MYPT1 phosphorylation. However, because of the number of kinases capable of phosphorylating LC(20) and MYPT1, it has proven difficult to identify the mechanism underlying ZIPK action. Therefore, we set out to identify bona fide ZIPK substrates using a chemical genetics method that takes advantage of ATP analogs with bulky substituents at the N(6) position and an engineered ZIPK capable of utilizing such substrates. (32)P-Labeled 6-phenyl-ATP and ZIPK-L93G mutant protein were added to permeabilized rat caudal arterial strips, and substrate proteins were detected by autoradiography following SDS-PAGE. Mass spectrometry identified LC(20) as a direct target of ZIPK in situ for the first time. Tissues were also exposed to 6-phenyl-ATP and ZIPK-L93G in the absence of endogenous ATP, and putative ZIPK substrates were identified by Western blotting. LC(20) was thereby confirmed as a direct target of ZIPK; however, no phosphorylation of MYPT1 was detected. We conclude that ZIPK is involved in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction through direct phosphorylation of LC(20)."
https://openalex.org/W2092038973,"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are specialized in the production of type I interferon (type I IFN), which promotes antiviral and antitumor responses, as well as autoimmune disorders. Activation of type I IFN secretion depends on the pattern recognition receptors TLR7 and TLR9, which sense microbial RNA and DNA, respectively. Type I IFN production is modulated by several receptors, including the type II C-type lectin domain family 4, member C (CLEC4C). The natural ligand of CLEC4C is unknown. To identify it, here we probed a glycan array with a soluble form of the CLEC4C ectodomain. We found that CLEC4C recognizes complex type sugars with terminal galactose. Importantly, soluble CLEC4C bound peripheral blood leukocytes and tumor cells that express glycans with galactose residues at the non-reducing ends. The positive and negative modulation of galactose residues on cell membranes was paralleled by the regulation of type I IFN secretion by plasmacytoid dendritic cells in co-culture experiments in vitro. These results suggest that the modulation in the expression of non-sialylated oligosaccharides by invading pathogens or transformed cells may affect type I IFN response and immune surveillance."

In many types of cancer cells, integrin α6β4 is up-regulated, laminin is cleaved, and hemidesmosomes are disrupted, eventually causing an enhancement of cancer cell movement and facilitation of their invasion. We previously showed that the immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecule Necl-2 (Nectin-like molecule 2), known as a tumor suppressor, inhibits cancer cell movement by suppressing the ErbB3/ErbB2 signaling. We show here that Necl-2 interacts in cis with integrin α6β4. The binding of Necl-2 with integrin β4 was mediated by its extracellular region. In human colorectal adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells, integrin α6β4 was localized at hemidesmosomes. Small interfering RNA-mediated suppression of Necl-2 expression enhanced the phorbol ester-induced disruption of the integrin α6β4 complex at hemidesmosomes, whereas expression of Necl-2 suppressed the disruption of this structure.

The Necl family consists of five members, Necl-1, -2, -3, -4, and -5, and comprises a superfamily with the nectin family, which consists of four members, nectin-1, -2, -3, and -4. All members of this superfamily have similar domain structures: one extracellular region with three Ig-like loops, one transmembrane segment, and one cytoplasmic region. Necl-2 has many nomenclatures: IgSF4a, RA175, SgIGSF, TSLC1, SynCAM, and CADM1 (4Gomyo H. Arai Y. Tanigami A. Murakami Y. Hattori M. Hosoda F. Arai K. Aikawa Y. Tsuda H. Hirohashi S. Asakawa S.

Necl-2 was originally deposited to GenBankTM in 1998; IgSF4a was identified as a candidate for a tumor suppressor gene in the loss of heterozygosity region of chromosome at 11q23.2 (4Gomyo H. Arai Y.

Necl-2 shows Ca2+-independent homophilic cell-cell adhesion activity and Ca2+-independent heterophilic cell-cell adhesion activity with other members of the nectin and Necl families, Necl-1 and nectin-3, and Class-I-restricted T-cell-associated molecule (3Shingai T.

A cytoplasmic region of Necl-2 is responsible for binding with many peripheral membranous proteins. In particular, the juxtamembrane region of the cytoplasmic region has a band 4.1-binding motif and binds tumor suppressor, DAL-1, the band 4.1 family member, which connects Necl-2 to the actin cytoskeleton (11Yageta M. Kuramochi M. Masuda M. Fukami T. Fukuhara H. Maruyama T. Shibuya M. Murakami Y. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5129-5133PubMed Google Scholar).

Necl-2 has been shown to be a tumor suppressor in human non-small cell lung cancer (5Kuramochi M. Fukuhara H. Nobukuni T. Kanbe T. Maruyama T. Ghosh H.P. Pletcher M. Isomura M. Onizuka M. Kitamura T. Sekiya T. Reeves R.H. Murakami Y. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), and our previous results indicate that Necl-2 serves as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the ErbB3/ErbB2 signaling (14Kawano S. Ikeda W. Kishimoto M. Ogita H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 23793-23805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). ErbB2 and ErbB3 have kinase domains in their cytoplasmic regions, but that of ErbB3 lacks kinase activity. Therefore, the homo-dimer of ErbB3 formed by binding of heregulin does not transduce any intracellular signaling. By contrast, ErbB2 heterophilically interacts in cis with heregulin-occupied ErbB3 and phosphorylates nine tyrosine residues of ErbB3, causing recruitment and activation of the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and the subsequent activation of Rac small G protein and Akt protein kinase (15Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5197) Google Scholar). Necl-2 interacts in cis with ErbB3, but not with ErbB2, through their extracellular regions and inhibits the heregulin-induced, ErbB2-catalyzed tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB3 and ErbB3-mediated activation of Rac and Akt, resulting in the inhibition of cancer cell movement and survival. These inhibitory effects of Necl-2 require both the extracellular and cytoplasmic regions and the binding of the cytoplasmic region with protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN13, also known as a tumor suppressor (14Kawano S.

Litjens S.H. Sonnenberg A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 2877-2886Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Hemidesmosomes are classified into two types: types I and II. Type I is mainly observed in keratinocytes in the skin, whereas type II is in intestinal epithelial cells. It was also reported that integrin α6β4 physically and functionally interacts with ErbB2, causing the enhancement of ErbB2 signaling for cell proliferation and motility (17Falcioni R. Antonini A.

Furthermore, our recent finding suggests that ErbB3, but not ErbB2, interacts in cis with integrin α6β4, implicating heregulin-induced ErbB3/ErbB2-mediated DNA synthesis (20Kawano S. Mizutani K. Miyata M. Ikeda W. Takai Y. Genes Cells. 2010; 15: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Hemidesmosomes play roles in keeping epithelial cell morphology and inhibiting cell movement. The extracellular region of integrin α6β4 preferentially binds to laminin-332, a major component of epithelial basement membrane, whereas the cytoplasmic region of integrin β4 directly interacts with plectin and associates with keratin intermediate filaments. The formation of hemidesmosomes by laminin-332 and integrin α6β4 mediates stable cell-ECM anchorage, which enables the cells to resist mechanical stresses (21Borradori L. Sonnenberg A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 411-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In many types of cancer cells, integrin α6β4 is up-regulated, laminin is cleaved, and hemidesmosomes are disrupted, eventually causing an enhancement of cancer cell movement and a facilitation of their invasion (22Mercurio A.M. Rabinovitz I. Shaw L.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar).

Recombinant human laminin-332 was obtained from Oriental Yeast Company (Tokyo, Japan). pAcGFP1-Mem plasmid was purchased from Clontech. Caco-2 cells were purchased from the European Collection of Cell Cultures and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids. HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. All cells were maintained in culture at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with various combinations of plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacture's protocol. HEK293 cells cultured for 48 h were detached with 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA, and then treated with a trypsin inhibitor. Cells were cultured in suspension with DMEM containing 0.5% fatty acid-free BSA for 30 min, collected by centrifugation, washed with wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm Na3VO4), and lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm (p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride, and phosphatase inhibitor mixture I). The lysates were rotated at 4 °C for 30 min and subjected to centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was pre-cleared with protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads at 4 °C for 1 h. The anti-FLAG M2 mAb was preincubated with protein G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 2 h. The cell extracts were incubated with the anti-FLAG M2 mAb-conjugated protein G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 4 h. After the beads were extensively washed with the lysis buffer, bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 3% SDS, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol) for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting using the indicated Abs. Stealth RNAi duplexes against human Necl-2 and human integrin β4 and a stealth RNAi negative control duplex were purchased from Invitrogen.

Transfection of cells with siRNA was performed using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell adhesion assay was performed as described with a slight modification (24Honoré S. Pichard V. Penel C. Rigot V. Prévôt C. Marvaldi J. Briand C. Rognoni J.B. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 114: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well plates were coated at 4 °C overnight with laminin-332 or Matrigel and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were harvested by treating with 0.53 mm EDTA in PBS and were collected by centrifugation. The collected cells were rinsed in an ice-cold adhesion buffer (DMEM containing 15 mm HEPES and 0.2% BSA). After washing with the adhesion buffer, the cells were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells per well and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells attached to the dish were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.2% crystal violet in 1% ethanol solution. After extensive washing in water, the plates were dried overnight. Crystal violet was extracted by incubating the plates with 0.1 m sodium citrate in 50% ethanol for 15 min, after which absorbance at 595 nm was measured as an indicator of the numbers of cells attached. Cells were seeded onto coverslips coated with a thin layer of Matrigel or onto coverslips coated with laminin-332. For TPA stimulation, the medium was replaced with a fresh medium containing 50 ng/ml TPA. After indicated time periods, the cells were fixed with acetone/methanol (1:1) on ice for 1 min, followed by incubation with 20% BlockAce (Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma) in PBS. The samples were then incubated with primary Abs, followed by incubation with appropriate fluorophore-conjugated secondary Abs. The samples were then washed three times with PBS and mounted in Prolong Gold mount gel (Invitrogen). Fluorescence signals were visualized by a confocal laser scanning microscopy (Digital Eclipse C1si-ready, Nikon). Epithelial cells abundantly express integrin α6β4, α5β1, and α6β1 (25Schoenenberger C.A. Zuk A. Zinkl G.M. Kendall D. Matlin K.S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 527-541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lussier C. Basora N. Bouatrouss Y. Beaulieu J.F. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 51: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We first examined whether Necl-2 interacts with these integrins. FLAG-tagged Necl-2 (FLAG-Necl-2) or FLAG alone together with integrin α6β4, α5β1, or α6β1 were co-expressed in HEK293 cells, and the cells were cultured in suspension. The suspension culture of HEK293 cells enabled the detection of a possible cis-interaction between Necl-2 and integrins on the plasma membrane. When FLAG-Necl-2 was immunoprecipitated from each cell lysate using the anti-FLAG mAb, integrin α6β4 was co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 1A, panel a). When integrin β4 was precipitated from the lysates of HEK293 cells expressing integrin α6β4 and FLAG-Necl-2, FLAG-Necl-2 was co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 1A, panel b). Integrin α5β1 or α6β1 was not co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-Necl-2 (Fig. 1, B and C). These results indicate that Necl-2 specifically interacts in cis with integrin α6β4. We then examined whether the extracellular region and/or the cytoplasmic region of Necl-2 are necessary for the interaction with integrin α6β4. The mutants of FLAG-Necl-2 in which the cytoplasmic region or the extracellular region was deleted (FLAG-Necl-2-ΔCP or FLAG-Necl-2-ΔEC, respectively) and integrin α6β4 were co-expressed in HEK293 cells. Integrin α6β4 was co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-Necl-2-ΔCP, but not with FLAG-Necl-2-ΔEC (Fig. 2, A and B). The amount of integrin α6β4 that was co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-Necl-2-ΔCP was about four times as much as that co-immunoprecipitated with the full-length FLAG-Necl-2 (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that Necl-2 interacts in cis with integrin α6β4 through its extracellular region and that the cytoplasmic region may have an inhibitory effect for the interaction of the extracellular region of Necl-2 with integrin α6β4. Necl-2 is a member of the Necl family, which consists of five members. We therefore examined whether other members of Necl family proteins also interact with integrin α6β4. FLAG-tagged members of this family were co-expressed with integrin α6β4 in HEK293 cells, and a similar co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed. Integrin α6β4 was co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-Necl-1 and -4 in addition to FLAG-Necl-2 (Fig. 3A). Integrin α6β4 was also co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-Necl-3 and -5, but to lesser extents than with Necl-1, -2, and -4 (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that integrin α6β4 interacts broadly with the members of the Necl family. To clarify subcellular localization of integrin α6β4, we stained human adenocarcinoma Caco-2 epithelial cells cultured on Matrigel using specific Abs against integrin α6 and integrin β4 and analyzed by a confocal microscopy. The streaky immunofluorescence signals for integrin α6 and integrin β4 were observed at the cell-ECM adhesion levels in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 4A). This signal for integrin α6 disappeared when integrin β4 was knocked down by its siRNA (Fig. 4B). Marked reduction of integrin β4 protein expression was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that the integrin α6β4-dependent structure most likely corresponds to hemidesmosomes in Caco-2 cells. To confirm that Necl-2 and integrin α6β4 are in a common complex in Caco-2 cells cultured on Matrigel, we stained the cells using the Abs against Necl-2 and integrin β4. The immunofluorescence signal for Necl-2 was predominantly concentrated at the lateral plasma membrane of the cells (Fig. 5). The signal for integrin β4 was concentrated both at the hemidesmosome-like structure of the cell-ECM adhesion site and at the basal side of the lateral plasma membrane, where the signal for integrin β4 was partly overlapped with that for Necl-2 (Fig. 5). These results, together with the results presented above (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3), indicate that Necl-2 and integrin α6β4 are at least in part in a common complex in Caco-2 cells. The tumor-promoting phorbol ester TPA was shown to induce the disassembly of integrin α6β4 from hemidesmosomes in A431 cells (27Rabinovitz I. Toker A. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1147-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We observed that the hemidesmosome-like structure visualized by the anti-integrin α6 antibody were disappeared when Caco-2 cells cultured on Matrigel were incubated with TPA, indicating that TPA induces disassembly of integrin α6β4 from the hemidesmosome-like structure in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 6, A, panel a, and B). We then examined the effect of Necl-2 on the TPA-induced disruption of the hemidesmosome-like structure in Caco-2 cells. We analyzed a time course of the TPA-induced disruption of the hemidesmosome-like structure. In the absence of TPA, the percentage of the hemidesmosome-positive cells in number were similar among the control, Necl-2 knockdown, and Necl-2-overexpressing Caco-2 cells, suggesting that expression levels of Necl-2 did not affect the formation of the hemidesmosome-like structure. However, Necl-2 knockdown significantly enhanced the TPA-induced disruption of the hemidesmosome-like structure (Fig. 6, A, panel b, and B), whereas overexpression of Necl-2 clearly delayed the disruption process (Fig. 6, A, panel c, and B). The expression level of Necl-2 was decreased in Necl-2 knockdown cells and increased in Necl-2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 6C). Taken together, these results indicate that Necl-2 inhibits the disassembly of integrin α6β4 from the hemidesmosome-like structure. To test whether initial integrin-ECM cell attachment ability is altered by the difference of Necl-2 expression levels, we performed a cell adhesion assay by using laminin-332 or Matrigel as an ECM. When the same numbers of wild-type, Necl-2 knockdown, and Necl-2-overexoressing Caco-2 cells were allowed to attach onto laminin-332-coated plates, similar numbers of the cells were attached (Fig. 7). Similar results were obtained when the cells were allowed to attach onto Matrigel-coated plates. Taken together, these results indicate that the expression level of Necl-2 does not affect the initial cell attachment ability. To confirm that the Necl-2-dependent inhibitory effect of hemidesmosome disassembly could also be observed with Caco-2 cells cultured on laminin-332, we performed the similar TPA-induced hemidesmosome disassembly experiments using laminin-332 as an ECM. Similar to that observed with Caco-2 cells cultured on Matrigel, Necl-2 knockdown significantly enhanced the TPA-induced disruption of the hemidesmosome-like structure, whereas overexpression of Necl-2 clearly delayed the disruption process (Fig. 8). These results, together with the results of Fig. 6, indicate that Necl-2 inhibits the disassembly of integrin α6β4 from the hemidesmosome-like structure. We previously showed that Necl-2 interacts in cis with ErbB3, but not with ErbB2, and inhibits the heregulin-induced activation of the ErbB3/ErbB2 signaling (14Kawano S. Ikeda W. Kishimoto M. Ogita H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 23793-23805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, we showed that ErbB3, but not ErbB2, interacts in cis with integrin α6β4, although it had been shown that ErbB2 interacts with integrin α6β4 (20Kawano S. Mizutani K. Miyata M. Ikeda W. Takai Y. Genes Cells. 2010; 15: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We showed here that Necl-2 interacts with integrin α6β4. These two molecules is likely to interact with each other in cis because the co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed using suspended HEK293 cells, which did not contact with each other. The interaction of Necl-2 with integrin α6β4 is specific because it does not interact with integrin α6β1 or α5β1. We further showed here that the extracellular region of Necl-2 binds to the extracellular region of integrin α6β4. Although the cytoplasmic region of Necl-2 is not required for this interaction, it may suppress the interaction of the extracellular region of Necl-2 with integrin α6β4 because deletion of the cytoplasmic region strongly increased the affinity of Necl-2 with integrin α6β4. Each Necl family member consists of ∼400 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 42.8–48.5 kDa. It was reported that Necl family members show an upward mobility shift by N-glycosylation (28Fogel A.I. Akins M.R. Krupp A.J. Stagi M. Stein V. Biederer T. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 12516-12530Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, transiently expressed Necl family members in HEK293 cells showed similar upward mobility shift (Fig. 3A). Therefore, the wide spectrum of recombinant Necl family members is attributable to the difference of N-glycosylation between the Necl family members. Integrin α6β4 is abundantly expressed in normal epithelial cells and forms hemidesmosomes, which play key roles in keeping epithelial cell morphology and inhibiting cell movement (16Wilhelmsen K. Litjens S.H. Sonnenberg A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 2877-2886Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In Caco-2 epithelial cells, integrin β4 is predominantly localized at the cell-matrix adhesion and co-localized with integrin α6. The signal for integrin α6 disappeared from the basal region of integrin β4 knockdown Caco-2 cells, indicating that the integrin α6β4-dependent structure most likely corresponds to hemidesmosomes in Caco-2 cells. We previously showed that the immunogold particles for Necl-2 were concentrated at the basolateral plasma membrane of the epithelial cells of gall bladder (3Shingai T. Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Morimoto K. Takekuni K. Itoh S. Satoh K. Takeuchi M. Imai T. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Biol.

Histochem Cytochem. 2009; 57: 123-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) showed that integrin β4 localized not only at the hemidesmosomes but also at the lateral filopodic cell-cell adhesion sites of keratinocytes. Although the tissue types analyzed were different, these results suggest a possibility of the co-localization of Necl-2 with integrin α6β4 in vivo and are consistent with our present finding that Necl-2 and integrin α6β4 are at least in part in a common complex in Caco-2 cells. Not only integrins but also ECMs play important roles in the formation of cell-ECM adhesions, such as hemidesmosomes, focal complexes, and focal adhesions. Matrigel is one of the widely used basement membrane substrate because it was reported that it is composed of laminin as a major component, followed by collagen IV, heparan sulfate proteoglycans, entactin/nidogen, resembling the ECM found in many tissues (30Kleinman H.K. McGarvey M.L. Liotta L.A. Robey P.G. Tryggvason K. Martin G.R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6188-6193Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 31Kleinman H.K. McGarvey M.L. Hassell J.R. Star V.L. Cannon F.B. Laurie G.W. Martin G.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). Among laminins, laminin-332 is a major component of the epithelial basement membrane and a main ligand of integrin α6β4 (21Borradori L. Sonnenberg A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 411-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In the cell adhesion assay, the same numbers of the control, Necl-2 knockdown, and Necl-2-overexpressing cells attached onto laminin-332-coated plates and Matrigel-coated plates. We did not observe any gain or loss of initial cell attachment abilities among these cell types, suggesting that it is unlikely that Necl-2 modifies the initial cell attachment ability. When Caco-2 cells were stimulated with the tumor-promoting phorbol ester TPA, disassembly of the hemidesmosome-like structure was observed in a time-dependent manner, consistent with an earlier observation in A431 cells (27Rabinovitz I. Toker A. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1147-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Moreover, knockdown of Necl-2 accelerated this hemidesmosome-like structure disassembly, whereas overexpression of Necl-2 delayed the disassembly process. In the absence of TPA, there was no difference in hemidesmosome-positive cell ratio among the control, Necl-2-overexpressing, and Necl-2 knockdown Caco-2 cells, suggesting that Necl-2 specifically plays an important role in the inhibition of the TPA-induced hemidesmosome disassembly. Co-localization of Necl-2 with integrin β4 was mainly observed at the basal side of the lateral plasma membrane, indicating that Necl-2 forms a complex with integrin α6β4 at this region and inhibits the TPA-induced hemidesmosome disassembly. We presented the role of Necl-2 in hemidesmosome regulation, but further studies are required to improve our understanding of the underlying mechanism. One possible mechanism predicted at this time is that tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme is involved in this process. There are several studies showing that TPA treatment of cells induces tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme activation, followed by extracellular domain cleavage of membrane proteins, such as amyloid precursor protein, ErbB4, and nectin-1 (32Buxbaum J.D. Liu K.N. Luo Y. Slack J.L. Stocking K.L. Peschon J.J. Johnson R.S. Castner B.J. Cerretti D.P. Black R.A. J. Biol.

Commun. 2002; 299: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition to these substrates, both Necl-2 and integrin β4 are also cleaved by tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme (36Tanabe Y. Kasahara T. Momoi T. Fujita E. Neurosci. Lett. 2008; 444: 16-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 37Pal-Ghosh S. Blanco T. Tadvalkar G. Pajoohesh-Ganji A. Parthasarathy A. Zieske J.D. Stepp M.A. J. Cell Sci. 2011; 124: 2666-2675Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It is possible that the cleavage of integrin β4 by tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme is competitively inhibited by the binding of Necl-2 to integrin β4. Abundant expression of Necl-2 delays the integrin β4 cleavage, and down-regulation of Necl-2 has an opposite effect. This possibility is in agreement with our findings that overexpression of Necl-2 delayed the TPA-induced hemidesmosome disassembly, whereas knockdown of Necl-2 enhanced it. In addition, it is also important to investigate whether overexpression of other Necl family members gives the same effect on the TPA-induced hemidesmosome disassembly, as was observed in Necl-2-overexpressing cells. The effect of Necl-2 overexpression in cultured human keratinocytes have been reported by Giangreco et al. (38Giangreco A. Jensen K.B. Takai Y. Miyoshi J. Watt F.M. Development. 2009; 136: 3505-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). They showed that overexpression of Necl-2 led to the up-regulation of the calcium/calmodulin-associated Ser/Thr kinase, increased calcium-independent intercellular adhesion, and inhibition of both cell motility and in vitro wound healing. Although they did not mention data regarding the difference of the hemidesmosome structure between the wild-type and Necl-2-overexpressing keratinocytes, inhibition of cell motility observed by Necl-2 overexpression could be partly explained by our findings of the Necl-2-dependent inhibitory effect of hemidesmosome disassembly. Thus, our findings could be applicable to epithelial cells expressing and forming classical hemidesmosomes. In many types of cancer cells, integrin α6β4 is up-regulated and hemidesmosomes are disrupted, eventually causing an enhancement of cancer cell movement (22Mercurio A.M. Rabinovitz I. Shaw L.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Thus, hemidesmosome disassembly is thought to be a critical process for the initiation of tumor invasion and metastasis. Necl-2 was identified as a tumor suppressor in human non-small cell lung cancer cell line (5Kuramochi M. Fukuhara H. Nobukuni T. Kanbe T. Maruyama T. Ghosh H.P. Pletcher M. Isomura M. Onizuka M. Kitamura T. Sekiya T. Reeves R.H. Murakami Y. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), and we previously showed that Necl-2 regulates the heregulin-induced signaling pathways of the ErbB3/ErbB2 heterodimer for cell movement and survival (14Kawano S. Ikeda W. Kishimoto M. Ogita H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 23793-23805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Hemidesmosomes in tumor cells, in which Necl-2 is down-regulated, might be easily disassembled; therefore, stable cell-ECM adhesion is lost, and the cells are released from the basement membrane, leading to tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Our finding of the inhibitory effect of Necl-2 on hemidesmosome disassembly will explain another mechanism for the tumor suppressive role of Necl-2. We previously showed that Necl-5, another Necl family member, physically and functionally interacts with integrin αvβ3 and PDGF receptor and enhances the formation of a leading edge structure, such as lamellipodia, peripheral ruffles, focal complexes, and focal adhesions, in response to PDGF (39Minami Y.

We also showed that Necl-5 enhanced the PDGF-induced growth of microtubules and attracted them near the plasma membrane of the leading edge of NIH3T3 cells in an integrin αvβ3-dependent manner (42Minami A. Mizutani K. Waseda M. Kajita M. Miyata M. Ikeda W. Takai Y. Genes Cells. 2010; 15: 1123-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The function of Necl-2 described here is opposite to that of Necl-5, which is overexpressed in many human cancer cells (43Gromeier M. Lachmann S. Rosenfeld M.R. Gutin P.H. Wimmer E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6803-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 44Masson D. Jarry A. Baury B. Blanchardie P. Laboisse C. Lustenberger P. Denis M.G.

BMC Cancer. 2004; 4: 73Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Although both molecules interacts in cis with their specific integrins and growth factor receptors, Necl-2 suppresses hemidesmosome disassembly, preventing cell detachment from the basement membrane, whereas Necl-5 enhances cell movement and survival, characteristics of the metastatic cancer cells (39Minami Y. Ikeda W. Kajita M. Fujito T. Amano H. Tamaru Y. Kuramitsu K. Sakamoto Y. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Biol.

In certain physiological and pathological conditions, such as embryonic development and cancer progression, cells lose their connection to neighboring cells or the basement membrane and become free, which increases the likelihood for migration and proliferation. This phenomenon is called epithelial-mesenchymal transition (46Gumbiner B.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 622-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). Necl-2 is abundantly expressed in epithelial cells but is not expressed in fibroblasts, whereas Necl-5 is the opposite. Therefore, it is likely that down-regulation of Necl-2 and up-regulation of Necl-5 during epithelial-mesenchymal transition leads to an enhancement of cell movement. We thank Drs. A. Sonnenberg and J. C. Norman for generous gifts of reagents."
https://openalex.org/W2032351323,"EAF2, an androgen-regulated protein, interacts with members of the ELL (eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukemia) transcription factor family and also acts as a tumor suppressor. Although these proteins control transcriptional elongation and perhaps modulate the effects of other transcription factors, the mechanisms of their actions remain largely unknown. To gain new insights into the biology of the EAF2 and ELL family proteins, we used Caenorhabditis elegans as a model to explore the in vivo roles of their worm orthologs. Through the use of transgenic worms, RNAi, and an eaf-1 mutant, we found that both genes are expressed in multiple cell types throughout the worm life cycle and that they play important roles in fertility, survival, and body size regulation. ELL-1 and EAF-1 likely contribute to these activities in part through modulating cuticle synthesis, given that we observed a disrupted cuticle structure in ell-1 RNAi-treated or eaf-1 mutant worms. Consistent with disruption of cuticle structure, loss of either ELL-1 or EAF-1 suppressed the rol phenotype of specific collagen mutants, possibly through the control of dpy-3, dpy-13, and sqt-3 collagen gene expression. Furthermore, we also noted the regulation of collagen expression by ELL overexpression in PC3 human prostate cancer cells. Together, these results reveal important roles for the eaf-1 and ell-1 genes in the regulation of extracellular matrix components."
https://openalex.org/W2078640994,"Apart from its role in insulin receptor (IR) activation, the C terminus of the B-chain of insulin is also responsible for the formation of insulin dimers. The dimerization of insulin plays an important role in the endogenous delivery of the hormone and in the administration of insulin to patients. Here, we investigated insulin analogues with selective N-methylations of peptide bond amides at positions B24, B25, or B26 to delineate their structural and functional contribution to the dimer interface. All N-methylated analogues showed impaired binding affinities to IR, which suggests a direct IR-interacting role for the respective amide hydrogens. The dimerization capabilities of analogues were investigated by isothermal microcalorimetry. Selective N-methylations of B24, B25, or B26 amides resulted in reduced dimerization abilities compared with native insulin (K(d) = 8.8 μM). Interestingly, although the N-methylation in [NMeTyrB26]-insulin or [NMePheB24]-insulin resulted in K(d) values of 142 and 587 μM, respectively, the [NMePheB25]-insulin did not form dimers even at high concentrations. This effect may be attributed to the loss of intramolecular hydrogen bonding between NHB25 and COA19, which connects the B-chain β-strand to the core of the molecule. The release of the B-chain β-strand from this hydrogen bond lock may result in its higher mobility, thereby shifting solution equilibrium toward the monomeric state of the hormone. The study was complemented by analyses of two novel analogue crystal structures. All examined analogues crystallized only in the most stable R(6) form of insulin oligomers (even if the dimer interface was totally disrupted), confirming the role of R(6)-specific intra/intermolecular interactions for hexamer stability."
https://openalex.org/W2114234626,"Regulator of G protein Signaling 14 (RGS14) is a multifunctional scaffolding protein that integrates both conventional and unconventional G protein signaling pathways. Like other RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) proteins, RGS14 acts as a GTPase accelerating protein to terminate conventional Gα(i/o) signaling. However, unlike other RGS proteins, RGS14 also contains a G protein regulatory/GoLoco motif that specifically binds Gα(i1/3)-GDP in cells and in vitro. The non-receptor guanine nucleotide exchange factor Ric-8A can bind and act on the RGS14·Gα(i1)-GDP complex to play a role in unconventional G protein signaling independent of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Here we demonstrate that RGS14 forms a Gα(i/o)-dependent complex with a G(i)-linked GPCR and that this complex is regulated by receptor agonist and Ric-8A (resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase-8A). Using live cell bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, we show that RGS14 functionally associates with the α(2A)-adrenergic receptor (α(2A)-AR) in a Gα(i/o)-dependent manner. This interaction is markedly disrupted after receptor stimulation by the specific agonist UK14304, suggesting complex dissociation or rearrangement. Agonist-mediated dissociation of the RGS14·α(2A)-AR complex occurs in the presence of Gα(i/o) but not Gα(s) or Gα(q). Unexpectedly, RGS14 does not dissociate from Gα(i1) in the presence of stimulated α(2A)-AR, suggesting preservation of RGS14·Gα(i1) complexes after receptor activation. However, Ric-8A facilitates dissociation of both the RGS14·Gα(i1) complex and the Gα(i1)-dependent RGS14·α(2A)-AR complex after receptor activation. Together, these findings indicate that RGS14 can form complexes with GPCRs in cells that are dependent on Gα(i/o) and that these RGS14·Gα(i1)·GPCR complexes may be substrates for other signaling partners such as Ric-8A."
https://openalex.org/W1968897791,"Structured RNAs traverse complex energy landscapes that include valleys representing misfolded intermediates. In Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, efficient splicing of mitochondrial group I and II introns requires the DEAD box proteins CYT-19 and Mss116p, respectively, which promote folding transitions and function as general RNA chaperones. To test the generality of RNA misfolding and the activities of DEAD box proteins in vitro, here we measure native folding of a small group I intron ribozyme from the bacterium Azoarcus by monitoring its catalytic activity. To develop this assay, we first measure cleavage of an oligonucleotide substrate by the prefolded ribozyme. Substrate cleavage is rate-limited by binding and is readily reversible, with an internal equilibrium near unity, such that the amount of product observed is less than the amount of native ribozyme. We use this assay to show that approximately half of the ribozyme folds readily to the native state, whereas the other half forms an intermediate that transitions slowly to the native state. This folding transition is accelerated by urea and increased temperature and slowed by increased Mg(2+) concentration, suggesting that the intermediate is misfolded and must undergo transient unfolding during refolding to the native state. CYT-19 and Mss116p accelerate refolding in an ATP-dependent manner, presumably by disrupting structure in the intermediate. These results highlight the tendency of RNAs to misfold, underscore the roles of CYT-19 and Mss116p as general RNA chaperones, and identify a refolding transition for further dissection of the roles of DEAD box proteins in RNA folding."
https://openalex.org/W2024465488,"The human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes produces diverse pili depending on the serotype. We investigated the assembly mechanism of FCT type 1 pili in a serotype M6 strain. The pili were found to be assembled from two precursor proteins, the backbone protein T6 and ancillary protein FctX, and anchored to the cell wall in a manner that requires both a housekeeping sortase enzyme (SrtA) and pilus-associated sortase enzyme (SrtB). SrtB is primarily required for efficient formation of the T6 and FctX complex and subsequent polymerization of T6, whereas proper anchoring of the pili to the cell wall is mainly mediated by SrtA. Because motifs essential for polymerization of pilus backbone proteins in other Gram-positive bacteria are not present in T6, we sought to identify the functional residues involved in this process. Our results showed that T6 encompasses the novel VAKS pilin motif conserved in streptococcal T6 homologues and that the lysine residue (Lys-175) within the motif and cell wall sorting signal of T6 are prerequisites for isopeptide linkage of T6 molecules. Because Lys-175 and the cell wall sorting signal of FctX are indispensable for substantial incorporation of FctX into the T6 pilus shaft, FctX is suggested to be located at the pilus tip, which was also implied by immunogold electron microscopy findings. Thus, the elaborate assembly of FCT type 1 pili is potentially organized by sortase-mediated cross-linking between sorting signals and the amino group of Lys-175 positioned in the VAKS motif of T6, thereby displaying T6 and FctX in a temporospatial manner.

The biphenyl dioxygenase system critically determines which of the 209 PCB congeners can be metabolized by each strain. For example, a recent study showed that the biphenyl dioxygenase of strain B-356 metabolizes 2,6-dichlorobiphenyl, 4,4′-dichlorobiphenyl, and 2,4,4′-trichlorobiphenyl, whereas the biphenyl dioxygenase of strain LB400 metabolizes these congeners poorly. On the other hand, strain BPDOB-356 is unable to catalyze the meta-para oxygenation of 2,2′,5,5′-tetrachlorobiphenyl, whereas BPDOLB400 catalyzes it efficiently. The versatility of BphB toward BPDO metabolites of PCB congeners has not been thoroughly investigated (12Gómez-Gil L. Kumar P. Barriault D. Bolin J.T. Sylvestre M. Eltis L.D. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5705-5715Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A previous report, however, showed that both BphBLB400 and BphBB-356 are able to oxidize 3,4-dihydro-3,4-dihydroxy-2,2′,5,5′-tetrachlorobiphenyl, the product resulting from the metabolism of 2,2′,5,5′-tetrachlorobiphenyl by BPDOLB400 (13Barriault D. Vedadi M. Powlowski J. Sylvestre M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, the ability of BphBB-356 to metabolize the product generated from 2,6-dichlorobiphenyl or 2,4,4′-trichlorobiphenyl has never been examined. But recently it has been shown that the dihydrodiol dehydrogenase from Sphingomonas sp. strain CHY-1 can oxidize a wide range of polyaromatic hydrocarbon dihydrodiols (14Jouanneau Y. Meyer C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 4726-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). BphB occurs as a homotetramer comprised of 29.4-kDa subunits. It is an NAD+-dependent oxidoreductase, related to other cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenases involved in aromatic degradation pathways and belongs to a very large family of short-chain dehydrogenase (the SDR family) (15Jörnvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzàlez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar, 16Sylvestre M. Hurtubise Y. Barriault D. Bergeron J. Ahmad D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 2710-2715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although, the crystal structure of the NAD+-bound form of BphBLB400 is known (17Hülsmeyer M. Hecht H.J. Niefind K. Hofer B. Eltis L.D. Timmis K.N. Schomburg D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1286-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), there is no structure available with bound substrate, product, or any product analogs. Furthermore, the substrate binding loop in the published structure of BphBLB400 is disordered (17Hülsmeyer M. Hecht H.J. Niefind K. Hofer B. Eltis L.D. Timmis K.N. Schomburg D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1286-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, the structural features involved in substrate binding of the cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenases from the aromatic degradation pathways are still undetermined. To get more insight into the binding mode of the ligand with BphB, we have compared the crystal structure of the apo form of BphBB-356 with that of its NAD+-bound form (binary state) or of its ternary complex with its coenzyme-NAD+ and its product (2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl) or a product analog (4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl). In addition, we also describe a structure showing an intermediate state of the substrate binding loop. These three-dimensional structures provide insight to the binding mode of ligand with the enzyme. We were able to identify the series of conformational changes in the substrate binding loop that occur during ligand binding. Additionally, our docking studies are consistent with the biochemical experiments that examine the ability of BphBB-356 to metabolize and accommodate a large range of chlorinated substrates. Purification, crystallization, and preliminary x-ray diffraction properties of BphBB-356 have been reported earlier (18Patil D.N. Tomar S. Sylvestre M. Kumar P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 1517-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In brief, crystallization conditions for BphBB-356 were screened initially using commercial kits by Hampton Research (Hampton Research Inc., Aliso Viejo, CA). We were able to obtain good diffracting crystals in 0.2 m sodium malonate (pH 6.5) buffer containing 10–36% (w/v) PEG-3350. Diffraction data for crystals of substrate-free and NAD+-bound forms of the enzyme were collected on an in-house x-ray setup. Before data collection, the protein crystals were cryoprotected by direct transfer to the mother liquor drop containing 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol as a cryoprotectant. Crystals of the BphBB-356-NAD+ complex were prepared by soaking protein crystals for 15 min at room temperature in a solution comprised of 22% (w/v) PEG-3350, 0.2 m sodium malonate, and 10 mm NAD+. Diffraction data were collected under cryogenic conditions (∼100 K). Protein crystals were also soaked (for 50 s to 15 min) with 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl (23-DB), the reaction product in the same solution. Similar procedures were used to soak the 4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl (44-DB), a product analog. 2,3-Dihydroxybiphenyl and 4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl were from Sigma and Himedia Laboratories Pvt. Ltd., respectively. Data for these crystals were collected at a synchrotron radiation source, ESRF Grenoble, at beamline 14. All the crystals that were used for soaking experiments were grown under similar conditions as that of the apocrystals. For all crystal structures, the diffraction data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL2000 program suite (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). Initial phases for BphBB-356 were obtained by molecular replacement using MOLREP from the CCP4 version 6.0 software suite (20Collaborative Computational Project, NActa Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of BphBLB400 was used as a search model (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1BDB) (21Berman H.M. Battistuz T. Bhat T.N. Bluhm W.F. Bourne P.E. Burkhardt K. Feng Z. Gilliland G.L.

Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). Rigid body refinement was followed by iterative cycles of restrained atomic parameter refinement using the programs CNS (22Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar). The program COOT was used for analysis of electron density maps and model building (24Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23389) Google Scholar). The difference Fourier map for the NAD+-bound form of BphBB-356 clearly showed density for the NAD+ at above the 3σ level, allowing NAD+ to be modeled into the density. Solvent molecules were added where the Fo − Fc map had values above 3σ and the 2Fo − 2Fc map showed a density at the 1σ level. Several cycles of rigid-body refinement and then restrained refinement were used to achieve acceptable Rcryst and Rfree. Stereochemical properties of the models were evaluated using the program PROCHECK (25Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Figures were prepared using the program PyMOL (26DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. Schrödinger, LLC, New York2002Google Scholar). Molecular docking of all the substrates was carried out using the Schrödinger, Maestro suite, version 9.1 (Glide, version 2.6, Schrodinger, Inc., New York). The protein was prepared using the Maestro protein preparation wizard by addition of hydrogens, assigning the bond orders, and minimization of the protein using the OPLS2001 force-field until the r.m.s. deviation between the minimized structure and the starting structure reached 0.3 Å. All substrates were prepared using the Maestro Ligprep module (Ligprep, Schrodinger, Inc.). A receptor grid for docking was generated by the centroids of the selected residues, Ser-142, Tyr-155, Lys-159, Gly-150, Asn-149, and the NAD+ molecule. These residues and the NAD+ form the active site of the protein (27Vedadi M. Barriault D. Sylvestre M. Powlowski J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5028-5034Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Glide was then used for docking the substrates using the Extra Precision (XP) mode. The best conformation was selected on the basis of Glide score and by visually inspecting the molecule (28Friesner R.A. Murphy R.B. Repasky M.P. Frye L.L. Greenwood J.R. Halgren T.A. Sanschagrin P.C. Mainz D.T. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 6177-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar). Metabolites from 2,6-dichlorobiphenyl, 2,4,4′-trichlorobiphenyl, and 3,3′-dichlorobiphenyl (all 99% pure, from Ultra Scientific, Kingstown, RI) were analyzed according to a previously published protocol from suspensions of isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside-induced Escherichia coli DH11S pDB31[LB400-bphFG] harboring pQE31[B-356-bphAE] or a mixture containing equal amounts of isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside-induced E. coli DH11S pDB31[LB400-bphFG] harboring pQE31[B-356-bphAE] plus isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside-induced E. coli DH11S pQE31[B-356-bphB] (29Barriault D. Plante M.M. Sylvestre M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3794-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the case of 2,6-dichlorobiphenyl, pQE31[B-356-bphAE] was replaced by pQE31[p4-bphAE]. The level of expression was assessed by inspection of SDS-PAGE gels. Metabolites were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of their butylboronate derivatives (29Barriault D. Plante M.M. Sylvestre M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3794-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The accession codes used are 2Y93 (BphBB-356 apo-structure), 2Y99 (BphBB-356-NAD+ complex), 3ZV6 (BphBB-356-NAD+-4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl complex), 3ZV5 (BphBB-356-NAD+-2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl complex), and 3ZV3 (BphBB-356 intermediate structure). The structures of the ligand-free form of BphBB-356 (apo), the binary complex with NAD+, and the ternary complex with NAD+ and product (23-DB) or product analog (44-DB) were determined.

Open table in a new tab The refined model of the ligand-free BphBB-356 includes residues from Met1 to Gly198 and Ser206 to Ile275 in both subunits. This model lacks seven residues from 199 to 205, which form a loop at the mouth of the active site (the substrate binding loop) and six residues from the C-terminal due to insufficient interpretable electron density. The structure of the BphBB-356-NAD+ complex was determined at 2.5 Å resolution. An NAD+ moiety was clearly visible in the initial difference Fourier maps in each subunit. Binding of NAD+ at the coenzyme binding site and near the substrate binding site required only local structural adjustment and thus, did not alter the overall conformation of BphBB-356. The loop region from Leu199 to Ser205 is disordered in this binary structure also. The structures of the ternary complexes of BphBB-356 with NAD+ and 23-DB and BphBB-356 with NAD+ and 44-DB were obtained at 2.4 and 2.1 Å, respectively. Difference Fourier maps distinctly showed the presence of NAD+ in both structures. Additionally, in both structures extra electron density was present at the active site near the nicotinamide ring of NAD+. This density was due to the presence of 23-DB and 44-DB, respectively. Surprisingly, for both ternary structures the electron density was clearly visible for the entire substrate binding loop from Thr187 to Val216. Thus, the disordered region (Leu199 to Ser205) in the ligand-free form and binary complex was ordered in the ternary complexes. The refined models contain two molecules per asymmetric unit for both ternary complexes. BphBB-356 exists as a tetramer made up of two asymmetric units. The tetrameric state of BphBB-356 was also confirmed by gel filtration chromatography. The two monomers in an asymmetric unit are related to each other by a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis. As per the conventional nomenclature of SDR enzymes, the subunit contacts are named based on the three perpendicular axes P, Q, and R along the tetrameric arrangement of monomers (30Rossmann M.G. Adams M.J. Buehner M. Ford G.C. Hackert M.L. Liljas A. Rao S.T. Banaszak L.J. Hill E. Tsernoglou D. Webb L. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 76: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In BphBB-356, the monomers in an asymmetric unit coincide by the P axis. The two monomers along this axis interact through their respective α8 helix and β7 sheet as shown in Fig. 2B. The contacts between the two vicinal helices occur principally through hydrophobic interactions involving Phe234 and Phe235 from each subunit. Between β7 sheets, no direct interaction is seen and most of the interactions are mediated through water molecules. The overall structure of the BphBB-356 monomer is similar to the previously reported structure of BphBLB400 (17Hülsmeyer M. Hecht H.J. Niefind K. Hofer B. Eltis L.D. Timmis K.N. Schomburg D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1286-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It can be divided into three parts: the main body (Met1-Gly186 and Leu217-Tyr251) arranged in a α/β folding pattern, consisting of a dinucleotide binding motif called the Rossmann-fold, the substrate binding loop (Met187-Val216), and the C-terminal region (Asp252-Ile275). BphBB-356 monomer displays a highly similar α/β folding pattern, consisting of a dinucleotide binding motif comprised of a central β-sheet flanked by α-helices. The central unit is made up of seven core parallel β-sheets (residues 7–11(β1), 31–36(β2), 53–57(β3), 82–84(β4), 136–140(β5), 178–184(β6), and 248–251(β7)) buried between six α-helices, three on each side α8(230–236), α1(15–28), α2(39–48) and α3(63–77), α5(115–133), α6(153–173) as shown in Fig. 2, A and C. The two helices, αa and αb, and turn βa protrude out of the main body. The region between sheet β6 and helix α8 is the substrate binding region and corresponds to the disordered region (Leu199-Ser205) in the structures of the apoenzyme and binary complex. The C-terminal region consists of a loop and a small helix oriented above the α5 and α6 helices of the vicinal molecule in the asymmetric unit as shown in Fig. 2B. For each subunit, Gly265, Gly266, and Ala267 of the C-terminal region interacts with Phe171, Ala174, and His176, respectively, located on helix α6 of the vicinal subunit. The involvement of the C termini in the subunit-subunit interaction could be of functional significance in tetrameric assembly. In the binary complex of the protein, both subunits in an asymmetric unit contain NAD+ bound at the coenzyme binding site. NAD+ is visible in the electron density map and is bound in a similar fashion as in other SDR family enzymes. It is placed with its adenosine ribosyl-OH group held by Asp36 and its nicotinamide ring toward the active site of the enzyme where the nicotinamide ring lies parallel to the indole ring of Trp90. NAD+ interacts with the protein in a similar manner as in BphBLB400 (17Hülsmeyer M. Hecht H.J. Niefind K. Hofer B. Eltis L.D. Timmis K.N. Schomburg D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1286-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Superposition of the binary structure and the apo form gives an r.m.s deviation of 0.3 Å (3559 to 3559 atoms). The structure shows a local conformational change in the Cα chain and side chains of some of the residues surrounding the coenzyme binding site allowing the accommodation of NAD+ in the cavity. These conformational changes are visible at the substrate binding loop from Met187 to Arg192. As compared with the apo form, these amino acids move toward the pyrophosphate moiety and nicotinamide ring of NAD+. Crystal complexes of BphBB-356-44-DB and BphBB-356-23-DB were prepared by soaking with NAD+ and product or product analog for about 15 min. The difference Fourier maps distinctly showed the presence of NAD+ in both structures and also showed bulky electron density in the active site of the complexes. 23-DB and 44-DB molecules were modeled in the available electron density at the active site for their respective complexes. The refined ternary complexes of the BphBB-356 crystal structures show that product and product analogs bind to the active site essentially in the same manner (Fig. 3, A and B). As compared with the apo and binary forms of the enzyme, the ternary structure shows conformational changes in the residues surrounding the active site and the substrate binding loop. The distal rings of 23-DB and 44-DB were not very well defined in the electron density map and have higher B-factor than the average B-factor. To confirm the product/product analog binding to the active site, the ternary structures were refined without adding the coordinates of the product or product analog and it was observed that the ternary structure still has conformational changes. This suggests that substrates, product, or product analogs require conformational changes in the enzyme upon binding. This has also been mentioned for other enzymes that belong to the SDR family (31Tanaka N. Nonaka T. Nakamura K.T. Hara A. Curr. Org. Chem. 2001; 5: 89-111Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 32Tanaka N. Nonaka T. Tanabe T. Yoshimoto T. Tsuru D. Mitsui Y.

It could also be seen that as opposed to the BphBB-356 structure in the apo and binary forms, the active site in the ternary structure is devoid of any water molecule as shown in Fig. 4, A–C.FIGURE 4The surface representation of BphBB-356 in (A) apo form, (B) binary form, and (C) ternary structures in the presence of 23-DB and the (D) intermediate state. Residues Asp190 and Arg41 are highlighted; in apo and binary structures they appear as separate residues, whereas in the ternary structure they appear to be joined due to the interaction between them. The circled region is part of substrate binding loop between Gly198 and Val216, which is not visible in apo and binary forms but is visible in the ternary and intermediate structures. Shift in the substrate binding loop in the ternary and intermediate regions could be seen.

In the case of the BphBB-356-23-DB structure, the r.m.s. deviations compared with the apoenzyme and the binary structure were 0.4 Å (3550 to 3550 atoms) and 0.4 Å (3557 to 3557 atoms), respectively. The overall structure of each ternary complex is similar to the binary structure of BphBB-356, except that the substrate binding region (from residue Gly198 to Ser206) is complete and clearly visible in the electron density map for both ternary complexes. In the ternary complex, the complete substrate binding loop comes close to the active site and forms a compact cavity where the product/product analog binds. The same residues interact with NAD+ in the ternary and binary structures. However, conformational changes of residues from the substrate binding loop have been observed. Residues from Gly186 to Leu191 (which are also modeled in the binary structure), now make more interactions with NAD+.

https://openalex.org/W1605937053,"Mast cells release a variety of mediators, including arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites, to regulate allergy, inflammation, and host defense, and their differentiation and maturation within extravascular microenvironments depend on the stromal cytokine stem cell factor. Mouse mast cells express two major intracellular phospholipases A(2) (PLA(2)s), namely group IVA cytosolic PLA(2) (cPLA(2)α) and group VIA Ca(2+)-independent PLA(2) (iPLA(2)β), and the role of cPLA(2)α in eicosanoid synthesis by mast cells has been well documented. Lipidomic analyses of mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) lacking cPLA(2)α (Pla2g4a(-/-)) or iPLA(2)β (Pla2g6(-/-)) revealed that phospholipids with AA were selectively hydrolyzed by cPLA(2)α, not by iPLA(2)β, during FcεRI-mediated activation and even during fibroblast-dependent maturation. Neither FcεRI-dependent effector functions nor maturation-driven phospholipid remodeling was impaired in Pla2g6(-/-) BMMCs. Although BMMCs did not produce prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), the AA released by cPLA(2)α from BMMCs during maturation was converted to PGE(2) by microsomal PGE synthase-1 (mPGES-1) in cocultured fibroblasts, and accordingly, Pla2g4a(-/-) BMMCs promoted microenvironmental PGE(2) synthesis less efficiently than wild-type BMMCs both in vitro and in vivo. Mice deficient in mPGES-1 (Ptges(-/-)) had an augmented local anaphylactic response. These results suggest that cPLA(2)α in mast cells is functionally coupled, through the AA transfer mechanism, with stromal mPGES-1 to provide anti-anaphylactic PGE(2). Although iPLA(2)β is partially responsible for PGE(2) production by macrophages and dendritic cells, it is dispensable for mast cell maturation and function."

Overexpression of Rio2 causes a prolonged mitotic exit whereas knockdown of Rio2 accelerates mitotic progression, suggesting that Rio2 is required for the proper mitotic progression. Overexpression of phospho-mimicking mutant Rio2 S3D but not the nonphosphorylatable mutant Rio2 S3A displays a profile similar to that of wild-type Rio2. These results indicate that the phosphorylation status of Rio2 correlates with its function in mitosis. Furthermore, time-lapse imaging data show that overexpression of Rio2 but not Rio2 S3A results in a slowed metaphase-anaphase transition. Collectively, these findings strongly indicate that the Plk1-mediated phosphorylation of Rio2 regulates metaphase-anaphase transition during mitotic progression.

Rio2 was first identified as a member of RIO (right open reading frame) family which belongs to atypical protein kinases in yeast.

Tollervey D. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Previous studies in yeast indicated that depletion of Rio1 arrested cell cycle progression at S phase and mitosis (19Dez C. Tollervey D. Curr. Opin.

However, the role of Rio2 in cell proliferation has not been addressed. Rio2 was identified to be phosphorylated at mitosis by mass spectrometry recently, and two of the phosphorylated sites were proposed to be Plk1 consensus phosphorylation sites (9Hansen D.V. Loktev A.V. Ban K.H. Jackson P.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5623-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 30Daub H. Olsen J.V. Bairlein M. Gnad F. Oppermann F.S. Körner R. Greff Z. Kéri G.

Based on these findings, we assume that Rio2 may function in cell cycle progression. In this study, we demonstrate that Rio2 is a novel substrate of Plk1 and its phosphorylation by Plk1 plays an important role in the regulation of proper metaphase-anaphase transition. Myc-Plk1 and FLAG-Plk1 were made by subcloning Plk1 cDNA into the pCMV-myc and pFLAG-CMV-2 vector, respectively. FLAG-Rio2 was made by cloning the full length of Rio2 cDNA into pFLAG-CMV-2 at BglII-KpnI sites. The full length of Plk1 and Rio2 was cloned into pET30a and pET41b (Novagen), respectively. The deletion and point mutants of Rio2 were cloned into pET41b. The rabbit anti-Rio2 polyclonal antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Rio2 (280–450 amino acids). The antibody was affinity-purified with antigen-conjugated agarose. FLAG antibody (M2) was purchased from Sigma. Myc (9E10), Plk1 (F-8), cyclin B1 (GNS1), β-actin (1–19), and Ser(P)-10-H3 (sc-8656-R) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-phosphoserine antibody (AB1603) was purchased from Millipore. 293T cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100) with protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C for 15 min. Then the cell lysates were incubated with antibodies at 4 °C for 2 h followed by addition of protein A-agarose beads. After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed with the lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. For the GST pulldown assays, GST-Rio2 or GST immobilized on Sepharose 4B-glutathione beads (Pharmacia) were incubated with purified His-Plk1 at 4 °C for 2 h followed by washing with lysis buffer. The bound proteins were dissolved in SDS loading buffer, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with Plk1 antibody. His-tagged constitutively active Plk1 T210D (Plk1-TD) and kinase deficient Plk1 (Plk1-KD) (31Casenghi M. Meraldi P. Weinhart U. Duncan P.I. Körner R. Nigg E.A. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 113-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) were purified from Escherichia coli with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen). Purified GST-Rio2, GST-Rio2 mutants were incubated with Plk1-TD or Plk1-KD in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT) with 1 mm cold ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. The samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography. Cells were harvested, fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol at −20 °C, and stained with PBS/1% BSA containing 20 μg/ml propidium iodide and 100 μg/ml RNase A. Stained cells were analyzed on a FACScan instrument (BD FACSCalibur). GST-Rio2 was incubated with His-Plk1-TD or His-Plk1-KD and cold ATP for the in vitro kinase assay. Subsequently, GST-Rio2 was isolated using SDS-PAGE, digested with trypsin, and then subjected to HPLC-MALTI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis to identify the phosphopeptides. Double-strand RNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Ribobio (Guangzhou, China). Rio2 siRNAs were synthesized corresponding to the following cDNA sequences: siRio2-1, 5′-ACAUGGUGGCUGUAAUAAA-dTdT3′; siRio2-2, 5′-GGAUCUUGGAUAUGUUUAA-dTdT3′. HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA duplexes using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. FLAG-tagged Rio2, Rio2 S3A, and Rio2 S3D were cloned into the KpnI-XhoI sites of pcDNATM/TO vector (Invitrogen) and transfected into T-RExTM-HeLa cells (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, cells were selected with 100 μg/ml Zeocin and 5 μg/ml blasticidin for 3 weeks. Clones were picked, and expression of exogenous Rio2 was tested by immunoblotting in the presence of tetracycline. 293T and HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. T-REx™-HeLa cell lines were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS plus 5 μg/ml blasticidin. Cells were synchronized at G1/S transition by a double thymidine block as described in a previous report (32Deng M. Li F. Ballif B.A. Li S. Chen X. Guo L. Ye X. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7875-7888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In brief, HeLa cells were incubated for 16 h in complete medium with 2 mm thymidine released in fresh medium for 8 h and then incubated with 2 mm thymidine for another 16 h. For S phase synchronization, cells were released from the double thymidine treatment for 3 h. After 8 h, most of the cells were in G2 phase. To obtain cells synchronized in mitosis, HeLa cells were incubated for 16 h in the presence of 2 mm thymidine and released for 6 h followed by treatment with 100 ng/ml nocodazole for 6 h. Mitotic cells were collected by shake-off. Cells in G1 phase were obtained from this pool of cells by resuspending them in fresh medium and allowing them to exit from mitosis for 4 h, and discarding the unattached cells by shake-off. To monitor the cells during mitosis, HeLa cells were treated with thymidine for 16 h and released for 5 h, then were placed in microscope Delta Vision. Experiments were performed in a temperature-controlled chamber, which was maintained at 37 °C with a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Cells were observed, and images were taken every 6 min. SoftWoRx was used for acquisition and analysis. To investigate the interaction between Plk1 and Rio2, pCMV-myc-Plk1 and pFLAG-CMV-2-Rio2 were co-transfected into 293T cells. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibody and subjected to immunoblotting with myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, Rio2 associated with Plk1 in vivo. Next, we examined whether the kinase activity of Plk1 was involved in the interaction. FLAG-tagged Plk1 and a kinase-defective mutant FLAG-tagged Plk1-KD (K82R) were expressed, respectively, in 293T cells and then immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibody followed by immunoblotting with Rio2 antibody. The result indicated that the interaction between Plk1 and Rio2 was independent of Plk1 kinase activity (Fig. 1B). To confirm further the interaction between endogenous Rio2 and Plk1, the cell lysates from 293T cells were immunoprecipitated with Plk1 or Rio2 antibodies and immunoblotted with Rio2 or Plk1 antibodies. These data showed that endogenous Rio2 and Plk1 can associate with each other (Fig. 1, C and D). To verify the direct interaction between Plk1 and Rio2, we did the GST pulldown assay with purified GST-Rio2 and His-Plk1. As shown in Fig. 1E, Plk1 can interact with Rio2 in vitro. Plk1 contains the kinase domain at its N terminus and two polo-box domains at its C terminus. To address which region of Plk1 is required for the interaction with Rio2, FLAG-tagged Plk1 (1–330 amino acids) and FLAG-tagged Plk1 (330–603 amino acids) were generated (Fig. 2A) and transfected into 293T cells. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibody and subjected to immunoblotting with Rio2 antibody. Results shown in Fig. 2B demonstrated that the N-terminal region of Plk1 is responsible for its binding with Rio2. To examine whether Rio2 is a substrate for Plk1, we performed the in vitro kinase assay. Purified GST or GST-Rio2 was incubated with His-Plk1-TD (constitutively active form of Plk1). As shown in Fig. 3A, GST-Rio2 was phosphorylated. To confirm this result and exclude the autophosphorylation of Rio2, GST-Rio2 was incubated with His-Plk1-TD and His-Plk1–KD in kinase buffer. Plk1-TD could phosphorylate GST-Rio2 whereas Plk1-KD could not (Fig. 3B). These data indicated that Rio2 can be phosphorylated by Plk1. Next, we sought to define the phosphorylation sites on Rio2. GST-Rio2 was incubated with His-Plk1-TD or His-Plk1-KD for the in vitro kinase assay and subjected to a mass spectrometry analysis. Three phosphorylation sites in Rio2 (Ser-335, Ser-380, and Ser-548) were identified, and two of them, Ser-335 and Ser-380, were Plk1 consensus phosphorylation sites, E/D-X-S/T (Fig. 3C). To confirm the phosphorylation sites of Rio2 by Plk1, a series of deletion forms of Rio2 and their corresponding mutants with serine to alanine point mutation were prepared for the in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 3D). These data demonstrated that the Ser-335, Ser-380, and Ser-548 of Rio2 were phosphorylated by Plk1 (Fig. 3, D and E). The in vitro kinase assay with full-length Rio2 and its mutants indicated that Rio2 was highly phosphorylated by Plk1, whereas the phosphorylation of Rio2 S335D/S380D/S548A triple mutant (Rio2 S3A) was greatly reduced. The phosphorylation signals of Rio2 double mutants were also decreased compared with that of wild-type Rio2 (Fig. 3F). These results confirmed that Ser-335, Ser-380, and Ser-548 of Rio2 were the major phosphorylation sites for Plk1 in vitro. To confirm further that the three sites of Rio2 can be phosphorylated in vivo. pCMV-myc-Rio2 wild type or Rio2 S3A mutant was co-transfected with pFLAG-CMV-2-Plk1-TD into 293T cells. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with myc antibody and immunoblotted with phosphoserine antibody. As shown in Fig. 3G, The phosphorylation of Rio2 S3A was reduced significantly compared with that of wild-type Rio2, indicating that Rio2 can be phosphorylated in vivo. Rio2 has been identified as a Ser/Thr kinase and is capable of autophosphorylation (13LaRonde-LeBlanc N. Wlodawer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37297-37300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, the substrates of Rio2 still remain to be discovered. To determine whether Rio2 phosphorylation by Plk1 regulates the kinase activity of Rio2, we examined the autophosphorylation of Rio2. The KD mutant of Rio2, which lost the autophosphorylation activity, was taken as a negative control (18Zemp I. Wild T. O'Donohue M.F. Wandrey F. Widmann B. Gleizes P.E. Kutay U. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 1167-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Rio2 KD, Rio2 WT, Rio2 S3A, and Rio2 S3D were prepared for the in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 3H). The data showed that the autophosphorylation of Rio2 was not affected by Plk1 phosphorylation. Plk1 is a pivotal mitotic kinase of which both protein level and kinase activity are peaked at mitosis (33Golsteyn R.M. Mundt K.E. Fry A.M. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1617-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Rio2 interacted with Plk1, suggesting that it may function in mitosis. To investigate the functional relevance of Plk1-dependent Rio2 phosphorylation in mitosis, we generated the tet-on stable HeLa cell lines in which Rio2, nonphosphorylatable mutant Rio2 S335A/S380A/S548A (Rio2 S3A) or phospho-mimicking mutant S335D/S380D/S548D (Rio2 S3D) expressed in the presence of tetracycline (Fig. 4A). The cells were arrested in mitosis with nocodazole. Mitotic cells were shaken off and released into fresh medium, and their progression through mitosis was monitored by flow cytometry. The data showed that the percentage of cells at M phase in Rio2- and Rio2 S3D-overexpressed cells were 10–13% higher than that in the control and Rio2 S3A-overexpressed cells at 1.5 h and 2 h after release (Fig. 4, B and C). The data suggested that the phosphorylation of Rio2 was involved in controlling the proper timing of mitotic exit. The amount of cyclin B1 was higher in Rio2-overexpressed cells than in control and Rio2 S3A-overexpressed cells at 1.5 h after release from nocodazole block (Fig. 4D), which supported the phenotype observed in flow cytometry. To investigate further which stage of mitosis was influenced by Rio2, we monitored living cells through mitosis with time-lapse imaging microscopy. As clearly shown in Fig. 5A, Rio2-overexpressed cells stayed at metaphase longer than the control and Rio2 S3A-overexpressed cells. However, there seemed to be only marginal differences in the duration of other mitotic phases. The data of statistic analysis indicated that Rio2-overexpressed cells exhibited a slower metaphase-anaphase transition (40.7 ± 2.1 min) than the control (19.6 ± 0.8 min) and Rio2 S3A-overexpressed cells (23.4 ± 1.4 min) (Fig. 5B). Taken together, we propose that Rio2 is an important regulator for controlling the proper timing of metaphase-anaphase transition, and its phosphorylation, most likely by Plk1, regulates its function. To see whether the expression pattern of Rio2 is cell cycle-regulated, we synchronized HeLa cells at different phases of the cell cycle and detected the protein level of Rio2. The data showed that Rio2 is expressed in different phases of cell cycle at a similar level whereas Plk1 peaked at M phase (Fig. 6A). To investigate further the function of Rio2 in cell cycle progression, we took the RNA interference approach to determine whether knockdown of Rio2 affects mitotic progression. As shown in Fig. 6B, both sets of siRNA targeting to different regions of the Rio2 gene (siRio2-1, siRio2-2) (17Rouquette J. Choesmel V. Gleizes P.E. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2862-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 18Zemp I. Wild T. O'Donohue M.F. Wandrey F. Widmann B. Gleizes P.E. Kutay U. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 1167-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) could knock down Rio2 efficiently. We treated HeLa cells with either control or Rio2 siRNA and subsequently arrested them in mitosis with nocodazole. Mitotic cells were shaken off and released into fresh medium. The flow cytometry analysis data showed that the Rio2-depleted cells exited from mitosis faster than control cells (Fig. 6, C and D). Immunoblotting analysis showed that knockdown of Rio2 resulted in an accelerated kinetics for the degradation of cyclin B1 (Fig. 6E). These data indicated that depletion of Rio2 accelerates mitosis progression. To investigate whether the faster mitosis exit is due to inactive spindle checkpoint, we arrested HeLa cells with thymidine-nocodazole or thymidine-paclitaxel treatment. The mitotic index was determined by FACS using Ser(P)-10-H3 antibody (a well established marker of mitosis). As shown in Fig. 6, F and G, Rio2-depleted cells arrested at mitosis similar to control cells in the presence of nocodazole or paclitaxel. These results suggested that knockdown of Rio2 did not affect the spindle checkpoint. In this study, we identified Rio2 as a novel substrate of Plk1, and it can be phosphorylated by Plk1 at Ser-335, Ser-380, and Ser-548 in vitro. It has been reported that Ser-335 and Ser-380 of Rio2 were phosphorylated at mitosis in vivo (30Daub H. Olsen J.V. Bairlein M. Gnad F. Oppermann F.S. Körner R. Greff Z. Kéri G. Stemmann O. Mann M. Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 438-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), but the kinase responsible for the phosphorylation was unclear. Our results here suggest that Plk1 is likely to be the kinase that phosphorylates Rio2 at Ser-335 and Ser-380 at mitosis. Rio2 has been found as a Ser/Thr kinase and is capable of autophosphorylation (13LaRonde-LeBlanc N. Wlodawer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37297-37300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, the substrates of Rio2 still remain to be discovered, which presents a hurdle to our understanding of the biological function of Rio2 as a kinase. Thus, the autophosphorylation of Rio2 was investigated to see whether Plk1 phosphorylation affected Rio2 kinase activity. Rio2 and Rio2 S3A mutant showed similar autophosphorylation activity, which means that the kinase activity of Rio2 is probably not influenced by its phosphorylation by Plk1. The kinase domain of Rio2 is at its N-terminal region whereas its phosphorylation sites by Plk1 were all located at C-terminal domain which may explain why its phosphorylation by Plk1 does not influence its kinase activity. It is possible that the phosphorylation of Rio2 by Plk1 may regulate its interaction with other proteins. Plk1 phosphorylating Rio2 leads us to speculate that Rio2 may play a role in cell cycle progression, especially in mitosis. Considering the result that overexpression of Rio2 does not affect mitotic entry (data not shown), we wonder whether the mitotic exit will be influenced. Interestingly, our results show that overexpression of wild-type Rio2 and phospho-mimicking mutant Rio2 S3D prolong mitotic progression whereas knockdown of Rio2 accelerates mitotic exit, suggesting that Plk1-mediated phosphorylation of Rio2 regulates mitotic progression. In addition, time-lapse imaging data shows that the Rio2-overexpressed cells take a longer time at metaphase than Rio2 S3A-overexpressed cells, although the cells could eventually exit from mitosis (Fig. 5A). These results demonstrate that Rio2 plays an important role in controlling the metaphase-anaphase transition. Based on these observations, we propose that the phosphorylation of Rio2 by Plk1 will allow cells to complete mitosis in a proper timing. The exact molecular mechanism by which Rio2 regulates mitotic progression needs to be studied further. It has been reported that Plk1 activity is involved in a variety of pathways to ensure correct metaphase-anaphase transition. Most of these functions are linked to the regulation of APC/C, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is responsible for the timely degradation of various mitotic proteins (securin, cyclin B1), thereby regulating chromosome segregation and initiating anaphase (34Kraft C.

We find that Rio2 interacts with Apc3 and Apc5 (data not shown), subunits of APC/C complex, suggesting that Plk1-mediated phosphorylation of Rio2 may control the timing of metaphase-anaphase transition by regulating the activity of APC/C. We analyzed whether overexpression of Rio2 influenced the function APC/C by checking the half-life of cyclin B1 in the presence of cyclohexmide. There was no significant difference observed on the half-life of endogenous cyclin B1 between control and Rio2-overexpressed cells (data not shown). It is possible that interaction of Rio2 and APCs may control Rio2 degradation, or Rio2 may play a role in APC/C complex targeting other proteins. In summary, we have identified Rio2 as a novel substrate of Plk1 and Plk1-dependent phosphorylation of Rio2 regulates the normal timing of the metaphase-anaphase transition. Our studies unveil a novel role of Rio2 in regulating mitotic progression, in addition to its function in ribosome biogenesis. These findings are helpful to a better understanding of the various roles of Plk1 in controlling metaphase-anaphase transition."
https://openalex.org/W2088953459,"Expression of β-catenin is strictly regulated in normal cells via the glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β)- adenomatous polyposis coli-axin-mediated degradation pathway. Mechanisms leading to inactivation of this pathway (example: activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling or mutations of members of the degradation complex) can result in β-catenin stabilization and activation of β-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF) signaling. β-Catenin-mediated cellular events are diverse and complex. A better understanding of the cellular signaling networks that control β-catenin pathway is important for designing effective therapeutic strategies targeting this axis. To gain more insight, we focused on determining any possible cross-talk between β-catenin and mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3), a MAPK kinase kinase member. Our studies indicated that MLK3 can induce β-catenin expression via post-translational stabilization in various cancer cells, including prostate cancer. This function of MLK3 was dependent on its kinase activity. MLK3 can interact with β-catenin and phosphorylate it in vitro. Overexpression of GSK3β-WT or the S9A mutant was unable to antagonize MLK3-induced stabilization, suggesting this to be independent of GSK3β pathway. Surprisingly, despite stabilizing β-catenin, MLK3 inhibited TCF transcriptional activity in the presence of both WT and S37A β-catenin. These resulted in reduced expression of β-catenin/TCF downstream targets Survivin and myc. Immunoprecipitation studies indicated that MLK3 did not decrease β-catenin/TCF interaction but promoted interaction between β-catenin and KLF4, a known repressor of β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity. In addition, co-expression of MLK3 and β-catenin resulted in significant G(2)/M arrest. These studies provide a novel insight toward the regulation of β-catenin pathway, which can be targeted to control cancer cell proliferation, particularly those with aberrant activation of β-catenin signaling."

The Rho GTPase Cdc42 has been shown to regulate cell-ECM interaction in conventional two-dimensional culture conditions by using dominant mutants of Cdc42 in immortalized cell lines that may introduce nonspecific effects. Here, we employ three-dimensional culture systems for conditional gene targeted primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts that better simulate the reciprocal and adaptive interactions between cells and surrounding matrix to define the role of Cdc42 signaling pathways in ECM organization. Cdc42 deficiency leads to a defect in global cell-matrix interactions reflected by a decrease in collagen gel contraction. The defect is associated with an altered cell-matrix interaction that is evident by morphologic changes and reduced focal adhesion complex formation. The matrix defect is also associated with a reduction in synthesis and activation of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and altered fibronectin deposition patterning. A Cdc42 mutant rescue experiment found that downstream of Cdc42, p21-activated kinase (PAK), but not Par6 or WASP, may be involved in regulating collagen gel contraction and fibronectin organization. Thus, in addition to the previously implicated roles in intracellular regulation of actin organization, proliferation, and vesicle trafficking, Cdc42 is essential in ECM remodeling in three dimensions.

https://openalex.org/W2056900042,"The mechanism that leads to the inverse relationship between heightened cellular proliferation and the cessation of elastic fibers production, observed during formation of the arterial occlusions and dermal scars, is not fully understood. Because the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), responsible for cell cycle initiation, has also been implicated in insulin-like growth factor-I-mediated signaling stimulating elastin gene activation, we explored whether differential phosphorylation of Rb by various cyclin·cyclin-dependent kinase complexes would be responsible for promoting either elastogenic or pro-proliferative signals. We first tested cultures of dermal fibroblasts derived from Costello syndrome patients, in which heightened proliferation driven by mutated oncogenic H-Ras coincides with inhibition of elastogenesis. We found that Costello syndrome fibroblasts display elevated level of Rb phosphorylation on serine 780 (Ser(P)-780-Rb) and that pharmacological inhibition of Ras with radicicol, Mek/Erk with PD98059, or cyclin-dependent kinase 4 with PD0332991 not only leads to down-regulation of Ser(P)-780-Rb levels but also enhances Rb phosphorylation on threonine-821 (Thr(P)-821-Rb), which coincides with the recovery of elastin production. Then we demonstrated that treatment of normal skin fibroblasts with the pro-proliferative PDGF BB also up-regulates Ser(P)-780-Rb levels, but treatment with the pro-elastogenic insulin-like growth factor-I activates cyclinE-cdk2 complex to phosphorylate Rb on Thr-821. Importantly, we have established that elevation of Thr(P)-821-Rb promotes Rb binding to the Sp1 transcription factor and that successive binding of the Rb-Sp1 complex to the retinoblastoma control element within the elastin gene promoter stimulates tropoelastin transcription. In summary, we provide novel insight into the role of Rb in mediating the inverse relationship between elastogenesis and cellular proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2063822225,"The present study deals with in silico prediction and in vitro evaluation of the selective cytotoxic effects of triterpenoids on tumorigenic human c-Ha-ras and mouse c-myc cotransfected highly metastatic serum-free mouse embryo-1 (r/m HM-SFME-1) cells. Ligand fitting of five different triterpenoids to 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11βHSD2) was analyzed with a molecular modeling method, and glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) was the best-fitted triterpenoid to the ligand binding site in 11βHSD2. Analysis of antiproliferative effects revealed that GA, oleanolic acid, and ursolic acid had selective toxicity against the tumor cells and that GA was the most potent triterpenoid in its selectivity. The toxic activity of the tested triterpenoids against the tumor cells showed good correlations with the partition coefficient (logP) and polar surface area values. Time-lapse microscopy, fluorescence staining, and confocal laser scanning microscopic observation revealed that GA induced morphologic changes typical of apoptosis such as cell shrinkage and blebbing and also disrupted the cytoskeletal proteins. Furthermore, GA exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on 11βHSD2 activity in the tumor cells. Our current results suggest that analysis of the ligand-receptor interaction between triterpenoids and 11βHSD2 can be utilized to predict their antitumor effects and that GA can be used as a possible chemopreventive and therapeutic antitumor agent. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on in silico prediction of the toxic effects of triterpenoids on tumor cells by 11βHSD2 inhibition."
