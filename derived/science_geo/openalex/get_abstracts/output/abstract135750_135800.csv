https://openalex.org/W1945990234,"Peroxynitrite is a potent oxidant formed by the rapid reaction of the free radicals nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide. It causes airway hyperresponsiveness and airway epithelial damage, enhances inflammatory cell recruitment, and inhibits pulmonary surfactant. Asthma is characterized by increased airway hyperresponsiveness, airway epithelial shedding, and inflammation. We examined the production of peroxynitrite and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in airways of asthmatic patients compared to normal control subjects. We also performed a double-blind, crossover randomized-order, placebo-controlled study on 10 asthmatic patients to study the effects of inhaled glucocorticoid treatment (Budesonide) on the formation of peroxynitrite and NO. Fiberoptic bronchial biopsies were examined by immunohistochemistry with antiserum to nitrotyrosine, a marker of protein nitration by peroxynitrite. We also examined the expression of iNOS by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, and measured exhaled NO by chemiluminescence. We correlated the airway production of peroxynitrite with pulmonary functions and airway responsiveness. In airway passages of control subjects, there was weak or no nitrotyrosine immu-noreactivity. In contrast, there was strong immuno-reactivity for nitrotyrosine in the airway epithelium and inflammatory cells in the airways of persons with asthma. Budesonide treatment resulted in a significant reduction in nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity. Expression of iNOS was evident in the airway pithelium of controls and asthmatic patients, but was significantly more abundant in asthmatic patients. The presence of nitrotyrosine in the airway epithelium (r= −0.841, P < 0.0001; r = −0.771, P = 0.0004) and inflammatory cells (r= −0.727, P = 0014; r= −0.681, P = 0.004) correlated inversely with methacholine PC20 and forced expiratory volume in 1 s, respectively. Asthma is associated with increased peroxynitrite formation in the airways, which is reduced after Budesonide treatment. The potent oxidant peroxynitrite may contribute to airway obstruction and hyperresponsiveness and epithelial damage in asthma.—Saleh, D., Ernst, P., Lim, S., Barnes, P. J., Giaid, A. Increased formation of the potent oxidant peroxynitrite in the airways of asthmatic patients is associated with induction of nitric oxide synthase: effect of inhaled glucocorticoid.

https://openalex.org/W2130070821,"'Viable yellow' (Avy/a) mice are larger, obese, hyperinsulinemic, more susceptible to cancer, and, on average, shorter lived than their non-yellow siblings. They are epigenetic mosaics ranging from a yellow phenotype with maximum ectopic agouti overexpression, through a continuum of mottled agouti/yellow phenotypes with partial agouti overexpression, to a pseudoagouti phenotype with minimal ectopic expression. Pseudoagouti Avy/a mice are lean, healthy, and longer lived than their yellow siblings. Here we report that feeding pregnant black a/a dams methyl-supplemented diets alters epigenetic regulation of agouti expression in their offspring, as indicated by increased agouti/black mottling in the direction of the pseudoagouti phenotype. We also present confirmatory evidence that epigenetic phenotypes are maternally heritable. Thus Avy expression, already known to be modulated by imprinting, strain-specific modification, and maternal epigenetic inheritance, is also modulated by maternal diet. These observations suggest, at least in this special case, that maternal dietary supplementation may positively affect health and longevity of the offspring. Therefore, this experimental system should be useful for identifying maternal factors that modulate epigenetic mechanisms, especially DNA methylation, in developing embryos."

TNF-α does not activate in vitro migration and proliferation of endothelium, and its angiogenic activity is elicited by synthesis of direct angiogenic inducers or of proteases. Here, we show that TNF-α up-regulates in a dose- and time-dependent manner the expression and the function of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) as well as the expression of its co-receptor neuropilin-1 in human endothelium. As inferred by nuclear run-on assay and transient expression of VEGFR-2 promoter-based reporter gene construct, the cytokine increased the transcription of the VEGFR-2 gene. Mithramycin, an inhibitor of binding of nuclear transcription factor Sp1 to the promoter consensus sequence, blocked activation of VEGFR-2, suggesting that the up-regulation of the receptor required Sp1 binding sites. TNF-α increased the cellular amounts of VEGFR-2 protein and tripled the high affinity125I-VEGF-A165 capacity without affecting theKd of ligand-receptor interaction. As a consequence, TNF-α enhanced the migration and the wound healing triggered by VEGF-A165. Since VEGFR-2 mediates angiogenic signals in endothelium, our data indicate that its up-regulation is another mechanism by which TNF-α is angiogenic and may provide insight into the mechanism of neovascularization as occurs in TNF-α-mediated pathological settings.

A well regulated angiogenesis is critical for embryonic growth, bone remodeling, menstrual cycle, corpus luteum formation, and tissue repair. The stable vascular bed occurring in these physiologic conditions results from a balance of signals that favor angiogenesis and those that promote vascular regression. In contrast, a deregulated angiogenesis is pivotal in tumor progression and inflammatory and viral diseases (1Bussolino F. Mantovani A. Persico G. Trends Biochem.

Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4834) Google Scholar). A number of naturally occurring growth factors can directly induce angiogenesis by stimulating endothelial cell proliferation and migration or act indirectly by triggering endothelial cells themselves or accessory cells (monocyte/macrophage, mastocytes, T cells) to release direct angiogenic inducers (1Bussolino F.

TNF-α stimulates in vitro chemotaxis of bovine adrenal capillary endothelial cells (4Leibovich S.J. Polverini P.J. Shepard H.M. Wiseman D.M. Shively V. Nurredin N.

TNF-α activates in endothelial cells the synthesis of B61 (9Holzaman L.B. Marks R. Dixit V.M. Mol. Cell.

In endothelial cells, TNF-α promotes the synthesis of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (15van Hinsbergh V.W.M. van den Berg E.A. Fiers W. Dooijewaard G. Blood. 1990; 75: 1991-1998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is involved in the progression phase of angiogenesis characterized by a remodeling of extracellular matrix proteins by proteolytic enzymes (Ref. 16Bacharach E.

TNF-α cooperates with basic FGF, vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), and interleukin-8 to induce capillary-like tubular structure of human microvascular endothelial cell growth in a three-dimensional gel of extracellular matrix proteins (17Koolwijk P. van Erck M.G. de Vree W.J.

Kuwano M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4015-4023Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). In these systems, the type of extracellular matrix seems to address the features of the angiogenic model. TNF-α does not induce angiogenesis in vitro when the cells are plated on three-dimensional fibrin matrix, but it is permissive for the activity of basic FGF and VEGF-A. TNF-α up-regulates the activity of urokinase-type plasminogen activator, which is required for the formation of capillary structure in addition to the angiogenic molecules (17Koolwijk P. van Erck M.G. de Vree W.J. Vermeer M.A. Weich H.A. Hanemaaijer R. van Hinsbergh V.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1177-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Otherwise, TNF-α induces in vitro angiogenesis of endothelium plated on collagen type I. This activity is mediated by the release of VEGF-A, basic FGF, and interleukin-8 (18Yoshida S. Ono M. Shono M. Izumi H. Ishibashi T. Suzuki H. Kuwano M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4015-4023Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TNF-α induces mesenchymal or tumor cells to release angiogenic molecules, including VEGF-A (7Ryuto M. Ono M. Izumi H. Yoshida S. Weich H.A. Kohno K. Kuwano M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28220-28228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 19Gaudry M. Bregerie O. Andrieu V. Benna J. Pocidalo M.A. Hakim J. Blood. 1997; 90: 4153-4161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, it has been reported that TNF-α regulates the expression of integrins involved in adhesion of endothelial cells to extracellular matrix and in angiogenesis (8Defilippi P. Truffa G. Stefanuto G. Altruda F. Silengo L. Tarone G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7638-7645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Defilippi P. van Hinsbergh V. Bertolotto A. Rossino P. Silengo L. Tarone G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The puzzling effects of TNF-α on endothelial cells and new vessel growth suggest the presence of more than one angiogenic signaling pathway and that this cytokine may have different activities on endothelial cells depending on the microenvironment. In light of the relevance of the cooperation between TNF-α and VEGF-A (7Ryuto M. Ono M. Izumi H. Yoshida S. Weich H.A. Kohno K. Kuwano M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28220-28228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 17Koolwijk P. van Erck M.G. de Vree W.J. Vermeer M.A. Weich H.A. Hanemaaijer R. van Hinsbergh V.W. J.

Adult endothelial cells express on their surface VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-1 encoded by Flt-1 (21De Vries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck K. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Science. 1992; 255: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar) and VEGFR-2 by KDR/Flk-1 (22Millauer B. Wizigmann-Voos S. Schnurch H. Martinez R. Moller N.P. Risau W. Ullrich A.

Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1677-1683PubMed Google Scholar), but recent findings suggest that the latter alone is able to mediate the mitogenic and chemotactic effect of VEGF-A in endothelial cells (22Millauer B.

More recently, it has been reported that neuropilin-1, a receptor that mediates neuronal cell guidance (26He Z. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1997; 90: 739-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar), is expressed by endothelial cells and enhances the binding of VEGF-A165 isoform to VEGFR-2 (27Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that the pretreatment of endothelial cells with TNF-α is followed by an increased migration and wound repair induced by VEGF-A165. An augmented expression of VEGFR-2 and neuropilin-1 genes causes this effect. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells, prepared and characterized as described previously (28Bussolino F. Di Renzo M.F. Ziche M. Bocchietto E. Olivero M. Naldini L. Gaudino G. Tamagnone L. Coffer A. Comoglio P.M. J.

They were used at early passages (I–III). Human fibrosarcoma 8378 cells, which respond to TNF-α (29Basile A. Sica A. d'Aniello E. Breviario F. Garrido G. Castellano M. Mantovani A. Introna M. J.

Porcine aortic endothelial cells transfected with human VEGFR-2 (24Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in Ham's F-12 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FCS. Human foreskin microvascular endothelial cells isolated as described previously (17Koolwijk P. van Erck M.G. de Vree W.J. Vermeer M.A. Weich H.A. Hanemaaijer R. van Hinsbergh V.W. J.

To verify the effects of TNF-α on the expression of VEGF receptors and on the biological activities elicited by VEGF-A165, the following experimental conditions have been used: confluent endothelial cell growth at a CO2 level of 5% in atmospheric air was treated with TNF-α (1 × 107 units/mg of protein; Genentech, Inc., San Francisco, CA) in medium 199 supplemented with 20, 5, and 1% FCS or 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (lipopolysaccharide-free, Sigma), twice washed with medium 199, and then used to extract RNA. Alternatively, cells were stimulated with VEGF-A165 (a gift of Dr. H. A. Weich, GBF, Braunschweig, Germany) (30Barleon B. Sozzani S. Zhou D. Weich H.A. Mantovani A. Marme D.

In some experiments, endothelial cells were starved for 24 h in medium 199 containing 1% FCS and 1% BSA before adding TNF-α. The effect of mithramycin (Sigma), which inhibits gene expression by blocking Sp1 binding to the CG box (7Ryuto M. Ono M. Izumi H. Yoshida S. Weich H.A. Kohno K. Kuwano M. J. Biol.

Total cellular RNA was isolated by guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction and centrifugation through cesium chloride (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.3-7.87Google Scholar). Equal amounts of total RNA (15 μg/lane) were electrophoresed in 1% agarose gels containing 6.3% formaldehyde in MOPS buffer (Sigma) and blotted on a Nylon Duralon-UV membrane (Stratagene) by the traditional capillary system in 10× SSC (1.5m NaCl, 150 mm sodium citrate, pH 7) (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.3-7.87Google Scholar). Filters were cross-linked with UV light (0.5 J/cm2) and prehybridized for 4 h at 42 °C in 50% formamide deioinizate, 10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS, 1 m NaCl, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 42 °C with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom, UK) human VEGFR-2 (a 0.729-kb HindIII–EcoRI of KDR cDNA) (23Terman B.I.

Posthybridization washes were performed at high stringency (once in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min, once in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min and twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min) at 57 °C, and the membranes were exposed on autoradiography with Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham). Nuclei were isolated from cultured endothelial cells essentially according to Ref. 34Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G.

Briefly, cells (2 × 107 cells/assay) were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped and collected in a 15-ml centrifuge tube by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The cells were resuspended in 4 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and allowed to stand on ice for 5 min. and then centrifuged at 500 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. Nuclei were resuspended in 200 μl of glycerol storage buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 40% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA) and frozen in liquid N2. In vitro transcription and isolation of the resulting nuclear RNA were performed as described by Ikeda et al. (35Ikeda E. Achen M.G. Breier G. Risau W. J. Biol.

Two-hundred μl of frozen nuclei were thawed and mixed with 200 μl of 2× reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 300 mm KCl 10 mm dithiothreitol, 400 units/ml placental ribonuclease inhibitor (Stratagene), 20 mm creatine phosphate (Sigma), 200 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase (Sigma), a 1 mmconcentration each of ATP, CTP, and GTP (Stratagene), and 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham). Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with shaking and for 5 min in the presence of 20 units of DNase I (RNase-free, Life Technologies, Inc.). After the addition of proteinase K (150 μg/ml, Sigma) and SDS (0.5% final concentration), incubation was continued at 37 °C for 30 min. Extracted RNA was resuspended in TES buffer (10 mm TES, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS) at 5 × 106cpm/ml. Linearized plasmids containing the target cDNAs (15 μg) were immobilized onto a nylon Duralon-UV membrane (Stratagene) using a Bio-Dot SF microfiltration apparatus (Bio-Rad). The filters were prehybridized overnight at 42 °C with hybridization buffer containing 20 mm PIPES (Sigma), pH 6.4, 50% formamide (Sigma), 2 mm EDTA, 0.8 m NaCl, 0.2% SDS, 1× Denhardt's solution (0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% BSA, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone), 200 μg/ml E. coli tRNA (RNase-free, Stratagene). Hybridization was at 42 °C for 48 h in the same solution supplemented with 15 × 106 total cpm of labeled RNA. The filters were washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS at 42 °C for 30 min, twice in 0.3× SSC, 0.5% SDS, at 42 °C for 30 min and then incubated with 10 μg/ml RNase A in 2× SSC at 37 °C for 30 min. Further washed were done in 2× SSC at 37 °C for 30 min and then in 0.3× SSC at 37 °C for 30 min. The filters were exposed on autoradiography with Hyperfilm-MP and intensifying screens at −80 °C. The amount of VEGFR-2 mRNA was standardized by comparison with the amount of β-actin mRNA. Densitometric analysis was performed with a GS250 Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). Endothelial cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed on ice with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml pepstatin, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 500 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (all from Sigma). After centrifugation (20 min at 4 °C at 13,000 × g), protein were solubilized, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7%), transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), probed with rabbit anti-VEGFR-2 antibody (C-1158, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and detected by ECL (Amersham). Recombinant VEGF-A165 (2 μg) was dissolved in 200 μl of sodium phosphate buffer 20 mm, pH 7.4, and transferred in IODO-GEN-coated tubes (50 μg/ml) (Pierce), where VEGF-A165 was iodinated (5 min, 4 °C) with 1 mCi of125I (Amersham). Twenty μl of phosphate buffer 20 mm, pH 7.2, containing 1% BSA, 0.4 m NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS (Pierce) was added, and the reaction products were separated on Sephadex-G10. The specific activity of the tracer was 90,000 cpm/ng. 125I-VEGF-A165 retained its biological activity as measured by migration of endothelial cells (28Bussolino F. Di Renzo M.F. Ziche M. Bocchietto E. Olivero M. Naldini L. Gaudino G. Tamagnone L. Coffer A. Comoglio P.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 629-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). For specific binding studies confluent cells plated in 24-well plates were incubated an orbital shaker at 4 °C for 2 h in 200 μl/well of binding medium (medium 199 containing 20 mmHepes buffer, pH 7.4, 0.1% BSA, 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor) with increasing concentrations of125I-VEGF-A165 in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ligand. Endothelial cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% BSA and lysed in 200 μl/well of SDS 2% in PBS. Lysates were counted using a Beckman γ 5500B counter. Triplicate samples under each condition were obtained for each experiment. Specific binding, calculated subtracting from the total cpm bound after incubation with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ligand, was approximately 80%. The Kd was estimated by Scatchard plot using the Ligand program (Elseviere-Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). The 2.0-kbXhoI/SacI fragment of Flk-1 promoter (36Gerber H.P. Condorelli F. Park J. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23659-23667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) was subcloned in pGL2basic plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate the luciferase reporter vector pGL2basicFlk-1. 2H. Gerber and J. Park, personal communication. Human fibrosarcoma 8387 cell line (2 × 105 cells/well) was transfected with 3 μg of pGL2basicFlk-1 or pGL2basic using Superfect Transfection Reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA).The generated plasmid-liposome complex in 0.6 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 10% FCS was incubated with the cells for 3 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The medium was then replaced with fresh medium, and the cells were stimulated for 4 h with TNF-α (20 ng/ml) or left untreated. pSVgal construct (2.5 μg) was co-transfected to correct for the variability in transfection efficiency, and β-galactosidase activity was assayed with chlorophenol red β-d-galactopyranoside (Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) as a substrate. For final luciferase assay, cells were lysed in 0.2 ml of passive lysis buffer (dual luciferase assay, Promega) at 4 °C, and 20 μl of cleared (12,000 ×g for 2 min at 4 °C) cell extract containing 50 μg of protein were mixed with 0.1 ml of luciferase assay buffer. Light production was measured for 5 s in a luminometer (Magic Lite Analyzer, Ciba Corning, Milano, Italy), and results were normalized to the β-galactosidase activity. Migration assay was performed as described previously with Boyden's chamber technique (28Bussolino F. Di Renzo M.F. Ziche M. Bocchietto E. Olivero M. Naldini L. Gaudino G. Tamagnone L. Coffer A. Comoglio P.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 629-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). Polycarbonate filters (5-μm pore size polyvinylpyrrolidone-free; Neuroprobe, Pleasanton, CA) were coated with 0.1% gelatin for 6 h at room temperature. VEGF-A165 in medium 199 supplemented with 1% FCS was seeded in the lower compartment of the chamber, and 1.25 × 105 resuspended cells in 50 μl of medium 199 containing 1% FCS were then seeded in the upper compartment. At the end of the incubation (37 °C in air with 5% CO2 for 6 h), filters were removed and stained with Diff-Quik (Baxter Spa, Rome, Italy), and 10 high power oil immersion fields were counted. The results obtained were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and the Student-Newman-Keuls test (Statistic Software; Bio-Soft). Human endothelial cells were grown at confluence on 24 wells and monolayers were treated for 24 h with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) or vehicle alone in medium 199 containing 5% FCS. After washes, the monolayer was wounded with a razor blade (lesion surface: 20 mm2) as described (28Bussolino F. Di Renzo M.F. Ziche M. Bocchietto E. Olivero M. Naldini L. Gaudino G. Tamagnone L. Coffer A. Comoglio P.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 629-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar) and incubated in medium 199 containing 3% BSA with or without VEGF-A165. After 24 h, the cells were fixed and stained as described (28Bussolino F. Di Renzo M.F. Ziche M. Bocchietto E. Olivero M. Naldini L. Gaudino G. Tamagnone L. Coffer A. Comoglio P.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 629-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). To quantify the repair process, phase-contrast microscopic pictures of wounded monolayer were recorded with a still video camera recorder (R5000H; Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan), and cell number was counted in 10 fields of 1 mm2 randomly selected, with a Cosmozone image analyzer (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).

HFE is the product of the gene that is mutated in >80% of hereditary hemochromatosis patients. It was recently found to coprecipitate with the transferrin receptor (Feder, J. N., Penny, D.

A. 94, 13198-13202) and to decrease the affinity of transferrin for the transferrin receptor (Feder et al.). In this study, HeLa cells were transfected with HFE under the control of the tetracycline-repressible promoter. We demonstrate that HFE and the transferrin receptor are capable of associating with each other within 30 min of their synthesis with pulse-chase experiments. HFE and the transferrin receptor co-immunoprecipitate throughout the biosynthetic pathway. Excess HFE is rapidly degraded, whereas the HFE-transferrin receptor complex is stable. Immunofluorescence experiments indicate that they also endocytose into transferrin-positive compartments. Combined, these results suggest a role for the transferrin receptor in HFE trafficking. Cells expressing HFE have modestly increased levels of transferrin receptor and drastically reduced levels of ferritin. These results implicate HFE further in the modulation of iron levels in the cell."

We report here the purification of a PGG-glucan-binding element from human leukocytes and its identification as lactosylceramide, a major glycosphingolipid of neutrophils, which includes the CDw17 epitope. The binding of radiolabeled PGG-glucan to purified lactosylceramide was saturable, specific, and time- and temperature-dependent. Lactosylceramides from human leukocytes were fractionated by high performance liquid chromatography in order to analyze the effect of ceramide structure on binding. A variety of fatty acid chain lengths with varying degrees of unsaturation were found to support binding to radiolabeled PGG-glucan. However, dl-lactosylceramides containing dihydrosphingosine did not bind. Radiolabeled PGG-glucan bound several other neutral glycosphingolipids with a terminal galactose, including galactosylceramide, globotriaosylceramide, and gangliotetraosylceramide. The binding of radiolabeled PGG-glucan to lactosylceramide was not inhibited by glycogen, dextran, mannan, pustulan, laminarin, or a low molecular weight β-(1–3)-glucan, but was inhibited by high molecular weight β-(1–3)-glucans and by a monoclonal antibody to lactosylceramide.

Crude preparations of yeast β-glucans have been known for over 40 years to stimulate animal defense mechanisms, and it is now generally believed that the active component in these preparations is β-(1–3)-glucans. β-(1–3)-Glucans are major components of yeast and fungal cell walls, therefore, this stimulation may reflect a natural defense in response to breakdown products of the fungal cell wall. Both soluble and particulate β-glucans have numerous biological activities including stimulation of the reticuloendothelial system, induction of hematopoiesis, activation of the complement and/or cytokine system, inhibition of tumor cell growth, and induced resistance to infections (for reviews, see Ref. 1Bohn J. BeMiller J. Carbohydr. Polym. 1995; 28: 3-14Crossref Scopus (861) Google Scholar and 2Stone B. Clarke A. Chemistry and Biology of (1 , 3) -β-Glucans. La Trobe University Press, Victoria, Australia1992: 525-565Google Scholar). The various activities of β-(1–3)-glucans may reflect the presence of multiple cellular targets or receptors. Several different receptors for β-glucans have in fact been identified on leukocytes, including 160- and 180-kDa proteins on human monocytes and U937 cells (3Szabo T. Kadish J.L. Czop J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2145-2151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and the leukocyte complement receptor 3 protein (4Thornton B.P. Vetvicka V. Pitman M. Goldman R.C. Ross G.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1235-1246PubMed Google Scholar). Other cellular receptors that recognize β-(1–3)-glucans have been described but not yet defined biochemically (5Konopski Z.

Most glucan preparations that have been studied directly activate cells and induce cytokines, limiting their potential clinical use. In addition, intravenous administration of particulate glucans is toxic, resulting in embolization and the formation of granulomas (9Williams D.L. McNamee R.B. Jones E.L. Pretus H.A. Ensley H.E. Browder I.W. Di Luzio N.R. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 219: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). PGG-glucan (Betafectin®) is a highly purified, neutral, water-soluble glucan that by contrast does not directly activate cells or induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines (10Patchen M.L.

It is a glucose homopolymer of 170,000 ± 20,000 Da derived from the cell wall of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and is comprised of a β-(1–3)-glucan backbone containing β-(1–6)-linked, β-(1–3) branches. It has been shown to have immunomodulatory effects in animals and in humans. For instance, in mice PGG-glucan rapidly mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells (10Patchen M.L. Liang J. Vaudrain T. Martin T. Melican D. Zhong S. Stewart M. Quesenberry P.J. Stem Cells. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In a rat model for periodontitis, PGG-glucan reduced infection-mediated periapical bone resorption, enhanced the number of circulating neutrophils and monocytes, and increased neutrophil phagocytic activity (13Stashenko P. Wang C.Y. Riley E. Wu Y. Ostroff G. Niederman R. J. Dent. Res. 1995; 74: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In vitro, PGG-glucan has recently been shown to activate a transcription factor heteromer in a murine monocytic cell line (14Adams D.S. Pero S.C. Sen A. Wakshull E. J. Leuk. Biol. 1997; 62: 865-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and, when immobilized, to elicit respiratory burst activity and secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α by rat macrophages (15Melican D. Brunke-Reese D. Langevin M. Lemerise K. Mackin W.M. Michelak M.T. J. Leuk. Biol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Immunomodulatory effects in humans were shown in phase II clinical trials, in which PGG-glucan was shown to reduce postoperative infection rates and to shorten the length of hospitalization (16Babineau T.J. Marcello P. Swails W. Kenler A. Bistrian B. Forse R.A. Ann. Surg. 1994; 220: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 17Babineau T.J. Hackford A. Kenler A. Bistrian B. Forse P.A.

PGG-glucan has also recently been shown to elicit functional responses in human neutrophils, including enhancement of oxidative burst and microbicidal activity, and induction of nuclear transcription factors. 1E. Wakshull, D. Brunke-Reese, J. Lindermuth, L. Fisette, R. Nathans, J. Crowley, J. Tufts, J. Zimmerman, W. Mackin, and D. Adams, submitted for publication. In efforts to characterize the receptor responsible for these functions, it was also shown that binding of radiolabeled PGG-glucan could be detected in membranes from human leukocytes, and that the binding was due primarily to the neutrophil content. This binding activity was shown to be distinct from other reported glucan receptors. We identify here the binding site on human leukocytes as lactosylceramide and describe the binding characteristics of radiolabeled PGG-glucan to immobilized LacCer. 2The designation of glycolipids is according to the recommendations of the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (18Recommendations of the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry Lipids. 1977; 12: 455-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Other abbreviations used are: HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry. LacCer contains the CDw17 epitope, a cellular differentiation antigen expressed on the surface of mature myeloid cells (19Andrews R.G. Torok-Storb B. Bernstein I.D. Blood. 1983; 62: 124-132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This glycolipid is especially abundant in human neutrophils where it makes up two-thirds of the total glycolipids, with approximately 20% found in the cell membrane (20Symington F.W. Hedges D.L. Hakomori S. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 2498-2506PubMed Google Scholar,21Kniep B. Skubitz K.M. J. Leuk. Biol. 1998; 63: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, its function in these cells remains largely unknown. Lactosylceramide was purified from human leukocyte membranes as described below, unless otherwise specified. All other sphingolipids, ceramides, phospholipids, and enzymes were from Sigma, except porcine lactosylceramide, which was from Matreya, Inc. (Pleasant Gap, PA) and jack bean β-galactosidase, which was from Oxford GlycoSystems Inc. (Rosedale, NY). Polystyrene 96-well plates were from Corning (New York). High performance TLC plates, 0.2-mm thickness, were from E. M. Science (Gibbstown, NJ). Silica gel 60 (200–400 mesh) was from Aldrich. PGG-glucan (170 ± 20 kDa), low molecular weight glucan (18 kDa), and high molecular weight glucan (1,000 kDa) were manufactured by Alpha-Beta Technology, Inc., and resuspended in 0.9% NaCl to the indicated concentration. Other macromolecular carbohydrates were obtained as follows: pustulan (average 20 kDa, Calbiochem), oyster glycogen (ICN, Cleveland, OH), dextran (average 70 kDa), laminarin, and mannan (Sigma). The control ascites fluid was a mouse IgM directed against Cryptosporidium parvum (Biodesign International, Kennebunk, ME). SolvableTM was from NEN Life Science Products. Protein concentration was determined with the BCA reagent (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Leukocytes were sedimented from human blood (Red Cross, Dedham, MA) by the addition of an equal volume of 3% dextran. The following steps were carried out at 4 °C. Red blood cells were removed by hypotonic lysis, and leukocytes were resuspended in 3–4 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors, then lysed by sonication with a probe tip (50 watts, 30 × 1-s pulses). Following removal of nuclei and remaining intact cells by low speed centrifugation (700 × g, 7 min), membranes were collected from the supernatant by ultracentrifugation (180,000 ×g, 60 min), and resuspended in HBSS to 5 mg of protein/ml. Membranes were prepared from the human monocytic cell line U937 by the lysis procedure described above following growth of the cells in RPMI medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). The polyaldehyde of PGG-glucan was prepared by oxidation with a 20-fold molar excess of NaIO4 for 72 h in the dark. Following dialysis, the oxidized PGG-glucan was reductively labeled by NEN Life Science Products with 100 mCi of [3H]NaBH4, then dialyzed to give [3H]PGG-glucan, specific activity 3.1 μCi/μg hexose.1 Membranes (700 μg of protein; 140 μl) were incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C with [3H]PGG-glucan (1 μg/ml) and with unlabeled PGG-glucan (1 mg/ml) to determine nonspecific binding or an equal volume of 0.9% NaCl to determine total binding. Assays were brought to a total volume of 350 μl with HBSS. For assays containing ascites fluid, membranes (525 μg of protein; 105 μl) were incubated with [3H]PGG-glucan and 0.9% NaCl or unlabeled PGG-glucan, as above. Aliquots (100 μl) of each assay were centrifuged (5 min, 12,000 × g), and the resulting pellets were rinsed with HBSS and dissolved in SolvableTM, and radioactivity was determined. Specific binding is presented as the mean of triplicate samples ± S.D. and was calculated as (total binding) − (nonspecific binding). Human leukocyte or U937 membranes (5 mg of protein; 1 ml) were extracted with chloroform and methanol (3:2:1 chloroform/methanol/membranes, by volume) essentially as described previously (22Vance R.E. Sweeley C.C. J. Lipid Res. 1967; 8: 621-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting upper and lower layers were separated from the proteinaceous interphase. Reconstituted membrane lipids were prepared by drying the combined layers under a stream of argon, followed by resuspension in HBSS (to the original volume of starting membranes) with brief sonication. 140 μl of the lipid suspension was assayed for [3H]PGG-glucan binding activity as described above in a total volume of 350 μl. Where indicated, the upper (or lower) layer from an extraction of human leukocyte membranes was combined with the lower (or upper) layer of a U937 membrane extraction before drying. The lower layer from an extraction of membranes (100 mg of protein) prepared as described above was dried under a stream of argon, dissolved in chloroform/methanol (10:1), then applied to a silica gel column (1 × 0.8 cm) equilibrated in chloroform. The column was eluted successively with chloroform, acetone, acetone/methanol (9:1), and methanol (22Vance R.E. Sweeley C.C. J. Lipid Res. 1967; 8: 621-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions were concentrated to dryness, and the acetone/methanol fraction was redissolved in chloroform/methanol (10:1) then applied to a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column as described previously (23Schnaar R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 348-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The column was eluted with chloroform/methanol/water (30:60:8), then chloroform/methanol/0.8 m NaOAc (30:60:8). The chloroform/methanol/water fraction was dried, redissolved in chloroform/methanol (5:1), then applied to a second silica gel column (25 × 0.8 cm) equilibrated in chloroform. The column was eluted with 60 ml each of chloroform, chloroform/methanol (7.5:1), chloroform/methanol (5:1), chloroform/methanol (2:1), then methanol. Aliquots of fractions from each column were dried and resuspended in ethanol for use in the 96-well plate assay described below. Samples and standards were analyzed using high performance TLC silica gel plates run in chloroform/methanol/water (80:20:2) for separation of glycosphingolipids, or in 1-butanol/ethanol/water (5:5:4) for separation of mono- and disaccharides. Glycosphingolipids and saccharides were visualized with orcinol spray reagent or by iodine vapors (23Schnaar R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 348-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). LacCer from human leukocyte membranes was treated with jack bean β-galactosidase or ceramide glycanase (23Schnaar R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 348-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To test enzyme-treated fractions in the binding assay, detergent and enzyme were removed by passing the reaction over a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) (23Schnaar R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 348-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Fractionation of LacCer into individual components was carried out using a modification of a described procedure (24Kushi Y. Rokawa C. Numajir Y. Handa S. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) on a Hewlett Packard 1090 HPLC using a 5-μm Symmetry C18column (3.9 × 150 mm, Waters Corporation) and a mobile phase of 3.5% 0.2 m ammonium acetate in methanol at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Peaks with uv absorbance at 206 nm were collected, dried down by vacuum, and analyzed by TLC to identify fractions containing LacCer. Isolated fractions were quantitated using a S.E.D.E.R.E. Sedex 55 evaporative mass detector (Alfortville France) at 45 °C, using high purity nitrogen at 2.1 bar as effluent. Isolated fractions from HPLC were analyzed for sugar, fatty acid, and sphingosine composition following methanolysis (25Irie A. Kubo H. Inagaki F. Hoshi M. J. Biochem. 1990; 108: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) as follows. An aliquot was methanolyzed and the methanol solution extracted with hexane. The extracted fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed by GC-MS on a Hewlett Packard 5890 series II gas chromatograph with a Hewlett Packard 5971A mass selective detector. The methanol layer was dried, trimethylsilylated, and dissolved in hexane, and the resulting trimethylsilylated methyl glycosides were analyzed by GC-MS. A second aliquot was treated with ceramide glycanase and freeze dried. The resulting acylated sphingosine and oligosaccharide were trimethylsilylated, dissolved in hexane, and analyzed by GC-MS on a HT-5 aluminum-clad capillary column. The indicated glycolipid/sphingolipid or purification fraction was suspended in ethanol, and aliquots were applied in triplicate to the wells of a 96-well plate then dried under a stream of argon. The following components were added to each well: PGG-glucan (1 mg/ml) or an equal volume of 0.9% NaCl, [3H]PGG-glucan (1 μg/ml), and HBSS (80 μl) in a final volume of 100 μl. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h unless indicated otherwise, then supernatants were removed from each well and discarded. Wells were rinsed twice with HBSS (200 μl), then SolvableTM (100 μl) was added, and the plate was incubated at 60 °C for 5 min, after which supernatants were transferred to vials containing scintillation fluid, and radioactivity was determined. To verify that the glycolipids/sphingolipids were not dissociating from the plate during the incubation, mock reactions were run without [3H]PGG-glucan, incubated, and rinsed as above, then chloroform/methanol (1:2) was added to wells. The liquid was transferred from the wells, concentrated, and analyzed by TLC. Following orcinol and/or iodine visualization, no detectable decrease in staining intensity was seen compared with the amount coated. Specific binding was determined as described for the membrane binding assay. A mouse monoclonal antibody to LacCer was developed using antigen comprised of a LacCer/bovine serum albumin mixture prepared as described for globoside (26Hakomori S. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 28: 232-236Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Female BALB/c mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 0.1 ml of the antigen mixed in an equal volume of TiterMax Adjuvant (Vaxcel, Inc., Norcross, GA). Hybridomas and ascites fluid were prepared following the procedure and schedule described (27Herrmann J.E. Blacklow N.R. Matsui S.M. Lewis T.L. Estes M.K. Ball J.M. Brinker J.P. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1995; : 2511-2513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that TiterMax was used as adjuvant throughout the procedure. Antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using LacCer immobilized as described above, with alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG/IgM (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA) as a secondary antibody. One LacCer-specific hybridoma was isolated, 8D12, which secreted specific IgM antibody. Extraction of human leukocyte membranes with chloroform/methanol results in two phases (upper and lower layers) and a proteinaceous interphase. When reconstituted, the upper plus lower layers showed significant specific binding to [3H]PGG-glucan, indicating that reconstituted membrane lipids retained binding capacity (Fig.1 A). In fact, a 4-fold increase in binding activity was recovered from the extraction as compared with the starting membranes. As a control, U937 membranes, which do not show appreciable binding, were extracted in the same manner and found not to demonstrate binding. We found that the upper or lower layers of human leukocyte membrane extractions did not pellet efficiently by microcentrifugation when assayed for binding alone. Therefore, we combined each of these layers with the opposite layer from a U937 membrane extraction to determine where the binding activity resided. This combination revealed that the activity apparently resided in the lower layer of the human leukocyte membrane extraction. In addition, the organic-extractable binding activity was essentially quantitatively recovered following silica and DEAE chromatography of the lower layer (Fig. 1 B). Following a previously described purification scheme known to separate the general classes of non-lipids, gangliosides, phospholipids, neutral lipids, and glycosphingolipids (28McCluer R.H. Ullman M.D. Jungalwala F.B. Adv. Chromatogr. 1986; 25: 309-353PubMed Google Scholar) we found that the activity in the lower layer purified as a neutral glycosphingolipid which co-migrated on TLC with a standard LacCer doublet (Fig. 1 C). This compound was not detected in extracts from U937 membranes. The purified compound also represented a major orcinol-reactive species in the starting leukocyte membrane extract, and LacCer is known to be the major neutral glycosphingolipid in human neutrophils (29Hildebrand J. Stryckmans P. Stoffyn P. J. Lipid Res. 1971; 12: 361-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By TLC analysis, we found that the purified material produced compounds co-migrating with GlcCer and galactose when treated with β-galactosidase, and a compound co-migrating with lactose upon treatment with ceramide glycanase, consistent with a LacCer (Galβ1–4GlcCer) structure (Fig.1 C). 1 mg of LacCer was purified from ∼1 × 109 human leukocytes (100 mg of leukocyte membrane protein). To characterize the binding of [3H]PGG-glucan to LacCer, we examined several aspects of this interaction using the 96-well plate assay. This assay was found to be linear to 1.6 μg/well LacCer (Fig.2 A). The binding of [3H]PGG-glucan to immobilized LacCer was time-dependent, with equilibrium binding reached at approximately 60 min (Fig. 2 B). Temperature dependence of the binding was observed with no detectable binding of [3H]PGG-glucan at 25 °C or lower, but significant binding at 37 °C (Fig. 2 C). [3H]PGG-glucan binding to LacCer was reversible and was inhibited by unlabeled PGG-glucan (IC50∼9 μg/ml) in the 96-well plate binding assay (Fig.3 A). We tested other glucans and mannan at concentrations close to this value for their ability to compete with [3H]PGG-glucan binding to LacCer. Only β-(1–3)-glucan structures were found to compete for binding, since dextran, glycogen, pustulan, or mannan did not compete at 15 μg/ml (Fig. 3 B). Competition by β-(1–3)-glucan was found with PGG-glucan and a high molecular weight β-(1–3)-glucan, while lower molecular weight β-(1–3)-glucan (and laminarin) did not compete efficiently for [3H]PGG-glucan binding. These β-(1–3)-glucans differ not only in their size but in some cases their degree of branching and length of branches. Therefore β-(1–3)-glucan of specific structure is necessary to compete [3H]PGG-glucan binding to LacCer. In addition, binding of [3H]PGG-glucan to LacCer was not competed with lactose, galactose, glucose, or the corresponding methyl glycosides at 100 mm, or with the correspondingp-nitrophenyl glycosides at 11 mm (data not shown). Previous reports of bacteria or toxin interactions with glycosphingolipids have shown an effect of the ceramide structure on binding (30Stromberg N. Karlsson K.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11244-11250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kiarash A. Boyd B. Lingwood C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11138-11146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We were interested in whether this structure affected [3H]PGG-glucan binding, and consequently isolated individual LacCer species by HPLC. The profile of LacCer content is shown by the evaporative mass trace in Fig.4, representing HPLC fractionation of LacCer isolated from human leukocyte membranes as described above. The major peaks that contained LacCer by TLC analysis were analyzed by GC-MS to determine the fatty acid structure (denoted in Fig. 4) and the sphingosine structure. The peak at 13 min also contained LacCer by TLC analysis but, upon further separation by HPLC fractionated into three peaks, resulting in insufficient amounts for analysis by GC-MS. Neutrophils account for ∼90% of the binding of [3H]PGG-glucan to human leukocytes.1Neutrophils also contribute the majority of LacCer found in whole blood cells, and reportedly contain two species of LacCer, with C16:0 and C24:1 fatty acids (32Fukuda M. Dell A. Oates J. Wu P. Klock J. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1067-1082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these data, we found that these were the major species in human leukocyte LacCer (see Fig. 4). The other species of LacCer are likely contributed by other blood cells, including monocytes, lymphocytes (33Stein K.E. Marcus D.M. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5285-5291Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 34Macher B.A. Klock J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2092-2096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and platelets (35Tao R.V.P. Sweeley C.C. Jamieson G.A. J. Lipid Res. 1973; 14: 16-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,36Marcus A.J. Ullman H.C. Safier L.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1972; 51: 2602-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To determine the influence of LacCer fatty acid structure on [3H]PGG-glucan binding, the isolated LacCer species were analyzed in the 96-well plate assay. As shown in TableI, all species were able to bind [3H]PGG-glucan, with less than a 2-fold range in binding activity. Variations in length or degree of unsaturation of the fatty acid chain seemed to have little effect on the binding activity. In contrast to the isolated LacCer with a C18:1 long chain base, commercially available semisynthetic (dl)-LacCer containing dihydrosphingosine (C18:0) gave no binding activity. The presence of stereoisomers in this preparation might be expected to have a diluting effect on binding activity, but instead complete abrogation was observed. This striking loss of binding activity is, therefore, most likely due to the saturation of the long chain base.Table IBinding of [3 H]PGG-glucan to lactosylceramidesFatty acidLong chain base[3H]PGG-glucan boundng/μg LacCerLacCerC16:0C18:13.31 ± 0.27C18:0C18:11.93 ± 0.13C24:2C18:12.01 ± 0.23C24:1C18:12.31 ± 0.37C22:0C18:13.57 ± 0.77C24:0C18:13.14 ± 0.54N-Palmitoyl-dl-dihydrolactocerebrosideC16:0C18:0NDaND, not detected.N-Stearoyl-dl-dihydrolacto-cerebrosideC18:0C18:0NDN-Lignoceroyl-dl-dihydrolacto-cerebrosideC24:0C18:0NDBinding of [3H]PGG-glucan to indicated LacCer was carried out in the 96-well plate assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Specific binding is shown, and each value is a mean of triplicate determinations.a ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab Binding of [3H]PGG-glucan to indicated LacCer was carried out in the 96-well plate assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Specific binding is shown, and each value is a mean of triplicate determinations. When LacCer was treated with jack bean β-galactosidase to give GlcCer, little binding was seen with [3H]PGG-glucan (see TableII). We therefore tested several other commercially available sphingolipids to determine the specificity for binding. As shown in Table II, several glycosphingolipids in addition to LacCer which contain a terminal galactose were found to bind [3H]PGG-glucan, namely, GalCer Sigma types I and II, gangliotetraosylceramide (Gal(β1–4)GalNAc(β1–4)Gal(β1–4)GlcCer), and globotriaosylceramide (Gal(α1–4)Gal(β1–4)GlcCer). GalSph, which contains a terminal galactose but no fatty acid chain, did not bind significantly. GalCer Sigma type I and GalCer Sigma type II (type I contains ∼98% α-hydroxy fatty acids, while type II contains ∼98% non-hydroxy fatty acids according to the description provided by Sigma) showed a 10-fold difference between them in binding to [3H]PGG-glucan. GalCer II-sulfate (sulfatides) did not bind, nor did the gangliosides GM1, GM2, GD3, or GM3. This finding is consistent with the fact that fractions shown in Fig. 1 B that did not contain LacCer did not show binding, although since LacCer is the predominant neutral glycosphingolipid, it does not rule out the possibility that other glycosphingolipids could bind if higher levels were used in the 96-well plate assay. Neolactotetraosylceramide (Gal(β1–4)GlcNAc(β1–3)Gal(β1–4)GlcCer), for instance, was not tested here but contains a terminal galactose and is found in granulocytes (32Fukuda M. Dell A. Oates J. Wu P.

To investigate the mechanism of increased COX-2 expression following Ras-mediated transformation, Rat-1:iRas cell line was transfected with an Ha-Ras Val-12 cDNA expression vector that is under the transcriptional control of the lac operon and is inducible with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG). IPTG treatment caused parallel increases in the levels of Ha-Ras and COX-2 proteins in Rat-1:iRas cells. The increased expression of COX-2 was accompanied by increased prostaglandin E2 production. Selective inhibition of COX-2 activity suppressed the production of prostaglandin E2 by >90% but did not alter the progress of the morphological transformation. The level of COX-2 mRNA was up-regulated by activated Ha-Ras. Induction of Ras increased the transcription of COX-2 by 44.3 ± 10.1% and increased the half-life of COX-2 mRNA by ∼3.5-fold. A specific mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor (PD 98059) caused a delay in both the activation of ERK1/2 and the induction of COX-2 in IPTG-induced Rat-1:iRas cells. Inhibition of ERK activity by PD 98059 also suppressed the induction of COX-2 by epidermal growth factor in intestinal epithelial cells and significantly reduced the expression of COX-2 in Ha-Ras-transformed rat intestinal epithelial cells.

Activated p42 and p44 MAP kinases (also referred to as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs)) translocate into the nucleus, modulate the phosphorylation of transcription factors, and ultimately lead to the expression of genes that are crucial for cell growth and differentiation (6Karin M.

A. 1997; 94: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) implying that COX-2 may play an important role in the survival and growth of transformed intestinal epithelial cells.In this study, we have attempted to investigate the mechanism for the increased expression of COX-2 during conditional Ras-mediated transformation of Rat-1 fibroblasts. Rat-1 fibroblasts were stably transfected with an inducible mutant Ha-Ras Val-12 cDNA expression vector. In this system the oncogene is under the transcriptional control of the Lac operon and can be strongly induced by treatment of the cells with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG). This conditionally transformed cell line (Rat-1:iRas) exhibits a non-transformed phenotype under normal culture conditions and undergoes rapid transformation after the induction of mutated Ha-Rasby treatment with IPTG (24McCarthy S.A. Samuels M.L. Pritchard C.A. Abraham J.A. McMahon M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1953-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 25Zhang R. Zhang H. Zhu W. Pardee A.B. Coffey R.J. Liang P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1607-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We found that COX-2 mRNA and protein expression and prostaglandin E2 production were greatly increased in parallel with the induction of activated Ha-Ras. Increased expression of COX-2 was the result of a modest increase in the rate of COX-2 gene transcription combined with stabilization of COX-2 mRNA. Finally, biochemical analysis indicates that activation of the MAPK pathway (ERK1/2) appears to be necessary for Ras or EGF-receptor mediated induction of COX-2 expression.DISCUSSIONIdentifying the target genes of Ras signaling and exploring their regulation by activated Ras is a key step in understanding the mechanism(s) whereby Ras gene mutations contribute to malignant transformation. In this study, using inducible activated Ha-Ras Val-12-transfected Rat-1 cells, we found that activation of Ha-Ras results in rapid induction of COX-2 and prostaglandin E2 production. In addition, studies in non-small cell lung cancer cells have demonstrated that activated Ras increased expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2, an enzyme that releases arachidonic acid from cellular phospholipid stores, thus making it available for the cyclooxygenase enzymes. These two observations suggest that increased prostanoid production may be an important phenotypic consequence of Ras activation (34Heasley L.E. Thaler S. Nicks M. Price B. Skorecki K. Nemenoff R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14501-14504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar).Although the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 is often associated with neoplastic transformation of epithelial cells, the precise role of COX-2 in transformation is not clear. We have previously reported that increased COX-2 expression is not sufficient for neoplastic transformation of rat intestinal epithelial cells (35Tsujii M. Dubois R. Cell. 1995; 83: 493-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2131) Google Scholar), and selective inhibition of COX-2 activity did not reverse the transformed phenotype of Ha-Ras-transformed RIE cells (RIE-Ras) (26Sheng G.G. Shao J. Sheng H. Hooton E.B. Isakson P.C. Morrow J.D. Coffey R.J. DuBois R.N. Beauchamp R.D. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1883-1891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) or COX-2 expressing human colon cancer cells (HCA-7) (36Sheng H. Shao J. Kirkland S.C. Isakson P. Coffey R.J. Morrow J.D. Beauchamp R.D. DuBois R.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2254-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that selective inhibition of COX-2 activity by treatment of SC-58125 reduced the production of PGE2 by >90% but did not alter the progress of morphological transformation. These results suggest that induction of COX-2 is an early consequence of Ras activation in Rat-I fibroblasts but is not required for morphological alterations that are indicative of the transformed phenotype. What role might induction of COX-2 play in tumor progression? In previous studies, forced expression of COX-2 in non-transformed intestinal epithelial cells (RIE-1) resulted in resistance to apoptosis (35Tsujii M. Dubois R. Cell. 1995; 83: 493-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2131) Google Scholar). Selective inhibition of COX-2 activity suppressed the growth of RIE-Ras (26Sheng G.G. Shao J. Sheng H. Hooton E.B. Isakson P.C. Morrow J.D. Coffey R.J. DuBois R.N. Beauchamp R.D. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1883-1891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and HCA-7 cells (36Sheng H. Shao J. Kirkland S.C. Isakson P. Coffey R.J. Morrow J.D. Beauchamp R.D. DuBois R.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2254-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) primarily via the induction of apoptosis. Addition of prostaglandin E2, the predominant eicosanoid product of COX-2 in HCA-7 cells, significantly increased the clonogenicity of HCA-7 cells and abrogated the induction of apoptosis caused by treatment with a COX-2 antagonist (29Sheng H. Shao J. Morrow J.D. Beauchamp R.D. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 362-366PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that increases in COX-2 and prostaglandins that occur during cell transformation may enhance cell survival and provide a selective advantage for the transformed cells that overexpress COX-2. Interestingly, the induction of COX-2 by Ha-Ras was not sufficient to prevent the Rat-1:iRas cells undergoing apoptosis beginning 72 h after IPTG treatment. Further studies will be required to determine whether COX-2 expression and prostaglandins provide selective protection for epithelial cells as compared with fibroblasts.Previously, it was reported that COX-2 expression was regulated at the transcriptional level by activated Ha-Ras in mammary cells (23Subbaramaiah K.

Dannenberg A.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2890-2895PubMed Google Scholar) and by oncogene v-src (47Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and growth factors (48Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31742-31748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) in NIH 3T3 cells. Both human and murine COX-2 promoters contain a consensus cyclic AMP response element (CRE). The CRE element in the murine COX-2 promoter is essential for optimal COX-2 gene expression in response to v-src and platelet-derived growth factor or serum (47Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 48Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31742-31748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The rat COX-2 promoter does not contain this CRE sequence implying that different regulatory pathways may be utilized for induction of COX-2 between murine and rat cells. Analysis of nuclear run-on experiments revealed that the basal transcription rate of COX-2 in Rat-1 fibroblasts was relatively high and was increased only modestly after Ras induction. In addition to modest transcriptional activation of COX-2, we also observed post-transcriptional stabilization of COX-2 mRNA after Ras induction. In non-transformed Rat-1:iRas cells, the COX-2 mRNA was very unstable and was quickly degraded, thus steady-state levels of COX-2 mRNA and protein were barely detectable. There was a ∼3.5-fold reduction in the COX-2 mRNA decay rate in Ras-transformed Rat-1 cells as compared with non-transformed Rat-1:Ras cells. These results suggest that activation of the Ras signal transduction pathway either induces factor(s) that stabilize or inhibits factors that destabilize COX-2 mRNA. Recent studies suggest that under selective conditions post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA stability may significantly contribute to the regulation of COX-2 mRNA levels. Interleukin-1α induced rapid but transient activation of COX-2 transcription and also prolonged the half-life of the COX-2 mRNA (49Ristimaki A. Garfinkel S. Wessendorf J. Maciag T. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11769-11775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Post-transcriptional regulation of cytokine-induced cyclooxygenase-2 transcript isoforms by dexamethasone has also been reported (50Ristimaki A. Narko K. Hla T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar).In the present study, we observed no change in the levels of COX-1 mRNA after Ha-Ras activation in Rat-1:iRas cells. Although COX-1 and COX-2 are very similar at the amino acid level, and even have comparable enzymatic activities, their expression pattern is markedly different. COX-1, often referred to as the “constitutive” cyclooxygenase, is present in most tissues. In contrast, COX-2 is normally absent but can be rapidly induced by a wide range of stimuli. The 3′-untranslated region of the COX-2 transcript differs from COX-1 and has two polyadenylation signals, which potentially explain different mRNA sizes observed by Northern analysis (2.8–4.5 kb). This region is extremely AT-rich, and contains 9 copies of the Shaw-Kamens sequence (ATTTA) otherwise known as A + U-rich elements (AREs) (51Caput D. Beutler B. Hartog K. Thayer R. Brown-Shimer S. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1670-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar, 52Sirenko O.I. Lofquist A.K. DeMaria C.T. Morris J.S. Brewer G. Haskill J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3898-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This motif is present in many immediate early genes and is thought to be involved in regulating the rate of mRNA degradation. For example, if AREs are added to a normally stable transcript, such as β-globin, the transcript is rapidly degraded (53Sachs A.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 413-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). It is of interest to note that these ARE sequences are conserved between murine, rat, and human COX-2 3′-untranslated regions, suggesting an important role for their presence.The mechanism by which mutated Ras induces transformation is complex and incompletely understood. Different Ras effectors may be required for transformation of different cell types. Activation of the Raf-1/MAP kinase cascade alone is not sufficient for Ras transformation of rat intestinal epithelial cells but appears to be sufficient for the transformation of rodent fibroblasts (54Oldham S.M. Clark G.J. Lisa M, G. Robert J. Coffey J. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A selective MEK inhibitor PD 98059 reverses the phenotype of Ras-transformed BALB 3T3 mouse fibroblasts and rat kidney cells (44Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). Activated Ras promotes the translocation of Raf-1 to the plasma membrane (55Stokoe D. MacDonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 56Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar), additional factors complete the activation of Raf-1 kinase activity (57Hall A. Science. 1994; 264: 1413-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and then Raf-1 in turn phosphorylates MEK1 and -2. Activated Ras also activates Rho family proteins (RhoA, Rho B, and Rac1), and the Rho proteins phosphorylate and activate PAKs and MEKK1–3. MEKK1–3 are able to activate both JNK/SAPK and ERK (13Qiu R.-G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 15Prendergast G.C. Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Kurzawa H. Lebowitz P.F. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2289-2296PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that morphological transformation of Rat-1:iRas cells was accompanied by an increase in ERK activity indicating the importance of the Ras-Raf1-MEK-ERK pathway in oncogenic Ha-Ras-induced transformation of Rat-1 cells. Treatment with the MEK inhibitor, PD 98059, delayed both the induction of active ERK and the morphological transformation of IPTG induced Rat-1:iRas cells, but after 24 h the ERK activity recovered and the cells acquired the transformed phenotype despite repeatedly adding PD 98059. The PD 98059 compound does not inhibit phosphorylated MEK but inhibits both activation and phosphorylation of MEK by Raf kinase and MEKK. Whereas PD 98059 potently inhibits the activation of MEK1, it has much less inhibitory activity for MEK2 (45Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3247) Google Scholar). The incomplete transient inhibition of ERK activation by PD98059 may be caused either by incomplete suppression of Raf and MEK activities or by other Raf-independent Ras signaling pathways (58Quilliam L.A. Khosravi-Far R. Huff S.Y. Der C.J. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) that may not be suppressed by PD 98059 treatment.Previously Xie and Herschman (47Xie W.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31742-31748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) in NIH 3T3 cells requires activation of both Ras/Rac1/MEKK1/JNK and Ras/Raf-1/ERK signal transduction pathways. Our studies suggest that both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of COX-2 expression by activated Ha-Ras is dependent on the MAPK. Complete inhibition of MEK/ERK activity by PD 98059 between 8 and 24 following treatment abolished both the increased transcriptional activity and the stabilization of COX-2 mRNA. When the activation of ERK escaped from PD 98059 inhibitory effect, the levels of COX-2 mRNA and protein increased. Our results do not exclude the possibility that JNK or other signaling pathways are also required for full expression of COX-2 in Ras-transformed Rat-1 cells (47Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 48Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31742-31748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In addition, we also found that MAPK activity is necessary for the high level expression of COX-2 in intestinal epithelial cells that have been transfected with activated Ha-Ras or in EGF-stimulated non-transformed rat intestinal epithelial cells. Our observations suggest that induction of MAPK activity is essential for induction of COX-2 that occurs after activation of the Ras pathway, whether by activation of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase or by activation of mutant Ras. Ras proteins are GDP/GTP-regulated switch molecules that relay signals from receptor tyrosine kinases to the nucleus via activation of a number of signal transduction cascades. Ras activation stimulates both cell proliferation and differentiation (1Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2662) Google Scholar, 2Prendergast G.C.

We report the cloning and expression of a third type 2 PAP enzyme (288 amino acids, predicted molecular mass of 32.6 kDa), PAP-2c, which exhibits 54 and 43% sequence homology to PAPs 2a and 2b. Expression of HA epitope-tagged PAP-2a, -2b, and 2c in HEK293 cells produced immunoreactive proteins and increased membrane-associated PAP activity. Sf9 insect cells contain very low endogenous PAP activity. Recombinant expression of the three PAP enzymes using baculovirus vectors produces dramatic increases in membrane-associated Mg2+-independent,N-ethylmaleimide-insensitive PAP activity.

This enzyme was first recognized as a pivotal component of metabolic pathways controlling the synthesis of glycerophospholipids and triacylglycerols (1Brindley D.N. Waggoner D.W. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 80: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). More recent advances have focused attention on PA as a receptor-generated intracellular mediator formed by the phospholipase D (PLD)-catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC). PA generated in this manner appears to act on a variety of cell-specific target proteins that include atypical protein kinase C isoforms, the Raf protein kinases, the Ras GTPase-activating protein, several proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization, and the neutrophil respiratory burst oxidase. In this case, PAP-catalyzed hydrolysis of PA serves to terminate the signaling functions of PA and concurrently generates diacylglycerol for activation of conventional Ca2+ and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C enzymes. DG kinase generates PA by ATP-dependent phosphorylation of DG. Presumably the subcellular localization, catalytic, and regulatory properties of these different lipid-metabolizing enzymes will dictate the source, fate, and signaling functions of PA and DG (2Exton J.H.

Type 1 activity (PAP-1) is associated with the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum and appears to redistribute from the soluble to membrane compartment upon treatment of hepatocytes with glucagon and glucocorticoids (4Jamal Z.

PAP-1 activity is sensitive to inhibition by sulfhydryl reagents (most notablyN-ethylmaleimide (NEM)) and displays an absolute requirement for Mg2+.

PAP-2 activity is presumably directed toward the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, although several reports also describe a cell surface enzyme with PAP-2-like properties that may serve to terminate the receptor-directed signaling functions of lyso-PA (LPA) and related compounds (9Perry D.K.

Biophys. 1994; 312: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P) phosphatase activities have also been described in mammalian cells, and purified preparations of rat liver PAP-2 also catalyze the hydrolysis of these lipid phosphomonoesters (11Waggoner D.W.

C1P, S1P, and their hydrolysis products exhibit a number of interesting biological activities and may function as intra- and possibly extracellular signaling molecules (12Spiegel S. Foster D. Kolesnick R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The inference drawn from these studies is that PAP-1 most likely functions in lipid synthesis, while PAP-2 may have an important role to play in modulating the signaling functions of PA and LPA as well as lipid phosphomonoesters derived from sphingomyelin. The tight association of PAP with membranes and the low abundance of the proteins has hampered purification attempts. PAP-1 has not yet been isolated. Several groups have prepared highly enriched preparations of PAP-2 from a number of tissue sources (6Waggoner D.W. Martin A. Dewald J. Gomez-Munoz A. Brindley D.N. J. Biol.

Rat liver PAP-2 was identified as a glycosylated protein of about 50 kDa that could be converted to a 28-kDa protein by N-glycanase treatment (6Waggoner D.W. Martin A. Dewald J. Gomez-Munoz A.

A mouse cDNA (mPAP-2a) encoding a protein that is highly similar to a heat-inducible gene product (Hic53) has recently been isolated. When expressed in HEK 293 cells, this protein localizes to the plasma membrane and is accompanied by a Mg2+-independent PAP activity (13Kai M. Wada I. Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol.

A human cDNA encoding a second mammalian PAP-2 enzyme, hPAP-2b (the human homolog of a previously described rat intestinal epithelial cell endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein, Dri42), has been cloned (14Kai M.

We sought to identify further human PAP homologs, and a search of expressed sequence tag data bases identified a number of candidate sequences. Full-length cDNAs encoding three of these (PAP-2a, PAP-2b, and a novel PAP-2 isoform, PAP-2c) have been cloned. These enzymes have been expressed as HA epitope-tagged proteins by transient transfection of HEK-293 cells and in Sf9 insect cells using baculovirus vectors. These systems have been used to investigate the cell surface activity of the three PAP enzymes, to examine their specificity for lipid phosphomonoester substrates presented as components of nonionic detergent micelles and susceptibilities to inhibition by a number of agents that have been widely used as modulators of PAP-2 activity in intact and broken cell systems. We conducted blast searches of the GenBankTM data base of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) using regions of sequence conserved among mouse PAP-2 and a variety of previously recognized homologs including the product of theDrosophila wunen gene and four Saccharomyces cerevisiae open reading frames. We identified a number of candidate human sequences in this manner. Sequences encoding human homologs of mouse PAP-2a and rat Dri42 and a third apparently novel sequence were selected for further study. These cDNAs and the proteins they encode are hereafter referred to as PAP-2a, -2b, and -2c. An open reading frame containing the complete cDNA sequence of hPAP-2a was constructed from overlapping ESTs, and a complete cDNA was amplified from reverse-transcribed HL-60 cell cDNA by polymerase chain reaction using primers with the sequences 5′-GCTCTAGAACCATGTTTGACAAGACGCGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAGCCCGGGCTCGGCACCCTGCTG-3′ (reverse) using standard methodology (21Frohman M.A. PCR Methods and Applications. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: s40-s57Google Scholar). The cDNA was ligated into pGEM-7ZF. One of the ESTs identified (accession number U79294) appeared to contain a complete open reading frame encoding hPAP-2b. This EST was obtained from the IMAGE Consortium, and the hPAP-2b cDNA was sequenced by a combination of manual sequencing using Sequenase 2.0 and automated sequencing performed in the center for analysis of macromolecules at Stony Brook. An open reading frame containing the complete cDNA sequence of hPAP-2c was constructed from overlapping ESTs, and a complete cDNA was amplified from reverse-transcribed HeLa cDNA using primers with the sequences 5′-GGTTCTAGAACCATGCAGCGGAGGTGGGTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGGGGATCCCCTCAGGAGGAGGAGTGCGGG-3′ (reverse) using standard methodologies (21Frohman M.A. PCR Methods and Applications. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: s40-s57Google Scholar). The cDNA was ligated into pGEM7ZF and sequenced by a combination of manual sequencing using Sequenase 2.0 and automated sequencing performed in the center for analysis of macromolecules at Stony Brook. hPAP-2a, -2b, and -2c cDNAs were subcloned into pCGN, which is a cytomegalovirus-based vector for expression of proteins with an NH2-terminal HA epitope tag. HEK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. 35-mm diameter lysine-coated dishes of 50% confluent cells were transfected with 1 μg of pCGN hPAP-2a, pCGN hPAP-2b, or pCGN hPAP-2c using lipofectamine in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). The transfection medium was removed after 24 h and replaced with complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were harvested 24 h later by washing in phosphate-buffered saline followed by scraping into ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysate was disrupted by sonication on ice with a probe-type sonicator, and the material was used in assays within 24–48 h as described below. In some cases, the lysate obtained was fractionated into total membrane and cytosolic fractions by centrifugation at 30,000 × g at 4 °C. The membrane fraction was resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer by vortexing. The PAP-2a, -2b, and -2c cDNAs were subcloned into pFastBac (Life Technologies, Inc.), and recombinant baculoviruses were generated by sequential transformation of DH10Bac cells, isolation of recombinant bacmids, and transfection of Sf9 cells using Cellfectin reagent. Recombinant baculoviruses were selected and propagated using standard procedures to generate high titer stocks (22O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Lucklow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 107-180Google Scholar). Monolayers of exponentially growing insect cells cultured in complete Grace's medium containing antibiotics, antimycotics, 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with lactalbumin and Yeastolate (generally 20 × 106cells in a 225-cm2 flask) were infected with recombinant baculoviruses for expression of the PAP enzymes or of a control protein (PLD2) at a multiplicity of 10. The cells were cultured for 48 h at 27 °C. For assays using intact insect cells, the monolayer of cells was carefully washed with unsupplemented Grace's medium, and the cells were dislodged by gentle pipetting and transferred to a 50-ml conical centrifuge tube. The intact cells were sedimented by centrifugation at 100 × g for 10 min at room temperature and resuspended in unsupplemented Grace's medium. The cells were kept at 27 °C and used within 6 h of isolation. Where indicated, for determinations of total lactate dehydrogenase or PAP activity, these cells were disrupted by sonication on ice (see below), and the sonicated material was kept on ice before use. For studies using Sf9 cell membranes or detergent-extracted membrane proteins, the monolayers of infected cells were washed gently with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by the addition of 4 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer and scraping. The cell suspension was transferred to a 15-ml conical tube, and the cells were disrupted by sonication (Vertis Systems Sonifier), 10 10-s pulses on ice. The disrupted cells were centrifuged at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The cytosolic fraction was removed, and the membrane fraction was resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer. Detergent extracts were prepared from the membranes by the addition of Triton X-100 and β-d-octylglucopyranoside to final concentrations of 1% followed by incubation at 4 °C with constant rocking for 1 h. The solubilized material was centrifuged at 26,000 × gat 4 °C for 30 min, and the supernatant was removed. [32P]PA, C1P, and LPA were prepared by phosphorylation of DG, C8 ceramide, or monooleoylglycerol (Avanti Polar Lipids) using Escherichia coli DG kinase (Calbiochem) and [γ-32P]ATP (ICN) (11Waggoner D.W. Gomez-Munoz A. Dewald J. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16506-16509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The reactions were terminated by extraction with acidified CHCl3 and MeOH, and the dried organic phases obtained were resuspended in 0.4 ml of 20:9:1 CHCl3/MeOH/H2O (solvent A) and neutralized by the addition of a small volume of 20% NH4OH in MeOH. This material was applied to an Econosil NH2 5U high pressure liquid chromatography column (250 × 4.2 mm) (Alltech Associates). The column was washed with 20 ml of solvent A and then eluted with a 40-ml linear gradient of 0–1m ammonium acetate in solvent A. 0.5-ml fractions of the eluant were collected, and associated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. 32P-Labeled products were pooled and extracted from the eluant by the addition of 3 mHCl and CHCl3 to give two phases. [32P]PA and [32P]C1P prepared in this way were dried and resuspended in a small volume of solvent A. The lipids were stored at −20 °C until use. [32P]S1P was prepared by acid hydrolysis of [32P]C1P and purified by thin layer chromatography on silica gel plates (11Waggoner D.W. Gomez-Munoz A. Dewald J. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16506-16509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) or by phosphorylation of sphingosine using Swiss 3T3 cells as a source of sphingosine kinase (23Olivera A. Rosenthal J. Spiegel S. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled material was identified by autoradiography, the silica was scraped from the plate, and lipids were eluted by the addition of acidified CHCl3/MeOH. The eluted material was stored at −20 °C. Dipalmitoyl PA was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. Unlabeled C8 C1P and S1P were obtained from Biomol Inc. Sphingosine was from Avanti Polar lipids. The assay procedures used were adapted from those described by others (6Waggoner D.W. Martin A. Dewald J. Gomez-Munoz A. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19422-19429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 7Kanoh H. Imai S-I. Yamada K. Sakane F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25309-25314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, assays were performed in medium containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mmEGTA, and 2 mm EDTA, and in some cases the MgCl2 concentration of the assay medium was varied by the addition of MgCl2 as indicated. C1P and S1P were stored as 1 mg/ml solutions in 1 mm Triton X-100.32P-Labeled lipid substrates were dried under vacuum and resuspended in 6.4 mm Triton X-100. Unlabeled PA was mixed with the radiolabeled substrate before drying and resuspension, while C1P and S1P were added to appropriate dried radiolabeled substrates from stock solutions in Triton X-100. In some experiments, dodecyl β-D-maltoside was substituted for Triton X-100. The substrates were dispersed by bath sonication and vortexing. Unless otherwise noted, the assay volume was 100 μl, and each assay contained final concentrations of 3.2 mm Triton X-100 and 100 μm32P-labeled lipid substrate. For investigations of the dependence of enzyme activity on the surface concentration of substrate, the substrate concentration was 100 μm, and the detergent concentration was varied as indicated. Transfected cell fractions, Sf9 cell fractions, or detergent-extracted membrane proteins (generally 0.1–5 μg of protein) were added directly to these incubations. In some cases, the source of PAP activity was incubated with 5 mm NEM at 37 °C before addition to the incubations. Assays were performed at 37 °C and were terminated by the addition of ice-cold 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 10% trichloroacetic acid. The samples were centrifuged for 5 min in a microcentrifuge, and [32P]PO42− released into the supernatant was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. This assay was validated by demonstrating that the water-soluble radioactivity released from the substrates was [32P]PO42− by quantitative extraction with ammonium molybdate. For assays of PAP activity using intact Sf9 cells, [32P]dipalmitoyl-PA (approximately 10,000 dpm) was resuspended in unsupplemented Grace's medium containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to a final concentration of 20 mm by bath sonication. Assays were initiated by adding 1 ml of this substrate preparation to 1 ml of cells (generally 400 × 103cells) and incubation at 37 °C with constant shaking. Aliquots of the suspension were removed at various times for determination of PAP activity by measurement of [32P]PO42− release as described above. In some cases, samples were removed for determination of lactate dehydrogenase activity. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotting, and protein determinations were performed as described previously (24Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K. Gu Q. Cook S., S. Nozawa Y. Prestwich G.D. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3860-3868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Lactate dehydrogenase activity was determined as described (25Lindau M. Gomperts B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 429-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Inorganic [32P]PO42− was determined by extraction with ammonium molybdate (26Martin J.B. Doty D.M. Anal. Chem. 1949; 21: 965-967Crossref Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows an alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of hPAP-2a, -2b, and -2c. PAP-2a comprises 289 amino acids corresponding to a protein of 32,788 kDa. PAP-2b comprises 311 amino acids corresponding to a protein of 35,120 kDa. PAP-2c comprises 288 amino acids corresponding to a protein of 32,577 kDa. PAP-2c is 54% identical to PAP-2a and 43% identical to PAP-2b. These values increase to 68 and 54%, respectively, when conservative amino acid substitutions are accounted for. It is notable that in comparison with PAP-2a and -2c, PAP-2b contains an extended N terminus with an enrichment of basic amino acid residues. The C-terminal 40 amino acids of the three proteins are also highly divergent. All three proteins contain a single consensus site for N-linked glycosylation (residue 140 in PAP-2c). Hydropathy analysis of all three sequences suggests that PAP-2a, -2b, and -2c are integral membrane proteins with six membrane-spanning regions of 17–25 hydrophobic amino acid residues. These sequences areunderlined in Fig. 1 and denoted as regionsI–VI. Mutagenesis of rat PAP-2b supports this putative transmembrane topology (15Barila D. Plateroti M. Nobili F. Muda A.O. Xie Y. Morimoto T. Perozzi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29928-29936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We expressed PAP-2a, -2b, and -2c as HA epitope-tagged proteins by transient transfection of HEK293 cells using a cytomegalovirus promoter-based vector. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection. PAP activity was determined in lysates of control and transfected cells using PA as substrate. The cells expressing PAP-2a, -2b, and -2c exhibited 7-, 15-, and 7-fold increases in membrane-associated PAP activity, respectively (Fig.2 A). Total protein from the transfected cells was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% gel and analyzed by Western blotting using the HA epitope-specific 12CA-5 monoclonal antibody. In comparison with samples from untransfected cells, major immunoreactive proteins with estimated molecular masses of 33 and 37 kDa, 34 kDa, and 34 and 33 kDa were detected in cells expressing PAP-2a, -2b, and 2c, respectively (Fig. 2 B). The immunoreactive material of higher molecular weight observed in the case of PAP-2a and -2c presumably represents the glycosylated forms of the proteins. We found that immunoreactive species of lower mobility could be partially converted to the faster migrating species upon treatment of membrane extracts withN-glycanase prior to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. PAP-2b also contains a consensus site for N-linked glycosylation, and we occasionally observed a minor immunoreactive species of higher molecular weight upon expression of this cDNA in COS-7 and HEK293 cells (not shown). It is unclear why comparatively higher levels of activity were observed in the pCGN PAP-2b transfected cells. It is possible that PAP-2b has an intrinsic higher specific activity than the other enzymes under the assay conditions we used or that this enzyme is differentially regulated in a manner that produces a specific increase in activity relative to the other enzymes. Recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells have proved to be an effective system for studying the regulation of integral membrane signaling proteins including adenylyl cylase isoforms and G-protein-coupled receptors (27Butkerait P. Zheng Y. Hallak H. Graham T.E. Miller H.A. Burris K.D. Molinoff P.B. Manning D.R. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In comparison with the transient transfection studies described above, this approach also provides a simple and consistent means to produce recombinant protein that is necessary for detailed investigations of the catalytic properties of these enzymes. Recombinant baculoviruses for expression of PAP-2a, -2b, and -2c were prepared and monolayer cultures of insect cells infected with these viruses and a virus expressing a control protein (murine PLD2) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection and fractionated into cytosolic and membrane fractions. PAP activity in these fractions was determined using PA as substrate. In comparison with control cells, cells expressing PAP-2a, -2b, and -2c exhibited dramatic (1140-, 540-, and 460-fold) increases in membrane-associated PAP activity (TableI). Cytosolic PAP activity was unaltered in cells expressing PAPs-2a, -2b, and -2c. PAP activity could be effectively extracted from the Sf9 cell membranes by a combination of 1% Triton X-100 and 1% β-d-octylglucopyranoside. This procedure routinely solubilized 70–80% of PAP-2a, -2b, and -2c activity and approximately 30% of total membrane protein. Type 2 PAP activities are characteristically independent of Mg2+ and insensitive to inhibition by NEM. Our standard assay medium contains 2 mmEDTA and no added Mg2+. Activity of the extracted PAP-2a, -2b, and -2c was unchanged by the addition of MgCl2 to the assays to give a Mg2+ concentration of 5 mm. Similarly, preincubation of the extracted material with 5 mm NEM produced very modest decreases in PAP-2a, -2b, and -2c activity (Table I). Baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells are therefore an excellent model system for investigating the catalytic properties of recombinantly expressed PAP-2 enzymes.Table IExpression of PAP-2a, -2b, and -2c in insect cells using baculovirus vectorsPAP activityControlPAP-2aPAP-2bPAP-2cpmol/min/mg proteinMembrane0.05 ±"

This activity was stimulated by K+ ions and was inhibited by Na+ ions and pyrophosphate analogs, as is the plant activity.

The organelles in this fraction appeared by electron microscopy to consist mainly of acidocalcisomes (acidic calcium storage organelles). This identification was confirmed by x-ray microanalysis. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy indicated that the V-H+-PPase was located in the plasma membrane and acidocalcisomes of the three different forms of the parasite. Pyrophosphate was able to drive calcium uptake in permeabilized T. cruzi. This uptake depended upon a proton gradient and was reversed by a specific V-H+-PPase inhibitor.

Mitochondria possess a proton-pumping (H+-)PPase that may be dimeric (16Lundin M. Deopujari S.W. Lichko L. Pereira da Silva L. Baltscheffsky H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and is oriented to pump protons out into the cytosol (17Pereira da Silva L. Sherman M. Lundin M. Baltscheffsky H. Arch. Biochem.

A PPase has been purified from chloroplast thylakoids but has not been shown to be involved in H+ pumping (19Jiang S.S. Fan L.L. Yang S.J. Kuo S.Y. Pan R.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 346: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Plant vacuoles, including those from charophyte algae and Acetabularia, have a monomeric H+-PPase that functions to acidify vacuoles (20Rea P.A. Poole R.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 157-180Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar,21Zhen R.-G. Kim E.J. Rea P.A. Adv. Bot. Res. 1997; 25: 297-337Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and may be related to the H+-PPase present in the chromatophores of phototrophic bacteria (21Zhen R.-G. Kim E.J. Rea P.A. Adv. Bot.

Commun. 1991; 181: 962-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). H+-PPases may also be present in the plasma membrane of some plant cells (23Long A.R. Williams L.E. Nelson S.J. Hall J.L. J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 146: 629-638Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar,24Robinson D.G. Haschke H.-P. Hinz G. Hoh B. Maeshima M. Marty F. Planta. 1996; 198: 95-103Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). An apparently vacuolar-type (V-) H+-PPase activity has been detected in rat liver Golgi fractions (25Brightman A.O. Navas P. Minnifield N.M. Morré D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1104: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), but the physiological significance of this activity has been questioned on the grounds of low cytosolic pyrophosphate concentrations in this tissue (20Rea P.A. Poole R.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 157-180Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar).PPase activity has been little studied in trypanosomatids, although Michels et al. (26Michels P.A.M. Chevalier N. Opperdoes F.R. Rider M.H. Rigden D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 698-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) briefly reported the presence of PPase activity at pH 8.4 in the cytosolic fraction of T. bruceiand acidic PPase activity associated with lysosomal and flagellar pocket fractions. It was not clear if these PPase activities were distinguished from general phosphatase activity. Here we demonstrate that T. cruzi possesses a V-H+-PPase that, like the plant enzyme, is stimulated by K+ and inhibited by Na+ and pyrophosphate analogs and that is located in acidocalcisomes and plasma membranes.RESULTSV-H+-PPase activity was detected in filipin-permeabilized epimastigotes of T. cruzi using an acridine orange uptake assay in which decrease in absorbance (493–530 nm) indicates increasing vesicular acidity (4Docampo R. Scott D.A. Vercesi A.E. Moreno S.N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 27Palmgren M.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). The vesicle pH was neutralized, and acridine orange was released by the K+(Na+)/H+ exchanger nigericin in K+ or Na+ buffers. Replacement of KCl (Fig. 1,traces d and e) with NaCl (trace c) or choline chloride (trace b) in the assay buffer reduced the acidification rate.Pyrophosphate-induced acidification was inhibited by potassium fluoride and the pyrophosphate analogs imidodiphosphate and AMDP (Fig.2 a). It was not inhibited by 250 nm concanamycin A (5 nm totally inhibits the T. cruzi V-H+-ATPase (35Scott D.A. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)) nor 1 mm sodium molybdate, which inhibits T. cruzialkaline phosphatase 2D. A.

J. 1998; 331: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) nor by the mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor, oligomycin, at 2.5 μm.V-H+-PPase activity was detected by acridine orange assay in amastigotes and trypomastigotes of T. cruzi; this activity was inhibited by 20 μm AMDP as indicated by acridine orange release (Fig. 3).Figure 3V-H+-PPase activity in T. cruzi amastigotes (a) and trypomastigotes (b), assayed by acridine orange uptake. KCl/sucrose buffer was used, as in Fig. 1. In both cases, data were corrected for steadily rising background rates by subtraction of data points for control assays without pyrophosphate addition, using Microsoft Excel. Additions, as indicated: 0.1 mm pyrophosphate (PP), 20 μm AMDP, 3 μm nigericin (NIG). Data are representative of four (amastigote) or five (trypomastigote) experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The effects of K+ and Na+ concentration on H+-PPase activity in epimastigotes were examined in more detail (Fig. 4 a). A series of buffers with varied proportions of KCl, NaCl, and sucrose were used, and acidification rates were measured as a proportion of the rate with standard KCl-sucrose buffer (Buffer 9). Replacement of KCl with NaCl (compare Buffers 11, 10, 6, 4, and 2) led to reduced rates when the concentration of NaCl exceeded that of KCl, whereas partial replacement of KCl with sucrose (Buffers 11, 9, 8, and 5) did not reduce the rate, suggesting that NaCl at high concentrations was inhibitory. Total replacement of KCl by sucrose (Buffer 3) yielded reduced activity. Buffer 12 (with 10 mm extra KCl compared with Buffer 11) was included to show the system was not sensitive to slight differences in tonicity between KCl and sucrose buffers.PPase was also assayed in membrane preparations of T. cruziby inorganic phosphate detection using purine nucleoside phosphorylase and 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside as co-substrate with phosphate for purine nucleoside phosphorylase (28Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The effects of inhibitors on epimastigote activity in these assays (Fig.2 b) were substantially similar to their effects upon H+-PPase activity (Fig. 2 a), although there was a minor component of PPase (or phosphatase) activity that was not inhibited by concentrations of the inhibitors that totally inhibited the H+-PPase activity. The activity in epimastigotes was inhibited by 20 μm AMDP (which totally inhibits proton-pumping activity, Fig. 2 a) by 87 ± 2% (average ±S.D. of nine experiments). It was assumed that the uninhibited activity was not due to the V-type PPase, and therefore, in comparing the effects of buffers on PPase as measured by phosphate release (Fig.4 b), activity that was not inhibited by 20 μmAMDP was discounted. Allowing for this, the effects of buffer modifications on PPase (phosphate release assay) were similar to those found using the acridine orange assay (Fig. 4 a). The slight differences in results observed using the two assays (e.g.with Buffers 6 and 7) may be real, as the degree of coupling of proton pumping and pyrophosphate hydrolysis may vary in different buffers. Inclusion of 13 μm nigericin in the (phosphate detection) assay mixture stimulated activity by 0–44%, indicating a variable preservation or generation of sealed vesicles in the membrane preparations (30Rea P.A. Turner J.C. Methods Plant Biochem. 1990; 3: 385-405Crossref Google Scholar) (5 μm gramicidin D or 3 μm each carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone and valinomycin gave similar effects). Use of this assay allowed a quantitative comparison between different life-cycle stages of T. cruzi. Specific activities in membrane preparations of epimastigotes, amastigotes, and trypomastigotes were, respectively, 0.21 ± 0.11, 0.20 ± 0.04, and 0.09 ± 0.05 μmol of pyrophosphate consumed/min/mg of protein (means ±S.D. of results from 4, 3, and 3 separate experiments, respectively).To further demonstrate that phosphate release assays and acridine orange assays were detecting the same PPase activity and to study the subcellular location of the enzyme, extracts of epimastigotes were separated on Percoll gradients (Fig. 5). PPase, as assayed by both methods, was concentrated toward the bottom (dense end) of the gradient (fraction 1), with a smaller peak in the middle of the gradient (fraction 9). Markers for other compartments all peaked further up the gradient in the region of fractions 8–10, except for the cytosolic marker glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which, as expected, was fairly evenly spread through the gradient. The average amount of each organelle marker found in fraction 1 was under 5% of the total recovered (activity) of that marker, compared with 19 or 22% of pyrophosphatase activity, as measured by H+ uptake or phosphate release, respectively.Figure 5Distribution of PPase activity from T. cruzi epimastigotes on Percoll density gradients. PPase is concentrated in a distinct, dense fraction. V-H+-PPase activity measured by proton uptake (acridine orange assay) or phosphate release was compared with the distribution of established organelle markers: succinate cytochrome c reductase (mitochondrion), α-mannosidase (lysosome), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (cytosol), hexokinase (glycosome), and surface fluoresceination (plasma membrane). Charts show mean ±S.D. activity (as % total recovered activity) from 3–4 independent experiments. Density was measured in a single experiment using Percoll density marker beads.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Examination of the densest fraction (fraction 1) from Percoll gradients by electron microscopy showed round, electron-dense organelles of varying size, up to 200 μm in diameter (Fig.6 a). These were similar to (if somewhat smaller than) the dense organelles found in whole epimastigotes (Fig. 6 b and Fig. 2 in Ref. 14Scott D.A. Docampo R. Dvorak J.A. Shi S. Leapman R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28020-28029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), which ranged in size up to 300 μm. These organelles were previously identified as acidocalcisomes (14Scott D.A. Docampo R. Dvorak J.A. Shi S. Leapman R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28020-28029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To confirm this, x-ray microanalysis was performed on the fraction 1 preparation (Fig. 6, c andd). Analysis of dense organelles (Fig. 6 c) yielded spectra characteristic of acidocalcisomes. The spectrum shown was the one that yielded the most counts in 100 s (out of 11 spectra obtained), but all the other spectra taken from dense organelles were qualitatively similar: counts for phosphorus were about 2-fold greater than counts for magnesium, which were about 4-fold greater than counts for calcium. Zinc was detectable as a trace in only a few spectra. These peaks were not present in a spectrum taken from the fraction 1 sample background (Fig. 6 d). Peaks for copper and silicon arise from the grid and traces of Percoll in the specimen, respectively. Note the different scales in Fig. 6, c andd.Figure 6The dense, PPase-containing fraction consists of acidocalcisomes. Direct observation of Percoll fraction 1 by electron microscopy (a).

Antibody 326 showed cross-reactivity with a band of 64 kDa present in T. cruzi (Fig. 7,Panel A, lane a). No background staining was observed when normal serum was used as a control (Fig. 7, Panel A, lane b). A 64-kDa band was also seen in fractions 1–2 from Percoll gradients, corresponding to the major peak of H+-PPase activity (Fig. 7, Panel B,cf. Fig. 5). This ran in the same position as the immunoreactive polypeptide from a red beet membrane preparation, which has a Mr of 64.5 kDa (32Rea P.A. Britten C.J. Sarafian V. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 723-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7, Panel B, B). Strong reaction to the antibody was also seen in fractions 8–10, although here the bands were of somewhat lower molecular weight. Immunofluorescence indicated labeling of cytoplasmic structures generally found in the posterior and central regions of epimastigotes and cell surface, including the flagellum (Fig.8, a). Intracellular amastigotes were intensely stained. Careful examination revealed labeling of the amastigote surface and a large number of small cytoplasmic structures mainly located toward the periphery of the cell (Fig. 8, b). No fluorescence was observed in control parasites incubated only in the presence of the secondary fluorescein-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG or with pre-immune serum (not shown) or in the host cells (Fig. 8, b). Immunoelectron microscopy using anti-V-H+-PPase antibody (antibody 324; similar results were obtained with antibody 326) confirmed labeling of the cell surface and intracellular vacuoles (Fig.9). Gold particles (small arrowheads) associated with the membrane lining the cell body, the flagellum (F) and the flagellar pocket (FP) of amastigotes (Fig. 9 A), trypomastigotes (Fig. 9 B), and epimastigotes (Fig. 9 C). The reaction was very strong with the amastigote surface membrane (Fig. 9 A). Intracellular vacuoles were also labeled on the luminal face of membranes (Figs. 9, A–E). In some cases, these vacuoles contained electron-dense material occupying part of their interior (Fig. 9, B–D, big arrowheads), typical of acidocalcisomes (13Lu H.-G. Zhong L. de Souza W.

Hermann T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5892-5894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), unless organellar acidity was first neutralized, e.g. by use of nigericin (4Docampo R. Scott D.A. Vercesi A.E. Moreno S.N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Calcium uptake into the acidocalcisome or into nonacidic compartments in permeabilized trypanosomes may therefore be studied by pretreatment with ionomycin or nigericin, respectively (4Docampo R. Scott D.A. Vercesi A.E. Moreno S.N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 6Scott D.A. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We found that pyrophosphate can drive calcium uptake into the acidocalcisome in digitonin-permeabilized T. cruzi epimastigotes (Fig.10, panel a, trace a), but not into the nonacidic compartment (panel b,trace a). Pyrophosphate-dependent calcium uptake was inhibited by AMDP (panel a, trace b). For comparison, we show ATP-driven Ca2+ uptake assays under the same conditions. H+/Ca2+ exchanger assays (panel a, trace c; panel b,trace b) included 20 μm AMDP to block pyrophosphatase activity and 200 μm o-vanadate to inhibit Ca2+-ATPase activity (4Docampo R. Scott D.A. Vercesi A.E. Moreno S.N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The vacuolar H+-ATPase inhibitor concanamycin A (37Dröse S. Altendorf K. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) inhibited Ca2+ uptake into the acidic (panel a,trace c) but not into the nonacidic compartment (panel b, trace b). We also ran reactions without preaddition of inhibitors (panel a, traces d ande; panel b, traces c andd). Under these conditions Ca2+-ATPase activity predominates (4Docampo R. Scott D.A. Vercesi A.E. Moreno S.N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), as shown by the failure of AMDP to block activity, in contrast to total inhibition by 200 μm o-vanadate. We were unable to detect pyrophosphate-driven Ca2+ uptake into Percoll fractions, possibly because free [Ca2+] was too high. In permeabilized epimastigotes, H+-PPase activity was inhibited by the inclusion of 100 μm CaCl2 in the assay buffer by 25 ± 1% (average ±S.D. of three experiments).Figure 10Pyrophosphate can drive Ca2+uptake into compartments of permeabilized T. cruziepimastigotes. Comparison with ATP-driven uptake is shown. Assays in panel a included 1.6 μmionomycin; assays in panel b included 5 μmnigericin. The decrease in absorbance indicates Ca2+uptake. The assays shown in panel a, traces a andb, and panel b, trace a, included 5 nm concanamycin A and 200 μm o-vanadate. Assays in panel a, trace c, and panel b, trace b, included 20 μm AMDP and 200 μm o-vanadate. These ionophores and inhibitors were added 3.5 min before the start of assays. Other additions during the course of assays are 0.1 mm pyrophosphate (PP), 1 mm ATP, 20 μm AMDP, 5 nm concanamycin A (CCA), 200 μm o-vanadate (VAN). Nigericin (NIG, 5 μm) or ionomycin (ION, 1.6 μm) were added after 8 min in assays in panel a or panel b, respectively, to fully release compartmentalized Ca2+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONAfter our initial discovery of pyrophosphate-induced organelle acidification in T. cruzi epimastigotes (Fig. 1), we compared the properties of this apparent V-H+-PPase activity with those of the well studied V-H+-PPase of plants. Three inhibitors of the plant enzyme were all effective against the trypanosomal activity (Fig. 2). KF inhibited proton uptake with an I50 of 1–2 mm, and phosphate release with an I50 of 2–5 mm. The former value is the same as found for the V-H+-PPase of oat roots (38Wang Y. Leigh R.A. Kaestner K.H. Sze H. Plant Physiol. 1986; 81: 497-502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas mung bean hypocotyl V-H+-PPase has an I50 for fluoride of 5 mm (39Maeshima M. Yoshida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20068-20073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The T. cruzi activity, measured by H+ uptake, was completely inhibited at this concentration, as is the V-H+-PPase of Ricinuscotyledons (40Long A.R. Hall J.L. Williams L.E. J. Plant Physiol. 1997; 151: 16-24Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The I50 values for AMDP and imidodiphosphate for T. cruzi activity were approximately 5 μm (2 μm by phosphate release assay) and 50 μm, respectively (Fig. 2), similar to those found for red beet V-H+-PPase (respectively 3.6 and 24 μm; Ref. 41Zhen R.-G. Baykov A.A. Bakuleva N.P. Rea P.A. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).In plants, V-H+-PPase activity has been shown to be K+-stimulated; substitution of K+ with Na+ in assay buffers leads to a 50–100% reduction in activity (30Rea P.A. Turner J.C. Methods Plant Biochem. 1990; 3: 385-405Crossref Google Scholar, 38Wang Y. Leigh R.A. Kaestner K.H. Sze H. Plant Physiol. 1986; 81: 497-502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Long A.R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6725-6728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this dependence differentiates V-H+-PPase from known mitochondrial H+-PPases that do not require K+ (16Lundin M.

We found that the T. cruzi activity was weak in Na+ buffers compared with K+ buffers, and there was no activity in the presence of choline (Figs. 1 and 4). Use of buffers containing various proportions of K+, Na+, and sucrose (Fig. 4) indicated that Na+was inhibitory where its concentration exceeded that of K+and also indicated that proton-pumping (Fig. 4 a) and phosphate-release (Fig. 4 b) assays were detecting the sam"
https://openalex.org/W1960540789,"Potential toxicity from exposure to mercury vapor (Hg(o)) from dental amalgam fillings is the subject of current public health debate in many countries. We evaluated potential central nervous system (CNS) toxicity associated with handling Hg-containing amalgam materials among dental personnel with very low levels of Hg(o) exposure (i.e., urinary Hg <4 microg/l), applying a neurobehavioral test battery to evaluate CNS functions in relation to both recent exposure and Hg body burden. New distinctions between subtle preclinical effects on symptoms, mood, motor function, and cognition were found associated with Hg body burden as compared with those associated with recent exposure. The pattern of results, comparable to findings previously reported among subjects with urinary Hg >50 microg/l, presents convincing new evidence of adverse behavioral effects associated with low Hg(o) exposures within the range of that received by the general population."

We have purified the fission yeast Cdc7 homologue Hsk1 approximately 30,000-fold, to near homogeneity. Purified Hsk1 has protein kinase activity on several substrates and is capable of autophosphorylation. Point mutations in highly conserved regions of Hsk1 inactivate the kinase in vitro and in vivo. Overproduction of two of the mutant hsk1 alleles blocks initiation of DNA replication and deranges the mitotic checkpoint, a phenotype consistent with a role for Hsk1 in the early stages of initiation. The purified Hsk1 kinase can be separated into two active forms, a Hsk1 monomer and a heterodimer consisting of Hsk1 complexed with a co-purifying polypeptide, Dfp1. Association with Dfp1 stimulates phosphorylation of exogenous substrates but has little effect on autokinase activity. We have identified Dfp1 as the fission yeast homologue of budding yeast Dbf4. Purified Hsk1 phosphorylates the Cdc19 (Mcm2) subunit of the six-member minichromosome maintenance protein complex purified from fission yeast. Since minichromosome maintenance proteins have been implicated in the initiation of DNA replication, the essential function of Hsk1 at the G1/S transition may be mediated by phosphorylation of Cdc19.

CDC7 encodes a cell cycle-regulated protein kinase whose activity peaks at the G1/S transition, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation analysis (10Hollingsworth R.E. Sclafani R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Gene. 1998; 211: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) indicates that regulation of initiation by Cdc7-family proteins may be a conserved feature of eukaryotic DNA replication. Strong candidates for targets of Cdc7 kinases at the G1/S transition are the members of the MCM family of proteins. The MCM family has six members, all of which are essential proteins that function in DNA replication (reviewed in Ref. 20Kearsey S.E. Maiorano D. Holmes E.C. Todorov I.T. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These proteins form heteromeric complexes that interact with chromatin and replication origins in vivo (5Coleman T.R.

Cell. 1995; 81: 601-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Several lines of experimental evidence link Cdc7 function with that of the MCM proteins. First, an allele of mcm5 in budding yeast is a bypass suppressor of cdc7 and dbf4 mutants (26Hardy C.F.J. Dryga O. Seematter S. Pahl P.M.B. Sclafani R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3151-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Second, immunoprecipitates of human Cdc7 protein phosphorylate Mcm2 and Mcm3 fusion proteins purified from bacteria (17Sato N. Arai K.-I. Masai H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4340-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Finally, budding yeast Cdc7/Dbf4 expressed in insect cells phosphorylates GST-Mcm2, -Mcm3, -Mcm4, and -Mcm6 fusion proteins in vitro (27Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Young M.R. Kihara M. Sugino A. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3365-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Although these data are consistent with the possibility that Cdc7 kinase may phosphorylate one or more MCM subunits at G1/S, heteromeric MCM complexes have not yet been directly tested as substrates. Although the importance of Cdc7 kinase for progression into S phase is clear, the nature of the requirement for Cdc7 is unclear, and the relevant substrates of the Cdc7 kinase at G1/S are unknown. In the present study we describe the purification of Hsk1 from fission yeast. Purified Hsk1 contains kinase and autokinase activity, and this activity depends on the presence of highly conserved protein kinase sequence motifs. A subset of mutant hsk1 alleles displays a dominant-negative phenotype, including accumulation of G1cells, indicating a role for hsk1 + in regulating the G1/S transition. The purified Hsk1 kinase contained a second polypeptide, Dfp1. The Dfp1 polypeptide is homologous to budding yeast Dbf4 and forms a heterodimeric complex with Hsk1. The presence of Dfp1 stimulates Hsk1 kinase phosphorylation of exogenous substrates but has no effect on autokinase activity. We tested the ability of purified Hsk1 kinase to phosphorylate the six-member MCM complex purified from fission yeast and found that Cdc19 (Mcm2) was specifically phosphorylated. The essential function of Hsk1 in entry into S phase may therefore be mediated by phosphorylation of Cdc19 (Mcm2). The phosphorylation of Cdc19 and other critical substrates of Hsk1 kinase is likely regulated by association with a Dbf4-like co-factor. Basic fission yeast genetic and molecular biology techniques were used (28Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Edinburgh minimal medium plus required supplements. The fission yeast strain GBY358 expresses Hsk1 fused at the COOH terminus to six histidines and three hemagglutinin (HA) epitopes (29Field J. Nikawa J.-I. Broek D. MacDonald B. Rodgers L. Wilson I.A. Lerner R.A. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2159-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar) and was constructed as follows. The hsk1 + open reading frame was amplified using PCR of S. pombe cDNA and cloned into pSLF172 (30Forsburg S.L. Sherman D.A. Gene. 1997; 191: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) to give pSLF172-hsk1. The first 575 base pairs of the hsk1 + open reading frame, thenmt1 + promoter, and the ars1sequences were removed from pSLF172-hsk1 by restriction enzyme cleavage and re-ligation. A six histidine-encoding NotI linker was inserted between the hsk1 + ORF and the 3HA tag. The resulting plasmid was linearized near the middle of the remaininghsk1 + sequences with XhoI and introduced into an h− leu1–32 ura4-D18 ade6-M210 strain. ura + transformants were selected, and a strain with a single integration at the hsk1+ locus was identified by southern hybridization analysis. The only copy of hsk1 in GBY358 is the tagged copy, indicating that Hsk1–6His-3HA is functional. Overexpression of wild-type and mutant hsk1–3HA for immunoprecipitations, kinase assays, and phenotypic analysis was performed in an h− leu1–32 ura4-D18 ade6-M210 strain carrying pSLF172-hsk1 (either wild-type hsk1–3HA (strain GBY276) or the indicated point mutants). Point mutations in pSLF172-hsk1 were generated using QuickChange PCR (Stratagene). Transformants were isolated in the presence of 5 μg/ml thiamine, and expression was induced by the removal of thiamine as described (31Brown G.W. Jallepalli P.V. Huneycutt B.J. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6142-6147Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). GBY357, the diploid strain carrying a disruption of hsk1+, has the genotype h+ /h− leu1–32/leu1–32 ura4-D18/ura4-D18 ade6-M210/ade6-M216 hsk1+ /hsk1::ura4+ and carries a replacement of the entire hsk1+ open reading frame. A genomic clone of hsk1+, including the promoter and open reading frame, was isolated by PCR of genomic DNA and cloned into pJKars to give pJKars-hsk1. pJKars is a derivative of pJK148 (32Keeney J.B. Boeke J.D. Genetics. 1994; 136: 849-856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in which the ClaI fragment was replaced with a blunt-endedEcoRI fragment containing S. pombe ars1 +. Site-directed mutagenesis of pJKars-hsk1 to generate single base substitution mutations was performed using QuickChange PCR (Stratagene). To test the ability of the mutanthsk1 alleles to support viability, the pJKars-hsk1 wild-type or mutant plasmids were transformed into GBY357. Diploid transformants were selected and induced to sporulate. Spores were germinated on Edinburgh minimal medium + uracil + adenine to select for haploids carrying the plasmid. Colonies were then replica plated to Edinburgh minimal medium + adenine to screen for transformants carrying thehsk1 disruption. GBY381, the strain expressing six-histidine, 3HA-tagged Cdc19, was constructed in the same manner as GBY358 (see above), with thecdc19 + open reading frame isolated by PCR of cDNA. The fission yeast homologue of S. cerevisiae DBF4 was identified by a TBLASTN search of the S. pombe genome sequence data base. 2http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/S_pombe/blast_server.shtml. The gene, which we refer to as dfp1 + (forDbf four in pombe) resides on chromosome III, cosmid c550, nucleotides 28952–30589 (locus SPCC550.13, EMBL accession number AL023592). S. pombe strain GBY396 expresses Dfp1 fused to a six-histidine, three c-myc epitope tag (33Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar) and Hsk1–6his-3HA. Thedfp1 + open reading frame was amplified by PCR of genomic DNA and cloned into the vector pJKars42X-6his3MYC. This vector is a derivative of pJKars with the medium strength nmt1promoter and a six-histidine, three-myc epitope tag flanking a multiple cloning site. This plasmid was transformed into GBY358, and transformants were isolated in the presence of thiamine. Expression of Dfp-6his-3myc was induced by the removal of thiamine as described (31Brown G.W. Jallepalli P.V. Huneycutt B.J. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6142-6147Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For flow cytometry, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol, harvested, and stained in 2 μg/ml propidium iodide in 50 mm sodium citrate. Flow cytometry was performed using a FACScan and CellQuest software (Becton-Dickinson). Fixation and staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride and calcofluor, which stain DNA and septa, respectively, was as described (28Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar). To prepare cell extracts for immunoprecipitation, 4 g of cells were resuspended in 4 ml of 2 × lysis buffer (2 × LB:100 mm HEPES, 2 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 2 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm DTT, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 40 μg/ml leupeptin, 40 μg/mll-1-chloro-3-(4-tosylamido)-7-amino-2-heptanone-HCl, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml bestatin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, pH 7.5). The suspension was transferred to two 15-ml Corex centrifuge tubes, and 0.5-mm glass beads were added to the meniscus. The cells were broken by vortexing 15 times for 30 s each, alternating with incubation on ice for 30 s. After removal of the beads by centrifugation, NaCl and Tween 20 were added to 250 mm and 0.05%, respectively. The lysate was stirred for 15 min and clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor for 30 min at 2 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad). Extract (1 mg) was incubated with 3 μg of 12CA5 anti-HA monoclonal antibody (29Field J. Nikawa J.-I. Broek D. MacDonald B. Rodgers L. Wilson I.A. Lerner R.A. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2159-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar) or 9E10 anti-myc monoclonal antibody (BAbCo) for 2 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose or protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After further incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed 4 times with 1 ml of 1 × LB plus 250 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 and twice with 1 ml of 1 × LB plus 25 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20. DNA fragments encoding amino acids 1–122 of Hsk1 and 1–830 of Cdc19 were generated by PCR and cloned into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham). The fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose as directed by the manufacturer. 50 g of GBY358 cells (which carry a single copy of hsk1–6his-3HA integrated at thehsk1 + locus) were resuspended in 50 ml of 2 × LB-EDTA-DTT (2 × LB lacking EDTA and DTT) and adjusted to a final volume of 100 ml with H2O. Cells were lysed in a DynoMill (Glen Mills) with 0.5-mm glass beads by 10 pulses of 30 s each with cooling at −10 °C. After cell lysis, NaCl and Tween 20 were added to 250 mm and 0.05%, respectively. The lysate was stirred for 15 min at 0 °C and then clarified by centrifugation in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor at 20,000 rpm for 30 min at 2 °C. The extract was adsorbed in batch to 5 ml of Talon-Sepharose (CLONTECH) for 2 h at 4 °C. The resin and extract were poured into a column, washed with 5 volumes of 1 × LB-EDTA-DTT plus 250 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and then with 5 volumes of 1 × LB-EDTA-DTT plus 250 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 5 mm imidazole. The column was eluted with 1 × LB-EDTA-DTT plus 175 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 75 mm imidazole. Fractions containing Hsk1 were identified by immunoblot analysis and were pooled. 120 μg of anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 was added, followed by gentle mixing at 4 °C for 2 h. 150 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added, and the incubation continued for 1 h. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed 4 times with 1 × WASH (20 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0). Hsk1 was eluted by the addition of 200 μl of 2 mg/ml HA.11 peptide (BAbCo) in 1 × WASH followed by incubation for 16 h at 4 °C. The eluate was recovered, and the resin was washed twice with 200 μl of 1 × WASH. The eluate and the washes were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0 (mQ buffer) plus 50 mm NaCl. The dialysate was applied to a mono Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham) and eluted with a 10-ml linear gradient of NaCl (50 to 500 mm in mQ buffer). Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and assayed for Hsk1 protein kinase activity. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad). Protein in the pooled fractions from the 12CA5 immunoaffinity and mono Q chromatography steps was quantitated by staining SDS-polyacrylamide gels with SYPRO orange and scanning on a Storm scanner according to the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Dynamics). Bovine serum albumin was used as the standard. Hsk1 in each fraction was quantitated by immunoblot analysis, detected with 12CA5, developed with Vistra chemifluoresence reagent (Amersham), and scanned on a Storm scanner. Hsk1 monomer and heterodimer were separated by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column. Native gel analysis was performed using Laemmli discontinuous gels with 0.02% Tween 20 but lacking SDS and reducing agent. Acrylamide concentrations were 6, 7.5, 9, and 10%. Native molecular weights were calculated from Ferguson plots (34Ferguson K.A. Metabolism. 1964; 13: 985-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 35Hedrick J.L. Smith A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 126: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin, catalase, and ovalbumin as standards. The MCM complex was purified from 25 g of GBY381 cells, as described (36Adachi Y. Usukura J. Yanagida M. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), except for the following changes. Talon-Sepharose was used instead of Ni2+-agarose and eluted with 75 mm imidazole. The Talon-Sepharose eluate was immunoaffinity-purified using 12CA5 and protein A-Sepharose, and the affinity-purified material was then fractionated on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column. Peak fractions from the Superdex 200 column were pooled and concentrated using a Centricon 100 microconcentrator (Amicon). Protein kinase assays contained 25 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 μm [γ32P]ATP (0.2 μCi/μl), 1 μg of substrate (except for reactions containing MCM complex, which contained approximately 25 ng), and Hsk1 (typically 10 ng) in a total volume of 25 μl. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min, stopped with 10 μl of 6× Laemmli sample buffer (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Reactions were then fractionated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and exposed to a storage phosphor screen, which was subsequently scanned on a Storm scanner (Molecular Dynamics). One unit of kinase activity incorporates 1 nmol of phosphate into substrate in 30 min at 30 °C. Images were digitally scanned or imported directly into Photoshop 4.0 (Adobe) or Canvas 5.0.3 (Deneba) on a Macintosh computer and were printed on a dye-sublimation printer. The sequence of hsk1 + contains a number of motifs typical of protein kinases. Additionally, immunoprecipitates of the homologous protein in budding yeast have been shown to have kinase activity (10Hollingsworth R.E. Sclafani R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6272-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11Yoon H.-J. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3574-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To test Hsk1 for protein kinase activity, we fused Hsk1 to a triple HA epitope tag and overexpressed the fusion protein in fission yeast (strain GBY276). Immunoprecipitates of extracts from this strain were incubated in the presence of [γ32P]ATP, and the products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig.1). A radioloabelled polypeptide was evident at the molecular weight expected for Hsk1 in the anti-HA immunoprecipitate but not when the immunoprecipitation was performed with a control antibody (419). This phosphorylated polypeptide comigrated exactly with the Hsk1 polypeptide as detected by immunoblot analysis (not shown), indicating that Hsk1 is associated with a protein kinase that can phosphorylate Hsk1. To determine whether the kinase activity is intrinsic to Hsk1, we expressed a series of mutant forms of Hsk1 and tested them for kinase activity in immunoprecipitates (Fig.2). All of the point mutations affected sites within conserved domains that have previously been shown to be important for the essential in vivo function of the budding yeast homologue of Hsk1, Cdc7 (38Buck V. White A. Rosamond J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 227: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 39Ohtoshi A. Miyake T. Arai K. Masai H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 40Sclafani R.A. Jackson A.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These included mutations in the ATP binding site (K129A), a conserved kinase domain (D216N), and a potential phosphorylation site for cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase (T291A and T291E). As shown in Fig.2 B, all mutations caused a >10-fold decrease in Hsk1-associated kinase activity (15.8-fold for K129A, >20-fold for D216N, 19.6-fold for T291A, 12.9-fold for T291E) without affecting steady-state Hsk1 levels. Since the observed kinase activity depends on these conserved domains, it is likely to be intrinsic to Hsk1. We also compared the kinase activity of immunoprecipitates from a strain that overexpresses Hsk1 from the highly active nmt1 +promoter with that from a strain carrying a single copy of thehsk1 + gene under the control of the normalhsk1 + promoter (Fig. 2 C). Kinase activity was approximately 10-fold greater in the strain overexpressing Hsk1, further suggesting that the observed kinase activity is due to the Hsk1 polypeptide.Figure 2Kinase activity of immunoprecipitates of Hsk1 point mutants and from an Hsk1 overproducing strain. A, schematic diagram of Hsk1 indicating the conserved kinase domains (shaded) as described in Masai et al. (8Masai H. Miyake T. Arai K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3094-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and the positions of the point mutations (asterisks). B, extracts (1 mg) from cells overexpressing tagged wild-type Hsk1 or the indicated Hsk1 point mutants were immunoprecipitated with 12CA5 and assayed for kinase activity. The reaction products were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. An autoradiograph (kinase) and the Coomassie Blue-stained gel (CBB) are shown. The position of Hsk1 is indicated (note that the additional bands in the stained gel correspond to bovine serum albumin and immunoglobulin heavy chain). C, extract (1 mg) from a tagged wild-type Hsk1 strain or a strain overexpressing tagged Hsk1 from the strong nmt1 +promoter was immunoprecipitated with 12CA5 and assayed for kinase activity. An autoradiograph (kinase) and immunoblot probed with 12CA5 (western) of the kinase assay products are shown. D, immunoprecipitates as in B were assayed for kinase activity using GST-Hsk11–122 as a substrate.

To be certain that the decrease in Hsk1 kinase activity observed in Fig. 2 B was not due to the removal of this site (thereby eliminating a potential kinase substrate), we tested the ability of the Hsk1 immunoprecipitates to phosphorylate a fusion protein containing the first 122 amino acids of Hsk1 fused to GST. This fusion protein is a substrate of the purified Hsk1 kinase (see Fig. 7 C, below). As shown in Fig.2 D, an Hsk1 immunoprecipitate, but not immunoprecipitates of any of the Hsk1 mutants, phosphorylates the Hsk1 fusion protein. Therefore the T291A and T291E mutations inactivate the kinase. Together these data suggest that Hsk1 possesses intrinsic protein kinase activity and is capable of autophosphorylation. We examined the phenotypic consequences of overexpressing wild-type and mutant alleles of hsk1 under the control of the strong nmt1 promoter. This promoter is activated by the removal of thiamine from the growth medium, and maximal expression occurs approximately 16 h after the removal of thiamine. Cells were examined 20 h after the removal of thiamine (Fig. 3) by microscopy and flow cytometry. Cells overexpressing hsk1 + (Fig. 3), K129A, or T291A (data not shown) were normal in appearance and had the typical 2C DNA content by flow cytometry. In contrast, the mutants D216N and T291E both contained a large percentage of cells with abn"
https://openalex.org/W2144313737,"EDG-1, an inducible G-protein-coupled receptor from vascular endothelial cells, is a high affinity receptor for sphingosine 1-phosphate (SPP) (Lee, M-J., van Brocklyn, J. R., Thangada, S., Liu, C. H., Hand, A. R., Menzeleev, R., Spiegel, S., and Hla, T. (1998) Science 279, 1552–1555). In this study, we show that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a platelet-derived bioactive lipid structurally related to SPP, is an agonist for EDG-1. LPA binds to EDG-1 receptor with an apparentKd of 2.3 μm. In addition, LPA binding to EDG-1 induces receptor phosphorylation, mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, as well as Rho-dependent morphogenesis and P-cadherin expression. These data suggest that LPA is a low-affinity agonist for EDG-1. Activation of the endothelial receptor EDG-1 by platelet-derived lipids LPA and SPP may be important in thrombosis and angiogenesis, conditions in which critical platelet-endothelial interactions occur.

EDG-1 was originally cloned as an immediate-early gene induced during the morphogenetic differentiation phase of angiogenesis (1Hla T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9308-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We subsequently demonstrated that the EDG-1 binds to heterotrimeric Gi proteins and stimulates Gi-dependent mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation (2Lee M-J. Evans M. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11272-11279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells stably transfected with theEDG-1 cDNA exhibit enhanced adherens junction-based cell-cell aggregation, exaggerated cadherin expression and were phenotypically differentiated (3Lee M-J. van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the induction of morphogenetic differentiation was ligand dependent and we demonstrated that serum-borne sphingosine 1-phosphate (SPP) is a highly potent agonist for the EDG-1 GPR. Indeed, SPP binding toEDG-1-transfected cells was reversible, saturable, specific, and exhibited a high-affinity binding site with apparentKd of 8.1 nm (3Lee M-J. van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). In addition, SPP induces morphogenetic differentiation and P-cadherin expression as well as Gi-dependent MAP kinase activation via the EDG-1 receptor (3Lee M-J. van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H.

Morphogenesis induced by SPP was inhibited by the C3 exoenzyme which specifically ADP-ribosylates the small G-protein Rho (4Reshkin S.J. Murer H. Am. J.

SPP, released from activated platelets (5Yatomi Y. Ruan F. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y.

J. 1993; 291: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar), is structurally similar to SPP. Like SPP, LPA also regulates a wide range of cellular responses, including proliferation (14Durieux M.E. Lynch K.R. Trends Pharmacol.

Commun. 1993; 193: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), among others. Moreover, it is well documented that LPA regulates these responses by activating specific G-protein-coupled receptors present on the cell surface of numerous cell types (22Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. Postma F.R. Zondag G.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Recently, EDG-2/Vzg-1 was shown to be an LPA receptor involved in cell rounding, Gi-dependent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (20Hecht J.H. Weiner J.A. Post S.R. Chun J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), and serum response factor induced transcription (23An S. Dickens M.A. Bleu T. Hallmark O. Goetzl E.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Prompted by the fact that (i) EDG-2/Vzg-1 is highly related to EDG-1 and (ii) LPA and SPP are structurally and functionally similar, we investigated in this report whether EDG-1 serves as a receptor for LPA. Phospholipases, fatty acid free BSA, LPA, lysophosphatidylinositol, lysophosphatidylserine, lysophosphatidylethanol, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin were from Sigma; [3H]LPA (specific activity 56.2 Ci/mmol) from NEN Life Science Products Inc., [32P]orthophosphate (specific activity 370 MBq/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol) from Amersham; SPP, sphingomyelin, ceramide, and ceramide 1-phosphate from Biomol; C3 exotoxin, pertussis toxin, and PD 98059 from Calbiochem; anti-P-cadherin antibody was from Transduction Laboratories; anti-M2 antibody from Eastman Kodak; rhodamine-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG from Cappel; anti-HA monoclonal antibody, endoglycosylase H, and alkaline phosphatase were from Boehringer Mannheim; G418, LipofectAMINE, and LipofectAMINE Plus reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc.; DMEM, RPMI 1640, and Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) were from Mediatech; trypsin EDTA was from JRH Bioscience; fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from HyClone; mouse mammary leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase from Life Technologies, Inc.; RNasin from Promega; Taq DNA polymerase from Cetus; and the FastTrackTM 2.0 mRNA isolation kit from Invitrogen. Culture of HEK293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573) and transfection of EDG-1 cDNA was performed as described (2Lee M-J. Evans M. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11272-11279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 3Lee M-J. van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Stably transfected cells were subcloned twice to isolate pure clones. Four independently isolated EDG-1-transfected clones and two vector transfected clones were used in this study. Morphogenetic differentiation assay of EDG-1 expressed cell clones (HEK293-EDG-1) was carried out essentially as described (3Lee M-J. van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (7.5 × 105 cells/ml) were plated into 6-well tissue culture plates (Falcon) in DMEM, 10 mm HEPES pH 7.4 containing 10% (v/v) charcoal-stripped lipid-depleted FBS (CFBS) with the indicated supplements. To examine the effect of serum-borne bioactive lipids on differentiation, FBS was treated with specific phospholipases (1 unit/500 μl) at 25 °C for 24 h. As a control, FBS was incubated with heat-denatured (95 °C for 1 h) phospholipases. The human HEL 92.1.7 erythroleukemia (ATCC TIB-180) cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. The transfection of these cells were performed with LipofectAMINE Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. HEK293 cells were grown onto fibronectin (10 μg/ml)-coated coverslips, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min, washed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells were then incubated with anti-M2 antibody (5 μg/ml in PBS containing 1% BSA) at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (10 μg/ml in PBS containing 1% BSA) for 30 min at room temperature. The EDG-1 signal was visualized by a Zeiss Axiovert 100TV fluorescence microscope. Stably transfected HEK293 cells were plated onto human fibronectin-coated (10 μg/ml, 0.5 ml/well at 37 °C for 1 h) 12-well culture plates (Falcon, 5 × 105 cells/well). Three days later, cells were washed once with binding buffer (0.1% fatty acid-free BSA in PBS, pH 7.4) and the binding assays were conducted with 0.5 ml of binding buffer containing 10 nm [3H]LPA in the presence or absence of cold competitor for 30 min at 4 °C, unless indicated in the text. Cells were then washed three times with binding buffer (0.5 ml each), solubilized with 250 μl of 1 nNaOH, 0.1% (v/v) SDS at room temperature for 1 h, and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Nonspecific binding, defined as binding which occurred in the presence of 50 μM LPA, was approximately 60% of total binding. [3H]LPA does not bind specifically to the fibronectin-coated plastic surface. Apparent Kdand Bmax values of LPA-binding sites were determined by the homologous competition assay, in which binding was performed in the presence of 10 nm [3H]LPA without or with an increase cold competitor LPA (ranging from 10 nm to 250 μm). Nonspecific binding of [3H]LPA reached a plateau in the presence of 50 μm cold competitor LPA. The data obtained were then transformed into a Scatchard plot or the equation of Cheng and Prusoff (24Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12330) Google Scholar) to analyze the apparent Kd andBmax values. Both analyses obtained similar results. To determine the effect of the anti-M2 antibody, cells were preincubated at 4 °C with the indicated concentration of the antibodies for 60 min, and the [3H]LPA binding assay was conducted in the presence of the antibodies. The LPA binding assay of HEL 92.1.7 (1 × 106 cells) was conducted in 250 μl of binding buffer containing 10 nm [3H]LPA without or with competitor LPA at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were then washed three times with binding buffer, centrifuged (300 ×g for 10 min), and the bound [3H]LPA was counted. Cells were plated in 10% charcoal-stripped FBS for 3 days, labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (300 μCi/4 ml) for 2 h at 37 °C, and stimulated with the indicated ligands for 5 min. Cells were then washed, extracted with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm CHAPS) containing 20% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin at 4 °C for 1 h. After microcentrifugation (15,000 × g for 10 min), extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-M2 antibody to isolate the EDG-1 polypeptide (2Lee M-J. Evans M. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11272-11279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. The extent of phosphorylation was quantitated by densitometry. HEK293-EDG-1 cells were stimulated in the absence or presence of SPP (0.5 μm) for 5 min, and then 1 mg of cellular extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-M2 antibody as described. Subsequently, the immunoprecipitates were deglycosylated and dephosphorylated with endoglycosidase H and alkaline phosphatase, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Polypeptides were then separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-M2 antibody (2Lee M-J. Evans M. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11272-11279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). COS-7 and HEL 92.1.7 cells were co-transfected with (0–2 μg) of EDG-1 plasmid and 0.1 μg of HA-ERK-2 plasmid as described previously (2Lee M-J. Evans M. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11272-11279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The amount of DNA used for transfection was normalized with vector DNA. Thirty hours later, cells were made quiescent in 0.5% FBS/DMEM for 16 h. Following stimulating with 20 μm LPA for 5 min, cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody. The ERK-2 activity of the immune complexes was assayed as described before (2Lee M-J. Evans M. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11272-11279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). HEK293-EDG-1 cells were cultured in 10% charcoal-stripped FBS (0.8 × 106 cells/35 mm) containing indicated concentrations of bioactive lipid ligands. The C3 exotoxin was used at 5 μg/ml. Three days later, cells were extracted with buffer A containing 20% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin at 4 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation (15,000 × g for 10 min), total extracted protein was quantified with the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Fifty μg of cell extracts were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-P-cadherin antibody or with anti-M2 as described previously (2Lee M-J. Evans M. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11272-11279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar,3Lee M-J. van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). mRNAs were isolated from cultured cells with FastTrackTM mRNA isolation kit 2.0 as per the manufacturer's instructions. The full-length coding region ofEDG-1 was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the random primer method and used as a probe for Northern hybridization analysis. One microgram of isolated poly(A)+ RNA in each lane was electrophoresed on 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred onto Zeta Probe membrane (Bio-Rad). Membrane was hybridized at 65 °C for 16 h with 32P-labeled probe in Church-Gilbert's solution (7% SDS, 0.5 mNa2HPO4, 0.5% BSA, 40 mm EDTA, 20% formaldehyde). Subsequently, membrane was washed with 2 × SSC, 0.05% SDS for 30–40 min at 65 °C with several changes. After the last wash with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 40 min at 65 °C, the filter was exposed to Kodak X-Omat film and autoradiographed. Total RNA from HUVEC cells (5 μg/lane) was used as a control to show the endogenous EDG-1. For reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, total RNA from cultured cells was purified as described (1Hla T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9308-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was then converted to cDNA by treatment with 200 units of mouse mammary leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 15 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 unit of RNasin, 0.2 μg of random hexamer primers, 0.8 mm dNTPs and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by heating at 95 °C for 10 min and diluted to 1 ml with distilled water. Enzymatic amplification was conducted with a 10-μl aliquot of the cDNA mixture. Polymerase chain reaction was performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1.5 mm MgCl2,10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 0.5 μg of each primers for EDG-2/Vzg-1 and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. The reaction mixture was heated at 94 °C for 1 min, annealed at 55 °C for 2 min, and extended at 72 °C for 3 min for 30 repetitive cycles. The primers used were 5′-GGTCCAGAACTATGCCGAGAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCCTCATTGACACCAGCCTGA-3′ (antisense) to amplifyEDG-2/Vzg-1 mRNA. HEK293-pCDNA and HEK293-EDG-1 cells (25,000/35-mm culture dish) were starved in 10% CFBS for 24 h, and the media containing the desired agents were added. Phase-contrast photographs of cellular morphology were taken at the indicated times. As controls, other lysophospholipids (i.e. lysophosphatidylserine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylinositol, and lysophosphatidylcholine) were used. We have established several human embryonic kidney 293 fibroblasts (HEK293) clones which stably express the FLAG epitope-tagged EDG-1 GPR (3Lee M-J. van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Immunostaining with anti-FLAG antibody (anti-M2) shows that the expressed EDG-1 GPR is predominantly located on the plasma membrane (Fig. 1). Immunostaining of vector-transfected clones did not express immunofluorescence signals. To determine if LPA is an agonist for EDG-1, we employed a radioligand [3H]LPA binding assay on HEK293 stable transfectants. As shown in Fig. 2 A, specific [3H]LPA binding was markedly enhanced in four independent HEK293-EDG-1 clones compared with the vector-transfected and parental counterparts. Specific LPA binding was time-dependent and was observed in bothEDG-1-transfected and vector-transfected cells. However,EDG-1-transfected cells bound significantly more [3H]LPA (Fig. 2 B). Specific LPA binding was competed by unlabeled LPA but not by other lysophospholipid and sphingolipid analogs (Fig. 2 C). Moreover, specific [3H]LPA binding was suppressed by the anti-M2 antibody in a dose-dependent manner only in HEK293-EDG-1cells (Fig. 2 D). This implies that LPA binds directly to the EDG-1 GPR. Furthermore, LPA binding was saturable; Scatchard analysis of [3H]LPA binding on HEK293-EDG-1 cells indicated two types of binding sites; apparent Kd = 178 nm, Bmax = 313 fmol/105 cells as well as apparent Kd = 2.3 μM, Bmax = 6.23 pmol/105 cells (Fig. 2 E). In contrast, there is only one type of binding site detected on HEK293 parental cells with an apparent Kd = 212 nm andBmax = 420 fmol/105 cells (Fig.2 E). To determine whether the N-terminal FLAG tag affect the binding properties of EDG-1, competition of [3H]LPA binding was compared between pDNFE (FLAG epitope-tagged at N-terminal) and pEGFPEDG-1 (green fluorescent protein tagged at C-terminal) (3Lee M-J. van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar) transfected human HEL92.1.7 erythroleukemia cells. These cells were chosen since they exhibit minimal endogenous LPA responsiveness and barely detectable expression of EDG-1mRNA in Northern analysis (data not shown). As shown in Fig.2 F, LPA binding was significantly enhanced inpDNFE and pEGFPEDG-1 transfected cells and cold competition studies showed similar IC50 values (2.5 and 1.8 μm, respectively). Together, these results strongly suggest that EDG-1 GPR is a low affinity receptor with an apparentKd of 2.3 μm for LPA. Although unlabeled LPA competed effectively with [3H]LPA binding (IC50 ≅ 3 μm), unlabeled SPP competed less effectively. At 100 μm SPP, 10 nm [3H]LPA binding was competed ∼47% (Fig.3 A). However, a 15-min pretreatment at 37 °C with LPA or SPP, followed by wash out and [3H]LPA binding analysis at 4 °C indicated that both LPA and SPP inhibited subsequent LPA binding to HEK293-EDG-1cells (Fig. 3 B). This suggests that both LPA and SPP are capable of binding to EDG-1. Next, we investigated whether LPA can signal via the EDG-1 receptor. As shown previously (2Lee M-J. Evans M. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11272-11279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 3Lee M-J. van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar), the activation of EDG-1 transduces two distinct intracellular signaling pathways: the Gi-linked MAP kinase pathway and Rho-dependent morphogenetic differentiation (3Lee M-J. van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). LPA is known to activate MAP kinase via a Gi-coupled mechanism (25Howe L.R. Marshall C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20717-20720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether LPA binding to EDG-1 also activates MAP kinase. The EDG-1cDNA was co-transfected into COS-7 cells with the HA epitope-tagged ERK-2 construct (2Lee M-J. Evans M. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11272-11279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and stimulated with LPA. As shown in Fig.4 A, LPA-induced MAP kinase activity was greatly potentiated by EDG-1 expression. LPA induced approximately 2–3-fold increase of MAP kinase activity in the absence of EDG-1 whereas it induced more than a 10-fold increase in MAP kinase activity when EDG-1 was overexpressed. This assay was also conducted in HEL92.1.7 cells which do not respond to LPA. LPA treatment markably activates MAP kinase in HEL 92.1.7 cells overexpressed EDG-1 GPR, and this activation is completely inhibited in the presence of pertussis toxin (Fig. 4 B). Together, these data show that LPA activates MAP kinase via the EDG-1 GPR and Gi pathway. Ligand binding to GPR results in the rapid activation of intracellular signaling components, which is accompanied by the phosphorylation of the cytosolic domains of the receptor (26Haga T. Haga K. Kameyama K. Tsuga H. Adv. Pharmacol. 1996; 36: 173-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Many cytosolic kinases, such as the β-adrenergic receptor kinase family, participate in the ligand-activated receptor phosphorylation responses (27Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1996; 74: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Such responses are thought to be important in GPR desensitization (26Haga T. Haga K. Kameyama K. Tsuga H. Adv. Pharmacol. 1996; 36: 173-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 27Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1996; 74: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). We next investigated if LPA is capable of inducing phosphorylation of EDG-1 GPR. As shown in Fig.5 A, LPA stimulated EDG-1 phosphorylation whereas the biologically inactive lipids such as lysophosphatidylinositol did not. SPP, which is a high affinity agonist for EDG-1, induces EDG-1 phosphorylation more potently. Also, FBS, which contains LPA and SPP, stimulates the EDG-1 phosphorylation. The deduced molecular mass of nascent EDG-1 polypeptide is approximately 42 kDa. Interestingly, ligand stimulation results in immunoreactive EDG-1 polypeptides which migrate in SDS-PAGE at the approximate 52-kDa position (Fig. 5, A and B). This is most likely due to the combination of glycosylation and phosphorylation of EDG-1, since deglycosylation or dephosphorylation of EDG-1 results in mobility shift to the approximate 42-kDa position (Fig. 5 B). The activation of EDG-1 specifically induces Rho-dependent morphogenetic differentiation and up-regulation of the P-cadherin polypeptide (3Lee M-J. van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). We therefore examined if LPA is capable of inducing HEK293-EDG-1 cell differentiation. As shown in Fig.6 A, LPA induced morphogenetic differentiation in HEK293-EDG-1 cells and not in vector-transfected counterparts. LPA-induced morphogenetic differentiation was suppressed by co-incubation with the anti-M2 antibody, which binds to the N-terminal FLAG epitope on the EDG-1 receptor (Fig. 6 A); and irrelevant antibodies did not influence morphogenetic differentiation. Other control lysophospholipids (i.e. lysophosphatidylserine (LPS), lysophosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylinositol, and lysophosphatidylcholine) at doses ranging from 1 to 50 μmwere ineffective. In addition, phospholipase B treatment of FBS, which hydrolyzes the sn-1 fatty ester bond of phospholipids, destroyed the differentiation inducing activity of FBS (Fig.6 B). In contrast, phospholipase A2 or heat-denatured phospholipase B treatment of FBS did not influence the differentiation inducing activity. These data support the notion that LPA is an important component of FBS in inducing EDG-1-dependent morphogenetic differentiation. In addition, LPA-induced morphogenetic differentiation was blocked by pretreating the cells with the C3 exotoxin (Fig. 6 C). Also, LPA treatment, in a dose-dependent manner up-regulated P-cadherin levels, which is inhibited by C3 exotoxin (Fig.6 D). Furthermore, consistent with the inhibition of [3H]LPA binding by anti-M2 (Fig. 2 D), the ability of LPA to induce P-cadherin in HEK293-EDG-1 cells was specifically blocked by the anti-M2 antibody, but not by an irrelevant antibody (Fig. 6 D). Together, these data strongly argue that LPA binding to EDG-1 is able to activate the Rho pathway to regulate P-cadherin polypeptides expression. Recently, EDG-2/Vzg-1, which is highly related to EDG-1, was shown to bind to LPA and transduce signals for cell rounding via a non-Gi/Go signaling pathway (20Hecht J.H. Weiner J.A. Post S.R. Chun J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7 A,EDG-2/Vzg-1 mRNA was detected in parental HEK293 cells and in a variety of other cell types including human endothelial cells, fibroblasts, but not vascular smooth muscle cells. Previously we showed that human endothelial cells contain high levels of theEDG-1 mRNA but other cell types contain low but detectable levels of EDG-1 mRNA (1Hla T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9308-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HEK293 cells contain extremely low levels of EDG-1 mRNA; poly(A)+ Northern analysis (Fig. 7 B) indicates undetectable levels of EDG-1 mRNA in parental and HEK293-pCDNA cells (Fig. 7 B). In contrast, HEK293-EDG-1 cells contain extremely high levels of transfected EDG-1 mRNA. LPA-induced cell rounding was observed in HEK293-pCDNA as well as HEK293-EDG-1 cells (Fig. 7 C). These observations are also consistent with a previous report (20Hecht J.H. Weiner J.A. Post S.R. Chun J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) that EDG-2/Vzg-1 confers LPA-induced cell rounding at nanomolar concentrations of LPA and that LPA binds to EDG-2/Vzg-1. In contrast, LPA-induced morphogenetic differentiation was observed only in HEK293-EDG-1 cells (Fig. 6), suggesting that LPA/EDG-1 interaction specifically induces cell differentiation. In this report, we show that: (i) LPA binding is enhanced inEDG-1-transfected cells and the enhancement is suppressed specifically by anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2, A-D). (ii) LPA is able to activate MAP kinase via the EDG-1 GPR (Fig. 4). (iii) LPA induces rapid phosphorylation of EDG-1 receptor (Fig. 5). (iv) LPA induces, in a Rho-dependent manner, morphogenetic differentiation and P-cadherin expression in HEK293-EDG-1(Fig. 6). Collectively, these data indicate that LPA directly binds to EDG-1 and activates EDG-1-mediated signaling events, and therefore suggests that EDG-1 can serve as a plasma membrane-localized receptor for the serum-borne bioactive lipid LPA. Furthermore, Scatchard analysis indicates that there are two types of LPA-binding sites present in HEK293-EDG-1 cells (apparentKd values = 178 nm and 2.3 μm), whereas a single type of binding site present in parental HEK293 cells (apparent Kd = 212 nm) (Fig. 2 E). It is possible that theBmax values for LPA-binding sites may be an overestimated due to the lipophilic nature of LPA. Nevertheless, these data suggest that EDG-1 is a low affinity receptor for LPA. In agreement with this notion, micromolar LPA is required to induce EDG-1-mediated differentiation (Fig. 6 A), P-cadherin induction (Fig. 6 D), and MAP kinase activation (Fig. 4). SPP is more potent than LPA in inducing EDG-1 signaling (3Lee M-J. van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). The physiological concentration of LPA in serum was estimated to be approximately 5 μm (28Yatomi Y. Igarashi Y. Yang L. Hisano N. Qi R. Asazuma N. Satoh K. Ozaki Y. Kume S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 121: 969-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Therefore, the apparentKd is well within in vivo concentrations. Thus, EDG-1 might be activated by LPA under physiological or pathophysiological conditions. Phospholipase B treatment (which is specific for glycerol-based lipids and not sphingoid-based lipids) destroyed the differentiation inducing activity of serum (Fig. 6 B), suggesting that LPA is an important component of serum required for EDG-1-dependent morphogenetic differentiation. However, it requires 20–40 times more LPA to mimic the effect induced by 10% serum (Fig. 6 A). Moreover, we were unable to completely reconstitute the differentiation inducing activity of serum by adding 1 μm LPA and SPP together (data not shown). Thus, there may be unidentified factor(s) present in serum which may induce EDG-1-mediated differentiation synergistically with serum-borne SPP and LPA, or stabilize the serum-borne SPP and LPA. In agreement, a recent report suggest that LPA induced Rho activation and cytoskeletal changes require the activity of the EGF receptor (29Gohla A. Harhammer R. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Data presented in this report suggest that EDG-1, a high affinity receptor for SPP (3Lee M-J. van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar), is a low affinity receptor for LPA. Intriguingly, the binding of [3H]LPA was competed poorly by unlabeled SPP (Fig. 3 A). However, pretreatment of HEK293-EDG-1 at 37 °C for 15 min with SPP or LPA, but not with control lipids (e.g. LPS and SPM), reduced the subsequent [3H]LPA binding in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 C). Previously, we have shown that SPP treatment resulted in EDG-1 GPR trafficking into intracellular compartments (3Lee M-J. van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). One plausible explanation for these observations is that SPP and LPA bind to EDG-1 at distinct sites. However, this assumption awaits definitive assignment of binding sites by site-directed mutagenesis studies of EDG-1. A common binding site for SPP/LPA was described in human platelets (11Yatomi Y. Yamamura S. Ruan F. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5291-5297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). It should be noted that EDG-1 possesses distinct properties than the platelet SPP/LPA receptor. First, SPP and LPA bind to a common site on platelets (11Yatomi Y. Yamamura S. Ruan F. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5291-5297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), whereas SPP and LPA may bind to two distinct sites on EDG-1. Second, EDG-1 has a single type of binding site for SPP (apparentKd = 8.1 nm), whereas platelets have two types of binding sites for SPP (Kd = 110 nm and 2.6 μm). Recently, EDG-2/Vzg-1, which is highly related to EDG-1 (40% sequence identity over 309 residues), was shown to bind to LPA and transduce signals for cell rounding via a non-Gi/Gopathway (20Hecht J.H. Weiner J.A. Post S.R. Chun J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Two independent reports confirmed that EDG-2/Vzg-1 indeed respond to LPA (23An S. Dickens M.A. Bleu T. Hallmark O. Goetzl E.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 30Erickson J.R. Wu J.J. Goddard J.G. Tigyi G. Kawanishi K. Tomei L.D. Kiefer M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1506-1510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Indeed, we observed that parental HEK293 cells express the EDG-2/Vzg-1 mRNA (Fig. 7). Also, specific [3H]LPA binding (Fig. 2) and LPA-induced cell rounding (Fig. 7) was observed in these cells. Therefore, the high affinity LPA-binding site in HEK293 may be encoded by EDG-2/Vzg-1mRNA. In this report, we show that LPA-induced morphogenetic differentiation and P-cadherin expression was observed only in HEK293-EDG-1 cells, indicating that these signals are EDG-1 specific. Collectively, these data support the concept that multiple receptors exit for LPA to mediate its pleiotropic functions (22Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. Postma F.R. Zondag G.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). LPA and its structural analogs such as SPP activate multiple signaling pathways: such as Gi-dependent MAP kinase activation (22Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. Postma F.R. Zondag G.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 31Wu J. Spiegel S. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11484-11488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), Rho-dependent stress fiber, and focal adhesion assembly (17Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar). Involvement of these signaling pathways in EDG-1 induced morphogenetic differentiation was determined by treating with pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of Gi (32Murayama T. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3319-3326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PD 98059, a selective inhibitor of MAP kinase kinase (33Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar), and C3 exoenzyme, an inhibitor of the small G-protein Rho (4Reshkin S.J. Murer H. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F572-F577PubMed Google Scholar). However, EDG-1-induced morphogenetic differentiation was blocked by C3 exoenzyme (Fig.6 C) but not by pertussis toxin or PD 98059, 2M.-J. Lee, S. Thangada, C. H. Liu, B. D. Thompson, and T. Hla, unpublished observations. suggesting a specific requirement for Rho-regulated signaling pathways. The small G-protein Rho binds to several protein kinases and regulate gene expression (34Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar), cytoskeletal structure (35Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar), and cell-cycle (36Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). Our finding that LPA/EDG-1/Rho signaling regulates P-cadherin expression is novel; however, the molecular details of the pathway from EDG-1 to P-cadherin expression via Rho remains to be defined. Both SPP and LPA are released by activated platelets (5Yatomi Y. Ruan F. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Blood. 1995; 86: 193-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Eichholtz T. Jalink K. Fahrenfort I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). EDG-1 was originally cloned as an immediate-early gene from phorbol ester-induced differentiating endothelial cells (1Hla T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9308-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, we named this orphan receptor, endothelialdifferentiation gene (EDG)-1 because of our original hypothesis that this receptor mediates the morphogenetic differentiation of endothelial cells into capillary-like structures (1Hla T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9308-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since platelet activation and thrombus formation usually accompany angiogenesis (37Nagy J.A. Brown L.F. Senger D.R. Lanir N. Van de. Water L. Dvorak A.M. Dvorak H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 948: 305-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), SPP and LPA released from platelets may activate endothelial cells to undergo angiogenesis via the EDG-1 receptor. However, whether coupling of EDG-1 GPR signaling with cadherin-based signaling events is a mechanism to achieve regulated morphogenesis, a critical event in endothelial cell differentiation awaits future study. A recent report indicated LPA stabilized endothelial junctions and decreased permeability (38Alexander J.S. Patton W.F. Christman B.W. Cuiper L.L. Haselton F.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H115-H122PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the role of EDG-1 and its ligands SPP and LPA in the vascular system needs to be addressed in the future. In conclusion, our data suggest that EDG-1 is a low affinity LPA receptor. Furthermore, our data support the concept that multiple receptors exist for LPA each of which regulate specific biological functions. Third, EDG-1 represents a GPR which interacts with both LPA and SPP, albeit at different affinities. We thank Drs. Sarah Spiegel and James R. van Brocklyn for helpful discussions."

Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2959) Google Scholar). Subsequent isolation of the human SREBP cDNAs indicated that three proteins, SREBP-1a, SREBP-1c, and SREBP-2 are derived from two SREBP genes (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2959) Google Scholar). SREBP-1a and -1c mRNAs result from alternative splicing of exon 1 of the SREBP-1 gene (1Brown M.S.

Adipocyte determination and differentiation factor 1 (ADD1), the rat homologue of SREBP-1c, was cloned independently as a result of studies aimed at identifying a nuclear protein that bound the E-box motif in the promoter of the fatty acid synthase gene (2Tontonoz P.

SREBPs/ADD1 are synthesized as 125-kDa proteins that contain two transmembrane domains that anchor the proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2959) Google Scholar). When cellular sterol levels are low, two distinct proteolytic events release a mature 68-kDa NH2-terminal fragment of SREBPs/ADD1, which then translocates to the nucleus, binds to the promoters of target genes, and activates transcription (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2959) Google Scholar). Conversely, when levels of cellular sterols are high, proteolytic processing of SREBPs/ADD1 is diminished, nuclear levels of the mature proteins decline, and transcription of target genes is low (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2959) Google Scholar). A number of genes have been shown to be regulated at the transcriptional level by mature SREBPs/ADD1. These include genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis (e.g. HMG-CoA synthase, HMG-CoA reductase, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, squalene synthase, and the LDL receptor) (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

Recent studies have shown that ADD1/SREBP1 also activates peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor γ through production of an endogenous ligand (10Kim J.B. Wright H.M. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4333-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) and stimulates expression of the leptin gene (11Kim J.B. Sarrat P. Wright M. Yao K.M. Mueller E. Solanes G. Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The mature, transcriptionally active SREBPs/ADD1 contain basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLH-Zip) domains that are required for DNA binding and transactivation (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4753-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). bHLH-Zip domains are found in a number of other transcription factors, including Myc and Max, that bind to E-box motifs (CANNTG) (12Murre C. Bain G. van Dijk M.A. Engel I. Furnari B.A. Massari M.E. Matthew J.R. Quong M.W. Rivera R.R. Stuiver M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). In contrast, ADD1/SREBPs bind to both E-box and non-E-box motifs (13Kim J.B. Spotts G.D. Halvorsen Y. Shih H. Ellenberger T. Towle H.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2582-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The ability of ADD1/SREBPs to bind to non-E-box motifs is a result of an atypical tyrosine replacing an arginine that is conserved in the basic domain of all other bHLH-containing proteins (13Kim J.B.

Promoters from a number of SREBP/ADD1-responsive genes have been analyzed to identify the nucleotide sequences necessary for SREBP/ADD1-DNA interaction. The results indicate that the nucleotide sequence of the different sterol response elements (SREs), vary considerably; many, but not all SREs, contain two half-sites (direct repeats of C/TCAC) separated by two nucleotides (1Brown M.S.

Such mutants include sterolregulatory defective (SRD) cell lines that constitutively express high (SRD-1, SRD-2) or low (SRD-6) levels of nuclear SREBPs irrespective of the sterol status of the medium or of the cells (14Metherall J.E.

Subsequently, it was shown that the 5′ part of the SREBP-2 gene, that contains the bHLH-Zip domains, had undergone a translocation event in SRD-1 and SRD-2 cells. This resulted in the synthesis of distinct fusion proteins that contain no transmembrane sequences and were translocated to the nucleus where they transactivate target genes (16Yang J. Brown M.S. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12152-12161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In contrast, SRD-6 cells produce little or no mature SREBPs as a result of a defect at the site-2 cleavage (20Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). As a result, the mRNA levels of a number of SREBP-responsive genes are extremely low, even when SRD-6 cells are incubated in the absence of sterols (15Evans M.J. Metherall J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5175-5185Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Metherall J.E. Edwards P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1712-1721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized the existence of novel genes and/or known genes not previously ascribed to be under the transcriptional control of SREBPs and cellular sterols. To identify such genes, we utilized mRNA differential display (22Liang P. Pardee A.B. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 85: 3-11PubMed Google Scholar), using RNAs isolated from SRD-2 and SRD-6 cells. This approach identified a number of transcripts expressed at high levels in SRD-2 cells as compared with SRD-6 cells. Among these, we identified stearoyl-CoA desaturase 2 (SCD2), an enzyme involved in the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. SCD2 catalyzes the Δ9-cis desaturation of fatty acyl-CoAs such as stearoyl-CoA and palmitoyl-CoA to produce oleic and palmitoleic acid, respectively (23Ntambi J.M. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 24Kaestner K.H. Ntambi J.M. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14755-14761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The current studies demonstrate that a gene (SCD2) encoding an enzyme involved in fatty acid desaturation is transcriptionally regulated by SREBPs/ADD1 or sterols. The finding provides a plausible explanation as to why certain mutant cells that are defective in SREBP processing require not only cholesterol for growth but also unsaturated fatty acids (17Hasan M.T.

Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. Total RNA was isolated from SRD-2 and SRD-6 cells as described (21Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Metherall J.E. Edwards P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1712-1721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fifty μg of total RNA was DNase I-treated to remove any contaminating DNA (MessageClean, Genhunter Corp.). DNA-free RNA (0.2 μg) was reverse-transcribed utilizing a T11G primer. PCR was then performed using the T11G primer, a second primer, and [33P]dATP as described (RNAimage, Genhunter Corp.). The products were separated on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and exposed to x-ray film for 20 h. Differentially displayed bands were excised from the gel, eluted, and reamplified by PCR. DNA fragments generated by PCR were subcloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen) as described by the supplier. Escherichia coli, strain DH5α, were transformed and selected for growth on ampicillin-containing medium. β-Galactosidase-deficient colonies were screened for the presence of inserts following EcoRI digestion of the plasmid DNA and electrophoretic analysis on 1% agarose gels. Inserts were sequenced by the Sanger chain-termination method using the T7 Sequenase v2.0 kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). SRD cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (1:1), 5% LPDS and supplemented with either 25-hydroxycholesterol (0.5 μg/ml) (SRD-1 and SRD-2 cells) or cholesterol (5 μg/ml) and mevalonic acid (200 μm) (SRD-6 cells) (14Metherall J.E.

Chem. 1992; 267: 14462-14469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′ end of the SCD2 gene (nt −588 to +81) was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using C57Bl/6J mouse genomic DNA as a template. The 5′ primer contained nucleotides that corresponded to −588 to −567 of the published SCD2 genomic sequence (24Kaestner K.H. Ntambi J.M. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol.

The 3′ primer contained nucleotides that corresponded to +81 to +60 of the published genomic sequence (24Kaestner K.H. Ntambi J.M. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14755-14761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and additional nucleotides (5′-ACTTAAGCTT-3′) containing an HindIII restriction site. The PCR product was cloned into the pGL2 basic vector, utilizing XhoI and HindIII restriction sites to produce pSCD2-588. This 670-bp sequence of the SCD2 gene (−588 to +81) was identical to that reported by Kaestneret al. (24Kaestner K.H. Ntambi J.M. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14755-14761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This DNA was used as template for additional PCRs that utilized 5′ primers corresponding to −199 to −167, −150 to −129, and −110 to −89 of the SCD2 genomic sequence in combination with the common 3′ primer. These reactions generated a series of SCD2 promoter fragments that were cloned into the pGL2 basic vector to produce pSCD2-588, pSCD2-199, pSCD2-150, and pSCD2-110, respectively. Oligonucleotides (28-mers) were used to introduce mutations into pSCD2-199 using QuikChange (Stratagene). The resulting reporter genes each contained three A to C mutations at nt −151, −148 and −146 (pSCD2-199mut A) or at nt −157 to −155 (pSCD2-199mut B), respectively. The promoter of each construct was sequenced to confirm sequence. Total RNA was isolated from SRD-1, SRD-2, SRD-6, and CHO cells using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc). Ten μg of each RNA sample was fractionated by agarose/formaldehyde gel electrophoresis, transferred to nylon membranes, and cross-linked by exposure to UV light as described (26Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1989Google Scholar). [α-32P]dCTP-radiolabeled DNA probes were generated by the random priming labeling method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization and quantification, using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics), were as described (5Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To correct for differences in RNA loading in each lane, blots were also hybridized to a probe, 36B4, that hybridized to a constitutively expressed mRNA. Transient transfections were performed using minor modifications of the transfection MBS kit (Stratagene). Details of the transient transfection of HepG2 cells with luciferase reporter genes, a plasmid encoding β-galactosidase, pCI-SREBP-1a (encoding mature SREBP-1a) pCI-SREBP-2 (encoding mature SREBP-2), appear in previous publications (5Ericsson J.

Following transfection, cells were incubated for 20 h in medium containing 10% LPDS supplemented with either 5 μmmevinolin (inducing medium) or sterols (10 μg/ml cholesterol and 1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol) (repressing medium). The cells were lysed and the luciferase activities determined and normalized to the β-galactosidase activity to correct for minor differences in transfection efficiency (5Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Double-stranded DNA fragments corresponding to −588 to −278, −299 to −239, −259 to −178, −199 to −130, −150 to −91, −110 to +1, and −259 to −91 of the murine SCD2 proximal promoter were generated by PCR. The primers used to generate these SCD2 DNA fragments were flanked by the same 10 nucleotides, containing either an XhoI or HindIII restriction site, as described above. Single-stranded DNA (−164 to −137) containing wild-type or mutated sequences were annealed and the double-stranded DNA isolated and used in EMSAs (5Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Recombinant SREBP-1a was purified from E. coli extracts as described previously (5Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The DNA was end-labeled with 32P (20,000 cpm; 1.5 fmol) and used in EMSAs as described (5Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14755-14761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used for DNase I footprinting. The fragment was cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen). Purified plasmid DNA was cut with eitherBamHI or NotI and then end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP. The labeled, linearized plasmid was digested with the reciprocal restriction enzyme, either NotI or BamHI, to liberate a fragment containing nucleotides −259 to −91, end-labeled at either end. The gel-purified, end-labeled fragments were incubated with purified SREBP-1a and treated with DNase I as described (5Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The mRNAs for a number of SREBP-responsive genes, including the LDL receptor, HMG-CoA synthase, HMG-CoA reductase, and farnesyl diphosphate synthase genes are expressed at 5–10-fold higher levels in SRD-1 and SRD-2 cells as compared with SRD-6 cells (14Metherall J.E. Goldstein J.L. Luskey K.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15634-15641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Evans M.J. Metherall J.E. Mol. Cell.

Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1712-1721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the mRNA levels of other SREBP-responsive genes would also be differentially expressed in these mutant cells. Fig. 1 shows the results obtained using the technique of mRNA differential display utilizing the arbitrary upstream primer AP9, the downstream primer T11G, and RNA isolated from SRD-2 and SRD-6 cells. The portion of the gel shown contains a 700-bp band that was present when SRD-2 cells were the source of RNA but was absent when SRD-6-derived RNA was used (Fig. 1,arrow). This band was excised from the gel, reamplified by PCR, subcloned, and sequenced. The sequence revealed a >97% identity with the 3′-untranslated region of mouse stearoyl-CoA desaturase 2 (SCD2). The 700-bp insert was radiolabeled and used as a probe in a Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2). The probe hybridized to a mRNA of approximately 5 kilobases that was expressed at higher levels in SRD-1 and SRD-2 cells as compared with SRD-6 cells (Fig. 2). These latter studies confirm that the band identified by mRNA differential display corresponds to a mRNA that is more abundant in SRD-2 than in SRD-6 cells. Using the same methodology we have identified a number of other differentially regulated genes. 2D. E. Tabor and P. A. Edwards, unpublished data. Some, but not all, of these additional mRNAs are also expressed at higher levels in SRD1 cells as compared with SRD2 cells.2 The reason for this differential expression of mRNAs in the two cell types (SRD-1 and SRD-2) that constitutively overexpress different SREBP fusion proteins is unknown.Figure 2SCD2 mRNA levels are elevated in SRD-1 and SRD-2 as compared with SRD-6 cells. Ten μg of total RNA, isolated from duplicate dishes of SRD-1, SRD-2, and SRD-6 cells, was separated on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred to a nylon membrane as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The blot was hybridized with a radiolabeled probe generated from the cloned band indicated in Fig. 1 and then to a radiolabeled 36B4 probe. The SCD2 mRNA of approximately 5.0 kilobases and the control 36B4 RNA are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Increased expression of SCD2 mRNA in SRD-1 and SRD-2 cells (Fig. 2) might be a direct result of the elevated levels of transcriptionally active SREBP in these cells (16Yang J.

Alternatively, the effect may either be secondary, resulting from a cascade of effects initiated by elevated nuclear SREBP, or nonphysiological, because of the supraphysiological levels of transcriptionally active SREBP-2 fusion proteins. To distinguish between these possibilities, wild-type CHO cells were incubated in medium supplemented with 10% LPDS and either mevinolin (inducing conditions) or sterols (repressing conditions). These conditions are known to regulate the nuclear localization of SREBPs and to result in changes in the mRNA levels of SREBP-regulated genes (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J."

https://openalex.org/W1971876556,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) activates cyclin E/Cdk2, which regulates cell cycle progression in G1and S phase of the cell cycle. HCMV activation of cyclin E/Cdk2 can be demonstrated in cells that are refractory to normal mitotic stimuli. This observation suggests that the virus has some means to overcome the stringent control on expression of cell cycle progression factors that is characteristic of cells in the G0 state. One of the mechanisms involved in activation of cyclin E/Cdk2 is the induction of cyclin E expression. We report here that HCMV induces cyclin E expression through a transcriptional mechanism. The cyclin E gene is activated by the HCMV 86-kDa immediate early gene product (IE86), which directly binds to nucleotide sequences within the cyclin E promoter. An IE86 DNA-binding mutant neither binds nor activates the cyclin E promoter. IE86-binding sites within the cyclin E promoter are required for IE86-mediated activation, and deletion of the IE86-binding site inhibits IE86 activation of the cyclin E promoter. We also demonstrate that mutation of the known E2F-binding sites in the cyclin E promoter does not block activation by HCMV or IE86. These data provide a molecular mechanism for HCMV induction of cyclin E and represent the first report of IE86 directly binding to a cellular promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1968491349,"Human prostatic acid phosphatase (PAcP) is a prostate epithelium-specific differentiation antigen. In prostate carcinomas, the cellular PAcP is decreased. We investigated its functional role in these cells. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that cellular PAcP functions as a neutral protein-tyrosine phosphatase and is involved in regulating prostate cell growth. In this study, we identify its in vivo substrate. Our results demonstrated that, in different human prostate cancer cell lines, the phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) level of a 185-kDa phosphoprotein (pp185) inversely correlates with the cellular activity of PAcP. On SDS-PAGE, this pp185 co-migrates with the c-ErbB-2 oncoprotein. Immunodepletion experiments revealed that c-ErbB-2 protein is the major pp185 in cells. Results from subclones of LNCaP cells indicated the lower the cellular PAcP activity, the higher the Tyr(P) levels of c-ErbB-2. This inverse correlation was further observed in PAcP cDNA-transfected cells. In clone 33 LNCaP cells, l-(+)-tartrate suppresses the cellular PAcP activity and causes an elevated Tyr(P) level of c-ErbB-2 protein. Epidermal growth factor stimulates the proliferation of LNCaP cells, which concurs with a decreased cellular PAcP activity as well as an increased Tyr(P) level of c-ErbB-2. Biochemically, PAcP dephosphorylates c-ErbB-2 at pH 7.0. The results thus suggest that cellular PAcP down-regulates prostate cell growth by dephosphorylating Tyr(P) on c-ErbB-2 oncoprotein in those cells. Human prostatic acid phosphatase (PAcP) is a prostate epithelium-specific differentiation antigen. In prostate carcinomas, the cellular PAcP is decreased.

Our results demonstrated that, in different human prostate cancer cell lines, the phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) level of a 185-kDa phosphoprotein (pp185) inversely correlates with the cellular activity of PAcP. On SDS-PAGE, this pp185 co-migrates with the c-ErbB-2 oncoprotein. Immunodepletion experiments revealed that c-ErbB-2 protein is the major pp185 in cells. Results from subclones of LNCaP cells indicated the lower the cellular PAcP activity, the higher the Tyr(P) levels of c-ErbB-2. This inverse correlation was further observed in PAcP cDNA-transfected cells. In clone 33 LNCaP cells, l-(+)-tartrate suppresses the cellular PAcP activity and causes an elevated Tyr(P) level of c-ErbB-2 protein. Epidermal growth factor stimulates the proliferation of LNCaP cells, which concurs with a decreased cellular PAcP activity as well as an increased Tyr(P) level of c-ErbB-2. Biochemically, PAcP dephosphorylates c-ErbB-2 at pH 7.0. The results thus suggest that cellular PAcP down-regulates prostate cell growth by dephosphorylating Tyr(P) on c-ErbB-2 oncoprotein in those cells. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation play a key role in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of normal and tumor cells (1Cross M. Dexter T.M.

In human cancers, an increased level of tyrosine phosphorylation is implicated in a high cellular proliferation rate and an eventual development of tumors (5Hunter T. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1311-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar).

The biological function of PTPases in antagonizing protein-tyrosine kinase activity and cellular transformation has been demonstrated in cell culture models (for a review, see Ref. 6Walton K.M. Dixon J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). For example, protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B and LAR PTPase dephosphorylated the IR on tyrosine residues, resulting in a decreased tyrosine kinase specific activity of IR (7Kenner K.A. Anyannu E.

Additionally, SHP-1, an Src homology 2 domain-containing PTPase, could be recruited by an erythropoietin receptor and subsequently down-regulated JAK2 through a dephosphorylation mechanism (9Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 10Yin T. Sehn R. Feng G.-S. Yang Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1032-1037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Furthermore, by cDNA transfection, the expression of an exogenous protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B suppressed the malignant transformation of NIH3T3 cells induced by the c-erbB-2 oncogene (11Brown-Shimer S. Johnson K.A. Hill D.E. Bruskin A.M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 478-482PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, an induced expression of DEP-1, a PTPase, inhibited cell growth by 5–10-fold in human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, which is c-erbB-2-amplified (12Keane M.M. Lowrey G.A. Ettenberg S.A. Dayton M.A. Lipkowitz S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4236-4243PubMed Google Scholar). In a xenograft animal model, c-erbB-2 gene-transformed 18-Hn1 human breast carcinoma cells developed tumors in athymic nude mice. Following LAR transfection, the tumor growth was significantly inhibited (13Zhai Y. Wirth J. Kang S. Welsch C.W. Esselman W.J. Mol. Carcinogen. 1995; 14: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, PTPases could counteract the growth-stimulating and oncogenic activity of protein-tyrosine kinases. Human PAcP is a prostate epithelium-specific differentiation antigen. Two forms of PAcP have been identified: one stays intracellular, while the other is secreted (14Vihko P. Invest. Urol. 1979; 16: 349-352PubMed Google Scholar). Its cellular enzyme activity and mRNA level is decreased in prostate carcinomas, compared with normal or benign prostate hypertrophy cells (15Foti A.G. Herschman H. Cooper J.F. Cancer Res. 1977; 37: 4120-4124PubMed Google Scholar, 16Loor R. Wanf M.C. Valenzuela L. Chu T.M. Cancer Lett. 1981; 14: 61-69Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Results from many studies have demonstrated that the cellular form of PAcP could function as a PTPase in cells. Briefly, PAcP exhibits endogenous PTPase activity and dephosphorylates tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (17Li H.C. Chernoff J. Chen L.B. Kirschonbaum A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 138: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 18Lin M.F. Clinton G.M. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Biochemically, the tyrosine phosphorylation level and the tyrosine kinase-specific activity of EGFR could be down-regulated by PAcP at a neutral pH (19Lin M.F. Clinton G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5477-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Expression of an exogenous PAcP via either cDNA transfection (20Lin M.F. Da Volio J. Garcia-Arenas R.

Commun. 1996; 226: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) was associated with decreased Tyr(P) levels of cellular proteins. Additionally, crystallographic analyses and titration experiments revealed that PAcP could indeed function as a “cysteine”-mediated PTPase (24Schneider G. Lindquist Y. Vihko P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2609-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25Ostanin K. Saeed A. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8971-8978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken collectively, these data indicate that the cellular form of PAcP is involved in regulating tyrosine phosphorylation in prostate epithelia. Although previous investigations suggested that PAcP acts as a negative regulator of tyrosine phosphorylation signals, the in vivosubstrate of PAcP was not identified yet. In this study, we analyzed protein tyrosine phosphorylation in several prostate cancer cells that express different levels of cellular PAcP. Our results demonstrated that the Tyr(P) level of pp185, a 185-kDa phosphoprotein, negatively correlates with the cellular activity of PAcP. We clarified the identity of pp185 to be the c-ErbB-2 oncoprotein. Furthermore, using PAcP cDNA transfection, we elucidated the relationship between PAcP expression and the Tyr(P) level of c-ErbB-2 in prostate cancer cells. Thus, our data suggest that c-ErbB-2 protein is an in vivosubstrate of cellular PAcP. FBS, RPMI 1640 culture medium, gentamicin, EGF, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgGs were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Charcoal/dextran-treated, certified FBS (lot AGD6463, testosterone ≤ 3.0 ng/dl) was from Hyclone (Logan, UT). Protein molecular weight standard marker, acrylamide, and a protein assay kit were obtained from Bio-Rad. Polyclonal anti-ErbB-2 Abs (C-18 and K-15) for immunoblotting, monoclonal anti-ErbB-2 Ab (9G6) for immunoprecipitation, and normal mouse IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit anti-PAcP antiserum was obtained as described previously (26Lin M.F. Garcia-Arenas R. Chao Y.C. Lai M.M.C. Patel P.C. Xia X.Z. Arch. Biochem.

Purified PAcP was isolated from human seminal fluid as described (27Lin M.F. Lee C.L. Li S.S.L. Chu T.M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). An enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other reagents were from Sigma. Human prostate carcinoma cell lines LNCaP, DU 145, and PC-3 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and routinely maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% FBS, 1% glutamine, and 0.5% gentamicin. Cells were split once per week, defined as one passage. LNCaP cells that had passage numbers less than 33 were designated as clone 33, greater than 80 as clone 81, and between 34 and 80 as clone 51 (28Lin M.F. Meng T.C. Rao P.S. Chang C. Schonthel A.H.

Endocrinol. 1995; 111: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), a steroid-reduced medium, i.e. RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% charcoal-treated, heat-inactivated FBS, was used in this study (26Lin M.F.

For doubling time determination, after 72 h of culture, one set of attached cells was harvested and counted, defined as cell number on day 0. The remaining cells were fed with fresh medium and then counted on days 3, 5, and 7. Fresh medium (3 ml/well in six-well plates) was added to the remaining cultures on days 3 and 5. To quantify cell growth, attached cells were trypsinized and combined with the suspended cells, and the total cell number was counted using a Coulter Counter Z1 model. PC-411, -412, and -416 cells were subclones of PC-3 parental cells transfected with a full-length human PAcP cDNA driven by a pCMV-neo expression vector, as described previously (20Lin M.F. Da Volio J. Garcia-Arenas R. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4600-4607PubMed Google Scholar). Clone 81 LNCaP cells were also transfected with the same expression vector containing human PAcP cDNA. Two subclones designated as LNCaP-28 and -40 were obtained as the stable transfectants after neomycin selection. LNCaP-CMV-13 is a subline of clone 81 LNCaP cells transfected with the pCMV-neo vector alone. p-Nitrophenol phosphate was utilized as the substrate to quantify the acid phosphatase activity at pH 5.5 by measuring the absorbency of released PNP at 410 nm (30Lin M.F. Lee C.L. Clinton G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4753-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Since l-(+)-tartrate is a classic inhibitor of PAcP and since greater than 90% ofl-(+)-tartrate-sensitive acid phosphatase in LNCaP cells can be precipitated by anti-PAcP antiserum, thel-(+)-tartrate-sensitive acid phosphatase activity was used to represent the PAcP activity (30Lin M.F. Lee C.L. Clinton G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4753-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Subconfluent cells were harvested by scraping, pelleted, and rinsed with ice-cold 20 mm Hepes-buffered saline, pH 7.0, and then lysed in ice-cold cell lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (i.e. 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 4 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mmZnCl2, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl flouride, 1 trypsin-inhibitory unit of aprotinin, 4 μm leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin A). The lysates were spun at 1,600 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were transferred, and protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. For immunoprecipitation, 1 mg of supernatant protein was incubated with 9G6 anti-ErbB-2 Ab-conjugated protein A-Sepharose complex for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were spun at 700 ×g for 5 min, washed four times with ice-cold lysis buffer, and suspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For immunoblotting, an aliquot of total lysate protein (50 μg) or the supernatant of immunoprecipitated complexes in SDS-PAGE sample buffer was electrophoresed and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter (Micron Separation Inc., MA). Filters were incubated with appropriate antibodies, and the protein bands were visualized by the ECL detection system (28Lin M.F. Meng T.C. Rao P.S. Chang C. Schonthel A.H. Lin F.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5939-5947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For rehybridization, the filters were stripped by a stripping buffer, i.e. 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, containing 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol and 2% SDS, for 30 min at 50 °C. After two washes with TBST buffer (i.e. 20 mm Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Tween 20), the filters were reacted with specific Abs, and the signal was detected by the ECL method. Previous studies demonstrated that cellular PAcP could function as a neutral PTPase in prostate cancer cells (19Lin M.F. Clinton G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5477-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,22Lin M.F. Da Volio J. Garcia-Arenas R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

To understand its biological role, we investigated itsin vivo substrate. We initially examined PAcP expression in different subclones of LNCaP cells as well as PC-3 and DU 145 cells. As shown in Fig. 1 A, PAcP protein level in clone 33 LNCaP cells was higher than that in clone 51 and 81 cells, while PC-3 and DU 145 cells did not express a detectable PAcP protein. To examine the relationship between PAcP expression and protein tyrosine phosphorylation, the same membrane was rehybridized with anti-Tyr(P) Ab. As shown in Fig. 1 B, among different subclones of LNCaP cells, the tyrosine phosphorylation level of a protein with a molecular mass of approximately 185 kDa (pp185) inversely correlates with the cellular level of PAcP. Significantly, levels of pp185 tyrosine phosphorylation were high in PC-3 and DU 145 cells (Fig. 1 B), which lack PAcP expression (Fig.1 A). To further explore the correlation between the Tyr(P) level of pp185 and the cellular PAcP activity, we performed PAcP cDNA transfection experiments utilizing clone 81 LNCaP cells, which express a low level of PAcP. Two stable transfectants were established and designated as LNCaP-28 and LNCaP-40. Immunoblotting analyses demonstrated that PAcP expression was increased in these two transfectants, higher than that in clone 81 parental cells (Fig.2 A, top). The effect of exogenous PAcP expression on protein tyrosine phosphorylation was examined with anti-Tyr(P) Ab via Western blotting. As shown in Fig.2 A (bottom), in both LNCaP-28 and -40 cells, the Tyr(P) level of pp185 conspicuously decreased, as compared with that in control clone 81 parental cells. We also investigated if an inverse correlation exists between PAcP expression and the Tyr(P) level of pp185 in PAcP cDNA-transfected PC-3 cells. Immunoblotting results showed that three transfectants (i.e. PC-411, PC-412, and PC-416) expressed an exogenous PAcP (Fig. 2 B, top panel) with a decreased Tyr(P) level of pp185, lower than that in the control parental cells (Fig. 2 B,bottom). These data indicated that although there are other phosphoproteins with altered Tyr(P) levels, the pp185 is the only one that exhibits a diminished Tyr(P) level in all PAcP-expressing cells. Since c-ErbB-2 has a molecular mass of 185 kDa and is one of the major tyrosine kinases in prostate epithelial cells (31Robinson D. He F. Pretlow T. Kung H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5958-5962Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), we examined whether pp185 might be the c-ErbB-2 protein. Hybridization of the same membranes shown in Fig. 1 B, and Fig. 2, A andB, with anti-ErbB-2 Ab revealed that c-ErbB-2 protein comigrates with pp185 on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Furthermore, in all of these cell systems analyzed, although the tyrosine phosphorylation status was altered, there was no significant change in the protein expression level of c-ErbB-2, independent of its tyrosine phosphorylation status (data not shown). Apparently the differences in Tyr(P) levels of c-ErbB-2 in different subcloned cells are not due to differences in its protein expression. To examine if c-ErbB-2 is the major phosphoprotein at 185 kDa, c-ErbB-2 was immunodepleted from total lysates of clone 81 LNCaP cells. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the immunoprecipitated amounts of c-ErbB-2 protein increased following the dosage of Ab. The immunodepleted cell lysates were then immunoblotted with anti-Tyr(P) Ab. In these depleted lysates, the tyrosine phosphorylation level of pp185 decreased, proportionally to the increase of Ab dosage (Fig. 3 B). Greater than 80% of the Tyr(P) level of the pp185 was depleted from 1 mg of cell lysate by 10 μg of Ab (Fig. 3 B). However, normal mouse IgG had no effect on immunoprecipitating c-ErbB-2 protein (Fig. 3 A) and did not affect the Tyr(P) level of pp185 (Fig. 3 B). The same membrane was subsequently reacted with anti-ErbB-2 Ab. A diminished amount of c-ErbB-2 protein in immunodepleted lysates corresponded to the decreased tyrosine phosphorylation level of pp185 (Fig. 3,C versus B). Thus, c-ErbB-2 protein is the major pp185 whose Tyr(P) level inversely correlates with the cellular PAcP activity in prostate cancer cells. To investigate whether c-ErbB-2 could be a substrate of cellular PAcP, we first examined the Tyr(P) level of c-ErbB-2 in subclones of LNCaP cells. The c-ErbB-2 protein was immunoprecipitated, and its tyrosine phosphorylation level was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P) Ab. The results demonstrated the lower the cellular PAcP activity, the higher the Tyr(P) level of c-ErbB-2 protein in LNCaP cells (top of Fig.4 A versus Fig.1 A). The same membrane was reacted with anti-ErbB-2 Ab after stripping. As shown in the bottom of Fig. 4 A, there was no significant change in c-ErbB-2 protein levels among clone 33, 51, and 81 LNCaP cells. The relative Tyr(P) level of c-ErbB-2 protein was semiquantified by normalizing to its protein level after densitometric analyses. In clone 81 cells, the tyrosine phosphorylation of c-ErbB-2 was approximately 5-fold higher than that in clone 33 cells, while the PAcP activity was 5-fold lower (TableI).Table IThe cell growth rate, cellular PAcP activity, and c-ErbB-2 phosphorylation level in different prostate cancer cellsCell lines and subclonesDoubling timeaFor doubling time determination, cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in a steroid-reduced medium in six-well plates.

Open table in a new tab To evaluate the effect of exogenous PAcP on the tyrosine phosphorylation of c-ErbB-2, we performed similar analyses using PAcP cDNA-transfected LNCaP-28 and -40 cells. As shown in Fig.4 B (top), in both LNCaP-28 and LNCaP-40 cells, the tyrosine phosphorylation of c-ErbB-2 was lower than that in clone 81 LNCaP parental cells as well as CMV vector control cells. The same membrane was subsequently incubated with anti-ErbB-2 Ab. The immunoblotting result revealed that c-ErbB-2 protein levels were essentially the same among all cells examined (bottom of Fig. 4 B). Densitometric analyses indicated that an elevated expression of PAcP by cDNA transfection in clone 81 LNCaP cells correlated with a decrease of the Tyr(P) level of c-ErbB-2 by up to 65% (Table I). We further examined tyrosine phosphorylation levels on c-ErbB-2 in PC-3 transfectants. Similarly, this exogenous expression of PAcP resulted in a diminished Tyr(P) level of c-ErbB-2 in all three transfected clones (Fig. 4 C, top), while the protein levels of c-ErbB-2 were apparently the same in all cells (Fig. 4 C,bottom). Densitometric analyses demonstrated an up to 70% decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of c-ErbB-2 in PAcP cDNA transfectants, as compared with that in PC-3 parental cells (TableI). Since results from PAcP cDNA transfection studies revealed that an additional PAcP expression correlates with a decreased Tyr(P) level on c-ErbB-2 protein in prostate cancer cells, we investigated this relationship further by treating clone 33 LNCaP cells with l-(+)-tartrate, a classic inhibitor of PAcP (23Lin M.F. Meng T.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 30Lin M.F. Lee C.L. Clinton G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4753-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells were exposed to different doses of l-(+)-tartrate, and c-ErbB-2 protein was immunoprecipitated and followed by immunoblotted for analyzing tyrosine phosphorylation status. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the tyrosine phosphorylation level of c-ErbB-2 increased following an increase of inhibitor concentrations. However, the c-ErbB-2 protein expression levels were very similar among the cells exposed to different doses ofl-(+)-tartrate (Fig. 5 B). The relative Tyr(P) level of c-ErbB-2 in cells exposed to 5 mml-(+)-tartrate was approximately 4.5-fold of that in control cells (Fig. 5 B). Conversely, the cellular PAcP activity was decreased by around 20% (data not shown), as we reported previously (22Lin M.F. Da Volio J. Garcia-Arenas R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Thus, an inhibition of PAcP activity concurs with an increase of tyrosine phosphorylation of c-ErbB-2 in prostate cancer cells. EGF stimulates the growth of LNCaP cells (20Lin M.F. Da Volio J. Garcia-Arenas R. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4600-4607PubMed Google Scholar) and prostate primary cells (32Peehl D.M. Stamey T.A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 22: 82-90Google Scholar). Since cellular PAcP is possibly involved in down-regulating the growth of prostate cells, we also analyzed whether a stimulation of cell growth by EGF correlates with a decrease of PAcP activity in clone 33 LNCaP cells. EGF caused an increase in cell growth indicated by total cellular protein amounts with the optimal dose at 10 ng/ml (Fig.6 A). In contrast, the enzyme activity of cellular PAcP diminished following the dosage of EGF (Fig.6 A). The EGF effect in regulating tyrosine phosphorylation status of c-ErbB-2 in these cells was further examined. Results shown in Fig. 6 B (top) demonstrated that the Tyr(P) level of c-ErbB-2 increased, in proportion to the EGF concentrations with the optimal induction at 10 ng/ml. The c-ErbB-2 protein level was also inspected and shown in Fig. 6 B (bottom). Densitometric analyses demonstrated an over 3-fold induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of c-ErbB-2 by 10 ng/ml of EGF, in comparison with that in the control group (Fig. 6 B). These data therefore indicate that EGF down-regulates cellular PAcP activity, thus resulting in the elevation of Tyr(P) level on c-ErbB-2 protein, which leads to an increased cell proliferation rate. To elucidate a direct interaction between these two proteins, we analyzed the dephosphorylation of c-ErbB-2 by PAcP at a neutral pH in vitro. c-ErbB-2 protein was immunoprecipitated from clone 81 LNCaP cells. The immunocomplexes were resuspended in Hepes-buffered saline, and purified PAcP was added. The remaining tyrosine phosphorylation level of c-ErbB-2 was examined by immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P) Ab. As shown in Fig. 7 A, PAcP dephosphorylated c-ErbB-2 protein on tyrosine residues following a time course. c-ErbB-2 protein amounts in each sample were analyzed by immunob"

Modulation of chromatin repression for the purposes of gene expression therefore is an important facet of gene regulation (reviewed in Ref.1Kingston R.E. Bunker C.A. Imbalzano A.N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). For the initiation of transcription on a chromatin template, access to DNA by trans-activator proteins is often subject to the actions of chromatin-remodeling complexes such as the Swi-Snf complex. At least part of the actions of the Swi-Snf complex in this role include the reorganization of the nucleosomal structure of target DNA at promoter sequences (reviewed in Ref. 2Peterson C.L. Tamkun J.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 143-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Similarly, for the traverse of DNA in a nucleosomal (chromatin) configuration by RNA polymerase II during the elongation phase of transcription, certain protein factors are needed, at least in vitro, to counteract this form of chromatin repression (3Ding H.-F.

Several stages of transcription are thus subject to modulation by chromatin effects.In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, many proteins have been implicated in the mediation of the repressive effects of chromatin. Several such proteins were identified by in vivoeffects on the expression of reporter genes. For example, functional expression of the reporter genes his4–912δ andlys2–128δ is limited by the presence of a Ty1 retrotransposon long terminal repeat (δ-element) inserted within 5′ sequences; the transcriptionally active δ-element changes the pattern of transcription (reviewed in Refs. 5Winston F.

Functional transcription at these genes can be restored either by a gene mutation or by extra copies of several genes. This “suppressor of Ty” (Spt−) effect has been used to identify many proteins that affect chromatin structure, including the histones and the Cdc68/Spt16 protein, which is the subject of this report. The CDC68 gene and the genes encoding histones H2A and H2B are all grouped within the same category of SPT genes; for most of these genes, mutations or increased gene dosage confer similar effects on chromatin repression (6Winston F.

A. Singer, manuscript in preparation. Similarly, Cdc68 maintains the HO gene in a transcriptionally inactive state when the Swi4-Swi6 transcription activator is absent (12Lycan D. Mikesell G. Bunger M. Breeden L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7455-7465Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The repressive effects of Cdc68 at several genes can be overcome by the actions of the Swi-Snf complex (8Malone E.A. Clark C.D. Chiang A. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5710-5717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 1The abbreviations used are: kbpkilobase pairPCRpolymerase chain reactionHAhemagglutinin.1The abbreviations used are: kbpkilobase pairPCRpolymerase chain reactionHAhemagglutinin. The mechanism underlying this Cdc68/Swi-Snf antagonism is not understood.Studies using a temperature-sensitive mutant version of Cdc68 show that at a number of genes (7Rowley A. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5718-5726Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), including SUC2 andGAL1,1 the Cdc68 protein facilitates transcription as well as repression. In these temperature-sensitive mutant cells, many mRNAs become depleted, including some that encode essential proteins, a finding in accord with the essential nature of the CDC68 gene (8Malone E.A. Clark C.D. Chiang A. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5710-5717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The involvement of the Cdc68 protein in transcription as well as chromatin repression suggests that Cdc68 is responsible for maintaining chromatin in a configuration that facilitates proper gene regulation.The Cdc68 protein is localized to the nucleus (14Xu Q. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6025-6035Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); we show here by purification and immunoprecipitation experiments that Cdc68 is found exclusively in a complex with another nuclear protein termed Pob3 (15Wittmeyer J. Formosa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4178-4190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we provide evidence that this complex may be a heterodimer of Cdc68 and Pob3. The putative Cdc68-Pob3 heterodimer, designated here the CP complex, is highly abundant, equivalent to the nucleosome in number; this characteristic also supports a role for the CP complex in chromatin structure and/or function. An increased gene dosage of eitherCDC68 or POB3 can partially overcome the need for the Swi-Snf complex for the expression of several genes, indicating that the stoichiometry of each component of the CP complex, and perhaps of the intact CP complex, with respect to other chromatin components is important for chromatin repression.DISCUSSIONThe Cdc68 protein of yeast is an essential nuclear protein that allows trans-activators to function at a number of genes and also maintains chromatin-mediated repression in the absence oftrans-activation (7Rowley A. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5718-5726Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 8Malone E.A. Clark C.D. Chiang A. Winston F. Mol. Cell.

Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6025-6035Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).1 These activities implicate the Cdc68 protein in the regulation of chromatin structure and/or function. Here we report that Cdc68 is found associated with another essential nuclear protein termed Pob3; we have named this heterodimer the CP complex. Both Cdc68 and Pob3 have structural homologs in mammalian cells and diverse eukaryotes 1D. R. H. Evans, N. K. Brewster, Q. Xu, A. Rowley, B. Altheim, G. C. Johnston, and R. A. Singer, manuscript in preparation., 4G. Orphanides and D. Reinberg, personal communication. (15Wittmeyer J. Formosa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4178-4190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, the CP complex may be a general eukaryotic feature. The association of Cdc68 with Pob3 is relatively stable; therefore, the functions in gene activation and repression that are associated with Cdc68 are likely to be properties of the CP complex. Neither Cdc68 nor Pob3 has been found in any other transcription complex, including the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme, which was specifically tested for the presence of Cdc68 with our anti-Cdc68 antibody. 5D. Chao and R. A. Young, personal communication. Therefore the CP complex probably functions as an independent nuclear regulator. The abundance of the CP complex suggests that it may be widespread throughout chromatin. Indeed, the CP complex, at ∼50,000 copies/haploid nucleus, is approximately as abundant as the nucleosome.The CP heterodimer of Cdc68-Pob3 has a calculated size of 182 kDa, less than the apparent size of 400 kDa that is indicated by molecular sieve chromatography. Our assessment of the composition of the CP complex indicates that the significantly larger apparent size is unlikely to be due to the presence of additional proteins in the CP complex, while stoichiometry estimations suggest that the CP complex contains only one molecule each of Cdc68 and of Pob3. The difference between actual and apparent sizes therefore suggests that the CP complex may adopt a nonspherical shape, with the inherently larger Stokes radius of a nonspherical particle accounting for the larger hydrodynamic size that determines migration during gel filtration. These findings relate to the predominant form of the CP complex; less abundant proteins may well associate with the basic CP complex, leading to minor CP variants.The transcription effects of increased CDC68 andPOB3 gene dosage are intriguing yet poorly understood mechanistically. An excess of Cdc68 or Pob3, as shown here, does not compromise the ability of CP to allow trans-activator function. In contrast, the ability of the CP complex to maintain a repressive conformation of chromatin is compromised by excess Cdc68 or Pob3. This effect is indicated by the restoration, by excess Cdc68 or Pob3, of transcription in cells with a mutationally impaired Swi-Snf chromatin-remodeling complex. The effects of excess CP components may be analogous to the “squelching” effects on transcription that can be exerted by the overexpression of strong trans-activators and consequent sequestration of other factors needed for transcription initiation (29Ptashne M. Gann A.A.F. Nature. 1990; 346: 329-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Cdc68 or Pob3 in excess may sequester factors needed for chromatin repression; the appropriation of such repressive factors by excess, probably nonchromatin, CP components may alter chromatin conformation in ways related to Swi-Snf-mediated chromatin remodeling. Transcription in the absence of Swi-Snf activity is also seen when Cdc68 and Pob3 are both present in excess. Under these conditions, most of the excess protein may exist as the stable Cdc68-Pob3 complex. The gene dosage effects in this situation suggest that the hypothesized sequestration of factors may not take place through surfaces dedicated to Cdc68-Pob3 interaction but instead may reflect bona fideinteractions that occur normally with the CP complex. An analogous restoration of transcription from the normal promoter at thehis4–912δ δ-insertion allele may also be a manifestation of sequestration. HIS4 transcription is facilitated by the Swi-Snf complex (30Happel A.M. Swanson M.S. Winston F. Genetics. 1991; 128: 69-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Jiang Y.W. Stillman D.J. Genetics. 1995; 140: 103-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), raising the possibility that sequestration of a Swi-Snf target by Cdc68 protein may be responsible for the functional his4–912δ transcription seen in Cdc68 excess. However, excess Pob3 is unable to exert a similar effect, suggesting that excess CP components may alleviate the need for the Swi-Snf complex and restore functional transcription to the δ-insertion alleles by different mechanisms.The CP complex resembles other nuclear proteins in structure and/or function. Foremost among these are the yeast Spt5 and Spt6 proteins. Like Cdc68 and Pob3, Spt5 and Spt6 are both essential proteins, and each has a domain that is highly acidic, although the acidic domains are at the N terminus for Spt5 and Spt6 (32Neigeborn L. Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 672-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 33Clark-Adams C.D. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7 (; correction (1987) Mol. Cell.

As found for the CP components, structural homologs of Spt5 and Spt6 exist in vertebrates and other eukaryotes (35Nishiwaki K. Sano T. Miwa J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 239: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 36Chiang P.-W. Wang S.-Q. Smithivas P. Song W.-J. Ramamoorthy S. Hillman J. Puett S. Van Keuren M. Crombez E. Kumar A. Glover T.W.

Ponstingl H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Similarities may also extend to function, as suggested by the effects of mutations. Likecdc68 mutations, spt5 and spt6mutations allow functional expression of the his4–912δand lys2–128δ mutant alleles, decrease the need for the Swi-Snf complex for the expression of several genes, and allow transcription from core promoters (9Prelich G.

Genetics. 1988; 118: 203-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These effects implicate these Spt proteins in chromatin repression (5Winston F. Carlson M. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 387-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Consistent with a chromatin role, the Spt6 protein interacts directly with histone H3, and spt6 mutations can alter chromatin structure (43Bortvin A. Winston F. Science. 1996; 272: 1473-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates a role for the Spt5 and Spt6 proteins in the elongation phase of transcription (44Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 45Hartzog G.A. Wada T. Handa H. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar); it remains to be seen if the CP complex has a similar function. Gene dosage effects suggest that the CP complex and these Spt proteins may be functionally distinct. For example, while increased SPT6 gene dosage allows transcription from core promoters (32Neigeborn L. Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 672-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), neither CDC68 norPOB3 in increased dosage has been found to exert this effect. 6N. K. Brewster, G. C. Johnston, and R. A. Singer, unpublished observations. Moreover, increasedSPT5 or SPT6 dosage restores functional transcription of his4–912δ or lys2–128δ, while increased POB3 dosage does not. Nonetheless, as found for the CDC68 gene, increased dosage of the SPT5or SPT6 gene can decrease the need for the Swi-Snf complex and restore functional transcription at the his4–912δ andlys2–128δ alleles (32Neigeborn L. Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 672-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 33Clark-Adams C.D. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7 (; correction (1987) Mol. Cell.

Biol. 4286): 3009-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Therefore, the CP complex and the Spt proteins may work in overlapping but distinct ways to regulate chromatin structure.Functions of the CP complex may extend beyond transcription. Both components of the CP complex can be pulled out of cell extracts by physical interaction with the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase α, and Cdc68 has been implicated genetically in the function of DNA polymerase α (15Wittmeyer J. Formosa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4178-4190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These interactions suggest a role for the CP complex in modulating the accessibility of DNA to DNA polymerase, analogous to a role for the CP complex in modulating the accessibility of DNA to RNA polymerase II. The CP complex may generally control access to chromatin-associated DNA. The nucleoprotein complex of chromatin exerts a significant repressive effect on eukaryotic gene expression. This repressive effect has been illuminated through the study of protein-coding genes. Modulation of chromatin repression for the purposes of gene expression therefore is an important facet of gene regulation (reviewed in Ref.1Kingston R.E. Bunker C.A. Imbalzano A.N.

Similarly, for the traverse of DNA in a nucleosomal (chromatin) configuration by RNA polymerase II during the elongation phase of transcription, certain protein factors are needed, at least in vitro, to counteract this form of chromatin repression (3Ding H.-F.

Similarly, Cdc68 maintains the HO gene in a transcriptionally inactive state when the Swi4-Swi6 transcription activator is absent (12Lycan D. Mikesell G. Bunger M. Breeden L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7455-7465Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The repressive effects of Cdc68 at several genes can be overcome by the actions of the Swi-Snf complex (8Malone E.A. Clark C.D. Chiang A. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5710-5717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 1The abbreviations used are: kbpkilobase pairPCRpolymerase chain reactionHAhemagglutinin.1The abbreviations used are: kbpkilobase pairPCRpolymerase chain reactionHAhemagglutinin. The mechanism underlying this Cdc68/Swi-Snf antagonism is not understood. kilobase pair polymerase chain reaction hemagglutinin. kilobase pair polymerase chain reaction hemagglutinin. Studies using a temperature-sensitive mutant version of Cdc68 show that at a number of genes (7Rowley A. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5718-5726Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), including SUC2 andGAL1,1 the Cdc68 protein facilitates transcription as well as repression. In these temperature-sensitive mutant cells, many mRNAs become depleted, including some that encode essential proteins, a finding in accord with the essential nature of the CDC68 gene (8Malone E.A. Clark C.D. Chiang A. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5710-5717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The involvement of the Cdc68 protein in transcription as well as chromatin repression suggests that Cdc68 is responsible for maintaining chromatin in a configuration that facilitates proper gene regulation. The Cdc68 protein is localized to the nucleus (14Xu Q. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6025-6035Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); we show here by purification and immunoprecipitation experiments that Cdc68 is found exclusively in a complex with another nuclear protein termed Pob3 (15Wittmeyer J. Formosa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4178-4190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we provide evidence that this complex may be a heterodimer of Cdc68 and Pob3. The putative Cdc68-Pob3 heterodimer, designated here the CP complex, is highly abundant, equivalent to the nucleosome in number; this characteristic also supports a role for the CP complex in chromatin structure and/or function. An increased gene dosage of eitherCDC68 or POB3 can partially overcome the need for the Swi-Snf complex for the expression of several genes, indicating that the stoichiometry of each component of the CP complex, and perhaps of the intact CP complex, with respect to other chromatin components is important for chromatin repression. DISCUSSIONThe Cdc68 protein of yeast is an essential nuclear protein that allows trans-activators to function at a number of genes and also maintains chromatin-mediated repression in the absence oftrans-activation (7Rowley A. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5718-5726Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 8Malone E.A. Clark C.D. Chiang A. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5710-5717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lycan D. Mikesell G. Bunger M. Breeden L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7455-7465Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 14Xu Q. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6025-6035Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).1 These activities implicate the Cdc68 protein in the regulation of chromatin structure and/or function. Here we report that Cdc68 is found associated with another essential nuclear protein termed Pob3; we have named this heterodimer the CP complex. Both Cdc68 and Pob3 have structural homologs in mammalian cells and diverse eukaryotes 1D. R. H. Evans, N. K. Brewster, Q. Xu, A. Rowley, B. Altheim, G. C. Johnston, and R. A. Singer, manuscript in preparation., 4G. Orphanides and D. Reinberg, personal communication. (15Wittmeyer J. Formosa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4178-4190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, the CP complex may be a general eukaryotic feature. The association of Cdc68 with Pob3 is relatively stable; therefore, the functions in gene activation and repression that are associated with Cdc68 are likely to be properties of the CP complex. Neither Cdc68 nor Pob3 has been found in any other transcription complex, including the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme, which was specifically tested for the presence of Cdc68 with our anti-Cdc68 antibody. 5D. Chao and R. A. Young, personal communication. Therefore the CP complex probably functions as an independent nuclear regulator. The abundance of the CP complex suggests that it may be widespread throughout chromatin. Indeed, the CP complex, at ∼50,000 copies/haploid nucleus, is approximately as abundant as the nucleosome.The CP heterodimer of Cdc68-Pob3 has a calculated size of 182 kDa, less than the apparent size of 400 kDa that is indicated by molecular sieve chromatography. Our assessment of the composition of the CP complex indicates that the significantly larger apparent size is unlikely to be due to the presence of additional proteins in the CP complex, while stoichiometry estimations suggest that the CP complex contains only one molecule each of Cdc68 and of Pob3. The difference between actual and apparent sizes therefore suggests that the CP complex may adopt a nonspherical shape, with the inherently larger Stokes radius of a nonspherical particle accounting for the larger hydrodynamic size that determines migration during gel filtration. These findings relate to the predominant form of the CP complex; less abundant proteins may well associate with the basic CP complex, leading to minor CP variants.The transcription effects of increased CDC68 andPOB3 gene dosage are intriguing yet poorly understood mechanistically. An excess of Cdc68 or Pob3, as shown here, does not compromise the ability of CP to allow trans-activator function. In contrast, the ability of the CP complex to maintain a repressive conformation of chromatin is compromised by excess Cdc68 or Pob3. This effect is indicated by the restoration, by excess Cdc68 or Pob3, of transcription in cells with a mutationally impaired Swi-Snf chromatin-remodeling complex. The effects of excess CP components may be analogous to the “squelching” effects on transcription that can be exerted by the overexpression of strong trans-activators and consequent sequestration of other factors needed for transcription initiation (29Ptashne M. Gann A.A.F. Nature. 1990; 346: 329-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Cdc68 or Pob3 in excess may sequester factors needed for chromatin repression; the appropriation of such repressive factors by excess, probably nonchromatin, CP components may alter chromatin conformation in ways related to Swi-Snf-mediated chromatin remodeling. Transcription in the absence of Swi-Snf activity is also seen when Cdc68 and Pob3 are both present in excess. Under these conditions, most of the excess protein may exist as the stable Cdc68-Pob3 complex. The gene dosage effects in this situation suggest that the hypothesized sequestration of factors may not take place through surfaces dedicated to Cdc68-Pob3 interaction but instead may reflect bona fideinteractions that occur normally with the CP complex. An analogous restoration of transcription from the normal promoter at thehis4–912δ δ-insertion allele may also be a manifestation of sequestration. HIS4 transcription is facilitated by the Swi-Snf complex (30Happel A.M. Swanson M.S. Winston F. Genetics. 1991; 128: 69-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Jiang Y.W. Stillman D.J. Genetics. 1995; 140: 103-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), raising the possibility that sequestration of a Swi-Snf target by Cdc68 protein may be responsible for the functional his4–912δ transcription seen in Cdc68 excess. However, excess Pob3 is unable to exert a similar effect, suggesting that excess CP components may alleviate the need for the Swi-Snf complex and restore functional transcription to the δ-insertion alleles by different mechanisms.The CP complex resembles other nuclear proteins in structure and/or function. Foremost among these are the yeast Spt5 and Spt6 proteins. Like Cdc68 and Pob3, Spt5 and Spt6 are both essential proteins, and each has a domain that is highly acidic, although the acidic domains are at the N terminus for Spt5 and Spt6 (32Neigeborn L. Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 672-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 33Clark-Adams C.D. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7 (; correction (1987) Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1991; 11: 5718-5726Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 15Wittmeyer J. Formosa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4178-4190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As found for the CP components, structural homologs of Spt5 and Spt6 exist in vertebrates and other eukaryotes (35Nishiwaki K. Sano T. Miwa J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 239: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 36Chiang P.-W. Wang S.-Q. Smithivas P. Song W.-J. Ramamoorthy S. Hillman J. Puett S. Van Keuren M. Crombez E. Kumar A. Glover T.W.

Ponstingl H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Similarities may also extend to function, as suggested by the effects of mutations. Likecdc68 mutations, spt5 and spt6mutations allow functional expression of the his4–912δand lys2–128δ mutant alleles, decrease the need for the Swi-Snf complex for the expression of several genes, and allow transcription from core promoters (9Prelich G.

Genetics. 1988; 118: 203-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These effects implicate these Spt proteins in chromatin repression (5Winston F. Carlson M. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 387-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Consistent with a chromatin role, the Spt6 protein interacts directly with histone H3, and spt6 mutations can alter chromatin structure (43Bortvin A. Winston F. Science. 1996; 272: 1473-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates a role for the Spt5 and Spt6 proteins in the elongation phase of transcription (44Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 45Hartzog G.A. Wada T. Handa H. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar); it remains to be seen if the CP complex has a similar function. Gene dosage effects suggest that the CP complex and these Spt proteins may be functionally distinct. For example, while increased SPT6 gene dosage allows transcription from core promoters (32Neigeborn L. Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 672-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), neither CDC68 norPOB3 in increased dosage has been found to exert this effect. 6N. K. Brewster, G. C. Johnston, and R. A. Singer, unpublished observations. Moreover, increasedSPT5 or SPT6 dosage restores functional transcription of his4–912δ or lys2–128δ, while increased POB3 dosage does not. Nonetheless, as found for the CDC68 gene, increased dosage of the SPT5or SPT6 gene can decrease the need for the Swi-Snf complex and restore functional transcription at the his4–912δ andlys2–128δ alleles (32Neigeborn L. Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 672-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 33Clark-Adams C.D. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7 (; correction (1987) Mol. Cell.

Biol. 4286): 3009-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Therefore, the CP complex and the Spt proteins may work in overlapping but distinct ways to regulate chromatin structure.Functions of the CP complex may extend beyond transcription. Both components of the CP complex can be pulled out of cell extracts by physical interaction with the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase α, and Cdc68 has been implicated genetically in the function of DNA polymerase α (15Wittmeyer J. Formosa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4178-4190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These interactions suggest a role for the CP complex in modulating the accessibility of DNA to DNA polymerase, analogous to a role for the CP complex in modulating the accessibility of DNA to RNA polymerase II. The CP complex may generally control access to chromatin-associated DNA. The Cdc68 protein of yeast is an essential nuclear protein that allows trans-activators to function at a number of genes and also maintains chromatin-mediated repression in the absence oftrans-activation (7Rowley A.

This zinc finger protein also possesses the capacity to stimulate expression from a Pol II mRNA promoter. Here, we report a study on two human proteins, ZNF76 and ZNF143, that are 64 and 84% identical to theirXenopus counterpart, respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed that ZNF76 and ZNF143 mRNAs were expressed in all normal adult tissues examined. By using in vivo and in vitro assays, we have analyzed the DNA binding capacities and transcriptional properties of ZNF76 and ZNF143. The binding affinities of ZNF76 and ZNF143 for Staf divergent responsive elements were determined by gel shift assays, which revealed that the two proteins bound a same DNA motif with similar affinities. Also, polypeptide sequences containing the seven zinc fingers of ZNF76 and ZNF143 could efficiently repress in vivo the activated transcription from an snRNA-type promoter. Transfection experiments inDrosophila cells showed that ZNF76 and ZNF143 can activate transcription from an mRNA promoter through the Staf binding site. Finally, chimeric ZNF76 and ZNF143 proteins, carrying a heterologous DNA binding domain, are able to activate a Pol II mRNA promoter and snRNA Pol II and Pol III promoters in Xenopus oocytes, through the heterologous DNA binding site. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that ZNF76 and ZNF143 are two members of a same family of transactivator proteins. ZNF143 constitutes the human ortholog of the Xenopus Staf, and ZNF76 is a novel DNA binding protein related to Staf and ZNF143. The transcriptional activator Staf, originally identified in Xenopus laevis, is implicated in the enhanced transcription of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and snRNA-type genes by RNA polymerases II (Pol II) and III (Pol III). This zinc finger protein also possesses the capacity to stimulate expression from a Pol II mRNA promoter. Here, we report a study on two human proteins, ZNF76 and ZNF143, that are 64 and 84% identical to theirXenopus counterpart, respectively.

ZNF143 constitutes the human ortholog of the Xenopus Staf, and ZNF76 is a novel DNA binding protein related to Staf and ZNF143. Transcription is a major regulatory point in gene expression and depends largely on the interaction of regulatory proteins with their cognate DNA elements in gene promoters (1Carey M. Curr. Opin.

The Pol II and Pol III snRNA gene promoters both contain an essential PSE, which binds the basal transcription factor PTF also called SNAPc (3Murphy S. Yoon J.-B. Gerster T. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1995; 374: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and a DSE playing a major role in transcription efficiency. The DSE contains an octamer motif that binds the well characterized transcriptional activator Oct-1 (6Hernandez N. MacKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 281-313Google Scholar, 7Herr W. MacKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 1103-1135Google Scholar). In addition to Oct-1, Sp1 has been shown in some instances to be involved in mediating the activation properties of the DSE (8Ares Jr., M. Chung J.-S. Giglio L. Weiner A.M. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 808-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9Janson L. Bark C. Petterson U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 4997-5016Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 10Tebb G.

Biol. 1992; 228: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A number of other short transcription units, such as the 7SK, Y, MRP and tRNASec genes, have similar promoter organization and can be classified as snRNA-type genes (6Hernandez N. MacKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 281-313Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that the zinc finger protein Staf, originally identified in Xenopus laevis as the transcriptional activator of the tRNASec gene (12Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 13Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), is also involved in transcriptional activation of snRNA and snRNA-type genes transcribed by RNA Pol II and Pol III (14Schaub M. Myslinski E. Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, Staf possesses the capacity to stimulate expression from an RNA polymerase II mRNA promoter. The presence of two physically and functionally distinct activation domains, devoted to the specific activation of snRNA-type or mRNA promoters, constitutes the molecular basis of these pleiotropic effects on transcriptional activity. Whereas a 93-amino acid domain, with the presence of four repeated units, is specialized for the transcriptional activation of an mRNA promoter, a segment of only 18 amino acids acts specifically on Pol II and Pol III snRNA and snRNA-type promoters (15Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2650-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Here, we report the characterization of two human factors highly homologous to the Xenopus Staf transcriptional activator. These human zinc finger proteins, originally denominated ZNF76 and ZNF143 (16Ragoussis J. Senger P. Mockridge I. Sanseau P. Ruddy S. Dudley K. Sheer D. Trowsdale J. Genomics. 1992; 14: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Tommerup N. Vissing H. Genomics. 1995; 27: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), contain structural domains very similar to those of Staf. In keeping with Staf, our studies also revealed that ZNF76 and ZNF143 are able to transactivate not only Pol II and Pol III snRNA and snRNA-type, but also TATA box-containing mRNA promoters.DISCUSSIONStaf, originally identified in X. laevis, plays a pivotal role in transcriptional activation not only of snRNA and snRNA-type promoters by RNA Pol II and Pol III, but also of mRNA promoters. This activity is complex, arising from the action of two physically and functionally distinct activation domains acting specifically on snRNA and mRNA promoters (15Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2650-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In X. laevis, only one molecular species of Staf has been characterized (13Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Herein, we describe the characterization of the human Staf ortholog, ZNF143 (17Tommerup N. Vissing H. Genomics. 1995; 27: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and the identification of a novel DNA binding protein, ZNF76 (16Ragoussis J. Senger P. Mockridge I. Sanseau P. Ruddy S. Dudley K. Sheer D. Trowsdale J. Genomics. 1992; 14: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), with Staf-like properties. DNA binding and functional studies in vitro and in vivo showed that ZNF76 and ZNF143 can bind tightly to Staf responsive elements and transactivate Pol II and Pol III snRNA-type and mRNA promoters. These findings confirm that these proteins are two members of the same family.A Blast search of the mouse EST data base (mESTs) with the human ZNF76 and ZNF143 sequences at the National Center for Biotechnology Information revealed the presence of mESTs for both proteins (accession numbers: AA498451, AA475999, and W74814 for ZNF76; and AA153902 for ZNF143). Surprisingly, the mouse ortholog of ZNF76 contains the additional residues observed in the C-domain of human ZNF143, but absent in human ZNF76. From our and other studies, it appears that ZNF76 and ZNF143 are highly conserved in mammals. Additionally, only the Staf/ZNF143 ortholog is expressed in amphibian and bird cells (13Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,16Ragoussis J. Senger P. Mockridge I. Sanseau P. Ruddy S. Dudley K. Sheer D. Trowsdale J. Genomics. 1992; 14: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).ZNF76 and ZNF143 contain seven tandemly repeated zinc fingers of the C2-H2 type, similarly to Staf. The structure of the Staf DNA binding domain is still unknown, but the x-ray and/or NMR structures of other zinc finger-containing DNA-protein complexes, such as Zif268, GLI, Tramtrack, GAGA, YY1, and TFIIIA, have been solved (24Pavletich N.P.

Biol. 1997; 273: 183-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). These structural data identified amino acids governing DNA-binding specificity at positions −1, +2, +3, and +6 of the α-helix of one zinc finger. The divergent residues between the homologous zinc fingers of Staf, ZNF76, and ZNF143 are essentially located in the two antiparallel β-strands and in the loop connecting them. Based on the structural data evoked above, it follows that the amino acids putatively involved in DNA recognition are fully conserved between Staf, ZNF76, and ZNF143, with the exception of the amino acid at position +6 in zinc finger 6 which is Asn in ZNF76 and Lys in Staf and ZNF143. The sequence of zinc finger 6 in ZNF76 does not match the consensus sequence of the C2-H2 type zinc finger: Φ-X-C-X2–5-C-X3-Φ-X5-Φ-X2-H-X3–5-H (Φ being a hydrophobic amino acid and X a nonconserved amino acid). This zinc finger contains only two amino acids between the two invariant His and three residues between the conserved hydrophobic Leu residue and the invariant distal His. However, our results showed that ZNF76 and ZNF143 have comparable affinities for the Staf responsive element contained in the X. laevistRNASec and human U6 promoters, revealing the neutral character of the amino acid changes in the sequences of the ZNF76 and ZNF143 DNA binding domains. This is further confirmed by sequence analysis of the mouse ortholog of ZNF76 (mEST AA475991) that revealed the presence of a K residue at position +6 in the α-helix of zinc finger 6, as ZNF143.Six regions are highly conserved from Xenopus Staf to human ZNF76 and ZNF143, outside of the zinc finger domain (referred to as regions I to VI). Regions I to IV, located in the N-terminal part of the proteins, partly encompass the mRNA transactivation domain and contain the four repeated units, a characteristic feature of this domain. The consensus sequence V/IXLXDGS/TXAY/FI/VH/Q (Xstands for any amino acid), derived from comparison of the repeated units in Staf, ZNF76, and ZNF143, contains the leucine and aspartic acid residues previously identified as essential for the Staf transactivation function (15Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2650-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The distance between the repeats represents 10–16 amino acids and only the sequence motif L/FEDG, located in front of repeat R3, is conserved in the inter-repeats. Conserved region V, also lying in the N-domain of the proteins, encompasses the Staf snRNA activation domain and possesses the amino acids found essential for that function. Although no specific biological function has been attributed yet to conserved region VI in the C-domain of Staf, its evolutionary conservation definitely points to an important activity.Previous work from our laboratory identified the human U2 snRNA, U4B snRNA, U4C snRNA, U6 snRNA, U11 snRNA, Y4 RNA, 7SK RNA, and tRNASec genes as direct targets of the transcriptional activator Staf (14Schaub M. Myslinski E. Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The present study extended this work by demonstrating that the human proteins ZNF76 and ZNF143 are highly identical and functionally equivalent to the Xenopus Staf. From this, it appears that the transcriptional activation of the human U2 snRNA, U4B snRNA, U4C snRNA, U6 snRNA, U11 snRNA, Y4 RNA, 7SK RNA, and tRNASec genes is dependent on ZNF76 and ZNF143. It is very likely that these proteins are also involved in the expression of many other genes, perhaps performing particular functions depending on the context of specific promoters. In this respect, we had previously shown that the Staf and Oct-1 transactivators can synergistically stimulate transcription from snRNA and snRNA-type promoters, from two adjacent specific binding sites (31Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that ZNF76 and ZNF143 can function differentially in their combinatorial action with Oct-1.In conclusion, our results imply that the presence of Staf responsive elements in a number of distal sequence elements of snRNA and snRNA-type genes does not necessarily mean that Staf is the unique factor capable of recognizing these elements to activate transcription. We have shown here that in human cells, at least another homologous factor, ZNF76, that has highly conserved Staf/ZNF143 regions also binds to Staf responsive elements with identical affinities and acts as a transcriptional activator as well. This finding reveals that Staf responsive elements are recognized by a family of transcription factors, in much the same way as other control elements like the Sp1 and octamer sites (32Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 33Dennig J. Beato M. Suske G.

Therefore, the discovery of ZNF76 and ZNF143 as Staf homologs introduces a novel complexity in the transcriptional regulation exerted through Staf responsive elements. Further functional investigations will be necessary to understand the interplay between ZNF76 and ZNF143.After completion of this manuscript, the characterization of the mouse Staf has been reported by others (35Adachi K. Saito H. Tanaka T. Oka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5598-5606Google Scholar). It appears that the identified mouse Staf is the ortholog of human ZNF143. Surprisingly, the authors described that, in Drosophila cells, a truncated mouse Staf containing the snRNA activation domain is unable to activate the mouse Pol III tRNASec reporter (35Adachi K. Saito H. Tanaka T. Oka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5598-5606Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that the mouse PSE sequence contained in this promoter is highly divergent from the Drosophila counterpart (36Wang Y. Stumph W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1570-1579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), therefore leading this promoter to be inactive in Drosophila cells. From this, it is likely that the mouse tRNASec Pol III promoter used in their study was TATA box-dependent only, therefore functioning as an RNA polymerase II mRNA promoter. Transcription is a major regulatory point in gene expression and depends largely on the interaction of regulatory proteins with their cognate DNA elements in gene promoters (1Carey M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 452-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 2Johnson P.F. Sterneck E. Williams S.C. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1993; 4: 386-398Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar).

These structural data identified amino acids governing DNA-binding specificity at positions −1, +2, +3, and +6 of the α-helix of one zinc finger. The divergent residues between the homologous zinc fingers of Staf, ZNF76, and ZNF143 are essentially located in the two antiparallel β-strands and in the loop connecting them. Based on the structural data evoked above, it follows that the amino acids putatively involved in DNA recognition are fully conserved between Staf, ZNF76, and ZNF143, with the exception of the amino acid at position +6 in zinc finger 6 which is Asn in ZNF76 and Lys in Staf and ZNF143. The sequence of zinc finger 6 in ZNF76 does not match the consensus sequence of the C2-H2 type zinc finger: Φ-X-C-X2–5-C-X3-Φ-X5-Φ-X2-H-X3–5-H (Φ being a hydrophobic amino acid and X a nonconserved amino acid). This zinc finger contains only two amino acids between the two invariant His and three residues between the conserved hydrophobic Leu residue and the invariant distal His. However, our results showed that ZNF76 and ZNF143 have comparable affinities for the Staf responsive element contained in the X. laevistRNASec and human U6 promoters, revealing the neutral character of the amino acid changes in the sequences of the ZNF76 and ZNF143 DNA binding domains. This is further confirmed by sequence analysis of the mouse ortholog of ZNF76 (mEST AA475991) that revealed the presence of a K residue at position +6 in the α-helix of zinc finger 6, as ZNF143.Six regions are highly conserved from Xenopus Staf to human ZNF76 and ZNF143, outside of the zinc finger domain (referred to as regions I to VI). Regions I to IV, located in the N-terminal part of the proteins, partly encompass the mRNA transactivation domain and contain the four repeated units, a characteristic feature of this domain. The consensus sequence V/IXLXDGS/TXAY/FI/VH/Q (Xstands for any amino acid), derived from comparison of the repeated units in Staf, ZNF76, and ZNF143, contains the leucine and aspartic acid residues previously identified as essential for the Staf transactivation function (15Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2650-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The distance between the repeats represents 10–16 amino acids and only the sequence motif L/FEDG, located in front of repeat R3, is conserved in the inter-repeats. Conserved region V, also lying in the N-domain of the proteins, encompasses the Staf snRNA activation domain and possesses the amino acids found essential for that function. Although no specific biological function has been attributed yet to conserved region VI in the C-domain of Staf, its evolutionary conservation definitely points to an important activity.Previous work from our laboratory identified the human U2 snRNA, U4B snRNA, U4C snRNA, U6 snRNA, U11 snRNA, Y4 RNA, 7SK RNA, and tRNASec genes as direct targets of the transcriptional activator Staf (14Schaub M. Myslinski E. Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The present study extended this work by demonstrating that the human proteins ZNF76 and ZNF143 are highly identical and functionally equivalent to the Xenopus Staf. From this, it appears that the transcriptional activation of the human U2 snRNA, U4B snRNA, U4C snRNA, U6 snRNA, U11 snRNA, Y4 RNA, 7SK RNA, and tRNASec genes is dependent on ZNF76 and ZNF143. It is very likely that these proteins are also involved in the expression of many other genes, perhaps performing particular functions depending on the context of specific promoters. In this respect, we had previously shown that the Staf and Oct-1 transactivators can synergistically stimulate transcription from snRNA and snRNA-type promoters, from two adjacent specific binding sites (31Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that ZNF76 and ZNF143 can function differentially in their combinatorial action with Oct-1.In conclusion, our results imply that the presence of Staf responsive elements in a number of distal sequence elements of snRNA and snRNA-type genes does not necessarily mean that Staf is the unique factor capable of recognizing these elements to activate transcription. We have shown here that in human cells, at least another homologous factor, ZNF76, that has highly conserved Staf/ZNF143 regions also binds to Staf responsive elements with identical affinities and acts as a transcriptional activator as well. This finding reveals that Staf responsive elements are recognized by a family of transcription factors, in much the same way as other control elements like the Sp1 and octamer sites (32Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 33Dennig J. Beato M. Suske G.

Therefore, the discovery of ZNF76 and ZNF143 as Staf homologs introduces a novel complexity in the transcriptional regulation exerted through Staf responsive elements. Further functional investigations will be necessary to understand the interplay between ZNF76 and ZNF143.After completion of this manuscript, the characterization of the mouse Staf has been reported by others (35Adachi K. Saito H. Tanaka T. Oka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5598-5606Google Scholar). It appears that the identified mouse Staf is the ortholog of human ZNF143. Surprisingly, the authors described that, in Drosophila cells, a truncated mouse Staf containing the snRNA activation domain is unable to activate the mouse Pol III tRNASec reporter (35Adachi K. Saito H. Tanaka T. Oka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5598-5606Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that the mouse PSE sequence contained in this promoter is highly divergent from the Drosophila counterpart (36Wang Y. Stumph W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1570-1579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), therefore leading this promoter to be inactive in Drosophila cells. From this, it is likely that the mouse tRNASec Pol III promoter used in their study was TATA box-dependent only, therefore functioning as an RNA polymerase II mRNA promoter. Staf, originally identified in X. laevis, plays a pivotal role in transcriptional activation not only of snRNA and snRNA-type promoters by RNA Pol II and Pol III, but also of mRNA promoters. This activity is complex, arising from the action of two physically and functionally distinct activation domains acting specifically on snRNA and mRNA promoters (15Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2650-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In X. laevis, only one molecular species of Staf has been characterized (13Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Herein, we describe the characterization of the human Staf ortholog, ZNF143 (17Tommerup N. Vissing H. Genomics. 1995; 27: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and the identification of a novel DNA binding protein, ZNF76 (16Ragoussis J. Senger P. Mockridge I. Sanseau P. Ruddy S. Dudley K. Sheer D. Trowsdale J. Genomics. 1992; 14: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), with Staf-like properties. DNA binding and functional studies in vitro and in vivo showed that ZNF76 and ZNF143 can bind tightly to Staf responsive elements and transactivate Pol II and Pol III snRNA-type and mRNA promoters. These findings confirm that these proteins are two members of the same family. A Blast search of the mouse EST data base (mESTs) with the human ZNF76 and ZNF143 sequences at the National Center for Biotechnology Information revealed the presence of mESTs for both proteins (accession numbers: AA498451, AA475999, and W74814 for ZNF76; and AA153902 for ZNF143). Surprisingly, the mouse ortholog of ZNF76 contains the additional residues observed in the C-domain of human ZNF143, but absent in human ZNF76. From our and other studies, it appears that ZNF76 and ZNF143 are highly conserved in mammals. Additionally, only the Staf/ZNF143 ortholog is expressed in amphibian and bird cells (13Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,16Ragoussis J. Senger P. Mockridge I. Sanseau P. Ruddy S. Dudley K. Sheer D. Trowsdale J. Genomics. 1992; 14: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). ZNF76 and ZNF143 contain seven tandemly repeated zinc fingers of the C2-H2 type, similarly to Staf. The structure of the Staf DNA binding domain is still unknown, but the x-ray and/or NMR structures of other zinc finger-containing DNA-protein complexes, such as Zif268, GLI, Tramtrack, GAGA, YY1, and TFIIIA, have been solved (24Pavletich N.P.

https://openalex.org/W1586135756,"While ceramide has emerged as a potent signal transducer, inconsistencies in the kinetics of ceramide generation, or its absence, in response to stimuli have led to confusion and skepticism as to its potential role in apoptosis or proliferation. Here we show that in U937 and HL60 myeloid leukemia cells and in normal skin fibroblasts, cell-permeant ceramides can trigger neutral sphingomyelinase activation, sphingomyelin hydrolysis, and endogenous ceramide generation regardless of Bcl2 overexpression. These observations identify neutral sphingomyelinase as a novel target for ceramide and show that this positive feedback mechanism is responsible for signal propagation, as exemplified by mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in daunorubicin-treated cells. This study provides insight into a fundamental process of cell biology. Indeed, such a sustained ceramide-mediated signal throughout the apoptotic process would ensure self-destruction, perhaps by overriding evolutionary conserved primal cell survival mechanisms.—Jaffrezou, J.-P., Maestre, N., de Mas-mansat, V., Bezombes, C., Levade, T., Laurent, G.

https://openalex.org/W2125607711,"Syntrophins, a family of intracellular peripheral membrane proteins of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC), each contain a single PDZ domain. Syntrophin PDZ domains bind C-terminal peptide sequences with the consensus R/K-E-S/T-X-V-COOH, an interaction that mediates association of skeletal muscle sodium channels with the DAPC. Here, we have isolated cyclic peptide ligands for syntrophin PDZ domains from a library of combinatorial peptides displayed at the N terminus of protein III of bacteriophage M13. Affinity selection from a library ofX10C peptides yielded ligands with the consensusX-(R/K)-E-T-C-L/M-A-G-X-Ψ-C, where Ψ represents any hydrophobic amino acid. These peptides contain residues (underlined) similar to the C-terminal consensus sequence for binding to syntrophin PDZ domains and bind to the same site on syntrophin PDZ domains as C-terminal peptides, but do not bind to other closely related PDZ domains. PDZ binding is dependent on the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond in the peptides, since treatment with dithiothreitol, or substitution of either of the two cysteines with alanines, eliminated this activity. Furthermore, amino acid replacements revealed that most residues in the phage-selected peptides are required for binding.

They were first described as a series of three internal, repeated elements within the post-synaptic density (PSD)-95 protein (1Cho K.O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). In fact, the name PDZ is derived from three proteins first recognized to contain repeats of this domain: PSD-95; the Drosophila discs-large tumor suppressor protein, Dlg; and the mammalian tight-junction protein zona occludens-1, ZO-1 (2Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 451-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 3Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Mech. Dev. 1993; 44: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 4Itoh M.

Sci. 1995; 20: 350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). PDZ domains have since been identified in a large number of multifunctional proteins, many of which are associated with specialized regions of cell to cell contact such as tight junctions, septate junctions, and synaptic junctions (6Kornau H.C. Seeburg P.H. Kennedy M.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The PDZ domain may be an evolutionarily old domain, as it has been detected in mammalian, nematode, yeast, plant, and bacterial genomic sequences by computer analysis (7Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).

PDZ domains mediate protein-protein interactions by at least two distinct mechanisms. Certain PDZ domains bind directly to specific recognition sequences at the C terminus of transmembrane proteins. For example, the second PDZ domain of PSD-95 interacts with an S/T-X-V-COOH motif in N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor 2B subunits (8Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar, 9Kim E. Cho K.O. Rothschild A. Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) and in Shaker-type potassium channels (10Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). PDZ domains can also form heterotypic dimers with other PDZ domains. For instance, the N-terminal region of nNOS, which itself contains a PDZ domain, binds directly to PDZ domains in both PSD-95 and α1-syntrophin, a component of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) (11Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). A third possible mode of interaction, in which the consensus binding sequence is located internally, is suggested by the observation that the PDZ domain in theDrosophila InaD photoreceptor protein interacts with a S/T-X-V sequence near, but not at, the C terminus of the transient receptor potential Ca+2 channel (12Shieh B.H. Zhu M.Y. Neuron. 1996; 16: 991-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). More recently, the PDZ domain in the actinin-associated LIM protein has been shown to bind to unidentified sequences within the internal spectrin-like repeats of α-actinin (13Xia H. Winokur S.T. Kuo W.L. Altherr M.R. Bredt D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Thus, PDZ domains may take part in several diverse types of interactions. The structures of several PDZ domains, alone and complexed with peptides, have been deduced (14Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 15Cabral J.H. Petosa C. Sutcliffe M.J. Raza S. Byron O. Poy F. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Liddington R.C.

Biol. 1998; 5: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The PDZ domain has an overall structure very much like the phosphotyrosine binding domain, even though they are unrelated in function (17Cowburn D. Structure. 1996; 4: 1005-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 18Harrison S.C. Cell. 1996; 86: 341-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Essentially, it is a globular domain formed by six β strands (designated βA–βF) and two α helices (designated αA and αB) arranged into an up-and-down β-barrel (14Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E.

Chishti A.H. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Analysis of the crystal structure of the third PDZ domain of Dlg revealed a groove on the surface that ends in a conserved hydrophobic pocket created by the βB strand, the αB helix, and a loop connecting the βA and βB strands (15Cabral J.H. Petosa C. Sutcliffe M.J. Raza S. Byron O. Poy F. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of a S/T-X-V-COOH peptide ligand complexed with the third PDZ domain of PSD-95 revealed that the peptide binds within this groove and that the terminal carboxylate group of the peptide inserts into the hydrophobic pocket (14Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). The specificity of binding is determined by the interaction of certain residues in the PDZ domain with side chains of the last three or four residues of the C-terminal peptide. The specificities of several different PDZ domains have been defined using combinatorial peptide libraries (16Schultz J. Hoffmuller U. Krause G. Ashurst J. Macias M.J. Schmieder P. Schneider-Mergener J. Oschkinat H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 19Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A.

Bredt D.S. Li M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The peptide ligand preferences of one family of nine PDZ domains was shown to beX-S/T-X-V/I-COOH, where X was either any, or a preferred amino acid, depending on the PDZ domain (19Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Recently, the PDZ domain of α1-syntrophin was shown to be selective for peptides with a similar motif, R/K/Q-E-S/T-X-V-COOH (16Schultz J. Hoffmuller U. Krause G. Ashurst J. Macias M.J. Schmieder P. Schneider-Mergener J. Oschkinat H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The C termini of two skeletal muscle sodium channels (NaChs) conform to this consensus and bind directly to the PDZ domains of α1-, β1-, and β2-syntrophins (21Gee S.H. Madhavan R. Levinson S.R. Caldwell J.H. Sealock R. Froehner S.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This interaction mediates the association of NaChs with the DAPC and links them to the cortical actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. In this report, we utilized phage-displayed combinatorial peptide libraries to define the specificities of the PDZ domains of α1-, β1-, and β2-syntrophin. We have isolated novel peptide ligands for syntrophin PDZ domains which conform to the consensus sequence K/R-E-(S/T)-X-(V/L/I/M)-COOH previously determined to bind syntrophin PDZ domains, but lack a C-terminal carboxylate group. Instead, these peptides are able to interact with syntrophin PDZ domains when fused to either the N terminus of a bacteriophage M13 capsid protein or bacterial alkaline phosphatase (AP). Cyclization of these peptides through intramolecular disulfide bond formation was found to be essential for binding to syntrophin PDZ domains since reduction with DTT, or replacement of cysteines with alanine, eliminated this interaction. These cyclic peptide ligands appear to be specific for syntrophin PDZ domains since several other closely related PDZ domains do not bind them. Additional experiments showed that these peptides bind to the same site on syntrophin PDZ domains as C-terminal peptides and suggest that they act as C-terminal peptide mimetics. Our results define a novel mode of binding of peptide ligands to PDZ domains and suggest that proteins containing similar conformationally constrained peptide sequences may be capable of interacting with other PDZ domain-containing proteins. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of the PDZ domain of mouse α1-, β1-, and β2-syntrophins were prepared in the following manner. Oligonucleotides were designed to flank the PDZ domains and the regions were selectively amplified from cDNA clones by polymerase chain reaction (22Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13517) Google Scholar). The amplified segments were subcloned between theBamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and recombinants were verified by DNA sequencing. GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. To screen the phage-displayed combinatorial peptide libraries, microtiter plate wells were first coated with 1 μg of a GST fusion protein of the β1-syntrophin PDZ domain, blocked with SuperBlock® (Pierce), and then 1014 recombinant phage particles were added. After incubation for 2 h at room temperature, the wells were washed of excess phage, and the bound phage were recovered by the addition of 50 μl of glycine, pH 2.0. Two libraries were screened in this manner: X12 andX10C, where X is any amino acid encoded by the degenerate NN(G/T) codons. These peptides were displayed at the N terminus of mature capsid protein III of phage particles (23Smith G.P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1993; 128: 1-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). After three rounds of affinity selection, isolates were tested for binding to GST-PDZ fusion proteins by ELISA (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The DNA sequences of binding phage were determined and the peptide sequences predicted with MacVector® software (IBI-Kodak, New Haven, CT). The binding properties of isolated phage were determined by ELISA. Microtiter plate wells were coated with equal amounts of various GST fusion proteins, washed, blocked with bovine serum albumin and then incubated with 1011 plaque- forming units. The amount of bound phage was quantitated with anti-phage antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The ability of the phage to bind to wells was also monitored in the presence of the reducing agent, DTT. The insert of the phage isolate F was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction with flanking oligonucleotides, digested with SalI andXbaI, and ligated into pMY101 (24Yamabhai M. Kay B.K. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Bacteria, harboring the resulting recombinant plasmid, secreted a chimeric protein with the peptide fused to the N terminus of Escherichia coli AP into the culture medium, upon induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The conditioned medium was then added to microtiter plate wells coated with various proteins, with or without soluble competitor peptides, and the amount of enzyme retained in the wells after 1 h incubation was quantitated with the colorimetric substrate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Optical absorbance of wells was measured at 405 nm wavelength with a plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Each amino acid of one ligand sequence, AKETCLAGYYC, was independently substituted by alanine and fused to the N terminus of AP using standard molecular biological methods. A peptide ligand-AP fusion, in which the two cysteines were substituted with serines, was generated in the same manner. All 12 chimeric proteins were tested for their ability to bind GST fusion proteins of the α1-, β1-, and β2-syntrophin PDZ domains immobilized on microtiter plates. Wells were coated with 0.5 μg of the purified syntrophin PDZ domain fusion proteins or with anti-FLAG M1 antibody (Boehringer Mannheim), and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.3, for 1 h at room temperature. Wells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with bacterial culture media conditioned with each of the peptide ligand-AP fusions (24Yamabhai M. Kay B.K. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). After extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and 0.1% Tween 20, the amount of the AP retained in the wells was quantitated after addition ofp-nitrophenyl phosphate by measuring optical absorbance at 405-nm wavelength. N-terminal biotinylated peptides corresponding to the phage F insert (AKETCLAGYYCS-COOH), the C terminus of the SkM1 skeletal muscle sodium channel (PGQTVRPGVKESLV-COOH) and the C terminus of Fas (ENSNFRNEIQSLV-COOH) were synthesized. All synthetic peptides contained an N-terminal three amino acid (SGS) linker sequence. The identities of all peptides were determined by mass spectroscopy. Peptides were dissolved either in water, or in Me2SO, then diluted with water until the organic solvent was less than 1%. The binding of the peptides to various proteins was followed in two ways. Overlay assays with biotinylated peptides (used at a final concentration of 1 μm) were performed as described previously (21Gee S.H. Madhavan R. Levinson S.R. Caldwell J.H. Sealock R. Froehner S.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isolation of syntrophins from skeletal muscle extracts with peptides coupled to streptavidin-linked beads (Sigma) was carried out as described previously (21Gee S.H. Madhavan R. Levinson S.R. Caldwell J.H. Sealock R. Froehner S.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Measurements of peptide F mass were performed on a Micromass Quattro II triple quadrapole electrospray ionization mass spectrometer. Peptide F was dissolved in neat methanol and infused directly into the electrospray source. The m/zrange for data collection was set from 700 to 2000. All experiments were performed on a BIAcore 2000 instrument (BIAcore Inc., Piscataway, NJ) at the University of North Carolina Macromolecular Interactions Facility. Biotinylated peptides were immobilized on Neutravidin (Pierce)-coated sensor chips as described previously (21Gee S.H. Madhavan R. Levinson S.R. Caldwell J.H. Sealock R. Froehner S.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing concentrations of syntrophin PDZ domains were injected onto the peptide surfaces at a flow rate of 20 μl/min for 2 min in 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P-20. Between successive measurements the surfaces were regenerated with 10 mm HCl (2-min contact time). Binding to Neutravidin alone was also measured and was used to subtract nonspecific interactions. Blank sensorgrams recorded for injection of running buffer were also subtracted. Background corrected sensorgrams were fitted to a single site binding model using the numerical integration functions of the BIAevaluation 3.0 software (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The steady state binding value,Req, for each PDZ analyte concentration was then plotted as a function of analyte concentration. To derive binding constants, data from these plots were analyzed by the steady state affinity binding model provided in the BIAevaluation software (25Morelock M.M. Ingraham R.H. Betageri R. Jakes S. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 26Myszka D.G. Arulanantham P.R. Sana T. Wu Z. Morton T.A. Ciardelli T.L.

The reported values are the average of four separate experiments. Three syntrophin isoforms, α1, β1, and β2, are encoded by separate genes but have an identical domain organization (28Adams M.E. Dwyer T.M. Dowler L.L. White R.A. Froehner S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25859-25865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 29Ahn A.H. Freener C.A. Gussoni E. Yoshida M. Ozawa E. Kunkel L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2724-2730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Each syntrophin contains a single PDZ domain, which is 78–84% identical in primary structure among the three isoforms (28Adams M.E. Dwyer T.M. Dowler L.L. White R.A. Froehner S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25859-25865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To identify peptide ligands for syntrophin PDZ domains, we screened a bacteriophage M13 library displaying combinatorial peptides of the type X12 (whereX is any amino acid encoded by NN(G/T) codons) with a recombinant GST fusion protein of the β1-syntrophin PDZ domain. After three rounds of affinity selection, individual phage isolates were tested for binding. No positive isolates were selected using this library. We next screened a library of the typeX10C, where every peptide had 10 random residues followed by a fixed cysteine residue. Seven independent phage were isolated from a library of 109 different peptides that encoded three different, but related peptide sequences (Fig.1). The peptides share the consensus sequence X-(R/K)-E-T-C-(L/M)-A-G-X-Ψ-C-COOH, where Ψ represents a hydrophobic residue. Next, we determined the specificity of three phage isolates, each representing a unique peptide sequence, for different PDZ domains. Microtiter wells coated with equivalent amounts of GST fusion proteins of α1-, β1-, and β2-syntrophin PDZ domains, as well as a fusion protein containing the PDZ domain of nNOS (amino acids 1–150), were incubated with equivalent amounts (1010plaque-forming units) of phage particles. The binding of the phage particles was monitored by ELISA. Positive and negative control targets consisted of GST fused to the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain and GST alone, respectively. Phage isolates B, D, and F bound best to the β2-syntrophin PDZ domain and nearly equivalently to the PDZ domains of α1- and β1-syntrophin (Fig.2 A). In contrast, the three phage isolates did not bind to either the nNOS PDZ or Src SH3 domains above background (i.e. GST alone). Moreover, phage displaying a peptide ligand for the Src SH3 domain bound to the GST-Src SH3 domain but not to any of the PDZ domains tested. Thus, although the peptides were selected with the β1-syntrophin PDZ domain, they bound better to the β2-syntrophin PDZ domain than to either α1 or β1. These differences in binding may reflect either the different specificities of the PDZ domains or the ability to retain their native conformations when immobilized on plastic. To demonstrate that the peptide sequences shown in Fig. 1 are necessary and sufficient for binding, one insert sequence (phage F, AKETCLAGYYC) was cloned into the pMY101 vector (24Yamabhai M. Kay B.K. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Bacteria harboring the resulting recombinant produce an enzymatically active E. coli AP fusion protein with the peptide at the N terminus and secrete it into the culture supernatant. Equivalent amounts of this fusion protein (designated peptide F-AP) or a Src SH3 ligand-AP fusion protein were incubated in microtiter wells containing a variety of GST fusion proteins. As shown in Fig. 2 B, peptide F-AP bound best to the PDZ domain of β2-syntrophin and somewhat less well to the PDZ domains of α1- and β1- syntrophin, mirroring the specificity observed in the phage ELISA experiment. Moreover, peptide F-AP did not bind to the PDZ domain of nNOS, the Src SH3 domain, or GST alone. In contrast, the Src SH3 ligand-AP fusion bound only to the GST-Src SH3 fusion protein. These results demonstrate that the phage F peptide sequence is sufficient for binding to all three syntrophin PDZ domains, even when fused to the N terminus of AP. Even though the location of only one cysteine was specified within the X10C peptides, all three isolates had a second cysteine spaced six residues from the first. To determine whether or not these cysteine residues were disulfide-bridged in the phage-displayed peptides, we tested the effect of the reducing agent DTT on binding. Equivalent numbers of phage particles were incubated in microtiter wells coated with approximately equal amounts of the β1-syntrophin PDZ domain fusion protein and the extent of binding was determined by phage ELISA. As shown in Fig.3, binding of three phage isolates (B, E, and F) to the target decreased with increasing DTT concentration. Fifty percent inhibition (IC50) was observed at approximately 2–5 mm DTT. Since PDZ domains lack disulfide bonds, this decreased binding can be attributed to the reduction of disulfide bonds in the displayed peptides by DTT. In contrast, the binding of a Src SH3 domain-binding phage (30Sparks A.B. Quilliam L.A. Thorn J.M. Der C.J. Kay B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23853-23856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to the Src SH3 domain was unaffected over the same range of DTT concentrations. In this case neither the SH3 domain nor the peptide ligand have cysteines. The binding of the peptide F-AP fusion protein to syntrophin PDZ domains was also DTT sensitive (not shown) suggesting that it forms disulfide bonds as well. These data suggest that conformational constraint imparted by the disulfide bond in these peptides is required for binding to syntrophin PDZ domains. To test this idea directly, we substituted both cysteines in the peptide F sequence with serines. This simultaneous replacement completely abolished binding of the peptide F-AP fusion to all three syntrophin PDZ domains (Fig. 4), confirming the importance of the structural constraint of the peptide for binding. To evaluate the contribution of each residue in the peptide to the binding of syntrophin PDZ domains, we produced peptides with alanine substitutions at each position. Consistent with the results of the serine replacement, alanine-substitution of either cysteine resulted in a complete loss of binding (Fig. 4). Furthermore, substitution of most residues in the peptide greatly diminished binding to all three PDZ domains, whereas alanine-substitution of the lysine at position 2 (numbering from the N terminus) and the tyrosine at position 10 resulted in only a partial loss of binding. Interestingly, alanine-substitution of the tyrosine at position 9 improved the apparent binding to all three syntrophin PDZ domains. This residue was the least conserved among the three initial peptide ligands for the β1- syntrophin PDZ domain, suggesting that there is potential to improve the binding efficiency of this ligand further by varying the identity of the residue at this position. We recently reported that peptides corresponding to the C terminus of two skeletal muscle sodium channels (designated SkM1 and SkM2) with the motif R/K-E-S/T-X-V-COOH, bound strongly to syntrophin PDZ domains (21Gee S.H. Madhavan R. Levinson S.R. Caldwell J.H. Sealock R. Froehner S.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Schultz et al. (16Schultz J. Hoffmuller U. Krause G. Ashurst J. Macias M.J. Schmieder P. Schneider-Mergener J. Oschkinat H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) obtained a similar consensus (R/K/Q-E-S/T-X-V-COOH) for α1-syntrophin PDZ domain ligands using combinatorial peptide libraries. Together, our results define the ligand preferences of syntrophin PDZ domains. Close inspection of the consensus sequence in Fig. 1(X-R/K-E-T-C-L/M-A-G-X-Ψ-C) revealed a remarkable likeness (residues underlined) to the C-terminal consensus for binding to syntrophin PDZ domains. To test the hypothesis that the phage-displayed peptides isolated here bind syntrophin PDZ domains at the same site as C-terminal peptides, peptide F-AP and Src SH3 ligand-AP fusion proteins were added to microtiter wells coated with the β1-syntrophin PDZ domain fusion protein in the presence of increasing concentrations of soluble C-terminal peptides. Binding of peptide F-AP to the β1- syntrophin PDZ domain was blocked by the SkM1 peptide (K-E-S-L-V-COOH) but not by a peptide corresponding to the C terminus of the Fas antigen (I-Q-S-L-V-COOH), a ligand for the PDZ domain of the Fas-associated protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPL1/Fas-associated protein-1 (31Yanagisawa J. Takahashi M. Kanki H. Yano-Yanagisawa H. Tazunoki T. Sawa E. Nishitoba T. Kamishohara M. Kobayashi E. Kataoka S. Sato T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8539-8545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The IC50value of the SkM1 peptide was ∼30 μm. Neither of the two peptides blocked, at any concentration tested, the binding of the Src SH3 ligand-AP to the Src SH3 domain fusion protein. The PDZ domain of α1-syntrophin binds directly to nNOS, presumably by forming PDZ:PDZ heterodimers (11Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H.

As previously reported, the SkM2 NaCh C-terminal peptide inhibited the binding of nNOS to syntrophin PDZ domains (21Gee S.H. Madhavan R. Levinson S.R. Caldwell J.H. Sealock R. Froehner S.C. J. Neu"
https://openalex.org/W2122210884,"The binding of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 particles to CD4+ cells could be blocked either by antibodies against the V3 loop domain of the viral external envelope glycoprotein gp120, or by the V3 loop mimicking pseudopeptide 5[Kψ(CH2N)PR]-TASP, which forms a stable complex with a cell-surface-expressed 95-kDa protein. Here, by using an affinity matrix containing 5[Kψ(CH2N)PR]-TASP and cytoplasmic extracts from human CEM cells, we purified three V3 loop-binding proteins of 95, 40, and 30 kDa, which after microsequencing were revealed to be as nucleolin, putative HLA class II-associated protein (PHAP) II, and PHAP I, respectively. The 95-kDa cell-surface protein was also isolated and found to be nucleolin. We show that recombinant preparations of gp120 bind the purified preparations containing the V3 loop-binding proteins with a high affinity, comparable to the binding of gp120 to soluble CD4. Such binding is inhibited either by 5[Kψ(CH2N)PR]-TASP or antibodies against the V3 loop. Moreover, these purified preparations inhibit HIV entry into CD4+ cells as efficiently as soluble CD4.

This fusion requires first the binding of HIV external and transmembrane envelope glycoprotein complex to the CD4 receptor, and is dependent on the presence of cofactors on the cell surface (for reviews, see Refs. 1D'Souza M.P. Harden V.A. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1293-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar and 2Moore J.P. Jameson B.A. Weiss R.A. Sattentau Q.J. Bentz J. Viral Fusion Mechanisms. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 233-289Google Scholar). The external envelope glycoprotein contains the binding site for the CD4 receptor and an hypervariable region of about 36 amino acids referred to as the V3 loop. The transmembrane glycoprotein contains a potential fusion peptide at its amino terminus that is implicated in the membrane fusion process. The external and transmembrane glycoproteins (gp120-gp41 for HIV-1) are associated in a noncovalent manner to generate a functional complex in which the V3 loop plays a critical role (3Moore J.P. Nara P.L. AIDS. 1991; 5: S21-S33Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Throughout the years, several potential cofactors of CD4 have been proposed in order to explain why CD4 molecule is essential but not sufficient for HIV entry and infection. Accordingly, several cell-surface proteins (reviewed in Ref. 4Callebaut C. Jacotot E. Krust B. Guichard G. Blanco J. Valenzuela A. Svab J. Muller S. Briand J.-P. Hovanessian A.G. J. Biol.

More recently, however, convincing evidence was provided by several laboratories to show that the G protein-coupled chemokine receptors, such as fusin/CXCR4 and CCR5, serve as essential cofactors for the entry of T cell (lymphotropic) and macrophage-tropic HIV-1 isolates, respectively (7Choe H.

Consequently, chemokines specific for CXCR4 and CCR5 receptors inhibit efficiently T cell and macrophage tropic HIV-1 isolates, respectively. Interestingly, chemokines inhibit HIV entry without affecting the binding of HIV particles to cells (14Oberlin E. Amara A. Bachelerie F. Bessia C. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Schwartz O.

Several groups have proposed that HIV-1 binding to CD4+cells creates a high affinity interaction site for the cofactor CCR5/CXCR4, and that in this mechanism, the V3 loop plays an important role (7Choe H.

Consequently, as these latter experiments were carried out by investigating the binding of soluble gp120 to the cell surface, it remains difficult to eliminate the possibility for the existence of complementary interactions of gp120 with other cell-surface proteins. Previously, it has been considered that the expression of human CD4 in human or heterologous cells is sufficient for the binding of HIV particles to cells (20Bour S. Geleziunas R. Wainberg M.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 63-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we and others have recently demonstrated that this latter conclusion is not correct and was due to the use of soluble gp120 instead of HIV particles (21Ugolini S. Mondor I. Parren P.W.H.I. Burton D.R. Tilley S. Klasse P.J. Sattentau Q.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 22Valenzuela A. Blanco J. Krust B. Franco R. Hovanessian A.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, HIV particles, which do not infect CD4-negative human or heterologous cells, have the capacity to bind such cells. Interestingly, monoclonal antibodies directed against the V3 loop inhibit significantly HIV binding to CD4− human or murine cells (22Valenzuela A. Blanco J. Krust B. Franco R. Hovanessian A.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, in the CD4+ HIV permissive human cell lines, HIV binding is blocked by monoclonal antibodies directed against either the gp120 binding site in CD4 or against the V3 loop (21Ugolini S. Mondor I. Parren P.W.H.I. Burton D.R. Tilley S. Klasse P.J. Sattentau Q.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 22Valenzuela A. Blanco J. Krust B. Franco R. Hovanessian A.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should be emphasized that the inhibition of HIV binding in the presence of anti-V3 loop antibodies is not the direct consequence of gp120 shedding from HIV particles or of a decreased affinity of CD4 or gp120 for binding to its surface counterpart (22Valenzuela A. Blanco J. Krust B. Franco R. Hovanessian A.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, anti-V3 loop antibodies bind HIV virions and prevent the binding of HIV to CD4+ cells, despite the fact that the CD4-binding domain of gp120 remains accessible for a potential interaction with CD4 (21Ugolini S. Mondor I. Parren P.W.H.I. Burton D.R. Tilley S. Klasse P.J. Sattentau Q.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 22Valenzuela A. Blanco J. Krust B. Franco R. Hovanessian A.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations have indicated that the neutralizing effect of anti-V3 loop antibodies is not a post-binding event as it has been considered before, and have suggested the existence of other cell-surface molecules besides CD4 for stable binding of HIV particles to cells. Moreover, the inhibition of virus binding to CD4− cells in the presence of anti-V3 loop antibodies have pointed out the importance of the V3 loop in the HIV binding process. Accordingly, HIV binding appear to require both CD4 and cell-surface components interacting directly with the V3 loop (21Ugolini S. Mondor I. Parren P.W.H.I. Burton D.R. Tilley S. Klasse P.J. Sattentau Q.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 22Valenzuela A. Blanco J. Krust B. Franco R. Hovanessian A.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that the pseudopeptide 5[Kψ(CH2N)PR]-TASP, which mimics the V3 loop, is a potent inhibitor of HIV entry by a specific interaction with protein components on the cell surface, other than the CD4 molecule (4Callebaut C. Jacotot E. Krust B. Guichard G. Blanco J. Valenzuela A. Svab J. Muller S. Briand J.-P. Hovanessian A.G. J. Biol.

Furthermore, we demonstrated that 5[Kψ(CH2N)PR]-TASP binds and becomes complexed with a cell-surface-expressed 95-kDa protein (4Callebaut C. Jacotot E. Krust B. Guichard G. Blanco J. Valenzuela A.

This pseudopeptide inhibitor blocks the binding of HIV particles to CD4+ cells, as neutralizing antibodies against the CD4 receptor or antibodies against the V3 loop (4Callebaut C. Jacotot E.

Here, by using an affinity matrix containing either 5[Kψ(CH2N)PR]-TASP or a synthetic V3 loop peptide, we report the isolation of nucleolin, PHAP II and PHAP I as three V3 loop-binding proteins (V3-BPs). The 95-kDa cell-surface protein, by virtue of its capacity to bind 5[Kψ(CH2N)PR]-TASP and form a stable complex with it (4Callebaut C. Jacotot E. Krust B. Guichard G. Blanco J. Valenzuela A. Svab J.

The identity of nucleolin, PHAP II, and PHAP I was confirmed by their respective reactivity with polyclonal antibodies raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to the NH2terminus of each one of them. These three proteins were demonstrated to bind a synthetic peptide corresponding to the sequence of HIV-1 V3 loop; consequently, they were referred to as V3-BPs. Recombinant preparations of gp120 were then used to demonstrate the specific binding of gp120 to purified preparations containing the three V3-BPs. No binding was observed with the transmembrane envelope glycoprotein gp41 of HIV-1, or with histone H3, which is rich in basic positively-charged amino acids. Interestingly, monoclonal antibodies directed against the V3 loop domain block the binding of gp120 to V3-BPs. The binding of gp120 to V3-BPs is also inhibited by 5[Kψ(CH2N)PR]-TASP. These results, and the observation that the V3-BPs block HIV entry as efficiently as soluble CD4, are consistent with the implication of nucleolin, PHAP II, and PHAP I as potential V3 loop receptors functioning in the process of HIV particle binding to CD4+ cells. Recombinant gp120 and gp41 (produced by the baculovirus and Escherichia coli expression system, respectively) of HIV-1 Lai (IIIB), and recombinant soluble CD4 (produced in CHO cells or by the baculovirus expression system) were purchased from Neosystem Laboratories, Strasbourg, France. Other recombinant preparations of gp120 corresponding to that of HIV-1 isolates, LAV (or Lai), MN (both from MicroGeneSys, Inc., Meriden, CT), SF2, and the unglycosylated gp120-SF2 (Env 2–3; from Dr. K. Steimer; Chiron Corp. were obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health. The gp120 MN and Lai (LAV) were produced in insect cells using baculovirus, gp120 SF2 was produced in CHO cells, whereas the unglycosylated gp120 SF2 was produced in the yeast. The concentration of p24 was measured by p24 Core Profile ELISA (DuPont). CEM cells (clone 13) derived from human lymphoid cell line CEM (provided by L. Montagnier, Institut Pasteur, France) were cultured in suspension medium RPMI 1640 (Bio-Whittaker, Verviers, Belgium). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors were prepared by Ficoll Hypaque density gradient centrifugation, and suspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (23Callebaut C. Jacotot E. Guichard G. Krust B. Rey-Cuille M.A. Cointe D. Benkirane N. Blanco J. Muller S. Briand J.P. Hovanessian A.G. Virology. 1996; 218: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Human HeLa-CD4-LTR-β-gal cells (from Dr. F. Clavel, Institut Pasteur, Paris) were cultured in Dulbecco's medium (24Dragic T. Charneau P. Clavel F. Alizon M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4794-4802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All cells were cultured with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated (56 °C, 30 min) fetal calf serum. Cells were first washed extensively in PBS before lysis in buffer E (100 μl/3 × 107 cells) and the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation (350 g for 5 min). Buffer E contains 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm PMSF, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, aprotinin (1000 units/ml) and 0.5% Triton X-100. The nuclei-free supernatant was further centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was stored at −80 °C. Routinely, cell extracts were prepared 24 h after cell passage. HeLa cells were cotransfected by electroporation with plasmids pNL4–3 defective in env gene (25Borman A.M. Quillent C. Charneau P. Dauguet C. Clavel F. J.

The V3 loop sequences corresponded to that from the HIV-1 Lai NCTRPNNNTRKSIRIQRGPGRAFVTIGKIGNMRQAHCNIS, and HIV-1 Ba-L NCTRPNNNTRKSIHIGPGRAFYTTGEIIGDIRQAHCNLS isolate. The V3 loop peptides were synthesized using classical Fmoc chemistry. The biotin was added at the NH2 terminus of the peptide. The loop structure was generated by air oxidation at pH 8, in a 10% Me2SO water solution under vigorous stirring for 4 days at room temperature. The final products were more than 90% pure. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis was carried out as described previously (4Callebaut C. Jacotot E. Krust B. Guichard G. Blanco J. Valenzuela A. Svab J. Muller S. Briand J.-P.

Avidin-agarose (3 ml; ImmunoPure immobilized avidin, Pierce) in PBS was incubated (18 h, 4 °C) in the presence of the biotin-labeled 5[Kψ(CH2N)PR]-TASP (20 μm) before washing extensively in PBS-EDTA (PBS containing 1 mm EDTA). Cytoplasmic extracts (material corresponding to 2 × 109 CEM cells; Ref. 4Callebaut C. Jacotot E. Krust B. Guichard G. Blanco J. Valenzuela A. Svab J. Muller S. Briand J.-P. Hovanessian A.G. J. Biol.

The purified proteins were eluted by 1 m NaCl solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 20% (v/v) glycerol. The eluted sample was dialyzed overnight against PBS containing 0.1 mm EDTA and 1 mm PMSF and aliquots stored at −80 °C. For microsequencing, the purified proteins (100 μg) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the different protein bands were visualized after a slight staining with Amido Black. The respective bands were excised from the gel and digested with endo-lysine C, which cleaves peptides adjacent to lysine residues. The peptides were purified by HPLC (DEAE-C18) using a gradient of acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid 0.1%. The microsequencing was carried out by the Micro-Sequencing Laboratory at Institut Pasteur. Twenty four h after passaging, CEM cells (109 cells) were washed extensively with PBS before incubation (4 °C, 30 min) in 10 ml of FACS buffer with 15 μm biotin-labeled 5[Kψ(CH2N)PR]-TASP. Cells were then washed in FACS buffer (2 × 100 ml), and nucleus-free cell extracts were prepared using buffer E (3 ml). Such extracts were first diluted in PBS (12 ml) prior the addition of 1 ml of avidin-agarose to capture the biotin-labeled TASP complexed to p95. These suspensions were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h, and then washed batchwise with PBS (6 × 60 ml). Finally, the avidin-agarose pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of 2-fold concentrated electrophoresis sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2m urea, 1% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 150 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 20% glycerol, (v/v)) and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Three 250-μl aliquots of the purified preparation were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 7.5% polyacrylamide slab gel. The p95 band was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride sheets (Bio-Rad) before microsequencing the NH2 terminus. Peptides corresponding to the NH2terminus of nucleolin (residues 1–26), PHAP II (residues 1–23), PHAP I (residues 1–20), and CXCR4 (residues 1–27) were synthesized according to conventional Fmoc chemistry on a multichannel peptide synthesizer. The peptides were conjugated to ovalbumin through the cysteine residue added at the COOH termini of each peptide. Rabbits were immunized five times at 2-week intervals by intramuscular injections with the coupled material (150 μg of peptide/injection/animal). The first injection was performed in the presence of complete Freund's adjuvant (Difco, West Molesey, UK), and the following injections were done with incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The antisera were titrated by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) for the production of antibodies by monitoring reactivity with the respective peptides. The microtiter plates were coated with the purified preparation of the V3-BPs at different concentrations (12.5–200 ng/ml before incubation with either gp120 (1 ng/ml), gp41 (2 ng/ml), or histone H3 (5 ng/ml). After extensive washing, the binding of different reagents was monitored using specific antibodies: mAb 110-D (1 μg/ml) specific for residues 381–394 of gp120 of HIV-1, mAb 41-A (1 μg/ml) specific for gp41, and mAb specific for histone H3 (2 μg/ml) (36Benkirane N.

As control antibodies, we used mAb OKT4A specific for CD4 and a rabbit antiserum against CXCR4 (at 1:200 dilution). For real time binding experiments, a BIAcoreTM biosensor system (Pharmacia Biosensor, AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used. Experimental procedures were as described previously (36Benkirane N. Guichard G.

The purified preparation of the V3-BPs (100 ng/ml) was immobilized on the sensor chips to characterize the binding with the peptides 5[Kψ(CH2N)PR]-TASP and 5(KPR)-TASP, or the gp120 preparations (each at 800 nm). The HIV-1 entry was monitored indirectly in HeLa-CD4-LTR-β-gal cells containing the bacterial lacZ gene under the control of HIV-1 LTR. HIV-1 entry and replication results in the activation of the HIV-1 LTR leading to the expression of β-galactosidase (24Dragic T. Charneau P. Clavel F. Alizon M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4794-4802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated at 104 cells/well in 96-well plates, and at 24 h later cell monolayers were infected with HIV-1 Lai (a dose containing 20 ng of p24). At 48 h, cell monolayers were washed with PBS before lysis of cells in 100 μl/well of buffer-L containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, 100 μl of the reaction mix containing 10 mmphosphate buffer at pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 600 mm chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside was added in each well. The 96-well plate was then incubated at 37 °C, and the β-galactosidase activity was measured at 10-min intervals in a microplate reader using a 570 nm filter. We have previously demonstrated that 5[Kψ(CH2N)PR]-TASP binds specifically to the surface of CEM cells and blocks the binding of HIV particles to cells (4Callebaut C. Jacotot E. Krust B. Guichard G.

Because calmodulin is essential for quiescent cells to enter cell cycle, the role of calmodulin on ERK2 activation was studied in cultured fibroblasts. Serum, phorbol esters, or active Ras induced ERK2 activation in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. This activation was not inhibited by calmodulin blockade. Surprisingly, inhibition of calmodulin prior to fetal bovine serum addition prolonged activation of ERK2. Furthermore, inactivation of calmodulin in serum-starved cells induced ERK2 phosphorylation that was dependent on MAP kinase kinase (MEK). Inactivation of calmodulin in serum-starved cells also induced activation of Ras, Raf, and MEK. On the contrary, tyrosine phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase receptors was not observed. These results indicate that calmodulin inhibits ERK2 activation pathway at the level of Ras. Calmodulin inhibition induced overexpression of p21cip1 which was dependent on MEK activity. We propose that inhibition of Ras by calmodulin prevents the activation of ERK2 at low serum concentration. Thus, entering into the cell cycle after serum addition would imply the overcoming of the inhibitory effect of calmodulin and consequently ERK2 activation. Furthermore, down-regulation of Ras by calmodulin may be also important to determine the duration of ERK2 activation and to prevent a high p21cip1 expression that would lead to an inhibition of cell proliferation.

Furthermore, down-regulation of Ras by calmodulin may be also important to determine the duration of ERK2 activation and to prevent a high p21cip1 expression that would lead to an inhibition of cell proliferation. Cells have evolved signal transduction pathways that allow them to respond to extracellular signals. Those signaling pathways will lead to the regulation of effector proteins that will finally cause cell proliferation or differentiation. One of the major signal transduction pathways results in the activation of a class of intracellular protein serine/threonine kinases termed extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), 1The abbreviations used are: ERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseEGFepidermal growth factorGEFguanidine exchange factorGAPGTPase activating proteinCaMcalmodulinFBSfetal bovine serumTPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetateW12N-(4-aminobutyl)-2-naphthalenesulfonamideW13N-(4-aminobutyl)-5-chloro-2-naphthalenesulfonamidePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisBSAbovine serum albuminPBSphosphate-buffered salinePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideRBDRas-binding domain of Raf-1NRKnormal rat kidney cellsGSTglutathione S-transferaseMEKMAP kinase kinaseSOSson of sevenlessLPAlysophosphatidic acid. also known as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (1Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). Two highly related mammalian ERKs, ERK1 (p44MAPK) and ERK2 (p42MAPK) are activated in response to growth factors and hormones (2Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 3Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Once activated, those kinases are able to phosphorylate and activate numerous cytoplasmic proteins including p90rsk (S6 ribosomal protein kinase) (4Sturgill T.W. Ray L.B. Erikson E. Maller J.L.

ERKs are activated by a dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues. Their specific activators, called MAP kinase kinases (MAPKK) or MEK, constitute a new family of dual-specific threonine/tyrosine kinases (12Crews C.M. Alessandrini A. Erikson R.L. Science. 1992; 258: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). MEK1 and MEK2 are the kinases known to activate ERK1 and ERK2. MEK1 and MEK2 are in turn activated by an upstream MAP kinase kinase kinase, which has been identified as the product of the proto-oncogene raf-1 (13Howe L.R. Leevers S.J. Gomez N. Nakielny S. Cohen P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 335-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Raf-1 seems to integrate different signals that will lead to ERK activation. Its activation is complex and not completely well understood, with Ras activation being an essential element in the pathway. Active Ras targets Raf-1 to the cell membrane and becomes attached to it by an unknown mechanism (14Stokoe D. MacDonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). However, recruitment of Raf to the membrane by binding to Ras cannot account for full activation of Raf (15Mineo C. Anderson R.G. White M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10345-10348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Ras GTPases exist in two conformations, an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound state. The cyclic interconversion of Ras is regulated by the activity of the guanidine exchange factors (GEFs), which allow the replacement of Ras-bound GDP by GTP, and the Ras-GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), which activate the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras that converts GTP back to GDP (16Downward J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Activation of Ras by tyrosine kinase receptors involves recruitment of SOS, a guanidine exchange factor to the membrane (2Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Other GEFs non-activated by tyrosine kinase receptors that activate Ras have been identified in mammalian cells such as Ras-GRF/CDC25Mm (17Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G Feig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Activation of the ERK pathway is transient, and it has been argued that it is the duration of ERKs activation that determines whether a stimulus elicits proliferation or differentiation (18Kahan C. Seuwen K. Meloche S. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13369-13375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Marshall C.J.

A. 1997; 94: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In cells activated to proliferate, Raf is associated to the membrane only for 5 min, and its activity decreases to basal levels 15 min after growth factor addition in cultured fibroblasts (21Watmann M. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6695-6701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ERKs activity after mitogenic stimuli shows a initial peak at 5–10 min followed by a sustained phase of lower activity of 4 h (22Meloche S. Seuwen K. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 845-854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a more prolonged or a high intensity activation of the MAPK pathway induces growth arrest of the cells mediated by the cell cycle inhibitor p21cip1 (20Pumiglia K.M. Decker S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 23Sewing A. Wiseman B. Lloyd A.C. Land H. Mol. Cell.

Whereas much attention has focused on the mechanisms leading to ERK phosphorylation by growth factors and oncoproteins, few studies have turned to the question of how the pathway is down-regulated. Several constitutive and inducible ERK phosphatases responsible for its down-regulation have been described (25Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2608) Google Scholar), including Pyst1 (26Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), MKP1, 2 (27Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K.

Nature. 1994; 367: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Expression of MKP1 has been shown to be ERK- and Ca2+-dependent (30Cook S.J. Beltman J. Cadwallader K.A. McMahon M. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13309-13319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Less is known about the down-regulation of the pathway upstream of ERK. In some cells, ERK mediates the phosphorylation of SOS to terminate Ras-dependent activation of ERK (31Porfiri E. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5871-5877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Ca2+ and calmodulin (CaM) are known to act as second messengers in signal transduction pathways and to regulate cell proliferation (32Schulman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 33Lu K.P. Means A.R. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 40-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 34Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R.

Biochem. 1994; 225: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Through the action of CaM-binding-proteins like CaM-dependent kinases II and IV, calcineurin, hnRNP A2, hnRNP C, and others, they regulate a great variety of cellular processes, such as gene expression, protein translation, and protein phosphorylation (36Agell N. Bachs O. Calcium and Calmodulin Function in the Cell Nucleus. Molecular Biology Inteligence Unit. R. G. Landes Company, Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1995Google Scholar). By using expression vectors capable of inducibly synthesizing CaM sense or antisense mRNAs, it has been shown that progression through G1 and mitosis exit is sensitive to changes in the intracellular concentration of CaM (37Rasmussen C.D. Means A.R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the addition of specific anti-CaM drugs to cell cultures inhibits reentry of growth-arrested cells into the cell cycle (G0/G1 transition), the progression into and through the S phase and the entry and exit from mitosis (35Herget T.

Cell Calcium, 23, 115–121.Google Scholar). Moreover CaM participates in the activation of cdc2 during mitosis entry (33Lu K.P. Means A.R. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 40-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and in its inactivation at the metaphase/anaphase transition (46Lorca T. Cruzalegui F.H. Fesquet D. Cavadore J.C. Méry J. Means A. Dorée M. Nature. 1993; 366: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Despite the evidence indicating that CaM plays a role in cell cycle entry from quiescence (G0/G1 transition), not much is known about the CaM-dependent steps essential for this transition. CaM has been shown to play a role in the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway (47Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A.

For example, the Ras-GRF exchange factor of cortical neurons is a CaM-binding-proteins, and a Ca2+ influx in these cells is able to activate Ras and ERKs (47Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In other cellular types, CaM-dependent kinases have been involved in the MAPK activation pathway (50Enslen H. Tokumitsu H. Stork P.J. Davis R.J. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have analyzed here the involvement of CaM in the ERK signaling pathway in cell-cultured fibroblast. Surprisingly, results show that CaM is not essential for the activation of the ERK pathway but for its inactivation. This down-regulation of the pathway is due at least in part to an inhibitory effect of CaM on Ras activation. Furthermore, activation of ERK2 by CaM inhibition induces an increase in p21cip1 expression together with a cell cycle arrest. NIH 3T3 cells (ATCC) or NIH 3T3 cells constitutively expressing active mutant N-Ras (lys61) under a CMV promoter (NIH 3T3RasLys61) (gift of Dr. T. Thompson, Barcelona) or normal rat kidney cells (NRK) were made quiescent by culturing them in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium with 0.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) during 2 days. 10% FBS, 100 μm TPA, 25 ng/ml EGF, 15 μg/ml W13, 15 μg/ml W12, 5 μm KN93, or 2 μg/ml cyclosporin A were added directly to the media, and for the time indicated in the results. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 2% SDS, and 67 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. The same amount of protein of each extract was electrophoresed in SDS-10% PAGE gels essentially as described by Laemmli (52Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207521) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P strips for 2 h at 60 V. The sheets were preincubated in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), 0.05% Tween-20, and 5% BSA for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 1% BSA, and 0.5% defatted milk powder containing antibodies against: ERK1 and ERK2 (03–6600 Zymed Laboratories Inc., 1:500 dilution), phospho-ERK1 and ERK2 (No. 9101S, New England Biolabs, 1:500 dilution), phospho-MEK (No. 9121S, New England Biolabs, 1:500 dilution), c-Raf-1 (R19120 Transduction Lab., 1:500 dilution), phospho-Tyr (PY20, Transduction Lab., 1:750 dilution). After washing in TBS, 0.05% Tween-20 (three times, 10 min each), the sheets were incubated with either a peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution) (Bio-Rad) or an alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibody (1:10000) (Promega) for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation, the sheets were washed twice in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and once in TBS. The reaction was visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or with BCIP/NBT (Promega). Control of protein loading and transfer was done by stripping the gels and re-blotting them with anti-ERK1 and -ERK2 antibodies. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described by Morrison (53Morrison D.K. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cells (5–10 × 107) were lysed in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm aprotinin, 20 μmleupeptin, and 5 mm sodium vanadate. To immunoprecipitate Raf-1 from cells lysates, 2.5 μg of anti-Raf-1 (R19120, Transduction Lab) or 2.5 μg of a nonrelated monoclonal antibody were first prebound to 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The anti-Raf-coated beads were washed twice with radioimmune precipitation buffer. Then, 500 μg of protein from the lysates were added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated complexes were washed three times with 1 ml of cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA) containing 1 mmPMSF, 1 mm aprotinin, 20 μm leupeptin, and 5 mm sodium vanadate, resuspended, and incubated for 20 min at 25 °C in 40 μl of kinase buffer (30 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.4, 7 mm MnCl2, 5 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 15 μm ATP) plus 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP(3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 40 mg/ml pGST-MEK inactive fusion protein. Then, the samples were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and exposed to x-ray films at −80 °C. Quiescent cells were grown on glass coverslips. To detect ERK1 and ERK2 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min at room temperature and permeabilized at −20 °C for 10 min with methanol. After washing three times with PBS, the nonspecific sites were subsequently blocked with sheep serum in PBS (1:5) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated 1 h at 37 °C, with the specific polyclonal antibodies anti-ERK1 and ERK2 (No. 06–182; Upstate Biotechnology) in 1% BSA/PBS (1:200). Coverslips were then washed three times (5 min each) in PBS and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C with fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (dilution 1:50, Boehringer) in 1% BSA/PBS. After two washes in PBS, coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Mowiol (Calbiochem). The capacity of Ras-GTP to bind to RBD (Ras-binding domain of Raf-1) was used to analyze the amount of active Ras (54McKenzie F.R. Pouysségur J. Anal. Biochem. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar, 55De Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in the culture dish with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1% N-octyl glucoside, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm aprotinin, and 20 μm Leupeptin. Cleared (10,000 × g) lysate (1 mg) was incubated with 30 μg of GST-RBD bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times with the lysis buffer. Bound proteins were solubilized by the addition of 30 μl of Laemmli loading buffer and run on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were then transferred and immunoblotted as described above using pan-Ras monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Sciences OP40, 1:100 dilution). Stimulation of serum-starved NIH 3T3 fibroblast by 10% FBS, or 100 μmTPA for 10 min, resulted in an activation of ERK2, as demonstrated by the increase in ERK2 tyrosine phosphorylation analyzed by Western blotting using antiphosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig.1 A) or phospho-specific anti-ERK1 and -ERK2 antibodies (data not shown). To analyze if CaM was essential for the signaling pathways leading to ERK2 phosphorylation, quiescent cells were pretreated with the anti-CaM drug W13 (15 μg/ml) for 20 min prior to stimulation with FBS or TPA. W13 has been extensively used to inhibit CaM in cell cultures, and it is known to be highly specific at the doses used in this work (40Chafouleas J.G. Bolton W.E. Hidaka H. Boyd A.E. Means A.R. Cell. 1982; 28: 41-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 42Hidaka H. Sasaki Y. Tanaka T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4354-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 56López-Girona A. Bosch M. Bachs O. Agell N. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 30-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 57López-Girona A. Bachs O. Agell N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 566-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). W12 was used as a control because it is a compound chemically similar to W13 but with a much lower affinity for CaM (40Chafouleas J.G. Bolton W.E. Hidaka H. Boyd A.E. Means A.R. Cell. 1982; 28: 41-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, W13-pretreatment did not have any effect on the level of phosphorylated ERK2, determined by Western blotting using antiphosphotyrosine (PY20) antibody (Fig. 1 A). The same results were obtained using the antiphospho-ERK2 specific antibodies (data not shown). ERK2 phosphorylation was also induced at 0.5% FBS by expression of activated N-Ras. Inhibition of CaM in NIH 3T3NRas(Lys61)-transformed cells by W13 treatment for 30 min did not have any effect on Ras-induced ERK2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B). Thus, CaM is not essential for any of the studied signaling pathways leading to ERK2 activation in NIH 3T3. Because the duration of ERKs activation is also important for cell response, the effect of CaM inhibition on the timing of ERKs phosphorylation was analyzed. In nontreated cells (data not shown) or in cells preincubated with W12 (for 20 min prior to 10% FBS addition) (Fig.2), ERK2 phosphorylation was high at 10 min, started to decrease at 30 min, and was slightly higher than in unstimulated cells by 2 h after FBS addition. Surprisingly, when cells where preincubated with W13, ERK2 phosphorylation still remained high 2 h after the stimulation (Fig. 2). Inhibition of CaM later in G1 (between 4 and 10 h after serum addition), when ERK2 phosphorylation was already decreased, did not lead to a second activation of ERK2 (data not shown). Thus, inhibition of CaM prolonged the phosphorylation of ERK2, suggesting that CaM is involved in its down-regulation. The effect of W13 on ERK2 phosphorylation in serum-starved cells was also analyzed. When serum-starved cells (0.5% FBS) were incubated with W13 for 30 min, an increase in ERK2 phosphorylation was observed. This increase was similar to that produced by addition of 10% FBS and was not observed with W12 (Fig.3 A). This effect was not mediated by CaM-dependent kinase II or calcineurin because treatment of serum-starved cells with KN93, an inhibitor of CaM-dependent-kinase II, or cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of calcineurin, did not induce ERK2 phosphorylation (Fig.3 A). Cooperation between FBS addition and CaM inhibition to induce ERK2 phosphorylation was analyzed in quiescent cells that had been maintained for the last 10 h in the complete absence of FBS. Cells were pre-treated with W12 or W13 for 20 min, and ERK2 phosphorylation was studied 10 min after addition of increasing amounts of FBS. As shown in Fig. 3 B, W13 addition synergized with low concentrations of FBS to induce ERK2 phosphorylation. Maximal increase in ERK2 phosphorylation induced by CaM inhibition was observed at 0.5% FBS. In agreement with the results in Fig. 1 A, when the amount of FBS added to the media was higher than 2%, no additional increase in ERK2 phosphorylation was induced by CaM inhibition (Fig.3 B). Similar results were obtained using NRK cells (data not shown). These results suggest that CaM inhibits any of the signaling pathways by which FBS activates ERK2. We also analyzed whether ERK2 phosphorylation induced by CaM inhibition in serum-starved cells correlated with a nuclear accumulation of ERKs. As shown in Fig. 4, after 2 days of serum starvation, ERK2 was localized in the cytoplasm. Treatment with W13 for 30 min induced a translocation of ERK2 into the nucleus similar to what occurred with 10% FBS incubation. W13 treatment of serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells also induced an increase in fos mRNA levels analyzed by Northern blotting (data not shown). The only kinases known to phosphorylate and activate ERK2 are MEK1 and MEK2. Thus, we analyzed whether these kinases were involved in ERK phosphorylation induced by CaM inhibition. As shown in Fig. 5 A, ERK2 phosphorylation induced by W13 addition to serum-starved cells was not observed when cells were previously treated with the specific inhibitor of MEK, PD98059 (Calbiochem). Furthermore, W13 addition to serum-starved cells induced an increase in MEK phosphorylation as determined by Western blotting using phospho-MEK-specific antibodies (Fig.5 B). These results indicate that W13 induces ERK2 phosphorylation by MEK and that CaM inhibits the activation of MEK at low serum concentration. Next, the effect of CaM inhibition on Raf-1, the main kinase involved in MEK1 and MEK2 activation, was analyzed. W13 addition to serum-starved cells induced an increase in Raf-1 activity as determined by immunoprecipitation followed by kinase assay using inactive MEK-GST as substrate, compared with W12-treated cells and quiescent cells (Fig.6 A). CaM inhibition induced also a gel-mobility shift of Raf-1, similar to that induced by FBS (Fig. 6 B) that has been related with its phosphorylation and activation. Although Raf activation is not very well understood, the increase in Ras-GTP seems to be an essential event for Raf activation. Thus, the levels of Ras-GTP upon W13 treatment of serum-starved cells were analyzed. As shown in Fig.7 A, CaM inhibition induced an increase in the levels of Ras-GTP that was not observed in W12-treated cells. The levels of Ras-GTP after W13 treatment were as high as those reached upon 10% FBS addition. A mechanism for Ras activation is activation of tyrosine kinase receptors involving autophosphorylation of these receptors and the recruitment of SOS to the plasma membrane through the interaction with the adapter protein GRB2. After 10 min of 10% FBS addition to serum-starved cells, tyrosine phosphorylation was increased in the area of the gel where the EGF re"

This model induced cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Controls (C) were prepared (n = 14). Compared to C, peak tension in CHF fell by 57% in twitch and by 40% in tetanus; Vmax declined by 47% in twitch and by 48% in tetanus. Our study provided an analytical means of calculating from A. F. Huxley's equations the rate constants for CB attachment and detachment, CB single force (Π), CB number per mm3 (m′), peak mechanical efficiency (Effmax), and turnover rate of myosin ATPase (kcat); m′, Π, and Effmax were lower in CHF than in C in both twitch and tetanus. The marked decline in m′ and Π accounted for the fall in diaphragm strength. In the overall population of C and CHF, Effmax was linearly related to Π. Conversely, there was no relationship between Vmax and kcat. Dissociation between Vmax and kcat might be explained by the crucial role attributed to two apparently nonconserved surface ‘loops’ on the motor domain of myosin head.—Lecarpentier, Y., Chemla, D., Blanc, F.

https://openalex.org/W1969460672,"We have recently shown that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, is cleaved in isolated membrane fractions enriched for endoplasmic reticulum. Importantly, the cleavage rate is accelerated when the membranes are prepared from cells that have been pretreated with mevalonate or sterols, physiological regulators of the degradation process in vivo (McGee, T. P., Cheng, H. H., Kumagai, H., Omura, S., and Simoni, R. D. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 25630-25638). In the current study, we further characterize this in vitro cleavage of HMG-CoA reductase. E64, a specific inhibitor of cysteine-proteases, inhibits HMG-CoA reductase cleavage in vitro. In contrast, lactacystin, an inhibitor of the proteasome, inhibits HMG-CoA reductase degradation in vivo but does not inhibit the in vitro cleavage. Purified ER fractions contain lactacystin-sensitive and E64-insensitive proteasome activity as measured by succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin hydrolysis. We removed the proteasome from purified ER fractions by solubilization with heptylthioglucoside and observed that the detergent extracted, proteasome-depleted membrane fractions retain regulated cleavage of HMG-CoA reductase. This indicates that ER-associated proteasome is not involved in degradation of HMG-CoA reductase in vitro. In order to determine the site(s) of proteolysis of HMG-CoA reductase in vitro, four antisera were prepared against peptide sequences representing various domains of HMG-CoA reductase and used for detection of proteolytic intermediates. The sizes and antibody reactivity of the intermediates suggest that HMG-CoA reductase is cleaved in the in vitro degradation system near the span 8 membrane region, which links the N-terminal membrane domain to the C-terminal catalytic domain of the protein. We conclude that HMG-CoA reductase can be cleaved in the membrane-span 8 region by a cysteine protease(s) tightly associated with ER membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1950292101,"Wound reepithelialization and keratinocyte migration require strictly ordered gene expression, which is assumed to be initiated by locally released mitogens and exposure of the cells to different matrix components. The mechanisms triggering gene expression specifically during reepithelialization are poorly understood. The far upstream AP-1-driven, FGF-inducible response element (FiRE) of the syndecan-1 gene was activated during cutaneous wound healing in transgenic mice. FiRE was induced selectively in migrating but not in proliferating keratinocytes at the wound edge. The activation was initiated at the start of the cell migration, was persistent throughout the merging and stratification phases, and was terminated after completion of reepithelialization. Although FiRE has been found within the gene of syndecan-1, the proximal promoter of syndecan-1 was not required for activation of FiRE in the migrating keratinocytes. The wounding induced activation was inhibited by blocking cell surface growth factor receptors with suramin. However, the activation of FiRE in resting skin required simultaneous growth factor- and stress-induced signals, but could also be elicited by the phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid. The activation by both wounding and chemical stimuli was blocked by inhibiting extracellular regulated kinase and p38 MAP kinases, suggesting the involvement of at least two parallel signal transduction pathways in wounding induced gene activation. As FiRE shows specificity for migrating keratinocytes only, it can be a useful tool for future wound healing studies and for targeting genes to injured tissues."

It has been previously shown that the catalytically competent tyrosyl free radical of its small R2 subunit (R2-Y⋅) is scavenged in tumor cells co-cultured with macrophages expressing a nitric oxide synthase II activity.

So called “neuronal” NOS (NOS I) and “endothelial” NOS (NOS III), usually constitutively expressed, are transiently activated by elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration (4Macmicking J. Xie Q.W. Nathan C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3458) Google Scholar). A cytokine-inducible NOS (NOS II) is transcriptionally regulated, producing ⋅NO at basal Ca2+ levels for up to several days (4Macmicking J. Xie Q.W. Nathan C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3458) Google Scholar). Among cytotoxic and pathophysiological functions, NOS II was rapidly recognized to support a nonspecific antiproliferative activity capable of limiting the growth of invading agents, including viruses, bacteria, parasites, and tumor cells, consistent with the wide distribution of the isoform in different cell types (3Schmidt H.H.H.W.

Previous studies also indicated that RR inhibition supported an early, NOS-dependent inhibition of DNA synthesis in tumor cells (11Kwon N.S. Stuehr D.J. Nathan C.F. J. Exp.

Production of R2-Y⋅ by a one-electron oxidation of Y122 (E. coli) or Y177 (mouse), and stability of the existing radical are dependent on a proximal nonheme diiron center which interacts electromagnetically with R2-Y⋅ (21Sahlin M. Petersson L. Gräslund A. Ehrenberg A. Sjöberg B.-M. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5541-5548Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The radical/metal center of protein R2 is required for activity, since it triggers a radical-driven reduction of the substrate through a long-range electron transfer between protein R2 and protein R1, the other homodimeric subunit of RR containing binding sites for substrates and allosteric effectors (see Refs. 19Nordlund P. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 123-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar and 20Kauppi B. Nielsen B.A. Ramaswamy S. Larsen I.K. Thelander M. Thelander L. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 706-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, and references therein). In different models, R2-Y⋅ has been identified as a target for nitrogen oxides derived from NOS II activity (12Lepoivre M. Flaman J.-M. Bobe P. Lemaire G. Henry Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 22994-23000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the chemical species involved have not been clearly identified. There is good evidence that⋅NO participates in the reaction since HbO2, which binds ⋅NO, inhibits R2-Y⋅ quenching induced by NOS II activity or ⋅NO donors (22Lepoivre M. Flaman J.-M. Henry Y. J.

Also, a reversible radical-radical coupling reaction of ⋅NO with R2-Y⋅ has been proposed to account for the disappearance of the tyrosyl free radical of E. coli protein R2 induced by thionitrites (24Roy B. Lepoivre M. Henry Y. Fontecave M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5411-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, so far, this experiment has not been reproduced with authentic⋅NO gas under anaerobic conditions, to demonstrate unambiguously the role of ⋅NO in R2-Y⋅ scavenging. Moreover, little is known about the reactivity of other nitrogen oxides toward RR. In the present study, we compared the effects of ⋅NO and ONOO− against murine protein R2 in vitro. We then used these data in order to identify the nitrogen oxide responsible for R2-Y⋅ quenching in co-cultures of macrophages and tumor cells. Our results indicate that ONOO− is not a physiological effector of the loss of R2-Y⋅. ⋅NO gas was purchased from Air Liquide (Moissy-Cramayel, France). Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was from Eurogentec (Angers, France). [5-3H]CDP with a specific activity of 655 GBq/mmol was purchased from Amersham-France (Les Ulis). All other reagents were from Sigma (L'isle d'Abeau Chesnes, France). Plasmids pETM2 (25Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Ochiai E.-I. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and pVNR2 (26Gerez C. Elleingand E. Kauppi B. Eklund H. Fontecave M. Eur. J.

Fontecave (Université Joseph Fourier, Grenoble, France), respectively. Bacterial protein R2 was prepared from an E. coli K12 strain expressing the pVNR2 plasmid, using a purification procedure already published (27Sjöberg B.-M. Hahne S. Karlsson M. Jörnvall H. Göransson M. Uhlin B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5658-5662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant mouse R2 protein was prepared as described previously (25Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Ochiai E.-I. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. The mouse protein R2 expression vector pETM2 was transfected by electroporation into theE. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (CamR) strain. The resulting strain was named M2pLysS. For each preparation, 3 liters of LB medium supplemented with carbenicillin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (27 μg/ml) were infected by an overnight culture (1/100 dilution), and shaken at 200 rpm at 37 °C. When absorbance at 590 nm was between 0.4 and 0.6, expression of mouse protein R2 was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactosidase, 0.5 mm. After 4 h, cultures were chilled on ice and centrifuged at 2500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, then resuspended in 30 ml of a 50 mm Tris·HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 1 mm EDTA. The resulting suspension was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Recombinant mouse protein R1 was overexpressed in a baculovirus system and purified by affinity chromatography as described in Ref. 28Salem J.S. Scott C.P. Li L.-S. Cooperman S. Rubin H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 93-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar. Presence of the pLysS plasmid, encoding the T7 lysozyme, allowed spontaneous lysis of M2pLysS bacteria during thawing. Purification of apoR2 was performed as described in Ref. 25Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Ochiai E.-I. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar. The purity of the material was checked by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Reconstitution of the diferric center and regeneration of the tyrosyl radical was done using an anaerobic procedure already described (25Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Ochiai E.-I. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The average radical content per monomer was measured by EPR spectroscopy. Alternatively, the concentration of R2-Y⋅ was determined from the difference in absorbance at 417 nm between active protein R2 and metR2 (Δε = 3256m−1·cm−1). Iron content was evaluated by prolonged incubation of protein R2 with hydroxyurea (4 mm), which reduces and releases iron from the protein. Released iron was quantified by desferrioxamine (Δε = 2500m−1·cm−1 at 430 nm, see below). Active R2 protein contained 0.65 ± 0.06 radical and 2.0 ± 0.08 iron atoms per monomer (mean ± S.E.,n = 4). Protein metR2 was prepared by treatment of native protein R2 at ambient temperature with 4-propoxyphenol in stoichiometric equivalent versus the radical concentration. ⋅NO gas was allowed to bubble gently through 1 m NaOH before passing into an argon-deoxygenated Tris·HCl buffer, 50 mm, pH 7.6, for 1 h. Nitric oxide concentration in the buffered solution was measured by the oxidation of 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid, 25 mg/ml, using Δε = 15,000 m−1cm−1 at 750 nm (29Wink D.A. Nims R.W. Darbyshire J.F. Christodoulou D. Hanbauer I. Cox G.W. Laval F. Laval J. Cook J.A. Krishna M.C. Degraff W.G. Mitchell J.B. Chem. Res.

Pharmacol. 1987; 139: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, with similar results. Peroxynitrite was synthesized from nitrite and hydrogen peroxide in an acidic medium, rapidly quenched in NaOH, as described previously (31Crow J. Beckman J.S. McCord J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The solution was frozen at −20 °C and peroxynitrite concentrated in the upper layer was collected. Its concentration was measured at 302 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 1670m−1 cm−1 (31Crow J. Beckman J.S. McCord J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). A reactivated sample of murine protein R2 was deaerated with an argon flux for 1 h at 0 °C, in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.6. Aliquots were transferred anaerobically into 1.5-ml microtubes kept in ice. Increasing volumes of a ⋅NO-saturated solution were added to a microtube series. After vortexing, 200 μl of each sample was transferred immediately and anaerobically into EPR quartz tubes and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Twenty microliters were used for the RR activity assay. The 250-μl aliquot remaining in each microtube was degassed for 45 min at 0 °C to eliminate ⋅NO, then processed as described above for analysis of R2-Y⋅. Peroxynitrite was added to protein R2 in 50 mm Tris·HCl buffer, pH 7.6, under aerobic conditions. The concentration of R2-Y⋅ was immediately measured by EPR spectroscopy and R2 activity was evaluated from a 20-μl aliquot, as described above. The pH of the buffer was not modified after addition of ONOO−, up to at least 400 μm. In reverse order experiments, peroxynitrite was allowed to decompose first in Tris·HCl buffer before addition of the protein. Solutions of protein R2 or L1210-R2 cell pellets were analyzed for R2-Y⋅ content at 77 K using a Varian E109 spectrometer, calibrated with the radical 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl exhibiting an EPR signal centered at g = 2.0036, which was also used after double integration to quantify the tyrosyl free radical concentration in untreated, ⋅NO- or peroxynitrite-treated R2 protein samples. The amplitude of the trough at g = 1.994 was used to quantitate R2-Y⋅ in cell samples, due to the presence of a partially overlapping strong signal from nitrosyl iron complexes at g values of 2.041 and 2.015. Microwave power was 10 mW, field modulation frequency was 9.18 GHz, and modulation amplitude was 1 millitesla. RR activity was assayed following the conversion of [3H]CDP into [3H]dCDP. Magnesium chloride (15 mm), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mmATP, 200 μm CDP, 74 kBq of [5-3H]CDP, and a 5-fold molar excess of protein R1 in 50 mm Tris·HCl buffer, pH 7.6, were mixed with 20 μl of protein R2 (0.5–2 μm) in a final volume of 90 μl. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Control experiments have shown that the reaction was linear over the 10-min assay. The reaction was stopped by heating for 2 min. CDP and dCDP were then dephosphorylated for 2 h at 37 °C using 200 μg/ml rattlesnake venom from Crotalus adamanteus. After boiling and centrifugation, supernatants were analyzed by radio-high performance liquid chromatography as described elsewhere (13Lepoivre M. Chenais B. Yapo A. Lemaire G. Thelander L. Tenu J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14143-14149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific activity was expressed as nanomoles of dCDP formed per minute per mg of protein R2. A volume of 500 μl of 20 μm protein R2 was deoxygenated with argon at room temperature in a quartz cuvette closed with a rubber septum. After 1 h, a UV visible absorption spectrum of the protein was recorded. Concentration of the R2-Y⋅ radical was determined from the absorbance at 417 nm (see above). ⋅NO or 4-propoxyphenol (used to obtain metR2) were introduced with an argon-degassed syringe, in a ratio [⋅NO]:[R2-Y⋅] of 8 or [4-propoxyphenol]:[R2-Y⋅] of 1. Then, 10 μl of a deoxygenated solution of desferrioxamine were added to a final concentration of 1 mm to monitor ferric iron release by the Fe3+-desferrioxamine complex absorbance at 430 nm (Δε = 2500 m−1·cm−1), as previously reported (32Nyholm S. Thelander L. Gräslund A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11569-11574Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In these experiments, the free radical content of untreated control protein R2 decreased from 0.65 to approximately 0.5 radical per monomer after the 1-h flush with argon. Peritoneal macrophages elicited by intraperitoneal injection of 50 μg of trehalose dimycolate to (C57BL/6xDBA/2)F1 mice were obtained as described (33Lepoivre M. Tenu J.-P. Lemaire G. Petit J.-F. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 860-866PubMed Google Scholar, 34Grand-Perret T. Lepoivre M. Petit J.-F. Lemaire G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1986; 16: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The R2-overexpressing L1210-R2 cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, as described previously (12Lepoivre M. Flaman J.-M. Bobe P. Lemaire G. Henry Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21891-21897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophages (35 × 106) were allowed to adhere for 3 h in 14-cm culture dishes (Nunclon), then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Lipopolysaccharide was added at 100 ng/ml in 20 ml of fresh culture medium to induce expression of NOS II activity. After 4 h, macrophages were washed again with phosphate-buffered saline and L1210-R2 cells in exponential growth phase were added in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, at a macrophage:tumor cell ratio of 0.55. Cells were co-cultured for 5 h, with lipopolysaccharide. In some experiments, TPA (2 nm) was added with tumor target cells to trigger O⨪2 and H2O2 production by macrophage NADPH oxidase activity (33Lepoivre M. Tenu J.-P. Lemaire G. Petit J.-F. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 860-866PubMed Google Scholar). Nonadherent L1210-R2 cells were then gently harvested and packed by centrifugation into an EPR quartz tube (4 mm outer diameter), as previously mentioned (12Lepoivre M. Flaman J.-M. Bobe P. Lemaire G. Henry Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21891-21897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A first determination of R2-Y⋅ concentration in the cell pellet was obtained. Cells were then thawed and R2-Y⋅ was reactivated with a solution of 100 mm dithiothreitol and 100 μm ammonium iron(II) sulfate added in a small volume, representing approximately 1/10 of the cell pellet, according to Ref.35Nyholm S. Mann G.J. Johansson A.G. Bergeron R.J. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26200-26205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Cells were mixed with a glass rod, air bubbles were introduced with a syringe, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were then centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min and the reactivation procedure was repeated once, except that iron and the reductant were not added. Finally, cells were frozen for a second determination of R2-Y⋅ content. In preliminary experiments, this procedure was shown to allow optimal regeneration of R2-Y⋅. Protein R2 from E. coli treated with various concentrations of peroxynitrite was first desalted on a Bio-Gel polyacrylamide column (Bio-Rad). The protein was then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by dot-blotting. Detection of catechol structures was performed according to Ref. 36Paz M.A. Fluckiger R. Boak A. Kagan H.M. Gallop P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 689-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The membrane was immersed in a 2m potassium glycinate solution, pH 10, containing 0.24 mm nitro blue tetrazolium, and incubated in the dark for 45 min. Membranes were irreversibly stained by immersion at 4 °C in 0.1m sodium borate, pH 7.0. Mouse or E. coli protein R2 treated with ⋅NO or ONOO was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by dot blotting. The membrane was then blocked for 1 h with 3% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline. A mouse monoclonal antinitrotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnologies, Lake Placid, NY) was added at a dilution of 1:2000, and the membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C in the blocking buffer. After three washings, a secondary goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody was added at a 1:5000 dilution and incubated with the membrane for 90 min in the blocking buffer, at room temperature. Blots were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence using a kit from Amersham. Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Bovine serum albumin was taken as a reference. Nitrite concentration in the co-culture medium of macrophages and L1210-R2 tumor cells was measured with the Griess reagent, as described previously (22Lepoivre M. Flaman J.-M. Henry Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22994-23000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Citrulline production from l-[U-14C]arginine was measured over 5 h in macrophage cultures (1 × 106/ml/well), as reported elsewhere (13Lepoivre M. Chenais B. Yapo A. Lemaire G. Thelander L. Tenu J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14143-14149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophages were cultivated in 24-well culture plates (1 × 106/well), washed, activated with lipopolysaccharide for 4 h, and stimulated with TPA, as described above. Hydrogen peroxide production was measured in 500 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution by the peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of phenol red (34Grand-Perret T. Lepoivre M. Petit J.-F. Lemaire G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1986; 16: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite synthesis was estimated from the superoxide dismutase- and aminoguanidine-inhibitable oxidation of DHR (31Crow J. Beckman J.S. McCord J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), in 500 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 culture medium without phenol red. Two hours after TPA addition, production of rhodamine was measured at 500 nm (Δε = 74,500 m−1· cm−1). Previous studies have shown that the free radical of the small R2 subunit of RR was scavenged by chemical ⋅NO donors in the presence of oxygen, allowing ⋅NO autoxidation to higher nitrogen oxides. The present experiments were conducted under anaerobic conditions to study the effect of authentic ⋅NO gas. Other experiments with peroxynitrite were performed in the presence of oxygen, since identical results on R2-Y⋅ were obtained with or without oxygen in preliminary studies. The tyrosyl free radical of mouse protein R2 was quenched similarly by ⋅NO and by peroxynitrite (Fig.1). The EPR spectrum of partially quenched R2-Y⋅ recorded at 77 K in the presence of either nitrogen oxide did not reveal any modification of the radical profile, except its reduced amplitude. The disappearance of R2-Y⋅ induced by ⋅NO was concentration-dependent for both⋅NO (Fig. 2) and protein R2 (not shown). The apparent stoichiometry of the reaction was clearly higher than 1:1. For instance, complete loss of the R2-Y⋅ EPR signal occurred at a ratio [⋅NO]:[R2-Y⋅] estimated to be 8.5 ± 1.0, from three independent experiments. The reaction was fast, going to completion within the time required to mixture R2 with⋅NO and to transfer the solution into EPR tubes (about 30 s). The reaction was also reversible. If ⋅NO was purged from the solution with argon, R2-Y⋅ reappeared in samples kept carefully at 0 °C to minimize iron loss (see below). With an 8-fold excess of⋅NO, the recovery was nearly complete and reproducible (81.6 ± 6.0% of control, n = 3). The EPR profile of the recovered radical was identical to a native R2 control (not shown). Fig. 2 also shows that activity of protein R2 was not significantly reduced by ⋅NO. This result was unexpected, since the tyrosyl free radical quenched by ⋅NO is required for R2 activity. We therefore suspected that conditions used for assaying R2 activity (10 mm DTT, O2, and a 4.5-fold dilution of the sample) might have promoted the regeneration of R2-Y⋅. In fact, we observed in one control experiment that, after it had been totally quenched by ⋅NO, R2-Y⋅reappeared by 60% within 1 min under RR assay conditions.Figure 2Effect of ⋅NO on free radical content and activity of mouse protein R2. Protein R2 (0.8 μm) was added with increasing amounts of ⋅NO under anaerobic conditions in 50 mm Tris·HCl buffer, pH 7.6, and immediately tested for free radical content by EPR spectroscopy (filled squares). An aliquot of the solution was used to measure R2 activity in the presence of a 5-fold molar excess of protein R1, under aerobic conditions (filled circles), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The remaining volume of the sample was gassed with argon for 45 min in ice, before measurement of tyrosyl free radical recovery (open squares).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Loss of R2-Y⋅ might have been a consequence of a direct effect of ⋅NO on the tyrosyl free radical, but might also have reflected the destruction of the iron center, which would have causedipso facto the destruction of the free radical. To investigate this possibility, iron release from protein R2 was monitored spectroscopically in the presence of desferrioxamine, chelating ferric but not ferrous iron in the absence of oxygen (32Nyholm S. Thelander L. Gräslund A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11569-11574Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The iron center of mouse protein R2 exhibits a temperature-dependent instability. A slow but significant loss of ferric iron from the native protein incubated under anaerobiosis was thus observed, at room temperature (Fig.3). Introduction of ⋅NO into the cuvette at a concentration sufficient to completely quench R2-Y⋅increased the rate of iron release by 3-fold. However,⋅NO-induced iron release was still slow when compared with the nearly instantaneous scavenging of R2-Y⋅ (Fig. 2). This observation raised the possibility that increased iron releas"

In this study, we report that γc is internalized and degraded in lymphoid cells. To identify γc regions involved in sorting along the endocytic pathway, we have studied a chimeric protein composed of the extracellular part of interleukin 2-receptor α and transmembrane and intracellular part of γc, αγγwt. When transfected in Jurkat T cells, αγγwt is as efficiently internalized and degraded as γc, demonstrating that the transmembrane and cytosolic tail of γc carry sequences involved in this process. To identify these motifs, we have analyzed the trafficking of chimeric proteins with serial truncations in their cytosolic tail. Internalization studies showed that the cytosolic tail of γc contains three regions located between cytosolic amino acids 1–35, 35–40, and 40–65 involved in γc endocytosis. Successive deletions of these motifs result in reduced endocytosis. One region containing the 5 cytosolic amino acids 36–40 is essential to direct γc to the degradation pathway. These sorting sequences, by participating in the fine tuning of cell surface γcexpression, might somewhat regulate the cell responsiveness to interleukins whose receptors share this component.

Communication between cells in the immune and hematopoietic systems is mediated by soluble factors, cytokines, which exert their biological activities through specific cell surface receptors. The molecular structure of a growing number of cytokine receptors has been determined and led to the definition of a new family of receptors (1D'Andrea A.D. Fasman G.D. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1989; 58: 1023-1024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar,2Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar). The hematopoietic cytokine receptor superfamily is defined by structural homology in the extracellular, ligand binding domain and limited similarity in the membrane proximal cytosolic regions (3Murakami M. Narazaki M. Hibi M. Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Hamaguchi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11349-11353Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). This family of receptors includes receptors to many interleukins (IL), 1The abbreviations used are: ILinterleukinILRinterleukin receptorPBSphosphate-buffered salinePCRpolymerase chain reactionmAb(s)monoclonal antibody(ies)FITCfluorescein isothiocyanate.1The abbreviations used are: ILinterleukinILRinterleukin receptorPBSphosphate-buffered salinePCRpolymerase chain reactionmAb(s)monoclonal antibody(ies)FITCfluorescein isothiocyanate. such as IL2, IL3, IL4, IL5, IL6, IL7, IL9, IL12, and IL15, receptors for hormones such as growth hormone and prolactin, and receptors for growth factors. Another characteristic of this family is that many receptors subfamily members share at least one component, explaining in part the redundant action of different cytokines. One member of this family of receptors was named the common γ chain (γc): first described as the third component of the IL2 receptor (IL2R), it participates in the formation of high-affinity forms of IL2, IL4, IL7, IL9, and IL15 receptors (4Noguchi M.

Because it is shared by these interleukin receptors, γc has a critical role in lymphocyte differentiation and proliferation. Indeed, patients suffering from X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency have mutations in the gene encoding γc (10Noguchi M. Yi H. Rosenblatt H.M. Filipovich A.H. Adelstein S. Modi W.S.

Immunol. 1994; 24: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).One of the early events that follows ligand binding to receptors on the cell surface is the internalization of the ligand-receptor complex. After internalization from the plasma membrane in early endosomes, receptors can either recycle to the cell surface or be degraded within intracellular compartments. Endocytosis and degradation are essential for the rapid down-modulation of surface receptors after ligand binding. Down-modulation results in a decrease in the number of receptors on the cell surface and, together with biosynthesis, controls the cell responsiveness. For several receptors, internalization is driven by the presence of specific sequences in their cytosolic part, recognized by the cellular machinery. These internalization signals have been classified into two groups, one is characterized by a tyrosine-based motif and the other by a di-leucine-based motif (12Sandoval I.V. Bakke O. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 292-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar,13Marks M.S. Ohno H. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). They allow the recruitment of receptors into clathrin-coated pits and promote high-efficiency endocytosis. Whereas the molecular mechanisms that direct internalization from the plasma membrane to early endosomes are well documented for receptors, much less information is available concerning the sorting from early endosomes to the other intracellular compartments. For receptors to exit from the recycling pathway and to move to other intracellular destinations (e.g. in most cases toward the late endosomes and lysosomes) or to new domains on the cell surface (as in transcytosis) requires selective routing and depends upon the possession of additional, specific sorting signals. Indeed, tyrosine or di-leucine families of signals described for clathrin-coated pit endocytosis are also involved in lysosomal targeting of lysosomal membrane glycoproteins (reviewed in Ref. 12Sandoval I.V. Bakke O. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 292-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Sequences necessary for the degradation of nonlysosomal membrane proteins have been reported for two proteins, the P-selectin and the IL2Rβ chain (14Green S.A. Setiadi H. McEver R.P. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 435-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 15Subtil A. Delepierre M. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In both cases a short sequence is sufficient for degradation after endocytosis. These two degradation signals are different and do not match the trafficking signals described so far.The γc chain is a part of IL2R, IL4R, IL7R, IL9R, and IL15R. Its role in endocytosis of these cytokines and their receptors is not known. We have previously shown that γc is internalized and degraded when part of the IL2·IL2R complex (16Hémar A. Subtil A. Lieb M. Morelon E. Hellio R. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and that the cytosolic part of γc is involved in IL2 endocytosis and in the down-regulation of the IL2Rβ chain (17Morelon E. Dautry-Varsat A. Le Deist F. Hacein-Bay S. Fischer A. de Saint Basile G. Blood. 1996; 88: 1708-1717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that γc may carry the necessary information for endocytosis and degradation. In the present study we show that the cytosolic tail of γc contains sequences involved in receptor endocytosis and degradation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells, Monoclonal Antibodies, and ReagentsYT 12881, a subclone from the NK cell line YT, was obtained from Dr. K. Smith (Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH). The Jurkat 77.31.13 T cell line was a kind gift of Dr. A. Alcover (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) and will be referred to as J77 cells from now on (18Alcover A. Alberini C. Acuto O. Clayton L.K. Transy C. Spagnoli G.C. Moingeon P. Lopez P. Reinherz E.L. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1973-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). All cells were grown in suspension in RPMI 1640, 10% decomplemented fetal calf serum, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine. Stably transfected Jurkat cells were grown in the same medium supplemented with 400 μg/ml hygromycin (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany). Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) 2A3A1H (mouse IgG1) or 7G7B6 (mouse IgG2a), directed against the α chain of the IL2 receptor, were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). TUGh4 (rat IgG2b), directed against the γ chain of the IL2 receptor, was obtained from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Monoclonal antibodies FG 1/6 (mouse IgG1), directed against the human transferrin receptor, were a kind gift from Dr. B. Alarcon (Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, Madrid, Spain). The second antibodies used with mAb TUGh4 were FITC-conjugated anti-rat IgG antibodies (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL), with 2A3A1H F(ab)′2phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Immunotech, Marseilles, France) and with 7G7B6 F(ab)′2 FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Cycloheximide and saponin were obtained from Sigma.PlasmidsThe constructs were subcloned in the NT expression vector, containing the SRα promoter, a kind gift of Dr. C. Bonnerot (Institut Curie, Paris, France). The plasmid pRCHγ, coding for the γc chain, and the plasmid pREP4, were kindly provided by Dr. J. Di Santo (Hôpital Necker, Paris, France). The plasmid T-XO, coding for the IL2Rα chain, has already been described (15Subtil A. Delepierre M. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The plasmid pME18Sα/γ/γ was kindly provided by Dr. W. Leonard (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md).pREPα was constructed by subcloning IL2Rα from TXO into theKpnI/NotI site of the plasmid pREP4. It contains a BglII restriction enzyme site just upstream the transmembrane part of IL2Rα. The transmembrane and cytosolic regions of human γc were derived by polymerase chain reactions (PCR) using pRCHγ and primers with terminal BglII andXhoI restriction enzyme sites. pREPαγγwtwas obtained by ligating the transmembrane and cytosolic regions of γc to the pREPα digested with BglII andXhoI.The truncated forms of αγγn were generated by PCR by insertion of a stop codon after the n th amino acid of the cytosolic part of the protein (assuming that Glutamine is the first cytosolic amino acid) and were cloned into theNotI/XbaI sites of NT by standard techniques. They were used for stable transfections in J77 cells. The plasmid TXOγ25–65 and TXOγ35–65 were constructed by inserting amino acids 25–65 or 35–65 from the cytosolic tail of γc derived by PCR into the HindIII/XBaI cloning cassette, localized at the 3′ end of IL2Rα cDNA (15Subtil A. Delepierre M. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These plasmids were stably transfected in J77 cells. Sequences were confirmed whenever synthetic oligonucleotides or PCR were involved.Cell TransfectionAll endocytosis and half-life analyses described here have been performed in stably transfected J77 cells. To generate stable transfectants, 20 × 106 J77 cells were washed once in culture medium and resuspended in 800 μl of the same medium, with 20 μg of the plasmid of interest. Electroporation was performed using the Easyject electroporator (Eurogentec, Serain, Belgium) with a simple pulse, 260 V, 900 microfarads. Selection with 400 μg/ml hygromycin was initiated 2 days after transfection, and the cells were cloned in 96-well dishes. Hygromycin-resistant clones were assayed for expression by flow cytometry using anti-α (2A3A1H) antibodies. The expression levels of recombinant proteins in all clones tested were the same or less than their normal level in activated lymphocytes. J77 cells stably transfected with the αγγn construct will be called J77αγγn from now on.Endocytosis of AntibodiesEndocytosis of antibodies directed against the chimeric molecules was quantitated by flow cytometry essentially as described previously (19Marks M.S. Woodruff L. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 105J77αγγn cells were incubated at 4 °C for 60 min with the anti-IL2Rα 2A3A1H mAb (1/2000 ascitic fluid). The cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C, and after incubation at 37 °C for the indicated times, the cells were rapidly cooled to 4 °C and washed twice in PBS, 2% fetal calf serum. The cells were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with the IgF(ab)′2 phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-IgG secondary antibody, washed once at 4 °C, and the level of expression of the constructs on the cell surface was assessed by flow cytometry on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) immediately after labeling. Base line cell fluorescence intensity was determined with cells incubated only with the secondary antibody. For each time pointt, the percentage of internalized antibodies was calculated as follows: 100 × (1 − fluorescence intensity at time t/fluorescence intensity at time 0). All experiments were performed at least four times.Cell Surface Half-life MeasurementTo measure the half-life at the cell surface of γcand of the different αγγn constructs, cells were incubated with cycloheximide to prevent the synthesis of new receptors. After different times of incubation at 37 °C in culture medium with 50 μm cycloheximide, the cells were cooled to 4 °C, washed, and cell surface expression of the constructs was assayed by flow cytometry as described (20Hémar A. Lieb M. Subtil A. DiSanto J.P. Dautry-Varsat A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1951-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Time 0 on the graph corresponds to a 30-min incubation in cycloheximide, which is the time required for a newly synthesized IL2 receptor to reach the cell surface (21Duprez V. Cornet V. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12860-12865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at least four times.Immunofluorescence and Confocal MicroscopyEndocytosis of Anti-γc mAbYT 12881 cells were incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C with TUGh4 mAb, before being washed in PBS at 4 °C and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde and 0.03 m sucrose for 60 min at 4 °C. Subsequent steps were performed at room temperature. The cells were washed once in PBS, quenched for 10 min in 50 mmNH4Cl in PBS, and washed once in PBS supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After two washes in the permeabilizing buffer (PBS with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.05% saponin), the presence of antibodies was revealed by incubating the cells for 60 min in permeabilizing buffer containing FITC-conjugated anti-rat IgG antibody (1/50).Direct Observation of γc, IL2Rα, or αγγwt Inside the CellsEither HeLa cells, grown on coverslips and transfected 2 days before with the plasmid of interest, or YT 12881 cells were used. Exponentially growing cells, incubated for 45 min with 50 μm cycloheximide, were washed twice with PBS and permeabilized as described above. The cells were then incubated in permeabilizing buffer for 1 h with TUGh4 mAb (1/50) for YT 12881 cells and with 7G7B6 mAb (1/800 ascites) for HeLa cells. After two washes in permeabilization buffer, cells were labeled with the second FITC-labeled antibody for 1 h in the same buffer. After washes and sample mounting, cells were examined by confocal microscopy (for the YT 12881 cells) or by epifluorescence microscopy (for HeLa cells). Washes, sample mounting, and confocal microscopy were performed as described (16Hémar A. Subtil A. Lieb M. Morelon E. Hellio R. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). No immunofluorescence staining was ever observed when second antibodies were used without the first antibody or with an irrelevant first antibody.Cell IodinationYT cells (2 × 107) washed in PBS and resuspended in PBS, pH 7.3, 1 mm Ca2+, 1 mm Mg2+ were surface-labeled using the lactoperoxidase method with 1.5 mCi of Na125I (22Hémar A. Dautry-Varsat A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 2629-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After iodination, the cells were washed twice in culture medium and then kept in a 37 °C incubator. After a 10-min incubation, considered as time 0, cells were harvested at 30-min intervals, washed in PBS, pelleted by centrifugation, and kept frozen at −20 °C before analysis by immunoprecipitation.Immunoprecipitation and Gel AnalysisCells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) complemented with 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Insoluble material was pelleted at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was then precleared for 120 min at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Les Ulis, France) before being immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with relevant first antibodies and protein A-Sepharose coated with anti-rat antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates). The first antibodies were anti-γc mAb TUGh4 (1 μg/ml) and anti-transferrin receptor mAb FG1/6 (1/200 ascitic fluid) for the measurement of γc and transferrin receptor half-life after iodination. The Sepharose beads were then washed three times in 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and once in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Bound proteins were eluted into electrophoresis sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) before analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were fixed and dried, and radioactivity in the gel bands was quantitated using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Gels were subsequently exposed to Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham, Pharmacia Biotech, Les Ulis, France) at −80 °C.DISCUSSIONEndocytosis and degradation of the cytokine receptors participate in the fine tuning of their expression on the cell surface and control the cell responsiveness to some extent. In this report we show that γc, common to at least five interleukin receptors, is constitutively internalized and degraded in lymphoid cells. We have replaced the extracellular region of γc by the extracellular part of IL2Rα. This allowed us to follow the derived chimeric constructs with available anti-α antibodies. Internalization studies show that three regions in the cytosolic tail of γc are involved in endocytosis. These regions are located between amino acids 1–35, 35–40, and 40–65 (Fig. 5). Interestingly, successive deletions of these regions lead to a decrease in endocytosis, suggesting that normal endocytosis involves several motifs along the cytosolic tail and not only one specific short sequence as described for other receptors (12Sandoval I.V. Bakke O. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 292-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The role of various cytosolic regions in endocytosis has been described previously for receptors such as the P-selectin (26Setiadi H. Disdier M. Green S.A. Canfield W.M. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26818-26826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the prolactin receptor (27Vincent V. Goffin V. Rozakis-Adcock M. Mornon J.-P. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7062-7068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and is also found in the IL2Rβ chain (28Subtil A. Dautry-Varsat A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The cytosolic domains of many membrane proteins have short sequences, usually including a tyrosine or a di-leucine motif, which mediate their rapid internalization through clathrin-coated pits. The cytosolic tail of γc contains two Tyr and two Leu-Val sequences between the first and the 65th amino acid (Fig. 4 B). Further studies are needed to determine whether these amino acids are part of the internalization motifs of IL2Rγ. The αγγ1construct, although poorly internalized, is endocytosed more efficiently than IL2Rα, suggesting that the transmembrane part of γc may also participate in the endocytic process.Besides the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway, receptors can also be internalized via an alternative pathway. Indeed, receptor-mediated endocytosis pathways through non-clathrin-coated pits have been reported for ricin (29Moya M. Dautry-Varsat A. Goud B. Louvard D. Boquet P. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 548-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 30Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Petersen O.W. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), epidermal growth factor (31Lund K.A. Opresko L.K. Starbuck C. Walsh B.J. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15713-15723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cholera and tetanus toxins (32Montesano R. Roth J. Robert A. Orci L. Nature. 1982; 296: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 33Tran D. Carpentier J.-L. Sawano F. Gorden P. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7957-7961Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this pathway has also been described for IL2 (34Subtil A. Hémar A. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3461-3468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) whose receptors contain γc. The three regions found in the cytosolic tail of γc may carry signals recognized by the cellular components of this alternative pathway. In this case, the other cytokines whose receptors share the γc chain might also be similarly internalized.In the absence of clathrin-coated-pit structures, IL2 endocytosis is 2-fold less efficient (34Subtil A. Hémar A. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3461-3468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that some IL2Rs may also be internalized via the clathrin-coated pit pathway. In this case, the three cytosolic regions of γc may contain sequences recognized with low affinity by the adaptor complexes. Addition of three weak signals may constitute an efficient signal. We have already prepared a chimeric molecule in which the internalization signal of the transferrin receptor YTRF was inserted in the cytosolic region of IL2Rα (15Subtil A. Delepierre M. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). When transfected in J77 cells, this chimeric molecule is internalized more efficiently than αγγwt, 2E. Morelon, unpublished results. indicating that the YTRF motif forms a stronger internalization signal than the addition of the three regions described above.The cytosolic domain of γc associates constitutively with the tyrosine kinase Jak3 (8Russell S.M. Johnston J.A. Noguchi M. Kawamura M. Bacon C.M. Friedmann M.C. Berg M. McVicar D.W. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Goldman A.S. Schmalstieg F.C. Ihle J.N. O'Shea J.J. Leonard W.J.

Taniguchi T. Science. 1994; 266: 1045-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Jak3 has a key role in γc-mediated signal transduction. It is phosphorylated and activated by cytokines such as IL2 and IL4, whose receptors contain γc (36Johnston J.A. Kawamura M. Kirken R.A. Chen Y.-Q. Blake T.B. Shibuya K. Ortaldo J.R. McVicar D.W. O'Shea J.J. Nature. 1994; 370: 151-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 37Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Miura O. Lai K.S. Cwik C. Liu E.T. Ihle J.N. Nature. 1994; 370: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), and its activation correlates with lymphocyte proliferation (37Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Miura O. Lai K.S. Cwik C. Liu E.T. Ihle J.N. Nature. 1994; 370: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 38Nelson B.H. Lord J.D. Greenberg P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 309-317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cytosolic region of γc necessary for binding and activating Jak3 is located between residues 40 and 52 (38Nelson B.H. Lord J.D. Greenberg P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 309-317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that the first 40 cytosolic amino acids of γc are sufficient for internalization and degradation, suggesting that Jak3 is dispensable in endocytic process. The region between residues 40 and 65, which contains the association site with Jak3, increases endocytosis, which might suggest that activation of Jak3 might participate in efficient endocytosis, as do other kinases in endocytosis of epidermal growth factor and insulin receptors (39Wiley H.S.

Chem. 1987; 262: 11833-11840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the case of IL2-dependent Jak3 stimulation, the serine-rich region of the IL2Rβ chain is required to obtain the phosphorylation of Jak3 (37Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Miura O. Lai K.S. Cwik C. Liu E.T. Ihle J.N. Nature. 1994; 370: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), indicating that stimulation via γc alone does not allow the activation of Jak3. In our cells, the chimeric constructs were studied independently of other components of cytokine receptors and should not be able to activate Jak3. Therefore, it is unlikely that Jak3 plays a role in the process of endocytosis.The half-lives of the different chimeric constructs show that a region containing the 36–40 cytosolic amino acids is involved in the degradation of γc. Indeed, whereas the deletion of the last 46 carboxyl amino acids does not modify degradation, deletion of amino acids 36–40 leads to a complete loss of degradation. Although αγγ35 is internalized less efficiently than αγγ40 (Fig. 5), this reduced efficiency of endocytosis is unlikely to account for the absence of degradation of αγγ35. In this respect, it is worth noting that αγγ40 is degraded as fast as αγγ65and αγγwt, although its internalization is less efficient (Fig. 5). Thus, the 36–40-amino acid ESLQP sequence may belong to a strong degradation signal. Interestingly, these amino acids are a potential target for a protease, calpain, found to associate to γc in a double hybrid assay and to degrade it in vitro (42Noguchi M. Sarin A. Aman M. Nakajima H. Shores E. Henkart P. Leonard W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11534-11539Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although many internalization signals have now been described, less is known about the mechanisms by which internalized receptors are directed toward degradation. Sequences necessary for internalization and degradation of plasma membrane proteins have been reported (24Letourneur F. Klausner R.D.

To address this question, we have expressed full-length α1(VIII) and α2(VIII) chains in an in vitro translation system supplemented with semipermeabilized cells. Both chains gave a translation product of ∼80 kDa that could be shown to produce a chymotrypsin/trypsin-resistant product of ∼60 kDa, indicating that both chains could form homotrimers. Hydroxylation of proline residues was a prerequisite for stable trimer formation. The melting temperature for the α1(VIII) homotrimer was 45 °C, whereas that for α2(VIII) was 42 °C. The ability of both chains of type VIII collagen to form stable triple helices suggests that there may be different forms of this collagen and that cells may modulate the chain composition in response to different biological conditions.

Trypsinized confluent HT-1080 cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with digitonin (40 μg/μl) as described (19Wilson R. Allen A.J. Oliver J. Brookman J.L. High S. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A full-length clone of α1(VIII) was previously isolated from a λgt11 human aorta cDNA library. Briefly, primary screening was carried out with probes designed to the NC1 domain. Positive clones underwent a secondary screening using a 496-base pair probe designed according to the NC2 domain and part of the helix. Subsequent positives were sequenced using λgt11 forward and reverse primers; one clone was found to contain ∼80 base pairs of 3′-untranslated region, the entire coding sequence of α1(VIII), and ∼200 base pairs of 5′-untranslated region. This was excised from λgt11 and subcloned into EcoRI-cut pBluescript(+) and designated pBlu-HaI8. An α2(VIII) clone containing the entire coding sequence was generated by overlap extension PCR from a mouse genomic clone containing exons 3 and 4, pNF-m129-21 (gift from Prof. B. Olsen, Boston, MA). First round proofreading hot start PCR was used to generate each exon separately. Combination of the two products in a second round allowed fusion and elongation of a full-length product. Reactions were carried out with the Expand High Fidelity PCR kit using the manufacturer's recommended cycling conditions. Reaction mixtures (50 μl) comprised 30 pmol of each primer, ∼10 ng of template DNA, 2.6 units of enzyme mixture (thermostable Taq and Pwo DNA polymerases), 2 mm MgCl2, 200 nm dNTPs and 1× kit buffer. Exon 3 primers were designed to sequence supplied with the pNF-m129-21 clone. 2N. Fukai, personal communication. The forward primer (5′-CGAATTCGCCATGCAGGGGGCTCTG) included the initial ATG start site (boldface), and the reverse primer (5′-CGGCAGCAGCGGTAGAGGCATTTCCAAGTACTGGCCTTTGC) represented a chimera of exon 3 and 4 α2(VIII) sequence, with the first 23 bases based on positions 51 to 29 of the published 5′-end of exon 4 (italics) and the rest from the 3′-end of exon 3. These were used to generate an expected fragment of 215 base pairs. An expected product of 1.9 kilobase pairs representing exon 4 of α2(VIII) sequence was generated using a chimeric forward primer complementary to the exon 3 reverse primer (5′-CCGAGAGGGCAAAGGCCAGTACTTGGAAATGCCTCTACCGCTGC), with the first 26 bases based on exon 3 (italics) and the remainder based on the published exon 4 sequence (positions 29–46), and a reverse primer (5′-GGCTCCGAATTATGTGGGGCAGAGC) to the 3′-end of exon 4 (positions 1923–1938) including the α2(VIII) stop codon (boldface). Purified PCR products from each reaction were combined and allowed to self-prime for six thermal cycles. Subsequent addition of the exon 3 forward primer and the exon 4 reverse primer allowed amplification of the 2.1-kilobase pair overlap extension product. A 2.1-kilobase pair fragment was purified and cloned into TA Cloning® vector pCR 2.1 and was designated pCR 2.1-MFa28. Sequencing showed successful exon fusion with the correct reading frame being maintained across the boundary (data not shown). Comparison with the known mouse exon 3 2 and NC1 sequence showed that two base changes were present, resulting in a methionine to leucine change in the NC2 domain (position 66) downstream of the predicted signal peptide cleavage and a serine to threonine change at position 239 in the NC1 domain (10Muragaki Y.

These changes were not considered to be a problem because both amino acids are present in human α2(VIII). A full-length clone of bovine α1(X) in the vector pGEM-3Z (designated pGEM-BX) was kindly donated by Dr. N. Bulleid. The clones pBlu-HaI8, pCR 2.1-MFa28, and pGEM-BX were linearized with unique vector restriction sites 3′ to the inserts: HindIII (for both collagen VIII clones) and SalI (type X collagen clone). Transcriptions were carried out on 10 μg of the linearized clones for 3–4 h at 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing >100 units of T3 RNA polymerase (for pBlu-HaI8) or T7 RNA polymerase (for pGEM-BX with PCR 2.1-MFa28), ∼70 units of RNasin, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm NTPs, and 1× transcription kit buffer. RNA was purified by binding to a commercially available spin column and eluted in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water containing 1 mmdithiothreitol and ∼35 units of RNasin. Translations were carried out using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. Reaction mixtures (volume of 51.5 μl) containing 35 μl of lysate, 20 μm amino acids (minus methionine), 50 μg/ml sodium ascorbate, 25 μCi of [35S] methionine, ∼140 units of RNasin, 2.5 or 5 μl of transcribed RNA (substituted for sterile H2O in controls), 50 nm KCl, and 4 × 105permeabilized HT-1080 cells were translated for 1.5 h at 30 °C. After this time, N-ethylmaleimide was added to a concentration of 25 mm and stored on ice. Translations were also carried out in the presence of α,α′-dipyridyl (89 μg/ml). Translation mixtures were diluted five times with 0.1 mpotassium acetate, 20 mm HEPES, and 2 mmmagnesium acetate, pH 7.2; cells were isolated by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 × g for 5 min; and appropriate aliquots were used in subsequent investigations. Aliquots of isolated cells from translation mixtures were treated with chymotrypsin/trypsin mixtures as described (20Middleton R.B. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), except that digestion was carried out for 5 min. Digestion was stopped by the addition of 2 μl of soybean trypsin inhibitor (50 mg/ml) and 2 volumes of boiling 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Aliquots of isolated cells from translation mixtures were digested for 4 h with 1 unit of high purity bacterial collagenase type III as described (20Middleton R.B. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 5 mm EDTA. Aliquots of isolated cells from translation mixtures were digested with 250 μg/ml proteinase K as described (21Bulleid N.J. Nature. 1988; 335: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Digestion was stopped with 1 mphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Aliquots of isolated cells from translation mixtures were resuspended in 10 μl of 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 1% Triton X-100 and left on ice for 10 min. Samples were added to a thermal cycling block and subjected to a range of temperatures from 36 to 50 °C, increasing by 1 °C every 2 min. Samples were removed every 2 min and subjected to a chymotrypsin/trypsin digest as described above before analysis by SDS-PAGE. Samples were taken up in 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, with or without 0.7 m β-mercaptoethanol, and analyzed on either 8 or 10% (digested samples) gels following the method of Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Samples were denatured at either 100 °C for 3 min or 60 °C for 10 min. Gels were fixed, vacuum-dried onto filter paper, and placed against Kodak X-Omat AR film for analysis. Relative molecular masses of translated products were determined by reference to14C-methylated proteins (myosin, 220 kDa; phosphorylaseb, 97.4 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 66 kDa; ovalbumin, 46 kDa; carbonic anhydrase, 30 kDa; and lysozyme, 14.3 kDa) (Calbiochem). Translation of RNA derived from both the recombinant full-length α1(VIII) and α2(VIII) constructs in an in vitro translation system supplemented with a semipermeabilized fibroblast cell line gave major products of ∼80 kDa (Fig. 1). Control reactions in which RNA was substituted for sterile water yielded no major products or background bands (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and8). The α1(VIII) 80-kDa bands corresponded approximately to the predicted molecular mass of single monomeric chains (73 kDa). As expected, α2(VIII) ran slightly faster due to a shorter NC2 domain. Both α1(VIII) and α2(VIII) chains associated to form high molecular mass products (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 9and lanes 5 and 11, respectively), which were stable at 60 °C in the presence of SDS, but were susceptible at 100 °C. This is similar to the results observed for collagen X, where it is thought that strong noncovalent interactions within the NC1 domain are responsible for oligomer stability under denaturing conditions (23Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 24Chan D. Weng Y.M. Hocking A.M. Golub S. McQuillan D.J.

Mayer U. von der Mark K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4547-4555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These high molecular mass products were not susceptible to reducing conditions. The use of semipermeabilized cells has been shown to allow the formation of disulfide bonds (19Wilson R. Allen A.J. Oliver J. Brookman J.L. High S. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar); however, interchain disulfide bonds do not appear to be involved in oligomerization of either chain. Differing intensities were observed between the translation products of α1(VIII) and α2(VIII). This was a reproducible finding and can be attributed to differing amounts of label incorporation (22 methionines present in α1(VIII) and 7 in PCR 2.1-MFa28). Proteinase K digests confirmed translocation of protein products to the cellular rough endoplasmic reticulum (Fig.2). Both α1(VIII) and α2(VIII) showed evidence of compartmental protection. Intact 80-kDa bands were present after treatment (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and9). Only when isolated cells were treated with Triton X-100 prior to digestion were the monomeric chains degraded. The translation products were shown to be collagenous by their susceptibility to high purity bacterial collagenase type III (Fig. 3). α1(VIII) collagenase-resistant bands were seen migrating at ∼22 kDa (assumed to represent the NC1 domain), and a diffuse band at ∼50 kDa. The latter was stable at 60 °C (Fig. 3, lanes 3and 10, NC1x arrow), but was eliminated at 100 °C, resulting in a corresponding increase in intensity of the 22-kDa band (lanes 4 and 11, α1 NC1 arrow). In the case α2(VIII), a similar collagenase-resistant band was observed, although it had a lower molecular mass of ∼18 kDa that ran at or near the dye front (Fig. 3,lanes 6, 7, 13, and14, α2 NC1 arrow). Chymotrypsin/trypsin digestion has previously been demonstrated as a reliable assay for the formation of stable triple helical molecules of collagen X (20Middleton R.B. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and is based on the premise that incompletely folded or incorrectly folded helices of collagen are sensitive to proteolytic cleavage. Only the non-collagenous domains NC1 and NC2 of correctly folded collagen VIII homotrimers will be degraded, leaving the helical domain intact. When both the α1(VIII) and α2(VIII) translation products were digested with chymotrypsin/trypsin, a 60-kDa band was evident (Fig.4, lanes 3,6, 10, and 14, 60kDa arrow) in both the reduced and nonreduced samples, indicating the ability of both chains to form a triple helix. Considerable differing band intensity could be seen between the α2(VIII) 80- and 60-kDa bands despite equal amounts of translation product in each lane (Fig. 4,lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 13 and 14, respectively). This was also observed with the α1(VIII) samples, albeit to a lesser extent. This principally reflects a reduction in methionine label upon removal of the non-collagenous domains (45% for α1(VIII) and 87.5% for α2(VIII)). Phosphoimage analysis of the undigested and digested bands showed that both the α1(VIII) and α2(VIII) chains exhibited a similar efficiency for triple helix formation. The stability of the helix, and therefore its resistance to proteolytic attack, is dependent on the degree of hydroxylation of proline residues as shown by translations carried out in the presence of α,α′-dipyridyl. A chymotrypsin/trypsin digest carried out on the translation products of either α1(VIII) or α2(VIII) did not produce the 60-kDa fragment (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and12 and lanes 7 and 15,respectively), indicating that hydroxylation of procollagen chains was necessary for the formation of correctly aligned stable triple helices at 30 °C. The stability of the α1(VIII) and α2(VIII) homotrimers produced in vitro was assessed by measuring chain denaturation temperature (Tm). Translation products of both chains were subjected to a variety of temperatures and digested with chymotrypsin/trypsin (Fig.5). Resistant helical band intensities were quantified by phosphoimage analysis, and a 50% loss was seen at 45 °C for α1(VIII) (Fig. 5 A, lane 6) and at 42 °C for α2(VIII) (Fig. 5 B, lane 9). The latter produced a major product of ∼60 kDa and a slightly smaller minor fragment. A control Tm determination was carried out on bovine α1(X) and found to be 44 °C (data not shown). Despite the fact that type VIII collagen has been known for over 16 years and the gene structure has been delineated, there is still a dearth of information about the protein and its supramolecular structure. The best available information suggests that in Descemet's membrane, type VIII collagen is a heterotrimer with a chain composition of (α1(VIII))2(α2(VIII)), which appears to aggregate to form a hexagonal lattice structure (12Sawada H. Konomi H. Hirosawa K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 13Mann K. Jander R. Korsching E. Kuhn K. Rauterberg J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 273: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Similarity to type X collagen supports comparisons between these two molecules, and whereas they have similar gene structures and collagen helices (9Yamaguchi N. Benya P.D. van der Rest M. Ninomiya Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16022-16029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), type X collagen appears to be a product of the hypertrophic chondrocyte and epiphysial cartilage, and it is becoming increasingly clear that a variety of cell types can synthesize and secrete type VIII collagen (16Kittleberger R. Davis P.F. Flynn D.W. Greenhill N.S. Connect. Tissue Res. 1990; 24: 303-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This raises the question as to whether all cells produce type VIII collagen with the same chain composition and how these variations in chain composition affect the supramolecular structure and function. We have been trying to address the question of chain composition by looking at the ability of the α-chains to form stable triple helices in an in vitro translation system. The experiments described clearly show that full-length α1(VIII) and α2(VIII) can be successfully translated in vitro and that these chains associate into stable homotrimeric molecules. The translated chains were of the correct size and were susceptible to collagenase. These chains appeared to form higher molecular mass aggregates that were stable to denaturation at 60 °C, although they disappeared when heated to 100 °C. By analogy to type X collagen, the association is presumably mediated by the NC1 domain. It has been shown that both full-length α1(X) oligomers and collagenase-resistant NC1 aggregates are stable under denaturing conditions (23Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 24Chan D. Weng Y.M. Hocking A.M. Golub S. McQuillan D.J. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13566-13572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25Frischholz S. Beier F. Girkontaite I. Wagner K. Poschl E. Turnay J. Mayer U. von der Mark K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4547-4555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In support of this, the presumed NC1 domain of α1(VIII) produced by collagenase digestion could be shown to aggregate into a 50-kDa complex (Fig. 3, NC1x arrow). The two collagen types share a high degree of homology within this domain, and current thinking on folding of both collagens VIII and X centers on common hydrophobic groupings within the NC1 domain acting as nucleation centers for zipper-like trimerization in a carboxyl- to amino-terminal direction (26Brass A. Kadler K.E. Thomas J.T. Grant M.E. Boot-Handford R.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 365Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Such homology maybe responsible for the strong noncovalent interactions shown here. However, the absence of an α2(VIII) collagenase-resistant NC1 aggregate implies that there may be other requirements for full-length α2(VIII) chain oligomerization. Both the α1(VIII) and α2(VIII) chains were shown to be triple helical molecules by their resistance to chymotrypsin/trypsin mixture and the appearance of a 60-kDa proteinase-resistant fragment. The presence of a second slightly smaller chymotrypsin/trypsin-resistant fragment of α2(VIII) could be due to the presence of a Gly-X-Y imperfection 41 amino acids from the start of the helical domain; unlike all of the α1(VIII) imperfections that represent Gly-X-Gly, this is a Gly-X-X-X-X imperfection and may constitute a cleavage site in the triple helix. Unlike previous reports, our results show that a stable triple helix is only formed if hydroxylation of proline occurs, as no proteinase-resistant fragments were obtained after incubation in the presence of α,α′-dipyridyl, a prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (27Juva K. Prockop D.J. Cooper G.W. Lash J.W. Science. 1966; 152: 92-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The stability of a triple helix is determined by hydrogen bonds between chains, a high imino acid content, and possibly side chain interactions. The importance of hydroxylation of proline to helix stability has been clearly shown (28Sakakibara S. Inouye K. Shudo K. Kishida Y. Kobayashi Y. Prockop D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 303: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In addition, recent work has highlighted the importance of Gly-Pro-Arg triplets and appropriate charged residues in the X and Y positions (29Yang W. Chan V.C. Kirkpatrick A. Ramshaw J.A.M. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28837-28840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar,30Chan V.C. Ramshaw J.A.M. Kirkpatrick A. Beck K. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31441-31446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Stabilization by glycosylated threonine appears to be significant only in vent worm cuticle collagen (31Mann K. Mechling D.E. Bachinger H.P. Eckerskorn C. Gaill F. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The use of semipermeabilized cells allowed maximum modification of prolyl residues. In this system, bovine α1(X) homopolymers had a Tm of 44 °C, which is higher than that reported in a translation system supplemented with isolated HT-1080 microsomes (Tm = 41 °C), an alternative source of endoplasmic reticulum (20Middleton R.B. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the case of α1(VIII) homopolymers, a Tm of 45 °C was found. A previous report (18Rosenblum N.D Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) has presented evidence that α1(VIII) chains can form homotrimers in a cell-free system; this is the first conclusive proof that stable trimers are formed and that hydroxylation of proline is a prerequisite. The Tm of 42 °C reported here for the α2(VIII) homopolymers is less than that for both α1(VIII) and α1(X), which was a surprising finding since in human α2(VIII), there are more prolines present in the Yposition of the Gly-X-Y triplet than there are in α1(VIII) (76 versus 73) and more Gly-Pro-Arg triplets (11versus 6). There are no available data at present on the mouse sequence, but these results appear to indicate that not all prolines are hydroxylated in the helix or that there are less potential proline substrates in the mouse than in the human. Further work is required to clarify these apparent differences in stability. Although the function of type VIII collagen is not known, it is becoming clear that it is expressed in many situations associated with inflammation and repair, where it may form a provisional matrix for cell attachment and migration (5Macbeath J.R.E. Kielty C.M. Shuttleworth C.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 17Sibinga N.E.S. Foster L.C. Hsieh C.H. Perrella M.A. Lee W.S. Endege W.O. Sage H. Lee M.E.

Clearly, the ability to form strong, stable molecular assemblies will be a major determinant of that function. The present results suggest that molecules with different chain assemblies may be one way of modulating provisional matrices produced by different cell populations. We thank Dr. D. John and fellow workers for advice on setting up the translation system."
https://openalex.org/W2114535905,"Liver allograft rejection is mediated by a primary response of T lymphocytes, followed by infiltration of the graft with a mixed inflammatory reaction. Using single and double label immunocytochemistry, we examined the proliferation index and the phenotype of leukocytes on liver biopsies from 10 patients with acute rejection before and after treatment with i.v. steroids, 10 patients with chronic rejection, 10 patients without rejection posttransplant, and 15 nongrafted, nonimmunosuppressed patients. Proliferation of mononuclear leukocytes (assessed by expression of Ki-67, a nuclear antigen associated with the cell cycle) inside the allograft was a prominent feature of acute and chronic rejection and was down-regulated by steroid treatment. Leukocytes in cell cycle were located predominantly in the portal tracts at the site of the inflammatory infiltrate. The majority of 'naive' (CD45RA+) and 'memory' (CD45RO+) CD4+ T lymphocytes were also periportally distributed. In contrast, CD8+ T lymphocytes, CD57+ natural killer cells, and CD68+ macrophages were located intraparenchymally throughout the liver lobules, whereas CD20+ B lymphocytes were only present in some of the portal tracts. Predominantly CD4+ and occasionally CD8+ lymphocytes were proliferating (assessed by double staining). The proliferating CD4+ cells were of both naive (CD4+, CD45RA+) and memory (CD4+, CD45RO+) phenotypes. To our knowledge, this is the first description of proliferating naive T lymphocytes in situ in liver allografts. These findings suggest that there may be a primary immune response generated within the allograft as well as in draining lymphatic tissue. This implicates not only intrahepatic proliferation of T lymphocytes as a prominent feature of rejection, but also suggests that the liver has a special immunological status comparable to that of lymphatic tissue."

Alignment of the PQQ-binding protein or subunit in these dehydrogenases revealed that they have three homologous regions including the highly conserved region consisting of about 70 amino acid sequences at their C termini (20Anthony C. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which had been predicted as a common PQQ-binding site (16Inoue T. Sunagawa M. Mori A. Imai C. Fukuda M. Tagaki M. Yano K.

Therefore, the structure of the catalytic proteins of quinoprotein dehydrogenases may be partially similar to each other, but they transfer electrons to different components. Recently, three-dimensional structures of MDHs from three different sources of Methylophilus methylotrophus, Methylophilus W3A1, and Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 (24Xia Z.-X. Dai W.-W. Xiong J.-P.

On the basis of the structure, a model structure of GDH was proposed except for its N terminus and several unique segments that are absent in MDH of M. extorquens (27Cozier G.E. Anthony C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, neither direct evidence supporting the structure nor x-ray crystallography has been reported yet. In order to identify amino acid residues crucial for GDH function, we introduced random mutagenesis that may be useful for structurally unknown enzyme. A single protein GDH is a good model to elucidate the molecular mechanism of catalytic reaction or intramolecular electron transfer of the primary dehydrogenase in the respiratory chain. This is the first report on GDH mutant isolation and characterization except for one that showed a mutant with little effect on the activity (28Sode K. Sano H. Biotechnol. Lett. 1994; 16: 455-460Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We obtained several E. coli mutant GDHs, and then characterized them in respect to their glucose dehydrogenase, ubiquinone reductase, and glucose oxidase activities. Mutant GDHs with a pronounced effect on the enzyme activities were purified and their kinetic parameters were determined. The mutation effect of some mutants were further examined by introducing different amino acid substitutions. We identified at least two crucial residues, Asp-730 and His-775, possibly related to proton transfer and to binding to PQQ, respectively, to which no corresponding residue was proposed in the GDH model (27Cozier G.E. Anthony C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase,Taq DNA polymerase, and the DNA sequencing kit were purchased from Takara Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan). Oligonucleotide primers were made by ourselves on a DNA synthesizer, Gene Assembler Plus (Pharmasia, Uppsala, Sweden) or by Sawady Technology (Tokyo, Japan). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. The bacterial strains used in this study were all derivatives of E. coli K12. Their relevant genotypes and plasmids are shown in Table I. Mutationsgcd::cm, insertion of the cmgene into the gcd gene encoding GDH, and Δpts,lacking the ptsHI, from YU124 and LJ288, respectively, were transferred into W3110 by P1 transduction (32Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). The resulting YU245 was still able to grow on M9 glucose minimal medium (32Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). Thus, afterN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis (32Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria.

YU312 exhibited weak red colonies on tetrazolium plates (32Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria.

Yamada, unpublished data.d Obtained by site-directed mutagenesis. Open table in a new tab To certainly obtain gcd mutants, the gcd gene on a high copy plasmid, pUCGCD1 (19Yamada M. Asaoka S. Saier Jr., M.H. Yamada Y. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 568-571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was subcloned into a low copy plasmid of a pACYC177 derivative, pACYC177-322, in which the largeBamHI-PstI fragment of pACYC177 had been connected with the small BamHI-PstI fragment of pBR322. The EcoRI-PstI fragment bearing thegcd gene from pUCGCD1 was inserted into theEcoRI-PstI site of pACYC177–322, generating pACGCD1. The DraI-PstI fragment bearing thegcd gene from pUCGCD1 was inserted into theHincII-PstI site of pUC118. From the resulting pUCGCD2, the EcoRI-PstI fragment bearing thegcd gene was inserted into theEcoRI-PstI site of pACYC177-322, generating pACGCD2. The gcd gene on pACGCD1 is about 200 base pairs larger at the 5′-upstream noncoding region than that on pACGCD2. We used these two plasmids for different mutagenesis because they have different restriction sites at the 5′-upstream region. After mutagenesis, each mutated region of the gcd gene was replaced into the wild type gcd gene of pUCGCD1 to facilitate enzyme assay. To mutagenize the conserved C terminus from the 734th to 796th amino acid in GDH, region-specific PCR mutagenesis was performed with two primers, 5′-TTGCATGCCTGCAGGTC-3′ and 5′-TTGGATCCAACAGGGTACGCTGGTC-3′ in an 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tube in a final volume of 100 μl in which 0.1 nm pUCGCD1, a dNTP mixture (125 μm each of dATP, dTTP, and dGTP, and 12.5 μm dCTP, or 125 μm each of dATP, dCTP and dGTP, and 12.5 μm dTTP), 100 pmol of each oligonucleotide primer, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase were added in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.001% gelatin (w/v). Twenty-five polymerase chain reactions, each of which consisted of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 2 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min, were carried out by a DNA Thermal Cycler, PJ2000 (Perkin-Elmer) as described (10Yamada M. Sumi K. Matsushita K. Adachi O. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12812-12817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR products were electrophoresed by Sea-plaque gels (Takara Shuzo) and recovered by ethanol precipitation after extraction from the gel and phenol extraction. The PCR fragments were then digested withBssHII and PstI, and inserted into theBssHII-PstI site of pACGCD2. To mutagenize the whole region of gcd encoding GDH, in vitro mutagenesis with hydroxylamine was carried out as described (34Manayan R. Tenn G. Yee H.B. Desai J.D. Yamada M. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1290-1296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA solution (100 μl) of pACGCD1 (10 μg) in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA was mixed with 200 μl of 0.6 m NH2OH in 40 mmK2HPO4 and 1 mm EDTA, and then incubated overnight at 37 °C. The materials were then dialyzed three times against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and recovered by ethanol precipitation. The plasmid DNA was used as a mutagenized DNA for transformation. Mutagenized plasmid DNA was introduced into YU312, and weak red color colonies on tetrazolium plates (32Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) containing 0.5% glucose, 0.1 μm PQQ, and 50 μg/ml kanamycin were isolated as the gcd mutant. To avoid mutants producing immature GDHs, the isolates were then examined by Western blot using an antibody raised against GDH as described previously (35Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by measurement of GDH activity. Conventional recombinant DNA techniques (36Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) were used. To determine the mutation sites, nucleotide sequencing was carried out by the dideoxy chain termination method (37Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52653) Google Scholar) after subcloning DNA fragments into M13 mp18 or mp19 vector (38Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11462) Google Scholar) or with the Thermo Sequenase cycle sequencing kit (Amersham, Brucks, United Kingdom). To determine the region including the mutation site of the mutants from hydroxylamine mutagenesis, recombination between the mutant gcd genes and the wild typegcd gene was performed. When theSalI-PstI fragment of the wild typegcd gene encoding the C-terminal five-sixth portion of the enzyme was replaced by corresponding mutant fragments, all recombinants showed the mutant phenotype. Further recombination experiments using two fragments produced from the SalI-PstI fragment by SmaI digestion indicated that two of them have mutation sites between the SalI and SmaI sites and the other two have between the SmaI and PstI sites. These limited regions were then subjected to nucleotide sequencing. To obtain mutants, R687A, R687D, G689A, D693A, D730A, D730R, and H775A, site-specific mutagenesis was carried out using the Mutan-Super Express Km kit (Takara Shuzo). Mutagenic primers used: 5′-TGGAAGAAAGCTATTGGTAC-3′for R687A; 5′-TGGAAGAAAGATATTGGTAC-3′ for R687D; 5′-AACGTATTGCTACGCCGCAG-3′ for G689A; 5′-CGCCGCAGGCCAGTATGCCG-3′ for D693A; 5′-GCTACGGCAGCTAACTACCT-3′ for D730A; 5′-GCTACGGCACGTAACTACCT-3′ for D730R; and 5′-GCAGGCGGTGCCGGTTCATT-3′ for H775A. Introduced mutations were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Cells harboring wild type plasmid, pUCGCD1, or mutant plasmids, pUCGCDs, were grown in LB (1% Bacto-tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl) containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) for 14 h at 37 °C, harvested, and washed twice with 0.85% NaCl. The cells were then disrupted by passing twice through a French pressure cell press (16,000 p.s.i.). After removing unbroken cells by a low speed centrifuge, membrane fractions were recovered by centrifugation at 86,000 × g for 90 min. The membrane was suspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0 (about 10 mg of protein/ml), for enzyme assay. PMS and Q-1 reductase activities of GDH, and glucose oxidase activity were measured as described previously (8Matsushita K. Shinagawa E. Adachi O. Ameyama M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1989; 105: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 10Yamada M. Sumi K. Matsushita K. Adachi O. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12812-12817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dehydrogenase (PMS reductase) activity was also measured with maltose, fucose, galactose, or xylose, instead of glucose, as a substrate as described previously (39Ameyama M. Nonobe M. Shinagawa E. Matsushita K. Takimoto K. Adachi O. Agri. Biol. Chem. 1986; 50: 49-57Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Succinate dehydrogenase (PMS reductase) activity was measured as a control by the same assay method used for GDH except that PQQ was omitted. Kinetic parameters were estimated from the Lineweaver-Burk plot drawn by using the program EnzymeKinetics (Trinity Software Technical Support, NH). Protein content was determined according to the Dulley and Grieve method (40Dulley J.R. Grieve P.A. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 64: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Fluorescence spectra were taken by using a Hitachi-650–10S of 1-ml samples (0.4 μm in enzyme) in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 0.2% β-octylgluoside and 3 mmMgCl2 in the presence or absence of 1.5 μmPQQ. Fluorescence emission was scanned from 290 to 460 nm at 25 °C with an excitation at 280 nm. Four mutant GDHs with significant effect on the enzyme activity were purified according to the procedure as described previously (10Yamada M. Sumi K. Matsushita K. Adachi O. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12812-12817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In S357L and G689D, all purification steps were performed in the presence of 10 nmPQQ to stabilize enzyme activity. Purified mutant proteins as well as wild type were analyzed by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealing that their purity was more than 95% homogeneity. To take fluorescence spectra, the purified protein was readsorbed to DEAE column equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and after washing with the same buffer in the absence of Triton, the enzyme was eluted with the same buffer containing 0.2% β-octylgluoside. Out of 30 Gcd−mutants isolated from region-specific mutagenesis, targeting the conserved C terminus of GDH, four were found to exhibit less than 10% PMS reductase activity of the wild type. In the mutant plasmids, pACGCD2Ms, from the four mutants, the BssHII-PstI fragments corresponding to those prepared by the PCR mutagenesis were sequenced. Three of them were found to have a single mutation in the region and the remaining one has double, and all mutations except for one of the double mutants occurred at the conserved amino acid residues among GDHs of E. coli, A. calcoaceticus, and G. oxydans (Table I). Of these mutants, three mutant GDHs from pACGCD2M9, M13, and M15 were detected by Western blot analysis using an antibody against E. coli GDH but not one from pACGCD2M5 (data not shown). pACGCD2M5 has a nonsense mutation at the 765th codon in the gcd gene, resulting in producing an immature GDH presumably susceptible to intracellular proteolytic degradation. The mutated protein from pACGCD2M9 is expected to have an extra 18 amino acid residues because of mutation of the intrinsic stop codon, which was indicated as a slightly slow migration in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Out of 32 Gcd− mutants isolated from hydroxylamine mutagenesis, four had less than 10% PMS reductase activity of the wild type. These mutants were also analyzed by Western blot to confirm producing GDH protein. To limit the region including mutation sites, recombination between the mutant gcd genes and the wild typegcd gene was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the limited regions were sequenced. All mutations of the four mutants, pACGCD1N2, -3, -4, or -7, are G to A or C to T as shown in Table I, suggesting that they are derived from the hydroxylamine treatment, and all mutations occurred at conserved amino acid residues among GDHs of the three organisms. To compare the mutant GDHs with the wild type, activities of PMS reductase, Q-1 reductase, and glucose oxidase were measured with the membrane fractions (TableII). Relative GDH protein contents in the fractions were estimated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2), and then relative PMS reductase activity was calculated based on the relative GDH contents. The results revealed that all mutant GDHs have PMS reductase activity less than 10% of the wild type, with comparable Q-1 reductase and glucose oxidase activities except for G741S and -797K (where - means a stop codon). The latter two mutant GDHs seem to retain equivalent activities of PMS reductase and glucose oxidase to those of the wild type, so their apparent reduced activities may be due to lower content of GDH in the membrane than that of the wild type. The mutant -797K reduced Q-1 reductase activity without the significant effect onKm values for PQQ and Mg2+ or on glucose oxidase activity, which reflects the normal electron transfer from GDH via intrinsic Q-8 to cytochrome oxidase. Thus, it seems that the additional C-terminal 18 amino acid residues of the mutant GDH may hamper access of the artificial Q-1, or change the conformation of the Q-1 reacting site but not of the Q-8 re"

Purified recombinant I domains have intrinsic ligand binding activity, and in several systems this interaction has been demonstrated to be cation-dependent. It has been proposed that the I domain cation-binding site represents a general metal ion-dependent adhesion motif utilized for binding protein ligands. Here we show that the purified recombinant I domain of LFA-1 (αLI) binds cations, but with significantly different characteristics compared with the I domain of MAC-1 (αMI). Both αLI and αMI bind54Mn2+ in a conformation-dependent manner, and in general, cations with charge and size characteristics similar to Mn2+ most effectively inhibit54Mn2+ binding. Surprisingly, however, physiological levels of Ca2+ (1–2 mm) inhibited 54Mn2+ binding to purified αLI, but not to αMI. Using45Ca2+ and 54Mn2+ in direct binding studies, the dissociation constants (KD) for the interactions between these cations and αLI were estimated to be 5–6 × 10−5and 1–2 × 10−5m, respectively. Together with the available structural information, the data suggest differential affinities for Mn2+ and Ca2+binding to the single conserved site within αLI. Antagonism of LFA-1, but not MAC-1, -mediated cell adhesion by Ca2+ may be related to the Ca2+ binding activity of the LFA-1 I domain.

Mg2+ and Mn2+ induce conformational alterations of several integrins, including LFA-1 and MAC-1, concomitant with activation of integrin-mediated adhesion to ligands (22Altieri D.C. J.

Craig A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 25Graham I.L. Brown E.J. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 685-691PubMed Google Scholar, 26Jackson A.M.

We speculated that the differential effects of Ca2+ and Mn2+/Mg2+ on LFA-1 and MAC-1 function might be related to differences in the divalent cation binding properties of their I domains. In the work described herein, we compared the cation binding properties of purified recombinant αL and αM I domains. Our results indicate that like αMI, αLI preferentially binds Mn2+ over most other cations. However, Mn2+interaction with αLI was inhibitable to some degree using a variety of cations, and these studies revealed a pattern of binding selectivity that was clearly distinct from αMI. Interestingly, Ca2+ inhibited Mn2+ binding to αLI, but had little effect on Mn2+ binding to αMI, underscoring a fundamental difference in the cation-binding properties of these two I domains. Furthermore, experiments confirmed that αLI binds both Mn2+ and Ca2+ and the results are consistent with the notion that the αLI contains a single mixed-type Mn2+/Ca2+-binding site. It is possible that the activation state of LFA-1 is regulated in part by the interaction of the I domain with cations present in the extracellular environment. Ca2+ antagonism of LFA-1, but not MAC-1, mediated cell adhesion may be a consequence of the Ca2+ binding activity of the I domain of LFA-1 in that the Mn2+ and Ca2+ complexes of αLI may represent, respectively, high- and low-affinity ligand binding states.DISCUSSIONThe results of this study clearly show that the purified I domains of LFA-1 and MAC-1 bind cations with distinct selectivity. Binding of54Mn2+ to αLI was inhibitable by a variety of divalent and trivalent cations with a range of ionic radii. In contrast, binding to αMI appeared to be more specific for smaller divalent cations. Notably, Ca2+inhibited 54Mn2+ binding to αLI at concentrations well below those found in physiological environments (34Henry J.B. Clinical Diagnosis and Management by Laboratory Methods. 18th Ed. W. B. Saunders Company Brace Jovanovich, Inc., Philadelphia, PA1991Google Scholar), whereas Ca2+ failed to inhibit54Mn2+ binding to αMI even when present at approximately 105mexcess. These results demonstrate a fundamental biochemical difference between these two closely related integrins, a finding with potential functional significance in the modulation of cell-ligand interactions.In initial experiments, the comparison of the cation binding activities of the I domains of αL and αM were made between the intact MBP-αLI fusion protein (αLIf) and αMI, the I domain of αM that was cleaved from the GST-αMI fusion protein. It seemed possible that the cation binding characteristics of αLIf were unique to the MBP-αLI fusion protein and not reflective of the inherent cation binding activity of the LFA-1 I domain. To test this notion, we purified the isolated I domain of LFA-1 (αLIi) and then compared the cation binding characteristics of both forms of the LFA-1 I domain. The results of these experiments showed that: 1)54Mn2+ binds to both αLIi and αLIf in a saturable manner; 2) binding is inhibitable with both unlabeled Ca2+ and Mn2+; and 3) both αLIi and αLIf, but not αMI, bind 45Ca2+. Furthermore, in these experiments, the concentration of54Mn2+ was approximately 0.2 μm, a Mn2+ concentration approximately 5000-fold below theKD of the MBP low affinity cation-binding site in αLIf. Under these conditions54Mn2+ binding is restricted to the LFA-1 I domain component of αLIf, a conclusion supported by the observation that Ca2+ binds to immobilized αLIi and αLIf, but not to MBP, a consequence of the relatively disparate cation binding affinities of the I domain and MBP components of αLIf. Collectively, the results suggest that αLIi and αLIf have similar cation binding characteristics and appear to be interchangeable in these experiments.The binding data suggest that Ca2+ and Mn2+bind to a single site within the I domain of LFA-1.45Ca2+ and 54Mn2+ binding was inhibited by either unlabeled cation, demonstrating that these two cations bind to the LFA-1 I domain in a mutually competitive manner. Ca2+ and Mn2+ bind to the I domain of LFA-1 with similar affinity and stoichiometry with 1 μmol of cation bound/mol of I domain indicative of a Ca2+/Mn2+mixed type binding site. We speculate that the Ca2+/Mn2+-binding site in αLI may represent an equivalent Ca2+/Mg2+-binding site since, as we show here, Mg2+ is an effective inhibitor of Mn2+ binding to αLI. Collectively, these results are consistent with the available structural information showing that the I domains of LFA-1 and MAC-1 contain a single Mn2+/Mg2+-binding site (19Lee J. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 21Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 29Michishita M. Videm V. Arnaout M.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Comparable structural data describing an I domain Ca2+-binding site has not been presented; the information herein is the first demonstration that the I domain of LFA-1 binds Ca2+ as well as Mn2+ and that both cations bind to a single site in a competitive manner. It should be noted that these metal binding studies were conducted using solid-phase binding techniques and it is possible that the physical interaction of the proteins with the nitrocellulose membrane could affect the metal binding characteristics. Consequently, confirmation of the reported binding constants using solution phase equilibrium binding dialyisis would be useful.Considerable evidence supports the idea that cation-binding to integrin I domain MIDAS motifs plays a role in modulating the interaction of intact integrin with ligand. Mg2+ and Mn2+induce conformational changes in integrins and both cations stimulate LFA-1-mediated cell adhesion to ICAM-1 (22-24,26,27). In contrast, Ca2+ inhibits Mn2+-induced activation of LFA-1, and Mg2+ stimulation of LFA-1 mediated cell adhesion to ICAM-1 requires prior chelation of Ca2+ by EGTA treatment (24Dransfield I. Cabanas C. Craig A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 26Jackson A.M. Alexandroff A.B. Lappin M.B. Esuvaranathan K. James K. Chisholm G.D. J.

That the effects of divalent cations on integrin-mediated cell adhesion may be related to cation binding and cation-induced changes in I domain conformation is suggested by several observations. First, the recombinant forms of the I domains derived from a variety of integrins have intrinsic ligand binding activity. Second, ligand binding activity is cation-dependent and supported by Mn2+ and Mg2+, results that reflect the activity of the these cations on the behavior of the intact integrin (12Tuckwell D. Calderwood D.A. Green L.J. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Randi A.M. Hogg N. J. Biol.

Third, activation-specific conformational changes (neoepitopes) have been mapped to the I domain of MAC-1 (17Zhou L. Lee D.H.S. Plescia J. Lau C.Y. Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17075-17079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Finally the structural data reported by Lee et al. (20Lee J.O. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Structure. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) showed αMI crystals grown in Mg2+ display large differences in conformation and dramatic alteration of the surface of the protein implicated in ligand binding compared with crystals grown in Mn2+. These investigators proposed that the Mg2+ and Mn2+ structures represent conformations of the I domain that exist in the active and inactive states of the integrin, respectively (20Lee J.O. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Structure. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In addition, it was speculated that Ca2+ binding to the integrin I domain might stabilize the inactive form of the integrin (20Lee J.O. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Structure. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest that cation binding to the I domain modifies integrin interaction with ligand and raises the question whether cation-I domain complexes might exert activating or inactivating ligand-binding effects that are dependent upon the cation type.Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+ are present in the extracellular environment and all are available to compete for binding to the I domain. The normal concentration of Ca2+and Mg2+ in serum is approximately 1 mm (34Henry J.B. Clinical Diagnosis and Management by Laboratory Methods. 18th Ed. W. B. Saunders Company Brace Jovanovich, Inc., Philadelphia, PA1991Google Scholar), and it has been estimated that the concentration of Mn2+may range from 1 to 50 μm depending upon the particular tissue environment (36Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assuming that the cation binding properties of the isolated recombinant I domain and the native I domain within the context of the holoprotein are similar, the high concentration of cation relative to the Kd for cation binding to the I domain predicts that the metal-binding site in the I domain of LFA-1 will be occupied by cation. Furthermore, based on the evidence discussed above supporting the idea that cation-binding to integrin I domain MIDAS motifs play a role in modifying the integrin interaction with ligand, it is conceivable that I domain of low affinity LFA-1 on circulating leukocytes may be complexed with calcium, and that activation to the high affinity form may be accompanied by the replacement of Ca2+ with Mg2+ or Mn2+.It seems possible that integrin activation could be driven in some environments by dynamic alteration in the ratio of cation concentration, for example, at sites of vascular or tissue injury or bone resorption (22Altieri D.C. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1891-1898PubMed Google Scholar, 36Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Lange T.S.

Clin Invest. 1995; 95: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, a more likely scenario is that cation binding to the I domain of LFA-1 is only one of multiple factors that together coordinate and regulate LFA-1 activation. Additional components of the activation process likely include conformational changes conferred by inside-out signaling mechanisms and ligand binding (40Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Cabanas C. Hogg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5838-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 42Petruzzelli L. Maduzia L. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4208-4216PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, structural changes in the integrin ectodomain mediated by inside-out signaling processes, ligand binding, and the association of Mg2+ or Mn2+ cation binding with the I domain, may combine to produce the activated form of LFA-1. LFA-1 (αLβ2) and MAC-1 (αMβ2) are closely related leukocyte integrins that are essential for normal immune system functions (1Arnaout M.A. Blood. 1990; 75: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Adams D. Shaw S. Lancet. 1994; 343: 831-836Abstract PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Both integrins bind to several distinct ligands, but share in the ability to bind ICAM-1, a widely expressed cell surface protein (3Marlin S.D. Springer T.A.

Recent studies suggest that in the β2 and other non-RGD binding integrins, additional and perhaps multiple subdomains within both the α and β subunits may contribute to form the complete ligand-binding domain. One of these subdomains is the I domain (also known as the A domain), a region of approximately 200 amino acids found in a variety of proteins as well as the α subunit ectodomain of all β2 integrins and VLA-1 (α1β1), VLA-2 (α2β1), and αEβ7 (6Shaw S.K.

Mg2+ and Mn2+ induce conformational alterations of several integrins, including LFA-1 and MAC-1, concomitant with activation of integrin-mediated adhesion to ligands (22Altieri D.C. J.

Increasing ATP concentrations from 0.1 to 1 mM increased beta-subunit tyrosine phosphorylation and insulin receptor kinase (IRK) activity assayed after partial purification. At higher (5 mM) ATP concentrations beta-subunit tyrosine phosphorylation and IRK activity were markedly decreased. This was not observed with nonhydrolyzable analogs of ATP, nor with plasma membrane IRK, nor with endosomal epidermal growth factor receptor kinase autophosphorylation. The inhibition of endosomal IRK tyrosine phosphorylation and activity was completely reversed by bafilomycin A1, indicating a role for endosomal proton pump(s). The inhibition of IRK was not due to serine/threonine phosphorylation nor was it influenced by the inhibition of phosphotyrosyl phosphatase using bisperoxo(1,10-phenanthroline)oxovanadate anion. Prior phosphorylation of the beta-subunit with 1 mM ATP did not prevent the inhibition of IRK activity on incubating with 5 mM ATP. To evaluate conformational change we incubated endosomes with dithiothreitol (DTT) followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. Without DTT the predominant species of IRK observed was alpha2 beta2. With DTT the alpha beta dimer predominated but on co-incubation with 5 mM ATP the alpha2 beta2 form predominated. Thus, ATP-dependent endosomal acidification contributes to the termination of transmembrane signaling by, among other processes, effecting a deactivating conformational change of the IRK."
https://openalex.org/W1482829814,"A vaccine against HIV-1 virus would block initial infection and must target conserved residues. Since initial infection depends on binding of the viral envelope protein gp120 to CD4 on the cell surface, the CD4 binding site of gp120 is a target for vaccine design. To identify the optimal biologically active site, we synthesized a series of 32-mer peptides, based on conserved residues in the C3 and C4 regions of gp120. These included three of five sequence discontinuous residues known to be involved in CD4 binding, one or two of which were substituted with alanine. We also synthesized a 44-mer peptide with an additional branch to incorporate an extra C4 region sequence including a fourth CD4 binding residue. All these peptides used an oxidized Cys-X-Cys bridge to link the discontinuous sequence elements in a manner suggested by the known conserved disulfide bridges in gp120. Polyclonal sera raised to these peptides indicate that they all contain both B and T lymphocyte epitopes. Binding of the peptides to CD4-transfected HeLa cells reveals a hierarchy dependent on the number of relevant CD4 binding residues present. Furthermore, antibody cross-linking of peptides bound to the surface of human T cells results in apoptosis that is similar to the known properties of gp120. The peptide incorporating three CD4 binding residues competitively inhibited gp 120-induced T lymphocyte apoptosis. Thus, we have synthesized novel, branched peptides incorporating conserved discontinuous sequences from two different conserved domains of HIV-1 gp120 that contain T and B lymphocyte epitopes and mimic biological functions of the native protein. These synthetic peptides are candidates for future vaccine development."

https://openalex.org/W2055405403,"The strand joining step of recombination mediated by the Flp site-specific recombinase involves the attack of a 3′-phosphotyrosyl bond by a 5′-hydroxyl group from DNA. The nucleophile in this reaction, the 5′-OH, can be substituted by glycerol or other polyhydric alcohols. The strand joining and glycerolysis reactions are mechanistically equivalent and are competitive to each other. The target diester in strand joining can be a 3′-phosphate covalently linked either to a short tyrosyl peptide or to the whole Flp protein via Tyr-343. By contrast, only the latter type of 3′-phosphotyrosyl linkage is a substrate for glycerolysis. As a result, in activated DNA substrates (containing the scissile phosphate linked to a short Flp peptide), Flp(Y343F) can mediate the joining reaction utilizing the 5′-hydroxyl attack but fails to promote glycerolysis. Wild type Flp promotes both reactions in these substrates. The strand joining and glycerolysis reactions are absolutely dependent on the catalytic histidine at position 305 of Flp. Our results fit into a model in which a Flp dimer, with one monomer covalently attached to the 3′-phosphate, is essential for orienting the target diester or the nucleophile (or both) during glycerolysis. The requirement for this dimeric complex is relaxed in the strand joining reaction because of the ability of DNA to orient the nucleophile (5′-OH) by complementary base pairing. The experimental outcomes described here have parallels to the “cleavage-dependent ligation” carried out by a catalytic variant of Flp, Flp(R308K) (Zhu, X.-D., and Sadowski, P. D. (1995)J. Biol.

The experimental outcomes described here have parallels to the “cleavage-dependent ligation” carried out by a catalytic variant of Flp, Flp(R308K) (Zhu, X.-D., and Sadowski, P. D. (1995)J. Biol. Chem. 270, 23044–23054). The Flp site-specific recombinase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a member of the integrase family of recombinase proteins (2Landy A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 3Sadowski P.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 51: 53-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These proteins carry out recombination “conservatively,” i.e. without DNA degradation or synthesis, and in the absence of exogenous energy input. This “break-join” mechanism follows from the ability of integrase-type recombinases to carry out two types of transesterification reactions, first to break the parental DNA strand and then to form the recombinant strand. The cleavage and joining steps of recombination follow a basic topoisomerase I strategy. Strand cleavage is mediated by an active site tyrosine residue, Tyr-343 in Flp. As a result, a 3′-phosphotyrosine bond and a 5′-hydroxyl group are formed at either side of the nick. Strand joining in the recombinant mode is chemically a reversal of the cleavage step, except that the reaction occurs between the broken strands of two DNA partners. Several interesting features of the cleavage and joining steps of the Flp reaction have been revealed (4Chen J.W. Lee J. Jayaram M. Cell. 1992; 69: 647-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 5Chen J.W. Yang S.H. Jayaram M. J. Biol.

Juby C.D. Brousseau R. Sadowski P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3683-3689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The active Flp entity for strand cutting is a dimer (8Lee J. Whang I. Lee J. Jayaram M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5346-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 9Voziyanov Y. Lee J. Whang I. Lee J. Jayaram M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 720-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Within the dimer, one Flp monomer, bound adjacent to a scissile phosphodiester bond, orients it for attack by Tyr-343 of the second Flp monomer bound across the strand exchange region (or spacer). Thus, the target phosphate is oriented incis, while the cleavage nucleophile is donated intrans. The strand exchange reaction also follows the “cis-orientation/trans-nucleophilic attack” paradigm. In this case, the target phosphate belongs to the 3′-phosphotyrosine bridge, and the nucleophile is the 5′-hydroxyl group formed on the partner DNA. Once the target has been activated by Flp, a variety of exogenous nucleophiles can mimic the action of the native ones. Thus, strand breakage can be effected by tyramine, phenol, or hydrogen peroxide (6Lee J. Jayaram M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17564-17570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the 3′-phosphotyrosyl bond formed by Flp cleavage can be attacked by glycerol or polyhydric alcohols, by water (or the hydroxide ion), or even by a vicinyl 2′-hydroxyl group in a DNA-RNA hybrid substrate (10Knudsen B.R. Dahlstrøm K. Ole Westergaard Jayaram M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 11Xu C.J. Graine I. Lee J. Harshey R.M. Jayaram M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A simplified form of the recombination reaction (that involves the breakage and reformation of only one phosphodiester bond) can be performed using suitably designed “half-site” substrates (12Serre M.C. Evans B.R. Araki H. Oshima Y. Jayaram M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 621-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 13Qian X.-H. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7794-7805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These substrates were fashioned after the half-sites employed for the analysis of λ integrase-mediated recombination (14Nunes-Duby S.E. Matsumoto L. Landy A. Cell. 1987; 50: 779-788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Although reactions with half-sites may lack some of the geometric constraints and conformational attributes of the normal reaction, they have been remarkably useful in revealing the chemical and mechanistic aspects of Flp recombination (8Lee J. Whang I. Lee J. Jayaram M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5346-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Jayaram M. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. 8.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23203-23211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) The first step during the “half-site reaction,” as during normal recombination, is the covalent linkage between the cleaved strand and Flp via a 3′-phosphotyrosyl bond. The other product of cleavage is a short oligonucleotide (with a 5′-hydroxyl end) that cannot remain stably hydrogen-bonded to the uncleaved complementary strand. As a result, the 5′-hydroxyl group of the uncleaved strand can attack the phosphotyrosyl bond to form a hairpin product, thus releasing Tyr-343 from attachment to DNA. The reaction can be effectively stopped at the cleavage step if the 5′-hydroxyl is blocked by phosphorylation. Furthermore, an artificial (activated) half-site that mimics the cleaved intermediate by harboring a 3′-phosphate linked to tyrosine, tyramine, or a short tyrosyl peptide can undergo hairpin formation when provided with a Flp mutant lacking Tyr-343, namely Flp(Y343F) or Flp(Y343S) (6Lee J. Jayaram M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17564-17570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Pan G. Luetke K. Juby C.D. Brousseau R. Sadowski P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3683-3689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous analysis using half-sites, we established that the alcoholysis and the strand joining reactions of Flp share overall mechanistic similarity. The target diester is the same for both reactions, namely the 3′-O-phosphotyrosyl bond. The attacking nucleophiles, though, are different, glycerol in one case and a 5′-hydroxyl group in the other (10Knudsen B.R. Dahlstrøm K. Ole Westergaard Jayaram M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). While the former reaction links glycerol to the 3′-phosphate, the latter produces a ligated DNA strand. In addition to the pronounced similarities between the two reactions, we also observed a quite unexpected difference between them. Unlike the strand-joining reaction, alcoholysis does not occur within “activated” half-sites (with the normally reactive 3′-phosphate linked to a short tyrosyl peptide and not to full-length Flp) bound by Flp or Flp(Y343F). The reason for this difference is not clear. A plausible explanation is that a dimeric configuration of Flp, with perhaps one monomer covalently bound to DNA, is a prerequisite for positioning the polyhydric alcohol in its reactive orientation. During strand joining, on the other hand, the potential to orient the 5′-hydroxyl group by the base pairing ability of DNA may overcome the requirement for the Flp dimer. However, based on previous experiments, we cannot rule out the possibility that the observed differences between strand ligation and alcoholysis might merely be an artifact of the special configuration of a half-site substrate. In the experiments described in this report, we have examined the mechanism of the “strand transfer” step of recombination in “full site” substrates using glycerol and the 5′-hydroxyl group of DNA as alternative nucleophiles. The outcomes from these experiments suggest that the Flp recombinase active site adapts itself to different substrate contexts in order to perform mechanistically related chemical reactions. This conformational flexibility is consistent with the normal functional role of this enzyme, namely to perform two transesterification reactions utilizing two different phosphodiester targets and two distinct nucleophiles. Wild type Flp and the Flp variants were purified as described previously (17Prasad P.V. Young L.J. Jayaram M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84 (; Correction (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.85 1497): 2189-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The concentration of Flp or a Flp variant in a given preparation was estimated according to the procedure of Lee and Jayaram (16Lee J. Jayaram M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23203-23211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides for the construction of the substrates were synthesized in an Applied Biosystems model 380A DNA synthesizer using phosphoramidite chemistry (18Beaucage S.L. Caruthers M.H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1981; 22: 1859-1862Crossref Scopus (1719) Google Scholar) and purified as described by Christiansen et al. (19Christiansen K. Svejstrup B.D. Andersen A.H. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9690-9701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences of the individual DNA strands are listed in TableI. The half-site was obtained by annealing the two strands HT and HB (Table 1). In all of the full sites, two of the component oligonucleotides (TL and B) were common. The spacer differences were introduced via the third oligonucleotide (TR1-TR3). The relevant features of the full sites are described under Table I and diagrammed in Fig. 1 A. In addition, for clarity, the substrates used in each experimental set are schematically represented in the appropriate figures. The preparation of the “activated” forms of the half- and full-sites is described below.Table ISynthetic oligonucleotides for the assembly of half-site and full site substratesOligonucleotides for constructing the half-siteSequencesHT5′-aagcttgcGAAGTTCCTATACpttt-3′HB5′-tctagaaaGTATAGGAACTTCgca-3′Oligonucleotides for constructing the full sitesSequencesTL5′-gttgcgctctGAAGTTCCTATACpttt-3′B5′-gacgatcgctgagatagcGAAGTTCCTATTCptctagaaaGTATAGGAACTTCagagcgcaac-3′TR15′-tttctagaGAATAGGAACTTCgctatctcagcgatcgtc-3′TR25′-aatctagaGAATAGGAACTTCgctatctcagcgatcgtc-3′TR35′-ctagaGAATAGGAACTTCgctatctcagcgatcgtc-3′The sequences of the oligonucleotides used to construct the substrates used in this study are listed.

The scissile phosphodiester position is indicated by “p.” The half-site was assembled from HT (top strand) and HB (bottom strand). The three full sites were constructed from TL and B (top left and bottom strands) as the common oligonucleotides and TR (top right strand) as the variable oligonucleotide. For assembly of the half-site or the full sites, 10–20 pmol of each of the appropriate oligonucleotides were mixed in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), heated to 80 °C for 10 min, and cooled slowly to room temperature. The radiolabeled oligonucleotide was held at half the concentration of the unlabeled oligonucleotides in the hybridization mixture. Under the conditions employed, over 90% of the labeled strand was annealed to its complementary partner(s). Thus, the substrate concentration in a given reaction was practically the same as that of the input labeled strand. The activated substrates were obtained following the same general hybridization strategy described for the nonactivated substrates, except that the 3′-phosphate end of the labeled strand was linked to a short Flp peptide via Tyr-343. For this purpose, the labeled strand was prepared as follows. First, a half-site containing the 5′-end label in the cleavable strand and a 5′-phosphate block in the second strand was treated with Flp in repeated cycles to obtain ∼50% conversion into the cleaved product. After proteinase K digestion, phenol-chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation, the DNA was fractionated in a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (5% bisacrylamide) to separate the cleaved (peptide-linked) strand from the uncleaved strand. The desired band was excised from the gel, purified by standard protocols (10Knudsen B.R. Dahlstrøm K. Ole Westergaard Jayaram M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and used for substrate assembly by hybridization. The phosphorylation reaction was used either to label a given DNA strand with 32P or to prevent it from acting as a polynucleotidyl acceptor. The 5′-end of an oligonucleotide was labeled by incubation with T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP as the phosphoryl donor. For blocking the 5′-end, the oligonucleotide was phosphorylated by the kinase reaction in the presence of a molar excess of unlabeled ATP. The unreacted ATP was removed by spin dialysis on a G-50 column. Flp-mediated DNA joining or alcoholysis was investigated by reacting 0.025 to 0.05 pmol of the 5′-end labeled full sites with approximately 0.5 pmol of wild type Flp or Flp variants in a 200-μl reaction volume for 30 min at 30 °C. All reactions were performed in Flp reaction buffer containing 100 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10% polyethylene glycol, 80 mm NaCl, 10 mm β—mercaptoethanol, and 2 mm EDTA with or without added glycerol as indicated. The reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS (0.1% final concentration) and either ethanol-precipitated directly or treated with proteinase K (100 μg/reaction for 1 h at 37 °C) prior to ethanol precipitation, as stated. The DNA was fractionated by electrophoresis in 12% denaturing (5% bis-acrylamide) polyacrylamide gels, and the reaction products were visualized by autoradiography or by phosphor imaging. The activated half- or full sites, appropriately labeled at one 5′-end, were treated with wild type Flp or Flp(H305L) under the conditions described for the strand transfer assays (see above). The reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS, but treatment with proteinase K was omitted. Samples were run in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide (3% bisacrylamide) gels, and the protein-DNA complexes were identified by autoradiography or by phosphor imaging. Approximately 0.05 pmol of the labeled half-site with or without a preactivated 3′-DNA-peptide end was used per reaction. Incubations with Flp or Flp variants was carried out for 15 min at room temperature in 20 μl of Flp reaction mixture (see the strand transfer protocol described above). The samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (3% bisacrylamide), and the DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography (or phosphor imaging). The substrates used in this study mimic a normal Flp full site by containing two Flp binding elements placed in opposite orientations adjacent to the scissile phosphodiester bonds spaced 8 nucleotides apart on the top and bottom strands. However, they differ from the normal full site in that one of the two strands is discontinuous. This discontinuity was intentionally built into these substrates, so that they are comparable to those in which strand discontinuity is introduced as a result of cleavage by Flp (see below). Three full sites, FS1, FS2, and FS3, containing, respectively, a nick, two nucleotide mismatches, and a small gap (3 nucleotides) adjacent to the scissile phosphate (Fig.1 A) were tested in assays for Flp-mediated strand transfer or alcoholysis. Two different types of the full site substrates were employed. The first type (the nonactivated full sites) contained three nucleotides 3′ to the scissile phosphodiester bond adjacent to the “left” Flp binding element. They were capable of undergoing Flp-mediated strand cleavage, with the concomitant release of a trinucleotide segment (Fig. 1 A,left panel). In the second type, the full sites were already in their activated state by the attachment of a short Flp-derived tyrosyl peptide (indicated as YX) to the phosphate at the exchange point (Fig. 1 A, right panel). The ability of Flp or Flp variants to mediate phosphoryl transfer from these substrates to the 5′-OH end of an acceptor strand or to glycerol was assayed as schematically illustrated in the right part of Fig. 1 B for the full site containing a nick (FS1). For reference, the equivalent “nonactivated” substrates were assayed for strand transfer to DNA or to glycerol following cleavage by the full-length Flp as depicted in the left part of Fig. 1 B for FS1. Reactions with half-site and full site Flp substrates have shown that the strand joining step of recombination is sensitive to the homology of 2-3 base pairs at each end of the strand exchange region (or spacer) between recombination partners (20Lee J. Jayaram M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4042-4052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Zhu X.-D. Pan G. Luetke K. Sadowski P.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8731-8738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In accordance with the cis-activation/trans-nucleophilic attack model for Flp-mediated recombination (6Lee J. Jayaram M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17564-17570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these results have led to the proposal that base pairing serves to orient the DNA-nucleophile (5′-hydroxyl) for attack on its target diester (3′-phosphotyrosyl-Flp). Later analysis (10Knudsen B.R. Dahlstrøm K. Ole Westergaard Jayaram M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with half-sites has suggested that the Flp active site can also orient polyhydric alcohols to attack the 3′-phosphotyrosine bond in a reaction that is competitive with the 5′-hydroxyl attack. To further examine the mechanistic similarities between “strand joining” and alcoholysis, we first tested the role of complementary base pairing during strand joining in a set of activated full sites (FS1-FS3; Fig. 2). In the 5′-end-labeled strand of these substrates, the 3′-phosphate (corresponding to the normal cleavage point) was linked via Tyr-343 to a short proteolytic peptide derived from Flp. Strand joining was assayed by incubating the activated substrates with wild type Flp under standard conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Following termination of the reactions, samples were split into two and analyzed with (odd numbered lanes) or without (even numbered lanes) proteinase K digestion. The control in lane 1 was a reaction in which the substrate FS1 (shown over lanes 2and 3) was incubated in the absence of Flp and was treated with proteinase K prior to electrophoresis. Incubation of FS1 (containing a fully matched spacer) with Flp led to its efficient conversion into L (lanes 2 and 3), the expected 62-nucleotide recombinant strand resulting from transfer of the activated phosphate to the 5′-OH of the nicked spacer. The formation of L was prevented by phosphorylation of the 5′-spacer end of FS1 (lanes 4 and 5). Instead, a trace of a faster migrating product band (not labeled in Fig. 2) was observed. This minor product can be explained by phosphoryl transfer to the 5′-OH end exposed on the unlabeled bottom strand by Flp cleavage at the right end of the spacer (see Fig. 1). The adjacent mismatch in FS2 significantly impaired strand transfer (compare L in lanes 6and 7 to that in lanes 2 and3), whereas the adjacent gap in FS3 virtually eliminated strand transfer (lanes 8 and 9). These results are consistent with the critical role of complementary base pairing in facilitating the orientation and proximity of the 5′-hydroxyl for strand joining. The additional bands above and below the substrate band (S) in the proteolysed samples (odd numbered lanes) deserve comment. The faster moving S′ is the result of further protease digestion of the short Flp-derived oligopeptide covalently attached to the activated substrates. Note that S′ was formed by proteinase K treatment of FS1 even in the absence of prior incubation with Flp (lane 1). The collection of bands (Cl) above S (and therefore larger than S) indicate peptides linked to the labeled strand that could have arisen only from proteinase K action on the full-length Flp monomer. These results are consistent with previous observations that the phosphotyrosyl phosphodiester is a target for nucleophilic attack by Tyr-343 of Flp (1Zhu X.-D. Sadowski P.D. J. Biol.

Thus, formation of L in reactions with FS1 (lanes 2 and 3) can be accounted for by two modes of strand transfer: (i) by a single step reaction via the direct 5′-hydroxyl attack of the activated phosphate in FS1 (see also Fig. 3 B) or (ii) by a two-step reaction via the initial formation of the Flp-DNA covalent intermediate. The presence of proteolytic products larger thanS in reactions with full sites blocked or compromised in strand joining is supportive of the second mechanism. However, the first mechanism is also operational, as indicated by reactions with the cleavage minus variant, Flp(Y343F) (see below; Fig. 3). The lower yield of cleavage in the phosphorylated form of FS1 (lane 5) compared with FS2 (lane 7) or FS3 (lane 9) might result either from the presence of the adjacent phosphate group in FS1 or from the differences in the conformational flexibilities of these substrates. Our previous experiments on alcoholysis in half-sites (10Knudsen B.R. Dahlstrøm K. Ole Westergaard Jayaram M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) poses the following dilemma. If the alcoholysis and strand joining reactions are mechanistically equivalent and competitive, why does alcoholysis, in contrast to strand joining, not occur in an activated half-site (3′-phosphate covalently linked to a short Flp-derived tyrosyl peptide) treated with Flp or Flp(Y343F). From earlier binding studies, it is known that a normal half-site (in its nonactivated state) gives only a monomeric complex with Flp(Y343F) (one half-site to one protein monomer) but produces a dimeric complex with Flp (two half-sites to two protein monomers) (13Qian X.-H. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7794-7805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lee J. Jayaram M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23203-23211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The following questions are therefore relevant. Is a dimeric configuration of Flp essential when the nucleophile in the ligation step of recombination is glycerol or a polyhydric alcohol rather than the normal 5′-hydroxyl group? Within the dimeric configuration, is it also necessary for a whole Flp monomer to be covalently linked to DNA for alcoholysis to occur? And finally, does a normal half-site differ from its activated counterpart in its capacity to dimerize in the presence of wild type Flp? To address the above issues, we first assayed the ability of wild type Flp or Flp(Y343F) to mediate alcoholysis within activated full sites (Fig. 3, A and B). Since a monomer of Flp or Flp(Y343F) can bind to each of the two binding elements in these substrates, both proteins should be able to assemble dimers on them. However, only wild type Flp, and not Flp(Y343F), can form covalent attachment to DNA by cleavage of the phosphotyrosyl bond. In order to avoid competition with strand transfer to the 5′-hydroxyl of DNA, alcoholysis was assayed using substrates harboring 5′-phosphoryl ends adjacent to the activated phosphate (lanes 3–5,7–9, and 11–13 in Fig. 3, A andB). The phosphoryl acceptor in the alcoholysis assays was glycerol. As a control, strand ligation to 5′-hydroxyl spacer ends in the absence of added glycerol was also assayed (lanes 2, 6, and 10; Fig. 3, A andB). The reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis without protease treatment. This was done intentionally to avoid obfuscation of the alcoholysis product by those resulting from proteolysis. With increasing amounts of exogenously added glycerol (2.5 and 5m), wild type Flp yielded corresponding amounts of the product band marked A for all three substrates, FS1–FS3 (Fig. 3 A; lanes 4′, 5′,8, 9, 12, and 13; lanes 4′ and 5′ are longer exposures of lanes 4 and 5). The migration of A was consistent with that expected for the replacement of the tyrosyl peptide from the 3′-end of the labeled strand by glycerol (10Knudsen B.R. Dahlstrøm K. Ole Westergaard Jayaram M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The extent of strand transfer to the 5′-hydroxyl from these substrates (namely, the formation of L) agreed well with the results shown in Fig.2. FS1 was superior to FS2, and FS3 was inactive. In contrast to Flp, Flp(Y343F) failed to mediate alcoholysis within any of the activated full sites (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, and 13). However, Flp(Y343F) was as efficient as Flp in mediating strand ligation in FS1 and FS2 (Fig. 3 B,lanes 2 and 6; compare with Fig.3 A, lanes 2 and 6). The contrasting results with Flp and Flp(Y343F), in conjunction with the previous findings with half-sites (10Knudsen B.R. Dahlstrøm K. Ole Westergaard Jayaram M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), suggest that a dimer configuration of Flp is necessary, but not sufficient, for alcoholysis. They are consistent with the hypothesis that cleavage and concomitant attachment of the 3′-phosphate to Flp is a prerequisite for the alcoholysis reaction. It should be noted that, consistent with this interpretation, there was a good correlation between the observed alcoholysis within a full site (Fig. 3 A) and its apparent cleavability by Flp (see Fig. 2). For example, FS1 appeared to be poorly cleaved by Flp (note the levels of Cl in Fig. 2,lane 5) compared with FS2 (lane 7) and FS3 (lane 9) and yielded the least amount of the alcoholysis product (Fig. 3 A,lanes 4 and 5). It required twice as long an exposure of the autoradiogram shown in Fig. 3 A(left) for detection of the A bands in lanes 4′ and 5′ (right). Can the ability of Flp to mediate alcoholysis in a half-site but not in a preactivated half-site (10Knudsen B.R. Dahlstrøm K. Ole Westergaard Jayaram M. J. Mol."
