https://openalex.org/W1528606854,"Cellular copper metabolism and the mechanism of resistance to copper toxicity were investigated using a wild type hepatoma cell line (HAC) and a copper-resistant cell line (HAC600) that accumulates copper and has a highly elevated level of metallothionein (MT). Of the enzymes involved in reactive oxygen metabolism, only glutathionine peroxidase was elevated (3-4-fold) in resistant cells, suggestive of an increase in the cellular flux of hydrogen peroxide. A majority of the cytoplasmic copper (greater than 60%) was isolated from both cell lines as a GSH complex. Kinetic studies of 67Cu uptake showed that GSH bound 67Cu before the metal was complexed by MT. Depletion of cellular GSH with buthionine sulfoximine inhibited the incorporation of 67Cu into MT by greater than 50%. These results support a model of copper metabolism in which the metal is complexed by GSH soon after entering the cell. The complexed metal is then transferred to MT where it is stored. This study also indicates that resistance to metal toxicity in copper-resistant hepatoma cells is due to increases in both cellular GSH and MT. Furthermore, it is suggested that elevated levels of GSH peroxidase allows cells to more efficiently accommodate an increased cellular hydrogen peroxide flux that may occur as a consequence of elevated levels of cytoplasmic copper."
https://openalex.org/W1512705089,"A number of metal-catalyzed oxidation (MCO) systems mediate the oxidative inactivation of enzymes. This oxidation is accompanied by conversion of the side chains of some amino acid residues to carbonyl derivatives (for review, see Stadtman, E. R. (1986) Trends Biochem. Sci. 11, 11-12). To identify the amino acid residues which are sensitive to MCO oxidation, several enzymes/proteins and amino acid homopolymers were exposed to various MCO systems. The carbonyl groups which were formed were converted to their corresponding 3H-labeled hydroxy derivatives. After acid hydrolysis, the labeled free amino acids were separated by ion exchange chromatography. Each protein or polymer gave rise to several different labeled amino acids. The elution profiles of the labeled amino acids obtained from preparations of Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase which had been oxidized by MCO systems comprised of either Fe(II)/O2 or ascorbate/Fe(II)/O2 both in the presence and absence of EDTA were qualitatively the same. From a comparison of the elution profiles of labeled amino acids from various proteins with those obtained from homopolymers, it is evident that the side chains of histidine, arginine, lysine, and proline are particularly sensitive to oxidation by the MCO systems. This conclusion is supported also by direct amino acid analysis of acid hydrolysates which shows that the oxidation of glutamine synthetase, enolase, and phosphoglycerate kinase is associated with the loss of at least 1 histidine residue per subunit. From the results of studies with homopolymers, it is apparent that glutamic semialdehyde is a major product of both proline and arginine residues. In addition, hydroxyproline and unlabeled glutamic acid were identified among the hydrolysis products of oxidized poly-L-proline, and unlabeled aspartic acid was identified as a product of poly-L-histidine oxidation."

https://openalex.org/W2061918336,"The nitrogen regulatory (NtrC) protein of enteric bacteria, which binds to sites that have the properties of transcriptional enhancers, is known to activate transcription by a form of RNA polymerase that contains the NtrA protein (sigma 54) as sigma factor (referred to as sigma 54-holoenzyme). In the presence of adenosine triphosphate, the NtrC protein catalyzes isomerization of closed recognition complexes between sigma 54-holoenzyme and the glnA promoter to open complexes in which DNA in the region of the transcription start site is locally denatured. NtrC is not required subsequently for maintenance of open complexes or initiation of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2138430171,The cyclins are a family of proteins encoded by maternal mRNA. Cyclin polypeptides accumulate during interphase and are destroyed during mitosis at about the time of entry into anaphase. We show here that Xenopus oocytes contain mRNAs encoding two cyclins that are major translation products in a cell-free extract from activated eggs. Cutting these mRNAs with antisense oligonucleotides and endogenous RNAase H blocks entry into mitosis in a cell-free egg extract. The extracts can enter mitosis if either of the cyclin mRNAs is left intact. We conclude that the synthesis of these cyclins is necessary for mitotic cell cycles in cleaving Xenopus embryos.
https://openalex.org/W2001536227,"Cyclin proteins are thought to trigger entry into mitosis. During mitosis they are rapidly degraded. Therefore, mitosis and consequently cyclin degradation might be triggered at a time when cyclins have reaccumulated to a critical level. We cloned and sequenced a Drosophila cyclin A homolog and identified mutations in the corresponding gene. Immunofluorescent staining revealed that cyclin A accumulates in the interphase cytoplasm of cellularized embryos, but relocates to the nuclear region early in prophase and is completely degraded within metaphase. Cyclin A was expressed in dividing cells throughout development, and a functional cyclin A gene was required for continued division after exhaustion of maternally contributed cyclin A. Importantly, the timing of post cellularization divisions was not governed by the rate of accumulation or level of cyclin A."
https://openalex.org/W2072606138,"We have localized a set of T cell-specific DNAase I hypersensitive sites in the 3'-flanking region of the human CD2 gene. A 5.5 kb BamHI-XbaI fragment containing these DNAase I hypersensitive sites conferred efficient, copy number-dependent, T cell-specific expression of a linked human CD2 minigene, independent of the position of integration in the transgenic mouse genome. When linked to the mouse Thy-1.1 gene or the human beta-globin gene, this fragment conferred the same T cell-specific expression, independent of its orientation. These results suggest that this flanking region is both necessary and sufficient for full tissue-specific activation of homologous and heterologous genes in transgenic mice."

https://openalex.org/W2100349230,"We have used a transient expression assay employing Drosophila tissue culture cells to study the potential of several Drosophila homeobox proteins to function as transcriptional regulators. A 96 bp fragment from the promoter region of the segment polarity gene engrailed, previously shown to contain five copies of a 10 bp consensus binding site for these proteins, enhanced transcription in the presence, but not the absence, of several different homeobox protein expression vectors. It is interesting that cotransfection with combinations of expression vectors encoding the homeobox proteins fushi tarazu, paired, and/or zen resulted in substantial synergistic increases in expression. In contrast, the products of the even-skipped and engrailed genes were found to repress, or quench, the activation induced by the other proteins. We discuss the implications of these results with respect to the role of homeobox genes in the control of embryonic development, and propose a ""multi-switch"" model whereby the activity of a target gene depends on the interactions of different homeobox proteins with multiple copies of a common binding site."

https://openalex.org/W2065784037,"To survive, primates must detect danger in time to activate appropriate defensive behaviors. In this study, the defensive behaviors of infant rhesus monkeys exposed to humans were characterized. It was observed that the direction of the human's gaze is a potent cue for the infant. Infants separated from their mothers were active and emitted frequent distress vocalizations. When a human entered the room but did not look at the infant, it became silent and froze in one position. If the human stared at the infant, it responded with aggressive barking. Alterations of the opiate system affected the frequency of the infant's distress calls without affecting barking and freezing, whereas benzodiazepine administration selectively reduced barking and freezing. This suggests that opiate and benzodiazepine systems regulate specific defensive behaviors in primates and that these systems work together to mediate behavioral responses important for survival."
https://openalex.org/W2148902400,"The cDNA for human elongation factor-1 alpha was isolated from a cDNA library of human fibroblast cells. Using the cDNA as a probe, a number of chromosomal genes encoding the human elongation factor-1 alpha were isolated. Characterization of the clones by restriction enzyme mapping and nucleotide sequence analysis has revealed that only one of them is an active gene, whereas all of the other genes are processed pseudogenes. The active gene consists of 8 exons and 7 introns spanning about 3.5 kilobases, and the sequence of its exons is completely identical to that of the human elongation factor-1 alpha cDNA. The first non-coding exon of 33 base pairs is separated by a 943-base pair intron from the coding exons. The primer extension of human elongation factor-1 alpha mRNA has indicated that the transcription of human elongation factor-1 alpha gene starts from a C residue, and a TATA box was found 24 base pairs upstream of the initiation site. Three and five Sp1 binding sites are present on the 5'-flanking region and the 1st intron, respectively. Furthermore, one Ap-1 binding site is located in the 1st intron. By using nuclear extracts from HeLa cells, the promoter of human elongation factor-1 alpha gene could stimulate in vitro transcription better than the adenovirus major late promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1977514490,"Although the functional aspects of the alpha beta T cell antigen receptor (TCR) found on most peripheral T cells are well described, the function of the gamma delta TCR remains unclear. Murine intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) of the small intestine are CD8+, express the gamma delta TCR, and are constitutively lytic. Fresh IEL from germ-free mice had no lytic activity. Moreover, whereas IEL from normal mice are 30 to 50 percent Thy-1+, IEL from germ-free did not express Thy-1. Acclimation of germ-free mice to nonsterile conditions resulted in the generation of Thy-1+ IEL and induction of lytic activity. Thus CD8+ TCR-gamma delta IEL were regulated by externally derived stimuli via a specific functional interaction between IEL and gut-associated antigens."

https://openalex.org/W2109975077,"The Xenopus homeobox gene Xhox3 shows a graded expression in the axial mesoderm, with the highest concentration in the posterior end of frog gastrula and neurula embryos. To investigate the function of the Xhox3 gene, synthetic Xhox3 mRNA was injected into different regions of developing embryos. In particular, Xhox3 was supplied in excess to anterior cells, which normally have the lowest levels of Xhox3 RNA. The results show that injection of Xhox3, but not control, mRNA into prospective anterior regions of developing embryos produces a series of graded axial defects. The injected embryos gastrulate normally but fail to form anterior (head) structures. Our findings suggest that Xhox3 is involved in establishing anterior-posterior cell identities during pattern formation of the axial mesoderm in early embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W1569697157,"Abstract Two forms of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP) were purified from rat liver plasma membranes: a membrane form (mDPP) extracted with Triton X-100 and a soluble form (sDPP) prepared by treatment with papain. Apparent molecular masses of mDPP and sDPP were 109 and 105 kDa, respectively, when determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The NH2-terminal sequences of the two forms were found to be completely different from each other. For further information on the molecular structure, we constructed a lambda gt11 liver cDNA library and isolated two cDNA clones for DPP, lambda cDP37 and lambda cD5. The 3.5-kilobase cDNA insert of lambda cDP37 contains an open reading frame that encodes a 767-residue polypeptide with a calculated size of 88,107 Da, which is in reasonable agreement with that of DPP (87 kDa) immunoprecipitated from cell-free translation products. Eight potential N-linked glycosylation sites were found in the molecule, accounting for the difference in mass between the precursor and mature forms. Of particular interest is that the deduced NH2-terminal sequence with a characteristic signal peptide is completely identical to that determined for mDPP. In addition, the NH2-terminal sequence of sDPP is identified in the predicted sequence starting at the 35th position from the NH2 terminus. These results indicate that the signal peptide of DPP is not cleaved off during biosynthesis but functions as the membrane-anchoring domain even in the mature form. It is also found that the primary structure thus predicted has striking homology to that of gp 110, a bile canaliculus domain-specific membrane glycoprotein (Hong, W., and Doyle, D. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 7962-7966)."
https://openalex.org/W2006683789,"SEVERAL mouse gene families related to Drosophila developmental control genes and containing a homoeobox, a paired box or a finger domain, have been cloned and structurally analysed. On the basis of structural similarities to the Drosophila genes and of their spatially and temporally restricted expression patterns during mouse embryogenesis, it has been proposed that these mammalian genes also are involved in the control of develop-ment1–4. To elucidate the function of homoeobox genes by genetic means, mouse mutants must be generated. We have developed a technique for mutagenesis in vivo and have used it to mutate the homoeobox Hox 1.1 gene. In vivo mutagenesis was achieved through homologous recombination between an endogenous Hox 1.1 allele and a microinjected mutated gene in pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells5–9. Mutant cells were identified by means of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 10 and mutant clones were used to generate chimaeric mice. Because the homologous recombi-nation event is formally a gene conversion event and no selection is required to screen for cells carrying the mutated allele, in vivo mutagenesis allows specific alterations in the target sequence to be made without the introduction of any other sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2050539735,"Clonal cultures and monoclonal antibodies against a lineage-specific epitope, stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 (SSEA-1) were used to analyze the commitment of quail neural crest cells to the sensory neuron pathway. There were two distinct populations of sensory cells at the time of gangliogenesis. Postmitotic neuroblasts that remained in close association with the neural tube coexisted with a large number of pluripotent cells that formed the leading edge of the emigrating cells and gave rise to sensory and autonomic neuroblasts and to melanocytes. The data suggest a dual origin of spinal sensory neuroblasts and a predominantly late divergence of the autonomic and sensory lineages."
https://openalex.org/W1527517879,"Abstract A large form of DNA polymerase delta from HeLa cells was recently purified in this laboratory as a factor required for conservative DNA synthesis in a reconstituted system utilizing UV-irradiated permeabilized human diploid fibroblasts (Nishida, C., Reinhard, P., and Linn, S. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 501-510). We have now purified this form of the enzyme utilizing its polymerase activity and further characterized it. The enzyme activity sediments at 11.1 S in low salt and 6.8 S in high salt. In both cases, activity cosediments with the major visible peptide displayed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels which has an Mr of 215,000. This value is consistent with the molecular mass calculated from the sedimentation coefficient and gel filtration behavior in high salt. In low salt the apparent molecular mass was approximately double. The enzyme prefers poly(dA).oligo(dT) as template/primer in low salt, with which it has a processivity of several thousand nucleotides in 1 mM MgCl2. At isotonic KCl or potassium phosphate concentrations, the preferred template/primer is activated DNA. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen, also characterized as a DNA polymerase delta auxiliary protein, does not increase the activity of this preparation of the enzyme. An antibody to the proliferating cell nuclear antigen has no inhibitory effect, nor is it able to recognize any peptides in immunoblots of purified enzyme fractions. Under polymerizing conditions, the enzyme removes mismatched, but not matched nucleotides from the 3' terminus of oligo(dT) annealed to poly(dA) suggesting a proofreading function. The properties of this form of DNA polymerase delta distinguish it from other preparations reported in the literature."
https://openalex.org/W2115017825,"Cnidocytes, the stinging cells of cnidarians, discharge nematocysts in response to physical contact accompanied by the stimulation of specific chemoreceptors. Cnidocytes in fishing tentacles of a sea anemone are now found to discharge nematocysts preferentially into targets vibrating at 30, 55, and 65 to 75 hertz. Moreover, in the presence of submicromolar concentrations of known chemosensitizers, such as N-acetylated sugars and mucin, these optima shift to 5, 15, 30, and 40 hertz, frequencies that correspond to the movements of swimming prey. Hence, chemoreceptors for these substances tune cnidocyte mechanoreceptors to frequencies that match the movements of the prey."

https://openalex.org/W2049840014,"Pituitary-specific expression of the growth hormone (GH) gene is governed by a transcription factor, GHF-1, that binds to two sites within its promoter. Recently, GHF-1 was shown to be a member of the homeobox family of DNA-binding proteins. An important question is whether GHF-1 controls the expression of other pituitary specific genes, such as prolactin (Prl), expressed in closely related cell types. To this end, GHF-1 was purified from extracts of GH- and Prl-expressing pituitary tumor cells and identified as a 33-kilodalton polypeptide. Although GHF-1 bound to and activated the GH promoter, it did not recognize the Prl promoter. However, at least one other factor in the same extracts, which was easily separated from GHF-1, bound to several sites within the Prl but not the GH promoter. Antibodies to GHF-1 did not react with the Prl binding activity. These results imply that the pituitary-specific expression of GH and Prl is governed by two distinct trans-acting factors."
https://openalex.org/W2083197112,"Rat preprosomatostatin (rPPSS) is processed to two bioactive peptides, somatostatin-14 and somatostatin-28. In anglerfish islets, the two peptides are synthesized by distinct cell types and are derived from different precursors, anglerfish preprosomatostatin-1 (a(I)PPSS) and anglerfish preprosomatostatin-2 (a(II)PPSS). To determine the basis of the differential processing, we introduced a(I)PPSS or a(II)PPSS expression vectors into mammalian endocrine cell lines that can accomplish both patterns of processing. Both precursors were processed identically, indicating that cellular factors must determine the processing pattern. Although similar processing sites are present in both precursors, high levels of unprocessed anglerfish prosomatostatin-2 were secreted constitutively from the transfected cells. A hybrid protein containing the leader sequence and a portion of the pro-region of rPPSS fused to the carboxy-terminal third of a(II)PPSS was processed and secreted via a regulated pathway. We conclude that the amino-terminal 78 residues of rPPSS contain sufficient information to correct the targeting deficiency of a(II)PPSS in mammalian endocrine cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W1578564117,"The human C3d/Epstein-Barr virus receptor (CR2/CD21) is a 145-kDa protein primarily expressed on mature B lymphocytes. CR2 is a member of the regulators of complement activation (RCA) gene family found on band q32 of chromosome 1. The RCA proteins are characterized by the presence of 60-70 amino acid short consensus repeats (SCR). A full length CR2 cDNA was cloned and used to identify overlapping cosmid genomic clones. Analysis of CR2 exon-intron junctions revealed the presence of three types of exons in the short consensus repeat region of CR2. First, four exons each of which encodes two SCR are present. Five exons encode a single SCR. Six exons encode SCRs which are split in identical positions. The order of these types of exons is in a repeated array of four SCRs, indicating that the contemporary CR2 gene likely evolved from a more primitive gene containing four SCRs. The CR2 full length cDNA clone was used to find restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). Restriction enzyme TaqI generated 2.55- and 2.10-kilobase (kb) polymorphic bands. This RFLP was mapped near the exon containing the first two SCRs. HaeIII digestion generated polymorphic bands of 1.45, 1.55, and 1.75 kb. The HaeIII 1.45-kb RFLP band maps near the exon containing the 15th SCR. The TaqI and HaeIII RFLPs will provide tools for the genetic analysis of CR2. The organization of the CR2 gene provides insights into the evolution of human CR2 and the RCA gene family."
https://openalex.org/W1499502752,"Abstract Human erythroleukemia cells are a model system for studies of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors and their coupling to inhibition of adenylate cyclase (McKernan, R. M., Howard, M. J., Motulsky, H. J., and Insel, P. A. (1987) Mol. Pharmacol. 32, 258-265). Using Fura-2, we show that alpha 2-adrenergic receptor stimulation also increases intracellular Ca2+ in these cells by 80-250 nM. Although epinephrine only inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP generation when beta-adrenergic receptors were blocked, the Ca2+ increase was not affected by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. The Ca2+ increase was not affected by forskolin or 8-bromo-cAMP. Thus, alpha 2-adrenergic receptors independently couple to elevation of intracellular Ca2+ and adenylate cyclase inhibition. Chelating all extracellular Ca2+ did not reduce the response, demonstrating mobilization of intracellular, rather than influx of extracellular Ca2+. The epinephrine-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization occurred prior to any detectable increase in inositol-(1,4,5)-trisphosphate. It was abolished by pretreatment with pertussis toxin (which blocks some G protein-mediated processes), but not by aspirin and indomethacin (which inhibit cyclooxygenase), nordihydroguaiaretic acid (which inhibits lipoxygenase), or Na+-free buffer (to block any Na+H+ exchange). We conclude, therefore, that alpha 2-adrenergic receptors on human erythroleukemia cells couple to mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ via a (pertussis toxin-sensitive) G protein-mediated mechanism that is independent of inhibition of adenylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1917787915,"Abstract We report here a study of the developmental and genetic control of tissue-specific expression of lipoprotein lipase, the enzyme responsible for hydrolysis of triglycerides in chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mRNA is present in a wide variety of adult rat and mouse tissues examined, albeit at very different levels. A remarkable increase in the levels of LPL mRNA occurs in heart over a period of several weeks following birth, closely paralleling developmental changes in lipase activity and myocardial beta-oxidation capacity. Large increases in LPL mRNA also occur during differentiation of 3T3L1 cells to adipocytes. As previously reported, at least two separate genetic loci control the tissue-specific expression of LPL activity in mice. One of the loci, controlling LPL activity in heart, is associated with an alteration in LPL mRNA size, while the other, controlling LPL activity in adipose tissue, appears to affect the translation or post-translational expression of LPL. To examine whether these genetic variations are due to mutations of the LPL structural locus, we mapped the LPL gene to a region of mouse chromosome 8 using restriction fragment-length polymorphisms and analysis of hamster-mouse somatic cell hybrids. This region is homologous to the region of human chromosome 8 which contains the human LPL gene as judged by the conservation of linked genetic markers. Genetic variations affecting LPL expression in heart cosegregated with the LPL gene, while variations affecting LPL expression in adipose tissue did not. Furthermore, Southern blotting analysis indicates that LPL is encoded by a single gene and, thus, the genetic differences are not a consequence of independent regulation of two separate genes in the two tissues. These results suggest the existence of cis-acting elements for LPL gene expression that operate in heart but not adipose tissue. Our results also indicate that two genetic mutations resulting in deficiencies of LPL in mice, the W mutation on chromosome 5 and the cld mutation on mouse chromosome 17, do not involve the LPL structural gene locus. Finally, we show that the gene for hepatic lipase, a member of a gene family with LPL, is unlinked to the gene for LPL. This indicates that combined deficiencies of LPL and hepatic lipase, observed in humans as well as in certain mutant strains of mice, do not result from focal disruptions of a cluster of lipase genes."

https://openalex.org/W1509000658,C 1 ¯ inhibitor plays an important role in the regulation of vascular permeability through its ability to inactivate enzymes which release polypeptide kinins. Dysfunctional C 1 ¯ inhibitor molecules are present in the plasma of affected members of the Da and Ri hereditary angioneurotic edema kindreds. We constructed genomic libraries from Da and Ri patient DNAs which had been cleaved with BclI to generate a fragment containing 21 kilobases of the C 1 ¯ inhibitor locus. C 1 ¯ inhibitor gene-containing recombinants originating from mutant Da and Ri alleles were differentiated from those derived from normal alleles by linkage analysis using the intragenic HgiAI restriction fragment length polymorphism. Nucleotide sequencing of the complete protein-coding regions of the mutant alleles identified two different mutations in a CpG dinucleotide corresponding to the first two bases of arginine codon 444. These single base mutations changed the identity of the functionally critical P1 reactive site residue from arginine to cysteine (Da) or histidine (Ri). The additional cysteine residue in C 1 ¯ inhibitor Da suggests how it is covalently bound to albumin in plasma. The presence of CpG dinucleotides in the codons specifying the P1 arginines of C 1 ¯ inhibitor and antithrombin III explains the high incidence of histidine and cysteine substitutions observed among dysfunctional mutants of these serine protease inhibitors.
https://openalex.org/W1584768422,"Tissue-cultured muscle cells synthesize several oligomeric forms of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) destined for the cell surface or secretion. Previous studies on the biogenesis of AChE polypeptide chains have shown that only a small fraction become assembled into catalytically active oligomers which transit the Golgi apparatus and acquire endoglycosidase H (endo H) resistance. Most of the AChE polypeptides remain endo H-sensitive and are rapidly degraded intracellularly. We now show that all newly synthesized AChE polypeptides are transported from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus where they acquire N-acetylglucosamine. However, approximately 80% of these AChE polypeptides remain endo H-sensitive and are degraded intracellularly with a half-life of about 1.5 h by a mechanism which is insensitive to lysosomotropic agents. These endo H-sensitive AChE molecules can be chased into clathrin-coated vesicles and/or the sarcoplasmic reticulum prior to degradation. Pulse-chase studies of isotopically labeled or catalytically active AChE molecules suggest that there are at least two discreet populations of clathrin-coated vesicles which leave the Golgi, one whose origin is cis/medial and one whose origin is trans. These studies indicate the existence of a post-rough endoplasmic reticulum, non-lysosomal degradative pathway for intra-luminal proteins and suggest that post-translational events at the levels of protein sorting and degradation may play a role in regulating the abundance of exportable proteins."

Accordingly, we attempted to purify it from acetic acid extracts of bovine brain tissue by gel filtration chromatography and several different high performance liquid chromatographic systems. Peptide content was followed by a specific and sensitive radioimmunoassay with an antibody that was generated against synthetic Tyr-MIF-1. In each of the five applied high performance liquid chromatographic systems, the immunoreactive fractions coincided exactly with the elution time of synthetic Tyr-MIF-1 in the control runnings. The structure of the isolated peptide was identified by microsequence analysis as the tetrapeptide Tyr-Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2 and shown to be biologically active."
https://openalex.org/W1597268103,"We have examined the possible role of clathrin-coated vesicles (CVs) in the genesis of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in developing chick skeletal myotubes. Calsequestrin (CSQ) a luminal Ca2+ binding protein of the terminal SR cisternae, is contained within the vesicle lumen of skeletal muscle CVs in substantial amounts, approximately four molecules/CV. Employing 3-day cultures of chick skeletal myotubes we demonstrate that after a 30-min labeling with [35S]methionine and cysteine, radioactivity in CSQ remains high in the CVs 45 min later and then declines, while labeled CSQ in the SR continues to rise. No CSQ appears to be secreted. All of the CSQ in both the CVs and SR is sensitive to the activity of endoglycosidase H, and a significant fraction also binds to wheat germ agglutinin. Based on these results, we discuss the hypothesis that a selective CV-mediated pathway exists in developing skeletal muscle cells for the transport of CSQ from the early/intermediate Golgi apparatus to the SR."
https://openalex.org/W2146810924,"Abstract We have characterized a magnesium-dependent guanylate cyclase in homogenates of Dictyostelium discoideum cells. 1) The enzyme shows an up to 4-fold higher cGMP synthesis in the presence of GTP analogues with half-maximal activation at about 1 microM guanosine 5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) or 100 microM guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate; little or no stimulation was observed with GTP, guanosine mono- and diphosphates or with adenine nucleotides, with the exception of the ATP analogue adenosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate. 2) Both basal and GTP gamma S-stimulated guanylate cyclase activity were rapidly lost from homogenates as was the ability of GTP gamma S to stimulate the enzyme after cell lysis. 3) Inclusion of 25 microM GTP gamma S during cell lysis reduced the KM for GTP from 340 to 85 microM and increased the Vmax from 120 to 255 pmol/min.mg protein, as assayed in homogenates 90 s after cell lysis. 4) Besides acting as an activator, GTP gamma S was also a substrate for the enzyme with a KM = 120 microM and a Vmax = 115 pmol/min.mg protein. 5) GTP gamma S-stimulated, Mg2+-dependent guanylate cyclase was inhibited by submicromolar concentrations of Ca2+ ions, and by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in the absence of Ca2+ chelators. 6) Guanylate cyclase activity was detected in both supernatant and pellet fractions after 1 min centrifugation at 10,000 x g; however, only sedimentable enzyme was stimulated by GTP gamma S. We suggest that the Mg2+-dependent guanylate cyclase identified represents the enzyme that in intact cells is regulated via cell surface receptors, and we propose that guanine nucleotides are allosteric activators of this enzyme and that Ca2+ ions play a role in the maintenance of the enzyme in its basal state."
https://openalex.org/W1650693492,"Abstract Crystallographic studies have previously suggested that Lys290 forms a salt bridge with Glu342 in the serine protease inhibitor alpha 1-antitrypsin. Disruption of the formation of this structural feature by a Glu to Lys substitution at residue 342 in the PiZ variant has been implicated in causing the defective secretion of this mutant protein from hepatocytes (10-15% of normal). To test the validity of this hypothesis, mutant human alpha 1-antitrypsin cDNA constructs coding for specific amino acid substitutions at residues 290 and 342 were generated and the corresponding mutant proteins were expressed in mouse hepatoma cells. When the potential to form the salt bridge was reestablished by a Lys290 to Glu290 substitution in the PiZ variant, its secretion was increased to only 38% of normal. Furthermore, disruption of this structural feature by a Lys290 to Glu290 substitution in the normal inhibitor failed to reduce the secretion of alpha 1-antitrypsin to the extent observed for the PiZ variant (73% of normal). Finally, substitution of the neutral amino acid Gln at residue 342 only reduced the secretion of alpha 1-antitrypsin to 55% of normal. Of all mutant proteins tested, those bearing Lys at position 342 were secreted at the lowest levels. These findings demonstrate that although disruption of the 290-342 salt bridge does affect the secretion of alpha 1-antitrypsin, it is the substitution of Lys at residue 342 that causes the dramatic secretory defect of the PiZ variant."
https://openalex.org/W1537290167,"Clathrin-coated vesicle acidification is mediated by an N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive, vanadate-resistant proton-translocating ATPase. This enzyme is a 530-kDa hetero-oligomer which catalyzes ATP-dependent proton pumping when reconstituted (Xie, X. S., and Stone, D. K. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 2492-2495). We now report the purification of a second ATPase from bovine brain clathrin-coated vesicles which is inhibited by both N-ethylmaleimide (1 mM) and vanadate (10 microM). Localization of the ATPase to clathrin-coated vesicles was demonstrated by the precipitation of ouabain-resistant, vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity with anti-clathrin antibodies. The enzyme was solubilized with 0.1% polyoxyethylene 9-lauryl ether and has been purified 700-fold to a specific activity of 42 mumol of Pi.mg of protein-1.min-1. A molecular mass of 116 kDa was determined by centrifugation in sucrose gradients prepared in H2O and D2O, by high performance liquid chromatography using gel filtration, and by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis performed under reducing conditions. The ATPase is unlike any known mammalian E1E2-type ATPase in that it is not inhibited by ouabain or [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and it is not activated by Na+, K+, or Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1517640070,"Abstract We have examined the epidermal growth factor (EGF) dependence of the transcription of different proto-oncogenes, using cultured human mammary carcinoma MDA-468 cells and a nuclear run-on transcription assay. We found that the stimulation of MDA-468 cells with EGF regulates moderately and to different extents the transcription of the EGF-receptor(R) and c-erbB-2 proto-oncogenes. In contrast, the transcription of other proto-oncogenes, including c-myc, c-H-ras, and c-fps, was unchanged. Furthermore, we provide evidence that transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) selectively and to different degrees modulates the EGF-dependent transcription of EGF-R and c-erbB-2 genes. In this study, we also discovered that T3 (triiodothyronine) exerts synergistic control on the action of EGF alone or in association with TGF-beta 1, on EGF-R and c-erbB-2 gene transcription. Moreover, we established that within 6 h after the addition of EGF, cytoplasmic EGF-R mRNA levels are increased several-fold and that this accumulation is enhanced by the presence of TGF-beta 1 and/or T3. The results described here are consistent with the hypothesis that a complex program of cooperative interactions among EGF-, TGF-beta 1-, and T3-generated signals at the transcriptional level may mediate, at least in part, the combined actions of EGF, TGF-beta 1, and T3 in target cells."
https://openalex.org/W1619978162,"Abstract Human asparagine synthetase was expressed in Escherichia coli. Synthesis of the enzyme was demonstrated by immunoblotting and by complementation of asparagine auxotrophy in E. coli. The recombinant enzyme was shown to have both the ammonia- and glutamine-dependent asparagine synthetase activity in vitro. Compared to asparagine synthetase isolated from beef pancreas, the one expressed in E. coli migrated at a slightly slower rate on a denaturing protein gel. In contrast with previous reports, the data obtained here strongly suggest that the active enzyme is a homodimer. The production of soluble and active enzyme was shown to be highly temperature-dependent. Expression at 37 degrees C yielded no soluble enzyme, whereas growth at 30 and 21 degrees C favored the production of soluble asparagine synthetase. The incubation temperature was also important for complementation of asparagine auxotrophy in E. coli, as growth in the absence of asparagine occurred at 30 degrees C and not at 37 degrees C."

https://openalex.org/W2023366884,"Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations correlate with risk of coronary heart disease, and genetic variation affecting LDL levels influences atherosclerosis susceptibility. The principal LDL protein is apolipoprotein B (apoB); apoB is not exchangeable between lipoprotein particles and there is only one apoB per LDL particle. Plasma LDL therefore consists of two populations, one containing apoB derived from the maternal and one from the paternal apoB alleles. Products of the apob gene with high or low affinity for the MB-19 monoclonal antibody can be distinguished, and this antibody was used to identify heterozygotes with allele-specific differences in the amount of apoB in their plasma. A family study confirmed that the unequal expression phenotype was inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and was linked to the apob gene locus. Significant apoB genetic variation affecting plasma LDL levels may be more common than previously appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W1546711431,"Abstract A 43-kDa DNA binding protein which recognizes the TGACGTCA element of the rat somatostatin promoter has been purified from rat brain. Purification of the protein involved initial separation of three sequence-specific binding activities, b1-b3, from each other using DEAE-Sepharose chromatography. The protein corresponding to the b2 complex was further purified to apparent homogeneity by two cycles of sequence-specific DNA affinity chromatography, yielding a single species with an apparent mass of 43,000 daltons on a silver-stained polyacrylamide gel. Sequence-specific DNA binding of this purified protein was demonstrated by Southwestern blotting, renaturation, and DNase I footprinting studies. The 43-kDa protein was phosphorylated on serine residue(s) by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, as shown by phosphoamino acid analysis. Furthermore, the purified protein specifically stimulated transcription from the rat somatostatin promoter in an in vitro transcription system. These results indicate that this 43-kDa protein is a transcription factor required for somatostatin gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1483472816,"Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells exhibit increased sensitivity to a wide variety of microtubule inhibitory drugs when verapamil is present in the growth medium. The extent of this increased sensitivity is drug specific: some drugs such as taxol and vinblastine respond greatly to the presence of verapamil, whereas other drugs such as griseofulvin respond very poorly. For the majority of drugs examined, however, a 2- to 10-fold increase in drug sensitivity is observed in the presence of verapamil at 5 micrograms/ml. The effects of verapamil are even more dramatic when drug-resistant mutant cells with a presumed alteration in membrane permeability are examined. In the presence of appropriate levels of verapamil, these mutants demonstrate a level of drug sensitivity comparable to that of the wild-type parental cells. Drug-resistant cells from similar selections but with well-defined alterations in alpha- or beta-tubulin and no evidence of alterations in membrane permeability, however, continue to exhibit increased resistance to the selecting drug even in the presence of verapamil. These studies support the conclusion that verapamil affects the membrane permeability to or transport of a wide variety of hydrophobic drugs. In addition, we have used this information to devise selections that virtually eliminate the isolation of drug-resistant permeability mutants. This methodology should be generally applicable to genetic studies of drug action that are complicated by the isolation of large numbers of mutants with permeability alterations."
https://openalex.org/W1576359843,"Abstract By the use of the drug taxol, microtubules were assembled from tubulin that had GDP at its exchangeable nucleotide binding site. By means of dilution experiments and measurements of exchange of labeled subunits, it was determined that the rate of interchange of subunits between these microtubules and the solution is very slow: the upper limit of the dissociation rate constant was measured to be 0.2 subunit s-1 end-1. When they were broken into short pieces by gentle shearing, these microtubules were found to undergo a rapid subsequent spontaneous increase in length. This increase was attributed to end-to-end joining (also called annealing), because dynamic instability and other mechanisms involving either nucleotide hydrolysis or subunit interchange at the ends could be ruled out. To characterize the process, a diffusion-controlled joining mechanism was hypothesized, and a length-independent bimolecular rate constant, gamma, was defined. Length distributions were measured at a series of times after the initial shearing. By means of a novel iterative calculation, the best-fitting value of gamma was determined from the time-dependent changes in the length distributions. Fitting was carried out at each of three concentrations of microtubules. The resulting values show that end-to-end joining of microtubules is remarkably efficient and that gamma is concentration-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2038158053,"An established rat thymic cell line secretes a peptide in the 11 kd range called thymotaxin that attracts a small subset of juvenile rat bone marrow cells via a chemotactic mechanism. The selected cell subset (0.1% of the total bone marrow) is composed of low-density lymphoid cells that do not replicate, and display an immature Thy-1+T-B- phenotype. Thymotaxin-responding cells do not grow in semi-solid cultures under hemopoietic growth factors stimulation, and survive only in coculture with thymic stroma under steroid-free conditions. This stroma mimics the thymic microenvironment and allows a fraction of responding bone marrow cells to acquire T cell differentiation markers and to synthesize transcripts of the TCR alpha and beta chains. Chemotactic migration toward thymic epithelial cell peptides can be used in vitro to sort pre-T cells from the rat bone marrow. The sorted T cell precursors are resting stem cells possibly committed to lymphoid lineage."

https://openalex.org/W1490167130,"Abstract We have identified a series of mutations in the signal peptide of yeast prepro-alpha-factor which specifically attenuate translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in vivo. In prepro-alpha-factor-somatostatin hybrids, transposition of the amino-terminal tripeptide from wild-type NH2-Met-Arg-Phe to NH2-Met-Phe-Lys or NH2-Met-Phe-Arg causes a 45-75% reduction in the efficiency of membrane translocation. This is evidenced by the intracellular accumulation of unglycosylated, signal-containing precursors which are membrane-associated and are exposed to the cytosol. Surprisingly, abolition of the single positive charge by replacing arginine with phenylalanine has little effect on translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum. We conclude that the presence of an amino-terminal positive charge is not necessary for efficient targeting or translocation; however, misplacement by one position markedly disrupts translocation without affecting targeting. These mutations thus define an early stage of membrane interaction that is sensitive to local charge effects. Furthermore, our data suggest that post-translational translocation, signal cleavage, and core glycosylation of these polypeptides may occur to a significant extent in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1501898233,"Abstract Structure-function relations of the colicin E1 ion channel were studied through the effects of mutations in the 35-residue hydrophobic region of the channel polypeptide and neighboring residues in the channel domain. Mutation of neutral residues threonine 501 and glycine 502 to a more polar or charged glutamic acid generated a protein whose channel conductance properties in each case had a decreased selectivity for anions. There was no significant effect on ion selectivity caused by mutations that changed residue charge outside the hydrophobic domain at the neighboring aspartic acid 509 or at glycine 439. The Thr501----Glu and Gly502----Glu mutants possessed lower cytotoxic and in vitro activity. An altered thermolysin cleavage pattern and a greater binding to membrane vesicles at pH greater than 4.5 of the Gly502----Glu mutant indicated greater exposure of its COOH-terminal hydrophobic domain in solution. It is concluded that the hydrophobic nature of threonine 501 and glycine 502 is important in the structure of the channel lumen and the soluble colicin. Altering proline 462, a residue conserved in five sequenced channel-forming colicins, had no significant effect on channel properties. These conclusions are discussed in the context of sequence-structure-function concepts for channel proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1596546407,"Abstract The effects of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) on fatty acid oxidation in isolated rat enterocytes were investigated. VIP (10(-7) M) increased more than 2-fold the production of 14CO2 from [U-14C]palmitate. This effect was dose-dependent (K0.5 = 5.10(-11) M) and appeared to be related to the stimulation of cAMP production since it was mimicked by forskolin (10(-4) M). VIP also stimulated oxygen consumption of the cells, an effect accounted for by the stimulation of the oxidation of both exogenous added palmitate (0.12 mM) and endogenous fatty acids produced by lipolysis. VIP appeared to specifically enhance the oxidation of long-chain fatty acids since its effects were counteracted by 5.10(-5) M sodium 2-[6-(chlorophenoxy)hexyl]oxirane-2-carboxylate, a potent inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, and since VIP did not affect cell respiration in the presence of octanoate. These results suggested that VIP stimulated long-chain fatty acid oxidation by increasing their translocation into the mitochondria. Therefore, we examined the effect of VIP on the activity of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of malonyl-CoA, a physiological inhibitor of carnitine acyltransferase 1. VIP produced an acute, dose-dependent (Ki = 3.10(-11) M), 90% inhibition of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase activity. These results allow us to elucidate the mechanism of the recently reported inhibitory effect of VIP on glucose oxidation (Vidal, H., Comte, B., Beylot, M., and Riou, J. P. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 9206-9211) and demonstrate for the first time that balance between fatty acids and glucose as energetic fuels is under neurohormonal control in isolated rat enterocytes."
