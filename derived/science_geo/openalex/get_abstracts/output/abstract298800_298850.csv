https://openalex.org/W2063685381,"Different components of an ecosystem can respond in very different ways to habitat fragmentation. An archipelago of patches, representing different levels of fragmentation, was arrayed within a successional field and studied over a period of 6 years. Ecosystem processes (soil mineralization and plant succession) did not vary with the degree of subdivision, nor did most measures of plant and animal community diversity. However, fragmentation affected vertebrate population dynamics and distributional patterns as well as the population persistence of clonal plant species. The results highlight the dangers of relying on broad community measures in lieu of detailed population analyses in studies of fragmented habitats."
https://openalex.org/W1998022783,"Losses of life and property due to catastrophic failure of structures are often traced to defective welds. However, major advances have taken place in welding science and technology in the last few decades. With the development of new methodologies at the crossroad of basic and applied sciences, the promise of science-based tailoring of composition, structure, and properties of the weldments may be fulfilled. This will require resolution of several contemporary issues and problems concerning the structure and properties of the weldments as well as intelligent control and automation of the welding processes."
https://openalex.org/W2091557053,Angstrom-resolution atomic force microscope images of Langmuir-Blodgett monolayers and multilayers of cadmium arachidate in air and under water show a dramatic change from a disordered arrangement to a crystalline lattice by the addition or removal of a single layer of molecules. The disordered surface is less stable than the ordered one to mechanical stresses such as atomic force microscopy tip forces or at the air-water contact line during contact angle measurements. The difference in the degree of order in the alkyl chains is attributed to the strong attractive interaction between headgroups in the presence of the divalent cation.
https://openalex.org/W2064738648,"The dielectric constant in and conductivity sigma of undoped C(60) single crystals have been measured as a function of temperature, 10 K < T < 330 K, and frequency, 0.2 kilohertz < f < 100 kilohertz. On cooling below the first-order structural phase transition at 260 K, a Debye-like relaxational contribution to the dielectric response is observed, which requires the presence of permanent electric dipoles. The relaxation rate is thermally activated with a broad distribution of energies centered at 270 millielectron volts. The existence of a dipole moment in C(60) is unexpected, because it is precluded by symmetry for the pure ordered cubic phase. These data suggest that the high degree of frozen-in orientational disorder of the C(60) molecules is responsible for the existence of electric dipolar activity."
https://openalex.org/W2082935850,"A fully quantal wavepacket approach to reactive scattering in which the best available H3 potential energy surface was used enabled a comparison with experimentally determined rates for the D + H2(v = 1, j = 1) → HD(v′ = 0, 1, 2; j′) + H reaction at significantly higher total energies (1.4 to 2.25 electron volts) than previously possible. The theoretical results are obtained over a sufficient range of conditions that a detailed simulation of the experiment was possible, thus making this a definitive comparison of experiment and theory. Good to excellent agreement is found for the vibrational branching ratios and for the rotational distributions within each product vibrational level. However, the calculated rotational distributions are slightly hotter than the experimentally measured ones. This small discrepancy is more marked for products for which a larger fraction of the total energy appears in translation. The most likely explanation for this behavior is that refinements are needed in the potential energy surface."
https://openalex.org/W1970480962,"Major negative oxygen isotopic anomalies in planktonic foraminifera are associated with deep-sea anoxic mud layers (sapropels) deposited 9000 and 80,000 years ago in the eastern Mediterranean. The isotopic depletion in surface-dwelling foraminifera is significantly greater than in mesopelagic foraminifera. This difference in isotopic response suggests that surface-water salinities were drastically reduced during times of sapropel formation, possibly as the result of meltwater runoff from the Fennoscandian ice sheet into the eastern Mediterranean by way of the Black and Aegean seas."
https://openalex.org/W2088422717,"Supercooled droplets in cirrus uncinus cell heads between -40 degrees and -50 degrees C are identified from Project FIRE [First ISCCP (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project) Regional Experiment] polarization lidar measurements. Although short-lived, complexes of these small liquid cells seem to have contributed importantly to the formation of the cirrus. Freezing-point depression effects in solution droplets, apparently resulting from relatively large cloud condensation nuclei of volcanic origin, can be used to explain this rare phenomenon. An unrecognized volcano-cirrus cloud climate feedback mechanism is implied by these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2016458670,"High-pressure Brillouin spectra of crystalline hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) have been measured at up to 7 gigapascals at room temperature. The best fit of the angular dependence of Brillouin acoustic velocities between experimental values and calculations based on Every's expression for elastic waves of an arbitrary direction yielded the orientation of an H(2)S cubic crystal grown in the diamond-anvil high-pressure cell. In situ determinations of sound velocities, as a function of pressure, could be made for any direction, the refractive index, the density, and the elastic constants. This method provides a means for the systematic study of elastic properties and phase transitions of condensed gases under ultrahigh pressures."

https://openalex.org/W2122206866,"Diffraction of monochromatized synchrotron radiation by crystals of cesium hydrogen tartrate has been used to measure the magnitude and phase of x-ray scattering for cesium near the LIII absorption edge. In this wavelength region the scattering amplitude of cesium is reduced by as much as 25 electrons per atom, compared to scattering of copper Kalpha x-rays. This change, which varies as a function of wavelength, affects the diffraction intensities in a manner similar to isomorphous substitution, and it is large enough to have promise for phase determination in the study of macromolecular structures. This experiment also demonstrates that accurate diffractometer measurements are possible with synchrotron radiation produced by an electron storage ring."
https://openalex.org/W2075147355,"Turrin et al. argue that conventional K-Ar and {sup 40}Ar/{sup 39}Ar age determinations and paleomagnetic data provide a definitive age assignment of approximatley 136 ka (thousand years ago) to 141 ka for the Lathrop Wells volcanic center with an error of less than 10,000 years. The use of a weighted mean gives age assignments with unrealistically small errors, in that the group age dates range from 20 ka to 947 ka. Yet Turrin et al. do not explain why the weighted mean might be more reliable than the conventional mean, nor do they test the validity of the weighted mean method. Specific concerns are as follows. (1) The age determinations are positively skewed with a mean larger than the median. (2) Turrin et al. did not examine the data set with conventional tests for outliers. Evaluation of their data shows that outliers are present where outliers are defined to be more than 1.5 times the interquantile range. (3) Four age determinations were discarded by Turrin et al. in the weighted mean data reduction because of contamination. No systematic criteria were presented for doing so, and recalculation of the data set with these four age determinations yields significantly older values ofmore » the weighted mean with larger uncertainty. (4) The regression plots show the presence of influential cases which should have been identified to check for errors and suitability to the data set. (5) There was no discussion of data errors other than analytical. (6) Conventional, whole rock K-Ar data are averaged with the {sup 40}Ar/{sup 39}Ar to establish final values for the weighted means. However, the whole rock data are not listed. Thus it is not clear whether the data set belongs to the same population as the {sup 40}Ar/{sup 39}Ar data.« less"
