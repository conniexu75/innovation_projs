https://openalex.org/W2154598050,"The structure of human P450 2C9 complexed with flurbiprofen was determined to 2.0 Å by x-ray crystallography. In contrast to other structurally characterized P450 2C enzymes, 2C5, 2C8, and a 2C9 chimera, the native catalytic domain of P450 2C9 differs significantly in the conformation of the helix F to helix G region and exhibits an extra turn at the N terminus of helix A. In addition, a distinct conformation of the helix B to helix C region allows Arg-108 to hydrogen bond with Asp-293 and Asn-289 on helix I and to interact directly with the carboxylate of flurbiprofen. These interactions position the substrate for regioselective oxidation in a relatively large active site cavity and are likely to account for the high catalytic efficiency exhibited by P450 2C9 for the regioselective oxidation of several anionic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The structure provides a basis for interpretation of a number of observations regarding the substrate selectivity of P450 2C9 and the observed effects of mutations on catalysis.

P450 2C9 is one of three human microsomal cytochrome P450s (CYPs) 1The abbreviations used are: CYP or P450, a generic term for a cytochrome P450, with individual P450s identified using a number-letter-number format based on sequence relatedness; KPi, potassium phosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol; Fo, observed structure factor; Fc, calculated structure factor; SRS, substrate recognition site.1The abbreviations used are: CYP or P450, a generic term for a cytochrome P450, with individual P450s identified using a number-letter-number format based on sequence relatedness; KPi, potassium phosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol; Fo, observed structure factor; Fc, calculated structure factor; SRS, substrate recognition site. in subfamily 2C that contribute extensively to the hepatic metabolism of therapeutic drugs. The P450 2C9 locus is polymorphic leading to a diminished capacity to clear specific drugs in genetically affected individuals. For P450 2C9 substrates, such as warfarin or phenytoin, that have low therapeutic margins of safety, diminished metabolic capacity because of genetic polymorphisms or drug-drug interactions can lead to toxicity at normal therapeutic doses (1Lee C.R. Goldstein J.A. Pieper J.A. Pharmacogenetics. 2002; 12: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). P450 2C9 has also been implicated in the synthesis of arachidonic acid epoxides in extrahepatic tissues where they regulate blood pressure (2Fleming I. Pharmacol. Res. 2004; 49: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Like other P450 subfamilies, the 2C enzymes share roughly 70% or greater amino acid identity. However, the 2C genes have duplicated and diverged rapidly as mammalian species evolved, leading to different numbers of enzymes in various species and highly divergent substrate selectivities. This diversity reflects high rates of non-synonymous substitutions that often alter residues that line the active site cavity and determine substrate selectivity.Human P450s 2C9 and 2C19 are closely related with roughly 91% amino acid identity. Although they exhibit distinct substrate selectivities, residues predicted to line the active site cavity, based on the published structures of other mammalian P450s (3Schoch G.A. Yano J.K.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6370-6379Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), do not differ between the two enzymes. This suggests that conformation changes are likely to underlie differences in the substrate selectivities of P450s 2C9 and 2C19 and that the structure(s) of one or both will differ from those published previously. This is supported by studies of chimeric enzymes generated from P450s 2C9 and 2C19 that have generally identified amino acid residues that are predicted to reside outside the substrate binding cavity as determinants of their distinct catalytic properties (7Tsao C.C.

Biophys. 1998; 357: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).P450 2C9 exhibits a selectivity for the oxidation of relatively small, lipophilic anions such as the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, naproxen, and diclofenac as well as the hypolipidemic agent gemfibrozil. It has been hypothesized that a basic residue in the active site of P450 2C9 stabilizes the binding of these anionic substrates (10Mancy A. Dijols S. Poli S. Guengerich F.P. Mansuy D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16205-16212Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 11Jones B.C. Hawksworth G. Horne V.A. Newlands A. Morsman J. Tute M.S. Smith D.A. Drug Metab.

Chem. 2002; 45: 1983-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, the structure (Protein Data Bank code 1OG5) of a chimeric form of P450 2C9 published earlier did not provide evidence for a basic residue that would serve this role. The relatively large size of the active site exhibited by the 1OG5 structure rendered the selectivity of P450 2C9 for small lipophilic anions particularly difficult to understand.Our objective in determining the structure of P450 2C9 was to preserve the native sequence of the enzyme to the greatest extent possible and to co-crystallize the enzyme with a representative anionic substrate bound in the active site to identify structural determinants underlying the substrate selectivity of the enzyme for anionic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Eukaryotic P450s are monotopic membrane proteins with the microsomal P450s having a single transmembrane helix at the N terminus that is not found in mitochondrial P450s. Removal of the N-terminal transmembrane domain has facilitated structure determination of the catalytic domains of microsomal P450s (14Wester M.R. Stout C.D. Johnson E.F. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 357: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, when expressed in Escherichia coli without their N-terminal transmembrane helices, microsomal P450s generally retain a capacity to bind to membranes (15Cosme J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2545-2553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In the case of P450 2C5 and the related enzyme P450 2C3, high ionic strength buffers reversed membrane binding (15Cosme J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2545-2553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 16Von Wachenfeldt C. Richardson T.H. Cosme J. Johnson E.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A second modification is generally used that extends the C terminus of the enzyme to include a 4-residue histidine tag to facilitate purification of the truncated enzymes. P450 2C9 was modified similarly for crystallization in the present study, and the catalytically active construct is designated P450 2C9dH. In contrast to the modified P450 2C9 employed to determine the 1OG5 structure (4Williams P.A. Cosme J. Ward A. Angove H.C. Matak V.D. Jhoti H. Nature. 2003; 424: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar), no additional mutations were introduced within the catalytic domain of the protein for the present study.The structure of the flurbiprofen complex of 2C9dH (Protein Data Bank code 1R9O) reported here differs significantly from the 1OG5 structure of the more extensively modified 2C9 construct reported by Williams et al. (4Williams P.A. Cosme J. Ward A. Angove H.C. Matak V.D. Jhoti H. Nature. 2003; 424: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar) in specific regions that encompass residues 30–53, 97–121, 196–233, and 467–478. The truncated, histidine-tagged 2C9 construct crystallized in the study of Williams et al. (4Williams P.A. Cosme J. Ward A. Angove H.C. Matak V.D. Jhoti H. Nature. 2003; 424: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar) contained seven amino acid substitutions, K206E, I215V, C216Y, S220P, P221A, I223L, and I224L, which correspond to residues in CYP2C5/3LVdH, and the structure, whether bound to warfarin or not, is more similar to that of CYP2C5/3LVdH in this region than the 1R9O structure reported here. In addition, warfarin was bound to the 1OG5 enzyme in the distal end of the active site cavity with the site of hydroxylation residing in an unproductive position more than 10 Å from the site of oxygen binding, which could reflect the presence of an unidentified substance bound near the iron in the substrate binding site (4Williams P.A. Cosme J. Ward A. Angove H.C. Matak V.D. Jhoti H. Nature. 2003; 424: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). In contrast, the 1R9O structure indicates that flurbiprofen is positioned with the site of hydroxylation located for oxidative attack by the reactive, hypervalent iron-oxo intermediate derived from reduction of molecular oxygen by the enzyme. The 1R9O structure described in this article also identifies an important role for Arg-108 in stabilizing the binding of flurbiprofen and reveals a distinctly different conformation of the helix B to helix C region, where Arg-108 resides. The 1R9O structure contributes significantly to the interpretation of previous mutagenesis studies implicating Arg-108 (17Ridderstrom M. Masimirembwa C. Trump-Kallmeyer S. Ahlefelt M. Otter C.

J. 2002; 370: 921-926Crossref Google Scholar) in substrate recognition and provides a basis for understanding the selectivity exhibited by 2C9 for anionic substrates.MATERIALS AND METHODS2C9 Construct—The pCW2C9dH construct was prepared by ligating two fragments bearing portions of the CYP2C9 cDNA into a vector derived from the pCW2C5/3LVdH plasmid by digestion with the SacI and SalI restriction enzymes. A SacI-SphI fragment encoding the N-terminal portion of CYP2C9 beginning with codon 23 was excised from the pCW2C9 plasmid described earlier for expression of the full-length enzyme in E. coli (20Richardson T.H. Jung F. Griffin K.J. Wester M. Raucy J.L. Kemper B. Bornheim L.M. Hassett C. Omiecinski C.J. Johnson E.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The portion encoding the C terminus was PCR-amplified from the plasmid using a lower primer employed previously to incorporate a 4-residue histidine tag at the C terminus of CYP2C5 (16Von Wachenfeldt C. Richardson T.H. Cosme J. Johnson E.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), leading to an alteration of the C-terminal residue of CYP2C9 to a valine plus the histidine tag. The PCR fragment was digested with the restriction endonucleases SphI and SalI, and the three fragments were ligated together to create the expression vector. This strategy fused the coding sequence of 2C9 beginning at residue 23 with the first 5 residues, MAKKT, of the modified N terminus used to express P450 2C5 for crystallization and also replaced the C-terminal valine with an isoleucine plus a 4-histidine tag to facilitate purification (Fig. 1).Protein Expression and Purification—P450 2C9dH was expressed and purified as described previously for 2C5dH with several modifications (14Wester M.R. Stout C.D. Johnson E.F. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 357: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Three l of Terrific broth were seeded with 6 ml of an overnight culture of XL-1 blue E. coli containing the pCW2C9dH plasmid. Following the addition of 240 mg of δ-aminolevulinic acid and 720 mg of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, the culture was incubated at 30 °C for 48 h with shaking at 225 rpm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 10% of the original culture volume of 20 mm KPi, 20% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Lysozyme (0.3 mg/ml) was added, and the cells were incubated with stirring for 45 min at 4 °C. An equal volume of cold water was added, and the incubation continued with stirring for an additional 15 min. The spheroplasts were pelleted by centrifugation at 7,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C overnight. The pellet was thawed, resuspended in 500 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and sonicated for three 45-s pulses with 1-min cooling on ice between the pulses. Following clarification by centrifugation at 7000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, CYMAL-5 detergent (Anatrace, Maumee, OH) was added to a final concentration of 4.8 mm, and the material was incubated with stirring at 4 °C for 30 min. Following this incubation, the material was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with 6 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) that was pre-equilibrated with 150 ml of 500 mm KPi, pH 7.4, and 20% glycerol. After 3 h, the resin was collected by gentle centrifugation. The resin was washed with 40 ml of 500 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 4.8 mm CYMAL-5 and then with 40 ml of 100 mm KPi, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 4.8 mm CYMAL-5. A subsequent wash with 50 ml of 10 mm KPi, pH 7.4, containing 3100 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 4.8 mm CYMAL-5, and 1 mm histidine was performed in a small chromatography column. The protein was eluted with 10 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 4.8 mm CYMAL-5, and 30 mm histidine. Peak fractions were pooled and diluted with 150 ml of 5 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm DTT, and 4.8 mm CYMAL-5. The diluted material was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle end-over-end agitation with 5 ml of CM-Sepharose that was equilibrated with the dilution buffer. The following day, the resin was packed in a column and washed with 75 ml of the equilibration buffer containing 1.2 mm CYMAL-5. The P450 eluted sharply in 50 mm KPi, 500 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm DTT, pH 7.4 containing 0.96 mm CYMAL-5, and the pooled fractions contained 165 μm P450. Following elution, the protein was concentrated to 635 μm using a centrifugal membrane-concentrating device with a 50,000 Da cutoff (Millipore, Billerica, MA).Diclofenac Hydroxylation—P450s 2C9 and 2C9dH (10 pmol) were reconstituted with purified rabbit liver P450 reductase as described previously for P450 2C5dH (15Cosme J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2545-2553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out in 1-ml incubations containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm diclofenac, and 1 mm NADPH. Following a 30-min incubation, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.2 ml of 1 n HCl and placed on ice. The products and substrate were extracted from the reaction mixture and analyzed by reverse-phase chromatography as described previously (21Wester M.R. Lasker J.M. Johnson E.F. Raucy J.L. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2000; 28: 354-359PubMed Google Scholar). Elution was monitored by UV absorption at 280 nm, and the integrated elution profiles were compared with those produced by known amounts of 4′-hydroxydiclofenac (BD Biosciences) prepared in the same manner.Flurbiprofen Binding Studies—The conversion of P450 2C9dH from a low spin to a high spin state in the presence of flurbiprofen was monitored spectrophotometrically as described by Jefcoate (22Jefcoate C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 258-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Purified protein was diluted to 1.9 μm in 50 mm KPi, pH 7.4, containing 500 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm DTT in a 1-cm-path length microcuvette. Aliquots of diclofenac dissolved in ethanol were added to the solution, and the differences in the absorption between 394 and 418 nm were recorded. The apparent binding constant was estimated as described previously (8Jung F. Griffin K.J. Song W. Richardson T.H. Yang M. Johnson E.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16270-16279Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Mass Spectral Analysis—Several large crystals were harvested and dissolved in 50 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm DTT. The samples were desalted with a ZipTipC4 device (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's protocol and then were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight spectrometry by the Scripps Center for Mass Spectroscopy.Crystallization and Structure Determination—Hanging drops of 2.5 μl initially containing 0.24 mm P450, 1.92 mm flurbiprofen, 2.3 mm CYMAL-5, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1% polyethylene glycol 8000, 20 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm EDTA, 0.08 mm DTT, and 8% glycerol were equilibrated against 0.1 m HEPES, pH 8.5, and 2% polyethylene glycol 8000 at 24 °C. For x-ray data collection a number of crystals were screened for optimal diffraction. The crystals were prepared by flash-freezing in liquid N2 using a cryoprotectant containing 97 mm HEPES, pH 8.5, 43.5% polyethylene glycol 8000, and 150 mm NaCl. The crystal was then transferred to the cryostream, and data were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) beam line 9-1. Data were collected at 100 K using a single crystal and were recorded using a Quantum4 CCD detector and 1° oscillations (180 frames, 90-s exposure). The crystal did not decay noticeably during data collection and exhibited uniform mosaicity of ∼0.6°. CCP4 programs MOSFLM and SCALA (23Leslie A.G.W. CCP4 Newletter on Protein Crystallography 32.

Open table in a new tab The structure of 2C9 was solved with the 2.3-Å 2C5/3LVdH structure (Protein Data Bank code 1NR6) as a search model for molecular replacement. Multiple cycles of editing and adjustment of the model into σA-weighted 2|Fo| – |Fc| composite omit and |Fo| – |Fc| electron density maps were performed using the programs XFIT/XTALVIEW (24McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar) and O (25Jones T.A. Kjeldgaard M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The models were refined against the 2.0-Å data using conjugate gradient least squares minimization, simulated annealing, and isotropic individual B-factor refinement using the program CNS (26Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16929) Google Scholar). During the final stages of refinement, water molecules were added, and flurbiprofen was modeled into the 2|Fo| – |Fc| electron density contoured at 1 σ in the active site of the protein model. Unless otherwise indicated, molecular graphics used in the figures were generated using PyMOL. 2W. L. DeLano, PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (2002) at www.pymol.org.Automated Docking of Dapsone—To examine the potential for simultaneous binding of dapsone with flurbiprofen in the active site of the 1R9O structure, computer-based automated docking of dapsone into the active site of the flurbiprofen complex was performed using AUTODOCK 3.05, a grid-based docking program (27Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (8957) Google Scholar). A modified genetic search algorithm employing a local minimum refinement was used to identify low energy binding sites and orientations of the probe molecule. A 50 × 54 × 60-point grid with a spacing of 0.375 Å centered at 2.98, 32.01, –5.25 Å that fully encompassed the active site was used. Explicit polar hydrogens were included in the model. Kollman-united atom charges were assigned to the protein using AUTODOCKTOOLS. Charges for the heme were assigned as described by Helms and Wade (28Helms V. Wade R.C. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 810-824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Coordinates for dapsone were obtained from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). Charges were assigned to flurbiprofen and dapsone using the PRODRG (29van Aalten D.M. Bywater R. Findlay J.B. Hendlich M. Hooft R.W. Vriend G. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1996; 10: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) server (davapc1.bioch.dundee.ac.uk/programs/prodrg/). The results of 50 randomly seeded runs were analyzed, and the results were clustered when the atomic coordinates of the final orientation of the docked dapsone molecules exhibited less than a 1-Å root mean square deviation.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe 2C9dH construct was designed to express residues 23–489 of the catalytic domain for crystallization without internal modifications that might affect the structure. The first 22 amino acid residues, which include the transmembrane signal anchor domain, were replaced with the sequence MAKKT (Fig. 1). This sequence was derived from the first 5 residues of the modified N terminus that had been optimized for the expression and crystallization of rabbit P450 2C5 (16Von Wachenfeldt C. Richardson T.H. Cosme J. Johnson E.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The construct used here differs from that used by Williams et al. (4Williams P.A. Cosme J. Ward A. Angove H.C. Matak V.D. Jhoti H. Nature. 2003; 424: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar) to determine the 1OG5 and 1OG2 structures of CYP2C9 with and without S-warfarin to 2.55 and 2.66 Å, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, the constructs used for the 1OG5 and 1OG2 structures incorporated several internal substitutions as well as differences in the N- and C-terminal sequences. Residue numbering for the constructs corresponds throughout the text to that of the wild-type P450 2C9 sequence.The 1R9O construct described here expresses to greater than 400 nmol/liter in E. coli based on whole cell CO-reduced difference spectra and can be extensively purified with only minor modifications to protocols in use for 2C5/3LVdH (14Wester M.R. Stout C.D. Johnson E.F. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 357: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). P450 2C9dH is active when reconstituted with P450 reductase, catalyzing the 4′-hydroxylation of diclofenac, with a kcat value of 11.8 nmol/min/nmol of P450 compared with 14.1 nmol/min/nmol of P450 for the full-length enzyme. Flurbiprofen binds to P450 2C9dH with an apparent binding constant of 9.6 μm determined by monitoring the partial conversion of the enzyme to the high spin ferric form. This value compares closely with a value of 14.1 μm reported for the wild-type enzyme (30Hutzler J.M. Wienkers L.C. Wahlstrom J.L. Carlson T.J. Tracy T.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 410: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the modifications to the N and C termini do not significantly affect flurbiprofen binding or P450 2C9 oxidation of diclofenac.Data from a single crystal that diffracted to 2.0 Å in space group R3 with a single molecule in the asymmetric unit were used for model building and refinement. Molecular replacement based on the structure of 2C5 (Protein Data Bank code 1NR6) was used for initial phasing and as a basis for building the protein model. Subsequent refinement and fitting resulted in a structure with an R value of 0.19 and an Rfree value of 0.24 (Table I). The electron density maps did not define several residues sufficiently for modeling. These include the 7 N-terminal residues of the truncated protein preceding residue 26, residues 38–42 between the proline-rich motif and helix A, residues 214–220 between helices F and G, and the last 2 residues of the C-terminal His tag (Fig. 1). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight spectrometry following recovery of the crystallized protein indicated an atomic mass of 54,160 Da (with a predicted atomic mass of 54,151 Da), confirming that the crystallized protein had not been cleaved. Additionally, the final model included 1 glycerol and 255 H2O molecules (Table I). The 2|Fo| – |Fc| electron density maps contoured at 1.0 σ clearly defined the position and orientation of flurbiprofen in the active site, which was modeled as S-flurbiprofen based on electron density defining this diastereomer. The experimentally determined structure of 2C9dH displays good stereochemistry with only 1.6% of the residues found in generously allowed or disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (Table I).The 1R9O structure of the flurbiprofen complex of 2C9dH corresponds closely to the 1OG5 structure in many regions with a root mean square deviation of 0.74 Å. However, significant differences are seen in the N terminus preceding residue 53 in helix A, residues 97–121 between helices B and C, residues 197–232 encompassing helix F through the beginning of helix G, and residues 467–478 that form the turn in the C-terminal antiparallel β-sheet (Fig. 1). These differences are clustered in one quadrant of the structure (Fig. 2), which also"

BK channels are thought to have a particularly prominent role in urinary bladder smooth muscle function and therefore are candidate targets for overactive bladder therapy. To address the role of the BK channel in urinary bladder function, the gene mSlo1 for the pore-forming subunit of the BK channel was deleted. Slo–/– mice were viable but exhibited moderate ataxia. Urinary bladder smooth muscle cells of Slo–/– mice lacked calcium- and voltage-activated BK currents, whereas local calcium transients (“calcium sparks”) and voltage-dependent potassium currents were unaffected. In the absence of BK channels, urinary bladder spontaneous and nerve-evoked contractions were greatly enhanced. Consistent with increased urinary bladder contractility caused by the absence of BK currents, Slo–/– mice demonstrate a marked elevation in urination frequency. These results reveal a central role for BK channels in urinary bladder function and indicate that BK channel dysfunction leads to overactive bladder and urinary incontinence.

These results reveal a central role for BK channels in urinary bladder function and indicate that BK channel dysfunction leads to overactive bladder and urinary incontinence. Overactive urinary bladder and urinary incontinence is a significant health issue occurring in about 51 million (∼17%) of the United States population (1Hu T.W. Wagner T.H. Bentkover J.D. Leblanc K. Zhou S.Z. Hunt T. Urology. 2004; 63: 461-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), frequently occurring as a secondary consequence of conditions such as diabetes mellitus, stroke, and spinal cord injury. Urge incontinence is caused by overactivity of the urinary bladder smooth muscle (UBSM), 1The abbreviations and trivial terms used are: UBSM, urinary bladder smooth muscle; BK, large conductance calcium-activated K+ channel; IBTX, iberiotoxin; Slo–/–, mSlo1 homozygous null.1The abbreviations and trivial terms used are: UBSM, urinary bladder smooth muscle; BK, large conductance calcium-activated K+ channel; IBTX, iberiotoxin; Slo–/–, mSlo1 homozygous null. often a result of partial urethral outlet obstruction that can occur during prostate hypertrophy. Currently there is a lack of effective therapeutic agents to control urinary bladder function. Antimuscarinic agents, which impair UBSM contraction, are used to treat urinary incontinence but have limited effectiveness and undesirable side effects. More recently, potassium channel opening drugs have been explored as therapeutic agents for urinary incontinence (2Li J.H. Yasay G.D. Zografos P. Kau S.T. Ohnmacht C.J. Russell K. Empfield J.R.

These studies point to a pivotal role of the BK channel in urinary bladder function. Generation of Slo–/–Mice—mSlo1 genomic clones were isolated from a 129/SvJ BAC library (Incyte Genomics) using an ∼1.6-kb EcoRV/XhoI cDNA probe fragment. A 7.8-kb SalI/BamHI genomic fragment containing exon 1 was cloned into pPNT (13Tybulewicz V.L. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson R.T. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar, 14Joyner A.L. Gene Targeting: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 1-61Google Scholar). Synthetic double-stranded oligos containing loxP recognition sequences for Cre recombinase were cloned 5′ (XhoI site, 5′-TCCCTCGAATAACTTCGTATAGCATACATTATACGAAGTTATTCGAGCCC-3′) and 3′ (NcoI site, 5′-GGATCCATAACTTCGTATAGCATACATTATACGAAGTTATCCATGG-3′) of exon 1. Enhanced green fluorescent protein containing β-globin basal promoter elements and a bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal (a gift from Dr. Jane Johnson) was subcloned into the mSlo1 intronic sequence at the NcoI site. For removal of the neo cassette, oligos containing FRT recognition sites for Flp recombinase were subcloned into the XhoI and XbaI sites flanking PGKneo (5′-CTCGATGAAGTTCCTATACTTTCTAGAGAATAGGAACTTCGGAATAGGAACTTCTCGAG-3′ and 5′-TCTAGGAAGTTCCTATACTTTCTAGAGAATAGGAACTTCGGAATAGGAACTTCAGATCC-3′). An ∼1.2-kb BamHI/KpnI mSlo1 genomic fragment was subcloned 3′ of the neo cassette into XbaI/KpnI of pPNT. The targeting construct was linearized for transfection with NotI and electroporated into R1 embryonic stem cells. After ganciclovir and G418 selections, six correct integrants were identified by PCR. To verify intact integration of the entire targeting construct, these clones were analyzed by Southern blot using external 5′ and 3′ probes on XhoI and BamHI/MfeI-digested genomic DNA, respectively. Two correctly integrated clones were injected into C57Bl/6 blastocyst stage embryos, producing five germ line-transmitting founders. To generate a whole animal Slo–/– mutant, founder males were crossed to FVB-TgN(EIIa-Cre)C5379Lmgd females (Jackson Laboratories), a line that ubiquitously expresses Cre from the adenoviral EIIa promoter. All F1 progeny had stable, germ line-transmissible deletions of exon 1, as confirmed by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1B). Heterozygotes were backcrossed >6 generations to FVB/NJ. Inter-crosses to obtain homozygous Slo–/– were genotyped by PCR on tail DNA. PCR Genotyping of Slo–/–Mice—Tail snips were digested overnight at 55 °C in 750 μl of SNET (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 0.4 m NaCl) plus 15 μl of 20 mg/ml proteinase K and extracted with an equal volume 1:1 phenol/chloroform. DNA was ethanol-precipitated and 500 ng of DNA (or 2 μl of supernatant) was used in PCR reactions (NEB Taq, supplier's reaction condition plus 2% Me2SO; amplification conditions: 94 °C, 2 min; (94 °C, 30 s; 55–50 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 2 min) × 5 cycles; (94 °C, 30 s; 50 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 2 min) × 30 cycles; 72 °C, 5′; 4 °C, hold). Neo 5′ (5′-ATA GCC TGA AGA ACG AGA TCA GC-3′) and RA 14025 3′ (5′-CCT CAA GAA GGG GAC TCT AAA C-3′) amplify the Slo–/– allele product of 800 bp. Exon 1 5′-3 (5′-TTC ATC ATC TTG CTC TGG CGG ACG-3′) and WT 3′-2 (5′-CCA TAG TCA CCA ATA GCC C-3′) amplify the wild-type product of 332 bp. Isolation of UBSM and Western Blotting—All procedures involving mice were in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee policies at the University of Vermont and Stanford University. Slo+/+ and Slo–/– mice 1.5–3 months of age were sacrificed by intraperitoneal injection of a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital (150 mg/kg) or CO2 euthanasia. For Western blots, urinary bladders were solubilized in lysis buffer (137 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The insoluble fraction was separated by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 5 min). 5 μg of soluble supernatant protein (assayed by Bio-Rad DC protein assay reagent) underwent SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% acrylamide gel prior to being transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked in 4% dry nonfat milk, 2% normal goat serum, 10 mm Tris (pH 8), 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h. They were then labeled with primary antibodies in blocking solution overnight, 1:5000 each of rabbit polyclonal α-Slo (Alamone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) and mouse monoclonal DM 1A α-tubulin (Sigma). Membranes were labeled with 1:500 SuperSignal West Dura horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat α-rabbit and α-mouse secondary antibodies (Pierce), and proteins were visualized by SuperSignal chemiluminescence detection (Pierce). Electrophysiology—UBSM cells from Slo+/+ and Slo–/– mice were isolated enzymatically for perforated whole-cell patch clamp recordings at 22 °C as previously described (15Thorneloe K.S. Nelson M.T. J. Physiol. 2003; 549: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Horn R. Marty A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar). The bath and pipette solutions contained the following (mm): 134 NaCl, 6 KCl, MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 Hepes, pH 7.4 (NaOH), and 110 potassium aspartate, 30 KCl, 10 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.05 EGTA, 200 μgml–1 amphotericin B, and 10 Hepes, pH 7.2 (KOH), respectively. Iberiotoxin (Sigma) was used at a final concentration of 100 or 300 nm. Ca2+Spark Measurements—Isolated UBSM cells were loaded on glass coverslips with the Ca2+-sensitive fluorophore, fluo 4-AM (Molecular Probes), in cell isolation solution (16Horn R. Marty A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar) with 10 μm fluo 4-AM, 0.04% pluronic acid, and 2 mm CaCl2 for 20 min. After loading, UBSM cells were washed with electrophysiology bath solution, and Ca2+ imaging was conducted on a laser-scanning confocal microscope (OZ; Noran Instruments) at room temperature, acquiring images at 120 or 30 Hz with scan durations of 25 s. Ca2+ sparks were defined as local increases in fluorescence of 1.3 F/Fo (F, instantaneous; Fo, baseline fluorescence) that persisted for at least two images and were analyzed with custom software written by Dr. Adrian Bonev using IDL Research Systems (17Perez G.J. Bonev A.D. Patlak J.B. Nelson M.T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 18Jaggar J.H. Nelson M.T. Am. J.

Fo was obtained by averaging 10 images that displayed no Ca2+ sparks. For quantitation of Ca2+ sparks, a box (10 × 10 pixels, 2.2 × 2.2 μm) was placed over the Ca2+ spark site, and F/Fo traces were generated. Contractility Studies—Contractility experiments were performed at 37 °C as previously described (20Herrera G.M. Pozo M.J. Zvara P. Petkov G.V. Bond C.T. Adelman J.P. Nelson M.T. J. Physiol. 2003; 551: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) using a MyoMed myograph system (MED Associates Inc.). Electrical field stimulation was at 20 Hz (20 V amplitude, alternating polarity between pulses, 0.2-ms stimulation width) delivered once a minute for 2 s. Electrical field stimulation evoked a robust contraction of UBSM strips that was completely blocked by 1 μm tetrodotoxin (n = 3). IBTX was dissolved in water and added directly to the bathing solution at a concentration of 100 nm. Spontaneous phasic contractile activity was analyzed using MiniAnalysis (Synaptosoft, Inc.). Urination Patterns—Female mice 1–2.5 months of age were placed in standard cages for 1 h with the bedding replaced by Whatman Grade 3 filter paper. Food and water were given ad libitum. Urine spots were photographed under UV light (21Thor K.B. Blais D.P. de Groat W.C. Dev. Brain Res. 1989; 46: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Birder L.A. Nakamura Y. Kiss S.

Statistical Analyses—Results are expressed as means ± S.E. where applicable. Comparisons were made with the two-tailed Student's t test (before and after IBTX application were paired, Slo+/+versus Slo–/– were unpaired). Generation of Slo–/–Mice—To test the hypothesis that BK channel dysfunction leads to overactive bladder and urinary incontinence, we created a targeted mutation of the pore-forming subunit, encoded by the mSlo1 gene, by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells using standard techniques (14Joyner A.L. Gene Targeting: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 1-61Google Scholar). A conditional allele of the mSlo1 gene was generated by flanking exon 1 with loxP sites, which enables deletion of exon 1 by expression of Cre recombinase (Fig. 1A). Exon 1 contains the translation start site as well as the S0 transmembrane segment of the channel necessary for formation of functional channels (23Wallner M. Meera P. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14922-14927Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Ubiquitous expression of Cre recombinase deletes exon 1, generating a stable, germ line-transmissible mutant allele (Fig. 1B, Slo–/–). mSlo1 transcripts (n = 3) and protein (Fig. 1C) are undetectable in UBSM from Slo–/– mice, indicating the allele is a null. General Phenotypes of Slo–/–Mice—We examined the general features of Slo–/– mice using behavioral and histological analysis. Although mSlo1 is widely expressed (24Sah P. Faber E.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) and BK channels are postulated to be important in many tissues, Slo–/– mice exhibit grossly normal organ development (n = 5) and neurological signs (n = 10) (25Crawley J.N. What's Wrong with My Mouse? Behavioral Phenotyping of Transgenic and Knockout Mice. Wiley-Liss, New York2000: 31-63Google Scholar). Although Slo–/– mice are born in approximately normal Mendelian ratios (Fig. 1B, 28.5% Slo+/+, 50% Slo+/–, and 21.5% Slo–/–, n = 296 mice), they are 27% smaller than Slo+/+ littermates (weight at 2 weeks: Slo+/+, 9.2 ± 0.6 g, n = 8; Slo–/+, 7.2 ± 0.2 g, n = 30; Slo–/–, 6.7 ± 0.3 g, n = 13). However, by 5 weeks of age their body mass is similar to littermates (Slo+/+, 19.5 ± 0.5 g, n = 15; Slo–/+, 19.4 ± 0.5 g, n = 20; Slo–/–, 20.0 ± 0.9 g, n = 7). On an inbred FVB/NJ background, 40% of Slo–/– mice die at an average age of 2.2 ± 0.3 months of unknown causes (n = 48). The surviving mutant mice have apparently normal life spans (>10 months). Surprisingly, Slo–/– mice are able to produce offspring. Although the efficiency of successful matings is significantly reduced, 1 of 20 Slo–/– males (set up for mating to wild-type females) was able to sire a litter of normal size (9 pups, n = 1 litter). Despite the proposed role of BK channels in uterine smooth muscle quiescence during pregnancy (26Anwer K. Oberti C. Perez G.J. Perez-Reyes N. McDougall J.K. Monga M. Sanborn B.M. Stefani E. Toro L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C976-C985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Song M. Zhu N. Olcese R. Barila B. Toro L. Stefani E. FEBS. Lett. 1999; 460: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), Slo–/– females can carry litters to term and adequately feed and care for their pups (average litter sizes from females mated to Slo+/– males: Slo+/– mothers, 7.8 ± 0.4 pups, n = 23 litters; Slo–/– mothers, 3.9 ± 0.5 pups, n = 7 litters). The pervasive phenotype demonstrated by all Slo–/– mice is moderate ataxia. Footprint analysis reveals that Slo–/– mice have a shorter stride length (Fig. 2A). The gait pattern of a 35-cm segment was analyzed for each mouse by inking their feet and running them through a straight tunnel on white paper (25Crawley J.N. What's Wrong with My Mouse? Behavioral Phenotyping of Transgenic and Knockout Mice. Wiley-Liss, New York2000: 31-63Google Scholar). Slo+/+ mice had an average stride length of 3.1 ± 0.1 cm (n = 5 mice), whereas Slo–/– mice displayed an uneven gait pattern with a stride length of 1.8 ± 0.1 cm (n = 6, p < 0.05). In a test of motor performance, Slo–/– mice fell off an accelerating rotarod at significantly slower speeds compared with littermates (Fig. 2B). However, motor learning is not impaired (Fig. 2, D and E). Slo–/– mice also perform poorly in the hanging wire assay (25Crawley J.N. What's Wrong with My Mouse? Behavioral Phenotyping of Transgenic and Knockout Mice. Wiley-Liss, New York2000: 31-63Google Scholar), a task requiring grip strength as well as motor coordination for which mice grasp an inverted cage lid and the time period before falling is measured (Fig. 2C). Our data do not distinguish between deficits in central neurons (cerebellum, basal ganglia, vestibular, or motor), peripheral neurons (sensory), or skeletal muscle, but none of these tissues is abnormal by gross morphology or histological examination in Slo–/– mice (n = 7). The underlying cause of the ataxia is currently being investigated with tissue-specific Cre lines and the Slo conditional allele. Interestingly, 6% of mutants also exhibit persistent spontaneous circling (n = 47). This unidirectional circling is likely because of a functional deficit; necropsies on affected Slo–/– mice did not reveal any cerebellar, basal ganglia, vestibular, or other lesions (n = 2). Slo Encodes Voltage-activated, IBTX-sensitive K+Currents in UBSM—UBSM cells isolated from Slo+/+ mice exhibit a pronounced BK channel current, measured as the voltage-activated outward current inhibited by IBTX, a selective blocker of BK channels (Fig. 3). BK channel currents are absent in UBSM cells from Slo–/– mice (Fig. 3). We further examined the properties of UBSM cells isolated from Slo+/+ and Slo–/– mice. The whole-cell capacitance was not different, indicating similar cell sizes (Slo+/+ 40 ± 4 pF, n = 17; Slo–/– 47 ± 3 pA/pF, n = 12; p > 0.05). We assessed voltage-gated (IBTX-insensitive) K+ currents using a depolarizing step protocol. Voltage-gated K+ current densities were similar at all voltages (Fig. 4B). Slo–/– UBSM voltage-gated K+ current was blocked by 60% with 10 mm tetraethylammonium ion (Fig. 4, C and D, TEA). These results are consistent with that reported for the mouse UBSM voltage-gated K+ current (15Thorneloe K.S. Nelson M.T. J. Physiol. 2003; 549: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Ca2+-activated, Spontaneous Transient Outward Currents Are Absent in Slo–/–Mice—BK channels are activated by elevations in intracellular calcium and in particular by local and transient calcium release (calcium sparks) through ryanodine receptors in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane (9Herrera G.M.

These are inhibited by 97% with IBTX (Fig. 5, A and D). Consistent with the lack of voltage-activated BK currents in UBSM cells of Slo–/– mice (Fig. 3), Ca2+-activated transient BK currents were not detected in Slo–/– mice (Fig. 5, A and D). These data indicate that the mSlo1 gene encodes the IBTX-sensitive BK channel activated by both voltage and calcium in UBSM. A lack of transient BK currents in Slo–/– mice could reflect ryanodine receptor (calcium spark) dysfunction. However, calcium sparks were unchanged in Slo–/– mice. UBSM cells from Slo+/+ and Slo–/– mice were loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive indicator fluo-4, and changes in intracellular Ca2+ were monitored using a laser-scanning confocal microscope. We observed local transient increases in Ca2+ in UBSM cells from both Slo+/+ and Slo–/– mice (Fig. 5, B and C), with spatial and temporal characteristics consistent with calcium sparks described previously (10Herrera G.M.

Furthermore, Ca2+ spark amplitude and frequency were not different between Slo+/+ and Slo–/– UBSM cells (Fig. 5, E and F), and there were no differences in the number of spark sites/UBSM cell (Slo+/+ 2.4 ± 0.5, n = 20; Slo–/– 2.4 ± 0.5, n = 12), Ca2+ spark duration (Slo+/+ 186 ± 17 ms, n = 62; Slo–/– 172 ± 19 ms, n = 62), or in the decay of Ca2+ spark events (time constants: Slo+/+ 138 ± 16 ms, n = 62; Slo–/– 128 ± 18 ms, n = 62). Slo–/–Demonstrate Enhanced UBSM Contractility Leading to Urinary Incontinence—We next addressed the functional role of BK channels in urinary bladder contractility utilizing isolated UBSM strips. UBSM strips exhibit spontaneous phasic contractions that are important for the maintenance of urinary bladder tone and, when enhanced, likely contribute to overactive bladder (31Christ G.J. Day N.S. Day M. Santizo C. Zhao W. Sclafani T. Zinman J. Hsieh K. Venkateswarlu K. Valcic M. Melman A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: R1699-R1709PubMed Google Scholar). Phasic contraction area, amplitude, and frequency were increased in Slo–/– over Slo+/+ mice (Fig. 6, A–C). Overall phasic contractile activity (frequency × area) was increased 4-fold in Slo–/– compared with Slo+/+ mice. Urine voiding (micturition) is caused by stimulation of parasympathetic nerves in the bladder wall. To explore the role of BK channels in nerve-mediated urinary bladder contraction, we utilized electrical field stimulation at a physiological frequency to selectively evoke neurotransmitter release in UBSM strips, thereby mimicking the excitation that occurs during micturition. Blocking BK channels with IBTX in Slo+/+ UBSM strips resulted in a 40% enhancement of nerve-mediated contractions, an effect that was absent in Slo–/– strips (Fig. 6, D and E). Nerve-mediated contractions of UBSM strips from Slo–/– mice were significantly greater than the force produced by Slo+/+ strips (Fig. 6, D and F). However, the contractile force elicited during membrane potential depolarization by elevating bathing (K+) to 60 mm was not different between Slo+/+ (5.7 ± 1.0 mN, n = 8) and Slo–/– strips (5.3 ± 0.9 mN, n = 8). Normalizing the nerve-mediated force to the K+-induced force in each UBSM strip indicated a 3-fold increase in nerve-mediated contractions in Slo–/– UBSM (Fig. 6G). Therefore, in addition to increased phasic contractility in Slo–/– mice (Fig. 6, A–C), nerve-mediated contractions are also dramatically enhanced when BK channels are absent (Fig. 6, D–G). The expression of BK channels in UBSM and the robust increase in UBSM contractility demonstrated by Slo–/– mice suggest that BK channels may be critical for normal bladder function in vivo. To test for urinary bladder overactivity in the absence of BK channels, the urination patterns of freely moving female Slo+/+ and Slo–/– mice were assessed. Slo+/+ mice produced an average of 2.4 ± 0.8-large diameter urine spots (>0.5 cm) in an hour, not significantly different from Slo–/– mice (Fig. 6, H–J, 2.3 ± 0.4). However, Slo–/– mice produced 8.8 times more small urine spots (<0.5 cm) than Slo+/+ mice. Additionally, Slo–/– mice exhibited yellow perineal staining (n = 10), which was absent in Slo+/+ littermate controls (n = 10). No significant differences in water intake (Slo+/+ 3.3 ± 0.1 ml/day, n = 5; Slo–/– 3.2 ± 0.3 ml/day, n = 10) or urine production, measured as urine-specific gravity (Slo+/+ 1.058 ± 0.006, n = 9; Slo–/– 1.072 ± 0.003, n = 7), were observed that could account for the increased urination frequency observed in Slo–/– mice. This suggests that the overactivity in Slo–/– bladders is not a result of increased urine production by the kidneys but is a functional deficit in the urinary bladder itself caused by the absence of BK channels. In this study, we have demonstrated that the absence of functional BK currents (Figs. 3, 4, 5) significantly enhances basal and nerve-mediated UBSM contractility (Fig. 6, A–G), leading to bladder overactivity and urinary incontinence (Fig. 6, H–J). BK channels normally activate in response to depolarization and increases in intracellular Ca2+ during UBSM action potentials, thereby limiting excitability and contractility. Without this feedback pathway, as in Slo–/– mice, excitability remains unchecked, leading to detrusor muscle instability, a primary cause of urinary incontinence. Currently, the underlying basis of human bladder detrusor instability is not well understood, and its etiology likely involves a number of interrelated factors. Our study suggests that BK channels could be a potent therapeutic target for both neurologic and myogenic causes of bladder dysfunction. The increased frequency of spontaneous contractions in Slo–/– mice suggests that enhancing feedback modulation by potentiating BK channels in patients with underlying myogenic causes for incontinence could alleviate bladder overactivity. Similarly, the increased force of contractions in response to a voiding stimulus in UBSM of Slo–/– mice suggests that individuals with neurologically caused incontinence would also benefit from BK channel augmentation. Consistent with this idea, delivery of hSlo1 cDNA into rat urinary bladder decreased bladder overactivity caused by partial urethral outlet obstruction (31Christ G.J. Day N.S. Day M. Santizo C.

Thus, the development of selective BK channel activators (3Butera J.A. Antane S.A. Hirth B. Lennox J.R. Sheldon J.H. Norton N.W. Warga D. Argentieri T.M. Bioorg. Med. Chem.

Mammalian FOXO proteins also play important roles in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, stress resistance, and energy metabolism. In this study, we generated Foxo1-deficient mice to investigate the physiological role of FOXO1. The Foxo1-deficient mice died around embryonic day 11 because of defects in the branchial arches and remarkably impaired vascular development of embryos and yolk sacs. In vitro differentiation of embryonic stem cells demonstrated that endothelial cells derived from wild-type and Foxo1-deficient embryonic stem cells were able to produce comparable numbers of colonies supported by a layer of OP9 stromal cells. Although the morphology of the endothelial cell colonies was identical in both genotypes in the absence of exogenous vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Foxo1-deficient endothelial cells showed a markedly different morphological response compared with wild-type endothelial cells in the presence of exogenous VEGF. These results suggest that Foxo1 is essential to the ability of endothelial cells to respond properly to a high dose of VEGF, thereby playing a critical role in normal vascular development.

The Foxo family is one of the forkhead-type transcription factor families and is unique in that its members are downstream components of the insulin signaling pathway involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (1Brunet A.

They are also mammalian homologs of the daf-16 gene in Caenorhabditis elegans, which is essential for the extension of life span and dauer formation in C. elegans. DAF-16 confers resistance to stress such as heat and UV light, and dauer formation is observed under adverse conditions such as food deprivation (2Ogg S. Paradis S. Gottlieb S. Patterson G.I. Lee L.

Just as in C. elegans, in mammals, the Foxo family functions to regulate the transcription of genes involved in stress resistance and energy metabolism. Genes regulated by FOXO proteins are grouped into four categories. The first group includes the genes for proteins involved in cell cycle arrest and DNA repair such as p27 and GADD45 (4Medema R.H.

The second group is made up of genes whose products are related to apoptosis such as FasL and Bim (1Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J.

The third group comprises genes for proteins related to resistance to oxidative stress such as manganese-containing superoxide dismutase and catalase (8Kops G.J. Dansen T.B. Polderman P.E.

The last group is composed of genes whose products are involved in energy metabolism such as glucose-6-phosphatase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and insulin-like growth factor-1-binding protein-1 (10Nakae J.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3140-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We previously reported that each member of the Foxo family (Foxo1 (Fkhr), Foxo3 (Fkhrl1), and Foxo4 (Afx)) show a tissue-specific and developmentally specific expression pattern (14Furuyama T. Nakazawa T. Nakano I. Mori N. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Foxo4 mRNA is abundant in skeletal muscle throughout life, whereas Foxo1 mRNA is abundantly found in adipose tissues. Foxo3a mRNA is scant during ontogeny, but becomes abundant after birth (14Furuyama T. Nakazawa T. Nakano I. Mori N. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies showed that FOXO1 plays important roles in the differentiation of adipocytes and in the myotube fusion of myoblasts in vitro (15Nakae J. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It is therefore suggested that each member plays a distinct role in a tissue-specific and developmentally specific manner in vivo. Indeed, studies using Foxo1 transgenic mice and heterozygous Foxo1-deficient mice showed that FOXO1 is involved in the differentiation of beta-cells in the pancreas and energy metabolism (15Nakae J.

In this study, we generated Foxo1-null mice to address the role of FOXO1 in vivo. Foxo1-null mice died at around embryonic day (E) 1The abbreviations used are: E, embryonic day; ES, embryonic stem; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; VE-cadherin, vascular endothelial cadherin; RT, reverse transcription; PFA, paraformaldehyde; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PECAM-1, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1. 1The abbreviations used are: E, embryonic day; ES, embryonic stem; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; VE-cadherin, vascular endothelial cadherin; RT, reverse transcription; PFA, paraformaldehyde; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PECAM-1, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1. 11. We found abnormal angiogenesis in the yolk sacs and embryos as well as underdevelopment of branchial arches at around E9.5. Endothelial cells differentiated from embryonic stem (ES) cells lacking Foxo1 showed a morphologically abnormal response to exogenous vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), viz. a flat polygonal morphology in contrast to the elongated spindle-like shape of wild-type endothelial cells. These results suggest that FOXO1 plays a critical role in qualitatively controlling the VEGF signaling pathway and is necessary for normal development of the vascular system early in life. Targeted Disruption of the Foxo1 Gene—A 625-bp probe starting from the ATG codon of the mouse Foxo1 gene was used to screen a 129SVJ genomic library (Stratagene). Analysis of several overlapping clones revealed that the first coding exon including the ATG codon ends 625 bp after the ATG codon. Further phage analysis revealed that the rest of the coding exons are not located within at least 15 kb downstream from the first coding exon. To construct a targeting vector, a 5-kb EcoRV-NotI fragment whose 3′-end terminated 330 bp upstream of the ATG codon was used as the 5′-arm. A 4.2-kb loxP-PGKneo-poly(A)-loxP-FOXO1-3A-poly(A) cassette, in which FOXO1-3A is a constitutively active form of the FOXO1 protein in terms of transcriptional activity, was used to replace a 2.5-kb sequence including a 1-kb sequence 3′ to the first NotI site in the first exon and a 1.5-kb intronic sequence following the first exon. A downstream 1.1-kb PCR fragment was used as the 3′-arm. Finally, a 1.3-kb cassette containing the diphtheria toxin A chain gene was added to the 3′-end of the 3′-arm to facilitate negative selection. The plasmid was linearized with KpnI and electroporated into ES cells. Cells were selected with G418 (Invitrogen). G418-resistant clones were screened by PCR with primers for the sequence flanking the 1.2-kb short arm to confirm a corrective recombination of the 3′-arm. Normal (2.1 kb) and targeted (7.4 kb) loci were distinguished by NsiI digestion when probed with a 300-bp SacI genomic fragment for 3′-arm recombination (Fig. 1B). Normal (7.5 kb) and targeted (6.3 kb) loci were distinguished by XbaI digestion when probed with a 400-bp SacI-XbaI genomic fragment for 5′-arm recombination (Fig. 1B). Six correctly targeted ES cell clones were expanded, microinjected into C57BL/6J blastocysts, and transferred to the uteri of pseudopregnant ICR mice. Chimeric animals were backcrossed onto a C57BL/6J background to screen for germ line transmission. Chimeric males from two independent clones passed the mutant allele to offspring, and the animals from two lines showed identical phenotypes. Tail biopsy or yolk sack genomic DNA was amplified by PCR with primers specific for the wild-type allele and the target (wild-type Foxo1, 5′-GCAGAGATTAGCCTTCACGGCATG-3′ (upper) and 5′-TCTATGCTACAACTGATGGCATGG-3′ (lower); and targeted allele, 5′-TCTTCACAATGCCGCCTGAAAGGC-3′ (upper) and 5′-TCTATGCTACAACTGATGGCATGG-3′ (lower)). To confirm the deficiency of FOXO1 protein, Western blot analysis was performed for proteins of whole embryos at E9.5. They were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm NaF), and aliquots of the proteins were separated on 7.5% reducing polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.). The blots were analyzed using a specific antibody against FKHR (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and a standard chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). The generation of ES cells homozygous for the targeted allele was performed using higher concentrations of G418 (18Mortensen R.M. Conner D.A. Chao S. Geisterfer-Lowrance A.A. Seidman J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2391-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). One cell line heterozygous for the targeted allele was cultured in medium supplemented with 1.2, 1.8, 2.4, 3.0, or 3.6 mg/ml G418. Thirty-three colonies were picked up from the plate with 3.6 mg/ml G418 after selection for 11 days and expanded. The genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed by Southern blotting using the probe specific for Foxo1 described above. Only one was cloned. In Vitro Differentiation of ES Cells—In vitro differentiation of ES cells was induced as described previously (19Matsumura K. Hirashima M. Ogawa M. Kubo H. Hisatsune H. Kondo N. Nishikawa S. Chiba T. Blood. 2003; 101: 1367-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In brief, 5 × 104 ES cells were inoculated into a 25-cm2 culture flask preseeded with OP9 stromal cells and cultured for 5 days in induction medium (α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 5 × 10-5 mol/liter 2-mercaptoethanol) in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor. Cultured cells were dissociated with cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen) and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-CD31 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Pharmingen) and allophyco-cyanin-conjugated anti-vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) mAb (20Matsuyoshi N. Toda K. Horiguchi Y. Tanaka T. Nakagawa S. Takeichi M. Imamura S. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1997; 109: 362-371PubMed Google Scholar). CD31+ and VE-cadherin+ endothelial cells were sorted using a FACSVantage cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Then, 1 × 103 sorted endothelial cells/well were inoculated into either 6-well culture plates or 2-well culture slides preseeded with OP9 stromal cells. Cells were cultured for 3 days in induction medium in the presence or absence of exogenous human VEGF-A165 (Genzyme) and subjected to immunostaining of endothelial cell colonies. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was purified from embryos and the yolk sacs of wild-type and Foxo1-null embryos at E9.5 (n = 3) using TRIzol (Invitrogen). After an RT reaction using Super-Script II (Invitrogen), quantitative PCR analysis of several genes involved in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis was performed using a QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (QIAGEN Inc.); oligonucleotides specific for angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2, VEGF, Flt-1, Flk-1, Tie-1, Tie-2, EphB3, EphB4, ephrin-B2, connexin-37, connexin-40, connexin-43, and smooth muscle α-actin (Proligo Japan); and a Light Cycler system (Roche Applied Science). The following conditions were used: 95 °C for 15 min and 25 cycles at 94 °C for 10 s, 58 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 20 s. The amount of RT reaction product was controlled on the basis of the expression level of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase housekeeping gene. For confirmation of Foxo1 mRNA expression, RT-PCR for Foxo1 was performed using PCR primers specific for Foxo1 (upper, 5′-ACGAACTCGGAGGCTCCTTAGACAC-3′; and lower, 5′-GACTGGAGGTGGTCGAGTTGGACTG-3′) under the following conditions: 94 °C for 2 min; 35 cycles at 94 °C for 10 s, 63 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s; and 72 °C for 2 min. RNA loading was controlled by amplification of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase house-keeping gene. Negative controls were performed for each sample using non-reverse-transcribed RNA. Histology—For histological analysis, embryos were embedded in paraffin after fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Transverse sections were made at 7-μm intervals throughout the embryos and stained with hematoxylin/eosin solution. In Situ Hybridization—Whole mount in situ hybridization was carried out as described previously (21Yoshikawa Y. Fujimori T. McMahon A.P. Takada S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 234-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Embryos were collected in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 4% PFA in PBS at 4 °C for 3 h, washed with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST), dehydrated, and stored in methanol at -20 °C until used. After being bleached with 6% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 2 h at room temperature, embryos were rehydrated though a 75, 50, 25, and 0% methanol and PBST series. Embryos were incubated with 20 μg/ml proteinase K in PBST for 6 min at E8.5∼9.0 or for 9 min at E9.5 and refixed in 4% PFA and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 20 min. After incubation in hybridization buffer at 63 °C for >4 h, embryos were incubated in the same buffer containing 0.5 μg/ml digoxigenin-labeled RNA probe (Roche Applied Science) at 63 °C for 18 h. The hybridization buffer used and the steps for probe washing, RNase reaction, and RNase inactivation were as described previously (21Yoshikawa Y. Fujimori T. McMahon A.P. Takada S. Dev.

After incubation with 10% heat-inactivated goat serum and 2 mm levamisole (Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), embryos were treated with 0.24 units/ml anti-digoxigenin Fab fragments (Roche Applied Science) in TBST for2hat4 °C. After a thorough washing with 2 mm levamisole in TBST, embryos were treated with 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, and 2 mm levamisole for 40 min, and hybridization products were visualized using BM Purple (Roche Applied Science) as a substrate. The Foxo1 and Crabp1 (cellular retinoic acid-binding protein-1) probe regions used in the in situ study were as described previously (14Furuyama T. Nakazawa T. Nakano I. Mori N. Biochem.

Immunochemistry—Whole mount immunohistochemistry was performed with mAb MEC13.3 (rat anti-mouse platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) antibody, Pharmingen) as described previously (23Kataoka H.

Embryos were fixed in 2% PFA and PBS at 4 °C for 1 h and dehydrated in methanol. Embryos were bleached in 5% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 min at 4 °C. This was followed by rehydration and blocking in PBS containing 3% skim milk and 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBSMT) at 4 °C twice for 1 h. Embryos were incubated overnight in 10 μg/ml anti-mouse PECAM-1 antibody in PBSMT at 4 °C, washed with PBSMT at 4 °C, and incubated overnight with horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated antibody in PBSMT at 4 °C. Embryos were again washed with PBSMT at 4 °C and rinsed in PBST at room temperature for 20 min. For detecting signals, embryos were incubated in 0.3 mg/ml diaminobenzidine (Sigma) in PBST containing 0.5% NiCl for 20 min; hydrogen peroxide was added to a final concentration of 0.015%; and the embryos were incubated for 20–30 min. The staining reaction was terminated by rinsing the embryos in PBST. Embryos were post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA and PBS at 4 °C. To better observe the vasculature, embryos were dehydrated through graded solutions up to 100% methanol. For the immunochemistry of endothelial cell colonies, 6-well culture plates were fixed in 2% PFA and stained first with purified anti-VE-cadherin mAb (Zymed Laboratories Inc.)and then with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rat IgG antibody (BIOSOURCE). VE-cadherin+ endothelial cell colonies were revealed by the diaminobenzidine/NiCl substrate. For confocal microscopy, 2-well culture slides were fixed in 2% PFA and stained with anti-VE-cadherin mAb. VE-cadherin were immunolocalized by Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-rat IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Confocal microscopic images of endothelial cell colonies were taken using an Olympus Fluoview laser scanning microscope. Expression of Foxo1 in Embryos—Whole mount in situ hybridization at E8.5 revealed remarkable expression of Foxo1 in the neural crest cells migrating toward branchial arches and in the putative somites (Fig. 2A). The expression of Foxo1 was subsequently down-regulated and localized to the first and second branchial arches and putative somites at E9.0 and E9.5 (Fig. 2, B–E). The expression of Foxo1 was also observed in the intersomitic vessel, although it could not be determined whether the expression was localized to the endothelial cells (Fig. 2, D and E). The expression of Foxo1 in the yolk sac was below the detection limit of the in situ hybridization technique. However, RT-PCR confirmed the expression in the yolk sac at E9.5 (Fig. 2F). Targeted Inactivation of the Foxo1 Gene—The replacement vector disrupts the coding sequence by inserting a loxP-PGK-neo-poly(A)-loxP-FOXO1-3A-poly(A) cassette into the locus (Fig. 1, A and B). This deletes a portion of the first intron (including the splice donor) and the first 208 codons of the first coding exon, which encodes the N-terminal half of the forkhead domain of FOXO1. Mice heterozygous for the targeted allele were fertile and exhibited no obvious abnormalities. Heterozygous intercrosses yielded no viable offspring that were homozygous for the targeted allele (Foxo1-/-), consistent with a lethal embryonic phenotype (Table I). The first Foxo1-/- embryos were identified at E11.5, having been reabsorbed. Viable embryos were found at E10.5 with beating hearts, but with significant growth retardation. At E9.5, the distribution of Foxo1-/- embryos approached the expected mendelian frequencies (Table I). Analysis of embryonic mRNA by RT-PCR revealed Foxo1 transcripts of the expected length in wild-type embryos, but not in Foxo1-/- embryos (Fig. 1C). Because an ∼75-kDa band of FOXO1 protein detectable in wild-type embryos could not be identified in Foxo1-/- embryos by Western blot analyses (Fig. 1D), we concluded that no complete form of FOXO1 protein was synthesized in Foxo1-/- embryos.Table IGenotypes of mice resulting from matings of heterozygous FKHR+/-miceGenotypeFKHR+/+FKHR+/-FKHR-/-9.5 days postcoitusaGenotyping of three embryos in the 9.5-day postcoitus group was inconclusiveObserved293916Expected22442210.5 days postcoitusbGenotype of one embryo was inconclusiveObserved6169cEight of nine FKHR-/- embryos were abnormal and underwent absorptionExpected8168Live birthsObserved12170Expected7147a Genotyping of three embryos in the 9.5-day postcoitus group was inconclusiveb Genotype of one embryo was inconclusivec Eight of nine FKHR-/- embryos were abnormal and underwent absorption Open table in a new tab Abnormal Development of Branchial Arches and Aortic Arch Vessels in Foxo1-/-Embryos—At E9.0, wild-type and mutant embryos were indistinguishable in size; but after E9.5, Foxo1-/- embryos exhibited apparent growth retardation (Fig. 2, G and H). By E9.5, mutant embryos had developed a small first branchial arch, but no second branchial arch, and often exhibited marked pericardial swelling (Fig. 2, H and J). Since cranial neural crest cells significantly contribute to the formation of the branchial arches, we followed the pathway of crest cells using whole mount in situ hybridization with a Crabp1 probe as a specific marker for neural crest cells at E9.5. Specific staining in three well defined streams of representing cells migrating ventrally toward the arches could be seen in both wild-type and mutant embryos (Fig. 2, I and J). Histological analysis of transverse sections of E9.5 Foxo1-deficient embryos revealed that the dorsal aorta was severely underdeveloped and irregularly formed. Hypoplasia of branchial arches and aortic arch arteries was also observed (Fig. 2, K and L). To examine the extent of vascularization of Foxo1-deficient embryos, we performed whole mount immunohistochemical staining at E8.5–9.5 using a mAb against the endothelium-specific marker PECAM-1. We found that the differentiated endothelial cells were present at E8.5 at sites consistent with blood vessel development (Fig. 3A) and that the formation of the dorsal aorta was unaffected by the defect in the Foxo1 gene (Fig. 3B). However, there was no evidence of the aortic arch arteries arising from the aortic sacs in the mutant embryos (Fig. 3D), whereas the first and second aortic arch arteries were readily apparent in E9.5 wild-type embryos (Fig. 3C). The lack of aortic arch vessels most likely resulted in the severe cardiac failure as evidenced by the collection of a large pericardial effusion, with embryonic death occurring soon thereafter. Moreover, the capillary bed appeared dilated and apparently arrested at the primary plexus stage in the heads of mutant embryos (Fig. 3, E and F). Abnormal Vascular Remodeling in the Yolk Sacs of Foxo1-/-Embryos—The vitelline circulation in the embryonic yolk sac represents the earliest circulatory system and is the first site of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis in the embryo. As shown in Fig. 3 (G and H), the wild-type yolk sacs appeared to have a vasculature, but the Foxo1-deficient yolk sacs were pale and had no clear vasculature. The visceral endoderm and mesoderm forming the yolk sacs were not fused except at discrete foci, giving the yolk sacs of Foxo1 mutants a characteristic appearance (Fig. 3H), with large cavities present in the mutant yolk sacs that were lined by endothelial cells and that contained blood cells. PECAM-1 labeling revealed that endothelial cells were present in both wild-type and Foxo1-deficient yolk sacs at E8.75 (Fig. 3, I and J). Normally, a honeycomb-like vascular plexus was evident by E8.75 (Fig. 3I), and subsequent remodeling of the vasculature (angiogenesis) resulted in the formation of large vitelline vessels and a fine network of smaller vessels by E9.5 (Fig. 3K). Foxo1-deficient yolk sacs showed a honeycomb-like vascular plexus similar to that of wild-type yolk sacs at E8.75 (Fig. 3J), but failed to develop a normal vasculature at E9.5 (Fig. 3L). Histological analysis revealed that no distinct blood vessels were evident in the Foxo1-deficient yolk sacs (Fig. 3N), whereas endothelial cell-lined capillary-like vessels containing blood cells were seen in the wild-type yolk sacs (Fig. 3M). All together, the above evidence suggests that vasculogenesis (but not angiogenesis) proceeds without functional FOXO1. To determine whether other molecules contributed to the impaired angiogenesis in the mutants, we examined the expression of several factors and receptors involved in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. By quantitative RT-PCR analysis, transcripts of VEGF, Flt-1, Flk-1, angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2, Tie-1, Tie-2, EphB2, EphB3, EphB4, connexin-43, connexin-45, and smooth muscle α-actin were detected at similar levels, with no statistical significance in wild-type and Foxo1-/- yolk sacs at E9.5 (Fig. 4). On the other hand, the expression levels of connexin-37, connexin-40, and ephrin-B2 in Foxo1-deficient yolk sacs were significantly reduced to ∼10, 1, and 35% of the wild-type levels, respectively (p < 0.01). It is possible that the vascular defects in the Foxo1-deficient yolk sacs are due in part to the reduction of expression of the specific connexins and ephrin among the molecules examined. However, we cannot eliminate the possibility of changes in unidentified gene expression in specific regions of mutant embryos. Expression of Foxo1 Transcripts in Endothelial Cells Derived from ES Cells—We demonstrated the presence of Foxo1 transcripts in the yolk sac (Fig. 2F), although the localization could not be determined by in situ hybridization. We examined the expression of the Foxo1 gene in the endothelial cell lineage using an in vitro differentiation system composed of ES cells. Foxo1+/+ and Foxo1-/- ES cells were co-cultured with OP9 stromal cells to induce differentiation of endothelial cells. Under the culture conditions used in this study, the frequency of endothelial cells among the differentiating ES cells was almost comparable between cultures initiated from Foxo1+/+ and Foxo1-/- ES cells (data not shown). CD31+ and VE-cadherin+ endothelial cells were purified using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter and subjected to RT-PCR analysis for the expression of several genes. Foxo1 transcripts were detected in the endothelial cells derived from Foxo1+/+ (but not Foxo1-/-) ES cells (Fig. 5A, panel a), suggesting that Foxo1 has some functional role in the endothelial cell lineage. Consistent with the observations in the yolk sac described above, transcripts of Flt-1, Flk-1, Flt-4, Tie-1, and Tie-2 were detected at similar levels in Foxo1+/+ and Foxo1-/- endothelial cells (Fig. 5A, panel b), indicating that the expression of these molecules does not depend upon Foxo1.

However, the molecular mechanisms whereby these cytokines and hormones inhibit insulin signaling are not completely understood. We observed that several cytokines and hormones that induce insulin resistance also stimulate SOCS3 expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and that SOCS3 mRNA is increased in adipose tissue of obese/diabetic mice. We then hypothesized that SOCS3 may mediate cytokine- and hormone-induced insulin resistance. By using SOCS3-deficient adipocytes differentiated from mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we found that SOCS3 deficiency increases insulin-stimulated IRS1 and IRS2 phosphorylation, IRS-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Moreover, lack of SOCS3 substantially limits the inhibitory effects of tumor necrosis factor-α to suppress IRS1 and IRS2 tyrosine phosphorylation, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, and glucose uptake in adipocytes. The ameliorated insulin signaling in SOCS3-deficient adipocytes is mainly due to the suppression of tumor necrosis factor-α-induced IRS1 and IRS2 protein degradation. Therefore, our data suggest that endogenous SOCS3 expression is a key determinant of basal insulin signaling and is an important molecular mediator of cytokine-induced insulin resistance in adipocytes. We conclude that SOCS3 plays an important role in mediating insulin resistance and may be an excellent target for therapeutic intervention in insulin resistance and type II diabetes.

We conclude that SOCS3 plays an important role in mediating insulin resistance and may be an excellent target for therapeutic intervention in insulin resistance and type II diabetes. Insulin resistance is a fundamental aspect of the etiology of type II diabetes, a prevalent and serious metabolic disorder worldwide (1Kahn B.B. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (2411) Google Scholar). Insulin resistance is also commonly seen with obesity (1Kahn B.B. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (2411) Google Scholar). One of the major links between the two disorders is proinflammatory cytokines (1Kahn B.B. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (2411) Google Scholar). Increased production of proinflammatory cytokines in obesity has been causally linked to insulin resistance (2Hotamisligil G.S. Int. J.

Although the role of proinflammatory cytokines in mediating insulin resistance has drawn extensive attention, the molecular mechanisms whereby most cytokines inhibit insulin signaling are incompletely understood.Many cytokines stimulate the tissue-specific expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling proteins (SOCSs), a group of signaling proteins characterized by their ability to down-regulate cytokine signaling (6Krebs D. Hilton D.J. Stem Cells. 2001; 19: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). The SOCS protein family includes eight members (CIS and SOCS1 to SOCS7), and each member contains a central SH2 domain and a conserved C-terminal SOCS box (7Endo T.A. Masuhara M. Yokouchi M.

Cytokine binding to its receptor activates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, leading to induction of SOCS mRNA and protein. Induced SOCS proteins in turn inhibit cytokine signaling (10Krebs D.L. Hilton D.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2813-2819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SOCS proteins bind directly via their SH2 domains to tyrosine-phosphorylated JAK or activated cytokine receptors to suppress cytokine signaling (10Krebs D.L. Hilton D.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2813-2819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An additional mechanism by which SOCS proteins inhibit signaling involves targeted proteasomal degradation of signaling proteins, via a SOCS box-mediated ubiquitination complex (11Zhang J.G.

Leptin induces SOCS3, which in turn inhibits leptin signaling (13Bjørbæk C. El-Haschimi K. Frantz J.D. Flier J.S. J. Biol.

Accordingly, this study was designed to determine the role of endogenous SOCS3 in setting the level of insulin signaling and mediating adipocyte insulin resistance in response to external factors. In this study, we established an Socs3-deficient adipocyte model, using adipocytes differentiated from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from wild-type or Socs3-deficient embryos. We found that SOCS3 deficiency increases insulin-stimulated IRS1 and IRS2 phosphorylation, enhances downstream PI 3-kinase activity, and leads to increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Moreover, SOCS3 deficiency blocks TNFα-induced inhibition of insulin signaling, and this is largely attributed to the suppression of TNFα-induced IRS1 and IRS2 protein degradation. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the level of SOCS3 expression is a determinant of insulin signaling and is a mediator of cytokine-induced insulin resistance in adipocytes. Because SOCS3 plays an important role in mediating both leptin and insulin resistance, it could be a unique mediator of both obesity and the associated metabolic syndrome.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Reagents—The rabbit SOCS3 antiserum was generated as described previously (13Bjørbæk C. El-Haschimi K. Frantz J.D. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30059-30065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), and goat polyclonal anti-SOCS3 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-IR, IRS-1, and IRS2 antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Ronald Kahn or purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Protein A-agarose, rabbit polyclonal anti-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ antibody, and goat polyclonal anti-SCD1 antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal anti-GLUT4 antibody was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10, rabbit polyclonal anti-p85, rabbit polyclonal anti-Akt1, and rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-Akt1 (Ser-473) antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. TNFα, IFNγ, interleukin-6, growth hormone, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, dexamethasone, insulin, and lactacystin were all purchased from Sigma. 2-Deoxy-3H-glucose was from Amersham Biosciences.Cell Culture—Murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were propagated in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS (growth medium). Confluent preadipocytes were induced to differentiate with DMEM containing 10% FBS supplemented with 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 200 nm insulin (differentiation medium). Cells were incubated in this differentiation medium for 2 days and then cultured in growth medium containing 200 nm insulin for another 2 days. Subsequently, cells were maintained in growth medium throughout the adipocyte stage and cultures were refed every 3 days.Primary MEFs for three Socs3 genotypes (Socs +/+, +/-, and -/-) were generated from 10- to 12-day embryos by crossing heterozygous Socs3 mice, according to a modified 3T3 protocol (19Todaro G.T. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1994) Google Scholar). Briefly, embryos were dissected, and the heads were removed and used for genotyping. The remaining bodies whose visceral organs had been removed were minced and digested in trypsin-EDTA buffer (2.5 g of trypsin, 0.4 g of EDTA, 7 g of NaCl, 0.3 g of Na2HPO4, 0.24 g of KH2PO4, 0.37 g of KCl, 1 g of d-glucose, 3.0 g of Tris-base, 1 ml of phenol red, and H2O added to 1 liter, pH 7.6) at 37 °C with occasional shaking for 30 min. Disassociated cells from individual embryos were collected by centrifugation and cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS in T75 flasks. Forty eight h later, adherent cells were split into 100-mm plates at a density of 1.2 × 106/plate. Cells were then cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS supplemented with 10% preconditioned medium (1st passage medium saved) (growth medium) and split every 3 days at the density indicated above. Cells were frozen at low passages (<5) for future experiments. For differentiation, confluent monolayers of MEFs were induced to differentiate with a differentiation medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS supplemented with 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 μm dexamethasone, 1.7 μm insulin, and 10 μm troglitazone. Cells were renewed in this medium every 3 days. On day 9, cells were switched to the above medium in which 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and troglitazone were withdrawn and were then maintained in this medium until the appearance of cytoplasmic lipid accumulation. Cells were then changed to growth medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS only and were ready for use. Five independent lineages from each genotype were generated and evaluated for differentiation efficiency.Total RNA Extraction and Quantitative RT-PCR—Adipocyte total RNA was extracted by using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and underwent DNase I treatment (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mouse adipocyte SOCS3 mRNA was quantitatively measured using a Stratagene Mx 4000 Multiplex Quantitative PCR system (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX) with a Brilliant Single-Step Quantitative RT-PCR kit (Stratagene), as described previously (20Shi H. Norman A.W. Ojamura W.H. Sen A. Zemel M.B. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1808-1810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primers and probe for the mouse Socs3 (GenBank™ accession number 88328.1) measurement are as follows: forward primer, 5′-gcgggcacctttcttatcc-3′; reverse primer, 5′-tccccgactgggtcttgac-3′; and probe, 5′-FAM-tcggaccagcgccacttcttcac-BHQ-1–3′. A pooled mouse adipocyte total RNA was serially diluted in the range of 0.1–100 ng and was used to established an SOCS3 standard curve; total RNA for unknown samples was also diluted in this range. Reactions of real time RT-PCR for standards and unknown samples were performed according to the instructions for the Stratagene Mx 4000 quantitative RT-PCR system and single-step quantitative RT-PCT kit (Stratagene). The SOCS3 mRNA quantitation was further normalized by the corresponding cyclophilin mRNA measurement as follows: forward primer, 5′-ggtggagagcaccaagacaga-3′; reverse primer, 5′-gccggagtcgacaatgatg-3′; and probe, 5′-HEX-agccgggacaagccactgaaggat-BHQ-1–3′.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Adipocytes were harvested and homogenized in a modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μm Na3VO3, 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 1% phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cell homogenates were incubated on ice for 45 min to solubilize all proteins, and insoluble portions were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Two mg of cell lysate was incubated overnight with the appropriate antibodies and protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C with constant gentle mixing. Agarose beads were collected by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer three times and phosphate-buffered saline two times, and then boiled in 2× Laemmli sample buffer for denaturation of proteins.For immunoblotting, proteins from immunoprecipitates or whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins on the gels were transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The transferred membranes were blocked, washed, and incubated with various primary antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Visualization was detected with chemiluminescence reagent, using the ECL Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were quantified by using densitometry (Amersham Biosciences).PI 3-Kinase Assay—Two mg of cell lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-IRS1 antibody. The immunoprecipitates were used to determine the IRS1-associated PI 3-kinase activity, using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit according to the company's instructions (Echelon, Salt Lake City, UT).Glucose Transport Assay—MEFs were grown and differentiated in 12-well plates. At least 1 week before the assay, insulin was withdrawn from the medium; 72 h prior to the assay, the glucose concentration was reduced to 5 mm in the medium. MEF adipocytes were incubated overnight in serum-free DMEM with or without 1 nm TNFα. Cells were then incubated in KRH buffer (129 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) with or without 100 nm insulin for 20 min. To start the glucose transport, 1 μCi of 2-deoxy-[3H]glucose was added to each well and incubated for 10 min. To stop the transport, cells were rinsed with ice-cold KRH buffer three times and lysed with 0.1% SDS. Cell lysates were added to scintillation vials with 5 ml of scintillation liquid and counted. One well of cells from each treatment group included 50 μm cytochalasin B to determine nonspecific transport, which was subtracted from each sample.Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Data were evaluated for statistical significance by one-way analysis of variance, and significantly different group means were then separated by the least significant difference test using SPSS (Chicago). p < 0.05 is considered as significant.RESULTSSOCS3 mRNA Is Elevated in Fat Depots of Obese/Diabetic and Diet-induced Obesity (DIO) Mice—To assess the potential relevance of SOCS3 in mediating insulin resistance, we quantitated SOCS3 mRNA in fat depots of obese/diabetic and DIO mice. Fig. 1a shows that SOCS3 mRNA was increased in subcutaneous, epididymal, and mesenteric fat pads of ob/ob and db/db mice, compared with WT control. Similar results were observed in DIO mice (Fig. 1b). These data suggest that SOCS3 mRNA expression is increased in adipose tissue of mice with genetic and acquired obesity.SOCS3 mRNA Expression Is Increased by Hormones and Cytokines in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—We tested the effects of several hormones and cytokines, which have been shown to be involved in insulin resistance, on SOCS3 mRNA expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Fig. 2, a and b, shows that several hormones, including insulin, growth hormone (GH), angiotensin II (AT II), and cytokines including TNFα, IL6, and IFNγ, did indeed stimulate SOCS3 mRNA expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Dexamethasone and leptin had no effect (data not shown). Although TNFα and insulin caused a slow but relatively sustained stimulation of SOCS3 expression, IL6, IFNγ, AT II, and GH stimulated a more rapid increase of SOCS3 mRNA that was less sustained. These data suggest that up-regulation of SOCS3 may contribute to the insulin resistance caused by inflammatory cytokines and hormones.Fig. 2Regulation of SOCS3 mRNA in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by cytokines and hormones. 3T3-L1 cells were cultured and differentiated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum-free for 12 h and then treated with (b) cytokines including TNFα (10 ng/ml), IL6 (5 ng/ml), and IFNγ (100 ng/ml) and (a) hormones including insulin (100 nm), GH (100 nm), and AT II (1 μm) in a time course indicated in the figures. Adipose tissue total RNA was isolated, and SOCS3 mRNA was measured using real time RT-PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All data are expressed as mean ± S.E.

Cell. 1999; 98: 617-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), we utilized MEFs as a cell model to explore further the role of SOCS3 in adipocyte insulin signaling. MEFs can be differentiated at 60–70% as shown by Oil Red O staining (Fig. 3a). Although MEFs of three genotypes (+/+, +/-, and -/-) underwent similar differentiation, as revealed by lipid accumulation and by the equal expression of adipocyte-phenotypic genes (Fig. 3b), Wt, Het, and Ko MEFs exhibited differential SOCS3 expression (Fig. 3c). Real time RT-PCR measurement showed that SOCS3 mRNA was not detectable in Ko MEFs, whereas SOCS3 expression in Het MEFs was decreased by 50%, compared with that in Wt cells (Fig. 3c, lower panel). Similar results were observed when SOCS3 protein levels were measured by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot (Fig. 3c, upper panel). Moreover, Het MEFs exhibited less SOCS3 mRNA expression in response to TNFα treatment, compared with Wt MEFs. TNFα treatment caused a 10-fold increase of SOCS3 mRNA in Wt MEFs, whereas TNFα stimulated less SOCS3 expression in Het MEFs, which showed a 5-fold increase (Fig. 3d). Therefore, these MEFs are a useful cell model for studying the role of endogenous SOCS3 in insulin signaling in adipocytes.Fig. 3Establishment of an SOCS3-deficient adipocyte model.a, Oil Red O staining of differentiated Wt (+/+), Het (+/-), and Ko (-/-) MEFs.

In Wt adipocytes, insulin stimulated 2-deoxy-[3H]glucose uptake by 3-fold, whereas insulin stimulated a 4-fold increase of glucose uptake in Ko adipocytes (Fig. 4). Moreover, lack of SOCS3 attenuated TNFα-induced inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Pretreatment of Wt adipocytes with TNFα for 12 h caused a 50% reduction of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, whereas TNFα only exerted a 25% inhibition of glucose uptake in Ko adipocytes (Fig. 4). Het adipocytes exhibited an intermediate increase in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and attenuation on inhibition of TNFα on glucose uptake (Fig. 4). These data demonstrate a gene dosage effect for the relationship between SOCS3 expression and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in both the presence and absence of TNFα.Fig. 4SOCS3 deficiency increases insulin-stimulated 2-deoxy-[3H]glucose uptake. MEFs were generated and differentiated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Adipocytes were pretreated with TNFα (1 nm) for 12 h, and glucose transport assay was conducted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are expressed as mean ± S.E.

Fig. 5a shows that insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IR remains at the same level among three genotypes, demonstrating that SOCS3 deficiency does not alter IR phosphorylation in these cells. However, insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS1 was increased in Ko and Het MEFs by 50 and 20%, respectively, compared with Wt adipocytes (Fig. 5b). This suggests that IRS might be a major signaling molecule through which SOCS3 targets insulin signaling in adipocytes.Fig. 5SOCS3 deficiency increases insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS1.a, SOCS3 deficiency does not alter insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IR. Adipocytes were serum-free for 16 h and stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 5 min. IR protein was immunoprecipitated (IP) and immunoblotted (IB) with IR and phosphotyrosine antibodies. b, SOCS3 deficiency increases insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS1. The experiments were performed as described in a except using IRS1 antibody. The blot is a representative of three similar experiments. Blots were quantified using a densitometry. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E.

This was substantially attenuated in Ko and Het adipocytes, which showed approximately a 40% inhibition. In the TNFα treatment groups, in fact, the absolute levels of insulin-stimulated IRS1 phosphorylation in Het and Ko MEFs were increased by 2–3-fold, compared with Wt adipocytes. As shown in Fig. 6a (right panel), TNFα treatment reduced the IRS1 protein level by 80% in Wt adipocytes, whereas TNFα exerted less inhibitory effects on IRS1 protein levels in Ko and Het adipocytes, with approximately a 40% inhibition. These data indicate that IRS1 phosphorylation is well matched with IRS1 protein levels in the TNFα treatment study, suggesting that the protection of TNFα-induced IRS1 protein degradation by SOCS3 deficiency may account for the attenuation of inhibition by TNFα of IRS1 phosphorylation in Socs3-deficient cells. To confirm further this protection of SOCS3 deficiency on IRS1 protein degradation, we treated the Ko and Wt adipocytes with TNFα in a time course study. Fig. 6b shows that TNFα treatment caused IRS1 protein degradation from 9 to 48 h in Wt adipocytes, with the lowest levels at 12 and 24 h. In contrast, TNFα was unable to exert this action on IRS1 protein in Ko adipocytes. This effect of TNFα on IRS1 was specific, as TNFα was without effect on the degradation of p85 (Fig. 6b, lower panel). Moreover, pretreatment of adipocytes with lactacystin, a proteasomal inhibitor, completely blocks the effect of TNFα on IRS1 degradation (Fig. 6b, upper left). Similar results were observed on the effect of SOCS3 deficiency on IRS2 phosphorylation and protein levels (Fig. 6c). These data suggest that SOCS3 is required for TNFα-induced IRS1 and -2 protein degradation and subsequent hypophosphorylation, and may therefore be required for TNFα-caused impairment of insulin signaling.Fig. 6SOCS3 deficiency substantially blocks the ability of TNFα to inhibit insulin signaling.a, SOCS3 deficiency substantially blocks TNFα inhibition of IRS1 phosphorylation. Adipocytes were pretreated with TNFα (1 nm) for 12 h and then stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 5 min.

Nox1, a homolog of gp91phox, is regulated by NOXO1 and NOXA1, homologs of p47phox and p67phox, respectively. For both Nox1 and gp91phox, an organizer protein (NOXO1 or p47phox) cooperates with an activator protein (NOXA1 or p67phox) to regulate the catalytic subunit. Herein, we investigate the subunit regulation of Nox3 compared with that of other Nox enzymes. Nox3, like gp91phox, was activated by p47phox plus p67phox. Whereas gp91phox activity required the protein kinase C activator phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), Nox3 activity was already high without PMA, but was further stimulated ∼30% by PMA. gp91phox was also activated by NOXO1/NOXA1 and required PMA for high activity. gp91phox regulation required an intact activation domain in the activator protein, as neither p67phox(V204A) nor NOXA1(V205A) were effective. In contrast, p67phox(V204A) was effective (along with p47phox) in activating Nox3. Unexpectedly, Nox3 was strongly activated by NOXO1 in the absence of NOXA1 or p67phox. Nox3 activity was regulated by PMA only when p47phox but not NOXO1 was present, consistent with the phosphorylation-regulated autoinhibitory region in p47phox but not in NOXO1. Deletion of the autoinhibitory region from p47phox rendered this subunit highly active in the absence of PMA toward both gp91phox and Nox3, and high activity required an activator subunit. The unique regulation of Nox3 supports a model in which multiple interactions with regulatory subunits stabilize an active conformation of the catalytic subunit. gp91phox (Nox2), the catalytic subunit of the superoxide-generating respiratory burst oxidase, is regulated by subunits p47phox and p67phox.

The latter assemble with the membrane proteins upon cell activation, e.g. by phorbol 11-myristate 12-acetate (PMA). 1The abbreviations used are: PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; SH3, Src homology domain 3; AIR, autoinhibitory region. p47phox and p67phox are in the cytosol of unstimulated cells and, upon cell activation by microbial products or immune mediators, translocate to the membrane and assemble with the flavocytochrome. Another cytosolic component, p40phox, is associated with p67phox and also translocates upon cell activation; this protein, while not essential, stimulates activity 2-fold or more (26Kuribayashi F. Nunoi H. Wakamatsu K. Tsunawaki S. Sato K. Ito T. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6312-6320Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The small GTPase Rac, upon cell stimulation, becomes GTP-loaded and also translocates to the membrane. p67phox, the “activator” subunit, contains an activation domain that regulates the rate-limiting hydride transfer from NADPH to FAD in flavocytochrome b558, thereby regulating overall activity (27Han C.-H.

Cell. 2003; 113: 343-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) studies have shown that p47phox contains adjacent SH3 domains that cooperate to bind to a proline-rich region at the C terminus of p22phox. In resting cells, this bis-SH3 domain is fully occupied by an autoinhibitory region (AIR), preventing its interaction with p22phox. Phosphorylation of residues in this region by protein kinase C and Akt release binding and allows p47phox to translocate from the cytosol to the membrane, which also involves membrane association through a lipid-binding PX domain. The single largest difference between p47phox and NOXO1 is that NOXO1 lacks the AIR domain. Consistent with this finding, NOXO1 is fully associated with membranes without PMA activation (34Cheng G.

Gene (Amst.). 2001; 269: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), and was recently shown to be expressed in the inner ear of mouse where it participates in otoconia morphogenesis (35Paffenholz R.

Otoconia are tiny mineralized structures that are associated with perception of motion and gravity, and mouse mutations in Nox3 result in a head-tilt phenotype in which these perceptions are defective because of an absence of otoconia. The activity and regulation of Nox3 have not been reported. The present study was undertaken to characterize the requirements of Nox3 for regulatory subunits including p47phox, p67phox, NOXO1, and NOXA1. Nox3 shows unusual flexibility in its ability to be activated by both phox and NOX regulatory proteins. Moreover, Nox3 is unique in its ability to be activated by NOXO1 alone in the absence of activator subunits. This finding has important implications, discussed herein, regarding the mechanism of regulation of Nox family members by regulatory subunits. Cells and Reagents—HEK293H (Invitrogen) and COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.

V12RAC1 in pcDNA3.1 was obtained from Gluthrie cDNA Resource Center (Sayre, PA). Generation of Mutants of Nox3 and Regulatory Proteins—NOXA1(V205A) in pCMV-Sport6 was constructed by amplifying NOXA1 in pCMV-Sport6 using a primer pair of SP6 and primer 1 (5′-AGGCCACGGCCTTGGCCTTGCCCAGGAAATCC-3′) and primer T7 and primer 2 (5′-AGGCCACGGCCTTGGCCTCTGCCATCCCCGAC-3′). SP6 and T7 are located at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the multiple cloning site of pCMV-Sport6, respectively. Primers 1 and 2 contain the BstXI site, which is underlined. The bases in italics encode changes to mutate valine 205 to alanine in NOXA1. The first PCR product was doubly digested using XhoI and BstXI, whereas the second was digested with BstXI and HindIII. The digested fragments were inserted into XhoI and HindIII sites of pCMV-Sport6. p47phox(Δ298–340) in pCMV-Tag4A was constructed by amplifying p47phox in pCMV-Tag4A using a primer set of T3 and primer 3 (5′-CGGGGGCCCCCGCTTGATCTGGCGTTGGGCCTG-3′) as well as a primer set of T7 and primer 4 (5′-GCGGGGCCCGGACCGCAGAGCCCCGGGAGCCCG-3′). T3 and T7 are located at 5′- and 3′-ends of the multiple cloning site of pCMV-Tag4A, respectively. Primers 3 and 4 contain the ApaI site, which is underlined. The first PCR product contained the DNA fragment encoding p47phox-(1–297) and was digested with EcoRI and ApaI, whereas the second contained the DNA fragment encoding p47phox-(341–371) and was digested with ApaI and HindIII. The digested fragments were inserted into EcoRI and HindIII sites of pCMV-Tag4A. All cDNA clones were sequenced in both strands using an ABI model 377 sequencer. Transient Transfections—HEK293H cells were placed in 6-well plates and grown overnight to reach to 40–50% confluence. Plasmids (pcDNA3.1 or vector encoding Nox1, Nox2, Nox3, NOXO1, NOXA1, NOXA1(V205A), p47phox, p47phox(Δ298–340), p67phox, p67phox(V204A), and/or V12Rac1 alone or in combinations) were transfected in HEK293H cells using FuGENE 6 according to manufacturers' instructions. After 48 h, cells were removed from the well and washed twice with cold Hanks' solution containing calcium and magnesium. The cells then were pelleted at 600 × g for 5 min and re-suspended in Hanks' solution. Measurement of Reactive Oxygen Species—Reactive oxygen was measured using luminol luminescence according to Ref. 37Allen R.C. Loose L.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 69: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar as modified in Ref. 34Cheng G. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

For each well in a 96-well plate, 2.5 × 105 cells in Hanks' buffer with calcium/magnesium were mixed with 200 μm luminol and 0.32 units of horseradish peroxidase in a 200 μl total volume. PMA was added and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Luminescence was quantified using FluoStar™ luminometor (BMG Labtech, Durham, NC) and luminescence was recorded every 1–4 min for a total of 1 to 2 h. The peak luminescence was reached at about 20 min, and this value was reported. Use of values at other time points or integrated areas gave qualitatively identical results. Specificity for H2O2 was demonstrated by elimination of signal when catalase was included. In addition, the Diogenes assay (National Diagnostics), which measures superoxide, was used for some of these experiments and used the protocol provided by the company; the assay typically gave ∼10% of the signal compared with luminol, but gave qualitatively similar results. Activity was too low to be reliably measured by cytochrome c reduction, and was previously estimated to be 5% or less of that in activated neutrophils (34Cheng G. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4737-4742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Transfected or control HEK293H cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA) with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Lysate (60 μg of protein) was resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and transfered to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using the semi-dry electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad) at 15 V for 1 h. The proteins were detected using standard Western blotting and visualized by chemiluminescence. Blots were stripped and re-probed as necessary. Activation of Nox3 by p47phox and p67phox—As reported previously, activation of gp91phox in cells required both p47phox and p67phox.Fig. 1 demonstrates that this activation is absolutely dependent upon the presence of the protein kinase C activator PMA. Like gp91phox, Nox3 was strongly activated by the combination of p47phox and p67phox (Fig. 1), but activity was less tightly regulated. For Nox3, whereas optimal activity required both p47phox and p67phox, p67phox by itself produced moderate activation of Nox3 in the absence of p47phox. Unlike gp91phox, significant PMA-independent Nox3 activity was seen with p47phox and p67phox, although PMA produced some further activation (about 30–40%) when p47phox was present. Reactive oxygen species generation by gp91phox but not by Nox3 required co-expression of V12Rac1, because in the absence of V12Rac we were unable to detect any activity. 2G. Cheng, unpublished data. V12Rac1 is a constitutively activated mutant form of Rac1 that lacks GTPase activity, thereby trapping Rac in its GTP-bound form. These results suggest either that Nox3 does not require Rac1 for activation, or that endogenous levels of Rac1-GTP are sufficient for Nox3 activity. These possibilities as well as the role of Rac1 in Nox1 activation are under investigation in our laboratory. gp91phox required an intact activation domain, because p67phox mutated in this domain, p67phox(V204A), was inactive (Fig. 1). This site was previously shown to be essential for activation of gp91phox (27Han C.-H. Freeman J.L.R. Lee T. Motalebi S.A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

For Nox3, p67phox(V204A) was less active than wild type p67phox in the absence of PMA, but the activation domain mutant was fully active when PMA was used. Activation of Nox3 by NOXO1 and NOXA1—Nox1-dependent activity is highly stimulated by the combination of NOXO1 plus NOXA1 (Refs. 29Takeya R. Ueno N. Kami K. Taura M. Kohjima M. Izaki T. Nunoi H.

To investigate the regulation of Nox3 by NOXO1 and NOXA1, co-transfection experiments were carried out as in Fig. 2. Unexpectedly, high activity was seen with the organizing protein NOXO1 alone in the absence of NOXA1. A small stimulation of activity was seen with NOXA1 alone, and this was absent when NOXA1(V205A) was used. This mutation is analogous to the V204A mutation in the activation domain of p67phox. When NOXA1 was included along with NOXO1, only a very small further increase in activity was seen. In addition, PMA had little or no effect on activity in the presence of NOXO1, whether or not NOXA1 was present. This is consistent with the absence of regulatory phosphorylation sites on NOXO1, and on the recent finding (34Cheng G. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4737-4742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) that NOXO1 (in contrast to p47phox) is pre-assembled at the plasma membrane along with its Nox target in the absence of cell activation. For comparison, Fig. 2 shows regulation of gp91phox by NOXO1 and NOXA1. Fig. 3 shows that gp91phox is activated to a lesser extent by the combination of NOXO1 and NOXA1 compared with activation by p47phox and p67phox and is consistent with results in K562 cells (39Geiszt M. Witta J. Baffi J. Lekstrom K. Leto T.L. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1502-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) where gp91phox showed greater specificity for the phox proteins compared with NOXO1/NOXA1, but differs somewhat from results in COS7 cells (29Takeya R. Ueno N. Kami K. Taura M. Kohjima M. Izaki T. Nunoi H. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25234-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), suggesting cell-specific effects. Unlike Nox3, which was PMA independent and required only NOXO1, gp91phox required both NOXO1 and NOXA1 and was PMA-dependent (Figs. 2 and 3). Because NOXO1 lacks regulatory phosphorylation sites that are present in p47phox, regulatory phosphorylation of other components, perhaps gp91phox itself, may account for the requirement for PMA for gp91phox activation when NOXO1 is used. Consistent with such an interpretation, reconstitution of phagocyte NADPH oxidase activity by protein kinase C required phosphorylation not only of p47phox, but also of an unknown membrane protein (40El Benna J. Park J.-W. Ruedi J.M. Babior B.M. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1995; 21: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Activation by Heterologous Regulatory Subunits—The expression of regulatory subunits NOXO1 and NOXA1 differ somewhat, with NOXA1 showing a generally wider distribution than NOXO1 (30Geiszt M. Lekstrom K. Witta J. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20006-20012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).2 Likewise, p47phox and p67phox, whereas heavily expressed in phagocytes, are also expressed in lesser amounts individually or in combination in a variety of other tissues. Thus, in some tissues the organizing proteins (NOXO1 and p47phox) might pair heterologously with the activator proteins (NOXA1 and p67phox) to support Nox-dependent functions. We therefore investigated (Figs. 3 and 4) the regulation of Nox1, gp91phox, and Nox3 by heterologous combinations. Nox1 showed a strict requirement for NOXO1 and NOXA1 (Fig. 3, left), and did not show high activity with phox proteins alone in agreement with studies using the human proteins (29Takeya R. Ueno N. Kami K. Taura M. Kohjima M. Izaki T. Nunoi H. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25234-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 30Geiszt M. Lekstrom K. Witta J. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20006-20012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) but in contrast to a report using mouse Nox1, which showed moderate PMA-dependent reactive oxygen species generation using mouse p47phox and p67phox (31Banfi B. Clark R.A. Steger K. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3510-3513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Heterologous combinations that included either NOXO1 or NOXA1 showed some PMA-dependent activity that was less pronounced than when both NOXO1 and NOXA1 were present. Interestingly, more NOXO1 was seen when it was co-expressed with NOXA1 compared with co-expression with p67phox. We speculate that NOXO1 is stabilized by binding to NOXA1 but not p67phox (Western blots in Fig. 3). gp91phox activity was stimulated by the combination of NOXO1 and either activator protein (Fig. 3), but surprisingly, p67phox functioned more effectively than NOXA1 when paired with NOXO1. For both Nox1 and gp91phox, activation was always PMA-dependent, regardless of whether p47phox or NOXO1 was used as the organizer protein, pointing to a phosphorylation target in addition to p47phox. As above, Nox3 was activated nearly maximally by NOXO1 alone, and NOXA1 (Fig. 2) or p67phox (Fig. 4) produced only a modest further activation when expressed along with NOXO1. The heterologous combination of p47phox plus NOXA1 activated Nox3 in a PMA-dependent manner. In contrast to gp91phox, Nox3 was regulated in a PMA-dependent manner only when p47phox was present, consistent with p47phox as a primary target of regulatory phosphorylation in the Nox3 system. Role of the Autoinhibitory Region of p47phox in Nox3 Activation—The domain structure of p47phox and NOXO1 are diagrammed in Fig. 5A. As above, the two proteins differ in the presence in p47phox of an AIR that is the target of multiple phosphorylations by protein kinase C and other kinases. To investigate the role of the AIR in p47phox in regulating Nox3, we made a deletion mutant of p47phox that lacks AIR, making it identical in domain structure to NOXO1 (Fig. 5A). p47phox(ΔAIR) used in place of p47phox to support gp91phox-dependent activity showed high basal activity in the absence of PMA (Fig. 5B), consistent with AIR as a target for regulation by protein kinase C. Moreover, PMA stimulated activity was ∼2-fold higher using p47phox(ΔAIR) compared with wild type p47phox (Fig. 5B), consistent with a regulatory phosphorylation distinct from those in the AIR. p47phox(ΔAIR) alone modestly but reproducibly stimulates activity of Nox3 in the absence of an activator protein (Fig. 6, left and inset), but did not fully replicate the high degree of activation produced by NOXO1. Wild type p47phox in combination with either p67phox or NOXA1, activated Nox3 in a PMA-dependent manner. When an activator protein was present, activity was higher with p47phox(ΔAIR) compared with p47phox, and was independent of PMA. Thus, PMA regulation of Nox3 when p47phox is the organizing protein can therefore be attributed at least in part to the AIR, which normally constrains activity. According to an activation paradigm established for gp91phox, the adapter protein (p47phox) along with Rac provide binding sites for the activator protein, p67phox (25Lambeth J.D. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 33: 427-439Google Scholar, 27Han C.-H. Freeman J.L.R. Lee T. Motalebi S.A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14557-14566Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). According to this model, these binding sites orient p67phox in such a way as to position its activation domain (residues ∼200–210) in proximity to gp91phox, activating electron flow (specifically hydride transfer from NADPH to FAD (28Nisimoto Y. Motalebi S. Han C.-H. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar)) within the flavocytochrome. The detailed mechanism of this activation has not been established, but the two broad classes of mechanism are: (a) the activation domain of p67phox induces an activated conformation in the flavoprotein domain of gp91phox (i.e. the catalytic site of the “resting” gp91phox is complete, but is in an inactive conformation), and (b) the activation domain provides a catalytic residue(s) to gp91phox (i.e. the catalytic site is incomplete, lacking a residue that is provided by p67phox). The second mechanism implies that activation will be specific to regulatory proteins containing an activation domain, whereas the first mechanism suggests that several types of molecular interactions could induce an active conformation. Nox1 activation conforms to the same activation paradigm as gp91phox, showing a requirement for both an adapter protein (NOXO1) and the activator protein (NOXA1) (29Takeya R. Ueno N. Kami K. Taura M. Kohjima M. Izaki T. Nunoi H. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25234-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 30Geiszt M. Lekstrom K. Witta J. Leto T.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 4737-4742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). When p47phox and p67phox are used, Nox3 conforms to a similar activation paradigm, requiring both an adapter and an activator protein for optimal activity. Under these conditions, regulation is less stringent than for gp91phox, because significant activity is also seen with p67phox alone (or NOXA1 alone). This is in contrast to the very tight regulation of gp91phox in cells, which as shown in Fig. 1, absolutely requires both p47phox and p67phox. However, regulation of Nox3 fails to conform to the adaptor protein/activator protein paradigm in several respects. First, with p47phox, its regulation by p67phox does not require an intact activation domain, indicating that other regions of p67phox are important for regulating Nox3 activity. Second, Nox3 can be maximally activated by NOXO1 alone, and does not require NOXA1. As far as we can determine, there is no sequence in either NOXO1 or Nox3 that is homologous to the activation domain of p67phox/NOXA1, suggesting that the presence of a p67phox-like activation domain is not essential for regulation of Nox proteins. Whereas it is possible that Nox3 might be regulated in a fundamentally different manner compared with Nox1 and gp91phox, it is telling that in a recent study, gp91phox was activated by MRP8/MRP14 (42Berthier S. Paclet M.H. Lerouge S. Roux F. Vergnaud S. Coleman A.W. Morel F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25499-25508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), which do not possess a p67phox-like activation domain. Thus, it seems more likely that a variety of protein-protein interactions can stabilize an activated conformation in Nox enzymes. It seems likely that NOXO1 functions by inducing an activated conformation in Nox3, and that there is no strict requirement for a particular activating signature sequence such as the activation domain in p67phox. Whereas it is theoretically possible our model cells contain an unknown homolog of p67phox/NOXA1, we consider this possibility unlikely, because extensive searching of the now complete genomic data base, as well as searching of EST data bases has failed to uncover any additional homologs.2 The present studies indicate a surprising degree of flexibility of regulation of Nox family proteins, particularly Nox3, with regard to utilizing diverse combinations of regulatory subunits, including heterologous combinations of phox and non-phox subunits. The regulatory adaptability may be biologically important, e.g. in providing redundant backup in some tissues for regulatory subunit mutations or genetic deletions. Phagocytes express only the phox components, and mutation of any one of these results in chronic granulomatous disease. Functional redundancy of regulatory subunits in other tissues may suppress the expression of disease phenotypes in these sites when phox subunits are mutated. These studies also emphasize caution in interpreting phenotypes in mouse knockout studies, for example, p47phox(–/–) mice, wherein it cannot be rigorously established that a phox regulatory subunit partners exclusively with gp91phox. Finally, the present studies provide evidence that the PMA regulation of Nox3 by p47phox plus an activator protein (p67phox or NOXA1) involves the autoinhibitory domain of p47phox. Deletion of AIR results in a highly active Nox3 system when either p67phox or NOXA1 is present, and activity is no longer further stimulated by PMA. These data are consistent with functional and structural studies indicating that that AIR combines in resting cells with the tandem SH3 domain of p47phox to prevent its interaction with p22phox (32Ago T.

Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1479-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of specific serines in the AIR disrupts this interaction, and allows binding of p47phox to p22phox and targeting to the membrane. When the autoinhibitory domain is eliminated, the p47phox(ΔAIR) behaves like NOXO1 with respect to activity in the absence of PMA. However, activation of Nox3 still requires an activator protein, and elimination of AIR fails to provide p47phox with the same strong activator properties as NOXO1. Thus, unknown features of NOXO1 permit Nox3 to function as a strong activator in the absence of a protein with an activation domain. This is consistent with the idea that regulation of Nox enzymes involves stabilization of an active conformation in the catalytic subunit by interacting regulatory proteins, and that such regulation is not unique to activator proteins containing an activation domain.

https://openalex.org/W2033290644,"Melanoma progresses as a multistep process where the thickness of the lesion and depth of tumor invasion are the best prognostic indicators of clinical outcome. Degradation of the interstitial collagens in the extracellular matrix is an integral component of tumor invasion and metastasis, and much of this degradation is mediated by collagenase-1 (MMP-1), a member of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family. MMP-1 levels increase during melanoma progression where they are associated with shorter disease-free survival. The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a major regulator of melanoma cell proliferation. Recently, BRAF has been identified as a common site of activating mutations, and, although many reports focus on its growth-promoting effects, this pathway has also been implicated in progression toward metastatic disease. In this study, we describe four melanoma cell lines that produce high levels of MMP-1 constitutively. In each cell line the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is constitutively active and is the dominant pathway driving the production of MMP-1. Activation of this pathway arises due to either an activating mutation in BRAF (three cell lines) or autocrine fibroblast growth factor signaling (one cell line). Furthermore, blocking MEK/ERK activity inhibits melanoma cell proliferation and abrogates collagen degradation, thus decreasing their metastatic potential. Importantly, this inhibition of invasive behavior can occur in the absence of any detectable changes in cell proliferation and survival. Thus, constitutive activation of this MAPK pathway not only promotes the increased proliferation of melanoma cells but is also important for the acquisition of an invasive phenotype."

Using gene array analysis, the growth regulator NOV (CCN3), a member of the CCN gene family, was found to be up-regulated only in the Cx43-transfected cells. Validation by reverse transcriptase-PCR confirmed an up-regulation of the NOV transcript exclusively upon Cx43 induction. In contrast to Cx40 or trCx43, induction of Cx43 led to a switch in localization of NOV from the nucleus to the cell membrane, where it is colocalized with Cx43. Coimmunoprecipitation showed a binding of NOV to the C terminus of Cx43 in vitro as well as in transfected cells. Jeg3 cells transfected only with NOV revealed that NOV itself acts as a growth regulator. We suggest that Cx43 is able to regulate cell growth via an up-regulation of NOV transcription, a change in localization of the NOV protein and a binding of NOV to the C terminus of Cx43. The gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43) is thought to be involved in growth control in several tissues. Using the doxycycline inducible tet-on system, we generated human malignant trophoblast Jeg3 cells transfected with either Cx40, Cx43, or C-terminal truncated Cx43 (trCx43).

Connexin proteins form gap junction channels responsible for direct intercellular communication between adjacent cells. A gap junction channel consists of a pair of hemichannels, called connexons, which contain six connexin proteins arranged around a water-filled pore. Meanwhile, 21 members of the connexin gene family are identified in the human genome (1Willecke K. Eiberger J. Degen J. Eckardt D. Romualdi A. Guldenagel M. Deutsch U. Sohl G. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar, 2Sohl G. Willecke K. Cell Commun. Adhes. 2003; 10: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The possibility of a direct exchange of small molecules, ions, and second messengers between cells seems to enable the channels to control and coordinate cell growth. Loss of communication properties or the aberrant expression of connexins has long been considered as one important step in carcinogenesis (3Yamasaki H. Environ. Health Perspect. 1991; 93: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 4Yamasaki H. Omori Y. Krutovskikh V. Zhu W. Mironov N. Yamakage K. Willecke K. Novartis Found. Symp. 1999; 219: 241-260PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous studies have shown that growth of communication-deficient tumor cells in vitro and in vivo could be reduced if transfected with the appropriate connexin, suggesting a role of these proteins in tumor suppression (5Zhu D. Caveney S. Kidder G.M. Naus C.C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1883-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 6King T. Fukushima L.H. Hieber A.D. Shimabukuro K.A. Sakr W.A.

Carcinog. 2002; 35: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of how the channels are involved in cell cycle control are not fully understood. Recent publications suggested a channel-independent role for connexins in intracellular signaling by interacting with other proteins. It could be demonstrated that, independent from gap junction channel formation, the Cx43 (Connexin43) protein itself is able to affect growth control as well as further cellular functions like adhesion and migration (8Omori Y. Yamasaki H. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 78: 446-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 9Xu X. Li W.E. Huang G.Y. Meyer R. Chen T. Luo Y. Thomas M.P. Radice G.L. Lo C.W. J.

Cell Res. 2001; 271: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) showed that the C terminus of Cx43 alone is as effective as the wild type channel in suppressing neuroblastoma cell growth. The C-terminal region, which differs in length and sequence among the various connexin isoforms, plays an important role in signal transduction processes. The carboxyl terminus of Cx43 contains numerous phosphorylation sites for protein kinases (for a review, see Ref. 15Lampe P.D. Lau A.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Up to now, only a few interaction partners are known that bind to the Cx43 tail (e.g. ZO-1 (16Giepmans B.N.G. Moolenaar W.H.

McLeod et al. (20McLeod T.L. Bechberger J.F. Naus C.C.G. Cell Commun. Adhes. 2001; 8: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) demonstrated that two members of the CCN gene family, CCN1 (Cyr61) and CCN3 (NOV: nephroblastoma overexpressed) were up-regulated in Cx43-transfected C6 glioma cells. The CCN family now consists of six members, which belong to a group of structurally related, secreted, extracellular matrix-associated proteins (21Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). These proteins are characterized by an N-terminal secretory signal followed by four domains with different functions (for a review, see Refs. 22Perbal B. J. Clin. Pathol. Mol.

Pathol. 2001; 54: 57-79Crossref Scopus (316) Google Scholar). All members of the CCN family are involved in diverse fundamental biological processes like proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis and are expressed in a number of tissues such as kidney, heart, liver, and spleen. Although these secretory proteins show a high structural similarity, they seem to exhibit different cellular functions. NOV may be involved in cell cycle control, because NOV expression induces growth inhibition in embryonic chicken fibroblasts (29Joliot V. Martinerie C. Dambrine G. Plassiart G. Brisac M. Crochet J. Perbal B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 30Scholz G. Martinerie C. Perbal B. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Moreover it has been shown that less aggressive glioma and astrocytoma express high levels of NOV, which suggests an antiproliferative effect of NOV (31Gupta N. Wang H. McLeod T.L. Naus C.C.G. Kyurkchiev S. Advani S. Yu J. Perbal B. Weichselbaum R.R. J. Clin. Pathol. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 54: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated the possibility of growth reduction of the malignant trophoblast cell line Jeg3 upon connexin induction. This communication-deficient cell line (32Hellmann P. Winterhager E. Spray D. Eur. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 432: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 33Hellmann P. Grümmer R.

Gey G.O. Delfs E. Mattingly R.F. Science. 1968; 159: 1467-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Since Cx40 and Cx43 are involved in the regulation of proliferation (35Winterhager E. von Ostau C. Grümmer R. Traub O. Kaufmann P. Placenta. 1999; 20: 627-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and differentiation (36Cronier L. Defamie N. Dupays L. Theveniau-Ruissy M. Goffin F. Pointis G. Malassine A. Mol. Hum.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3413-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) in human trophoblast cells, we have transfected this tumor cell line with these tissue-specific gap junction channels. We could demonstrate that Cx43, but not Cx40 and a Cx43 construct lacking most parts of the C terminus (trCx43), is able to reduce cell growth in vitro and tumor growth in nude mice. Upon induction of Cx43, we revealed an up-regulation of the growth-regulatory gene NOV. This up-regulation was accompanied by a change in localization of NOV from the nucleus to the membrane, where NOV colocalizes with Cx43. Furthermore, we could confirm a direct interaction of NOV with the carboxyl terminus of Cx43, both in vitro and in transfected cells. The human choriocarcinoma cell line Jeg3 (ATCC HTB-36) was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Jeg3 cells were grown in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (certified tetracycline-free; Biochrome, Germany). The human embryonic kidney cell line 293T was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Athymic male nude mice (Han:NMRI nu/nu) were obtained from the animal facility of the University Hospital, Duisburg-Essen, Germany. The mice were maintained in a pathogen-free barrier unit with regulated light/dark cycles (12 h/12 h). Mice had access to food and water ad libitum. The treatment of the animals was in accordance with the German law for animal protection and with permission of the state. For construction of the plasmids based on the tet-on system, two different expression vectors containing rat Cx40 (pPH3) and rat Cx43 (pPH4) were used (32Hellmann P. Winterhager E. Spray D. Eur. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 432: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 39Gramsch B. Gabriel H.D. Wiemann M. Grummer R. Winterhager E. Bingmann D. Schirrmacher K. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The coding region for rat Cx40 was excised from the vector pPH3 by HindIII/XbaI and subcloned into the SacII site of the rtTA-responsive plasmid pUHD10-3 (40Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4267) Google Scholar), creating the plasmid pUHD/Cx40. The cDNA coding region for rat Cx43 was excised from plasmid pPH4 by EcoRI and subcloned into the EcoRI site of pUHD10-3, creating the construct pUHD/Cx43. For construction of the plasmid pUHD/trCx43, an expression vector containing trCx43 without most of the C-terminal region (pBEHpac18/Cx43 truncated, mutation at amino acid 258 (lysine) into a stop codon; C terminus of Cx43: amino acids 227-382) was used. The mouse Cx43 fragment was excised by EcoRI/BamHI and subcloned into the EcoRI/BamHI site of pUHD10-3, creating the construct pUHD/trCx43. The sequence and orientation of the inserts were analyzed by sequencing (MWG Biotech, Germany). To establish Cx40-, Cx43-, and truncated Cx43-inducible cell clones, the Jeg3 cell line was first stably transfected with the plasmid pUHD172-1neo (40Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4267) Google Scholar), containing both a gene encoding rtTA and a gene encoding G418 resistance. Jeg3 cells (6 × 104) were transfected with 1.5 μg of pUHD172-1neo DNA using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the recommended protocol and selected in medium supplemented with 500 μg/ml G418. Stable clones were screened for rtTA activity by transient transfection with the reporter plasmid pUHC13-3 (40Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4267) Google Scholar). Cell clones expressing high levels of the rtTA gene and exhibiting only basic activity of the tet-on system (data not shown) were cotransfected with the connexin expression vectors pUHD/Cx40, pUHD/Cx43, and pUHD10-3/trCx43, respectively, and a plasmid encoding puromycin resistance (pBEHpac18) (41Elfgang C. Eckert R. Lichtenberg-Frate H. Butterweck A. Traub O. Klein R.A. Hülser D.F. Willecke K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 805-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Therefore, 6 × 104 Jeg3 cells were cotransfected with 1.5 μg of expression vector DNA and 1.5 μg of pBEH-pac18. In addition, Jeg3 cells were cotransfected only with pUHD10-3 and pBEHpac18 as the vector control. Cells were selected in medium supplemented with 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Resistant clones were isolated after 3 weeks. Cells were initially screened for the appropriate connexin expression by immunocytochemistry following 48-h induction with 1 μg/ml doxycycline HCl (Dox) 1The abbreviations used are: Dox, doxycycline HCl; RT, reverse transcriptase. (Sigma). Jeg3 Tet transfectants were cultivated in medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 sulfate and 0.5 μg/ml puromycin. For the transfection of parental Jeg3 cells with NOV, the expression vector pCMV-NOVH (S) containing a G418 resistance gene was used (42Chevalier G. Yeger H. Martinerie C. Laurent M. Alami J. Schofield P.N. Perbal B. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 1563-1575PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection was performed as described above, and cells were selected in medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 sulfate. Total RNA was isolated from confluent cell monolayers and from solid tumors frozen in liquid nitrogen using a Qiagen RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). RNA samples (5 μg) were separated on a denaturing agarose gel before being transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N; Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization at 42 °C and labeling of the specific probes with [α-32P]dCTP by using the random primed labeling system (Amersham Biosciences) were performed as described previously (43Gabriel H.D. Strobl B. Hellmann P. Buettner R. Winterhager E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1749-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The following probes were used: rat Cx40 cDNA fragment (44Haefliger J.A. Bruzzone R. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Paul D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2057-2064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and rat heart Cx43 cDNA fragment (45Beyer E.C. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2621-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). As a control, the blots were rehybridized with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-specific probe (GAPDH) (46Hanauer A. Mandel J.L. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2627-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Indirect immunocytochemistry on cells and solid tumor sections was performed as described previously (47Winterhager E. Stutenkemper R. Traub O. Beyer E. Willecke K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 55: 133-142PubMed Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies were used: anti-Cx43 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:300) (48Traub O. Eckert R. Lichtenberg-Frate H. Elfgang C. Bastide B. Scheidtmann K.H. Hülser D.F Willecke K. Eur.

Pathol. 1998; 152: 1563-1575PubMed Google Scholar). The following appropriate secondary antibodies were used: fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated swine anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse IgG (1:40; DAKO, Germany) and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:300; Dianova, Germany). For double immunolabeling of connexin and NOV, the same protocol was used as described above, but both primary antibodies were added successively. After immunolabeling of NOV, the DNA-specific dye 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole hydrochloride (0.1 μg/ml; 15 min at 37 °C) was used to counterstain the nucleus of Jeg3 cells. 2 μg of total RNA samples were digested with DNase I (Invitrogen) according to the protocol to prevent contamination with DNA. For reverse transcription, first strand synthesis was carried out using oligo(dT)12-18 primer (MWG Biotech) and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). 4 μl of the RT reaction were used for the following PCR experiments. For a semiquantitative measurement, β-actin was used as an internal control. The PCR was performed using primers specific for NOV and β-actin as shown in Table I. PCR was carried out in a 50-μl volume using BioTherm Taq polymerase (Genecraft, Germany). The PCR was performed for 40 cycles of 1-min denaturation at 94 °C, 1-min annealing at 59 °C, and 1.5-min elongation at 72 °C. The PCR amplification was followed by a 10-min final extension at 72 °C. All experiments were carried out up to four times in a thermocycler (Biometra, Germany). The PCR amplification products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Densitometric analysis was performed using a Gel Imager (Intas, Germany). The expression of NOV was normalized to the expression of β-actin and quantified with Gelscan Professional version 4.0 software. The gene expression data were analyzed for statistical significance by Student's t test. A p value of ≤0.05 was considered to be significant.Table IOligonucleotides used as primers for semiquantitative RT-PCRGeneAccession no.OligonucleotideSequence (5′ → 3′)PCR product sizebpNOV (CCN3)NM_0025145′-PrimerCACGGCGGTAGAGGGAGATA2513′-PrimerGGGTAAGGCCTCCCAGTGAAβ-ActinNM_0011015′-PrrimerACCTTCAACACCCCAGCCATGTACG6983′-PrimerCTGATCCACATCTGCTGGAAGGTGG Open table in a new tab Total RNA was isolated from confluent cell monolayers using a Qiagen RNeasy minikit, and the cell lysate was digested on the minispin column with DNase I according to the protocol. cDNA synthesis and synthesis of biotinylated cRNA were performed as described previously (49Durig J.

Fragmentation of cRNA, hybridization to HG_U95Av2 microarrays (Affymetrix) with 6000 genes and 6000 expressed sequence tags, washing, and staining as well as scanning of the arrays in a GeneArray scanner (Agilent) were carried out as recommended in the Affymetrix Gene Expression Analysis technical manual. Three cell clones per connexin construct were analyzed on an individual gene array. Scaling across all probe sets of a given array to an average intensity of 1000 units was included to compensate for variations in the amount and quality of the cRNA samples and other experimental variables. Absolute and comparison analyses (single pairwise and cross-pairwise comparisons) were performed using the Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 software. In the absolute analysis, the signal intensities and detection calls of the analyzed genes were determined. In the comparison analysis, the alteration of gene expression (signal log ratio and -fold change, respectively) and the change call were identified. The “cut-off” level in -fold change values was defined as 1.5 and 2.5 (cross-pairwise comparisons, experimental groups + versus + Dox) using the Affymetrix Data Mining Tool 3.0 Software (DMT 3.0). The -fold change level of 1.5 represents a generally accepted -fold change difference for oligonucleotide microarray analysis (50Yue H. Eastman P.S. Wang B.B. Minor J. Doctolero M.H. Nuttall R.L.

The on-line supplemental material is comprised of data lists of upand down-regulated genes in Jeg3 connexin transfectants analyzed by gene arrays (supplemental Tables I and II). Plasmid Construction—pUHD/Cx43 and pCMV-NOVH (S) were used as a template for PCR to amplify Cx431-382, Cx43Δ1-257, Cx43CT257-382, and NOV1-357. The 5′-primer contained an EcoRI site and ATG sequence, and the 3′-primer contained a TAG sequence and a SalI site. For in vitro coimmunoprecipitation, the PCR products were digested with EcoRI and SalI. Cx43 fragments were ligated into the EcoRI and XhoI sites within pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to form the pcDNA Cx43 constructs. For in vivo coimmunoprecipitation, the Cx43-amplified fragments were inserted into pFlag-CMV2 vector (Sigma) at EcoRI and SalI. For both experimental approaches, the NOV fragment was ligated into the EcoRI and XhoI sites within pcDNA-His6 (Invitrogen) at EcoRI and XhoI to form the pHis-NOV construct. All of the constructs have been sequenced to confirm the proper reading frame and cDNA sequences for Cx43 and NOV. In Vitro Coimmunoprecipitation—pcDNA Cx43 constructs were synthesized with the TNT reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. pHis-NOV was synthesized without [35S]methionine. The translation products of Cx43 and NOV were incubated together with anti-His antibody (H15; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and protein A-Sepharose 4B (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) in 700 μl of EBC buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8), 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) followed by five washes with NETN buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA). The proteins bound to the Sepharose beads were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. Immunoblotting was conducted with anti-His antibody to confirm the translation of His-tagged NOV. In Vivo Coimmunoprecipitation—293T cells were transient transfected with the FLAG-Cx43 expression vectors and pHis-NOV. Whole cell lysate were collected in NETN buffer (see above). Immunoprecipitations were performed using M2 Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) incubated with 800 μl of 1 mg/ml whole cell lysate at 4 °C for 2 h. After the beads were thoroughly washed with NETN buffer, associated proteins were eluted with FLAG peptide (Sigma) for 30 min on ice and separated on 10% SDS gel. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blotted with anti-FLAG and anti-His. This assay is based on transfer of calcein from preloaded donor cells to recipient acceptor cells (51Czyz J. Irmer U. Schulz G. Mindermann A. Hülser D.F. Exp.

Twenty-four hours before the experiment, the acceptor cells were seeded into 6-well plates (5 × 105 cells/well) to obtain confluent cultures. For loading the donor cells with the membrane-permeable dye calcein AM (C-3100; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) the cells were trypsinized, resuspended in 2 ml of staining solution (5 μm calcein AM in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.2% glucose), and agitated for 30 min at 37 °C in an incubator. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the cell number was measured in a cell counter (CASY 1; Schaerfe System, Germany). Loading of the acceptor cells with the permanent membrane dye DiI (C-7000; Molecular Probes) was done directly in cell culture dishes using a solution of 5 μm DiI in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.2% glucose for 15-30 min. In each experiment, 9 × 104 donor cells were added to a confluent monolayer culture of DiI-stained acceptor cells. After an incubation time of 4 h at 37 °C, these cocultures were analyzed by flow cytometry. Up to three independent experiments of either combination were performed. Cells were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using Cell Quest software. The fluorescence intensity of the cells was recorded with an argon laser set up for an excitation wavelength at 488 nm. Each sample was measured up to three times with a total of 10,000 cells. Samples were analyzed by gating on the acceptor cell population, characterized by an intermediate to high forward scatter and low to intermediate side scatter and bright staining for DiI. The percentage of calcein-positive (communicating) acceptor cells as compared with the respective negative control represented by the DiI-stained acceptor cell population in the absence of donor cells was determined. A mixture of calcein-stained, DiI-stained, and unstained cells were used to optimize signal detection and to compensate for overlap of calcein fluorescence with the DiI channel. Results are reported as the mean ± S.D. Levels of significance were determined at the p value of ≤0.05 using Student's t test. For analysis of cell proliferation, the Jeg3 Tet transfectants and the NOV-transfected Jeg3 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 103 cells/well in 12-well plates in triplicate and were counted at day 2, 5, 7, and 10 after plating using a CASY cell counter (Casy1; Schaerfe System). The results were analyzed for statistical significance by Student's t test. A p value of ≤0.05 was considered to be significant. Athymic male nude mice (Han:NMRI nu/nu) were subcutaneously inoculated with 2.5 × 106 cells/flank in 200 μl of isotonic NaCl solution. 6-9 animals/cell clone were analyzed. For a direct comparison, each nude mouse received an injection with the cell transfectant in the right flank and the vector control in the left flank. Induction of connexin expression in the Cx Tet tumors was maintained by feeding animals with sucrose water containing Dox (200 μg/ml Dox, 3% sucrose; protected from light degradation by dark feeder bottles) and by injection of 1 mg of Dox/mouse in isotonic NaCl solution every third day. The water was exchanged every 3 days. Tumor volume was measured every 3 days using calipers in two perpendicular dimensions and was calculated assuming a spherical shape: tumor volume = 4/3(π)abc (a, b, c = half-axis). The tumors were harvested after 3 weeks. Statistical significance of the obtained data was analyzed by Student's t test. A p value of ≤0.05 was considered to be significant. Immediately after removal, the tumor tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and 7-μm cryostat sections of the tumors were prepared for immunohistochemistry. Generation and Characterization of Inducible Jeg3 Tet Cx Transfectants—To investigate the influence of different connexins on cell growth properties of the malignant trophoblast cell line Jeg3, we generated cell lines in which exogeneous Cx40, Cx43, and truncated Cx43 without 125 amino acids of the C-terminal region (trCx43; C terminus of Cx43: 155 amino acids) can be indu"

Given the many overlapped functions between NPM and BRCA1, we propose that NPM is a strong candidate as a substrate of the BRCA1-BARD1 ubiquitin ligase. The breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene product BRCA1 has been implicated in a variety of biological processes (1Venkitaraman A.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 171-182Google Scholar). However, to date, the only known biochemical function attributed to BRCA1 is E3 ubiquitin (Ub) 1The abbreviations used are: Ub, ubiquitin; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; His, hexahistidine; HA, hemagglutinin; NPM, nucleolar phosphoprotein nucleophosmin/B23; LC/MS/MS, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. ligase activity (2Hashizume R.

A Ub ligase (E3) catalyzes the formation of poly-Ub chains onto substrate proteins via isopeptide bonds utilizing Ubs that have been sequentially activated by enzymes E1 and E2 (5Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Google Scholar). The most common poly-Ub chain is linked through Lys-48 of Ub and serves as a signal for rapid degradation of substrates by the proteasome-dependent proteolysis pathway (5Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Google Scholar). BRCA1 contains an N-terminal RING finger domain, a common motif found in Ub ligases. It acquires significant Ub ligase activity when bound to another conformationally similar RING finger protein, BARD1, as a RING heterodimer (2Hashizume R. Fukuda M. Maeda I. Nishikawa H. Oyake D. Yabuki Y. Ogata H. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14537-14540Google Scholar, 4Baer R. Ludwig T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 86-91Google Scholar, 6Brzovic P.S. Keeffe J.R. Nishikawa H.

Deleterious missense mutations in the RING finger domain of BRCA1 found in familial breast cancer abolish the Ub ligase activity of BRCA1-BARD1 (2Hashizume R. Fukuda M. Maeda I. Nishikawa H. Oyake D. Yabuki Y. Ogata H. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14537-14540Google Scholar, 3Ruffner H. Joazeiro C.A. Hemmati D. Hunter T. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This suggests that the Ub ligase activity may well be important for the role of BRCA1 as a tumor suppressor. However, the manner in which the activity contributes to the biological function of BRCA1 remains to be determined. We and others (7Wu Baer F. Lagrazon K. Yuan W. Baer R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34743-34746Google Scholar, 8Nishikawa H. Ooka S. Sato K. Arima K. Okamoto J. Klevit R.E. Fukuda M. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3916-3924Google Scholar) recently showed that BRCA1-BARD1 catalyzes Lys-6-linked poly-Ub chains. Unlike Lys-48-linked poly-Ub chains, the 26 S proteasome deubiquitinates Lys-6 chains without degradation in vitro (8Nishikawa H. Ooka S. Sato K. Arima K. Okamoto J. Klevit R.E. Fukuda M. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3916-3924Google Scholar). These observations suggest that ubiquitination mediated by BRCA1-BARD1 could signal a process other than degradation. Another key issue to connect the Ub ligase activity to the biological function of BRCA1 is the identification of its specific substrate(s). Because BRCA1 interacts with a number of proteins and functions in a variety of cellular processes, many candidate substrates for the BRCA1-BARD1 Ub ligase have been suggested including histone H2A or H2AX, the large subunit of RNA polymerase II and FANCD2 (1Venkitaraman A.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 171-182Google Scholar, 4Baer R. Ludwig T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 86-91Google Scholar, 9Parvin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5952-5954Google Scholar). However, the in vivo evidence for those substrates remains to be determined. In this paper we demonstrate nucleophosmin/B23 (NPM) as a novel candidate substrate for the BRCA1-BARD1 Ub ligase that connects the ligase activity with the known biological functions of BRCA1. Antibodies, Expression Constructs, and Purified Proteins—Mouse monoclonal antibodies to HA (12CA5, Roche Applied Science), Myc (9E10, BabCo), FLAG (M2, Sigma), α- and β-tubulin (DM1A+BM1B, Neomarkers), and NPM (Sigma or Zymed Laboratories Inc.) as well as rabbit polyclonal antibody to BRCA1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog number sc-642) were purchased commercially. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to BARD1 that was used for immunoblotting was a gift from Dr. Richard Baer (Columbia University). For immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation rabbit polyclonal antibody made against the C terminus of BARD1 was generated to the synthesized peptide CVMS-FELLPLDS and affinity purified before use. cDNA for full-length human NPM (B23.1) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a HeLa cell cDNA library using Pfx polymerase (Stratagene) and subcloned into pcDNA3 or pET vector in frame with appropriate N-terminal tag. Mammalian expression plasmids for BRCA1, BARD1, and quadruple repeated HA-Ub were described previously (2Hashizume R. Fukuda M. Maeda I. Nishikawa H. Oyake D. Yabuki Y. Ogata H. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14537-14540Google Scholar, 8Nishikawa H. Ooka S. Sato K. Arima K. Okamoto J. Klevit R.E. Fukuda M. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3916-3924Google Scholar). Rabbit E1 (Affiniti Research Products), bovine Ub (Sigma), and FLAG-Ub (Sigma) were purchased commercially. His-UbcH5c, His-BRCA11–304, and His-BARD114–189 were described previously (2Hashizume R. Fukuda M. Maeda I. Nishikawa H. Oyake D. Yabuki Y. Ogata H. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14537-14540Google Scholar). Full-length His-FLAG-NPM was obtained by two-step purification using nickel-agarose beads followed by anti-FLAG-cross-linked agarose beads. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunological Techniques—Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic agent (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected using the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method as previously described (10Ohta T. Michel J.J. Schottelius A.J. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 535-541Google Scholar). Total plasmid DNA was adjusted to be equal by adding the parental pcDNA3 vector. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting methods, including the detection of in vivo ubiquitinated substrates, as well as in vitro Ub ligation assay were described previously (2Hashizume R. Fukuda M. Maeda I. Nishikawa H. Oyake D. Yabuki Y. Ogata H. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14537-14540Google Scholar, 8Nishikawa H. Ooka S. Sato K. Arima K. Okamoto J. Klevit R.E. Fukuda M. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3916-3924Google Scholar). Screening Using Mass Spectrometry—The Ub ligation reaction was performed using FLAG-Ub, E1, His-UbcH5c, and anti-Myc immunocomplexes immobilized on protein A-agarose beads precipitated from 293T cells expressing Myc-BRCA11–772 and BARD1 as described (8Nishikawa H. Ooka S. Sato K. Arima K. Okamoto J. Klevit R.E. Fukuda M. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3916-3924Google Scholar). The supernatant from 10 reactions (30 μl each) was collected and incubated with a 30-μl volume of anti-FLAG antibody-cross linked beads (Sigma). The proteins conjugated with FLAG-Ub were eluted off the beads in 30 μl of 25 mm anmonium bicarbonate containing 0.1 mg/ml of FLAG peptide and digested with 7.4 μg/ml trypsin for 20 h at 30 °C. Alternatively, proteins interacting with the complex of HA-BARD11–408 and either wild-type or mutant (I26A) FLAG-BRCA11–222 were immunoprecipitated and eluted with FLAG peptide, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and stained with Sypro Ruby (Molecular Probe). The bands of interest were excised from the gel and digested with trypsin using the In Gel Digest Kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The peptide fragments were subjected to liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) analysis as described (8Nishikawa H. Ooka S. Sato K. Arima K. Okamoto J. Klevit R.E. Fukuda M. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3916-3924Google Scholar). The acquired collision-induced dissociation spectra were analyzed by Mascot software. Indirect Immunocytochemistry—Proliferating cells were fixed with 3% formalin for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, and stained with indicated antibodies. For detection of BRCA1 and NPM colocalization at spindle poles, cells were fixed with cold methanol and permeablized with 0.1% Triton X-100 buffer as described elsewhere (11Hsu L.C. White R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12983-12988Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were diluted in the blocking buffer at the following concentrations: anti-NPM (0.5 μg/ml), anti-α/β-tubulin (1 μg/ml), anti-BARD1 (3 μg/ml), and anti-BRCA1 (2 μg/ml). Fluorescein isothiocyanate or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immuno-Research) were used at 1:50 dilution. The nucleus was counterstained with 0.5 μm TO-PRO-3 (Molecular Probes), cells were then mounted with fluorescent mounting medium (Bio-Rad) and examined with a confocal laser scan microscope (LSM 510, Carl Zeiss). Identification of NPM in BRCA1-BARD1 Immunocomplexes—To determine the biological significance of Ub ligase activity of BRCA1-BARD1, we searched for candidate substrates using two different approaches. First, hypothesizing that Ub ligase immunocomplexes may contain substrates, we performed in vitro polyubiquitination of BRCA1-BARD1 immunocomplexes and analyzed the polyubiquitinated products by nanoscale capillary LC/MS/MS analysis (Fig. 1A). Of the proteins identified, NPM exhibited the highest possibility with 17 peptides displaying a probability based Mowse score of 126. Second, presuming that substrate proteins would associate with a Ub ligase transiently and that this association could be stabilized by the loss of ligase activity, we compared the proteins associated with wild-type BRCA1-BARD1 ligase and catalytically inactive BRCA1 (I26A)-BARD1 ligase. The I26A mutation in BRCA1 retains the BARD1 interaction site, but it disrupts the interaction with UbcH5c resulting in a catalytically dead BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer enzyme (6Brzovic P.S. Keeffe J.R. Nishikawa H. Miyamoto K. Fox D. Fukuda M. Ohta T. Klevit R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5646-5651Google Scholar). A protein of ∼38–40 kDa was present in the mutant ligase complex at a higher level and was subjected to LC/MS/MS (Fig. 1B). Four peptides were obtained from the band, and all matched with NPM. Thus, two different screening approaches identified the same protein, NPM. The interaction between BRCA1-BARD1 and NPM in vivo was confirmed by transient transfection followed by immunoprecipitation (IP)-Western analysis (Fig. 1C). 293T cells were cotransfected with Myc-BRCA11–772, HA-BARD1, and FLAG-NPM. In vivo association of NPM with the BRCA1-BARD1 complex was demonstrated by reciprocal immunoprecipitation-Western analysis (lane 4). Omitting either BRCA1 or BARD1 from the transfection abolished the interaction with NPM (lanes 1 and 2). This suggests that the NPM interaction is dependent on BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer formation. N-terminal fragments of BRCA11–222 and BARD11–320 were also capable of interacting with NPM (Fig. 1B and data not shown). To obtain evidence for endogenous BRCA1-BARD1-NPM association under physiological conditions, 293T cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with antibodies to BARD1, and precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 1D). BARD1 (lane 1, upper panel) and NPM (lane 1, lower panel) were readily detected in the BRCA1 immunocomplexes and were specifically competed by BARD1 antigen peptide (lane 2). Thus, NPM appears to physically interact with and may represent a substrate of the BRCA1-BARD1 ligase complex. Colocalization of NPM with BRCA1-BARD1 during Mitosis—To further verify the in vivo interaction of NPM with BRCA1-BARD1, the subcellular localization of these proteins was examined (Fig. 2). With formalin fixation it was observed that NPM predominantly localized to nucleoli in interphase cells as reported previously, while BARD1 was absent (Fig. 2A, three cells at the left of each panel). However, in mitotic cells, NPM colocalized with BARD1 most intensely over the chromosomal surfaces and the perichromosomal cytoplasm (Fig. 2A, a cell at the right of each panel). It has been individually reported that both BRCA1 (11Hsu L.C. White R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12983-12988Google Scholar) and NPM (12Zatsepina O.V. Rousselet A. Chan P.K. Olson M.O. Jordan E.G. Bornens M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 455-466Google Scholar) localize to the spindle poles when using methanol fixation. Therefore, we next examined the colocalization of BRCA1 and NPM under these reported conditions (11Hsu L.C. White R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12983-12988Google Scholar). As expected, BRCA1 localized to the spindle poles during mitosis (Fig. 2B) and colocalizd with NPM (Fig. 2C). This suggests a cell cycle-dependent BRCA1-BARD1-NPM interaction and potential regulation of NPM by BRCA1-BARD1 during mitosis. NPM Ubiquitination by BRCA1-BARD1—To determine whether NPM is a substrate of the BRCA1-BARD1 Ub ligase, FLAG-NPM was co-expressed in 293T cells with HA-tagged Ub, Myc-BRCA11–772, and BARD1 (Fig. 3A). Cells were collected 36 h after transfection and boiled in 1% SDS containing buffers to dissociate non-covalently bound proteins, and FLAG-NPM was immunoprecipitated. Immunoblotting of NPM precipitates using anti-HA antibody demonstrated a ladder characteristic of polyubiquitinated NPM (lane 3, upper panel). Immunoblotting of the same sample with anti-FLAG antibody also exhibited a band migrating slower than FLAG-NPM (lane 3, lower panel). Omission of FLAG-NPM, HA-Ub, Myc-BRCA11–772, or BARD1 all abolished the NPM ladders supporting the idea of BRCA1-BARD1-dependent NPM ubiquitination. In a parallel in vivo ligase assay, another RING type E3 ligase, MDM2, promoted efficient ubiquitination of its known substrate, tumor suppressor p53, but exhibited no detectable activity toward NPM (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 6). Conversely, BRCA1-BARD1 did not cause noticeable p53 ubiquitination (lanes 2). To eliminate the possibility that NPM ubiquitination was caused by misfolding due to ectopic overexpression, we examined whether endogenous NPM is also ubiquitinated by BRCA1-BARD1 (Fig. 3C). HA-tagged Ub was co-expressed in 293T cells with Myc-BRCA11–772 and BARD1. Endogenous NPM was immunoprecipitated, and NPM ubiquitination was analyzed by immunoblot using anti-HA antibody. Polyubiquitinated NPM was readily detected when wild-type ligase was added (lane 4), whereas it was abolished when the I26A mutation was substituted in BRCA1 (lane 5), demonstrating a dependence upon the Ub ligase activity of BRCA1-BARD1. It was possible that the observed in vivo NPM polyubiquitination could be an indirect effect of BRCA1-BARD1 through another endogenous E3 ligase. We therefore determined the type of poly-Ub chains incorporated into the NPM polyubiquitinated protein by using an HA-tagged Ub that has a single Lys residue available for conjugation. In vivo NPM polyubiquitination by BRCA1-BARD1 was predominantly detected when HA-UbLys-6 or HA-UbLys-29, but not HA-UbLys-11, HA-UbLys-48, or HA-UbLys-63, was co-expressed (supplemental Fig. 1). This is consistent with our previous observation that BRCA1-BARD1 preferentially utilizes HA-UbLys-6 or HA-UbLys-29 for BRCA1 autoubiquitination (8Nishikawa H. Ooka S. Sato K. Arima K. Okamoto J. Klevit R.E. Fukuda M. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3916-3924Google Scholar). Hence, the results suggest that the in vivo NPM polyubiquitination observed is directly catalyzed by BRCA1-BARD1. To further test whether BRCA1-BARD1 directly catalyzes NPM polyubiquitination, we performed in vitro NPM ubiquitination using a fully recombinant system (Fig. 3D). Recombinant His-FLAG-NPM purified from bacteria incubated with purified Ub, E1, E2/His-UbcH5c, His-BRCA11–304, and His-BARD114–189 resulted in two slowly migrating products detected by anti-FLAG immunoblot (lane 7). Omission of substrate NPM, Ub, E2/His-UbcH5c, BRCA1, or BARD1 all abolished NPM ubiquitination. This demonstrates BRCA1-BARD1-dependent NPM ubiquitination in a purified system. NPM Ubiquitination by BRCA1-BARD1 Is Not a Signal for Proteasomal Degradation—BRCA1-BARD1 catalyzes untraditional Lys-6-linked poly-Ub chain formations (7Wu Baer F. Lagrazon K. Yuan W. Baer R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34743-34746Google Scholar, 8Nishikawa H. Ooka S. Sato K. Arima K. Okamoto J. Klevit R.E. Fukuda M. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3916-3924Google Scholar). The discovery of NPM as a substrate prompted us to test whether BRCA1-BARD1-mediated NPM ubiquitination targets NPM for degradation by measuring its stability in vivo. The steady state level of FLAG-NPM expressed in 293T cells was increased rather than decreased by co-expression of BRCA1-BARD1 in a dose-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. 2A). Pulse-chase analysis also supports that BRCA1-BARD1 stabilizes NPM (supplemental Fig. 2B). These findings suggest that BRCA1-BARD1-mediated NPM ubiquitination affects the function of NPM through a non-proteolytic mechanism. We show in this study that the acidic nucleolar phosphoprotein NPM is a substrate ubiquitinated by the BRCA1-BARD1 E3 ligase in vitro and in vivo. Although the implication between the functions of BRCA1 and NPM has not been previously proposed, most of NPM functions, interestingly, overlap with or implicate BRCA1. Located mainly in the nucleolus, its primary function is thought to be ribosomal biogenesis (13Savkur R.S. Olson M.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4508-4515Google Scholar, 14Itahana K. Bhat K.P. Jin A. Itahana Y. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1151-1164Google Scholar). However, many other functions of NPM have been reported including up-regulation by genotoxic stress (15Yang C. Maiguel D.A. Carrier F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2251-2260Google Scholar, 16Wu M.H. Yung B.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48234-48240Google Scholar) and a role as an apoptosis inhibitor (17Liu W.H. Yung B.Y. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3055-3064Google Scholar). Similar to the function of its related family member nucleoplasmin, NPM also possesses histone chaperone activity in chromatin remodeling (18Okuwaki M. Matsumoto K. Tsujimoto M. Nagata K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 272-276Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of NPM by BRCA1-BARD1 may alter its histone chaperone activity and contribute to the chromatin remodeling function of BRCA1 or transcriptional regulation by BRCA1. In addition to these functions, NPM also regulates centrosome duplication. NPM interacts with the centrosome and protects it from duplication in G1 phase (19Okuda M. Horn H.F. Tarapore P. Tokuyama Y. Smulian A.G. Chan P.K. Knudsen E.S. Hofmann I.A. Snyder J.D. Bove K.E. Fukasawa K. Cell. 2000; 103: 127-140Google Scholar). Dissociation of NPM from the centrosome allows its duplication process during S phase, while daughter centrioles develop into two mature centrosomes (spindle poles) (19Okuda M. Horn H.F. Tarapore P. Tokuyama Y. Smulian A.G. Chan P.K. Knudsen E.S. Hofmann I.A. Snyder J.D. Bove K.E. Fukasawa K. Cell. 2000; 103: 127-140Google Scholar). In mitosis, NPM reassociates with the centrosome (12Zatsepina O.V. Rousselet A. Chan P.K. Olson M.O. Jordan E.G. Bornens M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 455-466Google Scholar). This reassociation is thought to be important to protect the cell from centrosome hyper-amplification that causes chromosome instability and aneuploidy. It is known that targeted disruption of the Brca1 gene in mouse also resulted in centrosome hyper-amplification and genomic instability (20Xu X. Weaver Z. Linke S.P. Li C. Gotay J. Wang X.W. Harris C.C. Ried T. Deng C.X. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 389-395Google Scholar). As shown in this report, NPM colocalized with BRCA1 and BARD1 during mitosis (Fig. 2). BRCA1 expression has been reported to be cell cycle dependent, with the greatest expression occurring in G2 and M phases (Ref. 21Jin Y. Xu X.L. Yang M.C. Wei F. Ayi T.C. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12075-12080Google Scholar and data not shown). Because BRCA1 and BARD1 stabilize each other (2Hashizume R. Fukuda M. Maeda I. Nishikawa H. Oyake D. Yabuki Y. Ogata H. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14537-14540Google Scholar), it is likely that the Ub ligase activity of BRCA1-BARD1 is accelerated at these stages, and NPM is exposed to the boosted activity when the nucleolus is broken down during mitosis. Ubiquitination of NPM by BRCA1-BARD1 could be important for the redistribution of NPM to the spindle poles. The defect of the Ub ligase activity of BRCA1 may result in a reduced amount of NPM at the centrosome during G1 phase and, consequently, centrosome hyper-amplification. The ubiquitination of NPM by BRCA1-BARD1 does not cause its degradation (supplemental Fig. 1). Instead, ubiquitination stabilized NPM protein. The significance of NPM stabilization, however, is not clear at present because NPM is an abundant protein. One notion is that BRCA1-BARD1 may allow for stabilization of NPM in a specific subcellular compartment. For example, NPM has characteristics typical of molecular chaperones including anti-aggregation activity and promoting the renaturation of denatured proteins (22Szebeni A. Hingorani K. Negi S. Olson M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9107-9115Google Scholar). NPM may act as a chaperone to prevent aggregation of proteins in condensed environments, such as the nucleolus, the chromosome, or the centrosome. The ubiquitination of NPM by BRCA1 may affect such a function. In another interesting twist, it recently was reported that tumor suppressor ARF also causes ubiquitination of NPM (14Itahana K. Bhat K.P. Jin A. Itahana Y. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1151-1164Google Scholar). However, the ubiquitination by ARF resulted in NPM degradation suggesting that a Ub ligase other than BRCA1-BARD1 mediates this pathway. One possibility is that Lys-6-linked ubiquitination by BRCA1-BARD1 may protect NPM from a Lys-48-linking ligase by competing for the site(s) of ubiquitination. Thus, it is possible that distinct ubiquitinations of NPM have specific biochemical functions. Future work exploring the detailed mechanisms of the BRCA1-NPM pathway may provide new insight into the roles of BRCA1 in tumor suppression. We thank Dr. Yue Xiong, Dr. Rachel E.

Granules were rapidly coated with F-actin in response to either agonist stimulation or photolysis of a caged-Ca2+ compound. Such F-actin coating occurred exclusively at the surface of granules undergoing exocytosis and was prevented either by latrunculin-A, which inhibits actin polymerization, or by Clostridium botulinum exoenzyme C3, which inhibits the small GTPase Rho. Latrunculin-A or exoenzyme C3 also triggered the formation of vacuoles in acinar cells, a characteristic of acute pancreatitis. Stimulation of acini with high concentrations of cholecystokinin, which cause acute pancreatitis in mice, also impaired the F-actin coating of granules and induced vacuole formation. Latrunculin-A reduced the latency to exocytosis but did not affect the total number of exocytic events, suggesting that F-actin slows and further stabilizes exocytosis by facilitating F-actin coating. Rho-dependent F-actin coating of granule membranes thus stabilizes exocytic structures and is necessary for physiological progression of sequetial compound exocytosis in the exocrine pancreas and for prevention of acute pancreatitis.

Reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in a variety of cellular activities that range from cell migration and platelet aggregation to dendritic spine motility (1Etienne-Manneville S.

Although this F-actin coat is thought to constitute a barrier to exocytosis (4Muallem S. Kwiatkowska K. Xu X. Yin H.L. J.

Reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is also implicated in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis (13Burnham D.B. Williams J.A. Cell Tissue Res. 1982; 222: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 14O'Konski M.S. Pandol S.J. J. Clin.

Bradley III, E.L. Acute Pancreatitis: Diagnosis and Therapy. Raven, New York1994: 35-45Google Scholar). In animal models of this condition, protracted agonist stimulation results in both actin reorganization and vacuole formation (18Lampel M. Kern H.F. Virchows Arch. A Pathol. Anat. Histol. 1977; 373: 97-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 19Raraty M. Ward J. Erdemli G. Vaillant C. Neoptolemos J.P. Sutton R. Petersen O.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the relation between vacuole formation and F-actin reorganization has not been clarified. Elucidation of the dynamic control of F-actin distribution during exocytosis in exocrine cells has not been possible by classical confocal microscopy because this technique lacks the tissue depth penetration necessary to visualize the fine organization of the apical plasma membrane within intact acini (10Nemoto T. Kimura R. Ito K. Tachikawa A. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In contrast, two-photon excitation microscopy has the ability to penetrate deep into tissues (10Nemoto T. Kimura R. Ito K. Tachikawa A. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 21Denk W. Strickler J.H. Webb W.W. Science. 1990; 248: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (8397) Google Scholar) and allows simultaneous multicolor imaging with various combinations of fluorescent tracers (10Nemoto T. Kimura R. Ito K. Tachikawa A. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 49Takahashi N. Kishimoto T. Nemoto T. Kadowaki T. Kasai H. Science. 2002; 297: 1349-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of these attributes of two-photon excitation microscopy, we have now investigated actin dynamics associated with physiological and pathological exocytosis in pancreatic acinar cells. Preparation of Mouse Pancreatic Acini—Clusters of acini were isolated from the pancreas of 5–7-week-old mice by a brief (4-min) digestion with collagenase (1 mg ml–1; Wako, Osaka, Japan) followed by gentle trituration. The acini were dispersed in a small chamber and superfused (1 ml min–1) with a solution (solution A) containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.3), and 10 mm glucose. For the experiment shown in Fig. 3, G and H, dispersed acini were cultured under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Waymouth solution (Sigma) supplemented with penicillin (100 units ml–1; Invitrogen), streptomycin (0.1 mg ml–1; Invitrogen), 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma), soybean trypsin inhibitor (0.2 mg ml–1; Sigma), and 2.5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). The culture dishes were coated thickly with a collagen gel (MatriGel; BD Bio-sciences) to preserve cell polarity. All experiments done were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Okazaki National Research Institutes. Two-photon Excitation Imaging—For the visualization of exocytosis, pancreatic acini were immersed in solution A containing a fluid-phase polar tracer, either 0.5–1 mm sulforhodamine B (SRB 1The abbreviations used are: SRB, sulforhodamine B; CCK, cholecystokinin; NP-EGTA, o-nitrophenyl EGTA; LatA, latrunculin-A. ; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) or 0.5 mm cascade blue dextran (10 kDa; Molecular Probes). Cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK; Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan) was dissolved in solution A containing tracer and applied to cells through a glass pipette. All experiments were performed at room temperature (22–25 °C). For the visualization of F-actin or G-actin, acini were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then stained with Alexa 488-phalloidin (0.17 μm; Molecular Probes) or Texas red-conjugated DNase I (0.3 μm; Molecular Probes) in phosphate-buffered saline. For the simultaneous imaging of both F-actin and fused granules, acini were immersed in a solution containing cascade blue dextran and stimulated for 1–10 min before fixation. latrunculin-A (LatA) (Molecular Probes) and cytochalasin D (Sigma) were first dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (10 mm; Sigma) and then diluted into solution A. Two-photon excitation imaging of pancreatic acinar cells was performed as described (10Nemoto T. Kimura R. Ito K. Tachikawa A. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were imaged with an inverted microscope (IX70; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and a laser-scanning microscope (FV300, Olympus) equipped with a water-immersion objective lens (UPlanApo60× W/IR; numerical aperture, 1.2). A mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser (Tsunami, Spectra Physics) with an original pulse duration of 70–100 fs was attached to the laser port of the laser-scanning microscope; the group velocity dispersion of the microscope was compensated for by a set of chirp compensation optics. The laser power at the specimen was 4–5 milliwatts, and the excitation wavelength was 830 nm for SRB, fura-2FF, Alexa 488, and Texas red and 720 nm for cascade blue and Alexa 488. The fluorescence of SRB or Texas red was measured at 570–650 nm, whereas that of fura-2FF or Alexa 488 was detected at 400–550 nm. For the double-staining experiments with Alexa 488 and cascade blue, the fluorescence was measured at 515–650 and 400–490 nm, respectively. Fluorescence was detected by photomultiplier tubes (R7683; Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) in the FV300 microscope, and fluorescence images were acquired every 0.5–2 s. The fluorescence intensity of Alexa 488-phalloidin at the apical membrane was compared among preparations by quantifying fluorescence in the membrane region identified by cascade blue dextran imaging (see Fig. 2A). The 12-bit images were analyzed and color-coded with “fall,” “gray,” “green,” or “red” look-up tables of the image acquisition and analysis software, either Fluoview of the FV300 microscope or IPLab Spectrum (Scanalytics, Fairfax, VA). Stacked images (see Figs. 1, D–G, 2, A and E, and 3) correspond to the maximum intensity plots reconstituted from a series of xy images along the z axis acquired by xyz scanning by the microscope in the “extended focus mode” of Fluoview software. Supplementary movie files were converted with QuickTime Pro software (Apple, Cupertino, CA).Fig. 1F-actin coating of zymogen granules.A, a two-photon fluorescence image under resting conditions of a pancreatic acinus loaded with the acetoxymethyl ester (AM) of the Ca2+ indicator fura-2FF.

The images were obtained with the microscope and objective lens used in D and E, but fluorescence was excited with a CW laser at 488 nm instead of with a mode-locked laser at 830 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) For the simultaneous imaging of [Ca2+]i and exocytosis, acini were preloaded for 30 min with fura-2FF-AM (20 μm; TEF Labs, Dallas, TX) in solution A. The [Ca2+]i values were calculated from the fluorescence of fura-2FF as described (10Nemoto T. Kimura R. Ito K. Tachikawa A. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). A mercury lamp (U-YLS100HG, Olympus) was used as an actinic light source for the caged-Ca2+ compound o-nitrophenyl EGTA (NP-EGTA). The lamp was connected to a two-port light guide (IX-RFA-caged, Olympus). The radiation from the actinic light was filtered by a UV band-pass filter (320–360 nm) and gated (250 ms) through an electric shutter (IX-ESU, Olympus). A rapid increase in [Ca2+]i was triggered by UV photolysis of NP-EGTA, which was preloaded by incubation of acini with 10 μm NP-EGTA-AM (Molecular Probes) in solution A for 30 min. Rapid F-actin Coating of Zymogen Granules—Two-photon excitation imaging allows direct visualization of zymogen granule exocytosis in pancreatic acini (Fig. 1, A and C) that have been immersed in a solution containing the polar tracer SRB, given that the tracer rapidly diffuses into individual granules that have fused with the plasma membrane (10Nemoto T. Kimura R. Ito K. Tachikawa A. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Two-photon imaging also allows simultaneous monitoring of the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) (Fig. 1B). CCK (100 pm) induced micromolar increases in [Ca2+]i, which in turn triggered pronounced exocytosis of zymogen granules at the apical membrane of acinar cells in a sequential manner. Granules present within deeper layers of the cell thus frequently underwent exocytosis by fusing with the Ω-shaped profiles of granules that had already fused with the apical membrane, resulting in the formation of grapelike clusters of fused structures (Fig. 1C; see Supplementary Movie 1) (10Nemoto T. Kimura R. Ito K. Tachikawa A. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The Ω-shaped profiles of fused granules were stable for an average of ∼3 min (see Fig. 5C). To elucidate the molecular basis of this stability of the Ω-shaped profiles, we investigated F-actin organization by staining of fixed preparations with Alexa 488-labeled phalloidin, which binds specifically to F-actin. In resting cells, a dense coat of F-actin was apparent at the apical membrane but not surrounding secretory granules (Fig. 1D) (22Drenckhahn D. Mannherz H.G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 30: 167-176PubMed Google Scholar). After stimulation with 100 pm CCK, however, F-actin also coated secretory granules adjacent to the apical membrane (Fig. 1E). In contrast to the two-photon imaging, one-photon confocal microscopy was not able to detect such F-actin coating of granules (Fig. 1, F and G) as a result of the intense light scattering by zymogen granules (10Nemoto T. Kimura R. Ito K. Tachikawa A. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), instead only revealing a rather diffuse spread of F-actin into the cytosol in response to CCK, as described in previous studies (11Schafer C. Ross S.E. Bragado M.J. Groblewski G.E. Ernst S.A. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24173-24180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 23Torgerson R.R. McNiven M.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 438-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To determine whether F-actin coating occurred selectively on granules undergoing exocytosis, we labeled exocytic profiles with a fixable fluorescent dextran (cascade blue dextran) during stimulation of acini with 100 pm CCK for 60 s and, after fixation, counterstained the cells with Alexa 488-phalloidin (Fig. 2A). The cluster of Ω-shaped profiles stained with cascade blue dextran (red) coincided exclusively with that of ring-like profiles of F-actin coats stained with Alexa 488-phalloidin (green). On average, 33% (4–50%, S.E. = 7%, n = 7 cells) of secretory granule areas at the apical pole of acinar cells, which were identified by negative staining with fura-2FF (10Nemoto T. Kimura R. Ito K. Tachikawa A. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), was filled with exocytic granules, which were labeled with SRB during CCK stimulation for 10 min. These observations suggested that F-actin coating occurred selectively on all granules that underwent exocytosis. In these experiments, when exocytosis was followed in live cell, it was still active with a rate of 0.05–0.27 events/second/cell at the time of fixation (60 s). The observation that all of the granules undergoing exocytosis were coated with F-actin therefore suggests that the coating was induced within 3.7 s (1/0.27 s) after the onset of exocytosis. Homogeneous and large increases in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2, B and C) induced by UV flash photolysis of a caged-Ca2+ compound, NP-EGTA, gave rise to sequential exocytosis (Fig. 2D) similar to that elicited by agonist stimulation (Fig. 1C), consistent with the notion suggested previously (10Nemoto T. Kimura R. Ito K. Tachikawa A. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) that sequential exocytosis does not depend on gradients of [Ca2+]i. The granules undergoing exocytosis in response to photolysis of the caged-Ca2+ compound were also selectively coated with F-actin (Fig. 2E), indicating that neither receptor activation (24Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar) nor spatial heterogeneity of [Ca2+]i (25Kasai H. Augustine G.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) is required for this phenomenon. Mechanism of F-actin Coating—To examine the role of actin polymerization in the F-actin coating of granule membranes, we investigated the effects of LatA, a membrane-permeable inhibitor of actin polymerization that binds with high affinity to actin monomer (G-actin) (26Coue M. Brenner S.L. Spector I. Korn E.D. FEBS Lett. 1987; 213: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with LatA (10 μm, 30 min) prevented the F-actin coating of all granules that underwent exocytosis during stimulation of acini with 100 pm CCK for 1 min (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, large vacuoles were apparent in such preparations fixed 10 min after the onset of stimulation with CCK (Fig. 3B); these vacuoles were not coated with F-actin. The formation of similar vacuoles was seldom detected in acini not treated with LatA before stimulation with 100 pm CCK. It was, however, induced by high concentrations (10–100 nm) of CCK in the absence of LatA (Fig. 3C) (19Raraty M. Ward J. Erdemli G. Vaillant C. Neoptolemos J.P. Sutton R. Petersen O.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13126-13131Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), indicating that the F-actin coating of granules was impaired at such high doses of agonist, which are known to induce acute pancreatitis in mice (20Steer M.L. Baillieres Best Pract. Res. Clin. Gastroenterol. 1999; 13: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The coating of granules with F-actin during stimulation with 100 pm CCK was found to require the small GTPase Rho, based on the observation that such coating was prevented by pretreatment of freshly isolated acini with Clostridium botulinum exoenzyme C3 (50 μg ml–1) for 2 h (Fig. 3D). This bacterial enzyme inhibits the activity of Rho without affecting that of other members of the Rho subfamily of small GTPases such as Cdc42 or Rac (27Morii N. Narumiya S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Stimulation of exoenzyme C3-pretreated acini with CCK also induced the formation of vacuoles, which were not coated with F-actin (Fig. 3D). The rapid Rho-dependent F-actin coating of granules undergoing exocytosis thus appeared to be necessary to prevent vacuole formation. We found that actin polymerization occurred constitutively at the apical plasma membrane. The fluorescence intensity of Alexa 488-phalloidin-labeled F-actin at the apical membrane was thus substantially reduced in acini treated with 10 μm LatA for 30 min without agonist stimulation (288 ± 19 arbitrary units; mean ± S.E., n = 11 cells, p < 0.01) (Fig. 3E) as compared with that in control acini (1192 ± 52 arbitrary units, n = 18) (Fig. 1D). In contrast, treatment of acini for 2 h with exoenzyme C3 (50 μg ml–1) did not result in a marked reduction in F-actin coating at the apical membrane (Fig. 3F). The fluorescence intensity of Alexa 488-phalliodin at the apical membrane in such acini (1238 ± 81 arbitrary units, n = 12 cells) did not differ significantly from that in control acini (p > 0.05). Exposure of cultured acini to exoenzyme C3 for 3 days, however, almost completely eliminated the F-actin coat at the apical membrane (58 ± 6 arbitrary units; mean ± S.E., n = 24) as compared with that in control cultured cells (982 ± 109 arbitrary units, n = 13) without reducing the abundance of G-actin in the cytosol, as revealed by staining with Texas red-conjugated DNase I (Fig. 3, G and H). Rho-dependent actin polymerization thus occurs at the apical membrane but at a slow rate, and it might be activated in the granule membrane after exocytosis (see “Discussion”). Real-time Imaging of Vacuole Formation—We next investigated the formation of vacuoles by real-time imaging of acini immersed in a solution containing SRB. Vacuole formation was rarely detected in acini (<3%, n = 90 cells) stimulated with 100 pm CCK for up to 10 min (Fig. 1C). In contrast, abnormal round vacuoles with a diameter of >2 μm were formed by the merger of fused granules within 100 s after stimulation with 100 pm CCK in 93% of acini (n = 29 cells) that had been pretreated with LatA (10 μm) for 30 min (Fig. 4A; see Supplementary Movie 2). The vacuoles subsequently expanded, exhibiting mean diameters of 2.4 ± 0.1 (mean ± S.E., n = 13) and 4.6 ± 1.3 μm (n = 20) at 100 and 300 s after stimulation. To quantify vacuole formation and expansion, we classified newly formed luminal profiles as vacuolar (spherical expanding structures with a maximal diameter of >2 μm) or normal (Ω-shaped) (Fig. 4, C–E). The proportion of vacuoles was estimated as lv/(ln + lv), where lv and ln are the lengths of vacuolar and normal outlines, respectively. The values were <2 and 78% in control and LatA-pretreated preparations, respectively, at 300 s after the onset of stimulation with 100 pm CCK (Fig. 4F). Pretreatment with other inhibitors of actin polymerization, including cytochalasin D (10 μm, 30 min) (28Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1473-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar) and exoenzyme C3 (50 μg ml–1, 2 h), also increased the proportion of vacuoles to 72% (n = 7 cells) and 38% (n = 6), respectively, at 300 s after stimulation with CCK (100 pm). The spherical and expanding nature of vacuoles suggests that the granule contents swelled within them and that F-actin coating prevents such swelling by stabilizing the Ω-shaped profiles. The stability of Ω-profiles was directly quantified by measuring the lifetime of those formed by primary exocytic events that did not give rise to secondary exocytosis (Fig. 5A). Given that the time course of the flattening of the granule membrane into the plasma membrane was complex, we determined the lifetime of Ω-shaped profiles as the time required for their disappearance (Fig. 5B), which we estimated by straight-line fitting of the last 20 s of flattening (Fig. 5B). All three inhibitors of actin polymerization examined (LatA, cytochalasin D, exoenzyme C3) markedly reduced the lifetime of Ω-shaped profiles (Fig. 5C), supporting the notion that the profiles are stabilized by F-actin coating. The instability of Ω-shaped profiles is consistent with the generation of vacuoles in LatA-pretreated cells because these treatments did not significantly reduce the incidence of sequential exocytosis, which was 71.6 ± 7.4% (mean ± S.E., n = 19 cells) and 72.8 ± 6.0% (mean ± S.E., n = 14) in control and LatA-pretreated preparations, respectively, and because the granules that induced sequential exocytosis did not flatten into the plasma membrane (see Supplementary Movies 1 and 2). In LatA-pretreated preparations, Ω-shaped profiles of the granules that were involved in sequential exocytosis were also instable and gave rise to vacuole formation. As mentioned above, stimulation of acini with a high concentration (10 nm) of CCK alone triggered the generation of vacuoles (Fig. 4B; see Supplementary Movie 3). Indeed, the vacuolar proportion was 56% at 300 s after such stimulation (Fig. 4F), and the lifetime of primary Ω-profiles induced by stimulation with 10 nm CCK was reduced as compared with that of those elicited by stimulation with 100 pm agonist (Fig. 5C). A delay in the onset of vacuole formation was evident under such conditions, however, with the proportion of vacuoles being only 2.9% at 100 s after stimulation (p < 0.005) as compared with that in LatA-pretreated cells. These data suggest that stimulation of acini with a high concentration of CCK results in a slow destabilization of Ω-profiles, likely by impairment of the F-actin coating of granule membranes (Fig. 3C). Importantly, vacuole formation was rarely observed in the acini (5%, n = 60 cells) stimulated by photolysis of a caged-Ca2+ compound in which micromolar increases in [Ca2+]i persisted for more than 300 s (Fig. 2). The proportion of vacuole was less than 2% at 300 s after the stimulation. These data suggest that vacuole formation does not simply result from sustained increases in [Ca2+]i but requires receptor activation. Regulation of Exocytosis by F-actin Coating—Removal of the constitutive F-actin coat of the apical plasma membrane did not by itself trigger exocytosis, given that LatA alone did not induce exocytosis (data not shown). Moreover, the number of exocytic events in CCK-stimulated acini was not affected by pretreatment with LatA (Fig. 6, A and B). The number of exocytic events at the apical membrane (designated primary or first exocytosis; Fig. 6A) during stimulation with CCK (100 pm) for 10 min was thus not significantly (p > 0.05) affected by pretreatment of acini with LatA (10 μm) for 30 min (Fig. 6B), although the amount of F-actin at the apical membrane was markedly reduced by such LatA pretreatment (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, the number of secondary, tertiary, or quaternary exocytic events (second, third, or fourth exocytosis, respectively) (Fig. 6A) did not differ significantly between CCK-stimulated acini that had been pretreated with LatA and those that had not (Fig. 6B), although LatA completely inhibited the dynamic F-actin coating of granule membranes (Fig. 3, A and B). These results indicate that the size of the releasable pool of granules was not increased either by removal of the constitutive F-actin coat of the apical membrane or by prevention of the F-actin coating of granule membranes. To quantify the rate of exocytosis, we defined the latency to primary exocytosis (L1) as the time between the onset of the increase in [Ca2+]i and the formation of the first Ω-shaped profile, and we have defined the latency to secondary (L2) or tertiary (L3) exocytic events as the time between the corresponding sequential fusion reactions (Fig. 6A). The rate of exocytosis induced by CCK (100 pm) was increased slightly by LatA pretreatment (Fig. 6C), with L3 being significantly reduced by such pretreatment. It was possible, however, that LatA interfered with the agonist-evoked increase in [Ca2+]i (29Shin D.M. Zhao X.-S. Zeng W. Mozhayeva M. Muallem S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1101-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To exclude this latter possibility, we triggered exocytosis by inducing a rapid and homogeneous increase in [Ca2+]i through photolysis of NP-EGTA (Fig. 2B) (30Ito K. Miyashita Y. Kasai H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, latencies reflect t"

Glutamatecysteine ligase (GCL) catalyzes the first step in glutathione biosynthesis and plays an important role in regulating the intracellular redox environment. Because the putative Arabidopsis thaliana GCL (AtGCL) displays no significant homology to the GCL from bacteria and other eukaryotes, the identity of this protein as a GCL has been debated. We have purified AtGCL from an Escherichia coli expression system and demonstrated that the recombinant enzyme catalyzes the ATP-dependent formation of γ-glutamylcysteine from glutamate (Km = 9.1 mm) and cysteine (Km = 2.7 mm). Glutathione feedback inhibits AtGCL (Ki ∼1.0 mm). As with other GCL, buthionine sulfoximine and cystamine inactivate the Arabidopsis enzyme but with inactivation rates much slower than those of the mammalian, bacterial, and nematode enzymes. The slower inactivation rates observed with AtGCL suggest that the active site differs structurally from that of other GCL. Global fitting analysis of initial velocity data indicates that a random terreactant mechanism with a preferred binding order best describes the kinetic mechanism of AtGCL. Unlike the mammalian GCL, which consists of a catalytic subunit and a regulatory subunit, AtGCL functions and is regulated as a monomeric protein. In response to redox environment, AtGCL undergoes a reversible conformational change that modulates the enzymatic activity of the monomer.

These results explain the reported posttranslational change in AtGCL activity in response to oxidative stress. Regulation of the intracellular redox environment is critical in cellular physiology for influencing signaling pathways and cell fate in response to stress (1Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). In plants, as in other organisms, glutathione plays multiple roles as protection against various environmental stresses (2Noctor G. Foyer C.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 249-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4562) Google Scholar). As an antioxidant, glutathione quenches reactive oxygen species and is involved in the ascorbate-glutathione cycle that eliminates peroxide (2Noctor G. Foyer C.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 249-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4562) Google Scholar). Plants use glutathione for the detoxification of xenobiotics (3Matringe M. Scalla R. Plant Physiol. 1988; 86: 619-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), herbicides (4May M.J. Vernoux T. Leaver C. Van Montagu M. Inze D. J. Exp. Bot. 1998; 49: 649-667Google Scholar), air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and ozone (5Madamanchi N.R. Alscher R.G.

Science. 1985; 230: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Although glutathione accumulates in response to different stress stimuli in plants, the structural and kinetic properties of the plant enzymes responsible for its production remain biochemically uncharacterized. Glutathione synthesis occurs in two ATP-dependent steps. In the first reaction, glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) 1The abbreviations used are: GCL, glutamate-cysteine ligase (alternate name: γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase); AtGCL, Arabidopsis thaliana glutamate-cysteine ligase; DTT, D/L-dithiothreitol; ESI, electrospray ionization; MOPSO, 3-(N-morpholino)-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid; MS, mass spectrometry; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; TOF, time-of-flight; ter, ternary. (EC 6.3.2.2) catalyzes formation of the dipeptide γ-glutamylcysteine from cysteine and glutamate (Scheme I). Addition of glycine to the dipeptide occurs in a second reaction, catalyzed by glutathione synthetase. Of the two enzymes, GCL appears to be rate-limiting (8Richman P.G. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1422-1426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure to heavy metals increases the levels of GCL mRNA in Brassica juncea and activates transcription of both GCL and glutathione synthetase in Arabidopsis thaliana (9Schafer H.J. Greiner S. Rausch T. Haag-Kerwer A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 10Schafer H.J. Haag-Kerwer A. Rausch T. Plant Mol.

Overexpression of E. coli GCL in plants improves tolerance to cadmium and arsenic, demonstrating the importance of this enzyme in heavy metal protection (12Zhu Y.L. Pilon-Smits E.A. Tarun A.S. Weber S.U. Jouanin L. Terry N. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 1169-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 13Dhankher O.P. Li Y. Rosen B.P. Shi J. Salt D. Senecoff J.F. Sashti N.A. Meagher R.B. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1140-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Bioinformatic analysis of the GCL genes from multiple species suggests that these sequences group into three families (14Copley S.D. Dhillon J.K. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 25.1-25.16Crossref Google Scholar), 1) sequences from the γ-proteobacteria, such as Escherichia coli; 2) sequences from non-plant eukaryotes (mammals, Drosophila, and nematodes); and 3) sequences from plants (Arabidopsis) and α-proteobacteria (Rhizobium). Sequence comparisons within each family show similarity, but pairwise comparisons between groups display no statistically significant relationships (14Copley S.D. Dhillon J.K. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 25.1-25.16Crossref Google Scholar). For example, A. thaliana GCL (AtGCL) shares less than 15% amino acid sequence identity with the members of other families (15May M.J. Leaver C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10059-10063Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The differences among GCL sequences also reflect the functional properties of each family. Of the three GCL families, the enzymes from the non-plant eukaryotes are the best studied. The mammalian and Drosophila GCL consist of a 70-kDa catalytic or heavy subunit and a 30-kDa regulatory or light subunit (16Sekura R. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2599-2605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Fraser J.A. Saunders R.D.C. McLellan L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1158-1165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The heavy subunit catalyzes the formation of γ-glutamylcysteine and is inhibited by glutathione (18Seelig G.F. Simondsen R.P. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9345-9347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the light subunit increases the affinity of the enzyme for glutamate and decreases the inhibitory effect of glutathione (19Huang C.S. Chang L.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19675-19680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the GCL from Trypanosoma brucei and the mammalian catalytic subunit are related by 45% amino acid identity, but the T. brucei enzyme functions as a 77-kDa monomer with kinetic constants similar to the “activated” heterodimeric rat enzyme (20Lueder D.V. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17485-17490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). From the γ-proteobacteria family of GCL, the E. coli enzyme has been isolated and characterized as a functional 58-kDa monomeric protein (21Kelly B.S. Antholine W.E. Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). L−Glutamate+L−Cysteine+ATP→GCLL−γ−glutamyl−L−cysteine+ADP+Pi(SCHEME 1) The plant GCL are largely unexamined at the molecular level. Expression cloning isolated a cDNA from Arabidopsis that was unrelated to the mammalian, E. coli, or yeast GCL but complemented a GCL-deficient E. coli strain (14Copley S.D. Dhillon J.K. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 25.1-25.16Crossref Google Scholar). However, doubts about the specificity of the assay used to measure GCL activity in cell lysates and the limited sequence similarity with other GCL have challenged the identity of the AtGCL clone (4May M.J. Vernoux T. Leaver C. Van Montagu M. Inze D. J. Exp. Bot. 1998; 49: 649-667Google Scholar, 22Brunhold C. Rennenberg H. Prog. Bot. 1996; 58: 164-186Google Scholar). To characterize the biochemical properties of the putative AtGCL, recombinant enzyme was expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. We demonstrate that the purified protein catalyzes the formation of γ-glutamylcysteine. Our analysis shows that the Arabidopsis enzyme shares some functional properties with the GCL from other species but is regulated differently than the GCL from either bacteria or non-plant eukaryotes. Materials—Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. synthesized all oligo-nucleotides used in this study. The pGEM-T Easy vector was obtained from Promega. E. coli Rosetta (DE3) cells were from Novagen. Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-agarose was bought from Qiagen. Benzamidine-Sepharose and the HiLoad 26/60 Superdex-75 FPLC column were from Amersham Biosciences. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were of ACS reagent quality or better. Cloning and Generation of Expression Vectors—AtGCL (GenBank Z29490) (15May M.J. Leaver C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10059-10063Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR from an Arabidopsis cDNA library using 5′-dCCATGGCATGGCGCTGCTGTCTCAAGCAGG-3′ as the forward primer (NcoI site is underlined, the AtGCL start codon is in bold, and two E. coli optimized codons are in italic) and 5′-dTTATAGACACCTTTTGTTCACGTCCCATTTTC-3′ as the reverse primer (the putative AtGCL stop codon is in bold). The 1.6-kb PCR product was subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). Automated nucleotide sequencing confirmed the fidelity of the PCR product (Washington University Sequencing Facility, St. Louis, MO). The pHIS8-AtGCL expression vector was constructed by digesting pGEM-T-AtGCL with NcoI and NotI and then ligating the fragment into a NcoI/NotI-digested pHIS8 vector (23Jez J.M. Ferrer J.L. Bowman M.E. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). An expression construct of AtGCL with a truncated N terminus (pHIS8-AtGCLΔ85) was generated by PCR using the appropriate oligonucleotides. Expression in E. coli and Protein Purification—Expression constructs were transformed into E. coli Rosetta (DE3) cells. Transformed E. coli were grown at 37 °C in Terrific broth containing 50 μg ml-1 kanamycin and 34 μg ml-1 chloramphenicol until A600 nm ∼0.8. After induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the cultures were grown at 18 °C for 6 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1% (v/v) Tween 20). After sonication and centrifugation, the supernatant was passed over a Ni2+-NTA column previously equilibrated with lysis buffer. His-tagged protein was eluted with elution buffer (wash buffer containing 250 mm imidazole). Incubation with thrombin during overnight dialysis at 4 °C against wash buffer removed the His-tag. Dialyzed protein was reloaded on a Ni2+-NTA column, and the flow-through was depleted of thrombin using a benzamidine-Sepharose column. The flow-through of this step was dialyzed overnight against 30% (v/v) glycerol, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl then loaded onto a Superdex-75 FPLC column equilibrated in the same buffer without glycerol. Enzyme Assays—The activity of AtGCL was determined spectrophotometrically at 25 °C by measuring the rate of ADP formation using a coupled assay with pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. A standard reaction mixture (0.5 ml) contained 100 mm MOPSO (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm cysteine, 20 mm sodium glutamate, 5 mm disodium ATP, 2 mm sodium phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mm NADH, 5 units of type III rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase, and 10 units of type II rabbit muscle lactate dehydrogenase. Reactions were initiated by adding AtGCL (50 μg). The rate of decrease in A340 nm was followed using a Cary Bio300 spectrophotometer. Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined by initial velocity experiments. Measurements of the kcat and Km values for glutamate (1-80 mm) were made at 20 mm ATP and 20 mm cysteine. Kinetic constants for cysteine (0.1-20 mm) were measured at 20 mm ATP and 80 mm glutamate. For determination of the kinetic constants for ATP (0.25-20 mm), 20 mm cysteine and 80 mm glutamate were used. Kinetic parameters were calculated to fit untransformed data to v = kcat[S]/(Km + [S]) using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software). Inhibition and Inactivation Assays—For glutathione inhibition of AtGCLΔ85, initial velocities were determined spectrophotometrically using the standard assay system. Enzyme activity was determined after addition of glutathione (0-5 mm) to assay solutions containing either varied glutamate (1-40 mm) or cysteine (0.5-20 mm). Global fitting analysis was used to simultaneously fit all data to the equation for non-competitive inhibition, v = Vmax/((1 + [I]/Ki)(1 + Km/[S])) in SigmaPlot (Systat Software, Inc.). The time-dependent inactivation of AtGCLΔ85 by buthionine sulfoximine and cystamine was performed as follows. AtGCLΔ85 (125 μg) was incubated (37 °C) in 100 μl of 0.1 m MOPSO (pH 7.0) and 20 mm MgCl2 in the presence of either 0-50 mm cystamine or 10 mm ATP and 0-50 mm buthionine sulfoximine. All incubations were initiated by the addition of the inactivator. Aliquots (20 μl) were withdrawn from the incubation mixture and diluted into the standard assay system and then the enzymatic activity remaining was determined. All inactivation experiments were monitored relative to a control sample without inactivator, which is set to 100% activity at each time point. Inactivation data were plotted as log (% initial enzyme activity) versus time. Semilog plots were fitted to the equation -dE/dt = k[I], where the disappearance of enzyme activity over time is related to the concentration of inactivator (I), multiplied by k, a rate constant. This allowed a determination of the half-life for inactivation (t1/2) at each [I]. A Kitz-Wilson analysis of the data was used to generate the limiting constant for inactivation (kinact) and Ki by plotting t½ versus 1/[I] (24Kitz R. Wilson I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3235-3239Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Analysis of the Kinetic Mechanism—Analysis of the kinetic mechanism of AtGCLΔ85 used global curve fitting (25Brekken D.L. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26317-26322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 26Emanuele J.J. Jin H. Yanchunas J. Villafranca J.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7264-7271Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The reaction rates were measured as described above using a matrix of substrate concentrations (glutamate, 2-40 mm; ATP, 0.5-20 mm; cysteine, 1-20 mm). In this matrix, the rate measured for the concentration of one substrate is measured over the entire range of the other two substrates. SigmaPlot was used for curve fitting and modeling of the kinetic data to rapid equilibrium rate equations of the possible ter-reactant kinetic mechanisms (27Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry—An Applied Biosystems QSTAR XL hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) system equipped with a nanoelectrospray source (Protana XYZ manipulator) was used for an accurate molecular weight determination. The nanoelectrospray was generated from a PicoTip needle (New Objectives, Inc.) at 1200 volts. The sample flow rate was estimated to be 100 nl min-1. The instrument m/z response was calibrated with standards from the manufacturer to provide molecular mass measurement accuracy of <30 ppm for proteins up to 50 kDa and of <5 ppm for lower mass peptides. For detection of protein complex species, data were acquired initially over the range m/z 900-10000 and later over a narrow mass range with intense signals. The accumulation time was 1 s, for 300 cycles. The two declustering potential parameters and focusing potential, i.e. DP, DP2, and FP, were 100, 15, and 300, respectively. To maintain protein complexes in gas phase, the gas pressure in the collision cell was increased to 4.0 × 105 Torr for ion cooling. For MS/MS analysis, data were acquired using the information-dependent acquisition feature in the Analyst QS software. TOF and tandem MS data were acquired over m/z ranges of 300-2200 and 65-2000, respectively. Every spectrum was accumulated for 1 s and was followed by three-product ion spectra (each for 3 s). The DP, DP2, FP settings were 50, 10, and 200, respectively, and the collision energy was dependent on the m/z values of the ions. For identification of the reaction product by electrospray ionization (ESI)-TOF MS, scaled-up reactions (5-ml volume, 1 mg of protein) were performed using standard assay conditions. Reactions were quenched by an addition of 5% (v/v) 5-sulfosalicyclic acid. After centrifugation, the supernatant was evaporated to dryness and dissolved in water. Enzymatically synthesized γ-glutamylcysteine was compared with an authentic standard (Sigma-Aldrich). Expression and Purification of AtGCL—The reported nucleotide sequence (15May M.J. Leaver C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10059-10063Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) was used to design oligonucleotides for amplifying AtGCL from an Arabidopsis library. Several clones were identical to each other but had a single base pair deletion (T1470) compared with the published sequence that shifts the reading frame at the C terminus. The sequence obtained was identical to other GenBank™ entries for AtGCL, including that from genome sequencing (NP_194041). The C-terminal amino acid sequence of our AtGCL clone was 70% identical to other plant GCL sequences, suggesting that this is the correct sequence. Because the N-terminal region of AtGCL encodes a chloroplast transit signal (10Schafer H.J. Haag-Kerwer A. Rausch T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), we generated a version of AtGCL (At-GCLΔ85) lacking the localization sequence based on comparison with the cytosolic GCL from Zea mays (28Gomez L.D. Vanacker H. Buchner P. Noctor G. Foyer C.H. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1662-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). AtGCL and AtGCLΔ85 were overexpressed and purified by Ni2+-affinity and size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1). SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified proteins showed that AtGCL and AtGCLΔ85 migrated with molecular masses of 58 and 50 kDa, respectively, corresponding to their predicted masses. Full-length AtGCL was primarily insoluble, but ∼1 mg of pure soluble protein was obtained from an 8-liter growth. Removal of the plastid target sequence improved protein solubility, as purification of AtGCLΔ85 yielded 5 mg of pure protein liter-1 of culture. AtGCL catalyzed the ligation of glutamate to cysteine in the presence of ATP with a specific activity of 120 nmol min-1 mg protein-1. AtGCLΔ85 catalyzed the same reaction with a similar specific activity. Because the removal of the localization sequence improved solubility without altering enzymatic activity, we used AtGCLΔ85 for subsequent analysis. Substitution of α-aminobutyrate for cysteine in these reactions resulted in 20-fold reductions in specific activity even when high concentrations (up to 100 mm) were used. Therefore, cysteine was employed as a substrate for all further enzyme assays. Kinetic Analysis and Identification of the Reaction Product—Steady-state kinetic parameters (kcat and Km) for glutamate, cysteine, and ATP were determined for AtGCLΔ85 (Table I). The kcat and Km values were comparable with those reported for GCL purified from tobacco cell suspensions (29Hell R. Bergmann L. Planta. 1990; 180: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The reaction rate of recombinant purified AtGCLΔ85 was 50-fold higher than the tobacco enzyme likely because of the greater purity of these samples.

A TOF-MS survey scan showed a major component of m/z = 251.0894. The mass matches that of authentic γ-glutamylcysteine (MW 251.0841). Fragmentation of the precursor ion generated two major product ions corresponding to γ-glutamylcysteine cleaved at the peptide bond. The data demonstrated that the purified AtGCL catalyzed the production of γ-glutamylcysteine and is a GCL, even though it displays a low sequence homology with the GCL from other species. Inhibition and Inactivation of AtGCL—Glutathione inhibits the activity of GCL from non-plant eukaryotes and bacteria (8Richman P.G. Meister A. J. Biol.

To determine whether similar inhibition occurs in plants, we examined the effect of increasing glutathione levels on AtGCLΔ85 (Fig. 3). Glutathione was determined to be a non-competitive inhibitor of GCL activity versus both glutamate (Ki = 0.72 ± 0.05 mm) and cysteine (Ki = 2.21 ± 0.14 mm). These values fall within the range of inhibition constants (0.1-8.2 mm) reported for other GCL (8Richman P.G. Meister A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1982; 257: 13704-13712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cystamine (35Lebo R.V. Kredich N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2615-2623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) inactivate GCL. GCL catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of buthionine sulfoximine to form a γ-glutamylphosphate intermediate that mimics the transition state bound at the active site (34Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13704-13712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cystamine is a thiol-specific inactivator of GCL that targets a cysteine within the active site (35Lebo R.V. Kredich N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2615-2623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the inactivation of AtGCL by these compounds (Fig. 4). Both molecules inactivated AtGCLΔ85 with pseudo-first order kinetics (Fig. 4, A and C). Inactivation by buthionine sulfoximine displayed a kinact = 0.024 min-1 (t½ = 28.7 min) and a Ki = 1.2 mm (Fig. 4B). Buthionine sulfoximine did not inactivate AtGCLΔ85 in the absence of ATP or MgCl2, confirming that inactivation requires phosphorylation of the inactivator. Inactivation by cystamine showed a kinact = 0.028 min-1 (t½ = 24.5 min) and a Ki = 11 mm (Fig. 4D). Overall, inactivation of AtGCL by both molecules occurs more slowly and with increased Ki values than inactivation of the bacterial, mammalian, or nematode enzymes (20Lueder D.V. Phillips M.A. J.

For example, E. coli GCL is inactivated by buthionine sulfoximine with kinact = 0.3 min-1 (t½ = 2.3 min) and Ki = 66 μm (21Kelly B.S. Antholine W.E. Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and inactivation of rat GCL is even more rapid with kinact = 3.7 min-1 (t½ = 11 s) and Ki < 100 μm (34Griffith O.W.

Kinetic Mechanism of AtGCL—To determine the kinetic mechanism of AtGCL, we obtained a complete matrix of kinetic data for the three substrates (25Brekken D.L. Phillips M.A. J. Biol.

In the early phase (3–12 h) of NFκB activation, UV light reduces inhibitor of NFκB (IκB) through an IκB kinase-independent, but polyubiquitin-dependent, pathway. However, the mechanism for the UV light-induced reduction of IκB and activation of NFκB is not known. In this report, we show that UV light down-regulates the total amount of IκB through decreasing IκB mRNA translation. Our data show that UV light inhibits translation of IκB in wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFS/S) and that this inhibition is prevented in MEFA/A cells in which the phosphorylation site, Ser-51 in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 α-subunit, is replaced with a non-phosphorylatable Ala (S51A). Our data also show that UV light-induced NFκB activation is delayed in MEFA/A cells and in an MCF-7 cell line that is stably transfected with a trans-dominant negative mutant protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK). These results suggest that UV light-induced eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 α-subunit phosphorylation translationally inhibits new IκB synthesis. Without a continuous supply of newly synthesized IκB, the existing IκB is degraded through a polyubiquitin-dependent proteasomal pathway leading to NFκB activation. Based upon our results, we propose a novel mechanism by which UV light regulates early phase NFκB activation by means of an ER-stress-induced translational inhibition pathway.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5170-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). One well established mechanism for NFκB activation is that, upon stimulation such as with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α or lipopolysaccharide treatment, an inhibitor of NFκB (IκB) kinase (IKK) is activated and phosphorylates IκBα at Ser-32 and Ser-36 (3Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar, 4Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated IκBα dissociates from the NFκB and is rapidly degraded through the polyubiquitin-dependent proteasomal pathway. The free NFκB then translocates to the nucleus and activates target genes (5Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A.

Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4055) Google Scholar). However this mechanism is not applicable to UV light-induced early phase (within 12 h) activation of NFκB (2Bender K. Gottlicher M. Whiteside S. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5170-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 9Raine D.A. Jeffrey I.W. Clemens M.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Compared with TNFα, UV light activates NFκB in a delayed and prolonged manner. The UV light-induced early phase activation of NFκB is dependent upon the degradation of IκB through the polyubiquitin-degradation pathway (9Raine D.A. Jeffrey I.W. Clemens M.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); however, the mechanism is not understood. It was reported that UV light does not induce IKK activation nor N-terminal serine phosphorylation of IκBα during this time (2Bender K. Gottlicher M. Whiteside S. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5170-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that IKK activity is required and that the IKK-targeted serine phosphorylation sites on IκBα are critical for UV light-induced NFκB activation, even though IKK activation is not detected above the basal level after UV light irradiation (10Huang T.T. Feinberg S.L. Suryanarayanan S. Miyamoto S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5813-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this report, we elucidate the role of translational regulation in early phase activation of NFκB after UV light irradiation. Previously, we reported that UV light irradiation activates an RNA-dependent protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress activated kinase (PERK) that phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 α (eIF2α) and inhibits protein synthesis (11Wu S. Hu Y. Wang J.L. Chatterjee M. Shi Y. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18077-18083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Now we show that UV light-induced early phase activation of NFκB is due to the translational inhibition of new IκB synthesis through the phosphorylation of Ser-51 in eIF2α. UV Light Irradiation—Ultraviolet C light was generated from a 15 W ultraviolet C light source (UVP Inc., Upland, CA). The intensity of ultraviolet C light was standardized by using a UV light meter (UVP Inc., Upland, CA) set at 3 W/m2. The media was withdrawn during the ultraviolet C irradiation. After UV light irradiation, fresh medium was added to each plate. Analysis of Total IκB—Cells were harvested with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (2% Nonidet P-40, 80 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, and 0.1% SDS), and the protein concentrations were measured with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with either an anti-IκB antibody or a mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma). Two anti-IκB antibodies were used in the experiments. A rabbit polyclonal anti-IκB antibody (sc-371; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was used for mouse IκB, and a mouse monoclonal anti-IκB antibody (sc-1643; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used for human IκB. After extensively washing with Tris-buffered saline plus Tween 20, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Signals were detected by using a SuperSignal™ chemiluminescent kit (Pierce). Assay for IκB Synthesis—The mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were UV light-irradiated (30 J/m2). At the indicated time points after irradiation (Fig. 1), the cells were incubated with methionine/cysteine-free minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) for 15 min and then pulselabeled with Redivue pro mix [35S]-Met/Cys (100 μCi/ml and 1,000 Ci/mmol, respectively; Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min in Met/Cys-free minimal essential medium (Invitrogen). After washing with PBS, cell extracts were prepared in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The protein concentration was measured with a Bio-Rad protein DC assay kit. IκB was then immunoprecipitated from equal amounts of proteins using anti-IκB antibody (sc-371, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A-agarose (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gel was treated with En3Hance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and dried. The newly synthesized IκB presence was then analyzed by autoradiography. Assay for Protein Synthesis—The UV light-irradiated MEFs were pulse-labeled with [35S]-Met/Cys as described above. The [35S]-incorporation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE or trichloroacetic acid precipitation. For electrophoresis, equal amounts of cell lysate were resolved on a SDS-12% PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 and treated with En3Hance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The gel was then dried for autoradiography. For trichloroacetic acid precipitation, equal amounts of cell lysate were added to 0.5 ml of 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin containing 0.02% sodium azide and placed on ice. An equal volume of ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid was added, subjected to a vigorous vortex, and incubated for 30 min on ice. The cell lysate was filtered through a Millipore filtration apparatus onto a glass microfiber disk (GF/C, Whatman, Clifton, NJ). Disks were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and twice with 1 ml of 100% ethanol. Disks were air-dried, and the radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter (Packard, Waltham, MA). Assay for eIF2α Phosphorylation—MEFs were UV light-irradiated and harvested in the Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing proteinase inhibitor mixture (Complete™, Roche Applied Science) at the indicated post-irradiation time points (Fig. 2). Equal amounts of proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, which was followed by Western blotting analysis with antibody against phosphorylated eIF2α (Research Genetics, Inc., Huntsville, AL) (12DeGracia D.J. Sullivan J.M. Neumar R.W. Alousi S.S. Hikade K.R. Pittman J.E. White B.C. Rafols J.A. Krause G.S. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1997; 17: 1291-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The levels of eIF2α phosphorylation were visualized by the SuperSignal™ chemiluminescent system (Pierce). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—A pair of 23-bp synthetic oligonucleotides (5′-GATCCAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAGA-3′) containing the NFκB-binding site was annealed and labeled with 32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [32P-γ]ATP. A DNA-binding reaction mixture of 20 μl contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4% Ficoll-400, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μg of poly(dI·dC), 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (20,000 cpm), and 8 μg of nuclear extract from MCF-7 cells or MEFs after UV light treatment. In the cases indicated, 0.2 μg of Rel A antibody or Rel B antibody and a 100-fold excess of mutated consensus-binding sequence (5′-GATCCAGACCATGGTATCCGAGA-3′) were also included. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 45 min and loaded onto a 5.3% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was run in 0.5 × TBE buffer (45 mm Tris-borate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8) at 120 V, dried, and autoradiographed. Immunofluorescence Staining—MCF-7 and MCF-7-PERKΔC cells were UV light-irradiated and then, at the indicated time points (Fig. 4), were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% saponin. The cells were incubated with a mouse anti-NFκB monoclonal antibody. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with a fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody. The localization of NFκB was visualized with an Olympus IX70 fluorescence microscope using a Kodak M290 camera with an exposure time of 0.25 s. UV Light Inhibits Translation of IκB through Phosphorylation of Ser-51 Residue of eIF2α—Because the half-life of IκB is short (2Bender K. Gottlicher M. Whiteside S. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5170-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), inhibition of new IκB synthesis can have a significant impact upon the total amount of intracellular IκB. Indeed, treating cells with a protein synthesis inhibitor such as cyclo-heximide can induce NFκB activation (13Newton R. Adcock I.M. Barnes P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 14Faggioli L. Costanzo C. Merola M. Furia A. Palmieri M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Because UV light irradiation inhibits protein synthesis through induction of eIF2α phosphorylation (11Wu S. Hu Y. Wang J.L. Chatterjee M. Shi Y. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18077-18083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we examined whether eIF2α phosphorylation plays a role in UV light-induced NFκB activation. MEFs with wild-type eIF2α (MEFS/S) or with an Ser-51 → Ala mutation at the phosphorylation site in eIF2α (MEFA/A) (15Scheuner D. Song B. McEwen E. Liu C. Laybutt R. Gillespie P. Saunders T. Bonner-Weir S. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1165-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar) were used in the experiments. We first measured the total amount of IκB in UV light-irradiated MEF cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated that UV light irradiation significantly reduced IκBinMEFS/S cells by 40–97% within 4–24 h (Fig. 1A, lanes 2–4), whereas IκB remained at a high level in MEFA/A cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 6–8). We then analyzed IκB translation in MEFS/S and MEFA/A cells. The cells were UV light-irradiated and then metabolically pulse-labeled for 30 min with [35S]-Met/Cys at the indicated time points (Fig. 1). The synthesis of IκB was monitored by autoradiography after immunoprecipitation with anti-IκB antibody. IκB synthesis was reduced by 70% in MEFS/S cells at 4 h post-UV light irradiation (Fig. 1B, lane 2), whereas IκB synthesis was almost undetectable at 8–24 h post-UV light irradiation (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, IκB synthesis in MEFA/A cells was maintained at 90–60% at 4–24 h post-UV light irradiation (see Fig. 3B, lanes 6–8). Our data show that in the early phase (4–8 h) post-UV light irradiation, the translation level of IκB correlated with the total amount of IκB in the cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–3 and 5-7 versus B, lanes 1–3 and 5-7). These data suggest that in the early phase after UV light irradiation, reduction of IκB in the cells is due to UV light-induced translational inhibition of IκB synthesis. We further analyzed protein synthesis levels and eIF2α phosphorylation in these cell lines after UV light treatment. Analysis of 35S-Met/Cys incorporation at 4 h after UV light irradiation (30 J/m2) demonstrated that protein synthesis was reduced to 56% in wild-type MEFS/S, but protein synthesis remained at 98% in homozygous S51A eIF2α mutant MEFA/A (Fig. 2, A and B). At 8–24 h post-UV light irradiation, expression of eIF2α (S51A) partially reversed UV light-induced translation inhibition (Fig. 2, A and B). The increased translational inhibition paralleled the increased level of eIF2α phosphorylation in MEFS/S cells (Fig. 2C, lanes 1–4). The UV light-induced eIF2α phosphorylation was not detected in MEFA/A cells (Fig. 2C, lanes 5–8). The increased eIF2α phosphorylation correlated with the reduction in IκB synthesis and level (Fig. 2CversusFig. 1, A and B). This result suggests that the reduction of IκB upon UV light irradiation is due to the phosphorylation of eIF2α and is translationally regulated. UV Light-induced NFκB Activation Requires Phosphorylation of eIF2α—To confirm that UV light induces early phase NFκB activation through a translational regulation pathway, we examined NFκB activation further in the MEFs using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). UV light treatment for 4–24 h increased the activation of NFκB in wild-type MEFs (Fig. 3A, lanes 2–4). In contrast, NFκB was not significantly activated in MEFA/A cells at 4 or 8 h (Fig. 3A, lanes 6 and 7). However, at 24 h post-UV light irradiation, there was an increase in the activation of the NFκB (Fig. 3A, lane 8). This delayed activation is consistent with a previous report showing that in the late stage of UV light irradiation, IKK is involved in UV light-induced activation of NFκB (2Bender K. Gottlicher M. Whiteside S. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5170-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To identify the subunit of NFκB that is activated after UV light irradiation, we performed a super-gel-shift assay using antibodies against Rel A (p65) and Rel B of NFκB family. Only anti-Rel A was able to produce a supershift of the DNA-protein complex (Fig. 3B; Ref. 16Brivanlou A.H. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 2002; 295: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), supporting the idea that UV light specifically activates Rel A. To further elucidate whether the translational inhibition mechanism is unique for UV light irradiation, we measured NFκB activation in the same cell lines after TNFα treatment. The results demonstrate that there is no difference in TNFα-induced activation of NFκB between MEFS/S and MEFA/A cells (Fig. 3C, lanes 1–6 versus 7-12). These results suggest that translational inhibition of IκB is critical for UV light-induced early phase activation of NFκB. PERK Mediates IκB Depletion in Response to UV Light— PERK is an ER-stress-induced eIF2α kinase (17Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2497) Google Scholar, 18Harding H.P. Novoa I.I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar) that mediates UV light-induced eIF2α phosphorylation and protein synthesis inhibition (11Wu S. Hu Y. Wang J.L. Chatterjee M. Shi Y. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18077-18083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We examined whether PERK mediates UV light-induced down-regulation of IκB by studying a parental control MCF-7 cell line and a line that stably expresses a trans-dominant negative mutant PERK (PERKΔC) mutant that has a carboxyl-terminal truncation (11Wu S. Hu Y. Wang J.L. Chatterjee M. Shi Y. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18077-18083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Where IκB was reduced 20–40% within 4–24 h post-UV light irradiation in parental MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4A, lanes 1–4), IκB was stable in MCF-7-PERKΔC cells, even at 24 h post-UV light irradiation (Fig. 4A, lanes 5–8). These results agree with our previous report that UV light-induced eIF2α phosphorylation and that translational inhibition is mediated by PERK (11Wu S. Hu Y. Wang J.L. Chatterjee M. Shi Y. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18077-18083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To confirm that PERK-mediated translational inhibition results in the activation of NFκB, we analyzed NFκB activation in MCF-7 and MCF-7-PERKΔC cells using an EMSA. NFκB activation was observed in MCF-7 cells at 8 h post-UV light irradiation and reached a high level at 24 h post-UV light irradiation (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4). These results are consistent with the findings on NFκB activation in the MEF cells (Fig. 3A, lane 4). The NFκB sequence-specificity in binding was confirmed by competition with unlabeled oligonucleotides containing wild-type or mutated NFκB consensus binding sequences (Fig. 4B, lanes 5 and 6). NFκB activation at 8 h and 24 h post-UV light irradiation was significantly lower in MCF-7-PERKΔC cells (Fig. 4B, lanes 9 and 10). To determine whether the deactivation of NFκB was due to the inhibition of NFκB translocation caused by the elevated IκB level in MCF-7-PERKΔC cells, we analyzed NFκB translocation in the cells. NFκB translocated into the nucleus at 9 h post-UV light irradiation in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4C, top row). However, this translocation was delayed in MCF-7-PERKΔC cells (Fig. 4C, bottom row). Cells respond to environmental stimuli through rapid and reversible covalent modification of translation initiation factors to mediate immediate increases or decreases in protein synthesis (19Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 20Kaufman R.J. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 503-528Google Scholar). Stress conditions that inhibit initiation of protein synthesis decrease the activity of eIF2 through phosphorylation of its α-subunit at Ser-51 (21Price N.T. Welsh G.I. Proud C.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Four protein kinases are known to phosphorylate Ser-51 in eIF2α in response to different stress stimuli as follows: (i) the dsRNA-activated protein kinase PKR that is activated by dsRNA produced during viral infection (20Kaufman R.J. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 503-528Google Scholar); (ii) the general control of nitrogen metabolism kinase GCN2 that responds to amino acid depletion (22Sood R. Porter A.C. Olsen D. Cavener D.R. Wek R.C. Genetics. 2000; 154: 787-801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); (iii) the heme-regulated inhibitor kinase that responds to heme deprivation (23Ranu R.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 91: 1437-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); and (iv) PERK that responds to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum as well as to glucose depletion (24Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar, 25Fernandez J.M. Bode B. Koromilas A. Diehl J.A. Krukovets I. Snider M.D. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11780-11787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that PERK and GCN2 can mediate translational inhibition through the phosphorylation of eIF2α in response to UV light irradiation (11Wu S. Hu Y. Wang J.L. Chatterjee M. Shi Y. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18077-18083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 26Deng J. Harding H.P. Raught B. Gingras A.C. Berlanga J.J. Scheuner D.

Chem. 2001; 276: 16944-16951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the roles of PERK and GCN2 in UV light-induced translation inhibition are a source of controversy. This may be because of the different cell lines, assay conditions, and times used in the experiments. We now demonstrate that UV light irradiation signals through PERK-mediated translational inhibition of IκB, depletion of IκB, and activation of NFκB upon UV light irradiation. The dependence of eIF2α phosphorylation upon IκB reduction was studied by using MEFS/S or MEFA/A (15Scheuner D. Song B. McEwen E. Liu C. Laybutt R. Gillespie P. Saunders T. Bonner-Weir S. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1165-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). Our results show that UV light irradiation reduced the total amount of IκB in the MEFS/S cells but not in the MEFA/A cells (Fig. 1A). The total amounts of IκB correlated with the rates of IκB translation in the cells (Fig. 1B). In addition, a reduced amount and a lower synthesis rate of IκB were observed in the MEFA/A cells (Fig. 1, A and B). This may be because of the lower background activity of NFκB in the MEFA/A cells (Fig. 3A), which regulates the expression of IκB (28Scott M.L. Fujita T. Liou H.C. Nolan G.P. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The requirement for PERK was studied in MCF-7 and MCF-7-PERKΔC cell lines (11Wu S. Hu Y. Wang J.L. Chatterjee M. Shi Y. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18077-18083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Our data show that NFκB was activated when IκB levels were reduced to ∼60% in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4, A and B). This result agrees with the results from the MEFS/S cells (Figs. 1 and 3). In MCF-7-PERKΔC cell lines, however, UV light-induced IκB reduction and NFκB activation were significantly inhibited (Fig. 4, A and B). These results suggest that PERK mediates UV light-induced IκB reduction and NFκB activation. Interestingly, whereas UV light-induced IκB reduction and NFκB activation correlated very well at all time points in both wild-type and mutant cell lines, they did not correlate in the late-phase (24 h) post-UV light irradiation in the mutant cell lines. In MEFA/A cells, NFκB activation was independent of IκB reduction at 24 h post-UV light irradiation (Figs. 1A and 3A). However, in MCF-7-PERKΔC, although the IκB level was high and NFκB was not activated at 24 h post-UV light irradiation, NFκB significantly translocated to the nucleus, in a manner similar to the parental cells (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that eIF2α phosphorylation and PERK activation may also play other roles in UV light-induced IκB degradation and NFκB activation. It will be interesting to identify the factors and signaling pathways that affect IκB degradation and NFκB activation in these mutated cell lines. In summary, our data show that UV light-induced early phase IκB degradation and NFκB activation can be prevented by the expression of a non-phosphorylatable eIF2α (S51A) mutant or a trans-dominant negative mutant PERK. Our data also show that UV light inhibits IκB translation, which can be reversed by expression of an eIF2α (S51A) mutant. Based on these results, we propose a novel mechanism for the UV light-induced early phase activation of NFκB (Fig. 5). We propose that UV light irradiation activates PERK, which phosphorylates eIF2α and inhibits new IκB synthesis. The existing IκB is depleted by natural degradation through the phosphorylation of Ser-32/Ser-36 by background IKK activity (10Huang T.T. Feinberg S.L. Suryanarayanan S. Miyamoto S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5813-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and the polyubiquitin-dependent proteasomal pathway. Depletion of IκB leads to NFκB activation. These studies have identified a novel mechanism by which translational control can regulate gene transcription. We thank Dr. Todd Parker for proofreading this manuscript."

The crystal structures of XIP-I in complex with Aspergillus nidulans (GH10) and Penicillium funiculosum (GH11) xylanases have been solved at 1.7 and 2.5 Å resolution, respectively.

The XIP-I strategy for inhibition of xylanases involves substrate-mimetic contacts and interactions occluding the active site.

The biological role of the xylanase inhibitors is discussed in light of the present structural data. The enzymatic hydrolysis of the plant cell wall, which comprises the most abundant source of organic carbon in the biosphere, releases organic carbon that is utilized as an energy and carbon source by a range of organisms. This degradative process is thus of fundamental biological and industrial importance. A significant component of the plant cell wall is the β-1,4-xylopyranose polysaccharide xylan, which is hydrolyzed by endo-β-1,4-xylanases (xylanases) that belong mainly to glycoside hydrolase families (GHs) 1The abbreviations used are: GH, glycoside hydrolase; TAXI, T. aestivum xylanase inhibitor; XIP, xylanase inhibitor protein; XLNC, A. nidulans xylanase; XYNA, P. simplicissimum xylanase; XYNC, P. funiculosum xylanase C. 10 and 11 (CAZY website, afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/(1Coutinho P.M.

Enzymes from both GH10 and GH11 cleave the glycosidic bond by acid-base assisted catalysis by using a double displacement mechanism in which the two catalytic glutamates function as the nucleophile and acid-base residues, respectively. Recently, two families of plant proteins, designated as XIP and TAXI, have been shown to inhibit xylanases (7Juge N. Payan F. Williamson G. Biochim. Biophys.

XIP-I from wheat (Triticum aestivum) is the prototype of a novel class of “chitinase-like” cereal inhibitors that apparently inhibits reversibly fungal but not bacterial GH10 and GH11 xylanases (9McLauchlan W.R.

Gebruers K. Haigh N.P. Fish N.M. Kroon P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1598: 24-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of XIP-I was recently determined to 1.8 Å resolution (12Payan F. Flatman R. Porciero S. Williamson G. Juge N. Roussel A. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The inhibitor has a (β/α)8 barrel fold and displays structural features typical of the glycoside hydrolase family 18. Although the catalytic glutamate of GH18 chitinases is conserved in XIP-I, structural differences in the region homologous to the active site of chitinases probably account for the lack of activity of XIP-I toward chitin (12Payan F. Flatman R. Porciero S. Williamson G. Juge N. Roussel A. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The inhibition of xylanases by XIP-I is competitive with a 1:1 stoichiometry and, depending on the xylanase, the Ki of the inhibition varies 200-fold (10Flatman R. McLauchlan W.R. Juge N. Furniss C. Berrin J.G. Hughes R.K. Manzanares P. Ladbury J.E. O'Brien R. Williamson G. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 773-781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). XIP-I does not show a preference for GH10 or GH11 xylanases because the two tightest-binding complexes were reported to be with the GH11 Penicillium funiculosum (Ki of 3.4 nm) and GH10 Aspergillus nidulans (Ki of 9 nm) xylanases (10Flatman R. McLauchlan W.R. Juge N. Furniss C. Berrin J.G. Hughes R.K. Manzanares P. Ladbury J.E. O'Brien R. Williamson G. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 773-781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of fungal xylanases is not due to the binding of XIP-I to glyco-decorations, because both the native and Escherichia coli-derived recombinant forms of P. funiculosum xylanase are inhibited to the same extent. Recent site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that XIP-I binds to the conserved “thumb” hairpin loop of GH11 xylanases (13Tahir T.A. Berrin J.G. Flatman R. Roussel A. Roepstorff P. Williamson G. Juge N. J. Biol.

Here we report the x-ray structure of XIP-I in complex with an A. nidulans GH10 and P. funiculosum GH11 xylanases. The structural data provide insights into the biological role of a novel protein. Furthermore, knowledge of the structural basis for xylanase recognition by XIP-I provides a template for engineering novel specificities into both xylanase inhibitors and xylanases that could increase the biotechnological applications of these proteins. Protein Expression and Purification—XIP-I was purified from wheat flour (T. aestivum var. soisson) as described previously (9McLauchlan W.R. Garcia-Conesa M.T. Williamson G. Roza M. Ravestein P.

Crystallization and Data Collection—XIP-I-XLNC complex crystals were obtained by vapor diffusion in hanging drops at 20 °C. The A. nidulans xylanase was incubated with the inhibitor in a molar ratio prior to crystallization. The hanging drops consisted of 1 μl of the protein solution (4.2 mg/ml) together with 1 μl of the reservoir solution composed of 10% PEG 8000, 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5, and 20% ethylene glycol. Crystals, grown for 3–10 days (to a maximum size of 0.15 × 0.15 × 0.5 mm), belonged to the P212121 space group (a = 46.7 Å, b = 75.8 Å and c = 159.6 Å) and diffracted to 1.7 Å resolution. Ethylene glycol was added up to a concentration of 30% to act as the cryoprotectant in the subsequent data collection step. A similar procedure was followed to obtain XIP-I-XYNC complex crystal. The P. funiculosum xylanase and the inhibitor were mixed together in a 1:1 ratio. The hanging drops consisted of 1 μl of the protein solution (3.5 mg/ml) together with 1 μl of the reservoir solution composed of 34% PEG 4000, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, and 1.5% 1,2,3-heptanetriol. Suitable crystals for data collection were obtained within 3 weeks. The complex crystallized in the space group P43212 (a = b = 98.7 Å and c = 109.8 Å). X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K on an ADSC Q4 CCD detector using synchrotron radiation at ID14-EH1 beamline in European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) for XIP-I-XLNC crystal and on a MarCCD detector using synchrotron radiation at X06 SA beamline in Swiss Light Source (Villigen, Switzerland) for XIP-I-XYNC crystal. Data processing was performed using the DENZO and SCALEPACK programs (16Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). Data collection statistics are given in supplemental Table I. Structure Determination—The structure of XIP-I-XLNC complex was solved by molecular replacement using the AMoRe program (17Navaza J.

A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar) with XIP-I (Protein Data Bank code 1OMO) and Penicillium simplicissimum xylanase (Protein Data Bank code 1BG4) as the search models. The rotation and translation functions gave a unique solution. Before fitting, the correlation coefficient and R-factor were 52.6 and 39.3%, respectively, which refined to 60.9 and 36.2%, respectively. CNS (18Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L.

After performing several cycles of refinement and manual replacement and building on the graphic display with the TURBO-FRODO program (20Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991: 86Google Scholar), the R-factor has decreased to 13.3% (R-free 16.5%). The molecular replacement method using the AMoRe program (17Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar) was also used to solve the structure of the XIP-I-XYNC complex. The search model for the enzyme was the structure of Aspergillus niger xylanase (Protein Data Bank code 1UKR). The rotation function yielded one solution for the inhibitor but no peak above background for the enzyme. The phased translation function with the known position of XIP-I gave a solution, with a correlation coefficient and an R-factor of 41.9 and 46.3%, respectively, for data between 15 and 4 Å. After rigid body refinement, the correlation coefficient was 52.4% with an R-factor of 41.8%. The refinement was performed using the TLS option in the program REFMAC (19Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

After performing several cycles of refinement and manual replacement and building, the R-factor decreased to 25.2% (R-free 28.9%) for a resolution between 20 and 2.5 Å. Coordinates—The atomic coordinates and structure factors for the XIP-I A. nidulans xylanase and XIP-I P. funiculosum xylanase complexes have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession codes 1TA3 and 1TE1 for XIP-I-XLNC and XIP-I-XYNC, respectively). Structural Alignments—A first superposition of each molecule on the structure of A. nidulans and P. funiculosum (for GH10 and GH11, respectively) was performed by using the three C-α atoms of amino acids found in the active site. The superimposition was then refined by using all the C-α pairs that were distant by less than a given cut-off distance. In our strategy, the initial cut-off was 1 Å and 0.5 Å in a second step. The quality of the superposition can be assessed by the number of C-α atoms that are involved in the last calculation step. Structure of A. nidulans Xylanase (XLNC)—The A. nidulans xylanase displays the typical (β/α)8 TIM-barrel fold of GH10 xylanases (Fig. 1A). The molecule displays a “salad bowl” shape with an elliptical cross-section at the C-terminal side of the barrel with a maximum shorter and longer axis of 40 and 53 Å, respectively. The three-dimensional structure of XLNC is similar to that of P. simplicissimum xylanase XYNA. The architecture of the cleft that runs across the barrel top is characteristic of GH10 xylan-binding sites with the two conserved catalytic residues, Glu-131XLNC and Glu-239XLNC (acid-base catalyst and nucleophile, respectively), facing each other on opposite sides approximately halfway through its length. The major main chain difference between these two enzymes occurs in the loop connecting strand β6 to helix α6 which constitutes the surface edge at the distal aglycone region of the substrate binding cleft. In this loop, the segment following the conserved residue His-209XLNC is longer in XLNC, resulting in a significant structural rearrangement at the extremity of the groove. A xylopentaose moiety can easily be modeled into the cleft of XLNC on the basis of the x-ray structure of the P. simplicissimum xylanase bound with xylooligosaccharides (Protein Data Bank code 1B3Z) (21Schmidt A. Gubitz G.M. Kratky C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2403-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Structure of P. funiculosum Xylanase (XYNC)—The P. funiculosum xylanase conforms to the β-jelly roll fold of other GH11 xylanases (Fig. 1B). The conformation of GH11 xylanases has been compared with the shape of a right hand with the “fingers” at the top, the “palm” at the bottom, and the thumb at the right-hand side of the molecule (22Torronen A. Harkki A. Rouvinen J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2493-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The final model of the enzyme contains 1 α-helix and 14 β-strands forming 2 curved β-sheets, A and B (Fig. 1B). The curved β-sheet B, the “cord” and the thumb form the cylindrical active site, which is lined with many aromatic amino acid residues. Although the main architecture is conserved, XYNC shows several differences with well characterized xylanases from A. niger, Bacillus agaradherens, and Bacillus circulans (23Krengel U. Dijkstra B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 24Sidhu G. Withers S.G. Nguyen N.T. McIntosh L.P. Ziser L. Brayer G.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5346-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 25Sabini E. Wilson K.S. Danielsen S. Schulein M. Davies G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1344-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In particular, changes are observed in the conformation of the thumb and in the shape of the loop linking strands A2 and B2 of the palm, two regions involved in the interaction with XIP-I (see below). The structural elements of the substrate-binding cleft are similar to other GH11 xylanases, and the catalytic residues, Glu-86XYNC and Glu-177XYNC, are invariant. The dimensions of the substrate binding cleft indicates that the enzyme contains three glycone (-3 to -1) and two aglycone (+1 to +2) subsites. Interaction with GH10 Xylanase—The structure of the complex between XIP-I and XLNC revealed extensive interactions between the two proteins, resulting in the burial of 1130 Å2 of accessible surface area. The two elliptical TIM barrel scaffolds interact such that the major axes of XIP-I and XLNC are perpendicular (Fig. 1A). XIP-I α7 helix (232–245) interacts with the loops forming the xylanase groove through enzyme residues 46–47 (loop β2-α2), 87–90 (loop β3-α3), 131–146 (loop β4-α4), and 269–281 (loop β8-α8) (Fig. 2A; supplemental Table II). Helix α7 covers the central part of the XLNC substrate binding cleft from subsites -3 to +2, resulting in the occlusion of the active site of the enzyme. Side chains emerging from the helix point into the heart of the cleft and occupy the four central subsites: -1 (Lys-234XIP-I), +1 (Asn-235XIP-I), +2 (His-232XIP-I), and -2 (Tyr-238XIP-I), whereas Lys-246XIP-I sterically blocks access to subsite -3. Lys-234XIP-I makes a direct hydrogen bond with the acid-base catalyst Glu-131XLNC and water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the nucleophile Glu-239XLNC. In the complex, the heart of the substrate binding site is occupied by an aromatic cluster of residues from the inhibitor (Tyr-237XIP-I, Tyr-238XIP-I, His-232XIP-I, Trp-230XIP-I, and Tyr-273XIP-I) and the enzyme (Trp-269XLNC, His-209XLNC, Trp-277XLNC, Tyr-174XLNC, and Arg-278XLNC). In the structure of XYNA in complex with xylopentaose (Protein Data Bank code 1B3Z), Trp-276XYNA forms a “lid” over the active site and stacks with the xylose ring bound at subsite -1 (21Schmidt A. Gubitz G.M. Kratky C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2403-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the XIP-I-XLNC complex, the corresponding residue (Trp-277XLNC) is displaced upon inhibitor binding by the helical inhibitory head, confirming the flexibility of the tryptophan “above” the -1 subsite (5Sabini E. Sulzenbacher G. Dauter M. Dauter Z. Jorgensen P.L. Schulein M. Dupont C. Davies G.J. Wilson K.S. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 483-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The movement of Trp-277XLNC is accompanied by a rearrangement of the adjacent Arg-278XLNC; both residues are very well defined in the electron density. Within the “product release area” (subsites +1 to +2) of the xylanase cleft, a tyrosine side chain (Tyr-175XYNA) stacks against the xylobiose entity bound to subsites +1 through +2 (21Schmidt A. Gubitz G.M. Kratky C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2403-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); in the XIP-I-XLNC complex, the corresponding tyrosine residue (Tyr-174XLNC) interacts with the side chain of His-232XIP-I occupying subsite +2, mimicking substrate enzyme recognition at the +2 subsite. Interaction with GH11 Xylanase—In the XIP-I-XYNC complex, there are extensive interactions between the two proteins, with a contact surface area of 870 Å2. A Π-shaped long loop from XIP-I protrudes between the thumb and the palm of the enzyme (Fig. 1B), blocking access to the active site; this interaction is associated with tight interaction with the thumb and the facing palm regions including segments from the strands of the curved β-sheet B and the loop A2B2 (Fig. 2B). The primary contact region in XIP-I involves residues 148–154 from the Π-shaped Lα4β5 loop and interacts with residues from the enzyme active center (region 1), the thumb (region 2), and the palm of the enzyme (region 3) (supplemental Table III). The loop is sited in the mouth of the active site cylinder, blocking access to the three glycone subsites. The top of the inhibitor loop is slightly twisted, allowing the 150–152 (Gly-Gly-Pro) segment to extend closely parallel to the -3 subsite plane, whereas the main chain segment 149–150 occupies subsite -2 (Fig. 2B). The carbonyl main chain of Gly-150XIP-I interacts with Ser-16XYNC, a residue that is predicted to interact with sugar units bound to the glycone subsites (24Sidhu G. Withers S.G. Nguyen N.T. McIntosh L.P. Ziser L. Brayer G.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5346-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 25Sabini E. Wilson K.S. Danielsen S. Schulein M. Davies G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1344-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The planar side chain of Arg-149XIP-I emerging from the left edge of the loop, in turn, extends into the -2 and -1 subsites; its hydrophobic part stacks against Trp-18XYNC, a residue highly conserved throughout GH11 (mimicking stacking of the substrate xylose ring located at the -2 subsite) (5Sabini E.

The guanidinium group of Arg-149XIP-I, which points into the crucial subsite -1, hydrogen-bonds with the catalytic acid-base Glu-176XYNC and Tyr-87XYNC. Most interesting, an arginine residue in the microbial inhibitor tendamistat forms a salt bridge to the acidbase catalyst of the porcine pancreatic α-amylase, resulting in the inactivation of the glycoside hydrolase (26Wiegand G. Epp O. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), a feature which might recurs in other glycosidase-inhibitor complexes. In the present structure, the NH2 atom of Arg-149XIP-I is in the equivalent position to the activated solvent molecule that acts as the nucleophile in the hydrolysis of the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate in the B. circulans xylanase (24Sidhu G. Withers S.G. Nguyen N.T. McIntosh L.P. Ziser L. Brayer G.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5346-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and it establishes an analogous hydrogen-bonding pattern with the catalytic acidbase and adjacent Tyr-87XYNC. The same characteristic feature was observed in the inhibition of pancreatic α-amylase by the proteinaceous bean inhibitor from Phaseolus vulgaris where the hydroxyl group of Tyr-37inhibitor makes a strong hydrogen bond to the acid-base catalyst, replacing the intervening water molecule (27Bompard-Gilles C. Rousseau P. Rouge P. Payan F. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 1441-1452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition to the enzyme active site cleft (region 1), neighboring regions are in tight contact with XIP-I (Fig. 2B), which includes an interaction between the thumb of XYNC (region 2) and three regions of XIP-I: the inhibitory loop and loops α5β6 and α6β7. This is consistent with site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrating that the equivalent residue to Asn-123XYNC in the A. niger xylanase thumb plays a key role in the interaction with XIP-I (13Tahir T.A. Berrin J.G. Flatman R. Roussel A. Roepstorff P. Williamson G. Juge N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44035-44043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The final enzyme region (region 3) consists of segments from strands B1, B2, and B3 facing the Π-shaped inhibitor loop (residues 5–7, 16–20, and 44) and the loop B2A2 (residues 21–23) and its neighboring region (residues 41–43), which interact with the C-terminal extremity of XIP-I helix α2. These protein complexes show that GH10 and GH11 xylanases interact with distinct regions of XIP-I, allowing a possible simultaneous binding of the inhibitor to both target enzymes (Fig. 3). Kinetic studies have established that XIP-I is a strong inhibitor of fungal GH10 and GH11 xylanases but does not inhibit any of the bacterial xylanases tested (10Flatman R. McLauchlan W.R. Juge N. Furniss C. Berrin J.G. Hughes R.K. Manzanares P. Ladbury J.E. O'Brien R. Williamson G. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 773-781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resolution of the three-dimensional structures of the xylanase-inhibitor complexes has identified the major structure features of these enzymes that are recognized by XIP-I. These data can be used to predict which bacterial and fungal xylanases will be inhibited by XIP-I. The validation of this prediction strategy is outlined below. Specificity for GH10 Xylanases—The interaction of GH10 A. nidulans xylanase with XIP-I occurs through loops β2-α2 (residues 46–47), β3-α3 (residues 87–90), β4-α4 (residues 131–146), and β8-α8 (residues 269–281), located around the enzyme active site. The crystal structures of two fungal and six bacterial GH10 xylanases have been reported. Comparison of the fungal structures with XLNC in complex with XIP-I does not reveal any significant structural differences in the loop regions located around the active site and the regions corresponding to the interface with the inhibitor. In sharp contrast, the structures of the bacterial xylanases revealed insertions in the β/α-loop segments at the carboxyl side of the β-barrel, which interact with XIP-I in XLNC. The location of these insertions varies with the xylanase (Fig. 4A). Among the bacterial xylanases of known three-dimensional structures, only Xyn10A from Pseudomonas fluorescens (Cellvibrio japonicus) (1CLX) was tested against XIP-I and was shown not to be inhibited (10Flatman R. McLauchlan W.R. Juge N. Furniss C. Berrin J.G. Hughes R.K. Manzanares P. Ladbury J.E. O'Brien R. Williamson G. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 773-781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of inhibition of this xylanase is explained by the insertions in loops β4-α4 (residues 134–138) and β8-α8 (residues 269–281) of the enzyme, which would prevent binding of XIP-I by steric hindrance. A similar insertion in Cellulomonas fimi (Protein Data Bank code 1EXP) and Clostridium thermocellum (Protein Data Bank code 1XYZ) xylanases would also predict a lack of inhibition for these enzymes. This hypothesis is in agreement with the findings that all the fungal GH10 xylanases evaluated were inhibited by XIP-I, apart from that of Aspergillus aculeatus (10Flatman R. McLauchlan W.R. Juge N. Furniss C. Berrin J.G. Hughes R.K. Manzanares P. Ladbury J.E. O'Brien R. Williamson G. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 773-781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of inhibition of this fungal enzyme is consistent with two large insertions after β-strands 7 and 8, as observed in the C. fimi and C. thermocellum xylanases. However, such structural differences are less obvious for other bacterial xylanases of known three-dimensional structure such as those from Streptomyces lividans (Protein Data Bank code 1EOV) and Streptomyces olivaceoviridis (Protein Data Bank code 1ISV). A search for interface-forming residues significantly different from the A. nidulans xylanase highlighted a stretch of amino acids around position 280 (loop β8/α8) of the S. lividans enzyme in which two residues positioned at the interface (Ser and Asp in A. nidulans xylanase) are replaced by amino acids with longer side chains (Glu and Gln) that are likely to make steric clashes with XIP-I. This sequence difference is absent from the corresponding region of the S. olivaceovirdis xylanase, suggesting that this prokaryotic xylanase could be inhibited by the wheat protein and thus questions whether XIP-I binds exclusively to fungal xylanases. Phylogenetic analyses have shown that GH10 xylanases can be further divided into two clusters; one containing fungal enzymes only and the other including enzymes from both bacteria and fungi (28Sato Y. Niimura Y. Yura K. Go M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The sequences of the fungal xylanases from Agaricus bisporus, Humicola grisea, and Filobasidium floriforme are closely related to the bacterial xylanase from C. fimi and show a 5-amino acid insertion in the β8-"

Mice with a targeted disruption of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) isoform are protected against diet and leptin deficiency-induced adiposity, have increased energy expenditure, and have up-regulated expression of hepatic genes encoding enzymes of fatty acid β-oxidation. Because peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) is a key transcription factor that induces the transcription of fatty acid β-oxidation and thermogenic genes, we hypothesized that the increased fatty acid oxidation observed in SCD1 deficiency is dependent on activation of the PPARα pathway. Here we show that mice nullizygous for SCD1 and PPARα are still protected against adiposity, have increased energy expenditure, and maintain high expression of PPARα target genes in the liver and brown adipose tissue. The SCD1 deficiency rescued hepatic steatosis of the PPARα-/- mice. The SCD1 mutation increased the phosphorylation of both AMP-activated protein kinase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, thereby increasing CPT activity and stimulating the oxidation of liver palmitoyl-CoA in the PPARα null mice. The findings indicate that the reduced adiposity, reduced liver steatosis, increased energy expenditure, and increased expression of PPARα target genes associated with SCD1 deficiency are independent of activation of the PPARα pathway.

Using adipose tissue-specific PPARδ-transgenic mice, it was demonstrated that PPARδ activation in adipose tissue leads to enhanced fatty acid oxidation, improved lipid profiles, reduced adiposity, and resistance to both diet-induced obesity and genetically predisposed obesity (28Wang Y.X.

Additionally, the disruption of PPARγ in the liver has been shown to improve the fatty liver phenotype of leptin-null mice, suggesting that PPARγ can also regulate lipid metabolism in the liver in addition to its known role in adipogenesis (26Matsusue K. Haluzik M. Lambert G. Yim S.H. Gavrilova O. Ward J.M. Brewer Jr., B. Reitman M.L. Gonzalez F.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). One of the physiological stimuli of PPARα is the fasting state, and it is hypothesized that the free fatty acids that are delivered from adipose tissue to the liver act as ligands and activate the receptor (30Kersten S. Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). The fatty acids are also oxidized in conjunction with increased synthesis of ketone bodies. Several in vivo studies have also shown that synthetic PPARα ligands such as fibrates markedly induce the transcription of hepatic β-oxidation genes and BAT-thermogenic genes including UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3, (31Barbera M.J.

Despite the great expansion of our understanding of the function of PPARα, it remains unclear when and how the PPAR signaling pathways are triggered in an intact organism and how they specifically affect lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Recently, we presented evidence that SCD1 deficiency protects mice against diet and leptin deficiency-induced adiposity, reduces hepatic triglyceride concentration, and induces the expression of PPARα target genes in the liver. We hypothesized that the elimination of the SCD1 gene in mice generates a signal (e.g. a fatty acid or fatty acid derivative) that activates the PPARα pathway, because fatty acids are known to activate PPARs (40Keller H. Dreyer C. Medin J. Mahfoudi A. Ozato K. Wahli W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2160-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 41Kliewer S.A. Sundseth S.S. Jones S.A. Brown P.J.

Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we generated mice that are deficient in both SCD1 and PPARα (SCD1-/-/PPARα-/-). These mice would be expected to show reduced expression of PPARα target genes and reduced energy expenditure as well as accumulation of hepatic triglyceride. We report here that the expression of PPARα target genes in the liver and brown adipose tissue remain elevated in the SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice. The reduced adiposity and increased energy expenditure due to SCD1 deficiency were not ameliorated. The SCD deficiency rescued hepatic steatosis of the PPARα-/- mice. The rate of fatty acid oxidation and activity of CPT-1 as well as the phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC were higher in the SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice relative to PPARα null controls. The levels of malonyl-CoA were lower in the SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the increased fatty acid β-oxidation and reduced adiposity due to SCD1 deficiency are independent of the PPARα pathway. The generation of the SCD1-/- mice in 129S6/SvEv background and PPARα-/- mice in 129/Sv Jae was described previously (19Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L.

Nutr. 2001; 131: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). To obtain PPARα-/- on a background of SCD1 deficiency, SCD1-/- mice were crossed with PPARα-/- mice and the F1 progeny of these matings (SCD1+/-/PPARα+/-) were then crossed to obtain mice that had both mutations of PPARα and SCD alleles (SCD1-/-/PPARα-/-). Animals were housed individually in a pathogen-free facility operating at room temperature in 12-h light/dark cycles. All of the animals were allowed free access to water and were fed ad libitum except during food restriction procedures. Animals were fed a high fat diet (21 w/w % fat, Harlan Takelad Madison, WI) at 8 weeks of age. Food consumption was monitored daily, and body weight was recorded every week. Animals were sacrificed when 16-weeks-old. All of the studies were approved by the animal care research committee of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Materials—Radioactive [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Dupont (Wilmington, DE). Thin-layer chromatography plates (TLC Silica Gel G60) were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). l-[3H]Carnitine and [14C]palmitoyl-CoA were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Anti-phospho-ACC antibody was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Waltham, MA). Anti-ACC1, ACC2, and CPT-1 antibodies were from Alpha Diagnostic International (San Antonio, TX). Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Fisher Scientific. Isolation and Analysis of RNA—Total RNA was extracted from the livers of SCD1-/-, PPARα-/-, and SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice as well as the appropriate wild-type controls using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). For Northern blot analysis, fifteen micrograms of total RNA were separated by 1.0% agarose/2.2 m formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a nylon membrane. The membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes for AOX, VLCAD, CPT-1 UCP-1, UCP-2, and UCP-3 as previously described (9Ntambi J.M. Miyazaki M. Stoehr J.P. Lan H. Kendziorski C.M.

The UCP-1 probe was kindly provided by Dr. Ezaki (National Institute of Health and Nutrition, Tokyo, Japan). Preparation of Mitochondria and Measurement of Mitochondrial Fatty Acid Oxidation—Mitochondria were isolated essentially as described by Vance (46Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mixture used to measure mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation contained in a final volume of 2.5 ml: 2 ml of modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm [14C]palmitoyl-CoA bound to 7.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4 mm ATP, 0.5 mm l-carnitine, 0.05 mm coenzyme A, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 ml of suspended mitochondria (5 mg of protein/ml). Palmitoyl-CoA oxidation was determined in the presence and absence of 2 mm KCN, and the cyanide-sensitive part of the oxidation was taken as mitochondrial oxidation (47Mannaerts G.P. Debeer L.J. Thomas J. De Schepper P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4585-4595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Labeled CO2 was trapped in 10 m KOH. An aliquot of the neutralized extracts was analyzed for the [14C] content of the ketone bodies (48Mannaerts G.P. Thomas J. Debeer L.J. McGarry J.D. Foster D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 529: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and another aliquot was adjusted to pH 4 with 3 m acetate buffer and extracted twice with petroleum ether to remove traces of [14C]palmitoyl-CoA and the aqueous phase was then counted (acid-soluble labeled oxidation products) (48Mannaerts G.P. Thomas J. Debeer L.J. McGarry J.D. Foster D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 529: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Measurement of CPT-1 Activity—The livers from wild-type, SCD1-/-, PPARα-/-, SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice were snap-frozen. CPT-1 activity was assayed in isolated mitochondria as described by Bremer (49Bremer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 665: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblot analyses of phosphorylated AMPK and ACC as well as protein levels of α1 and α2 AMPK and ACC1 and ACC2 were carried out as described previously (50Dobrzyn P. Dobrzyn A. Miyazaki M. Cohen P. Asilmaz E. Hardie F.G. Friedman J.M. Ntambi J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6409-6414Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Blood and Tissue Sampling—Mice were fasted for 16 h and sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation and/or cervical dislocation. Blood was collected aseptically by direct cardiac puncture and centrifuged (13,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) to collect plasma. Plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels were measured by using commercial kits (Roche Applied Science). Plasma free fatty acids and liver triglycerides were measured by gasliquid chromatography as previously described (51Miyazaki M. Kim H.J. Man W.C. Ntambi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39455-39461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) Plasma glucose concentrations were measured by using commercial kits (Sigma). Liver malonyl-CoA levels were measured as described previously (52King M.T. Reiss P.D. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Retroperitoneal, reproductive, mesenteric, and subcutaneous fat pads were used to determine total fat pad content. Histology was performed on livers, and white adipose tissue was fixed in 10% formalin and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. SCD1 Mutation Protected PPARα-/-Mice against Adiposity— Although the growth curves of PPARα-/- and SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice were similar to those of WT and SCD1-/- mice (Fig. 1A), the SCD1 mutation significantly decreased white adipose tissue mass of male (Fig. 1B) and female (Fig. 1C) PPARα-/- and wild-type mice. On average, food intake was significantly greater in male SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice than in PPARα-/- mice (0.17 ± 0.01 versus 0.11 ± 0.01 g/g body weight/day; n = 7 p < 0.001) (Fig. 1D). To determine whether the SCD1 mutation increases energy expenditure in the PPARα-/- mice, we compared the weight loss of wild-type, SCD1-/-, PPARα-/-, and SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice after a 16-h fast. Because energy intake is eliminated, the weight loss under fasting conditions provides a simple observation of energy expenditure (53Chen H.C. Ladha Z. Smith S.J. Farese Jr., R.V. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: E213-E218Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Fig. 1E shows that fasting-induced weight loss was higher in SCD1-/- and SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice than in the wild-type and PPARα-/- mice. These results suggest that decreased adiposity and increased energy expenditure in the SCD1-/- mice are independent of PPARα activation. SCD1 Mutation Reduced Hepatic and Plasma Triglyceride in PPARα-/-Mice—Fig. 2A shows that under fed and fasting conditions, the contents of liver triglycerides in SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- were 30 and 46% less, respectively, relative to those of the PPARα-/- mice. The fasting plasma triglyceride (Fig. 2B) and cholesterol (Fig. 2C) concentrations were significantly lower in SCD1-/- and SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice than in wild-type and PPARα-/- mice. Plasma free fatty acid levels were lower in SCD1-/- and SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- relative to wild-type and PPARα-/- mice (Fig. 2D). Plasma cholesterol and free fatty acid concentrations were higher in PPARα-/- mice than in wild-type mice, consistent with previous reports (30Kersten S. Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar, 43Akiyama T.E. Nicol C.J. Fievet C. Staels B. Ward J.M. Auwerx J. Lee S.S. Gonzalez F.J. Peters J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39088-39093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). SCD1 Mutation Protected PPARα-/-Mice against Diet-induced Obesity and Adiposity—A high fat diet caused weight gain in wild-type and PPARα-/- mice, whereas the body weights of SCD1-/- and SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice were not significantly altered (Fig. 3A). Food intake was significantly greater in male SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice than in PPARα-/- mice (0.20 ± 0.01 g versus 0.11 ± 0.01 g/g body weight/day; n = 6 p < 0.001). The weights of reproductive fat pads of the female and male PPARα-/- mice were 60 and 20% higher, respectively, relative to the wild-type mice, but the fat pad weights of the SCD1-/- and SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice were 68 and 66% less, respectively, than those of PPARα-/- mice (Fig. 3C). His-tological examination of the epidydimal fat pads revealed smaller adipocytes in both SCD1-/- and SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- than in those of wild-type and PPARα-/- mice (Fig. 3D). These observations suggest that the protection against adiposity and diet-induced obesity by SCD1 deficiency is not controlled by PPARα. SCD1 Mutation Rescues Liver Steatosis of PPARα-/-Mice— Histological liver sections of male PPARα-/- mice fed a high fat diet showed large lipid-filled vacuoles, whereas those of SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice showed little or no vacuoles and were similar to those of SCD1-/- mice (Fig. 4A). The liver steatosis of the female PPARα-/- mice was reduced in the SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- (Fig. 4B). Fig. 4C shows that the liver triglyceride content was 50% higher in the male PPARα-/- mice relative to the wild-type mice upon feeding a high fat diet but reduced by greater than 80% in the SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice. The triglyc- eride content was reduced by 65% in the female SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- relative to the PPARα-/- mice. BAT sections of male PPARα-/- mice fed the high fat diet showed large lipid-filled vacuoles, whereas those of SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice showed small vacuoles and were similar to those of SCD1-/- mice (Fig. 4D). Fig. 4E shows that BAT triglyceride content was reduced by greater than 60% in the SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- relative to the PPARα-/- mice. These observations suggest that the protection against liver steatosis and reduction in triglyceride content in BAT caused by SCD1 deficiency is independent of PPARα activation. SCD1 Mutation Increases Expression of PPARα Target Genes in Liver and BAT of PPARα-/-Mice—To investigate whether the SCD1 mutation increased the expression of PPARα target genes in PPARα-/- mice, we measured the mRNA levels of AOX, VLCAD, and liver CPT in the livers and BAT and also BAT-thermogenic genes (UCP-1, UCP2, and UCP3) of wild-type, SCD1-/-, PPARα-/-, and SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice. Fig. 5A shows that the mRNA levels for AOX, liver CPT, and VLCAD were still elevated in the livers of SCD1-/-/PPARα-/-, and Fig. 5B shows that the mRNA levels for AOX, muscle CPT, UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3 remained higher in the BAT of SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- relative to the PPARα-/- mice. The expression of the PPARα mRNA in liver was not altered between the wild-type and SCD1-/- mice. These results suggest that the increased expression of PPARα target genes due to SCD1 deficiency occurs through a PPARα-independent process. SCD1 Mutation Increases Fatty Acid Oxidation in PPARα-/-Mice—To determine whether the SCD1 mutation increases the rate of fatty acid β-oxidation in PPARα-/- mice, we assayed the oxidation of [14-C]palmitoyl-CoA in liver mitochondria isolated from PPARα-/- and SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice. The oxidation of [14-C]palmitoyl-CoA was 54% higher (n = 5 mice/group, p < 0.05) in the liver (Fig. 6A) of SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice compared with PPARα-/- mice. Oxidation of [14-C]palmitoyl-CoA was also increased in the BAT of SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice relative to PPARα-/- mice (data not shown). CPT-1 is the enzyme that is responsible for the transport of activated fatty acid into mitochondria for β-oxidation, and its activity would be expected to increase during increased fatty acid oxidation. Fig. 6B shows that the CPT-1 protein level and enzyme activity are 35 and 60% higher, respectively, in the liver of SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice than in the liver of PPARα-/- mice (n = 6 mice/group, p < 0.001). The increase in CPT-1 protein level is consistent with the increase in CPT-1 mRNA shown in Fig. 5A. The increase in CPT-1 activity could be attributed to a decrease in malonyl-CoA, the substrate for lipogenesis, and inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation. The content of malonyl-CoA is 35% less (n = 6 mice/group, p < 0.001) in the SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- than in the PPARα-/- mice (Fig. 6C). Malonyl-CoA levels were also reduced in the BAT of SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice (data not shown). Because malonyl-CoA production can be blocked by serine 79 phosphorylation of ACC (50Dobrzyn P. Dobrzyn A. Miyazaki M. Cohen P. Asilmaz E. Hardie F.G. Friedman J.M. Ntambi J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6409-6414Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 54Kerner J. Hoppel C. Biochim.

Trans. 2003; 31: 196-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we measured phospho-ACC (α plus β) in the livers of PPARα-/- and SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice. The level of Ser-79 phosphorylation of ACC was 75% higher in the SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice relative to the PPARα-/- mice (Fig. 6D), whereas the total amount of ACC1 and ACC2 protein was decreased by 60 and 50%, respectively, in SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice. Because ACC Ser-79 phosphorylation is catalyzed by AMPK, which is activated by phosphorylation (56Minokoshi Y. Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Fryer L.G. Muller C. Carling D. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2002; 415: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar, 57Minokoshi Y. Kahn B.B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 196-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 58Hardie D.G. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19509-19515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we also measured phospho-AMPK. The amount of phosphorylated AMPK was 50% higher in the liver of SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice relative to the PPARα-/- mice, whereas the total amounts of α1-AMPK and α2-AMPK were not significantly changed. These results confirm that the increased fatty acid oxidation observed in the liver of SCD1-/--deficient mice is independent of PPARα pathway and involves other mechanisms including the activation of AMPK (50Dobrzyn P. Dobrzyn A. Miyazaki M. Cohen P. Asilmaz E. Hardie F.G. Friedman J.M. Ntambi J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6409-6414Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). We showed previously that mice with a deficiency of SCD1 are protected against increased adiposity, have increased energy expenditure, and show up-regulation of PPARα target genes in the liver. Liver and plasma triglycerides were decreased, and the genes of lipogenesis were down-regulated. These observations led to the hypothesis that one of the consequences of SCD1 deficiency is to partition fat toward increased oxidation while decreasing lipogenesis. PPARα is the predominant PPAR subtype expressed in mouse liver and BAT, and it plays a central role in the transcriptional activation of peroxisomal, mitochondrial, and microsomal fatty acid oxidation genes in these tissues (15Kersten S. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Nature. 2000; 405: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar, 16Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauca M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that SCD1 deficiency activates the PPARα pathway, we generated SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice and studied them with respect to adiposity, energy expenditure, and expression of PPARα target genes in the liver and BAT tissue. The study shows that SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice are still protected against adiposity, show increased energy expenditure, have reduced liver steatosis, and show increased fatty acid oxidation. The expression of β-oxidation genes in the liver and BAT remains elevated. Taken together, these results suggest that the phenotypes generated by SCD1 deficiency are independent of the PPARα pathway. The mechanism of increased expression of PPARα target genes in the liver and BAT of SCD1-/- mice is still unknown. However, as recently reported by Kertsen et al. (30Kersten S. Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar), the results in BAT are consistent with the PPARα-independent mechanism of the induction of the UCP-1 gene expression upon fasting. In BAT and under fasting conditions, other transcription factors such as PPARδ, PPARγ, and thyroid hormone receptor have been shown to control the expression of UCP1 (60Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3086) Google Scholar). These transcription factors are co-activated by binding with a cold-inducible co-activator PPARγ coactivator 1α, which is induced through the β3-adrenergic receptor signaling (60Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3086) Google Scholar). We previously found that SCD1-/- mice exhibited increased expression of the β3-adrenergic receptor isoform without alteration in the expression of the β1 and β2 isoforms. The expression of PPARγ coactivator 1α levels is increased in BAT (61Lee S. Dobrzyn A. Rahaman S. Dobrzyn P. Miyazaki M. Ntambi J.M. J. Lipid Res. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar) and in the liver. 2M. Miyazaki and J. M. Ntambi, unpublished data. Therefore, the increased expression of UCPs and fatty acid oxidation genes in BAT of SCD1-/- may be due to activation of either PPARγ or thyroid hormone receptor with the binding of PPARγ coactivator 1α. The muscle CPT-1 and UCP-3 mRNA levels are higher in the muscle of SCD1-/- and SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice (data not shown). The major PPAR isoform in muscle is δ/β. Thus the increased fatty acid oxidation caused by SCD1 deficiency may not be confined to the liver and BAT but may be global and regulated by different PPAR isoforms expressed in different tissues. The SCD1 deficiency could be generating ligands for other PPAR isoforms and not PPARα as previously proposed. PPARδ-transgenic mice and mice treated with PPARδ-specific agonists like SCD1-/- mice are protected from high fat diet-induced adiposity and insulin resistance because of the induction of genes of fatty acid oxidation and thermogenesis in the muscle and BAT (28Wang Y.X.

Also, similar to SCD1-/- mice, PPARγ-deficient mice and mice administrated with PPARγ antagonists ameliorate the development of adiposity and insulin resistance induced by high fat diet feeding (27Kubota N.

The studies to ascertain the involvement of other PPAR isoforms in SCD1 deficiency-mediated increase in fatty acid oxidation, reduced adiposity, and increased energy expenditure will require the crossing of the SCD1-/- mice with PPARβ/δ-/- or PPARγ-/- mice, and these studies are currently underway. We hypothesized previously that the reduction in hepatic triglycerides in SCD1-/- mice was due to increased PPARα-mediated oxidation of the fatty acids. We found in this study that the hepatic triglyceride levels were lower and that fatty acid oxidation was higher in SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- relative to the PPARα-/- mice. Moreover, male PPARα-/- mice exhibited a severe liver steatosis after high fat feeding, whereas little fat deposition was observed in the liver of SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice. These observations suggested that the reduction of hepatic triglycerides and increased fatty acid oxidation by SCD1 deficiency were independent of PPARα activation. Therefore, several alternative mechanisms for increased fatty acid oxidation by SCD1 deficiency are considered. First, although the PPARα target genes were still elevated in the SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice, lipogenesis was still down-regulated. The protein levels of ACC1 and ACC2 in the liver of SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- mice were lower than those in PPARα-/- mice (Fig. 6D), consistent with a decrease in ACC gene expression. The reduction in fatty acid synthesis and AMPK-mediated inactivation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Fig. 6D) can concomitantly enhance fatty acid oxidation by reducing malonyl-CoA levels and thereby removing the inhibition on CPT-1. However, the mechanisms of inhibition of lipogenesis and activation of AMPK by SCD1 deficiency are presently unknown. In summary, it has long been known that PPARα controls the expression of a number of genes involved in mitochondrial and perixosomal β-oxidation and plays an important role in maintaining energy homeostasis. The results presented here support the hypothesis that there are other mechanisms induced by SCD1 deficiency that lead to activation of genes of fatty acid oxidation independent of PPARα activation. Also, as we showed earlier (50Dobrzyn P. Dobrzyn A. Miyazaki M. Cohen P. Asilmaz E. Hardie F.G. Friedman J.M. Ntambi J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6409-6414Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and in the results shown here, post-transcriptional mechanisms such as the activation of AMPK induced by SCD1 deficiency can be partly responsible for the increased fatty acid oxidation in the SCD1-/-/PPARα-/- double knock-out mice. Overall, the studies show that the SCD1 deficiency overrides the PPARα deficiency and continues to protect mice against adiposity through increased thermogenesis and increased fatty acid oxidation. A further understanding of the regulation of SCD and the development of inhibitors for its activity will be important steps in the treatment of obesity and its associated risk factors.

https://openalex.org/W2011619507,"Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) are present in cells of the nervous system, where they are activated by one of the main neurotransmitters, glutamate. They are also expressed in cells outside the nervous system. We identified and characterized two receptors belonging to group I mGluR, mGlu1R and mGlu5R, in human cell lines of lymphoid origin and in resting and activated lymphocytes from human peripheral blood. Both are highly expressed in the human Jurkat T cell line, whereas mGlu5R is expressed only in the human B cell line SKW6.4. In blood lymphocytes, mGlu5R is expressed constitutively, whereas mGlu1R is expressed only upon activation via the T cell receptor-CD3 complex. Group I receptors in the central nervous system are coupled to phospholipase C, whereas in blood lymphocytes, activation of mGlu5R does not trigger this signaling pathway, but instead activates adenylate cyclase. On the other hand, mGlu5R does not mediate ERK1/2 activation, whereas mGlu1R, which is coupled neither to phospholipase C nor to calcium channels and whose activation does not increase cAMP, activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. The differential expression of mGluR in resting and activated lymphocytes and the different signaling pathways that are triggered when mGlu1Rs or mGlu5Rs are activated point to a key role of glutamate in the regulation of T cell physiological function. The study of the signaling pathways (cAMP production and ERK1/2 phosphorylation) and the proliferative response obtained in the presence of glutamate analogs suggests that mGlu1R and mGlu5R have distinct functions. mGlu5R mediates the reported inhibition of cell proliferation evoked by glutamate, which is reverted by the activation of inducible mGlu1R. This is a novel non-inhibitory action mechanism for glutamate in lymphocyte activation. mGlu1R and mGlu5R thus mediate opposite glutamate effects in human lymphocytes. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) are present in cells of the nervous system, where they are activated by one of the main neurotransmitters, glutamate.

This is a novel non-inhibitory action mechanism for glutamate in lymphocyte activation. mGlu1R and mGlu5R thus mediate opposite glutamate effects in human lymphocytes. There is increasing evidence that the activity of T cells in the central nervous system is regulated by neurotransmitters such as dopamine, gonadotropin-releasing hormones I and II, somatostatin, substance P, calcitonin-gene-related peptide, neuropeptide Y, and glutamate (1Ganor Y. Besser M. Ben-Zakai N. Unger T. Levite M. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 4362-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The latter is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain involved in learning and memory, as well as in neurotoxicity, and plays a critical role in the development and progression of diverse neurological disorders. T cells can also encounter glutamate outside the brain, in “glutamate-rich” peripheral organs such as liver, kidney, lung, muscle, and blood. It is unknown whether glutamate can be released by antigen-presenting cells, thus regulating T cell activation in the immunological synapse (2Angelini G. Gardella S. Ardy M. Ciriolo M.R. Filomeni G.

This amino acid acts at multiple receptor types, divided into two main groups: ionotropic glutamate receptors, which form ion channels and mediate fast excitatory glutamate responses, and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR), 1The abbreviations used are: mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptors; mGlunR, metabotropic glutamate receptor n; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PE, phycoerythrin; DHPG, dihydroxyphenylglycol; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinases; PHA, phytohemagglutinin; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase. which are hepta-spanning membrane-receptors and belong to the super-family of G protein-coupled receptors (3Nakanishi S. Science. 1992; 258: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (2299) Google Scholar). So far, eight members of the mGlu receptor family have been identified and classified into three subgroups (I, II, and III) according to their sequence homology, agonist selectivity, and signal transduction machinery (4Pin J.P. Duvoisin R. Neuropharm. 1995; 34: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar, 5Pin J.P. Acher F. Curr. Drug Targets CNS Neurol. Disord. 2002; 1: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Group I contains mGlu1 and mGlu5 receptor sub-types, which are mainly coupled to phospholipase C, and quisqualic acid is their most potent agonist. Group II consists of mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptors, which couple negatively to adenylyl cyclase in transfected cells and for which l-2-(carboxycyclopropyl) glycine is the most potent agonist. Group III contains mGlu4, mGlu6, mGlu7, and mGlu8 receptors, which again couple negatively to adenylyl cyclase, and l-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid is their most potent agonist. Kostanyan et al. (6Kostanyan I.A. Merkulova M.I. Navalotskaya E.V. Nurieva R.I. Immunol. Lett. 1997; 58: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) performed pioneering studies on radio-labelled glutamate binding to human blood lymphocytes. This binding may be due to the presence of transporters and/or specific glutamate receptors on the cell surface. The low KD value of glutamate binding and the inhibition by quisqualic acid strongly supports the presence of specific glutamate receptors of the metabotropic type (6Kostanyan I.A. Merkulova M.I. Navalotskaya E.V. Nurieva R.I. Immunol. Lett. 1997; 58: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Among the limited number of reports on the characterization of metabotropic receptors in locations other than the nervous systems, Storto et al. (7Storto M. De Grazia U. Battaglia G. Felli M.P.

However, the distribution and physiological role of mGluR in human lymphocytes remain unknown. In this paper, we provide evidence of the involvement of group I mGluR in the effects of glutamate on human lymphocytes. The presence of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGlu1R) and/or 5 (mGlu5R) in human lymphocytes, resting or activated, and in human T and B cell lines was approached by immunocytochemistry and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Our results show that mGlu5Rs are constitutively expressed in blood lymphocytes, and functional assays indicate that they may contribute to the maintenance of the resting status. In contrast, mGlu1Rs are only expressed upon T cell activation and, unlike mGlu5Rs, are coupled to the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade. Cells—The human T cell line Jurkat J-32 and the human B lymphoblast cell line SKW6.4 were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, UK) supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere of 5% CO2. Human T cells were isolated from heparinized blood of healthy donors using the Ficoll gradient method described by Boyum (8Boyum A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1968; 21: 51-62Google Scholar). Lymphocytes were depleted of contaminating monocytes by adherence to a plastic plate incubated 2 h in XVIVO-15 medium (Bio-Whittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 1% autologous serum, 50 μg/ml gentamycin (Braun B., Melsungen, Germany) and 2.5 μg/ml Fungizone (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Munchen, Germany). Cells were cultured in XVIVO-10 medium at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere of 5% CO2. Purified primary resting lymphocytes were activated by incubation (72 h) with 18 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin (PHA; Sigma-Aldrich Company LTD, Dorset, UK) or 1 ng/ml OKT3, a monoclonal antibody directed against the T cell receptor/CD3 complex (9Kung P.

Immunol. 1980; 124: 2708-2713PubMed Google Scholar). Immunostaining—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in PBS containing 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and washed twice with PBS containing 20 mm glycine to quench the aldehyde groups. When necessary, cells were permeabilized by adding FACS™ permeabilizing solution (Becton Dickinson Bioscience, Erembodegem-Aalst, Belgium) for 10 min and washing twice with PBS. Cells were treated with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm glycine, and 0.1% NaN3 (blocking buffer) and labeled with 3 μg/ml of affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-group I mGluR antibody (F1-Ab) for 1 h at room temperature (11Ciruela F. McIlhinney R.A.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cells were washed 3× with blocking buffer and stained for flow cytometry analysis with the secondary antibody phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:20; Sigma-Aldrich Company, Ltd) or AlexaFluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:1000; Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) for confocal microscopy analysis during a 1-h period. Negative controls were performed without F1-Ab. Coverslips were mounted with ImmunoFluor mounting medium (ICN Biomedical Inc., Costa Mesa, CA). Confocal microscope observations were made with a Leica TCS-SP (Leica Laser-technik GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) confocal scanning laser microscope adapted to an inverted Leitz DMIRBE microscope. Flow cytometry analysis was done with an EPICS Profile flow cytometer (Coulter, Hialeah, FL). Cell populations were selected by forward and side-light scatter parameters. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells with a Quik-Prep™ total RNA extraction kit (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). A 1-μg aliquot of total RNA and 1 μg of random hexamers (Invitrogen SA, Barcelona, Spain) as primers dissolved in 14 μl of RNase-free water were heated to 70 °C for 5 min and then cooled to 4 °C. 5 μl of RT buffer 5× Moloney murine leukemia virus (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 375 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 50 mm dithiothreitol; Promega Corp, Madison, WI), 1.5 μl of 2′-deoxynucleoside 5′-triphosphate (mix, 10 mm each; Sigma), 1 μl of reverse-transcriptase enzyme (M-MLV RT (H-), Promega Corp.), 1 μl of RNase inhibitor (RNaseA OUT; Invitrogen SA), and 2.5 μl of RNase-free water were added to a final volume of 25 μl. The incubation was continued at 25 °C for 10 min and 42 °C for 52 min, and was terminated by 70 °C for 15 min. PCR was carried out for 50 cycles (1 min at 95 °C, 45-s annealing (see below), 2 min at 72 °C) in a final volume of 50 μl containing 25 μl of 2× PCR master mix (Promega Corp.), 5 μl of cDNA and primers, each at 0.6 μm. RT-PCR negative control was performed by loading diethyl pyrocarbonate water instead of cDNA. Primers were selected according to Gen-Bank™ database resource, and annealing temperatures were as follows: mGlu1R, annealing at 60.5 °C; amplimer 453 bp; forward, 5′-ACC CGG TCC TCC TGC CCA ACA-3′; reverse, 5′-CGT CCA TTC CGC TCT CCC CAT AA-3′; mGlu5R, annealing at 58 °C; amplimer 661 bp; forward, 5′-TCC TGG CCA CCC TGT TTG TTA CTG-3′; reverse, 5′-GTG GCA CTG AGG CTG ACC GAG AAA-3′. Intracellular Ca2+ Measurements—Cells (107 cell/ml) were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2/AM (Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd) for 30 min at 37 °C in growing medium and subsequently resuspended (2 × 106 cell/ml) in calcium buffer (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose). Calcium peak induction was achieved by the addition of 5 μg/ml mouse monoclonal anti-CD3 antibody (secreted by 33-2A3 hybridoma, kindly provided by Dr. Jaume Martorell from Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain) or 100 μm dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG) (Tocris, Bristol, UK). Intracellular calcium was determined at 37 °C in a dual-wavelength Shimadzu RF-5000 spectrofluorophotometer (Shimadzu Europe, Duisberg, Germany) by using the excitation wavelength ratio of 334/366 nm with emission cutoff at 500 nm. Free calcium concentration was calculated as described previously (12Mirabet M. Mallol J. Lluis C. Franco R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Intracellular cAMP Measurements—Jurkat cells and resting or activated T cells were incubated 16 h before the experiments with fetal bovine serum (for Jurkat cells) or phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-free (for activated T cells) medium. Cells (5 × 106 cell/3 ml) were washed twice and resuspended with HBSS buffer (1.25 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 137 mm NaCl, 0.3 mm Na2HPO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Cells were incubated with 50 μm zardaverine (Tocris) for 10 min at 37 °C and treated without (control) or with 100 μm DHPG, 500 μm 2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine (CHPG; Tocris), or 200 nm CGS21680 (Sigma) as positive control for 25 min at 37 °C. The concentrations of agonists used in functional assays (cAMP, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), and proliferation) were selected according to the reported KD values of the binding of each agonist to its respective receptor. Cells were lysed, and levels of cAMP were measured using a cAMP Biotrak Enzymeimmunoassay system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol without acetylation, using the lysed equivalent to 106 cells/well. Phosphorylation of ERK—Jurkat cells and resting or activated T cells were incubated (16 h) with fetal bovine serum-free (for Jurkat cells) or PHA-free (for T cells) medium, washed twice, and resuspended in the same medium either containing or not the indicated inhibitors (GF 109203X, PD 98059, or H-89) for different time intervals. Cells were washed twice, resuspended with PBS (20 × 106 cell/ml for Jurkat or 10 × 106 cell/ml for T cells) and stimulated with the corresponding agonist. Cells were lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer 2× (2% Triton X-100, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) containing 2.08 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1.6 μm aprotinin, 42 μm leupeptin, 72 μm bestatin, 30 μm pepstatin A, and 28 μm E-64), and lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond-P, Amersham Biosciences), and phospho-ERK1/2 was detected by using a mouse monoclonal phosphor-specific ERK1/2 antibody (1:10,000, Sigma) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:1000; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Immunodetection was done with SuperSignal™ West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Membrane was stripped and reprobed with rabbit polyclonal total ERK1/2-specific antibody (1:40,000, Sigma) and secondary antibody horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:60,000; Chemicon International, Inc.) and detected as described previously. Densitometric analysis was performed by using the Scion Image program (integrated density was measured). Proliferation Assays—Human primary T cells (2 × 105 cells/well) in 100 μl of XVIVO-10 medium were incubated with 50 μl of different compounds and immediately after with 50 μl of 4 ng/ml mouse monoclonal anti-CD3 antibody (OKT3) (9Kung P. Goldstein G. Reinhertz E.L. Schlossman S.F. Science. 1979; 206: 347-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 10Van Wauwe J.P. De Mey J.R. Goznes J.G. J. Immunol. 1980; 124: 2708-2713PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 96 h. After 78 h of incubation, cells were pulsed for the final 18 h with 1 μCi of thymidine ([3H]methyl, 2 Ci/mmol; Moravek Biochemicals, Inc., Brea, CA) to measure [3H]thymidine incorporation. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 30 min, harvested onto filters, and tritium incorporation was determined by scintillation counting. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Differences between groups were evaluated using a Student's t test. To test whether human lymphocytes express group I metabotropic glutamate receptors in the plasma membrane, we attempted to detect mGlu1R and mGlu5R in a T cell line (Jurkat), in a B cell line (SKW6.4), and in resting and activated human blood lymphocytes by flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry. The antibody used, F1-Ab, is the only available antibody that recognizes an extracellular epitope; it cannot distinguish the two receptors, which share a high sequence homology. mGlu1R and/or mGlu5R were expressed with a high intensity of labeling in both cell lines, Jurkat and SKW6.4 (Fig. 1A); we found that more than 90% of Jurkat or SKW6.4 cells expressed the receptors. In resting human blood lymphocytes, the number of cells expressing mGlu1R and/or mGlu5R was low (16%), but upon activation, the number of cells expressing the targeted epitopes was markedly increased (30%) (Fig. 1B, upper panel). A variety of samples from several donors showed a similar pattern (Fig. 1B, lower panel). In activated cells, labeling intensity was much higher than in resting cells, and a clustered pattern of metabotropic glutamate receptor distribution was observed (Fig. 1C). Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors were expressed in both CD4+ and CD8+ populations (data not shown). To gain more insight into the subtype of receptor expressed in the cells, RT-PCR assays were performed after RNA isolation. mGlu5R transcripts are expressed in Jurkat cells, SKW6.4 cells, and in resting and activated blood lymphocytes (Fig. 2). In contrast, mGlu1R is expressed only in Jurkat T cells and in activated human blood lymphocytes. These results indicate that mGlu5R are constitutively expressed in blood lymphocytes, and mGlu1R are expressed only upon activation of the cells.Fig. 2RT-PCR analysis of mGlu1R and mGlu5R in human lymphocytes. mRNA from resting T cells (RT), activated T cells (AT), Jurkat cells (JU), and SKW6.4 cells (SK) was isolated, and RT-PCR analysis of mGlu1 (453 bp) and mGlu5 (661 bp) receptors was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Size markers are at the left. Extracts from human cerebral cortex were used as positive controls (+), and diethyl pyrocarbonate H2O were used as negative controls (-). A representative experiment is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is well known that group I mGluRs are coupled to phospholipase C, thus increasing the levels of both inositol phosphates and intracellular calcium (3Nakanishi S. Science. 1992; 258: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (2299) Google Scholar, 4Pin J.P. Duvoisin R. Neuropharm. 1995; 34: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). To identify the signaling pathways associated with the activation of the mGluRs expressed in the T cell line and in resting and activated lymphocytes, calcium mobilization was analyzed. 5 μg/ml of the antibody against the T cell receptor-CD3 complex substantially increased calcium levels in all cells assayed, whereas the non-selective group I mGluR agonist, DHPG, at concentrations up to 100 μm, failed to do so (Fig. 3). These results disagree with the well known coupling of group I mGluRs to phospholipase C in neuronal and glial cells (4Pin J.P. Duvoisin R. Neuropharm. 1995; 34: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). In heterologous expression systems, the activation of group I mGluRs increases cAMP (13Francesconi A. Duvoisin R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5615-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). For this reason, cAMP production was examined. DHPG, the non-selective agonist, or CHPG, a highly selective mGlu5R agonist, significantly raised cAMP levels, and the effects of the two agonists on Jurkat cells and resting and activated lymphocytes did not differ significantly (Fig. 4). This indicates that activation of mGlu5Rs elicits increases in cAMP levels. 1-Aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylate, a compound that activates metabotropic receptors, raises cAMP by an indirect mechanism that enhances the stimulation of adenylate cyclase by endogenous adenosine (14Winder D.G. Conn P.J. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 38-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The glutamate effects on cAMP levels in lymphocytes were not mediated by the extracellular adenosine present in the medium, because they were not prevented by the addition of adenosine deaminase, which degrades the endogenous extracellular nucleoside. There is controversy about the involvement of glutamate-mediated phospholipase C activation in the increase of cAMP levels after activation of these receptors (4Pin J.P. Duvoisin R. Neuropharm. 1995; 34: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). Our results clearly indicate that activation of phospholipase C and calcium mobilization are not a prerequisite for the increases in cAMP levels detected in lymphocytes when mGlu5Rs are activated. This suggests that in lymphocytes, mGlu5Rs, but not mGlu1Rs, are coupled to stimulatory Gs proteins. However, an indirect effect mediated by unidentified modulators whose receptors are coupled to Gs or the involvement of βγ-subunits in the activation of adenylate cyclase cannot be ruled out (4Pin J.P. Duvoisin R. Neuropharm. 1995; 34: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar).Fig. 4mGlu5R activation mediates cAMP increases. Jurkat cells, resting T cells, and activated T cells were treated without (Control) or with 100 μm DHPG, 500 μm CHPG, or 200 nm CGS21680 (CGS) as a positive control; intracellular cAMP concentration was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are expressed as % of the control.

The kinetics of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was fast and peaked at 1 min of treatment with 100 μm DHPG. ERK1/2 activation was assayed in the presence of inhibitors of protein kinase C, protein kinase A, or MEK. ERK1/2 activation via mGluRs was abolished by PD 98059, the MEK inhibitor, in agreement with the role of MEK as a kinase that directly phosphorylates ERK1/2. GF 109203X, the inhibitor of protein kinase C, had no effect upon DHPG-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, thus indicating that for mGlu1R, protein kinase C is not upstream of MEK. These results agree with those presented in Fig. 3, which indicate that group I mGluRs cannot induce calcium mobilization in lymphocytes, which is the most common pathway associated with group I mGluR activation in neurons. H-89, the protein kinase A inhibitor, did not hinder ERK1/2 phosphorylation, indicating that mGluR1 does not mediate the activation of protein kinase A upstream of MEK. The higher ERK1/2 phosphorylation detected in the presence of H-89 may be due to the role of protein kinase A as an inhibitor of the MAP kinase pathway (15Ramstad C. Sundvold V. Johansen H.K. Lea T. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To determine whether ERK1/2 activation also occurred in peripheral blood lymphocytes, similar experiments were performed in resting and activated lymphocytes, which were treated with either CHPG or DHPG. In resting lymphocytes, ERK1/2 activation was not triggered by either of the compounds used, whereas in activated cells, DHPG, but not CHPG, induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 6). Therefore, inducible mGlu1Rs, but not constitutively expressed mGlu5Rs, are coupled to the MAP kinase cascade in human peripheral T lymphocytes.Fig. 6Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in human T cells is mediated by mGlu1R but not by mGlu5R stimulation. Resting T cells and activated T cells were treated (1 min) without or with 100 μm mGlu1/5R agonist (DHPG) or 500 μm mGlu5R-specific agonist (CHPG). Cells were lysed, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was examined by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using phospho-specific ERK1/2 antibody. Immunoblots were stripped and reprobed with ERK1/2-specific antibody, which recognizes total ERK1/2 to confirm equal loading. A representative experiment using blood from a single healthy donor is shown (lower panel). Western blots obtained from three healthy donors were analyzed by densitometry, normalized to total ERK1/2, and expressed in fold compared with the control (upper panel). *, p < 0.005.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As is the case with receptors of other neurotransmitters, the metabotropic glutamate receptors in lymphocytes should be identified to understand the links and parallelisms between the immune and the nervous systems. Ganor et al. (1Ganor Y. Besser M. Ben-Zakai N. Unger T. Levite M. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 4362-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) have recently reported that glutamate directly activates, via ionotropic glutamate receptors, T cell function and triggers integrin-mediated adhesion and chemotactic migration. This allows dialogues between the nervous and immune system in health and disease. The authors emphasize the relevance of these results in T cells transmigrating to the central nervous system and patrolling the brain, in T cell-mediated multiple sclerosis, and in autoimmune epilepsy. The activation of ionotropic receptors leads to T cell activation in the absence of an antigenic stimulus, whereas mGlu5Rs, like other receptors elevating cAMP levels, may behave as a strong inhibitor of T cell activity (16Torgersen K.M. Vang T. Abrahamsen H. Yaqub S. Tasken K. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To elucidate the effect of mGlu5R, which is positively coupled to adenylate cyclase, on cell proliferation, lymphocytes were treated with CHPG and then activated with the anti-T cell receptor-CD3 complex. Specific activation of mGlu5R by CHPG significantly inhibited cell proliferation, as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 7), which indicates that the reported inhibition of glutamate in lymphocytic proliferative response (17Lombardi G. Dianzani C. Miglio G. Canonico P.L. Fantozzi R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 133: 936-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) is probably mediated by the constitutively expressed mGlu5R. This inhibitory effect was suppressed when activated cells were treated with the non-selective agonist DHPG. Glutamate may thus play a dual role in T cell function, because it inhibits cell proliferation via mGlu5R but reverts this inhibition when mGlu1R is expressed. As KD values for mGlu1R and mGlu5R are in the range 10-60 μm (4Pin J.P. Duvoisin R. Neuropharm. 1995; 34: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar), they can be activated by the glutamate present in plasma, whose concentration varies between 30 and 60 μm(18Tsai P.J. Huang P.C. Metabolism. 1999; 48: 1455-1460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Divino Filho J.C. Hazel S.J. Furst P. Bergstrom J. Hall K. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 156: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Chronic activation of mGlu5R by glutamate in lymphocytes may lead to receptor desensitization and/or internalization. The few studies devoted to the desensitization of this receptor indicate that in heterologous systems, mGlu5R depends upon PKC activation (20Dale L.B. Badwah A.V. Ferguson S.S.G. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 41: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is improbable that this mechanism operates in lymphocytes, because mGlu5R activation is not coupled to the PKC pathway. In heterologous cells, members of the GRK2 family are involved in receptor phosphorylation and internalization (21Sorensen S.D. Conn P.J. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 44: 699-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The expression of active receptors on the surface of cells depends upon their traffic, which is influenced by internalization after receptor activation, and by the rate of receptor recycling, among others. Flow cytometry using permeabilized cells revealed that the percentage of cells expressing the receptor was much higher than in non-permeabilized cells. Also, the intensity of the labeling was higher in permeabilized cells. This indicates that a percentage of resting T lymphocytes express mGlu5R at the cell surface and in intracellular membranes, whereas another set of cells express the receptor-only intracellulary (Fig. 8). Intracellular mGlu5R pools may reflect down-regulation after the chronic exposure of lymphocytes to serum glutamate or else some kind of agonist-independent regulation of the cell-surface expression of the receptor. In fact, significant intracellular pools of G protein-coupled receptors are often found, even in the absence of agonist activation (22Arslan G. Kull B. Fredholm B.B. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmakol. 2002; 365: 150-157Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but their role has not yet been completely elucidated. Because agonists increase the levels of the second messenger cAMP and inhibit T cell receptor-mediated cell proliferation, the mGlu5Rs expressed on the cell surface of resting blood T lymphocytes are functional. Because of the presence of micromolar levels of glutamate in blood, it would be wise to assume that constitutively expressed mGlu5Rs on the surface of a population of blood T cells are tonically activated, leading to a tonic increase in cAMP levels. The increases in cAMP affect proliferation and cytokine expression (16Torgersen K.M. Vang T. Abrahamsen H. Yaqub S. Tasken K. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), which may constitute a brake mechanism to prevent unspecific T cell activation. In contrast, the role of inducible mGlu1R may be crucial to the activation of both T cells in blood and T-lymphoblasts entering the central nervous system in brain pathologies and in immune-mediated illnesses. In conclusion, resting lymphocytes express mGlu5R constitutively, whereas mGlu1R expression is induced upon activation. Neither receptor is coupled in lymphocytes to the calcium and phosphoinositide-signaling machinery operating in brain cells. Instead, mGlu1Rs are coupled to the MAP kinase pathway, and mGlu5Rs increase cAMP levels. In agreement with the complexity and variety of glutamate effects in the central nervous system, the variety of signaling mechanisms triggered by glutamate in lymphocytes by means of ionotropic and metabotropic receptors indicates that glutamate regulates lymphoid function and that further studies are required to fully understand its role. In principle, glutamate exerts a tonic inhibitory effect via constitutively expressed mGluR5, whereas it has a costimulatory role when mGluR1s are expressed upon T cell activation."

This paper describes the process of chain length determination in the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter-dependent pathway, a pathway that is widespread among Gram-negative bacteria.

Methyl groups are added to the O9a polymannan in a reaction dependent on preceding phosphorylation. The bifunctional WbdDO9a catalyzes both reactions, but only the kinase activity controls chain length. Chain termination occurs in a mutant lacking the ABC transporter, indicating that it precedes export. An E. coli wbdDO9a mutant accumulated O9a polymannan in the cytoplasm, indicating that WbdD activity coordinates polymannan chain termination with export across the inner membrane.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; O-PS, O-antigenic polysaccharide; und-P, undecaprenol phosphate; und-PP, undecaprenol pyrophosphate; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. is a unique and abundant glycolipid found in the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria. LPS has three structural domains (1Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic lipid A forms the outer leaflet of the outer membrane and is responsible for the endotoxic properties of LPS. A short core oligosaccharide extends from lipid A. In many bacteria, the core is capped with a repeating unit glycan polymer known as the O polysaccharide (O-PS; O antigen). Lipid A is structurally conserved among Gram-negative bacteria, whereas limited variability of the core oligosaccharide is often observed within species. For example, five distinct core structures have been identified in different isolates of Escherichia coli (2Heinrichs D.E. Yethon J.A. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In contrast, O-PS structures vary extensively within a given species because of differences in the number and type of sugars in the repeat unit and the nature of glycosidic linkages within and between repeat units. Variation of the O-PS forms the basis of the O-antigen serotyping scheme. There are ∼170 O serotypes in E. coli (3Ørskov I. Ørskov F. Jann B. Jann K. Bacteriol. Rev. 1977; 41: 667-710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LPS preparations from a given isolate contain a spectrum of molecular species with different sizes. The distribution can range from lipid A core molecules devoid of O-PS to LPS molecules with greater than 100 O-PS repeat units. However, most O-PS-substituted LPS molecules in a preparation fall within a limited size range (i.e. a modal distribution). Lipid A-core and O-PS are synthesized separately at the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane. The two component parts are subsequently ligated at the periplasmic face of the inner membrane prior to export to the cell surface (reviewed in Ref. 1Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar). Goldman and Hunt (4Goldman R.C. Hunt F. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5352-5359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) first suggested that the modal distribution was established by competition between O-PS polymerization and termination (by ligation). However, subsequent work has implicated specific components of the O-PS biosynthesis systems in regulating the modal distribution of some O-PSs (see below). O-PSs are assembled on a 55-carbon lipid acceptor, undecaprenol phosphate (und-P), and biosynthesis is initiated by transfer of a sugar-1-phosphate residue from its nucleotide diphosphosugar precursor to und-P. Subsequent extension and processing of the und-PP-linked intermediate proceeds through one of three distinct pathways. Although one of these pathways is currently confined to a single example (5Keenleyside W.J. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28581-28592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the other two are widespread among Gram-negative bacteria. The two major pathways are termed Wzy (polymerase)-dependent and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter-dependent biosynthesis, respectively. They differ by the mechanisms involved in polymerization of the repeat units and in the process of translocation of the und-PP-linked polymer or intermediates across the inner membrane. In the Wzy-dependent mechanism (reviewed in Ref. 1Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar), single O-PS repeat units are assembled on an und-P carrier lipid by sequential glycosyltransferase reactions. A translocase (Wzx) then mobilizes und-PP-linked repeat units to the periplasmic face of the inner membrane, where the polymerase (Wzy) assembles those repeat units into und-PP-linked polysaccharide. Chain extension occurs by transfer of the growing glycan from the und-PP carrier to the nonreducing terminus of another und-PP-linked monomer, effectively extending the chain one repeat unit at a time. The extent of polymerization is controlled in a process that is not yet understood by the chain-length regulator protein, Wzz (formerly Rol or Cld) (6Batchelor R.A. Haraguchi G.E. Hull R.A. Hull S.I. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5699-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 7Bastin D.A. Stevenson G. Brown P.K. Haase A. Reeves P.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 8Morona R. Van Den Bosch L. Manning P.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Different Wzz proteins confer a characteristic modal distribution of O-PS chain length when expressed in a heterologous Wzy-dependent system (9Klee S.R. Tzschaschel B.D. Timmis K.N. Guzman C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2421-2425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Franco A.V. Liu D. Reeves P.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2670-2675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The O-PS chains of wzz mutants are composed predominantly of one or two repeat units, and the amount of each molecule is inversely proportional to its size, i.e. fully elongated LPS species are extremely rare (7Bastin D.A. Stevenson G. Brown P.K. Haase A. Reeves P.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 11Murray G.L. Attridge S.R. Morona R. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1395-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In the ABC transporter-dependent pathway, O-PS chains are elongated on the und-PP-linked intermediate by processive glycosyl transfer onto the nonreducing end of nascent polymer (reviewed in Ref. 1Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar). Polymerization occurs within the cytoplasm, and an ABC transporter is required for export of the nascent polymer to the periplasmic face of the inner membrane, where it is ligated to lipid A-core (12Bronner D. Clarke B.R. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 505-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This system requires neither a Wzy polymerase enzyme nor a Wzz chain-length regulator. However, the resulting O-PSs still exhibit a modal chain-length distribution. Recent structural analysis has identified novel residues at the nonreducing end of some O-PSs synthesized by the ABC transporter-dependent pathway (Ref. 13Vinogradov E. Frirdich E. MacLean L.L. Perry M.B. Petersen B.O. Duus J.O. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25070-25081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar and the references therein). Here we describe for the first time the role played by these nonreducing terminal modifications in O-PS chain termination. The polymannan O-PSs of E. coli O8, O9, and O9a provide models for the ABC transporter-dependent pathway. These polymers share structural features and conserved biosynthesis steps, reflecting genes common to the O-PS biosynthesis genetic loci (Fig. 1). The polymannans have nonreducing terminal O-methyl groups (13Vinogradov E. Frirdich E. MacLean L.L. Perry M.B. Petersen B.O. Duus J.O. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25070-25081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 14Jansson P.-E. Lönngren J. Widmalm G. Carbohydr. Res. 1985; 145: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Identical O-PS structures and gene clusters are found in Klebsiella pneumoniae O3 (E. coli O9) and K. pneumoniae O5 (E. coli O8) as a result of lateral gene transfer (15Sugiyama T. Kido N. Kato Y. Koide N. Yoshida T. Yokochi T. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 198: 111-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structural and biosynthetic data for the E. coli and K. pneumoniae analogs are interchangeable. The mechanistic details of assembling the E. coli O8 and O9a O-PSs on the lipid carrier have not been fully elucidated, but a working biosynthetic model has been proposed based on the available structural and genetic evidence (13Vinogradov E. Frirdich E. MacLean L.L. Perry M.B. Petersen B.O. Duus J.O. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25070-25081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 16Kido N. Torgov V.I. Sugiyama T. Uchiya K. Sugihara H. Komatsu T. Kato N. Jann K. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2178-2187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). O-PS synthesis begins with the conserved formation of a “primer” by transfer of a GlcNAc-1-phosphate residue to und-P. This step is catalyzed by the product of the wecA gene (17Rick P.D. Hubbard G.L. Barr K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2877-2884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). WecA activity is not confined to O-PS biosynthesis, and the structural gene is located outside of the O-PS biosynthesis gene cluster (18Rick P.D. Silver R.P. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1996: 104-122Google Scholar). Using the primed lipid intermediate as an acceptor, an adaptor disaccharide is assembled by the mannosyltransferases WbdC and WbdB (16Kido N. Torgov V.I. Sugiyama T. Uchiya K. Sugihara H. Komatsu T. Kato N. Jann K. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2178-2187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adaptor synthesis commits the lipid intermediate to the O-PS biosynthetic pathway. The remaining polymer containing the repeating unit is assembled by the processive activity of one or both of the WbdA and WbdB mannosyltransferases. The E. coli O9 and O9a structural variants arise from mutations affecting the WbdA mannosyltransferase, and a single amino acid change is sufficient to alter the structure of the O-PS repeat unit (Fig. 1) and convert serotype O9 to O9a (19Kido N. Kobayashi H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2567-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The primer, adaptor, and repeat-unit domains are clearly identified in structural studies of the LPSs (13Vinogradov E. Frirdich E. MacLean L.L. Perry M.B. Petersen B.O. Duus J.O. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25070-25081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate that the WbdD proteins control the chain length of the E. coli O8 and O9a polymannans by modifying the nonreducing end of nascent und-PP-linked polymer. Additionally, we provide evidence that these terminal modifications couple polymerization/termination with the export of nascent O-PS across the inner membrane. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—The bacterial strains used in this study are described in Table I. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in either LB medium (20Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 431-433Google Scholar) or M9 minimal medium (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: A.3Google Scholar). When required, media were supplemented with glucose (0.4% w/v), mannose (0.2 or 0.4% w/v), sucrose (5% w/v), histidine (22 μg/ml), tryptophan (20 μg/ml), or thiamine (1 μg/ml). The antibiotics ampicillin (100 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml), gentamycin (15 μg/ml), kanamycin (25 μg/ml), streptomycin (200 μg/ml), and tetracycline (15 μg/ml) were added when required. Strains harboring wbdD or wzm-wzt mutations were maintained on media lacking mannose to avoid the high frequency acquisition of second-site mutations that relieved the growth defect by eliminating polymannan synthesis.Table IBacterial strainsStrainDescription or genotypeReference or sourceF470E. coli O8-:K-Ref. 65Vinogradov E.V. van der Drift K.

Whitfield, unpublished data Open table in a new tab Construction of manA Mutants—Mutants defective in mannose-6-phosphate isomerase (manA) were constructed by transferring the manA4 allele from the Hfr donor E. coli CWG102 into CWG291 (O8) and CWG28 (O9a). Hfr-mediated chromosomal transfer was performed by plate mating and manA derivatives (CWG636, O8 and CWG634, O9a) were obtained by selecting for a Tn10 insertion (Tcr) linked to the manA4 allele (Table I). The ManA– phenotype was confirmed by the lack of acid production on MacConkey-mannose agar and by showing that O-PS synthesis was dependent on the inclusion of mannose in the growth media. DNA Methods—Custom-made oligonucleotides were obtained from Sigma-Genosys and used in PCR amplification under conditions optimal for each primer pair. Template DNA was obtained by resuspending bacterial cells from a single colony directly into the PCRs. Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) was used if amplification products were to be cloned, and Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) was used for screening of mutants and ligation products. PCR products and restriction fragments were purified either from agarose gels with the Ultraclean15 DNA purification kit (MOBIO Laboratories) or directly from the PCR with the Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Plasmid DNA was purified with the GeneElute plasmid purification kit (Sigma). Restriction endonuclease digestions, DNA modification, and DNA ligation were all performed using standard methods as recommended by the enzyme manufacturers. DNA sequencing was performed by the Guelph Molecular Supercenter (University of Guelph, Guelph, Canada). Cloning and Overexpression of the wbdD Gene Products—The genes encoding WbdDO8 and WbdDO9a were cloned on DNA fragments amplified by PCR from the chromosomes of E. coli 2775 and E69, respectively. Restriction sites designed in the primers were used to clone the amplified fragments in pBAD24 (22Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar) to form pWQ53 (O8) and pWQ52 (O9a). The primers for wbdDO8 were 5′-CCCGGAATTCACCATGGGTTCGTCGTTTTATCG-3′ (EcoRI site underlined) and 5′-CAATACGTCGACTTATTTCTCCGTATTTTTATTTTTTAATTCG-3′ (SalI). Those for wbdDO9a were 5′-GATCGAATTCACCATGACTAAAGACTTAAACACGCTGGT-3′ (EcoRI) and 5′-GTTAGGTACCTTTATTTTTCGTTAGTTTGAGAT-3′ (KpnI). The WbdDO9a protein encoded by pWQ52 contained a C-terminal FLAG peptide fusion. To construct the FLAG-fusion the primer pairs, 5′-CCGGGGTACCGACTACAAGGACGACGACGACAA-3′ (KpnI) and 5′-AATTTTCTGCAGTTACTTGTCGTCGTCGTCCTT-3′ (PstI), were annealed, and extended with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The KpnI and PstI restriction sites designed into the primers were used to insert the resulting FLAG-encoding fragment in-frame at the 3′ end of the wbdDO9a open reading frame. Construction of Chromosomal Insertion Mutations by Allelic Exchange—The wbdDO9a gene was inactivated by removing a 0.5-kb SmaI fragment from the middle of the open reading frame cloned in pWQ52 and replacing it with a SmaI fragment containing the aacC1 gene from pUC-Gm (23Schweizer H.P. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 831-833PubMed Google Scholar) to form pWQ54. The aacC1 gene cassette is nonpolar when inserted in the same orientation as wbdDO9a. A fragment containing the inactivated wbdDO9a gene was isolated from pWQ54 and cloned into the temperature-sensitive suicide delivery vector pKO3 (24Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar) to generate pWQ55. To transfer the wbdDO9a::aacC1 mutation into the E. coli O9a chromosome, CWG634(pWQ55) transformants were plated onto LB (glucose and chloramphenicol) agar and incubated at 45 °C. Colonies from the initial selection, potentially containing integrants, were pooled and subjected to further selection for plasmid excision on LB (glucose, sucrose, and gentamycin) agar at 30 °C. For construction of a wzm-wzt chromosomal mutation, a fragment containing both wzm-wzt and flanking DNA was amplified by PCR from E. coli CWG28 chromosomal DNA using the primers, 5′-TTCCGGTACCATGACGAGGCGTCGTTTATCG-3′ (KpnI site underlined) and 5′-CTCAGGTACCTTGGTAGCTAGTAAAGGACGAC-3′ (KpnI). The vector pBluescriptSK+ was modified by excising a HincII-EcoRV fragment from the multiple cloning site. KpnI sites designed into the PCR primers were used to clone the wzm-wzt fragment into the KpnI site of the modified pBluescriptSK+ derivative to form pWQ56. A HincII-EcoRV fragment spanning the wzm and wzt genes was replaced with a SmaI fragment containing the aphA-3 gene from pYA3265 to form pWQ57. A KpnI fragment containing the disrupted wzm-wzt genes was inserted into the KpnI site of the suicide delivery vector pRE112 to form pWQ58. The use of pRE112 derivatives for chromosomal gene replacement is described elsewhere (25Edwards R.A. Keller L.H. Schifferli D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 207: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Derivatives of CWG634 containing the Δwzm-wzt::aphA-3 mutation were selected on LB (glucose, sucrose, kanamycin, and streptomycin) agar at 30 °C. Chromosomal insertion mutations in strains CWG635 (CWG634 wbdD::aacC1; Gmr) and CWG638 (CWG634 Δwzm-wzt::aphA-3; Kmr) were confirmed by analysis of PCR products amplified using primers flanking the targeted region. Preparation of Cell Envelope Fractions—Cultures (200 ml) were grown to mid-exponential phase (A600 nm = 0.6). The cells were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min, washed once in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and resuspended in 25 ml of assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5). The cells were lysed by ultrasonication with intermittent cooling on ice. The cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min. The membranes were separated from the cleared lysate by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, resuspended in 0.75 ml of assay buffer, and stored at –75 °C. In Vitro Incorporation of Radiolabeled Substrates into Membrane Fractions—Time-dependent incorporation of [14C]mannose from GDP-[14C]mannose into polymannan was assayed in 1 ml of assay buffer containing membranes (1 mg of protein). The reaction was initiated by adding GDP-[14C]mannose (1 μm 330 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reactions were performed at 30 °C. Samples (100 μl) were removed at various time points, and the reactions were stopped by mixing with 1 ml of ice-cold 12% (v/v) acetic acid. The membranes were collected onto MicronSep 0.45-μm cellulose filters (Osmonics) and washed with 2 ml of 12% (v/v) acetic acid. The filters were dried and submersed in 5 ml of Ecolite scintillant (ICN Biomedicals), and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The membranes were assayed in triplicate. For experiments involving SDS-PAGE of radiolabeled O-PS intermediates, the reactions were performed in 0.1 ml of assay buffer containing membranes (0.1 mg of protein). Unless indicated otherwise, unlabeled substrates consisted of 1 μm GDP-mannose, 2.5 mmS-adenosylmethionine, and 10 μm ATP. In individual experiments, one of the unlabeled substrates was substituted with the respective radiolabeled substrate: GDP-[14C(U)]mannose (1 μm, 330 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences); S-[methyl-3H]adenosylmethionine (1 μm, 55 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and -[γ-32P]ATP (50 nm, 7000 Ci/mmol; ICN). The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h and stopped by the addition of 25 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (312 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% (w/v) SDS, 0.0125% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 50% (v/v) glycerol, 1.8 m β-mercaptoethanol). The samples were heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min, and 20-μl aliquots were separated by SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE gels containing products labeled with [14C]mannose and 32P were visualized using a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX). Products labeled with [3H]methyl residues were visualized by fluorography on Kodak BioMax MR 1 film and using Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) as the fluorographic reagent. Analytical Methods—The protein concentrations of membrane preparations were determined with the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Whole LPS was prepared for SDS-PAGE by proteinase K treatment of whole cell lysates (26Hitchcock P.J. Brown T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 269-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to loading, the samples were heated at 100 °C for 5 min. SDS-PAGE was performed using 12% acrylamide gels (3.3%C) in Tris-glycine buffer (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). LPS was visualized by silver staining (28Tsai G.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2317) Google Scholar). Preparation of Anti-O9a Antibody—New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with formalin-killed whole cells of E. coli CWG28. To prepare O9a-specific antibodies, immune serum was adsorbed with whole cells of both E. coli CWG291 and F470. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to visualize the O9a antigen in fixed cells with and without a permeabilizing step. Bacteria were grown in M9-glucose (0.2% w/v) broth at 37 °Ctoan A600 nm of 0.3. Mannose (0.4% w/v) was added to the cultures, and incubation was continued for 2 h to allow accumulation of O-PS. Cells (1 A600 nm) were collected by centrifugation at 4500 × g, resuspended in 1 ml of formaldehyde solution (5% (v/v) in PBS), and incubated at 4 °C for 16 h. Fixed cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice in 1 ml of PBS, and resuspended in 0.1 ml of PBS. The cell suspension (0.01 ml) was applied to the well of a glass slide coated with poly-l-lysine and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Bacterial cells were made permeable by a modification of a method described elsewhere (29Stricker J. Erickson H.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4796-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The fixed cell sample was incubated at room temperature for 15 min in 10 μl of lysozyme solution (0.5 mg/ml in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and then at room temperature for 15 min in Triton X-100 (0.1% v/v in PBS). Antibody labeling of the O9a O-PS was performed by treating the slides at room temperature for 15 min with bovine serum albumin solution (1% w/v in PBS), washing extensively in PBS, and incubating with anti-O9a antiserum (1:100 in bovine serum albumin solution) at 37 °C for 30 min. The slides were washed extensively in PBS and treated with rhodamine red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:50 in bovine serum albumin solution; Jackson Immunoresearch). The labeled slides were washed in PBS and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Bacteria were viewed on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope using a 100× objective lens, and the images were processed using Openlab software (Improvision). Conserved Motifs in the WbdD Proteins Implicate Them in the Addition of Nonreducing Terminal Residues to the O8 and O9a Polymannans—The predicted WbdD proteins from E. coli serotypes O8 and O9a differ in size at 48,630 Da (O8) and 81,731 Da (O9a), respectively. Although these proteins share only limited overall similarity, they do contain the same conserved motifs (Fig. 2). WbdDO8 and WbdDO9a share a region of sequence near their C termini that exhibits 34% identity and 53% similarity over 113 amino acids (Fig. 2). These domains are predicted to have a high probability (>98%) of forming coiled-coil structures as determined by the COILS algorithm (30Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar). Each exhibits the characteristic heptad repeat motif (31Tripet B. Wagschal K. Lavigne P. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 377-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) with hydrophobic residues at positions a and d and charged or polar residues at e and g. Residues a and d provide the interface between interacting α-helices, and different modes of interaction are possible. An additional putative coiled-coil domain (probability >95%) is found in WbdDO9a only (Fig. 2). The N-terminal regions of the WbdD proteins share significant similarity with AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases. The WbdD proteins share the most similarity with a consensus motif from the UbiE family of methyltransferases that are involved in ubiquinone/menaquinone biosynthesis (Fig. 2). Three conserved amino acid sequence motifs (I, II, and III) have been identified in most methyltransferases, and they are implicated in AdoMet binding and methyl transfer (32Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Motifs I, II, and III were identified in the deduced amino acid sequence of WbdDO8. The WbdDO9a protein contained motifs I and II, but motif III was not evident (Fig. 2). The WbdDO9a protein contains an additional region sharing similarity with the catalytic domain consensus motif from serine/threonine protein kinases (Ref. 33Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2296) Google Scholar and Fig. 2). The invariant aspartate (Asp351) and asparagine (Asn356) residues of the kinase catalytic loop (motif VIb) and the highly conserved DFG (Asp369-Phe370-Gly371) sequence (motif VII) were identified in WbdDO9a (Fig. 2). The absence of a comparable kinase domain in WbdDO8 is reflected in its smaller size compared with WbdDO9a. Previous structural analyses of the E. coli O8 PS and the structurally identical Klebsiella O5 PS have shown the presence of O-methyl substitutions at the nonreducing ends of these polymers (13Vinogradov E. Frirdich E. MacLean L.L. Perry M.B. Petersen B.O. Duus J.O. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25070-25081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 14Jansson P.-E. Lönngren J. Widmalm G. Carbohydr. Res. 1985; 145: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The similarity shared by WbdDO8 and known methyltransferases is consistent with the hypothesis that WbdD modifies the nonreducing end of the growing und-PP-linked O-PS. In the K. pneumoniae O5 (E. coli O8) polymer, the precise linkage of the 3-O-methyl group was identified by two-dimensional NMR experiments (13Vinogradov E. Frirdich E. MacLean L.L. Perry M.B. Petersen B.O. Duus J.O. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25070-25081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, the terminal linkage of the identified methyl group in the K. pneumoniae O3 (E. coli O9) was not conclusively established. Given that WbdDO9a contains putative methyltransferase and kinase domains, the terminal modification may be more complex, potentially involving both phosphorylation and methylation.

We previously showed that inducible expression of the catalytic domain of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) inhibits glucose-regulated TSP1 transcription and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β activity in stably transfected rat mesangial cells (RMCs(tr/cd)). However, the molecular mechanisms by which PKG represses glucose-regulated TSP1 transcription are unknown. Using a luciferase-promoter deletion assay, we now identify a single region of the human TSP1 promoter (–1172 to –878, relative to the transcription start site) that is responsive to glucose. Further characterization of this region identified an 18-bp sequence that specifically binds nuclear proteins from mesangial cells. Moreover, binding is significantly enhanced by high glucose treatment and is reduced by increased PKG activity. Gel mobility shift and supershift assays show that the nuclear proteins binding to the 18-bp sequence are USF1 and -2. USF1 and USF2 bound to the endogenous TSP1 promoter using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Glucose stimulates nuclear USF2 protein accumulation through protein kinase C, p38 MAPK, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways. Increased PKG activity down-regulates USF2 protein levels and its DNA binding activity under high glucose conditions, resulting in inhibition of glucose-induced TSP1 transcription and TGF-β activity. Overexpression of USF2 reversed the inhibitory effect of PKG on glucose-induced TSP1 gene transcription and TGF-β activity. Taken together these data present the first evidence that USF2 mediates glucose-induced TSP1 expression and TSP1-dependent TGF-β bioactivity in mesangial cells, suggesting that USF2 is an important transcriptional regulator of diabetic complications.

Furthermore, high glucose mediates increases in TSP1 expression and TSP1-dependent TGF-β bioactivity through down-modulation of nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) signaling (18Wang S.

In our previous studies we generated stably transfected rat mesangial cells with tetracycline-regulated expression of the catalytic domain of PKG-I to directly regulate the activity of PKG independent of cGMP levels (19Wang S. Wu X. Lincoln T.M. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2144-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Using these stably transfected rat mesangial cells, we showed that expression of the catalytic domain of PKG significantly repressed glucose-induced but not basal TSP1 gene transcription and TSP1-dependent TGF-β activation (19Wang S. Wu X. Lincoln T.M. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2144-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms by which glucose up-regulates and PKG represses glucose induction of TSP1 transcription are unknown. In previous work, using the human TSP1 promoter we showed that high glucose concentrations (30 mm) up-regulate the activity of a 2.033-kilobase region of the human TSP1 promoter and that increased PKG activity inhibits high glucose-stimulated reporter activity (19Wang S. Wu X. Lincoln T.M. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2144-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These data suggest that this 2.033-kilobase promoter region contains important regulatory elements required for PKG-mediated repression of glucose-induced TSP1 gene expression. In the present study we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which PKG mediates repression of glucose-induced TSP1 gene transcription in mesangial cells by using a promoter-deletion approach. We now report identification of a region –932 to –915 relative to the transcription initiation site in the TSP1 promoter (18-bp region) that is a binding site for upstream stimulatory factors (USFs), which are critical for glucose-induced TSP1 transcription. Furthermore, we now show that PKG represses glucose stimulation of TSP1 transcription and TGF-β activity through down-regulation of USF2 protein and DNA binding, implicating USF2 is a significant transcriptional regulator of diabetic complications.

Dominant negative plasmids and control plasmids for MEK and p38 MAPK were obtained from Dr. Lin Mei from the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Cell Culture—Primary rat mesangial cells (RMCs) (passage 3) were a generous gift from Dr. Anne Woods, University of Alabama at Birmingham. As described previously (19Wang S. Wu X. Lincoln T.M. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2144-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), RMCs were stably transfected with pcDNA6/TR and pcDNA4/TO/myc-His C/CD (a construct of the catalytic domain of PKG-Iα). These stable transfectants were labeled as RMCs(tr/cd) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% heat-activated fetal bovine serum, 5 mm d-glucose, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1% (v/v) nonessential amino acids, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 5 ng/ml sodium selenite, 0.6 IU, 1.5 μg/ml blasticidin, and 250 μg/ml zeocin. Serum-free RPMI 1640 media with 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 ng/ml sodium selenite, and 5 mm d-glucose were used to quiescent RMCs(tr/cd). 1 μg/ml tetracycline was used to induce the expression of the catalytic domain of PKG to increase PKG activity. Mink lung epithelial cells (MLECs-clone 32) stably transfected with the TGF-β response element of the human plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 gene promoter fused to firefly luciferase reporter gene were a generous gift from Dr. D. B. Rifkin (New York University Medical Center). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, l-glutamine, and 200 μg/ml G418. TSP1 Promoter-Reporter Constructs—A luciferase reporter plasmid containing the –2033 to +750 region of the human TSP1 gene promoter was generously provided by Dr. Paul Bornstein (University of Washington) and used as a template. Eight deletion mutants of TSP1 (–1172), TSP1 (–1112), TSP1 (–1052), TSP1 (–992), TSP1 (–932), TSP1 (–878), TSP1 (–548), and TSP1 (–330) were prepared using forward primers derived from different 5′ positions (the numbers in parentheses contain KpnI site) of the human TSP1 promoter and the same reverse primer (5′-gctagctgtagcaggaagcacaagag-3′, containing NheI site). The PCR was performed using TSP (–2033/+750) as a template and high fidelity Pfx polymerase from Invitrogen. PCR products were digested with KpnI and NheI and subcloned into a luciferase plasmid PGL 3-Enhancer vector (Promega), and their sequences were confirmed by sequencing. Transfection and Luciferase Assay—RMCs(tr/cd) were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 3×104 cells/ml for 1 day and made quiescent in serum-free RPMI 1640 media with or without tetracycline (1 μg/ml) for 2 days. Then cells were transiently transfected using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) with (1 μg) TSP1 promoter luciferase reporter plasmid. For co-transfection experiments, cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of TSP1 promoter luciferase reporter plasmid as well as different amounts of USF2 expression vector or empty vector (pSG5) (generous gifts from Dr. Michele Sawadogo, the University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center). pRL-SV40 (0.02 μg) (Promega) was used as an internal control. Transfected cells were treated with normal (5 mm) or high (30 mm) glucose for 1 day, and the luciferase activities were assayed using the dual-luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's directions. Nuclear Extract Preparation—RMCs(tr/cd) were cultured in tissue culture dishes with growth media (RPMI 1640 media containing 20% fetal bovine serum). After reaching 80–85% confluence, cells were made quiescent by changing into serum-free RPMI 1640 media for 2 days in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml tetracycline (to induce the expression of catalytic domain of PKG resulting in increased PKG activity) (19Wang S. Wu X. Lincoln T.M. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2144-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and then cultured in serum-free RPMI 1640 media with 5 or 30 mm glucose. After 24 h, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), scraped off the dishes, and spun down. Then nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (35Liu Y. Shi Z. Silveira A. Liu J. Sawadogo M. Yang H. Feng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20603-20611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed for 15 min on ice. Then 32 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added to the suspension and incubated on ice for 10 min. Nuclei were spun down and re-suspended in 100 μl of nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 420 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). The nuclei were incubated with the extraction buffer on ice for 20 min and spun down. The supernatant (nuclear extract) was stored at –80 °C. Protein concentration of nuclear extracts was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Western Blot—For detection of USF1 and USF2, equal amounts of protein in the nuclear extract from RMCs(tr/cd) were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE gel under reducing conditions. After electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membranes and blocking, the membranes were incubated with polyclonal anti-USF1 and anti USF2 antibodies (1:500 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. After intensive washing, secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution) was used for the detection of immunoreactive bands with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein in the conditioned media from RMC-s(tr/cd) were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE gel under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes to detect TSP1 levels by using monoclonal anti TSP1 antibody (antibody 133) as described previously (18Wang S. Shiva S. Poczatek M.H. Darley-Usmar V. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9880-9888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Equal loading and transfer of protein samples were assayed by staining the membranes with Ponceau S. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) and Supershift Assay— Oligonucleotides (oligos) used for EMSA were end-labeled with 32P by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen). 2–5 × 10 4 cpm probe was incubated with 3 μg of nuclear extracts in a 20-μl volume of binding reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 50 ng/ml poly(dI/dC)) on ice for 20 min. In competition experiments, a 50× and/or 100× excess amount of unlabeled competitor was mixed with the labeled probe before being added to the binding mixture. The binding reaction was then allowed to proceed for 20 min on ice. In supershift experiments, 3 μg of control IgG or 3 μg of specific antibodies were incubated with 3 μg of nuclear extracts in a 20-μl volume of binding reaction for 20 min on ice followed by incubation with the labeled probe on ice for an additional 30 min. All binding mixtures were separated by 4–20% gradient Tris-buffered TBE gels (Bio-Rad). The gels were dried and exposed to film. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—To detect the in vivo association of nuclear proteins with the TSP1 promoter, the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was conducted as described by Upstate Biotechnology with some modifications. In brief, primary mesangial cells (p3–6) or stably transfected mesangial cells (RMCs(tr/cd)) were cultured in a 10-cm culture dish. After being made quiescent in serum-free RPMI 1640 media for 2 days, cells were treated with normal glucose (5 mm) or high glucose (30 mm) for 24 h. After treatment, protein-DNA complexes were fixed by 1% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. The fixed cells were washed and lysed in SDS lysis buffer with protease inhibitors and sonicated on ice. After centrifugation at 500 × g for 1 min, one portion of the precleared supernatant was used as DNA input control, and the remaining supernatant was subdivided into aliquots and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with nonimmune rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG; Santa Cruz) or IgG antibodies to USF1 or USF2. The immunoprecipitated complexes of antibody-protein-DNA were collected using a protein A slurry, washed successively with low salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 150 mm NaCl), high salt buffer (same as the low-salt buffer but with 500 mm NaCl), LiCl buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), and Tris-EDTA (pH 8.0), and then eluted with elution buffer (1% SDS, 100 mm NaHCO3). The cross-linking of protein-DNA complexes was reversed by incubation with 5 m NaCl at 65 °C for 4 h, and DNA was digested with 10 mg of proteinase K (Sigma)/ml for 1 h at 45 °C. The DNA was then extracted with phenol-chloroform, and the purified DNA pellet was resuspended in H2O and subjected to PCR amplification with the forward primer, 5′-GTCTGCTCTGTAAATAGCTG-3′, and the reverse primer, 5′-GTGCTTCTTAACGTGACTCC-3′, which were specifically designed from the TSP1 promoter. The 80-bp PCR products were resolved by 3.5% agarose-ethidium bromide gel electrophoresis, visualized by UV. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Point mutations were introduced into the USF binding site (–924 to –919) in the TSP1 promoter reporter construct (–2033/+750) using a QuikChange TM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primers used to mutate the USF binding site are 5′-gactctggagccagagagttctgcaaattctcc-3′ and 5′-ggagaatttgcagaactctctggctccagagtc-3′ (purchased from Qiagen). PCR was performed in a 50-μl volume with Pfu polymerase, 10 ng of DNA template TSP1 (–2033/+750), and 125 ng of each of the primers using the following conditions: 95 °C for 30 s for 1 cycle and 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 12 min for 18 cycles. The PCR products were treated with DpnI (10 units) for 60 min at 37 °C. XL1-blue super-competent cells were transformed with DpnI-treated PCR mixtures as described in the instruction manual and plated on ampicillin plates. Plasmids were prepared from individual colonies and sequenced to confirm the correctness of introduced mutations. TGF-β Assay—Total and active TGF-β levels in the condition media were assayed using the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1/luciferase assay as described previously (18Wang S. Shiva S. Poczatek M.H. Darley-Usmar V. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9880-9888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, mink lung epithelial cells were plated into 24-well tissue culture plates at 1.6 × 105 cells/ml and incubated for 3–4 h for optimal attachment. After aspiration of the growth medium from the attached cells, 500 μl of condition media were added. To measure total TGF-β, conditioned media samples were heat-activated for 3 min at 100 °C. Samples and TGF-β standards were incubated overnight at 37 °C. After incubation, cells were lysed with lysis buffer at room temperature for 20 min. Lysates were analyzed for luciferase activity using a microplate Luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems) after the injection of 100 μl of substrate solution and recorded as relative light units. The mean values of triplicate samples were converted into concentrations of TGF-β (picomolar) using a standard curve obtained with human recombinant TGF-β1. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Statistical evaluation of the data was performed using the paired Student's t test, considering a p value of <0.05 as significant. Glucose-mediated Increases in TSP1 Promoter Activity in RMCs(tr/cd) Are Supported by TSP1 Promoter Region –1172 to –878 —We previously showed that high concentrations of glucose mediate increases in TSP1 expression and TSP1-dependent TGF-β bioactivity through down-modulation of NO-dependent PKG signaling (18Wang S. Shiva S. Poczatek M.H. Darley-Usmar V. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9880-9888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Moreover, we generated stable transfectants expressing the catalytic domain of PKG in mesangial cells using an inducible expression system (tetracycline-induced gene expression (tet-on)). With the expression of the catalytic domain of PKG to increase PKG activity, glucose-induced TSP1 expression was inhibited at the transcriptional level (19Wang S. Wu X. Lincoln T.M. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2144-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To identify the promoter elements that regulate TSP1 gene transcription in mesangial cells in response to high glucose concentrations and increased PKG activity, a series of TSP1 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs was generated (Fig. 1A) and transiently transfected into RMCs(tr/cd). The promoter activity was measured by assaying the luciferase activity as described under “Experimental Procedures” and was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 1B, left panel, the longest construct, TSP (–2033), gave rise to a 2.3-fold increase in TSP1 promoter activity in response to high concentrations of glucose (30 mm). Deletion of a 295-bp region (–1172 to –878) totally abolished high glucose responsiveness, suggesting that this 295-bp region is important for high glucose-induced TSP1 transcription. Increased PKG activity inhibited 30 mm glucose-induced TSP1 promoter activity to basal levels (5 mm glucose) (Fig. 1B, right panel). These data suggest that the region between –1172 and –878 in the TSP1 promoter is involved in PKG-mediated repression of TSP1 transcription under high glucose conditions. Localization of a 55-bp TSP1 Promoter Region (–932 to –878) That Binds glucose-induced Nuclear Proteins and Mediates the Repression of TSP1 Transcription by Increased PKG under High Glucose Conditions—To characterize the cis-acting elements in the 295-bp region (–1172 to –878), first we determined whether the 295-bp region binds any nuclear proteins in response to high glucose. Five overlapping oligonucleotides (Oligo I, II, III, IV, and V) spanning the entire 295-bp TSP1 promoter region were synthesized (Fig. 2A), labeled, and used as probes to perform EMSAs with nuclear extracts from normal or high glucose-treated stably transfected mesangial cells (RMCs(tr/cd)) in the absence or presence of tetracycline (Fig. 2B). Only oligo V gave rise to a major band in the EMSA (lane 1). This band was significantly enhanced by high glucose treatment (lane 2)."
https://openalex.org/W2071776905,"Tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2) is a crucial activation switch that initiates and maintains intracellular calcium mobilization in response to B cell antigen receptor (BCR) engagement. Although members from three distinct families of non-receptor tyrosine kinases can phosphorylate PLCγ in vitro, the specific kinase(s) controlling BCR-dependent PLCγ activation in vivo remains unknown. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk)-deficient human B cells exhibit diminished inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production and calcium signaling despite a normal inducible level of total PLCγ2 tyrosine phosphorylation. This suggested that Btk might modify a critical subset of residues essential for PLCγ2 activity. To evaluate this hypothesis, we generated site-specific phosphotyrosine antibodies recognizing four putative regulatory residues within PLCγ2. Whereas all four sites were rapidly modified in response to BCR engagement in normal B cells, Btk-deficient B cells exhibited a marked reduction in phosphorylation of the Src homology 2 (SH2)-SH3 linker region sites, Tyr753 and Tyr759. Phosphorylation of both sites was restored by expression of Tec, but not Syk, family kinases. In contrast, phosphorylation of the PLCγ2 carboxyl-terminal sites, Tyr1197 and Tyr1217, was unaffected by the absence of functional Btk. Together, these data support a model whereby Btk/Tec kinases control sustained calcium signaling via site-specific phosphorylation of key residues within the PLCγ2 SH2-SH3 linker.

Signals generated by the pre-B and mature B cell receptors are essential for B cell development, activation, and maintenance of mature B cell populations (1Lam K.P. Kuhn R. Rajewsky K. Cell. 1997; 90: 1073-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar).

Together, these events promote a series of downstream signals including a sustained increase in intracellular calcium concentrations. PLCγ is essential for antigen receptor-mediated calcium mobilization (2Coggeshall K.M. McHugh J.C. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Activated PLCγ hydrolyzes its substrate, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, generating the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (5Hempel W.M. Schatzman R.C.

Science. 1990; 250: 1253-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). IP3 acts to open intracellular calcium stores promoting an initial, transient rise in intracellular calcium. Depletion of intracellular calcium stores triggers the opening of plasma membrane store-operated calcium channels (7Parekh A.B. Fleig A. Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), resulting in an influx of extracellular calcium and a secondary, sustained calcium signal. The amplitude and duration of this sustained calcium signal is a key determinant of the specific transcription program initiated in response to antigen receptor engagement (8Berridge M.J.

Chicken B lymphoma cells lacking PLCγ2 are unable to generate IP3 in response to BCR engagement, resulting in the abrogation of receptor-mediated calcium mobilization (11Takata M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Similarly, mice deficient in PLCγ2 have a defective response to BCR engagement and exhibit a block in B cell development (12Hashimoto A. Okada H. Jiang A. Kurosaki M. Greenberg S. Clark E.A.

Despite its crucial role in BCR-dependent calcium mobilization, the molecular events regulating PLCγ2 activity remain incompletely defined. Activation of PLCγ isoforms correlates with an increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation (15Wahl M.I. Daniel T.O. Carpenter G.

Rev. 1994; 138: 105-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Igm++/IgD+ B cells derived from XLA patients exhibit reduced IP3 levels and fail to generate a sustained calcium signal in response to BCR engagement. Reconstitution of XLA B cells with increasing doses of wild type Btk can restore and specifically enhance the sustained calcium signal (21Fluckiger A.C. Li Z. Kato R.M. Wahl M.I. Ochs H.D.

Despite the marked reduction in peak IP3 levels and calcium influx in XLA B cells, BCR-dependent PLCγ2 tyrosine phosphorylation is indistinguishable from that present in normal B cells (21Fluckiger A.C.

Similarly, Btk-deficient murine B-lymphocytes, mast cells, and platelets also exhibit diminished calcium mobilization and phosphoinositide hydrolysis despite normal receptor-mediated PLCγ2 tyrosine phosphorylation (26Forssell J.

One potential explanation for these contrasting observations is that Btk may regulate the sustained calcium signal via phosphorylation of a subset of key tyrosine residues essential for PLCγ2 activity. Recently, two groups identified up to four putative regulatory phosphorylation sites within PLCγ2 using in vitro kinase assays and reconstitution studies (20Rodriguez R. Matsuda M. Perisic O.

Notably, the Tyr753 and Tyr759 PLCγ2 sites appeared analogous in location to defined PLCγ1 SH2-SH3 linker regulatory sites (30Kim H.K. Kim J.W. Zilberstein A. Margolis B. Kim J.G. Schlessinger J.

Reconstitution of PLCγ2-deficient cells with PLCγ2 containing mutations in the SH2-SH3 linker sites alone (20Rodriguez R. Matsuda M. Perisic O. Bravo J. Paul A. Jones N.P. Light Y. Swann K.

Whereas these studies demonstrate a key role for these sites in regulating PLCγ2 functional activity, the kinases responsible for mediating site-specific modification in the context of receptor dependent signaling remain undefined. In the current study, receptor-mediated PLCγ2 activation was directly evaluated within the context of an intact cellular system through the use of antibodies specific for distinct PLCγ2 phosphotyrosyl regulatory residues. Our data demonstrate that at least four regulatory sites are phosphorylated in response to BCR engagement and that phosphorylation of the PLCγ2 SH2-SH3 linker region is entirely dependent upon Btk/Tec family kinases. This specific property provides a coherent explanation for the unique role of Btk/Tec kinases in immuno-receptor dependent sustained calcium signaling. Cells and Reagents—The human B cell lines, WT (LDN-1), XLA-1 (LDX-1) (7Parekh A.B. Fleig A. Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and Ramos were cultured in RPMI 1640 with l-glutamine (CellGro) plus 5% fetal calf serum and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. Total splenocytes were obtained by harvesting whole spleens from age-matched Balb/c and Balb/Xid mice. Splenocytes were prepared by mechanical disruption followed by depletion of erythrocytes by lysis with ammonium chloride solution and resuspension in serum-free RPMI plus supplement. Antibody reagents included F(ab′)2 goat anti-human IgM Fc5μ-specific and F(ab′)2 goat anti-murine IgM μ chain-specific (Jackson Laboratories); rabbit anti-murine Btk (31Wahl M.I. Fluckiger A.C.

A. 1997; 94: 11526-11533Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar); anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10, anti-Itk, anti-Tec, and anti-Zap-70 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); anti-PLCγ2 (Q20), anti-PLCγ1 (1249), and anti-Syk (C-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody PY20 (BD Biosciences); and anti-P-Y783-PLCγ1 (BIOSOURCE International). For analysis by flow cytometry, primary splenocytes were surface-stained by incubating cells with anti-B220 (CD45R), R-Phycoerythrin (1:200), and anti-IgM fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:100) (Pharmingen) at 4 °C for 20 min. WT and XLA-1 human B cells were surface-stained with human anti-IgM fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:100) (Southern Bio-technology). Data were collected on a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with CELLQuest software (BD Biosciences). Cell Stimulation, Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—Prior to stimulation, B cells were incubated in serum-free RPMI plus glutamine for 45 min at 37 °C. 1 × 107 cells were then stimulated with either pervanadate (150 μm) or human- or murine-specific IgM F(ab′)2 antibodies (10 μg/ml) for the indicated times. Pervanadate was prepared as previously described (32Wienands J. Larbolette O. Reth M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7865-7870Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed for 10 min on ice in a lysis buffer consisting of 200 mm boric acid, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate plus protease inhibitors leupeptin and aprotinin (10 μg/ml each) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm). Cellular debris was spun down at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min, and cleared lysates were used as whole cell lysate or for immunoprecipitation. PLCγ2 was immunoprecipitated from cells stimulated with pervanadate due to increased stability and efficiency of detection of specifically phosphorylated PLCγ2. In contrast, site-specific phosphorylation was more reliably detected via analysis of whole cell lysate from IgM-stimulated primary and transformed B cells. PLCγ2 was immunoprecipitated by using 2 μg of anti-PLCγ2 antibody (Q-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. All samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Pervanadate studies represent 5 × 105 cell equivalents/lane, whereas IgM studies represent 5 × 106 cell equivalents/lane. Western blot analysis was performed using standard procedures as previously described (21Fluckiger A.C. Li Z. Kato R.M. Wahl M.I. Ochs H.D. Longnecker R. Kinet J.P. Witte O.N. Scharenberg A.M. Rawlings D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1973-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). ECL was used for antibody detection according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Generation of Phosphospecific Antibodies and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—PLCγ2 Tyr753, Tyr759, Tyr1197, and Tyr1217 phosphospecific antibodies were generated by inoculating rabbits with 100 μg of phosphopeptide conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as immunogen with Freund's complete adjuvant. Phosphopeptide sequences used were as follows: PLCγ2 Tyr753 and Tyr759 (see Fig. 2), Tyr1197 (PVLESEEELpYSSCRQLRRRQ, where pY represents phosphotyrosine), and Tyr1217 (CELNNQLFLpYDTHQNLRNAN). Initial injection was followed by four booster injections every 2–3 weeks in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. To obtain affinity-purified antibodies, sera were first absorbed to a nonphosphorylated peptide column. Column flow-through was then run over a phosphopeptide column to isolate phosphospecific antibodies for use in our assays (31Wahl M.I. Fluckiger A.C. Kato R.M. Park H. Witte O.N. Rawlings D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11526-11533Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To evaluate antibody reactivity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, microtiter wells were coated with nonphosphorylated or phosphorylated peptide species. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Generation of Recombinant Vaccinia Virus—Mutagenesis of full-length human PLCγ2 cDNA was carried out in the pBlueScript (pBS) vector using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Primers were designed in which a single nucleotide change resulted in a single amino acid change (tyrosine to phenylalanine). The Y753F/Y759F double mutant was generated by sequential mutagenesis. Mutagenized constructs were digested and purified for cloning into the pSC66 vaccinia virus vector. Sequence analysis of pBS and pSC66 PLCγ2 WT and mutant constructs was performed to verify each mutation. Recombinant vaccinia virus expressing WT or mutant human PLCγ2 was generated as previously described (33Rawlings D.J. Scharenberg A.M. Park H. Wahl M.I. Lin S. Kato R.M. Fluckiger A.C. Witte O.N. Kinet J.P. Science. 1996; 271: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Preparation of Recombinant Human PLCγ2—Full-length PLCγ2 was expressed in bacteria using the pCAL expression and purification system. Briefly, Escherichia coli BL21 were transformed with WT or mutant pCAL-PLCγ2 expression constructs. Transformed bacteria were grown at room temperature with constant agitation until reaching an optical density at 550 nm of 0.8–1.0. PLCγ2 expression was induced by the addition of a 0.1 mm concentration of “the inducer” (Molecular Research Laboratories, LLC). Bacteria were harvested, and recombinant PLCγ2 was purified using a calmodulin column as previously described (19Ozdener F. Dangelmaier C. Ashby B. Kunapuli S.P. Daniel J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 3: 672-679Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). PLCγ2 in Vitro IP3 Assay for Activity—Recombinant purified WT or mutant PLCγ2 was added to a reaction mixture containing 200 μm3H-labeled phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (25,000 dpm), 35 mm NaH2 PO4 (pH 6.8), 70 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.6 mm CaCl2 in the presence of recombinant, purified Lck (purified recombinant human Gst-Lck provided by Alexander Y. Tsygankov, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA). ATP (25 μm final concentration) was added to selected reactions, and mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C. Reactions were stopped by transferring mixtures to an ice bath and adding 0.5 ml of chloroform/methanol/HCl (100:100:0.6) followed by 150 μl of 1 n HCl with 5 mm EDTA. Aqueous and organic phases were separated by centrifugation, and a portion of the upper aqueous phase (200 μl) was removed for liquid scintillation counting. All experiments were performed in triplicate. PLCγ2 in Vitro Kinase Assay—NIH-3T3 cells (5 × 106) were infected with vaccinia virus expressing recombinant wild type or mutant PLCγ2 at an MOI of 10 for 12 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested, and whole cell lysates were prepared as previously described under “Experimental Procedures.” PLCγ2 was immunoprecipitated by using 2 μg of anti-PLCγ2 antibody (Q-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 2 h. Sepharose beads were then incubated in a reaction mixture containing 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.4 mm EDTA, and 0.4 mm Na3VO4 in the presence or absence of 0.25 μg of active Lck kinase (Upstate Biotechnology) for 10 min at 30 °C. All other reagents including enzyme dilution buffer and magnesium/ATP mixture were prepared per the manufacturer's instructions. Reactions were stopped by adding SDS sample buffer and boiling samples for 10 min. Alternatively, recombinant PLCγ2 was incubated with 0.25 μg of active Lck in the presence or absence of 25 μm ATP in a kinase buffer (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 5 mm MnCl2, 5mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol) at 24 °C for 5 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer and boiling. Calcium Mobilization Assays—A20 B cells (5 × 106) were loaded with 1 mm indo-1 acetoxymethylester (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C in loading medium (RPMI, 2% fetal calf serum, 10 mm HEPES). Indo-1 acetoxymethylester-loaded cells were washed and resuspended in a buffer of Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS (Sigma) with calcium) plus 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, prior to analysis. Cells were stimulated with either 10 μg/ml anti-human IgM (Jackson Laboratories), 10 μg/ml anti-murine IgG (Jackson Laboratories), or 150 μm pervanadate and monitored for 3 min followed by the addition ionomycin (1 μm) as a positive control. Intracellular calcium was measured using a bulk spectofluorimeter (Photon Technology International) and calculated as a ratio of 400/488-nm emission following 350-nm excitation. Data were analyzed with FELIX software (Photon Technology International). Total Tyrosine Phosphorylation of PLCγ2 Is Not Indicative of Its Signaling Function in XLA B Cells—To determine the role of Btk in PLCγ2 activation, we compared the calcium response of WT and XLA-1 human B cell lines (21Fluckiger A.C. Li Z. Kato R.M. Wahl M.I. Ochs H.D. Longnecker R. Kinet J.P. Witte O.N. Scharenberg A.M. Rawlings D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1973-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) stimulated with anti-IgM or the protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, pervanadate. Consistent with our previously published data, XLA-1 B cells exhibited reduced calcium mobilization in response to IgM engagement (Fig. 1A) Signaling via pervanadate requires the presence of a functional BCR transducer complex and promotes phosphorylation, recruitment, and activation of BCR-associated molecules (32Wienands J. Larbolette O. Reth M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7865-7870Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 34Wienands J. Schweikert J. Wollscheid B. Jumaa H. Nielsen P.J. Reth M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Pervanadate, however, represents a more potent mimic of BCR engagement due to irreversible oxidation of key cysteine residues on protein-tyrosine phosphatases, generating a more sustained phosphotyrosine signal (35Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Notably, despite the ability of pervanadate to produce a marked enhancement in the phosphotyrosine signal of total cellular proteins compared with anti-IgM (Fig. 1C), these events were not sufficient to rescue the calcium signaling defect in Btk-deficient cells (Fig. 1B). Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 is commonly used as a measure of its activation status. We compared the total PLCγ2 phosphotyrosine signal in IgM or pervanadate-stimulated WT and Btk-deficient B cells. Consistent with previous results (21Fluckiger A.C. Li Z. Kato R.M. Wahl M.I. Ochs H.D. Longnecker R. Kinet J.P. Witte O.N. Scharenberg A.M. Rawlings D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1973-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 in response to BCR engagement (as assessed by the panspecific anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10) was indistinguishable between XLA-1 and WT B cells (Fig. 1D). Similarly, stimulation with pervanadate resulted in equivalent levels of PLCγ2 tyrosine phosphorylation in XLA-1 and WT B cells, and no significant differences were observed over an extended activation time course (Fig. 1E and data not shown). Similar results were obtained using an alternative, panspecific anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) and in studies using an independently derived XLA B cell line (data not shown). Thus, whereas the reduction in BCR-dependent IP3 production and calcium flux in Btk-deficient B cells clearly suggests a defect in the PLCγ2 pathway, these events do not correlate with the phosphotyrosine content of PLCγ2 as measured by conventional anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Generation of Site-specific Antibodies to Candidate Regulatory PLCγ2 Phosphorylation Sites—One explanation for these data is that Btk regulates PLCγ2 activity via phosphorylation of a subset of tyrosine residues and that a loss of these specific phosphorylation events is not readily detectable using antibodies that recognize global tyrosine phosphorylation. Initial attempts to identify PLCγ2 regulatory sites by mass spectrometry were problematic due to low stoichiometric concentrations and the generation of multiple phosphopeptide fragments. Other groups have reported similar difficulties using this technique (20Rodriguez R. Matsuda M. Perisic O. Bravo J. Paul A. Jones N.P. Light Y. Swann K. Williams R.L. Katan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47982-47992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We therefore chose to evaluate site-specific phosphorylation using phosphospecific antibodies generated against individual candidate sites. Potential phosphorylation sites were initially identified by comparing PLCγ2 with the better characterized, ubiquitously expressed PLCγ isoform, PLCγ1 (Fig. 2A). PLCγ1 contains three regulatory tyrosines: Tyr771 and Tyr783 within its SH2-SH3 linker region and Tyr1254 at the carboxyl terminus. These sites are inducibly phosphorylated in response to stimulation by growth factors (36Kim J.W. Sim S.S. Kim U.H. Nishibe S. Wahl M.I. Carpenter G. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

A. 1991; 88: 5453-5456Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and mutation of any one of these residues leads to dysregulated phospholipase activity (30Kim H.K. Kim J.W. Zilberstein A. Margolis B. Kim J.G. Schlessinger J. Rhee S.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 435-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Specifically, mutation of Tyr783 (to Phe) results in the complete abrogation of PLCγ1 function in fibroblasts and in reconstituted PLCγ1-deficient Jurkat T cells (30Kim H.K. Kim J.W. Zilberstein A.

Although the PLCγ isoforms share a similar domain structure, they share only ∼60% overall amino acid sequence homology, including less than 30% homology within the SH2-SH3 linker. Comparison with PLCγ1 revealed three potential, similarly located, residues within the SH2-SH3 linker, including Tyr743, Tyr753, and Tyr759 (Fig. 2B); however, there was no distinct homology at the carboxyl terminus.

SR proteins are dynamically phosphorylated in their RS domain, and differential phosphorylation modulates their splicing activity and subcellular localization. In this study, we investigated the influence of phosphorylation on the function of SR proteins in events occurring during mRNA maturation. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the mRNA export receptor TAP associates preferentially with the hypophosphorylated form of shuttling SR proteins, including ASF/SF2. Overexpression of ASF induced subnuclear relocalization of TAP to SR protein-enriched nuclear speckles, suggesting their interaction in vivo. Moreover, the ASF found in a nucleoplasmic fraction rich in heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) complexes is hyperphosphorylated, whereas mature messenger RNP (mRNP)-bound ASF is hypophosphorylated. Therefore, hypophosphorylation of ASF in mRNPs coincides with its higher affinity for TAP, suggesting that dephosphorylation of ASF promotes both its incorporation into mRNPs and recruitment of TAP for mRNA export. Thus, the phosphorylation state of RS domains may modulate the function of mammalian shuttling SR proteins during mRNA maturation or export.

Thus, the phosphorylation state of RS domains may modulate the function of mammalian shuttling SR proteins during mRNA maturation or export. Eukaryotic mRNAs are synthesized and processed in the nucleus and subsequently exported to the cytoplasm for protein translation. Nuclear export of mRNA is generally mediated by a pathway that is largely distinct from those used to export non-coding RNAs such as tRNAs, rRNAs, and small nuclear RNAs (1Cullen B.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 587-597Google Scholar). During transcription, mRNAs are packaged into complexes with various heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs). 1The abbreviations used are: hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; mRNP, messenger RNP; pre-mRNA, precursor mRNA; CTE, constitutive transport element; EJC, exon junction complex; SR protein, serine/arginine-rich protein; RT, reverse transcription; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 1The abbreviations used are: hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; mRNP, messenger RNP; pre-mRNA, precursor mRNA; CTE, constitutive transport element; EJC, exon junction complex; SR protein, serine/arginine-rich protein; RT, reverse transcription; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase. Some of the hnRNP proteins may participate in precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing or mRNA export/localization (2Dreyfuss G. Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 195-205Google Scholar, 3Reed R. Magni K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E201-E204Google Scholar). Upon completion of mRNA processing, export factors join and accompany messenger RNPs (mRNPs) for subsequent exit from the nucleus (1Cullen B.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 587-597Google Scholar, 2Dreyfuss G. Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 195-205Google Scholar, 3Reed R. Magni K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E201-E204Google Scholar).The most thoroughly characterized mRNA export receptor is TAP, which interacts directly with the nuclear pore complex (4Stutz F. Izaurralde E. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 319-327Google Scholar). Evidence implicating TAP in mRNA export initially came from a study of nuclear export of unspliced simian type D retroviral mRNAs that contain the constitutive transport element (CTE) (5Gruter P. Tabernero C. von Kobbe C. Schmitt C. Saavedra C. Bachi A. Wilm M. Felber B.K. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 649-659Google Scholar). TAP promotes the nuclear export of CTE-bearing RNAs via direct binding to the CTE (5Gruter P. Tabernero C. von Kobbe C. Schmitt C. Saavedra C. Bachi A. Wilm M. Felber B.K. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 649-659Google Scholar). Microinjection of excess CTE-containing RNAs into Xenopus oocytes blocks nuclear export of cellular mRNAs; this blockade can be rescued by injection of recombinant TAP (5Gruter P.

Ribbeck K. von Kobbe C. Kutay U. Wilm M. Gorlich D. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. RNA. 2000; 6: 136-158Google Scholar). Depletion of endogenous TAP from cultured Drosophila cells results in a robust accumulation of poly(A)+ RNAs within the nucleus, suggesting an essential role for TAP in mRNA export (7Herold A. Klymenko T. Izaurralde E. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1768-1780Google Scholar). Yeast Mex67p, an ortholog of mammalian TAP, is also involved in bulk poly(A)+ RNA export (8Segref A. Sharma K. Doye V. Hellwig A. Huber J. Luhrmann R. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3256-3271Google Scholar), indicating that TAP has a conserved role as a general mRNA export factor. TAP interacts with p15, a protein related to nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF-2); formation of the TAP/p15 heterodimer is required for efficient nuclear pore complex binding and significantly enhances the ability of TAP to export mRNAs from the nucleus (4Stutz F. Izaurralde E. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 319-327Google Scholar). TAP-mediated cellular mRNA export requires various adaptor proteins that associate with TAP and mRNP cargoes (2Dreyfuss G. Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 195-205Google Scholar, 3Reed R. Magni K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E201-E204Google Scholar, 4Stutz F. Izaurralde E. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 319-327Google Scholar).In metazoan cells, the majority of primary transcripts undergo splicing to become mature mRNAs. Experiments with Xenopus oocytes earlier demonstrated a role for splicing in facilitating mRNA export (9Luo M.J. Reed R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14937-14942Google Scholar). Intron removal results in deposition of a mRNP complex, termed the exon junction complex (EJC), at a region immediately upstream of the splice junctions of the mature mRNA (10Tange T.O. Nott A. Moore M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 279-284Google Scholar). Several of the EJC components shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm and interact directly with TAP (2Dreyfuss G. Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 195-205Google Scholar). The EJC factor REF is possibly recruited to spliced mRNAs by UAP56, a putative RNA helicase involved in early spliceosome formation (4Stutz F. Izaurralde E. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 319-327Google Scholar). These observations support a direct coupling of pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA export. However, splicing dependence of mRNA export is argued by recent demonstrations that depletion of individual EJC components had no profound effect on bulk mRNA export (11Gatfield D. Izaurralde E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 579-588Google Scholar) and that splicing only modestly enhanced nuclear mRNA export in metazoan cells (12Nott A. Meislin S.H. Moore M.J. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 607-617Google Scholar, 13Lu S. Cullen B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 618-630Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the EJC may still function in assembly or maturation of export-competent mRNPs (2Dreyfuss G. Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 195-205Google Scholar, 3Reed R. Magni K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E201-E204Google Scholar).SR proteins are a family of serine/arginine dipeptide-rich proteins involved in both constitutive and regulated pre-mRNA splicing (14Graveley B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1197-1211Google Scholar). Some of the SR protein family members shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, suggesting their role in mRNA export (15Caceres J.F. Screaton G.R. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 55-66Google Scholar). A recent finding shows that the shuttling SR proteins 9G8 and SRp20 interact directly with TAP to promote the nuclear export of mRNA (16Huang Y. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 899-905Google Scholar, 17Huang Y. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 837-843Google Scholar). The yeast RNA-binding protein Npl3p, a close relative of metazoan SR proteins, is also involved in mRNA export (18Izaurralde E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 210-212Google Scholar). Npl3p is phosphorylated by the cytoplasmic SR protein kinase Sky1p (19Gilbert W. Siebel C.W. Guthrie C. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 302-313Google Scholar). Npl3p accumulates in the cytoplasm and remains bound to poly(A)+ RNA in sky1 mutants, suggesting that phosphorylation of Npl3p promotes either its dissociation from exported mRNPs or its nuclear re-import (19Gilbert W. Siebel C.W. Guthrie C. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 302-313Google Scholar). Analogously, cellular localization of mammalian SR proteins is regulated through phosphorylation of their RS domains (14Graveley B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1197-1211Google Scholar). RS domain phosphorylation differentially influences the interaction of SR proteins with their import receptors and thereby modulates their nuclear import (20Lai M.C. Lin R.I. Tarn W.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10154-10159Google Scholar, 21Yun C.Y. Velazquez-Dones A.L. Lyman S.K. Fu X.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18050-18055Google Scholar). Nevertheless, whether phosphorylation also regulates nuclear export of SR proteins remains an unanswered question.In this report, we provide evidence that hypophosphorylated ASF, a shuttling SR protein, binds TAP and associates with mature mRNPs. Thus, dephosphorylation of SR proteins is possibly critical for their nuclear export or post-splicing functions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction—The cDNA of human TAP (NXF1) (kindly provided by J. A. Steitz, Yale University) was inserted into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), yielding an expression vector for the C-terminally FLAG-tagged TAP. The cDNAs of 9G8, ASF, and SC35 were obtained by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using HeLa cell RNAs as template, and each was then inserted into pCEP4 (Invitrogen) to generate the constructs encoding C-terminally HA-tagged SR proteins. Plasmid pEGFP-ASF was constructed by subcloning the ASF cDNA fragment into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech).Cell Culture and Transfection—Human HeLa or 293 cells were cultured and transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) as described previously (22Lai M.C. Lin R.I. Huang S.Y. Tsai C.W. Tarn W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7950-7957Google Scholar). To establish FLAG-TAP-expressing cell lines, 293 cells were transfected with the FLAG-TAP expression vector and cultured in the presence of 300 μg/ml G418 (Clontech) for 2 weeks. Resistant colonies were picked and selection with G418 continued for an additional 2 weeks. The surviving cells were screened for stable expression of FLAG-TAP using Western blotting.Immunoprecipitation—FLAG-TAP was co-expressed with one of the HA-tagged SR proteins (9G8, ASF, or SC35) in 293 cells for 2 days. The cell lysates were prepared and treated with RNase A according to Lykke-Andersen et al. (23Lykke-Andersen J. Shu M.D. Steitz J.A. Science. 2001; 293: 1836-1839Google Scholar). The lysates of ∼1 × 107 cells in 0.5 ml were incubated with 20 μl of anti-FLAG-coupled agarose (M2; Sigma) for immunoprecipitation. The precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with monoclonal anti-HA antibody (a gift from S.-C. Cheng, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan). In vitro phosphorylation of the precipitated proteins was performed using 50 ng of recombinant GST-SRPK1 in a 20-μl reaction as described (22Lai M.C. Lin R.I. Huang S.Y. Tsai C.W. Tarn W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7950-7957Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of cell lysate proteins was performed in a 20-μl reaction containing 5 μl of the lysate, 40 units of alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) or 800 U of λ protein phosphatase (BioLabs) at 30 °C for 45 min.In Vitro Pull-down Assay—Recombinant GST-ASF was prepared and phosphorylated by GST-SRPK1 in vitro as described (22Lai M.C. Lin R.I. Huang S.Y. Tsai C.W. Tarn W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7950-7957Google Scholar); ATP was omitted in the mock-phosphorylation reaction. For the pull-down experiments, FLAG-TAP was obtained from stably expressing 293 cells (see above) and used as bait. The FLAG-TAP-containing lysate (1 ml) was prepared (23Lykke-Andersen J. Shu M.D. Steitz J.A. Science. 2001; 293: 1836-1839Google Scholar) from ∼2 × 107 cells and then incubated with 20 μl of anti-FLAG-coupled agarose (M2; Sigma). After extensive washing with NET-2 buffer (23Lykke-Andersen J. Shu M.D. Steitz J.A. Science. 2001; 293: 1836-1839Google Scholar), FLAG-TAP-bound beads were incubated with 1 μg of phosphorylated or mock-treated GST-ASF at 4 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the beads were washed with NET-2 buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-GST antibody (Upstate Biotechnology).Subcellular Fractionation—Fractionation was performed essentially as described by Mili et al. (24Mili S. Shu H.J. Zhao Y. Pinol-Roma S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7307-7319Google Scholar). Approximately 2 × 107 of mock- or pCEP4-HA-ASF-transfected 293 cells were collected in 1 ml of RSB-100 buffer (24Mili S. Shu H.J. Zhao Y. Pinol-Roma S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7307-7319Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in RSB-100 containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm KF and 5 mm β-glycerophosphate). Following incubation on ice for 10 min, the suspension was subjected to centrifugation (24Mili S. Shu H.J. Zhao Y. Pinol-Roma S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7307-7319Google Scholar). The Triton X-100-solubilized supernatant was collected, and the pellet was resuspended in the same buffer and sonicated twice by 5-s bursts. The sonicated material was incubated on ice for 10 min followed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was collected as the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. To immunoprecipitate RNPs, we used 25 μl of anti-hnRNP A1 serum (a gift from C.-W. Wu, National Health Research Institutes, Taipei, Taiwan) or 10 μg of polyclonal anti-HA antibodies (Babco). Immunoprecipitation was performed essentially as above except that the wash buffer was RSB-100 containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40.For RT-PCR analysis, the primers used to amplify β-actin pre-mRNAs were in intron 2 (forward) and exon 3 (reverse), and those for mRNAs were in exon 2 (forward) and exon 5 (reverse) (24Mili S. Shu H.J. Zhao Y. Pinol-Roma S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7307-7319Google Scholar). To examine histone H2a mRNA, RT was performed using 5′-CTTTTTATCAATGACAACCTTAAG-3′ as primer and PCR using primers 5′-ATGTCTGGACGAGGGAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACTTGCTTTGGGCTTTATGG-3′ (reverse). Although the soluble fraction contained ∼20 times more RNA than the insoluble fraction, equal amounts of total RNAs from each fraction were subjected to RT-PCR analysis.Indirect Immunofluorescence—The pcDNA-FLAG-TAP vector was transfected alone or with pEGFP-ASF into HeLa cells for 40 h. Indirect immunofluorescence staining was performed as described previously (22Lai M.C. Lin R.I. Huang S.Y. Tsai C.W. Tarn W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7950-7957Google Scholar). After fixation, the cells were stained with monoclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma) followed by rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Cappel Laboratories). The specimens were examined using a laser confocal microscope (MRC1000; Bio-Rad).RESULTSTAP Associates with Hypophosphorylated ASF—We initially investigated whether the phosphorylation state of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling SR proteins affects their interaction with the mRNA export receptor TAP. HA-tagged SR protein 9G8, ASF, or SC35 was co-expressed with FLAG-tagged TAP in human 293 cells; 9G8 and ASF are shuttling proteins whereas SC35 is restricted to the nucleus (15Caceres J.F. Screaton G.R. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 55-66Google Scholar). The cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of RNase A. Detection of transiently expressed SR proteins revealed the direct interaction of FLAG-TAP with the two shuttling SR proteins (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–4), consistent with a previous report (17Huang Y. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 837-843Google Scholar). In contrast, SC35 did not co-precipitate with FLAG-TAP (lanes 5 and 6). However, immunoprecipitated 9G8 and ASF showed higher electrophoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE than the corresponding lysate proteins (lanes 1–4, compare IP to input). Since ASF co-precipitated most efficiently (Fig. 1A), and its association with TAP was also observed by mass spectrometric analysis of TAP-interacting proteins (data not shown), we next examined whether the faster migrating ASF corresponds to a dephosphorylated form.To completely remove the phosphate groups of ASF, an HA-tagged ASF-containing cell lysate was treated with λ protein phosphatase or alkaline phosphatase. Phosphatase-treated ASF (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3) migrated slightly further than TAP-associated ASF (lane 4) and the faster migrating ASF in the mock-treated lysate (lane 1). Moreover, in vitro phosphorylation of the TAP co-precipitates using recombinant SRPK1 yielded the slower migrating ASF (Fig. 1C, lane 3). This result suggests that the RS domain within TAP-associated ASF is partially dephosphorylated and also excludes the possibility that faster migration of ASF results from proteolysis. Since phosphatase inhibitors had been included in the lysates, hypophosphorylated ASF should not be a result of dephosphorylation that occurred during the course of immunoprecipitation.We next used recombinant ASF in pull-down experiments to examine whether its phosphorylation state influences the interaction with TAP in vitro. To obtain the TAP protein bait, the lysate of FLAG-TAP-expressing 293 cells was subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG antibody. Immunoprecipitated FLAG-TAP was immobilized on agarose and then incubated with unphosphorylated or SRPK1-phosphorylated GST-ASF. Phosphorylated GST-ASF was assessed by its slower migration on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, lane 3). The pull-down data showed that only non-phosphorylated ASF bound to FLAG-TAP (lane 5), consistent with the above observation that hypophosphorylated ASF preferentially associates with TAP.Fig. 2Hypophosphorylated ASF interacts with TAP in vitro. FLAG-tagged TAP was ectopically expressed in 293 cells and immunoprecipitated from the lysate using anti-FLAG M2-agarose. M2-agarose-bound FLAG-TAP was then incubated with recombinant GST (lane 4) or GST-ASF that was prephosphorylated with SRPK1 in the absence (lane 5) or presence (lane 6) of ATP. FLAG-TAP bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-GST antibody. Lanes 1–3 show 5% of the recombinant proteins used in the pull-down experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)A previous report showed that the N-terminal RRM-containing domain of ASF is sufficient for its interaction with TAP (17Huang Y. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 837-843Google Scholar). However, the possibility that the RS domain modulates the conformation or binding property of the RRMs still remains and requires further investigation.TAP Relocalizes within the Nucleus upon Overexpression of ASF—TAP localizes primarily to the nucleoplasm and is also associated with the nuclear pore complex (6Bachi A. Braun I.C. Rodrigues J.P. Pante N. Ribbeck K. von Kobbe C. Kutay U. Wilm M. Gorlich D. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. RNA. 2000; 6: 136-158Google Scholar). Transiently expressed FLAG-TAP distributed in a manner similar to that of endogenous TAP (Fig. 3, panels a and b). TAP interacts with several shuttling SR proteins and EJC components (2Dreyfuss G. Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 195-205Google Scholar, 3Reed R. Magni K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E201-E204Google Scholar, 4Stutz F. Izaurralde E. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 319-327Google Scholar), most of which preferentially localize to nuclear speckles. Therefore, the majority of TAP appears not to co-localize with its interacting partners. We therefore tested whether TAP would relocate in the presence of overexpressed ASF in HeLa cells. Indirect immunofluorescence showed that co-expression of GFP-ASF causes a fraction of FLAG-TAP accumulation in nuclear speckles (Fig. 3, panels c–f). FLAG-TAP did not relocalize when GFP or GFP fused to RBM4, another splicing regulatory factor, was co-expressed (data not shown). Since hypophosphorylated SR proteins display a prominent speckle pattern (25Misteli T. Spector D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1559-1572Google Scholar), our observation may reflect the interaction of TAP with a pool of hypophosphorylated ASF in cells.Fig. 3TAP relocalizes upon overexpression of ASF. The vector encoding FLAG-tagged TAP was transfected alone (panels a and b) or co-transfected (panels c–f) with the GFP-ASF expression vector in HeLa cells. Indirect immunostaining was performed with anti-FLAG antibody (panels a and c). Panel e shows a merged image of immunostaining (c) and fluorescent fusion protein (d).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Hypophosphorylated ASF Associates with Mature mRNPs— TAP is associated with mRNP complexes after splicing, whereas ASF likely joins mRNPs prior to splicing and remains bound to spliced mRNAs (3Reed R. Magni K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E201-E204Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the phosphorylation state of ASF changes during mRNP maturation. Various mRNPs, including cytoplasmic mRNPs, diffusible nuclear mRNPs, and nucleoplasmic chromatin-bound hnRNPs, can be isolated when cells are fractionated with detergents (24Mili S. Shu H.J. Zhao Y. Pinol-Roma S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7307-7319Google Scholar). Hence, we extracted 293 cells initially with Triton X-100 to yield a soluble fraction. The remaining cell debris was disrupted by sonication, and the resulting supernatant was termed the Triton-insoluble fraction. To assess the mRNP species in the subcellular fractions, we used RT-PCR analysis to examine representative β-actin transcripts (pre-mRNA and mature mRNA) in each fraction. Spliced β-actin mRNA was detected in both Triton-soluble and -insoluble factions, but intron-containing pre-mRNA was mainly present in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 4A, lanes 1–4). We therefore concluded that the Triton-soluble fraction was likely rich in both cytoplasmic and nuclear mature mRNPs, whereas the insoluble fraction contained nucleoplasmic hnRNPs, essentially consistent with a previous report (24Mili S. Shu H.J. Zhao Y. Pinol-Roma S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7307-7319Google Scholar).Fig. 4ASF is hypophosphorylated in Triton X-100-solubilized mRNPs in vivo. A, 293 cells were fractionated into Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions. RT-PCR analysis was performed with total RNA of each fraction to detect β-actin transcripts as described (24Mili S. Shu H.J. Zhao Y. Pinol-Roma S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7307-7319Google Scholar). B, fractionation of the 293 cells that transiently expressed HA-ASF was as described for A. Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-hnRNP A1 (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) or anti-HA (lanes 3 and 7) antibodies; the precipitates were further treated with RNase A (lanes 4 and 8). Western blotting was performed with anti-HA. Lanes 1 and 5 show 0.1% of the fractions used for immunoprecipitation. kD, kilodalton. C, the Triton-soluble fraction was prepared from mock (lane 2) or HA-ASF-expressing (lane 3) 293 cells and then subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-HA antibody. Total (lane 1) or co-immunoprecipitated RNAs (lanes 2 and 3) were analyzed by RT-PCR using primers specific to spliced β-actin mRNA (upper panel) or to histone H2a mRNA (lower panel). A and C, size markers are indicated in kilobases (k).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The hnRNP A1 protein is associated with specific sets of hnRNP proteins and/or mRNA export factors in different mRNP complexes (24Mili S. Shu H.J. Zhao Y. Pinol-Roma S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7307-7319Google Scholar). As reported previously (24Mili S. Shu H.J. Zhao Y. Pinol-Roma S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7307-7319Google Scholar), both precursor and mature β-actin mRNAs were co-immunopurified with hnRNP A1 (data not shown). We next examined whether ASF is present in hnRNP A1-containing RNP complexes. Subcellular fractions prepared from the cells that transiently expressed HA-tagged ASF were immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody, and HA-ASF was detected in both Triton-soluble and -insoluble factions (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 5). Immunoprecipitation of each faction with polyclonal anti-hnRNP A1 antibodies revealed that ASF associates with hnRNP A1-containing complexes (lanes 2 and 6) in an RNA-dependent manner (lanes 4 and 8). Of particular interest was that ASF bound to hnRNP A1-containing soluble mRNPs showed higher electrophoretic mobility (compare lane 2 with lanes 1 and 3). In contrast, ASF detected in nucleoplasmic hnRNPs had a phosphorylation level similar to that of the major pool of ASF (lanes 5–7). Therefore, it is likely that cytoplasmic and nuclear diffusible mRNPs contain mainly hypophosphorylated ASF. Moreover, these results imply that hyperphosphorylated ASF is recruited to pre-mRNAs and that ASF becomes dephosphorylated upon conversion of the pre-mRNA-containing complexes into mRNPs.We finally examined whether ASF associates with mature mRNAs in the Triton soluble fraction. Cell lysate containing HA-tagged ASF or mock lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-HA antibody, and RNAs extracted from the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by RT-PCR. Spliced β-actin mRNA was associated with HA-ASF but was not detected in the mock precipitates (Fig. 4C, upper panel). Since SR proteins also bind intronless mRNAs (17Huang Y. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 837-843Google Scholar), RT-PCR was therefore performed to examine the presence of intronless histone H2a mRNA in the immunoprecipitates containing HA-ASF. The data showed that HA-ASF associates with histone H2a mRNA in the mRNP-enriched fraction (Fig. 4C, lower panel), suggesting that recruitment of ASF to mRNPs can also be independent of splicing.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we demonstrate that hypophosphorylated ASF associates with the mRNA export receptor TAP and mature mRNPs. ASF functions in early spliceosome assembly and may act as an adaptor for mRNA export (14Graveley B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1197-1211Google Scholar, 16Huang Y. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 899-905Google Scholar, 17Huang Y. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 837-843Google Scholar). RS domain phosphorylation likely modulates the activity of ASF in different steps during mRNA biogenesis.SR proteins are extensively phosphorylated in their RS domain, and dynamic phosphorylation of SR proteins is integral to their function in pre-mRNA splicing. Reversible phosphorylation of SR proteins is likely important for the assembly and function of the spliceosome (14Graveley B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1197-1211Google Scholar), and inappropriate phosphorylation may perturb splicing (26Prasad J. Colwill K. Pawson T. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6991-6999Google Scholar). Moreover, the phosphorylation level of SR proteins profoundly affects their subcellular localization (27Lamond A.I. Spector D.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 605-612Google Scholar). Importantly, phosphorylation of the RS domain is required for recruitment of SR proteins to sites undergoing transcription (28Misteli T. Caceres J.F. Clement J.Q. Krainer A.R. Wilkinson M.F. Spector D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 297-307Google Scholar). Thus, our observation that the phosphorylation level of ASF is higher in pre-mRNA-rich hnRNPs (Fig. 4) may coincide with its co-transcriptional activity in splicing. Moreover, splicing-independent recruitment of ASF to intronless mRNAs may also occur via a transcription-coupled process. Dephosphorylation of ASF probably takes place during or at the completion of mRNA processing; however, whether this involves different pathways upon splicing dependence of ASF association with mRNA remains unclear. Since the phosphorylation level of SR proteins may affect their affinity for other proteins (14Graveley B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1197-1211Google Scholar), we hypothesize that dephosphorylation of ASF initiates mRNP remodeling or triggers dissociation of mRNPs from putative nuclear anchors that attach hnRNPs in less soluble nuclear fractions for mRNP maturation (29Li C. Lin R.-I. Lai M.-C. Ouyang P. Tarn W.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7363-7376Google Scholar). Moreover, hypophosphory"

Kane J.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1767-1774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, when compared with LDL in plasma, arterial lipid droplets have a reduced protein content and contain no immunoreactive apoB-100 (16Kruth H.S. Subcell. Biochem. 1997; 28: 319-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and LDL particles, when deposited in human atherosclerotic lesions, lose their apoB-100 immunoreactivity (17Kruth H.S. Shekhonin B. Atherosclerosis. 1994; 105: 227-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), suggesting that apoB-100 in the arterial intima is subjected to proteolytic degradation. Indeed, proteolysis of apoB-100 in vitro has been shown to induce fusion of LDL particles into lipid droplets that resemble those found in atherosclerotic lesions (18Kovanen P.T. Kokkonen J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4430-4436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Paananen K. Kovanen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2023-2031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Paananen K.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10120-10129Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). On the basis of the above findings, we have proposed that proteolytic modification of LDL particles may be one mechanism leading to LDL fusion and the appearance of the typical extracellular lipid droplets in the arterial intima (2Öörni K. Pentikäinen M.O. Ala-Korpela M. Kovanen P.T. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1703-1714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, only certain neutral proteases have been shown to be able to trigger aggregation and fusion of LDL particles, these proteases having in common the ability to cause extensive cleavage of apoB-100, i.e. degradation into small peptide fragments, some of which are released from the LDL particles (21Piha M. Lindstedt L. Kovanen P.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10120-10129Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cultured monocyte-derived macrophages (22Reddy V.Y. Zhang Q.Y. Weiss S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3849-3853Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 23Punturieri A. Filippov S. Allen E. Caras I. Murray R. Reddy V. Weiss S.J. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 192: 789-799Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and smooth muscle cells, when stimulated with proinflammatory cytokines (24Sukhova G.K. Shi G.P. Simon D.I. Chapman H.A. Libby P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 576-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), have been shown to secrete lysosomal papain-like cysteine proteases. Normally, these cysteine proteases play a major role in intracellular protein degradation and turnover in lysosomes, but they are also capable of degrading proteins extracellularly (25Turk B. Turk D. Turk V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 98-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). By degrading the components of the arterial extracellular matrix, the secreted lysosomal cysteine proteases could contribute to the development of atherosclerotic lesions. Indeed, when human arteries were examined for the presence of two cysteine proteases, cathepsins S and K, normal arterial segments were found to contain little or none, whereas atherosclerotic lesions contained abundant immunoreactive cathepsins S and K (24Sukhova G.K. Shi G.P. Simon D.I. Chapman H.A. Libby P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 576-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Moreover, cystatin C, a natural extra-cellular cysteine protease inhibitor, was found to be down-regulated in the lesions (26Shi G.P. Sukhova G.K. Grubb A. Ducharme A. Rhode L.H. Lee R.T. Ridker P.M. Libby P. Chapman H.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1191-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). In addition, atherosclerotic mouse models have provided further support for the view that cysteine proteases play a role in the pathobiology of the arterial wall. Thus, the expression of cathepsins B, L, and S, was found to be increased in apoE-deficient mice (27Jormsjo S. Wuttge D.M. Sirsjo A. Whatling C. Hamsten A. Stemme S. Eriksson P. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 939-945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and deficiency of cathepsin S was shown to reduce atherosclerosis in LDL receptor-deficient mice (28Sukhova G.K. Zhang Y. Pan J.H. Wada Y. Yamamoto T. Naito M. Kodama T. Tsimikas S. Witztum J.L. Lu M.L. Sakara Y. Chin M.T. Libby P. Shi G.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 897-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). We have now examined the possible role of a newly described lysosomal cysteine protease, cathepsin F (29Wang B. Shi G.P. Yao P.M. Li Z. Chapman H.A. Brömme D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32000-32008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), in human atherosclerosis and examined the ability of cathepsins to generate lipid droplets from LDL particles. We have tested the effects of human recombinant cathepsins F, S, and K on LDL particles, notably on the degradation of apoB-100, on the aggregation and fusion of LDL particles, and on the retention of LDL particles by human aortic proteoglycans in vitro. We have also followed the expression and secretion of cathepsin F in cultured human monocyte-derived macrophages. Finally, we have also looked for the presence of cathepsin F in normal and atherosclerotic human coronary arteries and compared its localization with that of cathepsins S and K. Materials—Bovine serum albumin, diaminobenzidine, dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, and hyaluronan were purchased from Sigma. Chondroitin 4-sulfate and chondroitin 6-sulfate were obtained from Seikagaku Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan). [1,2-3H]Cholesteryl linoleate, t-Butoxycarbonyl-l-[35S]methionine N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (the 35S labeling reagent), HiTrap SP columns, protein A-Sepharose, and the nucleotides were from Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden). Cystatin C was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Vectastain ABC kits and methyl green were from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA), and anti-human CD68 (PG-M1), anti-human macrophage (HAM56), anti-muscle actin (HHF35) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (P0447) antibodies were obtained from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against human recombinant cathepsin F was generated (mature cathepsin F protein produced in Escherichia coli). In addition, a rabbit polyclonal anti-cathepsin F antibody (SC-13987) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and a mouse monoclonal anti-cathepsin F antibody from Novocastra Laboratories (United Kingdom) were used. Anti-cystatin C antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Alexa-conjugated isotype-specific goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies and DAPI were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Microtiter plates (Combiplate 8, Enhanced Binding) were from Labsystems (Helsinki, Finland), Falcon 12-well cell culturing plates from Becton Dickinson (NJ) and 25-cm2 cell culturing bottles from Nalge Nunc International. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was purchased from BioWhittaker Europe (Verviers, Belgium), nitrocellulose filters (Transblot Transfer Medium) from Bio-Rad, and Vivaspin concentrators from Vivascience (Hannover, Germany). l-Glutamine, macrophage-SFM medium, Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase kit, nonessential amino acids, penicillin-streptomycin, random primers, RPMI 1640, sodium pyruvate, and Ultrapure Agarose were from Invitrogen (Paisley, Scotland). Taq polymerase, RNase inhibitor, and the lactate dehydrogenase kit were from Roche (Basel, Switzerland), RNeasy minikit and DNase from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany), and human GM-CSF (Leucomax) from Schering-Plough. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein was a kind gift from Drs. Christian Ehnholm and Matti Jauhiainen at the National Public Health Institute, Helsinki, Finland. Preparation and Labeling of LDL—Human LDL (d = 1.019–1.050 g/ml) was isolated from the plasma of fasting healthy volunteers by sequential ultracentrifugation in the presence of 3 mm EDTA (30Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6487) Google Scholar, 31Radding C.M. Steinberg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1960; 39: 1560-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). 35S-Bolton-Hunter-LDL was prepared by labeling the protein component of the lipoproteins with a 35S labeling reagent by the Bolton-Hunter procedure (32Bolton A.E. Hunter W.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2398) Google Scholar), as described previously (18Kovanen P.T. Kokkonen J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4430-4436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]Cholesteryl linoleate-LDL was prepared by incubating a mixture of LDL and cholesteryl ester transfer protein with solid dispersions of [3H]cholesteryl linoleate on Celite, as described (21Piha M. Lindstedt L. Kovanen P.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10120-10129Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In each experiment, the labeled lipoproteins were mixed with unlabeled lipoproteins. The amounts of LDL are expressed in terms of their protein concentrations, which were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (33Lowry O.H. Rosenbrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Cathepsins F, S, and K—Human cathepsin F was produced by the Pichia expression system and purified using a HiTrap SP column, as previously described (29Wang B. Shi G.P. Yao P.M. Li Z. Chapman H.A. Brömme D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32000-32008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Human cathepsins K and S were expressed as Pichia pastoris (34Linnevers C.J. McGrath M.E. Armstrong R. Mistry F.R. Barnes M.G. Klaus J.L. Palmer J.T. Katz B.A. Bromme D. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 919-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus expression system (35Brömme D. Bonneau P.R. Lachance P. Wiederanders B. Kirschke H. Peters C. Thomas D.Y. Storer A.C. Vernet T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4832-4838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Molar concentrations of active cathepsins K and S were obtained by titration with E64 (36Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Brown M.A. Kirschke H. Knight G.C. Tamai M. Hanada K. Biochem. J. 1982; 201: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar), and that of cathepsin F with the irreversible inhibitor, LHVS using the same method as described for E64 (kindly provided by Celera Corp, South San Francisco, CA). Treatment of LDL with Cathepsins F, S, and K—LDL (0.5 mg/ml) was incubated with 20–100 nm human recombinant cathepsin F, S, or K in buffer A (20 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 6.0) at 37 °C for the times indicated. When the effect of pH in LDL degradation was studied, the incubations were carried out in either buffer A, 20 mm PIPES, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 6.5 or 7.0, or 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5. In some experiments, the degradation assays were carried out in the presence of various glycosaminoglycans or proteoglycans. In control samples, LDL was incubated in the absence of proteolytic enzymes. Analysis of Proteolyzed LDL—The degree of proteolytic degradation was determined by measuring the amount of trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity produced (20Paananen K. Saarinen J. Annila A. Kovanen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12257-12262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The degree of aggregation and/or fusion of proteolyzed [3H]cholesteryl linoleate-labeled LDL was determined by rate zonal ultracentrifugation (37Polacek D. Byrne M.E. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 797-808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as described previously (38Hakala J.K. Öörni K. Pentikäinen M.O. Hurt-Camejo E. Kovanen P.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Briefly, a linear NaBr gradient (d = 1.006–1.10 g/ml) was layered on top of 50-μl samples of modified [3H]cholesteryl linoleate-LDL in 250 μl of 40% NaBr (w/v) and centrifuged at 33,000 rpm in a SW 40 Ti rotor (Beckman) for 1 h at 20 °C. The gradient was then divided into 500-μl fractions, and the radioactivities were determined using a scintillation counter 1H NMR Spectroscopy—For 1H NMR spectroscopy measurements, LDL samples were prepared at 1 mg/ml concentration. The samples were incubated at 37 °C in the NMR spectrometer in buffer A in the presence and absence (control LDL) of 100 nm cathepsin F, K, or S during data acquisition for 24 h. During the initial 3 h, a spectrum was recorded every 10 min, and subsequently once every 1 h. The spectral width was set to 7008 Hz, comprising 32,000 points yielding a free induction decay of 2.34 s. The recycle delay was 6.4 s. Data were zero-filled eight times and Fourier-transformed. Sodium 3-trimethylsilyl[2,2,3,3-D4]propionate (8 mm) and MnSO4 (0.6 mm), in 99.8% D2O, in a thin coaxial capillary were used as an external chemical shift reference. All the spectra were obtained with a 600-MHz Varian Inova NMR spectrometer at the Institute for Biotechnology NMR Laboratory (Helsinki, Finland). Electron Microscopy of LDL—For thin-section transmission electron microscopy, LDL samples were cast in agarose, and then fixed (39Pentikäinen M.O. Lehtonen E.M.P. Kovanen P.T. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2638-2649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and stained with the osmium-tannic acid-paraphenylenediamine technique (40Guyton J.R. Klemp K.F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1988; 36: 1319-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For negative staining electron microscopy, samples (3 μl) were dried on carbon-coated grids, after which 3 μl of 1% potassium phosphotungstate, pH 7.4, was added and also dried on the grids (41Forte T. Nichols A.V. Adv. Lipid Res. 1972; 10: 1-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were viewed and photographed in a JEOL 1200EX electron microscope at the Institute for Biotechnology, Department of Electron Microscopy (Helsinki, Finland). Preparation and Characterization of Aortic Proteoglycans—Proteoglycans from the intima media of human aortas obtained at autopsy within 24 h of accidental death were prepared essentially by the method of Hurt-Camejo et al. (42Hurt-Camejo E. Camejo G. Rosengren B. López F. Wiklund O. Bondjers G. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1387-1398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as described previously (43Öörni K. Pentikäinen M.O. Annila A. Kovanen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21303-21311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Glycosaminoglycans were determined by the method of Bartold and Page (44Bartold P.M. Page R.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and the amounts of the proteoglycans are expressed in terms of their glycosaminoglycan contents. Binding of LDL to Proteoglycans in a Microtiter Well Assay—The wells in polystyrene 96-well plates were coated with human aortic proteoglycans (50 μg/ml) or with BSA (5 mg/ml) and blocked as described (38Hakala J.K. Öörni K. Pentikäinen M.O. Hurt-Camejo E. Kovanen P.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). 35S/3H-LDL (10 μg) was incubated with or without recombinant cathepsins F, K, or S (20 nm) in reaction buffer (buffer A containing 1% BSA) for 16 h at 37 °C. The supernatants were removed, and proteolysis was measured by determining the amounts of trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity in the supernatants. The wells were washed three times with 250 μl of buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl, and the radioactivity bound to the wells was measured. Specific binding to the proteoglycans was calculated by subtracting the amount of LDL bound to the BSA-coated wells from the amount of LDL bound to the proteoglycan-coated wells. Preparation of Macrophage Monolayers—Human monocytes were isolated from buffy coats (kind gifts from the Finnish Red Cross Blood Transfusion Center, Helsinki, Finland) by centrifugation in Ficoll-Paque gradient as described (45Saren P. Welgus H.G. Kovanen P.T. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4159-4165PubMed Google Scholar). Washed cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, counted, and seeded in bottles (25 × 106 cells/25 cm2) for Western blotting or in 12-well plates (4 × 106 cells/well) for mRNA analysis. After 1 h, nonadherent cells were removed and the medium was replaced with macrophage-SFM supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin and GM-CSF (11 ng/ml). mRNA Analysis—Monocyte-macrophages were cultured for up to 15 days, and at various time points the total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) in the presence of DNase. For the isolation, the cells from three different donors were pooled. Total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using a Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) in the presence of an RNase inhibitor. The cDNA obtained was further amplified by PCR using specific oligonucleotides for cathepsin F: 5′-TCA GTG ATC TCA CAG AGG AGG (sense) and 5′-TAG TCA TCC TCT GTC TCC AGC (anti-sense) and conditions were 40 cycles, Tm 58 °C. GAPDH-PCR was used for quality control. Primers for GAPDH were 5′-ACC ACA GTC CAT GCC ATC AC (sense) and 5′-TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA (anti-sense). Conditions used were 25 cycles, Tm 58 °C. The PCR products were separated on a 1.4% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and quantified with a Gel Doc 2000 gel documentation system. Western Blot Analysis of Monocyte-Macrophage Media and Lysates— Monocyte-macrophages were cultured for up to 13 days, and at various time points the medium was replaced with RPMI 1640 supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin and l-glutamine (2 mm). The cells were further cultured for 2 days, after which the media were collected. Lactate dehydrogenase activity in the media and in the cells was measured from parallel incubations using a commercial kit. The level of lactate dehydrogenase activity in the media varied between 5 and 10% of the total cellular activity and did not increase during the 15-day culture period. For each sample, media from three different donors were pooled. Nonadherent cells were removed from the media by centrifugation, protease inhibitors (1 mm PMSF, 2 mm benzamidine, 5 mm EDTA) were added, and the samples were concentrated into 1/20 using Vivaspin concentrators. 20 μl of reducing SDS-PAGE buffer (0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.002% bromphenol blue, 40% glycerol, 1% β-mercaptoethanol) was added to 20 μl of the sample. Whole cell lysates were prepared by lysing the cells with reducing SDS-PAGE buffer. For each sample, cells from three different donors were pooled. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 4–20% gradient gels, after which the samples were transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were blocked by incubation in 3% BSA in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (TTBS) for 1 h. Cathepsin F was detected using anti-human cathepsin F monoclonal antibody (1:50 in 1% BSA-TTBS) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:2000 in 1% BSA-TTBS). The bands were detected by using a commercial enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Detection of Active Cathepsin F in Macrophage-conditioned Media— Monocyte-derived macrophages were cultured for 13 days as described above. The cells were then cultured for 2 days in the absence and presence of cystatin C (15 μg/ml) in serum-free RPMI supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin and l-glutamine, after which the media were collected as described above. The media were pre-precipitated with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C, after which the media were first incubated with 2 μl of anti-cystatin C antibody for 1 h at 4 °C and then with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. The bound proteins were eluted with 20 μl of reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer, loaded into a 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and immunoblotted with cathepsin F monoclonal antibody as described above. Immunohistochemistry—Coronary samples were obtained, with permission from the Ethical Committee of Helsinki University Central Hospital, from hearts discarded during heart transplantation. The samples were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin, using standard procedures. Paraffin (8 μm) sections were cut, and the sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, microwaved at high power for 2 × 5 min in 10 mm citrate buffer (pH 6.0), and immunostained with ABC Elite kits from Vector Laboratories according to the instructions from the manufacturer, using diaminobenzidine as the peroxidase substrate. The sections were then counterstained with methyl green, dehydrated, and mounted with Permount. The sections were also double immunostained for cathepsin F and various cell type markers by incubating the samples first with a combination of a monoclonal anti-cathepsin F (IgG2a) antibody and monoclonal cell type markers (IgG1) followed by fluorescently labeled isotype-specific secondary antibodies, and in these samples the nuclei were stained with DAPI. The samples were viewed and photographed with a Nikon E600 fluorescence microscope equipped with a cooled CCD camera (Spot RT, Diagnostic Instruments). The primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-human cathepsin F anti-serum (29Wang B. Shi G.P. Yao P.M. Li Z. Chapman H.A. Brömme D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32000-32008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) (1:200 dilution), commercial rabbit anti-human cathepsin F antibody (2 μg/ml), commercial mouse-anti human cathepsin F monoclonal antibody (1:50), mouse anti-human CD68 antibody (7 μg/ml), mouse anti human-macrophage (HAM-56) antibody (0.7 μg/ml), mouse anti-CD31 antibody (10 μg/ml) for endothelial cell, mouse anti-CD43 (2.7 μg/ml) for T lymphocytes, and mouse anti-muscle actin (1 μg/ml) for smooth muscle cells. In the controls, the primary antibodies were omitted or replaced with similar concentrations of nonimmune rabbit serum or nonimmune mouse IgG1 or IgG2a. As a further control, immunostaining was conducted on methanol-fixed frozen sections of human coronary arteries. Cathepsins F, K, and S have a slightly acidic pH optimum (∼pH 6) and although cathepsins F and K are rapidly inactivated at neutral pH, cathepsin S is stable also at neutral pH (29Wang B. Shi G.P.

Here, we first examined the ability of cathepsins F, K, and S to degrade apoB-100 in LDL particles at pH range 6.0"
https://openalex.org/W1967090269,"Cytochrome c oxidase assembly process involves many accessory proteins including Cox11, which is a copper-binding protein required for Cu incorporation into the CuB site of cytochrome c oxidase. In a genome wide search, a number of Cox11 homologs are found in all of the eukaryotes with complete genomes and in several Gram-negative bacteria. All of them possess a highly homologous soluble domain and contain an N-terminal fragment that anchors the protein to the membrane. An anchor-free construct of 164 amino acids was obtained from Sinorhizobium meliloti, and the first structure of this class of proteins is reported here. The apoform has an immunoglobulin-like fold with a novel type of β-strand organization. The copper binding motif composed of two highly conserved cysteines is located on one side of the β-barrel structure. The apoprotein is monomeric in the presence of dithiothreitol, whereas it dimerizes in the absence of the reductant. When copper(I) binds, NMR and extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data indicate a dimeric protein state with two thiolates bridging two copper(I) ions. The present results advance the knowledge on the poorly understood molecular aspects of cytochrome c oxidase assembly.

Multiple subunits and several cofactors are necessary for catalytic activity including two hemes a, a magnesium ion, a zinc ion, and three copper ions. In particular, the copper ions are located in subunits COX I and COX II, which contain the CuB and CuA centers, respectively. The insertion of these cofactors and assembly of the CcO complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane requires accessory proteins (for a general review, see Ref. 1Carr H.S. Winge D.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). It has recently become clear that the required metal ions cannot simply diffuse to the requisite compartment of the cell for insertion into the desired protein, but a complex machinery of metal importers and chaperones is required (2O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25057-25060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, two metallochaperones, Cox17 and Cox19, were proposed to shuttle copper in the mitochondrion (3Nobrega M.P. Bandeira S.C.B. Beers J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40206-40211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 4Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Other nuclear genes also are required for the proper insertion of copper into CcO (5Tzagoloff A. Capitanio N. Nobrega M.P. Gatti D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 6Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20531-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 7Schulze M. Rodel G. Mol. Gen.

In particular, it is well established that a mitochondrial inner membrane protein, Sco1, interacting with COX II subunit (9Lode A. Kuschel M. Paret C. Rodel G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), is important for copper insertion into the binuclear CuA site (10Dickinson E.K. Adams D.L. Schon E.A. Glerum D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26780-26785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 11Mattatall N.R. Jazairi J. Hill B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28802-28809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). On the contrary, the process through which copper is provided to COX I subunit, which contains a copper ion buried 13 Å below the membrane surface, still remains essentially obscure, even if it is known that it requires another mitochondrial inner membrane protein, Cox11. Cox11 was first shown to be implicated in the CcO maturation process from the observation that Δcox11 yeast lacked CcO activity and was deficient in heme a (5Tzagoloff A. Capitanio N. Nobrega M.P. Gatti D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It was also observed that, for cox11 mutants lacking CcO activity, RNA and protein synthesis of the core subunits I and II are normal, suggesting that Cox11 functions post-translationally to generate active CcO (5Tzagoloff A. Capitanio N. Nobrega M.P. Gatti D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, it is now evident that other two proteins rather than Cox11 are the key enzymes involved in heme a formation (12Mogi T. Saiki K. Anraku Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 13Barros M.H. Carlson C.G. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). More recently, it was indeed demonstrated that the CuB site is absent in CcO purified from Rhodobacter sphaeroides lacking cox11 (14Hiser L. Di Valentin M. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Cox11 functions primarily in CuB site formation, possibly delivering copper directly to that site. Alternatively, Cox11 could act as a co-chaperone, facilitating Cu(I) donation through another molecule. In particular, Cox11 may function in copper insertion with specificity for CuB site in a fashion analogous to that hypothesized for the metallation of the CuA site, i.e. Cox17 donates Cu(I) to Sco1, which inserts copper into the CuA site (1Carr H.S. Winge D.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In yeast Cox11, a 34-kDa protein anchored by a single transmembrane segment to the inner mitochondrial membrane, the soluble C-terminal domain is in a dimeric state both in the apoform and Cu(I) bound form (15Carr H.S. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31237-31242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The protein binds one copper atom per monomer, and from the EXAFS data, it was observed that the two copper ions are in close proximity (15Carr H.S. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31237-31242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It was suggested that copper is coordinated by three conserved cysteine residues, even if it was not possible to determine whether they all belong to the same subunit of the dimer or if one of them belongs to the other subunit (15Carr H.S. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31237-31242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Mutation of any of these Cys residues reduces Cu(I) binding and confers respiratory incompetence and reduced CcO activity (15Carr H.S. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31237-31242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In this study, we browsed GenBank™ to search for homologs of yeast Cox11 in prokaryotic organisms and we selected five sequences, cloned them, and expressed them in a high throughput approach. We then have solved the three-dimensional solution structure of the soluble C-terminal domain of Cox11 from Sinorhizobium meliloti (in the metal-free form, it is purified) to further address, on the basis of the structural properties, its role in the assembly of the CuB center of CcO. The soluble domain of apoCox11 adopts a novel type of β-immunoglobulin (Ig)-like fold. The interaction with copper(I) was investigated by EXAFS spectroscopy. It comes out that an immunoglobulin-fold can be adapted to bind copper(I) with sulfur atoms in a dimeric structural arrangement that involves a binuclear copper(I) cluster. The structural findings then are discussed on the basis of the mechanistic implication of Cox11 in the CuB site formation. Sequence Search and Analysis—Cox11 sequences were searched in all of the non-redundant GenBank™ databases (coding sequences translations + Protein Data Bank + Swiss-Prot + Protein Information Resource + Protein Research Foundation) using sequence similarity criteria. This was accomplished by starting from the sequence of Cox11 from yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and performing a protein-protein BLAST (16Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaeffer A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar) search (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Sequence alignments were done with ClustalW (17Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55767) Google Scholar). The prediction of trans-membrane helices and membrane topology of Cox11 sequences is obtained using HMMTOP and TMpred programs (18Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 347: 166-170Google Scholar, 19Tusnady G.E. Simon I. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Protein and NMR Sample Preparation—The genes coding Cox11 proteins from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Caulobacter crescentus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, R. sphaeroides, and S. meliloti were selected for protein expression and amplified by polymerase chain reaction using specific primers and genomic DNA from the selected bacteria. All of the constructs lack the N-terminal trans-membrane-spanning helix. Amplified genes were cloned in pET21a expression vectors producing both native and C-terminal His6-tagged proteins. All of the constructs were screened for expression in Luria-Bertani-ampicillin medium using BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli strains. The cells were grown at 37 °C, and induction was performed by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cox11 protein from S. meliloti then was selected because it is mainly present in the supernatant at variance with all of the other protein constructs and showed the highest expression level. Purification of Cox11 from S. meliloti is performed by anionic exchange chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography at 4 °C. For the overexpression of 15N- and 13C/15N-enriched Cox11, cells were grown in minimal medium containing 0.4% of 13C d-glucose and/or 0.1% (15NH4)2SO4. Protein concentration was determined by using an extinction coefficient of 13,490 m-1 cm-1 at 280 nm. Electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry spectra of apoCox11, previously reduced by DTT, were taken with an Applied Biosystems electron spray ionization-time-of-flight Mariner mass spectrometer. Analytical gel filtration was performed on a Superdex 75 10/30 HR sizing column in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7, or 50 mm Tris/MES, pH 7.0, containing 5 or 1 mm DTT when specified. Copper(I) was added as [Cu(I)(CH3CN)4]PF6 in a 2-fold excess to apoprotein samples previously incubated with 10 mm DTT in 50 mm Tris/MES, pH 8, under a N2 atmosphere chamber. The excess of copper was removed through a Q-Sepharose column. Copper content was checked through atomic absorption measurements with a PerkinElmer 2380 instrument. NMR samples were in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, with 10% D2O. The apoprotein concentration of NMR samples ranged from 1 to 2 mm in the presence of 5 mm DTT to prevent possible disulfide formation as more than one cysteine are present. The Cu(I) protein concentration of NMR sample was 0.5 mm in 50 mm Tris/MES buffer at pH 7.2. NMR measurements were also performed on a Cu(I)Cox11 sample containing 1 mm DTT. NMR Spectroscopy and Structure Calculations—The NMR spectra were acquired at 298 K on Avance 800, 600, and 500 Bruker spectrometers operating at proton nominal frequencies of 800.13, 600.13, and 500.13 MHz, respectively. The NMR experiments used for the backbone and the aliphatic side chain resonances assignment and for obtaining structural restraints, recorded on 13C/15N- and 15N-enriched and unlabeled apoCox11 samples, are summarized in Supplemental Table I. The 1H, 13C, and 15N resonance assignments of apoCox11 are reported in Supplemental Table 2. Distance constraints for structure determination were obtained from 15N-edited and 13C-edited three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC experiments and from two-dimensional NOESY. Backbone dihedral ϕ and Ψ angles were determined through HNHα and three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC experiments, respectively, as reported previously (20Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 21Gagne R.R. Tsuda S. Li M.X. Chandra M. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1961-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The elements of secondary structure were determined on the basis of the chemical shift index (22Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1909) Google Scholar), of the 3JHNHα coupling constants, and of the backbone NOEs. An automated CANDID approach combined with the fast DYANA torsion angle dynamics algorithm (23Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar) was used to assign the ambiguous NOE cross-peaks and to have a preliminary protein structure. Structure calculations were then performed through iterative cycles of DYANA (24Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar) implemented with the use of Ramachandran potentials (25Bertini I. Cavallaro G. Luchinat C. Poli I. J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 4: 355-366Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) followed by restrained energy minimization with AMBER 5.0 (26Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham T.E. Ferguson D.M. Seibel G.L. Singh U.C. Weiner P.K. Kollman P.A. AMBER 5.0. University of California, San Francisco1997Google Scholar) applied to each member of the final DYANA family. The assessment of the structures was evaluated using the programs PROCHECK-NMR (27Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4430) Google Scholar) and AQUA (27Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4430) Google Scholar, 28Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Thornton J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Fold similarities in the Protein Data Bank were searched using the DALI (29Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar), SCOP (30Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Clothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5595) Google Scholar), and CATH (31Orengo C.A. Michie A.D. Jones S. Jones D.T. Swindells M.B. Thornton J.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 1093-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) programs. A structural model of the soluble domain of human Cox11, which shows a high sequence identity with Cox11 from S. meliloti (44%), was calculated with the program MODELLER, version 4.0 (32Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10565) Google Scholar). Due to the high sequence identity, the structural model is expected to have a very high accuracy as validated by the PROSA energetic parameters (33Sippl M.J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 17: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar). 15N R1, R2, and steady-state heteronuclear NOEs were measured with pulse sequences as described by Farrow et al. (34Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar). R2 were measured using a refocusing time of 450 μs. In all of the experiments, the water signal was suppressed with a “water flipback” scheme (35Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). The experimental relaxation rates were used to map the spectral density function values, J(ωH), J(ωN), and J(0) following a procedure available in literature (36Peng J.W. Wagner G. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 98: 308-332Google Scholar). X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) Data Collection and Analysis— Two Cu(I)Cox11 samples from different protein batches have been prepared for XAS measurements to check the reproducibility of the spectrum. Each sample consisted of a 1 mm protein solution in 50 mm Tris/MES buffer at pH 7.2. Each sample was prepared under nitrogen atmosphere, and all of the subsequent handling was always conducted under inert atmosphere. The protein sample was loaded into a plastic cell covered with Kapton windows, which was carefully washed with an 100 mm EDTA solution, rinsed with pure water and absolute ethanol, and dried. The sample cell was then mounted in a two-stage Displex cryostat (modified Oxford instruments) and kept at 20 K during data collection. XAS data were collected in fluorescence mode at the EMBL bending magnet beamline D2 (DESY, Hamburg, Germany) equipped with a Si(111) double crystal monochromator, a focusing mirror and a 12-element Ge solid-state detector. The XAS scans covered the energy range from 8725 to 9875 eV using variable energy step widths. In the x-ray absorption near-edge structure and EXAFS regions, the steps of 0.3 and 0.4–1.2 eV were used, respectively. The DORIS-III storage ring was operating at 4.5 GeV with 90–140 mA of ring current. Ionization chambers in front and behind the sample were used to monitor the beam intensity. The Bragg reflections of a static Si(220) crystal in back-reflection geometry have been used for the absolute energy calibration of the copper spectra (37Pettifer R.F. Hermes C. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1985; 18: 404-412Crossref Google Scholar). Harmonic rejection was ensured by an energy cut-off of the focusing mirror and a monochromator detuning to 60% of the peak intensity. Dead time correction was applied. For the first Cu(I)-Cox11 sample, only nine scans could be collected, whereas for the second sample, 19 scans were collected. The individual scans were summed and averaged before data reduction, which was performed with the EXPROG software package (designed by H. F. Nolting and C. Hermes, H. F. EMBL, Hamburg, Germany). The XAS spectra from the two samples are identical within the experimental noise, and their analysis provides the same results. The reported spectrum and data analysis refer to the second (19 scans) higher quality dataset, which shows a better signal/noise ratio. The full k3-weighted EXAFS spectrum (30–850 eV above E0 = 8983.6 eV) and its Fourier transform calculated over the range 3.0–15.0 Å-1 have been compared with theoretical simulations with program EXCURVE9.20 (38Binsted N. Hasnain S.S. J. Synchrotron Radiat. 1996; 3: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The Fermi energy offset was refined at the beginning of the simulation and then kept fixed at -8.6 eV. A fixed amplitude reduction factor of 0.9 was used to compensate for the signal amplitude reduction due to multiple excitations. Ligand types and coordination numbers (kept as integers) were varied manually while distances and Debye-Waller factors were refined by the software. The quality of the fit was assessed by the parameter ϵ2 (39Lytle F.W. Sayers D.E. Stern E.A. Phys. Rev. B. 1989; 11: 2795-2801Google Scholar) and by the R-factor as defined within EXCURVE9.20 (38Binsted N. Hasnain S.S. J. Synchrotron Radiat. 1996; 3: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Data Deposition—Resonance assignments and the derived atomic coordinates for a family of acceptable structures and for the average minimized structure with all of the restraints used in structure determination are available at the Protein Data Bank (codes 1SO9 and 1SP0). Genome Browsing and Expression of Cox11 from S. meliloti—A BLAST search over all of the non-redundant GenBank™ genomes for proteins sharing >10% sequence identity with the amino acid sequence of Cox11 from yeast S. cerevisiae located 49 protein sequences. All of the searched sequences belong only to Gram-negative bacterial or to eukaryotic organisms. The Cox11 sequences have quite a variable length, but for a common region, a high average residue identity of 36 ± 8% was found, indicating a highly conserved protein family. A possible metal binding motif CFCF (not used in the search) is conserved in all of the sequences (Supplemental Fig. 1). A third cysteine at the N terminus at position 43 proposed to be involved in copper(I) binding in yeast Cox11 (15Carr H.S. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31237-31242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) is conserved in all of the sequences with the exception of three (Supplemental Fig. 1). A Lys residue at position 131 close to the metal binding motif CFCF is also fully conserved (Supplemental Fig. 1). A hydropathy analysis indicates that this class of proteins contains a single N-terminal trans-membrane-spanning helix, suggesting that they are membrane-bound proteins and that a water-soluble segment can be produced if the N-terminal trans-membrane segment is taken out. This soluble segment entirely comprises the highly conserved amino acids region previously mentioned. Sequences from five different bacterial organisms were selected to express the protein. The organisms are as follows: S. meliloti; R. sphaeroides; A. tumefaciens; C. crescentus; and P. aeruginosa. Protein cloning was successfully performed on all of the selected protein sequences, yielding both C-terminal His tag fusion proteins and native untagged proteins. Expression of all of the His tag constructs yielded non-soluble proteins mainly present in the pellet as inclusion bodies while being in the supernatant only upon the addition of 4–6 m urea. Regarding the untagged constructs, the protein from S. meliloti is largely present in the supernatant and shows high expression levels; therefore, it was selected for the following structural study. The Cox11 gene from S. meliloti codes for a protein of 198 amino acids. The single N-terminal trans-membrane-spanning helix involves residues from Gly-15 to Val-36. Therefore, we expressed a recombinant protein, Cox11, lacking the first 35 residues and thus being 164-amino acids-long (including the first Met residue inserted for the cloning procedure). After the purification steps, the protein does not contain any heavy metal ion. ESI-mass spectrometry spectra show the presence of two species in solution with masses of 18,371 and 18,140 Da, which correspond, respectively, to the cloned construct of 164 amino acids and to a construct where the first two residues, Met-1 and Val-2, were absent (residue numbering is based on the former construct). Analytical gel-filtration analysis showed that apoCox11 eluted in fractions corresponding to a monomeric state when 5 mm DTT was present in the buffer (subsequently confirmed by 15N relaxation measurements) with a little fraction of a dimeric form. When DTT was removed from the eluting buffer, apoCox11 eluted primarily as a dimer with a fraction of protein consistently appearing as higher order aggregates. This behavior suggests that protein dimerization could occur through the formation of one or more intermolecular disulfide bonds. Structural and Dynamic Characterization of ApoCox11—The 1H-15N and 1H-13C HSQC spectra of apoCox11 show well dispersed resonances indicative of an essentially folded protein. 134 of the expected 152 15N backbone amide resonances were assigned for apoCox11 in the presence of 5 mm DTT. The amide resonances are missing for residues 1–10 and 97–105. In total, the resonances of 92% carbon atoms, 93% nitrogen atoms, and 90% protons (calculated considering the segments 11–96 and 106–164) were assigned. Chemical shift index analysis (22Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1909) Google Scholar) on Hα, CO, Cα, and Cβ resonances, 3JHNHα coupling constants, dαN(i-1,i)/dNα(i,i) ratios (21Gagne R.R. Tsuda S. Li M.X. Chandra M. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1961-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and NOEs patterns indicated the presence of 10 β-strands and a 310 helix. By analyzing three-dimensional 15N-edited and 13C-edited NOESY spectra and two-dimensional NOESY spectra, 6733 NOE cross-peaks were assigned and transformed into 3771 unique upper distance limits of which 2867 were meaningful (Supplemental Fig. 2). 66 ϕ- and 64 Ψ-dihedral angle restraints were determined. After restrained energy minimization on each of the 30 conformers of the family, the root mean square deviation of the mean structure was 0.69 Å (with a variability of 0.10 Å) and 1.16 Å (with a variability of 0.10 Å) for the backbone and heavy atoms, respectively (Supplemental Fig. 2), when the N- and C-terminal segments 11–20 and 152–164 and the unassigned residues 97–105 were not included. The final restrained energy minimization family has a target function of 0.35 ± 0.04 Å2 and 0.14 ± 0.05 rad2 for the NOEs and the dihedral angle constraints, respectively. The results of the conformational and energetic analysis of the final restrained energy minimization family of apoCox11 are reported in Supplemental Table III. The solution structure of apoCox11 shown in Fig. 1 is formed by the following secondary structure elements: βa0-(31–42); βa-(46–50); βa′-(54–59); βb′-(64–73); βc′-(78–80); βc′-(83–86); βd′-(95–96); βd′-(106–108); βe-(112–122); helix 310(θ1)-(124–128); and βf-(138–144). The 10 β-strands are organized with parallel and antiparallel alignments to form an almost β-barrel structure constituted by two layers of β-sheets. One sheet is formed by strands βa, βb, βe, βd, and the other sheet is formed by strands βa′, βa0, βf, and βc′ (Fig. 1). In addition, strands βc and βd′ form a short antiparallel β-sheet. The most disordered regions are those involving residues 96–105 and the N and C termini, which show random coil conformation as the chemical shift index values indicate. 15N R1, R2, and 1H-15N NOE values can provide information on internal mobility as well as on the overall protein tumbling rate. From the analysis of 112 backbone NH signals, which are well resolved in the 1H-15N apoCox11 spectra, average R1, R2, and 1H-15N NOE values of 1.72 ± 0.06, 12.7 ± 0.5, and 0.60 ± 0.05 s-1 are found, respectively, at 600 MHz. The experimental relaxation data (Supplemental Fig. 3) are essentially homogenous along the entire polypeptide sequence with the exception of residues located at the C and N termini. The correlation time for the molecule tumbling (τm) as estimated from the R2/R1 ratio is 8.8 ± 0.6 ns as expected for a protein of this size in a monomeric state (40Stokes G. Trans. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 1956; 9: 5-10Google Scholar, 41Einstein A. Investigations on the Theory of the Brownian Movement. Dover, New York1956Google Scholar), thus confirming the results from the gel-filtration analysis. From the spectral density function analysis (Supplemental Fig. 4), it appears that the residues at the N and C termini experience local motions in the sub-ns timescale, i.e. faster than the overall protein tumbling rate. The occurrence of sub-ns motions for residues belonging to the N- and C-terminal regions can explain the paucity of NOEs in these regions, thus determining their high root mean square deviation values. Interaction with Copper: XAS and NMR Characterization—To characterize copper(I) binding to S. meliloti Cox11, the purified apoprotein was treated with an excess of [Cu(I)(CH3CN)4]PF6 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The produced Cu(I)·Cox11 complex is stable only in dilute solution. At a high concentration, the protein starts to form a brown gelatinous precipitate.

https://openalex.org/W2031145684,"A number of organelles contained within mammalian cells have been implicated in the selective sequestration of chemical entities including drug molecules. Specifically, weakly basic molecules have been shown to selectively associate with either the mitochondrial compartment or lysosomes; however, the structural basis for this differentiation has not been understood. To investigate this, we have identified a series of seven weakly basic compounds, all with p<i>K<sub>a</sub></i> near neutrality, which have different sequestration sites within the multidrug-resistant HL-60 human leukemic cell line. Three of the compounds were selectively sequestered into the mitochondria of the cells, whereas the remainder were predominantly localized within lysosomes. Using specific chemical inhibitors to disrupt either mitochondrial or lysosomal accumulation capacity, we demonstrated that accumulation of these compounds into respective organelles are not competitive processes. Comparison of the permeability characteristics of these compounds as a function of pH revealed striking differences that correlate with the intracellular sequestration site. Only those compounds with significantly reduced permeability in the ionized state relative to the un-ionized state had the capacity to accumulate within lysosomes. Alternatively, those compounds with relatively pH-insensitive permeability selectively accumulated into mitochondria. Using novel quantitative assays for assaying drug accumulation into subcellular organelles, we demonstrated a correlation between these permeability characteristics and the lysosomal <i>versus</i> mitochondrial accumulation capacity of these compounds. Together, these results suggest that the selective accumulations of weakly basic compounds in either lysosomes and mitochondria occur via exclusive pathways governed by a unique permeability parameter."

We report that peroxynitrite- and hydrogen peroxide-induced disulfides in the neuron-specific microtubule-associated proteins tau and microtubule-associated protein-2 are substrates for the ubiquitous thioredoxin reductase system composed of thioredoxin reductase, human or Escherichia coli thioredoxin, and NADPH. Tau and microtubule-associated protein-2 cysteine oxidation and reduction were quantitated by monitoring the incorporation of 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein, a thiol-specific labeling reagent. Cysteine oxidation of tau and microtubule-associated protein-2 to disulfides altered the ability of the proteins to promote the assembly of microtubules from purified porcine tubulin. Treatment of tau and microtubule-associated protein-2 with either the thioredoxin reductase system or small molecule reductants fully restores the ability of the MAPs to promote microtubule assembly. Thus changes in the redox state of microtubule-associated proteins may regulate microtubule polymerization in vivo.

Strong evidence implicates oxidative damage to proteins as well as cytoskeletal abnormalities in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (1Smith M.A. Richey Harris P.L.

Microtubules formed by reversible polymerization and depolymerization of tubulin, a heterodimer composed of similar 50 kDa α and β subunits, are key components of the neuronal cytoskeleton and are required for proper neuron function (3Brady S.

Given the abundance of tubulin, tau, and MAP2 and the critical function they play in neurons, we are interested in studying the interaction they have with reactive oxygen species including peroxynitrite anion (ONOO-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). ONOO-, formed from the reaction of nitric oxide and superoxide, is a strong oxidant that can damage several amino acids in proteins (6Pryor W.A. Squadrito G.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L699-L722PubMed Google Scholar, 7Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 836-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Previously we showed that tubulin, with 20 free sulfhydryl groups, is readily oxidized by ONOO-, and the extent of tubulin cysteine oxidation rather than other types of ONOO--induced damage, correlates well with inhibition of microtubule polymerization (8Landino L.M. Hasan R. McGaw A. Cooley S. Smith A.W. Masselam K. Kim G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 398: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Addition of disulfide reducing agents restores a significant portion of the polymerization activity that is lost following ONOO- addition. Recently we reported (9Landino L.M. Iwig J.S. Kennett K.L.

The TRS, composed of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), thioredoxin (Trx), and NADPH, reduces a diverse group of both small-molecule and protein disulfides including 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid), α-lipoic acid, insulin, and protein disulfide isomerases (11Nordberg J.

TrxR catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of an active site disulfide in oxidized Trx, Trx-S2, to the dithiol, Trx-(SH)2. Reduced Trx then undergoes thiol/disulfide exchange with oxidized protein substrates, protein-S2 (11Nordberg J. Arner E.S.J. Free Radic. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21614-21619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tau isolated from Alzheimer disease brains no longer binds to microtubules; thus, microtubule stability in neurons is compromised. Sulfhydryl oxidation of tau has been suggested as a possible early step in the formation of paired helical filaments (16Schweers O. Mandelkow E.M. Biernat J. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8463-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 17Troncoso J.C. Costello A. Watson A.L. Johnson G.V.W. Brain Res. 1993; 613: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For example, cysteine 322 in the microtubule-binding domain of human tau has been identified as a residue capable of forming disulfide cross-links (16Schweers O. Mandelkow E.M. Biernat J. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8463-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In a model suggested by Schweers et al. (16Schweers O. Mandelkow E.M. Biernat J. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8463-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), tau-tau disulfide-linked dimers form first, and then the dimers serve as a template for noncovalent paired helical filament formation. Herein we report that the neuron-specific MAPs, MAP2 and tau, are oxidized in vitro by ONOO- and H2O2 to form disulfide-linked species. Cysteine oxidation of these MAPs alters the ability of these proteins to promote the assembly of microtubules from purified porcine tubulin. We observed that ONOO--damaged tau and MAP2 are substrates for the TRS. Treatment with either the TRS or small molecule reductants fully restores the ability of the MAPs to promote microtubule assembly. Porcine brains were obtained from the Smithfield Packing Company in Smithfield, VA. Human thioredoxin and rat thioredoxin reductase were obtained from American Diagnostica, Inc. Escherichia coli thioredoxin, bovine tau protein, a mouse monoclonal antibody against bovine tau (Tau-1), and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody were obtained from Sigma. X-ray film, SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate, bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent, and 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein (IAF) were obtained from Pierce. All other reagents were obtained from either Sigma or Fisher. Purification of Brain Tubulin and Heat-stable MAPs—Tubulin and heat-stable MAPs were purified from porcine brains by cycles of temperature-dependent polymerization and depolymerization and phosphocellulose chromatography as described (18Williams R.C. Lee J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Tubulin (typically 3–4 μg/μl) in PME buffer (0.1 m PIPES, pH 6.9, 1 mm MgSO4, 2 mm EGTA) was aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. Total MAPs were eluted from the phosphocellulose column in PME buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. Heatstable MAPs were obtained as described by Vallee (19Vallee R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 89-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), desalted, and stored at -80 °C. Tubulin and MAP concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). Synthesis of ONOO-—ONOO- was synthesized from acidified H2O2 and sodium nitrite as described (20Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). The concentration of ONOO- was determined by measuring the absorbance at 302 nm (ϵ302 = 1670 m-1 cm-1) in 0.4 m NaOH. Labeling of Cysteines with IAF—Heat-stable MAPs (1.2 μg/μl, 20 μl) were treated with NaOH (control), ONOO- for 2 min, or H2O2 for 15–20 min at 25 °C. ONOO- stock solutions were diluted with 0.4 m NaOH immediately prior to use, and the volume of ONOO- solution added to achieve the indicated concentrations was normalized (1.5 μl) to avoid variations in pH. Likewise, H2O2 samples were also treated with an equivalent volume of NaOH. Varying concentrations of TCEP, Trx, TrxR, and NADPH in a final volume of 5–15 μl were then added to the samples and incubated at 25 °C for 15 min. IAF in N,N-dimethylformamide was added to final concentrations of 1.5 mm, and samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% gel under reducing conditions, and gel images were captured using a Kodak DC290 system and a UV transilluminator. The intensity of the fluorescein-labeled protein bands was measured using Kodak 1D image analysis software. Microtubule Polymerization Assays—Aliquots of heat-stable MAPs (1.2 μg/μl, 20 μl) in PME buffer were treated with ONOO- or NaOH (control) at 25 °C for 5 min or H2O2/NaOH for 20 min. Following treatment with the oxidants, the components of the TRS including E. coli or human Trx, TrxR, and NADPH or the disulfide reducing agent TCEP were added to the MAP samples in a total volume of 5–15 μl. All reagents added after ONOO- were dissolved in PME buffer. Following a 15-min incubation at 25 °C, the MAP samples were combined with purified porcine tubulin (80 μl, 2.0 μg/μl) on ice. GTP was added to a final concentration of 1.25 mm. The entire sample (105–115 μl) was transferred to a 96-well plate, and microtubule assembly was monitored at 340 nm for 18 min using a thermostated (37 °C) Bio-Tek ELx808-UV plate reader. Following assembly, samples were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, and microtubules were collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatant protein was removed following centrifugation, and protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay. Supernatant and protein pellet samples were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Western Blots of Oxidized Tau—Bovine tau (0.5 μg/μl, 20 μl) was treated with 0.4 m NaOH (1.5 μl) or with ONOO- diluted with 0.4 m NaOH to final concentrations of 100, 250, or 500 μm. Following a 5-min incubation at 25 °C, half of each sample was removed and treated with gel loading buffer containing SDS and βME. The remaining portion of each sample was treated with gel loading buffer minus βME. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and tau proteins (1:2000 for 2 h) were detected using a mouse anti-tau antibody. Antibody complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. To assess the susceptibility of a mixture of heat-stable MAPs, composed primarily of the neuron-specific proteins tau and MAP2, to cysteine oxidation, we treated the proteins with micromolar concentrations of ONOO-. Approximate concentrations of tau and MAP2 used in these experiments are 12 and 2 μm, respectively. However, the molar concentration of the cysteine target is greater because mammalian tau and MAP2 contain 1–2 and 7 cysteines, respectively (21Lewis S.A. Wang D. Cowan N. Science. 1988; 242: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Also of note, a significant fraction of the ONOO- added to any buffered solution at neutral pH isomerizes to nitrate, and all ONOO- reacts within 2 min (7Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 836-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Following treatment of tau and MAP2 with ONOO-, IAF, a sulfhydryl-specific fluorescein labeling reagent, was added. Oxidized cysteines, whether composed of disulfides or higher oxidation states of sulfur, cannot be labeled; thus, as the concentration of ONOO- increases, the incorporation of fluorescein into tau and MAP2 decreases. Fig. 1A shows a dose-dependent decrease in IAF labeling of both tau and MAP2 as the concentration of ONOO- increases. Multiple tau isoforms derived from a single gene can be seen in the region marked tau in Fig. 1A (22Cleveland D.W. Hwo S.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 227-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Likewise, the band marked MAP2 refers to two high molecular weight isoforms, MAP2A and MAP2B (21Lewis S.A. Wang D. Cowan N. Science. 1988; 242: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Cysteine oxidation of both tau and MAP2 was detected with as little as 50 μm ONOO-. Band intensities for tau and MAP2 treated with increasing concentrations of ONOO- are presented in Fig. 1B. In addition to ONOO-, we also assessed cysteine oxidation of tau and MAP2 by H2O2. Although roughly 1000-fold less reactive toward cysteines than ONOO-, substantial H2O2 oxidation of cysteines was observed when the MAPs were treated with 1 mm H2O2 for 20 min (23Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1C compares levels of cysteine labeling for control MAPs and for MAPs treated with 0.50 mm ONOO- and 1 mm H2O2. Labeling of MAP2 was reduced to 40% of control with 0.50 mm ONOO- but only reduced to 60% of control with 1 mm H2O2. Tau labeling was reduced to 30% of control with both ONOO- and H2O2. To determine whether cysteine oxidation of tau and MAP2 yielded disulfides exclusively, rather than higher oxidation states of sulfur, we treated the MAPs first with ONOO-, then with TCEP, a phosphine-based disulfide reducing agent, and finally with IAF. Because TCEP is not a sulfhydryl-containing compound like βME or dithiothreitol, the presence of TCEP does not affect the IAF labeling step. Fig. 2A shows that treatment of ONOO--damaged MAPs with TCEP fully restores IAF labeling to control levels; tau and MAP2 band intensities in lane 1 (control MAPs) are equal to those in lane 3 (ONOO-/TCEP treatment). This observation is consistent with disulfide bonds as the only type of cysteine oxidation of tau and MAP2 induced by ONOO-. The observation that disulfides were formed by ONOO- treatment of MAPs, coupled with our recent work on ONOO--damaged tubulin, led us to ask whether oxidized tau and MAP2 could be repaired by the TRS. Fig. 2B shows the results of the TRS repair assay after SDS-PAGE separation of the fluorescein-labeled MAP samples. Fluorescein labeling of both tau and MAP2 is reduced following the addition of 0.5 mm ONOO- relative to control MAPs (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2). Treatment of ONOO--damaged MAPs with Trx and NADPH restored a modest number of sulfhydryl groups that were then labeled by IAF (lane 3). The addition of reduced Trx (Trx-(SH)2) to the oxidized MAPs even in the absence of TrxR has the potential to show some repair because reduced Trx undergoes thiol-disulfide exchange with oxidized tau and MAP2 according to Reaction 2 (11Nordberg J. Arner E.S.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1287-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2119) Google Scholar). Treatment of ONOO--damaged MAPs with the complete TRS (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 5) restored fluorescein labeling of tau and MAP2 to 92 and 94%, respectively, of control, whereas TCEP treatment restored labeling of both to 94–97% of control. Equimolar concentrations of human and E. coli Trx were used in the repair assays with mammalian TrxR, and identical results were obtained. Once we had established that tau and MAP2 were sensitive targets for ONOO- damage and that oxidized tau and MAP2 were substrates for the TRS, we sought to assess the effect of MAP cysteine oxidation on microtubule polymerization. First, we treated heat-stable MAPs with ONOO- or H2O2 in a separate reaction, combined the oxidized MAPs with purified porcine tubulin, and monitored both the rate and extent of microtubule polymerization. Fig. 3 shows overlays of several microtubule polymerization curves in which MAPs were pretreated with oxidants and then combined with tubulin. A comparison of control MAPs with ONOO--treated MAPs shows a very distinct difference in the kinetics of microtubule polymerization. An extended lag phase is observed for ONOO--treated MAPs, and the maximal rate of polymerization is also reduced by ONOO- treatment. Notably, H2O2 treatment of MAPs induced the same lag and reduced polymerization rate as ONOO- treatment. Because ONOO- decomposes completely within 2 min at neutral pH, and oxidant-treated MAPs were prepared in a reaction separate from tubulin, the observed lag phase cannot be attributed to direct ONOO- oxidation of tubulin (7Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 836-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Likewise, we performed control experiments to assess any effect of millimolar H2O2 or ONOO- degradation products on the ability of purified tubulin to polymerize, and none was observed (data not shown) (8Landino L.M. Hasan R. McGaw A. Cooley S. Smith A.W. Masselam K. Kim G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 398: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Another key observation to be gleaned from Fig. 3 is that the extended lag and reduced rate caused by both oxidants is fully reversed by the action of TCEP. Thus, it is clear that cysteine oxidation of tau and MAP2 to disulfide species is responsible for the changes in microtubule polymerization kinetics. Likewise, we treated ONOO--damaged MAPs with the TRS in the same manner as in Fig. 2B and then combined the repaired MAPs with tubulin. The TRS, like TCEP, reversed the effects of ONOO- and H2O2 on the kinetics of microtubule polymerization (data not shown). These findings are noteworthy for several reasons. Clearly, cysteine oxidation of tau and MAP2 affects the ability of the proteins to promote the assembly of microtubules. In fact, the assembly curves shown for ONOO-- and H2O2-damaged MAPs are nearly identical to tubulin polymerization curves obtained in the absence of MAPs (data not shown). The observation that both ONOO- and H2O2 induce the same change in assembly kinetics, coupled with the fact that the effect is reversed by both TCEP and TRS, points to cysteine oxidation as the culprit. This is particularly important because ONOO- can damage several amino acids in proteins, whereas H2O2 can oxidize only cysteines and perhaps methionine (24Radi R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 720-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Tyrosine nitration of tau has been reported in the brains from Alzheimer patients; however, our work with H2O2 shows that tyrosine nitration of MAPs cannot be responsible for the change in polymerization kinetics that we observe (25Horiguchi T. Uryu K. Ischiropoulos H. Lightfoot R. Bellmann C. Richter-Landsberg C. Lee V.M.-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 1021-1031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Although the lag phase for assembly is clearly affected, the extent of microtubule polymerization changes only slightly for samples containing oxidant-treated MAPs. Monitoring polymerization for longer times (up to 25 min) shows that the oxidant-treated MAP samples plateau at nearly the same absorbance value. Following polymerization assays, microtubules were collected by centrifugation, and the concentration of protein in the supernatant (unassembled protein) was measured. Supernatant protein concentrations obtained for the oxidant-treated MAP samples were consistently 10–15% higher than for control MAPs suggesting that less tubulin polymerized. This is in good agreement with the polymerization curves shown in Fig. 3 and with those where assembly was monitored for longer time periods. Also of note, the absolute absorbance changes shown in Fig. 3 are lower than those typically seen for microtubule assembly with the concentration of tubulin used. Absorbance changes at 360 nm in a cuvette were also monitored, and the changes in absorbance were consistently 2-fold higher. The lower absorbance changes are attributed to the assay format using the microtiter plate, a smaller reaction volume, and detection at 340 nm (8Landino L.M. Hasan R. McGaw A. Cooley S. Smith A.W. Masselam K. Kim G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 398: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The difference in supernatant protein concentration could also be partially attributed to greater amounts of tau and MAP2 present in the supernatant. MAP2 binding to microtubules was assessed by separation of the microtubule pellet from the supernatant after polymerization and analysis of the supernatants and pellets for MAP2 using a monoclonal antibody against porcine MAP2. The binding of MAP2 and tau, two abundant and neuron-specific MAPs, to microtubules is dependent on charge interactions between the very acidic C termini of α- and β-tubulin and the positively charged microtubule-binding domains of MAP2 and tau (26Serrano L. Avila J. Maccioni R.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4675-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of porcine MAP2 in supernatants and pellets consistently showed a modest increase (10–20% greater than control) in MAP2 in the supernatant fraction for oxidant-treated MAP samples. Treatment of oxidized MAPs with TCEP or the TRS reduced the amount of MAP2 in the supernatants to control levels (data not shown). Similar experiments could not be performed to analyze tau in supernatants and pellets because commercially available antibodies against tau do not recognize the porcine protein. Protein analyses were also complicated because tubulin (present in both fractions) and tau have nearly identical molecular weights. Some experiments were performed using purified bovine tau in conjunction with porcine tubulin. Western blot analysis of supernatants and pellets obtained following assembly detected a modest increase in tau in the supernatant fraction, a result that was consistent with the results obtained for MAP2. To rule out nonspecific aggregation and precipitation, control and ONOO--damaged MAPs were treated under conditions identical to those for the polymerization assays, except for the absence of tubulin. Although there was a slight (∼10%) increase in pelletable MAPs for the ONOO--treated sample relative to control, that is not sufficient to explain the levels of MAPs detected in the microtubule pellets following assembly. Thus, it appears that disulfide-linked tau and MAP2 are capable of binding to microtubules, but the ability of the proteins to promote assembly is altered. Mouse tau contains only one cysteine residue, Cys-222, which is located in the microtubule-binding domain (21Lewis S.A. Wang D. Cowan N. Science. 1988; 242: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Because mammalian tau proteins contain only one (mouse) or two cysteines (human and bovine), it is likely that tau forms disulfides between tau protein chains rather than within a single protein chain (16Schweers O. Mandelkow E.M. Biernat J. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8463-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). For a tau oligomer to form involving more than 2 tau proteins, it is expected that at least 2 cysteines would have to be present per tau protein; otherwise only dimers could form. No sequence data are available for porcine tau. To assess the type of structure formed following ONOO- addition, we treated purified bovine tau with increasing concentrations of ONOO- and analyzed the reaction products by SDS-PAGE under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. As shown in Fig. 4, analysis of tau by Western blot showed a dose-dependent decrease in the amount of tau detected at 50–60 kDa under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 4, lanes 5–8). No dimers at ∼100 kDa or tetramers (200 kDa) were detected even at the lowest concentrations of ONOO- tested. Analysis under reducing conditions (lanes 1–4) shows identical amounts of tau detected at 50–60 kDa; thus tau oligomer formation is fully reversible in the presence of the disulfide reductant, βME. We conclude that ONOO- induced the formation of higher molecular weight tau oligomers that did not enter the separating gel. In support of this, tau immunoreactivity was detected in the sample wells of the SDS-PAGE gels for those samples treated with ONOO-. These observations suggest the formation of a tau oligomer that is capable of binding to microtubules rather than an insoluble aggregate. The only other report of oxidized tau species binding to microtubules concerned the binding of tau-tau dimers to microtubules; however, in that case, engineered portions of the tau protein were used instead of native tau (27di Noto L. DeTure M.A. Purich D.L. Mol. Cell Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 2: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The results presented herein show that oxidation of native mammalian tau and MAP2 proteins to form disulfide-linked species correlates with an extended lag phase observed during microtubule polymerization experiments. This work is the first to report a link between tau and MAP2 and the TRS, a ubiquitous reductase system. In neurons, tubulin comprises 10–15% of the total protein and the neuron-specific proteins tau and MAP2 bind with a stoichiometry of ∼1 per 10 tubulin dimers (22Cleveland D.W. Hwo S.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 227-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 28Anderson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2168-2171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trx and TrxR are both ubiquitous cytosolic proteins expressed in neuronal cells (29Holmgren A. Luthman M. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4071-4077Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 30Rozell B. Hansson H.-A. Luthman M. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 79-85PubMed Google Scholar). Approximate physiologic concentrations of Trx in mammalian liver and brain are 10–12 and 2 μm, respectively, whereas TrxR concentrations are estimated to be 10–12 nm in liver and 2 nm in brain (29Holmgren A. Luthman M. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4071-4077Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 31Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). NADPH concentrations in liver range from 13–15 μm but are considerably higher in brain at 340–390 μm (32Long C. King E.J. Sperry W.M. Biochemist's Handbook. D. Van Nostrand Company Inc., Princeton, NJ1968: 782Google Scholar). Although the concentrations of Trx, TrxR, and NADPH used herein (see Fig. 2) are higher than the physiologically relevant estimates provided, the concentration of the substrate, i.e. MAP disulfide, was also much greater than would be expected in vivo. This model study was designed to assess whether oxidative damage to MAPs induces alterations in microtubule polymerization kinetics and whether reversal of that damage by the TRS restores MAP function. Thus, these findings serve as a starting point to propose that the cysteines of tau and MAP2 may be oxidized to disulfides and then reduced by the TRS to modulate microtubule polymerization kinetics in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1973590054,"Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), a member of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) family of pathogen-associated molecular pattern receptors, is activated by unmethylated CpG-containing sequences in bacterial DNA or synthetic oligonucleotides (ODNs) in the endosomal compartment. The stimulation of an IL-1 response is thought to require the aggregation of its receptor. By analogy, we postulated that the potency of a TLR9 ligand should depend first on its ability to enter cells and gain access to TLR9 and second on its capacity to form a multimeric complex capable of cross-linking these receptors. Previously, we selected from a random library a series of phosphodiester ODNs with enhanced ability to permeate cells. Here, we studied the structural requirements for these penetrating ODNs to elicit a functional TLR9 response, as assessed by cytokine production from bone marrow-derived mouse mononuclear cells. The presence of a prototypic murine immunostimulatory DNA hexameric sequence (purine-purine-CG-pyrimidine-pyrimidine) in the ODNs was not sufficient for stimulation. In addition, the TLR9-activating ODNs had to have the ability to form aggregates and often to form secondary structures near the core CpG motifs. Multimerization was promoted by the presence of a guanine-rich 3′-terminus. The phosphodiester ODNs with CpG motifs that did not aggregate antagonized the effects of the multimeric TLR9 activators. These findings suggest that an optimal TLR9 agonist needs to contain a spatially distinct multimerization domain and a receptor binding CpG domain. This concept may prove useful for the design of new TLR9-modulating agents.

However, their cellular patterns of expression and their subcellular localization characteristics differ substantially. Thus, whereas most TLRs are expressed predominantly on the external plasma membrane, TLR7 and TLR9 are found mainly on the inner surface of endosomes (12Lund J. Sato A. Akira S. Medzhitov R.

Hence, effective ligation of TLR7 and TLR9 might be intracellular events.The natural activating ligand for TLR9 is bacterial DNA containing unmethylated CpG dinucleotides, commonly referred to as immunostimulatory DNA or sequence (ISS) (15Takeshita F. Leifer C.A. Gursel I. Ishii K.J. Takeshita S. Gursel M. Klinman D.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3555-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 16Hemmi H. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Kaisho T. Sato S.

Comparative studies of CpG oligonucleotides (ODNs) with different sequences have shown that the neighboring residues of the core CpG dinucleotides strongly influence immunostimulatory potency (18Yamamoto T. Yamamoto S. Kataoka T. Tokunaga T. Antisense Res. Dev. 1994; 4: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Kandimalla E.R. Yu D. Zhao Q. Agrawal S. Bioorg. Med.

However, there are some differences between the optimal murine and human ISS. The central murine ISS motif for TLR9 activation has been shown to consist of the hexameric sequence purinepurine-CG-pyrimidine-pyrimidine in phosphodiester or phosphorothioate ODNs of at least 12 nucleotides (22Krieg A.M. Yi A.K. Matson S. Waldschmidt T.J. Bishop G.A. Teasdale R. Koretzky G.A. Klinman D.M. Nature. 1995; 374: 546-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (3069) Google Scholar). The prototypic ODN sequence for activation of human TLR9 contains a TCG sequence at the 5′-end of the molecule (23Hartmann G. Weeratna R.D. Ballas Z.K. Payette P. Blackwell S. Suparto I. Rasmussen W.L. Waldschmidt M. Sajuthi D. Purcell R.H. Davis H.L. Krieg A.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1617-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 24Yu D. Zhao Q. Kandimalla E.R. Agrawal S. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2000; 10: 2585-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Other sequence modifications influence the abilities of the ISS to activate selectively TLR9-expressing macrophages, dendritic cells, or B lymphocytes (25Marshall J.D. Fearon K. Abbate C. Subramanian S. Yee P. Gregorio J. Coffman R.L. Van Nest G. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2003; 73: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 26Verthelyi D. Ishii K.J. Gursel M. Takeshita F. Klinman D.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2372-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar).The initiating events in TLR9 activation have not yet been analyzed, in part because the recombinant protein is difficult to purify in quantity and to solubilize. However, the TLRs are structurally homologous to the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptors, which have been studied in more detail. Activation of IL-1 type I receptors correlated with IL-1-dependent receptor aggregation (27Guo C. Dower S.K. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27562-27568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the IL-1 receptor antagonist, which blocks IL-1 function by competing for receptor binding, did not induce IL-1 receptor aggregation. If a similar signaling mechanism applied to TLR9, one could predict that self-aggregating ISS would strongly activate the receptor by promoting its multimerization, whereas nonaggregating ISS would antagonize these effects. According to this hypothesis, the higher structure of an ISS-ODN, rather than just its primary sequence, could dictate its ability to stimulate or to inhibit innate immune system activation.To gain insight into this problem, we compared the physical properties and the TLR9-activating capacities of a series of phosphodiester ODNs that were selected from a random library for their capacity to be efficiently internalized by cells. Since all of the ODNs were selected for their ability to penetrate cells, their different functional activities were considered to be attributable mainly to TLR9 activation. The experimental results showed that a prototype ISS is not sufficient for TLR9 activation. Aggregating phosphodiester ODNs with ISS in rigid secondary structures activated the receptor effectively, whereas nonaggregating ODNs with CpG motifs functioned as receptor antagonists.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOligodeoxynucleotides—Phosphodiester ODNs from a random library with scrambled insets of 40 nucleotides were selected for their ability to penetrate cells by a repetitive selection procedure that involved (a) incubation with viable cells, (b) extensive and stringent washing to remove all external ODN binding, and (c) asymmetric PCR amplification, as described previously (28Wu C.C.

After 10 rounds of selection, the retained intracellular ODNs were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. Several 40-mer ODNs corresponding to the recovered sequences as well as a random ODN of the same length (random 40) were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Corvallis, OR) (Table I). The prototype ISS-ODNs, 1018 and 1826, have been described (29Roman M. Martin-Orozco E. Goodman J.S. Nguyen M.D. Sato Y. Ronaghy A. Kornbluth R.S. Richman D.D. Carson D.A. Raz E. Nat.

Briefly, viable cells were incubated in protein-free medium with 5′-Cy3-labeled ODNs at 0.5 μm for 2 h at 37 °C. Following washes with 3% fetal bovine serum in RPMI 1640 medium (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA), these cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a Becton Dickinson FAC-Scaliber. Data analysis was carried out using FlowJo 3.4 software (Tree Star, Inc., Stanford, CA).Isolation of Bone Marrow-derived Mononuclear Cells—BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). MyD88-/- and TLR9-/- mice were a generous gift of Dr. S. Akira (Osaka University, Japan) (33Adachi O. Kawai T. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Tsutsui H. Sakagami M. Nakanishi K. Akira S. Immunity. 1998; 9: 143-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). The mice were bred and maintained under standard conditions in the University of California, San Diego Animal Facility that is accredited by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. All animal protocols received prior approval by the institutional review board.Bone marrow harvested from the femurs and tibias of various strains of mice were plated in non-tissue culture-treated Petri dishes with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, all from Invitrogen, and 30% L929 cell-conditioned medium. Cells were grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 7 days without replacing the medium. The bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells were harvested afterward by gentle scraping, counted, and replated in medium with different conditions described below.ODN-stimulated Cytokine Release—For studies on cytokine production, 7-day-old bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well and grown for another 3 days. These cells were then incubated with ODNs at a final concentration of 0.2, 0.5, or 1 μm for 48 h without further supplement. In the competitive receptor binding study, the highly active ODN R10-60 (0.5 μm) was premixed with various concentrations of the inactive ODN R10-9, R10-32, or R10-13 in serum-free medium, prior to addition to the cells. Culture supernatants were collected at the end of incubation and stored at -20 °C for later determination of IL-12p40/70 by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BD Biosciences).In Vitro Kinase Assays—For kinase assays, the enriched mononuclear cells were dispersed in 6-well plates at a density of 1-2 × 106 cells/ml/well and allowed to settle overnight. ODNs were then added to the mononuclear cells at 1 μm and incubated for 0.5-2 h. The cells were quickly lysed in buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm glycerophosphate, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with proteinase inhibitors and 1 mm dithiothreitol on ice and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 1 min. The aqueous phase containing cytoplasmic proteins was removed and saved. The nuclear pellet was lysed in buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.4 m NaCl) and vortexed, and the nuclear supernatant was collected after centrifugation.Specific kinases were immunoprecipitated from cytosolic proteins with either anti-IκB kinase-β or anti-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at 4 °C overnight. Afterward, the immune complexes were washed successively in buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl followed by kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). IκB kinase-β or Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1 kinase assays were performed using the respective recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion protein with IκBα or c-Jun as the respective substrates in the presence of 0.1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C for 30 min, as described (34Lee J. Mira-Arbibe L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 909-915PubMed Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled products were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography.DNA Secondary Structure Prediction—To predict the presence of secondary structures, the DNA mfold program (35Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10084) Google Scholar) (available on the World Wide Web at www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold/old/dna/) was employed. The various sequences were submitted as linear DNA and analyzed based on free energy using default program settings, assuming a temperature of 37 °C, with ionic conditions of 150 mm Na+ and 0.5 mm Mg2+.Analysis of ODN Multimerization by Size Exclusion HPLC and PAGE—A TSK-Gel G2000SWXL HPLC column with a 5-μm particle size (MAC-MOD Analytical, Montgomeryville, PA) was used to perform the size exclusion assay as previously described (28Wu C.C.

Tanaka T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 855-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μl of a 50 μm ODN solution in 30 mm NaCl was injected, and elution was carried out in buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.9, 0.3 m NaCl at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. The HPLC elution fractions were divided into a high molecular weight aggregate portion (retention time 9-12.5 min) and a low molecular weight monomer portion (retention time 12.5-15 min). To address the association of ODN multimerization with immunostimulatory activity, the two fractions were collected, equal amounts were added to bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells, and the culture supernatants were collected 48 h later for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as described above.For gel analysis, phosphorothioate and phosphodiester ODNs were mixed in RPMI 1640 with and without 2% tissue culture grade bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. 12 μl of the mixture were then separated on a 4-20% nondenaturing TBE polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen). The oligonucleotides were visualized by staining with SYBR Green II (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) under UV light. The protein bands were then detected with Coomassie Blue staining.Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Oligonucleotides were resuspended in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.1 m KCl at a final concentration of 10 μm (final volume of 300 μl), boiled for 5 min, and annealed at 60 °C for 2 days (37Dapic V. Bates P.J. Trent J.O. Rodger A. Thomas S.D. Miller D.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3676-3685Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). After slow cooling to room temperature, the samples were analyzed on an AVIV CD spectrometer (model 202, AVIV instruments, Inc., Lakewood, NJ) using a wavelength scan from 320 to 200 nm at 25 °C. Spectra were collected over three scans at 1-nm bandwidth, 1-nm wavelength step, and an average 0.5-s response time for each sample. Data are presented as the average of three scans with integrated curve fitting performed by Prism software (version 3.0; GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA).RESULTSODN Uptake Is Independent of TLR9—We previously described the selection of phosphodiester ODNs with an average length of about 40 nucleotides that displayed improved cellular uptake compared with random sequence ODNs (28Wu C.C. Castro J.E. Motta M. Cottam H.B. Kyburz D. Kipps T.J. Corr M. Carson D.A. Hum. Gene. Ther. 2003; 14: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because the ODNs shown in Table I were selected for uptake by human B cells, it was necessary to confirm that they also effectively penetrated murine bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells. Experiments with fluorochrome-labeled ODNs showed that they were taken up 2-14-fold better than random sequence ODNs of the same length (examples are shown in Fig. 1). In addition, bone marrow-derived cells from TLR9-/- mice displayed an uptake efficiency similar to cells from wild type mice.Sequence Requirements for Activation of Bone Marrow-derived Mononuclear Cells—To characterize the mechanisms involved in activation by these penetrating ODNs and to study the structural and functional requirements for stimulation, we carried out studies on murine bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells from different strains. A panel of ODNs containing different numbers of CpG dinucleotides and murine ISS motifs were first compared for their abilities to induce IL-12p40/p70 secretion. As expected, ODNs without any CpG dinucleotides had no ISS activity (Table I, R10-5). Unexpectedly, however, no detectable IL-12 was released by cells treated with ODN R10-9, which contained the prototype ISS sequence motif AACGTT at the 5′ terminus. Cells stimulated with ODNs that contained at least two sets of CpG dinucleotides produced detectable levels of IL-12. Furthermore, phosphodiester ODN R10-60 showed comparable or even better IL-12 stimulation than the positive control ODN 1018, with a more nuclease-resistant phosphorothioate backbone (Table I).As little as 0.2 μm ODNs R10-53, R10-60, R10-86, and D-R15-8 were sufficient to induce detectable IL-12, and the levels increased in proportion to the ODN concentration (Fig. 2). In contrast, R10-9 was not able to elicit any IL-12 secretion at concentrations up to 1 μm. Together, these data demonstrated that phosphodiester ODNs can display equivalent immunostimulatory activity toward murine bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells as phosphorothioate ODN, and that a CpG motif is necessary but not sufficient for cell activation.Fig. 2Potency of selected phosphodiester ISS-ODNs. Ten-day-old bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells were incubated with the indicated ODNs (see Table I) or with the reference ISS-ODN 1018 in forms of phosphodiester (PO-1018) or phosphorothioate (PS-1018* at 0.5 μm) at either 0.2, 0.5, or 1 μm for 2 days at 37 °C. The cell media were harvested, and IL-12p40/p70 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results are means ± S.D. of three replicates in a representative experiment. Similar results were obtained from at least two different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Role of the TLR-9 and MyD88 Pathways—Since there was no absolute correlation between an ISS motif and immunostimulatory activity among the selected ODNs, it was important to confirm that the ODNs signaled through the TLR9 and MyD88 pathway. No IL-12 production was observed from ODN-stimulated bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells from either TLR9-/- (Table I) or MyD88-/- mice (data not shown). Furthermore, the ODNs did not induce IκB kinase-β or Jun NH2-terminal kinase activities in TLR9-/- and MyD88-/- cells, whereas bacterial lipopolysaccharide clearly activated these cells through the recently described MyD88-independent alternative pathway (Fig. 3). The kinetics of cell activation revealed a maximum at 2 h after phosphodiester ODN application.Fig. 3Dependence of cell activation on TLR9 and MyD88. Bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells from wild type, TLR9-/-, or MyD88-/- mice were stimulated with the indicated ODNs (1 μm), the reference phosphorothioate ISS-ODN (5 μg/ml), or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (10 ng/ml) for the indicated times at 37 °C. Cytosolic proteins were extracted, and either IκB kinase-β (IKK) (A) or Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) (B) complexes were immunoprecipitated. In vitro kinase assays were carried out by incubating the immune complexes with the corresponding recombinant glutathione S-transferase substrate, in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C for 30 min, as described (34Lee J. Mira-Arbibe L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 909-915PubMed Google Scholar). The intensity of the autoradiographic bands indicate the levels of activation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Association of Multimerization with ISS Activity—As the primary ISS motif (e.g. in R10-9) was insufficient for immunostimulatory activity, we evaluated whether a higher structure of an ODN also could influence its biologic properties. Results of the DNA mfold program showed that the CpG dinucleotide sequences in the active ISS-ODN, at their predicted lowest free energy states, were often in or near rigid stem loop structures, whereas the CpG in R10-9 was not (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, point mutations of the CpG located within the predicted rigid loop structures of ISS-ODN also reduced their ability to activate murine bone marrow derived mononuclear cells (Table II, R10-53(T18G) and R10-60(T21G)). More importantly, size exclusion HPLC analysis showed that the active ISS-ODN formed multimers (Fig. 4B, R10-53, R10-60, and D-R15-8), whereas the inactive ISS-ODN R10-9 did not. Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel fractionation of the ODNs also confirmed the presence of multimers in the biologically active ODN samples (data not shown). Removal of the guanine-rich sequences in the 3′-terminus of R10-60 and D-R15-8 (R10-60a and D-R15-8a) or near the 5′-end of R10-53 (R10-53(-7-14Pu)) abolished aggregate formation. Finally, circular dichroism spectroscopic analyses revealed absorption maxima that have been previously associated with the presence of guanine quartets, which are known to form aggregated structures (Fig. 4C).Fig. 4ODN secondary structure and multimerization.A, predicated structure derived from the DNA mfold program (available on the World Wide Web at www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold/old/dna/). Sequences were submitted as linear DNA with folding at 37 °C and ionic conditions of 150 mm Na+, 0.5 mm Mg2+, oligomer type corrections. CpG dinucleotides were boxed. B, ODN aggregate formation assessed by size exclusion HPLC. Samples were prepared at a concentration of 50 μm in 30 mm NaCl, and 50-μl aliquots were injected into the TSK column. High molecular weight aggregates eluted from the column starting at around 9 min, whereas monomers eluted at 13 min. R10-53(-7-14Pu), 5′-TCTGCGCTACGTTACTAGTCGTGTGTCCGTG-3′.

Spectra were collected from three scans at 1-nm bandwidth, wavelength step of 1 nm, and at an average time interval of 0.5 s. An integrated curve was derived from the average of three scans using Prism software. The presence of a parallel type guanine quartet is suggested by a positive maximum at ∼265 nm and a negative minimum near 240 nm (37Dapic V. Bates P.J. Trent J.O. Rodger A. Thomas S.D. Miller D.M.

These produce extracellular matrix proteins and synthesize angiogenic and cardioprotective factors. Although fibroblasts of cardiac origin are known to be resistant to apoptosis and to remain metabolically active in situations compromising cell survival, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we report that cardiac fibroblasts were more resistant than dermal or pulmonary fibroblasts to mitochondria-dependent cell death. Cytochrome c release was blocked in cardiac fibroblasts but not in dermal fibroblasts treated with staurosporine, etoposide, serum deprivation, or simulated ischemia, precluding caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation. Resistance to apoptosis of cardiac fibroblasts correlated with the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, whereas skin and lung fibroblasts did not express detectable levels of this protein. Bcl-xL, Bax, and Bak were expressed at similar levels in cardiac, dermal, and lung fibroblasts. In addition, the death of cardiac fibroblasts during hypoxia was not associated with the cleavage of Bid but rather with Bcl-2 disappearance, suggesting the requirement of the mitochondrial apoptotic machinery to execute death receptor-induced programmed cell death. Knockdown of bcl-2 expression by siRNA in cardiac fibroblasts increased their apoptotic response to staurosporine, serum, and glucose deprivation and to simulated ischemia. Moreover, dermal fibroblasts overexpressing Bcl-2 achieved a similar level of resistance to these stimuli as cardiac fibroblasts. Thus, our data demonstrate that Bcl-2 is an important effector of heart fibroblast resistance to apoptosis and highlight a probable mechanism for promoting survival advantage in fibroblasts of cardiac origin.

This implies that in the adult heart newly formed cells cannot replace dead cardiomyocytes although a limited capacity of proliferation has been described (4Anversa P. Nadal-Ginard B. Nature. 2002; 415: 240-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The requirement of maintaining heart function in stress situations has selected mechanisms of resistance against stress-induced cell death in this organ. Indeed, an incomplete apoptotic phenotype of cardiomyocytes occurs in heart disease (5Narula J. Pandey P. Arbustini E. Haider N. Narula N. Kolodgie F.D. Dal Bello B. Semigran M.J. Bielsa-Masdeu A.

The molecular mechanisms involved in resistance against apoptosis in the heart are now being elucidated. It has been reported that cardiomyocytes are relatively resistant to Fas-induced cell death (7Nelson D.P. Setser E. Hall D.G. Schwartz S.M. Hewitt T. Klevitsky R. Osinska H. Bellgrau D. Duke R.C.

On the other hand, cardiomyocyte mitochondrial dysfunction, comprising mitochondrial potential dissipation, permeability transition, and cytochrome c release, occurs in response to several stress stimuli such as postischemic reperfusion (10Di Lisa F.

Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, the exact role that mitochondria play in cardiac apoptosis is still a matter of debate (13Kubasiak L.A.

In this regard, we have recently reported that cardiac myocytes are resistant to apoptosome-driven apoptosis by a mechanism involving the silencing of Apaf-1 expression (14Sanchis D. Mayorga M. Ballester M. Comella J.X. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Despite the relative resistance of cardiac myocytes to caspase-dependent death, it is well established that apoptosis accounts for cardiac cell death during ischemia/reoxygenation (15Olivetti G.

Interestingly, the space left by dead myocytes is filled by granulation tissue composed of several cell types, including macrophages, endothelial cells and fibroblasts (20Frangogiannis N.G. Smith C.W. Entman M.L. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 53: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar), and newly synthesized extracellular matrix (ECM) (21Schaper J. Speiser B. Basic Res.

This observation implies that cardiac fibroblasts are able to endure and secrete the ECM that constitutes the fibrotic scar under situations that threaten survival of other cell types. Consistent with the enhanced survival potential of cardiac fibroblasts, it has been reported that these cells have reduced apoptosis and sustained proliferation during hypoxia (24Long X. Boluyt M. Hipolito M.L. Lundberg M.S. Zheng J.S. O'Neill L. Cirielli C. Lakatta E.G. Crow M.T. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 2635-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), alcohol exposure (25Chen D.B.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the resistance of cardiac fibroblasts to stimuli inducing cell death are presently unknown. In an attempt to highlight the possible existence of mechanisms conferring survival advantage specifically to fibroblasts of cardiac origin, we decided to explore them with several inducers of apoptosis and to compare their response and the expression of several apoptotic regulators with those of primary dermal and pulmonary fibroblasts. Indeed, fibroblasts of cardiac origin were more resistant than dermal- and lung-derived fibroblasts to staurosporine (STS), etoposide, serum deprivation, and simulated ischemia. We further analyzed the intracellular mechanisms involved. Our data pointed to the blockade of cytochrome c translocation as the main mechanism of cardiac fibroblast resistance to apoptosis. Furthermore, cardiac fibroblasts expressed an easily detectable level of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, which is repressed in many cell types after development (28Novack D.V. Korsmeyer S.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 7-10PubMed Google Scholar), including dermal (29Pablos J.L. Carreira P.E. Serrano L. Del Castillo P. Gomez-Reino J.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and lung (30Bruce M.C. Honaker C.E. Cross R.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) fibroblasts. Here, we provide evidence supporting the notion that the maintenance of Bcl-2 expression in cardiac fibroblasts confers their resistance to mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. Cell Cultures and Treatments—We obtained neonatal cardiac fibroblasts from the heart of 2–4-day-old Sprague Dawley rats. After digestion of the hearts with type 2 collagenase (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ), cells were pelleted, seeded in 10-cm FALCON polystyrene dishes (BD Biosciences), and incubated for 45 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma-Aldrich) with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics. Medium was removed to eliminate cardiomyocytes that did not attach to the non-coated plates, and these were replaced with fresh medium. Cardiac fibroblasts were allowed to grow until confluence was reached, then trypsinized, and passaged twice before use. Skin and lung fibroblasts were obtained by collagenase digestion of dorsal skin patches and lungs from the same pups used to obtain the heart fibroblasts. Dermal and lung fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum and used after two or three passages. At the time of performing the experiments, all cultures were between 70 and 90% confluent. Etoposide (Sigma) was used at 100 μm over 24 h. STS was added to the culture medium at the concentrations and times described in the figures. We added the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (Enzyme System Products, Livermore, CA) at 100 μm when indicated. For serum and glucose deprivation, cells were rinsed twice in sterile PBS and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without glucose and pyruvate (cat. no. D-5070 from Sigma). Simulated ischemia was performed by culturing cells in deprivation medium inside a hypoxic chamber (Billups-Rothenberg) in a mixture of 5% CO2 and 95% N2 following the manufacturer's instructions to attain a 0.1% oxygen concentration, and incubated at 37 °C for the time periods indicated in the figures. Quantification of Cell Death—Detection of cell death was performed by the trypan blue exclusion assay at the end of treatment. Data are expressed as percentage of cell death in treated dishes versus equally seeded control dishes at the initiation of the treatments. Apoptosis was quantified as percentage of cells showing condensed or fragmented nuclear morphology versus total nuclei after nuclear staining with bis-benzimide Hoechst H33258 dye (Sigma). Cell death and apoptosis for each experimental condition were measured in duplicate, and error bars represent the S.E. of three independent experiments. DNA fragmentation was assessed by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis as previously reported (14Sanchis D. Mayorga M. Ballester M. Comella J.X. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Preparation of Cytosolic Extracts—Cytosolic fractions were obtained at the end of the treatments by mixing pelleted cells in a buffer without detergent containing 220 mm d-mannitol and 70 mm sucrose (Sigma). Cells were incubated on ice for 25 min and subjected to a serial centrifugation protocol as previously reported (31Yuste V.J. Sanchez-Lopez I. Sole C. Encinas M. Bayascas J.R. Boix J. Comella J.X. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 126-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Purity of the cytosolic extracts were checked by Western blot detection of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as a specific marker of the cytosolic fraction, and cytochrome oxidase subunit IV (COXIV) as a marker for mitochondrial membrane contamination. Images are representative results of three independent experiments. Protein Extraction, Western Blotting, and Immunofluorescence—At the end of the treatments, cells were scraped from the culture dishes, pelleted, and washed with ice-cold PBS. After lysis in 95 °C prewarmed 125 mm Tris, 2% SDS (pH 6.8), cell lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatant was used as whole protein cell lysate. Protein concentration was then measured in total and cytosolic extracts by the Lowry assay. SDS-PAGE electrophoresis was performed, and protein was electrotransferred to Immobilon-P filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and reacted with relevant primary antibodies. Immunoblots were exposed to appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and developed with the ECL System (Biological Industries, Israel) or the SuperSignal Substrate (Pierce/Cultek). For immunofluorescence detection of cytochrome c and activated caspase-3, cells were grown in 4-well plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) and were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), rinsed twice with PBS, and processed as described (14Sanchis D. Mayorga M. Ballester M. Comella J.X. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Finally, cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were rinsed twice with PBS and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Antibodies—Primary antibodies used in this work were: rabbit polyclonals anti-rat Bcl-xL (cat. no. 610211, BD Transduction Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA), anti-caspase-3 (cat. no. AB1899, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) diluted 1:3,000, anti-human-processed caspase-3 (cat. no. 9661, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) diluted 1:2,000, anti-human Bak (cat. no. 12-01-16348, Biocarta, Hamburg, Germany) diluted 1:5,000, anti-human Bax (cat. no. 2772, Cell Signaling) diluted 1:5,000, anti-Bim (cat. no.

AAM-050, Stressgen) diluted 1:1,000. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were donkey anti-rabbit (cat. no. NA9340V, Amersham Biosciences) at 1:10,000, rabbit anti-rat (cat. no. 61-9420, Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA) at 1:5,000, and goat anti-mouse (cat. no. A9917, Sigma-Aldrich) diluted 1:10,000. For immunofluorescence, secondary antibodies were Rhodamine Red-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (code no. 715-295-150, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (cat. no. A-11008, Molecular Probes), both at 1:500. Extraction of RNA and RT-PCR of Bcl-2—Total RNA was purified with the Tri Reagent method (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) from 3 to 4 × 106 control cardiac and dermal fibroblasts, following the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of total RNA were retrotranscribed using ThermoScript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamers (Roche Applied Science). The presence of Bcl-2 transcripts was checked by PCR using the rat Bcl-2-specific primers Bcl2RnFWD 5′-TGCACCTGACGCCCTTCAC-3′ and Bcl2RnREV 5′-ACACAGCCAGGAGAAATCAAACAG-3′, which amplify a fragment of 293 bp. The annealing temperature was 58 °C, and elongation time was 30 s per cycle, in a GeneAmp PCR System 2700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). PCR products from cycles 25, 30, and 35 from retrotranscribed samples and control samples, where the RT reaction was omitted, were migrated in 2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Amplification of ribosomal gene L27 was carried out as the control for cDNA input in the amplification reaction (32Soler R.M. Dolcet X. Encinas M. Egea J. Bayascas J.R. Comella J.X. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9160-9916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bcl-2 and Bax Transfection—Human Bcl-2 gene was cloned in pcDNA3 (31Yuste V.J. Sanchez-Lopez I. Sole C. Encinas M. Bayascas J.R. Boix J. Comella J.X. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 126-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Dermal fibroblasts were transfected by electroporation (Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II) at 240 V and 500 microfarads in 0.5 ml of cold PBS with 1 μg of pcDNA3-Bcl-2, or empty vector, plus 0.3 μg of pcDNA3-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) per 105 cells. Cardiac fibroblasts were electroporated at 330 V with 1 μg of pcI-His-Bax (generously supplied by Jean-Claude Martinou, University of Geneva) or the empty vector, plus 0.3 μg of pcDNA3-EYFP. In all the vectors used, expression was driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. Transfected cultures were treated 48 h later with STS at a final concentration of 0.1 μm or serum deprivation, for 24 h. Nuclei were visualized by bis-benzimide staining in 4% PFA-fixed cells, mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and visualized with an Olympus IX70 vertical epifluorescence phase-contrast microscope. Apoptosis was counted as the percentage of transfected (green) cells showing chromatin condensation or fragmentation. Data shown are the mean of three independent experiments in duplicate. Bcl-2 Gene Silencing—The following primers were annealed by standard protocols and cloned into pSUPER.retro.puro (Oligoengine Inc., Seattle, WA) previously digested by HindIII and BglII, in order to obtain the rat-specific Bcl-2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) construct (pSRPrBcl-2i): 5′-gatccccCGAGTGGGATAACTGGAGATttcaagagaATCTCCAGTATCCCACTCttttt-3′ and 5′-agctaaaaaCGAGTGGGATACTGGAGATtctcttgaaATCTCCAGTATCCCACTCGggg-3′; or the scrambled construct (pSRPrBcl-2scr): 5′-gatccccGAGTATGAATAGCGAAGGCttcaagagaGCCTTCGCTATTCATACTCttttt-3′, and 5′-agctaaaaaGAGTATGAATAGCGAAGGCtctcttgaaGCCTTCGCTATTCATACTCggg-3′. In order to test the efficiency of the siRNA construct in repressing Bcl-2 expression, both constructs were transfected by electroporation into Rat1 rat embryonic fibroblasts (generous gift of Dr. Martín-Zanca). Stable transfected pools of Rat1 cells were obtained by puromycin selection and amplified in presence of the antibiotic. SDS-protein extracts of Bcl-2i-Rat1 and Bcl-2scr-Rat1 cells were tested for the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL by Western blot. Then, 10 μg of pSRPrBcl-2i or pSRPrBcl-2scr were co-transfected with 3 μg of pCDNA-EYFP by electroporation in 106 cardiac (330 V) or 106 dermal fibroblasts (240 V) at 500 microfarads in a volume of 0.5 ml of ice-cold PBS. Cells were then seeded in six 60-mm culture dishes and cultured in standard medium for 96 h before the initiation of the treatments, as described in the figure legend. Blind counting was adopted to minimize observer bias. Apoptosis was quantified in the cultures by counting green (transfected) cells with fragmented nuclei, visualized by Hoechst staining. Between 300 and 500 green cells were counted for each condition. Data were expressed as percent of green cells with fragmented nuclei versus total transfected cells in the culture plate. Experiments were repeated three times with independently isolated, amplified, and transfected primary fibroblasts. Statistics—Student's t test was used to compare the difference between the response of cardiac and non-cardiac fibroblasts for every experimental condition, as well as to compare the difference between control group versus treatment group in the same type of fibroblasts. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Cardiac but Not Dermal or Pulmonary Fibroblasts Are Resistant to Stimuli Inducing Mitochondria-dependent Programmed Cell Death—Cell death was measured in primary cardiac, dermal and pulmonary fibroblasts exposed to stimuli known to promote mitochondria-driven PCD: the topoisomerase-II inhibitor etoposide, which induces DNA damage (33Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3299) Google Scholar); the kinase inhibitor STS (33Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3299) Google Scholar), and serum deprivation (34Li K. Li Y. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Spencer E. Chen Z.J. Wang X. Williams R.S. Cell. 2000; 101: 389-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Cell death induced by 24 h of exposure to 100 μm etoposide, 0.1 μm STS, and serum deprivation, was more than 2–3-fold higher in pulmonary and dermal fibroblasts than in cardiac fibroblasts (Fig. 1A). The dose dependence analysis of the effect of exposure to STS for 24 h on fibroblast viability indicated that cardiac fibroblasts were less affected than dermal fibroblasts in a wide range of STS concentrations known to readily kill a number of other cell types (Fig. 1B). Nuclear fragmentation detected by bis-benzimide staining was also 2–3-fold higher in non-cardiac fibroblasts (Fig. 1C). We carried out the same treatments in wild type and Bak/Bax double knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), in parallel experiments. Indeed, cell death was completely blunted in Bak/Bax double knockout MEFs (Fig. 1B and data not shown), confirming that STS, etoposide, and serum deprivation induced cell death mainly by activating mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in fibroblasts, as has been previously reported (33Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3299) Google Scholar). These results indicate that fibroblasts of cardiac origin were more resistant than skin and lung fibroblasts to apoptotic cell death driven by the mitochondrial pathway. Cardiac Fibroblasts Do Not Attain Caspase-3 Activation nor DNA Degradation after STS Treatment and Serum Deprivation—The resistance of cardiac fibroblasts to apoptosis was confirmed by Western blot detection of the activated fragment of caspase-3, p17. STS and serum deprivation did not activate caspase-3 significantly in cardiac fibroblasts (Fig. 2A), but induced the activation of virtually the complete pool of caspase-3 in skin fibroblasts (Fig. 2B). Conventional agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA extracts from cardiac and dermal fibroblasts treated with 1 μm STS or serum deprivation showed the absence of fragmented DNA in cardiac fibroblasts, whereas laddering was obvious in DNA extracts of dermal fibroblasts (Fig. 2, C and D). The role of caspases in DNA damage induced by STS and serum deprivation was highlighted by the fact that DNA degradation was inhibited in dermal fibroblasts pretreated with 100 μm pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 2D, and data not shown). These results reveal that cardiac fibroblasts can block caspase-dependent apoptosis before entering the execution phase. Apoptotic Mitochondrial Pathway Is Blocked in Cardiac Fibroblasts before Cytochrome c Release—To provide insight into the molecular pathways involved in cardiac fibroblast relative resistance to mitochondria-driven caspase-dependent apoptosis, we analyzed the translocation of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO in control, STS-treated, and serum-deprived cells. Both treatments induced translocation of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO to the cytosolic fraction in dermal fibroblasts but not in cardiac fibroblasts (Fig. 3A). The release of pro-apoptotic factors from mitochondria (Fig. 3A) correlated with the activation of caspase-3 (Fig. 2A) and nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that cardiac fibroblast resistance to mitochondria-driven apoptosis occurs upstream of cytochrome c release. Cardiac Fibroblasts Are More Resistant than Dermal Fibroblasts to Apoptosis Induced by Simulated Ischemia—Blood flow interruption leads to a complex pathological situation termed ischemia. In addition to a drop in oxygen tension, which inactivates the respiratory chain and, therefore, impairs the efficient production of energy, ischemia also leads to a local deficiency in trophic factors, precursors, and energy-providing metabolites such as glucose. We focused on comparing the response of cardiac and dermal fibroblasts to such an adverse situation because it has been described that cardiac fibroblasts have a certain capacity to overcome heart infarction, at least for a certain time period (35Virag J.I. Murry C.E. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 2433-2440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and die, in part, by apoptosis (36Takemura G. Ohno M. Hayakawa Y. Misao J. Kanoh M. Ohno A. Uno Y. Minatoguchi S. Fujiwara T. Fujiwara H. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1130-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In our experimental model of serum and glucose deprivation plus hypoxia, dermal fibroblasts readily activated apoptosis (Fig. 4A). Activation of executioner caspases and nuclear fragmentation in dermal fibroblasts was correlated with the depletion of the cytochrome c pool (Fig. 4, B and C). Cardiac fibroblasts resisted up to 72 h of simulated ischemia (Fig. 4A), and caspase-3 activation was only detected from 72 h onwards (Fig. 4B). These data suggest that cardiac resistance to ischemia-induced apoptosis involves mechanisms acting upstream of cytochrome c release. Bcl-2 Is Expressed in Cardiac but Not in Dermal or Pulmonary Fibroblasts—Bcl-2 family proteins control the integrity of membranes in mitochondria,"

We report here the characterization, under normal and pathological conditions, of a novel thioredoxin with a germ line-restricted expression pattern, named spermatocyte/spermatid-specific thioredoxin-3 (SPTRX-3). The human SPTRX-3 gene maps at 9q32, only 50 kb downstream from the TRX-1 gene from which it probably originated as genomic duplication. Therefore, human SPTRX-3 protein comprises a unique thioredoxin domain displaying high homology with the ubiquitously expressed TRX-1. Among the tissues investigated, Sptrx-3 mRNA is found exclusively in the male germ cells at pachytene spermatocyte and round spermatid stages. Light and electron microscopy show SPTRX-3 protein to be predominately located in the Golgi apparatus of pachytene spermatocytes and round and elongated spermatids, with a transient localization in the developing acrosome of round spermatids. In addition, increased levels of SPTRX-3, possibly caused by overexpression, are observed in morphologically abnormal human spermatozoa from infertile men. In addition, SPTRX-3 is identified as a novel postobstruction autoantigen. In this report, we propose that SPTRX-3 can be used as a specific marker for diverse sperm and testis pathologies.

Thioredoxins are maintained in their reduced active form by the selenoprotein thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), which transfers electrons from NADPH. Together, NADPH, thioredoxins, and their reductases constitute the so-called thioredoxin system (1Arner E.S. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar). All organisms, from lower prokaryotes to humans, are equipped with distinct thioredoxin systems that participate in diverse cellular processes, including, among others, modulation of transcription factor-DNA binding activity, DNA synthesis, antioxidant defense, regulation of apoptosis, and immune response (1Arner E.S. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar). Most of the functions assigned to thioredoxins are dependent on their ability to behave as general protein disulfide reductases. Moreover, abnormal expression of thioredoxin and/or thioredoxin reductase genes has been correlated with a number of pathological conditions, such as cancer, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, AIDS, etc. (2Gromer S.

This complexity is paralleled by the increasing number of splicing variants of both thioredoxin reductase genes. Thus, the TrxR-1 gene has been reported to produce at least 21 different mRNAs, whose conceptual translation would result in proteins targeting the cytoplasm, mitochondria, and nucleus (10Rundlöf A.K. Jarnard M. Miranda-Vizuete A. Arnér E.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 641-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).

In addition to mammals, germ-line-specific thioredoxins have been reported in lower eukaryotic gonads, such as sea urchin spermatozoa (21Ogawa K. Takai H. Ogiwara A. Yokota E. Shimizu T. Inaba K. Mohri H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1895-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) or Drosophila melanogaster testis and ovary (22Svensson M.J. Chen J.D. Pirrotta V. Larsson J. Chromosoma. 2003; 112: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The abundance of tissue-specific thioredoxins in male germ cells reflects a key role of this family of proteins in spermatogenesis, which is further supported by the recent finding of a novel testis-specific splicing variant of cytosolic thioredoxin reductase (10Rundlöf A.K. Jarnard M. Miranda-Vizuete A. Arnér E.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 641-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and the Trx and GSSG reductase, a fusion protein of glutaredoxin and thioredoxin reductase domains predominantly expressed in testis (23Sun Q.A. Kirnarsky L. Sherman S. Gladyshev V.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3673-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Moreover, TrxR-1 and TrxR-2 mRNA levels in mouse testis are relatively high compared with other tissues such as brain, heart, or lung (24Jurado J. Prieto-Alamo M.J. Madrid-Risquez J. Pueyo C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45546-45554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The major role of the fertilizing spermatozoon is to contribute the male pronucleus to the zygote. For this purpose, the round spermatid undergoes a dramatic morphological and biochemical transformation that gives rise to the highly polarized spermatozoon, through a process known as spermiogenesis (25Oko R. Clermont Y. Neill D. Encyclopedia of Reproduction. 4. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 602-609Google Scholar). Mature spermatozoa are equipped with unique structures that are necessary for the spermatozoon to fulfill its function. For example, the nuclear DNA is linked to protamines instead of histones to promote a high degree of chromatin condensation and stability (26Eddy E.M. O′Brien D.A. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, New York1994: 29-77Google Scholar). In addition, the sperm head contains the acrosome, an enzyme-filled membrane-enclosed vesicle that is required for the sperm-egg binding and the penetration of egg vestments during fertilization (26Eddy E.M. O′Brien D.A. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, New York1994: 29-77Google Scholar). The acrosome is formed from vesicles and saccules derived from the Golgi apparatus during the initial steps of spermiogenesis (27Abou-Haila A. Tulsiani D.R. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 379: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Another important sperm-specific structure is the tail, which is responsible of energy production and mobility of the spermatozoa, and these essential tasks are achieved by the acquisition of additional cytoskeletal structures, namely the outer dense fibers and fibrous sheath, surrounding the sperm axoneme (26Eddy E.M. O′Brien D.A. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, New York1994: 29-77Google Scholar, 28Curry M.R. Watson P.F. Yovich J.L. Grudzinskas J.G. Gametes. The spermatozoon. Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK1995: 45-69Google Scholar). We report here the characterization of a novel thioredoxin, named SPTRX-3, exclusively expressed in testis and localized to the Golgi apparatus of mammalian spermatocytes and spermatids. It is interesting that SPTRX-3 is more abundant in defective spermatozoa from infertile men; in addition, it constitutes a novel sperm postobstruction autoantigen. Hence, SPTRX-3 arises as a promising marker for several pathologies associated with male reproductive physiology. cDNA Cloning of Human, Mouse and Rat Sptrx-3 Genes—The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (29Altschul S.F. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 444-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) was used to perform a survey of various databases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) to identify new entries encoding potential novel members of the thioredoxin family. Using the sequence of human TRX-1 as bait, we found the expressed sequence tag (EST) AI188241 to encode a novel human putative thioredoxin-like protein. Based on this sequence, the nested forward primers F1 (5′-GAGGCCTGGTGTAATCATGGTACAG-3′) and F2 (5′-CAACAGGGGATTTTCATCAGCACTTC-3′) were used for 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends in a human testis cDNA library (BD Biosciences Clontech). Based on the sequence obtained, the nested forward primers R1 (5′-CGAGTTTGTGTCCGGCAGCTGTC-3′) and R2 (5′-CTGTACCATGATTACACCAGGCCTC-3′) were used for 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends in the same library. The resulting sequences were used to amplify by PCR all the different variants of human SPTRX-3 from the same library. The amplification products were cloned in the pGEM-Teasy vector (Promega) and sequenced in both directions. For the mouse and rat orthologues, the same strategy was followed using human SPTRX-3 β1 sequence as bait, blasting it against the mouse and rat EST databases (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). By these means, one rat and several mouse sequences were obtained (rat EST AI764117.1 and mouse EST BY714796, BF149520.1, and AV045293.2) and used to design specific primers at the putative translation initiation and stop codons, to amplify by PCR the mouse and rat Sptrx-3 β1 open reading frames (ORFs) from a mouse or rat testis cDNA libraries (BD Biosciences Clontech) respectively. Northern Blot Analysis—Human multiple tissue Northern blots and human multiple tissue expression arrays with poly(A)+ RNA from different tissues were purchased from BD Biosciences Clontech. The human SPTRX-3 β1 ORF was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Rediprime random primer labeling kit; Amersham Biosciences) and hybridized at 65 °C overnight in ExpressHyb Solution following the protocol provided by BD Biosciences Clontech. The blots were also hybridized with human β-actin ORF as control. The blots were scanned and quantified with the Gel Pro Analyzer program (Media Cybernetics). In Situ Hybridization—For in situ hybridization, NMRI mice (aged 2, 3, and 4 weeks and 3 months) were decapitated and the testes excised. The samples were frozen on dry ice, sectioned with a Microm HM 500 cryostat at 14 μm, and thaw-mounted onto poly(l-lysine)-coated glass slides. The sections were stored at -20 °C until use. Three oligonucleotide probes (CATCTTGCTCTTCGGTCCACTTCTGAGGCAGCAC, AGATGAGTCCACATCCACCTGAGCAAACGTGAC, and CCACCACAAGCTTGTTTCCAGCATCGCTGAAC) were used. All probes produced similar results when used separately and were used simultaneously to intensify the signal. Several control probes with the same length and similar GC content and specific activity were used to determine the specificity of the hybridization. In situ hybridization was carried out as described previously (30Schultz R. Suominen J. Varre T. Hakovirta H. Parvinen M. Toppari J. Pelto-Huikko M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 767-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Antibody Production—Peptide sequences for immunization were derived from the human SPTRX-3 β1 sequence. With the added aim of inducing antigenicity in murids, two different peptides named exon I ((NH2-) MVQIIKDTNEFKTFC (-COOH)) and exon V ((Ac-) VTLFSRIKRIIC (-COOH)) were synthesized and used to immunize rabbits (Agrisera). After four immunizations, serum was collected and polyclonal antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography using 4 mg of an exon I/exon V peptide mix conjugated to UltraLink matrix from Pierce. The specificity of the antibodies was confirmed by ELISA against the peptides (data not shown) and by Western blot analysis. Immunocytochemistry—Paraffin sections containing multiple human tissues (T1065; lot 9994A) were purchased from DakoCytomation. In addition, paraffin sections of human testis were used. Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (31Rybnikova E. Damdimopoulos A.E. Gustafsson J.-Å. Spyrou G. Pelto-Huikko M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 1669-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), either by the avidin-biotin complex method or by the indirect immunofluorescence method using goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:100, 30 min; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as a secondary antibody. The processed tissue sections were embedded in phosphate-buffered saline-glycerol mixture containing 0.1% p-phenylenediamine. The sections were examined with a Nikon Microphot-FXA microscope equipped with proper fluorescent filters. Processing of Bouin's fixed and paraffin-embedded testes and subsequent immunoperoxidase staining were described previously (8Miranda-Vizuete A. Sadek C.M. Jimenez A. Krause W.J. Sutovsky P. Oko R. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2004; 6: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 32Oko R. Andrologia. 1998; 30: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), with some modifications. After deparaffinization and hydration, testicular sections were either subjected or not to an antigen retrieval microwave technique (33Shi S.R. Cote R.J. Taylor C.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 931-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar); the antigen retrieval was found to have no advantage. The slides were equilibrated in 300 mm glycine before immunolabeling was conducted using an avidin-biotin complex kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Nonspecific sites were sequentially blocked with avidin and biotin blocking serum, followed by 10% normal goat serum. Primary antibody incubations were conducted overnight at 4 °C. After washes in 25 mm Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween, sections were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (1/200) followed by incubation with ABC using standard procedures (Vector Laboratories). Peroxidase reactivity was visualized by incubation in 0.05% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine, pH 7.5, and sections were counterstained with either periodic acid Schiff (PAS) and 0.1% methylene blue or methylene blue alone. For the control, anti-SPTRX-3 antibodies were preincubated for 1 h with SPTRX-3 peptide immunogens at five times the protein concentration of the antibody dilution, before immunolabeling. Procedures for electron microscopy immunocytochemistry were described previously (8Miranda-Vizuete A. Sadek C.M. Jimenez A. Krause W.J. Sutovsky P. Oko R. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2004; 6: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified anti-SPTRX-3 antibodies were used at a 1:20 dilution, and colloidal gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG at a 1:20 dilution was the secondary antibody. Human Sperm Samples—Infertile, teratospermic samples originated from patients diagnosed with male factor infertility at the infertility clinic of CEGyR (Buenos Aires, Argentina). All 19 patients were previously diagnosed cases of severe male infertility/teratospermia with abnormally low sperm counts and poor sperm motility by WHO criteria as well as abnormally low percentage of normal sperm morphology by Krueger's strict criteria. All 19 patients and their spouses underwent in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection; only two couples achieved pregnancies, neither of which was carried to term. Control samples from five fertile donors with excellent sperm count, motility, and morphology by WHO criteria were purchased from Fairfax Cryobank. All sperm samples were collected from informed, consenting donors and handled in accordance with the protocols approved by Internal Review Boards of the University of Missouri-Columbia and CEGyR. Flow Cytometry and Epifluorescence Microscopy—Procedures were described in detail previously (34Sutovsky P. Terada Y. Schatten G. Hum. Reprod. 2001; 16: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In brief, sperm samples were thawed, washed by centrifugation through Tyrode's lactate-HEPES medium, and fixed for 40 min in 2% formaldehyde. Sperm suspensions were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked in 5% normal goat serum, collected by centrifugation, and split into two equal sperm pellets. One pellet from each donor was incubated for 40 min with the anti-SPTRX3 serum (described above; diluted 1/100), followed by goat anti-rabbit-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Zymed Laboratories; dil. 1/80). The other half was incubated with monoclonal antibody Km 691 (Kamiya Biomedical Company; diluted 1/100) against recombinant human ubiquitin, an established sperm abnormality marker (34Sutovsky P. Terada Y. Schatten G. Hum. Reprod. 2001; 16: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 35Rawe V.Y. Olmedo S.B. Benmusa A. Shiigi S.M. Chemes H.E. Sutovsky P. Hum. Reprod. 2002; 17: 2119-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 36Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar), and detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (Zymed Laboratories Inc.; diluted 1/80). Blank, negative control samples were prepared by omitting the primary antibody. Flow cytometry was performed using FACScan Analyzer (BD Biosciences), set at 488-nm wavelength. Relative levels of SPTRX3- or ubiquitin-induced fluorescence in 10,000 individual cells/sample were recorded. Scatter diagrams of visible light and histograms of antibody-induced fluorescence were generated for each sample. The median values of antibody-induced fluorescence (SPTRX-3-medians or Ubi-medians) were compared between infertility patients and fertile donors using statistical tools (analysis of variance, Pearson's correlation) in Microsoft Excel and SAS version 8.2. Each sample was also screened by epifluorescence microscopy. Ten microliters of each sperm pellet processed for flow cytometry were mounted under a coverslip on a conventional microscopy slide and photographed using Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope with high numerical aperture objectives, and a CoolSnap HQ digital camera (Roper Scientific), operated by MetaMorph imaging software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Images were archived on recordable CDs and printed on a Stylus Photo 1280 printer (Epson America) using Photoshop 6.0 software (Adobe Systems). Western Blot Analysis—Elutriated rat germ cells were prepared according to Higgy et al. (37Higgy N.A. Zackson S.L. van der Hoorn F.A. Dev. Genet. 1995; 16: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Elutriated fractions, of ∼90% purity, were obtained for elongated spermatids, round spermatids, and spermatocytes. Rat spermatozoa were obtained from the epididymis and their heads and tails separated and isolated by sonication and gradient centrifugation, respectively, as described by Oko (32Oko R. Andrologia. 1998; 30: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The different cell fractions, spermatozoa, and sperm components were boiled for 10 min in sample buffer containing 2% SDS without reducing agent and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min. 5% β-mercaptoethanol was then added to the isolated supernatant before boiling again and running the supernatant on a 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schüll), and the immunoreactivity was detected with peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) diluted 1:10,000 (v/v) using enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) with exposure to x-ray films. Most mammalian species, including rats, make anti-sperm autoantibodies after obstruction of the male reproductive tract by vasectomy (38Alexander N.J. Anderson D.J. Fertil. Steril. 1979; 32: 253-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we used postvasectomy rat sera in Western blotting experiments to test whether Sptrx-3 was recognized by postobstruction autoantibodies and could thus be identified as a post-obstruction autoantigen. Adult male Lewis rats weighing 225–275g (Charles River Laboratories) received a bilateral vasectomy under general anesthesia as described previously (39Flickinger C.J. Bush L.A. Williams M.V. Naaby-Hansen S. Howards S.S. Herr J.C. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1999; 43: 35-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Sera were collected immediately before the vasectomy and 3 months after the operation. Procedures were conducted with the approval of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Virginia School of Medicine and in accordance with the National Institutes of Health's Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and other relevant publications. Cauda epididymal spermatozoa were obtained by back-flushing fluid from the vas deferens (39Flickinger C.J. Bush L.A. Williams M.V. Naaby-Hansen S. Howards S.S. Herr J.C. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1999; 43: 35-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were performed as described previously (19Miranda-Vizuete A. Tsang K. Yu Y. Jimenez A. Pelto-Huikko M. Flickinger C.J. Sutovsky P. Oko R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44874-44885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Transient Transfection of Human SPTRX-3 in Eukaryotic Cells—The pBI-EGFP vector (BD Biosciences Clontech) was used to express human SPTRX-3 from a bidirectional promoter, where simultaneous green fluorescent protein expression gives an accurate indication of the transfection efficiency (∼60%). The mutagenic primers: 5′-GAGGACGCGTGCCACCATGGTACAGATTATTAAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTTGGCTAGCTTATTACATTAATTCTTGAG-3′ (reverse) were used to amplify human SPTRX-3 from pGEM-Te/SPTRX-3. The forward primer introduced an MluI site followed by a Kozac sequence (40Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar), and the reverse primer introduced an NheI site. The amplified DNA was cloned into the MluI-NheI sites of pBI-EGFP expression vector, and Escherichia coli TOP-10 F′ strain was transformed with the recombinant plasmid pBI-EGFP/SPTRX-3. The plasmid was purified using the midiprep kit (QIAGEN) and sequenced. Identical strategy was used with TRX-1 as a control in all experiments. Transfection experiments were performed with 1 μg of DNA diluted in 10 μl of H2O and 0.5 μl of 0.1 m polyethylenimine (Sigma-Aldrich). The preparation was mixed thoroughly, incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and subsequently added to the medium and applied onto human embryonic kidney 293 cells. The green fluorescent protein images were acquired with a Leica laser scanning confocal microscope using the 488 nm line of an ArKr laser, and emitted light was collected at the 500–540 nm wavelength range. Enzymatic Activity Assays—Enzymatic activity of SPTRX-3 was determined by its capability to reduce insulin disulfide bonds using NADPH as electron donor in the presence of human thioredoxin reductase. The activity assay was performed essentially as described elsewhere (14Spyrou G. Enmark E. Miranda-Vizuete A. Gustafsson J.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2936-2941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In both cases, human TRX-1 was used as control. cDNA Cloning, Sequence Analysis, Genomic Organization and Chromosomal Localization of Human, Mouse, and Rat Sptrx-3 Genes—By sequence comparison with human TRX-1 gene, we found that GenBank EST AI188241 (from human testis) encoded a putative novel thioredoxin sequence containing the conserved CGPC active site motif. Based on this sequence, we designed primers to perform 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis using a human test"
https://openalex.org/W2030313200,"Flavodoxins are involved in a variety of electron transfer reactions that are essential for life. Although FMN-binding proteins are well characterized in prokaryotic organisms, information is scarce for eukaryotic flavodoxins. We describe the 2.0-Å resolution crystal structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae YLR011w gene product, a predicted flavoprotein. YLR011wp indeed adopts a flavodoxin fold, binds the FMN cofactor, and self-associates as a homodimer. Despite the absence of the flavodoxin key fingerprint motif involved in FMN binding, YLR011wp binds this cofactor in a manner very analogous to classical flavodoxins. YLR011wp closest structural homologue is the homodimeric Bacillus subtilis Yhda protein (25% sequence identity) whose homodimer perfectly superimposes onto the YLR011wp one. Yhda, whose function is not documented, has 53% sequence identity with the Bacillus sp. OY1–2 azoreductase. We show that YLR011wp has an NAD(P)H-dependent FMN reductase and a strong ferricyanide reductase activity. We further demonstrate a weak but specific reductive activity on azo dyes and nitrocompounds. Flavodoxins are involved in a variety of electron transfer reactions that are essential for life.

We further demonstrate a weak but specific reductive activity on azo dyes and nitrocompounds. The most frequently used cofactors in enzymatic redox reactions are the pyridine (NAD and NADP) and the flavin (FAD and FMN) nucleotides. Although NAD and NADP are soluble cofactors used by dehydrogenases, FAD and FMN usually work as prosthetic groups in flavoproteins to which they are tightly bound. Flavodoxins are small monomeric flavoproteins (15–22 kDa) that noncovalently bind a single FMN molecule, acting as a redox center (1Simondsen R.P. Tollin G. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1980; 33: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The flavodoxin scaffold contributes to the mechanism of electron transfer by stabilizing the FMN molecule in an environment that promotes the highly negative redox potential required for its biochemical activity. This is accomplished by sandwiching the FMN ring between two hydrophobic side chains. Flavodoxins are involved in a variety of electron transfer reactions that are essential in the metabolism of pyruvate (2Blaschkowski H.P. Neuer G. Ludwig-Festl M. Knappe J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), nitrogen, and pyridine nucleotides (3Bianchi V. Eliasson R. Fontecave M. Mulliez E. Hoover D.M. Matthews R.G. Reichard P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These enzymes exist under three redox states: oxidized; partially reduced (semiquinone); and fully reduced (hydroquinone). Until now, flavodoxins have been identified in many prokaryotes and also in some eukaryotic algae (4Fukuyama K. Matsubara H. Rogers L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 775-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 5Drennan C.L. Pattridge K.A. Weber C.H. Metzger A.L. Hoover D.M. Ludwig M.L. J. Mol.

In mammalian systems, flavodoxins have only been found as domains inserted in larger redox proteins such as cytochrome P450 reductase where they act as the electron transport intermediate between FAD and the P450 iron center (7Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S. Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Flavodoxin-like domains are also found in mammalian nitric-oxide synthase (8White K.A. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6627-6631Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) and in human erythrocyte NADPH-flavin reductase (9Chikuba K. Yubisui T. Shirabe K. Takeshita M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 1170-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae YLR011w open reading frame codes for a protein of unknown function that has been found to be up-regulated in response to low temperature exposure (10Zhang L. Ohta A. Horiuchi H. Takagi M. Imai R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The sequence belongs to a COG4530 (Cluster of Orthologous Genes) predicted to generally contain flavoproteins. Hence, the YLR011wp 21-kDa protein was proposed to be composed of a single domain present in NADPH-dependent FMN reductases. We have solved the 2-Å resolution crystal structure, confirming that it adopts a flavodoxin fold and binds the FMN cofactor. YLR011wp exists as a dimer in the crystal as well as in solution. The YLR011wp closest structural homologue is the Bacillus subtilis Yhda protein (Protein Data Bank code 1NNI) (11Suzuki Y. Yoda T. Ruhul A. Sugiura W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9059-9065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), whose function is not documented but has 53% sequence identity with the Bacillus sp. OY1–2 azoreductase. These enzymes are responsible for the reductive cleavage of azo dyes. Organisms producing azoreductase present a biotechnological interest for the early step in detoxification of industrial dyes. This type of activity has not been reported before in S. cerevisiae. Therefore, we have attempted to characterize YLR011wp reductase activity by testing different azo dyes and nitrocompounds but also ferricyanide as electron acceptors. Cloning and Purification—The YLR011w open reading frame DNA was amplified by PCR using oligodeoxynucleotides synthesized by MWG Biotech and cloned between the NdeI and NotI sites of pET29 vector from Novagen. The expression strain Rosetta was obtained from Novagen. 2× YT medium (5 g of NaCl, 16 g of Bactotryptone; 10 g of yeast extract) was purchased from BIO 101, Inc., and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was purchased from Sigma. Transformed Rosetta cells were grown at 37 °C up to an A600 nm of 1. Expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the cells were grown for a further 12 h at 15 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) at 4 °C. Cells were lysed by 3 cycles of freeze-thawing and 30 s of sonication and then were centrifuged. The His-tagged proteins were purified using a Ni2+ affinity column (Qiagen Inc.) according to the standard protocols. Eluted protein was further purified by gel filtration using a Superdex™ 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated against the buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, and 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The purity of the pooled fractions was checked by SDS-PAGE, and the integrity of the protein samples was checked by mass spectrometry. Selenium Met (Se-Met) 1The abbreviations used are: Se-Met, selenium Met; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. -labeled proteins were prepared as follows. Transformed cells were grown in M63 medium at 37 °C up to an A600 nm of 1. The culture then was complemented with a mixture of amino acids (l-Lys, l-Phe, and l-Thr at 100 mg/liter and l-Ile, l-Leu, l-Val, and l-Se-Met at 50 mg/liter) within 30 min, and the recombinant protein was overexpressed by the addition of 0.3 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside within 12 h at 15 °C. The protein was purified as described above. Seleno-methionine incorporation into the protein was >95% as assayed by mass spectrometry. Crystallization and Resolution of the Structure—Native and Se-Met labeled protein samples were stored in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, and 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Prior to crystallization screenings, 20 mm CaCl2 and 2 mm FMN were added to the protein solutions. Crystals of both the native and Se-Met-labeled protein were grown from a 1:1-μl mixture of protein (6 mg/ml) with 10–15% polyethylene glycol 3000, 20% polyethylene glycol 400, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5 (reservoir solution). Crystals with a maximal size of 100–200 μm appeared within 3 days. For data collection, the crystals were frozen in liquid nitrogen after soaking in cryoprotectant buffer containing 10% polyethylene glycol 3000, 30% polyethylene glycol 400, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Crystals of the native and Se-Met labeled proteins diffracted to 1.9 and 2.3 Å, respectively (beamline BM30A at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France) (12Roth M. Carpentier P. Kaikati O. Joly J. Charrault P. Pirocchi M. Kahn R. Fanchon E. Jacquamet L. Borel F. Bertoni A. Israel-Gouy P. Ferrer J.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The structure was determined using single wavelength anomalous dispersion x-ray diffraction data collected from the Se-Met derivative crystal. Data were processed using the HKL package (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The space group was P21212 with two molecules per asymmetric unit. Two selenium atom sites of three were found for each monomer with the program SOLVE in the 80–2.8-Å resolution range (14Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). After solvent flattening and phase extension to a 2.3-Å resolution with the program RESOLVE (15Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), the quality of the electron density map allowed the manual construction of most of the secondary structure elements with the TURBO molecular modeling program (16.Roussel, A., and Cambillau, C. (1989) pp. 77-78, Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CAGoogle Scholar). The model was completed using iterative cycles of model building using TURBO and refinement with the REFMAC program (17Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). The final model contains residues 1–185 from monomer A, residues 2–30 and 39–186 from monomer B, two FMN molecules, two calcium ions, and 111 water molecules. All of these residues have well defined electron density and fall within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot as defined by the program PROCHECK (18Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar).

NAD(P)H oxidization was followed at 30 °C by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm (ϵM = 6.22 mm-1 cm-1). Azoreductase assay was performed in a reaction mixture (1 ml) containing 35 μm azo dye, 100 μm NADH or NADPH, 20 μm FMN, and 2.4 μm of enzyme in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The reaction was run at 30 °C, and the initial rate was determined by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at optimal wavelength for each azo dye tested as a substrate: 430 nm for Methyl Red (4-(dimethylamino)azobenzene-2′-carboxylic acid); 450 nm for Ethyl Red (4-(diethylamino)azobenzene-2′-carboxylic acid); 485 nm for Orange II (4-(2-hydroxy-1-naphthylazo)-benzenesulfonic acid); and 597 nm for Reactive Black 5. NAD(P)H-ferricyanide reductase assay was performed in a reaction mixture (1 ml) consisting of 150 μm NADH or NADPH, 100 μm ferricyanide (potassium hexacyanoferrate(III), K3Fe(CN)6) and 9 nm of enzyme in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Ferricyanide reduction was followed at 30 °C by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 420 nm (ϵM = 1 mm-1 cm-1). The effect of FMN on YFL011wp NAD(P)H-ferricyanide reductase activity was tested by the addition of 20 μm FMN to the reaction mixture. YLR011wp was also assayed for nitroreductase activity. The reaction mixture and protocol were identical as for the ferricyanide reductase assay with the exception that ferricyanide was replaced by nitrofurazone and activity was monitored by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 400 nm (ϵM = 12.96 mm-1 cm-1). Overall Structure—The crystal structure of the 21-kDa YLR011w protein was solved by single wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing using Se-Met-substituted protein crystals. The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains two YLR011wp molecules with identical structures (the r.m.s.d. for 229 Cα positions is 0.44 Å). Refinement of the structure against 2-Å resolution native data yielded R and Rfree factors of 20.4 and 26%, respectively. All of the residues of the final model are well defined in the 2Fo - Fc electron density map and occupy favorable regions of the Ramachandran plot as defined by PROCHECK (18Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). All of the refinement data are gathered in Table I. The YLR011wp monomer is a globular α/β protein of approximate dimensions of 50 × 30 × 30 Å3. The structure of the YLR011wp has a single domain flavodoxin-like architecture with a central five-stranded parallel β-sheet (strand order β2, β1, β3, β4, and β5) flanked by helices α1 and α5 on one side and by three helices (α2–α4) on the other side (Fig. 1a). Searches for the closest structural analogues of YLR011wp using the EBI Macromolecular structure data base (www.ebi.ac.uk/msd/) revealed good matches (Z score values between 6.5 and 6. 9) with many flavodoxin proteins such as B. subtilis Yhda protein (25% sequence identity, r.m.s.d. of 1.8 Å over 143 Cα positions) (Protein Data Bank code 1NNI) and flavodoxins from the cyanobacterium Anabaena (14% sequence identity, r.m.s.d. of 1.9 Å over 118 Cα positions) (19Rao S.T. Shaffie F. Yu C. Satyshur K.A. Stockman B.J. Markley J.L. Sundarlingam M. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1413-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and from Helicobacter pylori (17% sequence identity, r.m.s.d. of 1.9 Å over 117 Cα positions) (6Freigang J. Diederichs K. Schafer K.P. Welte W. Paul R. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Flavodoxins have been classified into two subfamilies: 1) short-chain flavodoxins, which are roughly 150 residues long, and 2) long-chain flavodoxins with an insertion of ∼20 amino acid residues in the middle of the last strand of the β-sheet (20Mayhew S.G. Ludwig M.L. Flavodoxins and Electron-transferring Flavoproteins. Academic Press, New York, NY1975Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Although YLR011wp is made up of 191 residues, its final β-strand (β5 in Fig. 1a) has no insert and hence this protein belongs to the short-chain flavodoxin subfamily. The extra 40 amino acid residues of YLR011wp are part of two other insertions relative to classical short-chain flavodoxins. The first insertion (Leu45-Leu85) is found in the segment connecting strands β2 and β3 and containing helix α2. This region is longer by 30 amino acids compared with classical flavodoxins. The N-terminal part of this segment is involved in homodimer formation (see below). The second 10-residue insertion (Pro156-Ile166) is found in the linker between strand β5 and the C-terminal helix α5. These two insertions are located at each extremity of the YLR011wp monomer. Because of the head-to-tail organization of the homodimer (see below), the first insertion from monomer A is facing the second insertion from monomer B (Fig. 2a). This dimer contact forms a closed lid that completely hides the dimethyl benzene part of the isoalloxazine moiety of the FMN molecule (see below). FMN Binding—Because YLR011wp sequence analysis suggests that it is entirely made up by a FMN binding domain as found in the NADPH-dependent FMN reductases, we incubated the protein with 2 mm FMN prior to the initial crystallization screening. During refinement of the structure, inspection of the electron density maps clearly revealed the presence of a bound FMN cofactor in each monomer. As observed for other flavodoxins, the cofactor lies on top of the C-terminal end of the YLR011wp central β-sheet inside a positively charged pocket (Fig. 1a). The FMN phosphoribityl moiety is deeply buried in the protein, whereas the isoalloxazine ring remains partially accessible to the solvent. Each FMN is in contact with both monomers, and only 10% of its surface is solvent-accessible. The main contribution of YLR011wp to FMN binding comes from three loops. The linker that is connecting strand β1 to helix α1 is in contact with the phosphoribityl moiety, whereas the loops between strand β3 and helix α3 and between strand β4 and helix α4 are interacting with both FMN parts. In total, each FMN molecule forms 12 direct hydrogen bonds (Table II) and shields 570 Å2 of its surface from the solvent upon complex formation with the homodimer.Table IIComparison of the polar contacts involved in FMN bindingYLR011wpProteinFMNDistanceÅSer9 Oγ[ρ]O2P2.4Arg11 Nϵ[ρ]O2P3.2Arg11 Nη[ρ]1O3P3Val15 NO3P3Cys16 NO1P3.1Tyr95 Oη[ρ]O2P2.7Tyr124 Oη[ρ]O1P2.5Gln94 Oϵ1N33Asn96 NN52.8Asn96 NO43Trp97 NO43.2Gly126 NO23Classical flavodoxinsaClassical flavodoxins are those that possess the flavodoxin key fingerprint motif (T/S)XTGXT.

Water-mediated hydrogen bonds were not considered Open table in a new tab The isoalloxazine ring is mainly in contact with residues from the loops connecting strand β3 to helix α3 (Pro93-Trp97) and strand β4 to helix α4 (Gly125-Gly129), completed by contacts with Ile60 and Asp108 from the other monomer. It is stabilized by five direct hydrogen bonds with the protein and has three water molecules bound. The pyrimidine end of the isoalloxazine is hydrogen-bonded to the Gln94 side chain (N3 atom from FMN) and to three main chain amide groups (Asn96 H-bonds to FMN N5 and O4 atoms, whereas Trp97 and Gly126 H-bond to FMN O4 and O2 atoms, respectively). The re-face of the isoalloxazine ring lies against the hydrophobic side chain from Tyr95, whereas its partly solvent-exposed si-face is in contact with Ile60 from the neighbor monomer. The phosphoribityl moiety of the molecule is mainly stabilized by electrostatic interactions (Fig. 1b). The ribitol part of the FMN molecule directly interacts with Arg11, Val15, Pro93, Tyr124, Gly125, and Val157. Two oxygen atoms (O2* and O4*) from this FMN moiety are indirectly hydrogen-bonded to the protein backbone by water molecules. The FMN O4* atom is hydrogen-bonded to three residues from the second insertion region, i.e. the loop connecting strand β5 to helix α5 (Gly 58 amide and Pro156 and Thr159 carbonyls), whereas its O2* atom forms H-bonds with Gln94 amide and Tyr124 carbonyl groups. The FMN phosphate group forms a bidentate salt bridge with Arg11 and five hydrogen bonds (Fig. 1, b and c, and Table II) with the Ser9, Tyr95, and Tyr124 hydroxyl groups as well as with the Val15 and Cys16 amides from the β1–α1 loop. This latter loop is the most invariant feature of the flavodoxin fold. It bears the flavodoxin key fingerprint motif ((T/S)XTGXT), which is always involved in interaction with the FMN phosphate moiety (5Drennan C.L. Pattridge K.A. Weber C.H. Metzger A.L. Hoover D.M. Ludwig M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the S. cerevisiae YLR011wp FMN phosphate binding loop sequence (SVRAKRVC) (Fig. 3) does not match the flavodoxin signature and is longer by 2 residues. This results in a clearly different conformation from that of the canonical loop (r.m.s.d of the Cα atoms of the key fingerprint motif around 3 Å between YLR011wp and flavodoxins), whereas this region varies by <1 Å within the more classical flavodoxins. Despite these differences, the YLR011wp FMN phosphate binding pocket is reminiscent of the corresponding pocket in the typical flavodoxin proteins (Table II). In flaxodoxins, the FMN phosphate oxygens are in interaction with the amide groups of the five residues (XTGXT) from the loop motif as well as with the Oγ1 and Nϵ1 atoms of Thr14 and Trp57, two invariant residues in bacterial flavodoxins (Fig. 1d). In YLR011wp, only two hydrogen bonds are made with the amide groups (Val15 and Cys16 in place of Val13 and Thr14) but Arg11 Nϵ and Nη1 atoms replace the amide groups from residues at positions 10 and 11 (Gln and Thr in the case of Anacystis nidulans) (5Drennan C.L. Pattridge K.A. Weber C.H. Metzger A.L. Hoover D.M. Ludwig M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (Table II and Fig. 1, c and d). Similarly, residues Thr14 and Trp57, which are invariant in classical flavodoxins but not conserved in YLR011wp (Fig. 3), are substituted by Tyr124 and Tyr95 (this Tyr95 is invariant in YLR011wp orthologues) hydroxyl groups as hydrogen bond donor. The vast majority of flavodoxin domains whose structure is known have the six-residue-long flavodoxin key fingerprint motif ((T/S)XTGXT) in common. The sequence of the fingerprint motif of rubredoxin-oxygen reductase from Desulfovibrio gigas deviates from the canonical motif, but this does not affect the FMN binding mode (21Frazao C. Silva G. Gomes C.M. Matias P. Coelho R. Sieker L. Macedo S. Liu M.Y. Oliveira S. Teixeira M. Xavier A.V. Rodrigues-Pousada C. Carrondo M.A. Le Gall J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1041-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The structure of YLR011wp presents a yet unobserved variation of the flavodoxin loop in FMN-binding proteins. Although the flavodoxin loop of yeast YLR011wp and B. subtilis Yhda is longer by two residues, both bind the FMN phosphate in a manner similar to other flavodoxins. A sequence motif search for this YLR011wp loop only revealed its presence in a Schizosaccharomyces pombe orthologue (46% sequence identity with YLR011wp) (Fig. 3) and putative reductases from Streptomyces and Bordetella (having an ∼36% sequence identity). Oligomerization State—Analytical gel-filtration chromatography revealed that YLR011wp exists as a dimer in solution (data not shown). The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains two copies of the molecule related by a 2-fold symmetry axis. The contact area between these two molecules in the asymmetric unit is 2900 Å2, strongly suggesting that this configuration corresponds to the biologically relevant dimer (22Janin J. Rodier F. Proteins. 1995; 23: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This observation is unexpected as most flavodoxin-related proteins, whose structures have been solved, are monomeric (6Freigang J. Diederichs K. Schafer K.P. Welte W. Paul R. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 23Watenpaugh K.D. Sieker L.C. Jensen L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The homodimer has a half-cylinder-like shape with approximate dimensions of 75 × 45 × 40 Å3 and a large flat solvent-exposed surface. Dimerization occurs mainly via anti-parallel side to side packing of helices α3 and α4 of each monomer (Fig. 2a). 21 residues from each monomer are involved in dimer formation. These residues belong to the linkers connecting strand β2 to helix α2 (insertion I: Leu45; Ala49-Tyr53; and Ile60) and strand β3 to helix α3 (Tyr95-Tyr99) but also to helices α3 (Ala101, Ala102, Lys104, Asn105, and Asp108) and α4 (Gln135, Glu138, Val139, Gly142, and Leu143). This interface is mainly formed by the packing of hydrophobic residues supplemented by fourteen hydrogen bonds (Table III).Table IIIPolar and charged interactions involved in dimerization1st molecule2nd moleculeDistanceÅAla50 OTyr53 Oη[ρ]2.4Tyr53 Oη[ρ]Ala50 O2.3Tyr95 OLys104 Nζ[ρ]2.9Asn96 Nδ2Asp108 Oδ22.7Tyr99 OLys104 Nζ[ρ]2.7Tyr99 Oη[ρ]Gln135 Oϵ12.8Lys104 Nζ[ρ]Tyr95 O2.8Lys104 Nζ[ρ]Tyr99 O2.8Asp108 Oδ2Asn96 Nδ22.9Gln135 OGln135 Nϵ22.9Gln135 Oϵ1Tyr99 Oη[ρ]2.7Gln135 Nϵ2Gln138 Oϵ12.9Gln135 Nϵ2Gln135 O2.9Glu138 Oϵ1Gln135 Nϵ22.8 Open table in a new tab Most of these residues are either absent or not conserved in the monomeric bacterial flavodoxin sequences. However, some other FMN-binding proteins do exist as homodimers. This is the case for Vibrio harveyi flavin reductase P (25Tanner J.J. Lei B. Tu S.C. Krause K.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13531-13539Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), Escherichia coli nitroreductase NfsA (33Schroder I. Johnson E. de Vries S. FEMS Microbiol.

Biol. 2000; 7: 1041-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), B. subtilis Yhda (Protein Data Bank code 1NNI), and probably also for the E. coli Trp repressor-binding protein WrbA (26Yang W. Ni L. Somerville R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5796-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and S. cerevisiae Ycp4 (27Toda T. Shimanuki M. Saka Y. Yamano H. Adachi Y. Shirakawa M. Kyogoku Y. Yanagida M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5474-5484Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), whose structures are still unknown. A comparison of these dimer structures revealed that E. coli NfsA and V. harveyi flavin reductase P, which share a 52% sequence identity, can be superimposed with an r.m.s.d. as low as 1 Å. As expected from the lack of significant structural resemblance between NfsA (or flavin reductase P) and YLR011wp monomers, the NfsA (or flavin reductase P) and YLR011wp homodimers do not match at all. For the D. gigas rubredoxin-oxygen reductase enzyme homodimer, no significant structural alignment can be found with other homodimeric FMN-binding proteins. Among these proteins, the bacterial Yhda is the only one to adopt the same quaternary structure as YLR011wp (r.m.s.d. of 1.5 Å for 260 Cα positions) (aligned dimer structures are represented in Fig. 2b). This is supported by a high degree of sequence conservation for most of the residues involved in homodimer formation (Fig. 3). Hence, all of the Yhda homologous proteins described in Bacillus subspecies should adopt the same dimer architecture as Yhda and S. cerevisiae YLR011wp. YLR011wp Exhibits Various NAD(P)H-dependent Reductase Activities—Sequence analysis of YLR011wp, whose function is not annotated, assigned this protein to the NADPH-dependent FMN reductase family. The present crystal structure of YLR011wp with bound FMN indeed confirms that it belongs to the flavodoxin family. To our view, YLR011wp forms an interesting test case for deriving biochemical function from the three-dimensional structure. We first have assayed the enzyme for NAD(P)H-dependent FMN reductase activity by following NAD(P)H oxidation at 340 nm. YLR011wp was able to oxidize NADH and NADPH with a slight preference for the latter. The reaction was strictly dependent on exogenously added FMN (Fig. 4). The specific activity of 0.9 μmol of NADPH oxidized/min/mg protein was measured, a value coherent with FMN reductase-specific activities described for Salmonella typhimurium nitroreductase (28Watanabe M. Nishino T. Takio K. Sofuni T. Nohmi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23922-23928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and E. coli NfsA and NfsB nitroreductases (29Zenno S. Koike H. Kumar A.N. Jayaraman R. Tanokura M. Saigo K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4508-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In many enzymes with NAD(P)H-dependent activity, the FMN reduction step is a prerequisite to additional reductive reaction in which FMNH2 acts as an electron donor (Fig. 5a). Therefore, if YLR011wp has a natural acceptor for electron transfer via FMN, the FMN reductase activity detected reflects either the reduction of free oxidized FMN via enzyme-bound FMN (Fig. 5b) or the rapid exchange reaction between the reduced and oxidized forms of FMN at the protein FMN binding site (Fig. 5c). This latter exchange reaction might not occur when a suitable downstream electron acceptor is present.Fig. 5General reaction schemes involving NAD(P)H and FMN.a, reaction catalyzed by NAD(P)H- and FMN-dependent oxidoreductases. b and c, two alternative reactions leading to NAD(P)H-dependent FMN reductase activity: 1) reduction of free FMN via enzyme-bound FMNH2 (b) or 2) exchange reaction between reduced and oxidized forms of FMN at FMN binding site (c).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have screened several compounds as electron acceptor candidates for NAD(P)H- and FMN-dependent reduction. We first investigated the YLR011wp capacity to reduce azo dyes in vitro. This assumption was based on the close structural resemblance between YLR011wp and B. subtilis Yhda that has a 52.8% amino acid sequence identity with the azoreductase from Bacillus sp. OY1–2 (11Suzuki Y. Yoda T. Ruhul A. Sugiura W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9059-9065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These proteins also share a similar FMN binding mode that is different from that of classical flavodoxins. In both proteins, the FMN binding site presents the best-conserved surface patch (Figs. 2c and 3). Furthermore, B. subtilis Yhda and YLR011wp form identical homodimers (Fig. 2b) clearly distinct from quaternary structure arrangements observed for all of the other flavodoxins. Azoreductase assays were performed with a set of four commercially available azo dyes as putative substrate. No activity could be detected with Methyl Red, Orange II, or Reactive Black 5. Clear azoreductase activity could only be demonstrated with Ethyl Red. The decrease in absorbance at 450 nm was dependent on the simultaneous presence of YLR011wp and NADH in the reaction mixture (data not shown). This activity was not dependent on the nature of the electron donor, because both NADH and NADPH gave similar results (data not shown). Ethyl Red reductase activity was almost zero in the absence of exogenously added FMN but could be totally restored by the addition of FMN during the assay (Fig. 6). These data strongly suggest that FMN is necessary for YLR011wp azoreductase activity and that the electron transfer from NAD(P)H to Ethyl Red occurs via FMN. The YLR011wp azoreductase-specific activity measured from our experiments (2–3 nmol of Ethyl Red reduced/min/mg) is several orders of magnitude below the specific activities described for bacterial azoreductases (from a few tens of nmol of azo dye reduced/min/mg up to mmol/min/mg depending on enzyme and substrate) (11Suzuki Y. Yoda T. Ruhul A. Sugiura W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9059-9065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 30Chen H. Wang R.F. Cerniglia C.E.

Biophys. 2003; 413: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Therefore, Ethyl Red, although reduced specifically by YLR011wp, probably does not represent the physiological substrate for YLR011wp. E. coli NfsA and NfsB nitroreductases are two other examples of enzymes exhibiting weak azo-dependent and standard NAD(P)H-dependent FMN reductase activities but strong ferricyanide reductase activity (29Zenno S. Koike H. Kumar A.N. Jayaraman R. Tanokura M. Saigo K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4508-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have tested YLR011wp for ferricyanide and nitroreductase activities. As illustrated in Fig. 7, ferricyanide reductase activity was unambiguously detected and, in our assay, NADPH was a more efficient donor than NADH. The presence of 20 μm FMN during the assay increased sensibly the rate of the reaction. Therefore, as already mentioned for YLR011wp azoreductase activity, the electron transfer from NAD(P)H to the ferricyanide acceptor occurs via FMN. Ferricyanide proved to be an excellent acceptor as a specific activity of 625 μmol of ferricyanide reduced/min/mg was calculated from the assay with NADPH as a donor and 20 μm FMN (Fig. 7). This level of ferricyanide reductase activity is comparable with the levels described for NfsA and NfsB nitroreductases (29Zenno S. Koike H. Kumar A.N. Jayaraman R. Tanokura M. Saigo K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4508-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, only very weak nitroreductase activity could be detected with YLR011wp using nitrofurazone as an electron acceptor compared with that of NfsA and NfsB (10–20 nmol/min/mg for YLR011wp and 73 and 13 μmol/min/mg for NfsA and NfsB, respectively). From these enzymatic data, it is still difficult to conclude on the precise biochemical function of YLR011wp. Although several specific reductase activities have been characterized using NAD(P)H as an electron donor and FMN as a cofactor, only ferricyanide reductase assays gave high specific activity. We propose that ferric iron, present in the ferricyanide complex, may be the natural substrate for the reduction catalyzed by this protein. Ferric iron reduction is the central reaction in cellular iron metabolism. Microbial cells have developed different systems for iron uptake (33Schroder I. Johnson E. de Vries S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 427-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, Arn1–4 permeases import extracellular ferric chelates and iron siderophores, whereas Frt1 plasma membrane transporter is specific for free ferric iron. In both cases, the cell indeed has to convert cytosolic ferric iron (free or chelated) into ferrous iron before its incorporation into heme- and nonheme iron-containing proteins. The cytosolic protein responsible for ferric iron reduction is still unknown despite previous biochemical studies (34Lesuisse E. Crichton R.R. Labbe P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1038: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). From our data, YLR011wp is a good candidate for cytosolic ferric iron reductase activity in yeast and further experiments are needed to reinforce this hypothesis. In conclusion, we clearly show that YLR011wp is a flavodoxin that binds an FMN cofactor despite the absence of the flavodoxin key fingerprint motif ((T/S)XTGXT) usually involved in FMN phosphate binding. The protein exists as a homodimer in the crystal as well as in solution. The biochemical studies aimed to identify YLR011wp in vivo activity showed that the protein bears several reductase activities that are NAD(P)H-dependent and involve FMN as a cofactor. Ferricyanide was by far the best substrate for reduction, strongly suggesting that this protein could be involved in ferric iron assimilation."

It is known that the metallocluster FeMo-cofactor located within the nitrogenase MoFe protein component provides the site of substrate reduction, but the exact site where substrates bind and are reduced on the FeMo-cofactor remains unknown. We have recently shown that the α-70 residue of the MoFe protein plays a significant role in defining substrate access to the active site; α-70 approaches one face of the FeMo-cofactor, and when valine is substituted by alanine at this position, the substituted nitrogenase is able to accommodate a reduction of the larger alkyne propargyl alcohol (HC≡CCH2OH, propargyl-OH). During this reduction, a substrate-derived intermediate can be trapped on the FeMo-cofactor resulting in an S = 1/2 spin system with a novel electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum.

The MoFe protein contains two metalloclusters called the P-cluster [8Fe–7S] and the FeMo-cofactor [7Fe–9S–Mo–X–homocitrate], where X is proposed to be nitrogen, carbon, or oxygen (3Einsle O.

Some models propose binding and reduction of substrates at the molybdenum atom, whereas others suggest binding and reduction of substrates at one or more of the six iron atoms that constitute the central portion of the FeMo-cofactor.

It has been demonstrated that substitution of α-70Val, a residue that approaches one Fe4S4 face of the FeMo-cofactor (involving iron atoms 2, 3, 6, and 7), by amino acids with smaller side chains expands the substrate specificity to include larger alkynes (12Christiansen J.

Using 13C- and 1/2H-labeled propargyl-OH and electron nuclear double resonance spectroscopic methods, we have recently deduced that the trapped intermediate has two hydrogen atoms added (i.e. allyl alcohol, H2C=CHCH2OH) and is bound to iron such that the two terminal hydrogen atoms are spectroscopically indistinguishable, suggesting the bio-organometallic complex shown in Scheme 1 (17Lee H.I.

The α-70Ala and α-70Ala/α-195Gln variant MoFe proteins were purified using a poly(His)-metal affinity chromatography system described earlier (18Christiansen J. Goodwin P.J. Lanzilotta W.N.

The wild-type iron protein component of nitrogenase was purified essentially as described previously (19Burgess B.K. Jacobs D.B. Stiefel E.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 614: 196-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). All manipulations of proteins were conducted in septum-sealed serum vials under an argon atmosphere, and all anaerobic liquid and gas transfers were performed using gas-tight syringes. Acetylene reduction, H2 evolution, and N2 reduction activities were determined as described earlier (20Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Mortenson L.E. J. Biol.

NH3 was quantified using a liquid chromatographic fluorescence method with o-phthalaldehyde mercaptoethanol as described previously (22Corbin J.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1984; 47: 1027-1030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thirty μl of an assay reaction producing NH3 was added to 1 ml of a solution containing 19 mm phthalic dicarboxyaldehyde, 3.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% (v/v) ethanol, and 190 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, and allowed to react in the dark for 30 min. The mixture was injected and separated on a C-18 guard column and detected by fluorescence (λexcitation/λemission of 410/472 nm). The NH3 quantification was standardized with NH3Cl. The Ki for propargyl-OH was estimated from the apparent affinity for acetylene (Km(app)) in the presence of varying propargyl-OH concentrations and then plotting Km(app)versus propargyl-OH concentration (23Segel I.H.

Nitrogenase turnover samples were prepared by the addition of the MoFe protein (100 μm) to a buffer mixture (100 mm MES, 100 mm MOPS, 100 mm Tris, and 100 mm TAPS) at defined pH values and including 30 mm sodium dithionite, 10 mm ATP, 15 mm MgCl2, 20 mm phosphocreatine, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.3 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase. The reaction was initiated by the addition of iron protein (50 μm) and was allowed to react for ∼20 s at room temperature before being frozen in EPR tubes in liquid nitrogen. Proteins were added from a concentrated stock solution and did not significantly alter the reaction pH. Where appropriate, propargyl-OH (3 mm) or propargyl-NH2 (15 mm) was included in the initial reaction mixture. Standardized 4-mm quartz EPR tubes were used for all samples.EPR Spectroscopy—X-band EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ESP-300 E spectrometer equipped with an ER 4116 dual-mode X-band cavity including an Oxford Instruments ESR-900 helium flow cryostat. EPR spectra were recorded at a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, a modulation amplitude of 1.26 millitesla (12.6 gauss), a sweep rate of 10 millitesla/s, and a microwave frequency of ∼9.65 GHz (with the precise value recorded for each spectrum to ensure exact g alignment). All spectra were recorded at 8000 and a microwave power of 2.0 mW with each trace being the sum of five scans. The software program IGOR Pro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) was used for all subsequent manipulation of spectral data.Theoretical Calculations—Spin-unrestricted all-electron density functional calculations of the FeMo-cofactor with bound intermediates used the blyp functional with numerical basis sets as implemented in the software program DMol3 (24Delley B.J.

Calculations of the FeMo-cofactor with bound intermediates within the protein involved a large protein component composed of 1032 amino acid residues, 1332 associated water molecules, and the P-cluster together with the FeMo-cofactor. This large protein component was selected as all of chains A and B of 1M1N (3Einsle O. Tezcan F.A. Andrade S.L. Schmid B. Yoshida M. Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 297: 1696-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar) together with residues 494 to 523 of chain D and all water molecules within 4 Å of these atoms or the FeMo-cofactor. All hydrogen atoms were added and energy-minimized by force field methods (force field cvff, program Discover) to optimize the protein and water hydrogen bonding. Structures from density functional calculations of the intermediates bound to the FeMo-cofactor were substituted into the protein and investigated by further force field optimizations. The P-cluster and the NcenFe7MoS9O2 atoms of the FeMo-cofactor plus bound intermediate were fixed during all force field calculations.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONRelevant Features of the α-70Ala-substituted MoFe Protein— Substitution of the MoFe protein α-70Val residue by alanine expands the substrate range for nitrogenase to include the short chain alkynes propyne (HC≡CCH3) and propargyl alcohol (14Mayer S.M. Niehaus W.G. Dean D.R. J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 2002; 5: 802-807Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). When propargyl-OH is used as a nitrogenase substrate and freeze-quenched under turnover conditions, a paramagnetic intermediate is observed that results from conversion of the resting state S = 3/2 spin system (Fig. 1, trace 1) to an S = 1/2 spin system having a rhombic EPR signal with g values of 2.123, 1.998, and 1.986 (Fig. 1, trace 4) (15Benton P.M. Laryukhin M. Mayer S.M. Hoffman B.M. Dean D.R. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9102-9109Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This new EPR-active state originates from an intermediate derived from propargyl-OH that is bound to the FeMo-cofactor. Electron nuclear double resonance studies coupled with the use of isotopically labeled propargyl-OH have established that allyl alcohol, CH2=CH-CH2OH, is the probable species bound (Scheme 1) (17Lee H.I. Igarashi R.Y. Laryukhin M. Doan P.E. Dos Santos P. Dean D.R. Seefeldt L.C. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar).Fig. 1X-band EPR spectra of α-70Ala MoFe protein in the resting and turnover states with propargyl-OH at different pH values. EPR spectra of α-70Ala MoFe protein are shown for the resting state under argon (trace 1) and for the resting state in the presence of 10 mm propargyl-OH (trace 2). The lower set of traces (3, 4, and 5) is of the α-70Ala MoFe protein under turnover conditions with protons as substrate at pH 7.0 (trace 3) or with 3 mm propargyl-OH as substrate at pH 6.7 (trace 4) and pH 8.7 (trace 5). All samples contained 100 μm α-70Ala MoFe. Other conditions are presented under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In contrast to propargyl-OH, when propyne is used as the substrate, freeze-quenching under turnover conditions does not result in the formation of a trapped adduct that can be observed by EPR. An obvious explanation for this difference is that the–OH group of propargyl-OH stabilizes the bound intermediate through hydrogen bonding interactions with a functional group provided by an amino acid located within the vicinity of the substrate binding site. Identification of the proposed functional group thus provided an unprecedented opportunity to identify where and how an alkyne substrate might interact with the nitrogenase active site. Toward this end, the environment around α-70Val and the FeMo-cofactor in the resting state x-ray structure of the MoFe protein (3Einsle O. Tezcan F.A. Andrade S.L. Schmid B. Yoshida M. Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 297: 1696-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar) was examined and the imidazole of α-195His identified as the most likely candidate to provide the hydrogen bonding interaction with propargyl-OH. This possibility suggested two predictions that could be experimentally tested. First, if a propargyl-OH reduction intermediate is stabilized by a hydrogen bond interaction with the imidazole group of α-195His, such stabilization should be pH-dependent having a pKa value near that expected for a histidine residue. Second, an ability to trap the EPR-active intermediate should be dependent on having a histidine residue at the α-195 residue position.Appearance of the Freeze-trapped Propargyl-OH Reduction Intermediate Is pH-dependent—Fig. 1 illustrates the pH dependence of the intensity of the propargyl-OH-derived EPR signal. The maximal EPR signal intensity, which is interpreted to indicate the maximal concentration of the trapped adduct, is observed at a pH ∼6.7. As the pH value increases from 6.7 to 8.7, the intensity of the EPR signal steadily decreases (Fig. 1, traces 4 and 5). No significant changes in EPR lineshape are observed over this pH range, indicating a simple depopulation of the intermediate bound state as pH rises. A more complete data set for the intensity of the propargyl-OH-dependent EPR signal versus pH is presented in Fig. 2, also illustrating a depopulation of the trapped adduct as the pH value increases from 6.7 to 9.0. This result is consistent with the deprotonation of a group having a pKa ∼7.5 and the fact that a protonated state is required for formation of a hydrogen bond necessary to elicit the EPR signal associated with the trapped species. In proteins, histidine residues can have pKa values ranging from 5 to 9, depending on the protein environment (27Edgcomb S.P. Murphy K.P. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2002; 49: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The ϵNH+ portion of α-195His is surrounded by the hydrophobic residues α-65Ala, α-66Gly, α-70Ala, α-71Val, and α-381Phe together with the negatively charged sulfur atoms of the FeMo-cofactor, generating a net negative electrostatic potential. This environment would be predicted to increase the pKa of the imidazole of α-195His (28Chang F.C. Swenson R.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9013-9021Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, one explanation of the results is that the protonated state of the ϵNH+ of α-195His acts as a hydrogen bond donor to a non-bonded electron pair of the oxygen of bound allyl-OH (Fig. 3, panel A). As the ϵN of α-195His becomes deprotonated (with an observed pKa of 7.5), the hydrogen bond with the oxygen of allyl-OH would greatly diminish.Fig. 2pH dependence on formation of propargyl-OH and propargyl-NH2 EPR-detected intermediates. The EPR signal (g = 2.0) intensity as a percentage of the maximal observed intensity is plotted against the pH. The α-70Ala MoFe protein under turnover conditions with propargyl-OH at 3 mm (•) or with propargyl-NH2 at 15 mm (○) is shown. Also shown is the α-70Ala/α-195Gln MoFe protein under turnover conditions with propargyl-OH (▴).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Proposed interactions of propargyl-OH and propargyl-NH2 with α-195His. The proposed interaction of propargyl-OH (A) or propargyl-NH2 (B) with the imidazole side chain of α-195His of the MoFe protein is considered at different pH values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The pH dependence for the formation of the propargyl-OH trapped intermediate can be contrasted with the previously reported pH dependence for acetylene reduction by nitrogenase. In the latter case, maximal activity is around pH 7.3 with a decline in activity at pH values higher and lower than pH 7.3 (29Pham D.N. Burgess B.K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13725-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The pH optimum value of 6.7 observed here for the formation of the propargyl-OH-trapped species is significantly lower than the pH optimum value of 7.3 for activity, suggesting that a specific deprotonation event is controlling the trapping of the intermediate.Appearance of a Propargyl-NH2Reduction Intermediate Is Also pH-dependent—More convincing evidence that the appearance of the trapped EPR-active species is the result of specific hydrogen bonding between a reduction intermediate and an active site residue (rather than a nonspecific effect on enzyme activity) was obtained by using propargyl amine (propargyl-NH2) as a substrate instead of propargyl-OH. If the appearance of the trapped species derived from propargyl-OH is dependent on hydrogen bonding provided by the protonated imidazole group of α-195His, it is predicted that the appearance of a trapped species when propargyl-NH2 is used as substrate would require a deprotonated imidazole group (Fig. 3B) because the pKa of propargyl-NH2 is higher than that of imidazole. In control experiments, it was shown that, like propargyl-OH, propargyl-NH2 is an inhibitor of acetylene reduction (50% inhibition observed by inclusion of 20 mm propargyl-NH2 in an assay with 0.003 atm of acetylene at pH 8.0) and therefore interacts with the active site. When the α-70Ala MoFe protein is freeze-quenched during turnover using propargyl-NH2 as substrate, an EPR-active species is also detected with the same lineshape as the propargyl-OH-derived species with apparent g values of 2.12, 2.00, and 2.00 (Fig. 4). Given the similarity in lineshape of the EPR spectra elicited under freeze-quench conditions when either propargyl-OH or propargyl-NH2 is used as substrate, it is presumed that an allyl-NH2 adduct is bound to an iron atom of the FeMo-cofactor in a way similar to that proposed for propargyl-OH (17Lee H.I. Igarashi R.Y. Laryukhin M. Doan P.E. Dos Santos P. Dean D.R. Seefeldt L.C. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). One difference in behavior between these two substrates is the lower intensity of the propargyl-NH2 (15 mm)-elicited EPR signal (approximately one-fourth) when compared with propargyl-OH (3 mm)-dependent EPR signal intensity. Another important difference is the pH profile for the formation of the respective intermediates (Fig. 2). As can be seen, the population of the trapped propargyl-NH2 reduction intermediate EPR-active species increases with rising pH (maximizing at about pH 8.2) followed by a rapid decline. The important observation is that the pH required for maximizing the propargyl-NH2-elicited EPR signal is significantly shifted to a higher pH than required for maximizing the propargyl-OH-elicited EPR signal. This feature is in line with a requirement for a protonated imidazole group for hydrogen bonding to propargyl-OH and a deprotonated imidazole group for hydrogen bonding to propargyl-NH2 (Fig. 3). The rapid decline in population of the trapped species when propargyl-NH2 is used as substrate can be explained by the deprotonation of both the imidazole group of α-195His and the amino group of propargyl-NH2 (30Graton J. Laurence C. Berthelot M. Le Questel J.-Y. Besseau F. Raczynska E.D. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1999; 2: 997-1001Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Taken together, the different pH dependences required to populate intermediate states when either propargyl-OH or propargyl-NH2 is used as substrate provides a compelling case for the protonation or deprotonation of an imidazole group of α-195His as controlling the stabilization of bound intermediates by hydrogen bonding interactions.Fig. 4X-band EPR spectra of α-70Ala MoFe protein in the resting and turnover states with propargyl-NH2 at different pH values. EPR spectra of α-70Ala MoFe protein are shown for the resting state under argon (trace 1) and for the turnover state with protons as substrate at pH 7.0 (trace 2) or with 15 mm propargyl-NH2 as substrate at pH 6.7 (trace 3) and pH 8.0 (trace 4). All samples contained 100 μm α-70Ala MoFe protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Imidazole Group of α-195His Is Required for Intermediate Stabilization—Previous work has shown that substitution of the MoFe protein α-195His residue by glutamine results in an altered MoFe protein that can bind N2 as effectively as wild-type MoFe protein but is not able to effectively reduce N2 (<2% N2 reduction) (31Dilworth M.J. Fisher K. Kim C.H. Newton W.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17495-17505Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 32Kim C.H. Newton W.E. Dean D.R.

In contrast, the α-195Gln-substituted MoFe protein is unaffected in its ability to reduce acetylene or protons (32Kim C.H. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2798-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 33Fisher K. Dilworth M.J. Newton W.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15570-15577Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The explanation offered for these features is that the imidazole group of α-195His is specifically required to stabilize an N2 reduction intermediate or is required as a proton donor for N2 reduction (32Kim C.H. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2798-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 33Fisher K. Dilworth M.J. Newton W.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15570-15577Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These observations taken together indicate that α-195His is the most likely candidate for providing the ionizable group responsible for stabilizing propargyl-OH or propargyl-NH2 intermediates. If α-195His is responsible for hydrogen bonding interactions necessary to stabilize a propargyl-OH reduction intermediate, such an interaction should be lost by substitution of glutamine for the MoFe protein α-195His residue. This prediction was tested by the construction and characterization of a doubly substituted MoFe protein where α-195His is substituted by glutamine and α-70Val is substituted by alanine. The α-70Ala/α-195Gln doubly substituted MoFe protein retains >65% of the wild-type acetylene and proton reduction activities (Table I), indicating no major disruption in the binding or reduction of these substrates. Like the α-195Gln MoFe protein, the doubly substituted MoFe protein shows very low N2 reduction activity (<1%). Further, propargyl-OH remains an effective inhibitor of acetylene reduction for the doubly substituted MoFe protein with a Ki of 8 mm compared with the published value of 4 mm for the α-70Ala MoFe protein (14Mayer S.M. Niehaus W.G. Dean D.R. J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 2002; 5: 802-807Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar), clearly indicating that propargyl-OH continues to associate with the doubly substituted MoFe protein. However, no EPR-detectable adduct"
https://openalex.org/W1976791447,"Microfluorimetry and patch-clamp experiments were performed on TRPV6-expressing HEK cells to determine whether this Ca2+-sensing Ca2+ channel is constitutively active. Intact cells loaded with fura-2 had an elevated intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), which decreased to the same level such as in non-transfected cells if external Ca2+ was chelated by EGTA. Whole cell recordings from non-transfected HEK cells and cells expressing human TRPV6 revealed the presence of a basal inward current in both types of cells when the internal solution contained 0.1 mm EGTA and 100 nm [Ca2+]i or if the cytosolic Ca2+ buffering remained undisturbed in perforated patch-clamp experiments. If recombinantly expressed TRPV6 forms open channels, one would expect Ca2+-induced current inhibition, because TRPV6 is negatively regulated by internal Ca2+. However, dialyzing solutions with high [Ca2+] such as 1 μm into TRPV6-expressing cells did not block the basal inward current, which was not different from the recordings from non-transfected cells. In contrast, dialyzing 0.5 mm EGTA into TRPV6-expressing cells readily activated Ca2+ inward currents, which were undetectable in non-transfected cells. Interestingly, monovalent cations permeated the TRPV6 channels under conditions where no Ca2+ permeation was detectable, indicating that divalent cations block TRPV6 channels from the extracellular side. Like human TRPV6, the truncated human TRPV6Δ695–725, which lacks the C-terminal domain required for Ca2+-calmodulin binding, does not form constitutive active channels, whereas the human TRPV6D542A, carrying a point mutation in the presumed pore region, does not function as a channel. In summary, no constitutive open TRPV6 channels were detected in patch-clamp experiments from transfected HEK cells. However, channel activity is highly regulated by intracellular and extracellular divalent cations. Microfluorimetry and patch-clamp experiments were performed on TRPV6-expressing HEK cells to determine whether this Ca2+-sensing Ca2+ channel is constitutively active.

In contrast, dialyzing 0.5 mm EGTA into TRPV6-expressing cells readily activated Ca2+ inward currents, which were undetectable in non-transfected cells. Interestingly, monovalent cations permeated the TRPV6 channels under conditions where no Ca2+ permeation was detectable, indicating that divalent cations block TRPV6 channels from the extracellular side. Like human TRPV6, the truncated human TRPV6Δ695–725, which lacks the C-terminal domain required for Ca2+-calmodulin binding, does not form constitutive active channels, whereas the human TRPV6D542A, carrying a point mutation in the presumed pore region, does not function as a channel. In summary, no constitutive open TRPV6 channels were detected in patch-clamp experiments from transfected HEK cells. However, channel activity is highly regulated by intracellular and extracellular divalent cations. Calcium is the most abundant cation in the human body. Most of it is bound in bones and teeth and only very little is ionized.

Given the importance of this messenger, it is necessary to understand how Ca2+ is absorbed from our diet. There are at least two ways how this can take place: either through tight junctions in a paracellular manner or across the apical and basolateral membranes via a transcellular pathway (1Peng J.B. Brown E.M. Hediger M.A. J. Physiol. 2003; 551: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recently, two genes have been cloned from Ca2+-transporting epithelia: TRPV5 from rabbit kidney (formerly called epithelial calcium channel (ECaC) (2Hoenderop J.G. van der Kemp A.W.

Both channels form constitutively open channels, are highly Ca2+ selective (4Vennekens R. Hoenderop J.G. Prenen J. Stuiver M. Willems P.H. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. J. Biol.

Acta. 2002; 1600: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These characteristics and particularly the finding that Ca2+ entry depends on the capacity of intracellular Ca2+ buffers fit well with the expected features of the so far unidentified channels responsible for Ca2+ absorption.In the present study we wanted to determine whether the human TRPV6 proteins form constitutive open channels under physiological conditions. For this purpose patch-clamp experiments and measurements of the [Ca2+]i with fura-2 were performed on HEK cells expressing TRPV6 or mutant channels. The data indicate that TRPV6 is not spontaneously active but opens at low [Ca2+]i and closes at higher [Ca2+]i. This sensitivity is due to local effects of Ca2+ at the intracellular region of the pore. Moreover, under conditions where Ca2+ currents are non-detectable, the channel is available for the permeation by monovalent cations, indicating that TRPV6 channels are also blocked in the presence of extracellular divalent cations.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture, Transfected cDNA, and Transfection—HEK-293 (1573-CRL) and RBL-1 cells (ATTC, 1378-CRL) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and cultured as previously described (7Bödding M. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36656-36664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cells were transiently transfected with 4 μgof DNA in 5 ml of the PolyFect® reagents (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The bicistronic expression plasmid pdiCaT-L was constructed as described before (5Wissenbach U. Niemeyer B.A. Fixemer T. Schneidewind A. Trost C. Cavalie A. Reus K. Meese E. Bonkhoff H. Flockerzi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19461-19468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and contained the entire protein-coding regions of the b-variant of human TRPV6 (formerly CaT-Lb, DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™, accession number CAC20417) followed by an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA. Cells were used 46 h after transient transfection for Western blot analysis and biotinylation experiments.Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis of the aspartate residue at positions 542 was carried out using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described. The point mutation was generated by using the following primer pairs for PCR: sense primer, 5′-CCT TAC CAT CAT CGC TGG CCC AGC C-3′; and antisense primer, 5′-G GCT GGG CCA GCG ATG ATG GTA AGG-3′. The PCR products of the mutated TRPV6 cDNA was subcloned from the pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) into the pCAGGS-IRES-GFP vector. The nucleotide sequences of the TRPV6D542A point mutant was verified by sequencing the complete insert on both strands, including the Kozak sequence and the transition sites into the vector. The truncated TRPV6 variant (TRPV6Δ695–725) has been described previously (8Niemeyer B.A. Bergs C. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Trost C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3600-3605Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).Western Blot Analysis—Lysates were prepared from HEK-293 wild-type cells and TRPV6- and TRPV6D542A-expressing HEK cells. Cells were grown on small coverslips (3.5 cm in diameter) up to 80–90% confluency. After removing the medium and washing in the presence of 1× PBS lysis was initiated by the addition of 150 μl of gel loading buffer. Lysates (20 μl) were applied to a 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and proteins were separated by electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 μm) by tank blotting (Bio-Rad, München, Germany) in the presence of 20% methanol at 350 mA for 1.5 h. The blot was stained with Ponceau red and incubated in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS buffer in diameter, at 21 °C for 1 h followed by incubation in the presence of the affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-TRPV6 antibody 429 (5 μg/ml (9Hirnet D. Olausson J. Fecher-Trost C. Bödding M. Nastainczyk W. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Freichel M. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar)) at 4 °C overnight. After washing the blot three times with TBS buffer, it was incubated at room temperature for 1 h in the presence of a horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG at 1:30,000, Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) and the Renaissance Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Cell Surface Biotinylation—Non-transfected HEK-293 cells and cells transiently expressing TRPV6 (15 culture dishes, 3.5 cm in diameter, with cells at 80–90% confluency each) were placed on ice and washed twice with ice-cold PBS at pH 8 containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.5 mm CaCl2. Cells were then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (final concentration 0.5 mg/ml; Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin from Perbio Science Deutschland GmbH, Bonn, Germany), freshly diluted in PBS containing Mg2+/Ca2+. Biotinylation was terminated by rinsing the dishes twice with PBS containing Mg2+/Ca2+ and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, which quenches the unbound sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate, and once with PBS pH 7.4 without Mg2+/Ca2+. Cells were collected from plates using PBS containing 2 mm EGTA. The harvested cells were centrifuged at 1000 × g and 4 °C for 5 min and resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors). The lysates were rotated at 4 °C for 30 min to further solubilize the proteins. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 1000 × g and 4 °C. Following measurement of the protein content of the cell extract, samples containing 600 μg of proteins were added to 150 μl of avidin-agarose beads, pre-equilibrated in the lysis buffer, and rotated for 3 h at 4 °C. The biotin-avidin agarose complexes were then harvested by centrifugation (1000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min) and washed four times with the lysis buffer supplemented with 0.25 m NaCl to give a final concentration 0.4 m NaCl. The beads were then resuspended in 60 μlof2× Laemmli buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min prior to SDS-PAGE.Electrophysiological Recordings and Solutions—Patch-clamp experiments were performed in the whole cell configuration (10Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15094) Google Scholar) using an EPC-9 amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany). Cells were measured 24–32 h after transfection in a modified Ringer's solution containing (in mm): 145 NaCl, 10 CaCl2, 10 CsCl, 2.8 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH. The divalent-free solution contained (in mm): 145 NaCl, 10 CsCl, 2.8 KCl, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH. The external solution for the optical recordings contained either 2 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA instead of 10 mm CaCl2. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (Kimax®), were dipped with their tips in Sigmacote® to be coated, and had resistances between 2 and 3 mΩ when filled with the standard internal solution containing (in mm): 145 cesium glutamate, 10 HEPES, 8 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 Mg-ATP adjusted to pH 7.2 with CsOH. The [Ca2+] of the cesium glutamate-based solution was clamped to 100 nm by the addition of 10 mm EGTA and 3.64 mm CaCl2 or 10 mm EDTA and 6.34 mm CaCl2. HEDTA (10 mm) and CaCl2 (2 mm) were used in the pipette solution to clamp the [Ca2+] at 1 μm. Perforated-patch recordings were performed with the standard intracellular solution supplemented with 100 μg ml–1 nystatin (11Horn R. Marty A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar). The tips of the patch-pipettes were filled with nystatin-free internal solution. When challenged with step depolarizations, perforation of the membrane patch was indicated by characteristic changes of the capacitance transient and by a continuous decline of the input resistance. To standardize experiments, recordings were started when the input resistance fell to a value of 20 mΩ or less; this point was reached usually 5–10 min after gigaseal formation. The series resistances in tight seal, whole cell experiments were typically in the range of 5–10 MΩ. Currents were filtered using an 8-pole Bessel filter at 8 kHz and digitized at 100 μs. Voltage-clamp recordings were performed using ramps from –110 mV to 90 mV over 50 ms, which were applied every 2 s using PULSE software (HEKA Electronik) on a personal computer. The holding potential was –10 mV between ramps. Several parameters (capacitance, series resistance, and holding current) were displayed simultaneously at a slower rate (2 Hz) using the X-Chart display (HEKA Electronik). The membrane potential values were corrected for a 10-mV liquid junction potential. No additional voltage correction was performed for the experiments under divalent-free conditions. Osmolarities of external and internal solutions were checked using the Osmomat 030 (Gonotec, Berlin, Germany). No measurable differences were detected for the experiments with 1 μm free intracellular Ca2+. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (20–23 °C). Internal solutions were kept on ice to minimize hydrolysis of ATP.Microfluorimetry—Cells were incubated with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator dye fura-2 AM (2 μm) at 37 °C for 30 min in the dark, and fluorescence intensity ratios (340/380 nm) were measured at 510 nm with the IMAGO system from T.I.L.L. Phototonics (Martinsried, Germany) as previously described (12Bödding M. Fecher-Trost C. Flockerzi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50872-50879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Data Analysis—Analysis was performed with PulseFit and programs written in the IGOR macro language (Wave Metrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Inward currents were measured at –80 mV without background current subtraction. Throughout, average data are given as means ± S.E. for a number (n) of cells. Student's t test was used for comparison of means.Drugs—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma except fura-2 AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Nystatin was dissolved in Me2SO to yield a final concentration of 50 mg ml–1, and these stock solutions were used for 1 day.RESULTSElevated [Ca2+]i in Fura-2 Ester-loaded TRPV6-expressing HEK Cells—Do the TRPV6 proteins form constitutive active Ca2+-selective channels when expressed in HEK or RBL cells? This question was addressed by performing experiments with the Ca2+ indicator dye fura-2 on intact cells. The monitoring of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) revealed an elevated [Ca2+]i in HEK cells expressing TRPV6 in comparison to HEK cells that do not express TRPV6 (Fig. 1; F340/F380 = 1.57 ± 0.15 arbitrary units, n = 26 for HEK-TRPV6 and F340/F380 = 0.87 ± 0.06 arbitrary unit, n = 17 for HEK-wt). Replacement of extracellular Ca2+ (2 mm) by EGTA (1 mm) resulted in a pronounced decrease of the [Ca2+]i in the TRPV6-expressing cells, whereas [Ca2+]i of control cells decreased only slightly. With time, similar basal intracellular Ca2+ levels were reached in both cell types (Fig. 1; at 500 s after application: F340/F380 = 0.80 ± 0.05 arbitrary unit, n = 26 for HEK-TRPV6 and F340/F380 = 0.72 ± 0.03 arbitrary unit, n = 17 for HEK). Similar data have been reported previously, and it was concluded that TRPV6 forms constitutive open Ca2+ selective channels (5Wissenbach U. Niemeyer B.A. Fixemer T. Schneidewind A. Trost C. Cavalie A. Reus K. Meese E. Bonkhoff H. Flockerzi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19461-19468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Another explanation could be that TRPV6-mediated Ca2+ entry is activated by changes of [Ca2+]i due to the presence of the Ca2+ indicator dye. Fura-2 perturbs the in vivo Ca2+ buffering yielding an increased overall Ca2+ buffering capacity. Because TRPV6 channel gating has been shown to strongly depend on the concentrations of intracellular Ca2+ chelators, it is likely that changing the Ca2+ buffering capacity by any means affects channel opening.Patch-clamp Recordings from TRPV6-expressing Cells Do Not Indicate Spontaneous Channel Activity—Patch-clamp recordings in the whole cell configuration were performed on TRPV6-expressing HEK cells to test this hypothesis. In the presence of a low intracellular EGTA concentration (0.1 mm) a basal current was detectable (Fig. 2). Very similar recordings were obtained from HEK wild-type cells (see below, Fig. 8C). However, increasing the chelator concentration slightly (0.5 mm) resulted in the activation of the typical TRPV6 mediated Ca2+ influx in transfected cells. The inward current developed rapidly after establishing the whole cell mode and reached small peak current densities after about 20 s (Fig. 2, –6.2 ± 2.0 pA/pF, n = 3). The initial basal current, which was recorded immediately after obtaining the whole cell configuration during the first ramp, had a very small amplitude (Fig. 3A) and showed no TRPV6 like current-voltage (I-V) relationship such as the inward rectification and the positive reversal potential (data not shown, n = 7 and 3 for 0.1 and 0.5 mm EGTA, respectively). Considering that in the presence of 0.1 mm EGTA similar currents were obtained both in HEK cells expressing TRPV6 and in HEK cells not expressing TRPV6, it appears unlikely that TRPV6 functions as a spontaneously active channel. Results alike were obtained using RBL cells expressing TRPV6 and RBL cells not expressing TRPV6 (0.1 mm EGTA: n = 7 for RBL-TRPV6 and n = 3 for RBL; 0.5 mm EGTA: n = 8 for RBL-TRPV6 and n = 3 for RBL-wt).Fig. 2Effects of various intracellular buffering conditions on TRPV6-expressing HEK cells. Time course of inward currents were measured at –80 mV and plotted versus the duration of whole cell dialysis. The cesium aspartate-based pipette solution contained either 0.1 mm or 0.5 mm EGTA. The free Ca2+ concentration was clamped to 100 nm using EGTA (10 mm) and CaCl2 (3.64 mm). A modified Ringer's solution with 10 mm Ca2+ was used extracellularly. The dashed line represents zero current. Mean data with double-sided S.E. are shown (n = 9, 7, and 3 for 100 nm free Ca2+, 0.1 mm, and 0.5 mm EGTA, respectively).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 8Activation of TRPV6-mediated monovalent currents in the absence of extracellular divalent cations at low intracellular Ca2+ buffering.

B, I-V curves were obtained during the experiment shown in A as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Current densities of TRPV6 expressing and non-transfected HEK cells immediately after establishing the whole cell configuration. A, inward currents were measured at –80 mV during the first voltage ramp, which was applied immediately after establishing the whole cell mode. The cesium glutamate-based intracellular solution contained either 0.1, 0.5, or 1.5 mm EGTA. The free Ca2+ concentration was clamped at 100 nm by the addition of 10 mm EGTA and 3.64 mm to the standard pipette solution. Initial current densities of –1.7 ± 0.5 pA/picofarad, n = 5, were measured if HEDTA was used to buffer the free Ca2+ concentration to 100 nm as shown in Fig. 5. B, the perforated patch-clamp experiments were performed with the standard pipette solution containing 100 μg ml–1 nystatin. Mean data ± S.E. (n) are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Additional evidence that the basal currents measured after dialyzing the cells with 0.1 mm EGTA are not related to TRPV6 currents comes from experiments where Ca2+ was dialyzed into the cell (Fig. 2). According to recent results indicating an inverse correlation of [Ca2+]i and TRPV6 current activity, one would expect Ca2+-induced current inhibition if TRPV6 forms a constitutive open channel. However, dialyzing Ca2+ at a free concentration of 100 nm into TRPV6-expressing HEK cells did not block the inward current (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained under identical conditions with RBL cells (n = 4 for RBL-TRPV6 and n = 5 for RBL-wt). There was also no difference to the recordings at lower [Ca2+]i by using 0.1 mm EGTA in the pipette solution from TRPV6-expressing cells HEK (Fig. 2) and RBL cells (n = 7 for RBL-TRPV6 and n = 3 for RBL-wt). In agreement to this, no decrease of the initial inward current was recorded when Ca2+ at a free concentration of 1 μm was dialyzed into TRPV6-expressing cells indicating that the basal current recorded in TRPV6-expressing HEK cells is not due to constitutive open TRPV6 channels. Instead, large outward currents with negative reversal potentials were activated in TRPV6-expressing and non-transfected HEK cells, respectively (Fig. 4). In all experiments the inward current was not blocked during the first seconds of each recording, despite the fact that high intracellular concentrations of free Ca2+ were used.Fig. 4Activation and inactivation of an outward current after dialysis of 1 μm Ca2+ into a non-transfected HEK cell. A, representative current response of a HEK cell dialyzed with 1 μm Ca2+ (n = 5). Outward and inward currents were measured at 80 and –80 mV, respectively. The activation of the inward current is shown on an extended time scale in the inset. B, the I-V curve was recorded at maximal current activation 90 s after establishing the whole cell configuration as indicated in A. Similar experiments were performed on TRPV6-expressing HEK cells (n = 10).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Because there was no Ca2+-dependent inhibition of the basal inward current, it seems unlikely that TRPV6 forms open channels when heterologously expressed. Perforated patch-clamp recordings strengthen this conclusion. Cytosolic Ca2+ buffers were not affected in these experiments, because the polyen antibiotic nystatin induced holes in the plasma membrane that are too small to allow proteins to permeate. Current densities were not different between TRPV6-expressing HEK cells and HEK cells not expressing TRPV6 (Fig. 3B). These results further indicate that TRPV6 channels are closed under resting conditions of physiological Ca2+ concentrations. Nevertheless, channel opening might occur by decreasing the Ca2+ concentration in the close proximity of the pore, for instance by Ca2+ transport out of the cytosol or by increasing the intracellular Ca2+ buffer capacity.TRPV6 Channel Activity Inversely Correlates with the [Ca2+]i—It has been shown before that TRPV6 channel activity depends on the intracellular concentration of EGTA and BAPTA. The influence of the [Ca2+]i and [Mg2+]i on TRPV6-mediated Ca2+ and monovalent currents has been demonstrated (7Bödding M. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36656-36664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, chelators such as EGTA, BAPTA, or EDTA do not only bind Ca2+ but also other metal ions such as Mg2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, and Co2+. Thus, it is possible that the reduction of other cations rather than a decrease in the [Ca2+]i led to the activation of TRPV6 channels. Therefore, two sets of experiments were performed with an internal solution containing 10 mm of either EDTA or EGTA together with the appropriate addition of CaCl2 to fix the free Ca2+ concentration at 100 nm. Under these conditions, the free concentrations of other metal ions are expected to be different in both intracellular solutions, because the affinities of EDTA and EGTA for most cations is not identical (13Martell A.E. Smith R.M. Critical Stability Constants. 1. Plenum Press, New York1974Google Scholar). Clamping the [Ca2+]i at 100 nm in a 10 mm EDTA-containing internal solution resulted in no current activation (Fig. 5). Similarly, dialyzing TRPV6-expressing HEK cells with 100 nm free Ca2+ in a 10 mm EGTA-containing solution did not activate Ca2+ currents (Fig. 5). Under both conditions the calculated free concentrations of Mg2+, Co2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, or other cations are different. Because no current developed, the gating of TRPV6 channels depends primarily on the [Ca2+]i.Fig. 5Effects of two different intracellular buffering conditions at a fixed [Ca2+]i on TRPV6-expressing HEK cells. Experiments were performed as described for Fig. 2 with an intracellular solution containing 10 mm of either EDTA (n = 5) or EGTA (n = 9).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)No Spontaneous Activity of Mutant TRPV6 Channels—Ca2+ has been shown to inactivate TRPV6 channels in at least two ways: first, there is a prominent and very rapid inactivation like in TRPV5 channels due to local effects of Ca2+ on the intracellular pore forming region (14Nilius B.

Prenen J. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Droogmans G. J. Physiol. 2000; 527: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar); second, there is an apparent slower inactivation that was found to be dependent on Ca2+-calmodulin binding to the C-terminal domain of human TRPV6 (8Niemeyer B.A. Bergs C. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Trost C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3600-3605Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Two mutants of human TRPV6 were used to find out whether constitutive activity is restored in the absence of either mechanism: the truncated variant TRPV6Δ695–725, which lacks the calmodulin binding site and the TRPV6D542A pore mutant, where the aspartate residue at position 542 is replaced by an alanine residue. In TRPV5 from rabbit, the corresponding aspartate residue determines Ca2+ permeation and Mg2+ block of this channel (14Nilius B. Vennekens R. Prenen J. Hoenderop J.G. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. J.

When the intracellular solution contained 10 mm EGTA, a current readily developed in TRPV6-expressing (Fig. 6A) and TRPV6Δ695–725-expressing (Fig. 6B) cells, respectively. However, this was not the case in non-transfected HEK cells (Fig. 6C) or TRPV6D542A-expressing"

DREAM is a Ca2+-dependent transcriptional repressor widely expressed in the brain where it participates in nociception through its control of prodynorphin gene expression. In the periphery, DREAM is highly expressed in the thyroid gland, the immune system, and the reproductive organs. Here, we show that DREAM interacts with thyroid-specific transcription factor TTF-1 and regulates the expression of the thyroglobulin (Tg) gene. The mechanism also involves binding of DREAM to the thyroglobulin promoter and blockage of TTF-1-mediated transactivation. The TSH/cAMP pathway and Ca2+ signaling regulate DREAM-mediated transcriptional repression of the thyroglobulin gene. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments in FRTL-5 cells confirmed that Tg is a bona fide target gene for DREAM transrepression in thyroid follicular cells.

Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments in FRTL-5 cells confirmed that Tg is a bona fide target gene for DREAM transrepression in thyroid follicular cells. The thyroid-differentiated phenotype is characterized by a diversity of proteins whose expression is either unique to thyroid follicular cells, such as thyroglobulin (Tg) 1The abbreviations used are: Tg, thyroglobulin; DRE, downstream regulatory element; CRE, cAMP response element; CREB, CRE-binding protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; TTF, thyroid transcription factor; PI, phosphatidylinositol; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone; wt, wild type; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RT, reverse transcriptase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. 1The abbreviations used are: Tg, thyroglobulin; DRE, downstream regulatory element; CRE, cAMP response element; CREB, CRE-binding protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; TTF, thyroid transcription factor; PI, phosphatidylinositol; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone; wt, wild type; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RT, reverse transcriptase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. and thyroperoxidase, or restricted to a few cell types such as thyrotropin receptor and sodium iodide symporter (1Civitareale D.

Three thyroid-specific transcription factors, thyroid transcription factor (TTF)-1, TTF-2, and Pax-8, are responsible for thyroid-specific gene expression (5Damante G. Tell G. Di Lauro R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 66: 307-356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TTF-1 is a homeoprotein whose expression is restricted to thyroid, lung, and the developing brain (6Lazzaro D. Price M. de Felice M. Di Lauro R. Development. 1991; 113: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TTF-2 contains a forkhead domain and, apart from thyroid, is also expressed in Rathke′s pouch (7Zannini M. Avantaggiato V. Biffali E. Arnone M.I. Sato K. Pischetola M. Taylor B.A. Phillips S.J. Simeone A. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3185-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Pax-8 is a member of the paired box-containing proteins and is expressed in thyroid and in the brain and kidney during development (8Mansouri A. Chowdhury K. Gruss P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of these three thyroid-specific proteins is regulated by phosphorylation (9Zannini M. Acebron A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2249-2254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), by changes in the redox state (10Kambe F. Nomura Y. Okamoto T. Seo H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 801-812PubMed Google Scholar), or by protein-protein interactions with other nucleoproteins (11Perrone L. Tell G. Di Lauro R. J. Biol.

Biotechnol. 2002; 3: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Gene inactivation studies in mice have demonstrated that TTF-1, TTF-2, and Pax-8 are essential for the proper development and differentiation of the thyroid gland (8Mansouri A. Chowdhury K. Gruss P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 14Kimura S. Hara Y. Pineau T. Fernandez-Salguero P. Fox C.H. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J.

Macchia V. Di Lauro R. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, despite numerous studies in recent years, it is not yet possible to present an accurate model for their role in thyroid differentiation. One possibility is the involvement of additional, yet unknown, factor(s). In this regard, it has remained particularly elusive to understand the late expression of the Tg gene, from E14.5, when TTF-1, TTF-2, and Pax-8 are expressed from the beginning of thyroid development, at embryonic day E8.5 in the mouse (6Lazzaro D. Price M. de Felice M. Di Lauro R. Development. 1991; 113: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The action of a transcriptional repressor(s) in thyroid cells that may interact with TTF-1, TTF-2, or Pax-8 and block their activity at the promoter of thyroid-specific genes early during thyroid development has been proposed (16Pellizzari L. D'Elia A. Rustighi A. Manfioletti G. Tell G. Damante G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2503-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).The transcriptional repressor DREAM is a calcium-binding protein with homology to members of the recoverin family of neuronal calcium sensors (17Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). DREAM was identified through its binding to the downstream regulatory element (DRE) in the prodynorphin gene (17Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 18Carrion A.M. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6921-6929Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Binding of DREAM to DRE sequences is regulated by the level of nuclear Ca2+ (17Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), by the interaction with other nucleoproteins (19Ledo F. Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9120-9126Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and by the PI 3-kinase pathway (20Sanz C. Mellstrom B. Link W.A. Naranjo J.R. Fernandez-Luna J.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2286-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Unbinding of DREAM from the DRE sequence results in transcriptional derepression of target genes, e.g. prodynorphin (17Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Consistent with this mechanism, DREAM-deficient mice show an up-regulation of prodynorphin expression in spinal cord, which results in a hypoalgesic phenotype (21Cheng H.Y. Pitcher G.M. Laviolette S.R. Whishaw I.Q. Tong K.I. Kockeritz L.K. Wada T. Joza N.A. Crackower M. Goncalves J. Sarosi I. Woodgett J.R. Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J. Ikura M. van der Kooy D. Salter M.W. Penninger J.M. Cell. 2002; 108: 31-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Furthermore, through protein-protein interactions it has been recently shown that DREAM may regulate other transcriptional events not directly related to the presence of DRE sites (22Ledo F. Kremer L. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4583-4592Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, the Ca2+-dependent DREAM/CREB interaction displaces CREB from CRE sites and prevents the recruitment of CBP to phospho-CREB, which results in a reduction of CRE-dependent transcription without DREAM binding to the CRE site (22Ledo F. Kremer L. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4583-4592Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).In the periphery, expression of DREAM has been found in immune and reproductive organs as well as in the thyroid gland (17Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). In this study, we have used the FRTL-5 thyroid follicular cell line to analyze the function of the transcriptional repressor DREAM in thyroid-specific gene expression. We show that DREAM interacts with the thyroid-specific transcription factor TTF-1 and regulates expression of the Tg gene. In addition, the mechanism involves binding of DREAM to the thyroglobulin promoter and blockage of transactivation mediated by TTF-1.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Rat thyroid follicular FRTL-5 cells (ATCC CRL 8305; American Type Culture Collection) were kindly provided by Dr. L. D. Kohn (Edison Biotech Institute, Ohio University). The cells had the properties previously described (23Ambesi-Impiombato F.S. Parks L.A. Coon H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3455-3459Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar), were diploid, and their doubling time with TSH was 24-36 h. Cells were maintained in Coon's modified Ham's F-12 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 5% calf serum (Invitrogen) and six growth factor complement (6H) including TSH (0.5 milliunits/ml), insulin (10 μg/ml), somatostatin (10 ng/ml), hydrocortisone (10 nm), transferrin (5 μg/ml), and glycyl-histidyl-lysine (10 ng/ml). The culture medium referred to as 5H contains the same hormones as the 6H medium but without TSH and only 0.2% serum. Human HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.Reporters and Expression Vectors—Two different Tg promoter constructs were used: TACAT-3 corresponds to the wild-type Tg promoter from -173 to +48 in the rat Tg gene and TACAT-14 (24Sinclair A.J. Lonigro R. Civitareale D. Ghibelli L. Di Lauro R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), which contains mutations in the TgDRE core as indicated in Fig. 3. pBLCAT2, pTKDRECAT, pDRETKCAT, pHD1Luc, and pHD1mDRELuc have been described elsewhere (17Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 18Carrion A.M. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6921-6929Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). RSV-Luc and pRL-CMV were used to correct for transfection efficiency. Plasmids encoding wild-type TTF-1 (25Guazzi S. Price M. De Felice M. Damante G. Mattei M.G. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), TTF-1Δ3 and TTF-Δ14 deletions, and Gal4-TTF-1 constructs have been previously described (26De Felice M. Damante G. Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Di Lauro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26649-26656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), as well as the plasmid pCMV-Pax-8 (27Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Plachov D. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4230-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). For analysis of DREAM activity we used expression vectors containing wild-type DREAM (wtDREAM) (17Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) and different DREAM mutants; DREAM 2,3,4EF-hand mutant (EFmDREAM), contains mutations in three of the four EF-hand motifs resulting in a protein insensitive to calcium (17Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). DREAM-L47,52V and DREAM-L155V encode LCDm-DREAM proteins with mutations in the first or the second LCD domain, respectively (19Ledo F. Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9120-9126Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).Transfections—Transient transfections in FRTL-5 and HeLa cells were carried out by the calcium phosphate DNA precipitation method. In experiments with TSH and ATP, the cells were grown in 5H medium and treated with 1 nm TSH or 0.5 mm ATP 12 h before harvest. Luciferase (Luc) and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity were measured as described elsewhere (28Medina D.L. Rivas M. Cruz P. Barroso I. Regadera J. Santisteban P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In all cases, RSV-Luc (1 μg) or pRL-CMV (Renilla) (0.2 μg) were used to correct for transfection efficiency. Results are shown as relative activity compared with the controls in each experiment. The data are shown as mean ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments in triplicate. Statistical analysis of the results was performed using the Student's t test. For stable transfection, FRTL-5 cells received 10 μg of plasmid DNA expressing either wtDREAM, EFmDREAM, or empty pcDNA3 vector. Cells were selected after 3 weeks with 300 μg/ml G418 (Sigma).DNA Binding Assays—Band shift assays using 100 ng of recombinant DREAM or 10 μg of nuclear extracts from FRTL-5 cells were performed as previously described (19Ledo F. Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9120-9126Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The Tg DRE sequence is: 5′-AAAGTGAGCCACTGCCCAGTCAAGTGTTCTTGA-3′. Oligonucleotides containing c-fosDRE or Sp1 have been previously described (17Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 18Carrion A.M. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6921-6929Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For supershift experiments the extracts were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the presence of 1 μg of anti-Pax-8 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-TTF-1 (Biopat), or anti-DREAM (Ab 1013) antibodies and then incubated for 20 min with 80,000 cpm of probe in 20 μl of final volume.Western Blot Analysis—Nuclear or total cell extracts were prepared (28Medina D.L. Rivas M. Cruz P. Barroso I. Regadera J. Santisteban P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and protein concentration determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). 30 μg of protein were resolved in SDS-PAGE and transferred to Protran membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Anti-Tg antibody (0.5 μg/ml) was from Dako, anti-TTF-1 (0.5 μg/ml) from Biopat, anti-Pax-8 (0.5 μg/ml), anti β-actin (0.2 μg/ml), and anti-PARP (0.2 μg/ml) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Affinity-purified anti-DREAM (0.5 μg/ml) (Ab 1013) was raised against recombinant DREAM (22Ledo F. Kremer L. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4583-4592Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated and blots prepared using 20 μg of total RNA as described (28Medina D.L. Rivas M. Cruz P. Barroso I. Regadera J. Santisteban P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Hybridizations were performed with probes specific for Tg, TTF-1 (25Guazzi S. Price M. De Felice M. Damante G. Mattei M.G. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), Pax-8 (27Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Plachov D. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4230-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), DREAM (17Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), and β-actin (29Levi A. Eldridge J.D. Paterson B.M. Science. 1985; 229: 393-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming.Qualitative RT-PCR—Qualitative RT-PCR was performed using total RNA from mouse thyroid gland or brain and specific primers, KChIP-1; forward 5′-GACACCACCCAGACAGGCTCT-3′ and reverse 5′-CAGAATGGCCAGTGTCCTCAGT-3′, KChIP-2; forward 5′-CAAGTTCACACGCAGAGAGT-3′ and reverse 5′-CCGAAGAATCACTGACAAAC-3′, DREAM/KChIP-3; forward 5′-AGCAAGAGGGAAGGCA-3′ and reverse 5′-GAAGAACTGGGAATAAATGA-3′, KChIP-4; forward 5′-CGTGAGAAGGGTGGAAAG-3′ and reverse 5′-GCAGGAGACGACGTTTTG-3′; β-actin, forward 5′-TGGAATCCTGTGGCATCCATGAAAC-3′ and reverse 5′-TAAAACGCAGCTCAGTAACAGTCCG-3′. PCR amplification was carried out for 40 cycles: denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s.Protein-Protein Interaction Assays—For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, FRTL-5 cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 and a protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). Co-immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4 °C using monoclonal antibody 1B1 (22Ledo F. Kremer L. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4583-4592Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Immunocomplexes were captured with protein A/G-Sepharose for 1 h, and pellets were washed three times in Nonidet P-40 buffer. Protein complexes were eluted in SDS sample buffer and subjected to Western blotting.For pull-down studies, TTF-1 and its truncated forms were 35S-labeled in vitro using the transcription/translation T7-TnT system (Promega). Equimolar amounts of recombinant GST and GST-DREAM proteins (∼15-20 pmol) bound to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) were incubated with the labeled proteins in interaction buffer (20 mm potassium Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Blotto (Bio-Rad), and protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem)). After five washes in the same buffer, bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer, resolved in SDS-PAGE, and detected with fluorography.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation using a previously published method (30Takahasi Y. Rayman J. Dynlacht B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼6 × 107 FRTL-5 cells cultured in 5H for 7 days and untreated or treated with 1 nm TSH were cross-linked, nuclei were collected, and chromatin were sonicated to a length of between 500 and 2000 bp. The sheared chromatin was directly precleared with blocked protein-A/G Sepharose and used for immunoprecipitation, with or without 10 μg affinity-purified polyclonal antibody 1013 for DREAM. Immunoprecipitated DNA was subjected to semiquantitative PCR with primers to amplify the promoter region of thyroglobulin forward 5′-CGGGAGCAGACTCAAGTAGAGG-3′ and reverse 5′-TTTATAGCACAGTGGCAAGCAGTG-3′; c-fos promoter forward 5′-CAGACTGAGACGGGGGTTGA-3′ and reverse 5′-GGCGAGGGGTCCAGGGGTAGAC-3′ or β-actin forward 5′-GAAGCTGTGCTATGTGCCCTAGA-3′ and reverse 5′-TGCCGATAGTGATGACCTGACCGT-3′. All ChIP results were confirmed in at least three separated experiments.RESULTSDREAM Is Expressed in Follicular Thyroid Cells—To investigate the functional role of the high basal levels of DREAM mRNA in the thyroid gland (17Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) we used rat FRTL-5 thyroid follicular cells, a model that has been extensively used to study thyroid cell differentiation. Follicular cells represent the predominant phenotype in the thyroid gland and are responsible for the expression and secretion of thyroglobulin and thyroid hormones. Northern blot analysis detected the expression of DREAM mRNA in FRTL-5 cells (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis using nuclear extracts from FRTL-5 cells (Fig. 1B) confirmed the Northern blot results and showed that the levels of DREAM protein in FRTL-5 cells are comparable to the levels in NB69 cells, the human neuroblastoma cell line where DREAM activity was first characterized (18Carrion A.M. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6921-6929Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In keeping with previous reports (17Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 18Carrion A.M. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6921-6929Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), DREAM mRNA or protein was not detected in HeLa cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Post-translational modifications of the DREAM protein may account for the appearance of the double band in the Western blot. Alternatively, the multiple bands may correspond to other KChIP proteins closely related to DREAM (An et al., Ref. 46An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). To assess this possibility we used total RNA isolated from mouse thyroid gland and specific primers for each one of the KChIP transcripts. RT-PCR-amplified bands corresponding exclusively to DREAM and KChIP-2 mRNAs are shown in Fig. 1C. As a positive control, amplification of all KChIPs in mouse brain total RNA is also shown. Direct PCR on rat genomic DNA did not amplify any of the DREAM/KChIP bands (data not shown). Taken together these data indicate that DREAM and KChIP-2 but not KChIP-1 or -4 are expressed in the thyroid gland.Fig. 1Detection of DREAM in thyroid-derived FRTL-5 cells.A, Northern blot analysis of total RNA from rat brain, HeLa, and FRTL-5 cells. B, Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts from FRTL-5 cells. For comparison, neuroblastoma NB69 and HeLa cells are shown. C, RT-PCR analysis of DREAM/KChIP isoforms expressed in the thyroid gland. For comparison, expression of all the DREAM/KChIP genes in mouse brain is shown. D, DRE-dependent repression of the pTKDRECAT; E, pHD1Luc reporters in FRTL-5 cells, compared with the absence of DRE in pBLCAT2 and to the DRE-mutated reporter pHD1mDRELuc, respectively.

Asterisks represent statistically significant differences between the means relative to corresponding controls. ***, p < 0.001; **, p < 0.01, Student's t test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further substantiate these results, we assessed DRE-dependent repression by the endogenously expressed DREAM protein in FRTL-5 cells. For that we performed transient transfections using reporter plasmids containing DRE binding sites. The activity of a TKDRECAT reporter containing the prodynorphin DRE (18Carrion A.M. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6921-6929Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) was reduced when compared with the basal activity of empty reporter vector pBLCAT2 (Fig. 1D). Moreover, in agreement with previous results in NB69 cells (18Carrion A.M. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6921-6929Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the activity of a reporter containing 1.8 kb of the prodynorphin promoter with a single mutation in the DRE site pHD1mutDRELuc was significantly higher than the activity of a similar reporter pHD1DRELuc containing the wild-type prodynorphin promoter (Fig. 1E). No difference in activity of the different reporters was observed after transfection in HeLa cells (data not shown), as previously reported (18Carrion A.M. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6921-6929Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These data indicate that follicular thyroid cells express DREAM and that in FRTL-5 cells DREAM functions as a DRE-dependent transcriptional repressor.DREAM Binds To and Regulates the Thyroglobulin Promoter—Follicular cells represent the vast majority of the cell population in the thyroid gland and are responsible for the expression of the most representative gene in thyroid function, Tg, from which the thyroid hormones are derived. In a first attempt to understand the role of DREAM in thyroid physiology we focused on follicular cells and the potential role of DREAM in the mechanisms that control Tg gene expression. Sequence analysis of the Tg promoter showed the presence of a DRE core motif (AGTCAAG), hereafter referred to as TgDRE, 70 base pairs upstream from the TATA box (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the TgDRE sequence overlaps with a key regulatory region known as the C element that includes the binding sites for TTF-1 and Pax-8, the two main regulators of Tg transcription and thyroid differentiation (27Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Plachov D. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4230-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 31Santisteban P. Acebron A. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Di Lauro R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested the possibility that DREAM could participate in Tg gene expression acting at the TgDRE site. Using recombinant DREAM in EMSA, a specific retarded TgDRE/DREAM complex was observed, which could be competed by cold TgDRE or c-fosDRE but was not affected by competition with cold unrelated oligonucleotides (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, EMSA using nuclear extracts from FRTL-5 cells resulted in a TgDRE retarded band competed by DRE-containing oligonucleotides (Fig. 2C and data not shown). Incubation with a DREAM antibody substantially reduced the TgDRE-retarded band indicating the involvement of endogenous DREAM in the retardation. Moreover, an antibody specific for TTF-1 supershifted the TgDRE retarded band while a Pax-8-specific antibody had only a modest effect (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that the TgDRE sequence is able to bind a nuclear complex containing at least DREAM and TTF-1.Fig. 2The Tg promoter contains a functional DRE.A, schematic representation of the Tg promoter occupancy by the DNA-binding proteins present in rat FRTL-5 cells. The DNA sequences of the TgDRE probe used in band shift assays are shown. The core DRE sequence in TgDRE is in bold and marked with an arrow. EMSA using the TgDRE as a probe together with recombinant DREAM protein (B) or nuclear extracts from FRTL-5 cells (C and D) is shown. Competitions with a 50-fold (B) or a 25- or 50-fold excess (C) of related (TgDRE and c-fosDRE) or non-related (Sp1) cold oligonucleotides are shown (B and C). In D, the TgDRE-retarded band is competed with an anti-DREAM antibody but only slightly affected with an anti-Pax-8 antibody. An anti-TTF-1 antibody supershifted the TgDRE band as indicated by the asterisk.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further analyze the functionality of the TgDRE, FRTL-5 cells were transiently transfected with a DREAM expression vector together with the TACAT-3 or TACAT-14 reporters (24Sinclair A.J. Lonigro R. Civitareale D. Ghibelli L. Di Lauro R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), which contain the Tg proximal promoter wild type or with mutations that affect the TgDRE core, respectively (Fig. 3A). Overexpression of DREAM resulted in a 50% inhibition of the Tg reporter activity (Fig. 3B). By contrast, DREAM could not decrease the activity of the TACAT-14 reporter (Fig. 3B). Mutations in TACAT-14 impair binding of TTF-1, which accounts for its lower basal activity (24Sinclair A.J. Lonigro R. Civitareale D. Ghibelli L. Di Lauro R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Importantly, binding of DREAM to TACAT-14 was also blocked, while the mutations did not affect the binding of Pax-8 (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these data suggest that binding of DREAM to the TgDRE is important to repress the Tg promoter. However, because binding of TTF-1 to the TACAT-14 mutant was also abolished, an effect of DREAM on TTF-1 transcriptional activity on the Tg promoter cannot be discarded.DREAM Interacts with TTF-1—Increasing evidence suggests that TTF-1 functions cooperatively with a number of other transcription factors to form transcriptionally active complexes on regulatory regions of target genes (32Sever-Chroneos Z.

In this study we show that the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase B (PGM) becomes phosphorylated in the presence of the Nm23-H1·GAPDH complex in vitro.

In association with Nm23-H1 and GAPDH, PGM could be activated by dCTP, which is a substrate of Nm23-H1, in addition to the well known PGM activator 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. A synthetic cell-penetrating peptide (PGMtide) encompassing the phosphorylated histidine and several residues from PGM (LIRHGE) promoted growth arrest of several tumor cell lines, whereas proliferation of tested non-tumor cells was not influenced. Analysis of metabolic activity of one of the tumor cell lines, MCF-7, indicated that PGMtide inhibited glycolytic flux, consistent with in vivo inhibition of PGM. The specificity of the observed effect was further determined experimentally by testing the effect of PGMtide on cells growing in the presence of pyruvate, which helps to compensate PGM inhibition in the glycolytic pathway. Thus, growth of MCF-7 cells was not arrested by PGMtide in the presence of pyruvate.

Phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM, 1The abbreviations used are: PGM, phosphoglycerate mutase type B; NDPK, nucleoside diphosphate kinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; 2,3-BPG, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate; FCS, fetal calf serum; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. E.C. 5.4.2.1) is an enzyme of the glycolytic pathway where it catalyzes the conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate. Although this step is not considered to be rate-limiting in the majority of differentiated cells, there is increasing evidence from tumor cell lines that PGM may regulate the balance between glycolysis and another ATP-producing pathway, glutaminolysis (1Mc Keehan W.L.

J. 2001; 356: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In addition to tumor cells a rate-limiting role of PGM within the glycolytic pathway has also been shown in leukocytes and heart muscle (6Kashiwaya Y. Sato K. Tsuchiya N. Thomas S. Fell D.A.

PGM is activated by the cofactor 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG), which phosphorylates the enzyme at histidine. In tumor cells PGM is regulated by migration out of the glycolytic enzyme complex into the so-called pre-complex. The PGM associated within the glycolytic enzyme complex and within the pre-complex can be separated by free flow isoelectric focusing (4Mazurek S. Eigenbrodt E. Failing K. Steinberg P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 5Mazurek S. Zwerschke W. Jansen-Dürr P. Eigenbrodt E. Biochem.

The PGM enzyme associated within the glycolytic enzyme complex is fully activated and independent of 2,3-BPG, whereas the PGM enzyme found in the pre-complex is not fully active and can be activated by 2,3-BPG (4Mazurek S. Eigenbrodt E. Failing K. Steinberg P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 5Mazurek S. Zwerschke W. Jansen-Dürr P. Eigenbrodt E. Biochem.

In the pre-complex PGM is in close proximity to nucleoside diphosphate kinase type A (E.C. 2.7.4.6; NDPK A) (5Mazurek S. Zwerschke W. Jansen-Dürr P. Eigenbrodt E. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 9Mazurek S. Grimm H. Wilker S. Leib S. Eigenbrodt E. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 3275-3282PubMed Google Scholar). Migration of PGM out of the glycolytic enzyme complex into the pre-complex reduces the conversion of glucose to lactate and increases the flux rate through glutaminolysis as well as serine synthesis. In addition, ATP and GTP levels decrease, whereas UTP and CTP levels stay high. A low (ATP + GTP): (UTP + CTP) ratio is correlated with a high proliferation rate (10Ryll T. Wagner R. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1992; 60: 934-946Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 11Zwerschke W. Mazurek S. Massimi P. Banks L. Eigenbrodt E. Jansen-Dürr P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

NDPK directly couples ATP levels with other nucleoside triphosphates (5Mazurek S. Zwerschke W. Jansen-Dürr P. Eigenbrodt E. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 9Mazurek S. Grimm H. Wilker S. Leib S. Eigenbrodt E. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 3275-3282PubMed Google Scholar, 12Mazurek S.

Biomembr. 1997; 29: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). NDPK demonstrates a “ping-pong” mechanism of catalysis, and thus, upon incubation with nucleoside triphosphate-Mg, the enzyme becomes phosphorylated at a histidine residue, forming a relatively stable phosphohistidine intermediate. The phosphate can then be transferred to a NDP-Mg acceptor. Research on NDPK was stimulated when the cDNA of NDPK A was cloned as a transcript with reduced expression levels in tumor metastatic cells, termed Nm23-H1 gene (14Steeg P.S. Bevilacqua G. Kopper L.

Eight related genes have been thus far identified as members of the human Nm23 gene family (15Lombardi D. Lacombe M.-L. Paggi M.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 182: 144-149Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The only corresponding gene products that have been well characterized are Nm23-H1 and Nm23-H2, which encode NDPK A and B, respectively. In addition to their main function of phosphorylating nucleoside diphosphates, both isoforms show different additional biochemical activities (16Steeg P.S. Palmieri D. Ouatas T. Salerno M. Cancer Lett. 2003; 190: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 17Otero A.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Roymans D. Willems R. Van Blockstaele D.R. Slegers H. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2002; 19: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Nm23/NDPK protein isoforms have been reported to interact with a variety of cellular proteins and were found to be associated with different cellular compartments (17Otero A.S. J. Bioenerg.

Metastasis. 2002; 19: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In terms of alternative biochemical functions, Nm23-H2 was found to be a transcriptional activator for the c-myc proto-oncogene (19Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A.

In previous studies we have shown that PGM and Nm23-H1 (NDPK A) are associated and that the Nm23-H1 histidine kinase function is activated by association with GAPDH (5Mazurek S. Zwerschke W. Jansen-Dürr P. Eigenbrodt E. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 9Mazurek S. Grimm H. Wilker S. Leib S. Eigenbrodt E.

In the present study, PGM was identified as a protein phosphorylated by the Nm23-H1·GAPDH complex in vitro. Based on the phosphorylation site sequence, we developed a cell-permeable synthetic peptide that encompasses the PGM phosphorylation site and inhibits PGM activity as well as glycolysis in MCF-7 cells and other tumor cell lines. Expression of Recombinant Proteins and Purification—The His6-Nm23-H1·GAPDH complex was expressed from a bicistronic baculovirus vector in Sf9 insect cells and purified by affinity chromatography on Ni2+-agarose followed by pseudoaffinity chromatography on reactive yellow-agarose (Sigma) as described earlier (23Engel M. Seifert M. Theisinger B. Seyfert U. Welter C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20058-20065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The complete coding region of human PGM B was PCR-amplified from human kidney parenchyma cDNA and cloned into the BamHI/HindIII restriction sites of the pQE30 expression vector (Qiagen) using the primers 5′-taggatccatggccgcctacaaactg-3′ (forward) and 5′-cgaagcttaatgaaaatgggagccactg-3′ (reverse). After sequencing to ensure that the inserted sequence was correct, the plasmid was used to transform Escherichia coli JM109, the bacteria was grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.5, and expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and lysed, and the recombinant PGM was purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography under exactly the same conditions as described earlier for other His-tagged proteins (23Engel M. Seifert M. Theisinger B. Seyfert U. Welter C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20058-20065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In a second step the PGM eluted from the Ni2+-agarose column was dialyzed overnight against 20 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.1, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C. The protein was then passed over a hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad) previously equilibrated with the same buffer. Bound proteins were eluted using a linear gradient from 20 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4 buffer to 500 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4 buffer. The fractions containing PGM were pooled, dialyzed against storage buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 40% glycerol, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA), and stored at -20 °C. To generate the PGMH10G mutant protein, site directed mutagenesis was performed using the plasmid carrying the wild type sequence and the mutagenesis primers 5′-gtgctgatccggggcggcgagagcgca-3′ (forward) and 5′-tgcgctctcgccgccccggatcagcac-3′ (reverse). Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange™ kit from Stratagene according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression and purification of the PGMH10G mutant protein were carried out exactly as with the wild type protein. Screening of a cDNA Expression Library by in Situ Phosphorylation—To identify in vitro substrates of the Nm23-H1·GAPDH complex, a λ-TripleEx fetal brain cDNA expression library (Clontech) was screened. The phages were plated in LB top agar containing E. coli host cells and grown until plaques became slightly visible. Phages (10,000 plaque-forming units/plate) were blotted for 4 h at 37 °C onto nitrocellulose filter membranes (Duralose-UV™, Stratagene) previously soaked in 10 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. In addition, the plates were left with the membranes at 4 °C overnight. The nitrocellulose sheets were then removed, washed twice in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, and blocked in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm GTP, 2% bovine serum albumin. Filters were then incubated with recombinant GAPDH·Nm23-H1 complex (0.1 mg/ml) in the presence of 15 μm [γ-32P]GTP (0.37 millibecquerel/ml) in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 40 min at 30 °C in roller bottles. After washing 3 times with large volumes of ice-cold wash buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) for 5 min each, membranes were incubated in the same buffer containing 1 mm GDP for 10 min at room temperature under shaking to attenuate autophosphorylation of library-encoded NDPK isoenzymes. Filter membranes were washed again in ice-cold wash buffer and exposed wet to film for 2–4 days using intensifying screens at -80 °C. After the first autoradiography, nitrocellulose membranes that produced signals were subjected to acidic buffer treatment (0.2 m glycine/HCl, pH 1.5) and exposed to film again. The phage plaques corresponding to radioactive spots were excised from the plates, eluted, and used for a second round of plating and in situ phosphorylation screening. Only phages corresponding to autoradiographic spots that were abolished after the acidic washing step in the first round continued to produce signals in the secondary screenings. Single phage clones were excised from the agar plates, and the cDNA inserts were amplified by PCR using the LD insert screening amplimer set (Clontech, catalog no. 9107-1). PCR products were subcloned into pCR4.1 TOPO cloning vectors (Invitrogen), and the plasmids were sequenced. Phosphorylation of PGM by the Nm23-H1·GAPDH Complex—If not stated otherwise, phosphorylation assays were performed using 1 μg of recombinant PGM and 200 ng of Nm23-H1·GAPDH complex in a final volume of 25 μl in the following buffer: 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, 40 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Reactions were started by the addition of [γ-32P]GTP or [γ-32P]ATP to a final concentration of 20 μm (1 μCi per reaction). After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, 2 mm cold ATP was added to the samples to decrease the content of [32P]histidine-phosphorylated Nm23-H1 followed by SDS sample buffer pH 8.8 after a 5-min incubation. The samples were immediately applied to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis without prior heating. These precautions were taken to avoid artificial chemical transfer reactions. The SDS gels were prepared according to Laemmli except that Tris/HCl buffer pH 8.8 was used for both stacking and separating gels. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried without prior fixation at 80 °C under vacuum and autoradiographed overnight without intensifying screens. For the determination of phosphate incorporation into PGM, phosphorylation was stopped after incubation with [γ-32P]GTP by snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen. Before re-thawing, the solution was adjusted to 8 m urea, and paramagnetic beads loaded with Ni2+ were added to the samples to bind His-tagged proteins (PGM and GAPDH). Beads were washed quickly 4 times with a cold buffer consisting of 50 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 8.5, 6 m urea and counted in a liquid scintillation counter for 32P content. Phosphate incorporation per mol PGM was calculated based on counts of known amounts of [32P]GTP measured in parallel. To calculate possible background phosphorylation of His-tagged GAPDH, samples that had been prepared and incubated exactly as the PGM phosphorylation reactions except that PGM was omitted were also counted. Peptide Synthesis—The PGMtide peptide (MRQIKIWFPNRRMKWKKHHHHHHPWLIRHGE) and the control peptide (MRQIKIWFPNRRMKWKKHHHHHHPWRIEGHL) were synthesized by ThermoHybaid (formerly Interactiva), Germany. N-terminally fluorescein-coupled derivatives of these peptides and of another peptide lacking the Antennapedia domain (HHHHHHPWLIRHGE) were also synthesized. The freeze-dried peptides were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 m urea. In the experiments, the peptides were added to cells by rapid dilution into the fresh culture media. Isolation of the Glycolytic Enzyme Complex by Isoelectric Focusing— Cells were extracted with a homogenization buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm mercaptoethanol, pH 7.4. Isoelectric focusing was carried out with a linear gradient of glycerol (50 to 0% (v/v)) and ampholines (pI 3.5–10.5) as described previously (8Mazurek S. Hugo F. Failing K. Eigenbrodt E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 167: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Measurements of Enzyme Activities—Specific activities of PGM, NDPK, and GAPDH were measured as described earlier (8Mazurek S. Hugo F. Failing K. Eigenbrodt E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 167: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Engel M. Seifert M. Theisinger B. Seyfert U. Welter C. J. Biol.

For the heat inactivation assay, PGM was heated to 80 °C in 50 μl of a buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40, then chilled on ice. Cell Culture—MCF-7 and Tx3095 cell lines, rheumatoid synoviocytes, and amniotic fluid cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 5 mm glucose, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml, and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). The medium also contained 4 mm sodium pyruvate if not otherwise stated. GLC4 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented as described for MCF-7 and Tx3095 cells. Cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere under 95% air, 5% CO2. MDA-MB-453 cells were grown in Leibovitz L15 medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 4 mm pyruvate, 100 units penicillin/ml, 100 μg streptomycin/ml, and 10% FCS. Cells were grown at 37 °C in air-tight closed culture flasks. The breast carcinoma cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453 were obtained from the ATCC; the small cell lung carcinoma cell line GLC4 was a gift from the Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Groningen, The Netherlands. The glioblastoma cell line Tx3095 was cultivated over 68 passages from a resected glioblastoma in the Department of Human Genetics, Homburg, Germany. Human amniotic fluid cells had been cultivated and used before for diagnostic purposes at the Department of Human Genetics, Homburg. Rheumatoid synoviocytes were obtained from a patient who underwent therapeutic synovectomy at the Department of Orthopaedics, University Hospital, Homburg. Fluorescence Microscopy Using Fluorescein-linked Peptides—Fluorescein-linked versions of the peptides were added to the fully supplemented medium of MCF-7 cells grown directly on glass slides. After an incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, the cells were washed 3 times with medium, fixed for 5 min in PBS, 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature, washed 3 times in PBS, counterstained with DAPI solution, washed again 2 times with PBS, dried, and mounted with antifade solution (Vectorshield; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for examination using fluorescein isothiocyanate and DAPI filters. Glycolytic Flux Measurements—Cell culture supernatants were collected at different cell densities and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Glucose, pyruvate, lactate, glutamine, glutamate, serine, and alanine were measured in the thawed supernatants as described previously (27Bergmeyer H.U. 3rd Ed. Methoden der Enzymatischen Analyse.

For the determination of the metabolite conversion rates two different calculations were chosen; the calculation in nmol/(h × 105 cells) reflects the conversion rate of a number of cells. The calculation in nmol/(h × dish) was chosen for the correlation of different conversion rates. Identification of Protein(s) Phosphorylated by the Nm23-H1·GAPDH Complex in Vitro—To elucidate possible functions of the Nm23-H1·GAPDH protein kinase activity, an attempt was made to identify potential substrate proteins. For this purpose, a cDNA expression library in λ-phages was transferred to nitrocellulose filters and screened by incubation with the bacterially expressed Nm23-H1·GAPDH protein complex in the presence of [γ-32P]GTP-Mg. After autoradiography of the filters, few isolated radiolabeled spots were detected on the films (see the example in Fig. 1A, marked by an arrow), and the corresponding phage plaques were picked from the primary plates. After the first autoradiography, phosphorylation signals were further analyzed by incubating the membranes in acidic buffer (glycine/HCl pH 1.5) and re-exposing to film. Using this procedure, acid-labile phage phosphorylations could be detected and further discriminated from background spots. No true acid-stable phage phosphorylation signals, indicative of serine, threonine, or tyrosine phosphate, were found. Phage plaques having produced acid labile phosphorylations were picked and used for a second round of plating and screening. On the autoradiograph, the number of phosphorylated spots corresponding to phage plaques had increased (Fig. 1B), suggesting enrichment of phages displaying a phosphorylation substrate protein. The cDNA inserts of selected phage clones from the second-round plates were amplified by PCR and sequenced (marked by arrows in Fig. 1B). A BLAST search with the sequences revealed that among six non-redundant clones obtained from several plates, four contained the full-length coding sequence of human PGM B, whereas the two remaining clones contained 5′-cDNA sequences from PGM B of different length. The consensus coding sequences were identical to the gene bank entry for PGM B cDNA (accession number BC010038.1). Characterization of the Phosphorylation and Identification of the Phosphoamino Acid Phosphorylated by Nm23-H1—The complete coding sequence of PGM B was amplified by PCR. The PCR product was cloned into an expression vector, and the corresponding protein was expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. The purified protein was phosphorylated in the presence of Nm23-H1·GAPDH complex and [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]GTP but not in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]GTP alone (Fig. 2A). PGM was phosphorylated as a native protein as well as after denaturation by heat treatment. Because the heat treatment for 2 min at 80 °C was sufficient to completely inactivate PGM, as verified by activity measurements (Table I), this experiment excludes the possibility that PGM activity could be required for the observed phosphorylation.Table IInactivation of PGM by heat treatment PGM was heated to 80 °C for the times indicated, then chilled on ice. Activity was measured after the addition of substrates and coupling enzymes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The numbers given represent mean values of the specific activity from duplicate experiments.

However, maximum phosphorylation was achieved already after 1 min of incubation (Fig. 3). To be active, PGM normally requires small amounts of the co-factor 2,3-BPG, which serves as a phosphate donor for the initial activating autophosphorylation of the enzyme at histidine 10 at the active site. To determine whether the same residue might be targeted by Nm23-H1, histidine 10 was replaced by glycine using site-directed mutagenesis, and the mutant protein was bacterially expressed and purified. By this means it was possible to show that the His-10-Gly mutant was not phosphorylated by Nm23-H1·GAPDH (Fig. 2B), suggesting that it may be the phosphorylation site targeted by Nm23-H1·GAPDH in vitro. Dependence of Nm23-H1-induced PGM Activation on a Native Protein Complex Environment—Possible effects of the in vitro phosphorylation of PGM were then investigated. Hypothetically, Nm23-H1-dependent phosphorylation might activate dephosphorylated PGM in a similar manner to 2,3-BPG. However, we were unable to verify any effect of Nm23-H1 or Nm23-H1·GAPDH on purified PGM in vitro, possibly due to the low stoichiometry of phosphorylation. We hypothesized that the correct ratio and/or concentration of Nm23-H1·GAPDH and PGM as well as a defined orientation of the proteins in a complex environment might be essential for an interaction of Nm23-H1·GAPDH with PGM. To investigate Nm23-H1 involvement in PGM activation in the native complex, cytoplasmic proteins were extracted from proliferating MCF-7 cells and fractionated by isoelectric focusing, which allows separation of the so-called “glycolytic enzyme complex,” which contains most of the glycolytic enzymes, and the so-called “pre-complex,” which contains PGM, NDPK, and GAPDH as well as the cytosolic isoenzymes of the transaminases and glutamate dehydrogenase (Fig. 4A). Analysis of the isoelectric focusing fractions of the MCF-7 cells revealed that the PGM enzyme associated within the pre-complex (Fig. 4B, fractions 33–37) could be activated by 2,3-BPG, whereas the PGM enzyme associated within the glycolytic enzyme complex was only weakly activated (Fig. 4B, fractions 38–43). As described earlier (30Stankiewicz P.J. Gresser M.J. Tracey A.S. Hass L.F. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1264-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the addition of 0.5 mm orthovanadate into the enzyme assay leads to a complete inactivation of PGM in the absence of stoichiometric amounts of 2,3-BPG. Under these conditions, PGM activity is only measurable when the enzyme is permanently re-phosphorylated and, thus, reactivated by 2,3-BPG. In our study, in the presence of vanadate, a strong activation of PGM by 2,3-BPG was detected in the fractions of the pre-complex (Fig. 4C, fractions 33–37), whereas the PGM enzyme associated within the glycolytic enzyme complex was not activated (Fig. 4C, fractions 38–43). Most importantly, in the fractions of the pre-complex PGM was also activated by dCTP, whereas dCTP di"
https://openalex.org/W1969498126,"Lon protease is a multifunctional enzyme, and its functions include the degradation of damaged proteins and naturally short lived proteins, ATPase and chaperone-like activities, as well as DNA binding. A thermostable Lon protease from <i>Brevibacillus thermoruber</i> WR-249 (Bt-Lon) has been cloned and characterized with an N-terminal domain, a central ATPase domain that includes a sensor and substrate discrimination (SSD) domain, and a C-terminal protease domain. Here we present a detailed structure-function characterization of Bt-Lon, not only dissecting the individual roles of Bt-Lon domains in oligomerization, catalytic activities, chaperone-like activity, and DNA binding activity but also describing the nature of oligomerization. Seven truncated mutants of Bt-Lon were designed, expressed, and purified. Our results show that the N-terminal domain is essential for oligomerization. The truncation of the N-terminal domain resulted in the failure of oligomerization and led to the inactivation of proteolytic, ATPase, and chaperone-like activities but retained the DNA binding activity, suggesting that oligomerization of Bt-Lon is a prerequisite for its catalytic and chaperone-like activities. We further found that the SSD is involved in DNA binding based on gel mobility shift assays. On the other hand, the oligomerization of Bt-Lon proceeds through a dimer ↔ tetramer ↔ hexamer assembly model revealed by chemical cross-linking experiments. The results also showed that hydrophobic interactions may play important roles in the dimerization of Bt-Lon, and ionic interactions are mainly responsible for the assembly of hexamers."

Regulation of cardiac function depends on the appropriate cumulative activity of numerous ion channels in individual cardiomyocytes that are responsible for the sequential depolarization-repolarization cycle known as the action potential (AP). 1The abbreviations used are: AP, action potential; PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; αPMA, 4α-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PAF, platelet-activating factor; C-PAF, carbamyl-platelet-activating factor; PAFR, platelet-activating factor receptor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary cells; TASK-1, TWIK-related, acid-sensitive potassium channel-1; BIM-I, bisindoylmaleimide I; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; F, farad; TWIK, tandem pore domain weakly inwardly rectifying potassium channel. 1The abbreviations used are: AP, action potential; PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; αPMA, 4α-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PAF, platelet-activating factor; C-PAF, carbamyl-platelet-activating factor; PAFR, platelet-activating factor receptor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary cells; TASK-1, TWIK-related, acid-sensitive potassium channel-1; BIM-I, bisindoylmaleimide I; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; F, farad; TWIK, tandem pore domain weakly inwardly rectifying potassium channel. Although the major currents contributing to the AP have been described (1Marban E. Nature. 2002; 415: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), additional small currents at specific points of low conductance in the AP cycle are sufficient to induce repolarization abnormalities in isolated cells (2Barbuti A.

Heart J. 2002; 144: 769-781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and therefore arrhythmias in situ. These arrhythmias may contribute to the electrical abnormalities that lead to sudden death after myocardial infarction, which persists as the number one cause of death in the United States. We have focused on one channel that has been proposed to contribute to cardiac arrhythmias, TASK-1, a member of the recently described family of two-pore domain potassium channels (4Bayliss D.A. Sirois J.E. Talley E.M. Mol. Interv. 2003; 3: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The two-pore domain K channel family is composed of at least 15 different members. These channels are widely distributed in excitable tissue, primarily in the brain and heart, and in general are responsive to environmental cues such as temperature, pH, and stretch (5Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F793-F801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kim D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 648-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Several are also regulated by lipids such as arachidonic acid or platelet-activating factor (PAF) (7Maingret F. Patel A.J. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Honore E. J. Biol.

PAF is an inflammatory phospholipid that has been linked to arrhythmogensis in isolated canine ventricular myocytes (10Hoffman B.F. Guo S.D. Feinmark S.J. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 1996; 7: 120-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that PAF regulates the TASK-1 channel and determined that the arrhythmogenic effect of the stable PAF analog, carbamyl-platelet-activating factor (C-PAF) in mouse cardiomyocytes, is due to the inhibition of TASK-1 current in a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent manner (2Barbuti A. Ishii S. Shimizu T. Robinson R.B. Feinmark S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H2024-H2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this study, we elucidate the molecular mechanism of the C-PAF effect on TASK-1 current by identifying the ϵ isoform of PKC (PKCϵ) as a critical component in PAFR signaling. In addition, using site-directed mutagenesis, we have tentatively identified the critical residue that is the target for PKC in the murine channel. Myocyte Preparation—Mouse ventricular myocytes were isolated using a retrograde coronary perfusion method published previously (11Kuznetsov V. Pak E. Robinson R.B. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 40-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All the experiments were carried out according to the guidelines issued by the IACUC of Columbia University. Adult mice, 2-3 months old, were anesthetized with a xylazine and ketamine mix and heparinized, the heart was quickly removed, and the ascending aorta was connected to the outlet of a Langendorff column and perfused with 20-25 ml of a buffer solution (37 °C) containing (in mm): NaCl, 112; KCl, 5.4; NaHCO3, 4.2; MgCl2, 1.6; HEPES, 20; glucose, 5.4; NaH2PO4, 1.7; taurine, 10; l-glutamine, 4.1; minimum essential medium amino acids solution, 2%; minimum essential medium vitamin solution, 1%; adjusted to pH 7.4, and equilibrated with 100% O2. Next, the heart was perfused with an enzyme solution containing collagenase (0.2 mg/ml; Worthington Type II) and trypsin (0.04 mg/ml) at 35 °C for 10-12 min. After this perfusion, the atria were removed, and the ventricles were minced and transferred to a 50-ml flask with an enzyme solution containing collagenase (0.45 mg/ml), trypsin (0.08 mg/ml), Ca2+ (0.75 mm), and bovine serum albumin (4.8 mg/ml). The flask was shaken vigorously for 5-10 min at 32 °C before the supernatant was removed and the cells were collected by centrifugation; this operation was repeated two or three times, and additional disaggregated cells were collected. After centrifugation, the myocytes were resuspended in the buffer solution containing Ca2+ (0.75 mm) and bovine serum albumin and stored at room temperature until use. Rod-shaped, Ca2+-tolerant myocytes, obtained with this procedure, were used within 6 h of dissociation. Measurements were performed only on quiescent myocytes with clear striations. Plasmids—pCMV-TASK1 (cTBAK) consists of a 1.9-kb sequence of murine TASK-1 inserted in pcDNA3.1 (a kind gift of Dr. Yoshihisa Kurachi, University of Osaka, Osaka, Japan) and has been described previously (12Kim D. Fujita A. Horio Y. Kurachi Y. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). pEGFP-C1 and pIRES-EGFP were purchased from Clontech. pTIE (TASK1-IRES-EGFP) was constructed by inserting a 1.9-kb EcoR1 fragment from pCMV-TASK1 into EcoR1-digested pIRESEGFP. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on pTIE using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. Primers were designed to generate a mutation in pTIE in which threonine 381 was converted to alanine (T381A-pTIE): forward, 5′-TGCCTGTGCAGCGGGGCGCACGCTCGGCCATCAGCTCG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CGAGCTGATGGCCGAGCGCTGCGCCCCGCTGCACAGGCA-3′. Cell Culture and Transfection—Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) were grown in F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Twenty-four hours prior to transfection, cells were seeded into 6-well plates at 80-90% of confluence. Transfections were carried out with the GeneJammer transfection reagent (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and their medium was replaced with supplemented F-12 medium (900 μl/well). For each well, GeneJammer (6 μl) was incubated with Opti-MEM (90 μl) followed by the addition of DNA (1 μg). This mixture was then added to the wells, and 3 h later, an additional 2 ml of supplemented F-12 medium was added. After incubating overnight, the cells were washed, and their medium was replaced. Cells were either co-transfected with pCMV-TASK1 together with pEGFP-C1 (1 μg total, 3:1) or transfected with pTIE or T381A-pTIE (1 μg). 48 h after the transfection, the cells were checked under the microscope for green fluorescence. Approximately 20% of the cells were positive for EGFP, and these were then used for patch clamp experiments. Due to the culture-to-culture variability in the expression of TASK-1 current, most comparisons were made on matched controls from the same transfection. Summary results were then obtained by pooling data from several different culture preparations. Solutions and Recording Apparatus—The myocyte suspension or the coverslip with CHO cells was placed into a perfusion chamber, mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope. Unless otherwise indicated, CHO cells were superfused at room temperature with standard external Tyrode's buffer, containing (in mm): NaCl, 140; KCl, 5.4; CaCl2, 1; MgCl2, 1; HEPES, 5; glucose, 10; adjusted to pH 7.4. Recordings were begun after the current reached a stable baseline (usually 3-4 min after initial cell rupture). In myocytes, TASK-1 current is small and exists in the presence of numerous larger K+ currents. To increase the inward component of TASK-1 current and to block other potassium currents in myocytes, we used a modified high K+ external solution (modified Tyrode's) to reduce outward rectification of TASK-1 current. The composition of this solution was (in mm): NaCl, 100; KCl, 50; CaCl2, 1; MgCl2, 1; HEPES, 5; glucose, 10; tetraethylammonium, 1; CsCl, 5; adjusted to pH 7.4. Membrane potential and current were measured in the whole cell configuration using borosilicate glass pipettes with a tip resistance between 3 and 5 megaohms and filled with a pipette solution containing (in mm): aspartic acid, 130; KOH, 146; NaCl, 10; CaCl2, 2; EGTA, 5; HEPES, 10; MgATP, 2; pH 7.2. The stock solutions of C-PAF and of the PKC inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide (BIM-I; Calbiochem), were prepared in water and diluted to the final concentrations in Tyrode's or modified Tyrode's, as appropriate. The PKC activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), was prepared in Me2SO and then diluted in Tyrode's. The final Me2SO concentration did not exceed 0.1%, and the same concentration was present in the control solution. The peptides, ϵV1-2 (EAVSLKPT (13Johnson J. Gray M. Chen C.H. Mochly-Rosen D. J.

Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24962-24966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar)) were synthesized by the Columbia University Protein Core. Peptides were prepared in water and then diluted in the pipette solution to a final concentration of 100 nm. Myocytes treated with the peptides were monitored continuously beginning immediately after rupture to detect the occurrence of any arrhythmias during dialysis of the peptide. The application of C-PAF to cells treated with the inhibitor peptide was started after the peptide had been permitted to dialyze into the cell (8-10 min after rupture for CHO or 10-12 min after rupture for myocytes). The current and the voltage protocols were generated using Clampex 8.0 software applied by means of an Axopatch 200-B and a Digidata 1200 interface (Axon Instruments). In current clamp mode, for recording action potentials, the signals were filtered at 1 KHz (low pass Bessel filter) and acquired at a sampling rate of 5 KHz. In voltage clamp mode, the current signals were filtered at 1 KHz and acquired at 500 Hz. Data Analysis and Statistics—Data were analyzed using pCLAMP 8.0 (Axon) and Origin 6.0 (Microcal) and are presented as mean ± S.E. Records have been corrected for the junction potential, which was measured to be -9.8 mV. Steady state currents were determined by computer calculation of average current over at least 1 min. Unless otherwise stated, current density comparisons were determined at a voltage of +30 mV. Current density changes are expressed as percentage of inhibition in CHO cell experiments in which TASK-1 is essentially the only current and a pretreatment baseline current can be readily recorded. In myocytes, TASK-1 is measured as the drug-sensitive current, and thus, it is not possible to measure a baseline current to normalize the result when studying the effect of C-PAF or PMA on TASK-1. Therefore, changes in this current in myocytes are expressed in absolute values (pA/pF). Fisher's exact test was used to test the significance of frequency data, and Student's t test was used to compare paired or independent data; a value of p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. C-PAF Inhibition of TASK-1 Current in CHO Cells Requires Activation of PKC—Untransfected CHO cells have no significant endogenous K+ currents (data not shown); thus, all of the current measured in transfected cells was carried by TASK-1. Therefore, we expressed TASK-1 in CHO cells to test the effect of C-PAF (185 nm) on the current in whole cell patch clamp experiments. During a slow ramp protocol (-110 mV to +30 mV in 6 s), C-PAF rapidly induced a reversible decrease in TASK-1 current that reached steady state within 2 min. When quantified at the maximal current (at +30 mV), this set of cells expressed 68.6 ± 16.4 pA/pF in control solution versus 60.2 ± 14.3 pA/pF in the presence of C-PAF, a 12% decrease in the mean current density (Fig. 1A; n = 9, p = 0.01). We next tested whether the effect of C-PAF on TASK-1 current was due to PKC activation by perfusing the cells with BIM-I (100 nm), a nonisoform-specific PKC inhibitor for 2 min before applying C-PAF. In the presence of BIM-I, there was no measurable C-PAF-sensitive current (Fig. 1B, n = 12). To determine whether activation of PKC alone was sufficient to reduce TASK-1 current, we treated CHO cells expressing TASK-1 with a nonspecific activator of PKC, PMA (100 nm). PMA significantly inhibited TASK-1 current in a manner that was similar to the effect of C-PAF (Fig. 1C; n = 11, p < 0.01). The specificity of the PMA effect was verified by exposing cells to an inactive PMA analogue, 4α-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (αPMA; 100 nm). αPMA had no detectable effect on TASK-1 current expressed in CHO cells (Fig. 1D). In all TASK-1-expressing cells tested, the mean control current was 71.8 ± 12.3 pA/pF, whereas in the presence of PMA, the current fell to 59.2 ± 10.1 pA/pF. The PMA inhibition (19.8 ± 2.7%, n = 17) was significantly greater than that of C-PAF (12.1 ± 1.0%, n = 20; p < 0.01) when measured at the maximum test voltage of +30 mV, and was irreversible. The Activation of PKCϵ Decreases TASK-1 Current in CHO Cells—Having shown that the activation of PKC by either C-PAF or PMA was sufficient to cause a decrease of the TASK-1 current, we next asked whether one specific isoform of PKC was responsible for this effect. We initially discounted the role of the classical PKC isoforms since preliminary studies had suggested that the C-PAF effect on TASK-1 was not calcium-dependent (data not shown). Given the prominent role of PKCϵ in cardiac physiology, we tested the ability of a PKCϵ-specific inhibitor peptide to block the drug-induced reduction in TASK-1 current. A scrambled peptide was used as a control (13Johnson J. Gray M. Chen C.H. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24962-24966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The peptides were introduced to the cells by dialysis through the patch pipette at a final concentration of 100 nm, and recordings were initiated 8-10 min after the rupture of the membrane to allow the peptide to equilibrate in the cell. C-PAF failed to inhibit TASK-1 current in the presence of the PKCϵ inhibitor peptide (25.6 ± 12.2 pA/pF before C-PAF versus 25.4 ± 12.4 pA/pF after C-PAF, n = 8, not significant; Fig. 2A). On the contrary, in the presence of the scrambled peptide, C-PAF-induced inhibition of TASK-1 (8.4 ± 1.5%, n = 10) did not differ from control trials in the absence of any peptide (data not shown). Similarly, the addition of the PKCϵ inhibitor peptide to the pipette completely blocked the PMA-sensitive current in CHO cells expressing TASK-1 (Fig. 2B; 42.4 ± 12.7 pA/pF before PMA versus 41.2 ± 12.3 pA/pF after PMA, n = 10, not significant), whereas the PMA effect was still present with the scrambled peptide (45.1 ± 7.0 pA/pF before PMA versus 36.6 ± 6.2 pA/pF after PMA, n = 11, p < 0.01). Summary data for C-PAF and PMA are shown in Fig. 2C. Does C-PAF Inhibition of TASK-1 Current in Ventricular Myocytes Depend upon Activation of PKCϵ?—We next asked whether the C-PAF-sensitive current in murine ventricular myocytes, defined previously as a TASK-1 current (2Barbuti A. Ishii S. Shimizu T. Robinson R.B. Feinmark S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H2024-H2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), was also mediated by activation of PKCϵ. Recordings were done either with the PKCϵ inhibitor peptide or with the scrambled peptide in the patch pipette while cells were held at -10 mV. Ten to twelve min after the rupture of the membrane and when the holding current was stable for at least 1 min, C-PAF (185 nm) was superfused over the myocytes. In the presence of the scrambled peptide, C-PAF caused a decrease in outward current that was indistinguishable from the effect of C-PAF in the absence of peptide (a typical trace is shown in Fig. 3A). The effect of C-PAF was absent, however, when the PKCϵ inhibitor peptide was included in the patch pipette (a typical trace is shown Fig. 3B). Results from numerous trials showed that the inhibitor peptide significantly inhibited the ability of C-PAF to reduce TASK-1 current in isolated mouse ventricular myocytes, whereas the scrambled peptide had no effect (Fig. 3C). To further verify that the C-PAF-sensitive current identified in voltage clamp studies was carried by the TASK-1 channel, the I-V relation in myocytes was studied with a slow ramp protocol (-50 mV to +30 mV over 6 s) in the presence of modified Tyrode's. These conditions minimize the contamination of the TASK-1 current by other K+ currents and should allow the calculation of the C-PAF-sensitive current over a wide voltage range by minimizing the outward rectification. To confirm this, we first examined the expressed TASK-1 current in CHO cells in modified Tyrode's. As expected, the I-V relation was markedly less rectifying (data not shown), and the reversal potential was less negative (-24.4 ± 1.5 mV, as compared with a calculated value of -27.5 mV in modified Tyrode's for a K+-selective current). The C-PAF inhibition in the presence of elevated K+ (10.2 ± 1.8% inhibition, n = 16) was indistinguishable from the previously reported effect of the lipid on TASK-1 in CHO cells recorded in normal Tyrode's (p = 0.33). In modified Tyrode's solution, myocytes exposed to the scrambled peptide in the patch pipette had a significant decrease in net current in response to C-PAF (a typical cell is shown in Fig. 4A1; n = 8; p < 0.01) that was essentially identical to the effect measured in the absence of peptide in the pipette (data not shown). Typical of TASK-1 in high K+, the C-PAF-sensitive current is nearly linear and has a reversal potential of -26.1 ± 1.9 mV (Fig. 4A2). In the presence of the inhibitor peptide, however, the C-PAF had virtually no effect on net current (Fig. 4B1), and the C-PAF-sensitive current was abolished (Fig. 4B2), indicating that PKCϵ also plays a crucial role in the regulation of TASK-1 current by PAFR in myocytes. Summary data are shown in Fig. 4C. Does PKCϵ Play a Role in C-PAF-induced Repolarization Abnormalities in Isolated Myocytes?—We previously showed that C-PAF induced abnormal automaticity in paced ventricular mouse myocytes and elicited spontaneous activity in quiescent myocytes (2Barbuti A. Ishii S. Shimizu T. Robinson R.B. Feinmark S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H2024-H2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Now, we asked whether this abnormal automaticity could be due to PKCϵ activation. To test this, action potential recordings were done on mouse ventricular myocytes paced at 1 Hz with either the PKCϵ-specific inhibitor peptide or an inactive scrambled peptide in the pipette (100 nm). Action potentials were continuously monitored, from the rupture of the membrane until the end of the protocol. C-PAF was applied 10-12 min after the rupture. When the scrambled peptide was in the pipette, C-PAF induced abnormalities during repolarization in 14 of 19 cells (Fig. 5A; not different from the response of cells treated with C-PAF in the absence of any peptide). In contrast, C-PAF failed to induce repolarization abnormalities in any of the eight cells that were exposed to the PKCϵ-specific inhibitor peptide (Fig. 5B). The difference in observed responses was significant (p < 0.001, Fisher's exact test). Further confirming that activation of PKCϵ is sufficient to alter the electrical activity of the myocyte, we observed that a specific activator peptide of this kinase included in the patch pipette induced prolongation of repolarization, early after depolarizations, and additional spontaneous beats in eight of nine cells tested in the absence of any added C-PAF. In these trials, recordings were begun immediately after the rupture of the membrane, and abnormal rhythm occurred 5-6 min later. Under similar conditions but with the scrambled peptide in the pipette, abnormal automaticity was observed in only 2 of 10 cells tested (Fig. 6; p < 0.006; Fisher's exact test). An analysis of the murine TASK-1 sequence revealed a single PKC consensus site that included threonine (residue 381) as the kinase target. Therefore, we constructed a site-directed mutant at this site, converting Thr-381 to alanine. The mutant construct, named T381A-pTIE, was expressed in CHO cells, and when tested by our typical ramp protocol, it demonstrated activity that was comparable with the wild-type channel. However, the mutant channel was no longer sensitive to C-PAF inhibition (maximal current recorded at +30 mV in the absence of C-PAF was 45.5 ± 7 pA/pF versus the current in the presence of C-PAF, 44.2 ± 7 pA/pF; n = 10; not significant, Fig. 7). Similar results were obtained when mutant TASK-1 current was tested in the presence of PMA (Fig. 7C, right). Previous studies have shown that the abnormalities of repolarization induced by PAF in ventricular myocytes are due to alterations of the background potassium current carried by TASK-1 (2Barbuti A. Ishii S. Shimizu T. Robinson R.B. Feinmark S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H2024-H2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Shortly after the channel was cloned, heterologous expression studies showed that TASK-1 was inhibited by PMA and that the inhibition could be blocked by BIM-I (16Lopes C.M.B. Gallagher P.G. Buck M.E. Butler M.H. Goldstein S.A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16969-16978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for PKC in the regulation of channel function. We now show that both overexpressed and native TASK-1 are inhibited by activation of the PAFR and that this inhibition is dependent upon the activation of the ϵ isoform of PKC. The activation of PKCϵ is not only necessary but also sufficient to alter repolarization in isolated myocytes. This sufficiency is evident both by the ability of PMA to inhibit TASK-1 current in CHO cells and by the ability of a PKCϵ activator peptide to induce abnormal automaticity in myocytes in the absence of added PAF. The results obtained when the TASK-1 channel is overexpressed in a heterologous system support the myocyte data by confirming that PAF inhibits TASK-1 in a PKCϵ-dependent manner. Furthermore, in the heterologous system, PKCϵ appears to be the only PKC isoform involved in the regulation of murine TASK-1 since blocking PKCϵ is sufficient to fully block the PMA effect on the channel. Murine TASK-1 has a single consensus PKC site, which is threonine-381, a residue in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we mutated this site, replacing threonine with the nonphosphorylatable residue, alanine. The T381A mutant expresses normally in CHO cells but is not inhibited by the addition of C-PAF, nor is it sensitive to PMA treatment. Although we have yet to show direct biochemical evidence of channel phosphorylation at this site, the mutagenesis studies certainly allow the recognition of Thr-381 as a critical residue in the PKC-dependent regulation of murine TASK-1 and are supportive of the hypothesis that this site is phosphorylated by PKCϵ, resulting in regulation of the channel. Although human TASK-1 is 83% identical to the murine channel, the PKC site is not in a region that is highly conserved. In fact, the cytoplasmic tail of human TASK-1 contains two putative PKC consensus sequences. It will be interesting to compare the regulation of the human TASK-1 with the murine homologue and determine its sensitivity to regulation by PAF and PKC. In addition to TASK-1, several other two-pore domain channels are regulated by kinase activity although the molecular mechanisms that underlie the regulation are not entirely clear. For example, TREK-1 (9Patel A.J. Honore E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) and its putative invertebrate homologue, the Aplysia S-K+ channel (17Shuster M.J. Camardo J.S. Siegelbaum S.A. Kandel E.R. Nature. 1985; 313: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), are inhibited by a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (18Bockenhauer D. Zilberberg N. Goldstein S.A.N. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 19Maingret F. Honore E. Lazdunski M. Patel A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In both channels, the effect is due to a change in the open probability of the channel. Human TWIK-1 and TWIK-2 are activated by the application of PMA when expressed in oocytes (20Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Barhanin J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 21Chavez R.A. Gray A.T. Zhao B.B. Kindler C.H. Mazurek M.J. Mehta Y. Forsayeth J.R. Yost C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7887-7892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). There does not appear to be any change in the single channel conductance. Rather, PMA appears to recruit previously silent channels within the cell-attached patch. In this case, however, there is no direct evidence of TWIK channel phosphorylation, and thus, the possibility that the altered channel function may be mediated by kinase action on a second protein cannot be discounted. Single channel studies of the Drosophila two-pore domain channel, Kcnk0, have described three gating states: one open and two closed. The two closed states are typified by either short or long intraburst closures. When the channel is phosphorylated, the open probability of the channel increases due to a decrease in the frequency and duration of the long-lasting closed state, resulting in an increase in the total current (22Zilberberg N. Ilan N. Gonzalez-Colaso R. Goldstein S.A.N. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 721-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, kinase-dependent modulation of two-pore domain channels is generally associated with altered open probability rather than a change in single channel conductance. In the case of TASK-1, four gating states have been proposed: two open (one principal and one substate with different conductance) and two closed (16Lopes C.M.B. Gallagher P.G. Buck M.E. Butler M.H. Goldstein S.A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16969-16978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 23Kim Y. Bang H. Kim D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1669-H1678PubMed Google Scholar). By analogy to other two-pore domain channels, phosphorylation of murine TASK-1 at Thr-381 might decrease the total current by favoring gating of the substate relative to the principal conductance state, decreasing mean open time, or increasing mean closed time. Single channel studies will be needed to reach a clear conclusion on this mechanism. Nevertheless, it does seem clear that channel regulation through activation of PKCϵ differs fundamentally from inhibition induced by methanandamide since neither PMA nor PAF reduces the current more than 20%, whereas methanandamide inhibition typically reaches ∼60% (2Barbuti A. Ishii S. Shimizu T. Robinson R.B. Feinmark S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H2024-H2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The role of PKCϵ in cardiac function is complicated by observations that this isoform can mediate the cardioprotective events of ischemic preconditioning (Ref. 24Ping P. Zhang J. Qiu Y. Tang X.-L. Manchikalapudi S. Cao X. Bolli R. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, and reviewed in Ref. 25Armstrong S.C. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 61: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), and under other conditions, plays a lead role in the development of hypertrophy and failure (26Pass J.M. Zheng Y. Wead W.B. Zhang J. Li R.C.X. Bolli R. Ping P. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H946-H955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of the explanations for these dichotomous results may lie in the variability of the level of expression of the kinase and in the subsequent control of its subcellular localization and formation of signaling complexes. For example, it has been shown that PKCϵ localizes in complexes at mitochondrial membranes after brief repeated episodes of ischemia. Could this sequester enough of the kinase to prevent its association with TASK-1 in the plasma membrane and thereby prevent the arrhythmogenic reduction in this background K+ current? Pharmacological antagonism of the PAFR or ischemic preconditioning are both able to significantly reduce the occurrence of ventricular ectopic beats after coronary occlusion (27Sariahmetoŏlu M. Çakici İ. Kanzik İ. Pharmac. Res. 1998; 38: 173-178Google Scholar) but likely work by different mechanisms. The effect of the PAFR antagonist is consistent with the known sequence of events that includes cardiac generation of PAF during ischemia, leading to inhibition of TASK-1 via a PKCϵ-dependent pathway and subsequent generation of abnormal repolarization in ventricular myocytes. This pathway may not occur after preconditioning if the repeated ischemic events lead to movement of PKCϵ away from the site where it may interact with TASK-1. We have previously noted the transient nature of the C-PAF induced current in isolated myocytes (2Barbuti A. Ishii S. Shimizu T. Robinson R.B. Feinmark S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H2024-H2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This is also evident in Fig. 3 and is presumably due to desensitization of the signaling cascade. It is not known whether the response is equally transient in the in situ heart. However, even a transient repolarization abnormality, if induced on the appropriate myocardial substrate as might be found in a diseased heart, could initiate a sustained arrhythmic event. In this regard, the outward rectifying nature of the TASK-1 I-V relation makes it particularly relevant to the plateau phase of the action potential. The plateau represents a period of high membrane resistance in which even small currents can exert a significant effect. It is well recognized that reduction in net outward current during the action potential plateau can lead to action potential prolongation and subsequent arrhythmias through the activation of other currents (3Anderson M.E. Al Khatib S.M. Roden D.M. Califf R.M. Am. Heart J. 2002; 144: 769-781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Further, in the setting of cardiac disease, down-regulation of outward K+ currents can result in the reduction of “repolarization reserve” (28Roden D.M. Pacing Clin. Electrophysiol. 1998; 21: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) such that even a small further decrease in net outward current can lead to marked action potential prolongation and arrhythmogenesis. In our experiments, it is likely that there is a progressive inhibition of TASK-1 current either by C-PAF or by the activator peptide activating PKCϵ. However, due to the repolarization reserve, a marked failure of repolarization and subsequent arrhythmias does not occur until the current is reduced beyond a critical threshold level. This accounts for the delay in the onset of arrhythmias during C-PAF superfusion and suggests that PAF-induced inhibition of TASK-1 current is likely to be particularly arrhythmogenic in the context of cardiac disease, in which other K+ currents are already compromised. We thank Irina Voloshyna for expert technical assistance, Dr. Robert Sciacca for statistical advice, and Dr. Mohamed Boutjdir for sharing some PKCϵ inhibitor peptide for preliminary studies."

Our sequence analysis suggests that two types of GDs have evolved separately. Plant, Caenorhabditis, Archaea, and some bacterial GDs belong to the cytidine deaminase (CDA) superfamily (1Betts L.

For example, the Bacillus subtilis GD (bGD) has been shown to be inducible with purines as nitrogen sources (3Fassbinder F. Kist M. Bereswill S. FEMS Microbiol.

On the other hand, mammalian, insect, fungal, and some bacterial GDs belong to the TIM barrel metallohydrolase superfamily (5Holm L. Sander C.

Thus, GD may have the potential to be an attractive candidate for the study of applications, including drug design and diagnostics.In addition to GDs mentioned above, the purine/pyrimidine deaminases in the CDA superfamily include CDAs, fungal cytosine deaminases, dCMP deaminases (dCMPDs), riboflavin biosynthesis proteins (RibGs), and RNA editing enzymes containing either an adenosine deaminase or a cytidine deaminase domain (1Betts L.

These deaminases catalyze the zinc-assisted conversion of the amino group of the cytosine, guanine, or adenine moiety into a keto group. The substrates in the CDA superfamily are made up of similar building blocks, namely base, ribose, and phosphate (Fig. 1). A major challenge is to understand how nature has evolved the CDA fold of these various deaminases to act on their substrates. Two questions may be posed. First, are similar or dissimilar residues used to interact with the common moieties of the substrates? Second, can the specific substrate-interacting residues for each deaminase be predicted through combinations of structural and bioinformatics methods? To gain structural insights into the substrate specificity and evolution of bGD, we have solved the enzyme structure at 1.17-Å resolution.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESThe protein crystallization, diffraction data collection, phase determination using selenium multiwavelength anomalous detection, and the building of an initial dimeric model have been described in our preliminary report (18Chang Y.J.

Multiple sequence alignments of 25 and 32 homologous sequences for dCMPD and RibG, respectively, were performed by ClustalW (25Chenna R. Sugawara H. Koike T. Lopez R. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3497-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (4014) Google Scholar). This was followed by manual editing according to the structural information and secondary structure prediction using PSI-PRED (26McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2665) Google Scholar). Finally, the conserved residues in each family were mapped on the known structures to reveal whether they are potentially localized nearby the active site cavity.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe Overall Structure—Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments demonstrated that the enzyme exists in solution as a homodimer. In the crystal there is one dimer per asymmetric unit, and there are no significant differences between the two subunits except for the N-terminal seven residues and the side chains of several arginines and lysines (root mean square deviation of 0.82 Å for all protein atoms of residues 8–156). The current model contains two extra residues (His (–2) and Ala (–1)), residues 1–156 from subunit A, and residues 2′–156′ from subunit B.Unexpectedly, bGD forms an intertwined dimer through C-terminal domain swapping (Fig. 2). The protein structure consists of a central five-stranded β-sheet (β1–β4 and β5′ of the adjacent subunit) with the strand order 2, 1, 3, 4, and 5′ and with β1 running antiparallel to other strands. The β-sheet is sandwiched by helices αA, αD1, and αE′ on one side and helices αB, αC, and αD2 on the other side. The helices αD1 and αD2 extend away from the subunit core and wrap around the adjacent subunit, leading to the C-terminal segment, residues 123–156, which is swapped. Consequently, the β5 strand of one chain forms hydrogen bonds to the β4 strand of the other in a parallel manner, thereby completing the five-stranded β-sheet of the CDA fold. The swapping results in a very extensive intersubunit interface that buries 3900 Å2 of the 10200-Å2 molecular surface area per monomer.More than 45 residues from each subunit, including many conserved residues in the GD family, are involved in dimer formation. The dimer is stabilized mainly by the formation of the wide interhelical hydrophobic packing of helices αA and αD1 with αE′ and the packing of αB, αC, and αD2 with αB′, αC′, and αD2′. In addition, there are 26 direct hydrogen bonds between the protein atoms, including salt bridges between Lys8 and Glu139, Asp49 and Arg60, and Arg94 and Asp113. Interestingly, the side chains of the conserved Arg60 from both subunits stack very well, with a distance of 3.6 Å between the guanidino groups.The Active Site Architecture and Substrate Binding—The active site contains one tightly bound metal ion, even though no metal ions were added either during protein purification or crystallization. The metal ion was identified by a very strong spherical electron density in the Fourier map and was assigned as zinc based on zinc anomalous data (18Chang Y.J. Huang C.H. Hu C.H. Liaw S.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1152-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The zinc ion is tetrahedrally coordinated by His53 Nδ1 (2.06 Å), Cys83 Sγ (2.34 Å), Cys86 Sγ (2.28 Å), and a water molecule, WAT1 O (2.03 Å) (Fig. 3A).There was a significant electron density peak for a five-atom aromatic ring in the 2Fo – Fc and Fo – Fc electron density maps (Fig. 3A). The signal was assigned as an imidazole from elution off the nickel column, because it occupies the putative position of the imidazole group of the substrate guanine with extensive interactions (Fig. 3). The N1 atom interacts with Asn42 Nδ2 (3.29 Å) and Tyr156′ Oη (2.90 Å), and the N3 atom contacts with Asp114 Oδ1 (2.86 Å). The imidazole ring of His53 and the phenyl ring of Phe26 stack on the imidazole ring with an interplanar distance of 3.3–3.4 Å. The C2 atom also makes close contacts with Trp92′ Cη2 (3.63 Å), Phe112 Cδ1 (3.89 Å), and Tyr156′ Cϵ1 (3.52 Å). Three strong peaks in the active site were assigned as water molecules (Fig. 3A). WAT1 ligates the zinc ion as the fourth ligand. It also makes close contact with Glu55 Oϵ2 (2.58 Å) and Cys83 N (2.95 Å) and would occupy the OH2 position of the reaction intermediate. WAT2 forms hydrogen bonds with Asn42 Nδ2 (2.95 Å) and Ala54 N (3.12 Å) and also binds at the O6 position of the intermediate. WAT3 interacts with Glu81 O (2.50 and 2.88 Å in the subunits A and B, respectively) and Asp114 Oδ2 (3.09 and 3.03 Å, respectively) and would seem to be near to the NH 22 group of the intermediate or the leaving ammonium (27Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter Jr., C.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4768-4774Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).On the basis of the tightly bound WAT1, WAT2, and imidazole molecules described above, the transition state analogue 1, 2-dihydroxanthine (DHX) was modeled into the active site (Figs. 1 and 3). Hypoxanthine is expected to be converted by bGD into DHX, because similar inhibitors have been used in previous crystallographic studies of Escherichia coli CDA (eCDA) and yeast cytosine deaminase (yCD) (1Betts L. Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter Jr., C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 635-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 2Ko T.P. Lin J.J. Hu C.Y. Hsu Y.H. Wang A.H.J. Liaw S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19111-19117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). After modeling, energy minimization was performed by CNS as a structural refinement. The nucleophilic OH2 group of the purine ring coordinates to the catalytic zinc ion (2.05 Å) and interacts with Glu55 Oϵ2 (2.58 Å) and Cys83 N (2.98 Å). Additionally, the N1 atom makes close contact with Glu55 Oϵ1 (2.73 Å), the N3 atom with Asp114 Oδ2 (2.84 Å), the O6 atom with Ala54 N (3.11 Å) and Asn42 Nδ2 (2.96 Å), the N7 atom with Asn42 Nδ2 (3.29 Å) and Tyr156′ Oη (2.87 Å), and the N9 atom contacts with Asp114 Oδ1 (2.82 Å). In addition to the extensive hydrogen bond network, the imidazole ring of His53 and the phenyl ring of Phe26 stack on the purine ring with an interplanar distance of 3.3–3.4 Å. Also, the C8 atom of the purine ring makes close contacts with Trp92′ Cη2 (3.65 Å), Phe112 Cδ1 (3.84 Å), and Tyr156′ Cϵ1 (3.50 Å). The hydrogen bonds between the substrate and the conserved residues are virtually identical to those found in yCD and CDAs (1Betts L. Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter Jr., C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 635-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 2Ko T.P. Lin J.J. Hu C.Y. Hsu Y.H. Wang A.H.J. Liaw S.H. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15505-15513Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Two classes of CDAs have been identified: (i) a dimeric and pseudo-tetrameric form such as eCDA that utilizes one histidine and two cysteines for zinc ion coordination; and (ii) a tetrameric form such as bCDA that uses three cysteines instead. Detailed structural comparisons reveal that the conserved structural elements in the CDA fold include the strands β1–β5 and the helices αA–αC (Fig. 4A). The main chain atoms of the 65–70 structurally equivalent residues overlay with a root mean square deviation of 1–1.35 Å and 8–24% sequence identity. The strong conservation of the tertiary structures of these domains suggests that they are evolutionarily descended from a common structural fold, the CDA fold. To date, enzymes of this CDA fold exist as an oligomer and lack disulfide bonds. Similarly, the active site cavity in the CDA superfamily is mainly made up of the αA-β1, β2-αB, β3-αC, and β4-αD loops and the C-terminal tails.The dimeric yCD has an intramolecular active site (2Ko T.P. Lin J.J. Hu C.Y. Hsu Y.H. Wang A.H.J. Liaw S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19111-19117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), whereas the dimeric bGD contains an intersubunit one. In contrast, the active site of the tetrameric bCDA is built from three subunits (28Johansson E. Mejlhede N. Neuhard J. Larsen S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2563-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The active sites of bGD, yCD, eCDA, and bCDA share virtually identical interaction networks between the attacking water molecule, the zinc ion, the three protein ligands, the base glutamate, and the common moiety of the pyrimidine ring (Fig. 4B). The absolute conservation of a proline residue prior to the conserved cysteine in the CDA superfamily (Pro82 in bGD) may be due to the fixation in orientation of the backbone O (Glu81 O in bGD) for interaction with both the amino group and the leaving ammonium molecule (27Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter Jr., C.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4768-4774Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of the conserved signatures HXE (or CXE) and PCXXC in the CDA superfamily indicates a similar zinc-assisted deamination mechanism.Therefore, on the basis of the structural studies on bGD, yCD, and CDAs (2Ko T.P. Lin J.J. Hu C.Y. Hsu Y.H. Wang A.H.J. Liaw S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19111-19117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 27Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter Jr., C.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4768-4774Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), a deamination mechanism for bGD is proposed as outlined in Scheme 1. The nucleobase guanine binds to the active site, and its direct contacts with the C-terminal tail induces the tail to cover the active site entrance, sequestering the reaction from solvent. Glu55 serves as a proton shuttle, abstracting a proton from the zinc-activated water to form the attacking hydroxide ion on the one hand and, on the other hand, protonating the N1 of guanine to form the tetrahedral intermediate. Subsequently, Glu55 also assists the proton transfer from OH2 to NH22 to facilitate the cleavage of the carbon-nitrogen bond. The newly formed xanthine may move toward the zinc ion for ligation, and this would weaken its interaction with the C-terminal tail, allowing its release from the active site.Scheme 1The proposed catalytic mechanism for bGD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Structural Divergence in the CDA Superfamily—One of the major variations is the state of protein oligomerization. The dimeric bGD cannot be superimposed on the dimeric yCD and tetrameric bCDA because of the different relative orientations between the subunits. However, all of these deaminases utilize the helical layer(s) and the C-terminal tail for oligomerization. Only one helical layer contributes to the interface in CDAs and yCD, whereas both helical layers are used in bGD because of the domain swapping.A second variation is the C-terminal segment beyond strand β4, which is hypervariable and contributes to substrate recognition through a switching of the active site entrance and/or direct interaction. To date, all of the available structures are in a closed conformation. In bGD, yCD, and bCDA, the C-terminal tail forms a “flap” across the entrance that regulates both substrate binding and product release (2Ko T.P. Lin J.J. Hu C.Y. Hsu Y.H. Wang A.H.J. Liaw S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19111-19117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 28Johansson E. Mejlhede N. Neuhard J. Larsen S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2563-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C). However, the active site entrance switch in eCDA is more complicated, perhaps acting through three loops from the adjacent monomer, and remains unclear (1Betts L. Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter Jr., C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 635-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The C-terminal tails in both yCD and bGD contain conserved substrate recognition residues such as Asp155 in yCD and Tyr156 in bGD. These residues seal the active site entrance upon substrate binding and thus limit the size of the substrate binding pocket for the nucleobases. On the other hand, the highly flexible C-terminal tail of bCDA would seem to enlarge the active site cavity to accommodate the larger nucleoside substrate (2Ko T.P. Lin J.J. Hu C.Y. Hsu Y.H.

Because calcium is an important regulator of keratinocyte function, the effect of modulating extracellular calcium on MMP-9 expression in OSCC cell lines was evaluated. Increasing extracellular calcium induced a dose-dependent increase in MMP-9 expression in immortalized normal and premalignant oral keratinocytes, but not in two highly invasive OSCC cell lines. Differential activation of MAPK signaling was also induced by calcium. p38 MAPK activity was down-regulated, whereas ERK1/2 activity was enhanced. Pharmacologic inhibition of p38 MAPK activity or expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of the upstream kinase MAPK kinase 3 (MKK3) increased the calcium induced MMP-9 gene expression, demonstrating that p38 MAPK activity negatively regulated this process. Interestingly blocking p38 MAPK activity enhanced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting reciprocal regulation between the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways. Together these data support a model wherein calcium-induced MMP-9 expression is differentially regulated by the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways in oral keratinocytes, and the data suggest that a loss of this regulatory mechanism accompanies malignant transformation of the oral epithelium.

Although OSCC is characterized by local, regional, and distant spread, the biochemical factors that underlie dissemination are poorly understood (1Jordan R.C. Daley T. J. Can. Dent.

OSCC tumors demonstrate a progressive lack of basement membrane staining, more diffuse invasion, and a higher frequency of lymph node metastasis, suggesting that basement membrane loss reflects metastatic potential (4Kumagai S.

This is consistent with immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization studies of human OSCC tumors that implicate enzymes belonging to the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family, including MMP-9 (92-kDa gelatinase B), in basement membrane proteolysis and tissue invasion. The presence of gelatinolytic activity attributable to activated MMP-9 in OSCC biopsy specimens correlates with immunohistochemical staining of frozen sections and is enhanced in both highly invasive and metastatic cases, suggesting a correlation between MMP-9 activity and metastatic potential (8Hong S.D.

Additional studies of human tumors have shown that MMP-9 is up-regulated in diffuse invasive OSCC specimens, with predominant localization to the invasive front (4Kumagai S. Kojima S. Imai K.

Immunohistochemical analysis of human keratinocytes indicates a correlation between MMP-9 expression and differentiation. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated concomitant calcium-regulated expression of MMP-9 with the keratinocyte terminal differentiation marker involucrin, providing additional evidence for the association of MMP-9 transcriptional regulation and cellular differentiation (17Kobayashi T.

Results of the current study demonstrate that increasing extracellular calcium induced a dose-dependent increase in MMP-9 expression in immortalized normal and premalignant oral keratinocytes, but not in highly invasive OSCC cells. Differential activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling was also induced by calcium. p38 MAPK activity was down-regulated, whereas extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) activity was enhanced. Pharmacologic inhibition of p38 MAPK activity or expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of the upstream kinase MKK3 increased the calcium-induced MMP-9 gene expression, demonstrating that p38 MAPK activity negatively regulated this process. Interestingly blocking p38 MAPK activity enhanced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting reciprocal regulation between the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways. Together these data support a model wherein calcium-induced MMP-9 expression is differentially regulated by the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways in oral keratinocytes, and the data suggest that a loss of this regulatory mechanism accompanies malignant transformation of the oral epithelium.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Cell culture reagents and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Sigma.

Oda (University of Washington, Seattle, WA) (18Oda D. Bigler L. Lee P. Blanton R. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 226: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Telomerase reverse transcriptase-immortalized normal oral keratinocytes (OKF6/T cells) and malignant OSCC cell lines (SCC25 and SCC68) were provided by Dr. J. Rheinwald (Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Institutes of Medicine, Boston, MA) (19Rheinwald J.G. Beckett M.A. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 1657-1663PubMed Google Scholar). SCC4 and CAL27 cells were obtained from ATCC (American Tissue Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). pp126 cells were maintained in keratinocyte serum-free medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 50 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract supplied with the medium, and 0.09 mm CaCl2. All other cells were maintained in keratinocyte serum-free medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 25 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract (supplied with the medium), 0.2 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, and 0.31 mm CaCl2. Cells were plated in low calcium (0.09 mm) medium and serum-starved for 24 h prior to treatment with high calcium (1.6 mm). In additional experiments, inhibitors or other chemical reagents were added 30 min prior to treatment with calcium.Analysis of MMP-9 Expression—Gelatinase activities in the conditioned media at 36 h were determined using SDS-PAGE gelatin zymography as described previously (20Munshi H.G. Stack M.S. Methods Cell Biol. 2002; 69: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, SDS-polyacrylamide gels (9% acrylamide) were co-polymerized with 0.1% gelatin, and samples were electrophoresed without reduction or boiling using 5× Laemmli sample buffer (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). SDS was removed through a 30-min incubation in 2.5% Triton X-100, and gels were incubated in 20 mm glycine (pH 8.3), 10 mm CaCl2, 1 μm ZnCl2 at 37 °C for 24-36 h. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize zones of gelatinolytic activity. Levels of MMP-9 protein in the conditioned media were also quantified by ELISA (Oncogene Research Products) according to the manufacturer's specifications.MMP-9 RNA Levels—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent according to manufacturer's instructions. Following digestion with RQ1 DNase for 30 min at 37 °C, the total RNA concentration was determined by spectrophotometric measurement. Primer pairs for human MMP-9 and human GAPDH were as follows: forward primer 5′-AAGATGCTGCTGTTCAGCGGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GTCCTCAGGGCACTGCAGGAT-3′ for MMP-9 and forward primer 5′-CGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGTAT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GCAGGTCAGGTCCACCACTGAC-3′ for GAPDH (22Wong H. Muzik H. Groft L.L. Lafleur M.A. Matouk C. Forsyth P.A. Schultz G.A. Wall S.J. Edwards D.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 151: 305-320PubMed Google Scholar). The length of the MMP-9 and GAPDH amplicons was 256 and 680 base pairs, respectively. RT-PCR was performed using the one-step RT-PCR kit where reverse transcription and DNA amplification occur in the same reaction. Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was used as template in a reaction that included the appropriate primers in the presence of both reverse transcriptase and Taq polymerase. The mixture was incubated at 45 °C for 30 min and cycled 30 times at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. Appropriate negative controls of amplification included reactions without reverse transcriptase. PCR products were visualized by UV transillumination of 1.5% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide.MMP-9 Promoter Activity—pGL3 luciferase reporter vector (Promega) containing MMP-9 promoter (-573 to +30 from the start site) was kindly provided by Dr. L. Hudson (University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM). pRSV vector containing either the constitutively active MKK3Glu or the dominant negative mutant of MKK3Ala was generously provided by Dr. R. J. Davis (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA) (23Enslen H. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1741-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Subconfluent cells grown in low calcium medium were transfected with 2 μg of MMP-9 promoter/luciferase reporter construct using TransIT keratinocyte (Mirus) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In additional experiments, 1 μg of either the dominant negative or the constitutively active mutant of MKK3 was co-transfected with the MMP-9 luciferase construct. Six h later, the cells were washed with serum-free medium to remove the unbound DNA-lipid complexes and shifted to medium containing increasing calcium for 36 h. The cells were then lysed, and luciferase activities were determined by luminometry. The results were normalized to protein concentration and expressed relative to control cells maintained in low calcium condition.ERK1/2 Phosphorylation—Following treatment with calcium, the cells were lysed at the indicated times in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing proteinase and phosphatase inhibitors. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (9% gels), and the blots were probed with anti-ERK1/2 antibody (1:2000) to detect total ERK1/2 expression or probed with antiphosphorylated ERK1/2 (1:1000) antibody to detect active forms of ERK as reported previously (24Munshi H.G.

The cells were lysed in phosphorylation lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Hepes, 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) for 60 min at 4 °C, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 as detailed previously (25Uddin S.

The immunoprecipitated proteins were washed three times in phosphorylation lysis buffer and two times in kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mm MgCl2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP), and the immunocomplex kinase assays were initiated by the addition of 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μg of Hsp-25 protein (Stress Gen Laboratories) as a substrate and 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and was terminated by the addition of SDS-sample buffer. Proteins were subsequently analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated form of Hsp-25 was detected by autoradiography.RESULTSExtracellular Calcium Regulates MMP-9 Expression—Because calcium-mediated changes in MMP-9 expression have been linked to keratinocyte differentiation, the effect of calcium on MMP-9 expression in immortalized normal (OKF6) or premalignant (pp126) oral keratinocytes and malignant OSCC cells (SCC4, CAL27, SCC25, and SCC68) was evaluated. Cells were cultured in low calcium (0.09 mm), serum-starved overnight, and incubated with fresh medium containing increasing concentrations of calcium (0.09-1.6 mm) for 24 h, followed by analysis of MMP-9 by gelatin zymography and ELISA. Whereas normal and premalignant oral keratinocytes (OKF6 and pp126) increased MMP-9 expression in response to calcium (Fig. 1), MMP-9 expression was not calcium-inducible in SCC68 and SCC25 cells (Fig. 1B). No MMP-9 expression was detectable in SCC4 and CAL27 cells (not shown). This was confirmed by ELISA, showing an increase in MMP-9 antigen levels in response to calcium in OKF6 and pp126 cells (Fig. 2), whereas the MMP-9 level in SCC68 and SCC25 cells remained unaltered (Fig. 2B). To determine whether the calcium-induced MMP-9 expression was due to enhanced transcriptional activation, luciferase reporter gene assays were performed using the sequence of -573 to +30 of the MMP-9 promoter. Cells lines were transfected with MMP-9 promoter luciferase fusion constructs, serum-starved overnight, and treated with a gradient of calcium (0.09-1.6 mm) for 24 h. Similar to results obtained by gelatin zymography and ELISA, a dose-dependent increase in transcriptional activation of the MMP-9 promoter was observed with increasing calcium in normal and premalignant oral keratinocytes, resulting in a 2-5-fold increase in promoter activity (Fig. 3, A and B), whereas calcium did not induce MMP-9 promoter activity in SCC68 and SCC25 cells (Fig. 3, C and D). As these data indicated a calcium-induced increase in MMP-9 mRNA levels, representative RT-PCR analysis was performed using OKF6 and SCC68 cells. These data support the results of promoter/luciferase assays, showing an increase in MMP-9 mRNA in response to calcium in OKF6 cells (Fig. 4A) but not SCC68 cells (Fig. 4B). GAPDH controls were unaltered in response to extracellular calcium (Fig. 4, A and B, lower panels). Together these data suggest that normal or premalignant oral keratinocytes respond to extracellular calcium signals via changes in MMP-9 expression.Fig. 2ELISA analysis of calcium-induced MMP-9 expression. OKF6 (A) and pp126, SCC25, and SCC68 (B) cells were plated in low calcium (0.09 mm) medium.

To determine whether the calcium-induced MMP-9 expression was mediated via an ERK1/2-dependent pathway, the effect of calcium on ERK1/2 activation was examined. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h in low calcium followed by treatment with calcium (final [Ca2+] of 1.6 mm) and then were lysed at the indicated time points and analyzed for phosphorylated ERK1/2 by Western blot analysis. A rapid induction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation occurred in response to extracellular calcium in OKF6 and pp126 cells, peaking at 15 min and decaying to near basal levels by 60 min (Fig. 5, A and B). Densitometric analysis indicated that calcium enhanced ERK1/2 phosphorylation by ∼2-3-fold, with maximal effect seen at 15 min (Fig. 5, A and B). Total ERK1/2 expression levels remained constant (Fig. 5, A-D, T-ERK blots). In contrast, no further increase in ERK1/1 phosphorylation was observed in response to calcium in SCC68 and SCC25 cells (Fig. 5, C and D).Fig. 5Extracellular calcium promotes ERK1/2 phosphorylation only in normal and premalignant oral keratinocytes. OKF6 (A), pp126 (B), SCC25 (C), and SCC68 (D) cells were serum-starved overnight in low calcium (0.09 mm) medium followed by treatment with medium containing 1.6 mm calcium for the indicated time periods. Cells were lysed, and lysates (50 μg of protein) were electrophoresed on 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The lysates were probed with antiphospho-ERK1/2 antibody (1:1000 dilution) to detect the phosphorylated, active form of ERK1/2 (upper blots) or with anti-ERK1/2 antibody (1:2000 dilution) to detect total ERK1/2 (T-ERK) expression (lower blots), followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence detection.

To evaluate the effect of extracellular calcium on p38 MAPK activity, the ability of the p38 MAPK-activated kinase MAPKAPK2 to phosphorylate a substrate (Hsp-25) was analyzed using an immunocomplex kinase assay. OKF6 cells were serum-starved for 24 h followed by culture in low (0.09 mm) or high (1.6 mm) calcium for 1 h. Harvested cells were then lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-MAPKAPK2 or control IgG as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” The immunoprecipitates were utilized to catalyze in vitro phosphorylation of the MAPKAPK2 substrate Hsp-25 using radiolabeled [γ-32P]ATP. A calcium-dependent decrease in MAPKAPK2 activity was observed, as evidenced by a 30% decrease in phosphorylation of Hsp-25 by cells grown in high calcium (Fig. 6, second and fourth lanes). In control experiments, a pharmacologic inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase (SB203580) abolished Hsp-25 phosphorylation (Fig. 6, third and fifth lanes).

https://openalex.org/W2065779969,"Abstract The metalloprotease ADAMTS-1 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type I motif), similarly to other members of the ADAMTS family, is initially synthesized as a zymogen, proADAMTS-1, that undergoes proteolytic processing at the prodomain/catalytic domain junction by serine proteinases of the furin-like family of proprotein convertases. The goals of this study were to identify residues of the prodomain that play an essential role in ADAMTS-1 processing and to determine the identity of the convertase required for zymogen processing. To gain insight into the putative roles of specific prodomain residues in ADAMTS-1 biosynthesis, we performed biosynthetic labeling experiments in transiently transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing wild-type and prodomain mutants of proADAMTS-1. Cells expressing wild-type ADAMTS-1 initially produced a 110-kDa zymogen form that was later converted to an 87-kDa form, which was also detected in the media. Although convertases such as PACE4 and PC6B processed proADAMTS-1, we found that furin was the most efficient enzyme at producing the mature ADAMTS-1 87-kDa moiety. Site-directed mutagenesis of the two putative furin recognition sequences found within the ADAMTS-1 prodomain (RRNR173 and RKKR235) revealed that Arg235 was the sole processing site. Use of the Golgi disturbing agent, Brefeldin A, and monensin suggests that the cleavage of proADAMTS-1 takes place in the Golgi apparatus prior to its secretion. Conserved residues within the prodomain of other ADAMTS members hinted that they might act as maturation determinants. Replacement with alanine of selected residues Cys106, Tyr108, Gly110, Cys125, and Cys181 and residues encompassing the 137-144 sequence significantly affected the biosynthetic profile of the enzyme. Our results suggest that conserved residues other than the furin cleavage site in the prodomain of ADAMTS-1 are involved in its biosynthesis."

Fortunately, all organisms possess chaperones, a group of proteins that assist with folding. Escherichia coli use the chaperone DnaK and its co-chaperones DnaJ and GrpE. Under conditions of heat stress, DnaK binds to misfolded proteins and undergoes conformational changes facilitated by DnaJ and GrpE. These changes cause the release of the now partially refolded protein which either spontaneously finishes folding or is rebound by chaperones. Full-Text PDF Open Access DnaK is the major 70-kDa heat shock protein of Escherichia coli and is required for cell growth at low and high temperatures. DnaK and its co-chaperones are involved in a wide variety of biological processes involving protein folding, disassembly, disaggregation, and translocation, as well as targeting proteins for degradation (reviewed in Refs. 1Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar and 2Fink A.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 425-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). DnaK, the catalytic component of the DnaK chaperone system, consists of an N-terminal ATP-binding domain and a C-terminal substrate-binding domain. DnaJ is a 41-kDa DnaK co-chaperone that is composed of four domains: an N-terminal J domain involved in interactions with DnaK, a glycine and phenylalanine rich region, a zinc finger domain, and a C-terminal domain thought to bind and present specific substrates to DnaK. Strains carrying deletions in dnaJ have several phenotypes, including failure to grow above 42 °C, immotility, inability to grow phage λ, and inability to stably maintain mini-F and mini-P1 plasmids. The current model for the mechanism of reactivation of heat-inactivated proteins by DnaK is that ATP-bound DnaK binds and releases heat-denatured polypeptides rapidly through interactions with exposed hydrophobic regions (1Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar, 3McCarty J.S. Buchberger A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Mol.

DnaJ stimulates hydrolysis of ATP bound to DnaK, forming the ADP-bound state of DnaK, which stabilizes the DnaK-substrate interaction. GrpE, another DnaK co-chaperone, binds to the ATPase domain of DnaK and induces nucleotide exchange. Conformational changes in DnaK accompanying ADP/ATP exchange force the release of the substrate and DnaJ. When released from DnaK, the substrate is likely in a partially unfolded conformation and either refolds spontaneously or is rebound by chaperones. During non-stress conditions, DnaK acts on specific native proteins, including P1 RepA and σ32 (6Wickner S. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Nature. 1991; 350: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 7Gamer J. Bujard H. Bukau B. Cell. 1992; 69: 833-842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). We suggested a model for the mechanism of native protein remodeling by the DnaK chaperone system in which native substrates are bound by DnaJ through exposed high affinity DnaJ binding sites (8Wickner S. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7903-7907Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). DnaJ then targets the substrate for recognition by DnaK through interactions between DnaJ and DnaK. Once bound, the mechanism of remodeling by DnaK is similar with native proteins as with denatured proteins. In addition to DnaK, E. coli possesses two other Hsp70 homologs and five other DnaJ-like proteins. One of the DnaJ homologs is CbpA. It was originally isolated based on its ability to bind curved DNA (curved DNA-binding protein) (9Ueguchi C. Kakeda M. Yamada H. Mizuno T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1054-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). CbpA is one of the major nucleoid-associated proteins of E. coli, and it binds DNA nonspecifically, although it has higher affinity for curved DNA than for non-curved DNA (9Ueguchi C. Kakeda M. Yamada H. Mizuno T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1054-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 10Azam T.A. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33105-33113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). CbpA is poorly expressed during the exponential phase of growth, but is up-regulated in late stationary-phase growth, during phosphate starvation, and by growth at low pH (11Yamashino T. Kakeda M. Ueguchi C. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 12Tucker D.L. Tucker N. Conway T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6551-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In late stationary-phase cells, there are an estimated 15,000 copies of the protein per cell or roughly one CbpA molecule per 640 bp of DNA (13Ali Azam T. Iwata A. Nishimura A. Ueda S. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6361-6370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of CbpA is 39% identical to that of DnaJ, except it lacks the 69-amino acid cysteine-rich zinc finger domain of DnaJ. Under some in vivo conditions, CbpA is a functional homolog of DnaJ (14Ueguchi C. Shiozawa T. Kakeda M. Yamada H. Mizuno T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3894-3896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When CbpA is expressed from a multicopy plasmid, it suppresses the phenotypes of a dnaJ deletion strain by restoring growth at high temperature and allowing mini-F and phage λ to grow (9Ueguchi C. Kakeda M. Yamada H. Mizuno T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1054-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A cbpA deletion mutant exhibits no apparent growth phenotypes; however, a cbpA,dnaJ double deletion strain is unable to grow below 16 °C or above 37 °C, a phenotype resembling that of dnaK deletion strains (14Ueguchi C. Shiozawa T. Kakeda M. Yamada H. Mizuno T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3894-3896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The double deletion strain is also defective in cell division and exhibits significantly reduced viability during carbon starvation (14Ueguchi C. Shiozawa T. Kakeda M. Yamada H. Mizuno T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3894-3896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In light of the sequence homology and in vivo functional overlap between CbpA and DnaJ, it seemed likely that CbpA, like DnaJ, could function as a DnaK co-chaperone in vitro. The current study was undertaken to examine this possibility, and the results demonstrate that CbpA possesses DnaJ-like activity in vitro. However, CbpA differs from DnaJ in some aspects. For example, it lacks autonomous chaperone activity. During the course of the study, we discovered that there is an open reading frame, yccD, located downstream of cbpA within the same operon. The protein encoded by yccD, which shares some homology to DafA of Thermus thermophilus, was isolated and found to interact with CbpA. The consequence of this interaction was the inhibition of both the DnaJ-like co-chaperone activity and the DNA binding activity of CbpA. Based on these results, the product of the yccD gene has been named CbpM, for “CbpA modulator.” Together CbpA and CbpM are capable of activating and modulating the activity of the DnaK chaperone system, respectively. Plasmids and Strains—To construct the CbpM expressing plasmid, pETcbpM, a cbpM PCR fragment from E. coli strain DH5α was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into pET24b (Novagen). The gene sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmid pCU60 (14Ueguchi C. Shiozawa T. Kakeda M. Yamada H. Mizuno T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3894-3896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used for the overexpression of CbpA (gift from Drs. Ueguchi and Mizuno, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan). Plasmid pS15-12 (15Yamada H. Muramatsu S. Mizuno T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) was the gift of Drs. Yamada, Muramatsu, and Mizuno, Nagoya University. Proteins and DNA—CbpM was isolated from BL21 cells harboring pETcbpM. The cells were grown at 37 °Ctoan A600 of 0.4 and were then induced for 2 h with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were harvested, suspended in Buffer A (10% glycerol (v/v), 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm DTT) 1The abbreviation used is: DTT, dithiothreitol. containing 100 mm NaCl, and lysed in a French pressure cell. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged (20,000 × g, 45 min), and the pellet was suspended in 15 ml of Buffer A containing 6 m urea. The solution was frozen, thawed, and then centrifuged (20,000 × g, 45 min). The supernatant was dialyzed against Buffer A. The sample was applied to a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer and proteins were eluted with a NaCl gradient (0-0.5 m NaCl in Buffer A). Fractions containing CbpM, as determined by SDS-PAGE, were pooled, applied to a Sephacryl-S100 gel filtration column, and eluted with Buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl. Fractions containing CbpM were stored at -70 °C. The identity of the protein was confirmed by amino acid sequencing. CbpA (9Ueguchi C. Kakeda M. Yamada H. Mizuno T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1054-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), RepA (16Wickner S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2690-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), DnaJ (17Zylicz M. Yamamoto T. McKittrick N. Sell S. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7591-7598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), DnaK (18Skowyra D. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25296-25301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and GrpE (18Skowyra D. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25296-25301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were isolated as described previously. HU was a gift from K. Mizuuchi (National Institutes of Health), and H-NS was from D. Jin (National Institutes of Health). All proteins were greater than 95% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE, and protein concentrations are expressed as molar amounts of RepA dimers, DnaK monomers, GrpE dimers, DnaJ dimers, CbpA dimers, and CbpM monomers. Radiolabeled RepA, CbpA, and CbpM were 3H-labeled in vitro using succinimidyl propionate, N-(propionate-2,3-3H) (19Hoskins J.R. Pak M. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12135-12140Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). DNA containing the origin of replication of mini-P1 was 3H-labeled (2720 cpm/fmol) in vitro as described (6Wickner S. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Nature. 1991; 350: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequencing was performed by Commonwealth Biotechnologies, Inc. (Richmond, VA). DNA Binding Assay—Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained Buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol (v/v)), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgOAc, 0.005% Triton X-100 (v/v), 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 13 fmol of [3H]oriP1 plasmid DNA, and CbpA as indicated. CbpM and other DNA-binding proteins were added in amounts indicated in the legend to Fig. 5. The mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 24 °C and filtered through nitrocellulose filters, and the retained radioactivity was measured. Chaperone Assays—To measure activation of RepA, reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained Buffer B, 1 mm ATP, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgOAc, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.005% Triton X-100 (v/v), 4 nm RepA, 7.6 nm of DnaJ or 4 nm CbpA, 430 nm DnaK, and 114 nm GrpE, unless indicated otherwise. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 24 °C, then 13 fmol of [3H]oriP1 DNA and 1 μg of calf thymus DNA were added. The resulting mixtures were incubated 5 min at 0 °C, filtered through nitrocellulose filters, and the retained radioactivity was measured. To quantify rhodanese aggregation, rhodanese (40 μm) was denatured in 5.5 m guanidine HCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 20 mm DTT for 30 min at 24 °C. To measure autonomous chaperone activity, denatured rhodanese was diluted 100-fold in reaction mixtures (200 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, and 0.6 μm CbpA or 0.6 μm DnaJ. Synergistic co-chaperone activity was measured by diluting denatured rhodanese 100-fold in reaction mixtures (200 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgOAc, 2 mm ATP, 1.3 μm DnaK, 0.02 μm CbpA or 0.02 μm DnaJ as indicated in the legend to Fig. 4 and 0.2 μm CbpM where indicated. Light scattering was monitored at 500 nm in a LS50B Luminescence Spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to determine the levels of rhodanese aggregation. Western Blot Analysis—Protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen) by electroblotting. CbpA, CbpM, and σS were detected with specific rabbit antiserums using a Western blot immunodectection kit (Novex Western Breeze, Invitrogen). There was no detectable cross-reactivity between the CbpA and CbpM antiserums (data not shown). The cbpA and yccD Operon—In the E. coli genome, cbpA is in an operon with an open reading frame, yccD, encoding the 11.4 kDa protein, YccD, that we have named CbpM. The cbpA reading frame overlaps cbpM by one base pair, and there does not appear to be a separate promoter for cbpM. Blastp queries of the public protein data bases identified CbpM homologs in a diverse group of bacteria, including Shigella flexneri, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Coxiella burnetii, Streptomyces avermitilis, and Geobacter sulfurreducens. In each of these organisms, the cbpM homolog exists in an operon with cbpA or dnaJ and is located downstream of the dnaJ-like gene. Furthermore, the reading frame overlap between cbpA and cbpM is conserved in several of these organisms. Further data base queries using Fasta revealed that CbpM has amino acid sequence similarity to DafA (DnaK assembly factor) of T. thermophilus. The similarity between these proteins was also detected by Psi Blast in the second iteration. The gene encoding DafATth exists in an operon with several other genes coding for chaperones and is downstream of dnaJTth (20Motohashi K. Yohda M. Endo I. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17343-17348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In vitro, DafA mediates the assembly of DnaK, DnaJ, and DafA into ring-like structures composed of a trimer each of DnaKTth, DnaJTth, and DafATth (20Motohashi K. Yohda M. Endo I. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17343-17348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Reinstein and colleagues (21Klostermeier D. Seidel R. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) proposed that DafATth maintains the assembled chaperone system in a resting state during normal growth and prevents DnaKTth from acting on inappropriate substrates by competing with proteins with low affinity for DnaKTth. They suggested that during heat shock unfolded substrates displace DafATth from DnaKTth and activate the chaperone function of DnaKTth. More recently Yoshida and colleagues (22Watanabe Y.H. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15723-15727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have suggested an alternative mechanism in which DafATth is a thermosensor and the DnaKTth chaperone system is activated by heat inactivation of DafATth. The consistent presence of cbpM and its homologs in operons also encoding DnaJ-like proteins suggested that the expression of these proteins might be linked. Expression of cbpA is induced in a σS-dependent manner in E. coli as the bacterium enters stationary-phase growth (11Yamashino T. Kakeda M. Ueguchi C. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To determine whether cellular levels of CbpM followed the same pattern of expression as CbpA, samples were taken from bacterial cultures in progressing growth phases. Western immunoblotting was used to detect intracellular levels of CbpA and CbpM throughout the growth cycle. The levels of both CbpA and CbpM were low during exponential-phase growth but increased dramatically during late stationary-phase growth (Fig. 1, A and B). As a control, σS levels were also monitored by immunoblotting. As with CbpA and CbpM, σS levels were low during exponential-phase growth and increased as cells entered stationary-phase growth (Fig. 1C). However, CbpA and CbpM accumulate later in stationary phase than σS. Taken together with the genetic organization of the operon, these data suggest that CbpM is co-expressed with CbpA. CbpA Has DnaJ-like Co-chaperone Activity in Vitro, and CbpM Inhibits Its Activity—We purified CbpA and tested it for co-chaperone activity in vitro using the DnaK-dependent P1 RepA activation assay. DnaK, in a reaction requiring DnaJ and ATP, mediates the conversion of inactive RepA dimers to active monomers, which bind oriP1 DNA with high affinity (6Wickner S. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Nature. 1991; 350: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) (8Wickner S. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7903-7907Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In conditions where spontaneous nucleotide exchange is slow, GrpE is also required for RepA activation (18Skowyra D. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25296-25301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When CbpA was incubated with DnaK, GrpE, and RepA, RepA was activated (Fig. 2B). Activation was similar to that mediated by DnaJ, DnaK, and GrpE (Fig. 2A). Consistently about a 2-fold lower concentration of CbpA than DnaJ was required for maximal activation. Unlike activation by DnaJ and DnaK, activation by CbpA and DnaK required GrpE with the assay conditions utilized (Fig. 2, A and B). These results show that CbpA possesses DnaJ-like co-chaperone activity in vitro. The co-expression of CbpA and CbpM suggested that there might also be functional linkage between the two proteins. We included CbpM in the RepA activation assay to see if it would affect CbpA co-chaperone activity. When increasing amounts of CbpM were added to the reaction mixtures with CbpA, DnaK, and GrpE, activation was significantly inhibited (Fig. 2C). No inhibition was seen when CbpM was added to activation reaction mixtures with DnaJ, DnaK, and GrpE (Fig. 2C). Importantly, addition of CbpM to CbpA reaction mixtures after RepA activation had no effect on RepA DNA binding (Fig. 2D). These data demonstrate that CbpM specifically inhibits the co-chaperone activity of CbpA while not inhibiting the co-chaperone activity of DnaJ. CbpA Interaction with RepA—We previously showed that an intermediate in the RepA activation reaction is a RepA-DnaJ complex containing a dimer each of RepA and DnaJ (16Wickner S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2690-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To determine whether CbpA also formed stable complexes with RepA, size exclusion chromatography was performed. Chromatographed independently, RepA and CbpA eluted as expected for a RepA dimer (64.4 kDa) and CbpA dimer (68.8 kDa), respectively (Fig. 3). When RepA and CbpA were incubated together prior to gel filtration, the apparent molecular mass shifted to ∼150 kDa, suggesting that RepA-CbpA complexes formed, likely containing a dimer of each protein (Fig. 3). These observations imply that, as seen with DnaJ, CbpA binds native substrates and targets them for recognition by DnaK. CbpA Prevents Protein Aggregation in a Reaction Requiring DnaK, and CbpM Inhibits This Co-chaperone Activity—DnaJ, independent of DnaK, possesses autonomous in vitro chaperone activity, as measured by prevention of aggregation of denatured proteins (23Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). To determine whether CbpA was a functional homolog of DnaJ in this aspect as well, rhodanese aggregation assays were performed. Rhodanese, denatured in guanidine HCl, was diluted into mixtures containing DnaJ or CbpA and light scattering was monitored as a measure of aggregation. DnaJ (0.6 μm), in the absence of DnaK and ATP, prevented protein aggregation (Ref. 23Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar; Fig. 4B). CbpA, however, was not able to prevent protein aggregation at concentrations between 0.6 and 6 μm (Fig. 4A and data not shown). Consistently, CbpA caused a 20-30% increase in rhodanese-dependent light scattering. We then asked whether CbpA acts synergistically with DnaK to prevent protein aggregation. When lower concentrations (20 nm) of CbpA (Fig. 4C) or DnaJ (Fig. 4D; Ref. 23Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) were assayed in the presence of DnaK and ATP, both CbpA and DnaJ exhibited co-chaperone activity in preventing protein aggregation. With the conditions used, DnaK alone did not prevent aggregation but required in addition CbpA or DnaJ and ATP (Fig. 4, C and D). Substitution of ADP for ATP failed to prevent aggregation (data not shown). GrpE was not required for inhibition of aggregation by DnaK in conjunction with either CbpA or DnaJ. When rhodanese was diluted into reaction mixtures containing CbpA, DnaK, and CbpM, rhodanase aggregated (Fig. 4E). CbpM had no effect on the ability of DnaJ to prevent protein aggregation (Fig. 4F). Taken together, these data demonstrate that CbpA can function as a co-chaperone with DnaK to prevent the aggregation of denatured protein and that CbpM specifically inhibits CbpA co-chaperone activity. DNA Binding by CbpA and Inhibition by CbpM—To further test the functional connection between CbpA and CbpM, we examined the effect of CbpM on the DNA binding activity of CbpA. In assays utilizing radiolabeled plasmid DNA, CbpA bound non-specifically to DNA (Fig. 5A). Under the same assay conditions, CbpM failed to bind DNA (Fig. 5B). However, when CbpM was added to DNA binding assays with CbpA, DNA binding by CbpA was inhibited (Fig. 5C). When CbpA was first incubated with DNA and then 10 min later CbpM was added, DNA binding by CbpA was similarly inhibited (Fig. 5C). To determine whether the DNA binding inhibition by CbpM was specific for CbpA, the effect of CbpM on DNA binding by several other DNA-binding proteins was tested. CbpM had no effect on the nonspecific DNA binding activity of HU and H-NS or on the weak DNA binding activity of DnaJ (Fig. 5D). These data suggest that CbpM is a specific inhibitor of CbpA DNA binding activity. The Co-chaperone Function of CbpA Is Not Active When CbpA Is Bound to DNA—Knowing that CbpA has two activities, DNA binding and DnaJ-like co-chaperone activity, we wanted to know whether participation in one activity precluded participation in the other. To examine this, increasing concentrations of plasmid DNA, which did not contain RepA binding sites, were added to RepA activation reactions containing either CbpA or DnaJ in combination with DnaK and GrpE. The addition of plasmid DNA inhibited the co-chaperone function of CbpA about 90% but had no significant effect on that of DnaJ (Fig. 6). This result suggests that when CbpA is bound to DNA, the substrate-binding site or DnaK-binding site is occluded. Interaction of CbpA and CbpM—The specific inhibition of CbpA co-chaperone and DNA binding activities by CbpM suggested that the two proteins interact. To determine whether there was a physical interaction, radiolabeled proteins were subjected to size exclusion chromatography. [3H]CbpA alone eluted with an apparent molecular mass of about 67 kDa, consistent with the existence of the native protein as a homodimer (Fig. 7A) (10Azam T.A. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33105-33113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). [3H]CbpM, an 11.4-kDa protein, eluted as a broad peak in the range expected for proteins of 15-60 kDa (Fig. 7B), suggesting that CbpM may exist in multiple oligomeric forms. To analyze complex formation between CbpA and CbpM, [3H]CbpA was incubated with CbpM, and the mixture was applied to the column. The labeled CbpA in the mixture again eluted as expected for a protein of about 67 kDa (Fig. 7C). However, when [3H]CbpM was incubated with CbpA and then subjected to gel filtration, the [3H]CbpM now eluted earlier, as expected for a protein of about 67 kDa (Fig. 7D). These data suggest that CbpA and CbpM form a complex in vitro. To confirm the formation of a CbpA-CbpM complex, native-PAGE was utilized. When electrophoresed independently, CbpA and CbpM formed well separated, unique species (Fig. 8A, lanes 1 and 2). When the two proteins were incubated together prior to native-PAGE, a new protein species appeared and the CbpA and CbpM bands diminished, suggesting that the proteins formed a complex (Fig. 8A, lane 3). The protein bands were excised, eluted, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. This revealed that the new protein species evident in the native acrylamide gel contained both CbpA and CbpM (Fig. 8B, lane 3). Additionally, amino acid sequencing of the N-terminal six amino acids of the excised complex demonstrated the presence of both CbpA and CbpM sequences in the mixture. We performed chemical cross-linking experiments to ascertain the stoichiometry of the CbpA-CbpM complex. Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (Pierce) was used to cross-link CbpA alone, CbpM alone, and complexes of CbpA and CbpM. The cross-linked proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then analyzed. Cross-linked CbpA migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 63 kDa, while untreated CbpA migrated as expected for a 35-kDa protein, providing further evidence that CbpA exists as a dimer (Fig. 9A, lanes 2 and 3). The majority of CbpM in both bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate-treated and untreated samples migrated in this gel system with an apparent molecular mass of 8 kDa, close to the calculated monomeric mass (Fig. 9A, lanes 4 and 5). However, a minor species with an apparent mass of 27 kDa was also present in cross-linked CbpM. Cross-linking of mixtures of CbpA that had been preincubated with CbpM resulted in the formation of a novel protein species in the gel that migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 48 kDa (Fig. 9A, lane 6). To determine the composition of the new protein species, the band was excised, eluted, and electrophoresed again. Separate immunoblots with specific anti-CbpA and anti-CbpM antibodies confirmed that the 48-kDa species was a complex of CbpA and CbpM (Fig. 9B). The molecular mass of this complex is most consistent with a 1:1 stoichiometry of CbpA (34.4 kDa) to CbpM (11.4 kDa), but it is possible the complex contains a 1:2 ratio of CbpA:CbpM. Together with the data from native-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography, these results demonstrate that CbpA and CbpM form a complex in solution. Because of the finding of Motohashi et al. (20Motohashi K. Yohda M. Endo I. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17343-17348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) that DnaJTth, DnaKTth, and DafATth form a stable complex containing a trimer of each component, we looked for ternary complexes of CbpA, DnaK, and CbpM. We were unable to detect stable association of CbpA, DnaK, and CbpM as analyzed by native-PAGE, chemical cross-linking, co-immunoprecipitation, and gel filtration at several different protein concentrations with or without ATP. Our data demonstrate that CbpA possesses in vitro co-chaperone activity in conjunction with DnaK and that the mechanism of action appears to be very similar to that of DnaJ. CbpA functioned with DnaK to prevent protein aggregation, as did DnaJ. Additionally, CbpA participated in the activation of RepA by forming a complex with RepA and then targeting it for remodeling by DnaK. Interestingly, there were differences between the activities of CbpA and DnaJ. CbpA, unlike DnaJ, does not possess autonomous chaperone activity in the prevention of denatured protein aggregation. This finding is consistent with the observation that other class II DnaJ homologs do not interact with unfolded proteins independent of DnaK/Hsp70. Another difference between DnaJ and CbpA co-chaperone functions is that activation of RepA by CbpA and DnaK depended on GrpE but activation by DnaJ and DnaK did not. A unique aspect of CbpA is its interaction with CbpM, a protein whose gene lies downstream of cbpA, within the same operon. CbpM shares homology with proteins encoded by genes located downstream of dnaJ-like genes in a range of diverse bacteria. The conserved grouping of these two genes suggested that they may act together. We isolated CbpM and discovered that CbpM specifically inhibited both the co-chaperone activity and the DNA binding activity of CbpA. Further analysis revealed that CbpM formed a complex with CbpA that likely contained a monomer of CbpA and one or two monomers of CbpM. Complexes of CbpA, DnaK, and CbpM were not detected nor were complexes of CbpM and DnaK or CbpA and DnaK. However, since CbpA and DnaK act together, there must be transient interactions between CbpA and DnaK, as there are between DnaJ and DnaK. In contrast to our results with E. coli proteins, Motohashi et al. (20Motohashi K. Yohda M. Endo I. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17343-17348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) observed that T. thermophilus DafA is required for the assembly of DnaKTth and DnaJTth into 300-kDa trigonal ring particles containing three monomers of each protein. Our current working model is that when CbpA is in a complex with CbpM, it is prevented from participating in protein remodeling with DnaK and from binding DNA. During certain growth or stress conditions, CbpA would be released from CbpM and activated to bind DNA. In addition, free CbpA would be recruited by DnaK to function as a co-chaperone. Although it is not known how CbpA is released from the inhibitory complex with CbpM and thereby activated, it is possible that CbpM is specifically inactivated or degraded as a result of the conditions that elicit the need for CbpA. The observations that both cbpA and cbpM share a single σS-dependent promoter and that both proteins accumulate during late stationary-phase growth suggest that cbpA and cbpM are not differentially regulated at the level of transcription or translation. This implies that some environmental signal or other stimulus is responsible for the post-translational regulation of the inhibitory function of CbpM, which modulates the activity of CbpA. Together, CbpA and CbpM are an interesting pair of proteins with the ability to activate and modulate the DnaK chaperone system, respectively. The in vivo role of CbpA remains unknown. Further work is required to elucidate the physiological role of CbpA both as a chaperone and as a DNA-binding protein and to reveal the mechanism of regulation of CbpA by CbpM. We thank Matthew Chenoweth and Joyce Wanga for helpful discussions and Matthew Chenoweth for his many helpful comments on the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2065817176,"Comprehensive studies of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in murine resident peritoneal macrophages (RPM) responding to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) revealed that the primary PGs produced by RPM were prostacyclin and PGE2. Detectable increases in net PG formation occurred within the first hour, and maximal PG formation had occurred by 6–10 h after LPS addition. Free arachidonic acid levels rose and peaked at 1–2 h after LPS addition and then returned to baseline. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and microsomal PGE synthase levels markedly increased upon exposure of RPM to LPS, with the most rapid increases in protein expression occurring 2–6 h after addition of the stimulus. RPM constitutively expressed high levels of COX-1. Studies using isoform-selective inhibitors and RPM from mice bearing targeted deletions of ptgs-1 and ptgs-2 demonstrated that COX-1 contributes significantly to PG synthesis in RPM, especially during the initial 1–2 h after LPS addition. Selective inhibition of either COX isoform resulted in increased secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α); however, this effect was much greater with the COX-1 than with the COX-2 inhibitor. These results demonstrate autocrine regulation of TNF-α secretion by endogenous PGs synthesized primarily by COX-1 in RPM and suggest that COX-1 may play a significant role in the regulation of the early response to endotoxemia. Comprehensive studies of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in murine resident peritoneal macrophages (RPM) responding to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) revealed that the primary PGs produced by RPM were prostacyclin and PGE2. Detectable increases in net PG formation occurred within the first hour, and maximal PG formation had occurred by 6–10 h after LPS addition. Free arachidonic acid levels rose and peaked at 1–2 h after LPS addition and then returned to baseline. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and microsomal PGE synthase levels markedly increased upon exposure of RPM to LPS, with the most rapid increases in protein expression occurring 2–6 h after addition of the stimulus. RPM constitutively expressed high levels of COX-1. Studies using isoform-selective inhibitors and RPM from mice bearing targeted deletions of ptgs-1 and ptgs-2 demonstrated that COX-1 contributes significantly to PG synthesis in RPM, especially during the initial 1–2 h after LPS addition. Selective inhibition of either COX isoform resulted in increased secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α); however, this effect was much greater with the COX-1 than with the COX-2 inhibitor. These results demonstrate autocrine regulation of TNF-α secretion by endogenous PGs synthesized primarily by COX-1 in RPM and suggest that COX-1 may play a significant role in the regulation of the early response to endotoxemia.

Two isoforms of COX have been identified and characterized (5Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2394) Google Scholar).

Kinetically, the two isoforms are virtually indistinguishable when 20:4 is used as substrate (10Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. Xu N. Huang Z.H. Gage D.A. Watson J.T. Lagarde M. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J.

However, subtle differences in the active sites allow the COX-2 isoform to use neutral ester and amide derivatives of 20:4 that are not utilized as effectively by COX-1 (11Kozak K.R. Rowlinson S.W.

Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland2004: 15-40Crossref Google Scholar). Although the structures and kinetics of the two COX isoforms are very similar, the enzymes differ considerably with regard to transcriptional regulation. Cells that contain COX-1 usually express the enzyme constitutively, whereas COX-2 expression is induced in response to a variety of inflammatory and proliferative stimuli, including cytokines, growth factors, and tumor promoters. As a consequence of these varied expression patterns, COX-1 is believed to be primarily responsible for “housekeeping” functions, such as gastric cytoprotection and regulation of platelet aggregation. In contrast, COX-2 is thought to be involved in the inflammatory response, pyresis, and in carcinogenesis (20Xie W. Chipman J.G. Robertson D.L. Erikson R.L. Simmons D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Toxicol. 1998; 38: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2566) Google Scholar). Consistent with these varying roles, two patterns of PG synthesis have been recognized. “Immediate” PG production occurs in response to stimuli that cause a rapid release of 20:4 from cellular phospholipid through strong activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). The release of 20:4 occurs quickly, and PG synthesis utilizes whichever of the two enzymes (COX-1 or COX-2) is already present in the cells. In most cases, PG formation is complete within 1–2 h. Alternatively, “delayed” PG production occurs in response to stimuli that result in transcription of the COX-2 gene. Under these circumstances, PG formation is usually not detectable until two or more hours after introduction of the stimulus and may continue for prolonged periods (up to 24 h or more, Refs. 26Fu J.-Y.

This has led to the suggestion that delayed PG synthesis results from the release of a restricted pool of 20:4 that is available only to COX-2. This may occur, in part, through selective coupling of COX isoforms to specific secretory PLA2 or through distinct subcellular localization (28Kudo I. Murakami M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 469: 29-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Morita I. Schindler M. Regier M.K. Otto J.C. Hori T. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol.

Others have suggested that the release of 20:4 during delayed PG synthesis is too slow to provide adequate oxidant to activate COX-1. Both enzyme isoforms require activation through a reaction with hydroperoxide. However, COX-1 has been shown to require higher concentrations of peroxide than COX-2 for activation in vitro (4Rouzer C.A. Marnett L.J. Chem.

Macrophages challenged with LPS also secrete a number of cytokines, among them tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Prior studies have demonstrated potential interrelationships between PG synthesis and TNF-α secretion in LPS-treated macrophages. In particular, PGE2 and prostacyclin have been shown to suppress TNF-α secretion in macrophages and/or peripheral blood monocytes responding to LPS (49Dieter P. Hempel U. Kamionka S. Kolada A.

However, if adequate quantities of PGE2 and/or prostacyclin are produced with appropriate timing, the potential exists for autocrine regulation of TNF-α secretion by endogenous PGs in macrophage populations. Here we report detailed studies of the LPS-mediated release of 20:4 and the synthesis of PGs by murine primary resident peritoneal macrophages (RPM). Our studies reveal that RPM release PGs much more rapidly and in greater quantities than can be explained entirely by COX-2-dependent synthesis. These cells constitutively express high quantities of the COX-1 isoform, and studies with selective isoform inhibitors and cells from mice harboring a targeted deletion of the ptgs-1 or ptgs-2 gene indicate that COX-1 contributes significantly to PG synthesis by RPM in response to LPS. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TNF-α secretion is suppressed in LPS-treated RPM by endogenous PGs primarily synthesized by COX-1. RPM Cultures—All studies involving animals were done with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Vanderbilt University. Female wild-type (WT) C3H/HeN and CD-1 mice (25–30 g) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories.

Female COX-1–/– and COX-2–/– mice on a CD-1 background (25–30 g) were bred in the Vanderbilt University animal care facility by the S. K. Dey laboratory as described (59Wang H. Ma W.G. Tejada L.

Mice were euthanized with carbon dioxide, and the peritoneal cavities were lavaged with a total of 3 ml of ice-cold calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Peritoneal cells were collected by centrifugation of lavage fluid and resuspended at a concentration of 2–3 × 106 cells/ml in α-minimal essential medium (α-MEM) supplemented with Gluta-Max (Invitrogen), containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Summit Biotechnologies) plus 100 units/ml penicillin and 0.10 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma) (α-MEM/FCS). The cell suspension was plated onto 35-mm tissue culture dishes at 2 ml per dish and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing the plates four times with PBS, and the cultures were then incubated overnight in 2 ml of fresh α-MEM/FCS. The mean protein content of RPM cultures was 100 ± 10 μg/dish (8.2 ± 0.8 × 105 cells/dish). LPS Treatment of Macrophage Cultures—Cultures of RPM were washed twice with PBS at 37 °C, and then overlaid with 1 ml of fresh, serum-free α-MEM. Following a 1-h incubation, an additional 1 ml of medium with or without LPS (200 ng/ml) (E. coli 011:B4, Calbiochem) was added. Cells were incubated for the desired time periods. For the determination of COX-1, COX-2, cPLA2, and microsomal PGE synthase-1 (mPGES-1) expression as well as PG synthesis and TNF-α secretion, the medium was collected from each culture, and the cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cell monolayers were scraped into 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, plus 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml AEBSF, and 5 μg/ml each of antipain, leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin (all components from Sigma)). Cell lysates were allowed to stand for 30 min on ice with occasional vortex mixing, and particulate material was then removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g. Samples of culture medium and cell lysates were stored at –80 °C until analyses could be completed. For the measurement of free 20:4, the medium was removed from the cell cultures and combined with 1 ml of ice-cold acetonitrile containing 100 ng of 20:4-d8 (Cayman). The cells were scraped twice into a total volume of 1 ml of ice-cold methanol, and the resulting cell lysate was added to the medium solution. In some experiments, the medium was collected and placed in one tube containing 1 ml of the internal standard solution, and then the cell lysate in 1 ml of methanol was placed into a separate tube containing 1 ml of the internal standard solution. This allowed separate determination of lipid levels in the medium versus cells. For the evaluation of the effects of selective COX inhibitors, cells were incubated in serum-free medium containing 100 nm COX-2 inhibitor, SC-236, and/or the COX-1 inhibitor, SC-560 (both from Calbiochem) for 1 h prior to LPS addition. Incubation with LPS was then carried out in the ongoing presence of the inhibitors. The inhibitors were added as 100 μm stock solutions in Me2SO, and the Me2SO concentration in all cultures was maintained at 0.1% for these experiments. In some experiments in which cells had been pretreated with SC560, PGE2 and or carbaprostacyclin (cPGI2) (both from Cayman) were added to the culture medium at the same time as LPS. These compounds were prepared as stock solutions in Me2SO prior to addition to cell cultures. The final Me2SO concentration in all cultures was maintained at 0.2% for these experiments. Immunoblotting for Protein Expression—The protein concentrations of 20-μl aliquots of macrophage cell lysates were determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's directions. Macrophage lysate samples containing 15 μg of protein were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using an 8% gel (12% for mPGES-1) overlaid with a 3% stacking gel. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore), which was then incubated with 5% milk protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.9% NaCl and 0.1% Tween-20 (TTBS). COX-2 protein was detected following incubation with a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against amino acids 570–598 of the murine enzyme (Cayman) diluted 1:30,000 in TTBS plus 0.1% milk protein. COX-1 protein was detected following incubation with a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against amino acids 274–299 of the murine enzyme (Cayman) diluted 1:1,000. cPLA2 protein was detected following incubation with a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against amino acids 1–216 from the human enzyme (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:500. mPGES-1 protein was detected following incubation with a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against amino acids 59–75 from the human enzyme (Cayman) diluted 1:1000. The secondary antibody for detection of all proteins was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) used at a 1:2,000 dilution in TTBS plus 0.1% milk protein. After the membranes were overlaid with ECL detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences), the chemiluminescence signal intensity was measured using a Fluor-S Max Multi-Imager (Bio-Rad). The membranes were also exposed to Hyperfilm ECL film (Amersham Biosciences) to obtain photographic images. Assay of PGs—PG levels in culture medium were determined by negative ion gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) of pentafluorobenzyl ester derivatives as previously described (60DuBois R.N. Awad J. Morrow J. Roberts L.J. Bishop P.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), or by selected reaction monitoring of the ammoniated ions by positive ion electrospray ionization liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) as described. 2P. J. Kingsley and L. J. Marnett, manuscript in preparation. Determination of Total 20:4 Levels—Samples were extracted with 12 ml of a solution of ethyl acetate/hexane (90:10), and the organic extracts were evaporated to dryness under a stream of argon. The dried organic extracts were reconstituted in 1 ml of hexane and each was applied to a dry silica solid phase extraction column (Sep Pak Vac, 100 mg, Waters). The columns were washed with 3 ml of hexane. The columns were then eluted with 4 ml of ethyl acetate/methanol/acetic acid (94.9: 5:0.1, v/v/v) the first milliliter of which was used to rinse the sample tubes. The eluates were evaporated to dryness, reconstituted in 100 μl of acetonitrile, and analyzed for 20:4 by silver ion coordination LC/MS/MS as described (61Kingsley P.J. Marnett L.J. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 314: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Assay for TNF-α—The concentration of TNF-α in cell culture medium was determined by using an OptEIA assay kit (BD PharMingen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Synthesis of PGs by RPM in Response to LPS—Murine RPM from C3H/HeN mice were incubated in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml of LPS for periods of up to 24 h, and the culture medium was analyzed for PGs by GC/MS. RPM secreted primarily prostacyclin (detected as its hydrolysis product, 6-keto-PGF1α) and PGE2 in response to LPS (along with minor amounts of TXA2, which was detected as its hydrolysis product, TXB2) (Fig. 1A). Increased levels of PGs were detectable at the earliest time point measured (1 h), but the most rapid rate of PG synthesis occurred from 1 to 6 h (Fig. 1B). It is notable that PGE2 was not the major product secreted by LPS-challenged RPM, but as shown in Fig. 1C, the relative proportion of PGE2 increased in RPM cultures during the course of the incubation. By 24 h, 6-keto-PGF1α reached levels of 3,300 ± 300 pmol/107 cells, and PGE2 reached levels of 2,100 ± 300 pmol/107 cells (Fig. 1A and Table I). In the absence of LPS, 6-keto-PGF1α and PGE2 levels remained constant at 70–120 pmol/107cells and 18–27 pmol/107 cells, respectively.Table IComparison of LPS-induced PG synthesis by RPM from mice of different genetic backgroundsCell sourceTotal prostaglandin0 h2 h6 h24 hpmol/107 cellsC3H/HeN83 ± 14780 ± 2103,700 ± 5005,600 ± 400{3.2 ± 0.6}aConcentration in culture medium (nm) in braces.{31 ± 10}{140 ± 30}{220 ± 25}[16 ± 2]bPercent PGE2 in brackets.[18 ± 2][31 ± 1][38 ± 5]CD-1160 ± 60320 ± 706,900 ± 1,400NDcND indicates not determined.{6.8 ± 3.1}{13 ± 4}{280 ± 40}[41 ± 13][40 ± 9][53 ± 9]C57BL/6140 ± 100130 ± 1202,900 ± 800ND{5.7 ± 4.4}{5.6 ± 5.1}{110 ± 30}[35 ± 9][43 ± 8][55 ± 6]a Concentration in culture medium (nm) in braces.b Percent PGE2 in brackets.c ND indicates not determined. Open table in a new tab Changes in 20:4 Levels in RPM during the LPS Response—In order to assess the availability of substrate for PG synthesis by LPS-challenged RPM, we measured total 20:4 levels (medium plus cells) in RPM cultures at varying times after addition of the stimulus. An elevation of free 20:4 was observed by 1–2 h after LPS addition with maximal values reaching 250–400 pmol/107 cells, (Fig. 1D and Table II). Levels returned to control values by 6 h. In the absence of LPS, free 20:4 remained constant at 90–140 pmol/107 cells in RPM cultures.Table IIComparison of 20:4 levels in LPS-treated RPM from mice of different strainsCell sourceArachidonic acid0 h2 hpmol/107 cellsC3H/HeN140 ± 40320 ± 90CD-1110 ± 20210 ± 20C57BL/680 ± 20110 ± 30 Open table in a new tab The data in Fig. 1D reflect total free 20:4 present in the combined medium and macrophage cell lysates. In separate experiments, RPM cultures were incubated for 0, 2, or 6 h in the presence of LPS, and cells plus the medium were analyzed separately for free 20:4 content. The results showed that ∼73–77% of the free 20:4 was localized to the cells regardless of the period of incubation with LPS. These results indicate that the maximum intracellular 20:4 content in RPM during LPS incubation reached values of 180–300 pmol/107 cells. Changes in PG Synthetic Enzyme Levels in LPS-challenged RPM—Prior evidence has indicated that PG synthesis by macrophages in response to LPS is due exclusively to COX-2, implying that it cannot occur prior to COX-2 induction. As noted in Fig. 1, A and B; however, a significant increase in net PG synthesis occurs in RPM within the first hour of incubation with LPS, before one would expect de novo COX-2 protein expression to have occurred. We therefore performed immunoblot analysis of RPM cell lysates to determine whether these cells constitutively express COX-2, and to ascertain the rate of appearance of new COX-2 protein. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, COX-2 levels were undetectable in RPM prior to LPS treatment and only a trace amount of the protein was observed after 1 h of incubation. Protein levels markedly increased between 2 and 6 h, and maximal levels were reached at 6–10 h. Thus the PG synthesis occurring in RPM cultures during the first hour of LPS incubation could not easily be attributable to constitutive COX-2 expression. PGE2 synthesis is dependent on three PGE synthase enzymes, one that is cytosolic (cPGES), and two that are microsomal (mPGES-1 and mPGES-2) (62Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Tanioka T. Kudo I.

It also reflects the rate of malonyl-CoA decarboxylation, i.e. the only known fate of malonyl-CoA in the heart. Conditions were selected to result in stable malonyl-CoA concentrations ranging from 1.5 to 5 nmol·g wet weight–1.

Our data show that, in the absence of enzyme inhibitors, the rate of acetyl-CoA carboxylation is the main determinant of the malonyl-CoA concentration in the heart. Malonyl-CoA is a key intermediate of fatty acid synthesis in lipogenic organs. It is also an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, a regulator of fatty acid oxidation in most tissues (1McGarry J.D. Mannaerts G.P. Foster D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1977; 60: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 2Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 3Chien D. Dean D. Saha A.K. Flatt J.P. Ruderman N.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E259-E265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of studies have documented the modulation by malonyl-CoA of fatty acid oxidation in the heart under physiological and pathological conditions, such as maturation (4Lopaschuk G.D. Witters L.A. Itoi T. Barr R. Barr A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25871-25878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), diabetes (5Ruderman N.B. Saha A.K. Vavvas D. Witters L.A. Am. J.

Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1099-1109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the heart, malonyl-CoA formed by cytosolic acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) 1The abbreviations used are: ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; MCD, malonyl-CoA decarboxylase. 1The abbreviations used are: ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; MCD, malonyl-CoA decarboxylase. is, as far as is known, disposed only via decarboxylation catalyzed by malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD). Thus, cytosolic acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA are the two components of a substrate cycle that regulates carnitine palmitoyltransferase I activity and the rate of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation in the heart. No information is available on the relationship between the concentration of malonyl-CoA and its turnover, i.e. with the flux of ACC in the intact heart. The rate of turnover of malonyl-CoA is likely to be regulated by the cytosolic acetyl-CoA concentration and by the activities of ACC and MCD. The concentrations of cytosolic acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA in the heart are much lower than the Km of the two enzymes for their respective substrates (6Goodwin G.W. Taegtmeyer H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E772-E777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Saddik M. Gamble J. Witters L.A. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25836-25845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is unlikely that the modulation of ACC and MCD activities exerts a tight control on malonyl-CoA turnover. It was previously shown that the myocardial content of malonyl-CoA is elevated when acetyl-CoA levels are increased by either activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (8Saddik M. Gamble J. Witters L.A. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25836-25845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Stanley W.C. Hernandez L.A. Spires D. Bringas J. Wallace S. McCormack J.G. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1996; 28: 905-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) or by perfusing the heart with octanoate instead of palmitate or oleate (10Longnus S.L. Wambolt R.B. Barr R.L.

Physiol. 2002; 283: H1379-H1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The increase in malonyl-CoA content was independent of ACC activity. It is not clear whether the higher concentration of malonyl-CoA in the presence of octanoate reflected (i) an increase in acetyl-CoA carboxylation fueled by an increase in cytosolic acetyl-CoA concentration or/and (ii) a decrease in the flux of malonyl-CoA decarboxylation. The goal of the present investigation was to test the hypothesis that myocardial malonyl-CoA concentration is proportional to the rate of acetyl-CoA carboxylation under physiological conditions. We recently developed a mass spectrometric technique for measuring the malonyl-CoA turnover in isolated organs, based on the time course of its labeling from NaH13CO3 (12Reszko A.E. Kasumov T. Comte B. Pierce B.A. David F. Bederman I.R. Deutsch J. Des Rosiers C. Brunengraber H. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The malonyl-CoA concentration can also be assayed in the same samples by isotope dilution using an internal standard of [U-13C3]malonyl-CoA. We used these techniques to study the relationship between malonyl-CoA concentration in rat hearts under physiological conditions and during pharmacological inhibition of MCD. In addition, we measured the malonyl-CoA concentration and turnover in the hearts of anesthetized pigs. Materials—Chemicals and biochemicals were obtained from Sigma. NaH13CO3 and [U-13C3]malonic acid were purchased from Isotec (Miamisburg, OH). A standard of [U-13C3]malonyl-CoA was prepared and purified by high performance liquid chromatography (12Reszko A.E. Kasumov T. Comte B. Pierce B.A. David F. Bederman I.R. Deutsch J. Des Rosiers C. Brunengraber H. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Two inhibitors of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, CBM-300864 and CBM-301940, were kindly provided by Chugai Pharma USA. Organ Perfusion Experiments—Hearts from Sprague-Dawley rats (180–220 g, fed, overnight-fasted, or 2-day fasted) were perfused in the Langendorf mode with non-recirculating bicarbonate buffer containing combinations of substrates (glucose, lactate, pyruvate, oleate, and/or octanoate), which would induce a wide range of malonyl-CoA concentrations (Table I). After 15 min of equilibration, the unlabeled bicarbonate in the perfusate was replaced by 40% enriched [13C]bicarbonate, and the hearts were quick-frozen after 0.5–30 min of tracer infusion. In some groups of experiments, other compounds (inhibitors of MCD, Me2SO) were added to the perfusate as indicated in Table I.Table IPerfusion conditions and malonyl-CoA content of isolated rat heartsGroupRat statusConcentrations of compounds added to the perfusate[Malonyl-CoA][Glucose][Lactate][Pyruvate][Oleate][Other compounds]mmmmmmmmnmol/g1Fed7.510.20.41 μm epinephrine1.45 ± 0.162Fed7.510.211.87 ± 0.1132DS41.22.16 ± 0.154Fed7.510.20.42.21 ± 0.145ONF510.20.32.34 ± 0.126ONF40.50.10.31% Me2SO; control for groups 9-112.35 ± 0.207Fed5.510.2No BSA3.03 ± 0.1482DS40.8 mm octanoate; no BSA5.07 ± 0.259ONF40.50.10.35 μm CBM-300864, 1% Me2SO3.91 ± 0.23ap < 0.01 compared with group 6.10ONF40.50.10.330 μm CBM-300864, 1% Me2SO5.60 ± 0.30ap < 0.01 compared with group 6.11ONF40.50.10.310 μm CBM-301940, 1% Me2SO5.01 ± 0.39ap < 0.01 compared with group 6.a p < 0.01 compared with group 6.

Comte B. Huang H. Kerwin T. Darvish A. Des Rosiers C. Brunengraber H. Stanley W.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2390-H2398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NaH13CO3 was infused into the bypass at a rate calculated to achieve a 15% enrichment of bicarbonate/CO2 in the infused myocardial territory. The enrichment of bicarbonate/CO2 was measured (12Reszko A.E. Kasumov T. Comte B. Pierce B.A. David F. Bederman I.R. Deutsch J. Des Rosiers C. Brunengraber H. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) in samples of venous blood from the infused territory just before taking punch biopsies of the myocardium at 1, 10, and 60 min (two pigs at each time point). Analytical Procedures—The concentration and 13C labeling of malonyl-CoA were assayed as described previously (12Reszko A.E. Kasumov T. Comte B. Pierce B.A. David F. Bederman I.R. Deutsch J. Des Rosiers C. Brunengraber H. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We developed a gas chromatography-mass spectrometric assay for acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity because in our hands the assay with NaH14CO3 had high blanks. Also, this assay measures non-acid-volatile radioactivity as the product and does not specifically identify malonyl-CoA. Our assay involves (i) incubating the tissue extract with acetyl-CoA and NaH13CO3, (ii) spiking the reaction mixture with an internal standard of [U-13C3]malonyl-CoA, (iii) hydrolyzing malonyl-CoA to malonate, and (iv) isotope ratio gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis of the di-tert-butyldimethylsilyl derivative of malonate. The assay is conducted with labeled NaH13CO3 to minimize the background resulting from traces of malonate in the tissue extract. We ran the assay on an 800-g supernatant of a tissue extract prepared by homogenizing 50 mg of powdered heart tissue in 0.15 ml of buffer containing 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m mannitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol (w/w), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a 1:1000 dilution of mammalian cell protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The 165-μl assay mixture contained 60 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml dialyzed fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Intergen), 2 mm mercaptoethanol, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 1.06 mm acetyl-CoA, and 0 or 10 mm citrate. After 2-min preincubation at 37 °C, the reaction was started by adding an amount of extract containing 25 μg of protein from the supernatant of the whole tissue extract. After 4 min of incubation, the reaction was stopped with 25 μl of 10% perchloric acid, and the sample was spiked with 2 nmol [U-13C3]malonyl-CoA. After centrifugation, the acid extract was brought to pH 12 with 2 m KOH and incubated at 40 °C for 1 h to hydrolyze the CoA esters. After centrifuging KClO4, the supernatant was brought to pH 1 with 1 m HCl and evaporated in a Savant vacuum centrifuge. The residue was treated to prepare di-tert-butyldimethylsilyl malonate, which was assayed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (12Reszko A.E. Kasumov T. Comte B. Pierce B.A. David F. Bederman I.R. Deutsch J. Des Rosiers C. Brunengraber H. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The amount of M1 malonyl-CoA formed was calculated from the M1/M3 mass isotopomer 2Mass isotopomers are designated as Mn, where n is the number of atomic mass units above the molecular weight of the unlabeled isotopomer M. ratio of malonate and the ACC activity expressed in nmol·min–1·(g wet weight)–1. The activity of MCD in heart tissue was assayed by the method of Kerner and Hoppel (14Kerner J. Hoppel C.L. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 306: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Since rapid changes in the Km of MCD have been reported in rat heart (6Goodwin G.W. Taegtmeyer H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E772-E777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we measured MCD activity at a low substrate concentration (0.01 mm malonyl-CoA; ∼5–10% of maximal activity) and under near Vmax conditions (0.3 mm malonyl-CoA). Calculations and Statistics—For each group of perfusions with NaH13CO3, the data of the 13C labeling of malonyl-CoA were fitted to an exponential regression, MPE=MPE(t=∞)[1−e−kt] eq.1 where MPE and MPE(t = ∞) are the molar percent enrichments of malonyl-CoA at any time and at infinite time, respectively. The kinetic constant of the pool, k (min–1), was multiplied by the average malonyl-CoA concentration of the group to yield the turnover of the pool (nmol·min–1·g–1). To test whether the MCD inhibitors significantly affected the kinetic constant of the malonyl-CoA pool, we performed a log rank test (15Daniel W.W. Biostatistics: A Foundation for Analysis in the Health Sciences. John Wiley & Sons, 1999: 633-635Google Scholar) (χ2 distribution with one degree of freedom), assuming that the labeling of malonyl-CoA is described by the above exponential. Adjustment for multiple comparisons was done by the Holm's procedure (16Holm S. Scand. J. Statistics. 1979; 6: 65-70Crossref Google Scholar). In eight groups of rat hearts perfused under the conditions listed in Table I and without inhibitors (groups 1–8), the malonyl-CoA concentrations ranged from 1.5 nmol·g–1 (hearts from fed rats perfused with 1 μm epinephrine) to 5 nmol·g–1 (hearts from 2-day starved rats perfused with 0.8 mm octanoate). Groups 1–8 are listed in Table I in the order of increasing malonyl-CoA concentrations measured in the tissue. Within each group of perfusions, the malonyl-CoA concentration remained stable with the duration of the experiment (coefficient of variation < 16%). The ACC and MCD activities measured in tissue extracts were not different among the groups, thus there was no correlation between malonyl-CoA concentration and enzyme activities (Table II).Table IIActivities of ACC and MCD in perfused rat heartsGroupACC activityMCD activity of [malonyl-CoA]0 mm citrate10 mm citrate0.01 mm0.3 mm1167 ± 5.5203 ± 5.488.1 ± 91,190 ± 702169 ± 9.5222 ± 1680.9 ± 41,280 ± 903123 ± 11176 ± 7.697.1 ± 91,500 ± 1704166 ± 5.2214 ± 9.495.2 ± 6.71,370 ± 1407152 ± 10219 ± 11107 ± 12.31,340 ± 1008164 ± 6.4232 ± 14116 ± 31.51,640 ± 120 Open table in a new tab After 15 min of equilibration, we replaced the unlabeled bicarbonate in the perfusate with 40% enriched NaH13CO3. Fig 1A shows the time course of malonyl-CoA labeling in three of the groups of heart perfusions (groups 1, 2, and 8). The data were fitted to an exponential regression to calculate the kinetic constant and half-life of the malonyl-CoA pool. In the absence of inhibitors (groups 1–8 of Table I), the half-lives of malonyl-CoA labeling ranged from 0.76 to 1.27 min (Fig. 1). The kinetic constant of each group was multiplied by the average malonyl-CoA concentration of the group to yield the turnover of malonyl-CoA in the group. Fig. 2 (solid symbols) shows the linear correlation between the concentration and turnover of malonyl-CoA in groups 1–8 of hearts perfused under various physiological conditions (slope = 0.98; r2 = 0.94).Fig. 2Correlation between the flux of acetyl-CoA carboxylation and malonyl-CoA concentration in perfused rat hearts. Each numbered symbol refers to one group of perfused hearts described in Table I. The linear regression was computed from the data of groups 1–8.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effect of two inhibitors of MCD, CBM-300864 and CBM-301940, was tested in hearts perfused with buffer containing 1% Me2SO. In the control group (group 6), 1% Me2SO did not affect the relationship between concentration and turnover of malonyl-CoA (Fig. 2). The two inhibitors increased the concentration of malonyl-CoA (Table I), and 30 μm CBM-300864 significantly decreased the turnover of malonyl-CoA (Fig. 1B and Fig. 2, open symbols). We measured the malonyl-CoA concentration and turnover in the hearts of six anesthetized pigs to get data from an animal species whose metabolic rate per kg is close to that of adult humans. The malonyl-CoA concentration was 1.3 ± 0.3 nmol/g wet weight, and its turnover was 0.15 nmol·min–1·g wet weight–1. Thus, in live pig hearts the malonyl-CoA concentration is comparable with that of the perfused rat heart, but the rate of turnover is about 70–80% lower. This study was conducted to gain insight on the dynamics of the malonyl-CoA pool which plays a major role in controlling fatty acid oxidation in the heart. To date, the regulation of malonyl-CoA metabolism in the heart has been studied (i) by defining the factors that modulate the activities of ACC and MCD and (ii) by correlating malonyl-CoA concentrations with activities of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I and with rates of fatty acid oxidation. Our study was aimed at correlating malonyl-CoA concentrations with rates of acetyl-CoA carboxylation calculated from the kinetics of labeling of malonyl-CoA from NaH13CO3 in intact hearts. The turnover of malonyl-CoA, assayed with NaH13CO3, is a measurement of the rate of acetyl-CoA carboxylation in the intact heart. Fig. 2 shows that the malonyl-CoA concentration in rat hearts perfused in the absence of inhibitors of MCD is directly proportional to the rate of acetyl-CoA carboxylation with a slope of 0.98 (groups 1–8). The activities of ACC and MCD exceeded the rate of malonyl-CoA turnover by 2 orders of magnitude and did not correlate with either concentration or turnover of malonyl-CoA. The only condition where the activity of MCD regulated malonyl-CoA kinetics was when the enzyme was pharmacologically inhibited, which caused an increased malonyl-CoA concentration and decreased turnover. Thus, under a wide range of physiological conditions, the rate of malonyl-CoA decarboxylation appears to adjust to the malonyl-CoA concentration. In the heart, the only known fate of malonyl-CoA is its decarboxylation to acetyl-CoA by MCD. Therefore when the malonyl-CoA concentration is stable (as was the case in our experiments), the isotopic turnover of malonyl-CoA represents not only the flux of acetyl-CoA carboxylation but also the flux of malonyl-CoA decarboxylation. It was recently demonstrated that MCD inhibition with CBM-300863 and CBM-301940 increases malonyl-CoA concentration (17Dyck J.R. Cheng J.F. Stanley W.C. Barr R. Chandler M.P. Brown S. Wallace D. Arrhenius T. Harmon C. Yang G. Nadzan A.M. Lopaschuk G.D. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: e78-e84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we demonstrated that the rise in malonyl-CoA with MCD inhibition was due to a decrease in malonyl-CoA turnover (Figs. 1 and 2, compare groups 9–11 with group 6, the Me2SO control). The data of groups 9–11 no longer followed the relationship between malonyl-CoA concentration and turnover of groups 1–8. The two inhibitors did not affect the activity of ACC assayed in rat heart extract (not shown). It appears that the inhibitors indirectly inhibited acetyl-CoA carboxylation by increasing product inhibition on ACC, presumably without affecting the cytosolic acetyl-CoA concentration. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that, in the absence of inhibitors, the rate of acetyl-CoA carboxylation varies with the mix of substrates offered to the heart but appears to be independent of the ACC and MCD activities measured under Vmax conditions. There is evidence that most of the tissue content of acetyl-CoA is mitochondrial. Therefore, the cytosolic concentration of acetyl-CoA must be in the low μm range. Since the Km of ACC for acetyl-CoA is much higher than the cytosolic concentration of acetyl-CoA, the latter must be a key short-term modulator of the ACC flux, as hypothesized previously (8Saddik M.

Using a subtraction method, we previously isolated 102 genes that are expressed in the early stage of adipocyte differentiation. One of these genes named fad158 (factor for adipocyte differentiation 158) seems to be a novel gene, since there is no significantly similar gene listed in databases. Both mouse and human fad158 encode 803 amino acids and contain 4 transmembrane regions and 8 leucine-rich repeat motifs. Expression of fad158 was induced at an early stage in differentiating 3T3-L1 cells and was observed in the skeletal muscle. When the expression was knocked down with an antisense method in 3T3-L1 cells, the accumulation of oil droplets was reduced. Moreover, on overexpression of fad158 in NIH-3T3 cells, which are fibroblasts and do not usually differentiate into adipocytes, stable transformants accumulated oil droplets and showed an elevated expression of adipocyte marker genes, indicating that these cells had differentiated into mature adipocytes. fad158 has the ability to regulate adipocyte differentiation positively, especially at an early stage.

Adipose tissue is a unique organ that plays a key role in energy homeostasis by regulating the balance between energy storage and release according to nutritional status (1Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 2001; 104: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1933) Google Scholar). It is now recognized that adipose tissue is a major secretory organ that secretes numerous kinds of cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-α, leptin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, adiponectin, and resistin. These factors are known to influence insulin sensitivity, food intake, arteriosclerosis, and several common diseases (2Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S.

A superfluous accumulation of adipose tissue leads to obesity. Obesity is an important risk factor for diseases like type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cardiac infarction (1Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 2001; 104: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1933) Google Scholar, 5Kahn B.B. Flier J.S. J. Clin.

The link between obesity and these common diseases is thought to come from a loss of secretion of cytokines from adipose tissue. Obesity is the result of an expansion of individual adipocytes and increase in the number of adipocytes. The generation of new adipocytes results from differentiation mediated by several transcription factors identified as master regulators for adipogenesis.

Diabetes. 1998; 47: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar, 8Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar). The ectopic expression of PPARγ stimulates adipogenesis in non-adipogenic fibroblast cells such as NIH-3T3 (9Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3112) Google Scholar). The CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family is also known to be master regulators of adipocyte differentiation. The ectopic expression of C/EBPα also enhanced the ability of non-adipogenic cells to terminally differentiate into adipocytes (10Freytag S.O. Paielli D.L. Gilbert J.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1654-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Before the expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα, the expression of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ is seen from the mid-phase of adipocyte differentiation. These two transcription factors in turn activate the expression of both PPARγ and C/EBPα (11Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37731-37734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar, 12Mandrup S. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5367-5370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), also named adipocyte determination and differentiation factor 1 (ADD1), is another factor that regulates adipogenesis (13Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). SREBP-1 directly stimulates the expression of PPARγ and regulates PPARγ activity by producing the endogenous ligand of PPARγ (14Kim J.B. Wright H.M. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4333-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Thus, the events in the mid and late phases of adipocyte differentiation are relatively well characterized. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the very beginning of adipogenesis remain unknown. We have previously clarified the initial step of adipocyte differentiation. Using mouse 3T3-L1 fibroblastic cells, a model of adipocyte differentiation, we have isolated the genes whose expression is induced in the early stage of the differentiation process. By the PCR-subtraction cloning method, we isolated 102 genes, including the genes for transcription factors and signaling proteins (15Imagawa M. Tsuchiya T. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Kitamura A. Nishizuka M. Tominaga K. Tsuchiya T. Nishihara T. Imagawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 17Nishizuka M. Tsuchiya T. Nishihara T. Imagawa M. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Interestingly, 46 of the genes isolated seem to be new, having no significant similarity with the genes listed in the GenBank™/EMBL/DDBJ databases. The fragments isolated by the PCR-subtraction method are only 300–500 bp long. Therefore, the first step in this pursuit is to isolate the full-length cDNA and identify the open reading frame (ORF) of the unknown genes. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel gene, fad158 (factor for adipocyte differentiation 158). This gene contains the transmembrane regions and leucine-rich repeat motifs. Its expression was elevated during the adipogenesis of mouse 3T3-L1 cells. When fad158 expression was knocked down, the ability of 3T3-L1 cells to differentiate declined. Moreover, cells with the ectopic expression of fad158 underwent adipocyte differentiation in the presence of a ligand of PPARγ. Taken together, these results strongly indicate that fad158 is closely related to adipocyte differentiation. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analyses—Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Northern blot analyses, 15 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing 2% formaldehyde and then transferred to a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). For Northern blot analysis of human tissues, a Multiple Tissue Northern (MTN™) blot containing ∼2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA per lane was purchased from Clontech (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Hybridizations were performed under stringent conditions in Express Hyb (BD Biosciences Clontech), according to the manufacturer's directions. Each probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a BcaBEST labeling kit (Takara Biomedicals, Kusatsu, Japan). The ORF region in each gene was used as a DNA probe, except that the 3′-untranslated region (bp 2163–2461; GenBank™ accession number, M62362) of C/EBPα was used for detection of C/EBPα mRNA in NIH-3T3 cells; use of the ORF region of C/EBPα as a probe resulted in nonspecific bands of high intensity with total RNA from NIH-3T3 cells but not from 3T3-L1 cells. Therefore, several regions were checked, and an appropriate probe was found for C/EBPα, which gave no nonspecific bands. Fractionation of Fat Cells—The fat cells were prepared as described previously (18Shimba S. Hayashi M. Ohno T. Tezuka M. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2003; 26: 1266-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In brief, epidermal fat pads were isolated from male C67Bl/6J mice aged 6 weeks, washed with sterile PBS, minced, and washed with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4). Then the minced tissue was digested with 1.5 mg/ml collagenase type II (Sigma-Aldrich) in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate containing 4% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 1 h on a shaking platform. The undigested tissue was removed with a 250-μm nylon mesh, and the digested fraction was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. The adipocytes were obtained from the most upper layer, washed with buffer, and centrifuged to remove other cells. The stromal vascular fraction was resuspended in the erythrocyte lysis buffer (150 mm NH4Cl, 25 mm NH4HCO3, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.7)), filtered through 28-μm nylon mesh, and then precipitated at 500 × g for 5 min. Cloning of Full-length cDNA of Mouse fad158 —Because fad158 cDNA was isolated as a small 390-bp fragment, the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) and 3′-RACE were used for cloning the full-length cDNA. 5′-RACE was performed using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (BD Biosciences Clontech) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Total RNA was prepared from 3T3-L1 cells 3 h after induction. mRNA was isolated from total RNA using oligotex-dT30 (Daiichi Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's directions. The first strand of cDNA was amplified with oligo-dT primer and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. The second strand was synthesized using a second-strand enzyme mixture containing RNase H, Escherichia coli DNA polymerase 1, and E. coli DNA ligase. The resultant double-stranded cDNA was ligated to a Marathon cDNA adaptor with T4 DNA ligase. The PCR for 5′-RACE was performed using the forward primer, AP-1 (5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′), and a fad158-specific reverse primer (5′-CGGAGAGAGCCCGTGTGGTCCAC-3′). The PCR for 3′-RACE was performed with the forward primer, AP-1 (5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′), and a fad158-specific reverse primer, 5′-GTGGACCCACACGGGCTCTCTCCG-3′. The fragments obtained from 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE were subcloned into the T-added EcoRV site of pBluescript KS+ and analyzed by DNA sequencing as described below. Cloning of Full-length cDNA of Human fad158 —The reverse transcription coupled-PCR (RT-PCR) was conducted with ReverTra Dash (TOYOBO Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was isolated from HeLa cells as described above. The first strand of cDNA was synthesized with a random primer and ReverTra Ace (TOYOBO). The 5′ region of the human cDNA of fad158 was amplified using KOD plus (TOYOBO) with a human fad158-specific forward primer, 5′-ACAAGCCATGAGCAGCGA-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-AGAGCTCTCTCTGCACCA-3′. In the same way the 3′ region of the human cDNA of fad158 was amplified with a human fad158-specific forward primer, 5′-GATACCAGCCACCATTGC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GACTGAAACACGCTTCTACC-3′. DNA Sequencing and Data Base Analyses—The sequence was determined with the automated sequencer DSQ 1000 (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan) and an ABI PRISM 310 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The human ortholog of fad158 was predicted using the human genome data base. Searches for the human ortholog in human genome databases were performed using BLAST programs accessed via the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) homepage. Cell Culture and Differentiation—Mouse 3T3-L1 (ATCC CL173) preadipocyte cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum. For the differentiation experiment, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 μg/ml insulin, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxantine (IBMX), and 1 μm dexamethasone (Dex) at 2 days post-confluence. Mouse NIH-3T3 (clone 5611, JCRB 0615) fibroblastic cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum. fad158-overexpressing NIH-3T3 cells were induced to differentiate by the same medium as the 3T3-L1 cells at 2 days post-confluence with or without addition of 0.5 μm BRL49653. HeLa cells were maintained in minimal essential medium containing 10% FBS. Subcellular Localization of FAD158 —The pEGFP-fad158 chimeric protein-expressing plasmid GFP-WT was constructed by subcloning the coding region (amino acids 1–803) into the 3′-end of pEGFP-C1 (BD Biosciences Clontech) in-frame. GFP-TM was constructed by subcloning the N-terminal transmembrane region (amino acids 1–404) into the 3′-end in-frame. GFP-LRR was constructed by subcloning the C-terminal leucine-rich repeat motifs (amino acids 406–803) into the 3′-end in-frame. The same regions were also subcloned into the 5′-end of pEGFP-N1 (BD Biosciences Clontech) and the 3′-end of pCMV-Myc (BD Biosciences Clontech) for generation of WT-GFP (full-length fad158-EGFP), TM-GFP (N-terminal transmembrane region-EGFP), LRR-GFP (C-terminal leucine-rich repeat-EGFP), Myc-WT (Myc-full-length fad158), Myc-TM (Myc-N-terminal transmembrane region), and Myc-LRR (Myc-C-terminal leucine-rich repeat), respectively. 3T3-L1 cells were plated onto cell disks (SUMITOMO BAKELITE Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) 1 day before transfection. The cells were transfected using FuGENE™ 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science), fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 mm MgCl2 for 20 min in room temperature. After the blocking of the aldehyde group with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 5 min at room temperature, each cell disk was incubated with primary antibody, rabbit polyclonal calnexin antibody (H-70) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA; 1:50 dilution in PBS), and mouse monoclonal c-Myc antibody (BD Biosciences Clontech; 1:100 dilution in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. After 5 washes with fresh PBS, the secondary antibody, anti-rabbit TRITC, and anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma-Aldrich) were reacted for 30 min at room temperature. After five more washes with fresh PBS, EGFP, TRITC, and fluorescein isothiocyanate, signals were detected by fluorescence microscopy. Establishment of Antisense fad158 mRNA-expressing Transformants—3T3-L1 cells that stably express the antisense mRNA of fad158 under the regulation of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) were established using the LacSwitch II inducible mammalian expression system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's directions. The fragment covering from -5 to +355 was amplified by PCR with primers containing XhoI and KpnI sites. After digestion with restricted enzymes, the fragment was subcloned into pOPRSVI/MCS in an antisense orientation. pOPRSVI containing antisense fad158 or empty pOPRSVI was co-transfected into 3T3-L1 cells with pCMVLac1, which expresses the lac repressor, using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). The stable transformants were selected with neomycin (G418) and hygromycin. Single drug-resistant colonies were isolated, stored individually, and used for the adipocyte differentiation analyses. Establishment of FAD158-expressing Transformants—NIH-3T3 cells that stably express fad158 were established using a Retro-X-system (BD Biosciences Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions, except that pDON-AI (Takara) was used as a retroviral vector. The full-length cDNA of fad158 was subcloned into the vector pDON-AI. pDON-AI fad158 or pDON-AI empty vector was introduced into PT67 using calcium phosphate co-precipitation techniques as described by Chen and Okayama (19Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). The virus transiently expressed in medium was collected and introduced into the target NIH-3T3 cells in the presence of Polybrene. Then the infected cells were cultured in medium that contained neomycin (G418). After 14 days of culture, cells that formed single colonies were isolated, stored individually, and used for the adipocyte differentiation analyses. Expression of fad158 during the Early Stage of Adipocyte Differentiation—We originally isolated fad158 as one of many unknown genes, the expression of which was elevated at 3 h after induction (15Imagawa M. Tsuchiya T. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of fad158 during adipocyte differentiation, we first determined the expression level of fad158 by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1). To monitor changes in fad158 expression levels during adipocyte differentiation, 3T3-L1 cells were stimulated with inducers, and total RNA was prepared at various points. Although the expression of fad158 was rarely detectable before induction (0 h), it was quickly elevated after induction, reached a maximum at 6 h, and decreased to 24 h. This result indicates that fad158 is transiently expressed in the early stage of adipocyte differentiation. To clarify the agents sufficient for the expression of fad158, the expression level of fad158 was determined when only one inducer (FBS, insulin, Dex, or IBMX) was added to the medium. The result showed that none of these agents induced the expression of fad158 except that a slight induction by FBS was observed. In contrast, when only one inducer was omitted from the medium, the expression level of fad158 was slightly decreased only in the condition without FBS. Therefore, it is likely that the expression of fad158 was mainly elevated by some factors in FBS not present in calf serum (data not shown). Expression Profiles of fad158 in Differentiating and Non-differentiating Cells—We next determined whether fad158 expression was restricted to cells in a state of differentiation or not. 3T3-L1 cells give rise to adipocytes when exposed to inducers 2 days after reaching a state of confluence, whereas proliferating 3T3-L1 cells do not differentiate even in the presence of inducers. Another mouse fibroblastic cell line, NIH-3T3, does not differentiate into adipocytes in either a postconfluent or proliferating state. These two cell lines were treated with inducers for 3 h while in a postconfluent (growth-arrested) or proliferating state. Northern blot analysis showed that remarkable induction only occurred in the growth-arrested 3T3-L1 cells. The expression of fad158 was also observed in the proliferating NIH-3T3 cells and even in the proliferating 3T3-L1 cells. However, expression of fad158 was rarely detectable in the growth-arrested 3T3-L1 cells without inducers, and it was strongly elevated 3 h after stimulation with inducers. Thus, the fold induction of fad158 by inducers is remarkably high in the growth-arrested 3T3-L1 cells, indicating that the elevation of the expression of fad158 was restricted to the growth-arrested state, the induction being the sole condition for differentiation into adipocytes, and also strongly suggesting that fad158 expression has some functional role in adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 2). Cloning of Full-length Mouse fad158 cDNA—The PCR-subtraction method used in the previous study gave cDNA fragments only 300–500 bp long, because the amplified fragments were digested by RsaI for non-bias cloning (15Imagawa M. Tsuchiya T. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Indeed, the length of fad158 was 390 bp. Therefore, we attempted to isolate a full-length cDNA of fad158 using 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE methods (Fig. 3). 5′-RACE was performed using cDNA prepared from 3T3-L1 cells 3 h after induction, and a 764-bp cDNA fragment containing a first methionine at 236 bp was isolated. A 2111-bp cDNA fragment containing a stop codon was isolated by 3′-RACE. By combining these two cDNA fragments, fad158 was found to consist of 2851 bp with an ORF of 803 amino acids (GenBank™ accession number AB081509). Because BLAST searches of databases identified no significant matches against proteins of known function, fad158 seemed to be a novel gene. Genomic Distribution of Mouse fad158 —The mouse genome data base was made public by The Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium (20Check E. Nature. 2002; 417: 106Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 21Consortium Mouse Genome Sequencing Nature. 2002; 420: 520-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (5384) Google Scholar). Using this data base, a BLAST search for mouse fad158 was performed. The result indicated that mouse fad158 existed at locus 5E5 of mouse chromosome 5 and consisted of four exons divided by three introns (Fig. 4A). Sequences of the exon/intron junctions in the data base revealed that the GT/AG rule was preserved in all cases. As with the mouse genome data base, we used the human genome data base to predict the full-length human fad158 ORF and to analyze the genomic distribution of human fad158 (22Consortium International Human Genome Sequencing Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (17689) Google Scholar). To isolate the full-length ORF of human fad158, we first predicted the ORF region of human fad158 based on the search result. By splicing out the introns and combining the exons, the ORF of human fad158 was predicted. To isolate human fad158 including the entire ORF, we constructed primer sets as indicated under “Experimental Procedures” and performed RT-PCR using a template prepared from total RNA extracted from HeLa cells. From sequence analyses of the resultant fragments, the human fad158 cDNA was concluded to be 2575 bp long, with a 2409-bp ORF encoding 803 amino acids (GenBank™ accession number AB081509). A BLAST search of the human genome data base revealed the existence of a human homologue of fad158 on chromosome 1 at locus 1P22 that consisted of three exons divided by two introns. Comparing the genomic structure of mouse and human fad158, it was found that almost 95% of both ORFs was included in the last exons. In both genomes, the first methionine exists in the exon in front of the last exon. The Deduced Protein Primary Structure of fad158 —The deduced 803-amino acid sequence of the mouse and human fad158 ORF included four transmembrane domains and eight leucine-rich repeat motifs at the C-terminal end. Interestingly, the positions of these two domains were well conserved in mouse and human fad158 (Fig. 4B). The leucine-rich repeat sequences of mouse fad158 are aligned in Fig. 4C. Comparing these sequences with the leucine-rich repeat consensus sequences, it was found that the consensus residues were well conserved. Thus, it is clear that these proteins contain leucine-rich repeat motifs. The same result was obtained by the multiple alignments of human fad158 leucine-rich repeat motifs (the nucleotide and amino acid sequences that are not presented here are available in GenBank™ under accession numbers AB081508 and AB081509). Expression of fad158 in Various Tissues—To determine the tissue distribution of human fad158 mRNA, we next performed Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 5A, two transcripts were obtained in most adult tissues. Whereas moderate levels of expression were observed in heart, lung, and peripheral blood leukocytes, a high level of expression was observed in skeletal muscle. The adipose tissue isolated from mouse was fractionated into a stromal vascular fraction and adipocytes. Then the expression of fad158 in both fractions was analyzed by Northern blotting. As shown in Fig. 5B, the expression of fad158 was very weak in both fractions. However, the expression in the stromal vascular cells was slightly stronger than that in the adipocytes, indicating that the expression of fad158 is dominant in the preadipocytes (Fig. 5B). Subcellular Localization of FAD158 —To further characterize fad158, the subcellular localization of FAD158 was determined by transient transfection of an EGFP-fad158 expression vector into 3T3-L1 cells. The signals were detected by fluorescence microscopy. The wild type FAD158 localized in the cytoplasm (GFP-WT in Fig. 6A). The truncated mutants, which only contain the four N-terminal transmembrane regions of FAD158, were also distributed in the cytoplasm (GFP-TM in Fig. 6A). Interestingly, another truncated mutant that does not contain the N-terminal transmembrane regions was distributed throughout the cell including the nucleus as detected in the control (GFP-LRR in Fig. 6A). Because these three GFP-fad158 chimeric constructs have GFP at the N-terminal site, we next constructed fad158-GFP chimeric plasmids in which GFP stays in the C terminus and also made plasmids having a smaller Myc tag. As shown in Fig. 6, B and C, the same distribution pattern of GFP or Myc was obtained as that of GFP at the N-terminal site. Because the subcellular distribution of truncated mutants containing the four N-terminal transmembrane regions of FAD158 was unchanged compared that of the wild type, it seems that FAD158 distributes to the membrane structure in the cytoplasmic region. Therefore, we next conducted immunofluorescent staining using antibody against calnexin, which is a marker of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (23David V. Hochstenbach F. Rajagopalan S. Brenner M.B. J.

The distribution of wild type FAD158 (WT-GFP) and the truncated mutant containing the four transmembrane regions (TM-GFP) overlapped with the staining pattern of calnexin. In contrast, the truncated mutant without the four transmembrane regions (LRR-GFP) did not co-localize with calnexin (Fig. 6B). When myc was used as a smaller tag, the same result was obtained (Fig. 6C). These results indicated that FAD158 is anchored to the ER through its four N-terminal transmembrane regions. Antisense Experiment on fad158 in 3T3-L1 Cells—We next examined the effect of fad158 during adipocyte differentiation. We attempted an antisense experiment to knock down the expression of fad158 during the adipocyte differentiation of mouse 3T3-L1 cells. For this purpose, a lac switch mammalian expression system was used. By co-transfecting pOPRSV1-fad158 antisense and pCMVLac1 into 3T3-L1 cells and then"

Methyltransferase reactions do not involve a redox step. To understand the structural and functional roles of the cluster in RumA, we have characterized redox reactions of the iron-sulfur cluster. As isolated aerobically, RumA exhibits a visible absorbance maximum at 390 nm and is EPR silent. It cannot be reduced by anaerobic additions of dithionite. Photoreduction by deazariboflavin/EDTA gives EPR spectra, the quantity (56% of S = 1/2 species) and details (gav ∼ 1.96–1.93) of which indicate a [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster in the reduced RumA. Oxidation of RumA by ferricyanide leads to loss of the 390-nm band and appearance of lower intensity bands at 444 and 520 nm. EPR spectra of ferricyanide-oxidized RumA show a fraction (<8%) of the FeS cluster trapped in the [3Fe-4S]1+ form (gav ∼ 2.011) together with unusual radical-like spectrum (g′ values 2.015, 2.00, and 1.95). RumA also reacts with nitric oxide to give EPR spectra characteristic of the protein-bound iron dinitrosyl species. Oxidation of the cluster leads to its decomposition and that could be a mechanism for regulating the activity of RumA under conditions of oxidative stress in the cell. Sequence data base searches revealed that RumA homologs are widespread in various kingdoms of life and contain a conserved and unique iron-sulfur cluster binding motif, CX5CGGC.

RumA, an S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methyltransferase specifically catalyzes the methylation of U1939 of 23 S ribosomal RNA to yield 5-methyluridine (m5U) 1The abbreviations used are: m5U, 5-methyluridine; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; NO, nitric oxide; FeS, iron-sulfur; HiPiP, high potential iron-sulfur protein; g′ value, proportional to (EPR frequency/resonance magnetic field); mT, milliTesla (10 mT = 1 gauss); K3Fe(CN)6, ferricyanide; FdI, ferredoxin I. 1The abbreviations used are: m5U, 5-methyluridine; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; NO, nitric oxide; FeS, iron-sulfur; HiPiP, high potential iron-sulfur protein; g′ value, proportional to (EPR frequency/resonance magnetic field); mT, milliTesla (10 mT = 1 gauss); K3Fe(CN)6, ferricyanide; FdI, ferredoxin I. or ribothymidine (1Agarwalla S. Kealey J.T. Santi D.V. Stroud R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8835-8840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This enzyme was found to contain a [4Fe-4S] cluster, a prosthetic group usually not associated with methyltransferase enzymes. The x-ray structure of RumA revealed that the cluster is located in the RNA binding domain of the three-domain protein (2Lee T.T. Agarwalla S. Stroud R.M. Structure (Lond.). 2004; 12: 397-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is held by four Cys-iron bonds provided by Cys81, Cys87, Cys90, and Cys162 and is buried in a largely hydrophobic region, but one of its sulfur atoms is quite exposed to solvent. The closest distance between the cluster and the sulfur of the catalytic nucleophile, Cys389,is ∼19 Å. RumA is a member of a growing list of nucleic acid modifying enzymes where the function of the iron-sulfur (FeS) cluster remains enigmatic. The reaction mechanism of m5U methyltransferases is similar to that of thymidylate synthase, and has been studied mainly employing the tRNA m5U54 methyltransferase, TrmA (3Ivanetich K.M. Santi D.V. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1992; 42: 127-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 4Gu X. Santi D.V.

It involves Michael addition of the catalytic Cys to carbon 6 (C-6) of pyrimidine, which activates C-5 for a nucleophilic attack on the methyl group of S-adenosyl-l-methionine. Following the methyl transfer, the enzyme is resolved by abstraction of a proton from C-5 and β-elimination. TrmA, as well as DNA and RNA 5-methylcytidine methyltransferases, which employ a similar catalytic mechanism (6Wu J.C. Santi D.V. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1985; 198: 119-129PubMed Google Scholar), do not posses an FeS cluster or any other prosthetic group. Lack of a redox step in the catalytic mechanism, and absence of the cluster in enzymes that employ a similar mechanism preclude a direct role for [4Fe-4S] cluster in the RumA-catalyzed reaction. Two features distinguish the FeS cluster in RumA from the clusters in a different class of S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent enzymes that proceed by free radical mechanisms. The RumA cluster is ligated by 4 cysteines and the iron-binding sequence motif is CX5CX2CXnC. In contrast, the radical S-adenosyl-l-methionine enzymes, of which MiaB (7Pierrel F. Hernandez H.L.

Jarrett J.T. Drennan C.L. Science. 2004; 303: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) are examples, have a [4Fe-4S] cluster built of a CX3CX2C sequence that leaves one iron of the cluster free to participate in catalysis. MiaB is a member of a family of enzymes catalyzing addition of sulfur to tRNA bases (9Jager G. Leipuviene R. Pollard M.G. Qian Q. Bjork G.R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 750-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The FeS sequence motifs in the DNA repair enzymes, endonuclease III (10Kuo C.F. McRee D.E. Fisher C.L. O'Handley S.F. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. Science. 1992; 258: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and MutY (11Lu A.L. Wright P.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3742-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), are CX6CX2CX5C, somewhat similar to the RumA sequence. Although the FeS clusters in these enzymes are usually regarded as structural, recently it was shown that the redox potential of MutY is altered by DNA binding and that a change in charge of the [4Fe-4S]3+/2+ cluster might alter its affinity for DNA (12Boon E.M.

The redox potentials of [4Fe-4S] clusters vary widely (13Beinert H. Kennedy M.C. Stout C.D. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2335-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 14Beinert H. Holm R.H. Munck E.

Of particular interest in many contemporary studies of FeS proteins is understanding the factors that influence the potentials, and thus functions, of these clusters (17Glaser T. Bertini I.

Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Proteins with four Cys-iron bonds to the [4Fe-4S] cluster fall into two general redox groups, ones with an accessible 2+/1+ couple, exemplified by some ferredoxins (19Chen K. Jung Y.S. Bonagura C.A. Tilley G.J. Prasad G.S. Sridhar V. Armstrong F.A. Stout C.D. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5603-5610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and ones, generally called HiPiPs, in which the 2+ form can be oxidized to a stable 3+ form. The potential of the 2+/1+ couple is variable among known [4Fe-4S] clusters. Clusters with very low reduction potentials (∼ –600 mV) (20Blankenhorn G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 67: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) may be photoreduced by deazariboflavin in the presence of EDTA, a hydrogen atom donor (21Massey V. Hemmerich P. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 22Knappe W.R. Hemmerich P. Duchstein H.J. Fenner H. Massey V.

Biophys. 1991; 287: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The 2+ HiPiPs are readily oxidized by ferricyanide (24Dunham W.R. Hagen W.R. Fee J.A. Sands R.H. Dunbar J.B. Humblet C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1079: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The FeS cluster in family 4 uracil-DNA glycosylases was recently shown to have redox properties of HiPiPs (25Hinks J.A. Evans M.C. De Miguel Y. Sartori A.A. Jiricny J. Pearl L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16936-16940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast, some [4Fe-4S] proteins rearrange when they are oxidized. Aconitase, with only three Cys-iron bonds in the intact [4Fe-4S] cluster, is the best studied example of these (13Beinert H. Kennedy M.C. Stout C.D. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2335-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). It loses iron to form a cuboidal [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster. Simple one-electron oxidative loss of one iron is precluded in 4Fe-4S proteins with four Cys-iron bonds and the clusters may completely decompose after treatment with excess oxidant. Oxidative decomposition of 4-Cys-4Fe-4S clusters has been observed in some cases, for instance, in Azotobacter vinlandii ferredoxin I (FdI) and in endonuclease III (26Morgan T.V. Stephens P.J. Devlin F. Burgess B.K. Stout C.D. FEBS Lett. 1985; 183: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 27Cunningham R.P. Asahara H. Bank J.F. Scholes C.P. Salerno J.C. Surerus K. Munck E. McCracken J. Peisach J. Emptage M.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4450-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The initial steps in 4-Cys-4Fe-4S cluster decomposition of A. vinlandii FdI have been examined by oxidizing the crystalline protein. X-ray analysis showed that unique iron and inorganic sulfur atoms were separating from the cluster after reaction with three oxidizing equivalents (28Sridhar V. Prasad G.S. Burgess B.K. Stout C.D. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 140-149Google Scholar). The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra resulting from oxidation of the A. vinlandii FdI 4Fe-4S cluster have characteristics of a sulfur-based radical and have been attributed to a cysteinyl disulfide radical (29Morgan T.V.

Munck E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14475-14485Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In A. vinlandii FdI, formation of this radical involves a Cys residue (Cys24) that is not initially a cluster iron ligand (31Shen B. Jollie D.R. Diller T.C. Stout C.D. Stephens P.J. Burgess B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10064-10068Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The spectroscopic signatures of FeS clusters are well documented for numerous proteins and model compounds of determined structures (13Beinert H. Kennedy M.C. Stout C.D. Chem.

Paramagnetic species resulting from redox reactions of [4Fe-4S] clusters give characteristic EPR spectra, summarized by average g′ values, gav, and anisotropy, Δg (16Bentrop D. Capozzi F. Luchinat C. Bertini I. Sigel A. Sigel H. Handbook on Metalloproteins. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York2001: 357-460Google Scholar). Representative values of gav and (Δg) of [4Fe-4S]1+ are ∼1.95 (∼0.1), of [4Fe-4S]3+ are ∼2.06 (∼0.1), and of [3Fe-4S]1+ are ∼2.01 (∼0.02). The EPR silent clusters derived from 4-iron clusters are those with even numbers of unpaired electrons. The cysteinyl disulfide radical studied in oxidized A. vinlandii FdI has EPR spectra in the gav ∼ 2.01 range, but these differ in temperature dependence from spectra of the paramagnetic FeS cluster forms. The [3Fe-4S]1+ clusters have EPR signals of maximum intensity between 10 and 12 K, and can scarcely be observed at 40 K, because of thermal population of low-lying excited states. In contrast, sulfur-based radical signals typically have maximum intensity around 30–60 K (29Morgan T.V. Stephens P.J. Devlin F. Stout C.D. Melis K.A. Burgess B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To determine possible functional roles of the FeS cluster in RumA, we examined the redox reactions of the cluster by both optical and EPR spectroscopy. We have also performed sequence analysis on the genomic data bases and have identified the putative FeS cluster binding sequences and consensus motifs in RumA homologs in genomes of various organisms. Materials—5-Deazariboflavin was a gift from Gordon Tollin (Tucson, AZ). The nitric oxide (NO) donor, PAPA NONOate ((Z)-1-[N-(3-aminopropyl)-N-(n-propyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate), was from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). It dissociates with a half-life of 1.3 h at pH 7.4 (Cayman Chemical) to form two nitric oxide molecules. Solid calcium oxide (98%) with a minor manganous impurity for calibration of g′ values was from Aldrich (catalog number 24,856-8). It was sealed in an evacuated small quartz capillary. Isolation and Purification of Native RumA—The expression and aerobic purification of RumA were reported earlier (1Agarwalla S. Kealey J.T. Santi D.V. Stroud R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8835-8840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using an extinction coefficient, ϵ280 = 64600 m–1 cm–1, obtained by quantitative amino acid analysis. Iron content in RumA was estimated by inductively coupled plasma resonance spectroscopy (Garatt-Callahan Co., Millbrae, CA) that yielded 4.6 mol of iron/mol of protein. Inorganic sulfur was estimated by the method of Beinert (36Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and a value of 3.6 mol of sulfur/mol of protein was obtained. The protein samples (0.1–0.4 mm) for both EPR and optical spectroscopy were in buffer (pH 7.0) composed of 50 mm potassium phosphate, 0.1 m potassium chloride, and 10% (v/v) glycerol (buffer A). UV-visible Spectroscopy—15 μm RumA solution was prepared in buffer A that was purged with argon. K3Fe(CN)6 solution was freshly prepared in the same buffer. Protein sample was successively titrated with the oxidant, and spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2401PC spectrophotometer. Spectra of K3Fe(CN)6 solutions were subtracted from that of the titrated protein. Preparation of EPR Samples—For photoreduction, oxidized 5-deazariboflavin (56 μm) was dissolved in buffer A plus 0.5 mm EDTA and diluted 10-fold into RumA solutions. Anaerobic samples for photoreduction were prepared by slow equilibration (1 h, 4 °C) of RumA and deazaflavin in an evacuated chamber (Wilmad, Buena NJ; tip-off manifold number 552-5) attached to an EPR tube. After several pump/equilibration cycles, the anaerobic sample was transferred to the EPR tube. The EPR tube was placed in a room temperature water bath and photoreduction was initiated by the white light of a 300 W projector bulb. For oxidation of RumA, potassium ferricyanide solutions were freshly prepared in buffer A at 10–100 times the protein concentration. The ferricyanide solution was placed in the EPR tube first and RumA was added to it. The sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen at the first sign of bleaching of the yellow/brown color of RumA. Oxidations were examined under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The highest yield of EPR signal of the oxidized protein was obtained when 0.1 mm RumA and 130 units of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (bovine kidney superoxide dismutase, Sigma S-2139)) were added anaerobically to a 10-fold excess of potassium ferricyanide. Solutions of PAPA NONOate ((Z)-1-[N-(3-aminopropyl)-N-(n-propyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate) (0.1 m) were prepared in 8 mm potassium hydroxide, diluted 10-fold into 0.1 m phosphate (pH 7.4) 1–2 h before a further 10-fold dilution into RumA, resulting in ∼2 mm NO in the EPR samples. These reactions were carried out in aerobic buffers. EPR Spectroscopy—X-band EPR spectra were recorded on a Varian E 109 spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR9/10 pumped, liquid helium-flow cryostat. Figure legends contain relevant instrumental parameters. The sample buffer was used to record baselines under conditions identical to those with which the sample spectra were obtained. These baselines were subtracted from RumA spectra shown in the figures. X-band frequencies were measured at the bridge. Values of the g factor at the sample were calibrated using a sealed quartz tube (0.5 mm inner diameter) of CaO containing a manganous impurity, frozen in a 4-mm X-band quartz EPR tube of sample buffer. Spin concentrations in RumA samples were determined by double integration of the EPR signal over a range of 2 kgauss and comparison with double integrals of signals of 0.1 mm cupric acetate in sample buffer. The microwave power was 0.1 mW for accurate spin determination, and the temperature was 40 K. The reported g′ values (Table I) of RumA EPR spectra were assigned by computer simulation. Simulations were performed using the XSophe program (37Wang D. Hansen G.R. J. Magn. Res. A. 1995; 117: 1-8Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar) (available from Bruker BioSpin). Simple simulations were used, considering only a spin of 1/2 with g factor and line width anisotropy. Simulation line shapes were gaussian. For the simulations, usually the magnetic field range was partitioned into 1.0 mT segments and the spatial grid, the Sydney OPera House grid (38Griffin M. Mays A. Noble C. Wang D. Eldershaw C. Gates K.E. Burrage K. Hanson G.R. Mol. Phys. Rep. 1999; 26: 60-84Google Scholar), into θ increments of ∼3°.Table IParameters for simulation of RumA EPR spectraFigureaThe first column refers to the figure in which the simulation appears.

In cases where the completed genome from more than one bacterial species or strain of the same genus were available, only one member of each genus was arbitrarily selected for analyses. Eschericha coli RumA, RumB, and TrmA sequences were used as probes. Optical Survey of Redox Properties of RumA—The optical spectrum of native RumA contains an absorption band with a maximum at 390 nm, a shoulder around 325 nm, and a minimum at 350 nm, besides the usual 280-nm band because of the aromatic residues (Fig. 1). Successive titration of 15 μm RumA with ferricyanide resulted in the loss of the 325- and 390-nm bands. By 180 μm ferricyanide, intensities of these bands were significantly reduced and new bands at 444 nm and at about 520 nm (very weak) emerged. Further addition of the oxidant or longer incubation caused precipitation of the protein. Anaerobic addition of sodium dithionite or Ti(III) citrate did not alter the absorption spectrum of the native RumA. EPR Study of Reduction of RumA FeS Cluster—Native RumA has >99% of the FeS cluster in a state that has essentially no EPR spectrum (see below, discussion of Fig. 3). Initial attempts to reduce RumA by anaerobic addition of dithionite gave no observed change in the EPR spectra, so a stronger reductant, 5-deazariboflavin semiquinone radical (21Massey V.

Brief irradiation (30 s) of RumA (0.1 mm), deazaflavin (5.6 μm), and EDTA (50 μm), followed by freezing, leads to an EPR spectrum of one electron-reduced RumA (Fig. 2). Based on comparison with the double integrals of the spectrum of a Cu2+ standard and of the RumA spectrum, the signal in Fig. 2 is estimated to represent 56% of the protein concentration. The shape of the reduced RumA EPR spectrum does not change between 10 and 30 K and is most intense at 10–12 K. Below ∼10 K, the signal broadens, and much above 30 K it is undetectable. At 12 K, the signal intensity does not begin to saturate until >4 mW. In the temperature range examined, there is no evidence of selective saturation of any portion of the reduced RumA EPR spectrum. The observed EPR signal is reasonably simulated as the sum of two equally weighted components (see Table I) of gx, gy, and gz values 2.005, 1.95, 1.92 and 2.01, 1.92, 1.85. This simulation is shown as an inset in Fig. 2. A continuum of g′ values between these extremes would also provide a good fit.Fig. 2Experimental EPR spectrum (9.26 GHz) of photoreduced RumA. Deoxygenated RumA (0.1 mm), 5-deazariboflavin (0.0056 mm), and EDTA (0.05 mm) were irradiated briefly at room temperature and then frozen for EPR. The inset shows how two separate line shapes, both with parameters (Table I) characteristic of a [4Fe4S]1+ center, might combine to give the observed line shape. The experimental EPR spectrum was recorded at 12 K and the instrument parameters were: microwave power, 10 mW; modulation amplitude, 1.6 mT; sweep rate, 12.5 mT/min; time constant, 0.5 s.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) EPR Study of Oxidative Rearrangement of RumA FeS Cluster—The usual procedure adopted for EPR studies of RumA upon treatment with ferricyanide was to use two or fewer equivalents of the reagent and to freeze the sample when cloudiness first appeared (after about 1–2 min) because the addition of this reagent causes precipitation of the protein. RumA is slightly more stable to nitric oxide additions and samples treated with this reagent were frozen when cloudiness first appeared. For example, 0.1 mm RumA mixed with 2 mm NO, aerobically and at 4 °C, is stable for about 20 min. RumA, isolated aerobically and before oxidation, exhibits variable amounts of a weak EPR signal (Fig. 3A). The low-field maximum occurs at a g′ value of 2.0278. In wider field sweeps, variable levels of g = 4.3 signal, characteristic of free ferric iron, are observed in different sample preparations (not shown). Addition of one-tenth oxidizing equivalent of ferricyanide per protein slightly enhances the intensity of the spectrum shown in Fig. 3A, whereas addition, at once, of 1 eq gives a much larger EPR spectrum of somewhat altered shape (Fig. 3B). Spectra of the same sample are compared at 12 and 40 K in Fig. 3, B and C, respectively. At 12 K, the maximum at g = 2.024 is the most intense peak and is slightly shifted in the g′ value from the low-field maximum of 2.028 seen in Fig. 3A. At 40 K the maximum is at g = 2.016 (see vertical lines in Fig. 3). The EPR signal in Fig. 3C falls to half the extrapolated linear intensity versus (microwave power)1/2 (P1/2) at ∼13 mW of microwave power. There is little change above 40 K in the shape of the EPR signal from that of Fig. 3C. All of the spectral features are broadened at temperatures 8 K and below. Double integration and comparison with a copper standard indicates that the fraction of EPR detectable spin 1/2 species at 40 K (Fig. 3C) is 4–8% of the initial protein concentration. The higher yield is obtained when the oxidation is carried out anaerobically. Because thermal population of excited states and relaxation both influence the intensity of the signal in Fig. 3A, assignment of the fraction of the protein concentration giving rise to the EPR-detectable species in Fig. 3A as <1% is simply based on comparisons of the double integrals of spectra in Fig. 3, A–C, together with the simulation discussed below. Fig. 4 provides simulations of the spectra in Fig. 3, A and C, based on g′ values given in Table I. The summation shows that 12 K EPR spectra of oxidized RumA samples may be as simple as the sum of 2 components. However, a broader magnetic field scan of the sample giving the experimental spectrum in Fig. 3C shows some absorbance above baseline at ∼g′= 2.12 (Fig. 5A). A line shape model and more rhombic set of g′ values than the ones used in calculating Fig. 4C were not found to give an adequate simulation of the g′ = 2.13 feature. However, it is possible that there is some absorbance associated with the 40 K EPR of oxidized RumA that is so broad, or canceled by underlying spectra, that a double integral of the experimental spectrum (Fig. 5A) underestimates the spin concentration. If so, the number of spins as given in the spectra in Fig. 3C, or Fig. 5A, could be significantly greater than 8%.Fig. 5An EPR spectrum of oxidized RumA compared with the dinitrosyl RumA derivative.A, the oxidized RumA spectrum (40 K) is the same as that shown in Fig. 3C, but here a low-field region with possible additional absorption is also shown. The arrow indicates minor absorption at ∼g′ value = 2.13. B, nitric oxide (from 1 mm nitric oxide donor) was added to deoxygenated RumA (0.17 mm) and the EPR spectrum was recorded (15 K). The fraction of the FeS cluster in the iron-dinitrosyl state, based on double integration, was 33%. Instrument parameters for A are given in the legend to Fig. 3C. For B, the parameters were: microwave frequency, 9.26 GHz; microwave power, 0.1 mW; modulation amplitude, 0.5 mT; sweep rate, 1.3 mT/min; time constant, 0.5 s.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Other Reactions of RumA—The reaction of RumA with nitric oxide has also been examined. The EPR spectrum shown in Fig. 5B is obtained with a molar ratio of nitric oxide to protein of 12:1. Based on integration, the Fig. 5B signal intensity corresponds to 33% of the concentration of the protein converted to an S = 1/2 iron dinitrosyl species by the time the reaction is quenched by freezing. Preliminary measurements of the potential of the cluster are consistent with the EPR observations on oxidation and reduction of RumA. Square wave voltametry measurements done under anaerobic conditions, on gold electrode, yielded two peaks at –430 and +42 mV (versus standard hydrogen electrode). The peak at the lower potential could be because of the cluster reduction but could also be consistent with reduction of a S(Cys)-gold bond. However, precipitation of protein during these measurements precluded reliable measurements. 2Prof. Marco Sola, personal communication.

The mitochondrial steroid hydroxylase CYP11A1 1The abbreviations used are: CYP11A1, cytochrome P450scc (side-chain cleavage enzyme from bovine adrenals); AdR, recombinant adrenodoxin reductase wild type; Adx, recombinant adrenodoxin wild type; FAD, flavine adenine dinucleotide; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; kapp, apparent rate constant. 1The abbreviations used are: CYP11A1, cytochrome P450scc (side-chain cleavage enzyme from bovine adrenals); AdR, recombinant adrenodoxin reductase wild type; Adx, recombinant adrenodoxin wild type; FAD, flavine adenine dinucleotide; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; kapp, apparent rate constant. belongs to the superfamily of cytochrome P450 enzymes. It catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the biogenesis of steroid hormones in adrenal mitochondria (1Bernhardt R. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

In this reaction, the side chain of the substrate cholesterol gets cleaved off to yield pregnenolone and isocaproic aldehyde at the expense of three molecules of NADPH and three molecules of oxygen (3Shikita M. Hall P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1441-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The reduction equivalents, provided by NADPH, are transferred to a FAD containing adrenodoxin reductase (AdR), which transfers electrons to the one electron carrier adrenodoxin (Adx), the ferredoxin of the adrenal gland (4Grinberg A.V. Hannemann F. Schiffler B. Muller J. Heinemann U. Bernhardt R. Proteins. 2000; 40: 590-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The [2Fe-2S] cluster-containing Adx subsequently transfers electrons, one at a time, to the heme iron of CYP11A1. These electrons are necessary for the reductive activation of oxygen and finally to hydroxylate the substrate. For a complete conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, six electrons have to be supplied. About 40 years ago the group of Kimura (5Kimura T. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

During the last decade much work has been done to get a better understanding of the kinetics of this system (4Grinberg A.V. Hannemann F. Schiffler B. Muller J. Heinemann U. Bernhardt R.

Nevertheless, the nature of the rate-limiting step in this system is still a matter of controversial discussion and remains to be elucidated. For the first time we were able to follow the reduction of all three protein components of the CYP11A1 system within one measurement using rapid mixing techniques. We determined the apparent rate constants (kapp) for the reduction of AdR by NADPH, of Adx by reduced AdR, and of CYP11A1 from one measurement. In addition, variation of the ionic strength revealed a clear difference in the redox behavior of Adx toward its redox partners. Because the interaction of Adx with its redox partners is mainly of electrostatic nature, it is of great interest to investigate the salt dependence of these reactions. In combination with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies and substrate conversion experiments we were able to sketch a detailed picture of the kinetics of this system. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—The protease-deficient Escherichia coli strain BL21DE3 was used as host strain for the heterologous expression of AdR and Adx. The Adx cDNA was a generous gift of Dr. Waterman, Nashville. The Adx cDNA-containing plasmid was pKKHC (24Porter T.D. Larson J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The plasmid containing the coding sequence for AdR was kindly provided by Dr. Y. Sagara (25Sagara Y. Takata Y. Miyata T. Hara T. Horiuchi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 102: 1333-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification—Bacteria were grown as previously reported (26Uhlmann H. Beckert V. Schwarz D. Bernhardt R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 1131-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, we used freshly transformed E. coli BL21DE3 to inoculate a preculture. The bacteria were allowed to grow in ampicillin-containing nutrient broth medium at 37 °C overnight. These cultures were used to inoculate 4 liters of a main culture containing ampicillin. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to induce heterologous protein production, and afterward cultures were grown at 37 °C for 16 h. Recombinant Adx was purified after sonification as described, and the final concentration of Adx was determined using ϵ414 = 9.8 mm–1 cm–1 (27Huang J.J. Kimura T. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The purity of the Adx preparation was estimated by determining the relative absorbance of the protein at 414 nm and 273 nm, Q value (A414/A273). AdR was heterologously expressed and purified as described elsewhere (28Sagara Y. Wada A. Takata Y. Waterman M.R. Sekimizu K. Horiuchi T. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1993; 16: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The molar extinction coefficient used for concentration estimation was ϵ450 = 10.9 mM–1 cm–1 (8Chu J.-W. Kimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2089-2094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CYP11A1 was isolated from bovine adrenals, and the concentration was estimated by carbon monoxide difference spectra assuming ϵ450–490 = 91 mm–1 cm–1 according to a previous study (29Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stopped Flow Measurements—Rapid mixing experiments were carried out with a single channel stopped-flow spectrophotometer SX-17MV equipped with PEEK tubings (Applied Photophysics) at 15 °C. The system was made anaerobic as described previously (19Schiffler B. Kiefer M. Wilken A. Hannemann F. Adolph H.W. Bernhardt R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36225-36232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The reaction buffer consisted of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), varying amounts of potassium chloride, and 0.05% Tween 20. The pH of the buffer was checked after salt addition and remained constant. Two different modes of mixing were used as specified below. To follow only the reduction of AdR by NADPH in the stopped flow apparatus, syringe A contained AdR (20 μm) and the concentration of NADPH in syringe B was equimolar. In a second set of measurements we used a 100-fold excess of NADPH. The change of absorbance at 450 nm was monitored, corresponding to the maximum change in absorbance upon reduction of AdR. To determine the reduction rate of Adx (40 μm) and AdR (20 μm), the two oxidized proteins were mixed with NADPH (400 μm). Kinetic traces were followed at 450 nm where both proteins possess an absorbance maximum (8Chu J.-W. Kimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2089-2094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Estabrook R.W. Suzuki K. Mason J.I. Baron J. Taylor W.E. Simpson J.P. Purvis J. McCarthy J. Iron-Sulfur Proteins. 2. Academic Press, New York1973: 193-223Google Scholar). A second approach to determine the reduction rate for Adx was the mixing of pre-reduced AdR with oxidized Adx, following Adx reduction at 414 nm corresponding to the main absorbance change upon reduction (30Estabrook R.W. Suzuki K. Mason J.I. Baron J. Taylor W.E. Simpson J.P. Purvis J. McCarthy J. Iron-Sulfur Proteins. 2. Academic Press, New York1973: 193-223Google Scholar). To follow specifically the reduction of CYP11A1, syringe A contained CYP11A1 (4 μm) whereas syringe B was filled with NADPH (400 μm), AdR (4 μm), and Adx (8 μm). The mixture in syringe B was allowed to age for 10 min to assure a complete reduction of Adx. The solutions in the two syringes were CO-saturated prior to loading into the driving syringes. To follow the whole cascade of reactions (i.e. reduction of AdR, Adx, and CYP11A1) syringe A contained only NADPH (400 μm) and syringe B was filled with the three proteins in the following concentrations, AdR (4 μm), Adx (8 μm), and CYP11A1 (4 μm). The reaction was monitored at 450 nm recording 4000 data points with a split time base of 10/200 s. The dead time for the measurements was 1.3 ms with the SX-17MV apparatus. To reduce the background, three to seven identical reaction traces of each measurement were overlaid and averaged. Data fitting was performed using the program SigmaPlot 2001. Mono- or bi-exponential functions were fitted to the averaged curves to determine apparent rate constants for the reduction of AdR by NADPH, of Adx by AdR, and of CYP11A1 by Adx. Upon reduction, all three proteins show marked changes in their absorbance at 450 nm. To follow the reduction of AdR by NADPH and of Adx by AdR, respectively, in one measurement, the decrease of the absorbance at 450 nm was followed. Formation of the reduced cytochrome was monitored by the respective CO complex, giving rise to an absorbance maximum at 450 nm. Optical Biosensor Measurements—Analysis of the binding of oxidized Adx to AdRox or to CYP11A1ox was performed by using a Biacore2000 system. Immobilization of Adx to the carboxyl methylated dextran matrix of a CM5 sensor chip was carried out as described previously (31Zollner A. Hannemann F. Lisurek M. Bernhardt R. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 644-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To activate the carboxyl groups on the sensor chip a solution containing a 0.2 mN-ethyl-N′-dimethylaminopropylcarbodiimide and 0.05 mN-hydroxysuccinimide was injected onto the chip with a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Afterward free amino groups of each Adx species were used to covalently couple ∼200 resonance units of the respective protein to the sensor chip matrix. The coupling procedure was completed by injecting 50 μl of a 1 m ethanolamine hydrochloride solution to block any remaining free ester groups. The binding analysis was carried out by injecting different AdRox or CYP11A1ox concentrations in the range from 10 to 500 nm with a flow rate of 10 μl/min and recording the refractive index changes. All protein-containing solutions were prepared in Biacore HBS-EP buffer (0.01 m HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, with 0.005% Surfactant P20). To remove still bound AdR or CYP11A1 we injected 5 μl of a 1 mm NaOH solution. The regeneration performance was evaluated by analyzing the baseline response after up to 30 binding cycles with 500 nm AdR and 500 nm CYP11A1, respectively. The observed changes were below 10% (data not shown), indicating a good regeneration performance. Analysis of the binding curves and the determination of Kd values were achieved by using the Biacore evaluation software 3.1. CYP11A1-dependent Substrate Conversion Assay—CYP11A1-dependent conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone under varying salt concentrations was performed as described (32Sugano S. Morishima N. Ikeda N. Horie S. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with slight modifications (20Hannemann F. Rottmann M. Schiffler B. Zapp J. Bernhardt R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1369-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cholesterol side-chain cleavage activity was assayed for 10 min at 37 °C in a reconstituted system. The mixture contained CYP11A1 (0.5 μm), different amounts of Adx (from 0.2 μm to 3.2 μm), AdR (0.5 μm), and cholesterol (100 μm). The reaction was started by adding NADPH. The buffer used for the substrate conversion assay was the same as that described for the stopped flow assays but, in addition, contained an NADPH-regenerating system. This regenerating system consisted of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose 6-phosphate, and magnesium chloride. The reaction was stopped by boiling the samples. After cooling down to 37 °C, cholesterol oxidase was added to convert the steroids to the respective 3-on-4-ene form (i.e. progesterone and cholestenone). The reaction was carried out for 10 min and stopped by adding chloroform to extract the steroids. After addition of cortisol as an internal standard, the samples were analyzed by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography on a JASCO system using a C-18 column (3.9 × 150 mm, waters) heated in a peltier oven to 40 °C. The internal standard was necessary because of the additional isomerase activity of cholesterol oxidase, which makes the exact determination of the transformed cholesterol impossible but not that of pregnenolone. The mobile phase used for separation was a mixture of acetonitrile: isopropanol (30:1). To quantitate the peak areas of the internal standard and the product, the JASCO Borwin software was used. Further data evaluation was done using Microsoft Excel. In this report, we performed binding studies to investigate the protein-protein interactions of the mitochondrial CYP11A1 system in combination with a detailed time-resolved kinetic analysis of all protein components of this system. Due to the ionic nature of the interaction process of Adx with AdR and CYP11A1, respectively, the salt dependence was also studied at varying ionic strength. Such variations of the ionic strength have been analyzed by Hintz and Peterson (33Hintz M. Peterson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6721-6728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and they affect the reduction behavior of the CYP101 system. CYP11A1 substrate conversion assays were carried out to correlate the binding and the redox processes with the catalytic activity of the system under physiological conditions. We used recombinant bovine wild type AdR, recombinant bovine wild type Adx, and CYP11A1 purified from bovine adrenals. The interactions of the oxidized reaction partners of the mitochondrial P450 system have been investigated with an optical biosensor system (SPR). As described under “Materials and Methods,” the ferredoxin component was coupled to a chip and either the flavoprotein or the cytochrome were passed over this chip. Complex formation between AdR and Adx is a fast process characterized by a kon rate of 4434 m–1 s–1 and a Kd being in the nanomolar range (Table I). Binding studies concerning the interaction of Adx with CYP11A1 resulted in a pronounced difference as compared with the binding of Adx to AdR (Table I). For Adx binding to CYP11A1, the on-rate was determined to be about 156-fold faster than the on-rate observed for AdR. Also, the Kd values for the two different complexes studied vary dramatically. The Adx·CYP11A1 complex is 63-fold more stable than the AdR·Adx complex.Table IBinding parameters for the different reaction partners of the bovine CYP11A1 system as determined from measurements with a Biacore 2000 systemProtein-protein interactionkonkoffKd (koff/kon)m-1 s-1s-1mAdx·AdR44340.00380.856 × 10-6Adx·CYP11A1691,0000.009260.0134 × 10-6 Open table in a new tab The behavior of the reduced proteins was analyzed by stopped flow experiment analysis, which allows the reduction kinetics of each component to be followed directly. Two different modes of rapid mixing were compared. In a first series of measurements, the purine nucleotide (NADPH) was mixed with the protein components of the electron transfer chain. A second approach used a mixture of pre-reduced reductase and Adx, which were subsequently mixed with the oxidized terminal electron acceptor of this system, CYP11A1. A typical reaction trace observed at 450 nm after mixing of NADPH (syringe A) with AdR, Adx, and CYP11A1 (syringe B) is given in Fig. 1. In the first 250 ms of the reaction a fast drop of the absorbance was observed. The duration of this process depended on the ionic strength and took up to 500 ms (data not shown). This decrease in absorbance occurred in two phases, a first one within 60 ms followed by a second somewhat slower drop (Fig. 1, inset). The first and second phases were separated by a small plateau (constant absorbance) of 10–15 ms. These two phases of the reaction trace are in agreement with a sequential reduction of the FAD containing AdR by NADPH followed by the reduction of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in Adx (see also below). AdR reduction as well as Adx reduction leads to a clear decrease of absorbance at 450 nm as documented for the individual proteins in previous studies (12Lambeth J.D. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4299-4306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Estabrook R.W. Suzuki K. Mason J.I. Baron J. Taylor W.E. Simpson J.P. Purvis J. McCarthy J. Iron-Sulfur Proteins. 2. Academic Press, New York1973: 193-223Google Scholar). The third phase of the reaction trace is characterized by a pronounced increase of absorbance (Fig. 1). This rise at 450 nm is expected upon CO complex formation of the ferrous heme in CYP11A1. All three phases can be fitted very well to mono-exponential functions yielding one velocity constant for each distinct process. The first 60-ms phase of the reduction (i.e. the reduction of AdR) is dependent on the ionic strength of the reaction mixture, as described above. Fig. 2 (filled circles) shows the apparent velocity constant of the first phase observed at different potassium chloride concentrations. The highest kapp value could be observed at 50 mm potassium chloride. Lower or higher salt concentrations lead to a decrease of the observed velocity in this first part of the overall reaction. If the ionic strength exceeds 150 mm, an even lower kapp can be observed compared with conditions were no salt was added. The second phase (from about 85 ms to 250 ms) of the reaction trace followed at 450 nm confers to the reduction of Adx by AdR (see also below). The changes of the apparent velocity constants for the reduction of Adx at different ionic strength are given in Fig. 2 (open circles). The overall rate constants observed for the ferredoxin reduction were decreased by a factor of 10 as compared with the reduction of AdR described above. Interestingly the optimum kapp value was observed at an ionic strength of 100 mm. The third phase (starting from 250 ms) of the reaction trace observed at 450 nm is an increase of the absorbance (Fig. 3, filled circles). This increase occurred upon CO complex formation of the ferrous CYP11A1. The kapp values observed for the reduction of CYP11A1 decrease dramatically with increasing salt concentration. This observation is in good agreement with the ionic nature of the complex between Adx and CYP11A1 (34Lambeth J.D. Geren L.M. Millett F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10025-10029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Tuls J. Geren L. Lambeth J.D. Millett F. J. Biol.

The third phase of the reduction process (i.e. the reduction of CYP11A1) as described above was compared with the reduction kinetics of CYP11A1 when mixed rapidly with the pre-reduced electron transfer components. Using pre-reduced ferredoxin (i.e. NADPH, AdR, and Adx in syringe 1 versus CYP11A1 in syringe 2), the drop in absorbance at the beginning of the measurement (first and second phase) could not be observed (data not shown). Thus, the reduction of AdR and Adx (seen in the measurements above; cf.Fig. 1) was completed here during the incubation of NADPH, AdR, and Adx in syringe 1 before mixing with CYP11A1 in syringe 2. In this mixing mode, the traces of reduction of CYP11A1 by Adx were also best described by a mono-exponential equation. These measurements are in good agreement with previous observations using this mixing mode (19Schiffler B. Kiefer M. Wilken A. Hannemann F. Adolph H.W. Bernhardt R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36225-36232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The pronounced dependence on the ionic strength of CYP11A1 reduction is shown in Fig. 3 (open circles). A more than 23-fold decrease of the apparent velocity constant with increasing ionic strength was observed. The data obtained from these measurements are in the same range as the data for CYP11A1 reduction in the “one shot” measurements described above (Fig. 3, filled circles). To validate the data obtained in the one-shot measurements reported above (i.e. AdR reduction and Adx reduction), we performed separate stopped flow measurements with each of the components of the CYP11A1 system (Figs. 4 and 5). In a first set of experiments, we investigated the reduction of AdR by NADPH under different conditions. Reduction of AdR by an excess of NADPH resulted in a bi-exponential reaction trace (Fig. 4A). The first fast phase had an apparent rate constant of 44.9 s–1, whereas the second phase was slower with 5.9 s–1. These results are in excellent agreement with previous data provided by Lambeth and Kamin (12Lambeth J.D. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4299-4306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, when using equimolar concentrations of NAPDH and AdR, the reaction was clearly mono-phasic, and the kapp value derived from the reaction trace was 17.4 s–1 (Fig. 4B).Fig. 5A, reduction of Adx (4 μm) and AdR (2 μm) by NADPH (400 μm, syringe 1).

The dotted gray line indicates the fit. The correlation coefficient for the fit is r = 0.99. The residuals are given below the reaction trace.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In a next experiment we used NADPH, AdR, and Adx (Fig. 5A). When mixing an excess of NADPH in one syringe with AdR and Adx in the other syringe, the reaction was clearly bi-phasic with a first fast phase of 53.4 s–1, and a second slower phase with an apparent velocity of 2.2 s–1. The first phase was the reduction of AdR; the second phase was the reduction of Adx. When using pre-reduced AdR in one syringe and oxidized Adx in the other syringe, the process was clearly bi-phasic (Fig. 5B). We observed a first fast phase with an apparent rate constant of 71.1 s–1 followed by a second phase with a kapp of 5.6 s–1. These data are close to the data obtained upon mixing of NADPH with the two oxidized proteins. The second rate constant is also in good agreement with previous studies (31Zollner A. Hannemann F. Lisurek M. Bernhardt R. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 644-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and corresponds with the reduction of Adx by AdR. The first apparent rate constant observed in these measurements was in the range of those observed for the reduction of AdR. However, even in the presence of excess NADPH, the reduction of AdR was incomplete, i.e. some AdR remained in the oxidized state. On the other hand, the on-rate for the complex formation between AdR and Adx was calculated to be 4434 s–1m–1 from our SPR measurements, suggesting a fast binding event. Owing to these two facts, the first phase observed in the pre-steady state experiments with pre-reduced AdR and oxidized Adx can be explained by the progressing reduction of AdR in the presence of Adx. In support of this observation, previous data of Lambeth (12Lambeth J.D. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4299-4306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) show ternary complex formation between the reduction equivalent delivering NADPH and the first two protein components of the CYP11A1 electron transfer chain (i.e. AdR and Adx) upon reduction of AdR. The conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone was monitored to link the results of the redox experiments described above to the overall reaction catalyzed by CYP11A1. The influence of different salt concentrations on the substrate conversion is depicted as kcat/Km (i.e. the catalytic efficiency, which is a measure for the efficiency of the overall reaction with a spe"

However, the mechanism underlying this effect is not known. We set out to determine whether cellular sensitivity to caspase activation could be affected by modulating presenilin 1 (PS1) processing. PS1 processing was altered using RNA interference (RNAi) aimed at silencing the expression of the genes encoding the four components of the γ-secretase complex, PSEN1, APH-1, PEN-2, and nicastrin. RNAi for these genes was carried out in naive H4 human neuroglioma cells, as well as H4 cell lines overexpressing either wild-type PSEN1 or the Familial Alzheimer's disease mutant PSEN1-Δ9 (PS1-mutant), that were induced to undergo apoptosis. In wild-type PSEN1 cells, RNAi for PEN-2, as expected, increased levels of full-length PS1 (PS1-FL) and decreased PS1 endoproteolysis. This was accompanied by potentiated caspase-3 activation in response to an apoptotic stimulus. In contrast, nicastrin RNAi, which only decreased levels of PS1-amino-terminal fragment and did not affect PS1-FL levels, had no effect on caspase-3 activation during apoptosis. Surprisingly, in the PS1-mutant cells, RNAi for PEN-2 (and APH-1) did not increase but instead reduced the levels of PS1-FL deleted for exon 9. In turn, this was accompanied by attenuated caspase-3 activation in response to an apoptotic stimulus. Finally, in naive H4 cells, PSEN1 RNAi also attenuated caspase-3 activation in response to an apoptotic stimulus. Collectively, these findings indicate that cellular sensitivity to caspase activation correlates with overall PS1 protein levels, particularly with levels of FL-PS1.

The resulting amino-terminal fragment (NTF) and carboxyl-terminal fragment each separately contributes one aspartyl residue to the catalytic site (24Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S.

Biochemical and genetic evidence indicate that the γ-secretase complex consists of PS1 heterodimers, NTF and carboxyl-terminal fragment (32Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J.

Thus, PS1-endoproteolytic fragments are the “active” form of PS1 necessary for γ-secretase activity.We set out to determine whether cellular sensitivity to caspase activation could be affected by modulating PS1 processing. PS1 processing was manipulated using RNAi to silence the expression of the genes encoding the four known components of the γ-secretase complex, PSEN1, APH-1, PEN-2, and NCSTN. For these studies, we employed naive H4 human neuroglioma cells as well as H4 cell lines overexpressing either WT PSEN1 (PS1-WT) or the FAD mutant, PSEN1-Δ9 (PS1-mutant). To induce apoptosis, we used 1 μm staurosporine (STS). Changes in the levels of full-length PS1 (PS1-FL) versus the active PS1-endoproteolytic fragments (for this purpose, the NH2-terminal fragment, PS1-NTF) were then monitored relative to levels of caspase activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines—We employed naive H4 human neuroglioma (H4) cells and H4 cells stably transfected to express low levels of either the PSEN1-Δ9 (PS1-mutant cells) or WT PS1 (PSI-WT cells). These cells have previously been shown to express sufficiently low levels of PS1 so as to avoid spontaneous apoptosis that can result from robust overexpression of PS1 (7Kovacs D.M. Mancini R. Henderson J. Na S.J. Schmidt S.D. Kim T.W. Tanzi R.E. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2278-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). All of the cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) containing 9% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Stably transfected H4 cells were additionally supplemented with 200 μg/ml G418.RNAi and Cell Treatments—Small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes were designed and obtained from Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Lafayette, CO) against human PSEN1 (5′-AAGGTCCACTTCGTATGCTGG-3′), NCSTN (5′-AAGGGCAAGTTTCCCGTGCAG-3′), APH-1 (5′-AAGAAGGCAGATGAGGGGTTA-3′), and PEN-2 (5′-AAUCAAAGGCUAUGUCUGGCG-3′). Cell transfection agent TKO (Mirus, Madison, WI) without siRNA was used as control siRNA. Scrambled siRNA (5′-AAATGTGTGTACGTCTCCTCC-3′) (42Luo W.J. Wang H. Li H. Kim B.S. Shah S. Lee H.J. Thinakaran G. Kim T.W. Yu G. Xu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7850-7854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and luciferase GL2 siRNA (5′-CGTACGCGGAATACTTCGA-3′) were used in comparison with the control siRNA to determine the effects on PS1-proteolytic processing and caspase-3 activation. siRNAs were transfected into cells using TKO transfection reagent. After 144 h, the cells were treated with 1 μm STS (Sigma) for 6 h and harvested at the end of the treatment. 100 μm Z-VAD-fmk (Bachem, Torrance, CA), a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, was used to inhibit caspase activation. Z-VAD or its vehicle, Me2SO, was given to cells 1 h before STS or saline treatment.Cell Lysis and Protein Amount Quantification—Cell pellets were detergent-extracted on ice using immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) plus protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). The lysates were collected, centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and quantified for total proteins by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce).Western Blot Analysis of PS1-proteolytic Processing and Caspase-3 Cleavage—Western blot analysis was performed as described by Kovacs et al. (7Kovacs D.M. Mancini R. Henderson J. Na S.J. Schmidt S.D. Kim T.W. Tanzi R.E. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2278-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). 40 μg of total protein of each sample was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 4–20% gradient Tris/glycine gels under reducing conditions (Invitrogen). Proteins next were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) using a semidry electrotransfer system (Amersham Biosciences). Nonspecific proteins were blocked using 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 for 1.5 h. Blots were then incubated with a primary antibody followed by a secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody 1:10,000, Pierce). Blots were washed with 1× Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 for 30 min between steps. Antibody Ab14 (1:2500) (a generous gift of Dr. Sam Gandy, Thomas Jefferson University) was used to recognize PS1-FL (35–40 kDa in H4 mutant PSEN1-Δ9 cells and 40–45 kDa in H4 PS1-WT cells) and PS1-NTF (25–30 kDa). Antibody PNT-2 (1:500) (a generous gift of Dr. Gopal Thinakaran, University of Chicago) was used to detect PEN-2. Antibody anti-nicastrin (1:1000) (Calbiochem) was used to detect nicastrin. Antibody anti-mAPH-1a (1:1000) (Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA) was used to detect APH-1. A caspase-3 antibody (1:1000 dilution, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) was used to recognize caspase-3 fragment (17–20 kDa) resulting from cleavage at aspartate position 175. To visualize full-length caspase-3 in the experiments assessing the effects of PSEN1 siRNA treatment on caspase-3 cleavage, we used a caspase-3 antibody (1:1000 dilution) from Cell Signaling. The intensity of signals was analyzed using an image program (NIH Image 1.62). We quantified the Western blots as follows. We used the levels of β-tubulin to normalize the levels of cleaved caspase-3 (i.e. by determining the ratio of cleaved caspase-3 amount to β-tubulin amount), PS-FL, and PS1-NTF to control for loading differences in total protein amounts. We present the changes in the levels of cleaved caspase-3, PS-FL, and PS1-NTF in the cells treated with PSEN1, PEN-2, NCSTN, or APH-1 siRNA as the percentage of those in the cells treated with control siRNA.Statistics—ANOVA with repeated measurements was employed to compare the difference from the control group. The p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.RESULTSPSEN1 RNAi Decreases Caspase-3 Activation in Naive H4 Cells—We first assessed the effects of RNAi-mediated silencing of PSEN1 in naive human neuroglioma H4 cells treated with 1 μm STS to induce apoptosis. The effects on caspase activation then were assessed by monitoring caspase-3 cleavage (activation). 144 h after transfection with PSEN1 siRNA or control siRNA, cells were pretreated with either Me2SO or 100 μm Z-VAD, a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, for 1 h followed by saline or 1 μm STS for another 6 h. The cells then were harvested and subjected to Western blot analyses in which antibodies Ab14, caspase-3, and anti-β-tubulin were used to detect PS1 (PS1-FL and PS1-NTF), cleaved (activated) caspase-3, and the control protein, β-tubulin, respectively.Based on ratios of cleaved (activated) caspase-3 (17–20 kDa) to full-length caspase-3 (35 kDa), neither control siRNA nor PSEN1 siRNA activated caspase-3. There also was no significant difference in the amounts of β-tubulin between PSEN1 siRNA-treated and control siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 1A). As expected, STS induced caspase-3 cleavage in both control siRNA-treated and PSEN1 siRNA-treated cells. However, less caspase-3 cleavage was observed in the cells treated with PSEN1 siRNA (Fig. 1A). Z-VAD blocked the ability of STS to induce caspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 1A). As expected, PS1 immunoblotting revealed visible reductions in PS1-NTF following PSEN1 siRNA as compared with control siRNA (Fig. 1A). Because the endogenous levels of PS1-FL are low in naive H4 cells (40Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Hardy J.

Quantitation of the ratio of cleaved (activated) versus FL caspase-3 and the levels of PS1-NTF, normalized to levels of β-tubulin, revealed a 59% decrease in caspase-3 cleavage in the PSEN1 siRNA-treated cells as compared with control siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 1B, p < 0.05). PSEN1 siRNA also decreased the levels of PS1-NTF to 28% as compared with control siRNA (Fig. 1C, p < 0.05). Endogenous levels of PS1-FL were too low to be detected (40Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R.

These results indicate that PSEN1 siRNA, which reduces overall PS1 levels in naive H4 cells, also attenuates caspase-3 cleavage/activation. Because PSEN1 RNAi has been shown previously (28Francis R. McGrath G. Zhang J. Ruddy D.A. Sym M. Apfeld J. Nicoll M. Maxwell M. Hai B. Ellis M.C. Parks A.L. Xu W. Li J. Gurney M. Myers R.L. Himes C.S. Hiebsch R. Ruble C. Nye J.S. Curtis D. Dev.

We first documented that PEN-2 siRNA treatment decreased the protein levels of PEN-2 in PS1-WT H4 cells (Fig. 2A). Luo et al. (42Luo W.J. Wang H. Li H. Kim B.S. Shah S. Lee H.J. Thinakaran G.

We describe a novel method employing fluorescence anisotropy to directly measure Ac in any sample after the addition of a trace amount of labeled thymosin β4 or thymosin β4 peptide. Using this assay, we confirm earlier theoretical work on the helical polymerization of actin and confirm the effects of actin filament-stabilizing drugs and capping proteins on Ac, thereby validating the assay. We also confirm a controversial prior observation that profilin lowers the critical concentration of Mg2+-actin. A general mechanism is proposed to explain this effect, and the first quantitative dose-response curve for the effect of profilin on Ac facilitates its evaluation. This mechanism also predicts the effect of profilin on critical concentration in the presence of the limited amount of capping protein, which is the condition often found in cells, and the effect of profilin on critical concentration in cell extracts is demonstrated for the first time. Additionally, nonlinear effects of thymosin β4 on the steady state amount of F-actin are explained by the observed changes in Ac. This assay has potential in vivo applications that complement those demonstrated in vitro.

This assay has potential in vivo applications that complement those demonstrated in vitro. Total cellular actin is equal to the sum of the concentration of free monomer (the critical concentration, Ac), the concentration of unpolymerized actin sequestered by various actin-binding proteins, and the concentration of actin polymer or F-actin. Changes in Ac induced by actin regulatory proteins influence actin polymer dynamics by an amplification mechanism that results in large changes in the amount of sequestered, unpolymerized actin. Quantitative evaluation of models of cytoskeletal function requires accurate knowledge of the value of Ac. Unfortunately, Ac has not yet been measured in cells and has only been estimated by very indirect methods in cell extracts (1Devineni N. Minamide L.S. Niu M. Safer D. Verma R. Bamburg J.R. Nachmias V.T. Brain Res. 1999; 823: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In vitro methods have been developed that allow for the measurement of F-actin using birefringence (2Yin H.L.

Other methods such as the DNase I binding assay yield the sum of Ac and an indeterminate fraction of sequestered actin monomer (8Blikstad I. Markey F. Carlsson L. Persson T. Lindberg U.

Clever uses of combinations of data have in some cases allowed investigators to subtract F-actin content from total actin and then fractionate the contributions of Ac and monomer sequestration (9Pantaloni D.

Based on theoretical considerations, the critical concentration is expected to be equal to the ratio of the rate constants of association and dissociation of actin subunits from actin filaments. Measurement of these rate constants using a method such as electron microscopy can be used to indirectly evaluate Ac, assuming the applicability of the theory (13Pollard T.D. Mooseker M.S. J.

However, the participation of actin bound to monomer-sequestering proteins in filament growth, such as occurs with profilin-actin (15Tilney L.G. Bonder E.M. Coluccio L.M. Mooseker M.S. J.

The participation of profilin (or of proteins in the actobindin family) in barbed end elongation is an independent observation that may occur with or without an effect on Ac. Two basic mechanisms were suggested during the last decade (9Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 20Gutsche-Perelroizen I. Lepault J. Ott A. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6234-6243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The hypothesis that profilin could lower Ac by formation of a copolymer of actin monomer and actin in complex with profilin was first suggested in Ref. 20Gutsche-Perelroizen I. Lepault J. Ott A. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6234-6243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar when it was found that the cross-linked profilin-actin complex could be polymerized into filaments. According to this hypothesis, free actin and profilin-actin complex would both contribute a partial critical concentration driving polymer elongation. Although there is tantalizing crystallographic evidence that a copolymer is possible (21Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C. Lindberg U. Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), experimental evidence for copolymerization is mutually exclusive with evidence of barbed end capping by profilin (12Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Estes J.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6734-6743Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Nyman T. Page R. Schutt C.E. Karlsson R. Lindberg U. J. Biol.

Cytoskeleton. 1997; 37: 211-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although incorporation of profilin into actin filaments would be a condition required for the copolymerization model (24Oosawa F. Asakura S. Thermodynamics of the Polymerization of Protein. Academic Press, New York1975: 109-118Google Scholar), no significant incorporation of profilin into actin filaments was found experimentally when profilin was not covalently cross-linked to actin (20Gutsche-Perelroizen I. Lepault J. Ott A. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6234-6243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Instead, there are data that suggest that covalent or other high affinity profilin-actin complexes interfere with actin polymerization (22Nyman T. Page R. Schutt C.E. Karlsson R. Lindberg U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15828-15833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23DiNubile M.J. Huang S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1997; 37: 211-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The addition of the profilin molecule to the barbed end of the actin filament is often called “capping” because most of the literature agrees that the profilin molecule bound to the barbed end blocks further elongation, that is, profilin must dissociate from the end before the next actin subunit (free, or in complex with profilin) can be added. There is a disagreement in the literature on whether the effect of capping by profilin is significant. Some researchers assume that the affinity of profilin to the barbed end is very low and can be neglected in the modeling of actin polymerization process. Capping by profilin is very different from the capping by gelsolin or Cap Z, because unlike capping proteins that block both elongation and depolymerization, profilin blocks elongation but increases the rate of depolymerization (12Kinosian H.J.

Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) has been suggested as a possible explanation of profilin effect on actin critical concentration. It implies that barbed end elongation by profilin-actin could lower Ac if the free energy change upon the addition of an actin subunit to F-actin is different when monomer is directly added to the barbed end than when addition of actin monomer occurs via a pathway that includes incorporation of profilin-actin at the barbed end (9Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 12Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Estes J.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6734-6743Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The thermodynamic difference does not have to be large (∼ 2 kcal/mol) to explain the existing data but does require direct or indirect coupling of ATP hydrolysis to addition of the profilin-actin complex. Using a novel direct assay, we have obtained the first dose-response curve for the effect of profilin on actin critical concentration. That allowed us to evaluate the hypothesis of coupled ATP hydrolysis as well as an alternative hypothesis for the effect of profilin. We formulate a general description of actin polymerization in the presence of profilin. According to this mechanism, the main effect of profilin is the acceleration of actin polymerization dynamics. Proteins and Peptides—Pyrenyl-labeled and unlabeled rabbit skeletal muscle Ca2+-actin, recombinant human profilin, and recombinant rat thymosin β4 (identical in sequence to human) were purified as previously described (26Yarmola E.G. Parikh S. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45555-45563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For labeling with tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide (T-6027; Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR), the thymosin β4 cDNA was modified by the addition of a C-terminal cysteine. A truncated ϵ-amino rhodamine-labeled peptide (1-25 rhod-tβ4 peptide) was produced synthetically with a sequence that corresponds to the N-terminal 25 residues of thymosin β4, SDKPDMAEIEKFDKSKLKKTETQEK-rhodamine. Human recombinant gelsolin was truncated to the N-terminal 406 residues (identified here as gelsolin segment 1-3) prior to expression so as to eliminate the dependence of F-actin binding on calcium (27Selden L.A. Kinosian H.J. Newman J. Lincoln B. Hurwitz C. Gershman L.C. Estes J.E. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 3092-3100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Anisotropy Assay—A standard curve showing the fluorescence anisotropy of a rhodamine-labeled thymosin β4 peptide (0.1 μm) as a function of Mg2+-actin concentration in F buffer (5.0 mm Tris-HCl, 40 mm KCl, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.125 mm EGTA, and 0.01% sodium azide, pH 7.8) was generated with vertically excited polarized light at 546 nm in an L or T format steady state fluorimeter. The KCl concentration was 8.0 mm for the experiments employing unlabeled thymosin β4, and in this low salt buffer the standard curve as shown in Fig. 1 yields slightly higher affinity for thymosin β4 and actin with Kd = 0.12 μm relative to 0.2 μm at 40 mm KCl. The horizontal (Ih) and vertical (Iv) components of the emitted light are detected at 568 nm for 0.3-ml samples in glass cuvettes. The fluorescence anisotropy, r, is calculated using r = (Iv - GIh)/(Iv + 2GIh). The G factor is determined for the peptide in solution excited with horizontally polarized light and averaged over ∼100 measurements. Bound actin does not change the total fluorescence intensity of the rhodamine-labeled thymosin β4, so the observed anisotropy r is a linear function of the fraction of thymosin β4 that is bound to actin: r = (rbTb + rfTf)/T0, where rf is anisotropy of free thymosin (Tf = [T]), rb is anisotropy of thymosin bound to actin (Tb = [TA]), and T0 = [T] + [TA]. Any sample containing an unknown concentration of free actin (Ac, if at steady state) is assayed using conditions identical to those of the standards. Only trace amounts of labeled peptide (0.1 μm) are required, and although the calculations correct for the differences between free and total actin, for concentrations of free actin greater than 0.1 μm, this difference is negligible, and the results can be compared directly with the standard curve to determine Ac. The following section provides a general equation for the calculation of Ac, including values of Ac for which this difference is not negligible. Calculation of Ac—The equilibrium dissociation constant of thymosin β4 peptide for actin, KdT, is obtained from the titration of labeled thymosin β4 with G-actin by a fit to the equation, r=rf+(rb−rf)((KdT+At+T0)−((KdT+At+T0)2−4AtT0)1/2)/2T0 (Eq. 1) where T0 is the total concentration of labeled thymosin β4 peptide, and At is the total G-actin concentration for each value of r. Fitting parameters include only rb, rf, and KdT. Calculation of the free actin concentration Ac in a sample at steady state is straightforward using the measured anisotropy value and other parameters defined by calibration with a standard curve. Based on the equation [TA] = T0 [A]/(KdT + [A]) with r as defined above, [A] = β KdT, where β = (r - rf)/(rb - r). For measurements at steady state, Ac = [A]. Assuming that thymosin β4 and G-actin are at rapid equilibrium, the equations (and the assay) are also valid for calculation of [A] prior to steady state, for example, for determination of the free actin concentration as a function of time during actin polymerization (as in Fig. 3B). Correction for Possible Ternary Complexes of Profilin, Actin, and Thymosin β4in Calculation of AcBased on Anisotropy Data—The equation for Ac when profilin, actin, and thymosin β4 form a ternary complex is, Ac=(((KdP(1+P0/KdPT)−(βKdt))2+4KdPKdTβ)1/2−(KdP(1+P0/KdPT)−(βKdT)))/2 (Eq. 2) We assume here, as supported by our previous data (26Yarmola E.G. Parikh S. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45555-45563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), that any ternary complex of actin, thymosin β4, and another actin-binding protein, for example profilin (PAT), has the same value of rb as rb for the actin-thymosin β4 complex (AT). Then in the presence of actin and profilin Tb = [AT] + [PAT], and T0 = [T] + [AT] + [PAT]. At equilibrium or steady state conditions, [AT] and [PAT] are defined by Ac, total concentrations of thymosin β4T0 and profilin P0, and equilibrium dissociation constants KdP, KdT, and KdPT for formation profilin-actin complex PA, TA, or PAT, respectively. That means that r is completely defined by Ac, T0, P0, rb, rf, and equilibrium constants. At relatively low concentrations of thymosin β4 (T0 << KdPT), which is always the case for our experiments with both profilin and thymosin β4, r becomes independent of T0. So, if P0, rb, rf, and equilibrium constants are known, one can define Ac from anisotropy measurements. The values for rb, rf, and the equilibrium constants are already defined for several ionic conditions in our previous papers (and these parameters do not depend strongly on conditions), but they were independently verified by additional calibrations for each condition employed in the current manuscript. Depolymerization Experiment—0.5 μm 10% pyrene-labeled Mg2+ F-actin polymerized from spectrin seeds was diluted immediately upon reaching the saturation level of polymerization to 0.1 μm in the same polymerization buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.125 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl; the predicted free Ca2+ concentration for this buffer is 44.5 nm) containing various concentrations of profilin. Depolymerizing actin filaments should contain predominantly ATP or ADP-Pi actin at the barbed end because the t½ of phosphate release from ADP-actin for muscle actin is more than 5 min (19Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and the depolymerization assay was started immediately after polymerization was complete. The initial depolymerization rate was calculated from the depolymerization time course and plotted against profilin concentration (see Fig. 5C). Measurements of Critical Concentration in Cell Extracts—Calf brain cell extracts prepared from 200 grams of frozen bovine brain cut into very thin slices and placed in 100 ml of ice-cold extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5). A Dounce homogenizer (Pestle B) was used to open the cells, and 0.6 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate was added to the extract. The whole cell lysate was centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 1 h, and supernatant was frozen in liquid nitrogen. Fluorescence anisotropy was recorded as described above, except special attention was paid for control and correction of the effects of absorption and light scattering by the samples. To suppress the effect of light scattering, emission fluorescence was recorded at the wavelength of 575 nm rather than 568 nm. To control for light scattering, the base-line fluorescence of each sample was recorded before the addition of labeled thymosin β4, and the initial reading was subtracted from the level of fluorescence in presence of thymosin β4. Base-line fluorescence corresponded to 1-3% of the final sample reading. Fluorescence anisotropy was calculated for corrected and uncorrected fluorescence levels, and the results showed no significant difference. To control for the effect of light absorption in the samples, the G factor was separately recorded for each sample. Profilin was depleted from the extract by the addition of concentrated polyproline beads equilibrated with the same extraction buffer used to prepare cell extracts. After incubation for 10 min, the beads were removed by low spin centrifugation. The dilution of the sample because of bead addition was calculated based on initial and final volumes, and the control sample was diluted by the same factor. Nonmuscle (platelet) actin was used for calibration of anisotropy measurements in cell extracts. The affinity of platelet actin to labeled thymosin β4 in cell extract buffer was two or three times higher than that of muscle actin. Nonmuscle Actin—Lyophilized platelet actin was purchased from Cytoskeleton (APHL99). 100 μl of H2O and 500 μl of G buffer were added to 1 mg of lyophilized actin. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature 200 μl more of G buffer was added. Actin was centrifuged for 1 h at 4 °C and 65,000 rpm. 650 μl of supernatant was withdrawn, and the concentration was defined through optical density measurements at 290 nm with an extinction coefficient of 26 mm-1 cm-1. Validation of the Anisotropy Assay for Measurement of the Free Actin Concentration—We and others have made frequent use of steady state fluorescence anisotropy measurements to determine the equilibrium binding kinetics of various fluorescently labeled actin-binding proteins to actin. Specifically, we have previously used this technique to assess binding of thymosin β4 to actin (26Yarmola E.G. Parikh S. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45555-45563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The binding isotherm for this interaction, when plotted as anisotropy versus total actin for trace levels of rhodamine-labeled thymosin β4 (or synthetic 1-25 rhod-tβ4 peptide), provides a standard curve for determination of the free actin concentration in any sample in which the anisotropy is determined under the same standard conditions (Fig. 1, A and B). Full-length, recombinant thymosin β4 peptide interacts with actin with a Kd of 0.30 ± 0.04 μm, and the synthetic peptide 1-25 rhod-tβ4 binds with a Kd of 6.2 ± 0.5 μm. Because the assay is most accurate when the binding constant of the labeled thymosin β4 peptide is similar to the free actin concentration (or for Ac, when measuring at steady state), the use of 1-25 rhod-tβ4 peptide provides a standard curve with utility at higher free actin concentrations than does intact thymosin β4. We previously showed that thymosin β4 competes with rhodamine-labeled thymosin β4 in this anisotropy assay; with a dose response as expected if both have similar affinities for actin (26Yarmola E.G. Parikh S. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45555-45563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Moreover, because labeled thymosin β4 also inhibits binding by profilin, either competitively (9Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) or noncompetitively (26Yarmola E.G. Parikh S. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45555-45563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the use of thymosin β4 uniquely determines the free actin concentration in the presence of either or both of these actin monomer-sequestering proteins. Binding of 1-25 rhod-tβ4 peptide to actin is inhibited by profilin in a manner consistent with either competitive or noncompetitive inhibition, with the equilibrium dissociation constant for the ternary complex formation KdPT ≥ 80 μm (Fig. 1A, inset). If noncompetitive, then the binding of peptide to profilin-actin is so weak as to make a correction for ternary complex formation unnecessary for the data reported here. We confirm that the fraction of thymosin β4 bound to F-actin is insignificant at concentrations up to 30 μm (Fig. 1C), in agreement with prior data that implied that if such binding occurred, the Kd was several millimolar (10Carlier M.F. Didry D. Erk I. Lepault J. Van Troys M.L. Vandekerckhove J. Perelroizen I. Yin H. Doi Y. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9231-9239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This observation simplifies the analysis of the anisotropy data, because the anisotropy of labeled thymosin β4 will therefore only reflect binding to monomeric actin. As expected based on polymer theory, (28Oosawa F. Kasai M. J. Mol. Biol. 1962; 4: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), the critical concentration of rabbit muscle skeletal actin of 0.16 ± 0.03 μm is shown to be independent of total actin concentration (Fig. 2). Capping the barbed end of actin filaments with gelsolin increases the Ac value to 0.8 ± 0.2 μm, a value consistent with previous reports (29Tellam R. Frieden C. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3207-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Calcium actin in 100 mm KCl is shown to have Ac of 0.7 ± 0.2 μm, as previously reported (30Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3052-3059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The actin-filament stabilizing drug jasplakinolide decreases Ac to 0.08 ± 0.02 μm as speculated by us based on indirect evidence (31Bubb M.R. Sendarowicz A.M.J. Duncan K.L.K. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The monomer sequestering drug latrunculin A does not lower Ac, either in the presence (1.0 ± 0.3 μm) or in the absence (0.22 ± 0.04 μm) of gelsolin, as expected for an agent that only sequesters monomeric actin (32Yarmola E.G. Somasundaram T. Boring T.A. Spector I. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28120-28127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Effects of Profilin on the Critical Concentration—Using the anisotropy assay, profilin is seen to lower Ac when the barbed ends of Mg2+-F-actin are free, but not when they are capped by gelsolin (Fig. 3A). The free actin concentration, followed as a function of time, demonstrates a unique end point when steady state is approached from either G- or F-actin (Fig. 3B). Although both assays adequately track F-actin concentration (Fig. 3B, inset), relative to the measurement of F-actin by pyrenyl fluorescence, the anisotropy assay does not require labeled actin, yields data for Ac and not the sum of Ac and sequestered actin, and when F-actin concentration is large relative to Ac, does so more precisely. Only small amounts of profilin are necessary to alter Ac, and Ac varies continuously as a function of profilin concentration (Fig. 4A). When barbed ends are capped by gelsolin, the assay does not reveal any change of Ac at profilin concentrations up to 6 μm (Fig. 4B). The Mechanism of the Effect of Profilin on Actin Critical Concentration—The data shown in Fig. 4A provide a basis for a quantitative test of theories regarding the mechanism by which profilin decreases Ac. A derivation of the equations for the effect of profilin on Ac is provided in the “Appendix,” and the results are as follows. The rate of change in the concentration of F-actin subunits, Af, is, dAf/dt=f0(kp++wkb+)([A]−Ac) (Eq. 3) where Ac=(kp−+wRkb−)/(kp++wkb+) (Eq. 4) w=(1+(k′b+/kb+)[P]/KdP)/(1+[P]/Kdb) (Eq. 5) wR=(1+(k′b+/kb+)[P]/(RKdP))/(1+[P]/Kdb) (Eq. 6) At steady state dAf/dt = 0, and [A]=Ac (Eq. 7) In these equations, f0 is the concentration of actin polymer (i.e. the concentration of filaments). The constants kp+, kb+, kp-, and kb- are the respective elongation and dissociation rate constants from the pointed and barbed ends of F-actin, respectively. The primed rate constants are for the addition of profilin-actin and the loss of profilin-actin occurring at the barbed end. The constants KdP and Kdb are equilibrium dissociation constants for profilin for monomers and barbed ends, respectively, and [A] and [P] are the concentrations of free actin and free profilin. Parameters wR and w provide relative weighting factors for the barbed end off and on rates, respectively. Parameter R, characterizing the misbalance of the apparent energy square, is defined in the “Appendix,” and R = 1 when the energy square is balanced; in this case wR = w. At saturation with profilin, w = wsat = ((k′b+/kb+) Kdb/KdP) and equals ∼100 according to published values for the rate and equilibrium constants. The value of wR varies from 1 to wRsat = wsat/R.

https://openalex.org/W1986956917,"Non-erythroid protein 4.1R (4.1R) consists of a complex family of isoforms. We have shown that 4.1R isoforms localize at the mitotic spindle/spindle poles and associate in a complex with the mitotic-spindle organization proteins Nuclear Mitotic Apparatus protein (NuMA), dynein, and dynactin. We addressed the mitotic function of 4.1R by investigating its association with microtubules, the main component of the mitotic spindles, and its role in mitotic aster assembly in vitro. 4.1R appears to partially co-localize with microtubules throughout the mitotic stages of the cell cycle. In vitro sedimentation assays showed that 4.1R isoforms directly interact with microtubules. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays using GST-4.1R fusions and mitotic cell extracts further showed that the association of 4.1R with tubulin results from both the membrane-binding domain and C-terminal domain of 4.1R. Moreover, 4.1R, but not actin, is a mitotic microtubule-associated protein; 4.1R associates with microtubules in the microtubule pellet of the mitotic asters assembled in mammalian cell-free mitotic extract. The organization of microtubules into asters depends on 4.1R in that immunodepletion of 4.1R from the extract resulted in randomly dispersed microtubules. Furthermore, adding a 135-kDa recombinant 4.1R reconstituted the mitotic asters. Finally, we demonstrated that a mitotic 4.1R isoform appears to form a complex in vivo with tubulin and NuMA in highly synchronized mitotic HeLa extracts. Our results suggest that a 135-kDa non-erythroid 4.1R is important to cell division, because it participates in the formation of mitotic spindles and spindle poles through its interaction with mitotic microtubules."

The excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate elicits and modulates synaptic responses in the central nervous systems by activating two families of receptors: ligand-gated cation channels termed ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) 1The abbreviations used are: iGluR, ionotropic glutamate receptor; mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptor; ATD, amino-terminal domain; l-AP4, (S)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid; l-SOP, l-serine-O-phosphate; g, gauche; a, anti; GB/SA, generalized Born equation/surface area; IEF-PCM, integral-equation-formalism-polarizable continuum model; OPLS-AA, optimized potential for liquid simulations-all atom. and G-protein-coupled receptors termed metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). To date, the use of cloning techniques has led to the identification of eight mGluR subtypes and multiple splice variants, which have been subdivided into three groups (I–III) based on their sequence homology, signal transduction mechanisms, and pharmacological properties (1Nakanishi S. Science. 1992; 258: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (2300) Google Scholar). The stimulatory group I receptors (mGluR1 and mGluR5) give rise to postsynaptic increases in cytoplasmic calcium and/or presynaptic increases in neurotransmitter release, whereas groups II (mGlu2 and mGlu3) and III (mGlu4, mGlu6, mGlu7, and mGlu8) are primarily localized presynaptically and typically inhibit neurotransmission as autoreceptors either at glutamatergic synapses or at other neurotransmitter-releasing synapses (2Schoepp D.D. Jane D.E. Monn J.A. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1431-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). mGluRs are seven trans-membrane-spanning proteins that possess a large extracellular amino-terminal domain (ATD), characteristic of the family C G-protein coupled receptors to which they belong. The binding site of the endogenous ligand is contained within the ATD (3Okamoto T. Sekiyama N. Otsu M. Shimada Y. Sato A. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol.

Recently, an ATD construct of the mGluR1 receptor was crystallized and the x-ray structure was solved, providing valuable information regarding the glutamate-binding site (7Kunishima N. Shimada Y.

As a result, mGluR ligands show great promise as potential therapeutic agents, but to determine the physiological role and pharmacological importance of the individual mGluRs subtypes, highly selective agonists and antagonists for each subtype must first be developed. The design of novel high affinity subtype-selective ligands can be greatly facilitated by gaining a detailed understanding of the interactions between known ligands and various receptor subtypes at the atomic level.

These mutation studies have aimed at decreasing the binding affinity of a given ligand in order to demonstrate the importance of a certain residue for ligand binding; however, ligand-receptor interactions are a delicate matter and binding can be disturbed even by residues not directly involved in ligand binding. Furthermore, identifying which residues are important for selectivity can be difficult using this approach because the choice of mutation made for a given residue can greatly affect the information obtained. Therefore, we have chosen another approach toward elucidating the significance and contribution of individual amino acid residues to selectivity between the groups. This study aims to induce affinity for group I ligands at the group III receptor subtype, mGluR4, by means of point mutations that mimic the binding site residues of mGluR1. The classic group I mGluR agonists, quisqualic acid and ibotenic acid (see Fig. 1), were chosen as ligands, because they display considerable selectivity for group I over group III mGluRs (18Thomsen C.

We have used homology models to identify amino acids that are important for ligand selectivity and advanced computational methods for the interpretation of our empiric results. Materials—(S)-2-Amino-4-phosphonbutyric acid (l-AP4), α-amino-(3-hydroxy-5-isoxazolyl)acetic acid (ibotenic acid), (S)-α-amino-3,5-di-oxo-1,2,4-oxadiazolidine-2-propanoic acid (quisqualic acid), l-serine-O-phosphate (l-SOP), and l-[3H]AP4 (specific activity of 45.5 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Tocris Cookson (Bristol, United Kingdom). [3H]Quisqualic acid (specific activity of 34 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Generation of Expression Constructs—An expression construct of the rat mGluR1b was subcloned into a modified pEGFP-N1 vector (BD Biosciences) as previously described for the amino-terminal c-myc-tagged mGluR4a (22Hermit M.B. Greenwood J.R. Nielsen B. Bunch L. Jørgensen C.G. Vestergaard H.T. Stensbøl T.B. Sanchez C. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. Madsen U. Bräuner-Osborne H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 486: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The mGluR1 amino-terminal signal peptide was replaced by the mGluR5 signal peptide, because the mGluR5 signal peptide is known to promote good receptor expression and proper release of the epitope tag (23Pagano A. Rovelli G. Mosbacher J. Lohmann T. Duthey B. Stauffer D. Ristig D. Schuler V. Meigel I. Lampert C. Stein T. Prezeau L. Blahos J. Pin J. Froestl W. Kuhn R. Heid J. Kaupmann K. Bettler B. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1189-1202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To allow the detection of receptor surface expression by immunofluorescence, a c-myc epitope and a unique MluI site were incorporated at the amino-terminal of the DNA-encoding mGluR1 immediately downstream of the signal peptide. The DNA-encoding mGluR1 was subcloned by PCR and inserted into the vector by MluI/NotI digestion followed by ligation as previously described. The primers used for PCR, introducing a MluI/NotI site, were as follows: mGluR1 upstream (5′-GCG GCC GCG CGG CCG CCT ACA GGG TGG AAG AGC TTT GCT TGTA G-3′) and mGluR1 downstream (5′-GCG GCC GCG CGG CCG CTC AAA GCT GCG CAT GTG CCG ACG G-3′). The mGluR4 mutants, K74Y, E287G, S313G, and K317R, were produced by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis strategy (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions using the c-myc-tagged mGluR4 as a template. The primers containing the desired base pair changes were as follows: mGluR4 K74Y upstream (5′-GCG GGG AGC TGA AGA AGG AGT ACG GCA TCC ACC GCC-3′) and mGluR4 K74Y downstream (5′-GGC GGT GGA TGC CGT ACT CCT TCT TCA GCT CCC CGC-3′); mGluR4 E287G upstream (5′-GGG GTA TCA TCA TCT TTG CCA ACG GGG ATG ATA TCA GGA GGG-3′) and mGluR4 E287G downstream (5′-CCC TCC TGA TAT CAT CCC CGT TGG CAA AGA TGA TGA TAC CCC-3′); mGluR4 S313G upstream (5′-GGA TGG GTT CTG ATG GCT GGG GAT CCA AGA GTG CCC C-3′) and mGluR4 S313G downstream (5′-GGG GCA CTC TTG GAT CCC CAG CCA TCA GAA CCC ATC C-3′); and mGluR4 K317R upstream (5′-GGG TTC TGA TAG CTG GGG CTC GAG GAG TGC CCC TGT GC-3′) and mGluR4 K317R downstream (5′-GGG TTC TGA TAG CTG GGG CTC GAG GAG TGC CCC TGT GC-3′). In some mutants, a silent mutation leading to a unique restriction site was also introduced to facilitate the identification of plasmids with the desired mutation. The double mutants, mGluR4 K74Y/E287G, mGluR4 K74Y/S313G, and mGluR4 K74Y/K317R, were constructed by digestion of the single mutant plasmids with SacI and NotI followed by ligation, thereby inserting the second mutation in the mGluR4 K74Y plasmid. All of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Cell Cultures and Transfection—TSA cells (a transformed human embryonic kidney 293 cell line (24Chahine M. Bennett P.B. George Jr., A.L. Horn R. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 427: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar)) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing Glutamax-I and supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), and 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum (all from Invitrogen). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 95% humidified air, 5% CO2 incubator and subcultured every 3–4 days. The vectors encoding rat mGluR1b, mGluR4a, and the mGluR4a mutants (K74Y, E287G, S313G, K317R, K74Y/E287G, K74Y/S313G, and K74Y/S317R) were transfected into TSA cells using Polyfect according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Cells were used for experiments 2 days after transfection. Cell Surface Expression—For immunocytochemical analyses, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with PBS and subsequently incubated for 20 min with PBS supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum to reduce nonspecific binding. The solution was removed, and the mouse anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) at a 1:500 dilution in PBS containing 10% serum was applied and left at room temperature for 1 h. After washing, the cells were incubated for 1 h in the dark with the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) at a 1:500 dilution in PBS containing 10% serum. Finally, the cells were washed and observed with a Leica DMIL fluorescent microscope. Binding Assays on Cloned mGluRs—Membranes were harvested 2 days after transfection as described previously (25Kowal D. Hsiao C.L. Ge A. Wardwell-Swanson J. Ghosh K. Tasse R. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) with bovine serum albumin as standard. On the day of the assay, membranes were thawed, centrifuged, and re-suspended in cold binding buffer. Binding experiments were performed using a scintillation proximity assay from Amersham Biosciences, essentially as described already (26Monastyrskaia K. Lundstrom K. Plahl D. Acuna G. Schweitzer C. Malherbe P. Mutel V. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 1027-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) but with the earlier mentioned modifications (27Mathiesen J.M. Svendsen N. Bräuner-Osborne H. Thomsen C. Ramirez M.T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 138: 1026-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). For the l-[3H]AP4-binding experiments, the following were placed in a 96-well white Opti-plate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences): membranes (150 μg of protein, 50 μl); wheat germ agglutinin scintillation proximity assay beads (1 mg/well, 50 μl); compounds (100 μl); and l-[3H]AP4 (30 nm final concentration, 50 μl). The plate was sealed and shaken at room temperature for 1 h. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 100 μm l-SOP. The [3H]quisqualic acid-binding experiments were carried out in a similar way using a final concentration of 50 nm [3H]quisqualic acid and a binding buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.5). For homologous displacement experiments on mGluR1, 30 nm [3H]quisqualic acid was used. Data Analysis—Concentration-response experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate of at least three independent experiments. Homologous displacement and competitive binding curves were analyzed by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software). KD and Bmax values were estimated using the following equations (28Motulsky H. Neubig R. Crawley J. Gerfen C. McKay R. Rogawski M. Sibley D. Skolnick P. Current Protocols in Neuroscience. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 7.5.1-7.5.56Google Scholar) where L is the concentration of the radioactive ligand and the IC50 value and the specific binding (top-bottom plateau) are estimated by non-linear regression from homologous displacement curves: KD = IC50 - L and Bmax for the mutants compared with wild type Bmax = {specific binding/(IC50 × μg protein)}mutant/{specific binding/(IC50 × μg protein)}wild type × 100%. Ki values for competitive binding experiments were calculated from IC50 values by use of the Cheng-Prusoff equation (29Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12294) Google Scholar). Homology Modeling and Manual Docking—A model of the orthosteric binding sites for mGluR4 was made by comparative protein structure modeling as described previously (22Hermit M.B. Greenwood J.R. Nielsen B. Bunch L. Jørgensen C.G. Vestergaard H.T. Stensbøl T.B. Sanchez C. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. Madsen U. Bräuner-Osborne H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 486: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The subsequence of the ATD was submitted to SWISSPROT (30Schwede T. Diemand A. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Res. Microbiol. 2000; 151: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) using a single domain-closed chain of mGluR1 in complex with glutamate (Protein Data Bank accession number 1EWK) (7Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar) as template. The model was then analyzed using methyl and water probes in GRID18 (31Goodford P.J. J. Med. Chem. 1985; 28: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (2469) Google Scholar), which assisted the adjustment of the positions of glutamate and crystallographically observed water molecules within the binding site. For the initial identification of amino acids residues potentially important for quisqualic acid and ibotenic acid selectivity, the ligands were manually positioned such as glutamate in the model of mGluR4. Models of the mGluR4 single mutants (K74Y, E287G, S313G, and K317R) were also generated using SWISSPROT. Conformational Analysis—A systematic study of the internal energy profile of ibotenic acid in solution using the density functional theory has been described recently (22Hermit M.B. Greenwood J.R. Nielsen B. Bunch L. Jørgensen C.G. Vestergaard H.T. Stensbøl T.B. Sanchez C. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. Madsen U. Bräuner-Osborne H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 486: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Preliminary conformational analysis of quisqualic acid was performed by Monte Carlo searching using the molecular mechanics interaction energy forcefield plus GB/SA treatment of solvation in Macromodel 8.1 (Schrödinger Inc. 2003), treating the two quasistereoisomers around the sp3 ring nitrogen separately. Because quisqualic acid has two major torsion angles and one invertible nitrogen, full systematic conformational analysis using quantum mechanics is not currently feasible. Instead, the minima obtained from molecular mechanics were re-minimized using the same level of theory used for ibotenic acid (B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) with IEF-PCM continuum treatment of aqueous solvation in Gaussian 2003). Postanalysis showed that only a few possible rotamers were not present in the original ensemble. Manually constructing and minimizing these rotamers either led to high energy minima or a collapse to previously found rotamers. Internal ligand energies on the aqueous phase potential energy surface were determined for each rotamer by single point gas phase calculations at the solvated geometry according to B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) compared with the global minimum. Docking—The above homology models were prepared for docking using Glide 2.5 (Schrödinger Inc.) according to the recommended protocol with minor alterations as described previously (22Hermit M.B. Greenwood J.R. Nielsen B. Bunch L. Jørgensen C.G. Vestergaard H.T. Stensbøl T.B. Sanchez C. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. Madsen U. Bräuner-Osborne H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 486: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The models first were analyzed to assign protonation states and then submitted to a series of restrained minimizations using the OPLS-AA forcefield in Impact 2.5 (Schrödinger Inc.) followed by the calculation of Colomb and Van der Waals grids. The ligands (S)-ibotenic acid, (S)-quisqualic acid, and (S)-glutamic acid were prepared as tri-anions in extended conformations by minimization with the molecular mechanics interaction energy forcefield plus GB/SA treatment of solvation in Macromodel 8.1 and then docked using Glide. Because of the quasichiral sp3 ring nitrogen of quisqualic acid, which does not invert under flexible automated docking, both forms of this ligand were prepared and flexibly docked separately. The best docked poses were chosen on the basis of the Emodel scoring function together with visualization to ensure reasonable glutamate-like binding modes. Pose Refinement and Interaction Energies—The best ligand-receptor complexes of each of the ligands at each receptor/mutant were reminimized using the molecular mechanics interaction energy forcefield plus GB/SA treatment of solvation in Macromodel 8.1 with all of the backbone atoms, including amide protons, frozen. This was necessary because quisqualic acid contains a non-planar amide-like bond, whereas peptide bonds are generally considered planar. Single point energies then were calculated using the same forcefield for the complex, the ligand, and the protein in the absence of the ligand to give relative interaction energies. The rationale by which mutations were chosen was based on sequence alignment of the mGluR ATDs (Table I) (14Rosemond E. Peltekova V. Naples M. Thogersen H. Hampson D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 7333-7340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and by comparing the homology model of mGluR4 with the crystal structure of mGluR1. The non-conserved residues, Lys-74 in lobe I and Glu-287, Ser-313, and Lys-317 in lobe II (see Table I), were chosen for this study on the grounds that they lie within the glutamate binding pocket and are oriented toward the distal carboxylate of glutamate, which is presumably supplanted by the heterocyclic rings of quisqualic acid and ibotenic acid (see Fig. 4). From the mGluR4 model, Ser-313 was not predicted to be directly involved in ligand binding. Nonetheless, we hypothesized that Ser-313 influenced group selectivity because the serine is conserved within group III, whereas the corresponding residues are glycine in both groups I and II (see Table I).Table IEquivalent of mutated residues The table was based on a sequence alignment similar to that of Rosemond et al. (14Rosemond E. Peltekova V. Naples M. Thogersen H. Hampson D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 7333-7340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).

Non-transfected TSA cells showed no staining with c-myc antibody under the same conditions. These findings suggest the absence of mutation-induced global protein misfolding as the misfolded plasma membrane proteins are often retained within the cell. No specific l-[3H]AP4 or [3H]quisqualic acid binding was detected in untransfected TSA cell membranes using the scintillation proximity assay binding procedure. The Ki values for quisqualic acid and ibotenic acid at mGluR1 and mGluR4 wild type receptors were determined, and the results (see Tables II and III, Ki = 0.25 μm for ibotenic acid at mGluR1 (pKi = 6.6 ± 0.1)) were in agreement with previous findings (18Thomsen C.

The scintillation proximity assay binding procedure produced a signal-to-noise ratio strong enough to conduct l-[3H]AP4 competitive affinity experiments on all four single mutants. A reduction in the level of specific l-[3H]AP4 binding was observed for the K74Y, E287G, and K317R mutants, which showed 57, 30, and 33%, respectively, of wild type binding. This reduction was not due to a decrease in the number of receptors, because the Bmax values were at least as high as Bmax for the wild type mGluR4 (Bmax = 190, 240, and 210%, respectively, of wild type Bmax). The S313G mutant on the other hand showed an increase (180%) in the level of specific l-[3H]AP4 binding compared with wild type (Bmax = 130% of wild type Bmax). Correspondingly, the l-AP4 Kd value for the S313G mutant was similar to wild type, whereas increases in Kd values were observed for the K74Y, E287G, and K317R mutants (see Table II).Table IIl-[3H]AP4 binding experiments were performed on membranes from TSA cells transiently expressing mGluR4 or mGluR4 mutants using the SPA assay Data are given as the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments.l-AP4Quisqualic acidIbotenic acidKd (μm)Ki (μm)Fold-increased affinityKi (μm)Fold-increased affinitymGluR4 mutation[pKd ± S.E.][pKi ± S.E.][pKi ± S.E.]Wild type0.22530820[6.7 ± 0.0][3.4 ± 0.2][3.1 ± 0.1]K74Y1.11.14800.451800[6.0 ± 0.1][6.0 ± 0.1][6.4 ± 0.0]E287G2.53.31603.5230[5.6 ± 0.1][5.7 ± 0.2][5.5 ± 0.2]S313G0.1712.0442004.1[6.9 ± 0.1][4.9 ± 0.1][3.8 ± 0.2]K317R1.61.53400.97850[5.8 ± 0.0][5.8 ± 0.1][6.0 ± 0.0] Open table in a new tab Table III[3H]Quisqualic acid binding experiments were performed on membranes from TSA cells transiently expressing mGluR1 or mGluR4 double mutants using the SPA assay Data are given as the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments.ReceptormGluR1mGluR4 K74Y/E287GmGluR4 K74Y/S313GmGluR4 K74Y/K317RQuisqualic acid Kd (μm)0.0380.210.570.27[pKd ± S.E.][7.4 ± 0.1][6.7 ± 0.0][6.3 ± 0.1][6.6 ± 0.1] Open table in a new tab Competitive l-[3H]AP4-binding experiments showed that both quisqualic acid and ibotenic acid have an increased affinity for all four single mutants (Fig. 3 and Table II).

https://openalex.org/W1967004740,"Major histocompatibility complex class II protein (MHC II) molecules present antigenic peptides to CD4-positive T-cells. Efficient T cell stimulation requires association of MHC II with membrane microdomains organized by cholesterol and glycosphingolipids or by tetraspanins. Using detergent extraction at 37 °C combined with a modified flotation assay, we investigated the sequence of events leading to the association of MHC II with cholesterol- and glycosphingolipid-rich membranes (DRMs) that are distinct from tetraspanins. We find two stages of association of MHC II with DRMs. In stage one, complexes of MHC II and invariant chain, a chaperone involved in MHC II transport, enter DRMs in the Golgi stack. In early endosomes, these complexes are almost quantitatively associated with DRMs. Upon transport to late endocytic compartments, MHC II-bound invariant chain is stepwise proteolyzed to the MHC class II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP) that remains MHC II-bound and retains a preference for DRMs. At the transition between the two stages, CLIP is exchanged against processed antigens, and the resulting MHC II-peptide complexes are transported to the cell surface. In the second stage, MHC II shows a lower overall association with DRMs. However, surface MHC II molecules occupied with peptides that induce resistance to denaturation by SDS are enriched in DRMs relative to SDS-sensitive MHC II-peptide complexes. Likewise, MHC II molecules loaded with long-lived processing products of hen-egg lysozyme containing the immunodominant epitope 48–61 show a very high preference for DRMs. Thus after an initial mainly intracellular stage of high DRM association, MHC II moves to a second stage in which its preference for DRMs is modulated by bound peptides.

Ramm G. Schuurhuis D. Griffith J. Rescigno M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Rudensky A.Y. Ossendorp F. Melief C.J.M. Stoorvogel W. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). There, the invariant chain is stepwise-degraded to CLIP, a small peptide that remains bound to MHC II (7Avva R.R. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1994; 1: 763-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 8Ghosh P. Amaya M. Mellins E. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1995; 378: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). HLA-DM/H2-M, an MHC II chaperone largely restricted to the limiting membrane of MVBs, facilitates the exchange of CLIP for antigenic peptides (9Alfonso C. Karlsson L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 113-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This might require the back fusion of internal vesicles with the limiting membrane of MVBs, a process already shown to occur in maturing dendritic cells (6Kleijmeer M. Ramm G. Schuurhuis D. Griffith J. Rescigno M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Rudensky A.Y. Ossendorp F. Melief C.J.M. Stoorvogel W. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The subsequent outward tubulation of the limiting membrane has been suggested to give rise to MHC II transport vesicles destined for the plasma membrane. MVBs can also fuse directly with the plasma membrane and release internal vesicles as “exosomes” that apparently carry immunologically relevant MHC II peptide complexes (10Denzer K. Kleijmeer M. Heijnen H. Stoorvogel W. Geuze H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3365-3374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the cell surface, MHC II has been detected in cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich membrane domains (also termed lipid rafts) after antibody-mediated clustering (11Huby R.D. Dearman R.J. Kimber I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22591-22596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 12Goebel J. Forrest K. Flynn D. Rao R. Roszman T.L. Hum.

Immunol. 2000; 1: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 16Hiltbold E.M. Poloso N.J. Roche P.A. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 1329-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 17Bouillon M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 7099-7107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) At low antigen concentration, raft association of MHC II is important for T-cell stimulation (15Anderson H.A. Hiltbold E.M. Roche P.A. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this effect is caused by a clustering of MHC II in lipid rafts, leading to an increase in the local density of relevant MHC II-peptide complexes. Lipid rafts are thought to consist mainly of tightly packed sphingolipids, cholesterol, and a subset of peripheral and integral membrane proteins. They are envisioned to form a liquid-ordered phase in an environment of more fluidic glycerophospholipids (18Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar, 19Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar, 20Edidin M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 257-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). New results suggest that cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich membrane domains are only ∼5 nm in size, contain one to four proteins, and persist for less than a millisecond (21Subczynski W.K. Kusumi A. Biochim. Biophys. Act. 2003; 1610: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 22Sharma P. Varma R. Sarasij R.C. Ira Gousset K. Krishnamoorthy G. Rao M. Mayor S. Cell. 2004; 116: 577-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Ligand-triggered oligomerization of receptors and interaction with the cytoskeleton are thought to induce aggregation and fusion of these small, transient membrane domains to larger and more permanent “core rafts” that are able to fulfill cellular functions (21Subczynski W.K. Kusumi A. Biochim. Biophys. Act. 2003; 1610: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). They are implicated in signal transduction (23Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5187) Google Scholar), intracellular sorting (24Ikonen E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), and the transport of toxins and viruses (25Goot F.-G.v.d. Harder T. Semin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The tight packing of sphingolipids and cholesterol in lipid rafts is also deemed responsible for their stability in 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C. However, the removal of surrounding, non-packed lipids by Triton X-100 leads to fusion of rafts, giving rise to large structures not observed in cells (19Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar, 20Edidin M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 257-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). Detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) can therefore not be equated with lipid rafts; however, they may serve as a tool to estimate the affinity of a protein for a cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich, liquid-ordered membrane environment (26Mayor S. Riezman H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In addition to Triton X-100, detergents such as CHAPS (27Vogt A.B. Spindeldreher S. Kropshofer H. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 189: 136-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), Lubrol WX (28Röper K. Corbeil D. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), and Brij 98 (29Drevot P. Langlet C. Guo X.J. Bernard A.M. Colard O. Chauvin J.P. Lasserre R. He H.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1899-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) have been used for DRM isolation. Among these, Brij 98 is highly selective for non-raft lipids even at 37 °C. Moreover, it produces relatively small DRMs, which may therefore resemble lipid rafts more closely. There is evidence for a second type of membrane microdomain characterized by the presence of tetraspanins (30Hemler M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 397-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). In contrast to lipid rafts, which are critically dependent on lipid-lipid interactions, tetraspanin microdomains are thought to form networks governed by protein-protein interactions. These involve not only members of the tetraspanin family but many other proteins. It is interesting that a subpopulation of MHC II has been shown to associate with tetraspanin microdomains (31Kropshofer H. Spindeldreher S. Rohn T.A. Platania N. Grygar C. Daniel N. Wolpl A. Langen H. Horejsi V. Vogt A.B. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The interaction with tetraspanins seems to be significant because the MHC II molecules involved contain only intermediate-affinity peptides of limited diversity. Tetraspanin-dependent clustering of MHC II is thought to pre-concentrate them for efficient antigen presentation (31Kropshofer H. Spindeldreher S. Rohn T.A. Platania N. Grygar C. Daniel N. Wolpl A. Langen H. Horejsi V. Vogt A.B. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), similar to what was suggested for MHC II in lipid rafts (15Anderson H.A. Hiltbold E.M. Roche P.A. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Interactions of tetraspanins with MHC II, H2-M/HLA-DM, and HLA-DO (a regulator of H2-M/HLA-DM) are only preserved in mild detergents such as CHAPS or Brij 98 (30Hemler M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 397-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 32Hammond C. Denzin L.K. Pan M. Griffith J.M. Geuze H.J. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3282-3291PubMed Google Scholar). After extraction with these detergents, tetraspanins are not separated from cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich membranes on conventional flotation gradients (27Vogt A.B. Spindeldreher S. Kropshofer H. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 189: 136-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 33Claas C. Stipp C.S. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7974-7984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Herein, we describe a novel Brij 98-based procedure that results in the separation of MHC II-containing DRMs from tetraspanins. We demonstrate that MHC II passes through two consecutive stages of DRM association on its way to the cell surface defined by its interaction with invariant chain or processed antigens. We also show that the association of MHC II with DRMs in the second stage is modulated by peptides bound to MHC II. Cells, Antibodies, and Reagents—The cell lines M12.C3F6 (34Nabavi N. Ghogawala Z.

Transplant. 1983; 36: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) were propagated in CM, and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were used as concentrated supernatants. Anti-H2-M (1B9A) and anti-CLIP (CerCLIP.1) were generous gifts from Drs. Lars Karlsson and Peter Cresswell, respectively. mAbs against CD63 (H5C6) and lamp-1 (1D4B) developed by J. T. August were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Iowa City, IA). mAbs against B220 (RA3–6B2), B7–2 (GL1), and CD81 (EAT-1) were from BD PharMingen. Cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) and anti-CTB antibody were obtained from Quadratech (Epsom, UK). The anti-transferrin receptor mAb H68.4 was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were bought from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). Fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies and ProLong antifade kit were obtained from Molecular Probes. Neutravidin-horseradish peroxidase, streptavidin-agarose, and sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate were from Pierce. Protein A-Sepharose, 14C-labeled rainbow marker, PD-10 desalting columns, and ECL film were bought from Amersham Biosciences, Western Lite ECL reagent from PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences. Sucrose, β-octylglucoside, and DNase I were obtained from Calbiochem. 125I was purchased from MP Biomedicals. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled CTB, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, hen-egg lysozyme (HEL), and Kodak BioMax MS film were bought from Sigma. En3Hance autoradiography solution was from DuPont. Superfrost Plus slides were from Omnilab (Gehrden, Germany). All other chemicals were analytical grade and were obtained from Sigma or Merck/VWR. Immunofluorescent Co-patching Assay—1 × 106 M12.C3F6 cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml of mAb 40F or R1–9.6 (diluted in CM) for 40 min on ice. The cells were washed and then incubated with 10 μg/ml of the respective fluorescent secondary antibodies and 1 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-CTB for 40 min on ice. After several washes in ice-cold CM, the cells were resuspended in 100 μl of CM and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C to allow for patching. This was stopped by addition of ice-cold HBSS, followed by washes and fixation in 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were spun onto SuperFrost Plus slides and embedded in anti-fade medium. Analysis was done on a Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope with appropriate filter settings. Isolation of DRMs—DRMs were isolated according to a published method (29Drevot P. Langlet C. Guo X.J. Bernard A.M. Colard O. Chauvin J.P. Lasserre R. He H.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1899-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) with modifications; in our standard protocol, 3 × 107 cells were washed, resuspended in 1 ml of 10 mm triethanolamine, 10 mm acetic acid, 1 mm EDTA, and 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.4, supplemented with protease inhibitors (5.2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml E-64, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm iodoacetamide) (HB-T+). The cells were homogenized by repeated passage through a 23-gauge needle, and a post-nuclear supernatant was prepared (1000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). After re-extraction of the nuclear pellet with 200 μl of HB-T+, the combined supernatants were digested with 100 μg/ml DNase I for 1 h on ice. Post-nuclear membranes were pelleted (40,000 rpm, 45 min, 4 °C) in a TLA 45 rotor (Beckman Coulter) and resuspended in 300 μl of 20 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Brij 98, 0.02% NaN3, and protease inhibitors (MB+). After addition of DNase I (100 μg/ml), the post-nuclear membranes were lysed overnight on ice. The next day, the extract was adjusted to 500 μl with MB+, incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, mixed with 500 μl of 90% sucrose in MB, and transferred to a SW-41 tube. A 10-ml 40–0% sucrose gradient (in MB+) was poured on top of the sample, which was then spun (38,000 rpm, 16 h, 4 °C) in an SW41 rotor (Beckman Coulter). 11 or 22 fractions were collected from the top and the pellet was resuspended in 1 or 0.5 ml of MB+, respectively. In a shortened version of this protocol, a pellet of whole cells (3 × 107) was directly extracted with MB+ buffer with basically identical results. Cholesterol Extraction of Post-nuclear Membranes—A post-nuclear membrane pellet was prepared from 3 × 107 M12.C3F6 cells as described above and resuspended in H2Odd containing 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin. To extract cholesterol from membranes, the sample was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C followed by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm in a TLA45 rotor (Beckman Coulter) for 45 min at 4 °C. After aspiration of the supernatant, the extracted post-nuclear membrane pellet was then processed for raft isolation as described. Brefeldin A Treatment—BFA was added at 5 μg/ml to a culture of M12.C3F6 cells 4 h before harvest. Subsequent steps were as described above. Biotinylation and GSH-stripping Procedures—Surface and endosome-specific biotinylation were done with membrane-impermeant, cleavable sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate. Detailed protocols were described previously (5Lindner R. Traffic. 2002; 3: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In brief, for surface biotinylation, 3 × 107 cells were washed three times with ice-cold HBSS, resuspended in 300 μl of HBSS on ice, and biotinylated by adding sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate in three 10-min intervals to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. The reaction was terminated by washing the cells with stop medium (ice-cold CM containing 50 mm glycine but no β-mercaptoethanol) followed by incubation in the same medium for 30 min on ice. After two washes with ice-cold HBSS, surface-biotinylated cells were ready for further processing. The endosome-specific biotinylation protocol consists of two parts. First, endosomes and cell surface were biotinylated at 37 °C; second, surface-attached biotin was removed by the membrane-impermeant reducing agent GSH on ice. For the first part, 3 × 107 cells were washed three times with ice-cold HBSS and resuspended in 300 μl of pre-warmed (37 °C) HBSS containing 0.5 mg/ml biotinylation reagent. The suspension was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Endocytosis was terminated by addition of 20 ml of ice-cold stop medium, a brief spin, followed by a 30-min incubation with 20 ml of stop medium on ice and HBSS washes. In the second part, all steps were strictly done on ice. Cells were incubated twice for 30 min in 10 ml of ice-cold GSH buffer (10% fetal calf serum, 50 mm GSH, and 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.4) to remove surface biotin. The GSH buffer was prepared as described previously (5Lindner R. Traffic. 2002; 3: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). After washes with chilled 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm MgCl2 in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated for 10 min with 27 mm iodoacetamide in HBSS on ice, followed by one or two final washes with HBSS. The cells were then directly lysed for immunoprecipitation or processed for DRM isolation. The efficiency of the stripping procedure was checked by applying the stripping protocol to half of 6 × 107 surface-biotinylated cells. The other half remained untreated. The cells were then lysed with TBST (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.2) and protease inhibitors for 1 h on ice. From the cleared lysates, first invariant chain and then MHC II were immunoprecipitated as detailed below (sequential IP). Biotinylated polypeptides were detected by Western blotting against neutravidin-horseradish peroxidase and quantified by densitometry. Immunoprecipitation—Before IP, gradient fractions were diluted 1:2 in MB+ and lysed by addition of 60 mm β-octylglucoside overnight on ice. After a pre-clearing step with 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose, the samples were incubated with 5 μg/ml anti-Ak (40F) or with anti-invariant chain (In-1 and MAR 18.5, each 5 μg/ml) for 1 or 2 h on ice. The antibodies were adsorbed to 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose by slow rotation for 1 h at 4 °C. Washed beads were eluted with reducing SDS-sample buffer at 37 °C for 1 h to preserve SDS-stable MHC II (metabolic labeling experiments). For biotinylation and re-precipitation experiments, samples were eluted with non-reducing SDS sample buffer for 5 min at 95 °C. In re-precipitation experiments, the eluate was diluted 1:20 in TBST buffer plus protease inhibitors, followed by a second IP with mAbs In-1 and MAR 18.5 (first IP was with mAb 40F). For sequential IPs of biotinylated samples, the first IP was done with mAbs In-1 and MAR as described above. The supernatants of this first IP were pre-cleared and subjected to a second IP with mAb 40F. MHC II retrieved in this way was considered to represent peptide-loaded MHC II (peptide-free MHC II aggregates and is removed in the pre-clear steps). In some experiments, the supernatant of the second IP was again pre-cleared with protein A-Sepharose and then slowly rotated with 30 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C to retrieve all the remaining biotinylated proteins. After washes, the samples from the first two IPs were eluted with non-reducing SDS-sample buffer. The biotin retrieval samples were eluted with reducing SDS-sample buffer (5 min at 95 °C). Gel Electrophoresis, Blotting Procedures, and Quantification— Standard SDS gel electrophoresis was performed in mini gels containing 11 or 15% polyacrylamide. Samples from metabolic labeling experiments were electrophoresed in 9–11% polyacrylamide midi gels, incubated with En3Hance, and dried for autoradiography. For Western blotting, primary antibodies were used as recommended by the manufacturer or at 1 μg/ml. CTB was also used at 1 μg/ml and the anti-CTB antiserum at 1:1000 dilution. Secondary reagents were diluted according to the recommendations of the manufacturers. For dot-blotting, 3 μl of gradient fractions were spotted on nitrocellulose, air-dried, and subjected to the standard immunoblotting procedure. All blots were developed with ECL reagent and exposed to film. Suitable exposures were scanned and quantified using NIH Image. Iodination of HEL and Pulse-chase Uptake into M12.C3F6 —Detailed protocols have been published previously (45Lindner R. Unanue E.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6910-6920Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In brief, 125I-labeled HEL was prepared by denaturing 18 nmol of HEL in 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride without reduction and iodinating it with 3 mCi of 125I according to the chloramine-T procedure. The reaction was stopped by p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (final concentration, 10 mg/ml) and NaI (final concentration, 10 mm). Refolding was induced by rapid 10-fold dilution followed by desalting on a PD-10 column equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline. For loading Ak,5 × 107 M12.C3F6 cells were pulsed with 6 nmol of 125I-labeled HEL in 2 ml of CM for 10 min at 37 °C, washed three times with ice-cold HBSS and then re-cultured in CM at 37 °C for 2h. After several washes with HBSS, the cells were subjected to standard DRM isolation. From individual fractions, IPs were performed using mAb 40F. Electrophoretic separation was on 15% polyacrylamide gels that were subsequently dried and autoradiographed using BioMax MS film. Enzymatic Reactions—For detection of alkaline phosphatase, 50 μlof substrate containing 20 mmp-nitrophenylphosphate, 2 m diethanolamine, and 2.5 mm MgCl2, pH 9.8, were added to a 50-μl sample in a microtiter plate and incubated for 2–4 h at 37 °C. Color development was read at 404 nm in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. MHC II and Invariant Chain Partition to DRMs Independently of Tetraspanins—Current DRM isolation protocols based on mild detergents do not differentiate between DRMs and tetraspanin microdomains (27Vogt A.B. Spindeldreher S. Kropshofer H. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 189: 136-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 33Claas C. Stipp C.S. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7974-7984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). To solve this problem, we established a procedure based on Brij 98 extraction at 37 °C (29Drevot P.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1899-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and linear 0–40% sucrose flotation gradients containing the detergent throughout. A typical profile for the mouse B-cell line M12.C3F6 is depicted in Fig. 1. Profiles for human B-cell lines (Raji, T1.Ak) were very similar (data not shown). DRMs floated to fractions 8–14 as indicated by the distribution of the ganglioside GM1 and alkaline phosphatase, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein enriched in lipid rafts (22Sharma P.

Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). It is interesting that hardly any DRM marker was detected in the pellet, demonstrating that post-nuclear membranes were quantitatively detergent-extracted under our conditions. Membrane proteins with no preference for microdomains such as B7–2 (16Hiltbold E.M. Poloso N.J. Roche P.A. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 1329-"

Restriction enzyme digestion reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis identified three cDNAs encoding novel CEACAM1 N-domains. Comparative sequence analysis showed that human and rat CEACAM1 N-domains segregated into two groups differing in similarity to rat CEACAM1a-4L and human CEACAM1. Sequence variability analysis indicated that both human and rat N-domains possessed two variable regions, and one contained a major adhesive epitope. Recombination analysis showed that the group of rat but not human N-domains with high sequence similarity was derived at least in part by recombination. Binding assays revealed that three monoclonal antibodies with strong reactivity for the CEACAM1a-4L N-domain showed no reactivity with CEACAM1b-4S, an allele with a different N-domain sequence. CEACAM1b-4S displayed adhesive activity efficiently blocked by a synthetic peptide corresponding to the adhesive epitope in CEACAM1a-4L. Blocking analysis also showed that the adhesive epitope for rat CEACAM1 was located downstream from the equivalent human and mouse epitopes. Glycosylation analysis demonstrated O-linked sugars on rat CEACAM1b-4S from COS-1 cells. However, this was not the alteration responsible for the lack of monoclonal antibody reactivity. When considered together with previous studies, our findings suggest an inverse relationship between functionality and amino acid sequence similarity to CEACAM1. Like IgG, the N-domain of CEACAM1 appears to tolerate 10–15% sequence diversification without loss of function but begins to show either altered specificity or diminished functionality at higher levels.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3431-3435PubMed Google Scholar) produced a marked decrease or loss of tumorigenicity. Relatively recent studies have also shown that the ectodomain is not required for tumor suppression; the CEACAM1a-4L cyto domain is necessary and sufficient for inhibiting tumorigenicity (24Estrera V.T. Luo W. Phan D. Earley K. Hixson D.C. Lin S.-H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cell-cell adhesion, on the other hand, appears to be an activity that is mediated primarily by the N-terminal V-like domain (4Cheung P. Thompson N. Earley K. Culic O. Hixson D. Lin S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6139-6146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sippel C.J. Shen T. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol.

Because all of the CEACAM1 alleles and genes have unique N-domain sequences, it follows that these sequence variations may in turn produce changes in conformation that alter the adhesive properties of the N-terminal domain. This possibility is consistent with a recent report by Watt et al. (28Watt S.M. Teixeira A.M. Zhou G.Q. Doyonnas R. Zhang Y. Grunert F. Blumberg R.S. Kuroki M. Skubitz K.M. Bates P.A. Blood. 2001; 98: 1469-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) demonstrating that single amino acid mutations could alter monoclonal antibody (mAb) binding and cell-cell adhesion activity. Over the past 10 years, considerable insight has been gained into the effects that changes in amino acid sequence have on the structure, tumor suppression, or cell-cell adhesion activity of N-domains from human and mouse CEACAM1. Surprisingly, however, there have only been a few studies of this nature for rat CEACAM1. Sippel et al. (25Sippel C.J. Shen T. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33095-33104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), for example, demonstrated that mutation of Ser-503 abrogated CEACAM1a-mediated aggregation, whereas Estrera et al. (29Estrera V.T. Chen D.T. Luo W. Hixson D.C. Lin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15547-15553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) determined that phosphorylation of Ser-503 was essential for tumor suppression. To gain further insight into the characteristics and origin of Ceacam1 N-domains, we have utilized genomic PCR to search the rat genome for additional N-domain encoding sequences. By using this approach, we were successful in identifying three novel N-domains by their resistance to REs that cut the N-domains of Ceacam1a, -1b, and Ceacam10. These novel N-domains displayed only small differences in amino acid sequence when compared with Ceacam1a, -1b, and Ceacam10 N-domains. Moreover, the sequence differences were clustered into two locations, suggesting the presence of variable (V) regions similar to those seen in N-domains of the PSG family (30Kodelja V. Lucas K. Barnert S. von Kleist S. Thompson J.A. Zimmermann W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6906-6912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Computer analysis of rat Ceacam1 N-domains further revealed evidence for recombination events that were located within or adjacent to V regions. V regions were also found in the N-domains of human CEACAM1 genes with low sequence diversity, but in contrast to the rat, there was no evidence for recombination. Diversity without loss of function is a characteristic of variable V domains in antibody genes that is at the heart of the ability of the immune system to respond to mutations in infectious agents (31Lewis S.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 56: 27-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). N-domains for CEACAM1 family members appear to have retained this characteristic, and in a recent report by Watt et al. (28Watt S.M. Teixeira A.M. Zhou G.Q. Doyonnas R. Zhang Y. Grunert F. Blumberg R.S. Kuroki M. Skubitz K.M. Bates P.A. Blood. 2001; 98: 1469-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), there were only a few single site mutations capable of causing a major reduction in mAb binding and/or cell adhesion activity. Although small and naturally occurring changes in CEACAM1 amino acid sequence have not been investigated in any detail, it seemed likely that these differences would also result in changes in the structural and functional properties of CEACAM1 N-domains as based on previous studies by Lin and co-workers (4Cheung P. Thompson N. Earley K. Culic O. Hixson D. Lin S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6139-6146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Lin S.-H. Luo W. Earley K. Cheung P. Hixson D. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To determine the effects of naturally occurring differences in the amino acid sequences of the six most similar rat N-domains, we examined the reactivity of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with CEACAM1a-4L and CEACAM1b-4S N-domains, the two major N-domain variants in the rat. In three different assays, mAb 362.50 and 9.2 specific for N-domain epitopes in CEACAM1a showed no reactivity with CEACAM1b, suggesting the differences in amino acid sequence, although small, had a significant impact on epitope presentation. Epitope mapping by using peptide arrays defined two N-terminal and one C-terminal epitope that was recognized most strongly by mAb 9.2. Because mAb 362.50 reacted with peptide arrays spanning an epitope domain shared by CEACAM1a-4L and CEACAM1b-4L, these conformational effects did not appear to emanate directly from differences in primary sequence. Adhesion blocking assays showed that the C′ and G β-strands contained major and minor adhesive domains, respectively, the former of which shared sequence with a peptide that blocked human CEA adhesion (33Taheri M. Saragovi U. Fuks A. Makkerh J. Mort J. Stanners C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26935-26943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). mAb binding assays with peptide arrays spanning the C′ region from CEACAM1a-4L and CEACAM1b-4L showed that mAb 362.50 reacted equally well with both C′ peptide arrays despite the differences in primary sequence, thus suggesting that factors in addition to primary sequence were responsible for the lack of reactivity with CEACAM1b-4L. Taken together with previous studies, our results show that the small differences in the amino acid sequences of the CEACAM1a and 1b N-domains produce subtle differences in structure that alter mAb binding and adhesive interactions. Peptide Synthesis—The numbering of the peptides corresponds to the published amino acid sequences of CEACAM1a-4L (5Culic O. Huang Q.-H. Flanagan D. Hixson D. Lin S.-H. Biochem.

Peptides were synthesized and purified by high performance liquid chromatography, as described previously (34Liang T.C. Luo W. Hsieh J.T. Lin S.H. Arch. Biochem.

Peptides corresponding to residues 57–72 (9.2A, NLPQEFQVFYWYKGTT); 75–90 (9.2B, PDSEIARYIRSDNMSK), 75–88 (9.2B-1, PDSEIARYIRSDNM), 78–88 (9.2B-3, EIARYIRSDNM), 74–85 (8.0, NPDSEIARYIRS), 71–79 (L1, TTLNPDSEI), 82–90 (1.0, YIRSDNMSK), and 129–144 (9.2C, FNPIQTSVQFRVYPAL) were synthesized.

Fluorescence and electron microscopic analysis of cells labeled in suspension with these mAbs indicated that the reactive epitopes were located in the ectodomain of CEACAM1a-4L.

Indirect Immunofluorescence Analysis—At 24–48 h after transfection with Ceacam1a-4L or Ceacam1b-4S expression plasmids, COS-1 cultures growing in chamber slides were fixed in acetone and labeled by an indirect immunofluorescence protocol as described previously (36Mowery J. Hixson D. Hepatology. 1991; 13: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with pAb 669, a polyclonal antibody recognizing both CEACAM1a-4L and CEACAM1b-4S (38Baum O. Reutter W. Flanagan D.

Liver tissue was harvested from adult male ACI or Fischer F344 rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) as described previously (14Hixson D.C. McEntire K.D.

For flow cytometric analysis, cells in suspension were labeled by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) as described previously (40Hixson D.C. Brown J. McBride A.C. Affigne S. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 2000; 68: 152-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) by using phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. CEACAM1 expression levels were analyzed according to the manufacturer's protocol by using a Guava PC flow cytometer equipped with Guava Express software (Guava Technologies Inc., Hayward, CA). Data were presented as a graph of cell counts versus fluorescence intensity. Median and peak fluorescence values were determined using Guava Express software. Radiolabeling Procedures and Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Retrovirally transduced COS cells stably expressing either the gene for Ceacam1a-4L or Ceacam1b-4S were surface-labeled with 125I (carrierfree; Amersham Biosciences) by the lactoperoxidase:glucose oxidase procedure of Keski-Oja et al.

Immunoreactive components were boiled in 1× SDS sample buffer and resolved by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. Staining, destaining, drying of gels, and autoradiography were carried out as described by Hixson et al. (16Hixson D.C. McEntire K.D. Obrink B. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 5049-5058Google Scholar). Affinity Purification of CEACAM1 from Transfected Cells and Hepatocytes—pAb 669 was cross-linked to protein-A-agarose by a modified protocol of Schneider et al. (42Schneider C. Newman R.A. Sutherland D.R. Asser U. Greaves M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10766-10769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μl of pAb 669 was incubated with 100 μl (packed) of Affi-Gel protein-A agarose (Bio-Rad) suspended in PBS overnight at 4 °C with constant end-over-end mixing. Matrix was pelleted at 1,000 × g and washed sequentially with PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS and 0.2 m triethanolamine, pH 8.0. The IgG was cross-linked to the matrix using 50 mm dimethyl pimelimidate-2HCl (Pierce) in 0.2 m triethanolamine, pH 8.0, for 45 min with end-over-end mixing. After a 1-min centrifugation at 1,000 × g, the cross-linking solution was removed; the reaction was stopped by a 45-min incubation with 50 mm ethanolamine, pH 8.0, and the matrix was washed three times with 0.2 m triethanolamine and 0.5% Triton X-100 in 0.5 m NaCl. Prior to deglycosylation and immunoblot analysis, 5 × 105 transfected COS cells or 1 × 106 rat hepatocytes isolated by a collagenase perfusion technique described previously (36Mowery J. Hixson D. Hepatology. 1991; 13: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) were lysed in 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 detergent lysis buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, + 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing the protease inhibitor Pefabloc (Roche Applied Science) at a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and incubated at 4 °C for 2–4 h with end-over-end mixing in the presence of the pAb 669 cross-linked protein-A matrix. The matrix was pelleted by a 1-min centrifugation at 1,000 × g; unbound proteins in the supernatant were removed, and the matrix was washed sequentially with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS and 0.05 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 m NaCl. Matrix was then washed five times with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, to remove free chloride ions that inhibit the O-glycanase enzyme. Bound proteins were eluted from the cross-linked matrix with 500 μl of 50 mm diethylamine, pH 11.5, and neutralized to pH 7.4 with 0.5 m monobasic sodium phosphate. Proteins were acetone-precipitated in 3 volumes of ice-cold acetone in the presence of 5 μg of BSA as a carrier protein, pelleted at 18,750 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and resuspended in ∼100 μl of 0.1% SDS in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Analysis of Potential N- and O-Linked Glycosylation Sites in C1D1 and C2D1 Domains—Analysis of the D1 domains from CEACAM1a-4L and CEACAM1b-4S for potential O-glycosylation sites was performed according to the rules proposed by Pisano et al. (43Pisano A. Redmond J.W. Williams K.L. Gooley A.A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) or was carried out using the NetOGlyc 2.0 Prediction Server, a collection of artificial neural networks that recognize O-glycosylation sites based on sequence context and surface accessibility. Deglycosylation Procedures—Affinity-purified CEACAM1a-4L or CEACAM1b-4S and 1 μg of purified asialofetuin (Sigma) as a positive control for deglycosylation by O-glycanase were resuspended in 0.1% SDS solution and boiled for 5 min to denature the proteins. After boiling, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.6%. The denatured protein samples were separated into three microcentrifuge tubes and subjected to the following treatments: 1) incubation with buffer, 2) digestion with neuraminidase only (removal of sialic acid residues), and 3) sequential digestion with neuraminidase and O-glycanase. For neuraminidase digestion, proteins were incubated with 0.05 units of Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase (Sigma) in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30–60 min at 37 °C. Samples that were to be digested only with neuraminidase were diluted in 0.25 volume of 5× SDS sample buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 10% SDS, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 30% glycerol, pH 6.8) and boiled for 5 min. The remaining digested samples were incubated an additional 18 h at 37 °C with 0.5 units of O-glycanase (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA). Digestions were terminated by adding 0.25 volume of 5× SDS and boiling for 5 min. Aliquots (50 μl) from the glycosidase-digested samples or from detergent extracts of Sf9 cells expression deletion mutants (prepared as described previously and boiled in SDS sample buffer) were resolved by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE (44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207523) Google Scholar) on 7.5%, 0.75-mm slab gels at a constant voltage of 200 V. Transfer of proteins separated by SDS-PAGE onto nitrocellulose membrane filters (Schleicher & Schuell) was carried out as described (4Cheung P. Thompson N. Earley K. Culic O. Hixson"

A ΔhlyA mutation removing the complete 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase C-terminal domain prevents growth on Leu but not on lactose or other amino acids and, in agreement with the predicted enzyme function, leads to Leu-dependent accumulation of 3-methylglutaconic acid in the culture supernatant. These data represent a formal demonstration in vivo of the specific involvement of 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase in Leu catabolism. Type I 3-methylglutaconic aciduria patients deficient in 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase show urinary excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid and, in contrast to the other three types of methylglutaconic acidurias, 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid excretion. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed an accumulation of both diagnostic compounds in ΔhlyA culture supernatants, illustrating that the metabolic consequences of equivalent inborn errors of metabolism are conserved from fungi to humans. Using our fungal type I 3-methylglutaconic aciduria model, we show that metabolites accumulating in the deficient strain are toxic, although less so than those accumulating in a ΔmccB strain deficient for the upstream enzyme 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase. Diagnostic metabolite accumulation is Leu concentration-dependent, in agreement with the ability of Leu intake restriction to reduce the levels of offending metabolites.

McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 2125-2163Google Scholar). In humans, deficiency of this enzyme results in type I 3-methylglutaconic aciduria (MGA) 1The abbreviations used are: MGA, 3-methylglutaconic aciduria; 3-MG, 3-methylglutaconic acid; HL, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase; GC/MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; MCC, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase; 3-MG-CoA, 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA. (MIM 250950), a potentially pathogenic condition in which 3-methylglutaconic acid (3-MG), accumulating as a result of the metabolic block, is excreted in urine. However, urinary 3-MG excretion is a hallmark of three additional diseases: type II MGA (Barth syndrome (MIM 302060), resulting from a deficiency of a putative phospholipid acyltransferase) (2Barth P.G. Wanders R.J. Vreken P. Janssen E.A. Lam J. Baas F. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1999; 22: 555-567Google Scholar), type III MGA or Costeff optic atrophy syndrome (MIM 258501, a deficiency of a predicted mitochondrial protein) (3Anikster Y. Kleta R. Shaag A. Gahl W.A. Elpeleg O. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 1218-1224Google Scholar), and type IV MGA or “unspecified” MGA (MIM 250951, a heterogeneous class including patients for which all of the other three syndromes have been excluded) (1Sweetman L. Williams J.C. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Childs B. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 2125-2163Google Scholar). In contrast to type I MGA patients, type II, III, and IV MGA patients show abnormally elevated urinary excretion of 3-MG, but their 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA (3-MG-CoA) hydratase activity is normal. In addition to MGA patients, it has been shown that certain Smith-Lemli-Opitz patients also show abnormally increased plasma levels of 3-MG. This apparently complex scenario challenges our current understanding of the 3-MG-CoA metabolism. Remarkably, the characterization of the type II and III MGA genes gave no clues as to the biochemical mechanism underlying the abnormal accumulation of 3-MG, and it was not until the recent successful exploitation of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae model for type II MGA that direct evidence was obtained that tafazzin (the deficient protein in type II MGA) is involved in cardiolipin metabolism (4Vaz F.M. Houtkooper R.H. Valianpour F. Barth P.G. Wanders R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43089-43094Google Scholar), illustrating the usefulness of microbial eukaryotic models. Aspergillus nidulans is a filamentous fungus sharing with S. cerevisiae those features that make microbial eukaryotic models so valuable: a compact, haploid genome whose complete 31-Mb sequence is available, 2Available on the World Wide Web at www.genome.wi.mit.edu. relatively easy gene inactivation procedures by homologous recombination/gene replacement, meiotic recombination, and small average intron size (less than 100 bp). A. nidulans grows in a chemically defined medium containing inorganic salts and sole nitrogen and carbon sources which can be changed as appropriate (see below). In contrast to budding yeast, however, A. nidulans has a much broader metabolic versatility. For example, A. nidulans is able to use most amino acids as sole carbon sources using metabolic pathways remarkably similar to those of human hepatocytes (5Peñalva M.A. Fungal Genet. Biol. 2001; 34: 1-10Google Scholar), a feature that we have exploited for designing fungal models for homogentisate dioxygenase (6Fernández-Cañón J.M. Peñalva M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21199-21205Google Scholar), fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (7Fernández-Cañón J.M. Peñalva M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These models have been instrumental for the identification of the human genes involved in alkaptonuria (6Fernández-Cañón J.M. Peñalva M.A. J. Biol.

The use of A. nidulans models for Leu metabolism deficiencies is particularly advantageous (9Rodríguez J.M. Rúíz-Sala P. Ugarte M. Peñalva M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4578-4587Google Scholar). Leu is a ketogenic amino acid in humans/mammals which is catabolized to acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate (Fig. 1a). In contrast, fungi can convert acetyl-CoA into carbohydrates through the glyoxylate bypass of the Krebs cycle (13Armitt S. Roberts C.F. Kornberg H.L. FEBS Lett. 1970; 7: 231-234Google Scholar, 14Armitt S. Roberts C.F. Kornberg H.L. FEBS Lett. 1971; 12: 276-278Google Scholar, 15Kornberg H.L. Biochem. J. 1966; 99: 1-11Google Scholar). Therefore, A. nidulans grows on Leu as the sole carbon source, enabling the use of simple growth tests to determine whether mutations impair this catabolic pathway. When this work was started, the gene encoding 3-MG-CoA hydratase had not been characterized in any organism. Here we use an in silico approach to identify the A. nidulans and human genes encoding this enzyme. As two recent papers reported the identification of the human gene and the characterization of loss-of-function mutations in type I MGA patients (16Nga Ly T.B. Peters V. Gibson K.M. Liesert M. Buckel W. Wilcken B. Carpenter K. Ensenauer R. Hoffmann G.F. Mack M. Zschocke J. Hum. Mutat. 2003; 21: 401-407Google Scholar, 17Ijlst L. Loupatty F.J. Ruiter J.P. Duran M. Lehnert W. Wanders R.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 1463-1466Google Scholar), we focus this paper on the construction and physiological characterization of a fungal metabolic model for the disease. We provide here formal genetic evidence that 3-MG-CoA hydratase catalyzes in vivo one step in the Leu catabolic pathway shown in Fig. 1, and additionally, we demonstrate using epistasy tests that 3-MG can be synthesized without involvement of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, a finding that may have implications in our understanding of the biochemical basis of those MGA types in which 3-MG-CoA hydratase is normal. Our data additionally suggest interplay between mitochondria and peroxisomes in the late steps of A. nidulans Leu catabolism. Fungal Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions—A. nidulans strains carried markers in standard use (18Clutterbuck A.J. O'Brien S.J. Genetic Maps: Locus Maps of Complex Genomes. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 3.71-3.84Google Scholar). Complete and minimal medium were as in Ref. 19Cove D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 113: 51-56Google Scholar. Lactose was used at 0.05% (w/v) as the sole carbon source and amino acids at 30 mm, unless otherwise indicated. A ΔmccB ΔhlyA double mutant was constructed by crossing two parental strains of the complete genotype biA1 argB2 methG1 (ΔhlyA::argB+) and yA2 pabaA1 pyrG89 argB2 riboB2 (ΔmccB::pyr-4), respectively. argB+ progeny carrying the mutant hlyA allele were selected and analyzed by Southern for the presence of the ΔmccB allele, using a probe specific for Neuropora crassa pyr-4. Six of thirteen analyzed strains were shown to be double mutants. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis and Transformation— These were carried out as described (9Rodríguez J.M. Rúíz-Sala P. Ugarte M. Peñalva M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4578-4587Google Scholar). Mycelia for RNA isolation were pre-grown in glucose minimal medium and transferred to media with the indicated carbon sources. A cDNA library from mycelia grown under Leu catabolism-inducing conditions has been described. In Northern blots, a PCR cDNA fragment from positions 168 to 2053 of GenBank™ accession no. AY484417 was used as a hlyA-specific probe. MAD003 biA1 argB2 methG1 was used as the recipient strain in transformation experiments (20Tilburn J. Scazzocchio C. Taylor G.G. Zabicky-Zissman J.H. Lockington R.A. Davies R.W. Gene. 1983; 26: 205-211Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis with argB- and hlyA-specific probes was used to confirm the expected hlyA truncation/deletion event. GC/MS Analysis of Culture Supernatants—Fungal mycelia were precultured as described for RNA isolation and transferred to minimal medium with one of the following carbon sources: 0.05% (w/v) lactose, 3 or 10 mm Leu. Secondary cultures were incubated for an additional 21 h. Culture supernatants were collected after removing mycelia by filtration. Organic acids were extracted, derivatized, and analyzed by GC/MS as described (9Rodríguez J.M. Rúíz-Sala P. Ugarte M. Peñalva M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4578-4587Google Scholar). In Silico Identification of an A. nidulans Gene Encoding 3-Methylglutaconyl-CoA Hydratase—We predicted that 3-MG-CoA hydratase would belong to the enoyl-CoA hydratase/isomerase enzyme family, whose members share less than 20% amino acid sequence identity. Northern blot analysis failed to identify a putative Leu-regulated, candidate gene within or in the proximity of the mccA-ivdA-mccB leucine catabolic gene cluster (9Rodríguez J.M. Rúíz-Sala P. Ugarte M. Peñalva M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4578-4587Google Scholar), which led us to use two complementary strategies to identify the A. nidulans 3-MG-CoA hydratase gene. We first searched the genomes of metabolically versatile soil bacteria for Leu degradation operons, using the amino acid sequences of A. nidulans MCCα, MCCβ, and isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (see Fig. 1) as in silico probes in TBLASTN searches.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5479-5490Google Scholar) have, within 6.5 kb regions of their genomes, genes predictably encoding the above three proteins. We found that M. tuberculosis, P. aeruginosa, and A. tumefaciens (GenBank™ genome accession nos. NC_002755, NC_002516, and NC_003063, respectively) contain putative enoyl-CoA hydratases within these operons (see examples in Fig. 1b). Sequence alignments revealed that whereas the amino acid sequence identity between P. aeruginosa and M. tuberculosis Leu metabolism proteins ranged between 47% (in the case of isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IVD)) and 68% (in the case of MCCβ), enoyl-CoA hydratase candidates to 3-MG-CoA hydratase were only 33% identical, which illustrates the relatively low conservation of this family of proteins. Secondly, we hypothesized that the 3-MG-CoA hydratase gene might be physically linked to the A. nidulans gene encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (HL), catalyzing the last step in the pathway (Fig. 1a). We used the amino acid sequence of human HL (GenBank™ accession no. P35914) to identify its A. nidulans orthologues using TBLASTN; two were found. The one showing the highest score was mapped on chromosome V. Next, we used the deduced amino acid sequence of the putative P. aeruginosa 3-MG-CoA hydratase (AAG05401) in a TBLASTN search of the A. nidulans genome, which revealed a large number of putative genes for enoyl-CoA hydratases. However, the highest score (expect 2e–16) was obtained for a polypeptide encoded by a region adjacent to that encoding chromosome V HL. This open reading frame was a convincing candidate to encode A. nidulans 3-MG-CoA hydratase. Molecular Characterization of A. nidulans hlyA—Inspection of the genomic sequence in this region of chromosome V showed that the HL coding sequence was located immediately up-stream of that encoding the candidate 3-MG-CoA hydratase. Notably, no stop codons separating these open reading frames were found, strongly indicating that a single gene encodes a bifunctional polypeptide carrying an N-terminal HL domain and a C-terminal 3-MG-CoA hydratase domain (Fig. 2). PCR amplification using cDNA as the template (data not shown) demonstrated the existence of transcripts encoding both domains. Sequencing of a full-length cDNA clone confirmed the existence of a single open reading frame encoding a 599-residue polypeptide that included the two domains. The length of this cDNA clone (1841 bp without the poly(A) tail) agrees with the deduced size of the transcriptional unit as determined by Northern blot hybridization (Fig. 3), which additionally gave no indication of the existence of smaller transcripts. Comparison to the genomic DNA sequence revealed that the corresponding gene, which we denoted hlyA (hydratase-lyase), is split by a short, 68-bp intron. We conclude that hlyA encodes a bifunctional polypeptide catalyzing the two final steps in the Leu degradation pathway.Fig. 3Northern analysis of hlyA. Mycelia were grown in minimal medium with 0.3% (w/v) glucose as the sole carbon source for 16 h at 37 °C and transferred to media with the indicated carbon sources, where amino acids were used at 30 mm, glucose (Gluc) at 1% (w/v), Tween at 0.1% (v/v), and acetate (AcH) at 100 mm. After a 3-h additional incubation of these secondary cultures, mycelia were harvested and used to isolate RNA, which was analyzed by Northern blotting by using a hlyA-specific probe (upper panel). Lower panel, ethidium bromide staining of the gel to confirm approximately equal loading of RNA in the different tracks.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although the amino acid sequence of the HL domain including residues 1 through 302 shows 48% identity to human HL (Fig. 2), the closest homologue of the predicted C-terminal 3-MG-CoA hydratase domain including residues 320–599 was the putative P. aeruginosa 3-MG-CoA hydratase (29% amino acid sequence identity). The C-terminal HlyA 597-Ala-Lys-Val-599 tripeptide matches the peroxisome C-terminal targeting signal consensus (Prosite Databank accession no. PS00342) (25Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Hosken N. Wilkinson J. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1657-1664Google Scholar). No mitochondrial signal peptide was evident in the N-terminal region of the protein. Northern blots (Fig. 3) demonstrated that hlyA transcription is induced by Leu and repressed by glucose. Of note, neither the branched chain amino acid Ile nor the aromatic amino acid Phe, which induce transcription of genes encoding the up-stream enzymes IVD and MCC to the same extent as Leu, had any significant effect upon hlyA transcription, indicating that the transcriptional regulation of hlyA differs from that of the ivdA, mccA, and mccB genes in the chromosome III Leu catabolic cluster (9Rodríguez J.M. Rúíz-Sala P. Ugarte M. Peñalva M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4578-4587Google Scholar). Acetate, another gluconeogenic carbon source, had no inducing effect. The hlyA transcriptional pattern is as expected for a gene playing a specific role in Leu, but not in Ile or Phe catabolism. Although we note that deletion of mccB does not prevent induction, additional data precluded the conclusion that the inducer is a pathway metabolite located upstream of the MCC-catalyzed step (see below). The molecular basis of hlyA induction has not been investigated further. A Truncation/Deletion Mutation Demonstrates the Specific Involvement of hlyA in Leu Catabolism—To demonstrate the physiological involvement of hlyA in Leu catabolism, we constructed a deletion/truncation allele by transformation with a linear DNA fragment in which 823 bp corresponding to hlyA codons 83–333 (including an intron) and 1235 bp corresponding to the hlyA 3′-UTR were flanking a genomic DNA insert containing the A. nidulans argB+ gene (Fig. 4). Site-directed integration of this fragment mediated by a double cross-over event results in a mutant hlyA in which the coding region is truncated after residue 333. In this mutant, the sequence encoding the C-terminal 3-MG-CoA hydratase domain (codons 334–599 of HlyA) is replaced by the A. nidulans DNA insert containing argB+ (Fig. 4). An argB2 arginine-requiring strain was transformed with this fragment, and arginine-independent clones were selected and purified. About 10% of the transformants were unable to grow on Leu as the sole carbon source. Three such transformants were analyzed by Southern hybridization using argB- and hlyA-specific probes and were shown to carry the truncation/deletion mutation shown in Fig. 4, denoted ΔhlyA. All three transformants were found to be phenotypically indistinguishable and unable to grow on Leu. Therefore, one was chosen for further characterization. Northern blot analysis of this strain confirmed the absence of full-length message and the presence of a truncated message terminating within the argB+-containing DNA insert and including the region coding for the N-terminal HL domain (Fig. 3, compare lanes 3 and 7; Fig. 4). Although ΔhlyA prevents growth on Leu (Fig. 5), the mutation has no effect upon the ability of the fungus to use other branched chain amino acids (Ile, Val), Pro, Thr, or lactose as the sole carbon source (data not shown). As shown below, this ΔhlyA strain accumulates 3-MG when challenged with Leu, strongly indicating that the truncation/deletion mutation results in the specific impairment of 3-MG-CoA hydratase activity. Taken together, these data formally demonstrate the physiological, specific involvement of hlyA in Leu catabolism. Biochemical Characterization of ΔhlyA: a Fungal Model for 3-Methylglutaconyl-CoA Hydratase Deficiency—To establish that the ΔhlyA mutation blocks Leu catabolism at the level of 3-MG, we used GC/MS analysis of culture supernatants (9Rodríguez J.M. Rúíz-Sala P. Ugarte M. Peñalva M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4578-4587Google Scholar). Mycelia of the wild-type and ΔhlyA strains were pre-cultured on glucose minimal medium and transferred to fresh minimal medium containing either lactose (at 0.05% (w/v)) or Leu (at 3 or 10 mm) as sole carbon source. Organic acids in supernatants of these secondary cultures were extracted and analyzed by GC/MS. Fig. 6a and b show that the metabolic profiles of the wild type and ΔhlyA strains are virtually indistinguishable upon transfer to lactose minimal medium. In contrast, the mutant specifically accumulated the E (trans) and Z (cis) isomers of 3-MG upon transfer to 3 mm leucine minimal medium (Fig. 6, c and d). 3-MG in the mutant culture supernatant derives from 3-MG-CoA, the substrate of 3-MG-CoA hydratase. The specific accumulation in the mutant culture supernatant of 3-MG was markedly more prominent upon transfer of 10 mm Leu minimal medium (Fig. 6, e and f; see E and Z), demonstrating that it is Leu-dependent. Both the wild-type and the mutant supernatants showed an accumulation of 2-hydroxyisocaproic acid resulting from Leu transamination. We have previously shown that branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase is limiting under these growth conditions (9Rodríguez J.M. Rúíz-Sala P. Ugarte M. Peñalva M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4578-4587Google Scholar). In addition to 3-MG, we noted that the mutant also accumulated 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid (3-HIVA) resulting from the reversibility of the pathway to 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA and hydration (see Fig. 1; Ref. 1Sweetman L. Williams J.C. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Childs B. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 2125-2163Google Scholar). This is in marked similarity to human type I MGA patients, whose urine GC/MS analysis shows, in addition to the E and Z isomers of 3-MG, a significant amount of 3-HIVA. Indeed, the presence in urine of 3-HIVA in addition to 3-MG is a diagnostic feature of type I MGA patients which helps to differentiate them from the three other MGA types (see “Discussion”). Therefore, these data additionally illustrate the remarkably similar consequences of equivalent enzyme deficiencies in humans and fungi, giving credence to our metabolic model. Identification of the Human Gene Homologue: Mutation Screen—The Human Genome databases were screened for candidate homologues using the HlyA amino acid sequence in TBLASTN searches. Relatively low sequence conservation among enoyl-CoA hydratases precluded the unambiguous identification of candidate genes but allowed our selection of two strong candidates, the 5-exon FLJ20909 gene and the 10-exon AUH gene. AUH encodes an RNA-binding protein with an enoyl-CoA hydratase domain. We screened these candidate genes in two type I MGA-affected brothers and detected a C589T (R197stop) truncating mutation in AUH. During our screen, Ijlst et al. (17Ijlst L. Loupatty F.J. Ruiter J.P. Duran M. Lehnert W. Wanders R.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 1463-1466Google Scholar) reported that AUH was the human 3-MG-CoA hydratase gene and the presence of the R197stop mutation in the same probands that we genotyped. This and a second report (16Nga Ly T.B. Peters V. Gibson K.M. Liesert M. Buckel W. Wilcken B. Carpenter K. Ensenauer R. Hoffmann G.F. Mack M. Zschocke J. Hum. Mutat. 2003; 21: 401-407Google Scholar) (also including these siblings in the analysis) describe a total of five causative mutations in this gene, unambiguously demonstrating that type I MGA results from loss-of-function mutations in AUH. Metabolites Accumulating in a Strain Deficient for 3-MG-CoA Hydratase Are Toxic, Although Less so than in a Strain Deficient in MCC—Only 11 type I MGA patients have been described in the literature (16Nga Ly T.B. Peters V. Gibson K.M. Liesert M. Buckel W. Wilcken B. Carpenter K. Ensenauer R. Hoffmann G.F. Mack M. Zschocke J. Hum. Mutat. 2003; 21: 401-407Google Scholar) (which, in passing, explains why the two siblings described by Duran et al. in Ref. 26Duran M. Beemer F.A. Tibosch A.S. Bruinvis L. Ketting D. Wadman S.K. J. Pediatr. 1982; 101: 551-554Google Scholar have been genotyped by three different groups; see above). The disorder presents as a neurometabolic disease with marked clinical heterogeneity. Thus, whereas some patients suffer from severe psychomotor impairment, in others, clinical manifestations are limited to delayed speech development. This suggests that some affected individuals having the biochemical phenotype might not come to clinical attention because of their (nearly) asymptomatic clinical phenotype and that the metabolites accumulating as a result of the type I MGA metabolic block are less toxic than in other metabolic disorders. We used our fungal model to test the possibility that Leu metabolites accumulating as a result of the enzyme deficiency are toxic. Fig. 5 shows that whereas growth of the wild-type and ΔhlyA strains is virtually indistinguishable when lactose was the sole carbon source, growth of the mutant but not of the wild type is markedly inhibited on lactose plus Leu, indicating the formation of toxic metabolites from Leu as a result of the metabolic block. Of note, Fig. 5 shows that the inhibition caused by Leu metabolites in the strain deficient in 3-MG-CoA hydratase (Fig. 5, lactose plus Leu) is markedly less pronounced than that resulting from MCC deficiency (9Rodríguez J.M. Rúíz-Sala P. Ugarte M. Peñalva M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4578-4587Google Scholar), strongly indicating that the metabolites accumulating in the former are less toxic to the cells.
