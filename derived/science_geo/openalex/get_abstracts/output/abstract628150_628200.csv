https://openalex.org/W2916020270,"Mammalian organogenesis is a remarkable process. Within a short timeframe, the cells of the three germ layers transform into an embryo that includes most of the major internal and external organs. Here we investigate the transcriptional dynamics of mouse organogenesis at single-cell resolution. Using single-cell combinatorial indexing, we profiled the transcriptomes of around 2 million cells derived from 61 embryos staged between 9.5 and 13.5 days of gestation, in a single experiment. The resulting ‘mouse organogenesis cell atlas’ (MOCA) provides a global view of developmental processes during this critical window. We use Monocle 3 to identify hundreds of cell types and 56 trajectories, many of which are detected only because of the depth of cellular coverage, and collectively define thousands of corresponding marker genes. We explore the dynamics of gene expression within cell types and trajectories over time, including focused analyses of the apical ectodermal ridge, limb mesenchyme and skeletal muscle. Data from single-cell combinatorial-indexing RNA-sequencing analysis of 2 million cells from mouse embryos between embryonic days 9.5 and 13.5 are compiled in a cell atlas of mouse organogenesis, which provides a global view of developmental processes occurring during this critical period."
https://openalex.org/W2912272542,"Across the animal kingdom, gastrulation represents a key developmental event during which embryonic pluripotent cells diversify into lineage-specific precursors that will generate the adult organism. Here we report the transcriptional profiles of 116,312 single cells from mouse embryos collected at nine sequential time points ranging from 6.5 to 8.5 days post-fertilization. We construct a molecular map of cellular differentiation from pluripotency towards all major embryonic lineages, and explore the complex events involved in the convergence of visceral and primitive streak-derived endoderm. Furthermore, we use single-cell profiling to show that Tal1-/- chimeric embryos display defects in early mesoderm diversification, and we thus demonstrate how combining temporal and transcriptional information can illuminate gene function. Together, this comprehensive delineation of mammalian cell differentiation trajectories in vivo represents a baseline for understanding the effects of gene mutations during development, as well as a roadmap for the optimization of in vitro differentiation protocols for regenerative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2917815849,Cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) have central roles in bacterial homeostasis and virulence by acting as nucleotide second messengers. Bacterial CDNs also elicit immune responses during infection when they are detected by pattern-recognition receptors in animal cells. Here we perform a systematic biochemical screen for bacterial signalling nucleotides and discover a large family of cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferases (CD-NTases) that use both purine and pyrimidine nucleotides to synthesize a diverse range of CDNs. A series of crystal structures establish CD-NTases as a structurally conserved family and reveal key contacts in the enzyme active-site lid that direct purine or pyrimidine selection. CD-NTase products are not restricted to CDNs and also include an unexpected class of cyclic trinucleotide compounds. Biochemical and cellular analyses of CD-NTase signalling nucleotides demonstrate that these cyclic di- and trinucleotides activate distinct host receptors and thus may modulate the interaction of both pathogens and commensal microbiota with their animal and plant hosts. A bacterial family of cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferases synthesizes a diverse range of cyclic dinucleotide and trinucleotide compounds that are likely to modulate the interaction of both pathogens and commensal microbiota with their animal and plant hosts.

https://openalex.org/W3099427617,"The atomic nucleus is made of protons and neutrons (nucleons), which are themselves composed of quarks and gluons. Understanding how the quark–gluon structure of a nucleon bound in an atomic nucleus is modified by the surrounding nucleons is an outstanding challenge. Although evidence for such modification—known as the EMC effect—was first observed over 35 years ago, there is still no generally accepted explanation for its cause1,2,3. Recent observations suggest that the EMC effect is related to close-proximity short-range correlated (SRC) nucleon pairs in nuclei4,5. Here we report simultaneous, high-precision measurements of the EMC effect and SRC abundances. We show that EMC data can be explained by a universal modification of the structure of nucleons in neutron–proton SRC pairs and present a data-driven extraction of the corresponding universal modification function. This implies that in heavier nuclei with many more neutrons than protons, each proton is more likely than each neutron to belong to an SRC pair and hence to have distorted quark structure. This universal modification function will be useful for determining the structure of the free neutron and thereby testing quantum chromodynamics symmetry-breaking mechanisms and may help to discriminate between nuclear physics effects and beyond-the-standard-model effects in neutrino experiments."

https://openalex.org/W2915806676,"Objective To analyze the relationships between illness uncertainty, social support, and coping mode in hospitalized patients with systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods The General Health Questionnaire, Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale, Social Support Rating Scale, and Medical Coping Modes Questionnaire were to the hospitalized patients with SLE (N = 200) in a tertiary hospital in Shaanxi. Results The hospitalized patients with SLE showed a moderate level of illness uncertainty. Furthermore, illness uncertainty was negatively correlated with support availability (r = -0.161, P = 0.023) and facing coping mode (r = -0.231, P = 0.001), and was positively correlated with the yielding coping mode (r = 0.249, P < 0.001). Conclusion These findings suggest that support availability and coping modes were associated with moderate level of illness uncertainty, indicating that support availability support should be strengthened in hospitalized patients to actively face their disease. This subsequently improves their treatment compliance and quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W2916431834,"The expansion of brain size is accompanied by a relative enlargement of the subventricular zone during development. Epithelial-like neural stem cells divide in the ventricular zone at the ventricles of the embryonic brain, self-renew and generate basal progenitors1 that delaminate and settle in the subventricular zone in enlarged brain regions2. The length of time that cells stay in the subventricular zone is essential for controlling further amplification and fate determination. Here we show that the interphase centrosome protein AKNA has a key role in this process. AKNA localizes at the subdistal appendages of the mother centriole in specific subtypes of neural stem cells, and in almost all basal progenitors. This protein is necessary and sufficient to organize centrosomal microtubules, and promote their nucleation and growth. These features of AKNA are important for mediating the delamination process in the formation of the subventricular zone. Moreover, AKNA regulates the exit from the subventricular zone, which reveals the pivotal role of centrosomal microtubule organization in enabling cells to both enter and remain in the subventricular zone. The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition is also regulated by AKNA in other epithelial cells, demonstrating its general importance for the control of cell delamination. The interphase centrosome protein AKNA is necessary and sufficient for the organization of centrosomal microtubules, mediates delamination in the formation of the subventricular zone and regulates exit from this zone."
https://openalex.org/W2917102319,"Sensory experience in early postnatal life, during so-called critical periods, restructures neural circuitry to enhance information processing1. Why the cortex is susceptible to sensory instruction in early life and why this susceptibility wanes with age are unclear. Here we define a developmentally restricted engagement of inhibitory circuitry that shapes localized dendritic activity and is needed for vision to drive the emergence of binocular visual responses in the mouse primary visual cortex. We find that at the peak of the critical period for binocular plasticity, acetylcholine released from the basal forebrain during periods of heightened arousal directly excites somatostatin (SST)-expressing interneurons. Their inhibition of pyramidal cell dendrites and of fast-spiking, parvalbumin-expressing interneurons enhances branch-specific dendritic responses and somatic spike rates within pyramidal cells. By adulthood, this cholinergic sensitivity is lost, and compartmentalized dendritic responses are absent but can be re-instated by optogenetic activation of SST cells. Conversely, suppressing SST cell activity during the critical period prevents the normal development of binocular receptive fields by impairing the maturation of ipsilateral eye inputs. This transient cholinergic modulation of SST cells, therefore, seems to orchestrate two features of neural plasticity-somatic disinhibition and compartmentalized dendritic spiking. Loss of this modulation may contribute to critical period closure."
https://openalex.org/W2917567846,"Genomic instability can trigger cellular responses that include checkpoint activation, senescence and inflammation1,2. Although genomic instability has been extensively studied in cell culture and cancer paradigms, little is known about its effect during embryonic development, a period of rapid cellular proliferation. Here we report that mutations in the heterohexameric minichromosome maintenance complex-the DNA replicative helicase comprising MCM2 to MCM73,4-that cause genomic instability render female mouse embryos markedly more susceptible than males to embryonic lethality. This bias was not attributable to X chromosome-inactivation defects, differential replication licensing or X versus Y chromosome size, but rather to 'maleness'-XX embryos could be rescued by transgene-mediated sex reversal or testosterone administration. The ability of exogenous or endogenous testosterone to protect embryos was related to its anti-inflammatory properties5. Ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, rescued female embryos that contained mutations in not only the Mcm genes but also the Fancm gene; similar to MCM mutants, Fancm mutant embryos have increased levels of genomic instability (measured as the number of cells with micronuclei) from compromised replication fork repair6. In addition, deficiency in the anti-inflammatory IL10 receptor was synthetically lethal with the Mcm4Chaos3 helicase mutant. Our experiments indicate that, during development, DNA damage associated with DNA replication induces inflammation that is preferentially lethal to female embryos, because male embryos are protected by high levels of intrinsic testosterone."

Bcl2-2345 and Bcl2-1245 are two major G4 species forming with high thermal stability and distinct topologies in the Pu39 region, but their folding/unfolding kinetics have not yet been investigated. Here, we used magnetic tweezers to measure the mechanical stability and the folding/unfolding kinetics of the Bcl2-2345 and Bcl2-1245 G4 structures. We report that the hybrid-stranded Bcl2-2345 G4 had a lower mechanical stability than the parallel-stranded Bcl2-1245 G4. We observed that the Bcl2-2345 G4 is a kinetically favored structure, whereas the Bcl2-1245 G4, with a slow unfolding rate, may function as a kinetic barrier for transcription. We also determined that in addition to the Bcl2-2345 and Bcl2-1245 G4s, other stable DNA secondary structures, such as a hybrid-stranded Bcl2-1234 G4, can also form in the Pu39 sequence.

The human BCL-2 gene has two promoters, P1 and P2. P1 is a GC-rich promoter that is responsible for the majority of the BCL-2 gene expression. A 39-bp GC-rich sequence (Pu39), located 58–19 bp upstream of the P1 promoter, can form four-stranded DNA structures called G-quadruplexes (G4s) 2The abbreviations used are: G4G-quadruplexssDNAsingle-stranded DNAntnucleotidespNpiconewtonsDMSdimethyl sulfate.

The Pu39 sequence of BCL-2 contains six guanine tracts (3–5 consecutive guanines) and has the potential to form multiple G4 structures with 15 possible combinations from these different G-tracts (Fig. 1A and Table S1).

Later, dimethyl sulfate (DMS) footprinting experiments indicated that the G4s from the full-length Pu39 sequence formed in K+ involved the G-tracts 1, 2, 4, and 5 and was named Bcl2-1245 G4 (10Agrawal P.

Different topologies, such as hybrid and parallel-stranded topologies of the Bcl2-2345 and Bcl2-1245 G4 structures, provided structural differences for being recognized by transcription factors and for designing drugs targeting a specific G4 structure (13Amato J.

In addition, both the Bcl2-2345 and Bcl2-1245 G4s contain a long middle loop, 7 and 13 nt in length, respectively, which provides another region for specific recognition. A recent study showed that a 7-mer peptide nucleic acid (PNA) that binds to the 7-nt loop region of Bcl2-2345 increased the formation of Bcl2-2345 G4 and reduced the expression of the BCL-2 gene in cancer cells, which indicates that the Bcl2-2345 G4 structure is a potent target for modulating BCL-2 gene expression (14Falanga A.P.

To understand the biological roles of promoter G4s, the characterization of the stability and folding/unfolding kinetics of different G4 species is necessary. Both Bcl2-2345 and Bcl2-1245 G4s demonstrate high thermodynamic stability in which the melting temperatures of Bcl2-2345 and Bcl2-1245 G4s in ∼100 mm K+ solution were determined to be ∼75 and ∼71 °C, respectively (9Dai J.

However, the kinetics of the Bcl2-2345 and Bcl2-1245 G4s remain unclear because G4 structures with distinct folding/unfolding kinetics may have similar melting temperatures. The folding/unfolding kinetics of G4s determine the possible participation of G4s during transcription and are also crucial for designing small molecules targeting Bcl2-2345 and Bcl2-1245 G4s.

It is unclear whether these structures correspond to Bcl2-2345 and Bcl2-1245 G4s or other stable G-rich secondary structures.

By comparing with the data obtained from the Pu39 sequence, we also probed the potential existence of other stable G4 structures.

The small positive peak at ∼290 nm of Bcl2-2345 indicates the formation of a mixed parallel/antiparallel-stranded G4 structure, which agrees with previous studies (9Dai J. Dexheimer T.S. Chen D.

The CD spectrum of the Pu39 sequence is similar to the Bcl2-2345, suggesting that mixed secondary structures are formed in this sequence.

A single-stranded G4-forming DNA sequence spanned between two duplex DNA handles is tethered between a coverslip and a streptavidin-coated paramagnetic bead.

To obtain the unfolding kinetics, we used the force-ramp measurements, where the force increased linearly with time (i.e. constant loading rate) by changing the magnet–bead distance through a programmed trajectory (19You H.

Fig. 2B shows typical force–bead height curves of the Bcl2-2345 sequence, and these curves were obtained by repeating the stretching cycles in the presence of 100 mm KCl. The DNA molecule was held at a low force of 1 pN for 90 s to allow refolding, and then the force was increased to ∼60 pN at a loading rate of 2 pN/s for the Bcl2-2345 sequence. The unfolding transition of the G4 was observed from a sudden extension jump in the bead height curve (indicated by an arrow in Fig. 2B), and the unfolding force was measured at the transition. After reaching ∼60 pN, the force was jumped to 1 pN to allow the refolding of the G4s. After refolding, the procedure was repeated. Fig. 2 (C and D) shows the unfolding force distribution of the Bcl2-2345 G4 obtained by repeating the force-ramp cycles in 100 mm KCl (n = 352) and 150 mm KCl (n = 167), respectively. At each condition, the data were obtained from more than 10 independent tethers. The unfolding force distribution of the Bcl2-2345 G4 shows a single peak at 21 ± 7 pN (average ± S.D.) in 100 mm KCl and at 19 ± 5 pN in 150 mm KCl. The unfolding rate of the Bcl2-2345 G4 was obtained by fitting the unfolding force distribution (Fig. 2, C and D) with Bell's model as follows, p(f)=kurexp((ΔxufkBT+kBTkuΔxur(1−exp((ΔxufkBT)))(Eq. 1) where r represents the loading rate, ku is the zero-force unfolding rate, Δxu is the transition distance from the folded state to the transition state, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The best-fitting parameters for the Bcl2-2345 G4 were ku = (1.2 ± 0.4) × 10−2 s−1 and Δxu = 0.6 ± 0.1 nm in 100 mm KCl and ku = (1.0 ± 0.4) × 10−2 s−1 and Δxu = 0.7 ± 0.1 nm in 150 mm KCl (average ± S.E.). The unfolding step size distribution of Bcl2-2345 revealed a single peak at 23 ± 3 nt in 100 mm KCl (dotted line) and 23 ± 2 nt in 150 mm KCl (solid line) (average ± S.D.), which is consistent with the number of nucleotides in the Bcl2-2345 G4 structure (Fig. 2E) (9Dai J.

Both unfolding forces and unfolding step sizes of Bcl2-2345 showed similar distributions in 100 and 150 mm KCl, suggesting that the potassium concentration has only minor effects on the unfolding kinetics of Bcl2-2345. The refolding kinetics of the G4s were quantified based on measuring the time evolution of the refolding probability. More specifically, the G4s were first mechanically unfolded in the aforementioned force-ramping procedure. The force was subsequently jumped to 1 pN and was held at this force for various holding time intervals (t). If a G4 unfolding step was observed, it indicated that G4 was folded at 1 pN before the force was increased. Repeating the procedure N times, we obtained the probability of refolding of the G4 over the holding time t at 1 pN by pfold(t) = M/N, where M is the number of cycles in which the G4 refolded. As shown in Fig. 2F, Bcl2-2345 pfold(t) data were fitted with a single-exponential function as follows: pfold(t) = pst(1 − e−kt). Here, pst is the steady-state folding probability at 1 pN, and kf is the folding rate. Using this approach, the values of pst and kf were determined to be ∼84% and 0.028 ± 0.005 s−1 in 100 mm KCl and ∼70% and 0.011 ± 0.003 s−1 in 150 mm KCl. These results suggested that the folding rate and folding probability of the Bcl2-2345 G4 decreased when the potassium concentration increased. We next analyzed the unfolding and refolding kinetics of Bcl2-1245 G4 using the same force-ramp methods (Fig. 3, A–D). Due to the low refolding probability in 100 mm KCl (pfold ∼10% at 300 s; see Fig. 3D, open circle), we used 150 mm KCl, which showed a higher folding probability (pfold ∼27% at 300 s) than in 100 mm KCl but was still at a physiologically relevant potassium concentration (23Linzell J.L. Peaker M. Intracellular concentrations of sodium, potassium and chloride in the lactating mammary gland and their relation to the secretory mechanism.J. Physiol. 1971; 216 (5105748): 683-70010.1113/jphysiol.1971.sp009547Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A total of 170 unfolding events were measured from more than 10 independent DNA tethers. The unfolding force distribution of the Bcl2-1245 G4 shows a single peak at 55 ± 6 pN (average ± S.D.). The best-fitting parameters for the Bcl2-1245 G4 were ku = (1.7 ± 0.9) × 10−7 s−1 and Δxu = 0.93 ± 0.04 nm (average ± S.E.) (Fig. 3B). The unfolding step size distribution also revealed a single peak at 30 ± 2 nt in 150 mm KCl (average ± S.D.), which is consistent with the number of nucleotides in the Bcl2-1245 G4 sequence (Fig. 3C). We also measured the average unfolding force and unfolding step size of Bcl2-1245 in 100 mm KCl, and the values of 47 ± 7 pN and 27 ± 7 nt (n = 12 from more than 7 beads), respectively, were similar to those measured in 150 mm KCl. Based on the time evolution of the refolding probability of Bcl2-1245 G4, the steady-state folding probability pst and the folding rate kf were determined to be ∼33% and 0.005 ± 0.001 s−1 for Bcl2-1245 in 150 mm KCl (Fig. 3D). The ∼33% of the steady-state folding probability of Bcl2-1245 G4 cannot be explained based on the reversible unfolding of Bcl2-1245 at 1 pN, as the unfolding rate was much lower than the folding rate. Based on the drastically different unfolding and refolding rates at 1 pN, one would expect ∼100% of the steady-state folding probability. To explain this unexpectedly low steady-state folding probability, we reasoned that after force-jumping to 1 pN, the unfolded ssDNA could refold into some metastable intermediate secondary structures, which prevents the formation of G4 over our experimental timescale for refolding (several minutes). To test this possibility, we compared the CD spectra of the Bcl2-1245 G4 prepared using fast in situ refolding induced by suddenly adding 150 mm KCl and thermal annealing by reducing the temperature gradually over several hours. The CD spectra (Fig. 3E) of the DNA sample prepared using a fast in situ refolding protocol at room temperature showed a lower peak at 260 nm than that prepared using a thermal annealing protocol, indicating that fewer G4 structures were formed by a fast in situ refolding protocol. Measuring the equilibrium folding probability of the Bcl2-1245 sequence may require a timescale longer than 10 min, which was difficult to achieve in repeating stretching cycles. This result supports our explanation of the low steady-state folding probability of the Bcl2-1245 G4. It has been known that the WT Pu39 sequence can form multiple G4 structures, including Bcl2-2345 and Bcl2-1245 G4s, using different combinations of the G-tracts. To obtain new insights into the G-rich structures formed in the Pu39 sequence, we measured the distributions of unfolding forces and step sizes of the stable DNA secondary structures formed on the Pu39 sequence using the same force-ramp experiments at 2 pN/s in 100 mm KCl buffer (Fig. 4, A and B). The results show a broad distribution of unfolding forces and step sizes, which is consistent with a previous single-molecule force spectroscopy study (18Cui Y. Kong D. Ghimire C. Xu C. Mao H. Mutually exclusive formation of G-quadruplex and i-motif is a general phenomenon governed by steric hindrance in duplex DNA.Biochemistry. 2016; 55 (27027664): 2291-229910.1021/acs.biochem.6b00016Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The broad distribution of unfolding forces and step sizes suggest that multiple stable DNA secondary structures form in the Pu39 sequence. Assuming that the Bcl2-2345 and Bcl2-1245 G4s are the only two types of G4s that can be formed in the Pu39 sequence, we find that a two-species model with unfolding force peaks at 21 pN (Bcl2-2345) and 54 pN (Bcl2-1245) was unable to fit the experimental data obtained for the Pu39 sequence. The peak value of the Bcl2-1245 G4 was the average unfolding force of Bcl2-1245 G4 (54 ± 8 pN, n = 15) measured using the same conditions as the Pu39 sequence at 100 mm KCl and 2 pN/s loading rates. To explain the data, we used a three-species model that contained the contributions from Bcl2-2345, Bcl2-1245 G4s, and an unknown species to fit the data. Treating the relative abundance of the three species as well as the peak and variance of the unknown species as free parameters, the experimentally measured unfolding force distribution can be explained (black curve in Fig. 4A). Based on the areas occupied by these species, their fractions of occurrence were estimated to be 14% for Bcl2-2345 G4 unfolded at 21 ± 7 pN, 60% for the unknown species unfolded at 31 ± 6 pN, and 2% for Bcl2-1245 G4 unfolded at 54 ± 5 pN. Notably, the unknown species occupies more than half of the occurrence. Fig. 4B shows the distribution of the number of released nucleotides during unfolding, which were fitted using a double-Gaussian model; one peaked at 23 ± 3 nt and the other peaked at 30 ± 2 nt, occupying 64 and 12%, respectively. It is expected that the unfolding of Bcl2-2345 G4 should release ∼23 nt; however, based on the unfolding force distribution, the occurrence probability for the Bcl2-2345 G4 is ∼14%. Therefore, 50% of the fraction that released ∼23 nt belongs to an unknown species. Based on the same calculation, 10% of the fraction that released ∼30 nt was from another unknown species. This result suggests that multiple unknown species formed in the Pu39 sequence. Fig. 4C shows that the pfold(t) of the Pu39 sequence reached a steady-state folding probability of 76% within 60 s with an apparent fold"

Therefore, this study aims to assess the individual and community level factors affecting feeding according to minimum acceptable diet among 6–23 months age children in Ethiopia. Methods This study analyzed retrospectively a cross-sectional data on a weighted sample of 2919 children aged 6–23 months nested within 617 clusters after extracting from Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey 2016 via the link www.measuredhs.com. By employing bi-variate multilevel logistic regression model, variables which were significant at the p-value < 0.25 were included in multivariable multilevel logistic regression analysis. Finally, variables with a p-value < 0.05 were considered as significant predictors of minimum acceptable diet. Results Only 6.1% of 6–23 months age children feed minimum acceptable diet in Ethiopia. Children 18–23 months age (AOR = 3.7, 95%CI 1.9, 7.2), father’s with secondary or higher education (AOR = 2.1, 95%CI 1.2, 3.6), Employed mothers (AOR = 1.7, 95%CI 1.2, 2.5), mothers have access to drinking water (AOR = 1.9, 95%CI 1.2, 2.9), mothers with media exposure (AOR = 2.1 95%CI 1.1, 2.7) were positive individual level predictors. Urban mothers (AOR = 4.8, 95%CI 1.7, 13.2)) and agrarian dominant region (AOR = 5.6, 95%CI 2.2, 14.5) were community level factors that significantly associated with a minimum acceptable diet of 6–23 months age children. Conclusion Both individual and community level factors were significantly associated with a minimum acceptable diet of 6–23 months age children in Ethiopia, suggesting that nutritional interventions designed to improve child health should not only be implemented at the individual level but tailored to community context as well."
https://openalex.org/W2800035578,"A new dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) method is introduced for simultaneous system identification and denoising in conjunction with the adoption of an extended Kalman filter algorithm. The present paper explains the extended-Kalman-filter-based DMD (EKFDMD) algorithm which is an online algorithm for dataset for a small number of degree of freedom (DoF). It also illustrates that EKFDMD requires significant numerical resources for many-degree-of-freedom (many-DoF) problems and that the combination with truncated proper orthogonal decomposition (trPOD) helps us to apply the EKFDMD algorithm to many-DoF problems, though it prevents the algorithm from being fully online. The numerical experiments of a noisy dataset with a small number of DoFs illustrate that EKFDMD can estimate eigenvalues better than or as well as the existing algorithms, whereas EKFDMD can also denoise the original dataset online. In particular, EKFDMD performs better than existing algorithms for the case in which system noise is present. The EKFDMD with trPOD, which unfortunately is not fully online, can be successfully applied to many-DoF problems, including a fluid-problem example, and the results reveal the superior performance of system identification and denoising."

This study aims to analyze, whether bleeding risk can be assessed by global tests of hemostasis. Standard laboratory tests and an extended evaluation of hemostasis by rotational thromboelastometry, platelet function analyzer (PFA) and multiple electrode aggregometry as well as thrombin generation assays and measurement of fibrinolytic potential were performed in 20 patients on hemodialysis, 10 patients on peritoneal dialysis, 10 patients with chronic kidney disease stage G5 (CKD5) and in 10 healthy controls (HC). Hemoglobin was significantly lower in patients with end-stage renal disease versus HC (each p<0.01). Patients on peritoneal dialysis showed increased fibrinogen levels compared to HC (p<0.01), which were also reflected by FIBTEM results (each p<0.05). 41% of hemodialysis patients and 44% of CKD5 patients presented with prolonged PFA-ADP-test (p<0.05), while no patient on peritoneal dialysis and no HC offered this modification. Thrombin generating potential was significantly lower in patients on hemodialysis, while clot lysis time revealed a hypofibrinolytic state in patients on hemo- and peritoneal dialysis compared to HC (p<0.001). In conclusion, patients with end-stage renal disease have complex hemostatic changes with both hyper- and hypocoagulable features, which are dependent on use and type of dialysis. Hypercoagulable features include elevated fibrinogen levels and a hypofibrinolytic state, whereas hypocoagulable features include decreased thrombin generating capacity and platelet dysfunction. Our results may contribute to a more rational approach to hemostatic management in these patients."

Specifically, Pseudorabies virus (PRV), Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), Classical swine fever virus (CSFV), Swine influenza virus (SIV) as enveloped viruses and Porcine parvovirus (PPV), Swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV), Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) and Senecavirus A (SVA) as non-enveloped viruses, were inoculated in bovine or porcine plasma and subjected to different UV-C irradiation doses (0, 750, 1500, 3000, 6000 and 9000 J/L) using an UV-C device developed for opaque liquid working under turbulent flow. The enveloped viruses tested were inactivated at < 3000 J/L of UV-C, being the dose needed to inactivate 4 log TCID50 (4D) of 1612 J/L for PRV,1004 J/L for PRRSV, 1953 J/L for PEDV, 1639 J/L for SIV, 1641 J/L for CSFV and 1943 J/L for BVDV. The non-enveloped viruses tended to have higher 4D values: 2161 J/L for PPV, 3223 J/L for SVA and 3708 J/L for SVDV. Because the initial viral concentration was <4.0 Log for PCV-2, it was not possible to calculate the 4D value for this virus. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that the SurePure Turbulator UV-C treatment system is capable of inactivating significant levels of swine viruses inoculated in commercially collected porcine or bovine plasma. It was concluded that irradiation with UV-C can provide an additional redundant biosafety feature in the manufacturing process of spray-dried animal plasma."
https://openalex.org/W2916241651,"Sauropodomorphs are the most abundant and diverse clade of Triassic dinosaurs, but the taxonomy of their earliest (Carnian) representatives is still poorly understood. One such taxon is Pampadromaeus barberenai, represented by a nearly complete disarticulated skeleton recovered from the upper part of the Santa Maria Formation of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Here, the osteology of Pam. barberenai is fully described for the first time. Detailed comparisons with other Carnian sauropodomorphs reveal a unique anatomy, corroborating its status as a valid species. Potential autapomorphies of Pam. barberenai can be seen in the articulation of the sacral zygapophyses, the length of the pectoral epipodium, the shape of the distal articulation of the femur and the proximal articulation of metatarsal 1. A novel phylogenetic study shows that relationships among the Carnian sauropodomorphs are poorly constrained, possibly because they belong to a “zone of variability”, where homoplasy abounds. Yet, there is some evidence that Pam. barberenai may nest within Saturnaliidae, along with Saturnalia tupiniquim and Chromogisaurus novasi, which represents the sister group to the larger sauropodomorphs, i.e. Bagualosauria."
https://openalex.org/W2917928803,"Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones are critical for protein quality control in the cytosol, whereas organelle-specific Hsp70/Hsp90 paralogs provide similar protection for mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Cytosolic Hsp70/Hsp90 can operate sequentially with Hsp90 selectively associating with Hsp70 after Hsp70 is bound to a client protein. This observation has long suggested that Hsp90 could have a preference for interacting with clients at their later stages of folding. However, recent work has shown that cytosolic Hsp70/Hsp90 can directly interact even in the absence of a client, which opens up an alternative possibility that the ordered interactions of Hsp70/Hsp90 with clients could be a consequence of regulated changes in the direct interactions between Hsp70 and Hsp90. However, it is unknown how such regulation could occur mechanistically. Here, we find that the ER Hsp70/Hsp90 (BiP/Grp94) can form a direct complex in the absence of a client. Importantly, the direct interaction between BiP and Grp94 is nucleotide-specific, with BiP and Grp94 having higher affinity under ADP conditions and lower affinity under ATP conditions. We show that this nucleotide-specific association between BiP and Grp94 is largely due to the conformation of BiP. When BiP is in the ATP conformation its substrate-binding domain blocks Grp94; in contrast, Grp94 can readily associate with the ADP conformation of BiP, which represents the client-bound state of BiP. Our observations provide a mechanism for the sequential involvement of BiP and Grp94 in client folding where the conformation of BiP provides the signal for the subsequent recruitment of Grp94."
https://openalex.org/W2917049716,"Gulf War illness (GWI) is a chronic multisymptom disorder that is prominent in Gulf War veterans. Major unexplained symptoms of GWI include functional gastrointestinal disorders and undiagnosed illnesses, including neurologic disorders. Exposure to the antinerve gas drug pyridostigmine bromide (PB) is linked to the development of GWI, but the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we tested the hypothesis that PB alters gut function by disrupting the neural and immune systems of the intestine. We exposed male and female mice to physiologically comparable amounts of PB that match the dose, route, and time frame of exposure experienced by Gulf War veterans and assessed the acute and chronic impacts on gastrointestinal functions, the functional architecture of the enteric nervous system, and immune responses in the gut and brain. Exposure to PB drove acute alterations to colonic motility and structure in both male and female mice that transitioned to chronic changes in gut functions. PB drove acute alterations to enteric neural and glial activity, glial reactivity, and neuron survival with glial reactivity persisting into the chronic phase in male mice. Despite having no effect on colonic permeability, exposure to PB caused major shifts in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the colon and brain that suggest immunosuppressive effects. Interestingly, immune disruption was still evident in the colon and brain in female animals at 1 mo following exposure to PB. Together, our results show that the paradigm of PB exposure experienced by veterans of the Persian Gulf War contributes to long-lasting pathophysiology by driving enteric neuroinflammation, promoting immunosuppression, and altering functional anatomy of the colon in a sex-dependent manner.-Hernandez, S., Fried, D.

https://openalex.org/W2915882585,"Introduction The prevalence of heart failure increases in the aging population and following myocardial infarction (MI), yet the extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling underpinning the development of aging- and MI-associated cardiac fibrosis remains poorly understood. A link between inflammation and fibrosis in the heart has long been appreciated, but has mechanistically remained undefined. We investigated the expression of a novel protein, extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1) in the aging and infarcted heart. Methods Young adult (3-month old) and aging (18-month old) C57BL/6 mice were assessed. Young mice were subjected to left anterior descending artery-ligation to induce MI, or transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery to induce pressure-overload cardiomyopathy. Left ventricle (LV) tissue was collected early and late post-MI/TAC. Bone marrow cells (BMCs) were isolated from young healthy mice, and subject to flow cytometry. Human cardiac fibroblast (CFb), myocyte, and coronary artery endothelial & smooth muscle cell lines were cultured; human CFbs were treated with recombinant ECM1. Primary mouse CFbs were cultured and treated with recombinant angiotensin-II or TGF-β1. Immunoblotting, qPCR and mRNA fluorescent in-situ hybridization (mRNA-FISH) were conducted on LV tissue and cells. Results ECM1 expression was upregulated in the aging LV, and in the infarct zone of the LV early post-MI. No significant differences in ECM1 expression were found late post-MI or at any time-point post-TAC. ECM1 was not expressed in any resident cardiac cells, but ECM1 was highly expressed in BMCs, with high ECM1 expression in granulocytes. Flow cytometry of bone marrow revealed ECM1 expression in large granular leucocytes. mRNA-FISH revealed that ECM1 was indeed expressed by inflammatory cells in the infarct zone at day-3 post-MI. ECM1 stimulation of CFbs induced ERK1/2 and AKT activation and collagen-I expression, suggesting a pro-fibrotic role. Conclusions ECM1 expression is increased in ageing and infarcted hearts but is not expressed by resident cardiac cells. Instead it is expressed by bone marrow-derived granulocytes. ECM1 is sufficient to induce cardiac fibroblast stimulation in vitro. Our findings suggest ECM1 is released from infiltrating inflammatory cells, which leads to cardiac fibroblast stimulation and fibrosis in aging and MI. ECM1 may be a novel intermediary between inflammation and fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2916612456,"Several pregnancy complications result from abnormal trophoblast invasion. The dichotomous effect of TGF-β on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) between trophoblast invasion and cancer progression remains unknown and a critical concern. We attenuated the expression of TGF-β type 1 receptor (coding by TGFBR1) with RNA interference in trophoblastic cells and significantly enhanced the trophoblastic invasion. Analysis of microRNA profiles in trophoblasts indicated microRNA-7 as a key molecule linking TGF-β with the negative regulation of trophoblast invasion. We then attenuated TGFBR1 and miR-7 transcription by transducing either short hairpin RNA targeting TGFBR1 or anti-miR-7-locked nucleonic acid, and we observed an up-regulation of EMT-related transcription factors (TFs) and their downstream effectors, causing a mesenchymal transition of trophoblasts. Conversely, overexpression of TGFBR1 or miR-7 led to the epithelial transition of trophoblasts. Our results showed that TGF-β-induced miR-7 expression negatively modulated the TGF-β-SMAD family member 2-mediated EMT pathway via targeting EMT-related TFs and down-regulating their mesenchymal markers. These findings possibly explain, at least in part, why TGF-β exerts an opposite effect on EMT during trophoblast invasion and cancer progression.-Shih, J.-C., Lin, H.-H., Hsiao, A.-C., Su, Y.-T., Tsai, S., Chien, C.-L., Kung, H.-N.

https://openalex.org/W2917955390,"Background The conduction and report of network meta-analysis (NMA), including the presentation of the network-plot, should be transparent. We aimed to propose metrics adapted from graph theory and social network-analysis literature to numerically describe NMA geometry. Methods A previous systematic review of NMAs of pharmacological interventions was performed. Data on the graph’s presentation were collected. Network-plots were reproduced using Gephi 0.9.1. Eleven geometric metrics were tested. The Spearman test for non-parametric correlation analyses and the Bland-Altman and Lin’s Concordance tests were performed (IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0). Results From the 477 identified NMAs only 167 graphs could be reproduced because they provided enough information on the plot characteristics. The median nodes and edges were 8 (IQR 6–11) and 10 (IQR 6–16), respectively, with 22 included studies (IQR 13–35). Metrics such as density (median 0.39, ranged 0.07–1.00), median thickness (2.0, IQR 1.0–3.0), percentages of common comparators (median 68%), and strong edges (median 53%) were found to contribute to the description of NMA geometry. Mean thickness, average weighted degree and average path length produced similar results than other metrics, but they can lead to misleading conclusions. Conclusions We suggest the incorporation of seven simple metrics to report NMA geometry. Editors and peer-reviews should ensure that guidelines for NMA report are strictly followed before publication."
https://openalex.org/W2775759377,"Collective motion is an intriguing phenomenon, especially considering that it arises from a set of simple rules governing local interactions between individuals. In theoretical models, these rules are normally \emph{assumed} to take a particular form, possibly constrained by heuristic arguments. We propose a new class of models, which describe the individuals as \emph{agents}, capable of deciding for themselves how to act and learning from their experiences. The local interaction rules do not need to be postulated in this model, since they \emph{emerge} from the learning process. We apply this ansatz to a concrete scenario involving marching locusts, in order to model the phenomenon of density-dependent alignment. We show that our learning agent-based model can account for a Fokker-Planck equation that describes the collective motion and, most notably, that the agents can learn the appropriate local interactions, requiring no strong previous assumptions on their form. These results suggest that learning agent-based models are a powerful tool for studying a broader class of problems involving collective motion and animal agency in general."
https://openalex.org/W2915351903,"T cell suppression contributes to immune dysfunction in sepsis. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well-defined. Here, we show that exposure of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can rapidly and dose-dependently suppress interleukin-2 (IL-2) production and T cell proliferation. We also report that these effects depend on monocytes. LPS did not prevent the interaction of monocytes with T cells, nor did it induce programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) signaling that causes T cell suppression. Instead, we found that LPS stimulation of monocytes led to the accumulation of extracellular ATP that impaired mitochondrial function, cell migration, IL-2 production, and T cell proliferation. Mechanistically, LPS-induced ATP accumulation exerted these suppressive effects on T cells by activating the purinergic receptor P2Y11 on the cell surface of T cells. T cell functions could be partially restored by enzymatic removal of extracellular ATP or pharmacological blocking of P2Y11 receptors. Plasma samples obtained from sepsis patients had similar suppressive effects on T cells from healthy subjects. Our findings suggest that LPS and ATP accumulation in the circulation of sepsis patients suppresses T cells by promoting inappropriate P2Y11 receptor stimulation that impairs T cell metabolism and functions. We conclude that inhibition of LPS-induced ATP release, removal of excessive extracellular ATP, or P2Y11 receptor antagonists may be potential therapeutic strategies to prevent T cell suppression and restore host immune function in sepsis.

Currently, it is not clear whether HIV-1 infection itself or antiretroviral therapy have an effect on semen parameters. We aim evaluate semen quality in a large cohort of fertile HIV-1 infected men under stable highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and to assess the effect of HAART type and duration on semen parameters.Between January 2010 and June 2014, we enrolled in a retrospective case-control study 770 HIV-1 patients under stable HAART asking a reproductive counselling with their HIV negative partner. Co-infections with HBV or HCV, genital tract infections and known causes of infertility represented exclusion criteria. Semen samples were analysed and compared with the WHO reference values. A multivariate analysis including HAART type and duration, age, viral load and CD4 count, was performed on 600 patients out of 770.The median values of all semen parameters were significantly lower among HIV-1 infected patients compared to the WHO reference group, with a significant proportion of patients having values below the 5th percentile of the WHO reference value. In a multivariate analysis, only age and viral load negatively impacted progressive motility (β -0.3 (95% CI: -0.5; -0.0) %, p<0.05) and semen morphology (β -0.00 (95% CI: -0.00; -0.00) %, p≤0.01), while no associations were detected as regards HAART type and duration.HIV-1 infected patients showed a significant impairment of semen parameters compared to the reference values. HAART type and duration showed no associations with semen quality. Further research is needed to investigate implications for clinical care of HIV infected men desiring a child."
https://openalex.org/W2918045491,"A Partial Least Squares (PLS) carbonate (CO3) prediction model was developed for soils throughout the contiguous United States using mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy. Excellent performance was achieved over an extensive geographic and chemical diversity of soils. A single model for all soil types performed very well with a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 12.6 g kg-1 and was further improved if Histosols were excluded (RMSEP 11.1 g kg-1). Exclusion of Histosols was particularly beneficial for accurate prediction of CO3 values when the national model was applied to an independent regional dataset. Little advantage was found in further narrowing the taxonomic breadth of the calibration dataset, but higher precision was obtained by running models for a restricted range of CO3. A model calibrated using only on the independent regional dataset, was unable to accurately predict CO3 content for the more chemically diverse national dataset. Ten absorbance peaks enabling CO3 prediction by mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy were identified and evaluated for individual and combined predictive power. A single-band model derived from an absorbance peak centered at 1796 cm-yielded the lowest RMSEP of 13.5 g kg-1 for carbonate prediction compared to other single-band models. This predictive power is attributed to the strength and sharpness of the peak, and an apparent minimal overlap with confounding co-occurring spectral features of other soil components. Drawing from the 10 identified bands, multiple combinations of 3 or 4 peaks were able to predict CO3 content as well as the full-spectrum national models. Soil CO3 is an excellent example of a soil parameter that can be predicted with great effectiveness and generality, and MIR models could replace direct laboratory measurement as a lower cost, high quality alternative."
https://openalex.org/W2915614058,"During its 1989 flyby, the Voyager 2 spacecraft imaged six small moons of Neptune, all with orbits well interior to that of the large, retrograde moon Triton1. Along with a set of nearby rings, these moons are probably younger than Neptune itself; they formed shortly after the capture of Triton and most of them have probably been fragmented multiple times by cometary impacts1–3. Here we report Hubble Space Telescope observations of a seventh inner moon, Hippocamp. It is smaller than the other six, with a mean radius of about 17 kilometres. We also observe Naiad, Neptune’s innermost moon, which was last seen in 1989, and provide astrometry, orbit determinations and size estimates for all the inner moons, using an analysis technique that involves distorting consecutive images to compensate for each moon’s orbital motion and that is potentially applicable to searches for other moons and exoplanets. Hippocamp orbits close to Proteus, the outermost and largest of these moons, and the orbital semimajor axes of the two moons differ by only ten per cent. Proteus has migrated outwards because of tidal interactions with Neptune. Our results suggest that Hippocamp is probably an ancient fragment of Proteus, providing further support for the hypothesis that the inner Neptune system has been shaped by numerous impacts. Hubble Space Telescope observations of the seventh inner moon of Neptune, Hippocamp, show that it is smaller than the other six, orbits near Proteus and probably originates from a fragment of Proteus."

https://openalex.org/W2915825668,"Cutaneous myiasis is a severe worldwide medical and veterinary issue. In this trial the essential oil (EO) of the Andean medicinal plant species Clinopodium nubigenum (Kunth) Kuntze was evaluated for its bioactivity against the myiasis-inducing blowfly Lucilia sericata (Meigen) (Diptera Calliphoridae) and compared with that of the well-known medicinal plant species Lavandula angustifolia Mill. The EOs were analysed and tested in laboratory for their oviposition deterrence and toxicity against L. sericata adults. The physiology of EO toxicity was evaluated by enzymatic inhibition tests. The antibacterial and antifungal properties of the EOs were tested as well. At 0.8 μL cm-2, both EOs completely deterred L. sericata oviposition up to 3 hours. After 24 h, the oviposition deterrence was still 82.7% for L. angustifolia and the 89.5% for C. nubigenum. The two EOs were also toxic to eggs and adults of L. sericata. By contact/fumigation, the EOs, the LC50 values against the eggs were 0.07 and 0.48 μL cm-2 while, by topical application on the adults, LD50 values were 0.278 and 0.393 μL per individual for C. nubigenum and L. angustifolia EOs, respectively. Inhibition of acetylcholine esterase of L. sericata by EOs (IC50 = 67.450 and 79.495 mg L-1 for C. nubigenum and L. angustifolia, respectively) suggested that the neural sites are targets of the EO toxicity. Finally, the observed antibacterial and antifungal properties of C. nubigenum and L. angustifolia EOs suggest that they could also help prevent secondary infections."
https://openalex.org/W2917211803,"Hydrogen gas (H2) plays an important role in plant development and stress responses. Here, cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) explants were used to investigate the roles of H2 in adventitious root development under cadmium (Cd) stress and its physiological mechanism. The results showed that hydrogen-rich water (HRW) promoted adventitious rooting under Cd stress and 50% HRW obtained the maximal biological response. Compared with Cd treatment, HRW + Cd treatment significantly reduced the content of malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide radical (O2-), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), ascorbic acid (AsA) and reduced glutathione (GSH), as well as relative electrical conductivity (REC), lipoxygenase (LOX) activity, AsA/docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) ratio, and GSH/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratio, while increasing DHA and GSSG content. HRW + Cd treatment also significantly increased in the activity and related gene expression of ascorbate peroxidase (APX), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) and glutathione reductase (GR). Additionally, HRW + Cd treatment increased the contents of osmotic adjustment substances, as well as the activities of peroxidase (POD) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO), while significantly decreasing indoleacetic acid oxidase (IAAO) activity. In summary, H2 could induce adventitious rooting under Cd stress by decreasing the oxidative damage, increasing osmotic adjustment substance content and regulating rooting-related enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W2917817866,"Fish reproductive patterns are very diverse in terms of breeding frequency, mating system, sexual dimorphisms and selection, mate choice, spawning site choice, courtship patterns, spawning behaviors and parental care. Here we have compared the breeding behavior of the surface-dwelling and cave-dwelling morphs of the characiform A. mexicanus, with the goals of documenting the spawning behavior in this emerging model organism, its possible evolution after cave colonization, and the sensory modalities involved. Using infrared video recordings, we showed that cave and surface Astyanax spawning behavior is identical, occurs in the dark, and can be divided into 5 rapid phases repeated many times, about once per minute, during spawning sessions which last about one hour and involve one female and several males. Such features may constitute “pre-adaptive traits” which have facilitated fish survival after cave colonization, and may also explain how the two morphs can hybridize in the wild and in the laboratory. Accordingly, cross-breeding experiments involving females of one morphotype and males of the other morphotype showed the same behavior including the same five phases. However, breeding between cavefish females and surface fish males was more frequent than the reverse. Finally, cavefish female pheromonal solution was able to trigger strong behavioral responses in cavefish males–but not on surface fish males. Lastly, egg production seemed higher in surface fish females than in cavefish females. These results are discussed with regards to the sensory modalities involved in triggering reproductive behavior in the two morphs, as well as its possible ongoing evolution."

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides accumulate extracellularly in senile plaques.

The spread of senile plaque-containing hAChE-S beyond brain areas rich in cholinergic innervation also suggests that hAChE-S role in plaque formation goes beyond cholinergic activity. Several hAChE variants result from alternative splicing (hAChE-S and hAChE-R, for readthrough) or alternative promoter usage (N-AChE-S and N-AChE-R, with an extended N terminus) (26Berson A. Soreq H. It all starts at the ends: multifaceted involvement of C-and N-terminally modified cholinesterases in Alzheimer's disease.Rambam Maimonides Med. J. 2010; 1 (23908786)e0014 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the synaptic variants, the readthrough variants delay Aβ fibrillization and tau hyperphosphorylation, and inversely affect plaque burden in transgenic mice (hAPPswe–hAChE-R versus hAPPswe–hAChE-S) (21Berson A.

The two variants only differ in their C-terminal domains, with only hAChE-S containing the amphiphilic 40-residue C-terminal domain (T40, AChE575–614), implicating T40 in AD pathology (27Farchi N.

T40′s classic role is to mediate oligomerization to form a variety of hAChE-S isoforms (e.g. soluble and amphiphilic, membrane-bound or anchored to the extracellular matrix). Intact, T40 is nonamyloidogenic, α-helical, and does not promote Aβ assembly (28Jean L. Thomas B. Tahiri-Alaoui A. Shaw M. Vaux D.J.

In vitro, T40-derived amyloid species are generated by insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), a protease implicated in Aβ processing and genetically linked to AD. IDE–T40 peptides adopt β-structures, are amyloidogenic, and promote Aβ assembly (28Jean L. Thomas B. Tahiri-Alaoui A. Shaw M. Vaux D.J. Heterologous amyloid seeding: revisiting the role of acetylcholinesterase in Alzheimer's disease.PLoS ONE. 2007; 2 (17653279): e65210.1371/journal.pone.0000652Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). C-terminal T40 proteolysis of hydrophilic monomers and tetramers of bovine AChE-S occurs in vivo (32Liao J. Boschetti N. Mortensen V. Jensen S.P. Koch C. Nørgaard-Pedersen B. Brodbeck U. Characterization of salt-soluble forms of acetylcholinesterase from bovine brain.J. Neurochem. 1994; 63 (7931296): 1446-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Also, naturally occurring soluble monomeric G1 AChE from fetal bovine serum, but not the tetrameric G4 form, lacks the T40 domain (33Saxena A. Hur R.S. Luo C. Doctor B.P. Natural monomeric form of fetal bovine serum acetylcholinesterase lacks the C-terminal tetramerization domain.Biochemistry. 2003; 42 (14690439): 15292-1529910.1021/bi030150xCrossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that in vivo T40 is vulnerable to proteolysis even in tetramers, and cleaved T40 from G1 AChE can be further digested to generate amyloidogenic species. Amyloidogenesis is a nucleation-dependent polymerization with an energetically unfavorable lag phase, an elongation phase (nuclei extension by monomer addition), and a plateau phase when fibril extension ends (3Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Models of amyloid seeding in Alzheimer's disease and scrapie: mechanistic truths and physiological consequences of the time-dependent solubility of amyloid proteins.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66 (9242912): 385-40710.1146/annurev.biochem.66.1.385Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). To promote nucleation, initial triggers may be required. For example, during seeding, homologous or heterologous amyloidogenic species provide a conformationally competent template to accelerate initial misfolding and formation of early assembly intermediates, including toxic oligomers (3Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Models of amyloid seeding in Alzheimer's disease and scrapie: mechanistic truths and physiological consequences of the time-dependent solubility of amyloid proteins.Annu. Rev.

Plaque-associated hAChE-S may promote heterologous seeding of Aβ, which would accelerate toxic oligomer formation and might result in stable Aβ–hAChE-S heterocomplexes (19Alvarez A. Alarcón R. Opazo C. Campos E.O. Muñoz F.J. Calderón F.H. Dajas F. Gentry M.K. Doctor B.P. De Mello F.G. Inestrosa N.C.

This seeding hypothesis may represent a previously undescribed pathological trigger for more severe Aβ pathology during AD, in which Aβ abundance is not the only driving factor. Thus, detailed dissections of the protagonists involved, including their recruitment, formation, and participation in amyloidogenesis, should provide invaluable insights for targeting and controlling diseases involving toxic protein aggregation and deposition. Here, we investigated the in vivo implication of hAChE-S in AD pathology, using a double transgenic mouse model for hAChE-S/hAPPswe (Tg2576 background, APP695 isoform) (37Rees T. Hammond P.I. Soreq H. Younkin S. Brimijoin S. Acetylcholinesterase promotes β-amyloid plaques in cerebral cortex.Neurobiol.

In contrast to hAPPswe single transgenic mice, these mice develop more numerous, frequent, and early amyloid plaques (6 months), which contain Aβ1–40, Aβ1–42, markers of activated microglia and reactive astrocytes, and hAChE-S, as do natural AD amyloid deposits (37Rees T. Hammond P.I. Soreq H. Younkin S. Brimijoin S. Acetylcholinesterase promotes β-amyloid plaques in cerebral cortex.Neurobiol. Aging. 2003; 24 (12927760): 777-78710.1016/S0197-4580(02)00230-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The extent of amyloid burden was also tightly correlated with memory impairment, more so than in the hAPPswe single transgenic mice (18Rees T.M. Berson A. Sklan E.H. Younkin L. Younkin S. Brimijoin S. Soreq H. Memory deficits correlating with acetylcholinesterase splice shift and amyloid burden in doubly transgenic mice.Curr. Alzheimer Res. 2005; 2 (15974894): 291-30010.2174/1567205054367847Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast to transgenic mice with various forms of hAPP, which only address Aβ-related pathology, the presence of the hAChE-S transgene also confirms changes resulting in an imbalance of cholinergic function and neurotransmission. Indeed, overexpression of hAChE-S in transgenic mice triggers a progressive decline in spatial learning and memory, cessation of dendritic branching, reduced number of spines in cortical neurons, and enhanced high-affinity choline uptake, all of these being hallmarks of cholinergic malfunction and characteristics reported in senile dementia (38Beeri R.

This study used synthetic peptides corresponding to products of IDE proteolysis on hAChE-S T40 to fully characterize their potential in terms of β-sheet propensity and conformation, surfactant activity, fibrillization, co-fibrillization, and seeding of Aβ. We established the importance of sequences or residues underlying plaque assembly, and we selected the most amyloidogenic peptide for raising specific antibodies. The new antisera were characterized for specificity and used with other specific antibodies to immunolabel coronal brain sections from 12-month-old WT, hAChE-S single transgenic, hAPPswe single transgenic (Tg2576, APP695 isoform), and hAChE-S/hAPPswe double transgenic mice. Mature plaques in cerebral cortex contained hAChE-S and Aβ, as in AD. Importantly, hAChE-S β-sheet species were detected in plaque cores, surrounded by α-helical forms. Plaque hAChE-S β-sheet species co-localized with fibrillar amyloid material and Aβ. These findings provide the first in vivo evidence of hAChE-S conformation in senile plaques. We previously established that IDE proteolysis of T40 generates amyloid species seeding Aβ fibrillization (28Jean L. Thomas B. Tahiri-Alaoui A. Shaw M. Vaux D.J. Heterologous amyloid seeding: revisiting the role of acetylcholinesterase in Alzheimer's disease.PLoS ONE. 2007; 2 (17653279): e65210.1371/journal.pone.0000652Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Now we have characterized a set of individual synthetic peptides identified from a T40–IDE digest, rather than as a peptide mixture. Two new antisera were generated by immunization with the ‘best’ amyloidogenic T40–IDE peptide, to use along with other specific antibodies to label brain sections of control mice, hAChE-S, hAPPswe, and hAChE-S/hAPPswe transgenic mice. The β-sheet formation is one driver of amyloidosis in AD. It is important to assess the propensity of T40–IDE peptides for conversion to non-native (hidden) β-strands. We used the algorithm of Yoon and Welsh (31Yoon S. Welsh W.J. Detecting hidden sequence propensity for amyloid fibril formation.Protein Sci. 2004; 13 (15273309): 2149-216010.1110/ps.04790604Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), who predicted minimal amyloidogenic regions for α-synuclein and Aβ and showed AChE586–599 as an hAChE-S region with high β-strand propensity. Previously, we identified YMVH as the AChE586–599 sequence with the strongest propensity for β-strand conversion, and Trp591, Tyr594, Met595, Val596, and Trp598 as crucial to maintain high β-strand propensity along the entire sequence (28Jean L. Thomas B. Tahiri-Alaoui A. Shaw M. Vaux D.J. Heterologous amyloid seeding: revisiting the role of acetylcholinesterase in Alzheimer's disease.PLoS ONE. 2007; 2 (17653279): e65210.1371/journal.pone.0000652Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Applied to T40–IDE peptides, the algorithm revealed that β-strand conversion depends on surrounding sequences and identified two regions, WKAEFHR and SYMVHWK (Fig. 1). Trp591 and Ser592 were predicted as random coils, unlike their configuration in the AChE586–599 context. It was also evident that T40 N terminus (DTLDEAERQ) and C terminus (NQFD) have propensities for both random coil and α-helix, and that His589 has a negative effect on the following RWSS. The two peptides with the strongest predicted propensity for β-strand conversion are AChE590–598 (RWSSYMVHW) and AChE594–598 (YMVHW). We further analyzed the T40–IDE peptides using three other algorithms, which confirmed the findings from the Yoon and Welsh algorithm (Fig. S1–S3). CamSol, which predicts protein solubility and generic aggregation propensity, identified SYMVHWK as being poorly soluble, followed by KAEFHR, the T40 N and C termini being highly soluble, and His589–Arg590 to have negative effects on the following WSS (Fig. S1) (41Sormanni P. Aprile F.A. Vendruscolo M. The CamSol method of rational design of protein mutants with enhanced solubility.J. Mol.

TANGO predicts β-sheet aggregation, percentage occupancy of β-sheet aggregation, β-sheet, and α-helical conformations (42Fernandez-Escamilla A.M. Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J. Serrano L.

TANGO identified AEFHR and YMVHW as having β-sheet aggregation propensity; AChE585–597 and AChE590–598 (the immunization peptide used later in the study) as having the two highest aggregation propensities, and His589 along with T40 N terminus as having a negative impact (Fig. S2).

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of, and factors associated with, wearing inadequate outdoor footwear in those with diabetes or peripheral neuropathy in an inpatient population. Methods This was a secondary analysis of a multi-site cross-sectional study investigating foot conditions in a large representative inpatient population admitted into hospital for any medical reason on one day. A range of explanatory variables were collected from all participants including sociodemographic, medical and foot condition factors. The outcome variable for this study was the self-reported outdoor footwear type worn most by participants outside the house in the year prior to hospitalisation. The self-reported footwear type was then categorised into adequate and inadequate according to footwear features recommended in guidelines for populations at risk of foot ulceration. Logistic regression identified factors independently associated with inadequate footwear in all inpatient participants, and diabetes and neuropathy subgroups. Results Overall, 47% of a total of 726 inpatients wore inadequate outdoor footwear; 49% of the 171 in the diabetes subgroup and 43% of 159 in the neuropathy subgroup. Wearing inadequate outdoor footwear was independently associated (Odds Ratio (95% Confidence Interval)) with being female in the diabetes (2.7 (1.4–5.2)) and neuropathy subgroups (3.7 (1.8–7.9)) and being female (5.1 (3.7–7.1)), having critical peripheral arterial disease (2.5 (1.1–5.9)) and an amputation (0.3 (0.1–0.7)) in all inpatients (all, p<0.05). Conclusions Almost half of all inpatients at risk of foot ulceration reported wearing outdoor footwear most of the time that did not meet recommendations for prevention. We found women were much more likely to wear inadequate footwear. More work needs to be done to increase the uptake of footwear recommendations in these populations to prevent foot ulceration."
https://openalex.org/W2915518081,"Recombinant antibodies play increasingly important roles as immunotherapeutic treatments for human cancers as well as inflammatory and infectious diseases and have revolutionized their management. In addition, their therapeutic potential may be enhanced by the introduction of defined mutations in the crystallizable fragment (Fc) domains eg YTE (M252Y/S254T/T256E) and LS (M428L/N434S), as a consequence of increased half-lives and prolonged duration of protection. However, the functional properties of any biologic may be compromised by unanticipated immunogenicity in humans, rendering them ineffective. Several potent broadly neutralizing HIV monoclonal antibodies (bnAbs) have been identified that protect against SHIV challenge in macaque models and reduce HIV viremia in HIV-infected individuals. In the present study, the pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of one or more 5mg/kg subcutaneous (SC) injections in naïve macaques of the HIV bnAb PGT121 and its PGT121-YTE mutant, both produced in plants, have been compared towards prolonging efficacy. Induction of anti-drug/anti-idiotypic antibodies (ADA, anti-id) has been monitored using both binding ELISAs and more functional inhibition of virus neutralization (ID50) assays. Timing of the anti-Id responses and their impact on pharmacokinetic profiles (clearance) and efficacy (protection) have also been assessed. The results indicate that ADA induction in naïve macaques may result both from injection of the previously non-immunogenic PGT121 into pre-primed animals and also by the introduction of the YTE mutation. Binding ADA antibody levels, induced in 7/10 macaques within two weeks of a first or second PGT121-YTE injection, were closely associated with both reduced pharmacokinetic profiles and loss of protection. However no correlation was observed with inhibitory ADA activity. These studies provide insights into both the structural features of bnAb and the immune status of the host which may contribute to the development of ADA in macaques and describe possible YTE-mediated changes in structure/orientation of HIV bnAbs that trigger such responses."

After 10 weeks, the serum levels of netrin-1, tumor necrosis factor alpha α (TNF-α), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were measured. The expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 (MMP2, 9), and their inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP2), myocardial netrin-1, and the deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) receptor were evaluated. Histopathological results were also evaluated. The collagen volume fraction of the myocardial tissues was also calculated.Compared with the sham group, in the AMI and ET groups, left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) were increased, while left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), and left ventricular pressure maximal rate of rise and fall (± dp/dtmax) were significantly decreased (P<0.05,). Compared with the AMI group, in the ET group, LVSP, and ±dp/dtmax were significantly increased while LVEDP was decreased (P<0.05). Compared with the sham group, the AMI group and ET groups showed increased levels of serum TNF-α, IL-6 and significantly reduced levels of netrin-1. Levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were significantly reduced in the ET group compared with the AMI group, whereas the level of netrin-1 was increased.

The collagen volume fraction of the myocardial tissues was significantly increased in the AMI group and the ET group compared with the sham group, with a greater increase in the AMI group.Aerobic exercise increased levels of serum netrin-1, myocardial netrin-1, and the DCC receptor and reduced the expression of myocardial MMP2 and MMP9 proteins, to improve the degree of fibrosis following myocardial infarction in rats."
https://openalex.org/W2906179275,"Biological soil crusts (BSCs) are known to affect plants’ germination and seedling establishment in arid ecosystems, but their ecological role in more mesic climates is not so well-known. We tested the effects of moss-crusted versus uncrusted soils on seed germination dynamics in a temperate pine barren ecosystem. We conducted a 35-day laboratory assay of seed germination on moss-crusted soils versus uncrusted soils from the Albany (NY) Pine Bush Preserve. We compared total seed germination and the number of days to 50% of total germination of two herbaceous perennial forb species in each soil type. Three and five times more seeds germinated on uncrusted soil than on crusted soil for bush clover (Lespedeza capitata) and wild lupine (Lupinus perennis), respectively. Seeds of both species also germinated approximately 10 days earlier on uncrusted soil than on crusted soil. This study, and others in similar habitats, show that BSCs in mesic climates can influence germination and other early life-history stages of plants. We hope that further study of the interactions between BSCs and vascular plants in mesic climates will contribute to our understanding of the ecology of BSCs outside the arid and semiarid climates where they are more extensively studied."

Therefore, the station must be located close to the building entrance/exit. Previous studies on station location located the stations only per zone, without providing the exact locations of the stations in the zones. This paper considers the optimal distance between the building entrance/exit and the station to determine the exact station locations. The results can serve as a reference for the planning and optimization of public bicycle stations. A questionnaire survey was conducted in Beijing to determine users' walking distances to the stations. The results indicated that the walking distance decay laws of stations were different for different land uses. Moreover, a binary logistic model was developed to verify that users with different travel purposes have different walking distances. Based on the above results, we explored the optimal distances and tolerable distances between the building entrance/exit and the station for different land uses. These distances can be used to determine exact station locations to meet users' physiological and psychological needs."
https://openalex.org/W2916909942,"The small bowel is affected in more than half of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) at the time of diagnosis, and small bowel involvement has a negative impact on the long-term outcome. Many patients reportedly have active lesions in the small intestine even in patients in clinical remission. This study was performed to compare findings of magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) and ileocolonoscopy.A single-center retrospective study was conducted in 50 patients (60 imaging series) with CD, for whom MRE was additionally performed during the bowel preparation for subsequent ileocolonoscopy. Endoscopic remission was defined as a Simple Endoscopic Score for CD (SES-CD) of <5. MRE remission was defined as a Magnetic Resonance Index of Activity (MaRIA) score of <50. The time to treatment escalation was assessed by the log-rank test.Importantly, 7 of 29 patients (24.1%) with endoscopic remission had a MaRIA score of ≥50. Both SES-CD and MaRIA correlated with the need for treatment escalation (P = 0.025, P = 0.009, respectively). MRE predicted the need for treatment escalation even in patients with endoscopic remission. Although no correlation was present between SES-CD and MaRIA score in patients with structuring/penetrating disease, or insufficient ileal insertion (<10cm), a high MaRIA score still correlated with the need for treatment escalation in stricturing or penetrating disease (P = 0.0306).The MaRIA score predicts the need for treatment escalation even in patients with endoscopic remission, indicating that addition of MRE to conventional ileocolonoscopy alone can be a useful, noninvasive tool for monitoring CD especially in stricturing or penetrating disease."
https://openalex.org/W2915291920,"A central question in cell biology is how cells respond to stress signals and biochemically regulate apoptosis. One critical pathway involves the change of mitochondrial function and release of cytochrome c to initiate apoptosis. In response to apoptotic stimuli, we found that maspin-a noninhibitory member of the serine protease inhibitor superfamily-translocates from the cytosol to mitochondria and binds to cardiolipin in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Biolayer interferometry assay revealed that recombinant maspin binds cardiolipin with an apparent Kd,of ∼15.8 μM and competes with cytochrome c (apparent Kd of ∼1.31 μM) for binding to cardiolipin-enriched membranes. A hydrophobic, lysine-rich domain in maspin consists of 27 aa, is located at position 268-294, and is responsible for the interaction of this protein with cardiolipin. Depletion of cardiolipin in cells significantly prevents maspin binding to the inner mitochondrial membrane and decreases cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Alteration to maspin's cardiolipin binding domain changes its ability to bind cardiolipin, and tumor cells expressing this mutant have a low frequency of apoptosis. We propose a model of apoptosis in which maspin binds to cardiolipin, displaces cytochrome c from the membrane, and facilitates its release to the cytoplasm.-Mahajan, N., Hoover, B., Rajendram, M., Shi, H. Y., Kawasaki, K., Weibel, D. B., Zhang, M. Maspin binds to cardiolipin in mitochondria and triggers apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2916791829,"Self-report measures, particularly symptom inventories, are critical tools for identifying patients with persistent post-concussion symptoms and their follow-up. Unlike in military or sports-related assessment, in general civilian settings pre-injury levels of concussion-like symptoms are lacking. Normative data are available in adolescent and college populations, but no reference data exist to guide clinical adult explorations. The purpose of this study was to use the second edition of the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT2) to profile a cohort of 60 healthy community volunteers who had not sustained a head injury. Participating volunteers underwent MRI scanning and were evaluated with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Participants reported a median of 3 concussion-like symptoms and the 97.5 percentile score was found at 10.5 symptoms, out of a total of 22. The median severity score was 4.9 points, and 28.9 was the upper limit of the reference interval. Only 10 participants (16.7%) did not endorse any symptom. The most frequently endorsed symptom was feeling difficulty in concentrating, with 41.7% of the sample reporting it. Age, sex and general distress, anxiety and depressive symptoms were not associated with concussion-like symptoms. Our data yielded elevated cut-offs scores for both the number of symptoms and the symptom severity. In conclusion, postconcussive-like symptoms are frequent in the general non-concussed adult population and it should be taken into account in any future models developed for screening patients at risk of developing physical, cognitive, and psychological complaints following mild traumatic injury."
https://openalex.org/W2916660184,"Our previous study demonstrated that sphingosine kinase 1-interacting protein (SKIP, or Sphkap) is expressed in pancreatic β-cells, and depletion of SKIP enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. We find here that SKIP is also expressed in intestinal K- and L-cells and that secretion of gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) as well as insulin are significantly increased, and blood glucose levels are decreased in SKIP-deficient (SKIP-/-) mice compared with those in wild-type mice. Plasma triglyceride (Tg), LDL cholesterol, and mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines in adipose tissues, livers, and intestines were found to be significantly decreased in SKIP-/- mice. The phenotypic characteristics of SKIP-/- mice, including adiposity and attenuation of basal inflammation, were abolished by genetic depletion of GIP. The improvement of glucose tolerance and lipid profiles in SKIP-/- mice were cancelled by GLP-1 receptor antagonist exendin-(9-39) treatment. In summary, depletion of SKIP ameliorates glucose tolerance by enhancing secretion of insulin and incretins, improves lipid metabolism, and reduces basal inflammation levels. Thus, inhibition of SKIP action may emerge as a new option for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus with metabolic dysfunction.-Liu, Y., Harashima, S., Wang, Y., Suzuki, K., Tokumoto, S., Usui, R., Tatsuoka, H., Tanaka, D., Yabe, D., Harada, N., Hayashi, Y., Inagaki, N. Sphingosine kinase 1-interacting protein is a dual regulator of insulin and incretin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2917740304,"Supplementing pig diets with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) may produce meat products with an increased n-3 fatty acid content, and the combined antioxidants addition could prevent lipid oxidation in the feed. However, to date, the effects of these bioactive compounds at the molecular level in porcine skeletal muscle are mostly unknown. This study aimed to analyse changes in the Longissimus thoracis transcriptome of 35 pigs fed three diets supplemented with: linseed (L); linseed, vitamin E and Selenium (LES) or linseed and plant-derived polyphenols (LPE). Pigs were reared from 80.8 ± 5.6 kg to 151.8 ± 9.9 kg. After slaughter, RNA-Seq was performed and 1182 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were submitted to functional analysis. The L vs LES comparison did not show differences, while L vs LPE showed 1102 DEGs and LES vs LPE 80 DEGs. LPE compared to the other groups showed the highest number of up-regulated genes involved in preserving muscle metabolism and structure. Results enlighten that the combined supplementation of bioactive lipids (n-3 PUFA from linseed) with plant extracts as a source of polyphenols increases, compared to the only addition of linseed, the expression of genes involved in mRNA metabolic processes and transcriptional regulation, glucose uptake and, finally, in supporting muscle development and physiology. These results improve the knowledge of the biological effect of bioactive compounds in Longissimus thoracis muscle, and sustain the growing interest over their use in pig production."
https://openalex.org/W2916200523,"The problem of checking the genotype distribution obtained for some diallelic marker for compatibility with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) condition arises also for loci on the X chromosome. The possible genotypes depend on the sex of the individual in this case: for females, the genotype distribution is trinomial, as in the case of an autosomal locus, whereas a binomial proportion is observed for males. Like in genetic association studies with autosomal SNPs, interest is typically in establishing approximate compatibility of the observed genotype frequencies with HWE. This requires to replace traditional methods tailored for detecting lack of fit to the model with an equivalence testing procedure to be derived by treating approximate compatibility with the model as the alternative hypothesis. The test constructed here is based on an upper confidence bound and a simple to interpret combined measure of distance between true and HWE conforming genotype distributions in female and male subjects. A particular focus of the paper is on the derivation of the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic under null alternatives which is not of the usual Gaussian form. A closed sample size formula is also provided and shown to behave satisfactorily in terms of the approximation error."
https://openalex.org/W2917275634,"Folates play a key role in the prevention of neural tube defects in newborns. Thus, it is important to reliably determine the bioavailability of folates from various foods. Accurate analytical methods are essential for quantifying blood-folates, especially in human studies. Here, we present the development and validation of a sensitive method using stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry for determining various folates in plasma. Moreover, this study reports the applicability of the developed method to a human pilot study using strawberries as a test food. Validation of the assay revealed the precision, sensitivity, and accuracy of the method in determining the predominant 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in plasma. This method was also applicable for the screening of individual folate status using finger prick blood and for monitoring the post-absorptive plasma-concentration curve. Moreover, the human study revealed a high recovery of strawberry folates with a calculated relative bioavailability of 96.2%. Thus, the developed method enables prospective bioavailability studies. This work also confirmed, via human studies, that strawberries are a rich and natural source of folates that are available for human metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2917801233,"Introduction A small bowel source is suspected when evaluation of overt gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding with upper and lower endoscopy is negative. Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) is the recommended next diagnostic test for small bowel bleeding sources. However, clinical or endoscopic predictive factors for small bowel bleeding in the setting of an overt bleeding presentation are unknown. We aimed to define predictive factors for positive VCE among individuals presenting with overt bleeding and a suspected small bowel source. Methods We included consecutive inpatient VCE performed between September 1, 2012 to September 1, 2015 for melena or hematochezia at two tertiary centers. All patients had EGD and colonoscopy performed prior to VCE. Patient demographics, medication use, and endoscopic findings were retrospectively recorded. VCE findings were graded based on the P0-P2 grading system. The primary outcome of interest was a positive (P2) VCE. The secondary outcome of interest was the performance of a therapeutic intervention. Data were analyzed with the Fisher exact test for dichotomous variables and logistic regression. Results Two hundred forty-three VCE were reviewed, and 117 were included in the final analysis. A positive VCE (P2) was identified in 35 (29.9%) cases. In univariate analysis, a positive VCE was inversely associated with presence of diverticula on preceding colonoscopy (OR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.2–0.99), while identification of blood on terminal ileal examination was associated with a positive VCE (OR: 5.18, 95% CI: 1.51–17.76). In multivariate analysis, only blood identified on terminal ileal examination remained a significant risk factor for positive VCE (OR: 6.13, 95% CI: 1.57–23.81). Blood on terminal ileal examination was also predictive of therapeutic intervention in both univariate (OR: 4.46, 95% CI: 1.3–15.2) and multivariate analysis (OR: 5.04, 95% CI: 1.25–20.32). Conclusion Among patients presenting with overt bleeding but negative upper and lower endoscopy, the presence of blood on examination of the terminal ileum is strongly associated with a small bowel bleeding source as well as with small bowel therapeutic intervention. Presence of diverticula on colonoscopy is inversely associated with a positive VCE and therapeutic intervention in univariate analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2915535902,"Initiation of treatment during the pre-symptomatic phase of Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis) infection is particularly critical. The rapid proliferation of Y. pestis typically couples with the manifestation of common flu-like early symptoms that often misguides the medical intervention. Our study used African green monkeys (AGM) that did not exhibit clear clinical symptoms for nearly two days after intranasal challenge with Y. pestis and succumbed within a day after showing the first signs of clinical symptoms. The lung, and mediastinal and submandibular lymph nodes (LN) accumulated significant Y. pestis colonization immediately after the intranasal challenge. Hence, organ-specific molecular investigations are deemed to be the key to elucidating mechanisms of the initial host response. Our previous study focused on the whole blood of AGM, and we found early perturbations in the ubiquitin-microtubule-mediated host defense. Altered expression of the genes present in ubiquitin and microtubule networks indicated an early suppression of these networks in the submandibular lymph nodes. In concert, the upstream toll-like receptor signaling and downstream NFκB signaling were inhibited at the multi-omics level. The inflammatory response was suppressed in the lungs, submandibular lymph nodes and mediastinal lymph nodes. We posited a causal chain of molecular mechanisms that indicated Y. pestis was probably able to impair host-mediated proteolysis activities and evade autophagosome capture by dysregulating both ubiquitin and microtubule networks in submandibular lymph nodes. Targeting these networks in a submandibular LN-specific and time-resolved fashion could be essential for development of the next generation therapeutics for pneumonic plague."
https://openalex.org/W2915889930,"In obstructive cholestasis, there is an integral adaptive response aimed to diminish the bile flow and minimize the injury of bile ducts caused by increased intraluminal pressure and harmful levels of bile salts and bilirrubin. Canalicular bicarbonate secretion, driven by the anion exchanger 2 (AE2), is an influential determinant of the canalicular bile salt-independent bile flow. In this work, we ascertained whether AE2 expression and/or activity is reduced in hepatocytes from rats with common bile duct ligation (BDL), as part of the adaptive response to cholestasis. After 4 days of BDL, we found that neither AE2 mRNA expression (measured by quantitative real-time PCR) nor total levels of AE2 protein (assessed by western blot) were modified in freshly isolated hepatocytes. However, BDL led to a decrease in the expression of AE2 protein in plasma membrane fraction as compared with SHAM control. Additionally, AE2 activity (JOH-, mmol/L/min), measured in primary cultured hepatocytes from BDL and SHAM rats, was decreased in the BDL group versus the control group (1.9 ± 0.3 vs. 3.1 ± 0.2, p<0.005). cAMP-stimulated AE2 activity, however, was not different between SHAM and BDL groups (3.7 ± 0.3 vs. 3.5 ± 0.3), suggesting that cAMP stimulated insertion into the canalicular membrane of AE2-containing intracellular vesicles, that had remained abnormally internalized after BDL. In conclusion, our results point to the existence of a novel adaptive mechanism in cholestasis aimed to reduce biliary pressure, in which AE2 internalization in hepatocytes might result in decreased canalicular HCO3- output and decreased bile flow."
https://openalex.org/W2917754477,"Chicken avidin (Avd) and streptavidin from Streptomyces avidinii are extensively used in bionanotechnology due to their extremely tight binding to biotin (Kd ~ 10−15 M for chicken Avd). We previously reported engineered Avds known as antidins, which have micro- to nanomolar affinities for steroids, non-natural ligands of Avd. Here, we report the 2.8 Å X-ray structure of the sbAvd-2 (I117Y) antidin co-crystallized with progesterone. We describe the creation of new synthetic phage display libraries and report the experimental as well as computational binding analysis of progesterone-binding antidins. We introduce a next-generation antidin with 5 nM binding affinity for progesterone, and demonstrate the use of antidins for measuring progesterone in serum samples. Our data give insights on how to engineer and alter the binding preferences of Avds and to develop better molecular tools for modern bionanotechnological applications."
