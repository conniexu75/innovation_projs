https://openalex.org/W1528280592,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has been shown to have hepatotrophic and renotropic functions for regeneration of the liver and kidney through its mitogenic, motogenic, and morphogenic properties. To examine the involvement of HGF in lung regeneration after acute injury, we analyzed changes of HGF mRNA, HGF activity, and HGF receptors in the rat lung after lung insult and measured HGF concentration in sera of patients with various lung diseases. Following the onset of acute lung injury induced by intratracheal hydrochloride injection, a compensatory DNA synthesis occurred in the bronchial epithelium with a peak at 24 h and in the alveolar epithelium with a peak at 48 h. Expression of HGF mRNA in the rat lung remarkably increased only 3 h after the treatment and HGF activity in the lung also increased to about 3-fold at 6 h later. HGF receptors in the lung but not in the other noninjured organs were down-regulated 12 h later. These marked increases in HGF mRNA and HGF activity and the concomitant down-regulation of HGF receptor occurred before the marked compensatory DNA synthesis in bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells. HGF concentration in sera of patients with various lung diseases, as measured by radioimmunoassay, was much higher than that in healthy donors. These results suggest that HGF is newly produced in the lung after acute lung injury and may have a role in regeneration of the lung."
https://openalex.org/W1588347494,"Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase plays a pivotal role in the synthesis of phospholipid by the mitochondria. The substrate phosphatidylserine is synthesized extramitochondrially and must be translocated to the mitochondria prior to decarboxylation. To understand the properties of the decarboxylase and exploit its unique topology to address basic questions of interorganelle cooperation in membrane assembly, we have begun to examine this enzyme in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Strains of the yeast defective in enzyme activity were isolated by modified brute force using 1-acyl-2[N-(6-[7-nitrobenz-2- oxa-1,3-diazo-4-yl)]aminocaproyl] (NBD)-phosphatidyl[1'-14C]serine as substrate for permeabilized cells. Mutant strains with less than 5% wild type activity exhibited no defective growth phenotype. The gene for the phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PSD) was cloned using an oligonucleotide probe degenerate for the sequence VGAT(I)/(N)VGSI, which is the longest stretch of sequence identity between the Escherichia coli sequence (I at position 5) and the putative CHO cell sequence (N at position 5). The gene encodes a 500 amino acid protein with 28-43% identity to the bacterial and mammalian sequences. The yeast PSD gene maps to the long arm of chromosome 14 between the kex 2 and RAS 2 loci. Null mutations created by disrupting the PSD gene with TRP1 demonstrate that the gene is not essential for cell growth even when the engineered strains are deprived of choline and ethanolamine. Analysis of lipid synthesis and enzyme activity in null mutants indicates that there are two PSD genes."
https://openalex.org/W1595165682,"Abstract G/T mispairs that arise in the DNA of higher eukaryotes as a result of spontaneous hydrolytic deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine must be corrected to G/C pairs. We describe here the purification to apparent homogeneity of the enzyme that initiates this repair process by excising the mispaired thymine from the hetero-duplex to generate an apyrimidinic site. The enzymatic activity could be attributed to a 55-kDa polypeptide, which was purified from extracts of HeLa cells by a combination of conventional and DNA-affinity chromatography. The enzyme is a mismatch-specific thymine-DNA N-glycosylase, capable of hydrolyzing the carbon-nitrogen bond between the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA and a mispaired thymine. In addition to the G/T, the enzyme can remove thymine also from C/T and T/T mispairs in the order G/T > C/T > T/T. It has no detectable endonucleolytic activity on apyrimidinic sites and does not catalyze the removal of thymine from A/T pairs or from single-stranded DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1492288851,"A human DNA damage binding protein implicated in the DNA excision repair disorder xeroderma pigmentosum E was purified to near homogeneity from HeLa cells. The protein is abundant (approximately 10(5) copies/cell) and has a native molecular weight of 154,000-163,000 as estimated by gel filtration and glycerol gradient sedimentation. DNA damage binding activity copurified with polypeptides of 124 and 41 kDa. Based on the native molecular weight, cosedimentation of both polypeptides with DNA damage binding activity on glycerol gradients, and a molar ratio of approximately 1:1 for the two polypeptides, it appears that p124 and p41 are subunits of a heterodimeric protein. Binding to damaged DNA was resistant to K+ concentrations approaching 1 M, but showed anion-specific sensitivity to Cl- concentrations above 0.5 M, suggesting that the majority of the binding energy is contributed by nonionic interactions. In contrast to previous reports, the DNA damage binding protein was shown to recognize cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in addition to a nonphotoreactivable lesion(s), most likely the pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproduct."
https://openalex.org/W1545068312,"Injection of mouse lacrimal acinar cells with the non-hydrolyzable analogue of GTP, GTP gamma S (guanosine 5‘-3-O-(thio)triphosphate), caused a rapid release of intracellular calcium but failed to activate calcium entry. Injection of GTP gamma S together with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor inhibitor, heparin, did not induce calcium release but blocked the activation of capacitative calcium entry by thapsigargin. Injection of GDP beta S (guanosine 5‘-O-(thio)diphosphate) produced similar effects. The inhibitor effects of GDP beta S were prevented if an equal concentration of GTP was included in the injection pipette. These findings suggest that one of the steps linking the depletion of intracellular calcium pools to calcium entry across the plasma membrane requires the hydrolysis of GTP and may involve a small G-protein."
https://openalex.org/W1498565802,"Colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) is a member of the immediate early gene family, which is expressed in mitogen-stimulated quiescent fibroblasts. The biological effects of CSF-1 are multifaceted and include stimulation of the proliferation and differentiation of myeloid progenitors and activity of circulating monocytes and tissue-specific macrophages. Ablation of circulating levels of biologically active CSF-1 in mice leads to osteopetrosis and sterility, thus implicating a role for CSF-1 in bone remodeling and implantation. Identification of regulatory elements and cognate transcription factors that bind the csf-1 promoter and mediate such diverse expression patterns is of great interest. We identified a sequence element at -273 to -265 (relative to the transcription initiation site) in the murine csf-1 promoter, which contains overlapping consensus sequences for the Wilms' tumor protein (WT1), EGR-1, SP1, and SP3 proteins. WT1 and EGR-1 proteins produced in vitro bound to this sequence, and co-transfection of wt1 with a csf-1-cat reporter plasmid resulted in repression of promoter activity. Interestingly, nuclear extracts prepared from serum-stimulated C3H10T1/2 cells contained predominantly SP1 and SP3 binding activities, which recognized the -273 to -265 site. Thus repression of the csf-1 promoter by WT1 at this site may involve competition between SP1 family transcriptional activators and the WT1 repressor. Colony-stimulating factor-1 may be a physiologically relevant target gene for regulation by the WT1 transcription factor."
https://openalex.org/W1544182255,"The human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I)-encoded transcriptional activator protein Tax is strongly implicated in HTLV-I pathogenesis. Tax regulates HTLV-I gene expression through three 21-base pair (bp) repeat enhancer elements located in the transcriptional control region of the virus. Tax does not bind these elements directly, but mediates transactivation through the cellular transcription factors that recognize a cAMP response element (CRE)-like sequence centered within each of the 21-bp repeats. In this report, we identify activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2) and CRE-binding protein (CREB) as the principal T-cell proteins that bind the three 21-bp repeats in vitro. Purified Tax protein augments the level of RNA synthesis induced by ATF-2 and CREB in a cell-free transcription assay, providing evidence that Tax cooperates with these cellular proteins to activate HTLV-I transcription. Furthermore, Tax dramatically increases the binding of both the T-cell-derived and recombinant forms of ATF-2 and CREB to each of the 21-bp repeats. The target sequences for this enhancement reside within the DNA binding/dimerization domains of these proteins. These data suggest that Tax transactivates HTLV-I gene expression by increasing the number of bound ATF-2 and CREB molecules at the viral promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1670792975,"Human interleukin (IL)-10 is a pleiotropic cytokine acting on a variety of immune cells. Here we show that the protein can be enzymatically iodinated to high specific radioactivity with retention of biological activity. The radiolabeled ligand binds specifically to its receptor in several mouse and human cell lines, notably human B-lymphoma line JY and mouse mast cell line MC/9. Human IL-10 apparently binds as a dimer to a single class of receptor in both the JY and MC/9 cell lines with a Kd in the 50-200 pM range. Interestingly, mouse IL-10 was capable of blocking binding of human IL-10 to mouse but not human cells. There appears to be at most only a few hundred IL-10 receptors/cell for both mouse and human cell lines examined. Chemical cross-linking of the radioiodinated hIL-10 to JY and MC/9 cells revealed a common protein complex with an apparent molecular mass of about 97 kDa. Additional high molecular weight complexes were detected with JY but not MC/9 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1504831414,"Episialin, the sialomucin encoded by the MUC1 gene is abundantly present at the surface of various epithelial cells. It is a transmembrane molecule that matures through several intermediate forms generated by proteolysis and sequential addition and processing of numerous O-linked glycans. Here we demonstrate that one of the biosynthetic intermediates, the premature form, which is incompletely glycosylated appears at the cell surface. By neuraminidase protection assays we show that cell surface-associated forms of episialin are constitutively internalized (0.9% of surface fraction/min) and recycled, with the intracellular residence time and total cycle time being approximately 66 and 143 min, respectively. During recycling, sialic acid residues are added to the premature form of episialin resulting in complete maturation of the molecule. Complete sialylation of episialin requires several rounds of recycling which continues after sialylation is apparently completed. The recycling of episialin may serve to achieve and maintain a high degree of sialylation."
https://openalex.org/W1521136774,"Glycogen storage disease (GSD) type 1a (von Gierke disease) is caused by a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphatase, the key enzyme in glucose homeostasis catalyzing the terminal step in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Despite its clinical importance, this membrane-bound enzyme has eluded molecular characterization. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a murine glucose-6-phosphatase cDNA by screening a mouse liver cDNA library differentially with mRNA populations representing the normal and the albino deletion mouse known to express markedly reduced glucose-6-phosphatase activity. Additionally, we identified the gene that consists of 5 exons. Biochemical analyses indicate that the in vitro expressed enzyme is indistinguishable from mouse liver microsomal glucose-6-phosphatase exhibiting essentially identical kinetic constants, latency, thermal lability, and vanadate sensitivity. The characterization of the murine glucose-6-phosphatase gene opens the way for studying the molecular basis of GSD type 1a in humans and its etiology in an animal model."
https://openalex.org/W1547586726,"Endothelin-converting enzyme, a key enzyme in the production of a potent vasoconstricting peptide, endothelin, was purified to homogeneity from rat lung microsomes. A sensitive and convenient assay method using the 125I-endothelin-1 receptor binding assay was developed for purification studies. The enzyme was solubilized with Triton X-100 and was purified at high yield by sequential column chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin-agarose, zinc-chelating Sepharose, and Blue Bagarose. Electrophoretic analysis of the purified enzyme revealed one protein band with M(r) 130,000. High performance liquid chromatographic analysis of the enzyme reaction revealed that purified enzyme quantitatively converted big endothelin-1 to endothelin-1, indicating that the enzyme specifically cleaved the bond between Trp21 and Val22. The enzyme was inhibited by metal chelators and phosphoramidon, but not by thiorphan and captopril. Lung endothelin-converting enzyme preferred big endothelin-1 to big endothelin-2 or -3 as a substrate, and kinetic analysis revealed that the Michaelis constant and a maximal velocity for big endothelin-1 were 0.20 microM and 3.1 nmol/min.mg protein, respectively. Lung endothelin-converting enzyme is a typical neutral metalloproteinase and is similar to the enzyme from endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1606479506,"A series of mutant apolipoprotein (apoA-I) constructs were designed and then expressed in cell culture to identify structural domains within the mature native apoA-I protein that participate in the activation of the plasma enzyme, lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). Evolutionary conservation analysis has shown previously that apoA-I contains eight repeats containing 22 amino acids and two repeats containing 11 amino acids that are highly conserved among species as well as within the apolipoprotein supergene family. These tandem repeats begin at residue 44 and are usually marked by a proline residue, with six of the 22-mer repeats showing high amphipathic alpha-helical character. To determine if specific 11- or 22-amino acid domains are essential for maximal LCAT activation within the entire native protein, each of the 10 repeats was sequentially deleted using a polymerase chain reaction based method of mutagenesis. The wild-type and mutant apoA-I gene constructs were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and stable lines established. Wild-type and mutant apoA-I protein were purified from 48-96-h conditioned serum-free medium and characterized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. Wild-type apoA-I showed a single migrating band of 28,000 daltons that corresponded to the mobility of human plasma apoA-I, whereas apoA-I deletion mutants (lacking 22- or 11-mer repeats) showed the corresponding shift to lower molecular size. To measure the relative LCAT activation of all deletion mutant apoA-I proteins relative to wild-type apoA-I, an assay system utilizing small unilamellar vesicles as the lipid substrate was used. The results of these studies suggest that several central amphipathic alpha-helical regions within the mature protein are critical in LCAT activation."
https://openalex.org/W1510233002,"We have characterized inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C (PLC) isozymes in bovine retina. Chromatography of a retinal homogenate on a heparin column partially resolved six peaks of PLC activity, which differed in their relative selectivities for the substrates phosphatidyl 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidylinositol (PI). Five of the peaks were shown to correspond to the known PLC isozymes PLC-beta 1, PLC-beta 3, PLC-gamma 1, PLC-delta 1, and PLC-delta 2. PLC-beta 1, PLC-beta 3, PLC-gamma 1, and PLC-delta 1 in the retinal fractions were identified by immunoblotting with isozyme-specific antibodies, and PLC-delta 2 was identified by direct sequencing of tryptic peptides. PLC-gamma 2 and PLC-beta 2 were not detectable by immunoblot analysis. In addition to five of the seven mammalian PLC isozymes identified to date, bovine retina contained a previously unidentified PLC, which exhibited the highest selectivity for PIP2 over PI. The new PLC was purified from a retinal particulate fraction to yield a preparation that contained a major protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 130 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Sequence analysis of 12 tryptic peptides derived from the 130-kDa protein suggested that the primary structure of the new PLC is similar to those members of beta-type PLC isozymes, especially to that of PLC-norpA, which was originally identified in Drosophila eye. The new enzyme was thus named PLC-beta 4. A search of a rat brain cDNA library with the polymerase chain reaction and oligonucleotide primers based on common PLC amino acid sequences resulted in the cloning of a rat brain cDNA corresponding to a previously uncharacterized PLC. The cDNA encoded a putative polypeptide of 1176 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 134,532 daltons, that contained the sequences of all 12 tryptic peptides of PLC-beta 4. Furthermore, the deduced amino acid sequence of the encoded protein was more related to PLC-norpA than to any of the three mammalian PLC-beta isozymes. These results suggest that the brain cDNA encodes PLC-beta 4, which is likely a mammalian homolog of PLC-norpA."
https://openalex.org/W1594107916,"We report that a human neoplastic B cell line (Reh) contains cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAK) type I (cAKI), but is practically devoid of cAK type II (cAKII). However, these cells contain a novel cAKI isozyme consisting of an RI alpha-RI beta heterodimer in association with phosphotransferase activity (RI alpha RI beta C2) eluting from DEAE-cellulose columns at a salt concentration characteristic of a cAKII. Immunoprecipitation of 8-azido-[32P]cAMP-labeled extracts and DEAE fractions employing specific antibodies directed against RI alpha and RI beta clearly demonstrated the presence of RI alpha-RI beta heterodimers. RI alpha was precipitated with RI beta antiserum and vice versa. Furthermore, disruption of disulfide bridges by reduction-alkylation abolished this coimmunoprecipitation. In addition, formation of heterodimeric complexes of RI alpha and RI beta could be demonstrated in vitro using recombinant RI proteins. Finally, the presence of low levels of RI alpha-RI beta heterodimers could also be demonstrated in human peripheral blood T lymphocytes. RI alpha-RI beta heterodimers complexed with the catalytic subunit represent a novel isozyme of cAKI (RI alpha RI beta C2), which enhances the possibilities for diversification of cAMP-mediated effects."
https://openalex.org/W1538504702,"The interaction of von Willebrand factor (vWF) with platelet glycoprotein Ib/IX plays an important role in primary hemostasis. Previous studies have localized the GpIb alpha binding domain of vWF to amino acid residues 449-728, a region containing the vWF-A1 domain. In order to assess the role of A1 domain structure in vWF binding functions, a cDNA encoding residues 475-709 of vWF was expressed in Escherichia coli (non-glycosylated) and in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (glycosylated). These recombinant proteins contain a single intrachain disulfide bond between C509 and C695 and were purified as monomers with apparent molecular weights of 36,000 (E. coli) and 39,000 (CHO). 35S-Labeled-vWF-A1 proteins bound directly to GpIb/IX receptors on platelets. The non-glycosylated form had a slightly higher affinity (Kd = 1.4 +/- 0.4 microM) than the glycosylated vWF-A1 protein (Kd = 4.5 +/- 0.9 microM) but had similar binding capacity of 28,000 GpIb/IX-specific binding sites per platelet. Additionally, both recombinant vWF-A1 proteins bound to heparin but neither bound to immobilized type I and III collagen. Both E. coli- and CHO-derived vWF-A1 proteins inhibited ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination with IC50 values of 300 and 700 nM, respectively. Reduction of the only disulfide bond between C509 and C695 abolished platelet binding activity at concentration up to 2 microM of protein. Confirmation of the importance of the 509-695 disulfide bond was obtained from a full-length vWF mutant containing substitutions at C509 and C695 (C509/695S) which failed to bind to the platelet GpIb/IX receptor. These studies document that vWF-A1 domain can bind to GpIb/IX and heparin but not collagen, and that binding to GpIb/IX requires an intact disulfide bond between C509 and C695. Furthermore, glycosylation increases the solubility but reduces binding affinity of recombinant vWF A1."
https://openalex.org/W1489447527,"Gene expression in oviparous vertebrates during vitellogenesis is hormonally regulated. Our laboratory has characterized a unique gene (wf female), which is seasonally expressed in the liver of the female winter flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus. The wf female mRNA is coexpressed with vitellogenin mRNA and reaches a high level during vitellogenesis. The wf female gene is 2554 base pairs in length and encodes a putative protein of 509 amino acids. The gene consists of eight exons separated by seven introns of different sizes. Within exon 1, there are six PQQ-rich repeats. Four of them encode a putative (PQQ)1PKY polypeptide, similar to the repeats found in the extracellular domains of other proteins. Exons 2-7 share homology with the zona pellucida protein genes rc55 of rabbit and zp-2 of mouse, and the positions of intron boundaries are conserved in the wf female and mouse zp-2 genes. In addition, the transcriptional regulatory cis elements (estrogen response element, CCAAT and TATAAA boxes), as found in vertebrate genes, are also conserved for the wf female promoter and mapped upstream from the initiation site of the wf female primary transcript."
https://openalex.org/W2134673151,"Release of large soluble NH2-terminal fragments of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) of Alzheimer's disease was measured in two Swiss 3T3 fibroblast cell lines (designated SF1.4 and SF3.2), overexpressing the alpha subtype of protein kinase C, and in two control cell lines (SC1 and SC2) (Eldar, H., Zisman, Y., Ullrich, A., and Livneh, E. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 13290-13296). Basal release of APP was significantly increased in SF1.4 cells, but not in SF3.2 cells, relative to controls. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, an activator of protein kinase C, elicited a concentration-dependent increase in APP release in all four cell lines. However, the estimated EC50 for this effect was lower in the two cell lines overexpressing protein kinase C-alpha (7 and 6 nM, in SF1.4 and SF3.2 cells, respectively) than in control SC1 and SC2 cells (56 and 22 nM, respectively). The absolute amount of APP released by maximal concentrations of phorbol ester was not altered by overexpression of protein kinase C alpha. The protein kinase C inhibitor H-7 (1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride) significantly reduced the response to phorbol esters in control (SC1) cells but not in cells (SF1.4) that overexpress protein kinase C alpha. Levels of cell-associated APP were slightly elevated, and rates of APP turnover were unchanged, in SF1.4 cells relative to controls. However, cell-associated APP levels were lower in SF3.2 cells than in controls. The results demonstrate that protein kinase C alpha regulates APP release in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, and perhaps in other tissues, including brain, and may be the isozyme that mediates receptor-evoked release of APP."
https://openalex.org/W1502636908,"Factor Va is an essential cofactor in factor Xa-catalyzed prothrombin activation. Purified human factor Va appears to consist of a heavy chain (M(r) approximately 105,000) and a light chain doublet with M(r) approximately 74,000 and approximately 71,000. We separated factor Va by chromatography on a Mono-S column into two fractions, designated factors Va1 and Va2. Factor Va1 contains the light chain with M(r) approximately 74,000, and factor Va2 exclusively contains the light chain with M(r) approximately 71,000. The two forms of factor Va express different cofactor activities when prothrombin is activated at low phospholipid concentrations or on membranes containing low amounts of phosphatidylserine in phosphatidylcholine. Compared with factor Va2, much higher amounts of factor Va1 are required for factor Xa. Va complex formation at the membrane surface. Once incorporated into the prothrombinase complex, factors Va1 and Va2 are equally active in prothrombin activation. This indicates that the two forms of factor Va do not differ in their ability to promote the catalytic activity of factor Xa or to interact with prothrombin. Direct binding experiments show that the different cofactor activities are explained by a greatly impaired ability of factor Va1 to bind to negatively charged membranes. Factor V is also separated into two protein peaks after chromatography on a Mono-S column. Upon incubation with thrombin, the first peak yields factor Va1 and the second peak factor Va2. The same two forms of factor Va were generated when freshly prepared plasma samples or platelet suspensions were treated with thrombin. This shows that the heterogeneity of the light chain domain is an intrinsic property of both plasma and platelet factor V. It is hypothesized that the heterogeneity is caused by small differences in the carboxylterminal C2 domain of factor V that are introduced as the result of post-ribosomal processing."
https://openalex.org/W1591323475,"Mammalian high mobility group (HMG)-I(Y) chromosomal proteins bind with high affinity to the minor groove of A. T-rich sequences of DNA both in vitro and in vivo. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate that in vitro both native and recombinant human HMG-I proteins also bind, but with lower affinity, to preferred regions on isolated avian nucleosome core particles containing approximately 146 base pairs of random sequence DNA. Up to four discrete HMG-I core particle complexes can be detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assays when increasing molar ratios of protein are associated with cores. Both protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions are involved in HMG-I binding to cores. The interaction of HMG-I with core DNA is demonstrated by both thermal denaturation and DNase I footprinting experiments. Chemical cross-linking studies employing reversible photoactivatable cross-linkers, combined with one- and two-dimensional electrophoretic analyses, indicate that in vitro HMG-I binds to cores in close proximity to histones H2A and H2B and H3. In situ cross-linking of K562 human erythroleukemia cell nuclei demonstrate that native HMG-I(Y) binds in a similar manner to nucleosomal histones in vivo. Proteolytic removal of the positively charged amino-terminal tails of the octamer histones abolishes binding of HMG-I to core particles. However, core binding is not mediated by the negatively charged carboxyl-terminal tail of the HMG-I protein since an in vitro produced mutant protein lacking this region binds to core particles in a manner similar to full-length HMG-I. Together these results demonstrate that HMG-I, both in vitro and in vivo, binds to preferred regions on the front face of core nucleosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1480855005,"Rapid degradation of the photosystem-II reaction center protein, D1, is driven by visible and ultraviolet irradiance at low photon-flux in the intact plant. We find that all inhibitors of electron flow that replace bound plastoquinone (QB) from its niche on D1 inhibit UV-B-driven D1 degradation, but only some inhibit visible light-driven degradation. Stabilization of the D1 protein by nitrophenol type inhibitors in visible light depends on the dimensions of the side chain at position 6 of the phenyl ring. Likewise, resistance to trypsinization of D1 at Arg-238 and to electron flow inhibitors in D1 mutant V219I (but not A251V, F255Y, S264A, or L275F) are functions of position 6 side chain dimensions in isolated thylakoids. We conclude that the configuration of the QB niche controls D1 protein degradation in intact plants under physiological photon flux. This is true irrespective of the spectral quality of radiation driving degradation. We show that UV-B-driven D1 protein degradation, but not that driven by visible light, requires plastoquinone in the QB niche to proceed. D1 degradation in visible light occurs as long as specific regions at the end of helix D and in the D-de loop of the protein are not engaged. These regions, through substrate (i.e. QB)-mediated stabilization, are proposed to regulate rapid degradation of the D1 protein."
https://openalex.org/W1514126990,"Pinus taeda suspension cultures grown in medium containing 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid showed only primary cell wall formation and essentially no lignification, as determined by histochemical, ultrastructural, chemical, and NMR spectroscopic analyses. However, these cultures maintained a functional phenylpropanoid pathway as demonstrated by formation of the lignans (-)-matairesinol and (-)-pinoresinol. Administration of [1-13C]Phe to these cultures, followed by solid-state carbon-13 NMR spectral analysis of their cell walls, demonstrated that the phenylalanine incorporated into the cell wall matrix was primarily as protein, rather than lignin. Successive transfer of the 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid-grown cultures to alpha-naphthaleneacetic acid-containing medium induced cell wall thickening concomitant with lignification. The presence of lignin was confirmed by histochemical, ultrastructural, chemical, biochemical, and NMR spectroscopic analyses. Specific labeling of the lignin polymer in situ with [1-13C]-, [2-13C]-, and [3-13C]Phe and analysis of the cell wall preparations by solid-state carbon-13 NMR spectroscopy permitted the first direct determination of the in situ bonding patterns in a gymnosperm lignin. Several dominant interunit linkages were observed, including beta-O-aryl, furanofuran, phenylcoumarin, and phenolic-linked monolignols, consistent with those predicted but hitherto not proven. Finally, milled wood lignin derivatives prepared from these 13C-specifically enriched lignin tissues gave a relatively high fidelity copy of the native lignin."
https://openalex.org/W1633593545,"It was found that cytochrome P-450(arom) purified from human placenta microsomes is glycosylated, and the sugar chain was cleaved with endoglycosidase H (Endo H). The core glycosylation of P-450(arom) was examined with two heterologous expression systems, cultured insect cells and in vitro translation system. The P-450(arom) protein expressed in the insect cells was glycosylated, and the sugar chain was sensitive to Endo H. It was also glycosylated when translated with the wheat germ cell-free system in the presence of rough microsomal membrane, and the sugar chain could be removed by Endo H treatment. Since the P-450(arom) molecule has two potential glycosylation sites (Asn-12 and Asn-180), we replaced each of the 2 asparagine residues with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis and examined the glycosylation of the two mutant proteins in the cell-free system. The core glycosylation did not occur when the Asn-12 residue was mutated, whereas the mutant protein with modified Asn-180 residue was glycosylated. These results demonstrated that the potential glycosylation site (Asn-12) in the N-terminal portion of P-450(arom) is the site of glycosylation. We conclude that the N terminus of P-450(arom) is translocated across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane to be glycosylated at the luminal side."
https://openalex.org/W1565991727,"RNA helicase II, isolated from nuclear extracts of HeLa cells, was purified 1,300-fold and contained a single protein band of 100 kDa when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme displaced partial duplex RNA exclusively in a 5' to 3' direction. This reaction was supported only by ATP and deoxy-ATP at relatively high concentrations (the Km was estimated as 1 mM). The enzyme displayed only ATPase and deoxy-ATPase activity that was stimulated preferentially by poly(C). RNA helicase catalyzed the unwinding of duplex RNA and RNA.DNA hybrids provided that single-stranded (ss) RNA was available for the helicase to bind. In the presence of MgCl2 and ATP or adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) RNA helicase II interacted with ssRNA and yielded a protein-RNA complex only when reaction mixtures were treated with glutaraldehyde after incubation. When the reactions contained nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs or GTP, ssRNA was converted into an electrophoretically slower migrating form by the helicase. The slower migrating RNA form was shown to be an RNA species containing secondary structure that resided within a putative hairpin loop. These observations indicate that RNA helicase II can introduce intramolecular secondary structure in ssRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1595191255,"Class I major histocompatibility complex molecules play an important role in cellular immunity by presenting antigenic peptides to cytotoxic T cells. Deep polymorphic pockets in the peptide-binding groove of class I major histocompatibility complex molecules provide structural complementarity for peptide side chains. However, the minimum requirements of a peptide for high-affinity binding and the contribution of anchor side chains to binding have not been determined yet. To address these issues, we have compared the affinities of various octapeptides for purified, soluble H-2Kb molecules. The results revealed that at least 2 anchor residues are necessary for high-affinity binding, and that high-affinity binding occurs only when anchor side chains are optimally packed within the groove. The estimated free energy contribution of two anchor side chains to binding is unexpectedly large and comparable with that of peptide backbone, suggesting a crucial role of anchor residues in high-affinity, and hence specific, binding to class I molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1493724927,"Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1) is a potent inhibitor of epithelial cell growth, although the mechanism of growth inhibition remains unknown. We report here a critical relationship between cellular p21ras activity and TGF beta 1 action. Microinjection of oncogenic Ha-ras protein into TGF beta 1-arrested mink lung epithelial cells overcomes TGF beta 1 growth inhibition and allows progression into S phase. Cells released from TGF beta 1 inhibition following microinjection with anti-p21ras antibody, on the other hand, remain TGF beta 1-arrested and do not enter S phase, indicating a requirement for p21ras activity. These biological data are substantiated biochemically in that TGF beta 1 is shown to decrease the activation state of endogenous p21ras, as measured by the level of GTP-bound p21ras. In addition, the phosphorylation and kinase activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase, which depends upon cellular ras activity, is elevated in cells which have been released from growth arrest by TGF beta 1. Together these data demonstrate the involvement of p21ras activity in TGF beta 1-induced growth inhibition and suggest that the inhibitor controls proliferation by modulating the activity of p21ras."
https://openalex.org/W1539649121,"Coproporphyrinogen oxidase (EC 1.3.3.3), the enzyme involved in the sixth step of heme biosynthesis, was purified to apparent homogeneity from bovine liver; it has a molecular mass of 37,000 daltons. Partial amino acid sequences were determined. Two degenerate oligonucleotides based on the sequences of trypsin-digested peptides were used in a polymerase chain reaction to amplify a 198-base pair fragment of coproporphyrinogen oxidase DNA, using bovine kidney cells cDNA as a starting template. This fragment was used as a hybridization probe to isolate full-length coproporphyrinogen oxidase clones from a mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cell cDNA library. Sequence analysis revealed that coproporphyrinogen oxidase comprises 354 amino acid residues (M(r) 40,647), with a putative leader sequence of 31 amino acid residues, the result being a mature protein of 323 amino acid residues (M(r) 37,255). RNA blot analysis revealed a 3.0-kilobase coproporphyrinogen oxidase mRNA in mouse liver and in MEL cells. Treatment of MEL cells with dimethyl sulfoxide led to an increase in coproporphyrinogen oxidase mRNA within 10 h, the induction reached a maximum at 24 h, and was in parallel with the induction of ferrochelatase mRNA. The cDNA allows for the expression of active coproporphyrinogen oxidase, the activity of which is mainly present in mitochondria of transfected cultured cells, thereby indicating that mammalian coproporphyrinogen oxidase is mitochondrial enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2116947965,"Horseshoe crab factor B is an intracellular serine protease zymogen involved in the bacterial endotoxin-responsive hemolymph coagulation cascade. cDNAs for factor B were isolated utilizing a polymerase chain reaction product using two primers derived from the partial amino acid sequence. The cloned cDNA of 1928 base pairs encoded 400 amino acid residues of factor B precursor. The first 23 amino acid residues constitute a presumed prepropeptide that may be processed by both a signal peptidase and a processing protease, similar to mammalian vitamin K-dependent protease precursors. The mature protein consists of 377 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 40,570 Da. The overall structure is highly homologous to that of limulus proclotting enzyme (35.9% identity), the substrate for active factor B in the cascade. Like the proclotting enzyme, mature factor B is composed of an amino-terminal clip-like domain and a carboxyl-terminal serine protease domain homologous to that of human plasma prekallikrein (36.5%). Internal sequences encode a unique activation peptide. Surprisingly, the cleavage sites of the zymogen factor B for activation by limulus active factor C were found to be an Arg-Ser and an Ile-Ile bond, the latter of which has not been found in any other protease zymogens. These cleavages result in the release of the activation peptide, which consists of 21 residues with a carboxyl-terminal isoleucine. These results indicate that the intracellular clotting system of the limulus hemocyte, like mammalian plasma clotting cascade, proceeds with the sequential activation of three serine protease zymogens: factor C, factor B, and proclotting enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1597393973,"Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs) constitute a family of protein serine-threonine kinases implicated in a variety of cell-signaling pathways. In cultured rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, ERK1 and ERK2 are activated by nerve growth factor (NGF), which also induces rapid association between ERK1 and the high affinity gp140prototrk tyrosine kinase NGF receptor. In the present work, we investigated the possible association between ERKs and the low affinity NGF receptor, p75. Extracts of PC12 cells (before and after NGF treatment) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-p75 antibodies or antiserum; the immune complexes were then assessed for the presence of ERK proteins and tyrosine phosphorylation or for ERK activity using a specific substrate peptide. ERK1 and, to a lesser extent, ERK2 were found to be constitutively associated with p75. NGF did not modulate the total amount of ERK proteins coimmunoprecipitated with p75 but did markedly stimulate the level of p75-associated ERK catalytic activity. NGF treatment also enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of a p75-associated species that co-migrates with ERK1 in Western blots. Finally, K-252a, a compound that specifically inhibits activation by NGF of gp140prototrk, abolished the latter effect. These findings indicate that NGF, via activation of gp140prototrk, leads to association of enzymatically active ERKs with p75 and raise the possibility that this interaction may play a role in the NGF mechanism of action."
https://openalex.org/W1556359925,"We have isolated and purified an enzyme (E-2) from Klebsiella pneumoniae, which catalyzes the formation of CO from CH3-S-CH2-CH2-CO-C(OH) = CH-O- (III). This compound is an intermediate in the conversion of 5'-methylthioadenosine to methionine. Concomitant with CO formation, methylthiopropionic acid and formate are produced and O2 is consumed. E-2 also catalyzes the formation of CO, formate, and butyrate from CH3-CH2-CH2-CO-C(OH) = CH-O- (IIIa), the desthio analog of III. Experiments with isotopic IIIa have shown that formate is derived from 1-C, and CO from 2-C. E-2 has a M(r) = 18,500 and requires Mg2+, and no chromophoric cofactor has been detected."
https://openalex.org/W1574557307,"The serum response factor (SRF) is a 67-kDa phosphoprotein that, together with auxiliary factors, modulates transcription of immediate early genes containing serum response elements in their promoters. Here we show that the carboxyl-terminal domain of human SRF is phosphorylated in vivo and is recognized in vitro by the double-stranded DNA-activated serine/threonine-specific protein kinase, DNA-PK. SRF phosphorylation by DNA-PK was stimulated by its cognate binding site. Protein microsequence analysis of a 22-amino acid synthetic SRF peptide and phosphopeptide analysis of genetically altered glutathione S-transferase-SRF fusion proteins identified Ser-435 and Ser-446 of human SRF as sites phosphorylated by DNA-PK. Both serines are followed by glutamine. Changing Gln-436 and Gln-447 to other residues reduced or eliminated phosphorylation by DNA-PK, confirming that these glutamines are important determinants for kinase recognition. The carboxyl-terminal transcription activation domain was mapped within a 71-amino acid region that contains both DNA-PK phosphorylation sites. Amino acid substitutions that interfered with phosphorylation by DNA-PK at Ser-435/446 in GAL4-SRF fusion proteins were reduced in transactivation potency. From these data we suggest that DNA-PK phosphorylation may modulate SRF activity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1499091445,"The function of the hydrophilic carboxyl-terminal region of Drosophila DNA topoisomerase II was examined by constructing a series of deletion mutants at the 3'-end of the Drosophila Top2 cDNA. The truncated enzymes were then expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Deletion of up to 240 out of 1447 total amino acids had no apparent effect on the enzyme's ability to catalyze topisomerization reactions. When 273, or more, amino acids were deleted, the enzyme was no longer active. Examples were found where deletion of less than 240 amino acids inactivated the enzyme. Based on the hydrodynamic properties determined for one of these mutants, the lack of activity was most likely due to misfolding of the polypeptides. The active mutants have similar hydrodynamic properties and heat inactivation profiles as the intact enzyme, suggesting that they are dimeric and stably folded. The carboxyl-terminal 240 amino acids also were not required for interaction with the drug VM26. The only difference noted between the shortest, active mutant and the full-length enzyme was a decrease in the stability of the interaction of the truncated enzyme with DNA as evidenced by a decrease in the ionic strength at which catalysis was optimal and at which the transition between a processive and distributive mode of supercoil relaxation occurred."
https://openalex.org/W1605927711,"Two chimeric proteins comprising the Na,K-ATPase catalytic domain (large cytosolic loop) and the two flanking regions of the Ca-ATPase were obtained by transient or stable expression in mammalian cells transfected with recombinant DNA. In the first chimera (CpNC), a large portion (containing the nucleotide-binding site) of the cytosolic loop between putative membrane spans M4 and M5 of the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ (SERCA) 1 (fast muscle) ATPase was replaced by the corresponding portion of the Na,K-ATPase alpha 1 subunit. In the second chimera (CNpC), an even larger portion (containing the nucleotide-binding site and the phosphorylation site) of the analogous cytosolic loop of the SERCA2 (cardiac muscle) ATPase was replaced by the corresponding portion of the Na,K-ATPase alpha 1 subunit. Steady state Ca2+ transport and coupled ATP hydrolysis by the chimeric proteins were negligible as compared to those obtained with SERCA enzymes. Nevertheless, the chimeric proteins were able to utilize ATP to form phosphoenzyme levels equal to those formed by SERCA ATPases. Chimeric and SERCA enzymes exhibited an identical Ca2+ requirement for ATP utilization and sensitivity to thapsigargin (TG) which is a specific inhibitor of SERCA ATPase and not of Na,K-ATPase. Furthermore, both SERCA and chimeric enzymes could be phosphorylated with P(i), and this reaction required removal of Ca2+. In comparative experiments, the functional pattern of seemingly unaffected phosphoenzyme formation and inhibited Ca2+ transport was produced in the SERCA ATPase even by single mutation of Pro337 to Ala, evidently due to defective protein conformation. Retention of Ca2+ and TG sensitivity by the chimeric proteins demonstrates that the Ca(2+)- and TG-binding domains do not reside within the cytosolic loop replaced by chimeric substitution and strongly support previous studies suggesting that binding of calcium required for enzyme activation occurs within the membrane-bound region of the SERCA ATPases (Clarke et al., 1989a; Sumbilla et al., 1991)."
https://openalex.org/W1599236782,"Abstract Growth factors rapidly induce numerous genes that encode regulatory proteins, many of which have been identified by cDNA cloning. In this study, differential hybridization was used to screen a cDNA library constructed from human mammary carcinoma MDA-468 cells that were stimulated with transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta 1) in the presence of cycloheximide. One of the cDNA clones that was induced by TGF-beta 1 was found to have a nucleotide sequence that predicts a 9,450-Da protein with homology to regulatory DNA-binding proteins. This clone was designated metallopan-stimulin-1 (MPS-1) because it encodes a metalloprotein whose mRNA is expressed in a wide variety of actively proliferating cells and tumor tissues. MPS-1 protein contains one zinc finger domain of the C4 type, similar to those present in proteins of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily and other DNA-binding proteins. The mRNA for MPS-1 was induced in MDA-468 cells by fetal calf serum, TGF-beta 1, TGF-beta 2, and cAMP analogues. The MPS-1 gene is expressed at relatively high levels in several human carcinoma cell lines, particularly those derived from ectodermal layers, and at higher levels in melanomas (ontogenically of neural origin). In contrast, the MPS-1 mRNA is expressed at low levels in normal WI-38 human lung diploid fibroblasts in culture. We hypothesize that MPS-1 protein may play a role as a potentially important mediator of cellular proliferative responses to various growth factors and other environmental signals."
https://openalex.org/W1553141706,"The hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoprotein of paramyxoviruses is anchored in the virion membrane near its amino terminus, protruding from the virion surface to mediate attachment to cellular receptors. Solubilization of HN spikes can be achieved by treatment of virions with detergent and high salt concentrations. When the solubilized HN protein from the Australia-Victoria (AV) isolate of the virus is incubated at 37 degrees C, a chymotrypsin-sensitive site between residues 112 and 113 is exposed. A chymotrypsin-cleaved soluble form of the protein, named CT-HN, has been prepared using this approach. It is membrane anchor-less, due to removal of a 14-kDa fragment from the NH2 terminus of HN. It retains all potential glycosylation sites and cysteines present in the ectodomain of the native protein. It migrates in nonreducing gels and sediments in sucrose gradients at the rate expected for homodimeric HN. The latter is also consistent with our demonstration by site-directed mutagenesis that cysteine residues at positions 6 and 123, respectively, mediate disulfide-linked homotetramer and homodimer formation. CT-HN retains almost total antigenicity, suggesting that it is conformationally very similar to the intact molecule, as well as receptor recognition function and, at low pH, neuraminidase activity. It should prove to be a useful tool for further studies of the structure and function of this important viral glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1604280489,"The receptor responsible for the increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) after the addition of thrombin to the human osteoblast-like cell line Saos-2 has been characterized. Thrombin caused a dose-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i; a half-maximal stimulation was observed with 3.2 +/- 1.1 nM thrombin. The human platelet thrombin receptor is activated by thrombin cleavage to create a new NH2 terminus that acts as a tethered ligand, and peptides based on the tethered ligand can activate the receptor independently of thrombin. Northern analysis indicated the presence of mRNA encoding the platelet receptor in Saos-2 cells, and surface expression of the receptor was demonstrated by immunocytochemistry. A tethered ligand peptide (SFLLRNPNDKYEPF, single-letter amino acid code) was found to increase [Ca2+]i. The maximal response to the peptide was similar to that observed with thrombin, and a half-maximal response was observed with 22 +/- 6 microM peptide. The time course of the increase in [Ca2+]i with the peptide was different than that observed with thrombin; a pronounced shoulder was observed after an initial sharp rise. The phenylalanine in the second position of the agonist peptide and the arginine in the fifth position were shown to be essential for its activity. The requirement for proteolysis of the receptor for the thrombin-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i was demonstrated by two methods. Antibodies that reacted with the cleavage site of the receptor abolished the effect of thrombin on [Ca2+]i. In addition, a mutant of thrombin without catalytic activity as well as chemically inactivated thrombin failed to cause an increase in [Ca2+]i. Similar results were obtained with the rat osteoblast-like cell line UMR-106; a tethered ligand peptide based on the rat sequence induced an increase in [Ca2+]i, and antibodies to the cleavage site of the rat receptor inhibited the effect of thrombin."
https://openalex.org/W1517210188,"The product of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae MCK1 gene is a protein kinase that phosphorylates poly (Glu,Tyr) in vitro and is itself phosphorylated at both tyrosine and serine in vivo. To characterize the substrate specificity of Mck1, the enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity from the soluble fraction of yeast cell extracts by ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by ion exchange chromatography (Q- and S-Sepharose), dye-ligand affinity chromatography (Orange A-agarose), adsorption chromatography (hydroxylapatite), and ion exchange fast protein liquid chromatography (Mono-S). In the absence of an exogenous substrate, purified Mck1 was able to autophosphorylate on tyrosine and serine. A catalytically inactive mutant (K68R in conserved kinase domain II) expressed in an mck1 delta strain did not contain detectable phosphotyrosine, confirming that the tyrosine phosphorylation observed in vivo is due to autophosphorylation, but did contain phosphoserine, suggesting that Mck1 is a target for other cellular protein kinases. Purified Mck1 phosphorylated a variety of proteins in heat-inactivated yeast extracts, primarily on serine (and threonine). The purified enzyme also used a number of mammalian proteins as phosphoacceptors, including myelin basic protein (MBP), microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2), and tau protein. All of these substrates were phosphorylated on either serine or threonine (or both). Mck1 isolated from yeast extracts by immunoprecipitation with an anti-Mck1 antibody directed against its C terminus also phosphorylated MBP at serine. In the same immune complex kinase assay, the K68R mutant did not detectably phosphorylate MBP, indicating that the serine-specific phosphotransferase activity of Mck1 is intrinsic and not due to contamination by an associated kinase. These findings demonstrate that Mck1 is a member of a novel class of protein kinases that displays the ability to phosphorylate all three hydroxyamino acids in proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1492692780,"The mechanism(s) by which monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor regulate receptor function have been investigated with NIH3T3/HER14 fibroblasts expressing human EGF receptors. Bivalent 225 mAb or monovalent 225 Fab' inhibited transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha-induced EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and cell proliferation. Culture of HER14 cells with 225 mAb or 225 Fab' did not activate EGF receptor tyrosine kinase when assayed after lysis of cells in SDS sample buffer. However, when cells were cultured with bivalent 225 mAb, but not with monovalent 225 Fab', and were subsequently lysed and further incubated in Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing proteinase and phosphatase inhibitors, receptor phosphorylation was observed. Phosphorylation was confined to tyrosine residues and was inhibited by addition of genistein after lysis, indicating that it was due to the activation of protein tyrosine kinase. The activity of bivalent 225 mAb was unphysiologic, in contrast with TGF-alpha, in that receptor kinase activation occurred only after cell lysis and with delayed kinetics; serine and threonine phosphorylation did not occur; and down-regulation of EGF receptors was slower. Selective mAb-mediated phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on EGF receptors was sufficient to activate phosphorylation of a SH2 group-bearing substrate, phospholipase C-gamma, indicating that serine/threonine phosphorylation is not required for EGF receptor kinase activity. These studies provide novel insights into the capacity of bivalent mAb to modulate EGF receptor function."

The construct was then used to transfect stably a human tumor cell line (HT-1080), and clones secreting internally deleted pro alpha 1(II) chain of procollagen II were isolated. The protein was purified, and the thermal stability of the triple-helical domain was assayed by brief protease digestion. The thermal stability of the internally deleted protein was the same as that of intact collagen II even though the triple helix was 39% shorter. Additionally, the thermal stability of the collagenase A fragment was the same as that of the collagenase A fragment of normal collagen II even though it was 38% shorter. Analysis of the results suggested that the thermal stabilities of large fragments of collagen II depended primarily on their contents of -Gly-Pro-Hyp-triplets corrected for length."
https://openalex.org/W1557978564,"Binding of human recombinant interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) to the cell surface receptors of EL-4 6.1 murine T-cells results in enhanced phosphorylation of several cellular proteins. Staurosporine abolished the enhanced phosphorylation in response to IL-1 for some of these proteins, suggesting that protein kinase C (PKC) was at least partially responsible. PKC-beta was translocated from the cytosol to the plasma membrane between 2 and 15 min after IL-1 binding. Activation of PKC-beta was enhanced by the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid. In fact, okadaic acid inhibited dephosphorylation of the PKC-specific peptide GS (Pro-Leu-Ser-Arg-Thr-Leu-Ser-Val-Ala-Ala-Lys-Lys). On the other hand, okadaic acid also led to elevation of IL-1-induced trans/autophosphorylation of PKC-beta. Accordingly, IL-1 induction of interleukin-2 synthesis was markedly enhanced by okadaic acid in EL-4 cells. These data suggest that activation of PKC-beta contributes to enhanced phosphorylation of cellular proteins in IL-1-treated cells and support the importance of protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in the regulation of IL-1-induced IL-2 synthesis in EL-4 6.1 T-cells."
https://openalex.org/W1514253388,"Xenopus egg extract is capable of supporting mitosis in vitro, which makes it ideal for biochemical analysis of the cell cycle. Since several studies have implicated the ubiquitin system in cell cycle progression, we have measured ubiquitin conjugation rates, proteolysis of ubiquitin-lysozyme conjugates, and rates of isopeptidase activity in cycling Xenopus egg extracts. Although ubiquitin conjugation in cytostatic factor arrested extract was half that in activated extract, there were no changes in rates of ubiquitin conjugation during the cell cycle. Ubiquitin conjugates are degraded by a 26 S ATP-stimulated protease. The ability of the 26 S protease to degrade ubiquitin-lysozyme conjugates and a fluorigenic peptide also remained constant across the cell cycle. In contrast to previously characterized systems, isopeptidase activity in Xenopus egg extract is energy-dependent. Glycerol gradient fractionation of Xenopus egg extract separated two ATP-dependent isopeptidases. On co-sedimented with the 26 S protease; the other sedimented slower and was not associated with any additional proteolytic activity. As found for rates of Ub conjugation and conjugate proteolysis, there was little or no variation in isopeptidase activity during the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1513058596,"Positively charged amino acids are major determinants of the topology of bacterial inner membrane proteins, whereas negatively charged residues by themselves have little or no influence on the transmembrane orientation. Further, positively charged amino acids can very efficiently block the function of signal sequences when placed immediately downstream, while negatively charged residues are much less potent also in this regard. Here, we show that a negatively charged aspartic acid situated close to a positively charged lysine can attenuate both of these effects in a position-specific manner, suggesting that intra- or intermolecular charge pairing can modulate the interactions between positively charged residues in the nascent chain and parts of the secretory machinery or membrane phospholipids. These observations further underscore the importance of charged amino acids during protein translocation and membrane protein assembly."

The phosphorylated MPR 300-CT was cross-linked by means of bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate mainly to a cytosolic protein of 35 kDa (referred to as TIP 35) and to 35- and 91-kDa proteins salt-washed from bovine brain membranes. Gel filtration suggested that TIP 35 is part of a higher molecular mass complex of approximately 130-150 kDa. Inhibition studies, using non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated MPR 300-CT and cross-linking, indicate that the interaction with TIP 35 is phosphorylation-specific. Furthermore, TIP 35 was only cross-linked to the MPR 300-CT phosphorylated by casein kinase II whereas the MPR 300-CT phosphorylated by protein kinase A failed to cross-link to TIP 35. These results indicate that the cytoplasmic tail of the MPR 300 interacts with a cytosolic protein depending on the phosphorylation by a casein kinase II-like kinase. The cross-linking with salt-washed membrane proteins, however, is inhibited by non-phosphorylated MPR 300-CT, suggesting that different structural determinants in the MPR 300-CT interact with cytosol- and membrane-derived proteins."

FUra substitution in TS mRNA results in an altered migration pattern in non-denaturing RNA gels and in decreased hyperchromicity in RNA melting temperature studies, consistent with a change in mRNA secondary structure. However, no change in the translational efficiency of FUra-substituted TS mRNA is seen compared to control TS mRNA in either rabbit reticulocyte lysate or wheat germ extract in vitro translation systems. Analysis of the in vitro translation product of FUra-substituted TS mRNA by Western immunoblotting, isoelectric focusing, 5-fluoro-2‘-deoxyuridine 5‘-monophosphate binding, and TS catalytic activity experiments shows no difference compared to control TS mRNA. We conclude that the in vitro translation products of FUra-substituted and control TS mRNA are identical. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that changes in the mRNA template are responsible for the RNA-directed cytotoxicity of FUra."

We have located the gene for the human core I protein in the p21 region of chromosome 3, just upstream of the COL7A1 gene which encodes type VII collagen. The core I gene, which has been sequenced in its entirety, is comprised of 10,417 base pairs, from the major transcription start site to the polyadenylation signal, and contains 13 exons. The predicted polypeptide contains 480 amino acids, of which the first 34 are predicted to constitute a typical mitochondrial leader peptide containing 6 positively charged arginine residues. The predicted human protein shows significant homology with core I protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, rather high homology (64% similarity, 46% identity) with the processing enhancing protein, which functions as core I protein in Neurospora crassa, and, surprisingly, highest homology with the small subunit of the mitochondrial processing peptidase of rat (74% similarity, 55% identity). The predicted human sequence is 87% identical to the reported bovine core I sequence predicted from cDNA cloning, up to residue 298, but the two predicted sequences are widely divergent after that point."
https://openalex.org/W1519215786,"Vaccinia virus capping enzyme, a heterodimer of 95-kDa and 33-kDa subunits, modifies the 5' RNA end and also acts as a transcription termination factor during synthesis of viral early mRNAs. Termination occurs in response to a specific signal, UUUUUNU, in the nascent RNA chain. We now report that purified capping enzyme binds to defined RNAs in solution to form complexes that are stable during native gel electrophoresis. Multiple enzyme molecules can bind to a single RNA. No particular 5' end structure is required for RNA binding, suggesting that the observed protein-RNA interaction is unrelated to the triphosphatase, guanylyltransferase, or methyltransferase functions of capping enzyme. Although binding does not require a UUUUUNU element in the RNA, complex formation is competed preferentially by poly(U) compared to poly(C). Capping enzyme binds to the synthetic 30-mer homopolymers to form a single protein-RNA complex; affinity for U-30 is 10-fold higher than for A-30. The sites of protein-RNA contact, as detected by UV cross-linking, are located predominantly within the 95-kDa capping enzyme subunit, which is itself sufficient to bind and cross-link to RNA in the absence of the small subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1546987636,"The rhesus erythrocytes were examined for the presence of protein(s) similar to the 70-kDa class of heat shock proteins (hsp 70). Also, interactions of these proteins with the erythrocyte membrane were studied under heat stress. These cells in their cytosol contained at least two proteins of about 70 kDa molecular mass; one of which closely resembled the hsp 70 family of proteins. This protein under normal conditions localized mainly in the cytosol, but it had a strong tendency to bind the membrane under heat stress. The binding was almost exclusively restricted to the membrane skeleton and seemed to involve primarily the hydrophobic interactions. A 70-kDa protein immunologically similar to the above protein(s) was detected also in the membranes of rhesus erythrocytes harboring the schizont stage of the simian malarial parasite Plasmodium knowlesi. From these results, we conclude that hsp 70-like proteins in the mature mammalian erythrocytes could perhaps play an important role in protecting the cells under stress by stabilizing the membrane skeleton through their interactions with skeletal proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1602454010,"Placement of endothelial cells under hypoosmotic or hyperosmotic conditions results in the reduction and increase, respectively, in the phosphorylation of a M(r) = 16,500 protein (P17). The changes were dose-dependent with a 3.3 +/- 0.3-fold increase occurring at 485 mosm/kg H2O and negligible phosphorylation observed at 202 mosm/kg H2O. The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation were rapid and prolonged; modified phosphorylation levels were maintained as long as the anisotonic conditions were present. However, return to isotonic medium reversed the phosphorylation back to normal within 1 h. Cellular fractionation studies showed that P17 was associated only with the nuclear compartment under isotonic, hypertonic, or hypotonic conditions. Two forms of P17 with pI values of 9.2 and 9.6 were resolved by isoelectric focusing; both forms showed enhanced phosphorylation by hyperosmotic treatment. Phosphorylation occurred on serines exclusively. These studies demonstrate that a nuclear protein with characteristics similar to histones is affected by cell shrinkage or swelling through changes in its phosphorylation state."

This antibody preparation, R4, binds exclusively to endoglycosidase H-resistant H-2Ld/Db molecules which are not associated with beta 2-microglobulin. Interestingly, acquisition of resistance to endoglycosidase H precedes acquisition of R4 reactivity by 30 min. R4-reactive H-2Ld and H-2Db molecules occur on the cell surface and are phosphorylated in vivo. Other studies show that the tyrosine in the cytoplasmic domain is accessible to radioiodination on only a subset of H-2Ld molecules, and that the two-dimensional electrophoretic profiles of phosphorylated H-2L/Db molecules, of R4-reactive molecules, and of H-2Ld molecules radiolabeled on this cytoplasmic domain tyrosine are virtually identical. R4-reactive H-2Ld molecules do not undergo the peptide- and beta 2-microglobulin-induced conformational changes characteristic of free class I major histocompatibility complex heavy chains. The accessibility of the H-2Ld cytoplasmic domain to R4 and to radioiodination late in biosynthesis and its biological significance are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1647134732,"Abstract Methylating agents are widely distributed environmental mutagens. To identify mechanisms that protect cells against the toxic effects of methylating compounds Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transfected with human DNA and selected for resistance to methylating agents. From methylation-resistant transfectants, human DNA was cloned that conferred methylation resistance to CHO cells. A human cDNA was isolated (designated c81) encoding a protein of 410 amino acids which is partially identical to human lamp-2 encoding a lysosomal membrane glycoprotein. Transfection of c81, but not of the neo gene or a c81 antisense construct, into CHO cells gave rise to significant increases of survivors after methylating treatments. c81 mRNA is expressed both in human, CHO parental, and transfected cells, albeit in different amounts. The methylation-resistant transfectants lacked alkyltransferase activity (Mex- phenotype), did not repair O6-methylguanine in vivo, and neither showed reduced initial DNA methylation level nor increase of removal of 3-methyladenine and 7-methylguanine from DNA. They are therefore representatives of the tolerance phenotype. The transfectants also showed a higher serum requirement, flat growth, and a reduced tumor forming ability. The data suggest a link between altered regulation of cell proliferation and acquired resistance to methylating DNA damaging agents."
