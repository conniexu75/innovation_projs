https://openalex.org/W3207961322,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting CD19 or CD22 have shown remarkable activity in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). The major cause of treatment failure is antigen downregulation or loss. Dual antigen targeting could potentially prevent this, but the clinical safety and efficacy of CAR T cells targeting both CD19 and CD22 remain unclear. We conducted a phase 1 trial in pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL (n = 15) to test AUTO3, autologous transduced T cells expressing both anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 CARs (AMELIA trial, EUDRA CT 2016-004680-39). The primary endpoints were the incidence of grade 3-5 toxicity in the dose-limiting toxicity period and the frequency of dose-limiting toxicities. Secondary endpoints included the rate of morphological remission (complete response or complete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery) with minimal residual disease-negative response, as well as the frequency and severity of adverse events, expansion and persistence of AUTO3, duration of B cell aplasia, and overall and event-free survival. The study endpoints were met. AUTO3 showed a favorable safety profile, with no dose-limiting toxicities or cases of AUTO3-related severe cytokine release syndrome or neurotoxicity reported. At 1 month after treatment the remission rate (that is, complete response or complete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery) was 86% (13 of 15 patients). The 1 year overall and event-free survival rates were 60% and 32%, respectively. Relapses were probably due to limited long-term AUTO3 persistence. Strategies to improve CAR T cell persistence are needed to fully realize the potential of dual targeting CAR T cell therapy in B-ALL."

https://openalex.org/W3206791848,"Inter-areal coherence between field potentials is a widespread phenomenon in cortex. Coherence has been hypothesized to reflect phase-synchronization between oscillators and flexibly gate communication according to behavioral and cognitive demands. We reveal an alternative mechanism where coherence is not the cause but the consequence of communication and naturally emerges because spiking activity in a sending area causes post-synaptic potentials both in the same and in other areas. Consequently, coherence depends in a lawful manner on power and phase-locking in the sender and connectivity. Changes in oscillatory power explained prominent changes in fronto-parietal and LGN-V1 coherence across behavioral conditions. Optogenetic experiments and excitatory-inhibitory network simulations identified afferent synaptic inputs rather than spiking entrainment as the principal determinant of coherence. These findings suggest that unique spectral profiles of different brain areas automatically give rise to large-scale coherence patterns that follow anatomical connectivity and continuously reconfigure as a function of behavior and cognition."

Functional cure rates are low with current treatment options (nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) and pegylated interferons). Bepirovirsen is an antisense oligonucleotide targeting all HBV messenger RNAs; in cell culture and animal models, bepirovirsen leads to reductions in HBV-derived RNAs, HBV DNA and viral proteins. This phase 2 double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial is the first evaluation of the safety and activity of an antisense oligonucleotide targeting HBV RNA in both treatment-naïve and virally suppressed individuals with chronic HBV infection. The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of bepirovirsen in individuals with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) (NCT02981602). The secondary objective was to assess antiviral activity, including the change from baseline to day 29 in serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) concentration. Participants with CHB infection ≥6 months and serum HBsAg ≥50 IU ml-1 were enrolled from seven centers across Hong Kong and the Republic of Korea and randomized (3:1 within each dose cohort) to receive bepirovirsen or placebo via subcutaneous injection twice weekly during weeks 1 and 2 (days 1, 4, 8 and 11) and once weekly during weeks 3 and 4 (days 15 and 22). Participants were then followed for 26 weeks. Twenty-four participants were treatment-naïve and seven were receiving stable NA therapy. Treatment-emergent adverse events were mostly mild/moderate (most commonly injection site reactions). Eleven (61.1%) and three (50.0%) treatment-naïve participants experienced one or more treatment-emergent adverse event in the bepirovirsen and placebo groups, respectively. In participants receiving NA therapy, the corresponding numbers were three (60.0%) and one (50.0%). Transient, self-resolving alanine aminotransferase flares (≥2× upper limit of normal) were observed in eight treatment-naïve participants and three participants on stable NA regimens in the bepirovirsen treatment arms. HBsAg reductions were observed and were significant versus placebo for treatment-naïve participants receiving bepirovirsen 300 mg (P = 0.001), but not for the bepirovirsen 150 mg group (P = 0.245) or participants receiving stable NA therapy (P = 0.762). Two participants in each of the 300 mg dose groups achieved HBsAg levels below the lower limit of quantitation by day 29 (n = 3) or day 36 (n = 1). Bepirovirsen had a favorable safety profile. These preliminary observations warrant further investigation of the safety and activity of bepirovirsen in a larger CHB patient population."
https://openalex.org/W3206918078,"Anemia is a globally widespread condition in women and is associated with reduced economic productivity and increased mortality worldwide. Here we map annual 2000-2018 geospatial estimates of anemia prevalence in women of reproductive age (15-49 years) across 82 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), stratify anemia by severity and aggregate results to policy-relevant administrative and national levels. Additionally, we provide subnational disparity analyses to provide a comprehensive overview of anemia prevalence inequalities within these countries and predict progress toward the World Health Organization's Global Nutrition Target (WHO GNT) to reduce anemia by half by 2030. Our results demonstrate widespread moderate improvements in overall anemia prevalence but identify only three LMICs with a high probability of achieving the WHO GNT by 2030 at a national scale, and no LMIC is expected to achieve the target in all their subnational administrative units. Our maps show where large within-country disparities occur, as well as areas likely to fall short of the WHO GNT, offering precision public health tools so that adequate resource allocation and subsequent interventions can be targeted to the most vulnerable populations."

https://openalex.org/W3206392229,"We aimed to examine if severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle quantification (Cq) value, as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 viral load, could predict hospitalisation and disease severity in adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).We performed a prospective cohort study of adult patients with PCR positive SARS-CoV-2 airway samples including all out-patients registered at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Odense University Hospital (OUH) March 9-March 17 2020, and all hospitalised patients at OUH March 10-April 21 2020. To identify associations between Cq-values and a) hospital admission and b) a severe outcome, logistic regression analyses were used to compute odds ratios (OR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI), adjusting for confounding factors (aOR).We included 87 non-hospitalised and 82 hospitalised patients. The median baseline Cq-value was 25.5 (interquartile range 22.3-29.0). We found a significant association between increasing Cq-value and hospital-admission in univariate analysis (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04-1.19). However, this was due to an association between time from symptom onset to testing and Cq-values, and no association was found in the adjusted analysis (aOR 1.08, 95% CI 0.94-1.23). In hospitalised patients, a significant association between lower Cq-values and higher risk of severe disease was found (aOR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81-0.98), independent of timing of testing.SARS-CoV-2 PCR Cq-values in outpatients correlated with time after symptom onset, but was not a predictor of hospitalisation. However, in hospitalised patients lower Cq-values were associated with higher risk of severe disease."
https://openalex.org/W3162531022,"Faces are one of the key ways that we obtain social information about others. They allow people to identify individuals, understand conversational cues, and make judgements about others' mental states. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States, widespread mask-wearing practices were implemented, causing a shift in the way Americans typically interact. This introduction of masks into social exchanges posed a potential challenge-how would people make these important inferences about others when a large source of information was no longer available? We conducted two studies that investigated the impact of mask exposure on emotion perception. In particular, we measured how participants used facial landmarks (visual cues) and the expressed valence and arousal (affective cues), to make similarity judgements about pairs of emotion faces. Study 1 found that in August 2020, participants with higher levels of mask exposure used cues from the eyes to a greater extent when judging emotion similarity than participants with less mask exposure. Study 2 measured participants' emotion perception in both April and September 2020 -before and after widespread mask adoption-in the same group of participants to examine changes in the use of facial cues over time. Results revealed an overall increase in the use of visual cues from April to September. Further, as mask exposure increased, people with the most social interaction showed the largest increase in the use of visual facial cues. These results provide evidence that a shift has occurred in how people process faces such that the more people are interacting with others that are wearing masks, the more they have learned to focus on visual cues from the eye area of the face."
https://openalex.org/W3205555089,"Single domain shark variable domain of new antigen receptor (VNAR) antibodies can offer a viable alternative to conventional Ig-based monoclonal antibodies in treating COVID-19 disease during the current pandemic. Here we report the identification of neutralizing single domain VNAR antibodies selected against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike protein derived from the Wuhan variant using phage display. We identified 56 unique binding clones that exhibited high affinity and specificity to the spike protein. Of those, 10 showed an ability to block both the spike protein receptor binding domain from the Wuhan variant and the N501Y mutant from interacting with recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in vitro. In addition, three antibody clones retained in vitro blocking activity when the E484K spike protein mutant was used. The inhibitory property of the VNAR antibodies was further confirmed for all 10 antibody clones using ACE2 expressing cells with spike protein from the Wuhan variant. The viral neutralizing potential of the VNAR clones was also confirmed for the 10 antibodies tested using live Wuhan variant virus in in vitro cell infectivity assays. Single domain VNAR antibodies, due to their low complexity, small size, unique epitope recognition, and formatting flexibility, should be a useful adjunct to existing antibody approaches to treat COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3133500593,"Psychiatric disorders constitute a major public health concern that are associated with substantial health and socioeconomic burden. Psychiatric patients may be more vulnerable to high temperatures, which under current climate change projections will most likely increase the burden of this public health concern.This study investigated the short-term association between ambient temperature and mental health hospitalizations in Bern, Switzerland.Daily hospitalizations for mental disorders between 1973 and 2017 were collected from the University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy in Bern. Population-weighted daily mean ambient temperatures were derived for the catchment area of the hospital from 2.3-km gridded weather maps. Conditional quasi-Poisson regression with distributed lag linear models were applied to assess the association up to three days after the exposure. Stratified analyses were conducted by age, sex, and subdiagnosis, and by subperiods (1973-1989 and 1990-2017). Additional subanalyses were performed to assess whether larger risks were found during the warm season or were due to heatwaves.The study included a total number of 88,996 hospitalizations. Overall, the hospitalization risk increased linearly by 4.0% (95% CI 2.0%, 7.0%) for every 10°C increase in mean daily temperature. No evidence of a nonlinear association or larger risks during the warm season or heatwaves was found. Similar estimates were found across for all sex and age categories, and larger risks were found for hospitalizations related to developmental disorders (29.0%; 95% CI 9.0%, 54.0%), schizophrenia (10.0%; 95% CI 4.0%, 15.0%), and for the later rather than the earlier period (5.0%; 95% CI 2.0%, 8.0% vs. 2.0%; 95% CI -3.0%, 8.0%).Our findings suggest that increasing temperatures could negatively affect mental status in psychiatric patients. Specific public health policies are urgently needed to protect this vulnerable population from the effects of climate change."
https://openalex.org/W3207857709,"Mammals use glabrous (hairless) skin of their hands and feet to navigate and manipulate their environment. Cortical maps of the body surface across species contain disproportionately large numbers of neurons dedicated to glabrous skin sensation, in part reflecting a higher density of mechanoreceptors that innervate these skin regions. Here, we find that disproportionate representation of glabrous skin emerges over postnatal development at the first synapse between peripheral mechanoreceptors and their central targets in the brainstem. Mechanoreceptor synapses undergo developmental refinement that depends on proximity of their terminals to glabrous skin, such that those innervating glabrous skin make synaptic connections that expand their central representation. In mice incapable of sensing gentle touch, mechanoreceptors innervating glabrous skin still make more powerful synapses in the brainstem. We propose that the skin region a mechanoreceptor innervates controls the developmental refinement of its central synapses to shape the representation of touch in the brain."

https://openalex.org/W3206620110,"We describe an approach to study the conformation of individual proteins during single particle tracking (SPT) in living cells. ""Binder/tag"" is based on incorporation of a 7-mer peptide (the tag) into a protein where its solvent exposure is controlled by protein conformation. Only upon exposure can the peptide specifically interact with a reporter protein (the binder). Thus, simple fluorescence localization reflects protein conformation. Through direct excitation of bright dyes, the trajectory and conformation of individual proteins can be followed. Simple protein engineering provides highly specific biosensors suitable for SPT and FRET. We describe tagSrc, tagFyn, tagSyk, tagFAK, and an orthogonal binder/tag pair. SPT showed slowly diffusing islands of activated Src within Src clusters and dynamics of activation in adhesions. Quantitative analysis and stochastic modeling revealed in vivo Src kinetics. The simplicity of binder/tag can provide access to diverse proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3206757772,"Sulfur mustard (SM) is a cytotoxic, vesicating, chemical warfare agent, first used in 1917; corneas are particularly vulnerable to SM exposure. They may develop inflammation, ulceration, neovascularization (NV), impaired vision, and partial/complete blindness depending upon the concentration of SM, exposure duration, and bio-physiological conditions of the eyes. Comprehensive in vivo studies have established ocular structural alterations, opacity, NV, and inflammation upon short durations (&lt;4 min) of SM exposure. In this study, detailed analyses of histopathological alterations in corneal structure, keratocytes, inflammatory cells, blood vessels, and expressions of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and cytokines were performed in New Zealand white rabbits, in a time-dependent manner till 28 days, post longer durations (5 and 7 min) of ocular SM exposure to establish quantifiable endpoints of injury and healing. Results indicated that SM exposure led to duration-dependent increases in corneal thickness, opacity, ulceration, epithelial-stromal separation, and epithelial degradation. Significant increases in NV, keratocyte death, blood vessels, and inflammatory markers (COX-2, MMP-9, VEGF, and interleukin-8) were also observed for both exposure durations compared to the controls. Collectively, these findings would benefit in temporal delineation of mechanisms underlying SM-induced corneal toxicity and provide models for testing therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3112647402,"Papaya ringspot virus biotype-P is a detrimental pathogen of economically important papaya and cucurbits worldwide. The mutation prone feature of this virus perhaps accounts for its geographical dissemination. In this study, investigations of the atypical PRSV-P strain was conducted based on phylogenetic, recombination and genetic differentiation analyses considering of it’s likely spread across India and Bangladesh. Full length genomic sequences of 38 PRSV isolates and 35 CP gene sequences were subjected to recombination analysis. A total of 61 recombination events were detected in aligned complete PRSV genome sequences. 3 events were detected in complete genome of PRSV strain PK whereas one was in its CP gene sequence. The PRSV-PK appeared to be recombinant of a major parent from Bangladesh. However, the genetic differentiation based on full length genomic sequences revealed less frequent gene flow between virus PRSV-PK and the population from America, India, Colombia, other Asian Countries and Australia. Whereas, frequent gene flow exists between Pakistan and Bangladesh virus populations. These results provided evidence correlating geographical position and genetic distances. We speculate that the genetic variations and evolutionary dynamics of this virus may challenge the resistance developed in papaya against PRSV and give rise to virus lineage because of its atypical emergence where geographic spread is already occurring."
https://openalex.org/W3205865159,"Consumer demand for commercially prepared plant-based (PB) dog food is increasing, but studies evaluating the short- or long-term effects of PB diets on canine health are lacking. The objective of this study was to assess the short-term amino acid (AA), clinicopathologic, and echocardiographic findings in 34 client-owned dogs fed a commercial extruded plant-based diet (PBD) in which pea protein was the primary protein source and 4 control dogs fed a commercial extruded traditional diet (TD). Plasma AA and whole blood taurine concentrations were measured in dogs at baseline and after 4 weeks on the PBD or the TD. Hematologic, serum biochemical, and echocardiographic testing were performed at baseline and after 12 weeks on the PBD or the TD. Four dogs in the PBD group did not complete the study. All essential AAs, except methionine, were higher in dogs after 4 weeks on the PBD compared to baseline. Taurine (plasma and whole blood) was also higher after 4 weeks on the PBD compared to baseline. A meaningful difference was detected in whole blood taurine between the PBD group and the control group at 4 weeks (P = .026) with the PBD group being higher. Median hematologic and biochemical results for the PBD group were within normal limits at baseline and at 12 weeks. In the PBD group, left ventricular internal diastolic dimension (LVIDd, P = < .001) and normalized LVIDd (P = .031) were higher 12 weeks post-PBD compared to baseline. There were no meaningful differences in left ventricular internal systolic dimension (LVIDs), normalized LVIDs, or fractional shortening 12 weeks post-PBD. There was no statistical evidence of difference between the 2 groups of dogs for any of the echocardiographic parameters at baseline or at 12 weeks. Essential AA or taurine deficiency was not observed in this cohort of dogs fed a commercial extruded PBD. Additionally, clinically relevant hematologic, serum biochemical and echocardiographic alterations were not detected. Further research is required to determine if long-term static feeding of PB diets can meet and maintain AA and other nutrient targets in dogs."
https://openalex.org/W3205996504,"Decontaminating N95 respirators for reuse could mitigate shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the United States Center for Disease Control has identified Ultraviolet-C irradiation as one of the most promising methods for N95 decontamination, very few studies have evaluated the efficacy of Ultraviolet-C for SARS-CoV-2 inactivation. In addition, most decontamination studies are performed using mask coupons that do not recapitulate the complexity of whole masks. We sought to directly evaluate the efficacy of Ultraviolet-C mediated inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 on N95 respirators. To that end we created a portable UV-C light-emitting diode disinfection chamber and tested decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 at different sites on two models of N95 respirator. We found that decontamination efficacy depends on mask model, material and location of the contamination on the mask. Our results emphasize the need for caution when interpreting efficacy data of UV-C decontamination methods."
https://openalex.org/W3205974413,"The Nedd4 family contains several structurally related but functionally distinct HECT-type ubiquitin ligases. The members of the Nedd4 family are known to recognize substrates through their multiple WW domains, which recognize PY motifs (PPxY, LPxY) or phospho-threonine or phospho-serine residues. To better understand protein interactor recognition mechanisms across the Nedd4 family, we report the development and implementation of a python-based tool, PxYFinder, to identify PY motifs in the primary sequences of previously identified interactors of Nedd4 and related ligases. Using PxYFinder, we find that, on average, half of Nedd4 family interactions are likely PY-motif mediated. Further, we find that PPxY motifs are more prevalent than LPxY motifs and are more likely to occur in proline-rich regions and that PPxY regions are more disordered on average relative to LPxY-containing regions. Informed by consensus sequences for PY motifs across the Nedd4 interactome, we rationally designed a focused peptide library and employed a computational screen, revealing sequence- and biomolecular interaction-dependent determinants of WW-domain/PY-motif interactions. Cumulatively, our efforts provide a new bioinformatic tool and expand our understanding of sequence and structural factors that contribute to PY-motif mediated interactor recognition across the Nedd4 family."
https://openalex.org/W3207640860,"Copy number alterations are crucial for gastric cancer (GC) development. In this study, Tocopherol alpha transfer protein-like (TTPAL) was identified to be highly amplified in our primary GC cohort (30/86). Multivariate analysis showed that high TTPAL expression was correlated with the poor prognosis of GC patients. Ectopic expression of TTPAL promoted GC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and promoted murine xenograft tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo. Conversely, silencing of TTPAL exerted significantly opposite effects in vitro. Moreover, RNA-sequencing and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) followed by liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) identified that TTPAL exerted oncogenic functions via the interaction of Nicotinamide-N-methyl transferase (NNMT) and activated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Collectively, TTPAL plays a pivotal oncogenic role in gastric carcinogenesis through promoting PI3K/AKT pathway via cooperating with NNMT. TTPAL may serve as a prognostic biomarker of patients with GC."

We develop a dataset of illegal wildlife trade prices and combine it with seizure data to estimate the economic value of illegal wildlife trade entering the USA. Using 2013 as a reference year, the results reveal that the economic value of illegal wildlife trade entering the USA was, using a conservative scenario where potential outliers were excluded, US$3.2 billion/year (uncertainty range (UR) 5th and 95th percentile of US$0.6-8.2 billion/year) and, without excluding potential outliers, US$4.3 billion/year (UR of US$1.3-9.6 billion/year). Our results for the USA alone are of a comparable magnitude to the lower bound of commonly used global estimates of the economic value of IWT of uncertain origin, suggesting that the global economic value of IWT is currently underestimated and requires an urgent revision."
https://openalex.org/W3205703867,"Vascular remodeling is a prominent trait during the development of hypertension, attributable to the phenotypic transition of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Increasing studies demonstrate that microRNA plays an important role in this process. Here, we surprisingly found that smooth muscle cell-specific miR-214 knockout (miR-214 cKO) significantly alleviates angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertension, which has the same effect as that of miR-214 global knockout mice in response to Ang II stimulation. Under the treatment of Ang II, miR-214 cKO mice exhibit substantially reduced systolic blood pressure. The vascular medial thickness and area in miR-214 cKO blood vessels were obviously reduced, the expression of collagen I and proinflammatory factors were also inhibited. VSMC-specific deletion of miR-214 blunts the response of blood vessels to the stimulation of endothelium-dependent and -independent vasorelaxation and phenylephrine and 5-HT induced vasocontraction. In vitro, Ang II-induced VSMC proliferation, migration, contraction, hypertrophy, and stiffness were all repressed with miR-214 KO in VSMC. To further explore the mechanism of miR-214 in the regulation of the VSMC function, it is very interesting to find that the TGF-β signaling pathway is mostly enriched in miR-214 KO VSMC. Smad7, the potent negative regulator of the TGF-β/Smad pathway, is identified to be the target of miR-214 in VSMC. By which, miR-214 KO sharply enhances Smad7 levels and decreases the phosphorylation of Smad3, and accordingly alleviates the downstream gene expression. Further, Ang II-induced hypertension and vascular dysfunction were reversed by antagomir-214. These results indicate that miR-214 in VSMC established a crosstalk between Ang II-induced AT1R signaling and TGF-β induced TβRI /Smad signaling, by which it exerts a pivotal role in vascular remodeling and hypertension and imply that miR-214 has the potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment of hypertension."

We assessed the effectiveness of health education sessions and home support programs in reducing blood pressure among patients with uncontrolled hypertension in a suburban community of Nepal.We conducted a community-based, open-level, parallel-group, cluster randomized controlled trial in Birendranagar municipality of Surkhet, Nepal. We randomly assigned four clusters (wards) into intervention and control arms. We provided four health education sessions, frequent home and usual care for intervention groups over six months. The participants of the control arm received only usual care from health facilities. The primary outcome of this study was the proportion of controlled systolic blood pressure (SBP). The analysis included all participants who completed follow-up at six months.125 participants were assigned to either the intervention (n = 63) or the control (n = 62) group. Of them, 60 participants in each group completed six months follow-up. The proportion of controlled SBP was significantly higher among the intervention participants compared to the control (58.3% vs. 40%). Odds ratio of this was 2.1 with 95% CI: 1.01-4.35 (p = 0.046) and that of controlled diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was 1.31 (0.63-2.72) (p = 0.600). The mean change (follow-up minus baseline) in SBP was significantly higher in the intervention than in the usual care (-18.7 mmHg vs. -11.2 mmHg, p = 0.041). Such mean change of DBP was also higher in the intervention (-10.95 mmHg vs. -5.53 mmHg, p = 0.065). The knowledge score on hypertension improved by 2.38 (SD 2.4) in the intervention arm, which was significantly different from that of the control group, 0.13 (1.8) (p<0.001).Multiple health education sessions complemented by frequent household visits by health volunteers can effectively improve knowledge on hypertension and reduce blood pressure among uncontrolled hypertensive patients at the community level in Nepal.ClinicalTrial.gov: NCT02981251."
https://openalex.org/W3206918361,"Formation of mature miRNAs and their expression is a highly controlled process. It is very much dependent upon the post-transcriptional regulatory events. Recent findings suggest that several RNA binding proteins beyond Drosha/Dicer are involved in the processing of miRNAs. Deciphering of conditional networks for these RBP-miRNA interactions may help to reason the spatio-temporal nature of miRNAs which can also be used to predict miRNA profiles. In this direction, >25TB of data from different platforms were studied (CLIP-seq/RNA-seq/miRNA-seq) to develop Bayesian causal networks capable of reasoning miRNA biogenesis. The networks ably explained the miRNA formation when tested across a large number of conditions and experimentally validated data. The networks were modeled into an XGBoost machine learning system where expression information of the network components was found capable to quantitatively explain the miRNAs formation levels and their profiles. The models were developed for 1,204 human miRNAs whose accurate expression level could be detected directly from the RNA-seq data alone without any need of doing separate miRNA profiling experiments like miRNA-seq or arrays. A first of its kind, miRbiom performed consistently well with high average accuracy (91%) when tested across a large number of experimentally established data from several conditions. It has been implemented as an interactive open access web-server where besides finding the profiles of miRNAs, their downstream functional analysis can also be done. miRbiom will help to get an accurate prediction of human miRNAs profiles in the absence of profiling experiments and will be an asset for regulatory research areas. The study also shows the importance of having RBP interaction information in better understanding the miRNAs and their functional projectiles where it also lays the foundation of such studies and software in future."

Young adult never hookah users at the first wave of adult participation in PATH waves 1-3 (2013-2016) were followed-up into waves 2-4 (2014-2017) to estimate the age of initiation of three outcomes: (i) ever use, (ii) past 30-day use, and (iii) fairly regular hookah use. Weighted interval-censoring Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine the differences in the estimated age of initiation by sex and by race/ethnicity while controlling for the total number of other tobacco products ever used at participants' first wave of PATH participation. In addition, to examine if prior use of other tobacco products was associated with the age of hookah initiation behaviors, six additional Cox models are reported for each hookah initiation behaviors.The largest increase in hookah use occurred between ages 18 and 19: 5.8% for ever use and 2.7% for past 30-day hookah use. By age 21, 10.5%, 4.7% and 1.2% reported initiation of ever, past 30-day and fairly regular hookah use, respectively. There were statistically significance differences in the age of initiation of hookah use behaviors by race/ethnicity.Educational interventions should target young adults before the age of 21, focusing efforts specifically on males, non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics, to stall initiation and progression of hookah use behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W3206158190,"In the analysis of complex historical layering, studies on how to avoid theoretical analysis and use quantitative methods of display and analysis are scarce. Therefore, we used space syntax to fill this gap in historical layering analysis. We established a spatial digital model by combining the urban historical landscape theory with the space syntax analysis method. Then, we quantitatively analysed the streetscapes in the four historical periods of Macau and the value-related development of the city's economy, society, and culture. To this end, we used the theory of urban historical landscape to interpret the streetscape of Macau. We reviewed urban development under different spatial scales, which represent different states of historical layering. Changing ideological trends of construction have induced changes in the city, which have led to changes in the city style. The analysis considers the dimensions of space and time, and its results can guide the continued benign growth of the urban landscape and solve protection problems in practice. Meanwhile, the results of this work also indicate that the unique streetscape of Macau bred by the development of the city does not affect the newly constructed roads. The newly reclaimed areas and the streetscape of the new city are on the verge of homogeneity and cannot reflect the unique regional characteristics of Macau. Therefore, we used the historical map of Macau as a carrier, used space syntax to analyse the structure of Macau's streetscape, and explored the apparent characteristics and value associations carried by the streetscape of Macau under different historical slices. Our results can help retrieve the value of Macau's historical streetscape and devise a targeted protection strategy that can help pass on the historical streetscape of Macau to posterity."

The aim of this study was to relate metabolic changes with IAV susceptibility using well-characterized inbred mouse models. We compared the highly susceptible DBA/2J (D2) mouse strain for which IAV infection is lethal with the C57BL/6J (B6) strain, which exhibits a moderate course of disease and survives IAV infection. Previous studies showed that D2 has higher insulin and glucose levels and is predisposed to develop diet-induced type 2 diabetes. Using high-resolution liquid chromatography-coupled MS, the plasma metabolomes of individual animals were repeatedly measured up to 30 days postinfection. The biggest metabolic difference between these strains in healthy and infected states was in the levels of malonylcarnitine, which was consistently increased 5-fold in D2. Other interstrain and intrastrain differences in healthy and infected animals were observed for acylcarnitines, glucose, branched-chain amino acids, and oxidized fatty acids. By mapping metabolic changes to canonical pathways, we found that mitochondrial beta-oxidation is likely disturbed in D2 animals. In noninfected D2 mice, this leads to increased glycerolipid production and reduced acylcarnitine production, whereas in infected D2 animals, peroxisomal beta-oxidation becomes strongly increased. From these studies, we conclude that metabolic changes caused by a distortion of mitochondrial and peroxisomal metabolism might impact the innate immune response in D2, leading to high viral titers and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3207661578,"Freezing of gait (FOG) is an intermittent walking disturbance experienced by people with Parkinson's disease (PD). Wearable FOG identification systems can improve gait and reduce the risk of falling due to FOG by detecting FOG in real-time and providing a cue to reduce freeze duration. However, FOG prediction and prevention is desirable. Datasets used to train machine learning models often generate ground truth FOG labels based on visual observation of specific lower limb movements (event-based definition) or an overall inability to walk effectively (period of gait disruption based definition). FOG definition ambiguity may affect model performance, especially with respect to multiple FOG in rapid succession. This research examined whether merging multiple freezes that occurred in rapid succession could improve FOG detection and prediction model performance. Plantar pressure and lower limb acceleration data were used to extract a feature set and train decision tree ensembles. FOG was labeled using an event-based definition. Additional datasets were then produced by merging FOG that occurred in rapid succession. A merging threshold was introduced where FOG that were separated by less than the merging threshold were merged into one episode. FOG detection and prediction models were trained for merging thresholds of 0, 1, 2, and 3 s. Merging slightly improved FOG detection model performance; however, for the prediction model, merging resulted in slightly later FOG identification and lower precision. FOG prediction models may benefit from using event-based FOG definitions and avoiding merging multiple FOG in rapid succession."

We aimed to identify the sex- and age-related normal reference ranges for left ventricular (LV) myocardial mass values, volumetric and functional parameters and the correspondence of these parameters using the TB method.Healthy European adults (n = 200, age: 39.4 ± 12 years, males: 100) were examined with CMR and evaluated with a TB postprocessing method. They were stratified by sex and age (Group A: 18-29, Group B: 30-39, Group C: 40-49, Group D: >50 years). The calculated parameters were indexed to body surface area (i).The normal reference ranges for the studied parameters were assessed in each age group. Significant biometric differences in LV parameters and mass-to-volume ratios were found between males and females, and the left ventricular compacted myocardial mass (LVCMi) and TPMi differences remained significant after stratification by age. Unlike other LV volumetric and functional parameters and mass-to-volume ratios, the TPMi, the LVCMi and the TPMi-to-LVCMi ratio did not differ among age groups in males or females. This finding was strengthened by the lack of correlation between TPMi and age.Age- and sex-related normal reference ranges for LV volumetric and functional parameters and LVCMi and TPMi values were established using a TB postprocessing method. TPMi, LVCMi and their ratio did not change over time. The TPMi-to-LVCMi and the mass-to-volume ratios might have clinical utility in the differential diagnosis of conditions with LV hypertrabeculation."

This study sought to analyze current data on antenatal care (ANC), intranatal care (INC), and postnatal care (PNC) utilization with a focus on mothers aged 15-24 years in Indonesia.This study was a secondary analysis of data from the 2017 Indonesian Demographic and Health Survey. The unit data analyzed 2,584 mothers aged 15-24 years who had delivered babies within the five-year period preceding the survey. Bivariate analysis and multiple logistic regression utilizing descriptive statistics were used to explore correlations between the independent variables and ANC, INC, and PNC visits.Among the mothers included in the study, the prevalence of service utilization was 90.9% for ANC, 79.4% for INC, and 68.9% for PNC. Women's age, education level, number and birth order of children, difference in age between the mother and her husband, her husband's occupation, wealth index, access to the health service, and regional factors were significantly associated with the utilization of ANC, INC, and PNC services.This study provides insights for policymakers on how to strengthen healthcare policies and laws with the aim to improve maternal healthcare services for mothers aged 15-24 years. To improve maternal healthcare utilization among young mothers, national policy should focus on service equality, accessibility, and reliable implementation."
https://openalex.org/W3205782073,"In this study we present new evidence from phytolith studies for the presence of Sabal sp . (likely minor ), an allochthonous plant, around Tesuque Creek in northern New Mexico during the early part of the Late Holocene, in the vicinity of known Late Archaic hunter-gatherer communities using the area at that time. We analyzed phytoliths from sediments taken from an alluvial section on the east side of Tesuque Creek dating to c. 3600–2400 cal. BP. The phytoliths demonstrated a change over time from a succulent dominated landscape to a shrubby one, with the later introduction of high densities of palmetto phytoliths associated with marshy deposits and adjacent burn levels. This evidence suggests a more diverse resource landscape available to local hunter-gatherer groups than previously understood, and may have implications for the early management of microenvironments, plant communities. This evidence demonstrates the value of phytolith analysis from alluvial sections for understanding human land and plant use practices over time. Our study provides a new perspective on what resources and land use areas were available for Archaic peoples inhabiting the area, and how they may have experimented with managing lesser known types of wild plant resources before the establishment of the triad of crops from Mesoamerica. This opens up new avenues for understanding the landscapes, land use practices, and environmental impacts of pre-agricultural communities in the northern Rio Grande and in other semi-arid environments worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W3205878668,"Opioid misuse is a public health crisis in the United States. The origin of this crisis is associated with a sharp increase in opioid analgesic prescribing. We used the urban scaling framework to analyze opioid prescribing patterns in US commuting zones (CZs), i.e., groups of counties based on commuting patterns. The urban scaling framework postulates that a set of scaling relations can be used to predict health outcomes and behaviors in cities. We used data from the Drug Enforcement Administration's Automated Reports and Consolidated Ordering System (ARCOS) to calculate counts of oxycodone/hydrocodone pills distributed to 607 CZs in the continental US from 2006 to 2014. We estimated the scaling coefficient of opioid pill counts by regressing log(pills) on log(population) using a piecewise linear spline with a single knot at 82,363. Our results show that CZs with populations below the knot scaled superlinearly (β = 1.36), i.e., larger CZs had disproportionally larger pill counts compared to smaller CZs. On the other hand, CZs with populations above the knot scaled sublinearly (β = 0.92), i.e., larger CZs had disproportionally smaller pill counts compared to smaller CZs. This dual scaling pattern was consistent across US census regions. For CZs with population below the knot, the superlinear scaling of pills is consistent with the explanation that an increased number of successful matches between prescribers and users will lead to higher prescribing rates. The non-linear scaling behavior observed could be the result of a combination of factors, including stronger health care systems and prescribing regulation in largely populated commuting zones, as well as high availability of other opioids such as heroin in these commuting zones. Future research should explore potential mechanisms for the non-linearity of prescription opioid pills."
https://openalex.org/W3206420729,"Although culture-based methods remain a staple element of microbiology analysis, advanced molecular methods increasingly supplement the testing repertoire. Since the advent of 16s and 18s ribosomal RNA PCR in the 2000s, there has been interest in its utility for pathogen detection. Nonetheless, studies assessing the impact on antimicrobial prescribing are limited. We report a single-centre experience of the influence of 16s and 18s PCR testing on antimicrobial treatment, including a cost-analysis.Data were collected retrospectively for all samples sent for 16s and 18s PCR testing between January 2014 and December 2020. Results were compared to any culture-based result. Assessment focused on any change of antimicrobial treatment based on PCR result, or use of the result as supportive evidence for microbiological diagnosis.310 samples relevant to 268 patients were referred for 16s/18s rRNA PCR testing during the period. Culture was performed for 234 samples. Enrichment culture was performed for 83 samples. 82 of 300 samples sent for 16s PCR had positive results (20.8%). When culture was performed, enrichment reduced the outcome of 16s PCR only positive results (4/36 [11.1%] versus 14/35 [40.0%], p = 0.030 where a pathogen found). 18s PCR yielded 9 positive results from 67 samples. The 16s PCR result influenced antimicrobial change for 6 patients (2.2%). We estimated the cost for 16s PCR testing to result in one significant change in antimicrobial therapy to be €3,340. 18s PCR did not alter antimicrobial treatment.There was limited impact of 16s PCR results on antimicrobial treatments. Relevance to practice was affected by relatively long turn-around-time for results. Utility may be increased in specialised surgical centres, or by reducing turn-around-time. Enrichment culture should be considered on samples where 16s PCR is requested. There remains limited evidence for use of 18s PCR in clinical management, and further studies in this area are likely warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3206915405,"Interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 are composite cytokines consisting of p35/p40 and p19/p40, respectively, which signal via the common IL-12 receptor β1 (IL-12Rβ1) and the cytokine-specific receptors IL-12Rβ2 and IL-23R. Previous data showed that the p40 component interacts with IL-12Rβ1, whereas p19 and p35 subunits solely bind to IL-23R and IL-12Rβ2, resulting in tetrameric signaling complexes. In the absence of p19 and p35, p40 forms homodimers and may induce signaling via IL-12Rβ1 homodimers. The critical amino acids of p19 and p35 required for binding to IL-23R and IL-12Rβ2 are known, and two regions of p40 critical for binding to IL-12Rβ1 have recently been identified. In order to characterize the involvement of the N-terminal region of p40 in binding to IL-12Rβ1, we generated deletion variants of the p40-p19 fusion cytokine. We found that an N-terminal deletion variant missing amino acids M23 to P39 failed to induce IL-23-dependent signaling and did not bind to IL-12Rβ1, whereas binding to IL-23R was maintained. Amino acid replacements showed that p40W37K largely abolished IL-23-induced signal transduction and binding to IL-12Rβ1, but not binding to IL-23R. Combining p40W37K with D36K and T38K mutations eliminated the biological activity of IL-23. Finally, homodimeric p40D36K/W37K/T38K did not interact with IL-12Rβ1, indicating binding of homodimeric p40 to IL-12Rβ1 is comparable to the interaction of IL-23/IL-12 and IL-12Rβ1. In summary, we have defined D36, W37, and T38 as hotspot amino acids for the interaction of IL-12/IL-23 p40 with IL-12Rβ1. Structural insights into cytokine-cytokine receptor binding are important to develop novel therapeutic strategies."

Treatment of SLB is not fully established and we wanted to evaluate if infectious diseases specialist consultation (IDSC) would improve management and prognosis.Multicenter retrospective study of SLB patients followed for 1 year. Patients were stratified according to bedside (formal), telephone (informal) or lack of IDSC within 7 days of SLB diagnosis.Altogether, 104 SLB patients were identified: 24% received formal bedside and 52% informal telephone IDSC whereas 24% were managed without any IDSC. No differences in demographics, underlying conditions or severity of illness were observed between the groups. Patients with bedside IDSC, compared to telephone IDSC or lack of IDSC, had transthoracic echocardiography more often performed (odds ratio [OR] 4.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31-12.2; p = 0.012) and (OR 16.0; 95% CI, 4.00-63.9; P<0.001). Bedside IDSC was associated with more deep infections diagnosed compared to telephone IDSC (OR, 7.44; 95% CI, 2.58-21.4; p<0.001) or lack of IDSC (OR, 9.56; 95% CI, 2.43-37.7; p = 0.001). The overall mortality was 7%, 10% and 17% at 28 days, 90 days and 1 year, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W3207800802,"Our study takes advantage of unique data to quantify deficits in the psychosocial and cognitive resources of an extremely vulnerable subpopulation–those experiencing housing vulnerability–in an advanced, high-income country (Australia). Groups such as these are often impossible to study using nationally representative data sources because they make up a small share of the overall population. We show that those experiencing housing vulnerability sleep less well, have more limited cognitive functioning, and less social capital than do those in the general population. They are also less emotionally stable, less conscientious, more external, and more risk tolerant. Collectively, these deficits in psychosocial and cognitive resources account for between 24–42% of their reduced life satisfaction and their increased mental distress and loneliness. These traits also account for a large proportion of the gap in mental wellbeing across different levels of housing vulnerability."
https://openalex.org/W3205322559,"Cholinergic neurons utilize choline (Ch) to synthetize acetylcholine (ACh) and contain a high-affinity Ch transporter, Ch acetyltransferase (ChAT), ACh receptors, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). As the depletion or malfunction of each component of the cholinergic system has been reported in patients with dementia, many studies have sought to evaluate whether treatment candidates affect each of the cholinergic components. The associated changes in the cholinergic components may be reflected by intra- or extra-cellular ACh levels, with an increase in extracellular ACh levels occurring following AChE inhibition. We hypothesized that increases in intracellular ACh levels can be more sensitively detected than those in extracellular ACh levels, thereby capturing subtle effects in the cholinergic components other than AChE. The objective of this study was to test this hypothesis.We developed an in vitro model to measure both extracellular and intracellular ACh levels using the human cholinergic neuroblastoma cell line, LA-N-2, which have been reported to express Ch transporter, ChAT, muscarinic ACh receptor (mAChR), and AChE. With this model, we evaluated several drug compounds and food constituents reported to improve cholinergic function through various mechanisms. In addition, we conducted western blotting to identify the subtype of mAChR that is expressed on the cell line.Our cell-based assay system was capable of detecting increases in extracellular ACh levels induced by an AChE inhibitor at relatively high doses, as well as increases in intracellular ACh levels following the administration of lower AChE-inhibitor doses and an mAChR agonist. Moreover, increases in intracellular ACh levels were observed even after treatment with food constituents that have different mechanisms of action, such as Ch provision and ChAT activation. In addition, we revealed that LA-N-2 cells expressed mAChR M2.The findings support our hypothesis and indicate that the developed assay model can broadly screen compounds from drugs to food ingredients, with varying strengths and mechanisms of action, to develop treatments for ACh-relevant phenomena, including dementia and aging-related cognitive decline."

Sand flies were collected monthly from May 2018 to April 2019 using automatic light traps for 3 consecutive nights. Eight houses were selected as sample points due its previous reports of tegumentary leishmaniasis and/or canine leishmaniasis. The sand fly's fauna found on the present study it's represented by several medical importance species and the most abundant species found were Lutzomyia longipalpis (77.09%) and Nyssomyia intermedia (10.06%). Leishmania infantum DNA was detected in a pool of Lu. longipalpis resulting on a 2.81% of infection rate. By the frequency of the two most abundant species on this study, we developed a risk area map and it draws attention to sample point 6 due to disparate abundance of sand flies at this site (81.81%). Statistical overview shows Lu. longipalpis as dominant species and, still, Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling analysis reveal high similarity on fauna's diversity on the study area. Our findings suggest that the diversity of sand flies from the municipality of Lassance may promote the circulation of Leishmania infantum parasites putting in risk the habitants and other mammal's species. Still, our study reinforces the necessity of specific studies focused on breed sites of phlebotomine and its' ecology to expand the knowledge about the behaviour of this group of insects applying directly to leishmaniases' epidemiology."
https://openalex.org/W3205439486,"Rano Raraku, the crater lake constrained by basaltic tuff that served as the primary quarry used to construct the moai statues on Rapa Nui (Easter Island), has experienced fluctuations in lake level over the past centuries. As one of the only freshwater sources on the island, understanding the present and past geochemical characteristics of the lake water is critical to understand if the lake could have been a viable freshwater source for Rapa Nui. At the time of sampling in September 2017, the maximum lake depth was ~1 m. The lake level has substantially declined in the subsequent years, with the lake drying almost completely in January 2018. The lake is currently characterized by highly anoxic conditions, with a predominance of ammonium ions on nitrates, a high concentration of organic carbon in the water-sediment interface and reducing conditions of the lake, as evidenced by Mn/Fe and Cr/V ratios. Our estimates of past salinity inferred from the chloride mass balance indicates that it was unlikely that Rano Raraku provided a viable freshwater source for early Rapa Nui people. The installation of an outlet pipe around 1950 that was active until the late 1970s, as well as grazing of horses on the lake margins appear to have significantly impacted the geochemical conditions of Rano Raraku sediments and lake water in recent decades. Such impacts are distinct from natural environmental changes and highlight the need to consider the sensitivity of the lake geochemistry to human activities."
https://openalex.org/W3205876450,"We examined the detailed behavioral characteristics of transfer of skill and the ability of the adaptive control of thought rational (ACT-R) architecture to account for this with its new Controller module. We employed a simple action video game called Auto Orbit and investigated the control tuning of timing skills across speed perturbations of the environment. In Auto Orbit, players needed to learn to alternate turn and shot actions to blow and burst balloons under time constraints imposed by balloon resets and deflations. Cognitive and motor skill transfer was assessed both in terms of game performance and in terms of the details of their motor actions. We found that skill transfer across speeds necessitated the recalibration of action timing skills. In addition, we found that acquiring skill in Auto Orbit involved a progressive decrease in variability of behavior. Finally, we found that players with higher skill levels tended to be less variable in terms of action chunking and action timing. These findings further shed light on the complex cognitive and motor mechanisms of skill transfer across speeds in complex task environments."
https://openalex.org/W3207425433,"Parenting programmes help to alleviate conduct problems in children, but ensuring that all parents feel supported to attend, complete and learn from these programmes has proven difficult. Parents can feel overwhelmed and struggle to change their parenting. This article aims to inform the future refinement of parenting programmes by examining parents' narratives of how programmes motivated them to change and enabled them to put changes into practice.Forty-two parents, most of whom had attended Incredible Years group sessions, were interviewed about their views and experiences of parenting programmes that focused on positive parenting practices. Analysis of interview transcripts drew on thematic approaches. Parents perceived that parenting programmes helped them to better understand their child and themselves and to let go of anxieties surrounding their child's behaviour. Better understanding included greater awareness of emotions and of behaviours their child could and could not control. Parents believed this awareness helped them to change the ways that they interacted with their child, which, in turn, helped them and their child to feel calmer. With greater understanding and calmness parents believed they became more able to see for themselves the changes that they could make in their parenting and everyday lives, and to feel more confident in putting these into practice.By supporting parents to reflect on their own and their child's situation, parents perceived that programmes enabled them to improve interactions with their children without getting stuck in self-blame or feeling overwhelmed. Parents of children whose behaviour remained challenging believed that programmes led to beneficial changes in the way they felt about their child's behaviours. Enhanced support for reflection by parents could potentially help more families to benefit from parenting programmes."

https://openalex.org/W3205595278,"Background Despite significant public health intervention, maternal mortality remains high in low- and middle-income countries, including Ethiopia. Effective postnatal care is a critical service to reduce maternal mortality. In Ethiopia, only 17% of mothers received postnatal care services in 2016. Objective This study examined the association between antenatal care and timely postnatal care checkup among reproductive-age women in Ethiopia. Methods The study used the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey data. The current study included 4,081 women who give birth in the two years preceding the survey. Chi-square test and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between antenatal care and timely initiation of postnatal care. Results Postnatal care services within 2 days of delivery were received by 16.5% of women. Women who had at least four timely antenatal care visits had higher odds of timely postnatal checkups compared to women who had no antenatal care [adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR): 2.50; 95% CI 1.42–4.42]. Women who had at least four antennal care visits without timely initiation also had higher odds of postnatal check-up than their counterparts (aOR: 2.46; 95%CI: 1.22–4.97). Other factors significantly associated with timely initiation of PNC were secondary and above education (aOR: 1.64; 95%CI: 1.03–2.60), perceived distance to the nearby health facility as a significant barrier (aOR: 1.55; 95%CI: 1.15–2.09), primiparous (aOR: 0.34; 95%CI: 0.19–0.61) and institutional delivery (aOR: 14.55; 95%CI: 2.21–95.77). Conclusion The prevalence of timely initiation of postnatal care in Ethiopia is very low. Women who received recommended antenatal care services had higher odds of timely initiation of postnatal care. Thus, strengthening the existing maternal and child health programs to adhere to the recommended ANC care guidelines may improve the timely initiation of postnatal care."
https://openalex.org/W3205859303,"Particulate matter (PM) is considered the most severe environmental pollution problem due to its serious effects on human health associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In this work, a physicochemical characterization of PM10 from the city of Medellin was developed. The results evince that lead (Pb) is one of the most abundant elements since it is present in all analyzed samples. Therefore, Pb was chosen to perform an in-silico study to assess its effects on atrial arrhythmias generation. For this purpose, we developed a model representing the Pb2+ blocking effect on the L-type calcium channel. This formulation was incorporated in a human atrial cell mathematical model and in 2D and 3D models of human atria. The simulations showed a proarrhythmic effect at high Pb2+ concentrations, through shortening of action potential duration inducing the generation of reentrant activity and atrial flutter. The results contribute to the knowledge about the cardiac physiopathological processes, triggered by lead as one of the main PM10 metal components of air pollution, that yields the generation of arrhythmias."
https://openalex.org/W3206475033,"Soccer participation in the United States (U.S.) has increased over time, and injuries as well as interest to prevent injuries has become more common. This study described Emergency Department (ED) visits related to concussions, intracranial injuries (ICI), and all-other injuries attributed to soccer play; described healthcare cost and length of hospital stay of soccer-related injuries; and determined independent predictors of concussions, ICI, and all-other soccer injuries leading to ED visits. The study examined soccer-related weighted discharge data from the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Weighted tabular analysis of univariate and bivariate analyses and weighted and adjusted logistic regression models were conducted. A total of 480,580 of U.S. ED visits related to soccer injuries were available for analysis between 2010 to 2013. Generally, 98% of soccer-related ED visits resulted in routine (treat-and-release) visits. However, the odds of transfer to a short-term hospital following ED evaluation and treatment was more than 37-fold higher for soccer-injured youth and adults diagnosed with ICI when compared to all-other soccer injuries; additionally, these patients showed 28-fold higher odds of being admitted for inpatient care at the ED-affiliated hospital. For concussion, soccer-injured patients with concussion showed nearly 1.5-fold higher odds of being transferred to a short-term hospital than did those with any other soccer injury. Soccer-related ED visits cost more than 700 million in U.S. dollars from 2010 to 2013. Notable differences were noted between concussions, ICI, and all-other soccer injuries presenting to U.S. ED. Albeit underestimated given that this study excludes other forms of health care and treatment for injuries, such as outpatient clinics, over the counter medications and treatment, and rehabilitation, healthcare cost associated with soccer-related injuries presenting to ED is high, and remarkably costly in those with an ICI diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W3206618010,"Lyme disease (LD) is an emerging public health threat in Canada, associated with the northward range expansion of the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis). To address this, public health authorities have been carrying out surveillance activities and awareness campaigns targeting vulnerable populations such as outdoor workers. Implementing these measures is time-consuming and resource-intensive, prompting the assessment of alternatives. Our goal was to evaluate the feasibility and implementation of a training-of-trainers-inspired approach in raising awareness about LD risk and prevention among workers and general population, as well as to evaluate its potential to contribute to provincial LD surveillance efforts. We trained a group of workers from publicly-accessible outdoor parks of the province of Québec to become ""LD education ambassadors"". Ambassadors were trained to raise tick and LD awareness, share information on preventive measures in their respective communities, and lead tick sampling activities using a standardised protocol similar to that used by Public Health authorities. Ambassador-led outreach activities, public reach, sampling activities and collected ticks were documented, as well as ambassadors' satisfaction with the training using forms and semi-structured interviews. In total, 18 ambassadors from 12 organizations were trained. Between June and September 2019, they led 28 independent outreach activities, reaching over 1 860 individuals (from occupational and general public settings) in seven public health units. Ambassadors led 28 tick samplings, together collecting 11 I. scapularis ticks. This study suggests that an adapted training-of-trainers is a feasible approach to raising tick and LD risk awareness among Québec outdoor workers and public. Trained ambassadors have the potential of reaching a large portion of the population visiting or working in outdoor parks while also providing much-needed outreach regarding risk and prevention. Pushing this concept further to include other types of workers and jurisdictions may contribute to national LD surveillance efforts."
https://openalex.org/W3207335009,"To assess the relationship between time-of-day of exercise training and changes in relevant cancer health outcomes among cancer survivors.Retrospective analysis of data collected from 2016-2019 from a hospital-based exercise oncology program. Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographic, clinical, and exercise timing characteristics (e.g. AM, PM, or mix) among survivors with available data for exercise training time (n = 233). For the total sample and a breast cancer sub-analysis, univariate analysis of covariance, adjusted for age, was carried out by exercise training time, for change in the following outcomes collected during the program's assessment sessions: cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular endurance (human performance variables), physical function, anthropometrics, self-reported fatigue, and quality of life (QoL). Change in body mass index (BMI) and body weight was included in the breast cancer analysis.Overall, 37.3% of survivors habitually engaged in AM exercise (e.g. ≥ 75% AM training), 34.3% in PM exercise, and 28.3% in a mix of AM and PM exercise training throughout the program. Median time in the program was 17 weeks. Significant improvements in most human performance and physical function variables were observed in the total sample regardless of exercise training time-of-day. Among breast cancer survivors, PM but not AM or mixed was associated with improvements in fitness, and lower-body muscular endurance and function. Mixed exercise timing was linked with greater increase in waist circumference (total sample: 3.02cm, 95%CI 1.55, 4.49; breast cancer: 3.57cm 95%CI 0.96, 6.18), body weight (breast cancer: 1.6kg, 95%CI 0.3, 2.8) and BMI (breast cancer: 0.6kg/m2, 95%CI 0.1, 1.0). AM and PM exercise, but not mixed, was associated with improvements in fatigue and QoL.Time-of-day of exercise training may differentially impact changes in human performance and physical function variables. Mixed exercise training time may result in less favorable outcomes related of weight management variables among cancer survivors."
https://openalex.org/W3207596652,"Interaction with fish is known to reduce stress and anxiety in humans.This trial evaluated the effect of an aquarium present in a geriatric dental clinic waiting-area (WA) on blood pressure (BP), heart-rate (HR), anxiety, and mood of waiting patients.Participants were recruited into three groups: control (CG): WA without aquarium; partially-stocked aquarium (PSA): aquarium without fish; fully-stocked aquarium (FSA): aquarium with fish. BP and HR of the participants were recorded upon arrival and after 20-minutes of waiting, along with anxiety [State trait anxiety inventory (STAI-6)] and mood [Feeling scale (FS), Felt arousal scale (FAS)] scores. A purpose-built questionnaire evaluated the subjective assessment of the participants' experience in the WA. ANOVA with repeated measures and nonparametric tests were used for statistical analysis (p<0.05).392 patients (mean age: 65.07±16.9y) completed this trial. There was an effect of time on the BP [systolic: F(1, 120) = 44.82, p<0.001; diastolic: F(1, 120) = 25.10, p<0.001] and HR [F(1, 120) = 40.94, p<0.001]. No effect of groups on BP [systolic: F(1, 120) = 1.01, p = 0.32; diastolic: F(1, 120) = 0.01, p = 0.92] was revealed, but a decrease of HR [F(1, 120) = 21.59, p<0.001]. No effect of time*group on BP [systolic: F(1, 120) = 0.89, p = 0.35; diastolic: F(1, 120) = 0.31, p = 0.58], or HR [F(1, 120) = 1.04, p-0.31]. WA groups had no effects on the participants' anxiety [H(2) = 2.76, p = 0.25], or mood [FS: H(2) = 2.28, p = 0.32; FAS: H(2) = 1.54, p = 0.46]. Patients rated FSA higher than others [H(2) = 20.98, p<0.001).There was no influence of the presence of an aquarium on the patients' blood pressure, heart rate, anxiety, or mood."
https://openalex.org/W3207644856,"Tiger beetles are a popular group of insects amongst amateur naturalists, and are well-represented in museum and private collections. New species descriptions plateaued in the 19th century, but there is a recent resurgence of discoveries as integrative taxonomy methods, guided by molecular systematics, uncover ""cryptic"" tiger beetle diversity. In this paper, we describe a new species using multiple data types. This new species, Eunota mecocheila Duran and Roman n. sp., is in the tribe Cicindelini, and is described from specimens collected in saline muddy ditches in northern Mexico. This species is closely related to E. circumpicta (LaFerté-Sénectère, 1841), but is separated based on morphological differences, geographic range, and genetic differentiation. Little is known about the biology or distribution of this species and it has only been collected from two sites in the state of Coahuila. Given the location of this new species, and its genetic divergence from its closest relative, E. circumpicta, we discuss the historical biogeography that may have led to isolation and speciation. The male and female dorsal, lateral and frontal habitus and the male aedeagus are shown."
https://openalex.org/W3207943083,"Mediation analysis is a statistical method for evaluating the direct and indirect effects of an exposure on an outcome in the presence of a mediator. Mediation models have been widely used to determine direct and indirect contributions of genetic variants in clinical phenotypes. In genetic studies, the additive genetic model is the most commonly used model because it can detect effects from either recessive or dominant models (or any model in between). However, the existing approaches for mediation model cannot be directly applied when the genetic model is additive (e.g. the most commonly used model for SNPs) or categorical (e.g. polymorphic loci), and thus modification to measures of indirect and direct effects is warranted. In this study, we proposed overall measures of indirect, direct, and total effects for a mediation model with a categorical exposure and a censored mediator, which accounts for the frequency of different values of the categorical exposure. The proposed approach provides the overall contribution of the categorical exposure to the outcome variable. We assessed the empirical performance of the proposed overall measures via simulation studies and applied the measures to evaluate the mediating effect of a women's age at menopause on the association between genetic variants and type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3205911975,"Marriage-based immigrant women are increasing around the world. Although bi-dimensional acculturation is important for immigrant women's health, the existing scales have mainly been developed for immigrant women in Western countries and hence some items may not be suitable for Asian contexts. Thus, we developed and evaluated the Bidimensional Acculturation Scale for Marriage-Based Immigrant Women (BAS-MBIW) in Taiwan.The BAS-MBIW was developed based on a literature review and clinical observations. Bi-dimensional acculturation involves ""adaptation to host culture (acculturation)"" and ""maintenance of heritage culture (enculturation)."" The initial scale included two 24-item subscales. The validation samples were 310 marriage-based immigrant women who were pregnant for at least twelve weeks in Taiwan. The BAS-MBIW was assessed and modified by experts. Data analyses included factor analysis, Pearson's correlation, and Cronbach's alpha coefficient.Expert reviews and factor analysis indicated that the scale had acceptable content and construct validity. The validated scale includes two 19-item subscales, encompassing six domains: language, media, food preference, cultural heritage, social interaction, and shopping and merchandise preference, with good internal consistencies (Cronbach's alpha coefficient is 0.88 for acculturation and 0.83 for enculturation). Acculturation was positively related to local language ability and duration of immigration but negatively related to age at immigration, stress, and depression; whereas enculturation was positively related to age at immigration, stress, and depression but negatively related to duration of immigration, indicating convergent validity.The BAS-MBIW offers reliable and valid assessments of pregnant immigrant women's level of acculturation and enculturation in Taiwan. The BAS-MBIW could be used to assess bi-dimensional acculturation among marriage-based immigrant women."
