https://openalex.org/W2049185799,"Angiogenesis does not only depend on endothelial cell invasion and proliferation: it also requires pericyte coverage of vascular sprouts for vessel stabilization. These processes are coordinated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) through their cognate receptors on endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), respectively. PDGF induces neovascularization by priming VSMCs/pericytes to release pro-angiogenic mediators. Although VEGF directly stimulates endothelial cell proliferation and migration, its role in pericyte biology is less clear. Here we define a role for VEGF as an inhibitor of neovascularization on the basis of its capacity to disrupt VSMC function. Specifically, under conditions of PDGF-mediated angiogenesis, VEGF ablates pericyte coverage of nascent vascular sprouts, leading to vessel destabilization. At the molecular level, VEGF-mediated activation of VEGF-R2 suppresses PDGF-Rbeta signalling in VSMCs through the assembly of a previously undescribed receptor complex consisting of PDGF-Rbeta and VEGF-R2. Inhibition of VEGF-R2 not only prevents assembly of this receptor complex but also restores angiogenesis in tissues exposed to both VEGF and PDGF. Finally, genetic deletion of tumour cell VEGF disrupts PDGF-Rbeta/VEGF-R2 complex formation and increases tumour vessel maturation. These findings underscore the importance of VSMCs/pericytes in neovascularization and reveal a dichotomous role for VEGF and VEGF-R2 signalling as both a promoter of endothelial cell function and a negative regulator of VSMCs and vessel maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2151130810,"Recent setbacks have prompted a major re-evaluation of the AIDS vaccine field. One question that has been asked is whether to continue development of T-cell-based HIV-1 vaccines. Now a study of a new vaccine in monkeys challenged with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) suggests that the T-cell-based strategy remains potentially viable. The vaccine was prepared using two adenovirus vectors (rAd26 prime/rAd5 boost) expressing SIV Gag protein. It induced potent T-cell immune responses and some protection from infection. These findings provide pointers to the design of a new generation of T-cell-based vaccine candidates for HIV-1. Vaccine elicted Gag specific cellular immune responses are shown to provide a measure of protection from disease in Mamu-A*01-negative rhesus monkeys challenged with SIVMAC251. A recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 (rAd5) vector-based vaccine for HIV-1 has recently failed in a phase 2b efficacy study in humans1,2. Consistent with these results, preclinical studies have demonstrated that rAd5 vectors expressing simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Gag failed to reduce peak or setpoint viral loads after SIV challenge of rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) that lacked the protective MHC class I allele Mamu-A*01 (ref. 3). Here we show that an improved T-cell-based vaccine regimen using two serologically distinct adenovirus vectors afforded substantially improved protective efficacy in this challenge model. In particular, a heterologous rAd26 prime/rAd5 boost vaccine regimen expressing SIV Gag elicited cellular immune responses with augmented magnitude, breadth and polyfunctionality as compared with the homologous rAd5 regimen. After SIVMAC251 challenge, monkeys vaccinated with the rAd26/rAd5 regimen showed a 1.4 log reduction of peak and a 2.4 log reduction of setpoint viral loads as well as decreased AIDS-related mortality as compared with control animals. These data demonstrate that durable partial immune control of a pathogenic SIV challenge for more than 500 days can be achieved by a T-cell-based vaccine in Mamu-A*01-negative rhesus monkeys in the absence of a homologous Env antigen. These findings have important implications for the development of next-generation T-cell-based vaccine candidates for HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W2135627690,"VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) is an important angiogenic factor that has been implicated in tumorigenesis. Two papers now show that the function of VEGF is far more complex, as VEFG can negatively regulate angiogenesis and limit tumorigenesis. In one study, Greenberg et al. found that VEGF can inhibit angiogenesis, by impeding the function of the PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor) receptor on pericytes, leading to a loss of pericyte coverage of blood vessels. This involves the formation of heterodimers between the receptors for VEGF and PDGF. In another paper, Stockmann et al. deleted VEGF production in myeloid cells, but not other cell types. Unexpectedly, they found more rapid tumour development in these mice, at the same time as attenuated tumour vascularization and the formation of morphologically and functionally normalized blood vessels. In contrast, tumours lacking VEGF altogether grew more slowly. VEGF is an important angiogenic factor that has been implicated in tumourigenesis. Two papers now show that the function of VEGF is far more complex, as VEGF can negatively regulate angiogenesis and limit tumourigenesis. In the second paper, VEGF production was deleted in myeloid cells, but not other cell types. Unexpectedly, more rapid tumour development in these mice was found at the same time as attenuated tumour vascularization and the formation of morphologically and functionally normalized blood vessels. In contrast, tumours lacking VEGF altogether grew more slowly. Angiogenesis and the development of a vascular network are required for tumour progression, and they involve the release of angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), from both malignant and stromal cell types1. Infiltration by cells of the myeloid lineage is a hallmark of many tumours, and in many cases the macrophages in these infiltrates express VEGF-A2. Here we show that the deletion of inflammatory-cell-derived VEGF-A attenuates the formation of a typical high-density vessel network, thus blocking the angiogenic switch in solid tumours in mice. Vasculature in tumours lacking myeloid-cell-derived VEGF-A was less tortuous, with increased pericyte coverage and decreased vessel length, indicating vascular normalization. In addition, loss of myeloid-derived VEGF-A decreases the phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) in tumours, even though overall VEGF-A levels in the tumours are unaffected. However, deletion of myeloid-cell VEGF-A resulted in an accelerated tumour progression in multiple subcutaneous isograft models and an autochthonous transgenic model of mammary tumorigenesis, with less overall tumour cell death and decreased tumour hypoxia. Furthermore, loss of myeloid-cell VEGF-A increased the susceptibility of tumours to chemotherapeutic cytotoxicity. This shows that myeloid-derived VEGF-A is essential for the tumorigenic alteration of vasculature and signalling to VEGFR2, and that these changes act to retard, not promote, tumour progression."
https://openalex.org/W2050672295,"Plants have evolved annual and perennial life forms as alternative strategies to adapt reproduction and survival to environmental constraints. In isolated situations, such as islands, woody perennials have evolved repeatedly from annual ancestors. Although the molecular basis of the rapid evolution of insular woodiness is unknown, the molecular difference between perennials and annuals might be rather small, and a change between these life strategies might not require major genetic innovations. Developmental regulators can strongly affect evolutionary variation and genes involved in meristem transitions are good candidates for a switch in growth habit. We found that the MADS box proteins SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) and FRUITFULL (FUL) not only control flowering time, but also affect determinacy of all meristems. In addition, downregulation of both proteins established phenotypes common to the lifestyle of perennial plants, suggesting their involvement in the prevention of secondary growth and longevity in annual life forms."
https://openalex.org/W2154833122,"Elucidating how chromatin influences gene expression patterns and ultimately cell fate is fundamental to understanding development and disease. The histone variant H2AZ has emerged as a key regulator of chromatin function and plays an essential but unknown role during mammalian development. Here, genome-wide analysis reveals that H2AZ occupies the promoters of developmentally important genes in a manner that is remarkably similar to that of the Polycomb group (PcG) protein Suz12. By using RNAi, we demonstrate a role for H2AZ in regulating target gene expression, find that H2AZ and PcG protein occupancy is interdependent at promoters, and further show that H2AZ is necessary for ES cell differentiation. Notably, H2AZ occupies a different subset of genes in lineage-committed cells, suggesting that its dynamic redistribution is necessary for cell fate transitions. Thus, H2AZ, together with PcG proteins, may establish specialized chromatin states in ES cells necessary for the proper execution of developmental gene expression programs."
https://openalex.org/W2029158215,"The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is required to block sister chromatid separation until all chromosomes are properly attached to the mitotic apparatus. The SAC prevents cells from entering anaphase by inhibiting the ubiquitylation of cyclin B1 and securin by the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) ubiquitin ligase. The target of the SAC is the essential APC/C activator Cdc20. It is unclear how the SAC inactivates Cdc20 but most current models suggest that Cdc20 forms a stable complex with the Mad2 checkpoint protein. Here we show that most Cdc20 is not in a complex with Mad2; instead Mad2 is required for Cdc20 to form a complex with another checkpoint protein, BubR1. We further show that during the SAC, the APC/C ubiquitylates Cdc20 to target it for degradation. Thus, ubiquitylation of human Cdc20 is not required to release it from the checkpoint complex, but to degrade it to maintain mitotic arrest."

Impressive progress has been made, including evaluation of neural control signals, sensor testing in humans, signal decoding advances, and proof-of-concept validation. Most importantly, the field has demonstrated that persons with paralysis can use prototype systems for spelling, ""point and click,"" and robot control. Human and animal NI research is advancing knowledge about neural information processing and plasticity in healthy, diseased, and injured nervous systems.

https://openalex.org/W2099136866,"Stroke is the world's third leading cause of death. One cause of stroke, intracranial aneurysm, affects approximately 2% of the population and accounts for 500,000 hemorrhagic strokes annually in mid-life (median age 50), most often resulting in death or severe neurological impairment. The pathogenesis of intracranial aneurysm is unknown, and because catastrophic hemorrhage is commonly the first sign of disease, early identification is essential. We carried out a multistage genome-wide association study (GWAS) of Finnish, Dutch and Japanese cohorts including over 2,100 intracranial aneurysm cases and 8,000 controls. Genome-wide genotyping of the European cohorts and replication studies in the Japanese cohort identified common SNPs on chromosomes 2q, 8q and 9p that show significant association with intracranial aneurysm with odds ratios 1.24-1.36. The loci on 2q and 8q are new, whereas the 9p locus was previously found to be associated with arterial diseases, including intracranial aneurysm. Associated SNPs on 8q likely act via SOX17, which is required for formation and maintenance of endothelial cells, suggesting a role in development and repair of the vasculature; CDKN2A at 9p may have a similar role. These findings have implications for the pathophysiology, diagnosis and therapy of intracranial aneurysm."
https://openalex.org/W2152465579,"The classic 'size principle' of motor control describes how increasingly forceful movements arise by the recruitment of motoneurons of progressively larger size and force output into the active pool. We explored the activity of pools of spinal interneurons in larval zebrafish and found that increases in swimming speed were not associated with the simple addition of cells to the active pool. Instead, the recruitment of interneurons at faster speeds was accompanied by the silencing of those driving movements at slower speeds. This silencing occurred both between and within classes of rhythmically active premotor excitatory interneurons. Thus, unlike motoneurons, there is a continuous shift in the set of cells driving the behavior, even though changes in the speed of the movements and the frequency of the motor pattern appear to be smoothly graded. We conclude that fundamentally different principles may underlie the recruitment of motoneuron and interneuron pools."
https://openalex.org/W2008284182,"HIV's considerable capacity to vary its HLA-I-restricted peptide antigens allows it to escape from host cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Nevertheless, therapeutics able to target HLA-I-associated antigens, with specificity for the spectrum of preferred CTL escape mutants, could prove effective. Here we use phage display to isolate and enhance a T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) originating from a CTL line derived from an infected person and specific for the immunodominant HLA-A(*)02-restricted, HIVgag-specific peptide SLYNTVATL (SL9). High-affinity (K(D) < 400 pM) TCRs were produced that bound with a half-life in excess of 2.5 h, retained specificity, targeted HIV-infected cells and recognized all common escape variants of this epitope. CD8 T cells transduced with this supraphysiologic TCR produced a greater range of soluble factors and more interleukin-2 than those transduced with natural SL9-specific TCR, and they effectively controlled wild-type and mutant strains of HIV at effector-to-target ratios that could be achieved by T-cell therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2024412683,"Repetitive DNA sequences, which constitute half the genome in some organisms, often undergo homologous recombination. This can instigate genomic instability resulting from a gain or loss of DNA. Assembly of DNA into silent chromatin is generally thought to serve as a mechanism ensuring repeat stability by limiting access to the recombination machinery. Consistent with this notion is the observation, in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, that stability of the highly repetitive ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences requires a Sir2-containing chromatin silencing complex that also inhibits transcription from foreign promoters and transposons inserted within the repeats by a process called rDNA silencing. Here we describe a protein network that stabilizes rDNA repeats of budding yeast by means of interactions between rDNA-associated silencing proteins and two proteins of the inner nuclear membrane (INM). Deletion of either the INM or silencing proteins reduces perinuclear rDNA positioning, disrupts the nucleolus-nucleoplasm boundary, induces the formation of recombination foci, and destabilizes the repeats. In addition, artificial targeting of rDNA repeats to the INM suppresses the instability observed in cells lacking an rDNA-associated silencing protein that is typically required for peripheral tethering of the repeats. Moreover, in contrast to Sir2 and its associated nucleolar factors, the INM proteins are not required for rDNA silencing, indicating that Sir2-dependent silencing is not sufficient to inhibit recombination within the rDNA locus. These findings demonstrate a role for INM proteins in the perinuclear localization of chromosomes and show that tethering to the nuclear periphery is required for the stability of rDNA repeats. The INM proteins studied here are conserved and have been implicated in chromosome organization in metazoans. Our results therefore reveal an ancient mechanism in which interactions between INM proteins and chromosomal proteins ensure genome stability."
https://openalex.org/W2064434404,"It has been proposed that neurons in the intraparietal cortex gradually accumulate evidence supporting different response options. Here the authors show that this model generalizes to arbitrary stimulus-response associations in humans. The neural mechanism underlying simple perceptual decision-making in monkeys has been recently conceptualized as an integrative process in which sensory evidence supporting different response options accumulates gradually over time. For example, intraparietal neurons accumulate motion information in favor of a specific oculomotor choice over time. It is unclear, however, whether this mechanism generalizes to more complex decisions that are based on arbitrary stimulus-response associations. In a task requiring arbitrary association of visual stimuli (faces or places) with different actions (eye or hand-pointing movements), we found that activity of effector-specific regions in human posterior parietal cortex reflected the 'strength' of the sensory evidence in favor of the preferred response. These regions did not respond to sensory stimuli per se but integrated sensory evidence toward the decision outcome. We conclude that even arbitrary decisions can be mediated by sensory-motor mechanisms that are completely triggered by contextual stimulus-response associations."

In the present perspective, we provide a short description of our personal view of these advances, suggest a series of important future questions about synapses, and discuss ideas about how best to achieve further progress in the field. Enormous progress has been made in recent decades in our understanding of synaptic transmission and its use-dependent plasticity. The development of new tools, in particular in molecular genetics, structural biology, electrophysiology, and imaging has led to a detailed understanding of key phenomena, such as the Ca2+-triggering of neurotransmitter release and some of the key mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity. Nevertheless, major technical and intellectual challenges remain. As Neuron turns 20, it seems an appropriate time to provide a brief, highly personal perspective on some of the major advances in our understanding of synaptic function over the last two decades, as well as attempt to point out some of the most important future challenges in an area of research that will continue to be critical for understanding both normal and pathological brain function. The last two decades were revolutionary in neuroscience. Years of extraordinary growth and opportunity were provided by expanding technologies, increases in funding, and the realization that understanding the brain is a major, maybe even the most important, frontier in biology. When considering advances in our understanding of synaptic function, much deserves to be noted. However, for reasons of space, we provide a limited list of achievements that reflects our personal bias. This list is thematically organized and not ordered according to perceived importance. Figure 1 provides a schematic illustration of the synapse that highlights some of the points made on the list. Chronologically, the description of the molecular composition of synapses was the first major step toward understanding the basis of synaptic transmission beyond the elegant electrophysiological studies of pioneers such as Fatt, Katz, Llinas, and Eccles. It is hard to remember now how revolutionary the cloning of the Torpedo nicotinic receptor by Numa was (Noda et al., 1982Noda M. Takahashi H. Tanabe T. Toyosato M. Furutani Y. Hirose T. Asai M.

This work initiated a 15 year period during which most of the principal components of synapses were purified and cloned. This period started with channels and receptors (e.g., Noda et al., 1982Noda M. Takahashi H. Tanabe T. Toyosato M. Furutani Y. Hirose T. Asai M. Inayama S. Miyata T. Numa S.

Although the molecular cataloging of synaptic proteins can be viewed as merely descriptive, this work is a prerequisite for understanding synapses. This effort culminated in the systematic analysis of the synaptic vesicle as an organelle (Burré et al., 2006Burré J. Beckhaus T. Schägger H. Corvey C. Hofmann S. Karas M. Zimmermann H. Volknandt W.

Much, however, remains unknown, including a complete list of synaptic cell-adhesion molecules and a detailed understanding of the stoichiometric composition of proteins at different types of synapses. Presynaptic neurotransmitter release is mediated by the Ca2+-triggered fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane at the active zone (Figure 1). The last 20 years achieved a nearly complete understanding of this process. The description of the synaptic vesicle fusion machine, starting with the identification of synaptobrevin/VAMP as the target of tetanus toxin that is responsible for mediating fusion (Schiavo et al., 1992Schiavo G. Benfenati F. Poulain B. Rossetto O. Polverino de Laureto P. DasGupta B.R. Montecucco C.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1017-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), not only accounted for how synaptic vesicles fuse, but also provided a blueprint for all intracellular fusion reactions (Jahn and Scheller, 2006Jahn R. Scheller R.H. SNAREs--engines for membrane fusion.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar). The general principles that apply to all fusion reactions in a cell are simple: a machinery consisting of three or four SNARE proteins and one sec1-Munc18-like protein (SM protein) is positioned and controlled by ancillary proteins, which in the case of the synapse, include active zone proteins such as Munc13 and soluble proteins such as tomosyn (Südhof, 2004Südhof T.C. The synaptic vesicle cycle.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 509-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). In parallel, the discovery of synaptotagmin as the synaptic Ca2+ sensor that is responsible for the majority of release under normal stimulation conditions in all synapses (Perin et al., 1990Perin M.S. Fried V.A. Mignery G.A. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Phospholipid binding by a synaptic vesicle protein homologous to the regulatory region of protein kinase C.Nature. 1990; 345: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar) provided a molecular explanation for Katz's pioneering observation that neurotransmitter release is Ca2+ triggered (Katz, 1969Katz B. The Release of Neural Transmitter Substances. Liverpool University Press, Liverpool1969Google Scholar). This discovery was complemented by the more recent identification of complexin as a cofactor for synaptotagmin in the Ca2+ triggering of release (McMahon et al., 1995McMahon H.T. Missler M. Li C. Südhof T.C. Complexins: cytosolic proteins that regulate SNAP-receptor function.Cell. 1995; 83: 111-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). A model emerged wherein complexin activates and clamps fusion of synaptic vesicles by binding to partially or fully assembled SNARE complexes (Tang et al., 2006Tang J. Maximov A. Shin O.-H. Dai H. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. A Complexin/Synaptotagmin-1 Switch Controls Fast Synaptic Vesicle Exocytosis.Cell. 2006; 126: 1175-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Ca2+ entering the terminal during an action potential then binds to synaptotagmin, thereby inducing the simultaneous interaction of synaptotagmin with phospholipids in the membranes and with the SNARE complex. This interaction displaces complexin from the SNARE complex, bends the phospholipids, and opens the fusion pore (Tang et al., 2006Tang J. Maximov A. Shin O.-H. Dai H. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. A Complexin/Synaptotagmin-1 Switch Controls Fast Synaptic Vesicle Exocytosis.Cell. 2006; 126: 1175-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Many details remain to be clarified in this model; for example, how different synaptotagmin isoforms confer distinct Ca2+ affinities and reaction speeds onto fusion (Xu et al., 2007Xu J. Mashimo T. Südhof T.C. Synaptotagmin-1, -2, and -9: Ca2+-sensors for fast release that specify distinct presynaptic properties in subsets of neurons.Neuron. 2007; 54: 567-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and whether this diversity is physiologically important. But the fundamental molecular reactions that have been defined are likely to occur in similar fashions in all fast Ca2+-triggered fusion, and account for most of the neurotransmitter, neuropeptide, and hormone secretion observed physiologically. Synapses exhibit marked use-dependent plasticity that manifests as short- and long-term increases or decreases in synaptic strength. Over the last two decades, intense efforts were focused on understanding the mechanisms of NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). These efforts were richly rewarded by major discoveries (Lisman et al., 2007Lisman J.E. Raghavachari S. Tsien R.W. The sequence of events that underlie quantal transmission at central glutamatergic synapses.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 597-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). A vigorous debate about presynaptic versus postsynaptic expression mechanisms (Malenka and Nicoll, 1999Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Long-term potentiation–a decade of progress?.Science. 1999; 285: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar) led to the resolution that NMDAR-dependent forms of LTP and LTD are both mediated primarily by changes in the number of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in the postsynaptic density (Shepherd and Huganir, 2007Shepherd J.D. Huganir R.L. The cell biology of synaptic plasticity: AMPA receptor trafficking.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 613-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Depending on the pattern of synaptic activity and the quantitative properties of the resulting NMDAR-mediated rise in Ca2+ within dendritic spines, AMPARs can undergo either endocytosis during LTD or insertion into the postsynaptic density during LTP (Figure 1). Much has been learned about the molecular details underlying AMPAR trafficking, such as, for example, the importance of the AMPAR accessory proteins TARPs and scaffolding proteins such as PSD-95 (Chen et al., 2000Chen L. Chetkovich D.M. Petralia R.S. Sweeney N.T. Kawasaki Y. Wenthold R.J. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A.

However, as sophisticated molecular, imaging, and electrophysiological tools are applied to the study of LTP and LTD, it is apparent that the complexity of the functional roles of even a single protein, such as PSD-95, in these phenomena is daunting (Steiner et al., 2008Steiner P.

Although neurons were known to be functionally and structurally polarized even before Ramon y Cajal provided his beautiful drawings, nobody anticipated the powerful capabilities embodied in dendrites. Studies over the last decades uncovered that dendrites, as the postsynaptic compartment par excellence, can do almost everything the neuronal cell body does, but in a more sophisticated, spatially and temporally compartmentalized manner. Dendrites, or rather various dendritic segments, function as autonomous units replete with signaling elements. We now know that dendrites express a complex array of voltage-dependent conductances, allowing them to generate back- and forward-propagating action potentials. They also contain a full-fledged protein synthesis machinery, including a rough endoplasmic reticulum and a functional Golgi complex (Ehlers, 2007Ehlers M.D. Secrets of the secretory pathway in dendrite growth.Neuron. 2007; 55: 686-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) that are likely critical for the local control of the postsynaptic composition of individual synapses. Dendritic spines, the reception points for most excitatory synapses, are compartmentalized extensions of the dendrites that contain a subset of these elements, and serve as entry points to dendritic signaling. As a result of these properties, dendrites integrate synaptic signals in a nonlinear manner (Bourne and Harris, 2008Bourne J.N. Harris K.M. Balancing structure and function at hippocampal dendritic spines.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 47-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, Higley and Sabatini, 2008Higley M.J. Sabatini B.L. Calcium signaling in dendrites and spines: practical and functional considerations.Neuron. 2008; 59: 902-913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Many candidate retrograde messengers that might function to carry a postsynaptic signal to presynaptic terminals were advanced over the last decades. However, no consensus molecule emerged until the demonstration that endocannabinoids mediate a phenomenon called depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) (Wilson and Nicoll, 2002Wilson R.I. Nicoll R.A. Endocannabinoid signaling in the brain.Science. 2002; 296: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). During DSI, depolarization of a postsynaptic neuron causes transient suppression of GABA release from presynaptic inhibitory terminals contacting this neuron; this suppression is effected by endocannabinoids that act retrogradely (Figure 1). This seminal finding spawned the discovery of a role for endocannbinoids in several additional forms of postsynaptically induced, but presynaptically expressed, plasticity, especially in long-term plasticity of both inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission in various brain structures (Chevaleyre et al., 2006Chevaleyre V. Takahashi K.A. Castillo P.E. Endocannabinoid-mediated synaptic plasticity in the CNS.Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 29: 37-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Strikingly, whereas short-term endocannabinoid-dependent plasticity is independent of the active zone protein RIM1α, long-term endocannabinoid-dependent presynaptic plasticity requires this protein (Chevaleyre et al., 2007Chevaleyre V. Heifets B.D. Kaeser P.S. Südhof T.C. Castillo P.E. Endocannabinoid-mediated long-term plasticity requires cAMP/PKA signaling and RIM1α.Neuron. 2007; 54: 801-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, Fourcaudot et al., 2008Fourcaudot E.

USA. 2008; 39: 15130-15135Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recent results revealed the importance of inhibitory synapses in neural circuits, in addition to the traditionally studied excitatory synapses, beyond what was envisioned earlier. Although fewer inhibitory neurons and synapses are present in brain, inhibitory neurons manifest in a bewildering diversity, and their synapses exert a profound influence on the properties of neural circuits (e.g., see Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008Klausberger T. Somogyi P. Neuronal diversity and temporal dynamics: the unity of hippocampal circuit operations.Science. 2008; 321: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). The diversity of inhibitory neurons is not only apparent in their shape and connectivity pattern, but also in the properties of their synapses which, among others, can express multiple forms of LTP and LTD (e.g., see Nugent et al., 2007Nugent F.S. Penick E.C. Kauer J.A. Opioids block long-term potentiation of inhibitory synapses.Nature. 2007; 446: 1086-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), besides the endocannabinoid-dependent forms described above (Chevaleyre et al., 2006Chevaleyre V. Takahashi K.A. Castillo P.E. Endocannabinoid-mediated synaptic plasticity in the CNS.Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 29: 37-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Moreover, excitatory synapses on GABAergic interneurons are dynamic and also exhibit a suprisingly diverse repertoire of plasticity (Kullmann and Lamsa, 2007Kullmann D.M. Lamsa K.P. Long-term synaptic plasticity in hippocampal interneurons.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 687-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Neurons are largely irreplaceable after development, apart from a small population of continuously replenished neurons that originate throughout life from the dentate gyrus and subventricular zone (Zhao et al., 2008Zhao C. Deng W. Gage F.H. Mechanisms and functional implications of adult neurogenesis.Cell. 2008; 132: 645-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar). The question of whether synapses are similarly irreplaceable, or can be continuously remodeled during the lifetime of an organism, has been difficult to address. The advent of new imaging tools over the last decade revealed that dendritic spines are very dynamic (Lendvai et al., 2000Lendvai B. Stern E.A. Chen B. Svoboda K. Experience-dependent plasticity of dendritic spines in the developing rat barrel cortex in vivo.Nature. 2000; 404: 876-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, Zuo et al., 2005Zuo Y. Yang G. Kwon E. Gan W.B. Long-term sensory deprivation prevents dendritic spine loss in primary somatosensory cortex.Nature. 2005; 436: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Long-term in vivo imaging experiments suggested that synapses are continuously formed, eliminated, and remodeled throughout adulthood, although the extent of such processes may vary between different brain regions (Grutzendler et al., 2002Grutzendler J. Kasthuri N. Gan W.B. Long-term dendritic spine stability in the adult cortex.Nature. 2002; 420: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar, Trachtenberg et al., 2002Trachtenberg J.T.

Long-term in vivo imaging of experience-dependent synaptic plasticity in adult cortex.Nature. 2002; 420: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Such activity-dependent structural changes in synaptic connectivity likely underlie many forms of experience-dependent plasticity, including learning and memory. Major technical advances that went far beyond classical approaches enabled analysis of the exquisite details of synaptic transmission. Such advances included application of capacitance measurements to directly monitor exocytosis from presynaptic terminals, and the use of caged Ca2+ that can be released by photolysis (Neher and Marty, 1982Neher E.

USA. 1982; 79: 6712-6716Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, Delaney and Zucker, 1990Delaney K.R. Zucker R.S. Calcium released by photolysis of DM-nitrophen stimulates transmitter release at squid giant synapse.J. Physiol. 1990; 426: 473-498PubMed Google Scholar). Imaging techniques using styryl dyes such as FM1-43, and genetically encoded fluorescent proteins such as synaptophluorin, allowed direct visualization of synaptic vesicle release and cycling (Rizzoli and Betz, 2005Rizzoli S.O. Betz W.J. Synaptic vesicle pools.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Furthermore, multiphoton microscopy allowed direct visualization and activation of single dendritic spines within intact brain tissue (Mainen et al., 1999Mainen Z.F. Malinow R. Svoboda K. Synaptic calcium transients in single spines indicate that NMDA receptors are not saturated.Nature. 1999; 399: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, Matsuzaki et al., 2004Matsuzaki M. Honkura N. Ellis-Davies G.C. Kasai H. Structural basis of long-term potentiation in single dendritic spines.Nature. 2004; 429: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). These state-of-the-art approaches have made it possible to answer more and more sophisticated questions about synaptic function. Among the major observations emerging from such studies are a more precise definition of presynaptic exocytosis and postsynaptic signaling, the observation of multivesicular release in an active zone, the exact measurements of presynaptic and postsynaptic Ca2+ concentrations during synaptic transmission (with some caveats about spatial heterogeneity), and the monitoring of individual vesicles during exocytosis and endocytosis (Wadiche and Jahr, 2001Wadiche J.I.

We believe there are two types of challenges for research on synaptic function over the next decades: to organize our research efforts in the scientific community effectively, and to use these efforts to answer salient questions about synapses that have the biggest chance of providing new insights. From our personal perspective, the following questions about synapses are particularly important. Synapses are diverse in shape and properties. We do not know much about how this diversity is determined, nor what it means for the neural networks in which these synapses participate. What determines the receptor composition of individual synapses? How does a synapse become facilitating or depressing during stimulus trains, and what are the molecular underpinnings for this physiological difference? This property is probably related to synaptic cell adhesion since postsynaptic neurons appear to be instructive for presynaptic properties, and vice versa (Maccaferri et al., 1998Maccaferri G. Toth K. McBain C.J. Target–specific expression of presynaptic mossy fiber plasticity.Science. 1998; 279: 1368-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, Takamori et al., 2000Takamori S.

Burnashev N. Sakmann B. Neher E. Transmitter release modulation by intracellular Ca2+ buffers in facilitating and depressing nerve terminals of pyramidal cells in layer 2/3 of the rat neocortex indicates a target cell-specific difference in presynaptic calcium dynamics.J. Physiol. 2001; 531: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), but no molecular mechanisms are known. Identification of the nature and mechanisms that mediate such synapse specification will be important for understanding how neural circuits develop. While evidence has accumulated that the acquisition of new declarative memories involves long-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, little is known about how they are stored long-term in the cortex. Synaptic changes are likely required for memory formation, as is gene transcription, which may be regulated via epigenetic mechanisms during memory formation and may primarily affect “synaptic” genes (Barrett and Wood, 2008Barrett R.M. Wood M.A. Beyond transcription factors: the role of chromatin modifying enzymes in regulating transcription required for memory.Learn. Mem. 2008; 15: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). At least two principal mechanisms are possible by which synaptic mechanisms might store memories: (1) the remodeling of the synaptic wiring diagram by the formation of new synapses and/or the elimination of old synapses, or (2) the selective strengthening and weakening of subsets of synapses without changes in synaptic connectivity. Moreover, memory formation may involve more than synaptic changes, as adult neurogenesis has been hypothesized to be necessary (Leuner et al., 2006Leuner B. Gould E. Shors T.J. Is there a link between adult neurogenesis and learning?.Hippocampus. 2006; 16: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Addressing the role of synapses in learning and memory requires a better understanding of their dynamics, further insights into the connection between the synapse and the nucleus, and better control of the properties of synaps"

https://openalex.org/W1981502091,"<i>Helicobacter pylori</i> VacA toxin contributes to the pathogenesis and severity of gastric injury. We found that incubation of AZ-521 cells with VacA resulted in phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) through a PI3K-dependent pathway. Following phosphorylation and inhibition of GSK3β,β-catenin was released from a GSK3β/β-catenin complex, with subsequent nuclear translocation. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD) and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), but not 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoic acid (NPPB) and bafilomycin A1, inhibited VacA-induced phosphorylation of Akt, indicating that it does not require VacA internalization and is independent of vacuolation. VacA treatment of AZ-521 cells transfected with TOPtkLuciferase reporter plasmid or control FOPtkLucifease reporter plasmid resulted in activation of TOPtkLuciferase, but not FOPtkLucifease. In addition, VacA transactivated the β-catenin-dependent cyclin D1 promoter in a luciferase reporter assay. Infection of AZ-521 cells by a <i>vacA</i> mutant strain of <i>H. pylori</i> failed to induce phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β, or release of β-catenin from a GSK3β/β-catenin complex. Taken together, these results support the conclusion that VacA activates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, resulting in phosphorylation and inhibition of GSK3β, and subsequent translocation ofβ-catenin to the nucleus, consistent with effects of VacA on β-catenin-regulated transcriptional activity. These data introduce the possibility that Wnt-dependent signaling might play a role in the pathogenesis of <i>H. pylori</i> infection, including the development of gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1976414637,"Development of the telencephalon involves the coordinated growth of diversely patterned brain structures. Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of beta-catenin-mediated Wnt signaling in proliferation and fate determination during cerebral cortical development. We found that beta-catenin-mediated Wnt signaling critically maintained progenitor proliferation in the subcortical (pallidal) telencephalon. Targeted deletion of beta-catenin in mice severely impaired proliferation in the medial ganglionic eminence without grossly altering differentiated fate. Several lines of evidence suggest that this phenotype is primarily the result of a loss of canonical Wnt signaling. As previous studies have suggested that the ventral patterning factor Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) also stimulates dorsal telencephalic proliferation, we propose a model whereby Wnt and Shh signaling promote distinct dorsal-ventral patterning while also having broader effects on proliferation that serve to coordinate the growth of telencephalic subregions."

ALA can reach up to 54 mol % of leaf fatty acids in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana (1Falcone D.L. Ogas J.P. Somerville C.R. BMC Plant Biol. 2004; 4: 17Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and is particularly prevalent in the membranes of chloroplasts (2Harwood J.L.

Finding TFAs in these cellular locations is of considerable interest given the fact that these organelles are sites of production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and that ALA is particularly sensitive to oxidation in the presence of these reactive species (5Frankel E.N. Lipid Oxidation, Second Edition. 2005; 18 (Volume in The Oily Press Lipid Library, PJ Barnes & Associates, Bridgwater, UK)Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Given its abundance in plants, it is remarkable that TFAs are not essential for photosynthesis and vegetative growth of Arabidopsis in the laboratory (6McConn M. Browse J. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 403-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, TFAs in leaves have roles in environmental stress and in defense responses. At low temperatures, TFA depletion in Arabidopsis both compromises recovery from photoinhibition (7Vijayan P. Browse J. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 876-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and also impairs the process of chloroplast maintenance (8Poulson M.E. Edwards G.E. Browse J. Photosynth. Res. 2002; 72: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In bacterial pathogenesis, the translocation of ALA from the chloroplast to extrachloroplastic membranes may help activate NADPH oxidase, an enzyme responsible for the production of reactive oxygen species necessary for full resistance to avirulent pathogens (9Yaeno T. Matsuda O. Iba K. Plant J. 2004; 40: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, the best characterized role of TFAs is as an essential precursor in jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis (10Wasternack C. Ann. Bot. (Lond.). 2007; 100: 681-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar).JA is the precursor of potent signals that regulate the expression of many defense genes in plants. For example, ∼30% of Arabidopsis genes differentially expressed in response to infection with the fungus Botrytis cinerea depend on a functional JA signal pathway for their correct expression (11AbuQamar S. Chen X. Dhawan R. Bluhm B. Salmeron J. Lam S. Dietrich R.A. Mengiste T. Plant J. 2006; 48: 28-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Moreover, JA mutants lacking the ability to accumulate or to perceive JA present an increased susceptibility to Phythium mastophorum (12Vijayan P. Shockey J. Levesque C.A. Cook R.J. Browse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7209-7214Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) and to Alternaria brassicicola and Botrytis cinerea (13Thomma B.P. Eggermont K. Penninckx I.A. Mauch-Mani B. Vogelsang R. Cammue B.P. Broekaert W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15107-15111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). In keeping with this, jasmonates often accumulate to high levels in diseased Arabidopsis where oxylipin generation, particularly during lesion formation, can be extensive (14Mueller M.J. Mène-Saffrané L. Grun C. Karg K. Farmer E.E. Plant J. 2006; 45: 472-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Independently of JA, other products of lipid oxidation may also play roles in gene expression. Among these are biologically active oxidized lipids and lipid fragments including reactive electrophile species, many of which are derived in vivo from TFAs (15Mène-Saffrané L. Davoine C. Stolz S. Majcherczyk P. Farmer E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35749-35756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These range from small highly ubiquitous compounds such as malondialdehyde (MDA (16Vollenweider S. Weber H. Stolz S. Chetelat A. Farmer E.E. Plant J. 2000; 24: 467-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Weber H. Chetelat A. Reymond P. Farmer E.E. Plant J. 2004; 37: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar)) to families of hydroxy-fatty acids and phytoprostanes (14Mueller M.J. Mène-Saffrané L. Grun C. Karg K. Farmer E.E. Plant J. 2006; 45: 472-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The potential biological activities of TFAs and TFA-derived compounds needs further investigation, but their activities could, potentially, be masked by the powerful effects of JA.To investigate whether TFAs have an intrinsic role independent of being the precursors of JA, we compared the response of the fad3-2 fad7-2 fad8 (fad3 fad7 fad8) and the aos mutant challenged with pathogens. In separate experiments, the progress of lesion formation was followed in the lesion mimic mutant acd2-2 in the presence and absence of TFAs. The mutant fad3 fad7 fad8 lacks both TFAs and JA, whereas the aos mutant is used as a control because it lacks only JA. The position of these mutants in TFA and JA synthesis is illustrated in Fig. 1A. The results obtained in two different systems employing these mutants show that TFAs but not JA were essential for full plant protection. MDA measurements revealed that TFAs contribute significantly to ROS-related homeostasis. Salicylic acid (SA) measurements and gene expression studies also revealed differences between the fad3 fad7 fad8 and the aos mutants. The results demonstrate a physiological role of TFAs in the management of chronic ROS production.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBiological Materials and Conditions—The fad3 fad7 fad8 mutant (6McConn M.

Sterility was rescued by spraying methyl jasmonate (MeJA) (0.01% in 0.01% Tween 20) at 2-day intervals during flowering. Plants were grown at 90 μmol m-2 s-1 and 22 °C under a 10-h light/14-h dark photoperiod. Seeds were stratified for 3–5 days at 4 °C. B. cinerea was grown on potato dextrose agar (3.9% w/v; BD Biosciences) to obtain conidiospores. Inoculations were performed with 104 spores/ml in 0.6% potato dextrose broth. Four droplets (6 μl each) were applied per plant (4-week-old) to separate, fully expanded leaves. Plants were placed in saturating humidity and constant light (100 microeinsteins m-2 s-1) at 22 °C. Inoculations with Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (formerly Peronospora parasitica (Noco2)) were performed as described in Ref. 20Rusterucci C. Aviv D.H. Holt III, B.F. Dangl J.L. Parker J.E.

Chlorophyll content was determined spectrophotometrically at 645 and 663 nm (21Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). JA was determined using 18O-JA as an internal standard (14Mueller M.J. Mène-Saffrané L. Grun C. Karg K. Farmer E.E. Plant J. 2006; 45: 472-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For MDA measurements, a quantitative gas chromatography/mass spectrometry test based on the formation of a specific pentafluorophenylhydrazine:MDA adduct was used together with [2H2]malondialdehyde as an internal standard (22Yeo H.C. Liu J. Helbock H.J. Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). SA was measured according to Ref. 23Rozhon W. Petutschnig E. Wrzaczek M. Jonak C. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2005; 382: 1620-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar. Free SA was extracted from 130 mg of powder, whereas total SA was extracted from 70 mg of powder. The flow rate of the mobile phase was 0.9 ml/min. 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining, an indication of hydrogen peroxide levels, was performed for 15 h at 22 °C according to Ref. 24Thordal-Christensen H.

The homozygous aos plants were isolated from the F2 population by PCR analysis in a reaction carried out with an annealing temperature of 55 °C using three primers: F1, 5′-GGGAGCGATTGAGAAAATGG-3′, and R1, 5′-CGACGAGAAATTAACGGAGC-3′, amplify a fragment of 442 bp from the WT allele, whereas the F2, 5′-CGGGCCTAACTTTTGGTGTGATGATGCT-3′, in combination with R1 amplifies a fragment of 268 bp in the T-DNA interrupted AOS gene. Homozygous aos acd2-2 was isolated using the strategy outlined above for the fad3 fad7 fad8 acd2-2 mutant. The fad3 fad7 fad8 mutant (6McConn M. Browse J. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 403-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was fertilized with acd2-2 pollen. All initial attempts to isolate fad3 fad7 fad8 acd2-2 quadruple mutants from ∼5,500 F2 plants failed because putative quadruple mutants died under greenhouse conditions and under long day conditions (more than 11 h) in growth rooms. Consequently, F2 male sterile plants heterozygous for ACD2 were selected to isolate F3 homozygous quadruple mutants in short day conditions (9-h days at relatively low light). Under these permissive conditions, the quadruple mutants produced seed, although plants were severely damaged. The absence of TFAs in the male sterile F2 plants was confirmed by chromatographic analysis (25Miquel M. Browse J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1502-1509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Homozygous acd2-2 mutants were identified at the F3 generation by cleaved amplified polymorphism sequence analysis. For ACD2/acd2-2 allele differentiation, a 387-bp-long fragment was amplified with the forward primer 5′-GTAGAAACAGACTTCGATTTCGATGCAT-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CGGACAAAGAGAGAAGGAGACAC-3′ in a PCR reaction carried out with an annealing temperature of 53 °C. Restriction of acd2-2 alleles with TasI endonuclease (Fermentas) generated two fragments (299 and 84 bp), whereas ACD2 was not digested. The quadruple mutant was maintained by spraying developing inflorescences daily with MeJA (0.01% v/v) under 10 h of light at 100 microeinsteins m-2 s-1. Manual pollination of flowers was necessary to obtain sufficient seed. Under all conditions examined, the quadruple mutants showed more severe lesion formation than the doubles, but the exact timing and extent of lesion formation depends on soil humidity, light, and nutrient conditions and is thus variable.Microarray Experiments—To compare transcript levels between the fad3 fad7 fad8 and the aos mutant, gene expression levels in each mutant were determined using Col-0 as reference in triplicate biologically independent experiments. Complete Arabidopsis Transcriptome MicroArrays (CATMA (26Hilson P. Allemeersch J. Altmann T. Aubourg S. Avon A. Beynon J. Bhalerao R.P. Bitton F. Caboche M. Cannoot B. Chardakov V. Cognet-Holliger C.

Genes were considered up- or down-regulated in the mutants versus Col-0 when the absolute value of the expression ratio (log2) mutant/WT > 1 and p < 0.05. Genes were considered differentially expressed between the fad3 fad7 fad8 and the aos mutant when p < 0.05. Total RNA was extracted from 6-week-old plants grown in 10-h light (100 microeinsteins m-2 s-1) at 22 °C. Protocols for RNA extraction, labeling, hybridization, scanning, and statistics have been previously described (27Reymond P. Bodenhausen N. Van Poecke R.M. Krishnamurthy V. Dicke M. Farmer E.E. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3132-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) and are also available with the microarray data through ArrayExpress under accession numbers E-ATMX-36 (for the aos mutant) and E-ATMX-37 (for the fad3 fad7 fad8 mutant).RESULTSFull Survival of Infection Requires TFAs but Not JA—To investigate a potential JA-independent role of TFAs in the response of Arabidopsis to B. cinerea, the phenotype of the TFA- and JA-deficient mutant, fad3 fad7 fad8 (6McConn M. Browse J. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 403-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was compared with the aos mutant (allene oxide synthase) that lacks the ability to synthesize JA but which contains TFAs (Fig. 1A) (14Mueller M.J. Mène-Saffrané L. Grun C. Karg K. Farmer E.E. Plant J. 2006; 45: 472-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 18Park J.H. Halitschke R. Kim H.B. Baldwin I.T. Feldmann K.A. Feyereisen R. Plant J. 2002; 31: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). No marked differences in lesion formation were observed between the two mutants 2 days after inoculation (supplemental Fig. S1A). However, when disease was allowed to develop over longer periods (9 days), a strong difference was observed between the response of the fad3 fad7 fad8 and the aos mutant (Fig. 1B). At this time point, the youngest central rosette leaves of the fad3 fad7 fad8 mutant died, whereas those of both WT and the aos mutant remained alive. Although 82.9% of WT leaves survived inoculation, fewer (51.2%) leaves in the JA-deficient mutant aos survived. However, the effect of the fad3 fad7 fad8 mutations lacking both JA and TFAs was far greater, and only 3.8% of these leaves survived (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, ∼50% of the aos plants survived and produced seed, whereas all the fad3 fad7 fad8 plants died before producing any seeds. In agreement with this, chlorophyll levels were lower in Botrytis-infected fad3 fad7 fad8 plants than in aos mutants (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, treatment with exogenous MeJA strongly protected aos plants from Botrytis infections but only partially protected the fad3 fad7 fad8 plants (supplemental Fig. S2). This increased sensitivity of the TFA-deficient mutant was also observed in response to the biotrophic oomycete H. arabidopsidis as judged by the number of diseased leaves and by the chlorophyll content (supplemental Fig. S1B). The results showed that properties of TFAs independent of jasmonate production are required for resistance of Arabidopsis to B. cinerea and H. arabidopsidis.Recapitulation of the Cell Survival Phenotype in a Genetic Model—To investigate whether the presence of TFA could affect cell survival in the absence of a pathogen, a lesion mimic mutant was selected for further study. The accelerated cell death2-2 mutant (acd2-2 (19Greenberg J.T. Guo A. Klessig D.F. Ausubel F.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 551-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 28Yao N. Greenberg J.T. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar)) displays spontaneous disease-like lesions and was chosen because the onset of lesion formation is highly predictable and, under appropriate conditions, relatively slow (supplemental Fig. S3). This latter point was considered to be critical given that the effect of TFAs in promoting plant survival of Botrytis infection was observed only over relatively long time scales. ROS production is well documented in acd2-2 (28Yao N. Greenberg J.T. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and we found that TFA oxidation was also accelerated in acd2-2 undergoing lesion formation where both MDA and JA accumulate (supplemental Fig. S3). To test the consequence of TFA depletion on lesion formation, the acd2-2 mutant was crossed into the fad3 fad7 fad8 mutant background. Lesion formation in three different quadruple mutant lines was accelerated with respect to acd2-2 (Fig. 2A) with lesions developing on most of the rosette. Lesions spread from expanded leaves into the growing centers of the quadruple mutants, resulting in their death. The presence of TFAs in acd2-2 strongly impedes centripetal lesion progression into young tissues. Quadruple mutant seeds grown under axenic conditions also display severe tissue damage under short day conditions (not shown), ruling out opportunistic pathogens as a cause of lesion formation in the quadruple mutant.FIGURE 2JA removal and TFA removal differentially accelerate lesion development in acd2-2.

To test whether the selective removal of jasmonate from the acd2-2 mutant led to more rapid cell damage, double mutants were generated from the aos and the acd2-2 mutants and compared with the fad3 fad7 fad8 acd2-2 mutants. The aos acd2-2 plants displayed more severe lesions than the acd2-2 plants, but tissue death was less rapid and much less extensive than in the fad3 fad7 fad8 acd2-2 plants (Fig. 2A). Chlorophyll measurements confirmed these observations and showed greater losses in the quadruple mutants when compared with the double mutants (supplemental Fig. S4). Furthermore, lesions in the aos acd2-2 double mutants did not spread efficiently to the growing center of the plants, most of which survived. Plant survival was monitored over time and showed a first difference between the 3rd and the 4th week when several fad3 fad7 fad8 acd2-2 plants died, whereas all the aos acd2-2 plants survived (Fig. 2B). This increased mortality was also observed after 4, 5, and 6 weeks, times at which less than 40% of fad3 fad7 fad8 acd2-2 plants survived, whereas ∼80% of the aos acd2-2 plants remained alive.Altered ROS Homeostasis in the TFA-deficient Mutant—Resistance to two pathogens or to spreading lesion formation in the acd2-2 mutant requires TFAs independent of JA synthesis. In both cases, long duration oxidative stresses are involved; therefore, the essential role of TFAs may be associated with their availability for oxidation. The oxidation of TFAs by ROS leads to the generation of many lipid oxidation products including MDA (Fig. 1A) and to their subsequent turnover (17Weber H. Chetelat A. Reymond P. Farmer E.E. Plant J. 2004; 37: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). To estimate the extent of TFA oxidation in different genetic backgrounds containing the acd2-2 mutation, MDA levels were determined. In the absence of lesions, Col-0 and the acd2-2 mutant have similar levels of MDA, whereas the fad3 fad7 fad8 mutant contains only 20% of WT level (Fig. 3A, white bars). In the aos mutant, MDA levels correspond to 65% of Col-0 level, showing that ∼35% of the MDA pool in a healthy tissue is maintained in an AOS-dependent manner. In the different lines of the aos acd2-2 and the fad3 fad7 fad8 acd2-2 mutants, levels of MDA were similar to the aos and the fad3 fad7 fad8 parents, respectively. However, when visible lesions appear, the MDA levels increase in all the genotypes analyzed (Fig. 4A, black bars). The level of MDA in acd2-2 leaves is increased by 1.68-fold to reach 97.3 nmol·g-1 dry weight (100%). In the aos acd2-2 mutant lines D1 and D3, MDA levels are similar to the acd2-2 parent (100 and 97% respectively), whereas the line D2 presents a higher amount of MDA (134%). In the fad3 fad7 fad8 acd2-2 mutant lines Q1, Q2, and Q3, the appearance of lesions also correlates with an increase of MDA of 2.3-, 2.0-, and 1.7-fold, respectively; however, these MDA levels were only 17, 14, and 13% of those in acd2-2 leaves with lesions. Because MDA production is the result of ROS action on TFAs, these data demonstrate that ROS associated with the acd2-2 mutation are consumed in the acd2-2 and the aos acd2-2 plants through TFA oxidation. Evidence consistent with altered hydrogen peroxide homeostasis in TFA-deficient plants came from DAB staining, which was more intense in the plant lines carrying the fad3 fad7 fad8 mutations (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Lipid oxidation and evidence of oxidative stress in leaves.

To test the consequences of this intrinsic property of TFAs for gene expression, transcript levels were compared between the aos and the fad3 fad7 fad8 mutants using printed microarrays displaying nearly 20,000 genes. For this, gene expression levels in each mutant were determined by comparing either wild type and aos or wild type and the fad3 fad7 fad8 mutant (see “Experimental Procedures”). From these data, transcript level ratios were compared between the aos and the fad3 fad7 fad8 mutant. These data are available on ArrayExpress. This analysis revealed that 1,610 genes were differentially expressed between the fad3 fad7 fad8 and the aos mutant (Fig. 4A). A sublist of genes up- or down-regulated in the fad3 fad7 fad8 mutant but unchanged in the aos mutant was established (supplemental Table S1), revealing 68 transcripts up-regulated in the fad3 fad7 fad8 mutant but not in the aos mutant. It is noticeable that the function of several of these genes is related to plant defense because this list encompasses the genes encoding the pathogenesis-related proteins PR-1 and PR-5, the avirulence-induced gene AIG1, the gene encoding the phytoalexin-deficient 4 protein PAD4, and two putative disease resistance proteins. Moreover, this list also includes two genes involved in SA biosynthesis ICS1 and SID1 as well as the gene encoding NPR1/NIM1-interacting protein NIMIN-2 (Fig. 4B), suggesting that activity of the SA pathway was enhanced in the TFA-deficient but not in the aos mutant. This was confirmed by SA quantification. The TFA-deficient mutant contained 2.1- and 15.2-fold more free and total SA, respectively, than the aos mutant (Fig. 4C).DISCUSSIONALA and related omega-3 fatty acids are particularly sensitive to oxidation by ROS (5Frankel E.N.

https://openalex.org/W2066501495,"Inactivation and silencing of PTEN have been observed in multiple cancers, including follicular thyroid carcinoma. PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10) functions as a tumour suppressor by opposing the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signalling pathway. Despite correlative data, how deregulated PTEN signalling leads to thyroid carcinogenesis is not known. Mice harbouring a dominant-negative mutant thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRbeta(PV/PV) mice) spontaneously develop follicular thyroid carcinoma and distant metastases similar to human cancer. To elucidate the role of PTEN in thyroid carcinogenesis, we generated TRbeta(PV/PV) mice haploinsufficient for Pten (TRbeta(PV/PV)Pten(+/-) mouse). PTEN deficiency accelerated the progression of thyroid tumour and increased the occurrence of metastasis spread to the lung in TRbeta(PV/PV)Pten(+/-) mice, thereby significantly reducing their survival as compared with TRbeta(PV/PV)Pten(+/+) mice. AKT activation was further increased by two-fold in TRbeta(PV/PV)Pten(+/-) mice thyroids, leading to increased activity of the downstream mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-p70S6K signalling and decreased activity of the forkhead family member FOXO3a. Consistently, cyclin D1 expression was increased. Apoptosis was decreased as indicated by increased expression of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and decreased caspase-3 activity in the thyroids of TRbeta(PV/PV)Pten(+/-) mice. Our results indicate that PTEN deficiency resulted in increased cell proliferation and survival in the thyroids of TRbeta(PV/PV)Pten(+/-) mice. Altogether, our study provides direct evidence to indicate that in vivo, PTEN is a critical regulator in the follicular thyroid cancer progression and invasiveness."

To examine whether oxysterol-membrane interactions contribute to the regulation of cellular cholesterol homeostasis, we synthesized the enantiomer of 25-hydroxycholesterol. Using this unique oxysterol probe, we provide evidence that oxysterol regulation of cholesterol homeostatic responses is not mediated by enantiospecific oxysterol-protein interactions. We show that side chain oxysterols, but not steroid ring-modified oxysterols, exhibit membrane expansion behavior in phospholipid monolayers and bilayers in vitro. This behavior is non-enantiospecific and is abrogated by increasing the saturation of phospholipid acyl chain constituents. Moreover, we extend these findings into cultured cells by showing that exposure to saturated fatty acids at concentrations that lead to endoplasmic reticulum membrane phospholipid remodeling inhibits oxysterol activity. These studies implicate oxysterol-membrane interactions in acute regulation of sterol homeostatic responses and provide new insights into the mechanism through which oxysterols regulate cellular cholesterol balance.

These studies implicate oxysterol-membrane interactions in acute regulation of sterol homeostatic responses and provide new insights into the mechanism through which oxysterols regulate cellular cholesterol balance. Cellular cholesterol requirements are met through de novo cholesterol synthesis and uptake of lipoprotein cholesterol. These homeostatic responses are regulated at multiple steps through a negative feedback loop that responds to elevations in cellular cholesterol. Central to this pathway is the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 3The abbreviations used are: SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; SRE, sterol regulatory element; HMGR, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase; HC, hydroxycholesterol; ent-25-HC, enantiomer of 25-Hydroxycholesterol; nat-25-HC, natural 25-Hydroxycholesterol; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SCAP, SREBP cleavage-activating protein; LXR, liver X receptor; PM, plasma membrane; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; LPDS, lipoprotein-deficient bovine serum; CF, carboxyfluorescein; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; POPC, palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine; DPPC, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine; DOPC, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; CD, methyl β-cyclodextrin; 7-KC, 7-ketocholesterol. family of transcription factors, which directly activates expression of genes involved in the synthesis and uptake of cholesterol and lipogenesis. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), cholesterol modulates SREBP processing by binding to the sterol-sensing domain of SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) and inducing conformational change in SCAP (1Radhakrishnan A. Sun L.P. Kwon H.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Cholesterol also promotes interaction between SCAP and the ER retention proteins, Insig-1 and Insig-2, which in turn prevents movement of the SCAP-SREBP complex to the Golgi and maturation of the SREBP transcription factors (1Radhakrishnan A.

Cholesterol homeostasis is governed not only by its end product, cholesterol, but also by oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol, known as oxysterols. Side chain oxysterols, such as 24-, 25-, and 27-hydroxycholesterol (HC), are generated enzymatically in vivo and are important physiological regulators of cholesterol homeostasis. These side chain oxysterols contribute to the maintenance of cellular cholesterol balance by serving as endogenous ligands for the liver X receptors (LXRs), which activate cholesterol elimination and efflux pathways (3Chawla A. Repa J.J. Evans R.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1866-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar), and through suppression of SREBP proteolysis. Unlike cholesterol, the side chain oxygenated sterols 25-HC and 27-HC do not induce conformational changes in SCAP and are unable to bind to the sterol-sensing domain of SCAP (1Radhakrishnan A.

Rather, 25-HC and 27-HC have been shown to bind to the Insig proteins, promoting interaction between SCAP and Insig proteins (5Radhakrishnan A. Ikeda Y. Kwon H.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 6511-6518Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) and retention of the SCAP-SREBP complex in the ER. Binding of side chain oxysterols to Insig proteins also promotes rapid proteolytic inactivation of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR), the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis (6Song B.L. Javitt N.B. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 179-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Synthesis of side chain oxysterols is required for rapid inactivation of HMGR in response to excess cellular cholesterol (7Lange Y. Ory D.S. Ye J. Lanier M.H. Hsu F.F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1445-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Side chain oxysterols also contribute to cholesterol homeostasis by promoting the transfer of cholesterol to ER membranes (8Frolov A. Zielinski S.E. Crowley J.R. Dudley-Rucker N. Schaffer J.E. Ory D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25517-25525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 9Lange Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3411-3414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rapid influx of cholesterol into the ER suppresses SREBP processing, possibly through the modulation of SCAP conformation, and stimulates acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase activity. The activation of acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase prevents cholesterol cytotoxicity by promoting esterification of ER-associated free cholesterol and storage of cholesterol esters in neutral lipid droplets. Although the mechanism of oxysterol-mediated transfer of cholesterol into the ER is not well understood, 25-HC, like known membrane-intercalating agents (e.g. n-octanol and 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol), has been shown to increase susceptibility of membrane cholesterol to cyclodextrin extraction and interaction with cholesterol oxidase (10Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11664-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The effect of oxysterols on ER cholesterol levels may reflect their ability to compete with cholesterol for association with membrane lipids (e.g. in the plasma membrane (PM)), thereby increasing the availability of membrane cholesterol for translocation into the ER (10Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11664-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In model membrane systems, oxysterols affect the formation of liquid-ordered phases and alter phospholipid packing (11Massey J.B. Pownall H.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10747-10758Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The differential membrane properties of specific oxysterols are dependent on the chemical nature and location of the oxidative modification of the sterol, as well as the phospholipid composition of the membranes (11Massey J.B. Pownall H.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10747-10758Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined whether such oxysterol-membrane interactions contribute to the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis in vivo. We used a unique oxysterol probe, the enantiomer of 25-HC (ent-25-HC), to deconvolute membrane effects of oxysterols from effects of oxysterol-protein interactions. We provide evidence that oxysterols contribute to the regulation of cholesterol homeostatic responses through non-stereospecific interactions. We show that the behavior of side chain oxysterols in phospholipid monolayers and bilayers in vitro is non-enantiospecific and is modulated both in vitro and in cells by the degree of saturation of phospholipid acyl chain constituents. Our findings support a role for direct oxysterol-membrane interactions in regulating cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Cell Culture and Chemicals—CHO-K1 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in 1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:Ham's F-12 with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were maintained in monolayer culture at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For esterification and luciferase assays, cells were incubated in medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) (CoCalico Biologicals). Oxysterols were obtained from Steraloids (25-HC, 7α-HC, 7β-HC), Sigma (7-ketocholesterol (7-KC)), and Research Plus (27-HC) and were provided to cells dissolved in ethanol (final concentration of 0.01% in the medium). As enantiomeric steroids are not naturally available, ent-25-HC was prepared by total steroid synthesis (stepwise construction of ring system and side chain) as described (12Westover E.J. Covey D.F. Steroids. 2006; 71: 484-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Luciferase Reporter Assays—For the quantification of SREBP-dependent gene expression, transfection assays with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were performed as described (8Frolov A. Zielinski S.E.

For these experiments, cells were transfected either with pLDLp-588luc, driven by the human low density lipoprotien receptor promoter, or with pSynSRE (gift from T.

For measurement of LXR-dependent gene expression, cells were transfected with a reporter containing 990 bp of the human ABCA1 promoter linked to a luciferase reporter construct (gift from S.

Oxysterols were provided to cells dissolved in ethanol (final concentration of 0.01% in the medium). HMGR Degradation Assay—CHO cells were transfected with an HMGR-green fluorescent protein expression construct (gift from R. Simoni and T. Y. Chang) harboring a D766N point mutation in the catalytic domain, and clonal lines were isolated. For the quantification of HMGR degradation, HMGR-green fluorescent protein-expressing cell lines were cultured overnight in LPDS medium containing 20 μm compactin and 50 μm mevalonate and treated with oxysterols as described, and green fluorescent protein fluorescence was measured in triplicate by flow cytometry. Cholesterol Esterification Assays—Cells were incubated in LPDS medium in the presence and absence of fatty acids for 24 h. The following day, cells were pulsed at 4 °C for 10 min with [3H]cholesterol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) methyl-β-cyclodextrin (CD; Sigma) (16Cruz J.C. Sugii S. Yu C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were incubated in the presence and absence of oxysterols and/or fatty acids for the indicated times. Lipids were extracted, separated by TLC, and analyzed as described previously (17Millard E. Gale S. Dudley N. Zhang J. Schaffer J. Ory D. J. Biol.

Monolayer Studies—Surface pressure-molecular area isotherms (see Fig. 3) were determined using a Langmuir-type surface balance as described previously (18Smaby J.M. Momsen M.M. Brockman H.L. Brown R.E. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1492-1505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The monolayer behaviors of nat- and ent-25-hydroxycholesterol alone and in mixtures with various lipids (see Fig. 4) were examined using a Langmuir film balance (KSV).FIGURE 4Surface pressure-molecular area isotherms for mixed monolayers of nat- and ent-25-HC with DOPC (A and D), POPC (B and E), and DPPC (C and F).

Papahadjopoulos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4194-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (2380) Google Scholar). Liposomes with a mean diameter of 207 ± 12.5 nm S.D., as measured by light scattering with a Beckman-Coulter N5 submicron particle size analyzer, were used for CF dequenching and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments. Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy—The incorporation of oxysterols into dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC)/dioleoylphosphatidic acid (70:30) liposomes was determined by SPR spectroscopy. Liposomes (3 ng of phospholipid) were immobilized on an L1 chip and the indicated oxysterol at 1 μm was injected into the chamber at a volume replacement rate of two times/s. Liposome lipid and oxysterol accumulating in the liposome bilayer were determined by the SPR signal and used to calculate the mol % of oxysterol. Fluorescence Dequenching Assay Spectroscopy—Liposomes were prepared as described above. The fluorescence dequenching assay was performed as described previously (20Rex S. Schwarz G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2336-2345Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 ng of liposome lipid containing 20 mm CF was placed in a 500-μl spectrofluorometric cuvette, and the indicated concentration of oxysterol (1-50 μm) was added to the solution. Fluorescence was monitored at 520 nm and normalized to the total dequenching following the addition of 1% Triton X-100. Where indicated, 5 mm CD was added to extract oxysterol from liposomes. This concentration of CD did not quench CF fluorescence in solution or after solubilization of liposomes with Triton X-100. Values are normalized to the fluorescence measured following Triton X-100 addition at the end of each time series and corrected for solvent effects. Subcellular Fractionation and Western Blot Analysis—Subcellular fractionation of CHO cells, isolation of ER-enriched microsomes, and Western blotting were performed as described (21Borradaile N.M.

Cholesterol Mass Measurements—Lipids were extracted from total cellular and ER-enriched fractions using the Bligh and Dyer method, and cholesterol mass was determined as described previously by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (8Frolov A.

Lipid Determination by Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry—Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry as described previously (22Gale S.E. Frolov A.

Data shown are representative of at least two similar experiments. Effect of Oxysterols on Regulating Cholesterol Movement into ER Membranes—To investigate the molecular mechanism of oxysterol regulation of cholesterol homeostasis, we first characterized structure-activity relationships of a panel of biologically active oxysterols. Using a sterol regulatory element-containing reporter construct as an indicator of the status of SREBP maturation, we examined the ability of both side chain oxysterols (25-HC and 27-HC) and steroid B ring-modified oxysterols (7α-HC, 7β-HC, and 7-KC) to suppress SREBP-dependent gene expression (Fig. 1A). We found that the EC50 values for suppression of sterol-regulated gene expression by 25-HC and 27-HC are 0.17 and 0.20 μm, respectively, and that these side chain oxysterols were ∼20-fold more potent than 7α-HC, 7β-HC, and 7-KC. Similar structure-activity relationships for the oxysterols were observed in the trafficking of cholesterol to the ER, as assessed by cholesterol esterification assays. The rate of oxysterol-induced transfer of PM cholesterol into ER membranes correlated directly with the ability of specific oxysterols to suppress SREBP-mediated gene expression (Fig. 1B). These dichotomous effects of the side chain and steroid ring-modified oxysterols closely mirror the specificity for oxysterol binding to Insig-2 (5Radhakrishnan A. Ikeda Y. Kwon H.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 6511-6518Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). However, the non-stoichiometric Insig-oxysterol binding suggests that oxysterols may exert their effect on SREBP-dependent gene expression through additional mechanisms (5Radhakrishnan A. Ikeda Y. Kwon H.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 6511-6518Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). To further delineate the mechanism of action of oxysterols, we synthesized ent-25-HC (Fig. 2A) (12Westover E.J. Covey D.F. Steroids. 2006; 71: 484-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Whereas enantiomeric steroid pairs have been shown to have identical effects on membrane lipids, steroid-protein interactions are in general enantiospecific (23Westover E.J. Covey D.F. J. Membr. Biol. 2004; 202: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Oxysterol-protein interactions are similarly enantioselective, as evidenced by the ability of natural 25-HC (nat-25-HC), but not ent-25-HC, to ligand LXR and activate target gene expression (Fig. 2B). In the SREBP reporter assay, the EC50 for ent-25-HC for suppression of sterol-regulated gene expression was 6-fold lower than the EC50 for nat-25-HC, although ent-25-HC was still significantly more potent than the steroid ring-modified oxysterols (Fig. 1A). When the assay was performed using a reporter construct driven by a minimal promoter regulated by tandem SRE sequences (15Worgall T.S. Sturley S.L. Seo T. Osborne T.F. Deckelbaum R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25537-25540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) instead of the human low density lipoprotein receptor promoter, differences between nat- and ent-25-HC were no longer apparent (Fig. 2C), suggesting that oxysterols may additionally modulate expression from the low density lipoprotein receptor promoter through non-SRE sequences and that such a mechanism is likely introducing an enantioselective step into regulation of reporter expression. The recent identification of novel negative LXR response elements in the promoters of SREBP-2 target genes provides a plausible explanation for the apparent partial enantioselectivity (24Wang Y. Rogers P.M. Su C. Varga G. Stayrook K.R. Burris T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26332-26339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Reporter activity was dependent on the SRE sequences because the introduction of point mutations into the SREs abrogated the effects of the oxysterols (Fig. 2C). To further clarify the mechanism by which oxysterols acutely regulate cholesterol homeostasis, we compared the effect of the oxysterols on degradation of HMGR, an independent Insig-mediated sterol homeostatic response (6Song B.L. Javitt N.B. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 179-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Similar to the SREBP reporter assay, the EC50 values were significantly lower for 25-HC and 27-HC than for the ring-modified oxysterols (Fig. 2D). Moreover, consistent with the SRE-minimal promoter assay (Fig. 2C), nat- and ent-25-HC were equally effective in promoting the HMGR degradation, and degradation of the protein was detected within 2 h post-incubation (Fig. 2E). Together, our findings demonstrate that 25-HC likely modulates acute sterol homeostatic responses through non-enantiospecific interactions. Effect of Oxysterols on Defined Monolayer and Bilayer Membranes—We modeled the interaction of oxysterols with biological membranes by first studying the monolayer behavior of both the side chain and steroid ring-modified oxysterols in various phospholipid mixtures. The Langmuir film balance is widely used for the characterization of sterol-phospholipid interaction (18Smaby J.M. Momsen M.M. Brockman H.L. Brown R.E. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1492-1505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 25Westover E.J. Covey D.F. Brockman H.L. Brown R.E. Pike L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51125-51133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In these experiments, the molecular areas of the oxysterols in the membranes were examined as a function of the sterol mole fraction at a constant surface pressure (5 millinewtons/m). We found that mixtures of 25-HC or 27-HC with DOPC (only monounsaturated 18:1 acyl chains) were expanded (i.e. increased mean molecular areas) relative to the ideal (non-interacting) mixture of components (Fig. 3, A and B). The positive deviations from ideal behavior, which indicate an expansion effect, covered a considerable range (0 < XHC < 0.5) and peaked at XHC of 0.2-0.3 (Fig. 3, black lines). This response contrasts with the behavior of 7α-HC with DOPC, which was similar to the theoretical ideal mixture of the pure components (Fig. 3C), and with mixtures of 7β-HC and 7-KC with DOPC, which exhibited mean molecular areas slightly less than the theoretical ideal when sterol mole fractions exceeded 0.3 (Fig. 3, D and E). The latter observations suggest that 7β-HC and 7-KC exert only a slight condensing or membrane-ordering effect in DOPC monolayers, in contrast to the more substantial condensing effect of cholesterol (Fig. 3F) (18Smaby J.M. Momsen M.M. Brockman H.L. Brown R.E. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1492-1505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). To assess the role of acyl chain saturation in the regulation of phospholipid-oxysterol lateral interactions, we investigated the monolayer behavior of the side chain oxysterols mixed with phospholipids containing increasingly saturated acyl chains. Compared with mixtures involving DOPC, oxysterols mixed with palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC; saturated 16:0 and monounsaturated 18:1 acyl chains) or with dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC; only saturated 16:0 acyl chains) displayed diminished expansion effects that became progressively more negative as the saturation state of the phosphatidylcholine (PC) acyl chains increased: DOPC ≥ POPC > DPPC (Fig. 3, red lines, and supplemental Fig. 1). To determine the stereospecificity of the oxysterol-phospholipid interaction, we examined the monolayer behavior of the nat- and ent-25-HC enantiomeric pair in DOPC, POPC, and DPPC phospholipid mixtures. We found that the membrane activity of ent-25-HC was identical to that of nat-25-HC (Fig. 4). These findings demonstrate that the oxysterol-membrane interaction responsible for the expansion effect of 25-HC in the DOPC and POPC mixtures and for the abrogation effect of the saturated acyl chains is non-enantioselective. We next investigated the membrane behavior of oxysterols in DOPC/dioleoylphosphatidic acid-containing liposomes (i.e. membrane bilayers). For these studies, we employed a fluorescence dequenching assay that has been extensively used to study pore activation and swelling of liposomes (26Mathai J.C. Tristram-Nagle S. Nagle J.F. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2008; 131: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In these experiments, CF dye is contained in the liposome at quenching concentrations, and the fluorescence increases when the dye is released or when the internal volume of the liposome is increased, diluting the dye concentration. The addition of 25-HC led to a dose-dependent increase in fractional fluorescence dequenching (Fig. 5A). The dequenching effects of 25-HC exhibited a clear dose response over a broad range of concentrations (1-70 μm) (Fig. 5B). Similar fluorescence dequenching was observed following incubation with 27-HC, but was much less apparent with the steroid ring-modified oxysterols, 7α-HC, 7β-HC, and 7-KC (Fig. 5C). The more pronounced effect of the side chain oxysterols as compared with ring-modified oxysterols was not due to greater accumulation of these oxysterols in the liposome membranes, as less 25-HC was incorporated into the liposomes than, for example, 7-KC over the time course of the dequenching assay (XHC at 300 s, 0.033 for 27-HC, 0.083 for 25-HC, 0.31 for 7α-HC, 0.28 for 7β-HC, and 0.20 for 7-KC; p < 0.05) (Fig. 5D). Indeed, when dequenching assay data are normalized for the extent of oxysterol incorporation, then 27-HC, which has the lowest rate of incorporation into liposomes, exhibits nearly identical membrane expansion properties as 25-HC. To exclude the possibility that the dequenching effect of 25-HC resulted from physical disruption of liposomes and carboxyfluorescein release, we performed the assay by first incubating the liposomes with oxysterol, followed by the addition of excess CD, an avid sterol acceptor (Fig. 5E). Because CD was able to completely reverse the fluorescence dequenching induced by 25-HC, the increase in fluorescence is consistent with membrane expansion caused by a reversible oxysterol-membrane interaction, rather than through liposome disruption and release of the fluorophore. Importantly, the specificity of the sterol-membrane expansion for side chain versus steroid ring-modified oxysterols in the liposome studies mirrors the differential effect of the oxysterols in membrane monolayers in vitro and the cell-based structure-activity relationships with respect to sterol-regulated gene expression. Modulation of Oxysterol Effects on Sterol-regulated Gene Expression by Fatty Acid Supplementation—To extend our observations of the effect of oxysterols on model membranes to a cell-based model, we studied the effect of fatty acid supplementation on sterol-regulated gene expression in CHO cells. We supplemented media with free fatty acid-bovine serum albumin complexes such that the fatty acid concentrations were below that which activates apoptotic lipotoxic pathways (data not shown). Incubation with the saturated fatty acid palmitate (16:0), but not the monounsaturated fatty acid oleate (18:1), increased the stability of HMGR (Fig. 6A). Palmitate treatment relieved 25-HC-mediated suppression of HMGR degradation and attenuated the suppressive effects of either nat- or ent-25-HC in a non-enantioselective manner (Fig. 6B). Palmitate supplementation similarly modulated SREBP-dependent gene e"

This theory will result from collaborations between neuroscientists and economists and will benefit from input from other fields, including computer science and psychology. The long-run goal of neuroeconomics is to create a theory of economic choice and exchange that is neurally detailed, mathematically accurate, and behaviorally relevant. This theory will result from collaborations between neuroscientists and economists and will benefit from input from other fields, including computer science and psychology. Neuroeconomics is a combination of mathematical frameworks, experimental paradigms, and lab and field behavioral data about peoples' choices (from economics) and measures of neural activity (from neuroscience). The goal is to relate mathematical theories of choice to neural measures, to build hypotheses that constrain competing economic theories, to predict effects of cognitive and emotional factors on individual choices, and to suggest when people do not always choose what is best for them (and what good policies follow). Imagine entering a bookstore looking for vacation reading. There are an enormous number of choices (a typical Border's might have 100,000). The cover art, size, font, and heft of books all invoke sensory processing that might influence what you buy. Picking up a possible purchase, memories about similar books that were loved and hated are called up by an internal self-recommendation system. Was it recommended by Oprah or by friends? (Social processing kicks in.) If it's an unknown author, there is a vague risk that the book is awful. If it is a hardback by a favorite author, is it worth waiting a while for the cheaper paperback to save some money? Theories in economics generally start with the presumption that choices like these, from different sets of books, are consistent in special mathematical ways. For example, if you're holding book A you should not then trade A for B, B for C, and trade C back for A again (exhibiting an “intransitive cycle”). If you can always make up your mind between two books, and don't choose in a cycle, then you are acting as if you are implicitly assigning ordered numbers to all the books and picking the higher-numbered book. Economists call these implicit numbers “utilities.” The theory of utility-maximization says people make the best choices given what they want, know, and can afford. This “preferences-information-constraints” mathematical framework can be applied to a wide range of market and political choices, including social ones in which the choices of other people influence a person's behavior (game theory). While utility-maximization might appear to be an implausible interpretation of what people shopping in the bookstore are literally thinking and doing, it makes predictions that are correct in a wide range of settings (e.g., when the price of a good goes up people buy less of it), even for many animal species. Economists are proudly agnostic about the neural basis of utilities: if we are unable to find measures of neural activity that correlate with numerical utilities, most economists would not abandon the theory. Given the agnostic stance, what can neuroscience add (Bernheim, 2008Bernheim B.D. Glimcher P. Neuroeconomics: Decision Making and the Brain. Elsevier, New York2008: 115-126Google Scholar)? Some studies will show neural circuitry that does appear to implement utility computation. Knowing how that circuitry works will have some novel implications. Such knowledge could also establish the limits of consumers' cognition in understanding the consequences of their choices, and inform policy. Neuroscience probably has more to contribute to understanding consumer decision making (demand) than to understanding the supply of goods, except for some topics like how emotions, norms, and rewards motivate workers, how job skills (“human capital”) develop in the brain, and how service experiences are valued. Figure 1 contrasts neuroeconomic elements of choice with constructs in “behavioral economics” and standard economics. Behavioral economics uses psychological facts and constructs to incorporate limits on computational ability, willpower, and self-interest in economic analysis. These limits are often incorporated by adding a behavioral parameter or process to a standard economic model. A close correspondence between neural activity and some version of economic theory (including extra behavioral processes) is already emerging—tentatively, of course. The diagram suggests at least three fundamental questions. (1) In neuroscientific models, stable behavioral choice patterns are the end result of learning; in economic models, they are the starting point of analysis. This contrast raises a question: when are learning processes consistent with choice patterns reflective of stable preferences? One answer is that rational economic theories probably are good approximations when choices are simple and repeated in a stationary environment, so that goal and decision values can be learned. If you eat regularly at a local restaurant for many years and sample most of the dishes, an unchanging menu may become like a list of conditioned stimuli that evoke stable valuation signals. Your menu choices might then satisfy economic consistency axioms to a surprising degree. In such choices, a form of learning referred to as temporal difference (TD) learning is often thought to apply. In TD learning, the gap between the actual outcome and a person's expectation of value, called the “prediction error,” is used to adjust the estimate of goal value. Mathematical analyses show that TD learning can be used to learn even complex goal values and strategies (e.g., a leading backgammon algorithm uses TD learning). Many studies have shown neural correlates of TD learning during goal-oriented choice. Early evidence showed that neural firing rates in midbrain dopaminergic neurons, which project to the striatum and prefrontal cortex (Schultz et al., 1997Schultz W. Dayan P. Montague P.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1593-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (5914) Google Scholar), appear to encode TD error. fMRI signals of TD errors were later found in the striatum (O'Doherty et al., 2003O'Doherty J.P. Dayan P. Friston K. Critchley H. Dolan R.J. Neuron. 2003; 38: 329-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). The striatal regions are active when people imagine possible counterfactual outcomes (“fictive learning,” Lohrenz et al., 2007Lohrenz T. McCabe K. Camerer C.F. Montague P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 9493-9498Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and when rewards are social (Fehr and Camerer, 2007Fehr E. Camerer C.F. Trends Cogn. Sci. 2007; 11: 419-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). TD learning will generate reliable stable goal values, which sets the stage for showing a strong “neurometric” correlation between measures of neural activity and the economists' inferred utility value of such goods in practiced or familiar choices. Neural firing rates from single-unit recordings correlate with the inferred value of choices in risky games (Platt and Glimcher, 1999Platt M.L. Glimcher P.W. Nature. 1999; 400: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar) and with behavioral choices between different juice rewards (Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006Padoa-Schioppa C. Assad J.A. Nature. 2006; 441: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). Other studies show very reliable correlations between the strength of fMRI signals in human medial OFC and values assigned to foods, wine, charitable giving, and consumer goods (Hare et al., 2008Hare T.A. O'Doherty J. Camerer C.F. Schultz W. Rangel A. J. Neurol. 2008; 28: 5623-5630Google Scholar). Despite the assertion of agnostic economists that people only act “as if” they maximize utility, these studies suggest that there really are neural measures that deserve to be called utilities! However, many complex decisions are so infrequent that convergence is unlikely to occur through TD learning. Shopping for books, for example, involves integration of sensory, abstract, and memory processing, social influence, budget constraint, and tradeoffs about risk (new authors) and time (waiting for paperbacks). And new books are always coming out. Choosing a house or college is even more complex and uses abstract propositional inputs. A challenge for neuroeconomics is to show what neural systems collaborate in these types of complex, high-stakes, slowly learned decisions. (2) How do internal and external constraints influence choice? The “representation” box in Figure 1 includes both external and internal constraints. In economic theory, the typical external constraints are prices of goods (interpreted broadly to include time and social factors) and a consumer's income. However, in standard economic theory, it is rare that any internal constraints are made explicit. Consumers are usually assumed to choose, given their preferences and information, optimally and unemotionally. However, economists have a concept of “state dependence” of utility—e.g., the demand for food goes up when you are in a hunger state. However, the states are usually assumed to affect preferences and are not under cognitive control. Cognitive neuroscience could illuminate the influence of internal constraints on economic choice. An example is emotional regulation. Subjects instructed to “reappraise” fearful stimuli in a way that allows them to consciously dampen their fear responses show less activity in amygdala and more activity in the prefrontal cortex (two parts of an apparent regulatory circuit). This cognitive reappraisal paradigm has been extended to economic choices of risky gambles; preliminary evidence suggests that downregulation of loss aversion reduces the tendency to avoid gambles that may yield losses and reduces skin conductance (suggesting a reduction in negative emotional response). There are many more researchable examples from bargaining, bluffing, and selling. In these cases, a cognitive process can be both “chosen” and then influence valuation of choices. (3) One of the most solid findings in the neuroeconomics of reward is that dissociable systems guide three distinctly different types of valuation: Pavlovian conditioning systems (learning to associate a particular conditioning cue with later reward), habit systems, and goal-directed systems. A basic question is how do these different valuation systems work and interact? Standard economic theory does not explicitly recognize these different types of valuation (though the theory could be extended to include them). Their differences can have important economic consequences. For example, the habit system is likely to be slow to respond to abrupt changes, such as a sharp jump in the price of gas. For the habit system, a sudden change in an item's price requires a change in our behavioral response that is analogous to “reversal learning.” Economists do typically distinguish short-run and long-run responses to large changes, but this distinction is rarely linked to details of learning and therefore has little predictive power. Conversely, the goal-directed valuation system will typically involve a lot of top-down processing of numerical and abstract concepts (or should!), such as “crunching the numbers” in valuing complex decisions (e.g., buying solar panels). This type of processing implies that consistency of choices is likely to be modulated by variables related to expertise, cognition, attention, and so forth. What happens when valuation systems conflict? Economists have approached this question using “dual-system” models, e.g., one model of addiction (Bernheim and Rangel, 2004Bernheim B.D. Rangel A. Am. Econ. Rev. 2004; 94: 1558-1590Crossref Scopus (378) Google Scholar) distinguishes “hot” states, in which habit rules, from “cold” states, in which choice is goal directed. In the cold state, people can either deliberately invest in kicking an addiction or can take a chance on whether a hot state will develop and result in craving. Since these dual-system models sometimes create analogies between two types of interacting economic agents and two similar types of brain processes, neural tests of them provide the most direct evidence. Some progress has already been made in finding neural correlates of behavioral economics models of time preference, social reward, strategic thinking, and risky choice. For brevity, I will only discuss the latter. In standard economic models, gambles have possible outcomes x with associated probabilities p(x). Gambles could be monetary ones, like lottery tickets, or de facto lotteries like going to college hoping to earn more, starting a small business, or running a quick errand without feeding a parking meter. A normatively appealing theory, called “expected utility,” is that such gambles are valued by weighting the hedonic utility of possible outcomes by the chances of those outcomes actually occurring. A modified view, called “prospect theory,” differs in two ways: probabilities are not always weighted by their numerical value, and outcomes are valued relative to a reference point. There is much lab evidence and some field evidence (e.g., from game shows and stock prices) consistent with prospect theory and emerging neuroscientific evidence. Choices do appear to implicitly weight probabilities nonlinearly. Preliminary evidence from Hsu et al. using fMRI shows striatal valuation signals that imply that a one-in-a-million chance has a neural weight of 0.02. This process is consistent with economic overreactions to tiny chances of blissful outcomes (e.g., winning a lottery) and rare catastrophes (e.g., plane crashes). Prospect theory also proposes that choice outcomes have a “reference-dependent” value v(x − r) relative to a point of reference along with an absolute utility u(x). The value v(x − r) is thought to reflect hedonic adaptation to the past, or valuation relative to a future aspiration. However, this reference-dependent component of “value” might be somehow related to a learning signal (a la TD learning). Reference dependence implies that choices may reverse when a natural point of reference is reversed (a “framing” effect). De Martino et al., 2006De Martino B. Kumaran D. Seymour B. Dolan R. Science. 2006; 313: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar, De Martino et al., 2008De Martino B. Harrison N. Knafo S. Bird G. Dolan R. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 10746-10750Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar find that lateral OFC activity is correlated with reversal tendencies across subjects, and reversals are also less common in autistic subjects. Another implication is that “losses” relative to a reference point (x < r) and “gains” (x > r) could have different neural bases and implications. Indeed, many studies with humans (and some with monkeys) find that the pattern of observed choices implies an aversion to loss—losses are valued about twice as large as equal-sized gains. This “loss aversion” correlates with differential brain activations to increased gain and reduced loss using fMRI (Tom et al., 2007Tom S. Fox C. Trepel C. Poldrack R. Science. 2007; 315: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). Still another implication is that owning goods creates a reference point, so that selling goods is a distasteful loss, which creates an “endowment effect” compared to buying unowned goods. fMRI evidence suggests that this effect is not due to an exaggerated valuation, but to a heightened sensation of unpleasant loss when selling (Knutson et al., 2008Knutson B. Wimmer G.E. Rick S. Hallon N.G. Prelec D. Loewenstein G. Neuron. 2008; 58: 814-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These studies show how prospect theory parameters, inferred mathematically from behavior, often correlate with neural activity in regions generally thought to be involved in valuation judgments or learning. These neurometric correlations can be used to make behavioral economic predictions that can be validated by lesion patient studies, TMS, and single-unit recording and stimulation. Knowing how a brain region's activity is linked to behavioral parameters also invites predictions about how decisions would change across the lifecycle, across genetic backgrounds, and in response to pharmacological intervention. Economists have mixed feelings about neuroeconomics. Many think direct neural evidence is unnecessary. Others share the skepticism of cognitive psychologists (and many neuroscientists) about how rapidly techniques like fMRI will yield surprising conclusions about complex economic choice processes. Still others are cautiously optimistic and think that exploring new technologies has option value."

Our progress in this field has shown steady growth over the years but has also been interspersed with sudden jumps of discovery. These leaps have normally been associated with the introduction of a new technical advance or the development of a new biological preparation; therefore, it is quite certain that we have not seen them all. In this perspective I tell the story (albeit a clearly abridged version) of how our knowledge of ion conduction through ion channels has evolved from a purely electrical concept to a structural dynamics view of ions interacting with a membrane protein. Our progress in this field has shown steady growth over the years but has also been interspersed with sudden jumps of discovery. These leaps have normally been associated with the introduction of a new technical advance or the development of a new biological preparation; therefore, it is quite certain that we have not seen them all. The ion channels field is a longstanding and distinguished one that has steadily grown and matured, often as a direct reflection of our ability to address questions in new and unique ways. In telling this brief history of the ion channels field, I've therefore organized this “story” around the experimental jumps that have expanded our understanding and opened up new avenues for investigation. As you read on, you will see that the early description of conductances was simply a study of voltage and current at the level of a black box because there was no indication of the physical basis of the conductances. It is remarkable, however, that the concept of a conducting pore as part of an ionic channel with properties of permeation, selectivity, and gating was introduced quite early, even before there were any data on ion channel molecular structure. In fact, many of these concepts were pretty well established in the 1970s from biophysical experiments when the channels were drawn as cartoons as an attempt to describe what was in the black box. This era was followed by an expansion in the use of unique biological preparations that allowed us to address new and interesting questions, along with leaps in insight gained from our understanding of the operation of single molecules by the introduction of the patch-clamp technique. The subsequent era of cloning initiated our understanding of ion channels at the molecular level, an understanding that has been further expanded by the crystal structures and spectroscopic methods that then followed. And, while the future is always hard (one might even say impossible) to predict, it's clear that there will be many more exciting advances to come. I trust you will indulge me as I also attempt to give you some of my ideas of what we might expect in the near future, given the present advances. You as the reader may decide to go quickly over the first two sections, spending more time in the last three sections because those are directly relevant to the research done today in ion channels. Yet, please remember that we can often learn much from our past. Exposing the experiments and concepts developed during those first eras gives an appropriate historical perspective and, in my view, helps one to gain a deeper understanding of the rich and unique nature of the ion channels field. The lipid bilayer that makes up the cell membrane is an essentially insurmountable barrier for the flow of ions; therefore, ion transport is carried out by membrane-embedded specialized proteins in the form of transporters and ion channels. Although this statement is obvious to everyone today, it was not clear at all just over half a century ago. In the early 1900s Bernstein explained correctly the resting potential of a cell as a diffusion potential (Bernstein, 1902Bernstein, J. (1902). Untersuchungen zur Thermodynamik der bioelecktrischen Strome. Erster Theil Arch ges Physiol 92, 521–562.Google Scholar), but most of the attention in the field was given to the changes in membrane potential. This explains why the history of ion channel research is intimately connected with the study of the physical basis of the initiation and propagation of the nerve impulse. Bernstein also proposed a mechanism for the action potential, attributing the sudden potential change to a simple breakdown of the normal K+ selectivity of the membrane. This concept had to be revised when Hodgkin and Huxley and Curtis and Cole measured the actual time course of the action potential in the squid giant axon, revealing an actual reversal of the membrane potential at the peak of the impulse (Hodgkin and Huxley, 1939Hodgkin A.L. Huxley A.F. Action potentials recorded from inside a nerve fiber.Nature. 1939; 144: 710-711Crossref Google Scholar, Curtis and Cole, 1940Curtis H.J. Cole K.S. Membrane action potentials from the squid giant axon.J. Cell. Comp. Physiol. 1940; 15: 145-147Crossref Google Scholar). This experiment was possible because the large size of the squid axon allowed the introduction of an internal electrode and thus permitted the measurement of the real transmembrane potential difference. The measurement of the action potential is one of the multiple examples of the critical role that the squid giant axon has played in our understanding of membrane transport. In fact, its importance can hardly be overemphasized. The concept of the membrane behaving electrically as a capacitor in parallel with a resistance (or conductance) with an electromotive force was well accepted in the 1930s (see Cole, 1972Cole K.S. Membranes, Ions and Impulses. University of California Press, Berkeley1972Google Scholar). However, the origin of the sudden change in membrane potential that occurs during an action potential was not well defined. It was the landmark paper of Cole and Curtis (Cole and Curtis, 1939Cole K.S. Curtis H.J. Electrical impedance of the squid axon during activity.J. Gen. Physiol. 1939; 22: 649-670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using impedance analysis of the squid axon membrane during the action potential that established that the transient large decrease in conductance (and not a change in capacitance) was the main event underlying the impulse. Yet, a picture of the events underlying the generation of the impulse remained elusive. The main problem was that the all-or-none nature of the impulse made it impossible to gradually control the voltage when elicited by current pulses. It took the development of a new technique, the ability to control the membrane potential (the voltage clamp), that initiated the revolution that has led to our understanding of membrane conductance changes (Cole, 1949Cole K.S. Dynamic electrical characteristics of the squid axon membrane.Arch. Sci. Physiol. (Paris). 1949; 3: 253-258Google Scholar). But, while illuminating some aspects of the initiation and propagation of the nerve impulse, the voltage clamp was not enough: a more complete understanding also required the sodium hypothesis (Hodgkin and Katz, 1949Hodgkin A.L. Katz B. The effect of sodium ions on the electrical activity of the giant axon of the squid.J. Physiol. 1949; 108: 37-77PubMed Google Scholar). The beauty and simplicity of voltage-dependent conductances in the Hodgkin and Huxley (HH) equations goes way beyond explaining the generation and propagation of the action potential. In fact, it would not be a stretch to say that the concept of the ion channel was established at that point. Hodgkin and Huxley, referring to the dipoles or charges responsible for the voltage dependence (that predicted the later-found gating currents) stated: “If such components exist it is necessary to suppose that their density is relatively low and that a number of sodium ions cross the membrane at a single active patch” (Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952Hodgkin A.L. Huxley A.F. A quantitative description of membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in nerve.J. Physiol. 1952; 117: 500-544PubMed Google Scholar). This statement implies that the ionic conductance is not pictured as a diffuse property of the membrane, but rather as the result of specific, discrete sites. For example, in their concept of the potassium conductance, there was a conduction term (¯gK) and a voltage-dependent gating process that can turn the conductance on or off (n4). This is precisely the concept accepted today, where we say ¯gK = Nγ, where N is the total number of channels and γ is the conductance of one channel, or site. It should be emphasized that the work of Hodgkin and Huxley also established the basic pulse protocols, such I-V curves, instantaneous I-V curves, and double and triple conditioning pulse protocols, that are the basis for most electrical recordings in use today. After the monumental work of Hodgkin and Huxley, many advances were made on the properties of the Na+ and K+ conductances still using the squid axon preparation under voltage clamp. The development of internal perfusion (Baker et al., 1961Baker P.F. Hodgkin A.L. Shaw T.I. Replacement of the protoplasm of a giant nerve fibre with artificial solutions.Nature. 1961; 190: 885-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, Oikawa et al., 1961Oikawa T. Spyropoulis C.S. Tasaki I. Teorell T. Methods for perfusing the giant axon of Loligo pealei.Acta. Physiol. Scand. 1961; 52: 195-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and dialysis (Brinley and Mullins, 1967Brinley F.J. Mullins L.J. Sodium extrusion by internally dialyzed squid axons.J. Gen. Physiol. 1967; 50: 2303-2331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) techniques that introduced tubing or semipermeable capillaries into the axon to exchange the internal medium allowed a detailed study of reversal potentials and conductances (Chandler and Meves, 1965Chandler W.K. Meves H. Voltage clamp experiments in internally perfused giant axons.J. Physiol. 1965; 180: 788-820PubMed Google Scholar). The introduction of the Vaseline gap to the voltage-clamp technique provided a way to measure the ionic currents in myelinated nerve where it was found that the conductances in the node followed rules similar to their counterparts in the squid axon (Dodge and Frankenhaeuser, 1958Dodge F.A. Frankenhaeuser B. Membrane currents in isolated frog nerve fibre under voltage clamp conditions.J. Physiol. 1958; 143: 76-90PubMed Google Scholar). But, most importantly, what followed Hodgkin and Huxley was the development of the channel concept as we understand it today. The identification of tetrodotoxin (TTX) (Narahashi et al., 1964Narahashi T. Moore J.W. Scott W.R. Tetrodotoxin blockage of sodium conductance increase in lobster giant axons.J. Gen. Physiol. 1964; 47: 965-974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a specific blocker of the Na+, and not K+, currents was an important confirmation that there were separate paths for Na+ and K+ in the membrane. The concept that the paths of conduction were through discrete pores was not new at that time and had been presented much earlier (see Hille, 2001Hille B. Ion channels of excitable membranes.Third Edition. Sinauer, Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). Mullins put forward the idea that the pore is a cage where ions lose, at least partially, their hydration shell to fit snugly, and could thus differentiate between Na+ and K+ (Mullins, 1959Mullins L.J. The penetration ofsome cations into muscle.J. Gen. Physiol. 1959; 42: 1013-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a concept that is not too far away from what we know today (see below). The subsequent discovery that tetraethylammonium ion (TEA) blocked K+ currents without changing the Na+ currents further confirmed the idea of separate pathways (Armstrong and Binstock, 1965Armstrong C.M. Binstock L. Anomaluos rectification in the squid giat axon injected with tetraethylammonium chloride.J. Gen. Physiol. 1965; 48: 859-872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Tasaki and Hagiwara, 1957Tasaki I. Hagiwara S. Demonstration of two stable potential states in the squid giant axon under tetraethylammonium chloride.J. Gen. Physiol. 1957; 40: 859-885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pioneering work by Clay Armstrong using TEA derivatives as blockers of the K+ conductance from the internal side of the squid axon gave us the first insights into the basic architecture of the channel. He found that by replacing one of the ethyl groups of the TEA molecule with a longer hydrocarbon chain, the block of the K+ current occurred after the channel opened, introducing the concept of a discrete gate. Then he went further in demonstrating that the blocker was displaced by an inward flow of K+ ions, giving us the first indication that the blocker and the ions occupied the same region in the channel (Armstrong, 1971Armstrong C.M. Interaction of tetraethylammonium derivatives with the potassium channels of squid giant axon.J. Gen. Physiol. 1971; 58: 413-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The blocker of the K+ conductance could also be a less permeable ion such as Na+ or Cs (Bezanilla and Armstrong, 1972Bezanilla F. Armstrong C.M. Negative conductance acused by the entry of sodium and cesium ions into the potassium channels of the squid axon.J. Gen. Physiol. 1972; 60: 588-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that could be dislodged of its blocking site when large electric fields were applied (French and Wells, 1977French R.J. Wells J.B. Sodium ions as blocking agents and charge carriers in the potassium channel of the squid giant axon.J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 70: 707-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TEA results were also obtained from the inside of the node of Ranvier (Armstrong and Hille, 1972Armstrong C.M. Hille B. The inner quaternary ammonium ion receptor in potassium channels of the node of Ranvier.J. Gen. Physiol. 1972; 59: 388-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and allowed the general proposal that K+ ions crossed the channel in single-file fashion, as was previously inferred by Hodgkin and Keynes, 1955Hodgkin A.L. Keynes R.D. The potassium permeability of a giant nerve fibre.J. Physiol. 1955; 128: 61-88PubMed Google Scholar, and implied that a gate controlling the ions' flow was located in the intracellular region of the channel. Therefore, in the early 70 s the concept of an ion conducting pore that had an intracellular gate and an extracellular region that selected the type of ions (selectivity filter) was definitely taking shape (Hille, 1975Hille B. Ion selectivity, saturation and block in sodium channels: A four barrier model.J. Gen. Physiol. 1975; 66: 535-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The type of molecules that formed the conductance pathway was a subject of intense debate because it was thought that ions could go either through the lipids or through specialized proteins embedded in the membrane. One of the first pieces of evidence that proteins were involved in this process was provided by the work of Rojas and Luxoro in Montemar, Chile, who showed the effects of proteases on excitability of the squid giant axon (Rojas and Luxoro, 1963Rojas E. Luxoro M. Micro-Injection Of Trypsin Into Axons Of Squid.Nature. 1963; 199: 78-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This work was followed by the study of the effect of other proteases on the ionic currents under voltage clamp. Pronase is a protease that was found to selectively destroy Na+ inactivation, leaving the potassium conductance unaltered, and this result prompted the hypothesis that pronase was clipping part of the protein that normally moved into the mouth of Na+ channel pores and thereby blocking the current (Armstrong et al., 1973Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F. Rojas E. Destruction of sodium conductance inactivation in squid axons perfused with pronase.J. Gen. Physiol. 1973; 62: 375-391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This finding is the origin of the “ball and chain” hypothesis of inactivation that is still discussed today. It took another biological preparation and advances in biochemical techniques to finally show that the Na+ channel was a protein. The electric eel contains specialized cells (electrocytes) with a large density of sodium channels that are stacked in such a way that when they fire an action potential, the voltage can go as high as 600 Volts along the whole animal. This arrangement makes the eel a swimming killing battery that can easily stun and capture its prey, and it also makes it the richest natural source of Na+ channels. Taking advantage of the eel and the high affinity of the Na+ channel to TTX, Agnew and colleagues were able to extract and purify a 230 kDa protein (Agnew et al., 1978Agnew W.S. Levinson S.R. Brabson J.S. Raftery M.A. Purification of the tetrodotoxin-binding component associated with the voltage-sensitive sodium channel from Electrophorus electricus electroplax membranes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1978; 75: 2606-2610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrating the protein nature of the Na+ channel, which was later found to transport Na+ in liposomes and, even later, demonstrated to induce Na+ channel currents in liposomes and bilayers (Correa et al., 1990Correa A.M. Bezanilla F. Agnew W.S. Voltage activation of purified eel sodium channels reconstituted into artificial liposomes.Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6230-6240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Rosenberg et al., 1984Rosenberg R.L. Tomiko S.A. Agnew W.S. Single-channel properties of the reconstituted voltage-regulated Na channel isolated from the electroplax of Electrophorus electricus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1984; 81: 5594-5598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The voltage dependence of Na+ and K+ conductances requires that the channels have a sensor, such as a charge or a dipole that responds to voltage changes (Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952Hodgkin A.L. Huxley A.F. A quantitative description of membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in nerve.J. Physiol. 1952; 117: 500-544PubMed Google Scholar). The movement of these putative charged components is expected to produce a transient current that is about 100 to 200 times smaller than the ionic currents, making their detection difficult. Toward the end of the summer of 1972, while we scribbled possible diagrams on the sand in Woods Hole with Clay Armstrong, we came up with a simple system that allowed the subtraction of the large linear component of the capacitive current to extract the nonlinear gating current. We also had to minimize the ionic currents using nonpermeant ions and TTX as a blocker to successfully measure the gating current of the Na+ channel in the squid axon (Armstrong and Bezanilla, 1973Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F. Currents related to movement of the gating particles of the sodium channels.Nature. 1973; 242: 459-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Keynes and Rojas, 1974Keynes R.D. Rojas E. Kinetics and steady-state properties of the charged system controlling sodium conductance in the squid giant axon.J. Physiol. 1974; 239: 393-434PubMed Google Scholar). The detailed analysis of the gating currents revealed that the charge movement correlated with the opening and closing of the Na+ channel (its activation process) but that the inactivation process did not have its own voltage sensor. Rather, it was an almost voltage-independent event that affected the voltage dependence and kinetics of the activation charge. It is after these findings that the ball and chain hypothesis of inactivation was put forward. An important implication of this work was the idea that channel inactivation inherited most of its voltage dependence from the intrinsically voltage-dependent activation process (Armstrong and Bezanilla, 1977Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F. Inactivation of the sodium channel. II. Gating current experiments.J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 70: 567-590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a concept that had been put forward before by Goldman and Schauf, 1972Goldman L. Schauf C.L. Inactivation of the sodium current in Myxicola giant axons. Evidence for coupling to the activation process.J. Gen. Physiol. 1972; 59: 659-675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and that departed from the HH hypothesis of independent activation and inactivation processes. However, if channels were discrete units of conduction, it should be possible to measure the (albeit minute) current through a single pore. The idea of measuring the unitary currents, also called the single-channel currents, was mentioned by biophysicists in the 1960s. The first breakthrough occurred when Bean et al., 1969Bean R.C. Shepherd W.C. Chan H. Eichner J. Discrete conductance fluctuations in lipid bilayer protein membranes.J. Gen. Physiol. 1969; 53: 741-757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar recorded discrete miniature current jumps in artificial lipid bilayers doped with a contaminant called the excitability inducing material (EIM) (Mueller et al., 1962Mueller P. Rudin D.O. Tien H.T. Wescott W.C. Reconstitution of cell membrane structure in vitro and its transformation into an excitable system.Nature. 1962; 194: 979-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). These single-channel currents were analyzed in detail by Ehrenstein and coworkers (Ehrenstein et al., 1970Ehrenstein G. Lecar H. Nossal R. The nature of the negative resistance in bimolecular lipid membranes containing excitability-inducing material.J. Gen. Physiol. 1970; 55: 119-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Ehrenstein et al., 1974Ehrenstein G. Blumenthal R. Latorre R. Lecar H. Kinetics of the opening and closing of individual excitability-inducing material channels in a lipid bilayer.J. Gen. Physiol. 1974; 63: 707-721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and constituted the first correlations done between stochastic single-channel fluctuations and macroscopic currents. Although EIM currents were not the classical Na+ or K+ channels, they stimulated research into achieving the same with classical channels. The first success in this direction was the detection of excess noise produced by an ensemble of channels due to the stochastic nature of the single-molecule gating (Fishman, 1973Fishman H.M. Relaxation spectra of potassium channel noise from squid axon membranes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1973; 70: 876-879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Katz and Miledi, 1970Katz B. Miledi R. Membrane noise produced by acetylcholine.Nature. 1970; 226: 962-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, Wanke et al., 1974Wanke E. DeFelice L.J. Conti F. Voltage noise, current noise and impedance in space clamped squid giant axon.Pflugers Arch. 1974; 347: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), but the recording of the single-channel currents had to wait for the development of a technique that isolated a small patch of membrane with minimal leak: the patch clamp. The first single-channel recordings of Ach receptor channels were done by Neher and Sakmann, 1976Neher E. Sakmann B. Single-channel currents recorded from membrane of denervated frog muscle fibres.Nature. 1976; 260: 799-802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar using small pipettes pressed against denervated, enzymatically treated muscle fibers from the frog. This landmark achievement was a final confirmation of the discrete nature of channels. After these recordings, it was remarkable that these authors immediately recognized that, upon application of negative pressure to a clean pipette attached to the cell, the decrease in the background noise meant they must have obtained a seal between the pipette and the membrane that exceeded a gigaohm: in that precise instant the patch-clamp technique was invented (Hamill et al., 1981Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Improved patch-clamp techniques for high-resolution current recording from cells and cell-free membrane patches.Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (8967) Google Scholar). It is not possible to summarize here the tremendous impact the patch-clamp technique has had or will have in the future, but it is undeniable that it radically changed the scope and the way we do electrophysiology. The patch-clamp technique was not only useful for recording single channels, but it also allowed voltage clamping of the whole cell, and thus gave us the ability to record macroscopic currents with much higher accuracy than found when using microelectrodes. Most importantly, this technique opened up the use of the voltage-clamp technique to essentially any cell that has its membrane available to be touched by the patch pipette to obtain a gigaohm seal, thus finishing the hegemony of the squid axon and other large, cylindrical cells types in electrophysiology. Initially, the patch clamp was used in a few tissue culture cell lines that presented an easy surface to achieve the gigaseals. But it did not take long before the technique was used in many other cell lines and also in cells dissociated from tissues. This extended the voltage-clamp technique to tissues to which we had no access before, and new conductances were found that had different selectivity, permeability, and voltage dependencies. The simplicity of the squid axon, which essentially has a Na+ conductance, a K+ conductance, a minor Ca2+ conductance, and a poorly defined leak conductance, was rarely found in other cells such as neurons or cardiac myocites. These cells showed a myriad of different types of conductances that were found to play roles in frequency generation, fast repolarization, and plateau generation. The patch-clamp technique was also used to directly record from almost intact tissue (Edwards et al., 1989Edwards F.A. Konnerth A. Sakmann B. Takahashi T. A thin slice preparation for patch clamp recordings from neurones of the mammalian central nervous system.Pflugers Arch. 1989; 414: 600-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), opening a new era that allowed voltage clamping of neurons in situ to study synaptic transmission and connections in brain slices. The dream of describing the elementary properties of neurons in situ was finally a reality. Measuring single-channel events gave us, for the first time, the actual value of the conductance of a single pore. It was found that the single-channel conductance varied widely among different types of channels, and it was also found that there were several types of channels that, although showing the same selectivity, had different single-channel conductances. These results also stimulated the development of theories of permeation based on the idea that ions had to overcome energy barriers separated by energy wells, or binding sites, within the pore (see Hille, 2001Hille B. Ion channels of excitable membranes.Third Edition. Sinauer, Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). At the time, these theories were phenomenological in the sense that they required the construction of mathematical models of permeation to describe the observed reality without knowledge about the chemical groups that were actually lining the pore or the 3D structure of the pore itself. Proof of such theories would await future technological advances. The single-channel recording also made important advances in our understanding of channel gating because it was now possible to develop stochastic models of gating that showed the individual opening and closing of the channel. These were kinetic models that still had no molecular basis. It became clear, however, that single-channel recordings have very high sensitivity to events that are kinetically near to the open state, but they are pretty insensitive to deeper closed states. On the other hand, the gating currents were quite sensitive to any transition that has some charge movement. Thus, the ideal combination would be to measure single channels, macroscopic currents, and gating currents in the same preparation. This was difficult to achieve in the cells normally used to record single-channels because, as they have limited channel densities, gating currents had too low signal-to-noise ratio. The squid axon still offered the best recordings of gating currents, but no single-channel recordings were possible because they are surrounded by connective tissue and a Schwann cell layer. This changed when Conti and Neher were able to use a bent pipette inside of the axon to record the first single potassium channel currents from the squid axon (Conti and Neher, 1980Conti F. Neher E. Single channel recordings of K+ currents in squid axons.Nature. 1980; 285: 140-143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The development of the cut-open axon technique allowed the routine recording of potassium channel from the axon (Llano et al., 1988Llano I. Webb C.K. Bezanilla F. Potassium conductance of the squid giant axon. Single-channel studies.J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 179-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) where it was found that even the squid axon contains several types of K+ channels. When the technique was extended to record single Na+ channels (Bezanilla, 1987Bezanilla F. Single sodium channels from the squid giant axon.Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 1087-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was finally possible to record the three main electrical manifestations of channel operation in the same preparation. Thus, using gating currents, macroscopic currents, and single-channel recordings in the squid giant axon, a much more constrained full kinetic model of the Na+ channel was developed (Correa and Bezanilla, 1994Correa A.M.

Recently, we showed that AID is implicated in the pathogenesis of human cancers including hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we established a new AID transgenic mouse model (TNAP-AID) in which AID is expressed in cells producing tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), which is a marker of primordial germ cells and immature stem cells, including ES cells. High expression of TNAP was found in the liver of the embryos and adults of TNAP-AID mice. HCC developed in 27% of these mice at the age of approximately 90 weeks. The HCC that developed in TNAP-AID mice expressed α-fetoprotein and had deleterious mutations in the tumour suppressor gene Trp53, some of which corresponded to those found in human cancer. In conclusion, TNAP-AID is a mouse model that spontaneously develops HCC, sharing genetic and phenotypic features with human HCC, which develops in the inflamed liver as a result of the accumulation of genetic changes."

A group of neuroscientists, lawyers, philosophers, and jurists are examining issues in criminal law and, in particular, problems in responsibility and prediction and problems in legal decision making. Some of the implications for law of recent discoveries in neuroscience are considered in a new program established by the MacArthur Foundation. A group of neuroscientists, lawyers, philosophers, and jurists are examining issues in criminal law and, in particular, problems in responsibility and prediction and problems in legal decision making. Neuroscience started off over 100 years ago with curious scientists studying a most complex organ—the brain. The overarching interest was and continues to be to determine how the brain does its work. That is, scientists ask how the brain causes human beings to perceive, think, behave, reproduce, eat, drink, and all the rest. Enormous advances have been made toward this goal, and today, the excitement in the field is palpable. About 20 years ago, another advance expanded the agenda. With the advent of brain-imaging tools of all kinds—from CT, to fMRI, MEG, ERPs, NIRS, and more—the human brain itself could be studied. No longer did one have to infer from animal studies what a particular finding might mean for the human condition. Humans were now front and center and directly under the scientist's eye. And in recent years, even those slippery mental constructs, such as moral beliefs, intentions, preferences, self-knowledge, and consciousness itself, are being unpacked. Other fields interested in the study of mind couldn't help but notice the advances in neuroscience. Basic neuroscientific research was at this time unlocking how and when the brain seemed to be making a person's decisions for action. Such decisions, neuroscientists discovered, are usually made well before an animal, including a human being, is consciously aware of the decision. And the pharmacologists were beginning to see how the human condition itself could be enhanced, modulated, brightened, calmed, and subjected to other modifications. With all of this and much, much more, it became clear that the traditional views of what it meant to be human were under challenge. Were some or all of the implications good? In this context, the field of neuroethics was born. Neuroethics is undoubtedly a subfield of the more general study of bioethics, but neuroethics has a greater immediacy. The core of the discussions in neuroethics does not deal, for example, with who receives a liver in a transplant case. Neuroethics instead deals with how we are to think of ourselves (Chaterjee, 2004Chaterjee A. Neurology. 2004; 63: 968-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The questions are endless, and the field is currently abuzz with activity. None of this was lost on those who believed that the ever-advancing field of neuroscience was beginning to challenge our notions of crime and punishment, the very foundations of the rules regulating our living together in social groups. Were the scientists, it was asked, who were engaged in this field advancing the age-old argument that our actions are wholly determined by physical forces? Were they raising fundamental questions about the nature of what it means to be responsible for one's actions? Some legal scholars hold that determinism undermines legal responsibility and that the law cannot ignore the threat of determinism. Other scholars directly assert that human beings are not responsible for any of our actions (Dan-Cohen, 1992Dan-Cohen M. Harv. L. Rev. 1992; 105: 959-960Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar; but see Pereboom, 2001Pereboom D. Living without Free Will. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, MA2001Crossref Google Scholar, contra). As Sanford Kadish puts it, “to blame a person is to express moral criticism, and if the person's action does not deserve criticism, blaming him is a kind of falsehood, and is, to the extent the person is injured by being blamed, unjust to him.” These are large and bothersome issues. Of course, they are not new or novel. What is new is that neuroscience may have something to say about them. As we move toward a closer understanding of how the brain enables action (everything from a simple movement to a thought) we seem to be closing in on the idea that human beings are a determined system. That is, indeed, what many people have come to believe, and that is the crux of the problem confronted by the emerging field of law and neuroscience. To study these problems, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation funded the establishment of the Law and Neuroscience Project in 2007. This project, composed of approximately 40 neuroscientists, legal specialists, and philosophers, has embarked on a 3 year endeavor to engage in pilot research to expand our knowledge in two major areas in this field. The first area addresses the question of criminal responsibility, prediction of criminal behavior, and treatment options. It includes issues concerning psychopathy and drug addiction and how these issues affect our understandings of responsibility and punishment. The second area is focused on the use of neuroscience in legal decision making. Despite or because of the path described above, several cautionary notes must be provided. The first such note is that one must be on guard against “brain overclaim syndrome,” a condition identified by Stephen Morse (Morse, 2006Morse, S. (2006). Brain overclaim syndrome and criminal responsibility: a diagnostic note. University of Pennsylvania Law School, Public Law Working Paper No. 06-35. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=896753.Google Scholar). We have all seen this syndrome in action. To some extent, it is a simple truism that the brain is involved with all things that comprise our human existence. It follows, loosely, therefore, that understanding the brain will help us understand the human condition more fully. However, scientists are well aware that findings may have social or psychological implications but remain far from being dispositive on larger social questions. It is a paradox that it is a duty of scientists to present research findings to the public while, at the same time, the public over-accepts the importance of such findings and even prematurely grants the status of sheer truth to some! Recent studies have shown, for example, that the results of a simple experiment in cognitive psychology will be more positively evaluated and considered important if a brain scan or two is thrown into the reporting of those results (Weisberg et al., 2008Weisberg D.S. Keil F.C. Goodstein J. Rawson E. Gray J.R. J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2008; 20: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). In a court of law, the undisciplined use of brain scans is a real concern. The balance between accurate scientific reporting, on the one hand, and the risk of “overclaim syndrome” on the other must be carefully considered. Additionally, over-acceptance on the part of the jury has to be carefully evaluated at all times. Using neuroscience in the courtroom, colored and influenced by modern societies' awe of science, may also strengthen the judge's and jury's deterministic tendencies. These enigmatic knots, now manifest to us, need to be untangled, and new efforts in law and neuroscience might help us to better do this. In what follows, I will briefly review two main areas of interest that correspond to the research areas in the MacArthur Law and Neuroscience Project. I should add that our research networks considered dozens of other possible projects that could yield rich and meaningful information concerning this skein of questions. In later years, we hope to address many of these issues. For now, as mentioned above, we chose to concentrate on two areas: (1) criminal responsibility and (2) legal decision making in the courtroom. While each of these is a large and complex topic, the specific problems we will preliminarily address are more focused subtopics located within each of these broader areas. The most salient characteristic that distinguishes United States criminal law from civil law is the outcome for the defendant. In criminal law, we call that outcome (a sentence) “punishment.” In the civil law, the goal is to compensate or make whole the injured party. Punishment, the object of the criminal law, implies the imposition of some form of suffering. At the same time, it is widely believed, that “no human should be made to suffer if such suffering cannot be justified by a concomitant gain to society.” (Loewy, 2003Loewy A.H. Criminal Law in a Nutshell.4th Edition. Thomson, Washington, DC2003Google Scholar; Of course, this view, endorsed in some form by most utilitarians, can be traced back to Jeremy Bentham.) We tend to forget that it is society through the power of the state that metes out a punishment and not the victim of the crime. Criminal conduct is seen as an offense against society, against our norms; it is seen as an offense against all of us. Punishment here collides with the thinking of the neuroscientifically enlightened. While punishment allegedly has many purposes—such as rehabilitation, deterrence, restraint, and retribution—retribution appears to be preponderant, even if it is not so perceived (Carlsmith, 2008Carlsmith K. Soc. Justice Res. 2008; 21: 119-137Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). If determinism is correct, retributive punishment is not only nonsensical, it is immoral. The first order of business in law and neuroscience, then, is to examine determinism and investigate how decisions to act (to produce behaviors) come about. We face the question of whether we blame the antecedent forces working on the brain or whether we blame the person. Neuroscience is making inroads into understanding how the circuits and logic of neurons carry out behaviors. We understand more about certain thoughts and behaviors than others. One thing we are certain of is that the “work” in the brain happens before we are consciously aware of our mental struggles. Researchers have, since as early as 1965, advanced our understanding of the fact that much of the work is done at the subconscious level (Kornhuber and Deecke, 1965Kornhuber H.H. Deecke L. Pflugers Arch. 1965; 284: 1-17Crossref Scopus (1145) Google Scholar, Libet et al., 1979Libet B. Wright E.W. Feinstein B. Pearl D. Brain. 1979; 102: 193-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, Soon et al., 2008Soon C.S. Brass M. Heinze H. Haynes J. Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 543-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). A decision, for example, can be predicted several seconds before the subject consciously decides. If it is simply the brain, working up from its unconscious neural elements, that causes a person to act (even before he or she is aware of making a decision), how can we hold any person liable for his or her mental decisions? To hold someone responsible for his or her actions, one must find a “there” there. Is a little guy pulling the levers in your head producing a free-floating you? Modern neuroscience, of course, tells us the answer is “no.” The brain is a highly parallel and distributed system with literally millions of decisions being made simultaneously. The parallel-processing organism—a human being—appears to other human beings remarkably like a self-motivated, morally coherent, conscious, decision-making agent. This assignment of agency by human beings to complex systems is not limited to other human beings. Every day, we speak of the stock market, a corporation, or even a nation in such personal terms. This discussion is not, surprisingly, crucial to determining where we locate “responsibility.” Responsibility reflects a rule, a rule that emerges out of one or more agents interacting in a social context. Responsibility is not in the brain; it is in the social contract. Responsibility reflects the hope we share that each person will follow certain rules. Of course, the foregoing is an argument, not, by any means, a settled view. If the foregoing view were adopted, substantial implications for the law would follow. After all, almost anyone—diminished through disease, genetics, and social-cultural forces—can follow a rule. Schizophrenics and felons stop at red lights. Over the years, the system of United States law, which is derived from English common law, has developed and reified conceptions of what it means to be guilty of a crime. The complex set of ideas that has emerged was largely established during times when few worried about notions of determined brains or social rules. The view of humans, embodied in the law, was simple and straightforward. The human, according to this view, is a practical reasoner functioning in a normal environment. In order to be guilty of a crime, a person must be in a certain mental state, called the mens rea (guilty mind), necessary to have committed a crime and have accomplished the criminal act, called the actus reus. From a neuroscientific point of view, the criminal act or actus reus component of the crime is of less interest than the mens rea concept. The mental state of having a “guilty mind” (largely at the time of the commission of the crime) carries within it the notion that humans have “general intentions” and “specific intentions.” Different crimes require different levels of intent for a conviction. Put simply, current law envisions a criminal defendant as a free-willing, rational creature operating in a normal brain environment with the mental intent (either general or specific) to accomplish a crime. But is this an accurate description of the criminal? Adding to the intense interest in this subject are new studies suggesting that specific brain areas are activated that are associated with intentions to act (Haynes et al., 2007Haynes J.-D. Sakai K. Rees G. Gilbert S. Frith C. Passingham R.E. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 323-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). If those brain areas are damaged or nonfunctional, does that suggest the person should be held exculpable for a criminal act? In addition, new studies suggest that specific brain circuits are involved in certain moral judgments (Greene et al., 2004Greene J. Nystrom L. Engell J. Darley J. Cohen J. Neuron. 2004; 44: 389-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). If these circuits are impaired, should such a person be excused under several insanity doctrines as incapable of knowing right from wrong? Other studies show that a sense of fairness can be disrupted by momentarily disabling the right frontal cortex. For example, recent experiments using what is called “the ultimatum game” suggest that disruption of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) by low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation greatly lowers a test subject's ability to reject an intentionally unfair offer (Knoch, 2006Knoch D. Science. 2006; 314: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Interestingly, subjects still knew the offers were unfair—they simply couldn't resist taking them. Such research leads to the question of whether felons who have damage in such regions should be excused for their opportunistic behavior. Finally, should psychopaths, a group that makes up about 20% of our high-security male prison population, be considered as suffering from a brain disorder that prevents them from forming an empathetic response and understanding (even comprehending) the feelings of others? If so, do we want to excuse them under insanity or diminished capacity doctrines and thereby judge them as exculpable and let them go? Do we want the state to house them in a different kind of facility? The issues seem endless. We are at a major crossroads. Of course, that is not the main objective of the work examining special populations such as psychopaths and addicts. The goal is to understand their abnormal states and attempt to design therapies and other interventions that might lead them to so-called normal status. In a recent electrophysiological study of at-risk children, subjects who came from low socioeconomic environments were found to have a pattern of brain activity similar to adult patients with frontal lobe damage (Kishiyama et al., 2008Kishiyama M.M. Boyce W.T. Jimenez A.M. Perry L.M. Knight R.T. J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2008; (in press. Published online August 27, 2008)https://doi.org/10.1162/jocn.2009.21101Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Could it be, then, that key social and developmental factors lead to brain abnormalities that then result in a higher risk of criminal activity? Could interventions be developed to stop such a progression? Untangling all of these interactive complexities is a major charge of the MacArthur Law and Neuroscience Project. How are we to view our very nature? Neuroscientists might, on the one hand, aimlessly continue to engage in research and publish results. They might, on the other hand, be cognizant of the fact that neuroscience itself is located at the center of complex and crucial societal issues. As the philosopher Gary Watson recently reminded us, “we are the law.” Our view of what it means to be human is changing, and our view of justice will likely change in conformity with it. A second major area of research in law and neuroscience, balanced against the long-tem theoretical interests described so far, concerns legal decision making as it currently operates in courtrooms. The first area we have identified—the question of criminal responsibility itself—exists against the backdrop of whether or not and how such research should be allowed in the courtroom. That backdrop defines the second area of our research. Perhaps of most immediate and practical concern here is the admission into evidence or use of new brain-imaging technologies and the reports they generate. Should information on the specific physical states and capacities of individuals be evaluated by the judge or by the jury? Further—and this is the key issue—is such information probative or prejudicial? Can a brain scan presented in a legal proceeding be over-accepted by a jury (Sinnott-Armstrong et al., 2008Sinnott-Armstrong W. Roskies A. Murphy E. Brown T. Episteme. 2008; (in press)Google Scholar)? While the public considers science as a field dealing with certainties, scientific observations actually reflect probabilities of occurrence. The proper representation of scientific finding is difficult. In a sense, the nature of science has been misinterpreted for years. How does scientific evidence get into court? Strict criteria regulate the introduction of scientific evidence, but these have changed fairly often as science has evolved. The history of the introduction and evaluation of scientific evidence by United States courts is fascinating and complex (Rakoff, 2008Rakoff J. Science and the Law: Uncomfortable Bedfellows. Timbers Lecture, Dartmouth College, 2008Google Scholar). Federal Judge Jed Rakoff, of the Southern District of New York, recently provided a brilliant analysis of the ever-changing rules concerning the admissibility of scientific evidence. Over the years, the desire of legal counsel on any side to introduce science in court has grown exponentially. Unfortunately, much of it has been “junk” science. For example, Rakoff describes the history of the rejection of lie-detection procedures in United States courts. This rejection seems justified. A recent report from the National Academy of Sciences deemed lie detection unscientific and unreliable (National Academy of Science, 2003National Academy of Science (2003). The Polygraph and Lie Detection. National Research Council: Committee to Review the Scientific Evidence on the Polygraph, Board on Behavioral, Cognitive, and Sensory Sciences, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, and Committee on National Statistic (Washington, DC: The National Academies Press).Google Scholar). Even though every jurisdiction except one in the United States prohibits the introduction of lie-detection evidence, it is still extensively used in the government, military, and private enterprise. The risk that science rejected for use in courts, due to the stringent requirements for accuracy, may still be used widely in society for other purposes is always present. Ensuring that only sound science is used in the courtroom and that such science is used in appropriate ways is a work in progress. At one time, for example, Rakoff reminds us that American courts accepted that psychiatric evidence based on psychoanalytic theory had reached the level of scientific certainty sufficient to allow its introduction into evidence. The way that judges and juries hear scientific evidence is through the admission of expert testimony, often accompanied by the expert's exhibits (charts, diagrams, medical images, and the like). In American courts, the judge has become the “gatekeeper” and allows “good” scientific evidence into the case while preventing “bad” scientific evidence (as well as irrelevant evidence) from entering the case. How should a judge, trained in the law, make such a determination? The evolution of the insanity defense in the United States shows the development of the process by which a judge decides whether to admit scientific evidence and exemplifies some of the problems related to the intersection of science and law. Following an assassination attempt against the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Robert Peel, Sir Nicolas Conyngham Tindal, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, established what has become known as the M'Naghten Rule. The jury, under this rule, must consider whether the defendant was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act or that the act was wrong. This definition has gone through several major reinterpretations in various jurisdictions in the United States. You can imagine the avalanche of expert testimony a judge or jury is likely to hear concerning whether a certain defendant is “sane” or “insane.” The current standards for the admissibility of expert testimony in all types of situations come from Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. According to Daubert, federal judges must screen proposed expert testimony and allow in only that evidence that is relevant and consists of valid scientific information. This “screening” procedure is driven by Federal Rule of Evidence 702. Federal judges (and many state judges applying similar standards) use several criteria to analyze whether expert testimony is, as Judge Rakoff noted, “grounded in the methods and procedures of science.” The criteria that govern the admissibility of expert testimony shape the presentation of scientific information. Communicating the subtleties of scientific findings in the context of a courtroom adversarial proceeding (constrained by the rules of admissibility, discussed above) is indeed daunting. A long and winding road is unfolding before us. Every day, neuroscience is making advances in understanding the human mind. There are many questions that will be fruitful subjects of research, and many others may be beyond the initial scope of the MacArthur Law and Neuroscience Project. For example, one of the law's principal aims is to regulate behavior by appealing to and relying on intuitive notions of right and wrong and notions of justice. These intuitive notions are, of course, based on a model of the person embedded in legal thinking. Questions about the nature of the person, the bases of moral reasoning, and the effects of punishment have the potential to significantly reshape legal philosophy. Apart from suggesting what might be seen as earth-shattering adjustments to the legal system, there are numerous questions, as discussed above, on how, within the current framework of the law, to balance the introduction and use of neuroscientific evidence against its potential for “unduly” prejudicing a party. Such evidence is, of course, informative, but we must work to further understand whether jurors, judges, and lawmakers suffer from “brain overclaim” syndrome and how to counter it. Further, the neurological basis of bias, its role in the law in terms of procedural and substantive fairness, and possible means to counteract bias must be studied. We in the United States are not alone in this enterprise. Other national and transnational efforts are trying to address these questions in light of differing legal systems. For example, the European Science Foundation (ESF) funded a European Neuroscience and Society Network (ENSN) in late 2007. The London School of Economics is also sponsoring Brain, Self, and Society, a 3 year project funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) of the United Kingdom. Further, the Oxford Centre for Neuroethics, funded through the Wellcome Trust's Biomedical Ethics Strategic Awards program, recently received funding for a 5 year project on neuroethical research. It is the human mind that can work in strange ways, ways that produce antisocial behavior such as embezzlement, fraud, theft, assault, rape, and murder, to name only a few crimes with which society is rightly concerned. Neuroscience, like it or not, is enmeshed with the core issues of criminal law. From the fundamental and enduring question of criminal responsibility to the immediate issues of representing science in today's courtroom, the publicly spirited neuroscientist must consider these issues and help guide our society to the proper use of its accurate and growing base of scientific knowledge.

https://openalex.org/W2026804257,"The breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) is mutated in approximately 50% of hereditary breast cancers, and its expression is decreased in 30–40% of sporadic breast cancers, suggesting a general role in breast cancer development. BRCA1 physically and functionally interacts with estrogen receptor-α (ERα) and several transcriptional regulators. We investigated the relationship between cellular BRCA1 levels and tamoxifen sensitivity. Decreasing BRCA1 expression in breast cancer cells by small interfering RNA alleviated tamoxifen-mediated growth inhibition and abolished tamoxifen suppression of several endogenous ER-targeted genes. ER-stimulated transcription and cytoplasmic signaling was increased without detectable changes in ER or ER coregulator expression. Co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that with BRCA1 knockdown, tamoxifen-bound ERα was inappropriately associated with coactivators, and not effectively with corepressors. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that with tamoxifen, BRCA1 knockdown did not change ERα promoter occupancy, but resulted in increased coactivator and decreased corepressor recruitment onto the endogenous cyclin D1 promoter. Our results suggest that decreased BRCA1 levels modify ERα-mediated transcription and regulation of cell proliferation in part by altering ERα–coregulator association. In the presence of tamoxifen, decreased BRCA1 expression results in increased coactivator and decreased corepressor recruitment on ER-regulated gene promoters."

We found that disruption of microtubules by nocodazole or vinblastine treatment, as well as microtubule stabilization by taxol, inhibited host cell invasion by UPEC, as did silencing of HDAC6 expression or pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 activity. Invasion did not require two alternate HDAC6 substrates, Hsp90 and cortactin, but was dependent upon the kinesin-1 light chain KLC2 and an upstream activator of HDAC6, aurora A kinase.

The invasion process requires either direct or indirect manipulation of host cytoskeletal dynamics by the incoming pathogens (1Rottner K. Stradal T.E. Wehland J. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 3-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Some bacteria, like the enteric pathogens Salmonella enterica and Shigella flexneri, inject effector molecules into target host cells in order to directly modulate actin polymerization and dynamics. The resultant cytoskeletal rearrangements trigger intense ruffling of the host plasma membrane and subsequent internalization of adherent bacteria. Alternately, invasive bacteria like Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis express so-called invasin proteins that bind host cell receptors such as integrins, promoting receptor clustering and stimulating localized actin rearrangements. This results in the formation of host plasma membrane extensions that zipper around and engulf the bound bacteria. Invasion of host cells via a zipper-like mechanism requires that the pathogen tap into host signaling networks that are normally activated during host cell adhesion, polarization, or migration. Among bacteria that enter host cells by a zipper-like mechanism are strains of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) 2The abbreviations used are: UPEC, uropathogenic E. coli; ATA, aurintricarboxylic acid; AurA, aurora A kinase; AKI II, Aurora Kinase Inhibitor II; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; HDAC, histone deacetylase; NA, nicotinamide; NaB, sodium butyrate; PI, phosphoinositide; TDAC, tubacin deacetylase; TSA, trichostatin A; UTI, urinary tract infection; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.2The abbreviations used are: UPEC, uropathogenic E. coli; ATA, aurintricarboxylic acid; AurA, aurora A kinase; AKI II, Aurora Kinase Inhibitor II; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; HDAC, histone deacetylase; NA, nicotinamide; NaB, sodium butyrate; PI, phosphoinositide; TDAC, tubacin deacetylase; TSA, trichostatin A; UTI, urinary tract infection; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.

These microbes are the major cause of urinary tract infections (UTIs), accounting for greater than 80% of cases worldwide (5Foxman B. Am. J.

However, more recent work has demonstrated that UPEC can invade the epithelial cells that line the lumenal surfaces of the urinary tract (7Bower J.M. Eto D.S. Mulvey M.A. Traffic. 2005; 6: 18-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In mouse UTI models, intracellular UPEC have a notable survival advantage over their extracellular counterparts, and are able to persevere within the urinary tract for extended periods in the face of robust innate host defenses and even antibiotic treatments (3Mulvey M.A. Lopez-Boado Y.S.

It has been speculated that these intracellular reservoirs of UPEC can act as a source for the recurrent and chronic UTIs that afflict many individuals throughout their lives (3Mulvey M.A. Lopez-Boado Y.S.

To gain entry into uroepithelial cells, UPEC utilize peritrichously expressed filamentous adhesive organelles known as type 1 pili (2Martinez J.J. Mulvey M.A. Schilling J.D. Pinkner J.S. Hultgren S.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2803-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). These are composite fibers made up of a 7-nm thick rod comprised of repeating FimA subunits with a distally attached 3-nm-wide tip fibrillum structure consisting of two adaptor molecules, FimF and FimG, and the adhesin FimH (15Russell P.W. Orndorff P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5923-5935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Jones C.H. Pinkner J.S. Roth R. Heuser J. Nicholes A.V. Abraham S.N. Hultgren S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2081-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The FimH adhesin binds mannose-containing glycoprotein receptors and is sufficient to stimulate bacterial uptake by bladder epithelial cells (2Martinez J.J. Mulvey M.A. Schilling J.D. Pinkner J.S. Hultgren S.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2803-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Interactions between FimH and host receptors like α3β1 integrin activate a signaling cascade involving focal adhesion, Src, and phosphoinositide 3-kinases, as well as Rho-family GTPases and the actin bundling and adaptor proteins α-actinin and vinculin (2Martinez J.J.

The coordinated activation of these host factors drives localized rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton, leading to the envelopment and internalization of bound UPEC. This is a cholesterol-dependent process that also requires clathrin, the canonical clathrin adaptor AP-2, and at least three alternate endocytic adaptors, Numb, ARH, and Dab2 (19Eto D.S. Gordon H.B. Dhakal B.K. Jones T.A. Mulvey M.A. Cell Microbiol. 2008; 10: 2553-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A growing number of studies have shown that the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton can be modulated by microtubules (20Basu R. Chang F. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2007; 19: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 21Rodriguez O.C. Schaefer A.W. Mandato C.A. Forscher P. Bement W.M. Waterman-Storer C.M. Nat.

For example, microtubule depolymerization can stimulate the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, as observed at sites of integrin attachment to the extracellular matrix (23Danowski B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 93: 255-266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Liu B.P. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 5: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), while the polymerization of microtubules toward focal adhesions correlates with focal adhesion disassembly (25Kaverina I. Krylyshkina O. Small J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1033-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). This latter process is proposed to involve the delivery of so-called “relaxing” factor(s) to focal adhesions via microtubule-associated kinesin motor proteins (25Kaverina I. Krylyshkina O. Small J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1033-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 26Palazzo A.F. Gundersen G.G. Sci STKE. 2002; 2002: PE31PubMed Google Scholar). The potential for cross-talk between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletal networks led us to ask if microtubules affect the integrin-mediated actin-dependent entry of type 1-piliated UPEC into host bladder epithelial cells. Our results indicate that microtubules, along with the microtubule-associated enzyme histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), the HDAC6 activator Aurora A kinase, and the kinesin-1 motor protein complex, have crucial regulatory roles during the invasion process. Bacteria, Cell Culture, and Drugs—The UPEC cystitis isolate UTI89 was grown in static Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (Difco) at 37 °C for 48 h to induce type 1 pili expression prior to use in infection assays (9Mulvey M.A. Schilling J.D.

S. flexneri (ATCC 12022) and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (SL1344), kindly provided by Dr. O. Steele-Mortimer (Rocky Mountain Labs), were grown shaking in LB broth to mid-log as previously described (28Knodler L.A. Finlay B.B. Steele-Mortimer O. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9058-9064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), while HB101/pRI203 was similarly grown to stationary phase (29Isberg R.R. Voorhis D.L. Falkow S. Cell. 1987; 50: 769-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The human bladder epithelial cancer cell lines designated 5637 (ATCC HTB-9) and T24 (ATCC HTB-4) were maintained in RPMI 1640 and McCoy’s 5A medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Normal primary human bladder epithelial cells were purchased from Lonza and maintained in Keratinocyte Growth Medium-2 (KGM-2) supplemented with a Single-Quots® Kit containing epidermal growth factor, bovine pituitary extract, insulin, hydrocortisone, epinephrine, and transferrin (Lonza). Paclitaxel/taxol, vinblastine sulfate, trichostatin A (TSA), sodium butyrate (NaB), nicotinamide (NA), and sodium orthovanadate were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Nocodazole and 17-AAG were purchased from Biomol, while aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) and Aurora Kinase Inhibitor II (AKI II) were from Calbiochem. Tubacin and niltubacin were kind gifts from Drs. S. Schreiber and R. Mazitschek (Broad Institute of Harvard University and MIT). Expression Plasmids—KLC2 cDNA was amplified from a human cDNA library using forward primers Klc2-F-Flag (5′-ctgaggatccatggattacaaggatgacgacgataagatggccatgatggtgtttcc-3′) or Klc2-F-HA (5′-ctgaggatccatgtacccatacgatgttccagattacgctatggccatgatggtgtttc-3′), and the reverse primer Klc2-R (5′-acgatgatatcttagcccaccagggagcttc-3′). Klc2-F-Flag and Klc2-F-HA were used to append sequences encoding N-terminal FLAG and HA tags, respectively. PCR products were digested using BamHI and EcoRV restriction enzymes and ligated into pcDNA3.1 (+) (Invitrogen) to create pKLC2_FLAG and pKLC2_HA. The sequence encoding HDAC6 was amplified by PCR from pBJ5-HDAC6 (kindly provided by S. Schreiber, Harvard University) using primer sets HDAC6-F (5′-attgcagatctatgacctcaaccggccaggattc-3′) and HDAC6-R (5′-ataatcgtcgactggtgtgggtggggcatatcct-3′). The PCR product was then digested using BglII and SalI restriction enzymes and ligated into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) to generate pEGFP_HDAC6. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Transfection and KLC2 Pull-down Assays—5637 cells were transfected with pKLC2_FLAG or pKLC2_HA using FuGENE® 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science). 16–18 h later the transfected cells were treated with DMSO or TSA (300 nm) for 3 h and lysed in MT polymerization buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 2.5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 160 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with DMSO or TSA. Lysates were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei, unbroken cells, and large debris. Tubulin within the supernatants was polymerized by addition of 20 μm taxol and 1 mm GTP (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at 33 °C. Polymerized microtubules and microtubule-associated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at room temperature for 45 min at 18,000 × g. Pellets were then resuspended in MT polymerization buffer, boiled in 1× sample buffer, sonicated, and resolved by SDS-PAGE using 12.5% polyacrylamide gels prior to transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for Western blot analysis. Protein Analysis—Western blots were performed and visualized using either enhanced chemiluminescence or an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences) as previously described (18Eto D.S. Jones T.A. Sundsbak J.L. Mulvey M.A. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e100Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used include rabbit anti-HA (Bethyl Laboratories), rabbit anti-α-tubulin (Rockland), mouse anti-acetylated tubulin (clone 6-11B-1), and anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit anti-cortactin (H222), anti-Aurora A (1G4), and anti-GEF-H1 (55B6, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-HDAC6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-pan-actin, and anti-β-actin antibodies (Abcam). Bacterial Invasion and Cell Association Assays—Gentamicin protection bacterial invasion and cell association assays were performed as described (18Eto D.S. Jones T.A. Sundsbak J.L. Mulvey M.A. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e100Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). 5637 cells were seeded into 24-well tissue culture plates and grown for 18–24 h to confluency. Two sets of triplicate wells of bladder cells were then treated with the indicated drugs or with carrier alone for the times specified prior to infection with UTI89 using a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of about 15 bacteria per host cell. Plates were spun at 600 × g for 5 min to expedite and synchronize bacterial contact with the host cell monolayers. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C in the continued presence of drug or carrier, one set of wells was washed four times with PBS with added Mg+2 and Ca+2 (PBS-Mg+2/Ca+2) before being lysed in the same buffer containing 0.3% Triton X-100. Bacteria present in these lysates, representing the total number of host cell-associated bacteria, were enumerated by plating serial dilutions on LB agar plates. To determine numbers of internalized bacteria, after the initial 2-h incubation, the second set of triplicate wells was incubated for another 2 h in medium containing 100 μg/ml of gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich) to kill any extracellular bacteria. Cells were then washed four times with PBS-Mg+2/Ca+2, lysed, and plated on LB-agar plates. In experiments using S. enterica, gentamicin was added for 1 h following an initial 30-min infection period. Levels of cell-associated and intracellular bacteria are expressed relative to untreated controls. All assays were repeated three or more times in triplicate. Gene Silencing—Expression of cortactin (human CTTN), KLC2, and Rho GEF-H1 (human ARHGEF2) was silenced using Dharmacon ON-TARGET plus SMART pool siRNA oligos specific for each gene (Dharmacon). Oligos used to silence HDAC6 and Aurora A kinase have been described previously (30Kufer T.A. Sillje H.H. Korner R. Gruss O.J. Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. J.

Nature. 2002; 417: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar), and were also purchased from Dharmacon. Nonspecific siRNA oligos were used as controls. 5637 bladder cells, grown in T25 flasks to a confluency of 70–80%, were transfected with oligos using DharmaFECT 1 reagent (Dharmacon). The cell culture medium was replaced 10–24 h post-transfection, and 24 h later the cells were seeded into 24-well plates for use in invasion and cell-association assays. Knockdown of Aurora A kinase, HDAC6, cortactin, and Rho GEF-H1 was assessed by Western blot analysis, while knockdown of KLC2 was verified by semi-quantitative RT-PCR using primers KLC2_for (5′-gaacatcctggcactggtct-3′) and KLC2_rev (5′-gccacatctgggtgaaactt-3′). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), used as an internal control for RT-PCR, was amplified using primers GAPDH_for (5′-gagtcaacggatttggtcgt-3′) and GAPDH_rev (5′-ttgattttggagggatctcg-3′). Microscopy—Bladder cells grown on 12-mm-diameter glass coverslips were washed with warm PBS-Mg+2/Ca+2 and fixed for 30 min at 37 °C in 3.7% paraformaldehyde/PBS following infection and/or treatment with the specified drugs or carrier alone. After 3 × 5-min washes with PBS, fixed samples were incubated for 30 min with blocking buffer (1% powder milk, 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS). Samples were stained for 1 h at room temperature with mouse anti-β tubulin (clone 2-28-33; Sigma-Aldrich) and rabbit or goat anti-E. coli (Biodesign International) in PBS containing 1% powdered milk and 3% BSA. Following 3 × 5 min washes in PBS, samples were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa488, -546, or -647 dyes (Molecular Probes) for 30 min. F-actin was detected using Alexa546-conjugated phalloidin (1:40, Molecular Probes). All samples were mounted, following final washes in PBS, using Fluorsave reagent (Calbiochem). Samples were visualized using either an Olympus IX70 FV300 or FV1000 confocal microscope equipped with ×60 and ×100 oil immersion objectives (Olympus PlanApo ×60 NA 1.42 and UPlanSApo ×100 NA 1.40 Oil immersion TIRFM) and argon and helium-neon (HeNe) lasers providing excitation energy at 488, 543, and 633 nm. RhoA Activation Assays—Levels of RhoA activation in drug-treated and untreated 5637 cells were determined using a RhoA activation assay Biochem kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Cytoskeleton, Inc.). Microtubules Are Required for UPEC Invasion of Host Cells— A role for microtubules, which are made up of α- and β-tubulin heterodimers, in UPEC invasion of bladder epithelial cells was tested using three specific microtubule inhibitors: nocodazole, taxol, and vinblastine. Nocodazole binds β-tubulin and thereby stimulates microtubule depolymerization, while vinblastine induces depolymerization as well as aggregation of tubulin subunits (32Hoebeke J. Van Nijen G. De Brabander M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 69: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 33De Brabander M. De May J. Joniau M. Geuens G. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1977; 1: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Taxol, on the other hand, promotes the assembly and stabilization of microtubule filaments (34Jordan M.A. Curr. Med. Chem. Anticancer Agents. 2002; 2: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Human bladder epithelial cells (ATCC 5637 cells) were incubated with increasing concentrations of each drug for 60 min prior to infection with the well-characterized type 1-piliated human cystitis isolate UTI89 (9Mulvey M.A. Schilling J.D. Hultgren S.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4572-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 27Chen S.L. Hung C.S. Xu J. Reigstad C.S. Magrini V. Sabo A. Blasiar D. Bieri T. Meyer R.R. Ozersky P. Armstrong J.R. Fulton R.S. Latreille J.P. Spieth J. Hooton T.M. Mardis E.R. Hultgren S.J. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5977-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Host cell invasion by UTI89 requires expression of type 1 pili, and specifically the FimH adhesin (2Martinez J.J. Mulvey M.A. Schilling J.D. Pinkner J.S. Hultgren S.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2803-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 18Eto D.S. Jones T.A. Sundsbak J.L. Mulvey M.A. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e100Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). As determined by using standard gentamicin protection-based invasion assays, all three drugs were found to inhibit UTI89 invasion in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1, a–c). None of the drugs affected bacterial viability or growth 3M. A. Mulvey, unpublished data. and none had any inhibitory effects on bacterial adherence to the bladder cells (Fig. 1d). Removal of the drugs just prior to infection made the bladder cells susceptible once again to invasion by UTI89, demonstrating that the effects of all three drugs were reversible (supplemental Fig. S1). Confocal microscopy verified that the microtubule filaments seen in control cells treated with carrier (DMSO) alone were completely disrupted by nocodazole treatment (Fig. 1e). In contrast, taxol caused the formation of elongated stabilized microtubules that arced through the cell interior beneath the cortical actin cytoskeleton; while vinblastine treatment led to the formation of perinuclear tubulin aggregates. At low concentrations (≤300 nm), nocodazole can effectively perturb microtubule dynamics without causing substantial disruption of microtubule filaments (36Liao G. Nagasaki T. Gundersen G.G. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3473-3483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The decreasing effectiveness of low doses of nocodazole in our invasion assays (Fig. 1a) suggested that dynamic rearrangement of microtubules was not critical for UPEC invasion of host cells. Imaging of infected bladder cells, in the absence of drugs, supported this conclusion. Although we saw microtubules crisscrossing sites of UPEC entry, we could discern no specific recruitment of these filaments toward incoming bacteria (Fig. 1f). GEF-H1 Does Not Affect Host Cell Invasion by UPEC—In our assays we noted that nocodazole-induced disassembly of microtubules stimulated the formation of prominent actin stress fibers (Fig. 1e). These were rarely seen in untreated control bladder cells and were not obvious in cells treated with either taxol or vinblastine. The formation of actin stress fibers following treatment of other cell lines with nocodazole has been attributed to enhanced stimulation of Rho GTPases downstream of the microtubule-associated guanine nucleotide exchange factor GEF-H1, which can be activated following microtubule disassembly (24Liu B.P. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 5: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 37Krendel M. Zenke F.T. Bokoch G.M.

Yoon S.H. Bokoch G.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2008; 18: 210-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Relative to control and taxol-treated bladder cells, both nocodazole and vinblastine caused modest increases in the levels of activated RhoA-GTP, as determined using pull-down assays with the Rho binding domain of the RhoA effector rhotekin (Fig. 2a). These results suggested that aberrant activation of Rho GTPases downstream of GEF-H1 could be responsible for attenuating UPEC invasion following disruption of host microtubules. However, this does not appear to be the case since silencing of GEF-H1 expression using short interfering RNA (siRNA) had no discernable effect on the ability of UPEC to bind or invade bladder epithelial cells, regardless of nocodazole treatment (Fig. 2, b–d). HDAC6-mediated Invasion of Bladder Cells by UPEC—Microtubules are subject to a number of post-translational modifications, including acetylation, polyglutamylation, polyglycylation, detyrosination, and phosphorylation (40MacRae T.H. Eur J Biochem. 1997; 244: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Acetylation of the ε-amino group of a conserved lysine residue (Lys-40) within the N terminus of α-tubulin is associated with stabilized microtubules (41Westermann S. Weber K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W1986941730,"Biochemical and genetic studies have revealed that the presenilins interact with several proteins and are involved in the regulated intramembrane proteolysis of numerous type 1 membrane proteins, thereby linking presenilins to a range of cellular processes. In this study, we report the characterization of a highly conserved tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6) consensus-binding site within the hydrophilic loop domain of presenilin-1 (PS-1). In coimmunoprecipitation studies we indicate that presenilin-1 interacts with TRAF6 and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 2. Substitution of presenilin-1 residues Pro-374 and Glu-376 by site-directed mutagenesis greatly reduces the ability of PS1 to associate with TRAF6. By studying these interactions, we also demonstrate that the interleukin-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1) undergoes intramembrane proteolytic processing, mediated by presenilin-dependent γ-secretase activity. A metalloprotease-dependent proteolytic event liberates soluble IL-1R1 ectodomain and produces an ∼32-kDa C-terminal domain. This IL-1R1 C-terminal domain is a substrate for subsequent γ-secretase cleavage, which generates an ∼26-kDa intracellular domain. Specific pharmacological γ-secretase inhibitors, expression of dominant negative presenilin-1, or presenilin deficiency independently inhibit generation of the IL-1R1 intracellular domain. Attenuation of γ-secretase activity also impairs responsiveness to IL-1β-stimulated activation of the MAPKs and cytokine secretion. Thus, TRAF6 and interleukin receptor-associated kinase 2 are novel binding partners for PS1, and IL-1R1 is a new substrate for presenilin-dependent γ-secretase cleavage. These findings also suggest that regulated intramembrane proteolysis may be a control mechanism for IL-1R1-mediated signaling.

Family members are characterized as type 1 integral membrane proteins, with a cysteine-rich extracellular domain for ligand binding and a catalytically deficient, homologous cytoplasmic Toll/IL-1R domain (TIR domain) (3Takeda K. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (2462) Google Scholar). As the receptors have no intrinsic enzymatic activity, they form multimeric receptor complexes and through homophilic protein-protein interactions recruit and cooperate with a number of cytosolic protein partners to produce cellular responses. These signaling molecules include the interleukin receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6), and a set of TIR domain-containing adapter proteins as follows: myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), MyD88 adapter-like protein (Mal; also known as TIRAP), TIR domain-containing adapter protein inducing interferon-β (TRIF, also termed TICAM-1), and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM, also termed TIRP or TICAM-2) (3Takeda K. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (2462) Google Scholar). A critical event in the activation of intracellular signaling pathways by IL-1β acting via IL-1R type 1 (IL-1R1) or bacterial lipopolysaccharide acting via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is the oligomerization and Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination (K63-pUb) of TRAF6 (5Inoue J.

This results in the amplification of a signaling pathway culminating in the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), and transcription factors NF-κB and Tpl2 (9Beinke S.

The responsiveness of the IL-1/Toll receptor superfamily regulates several biological functions, including appropriate adaptive and innate immunity, control of programmed cell death within the developing central nervous system, stress response, and bone metabolism (1Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas uncontrolled responses, because of disproportionate activation of the TLR-IL-1R pathways, contribute to fatal immune disorders (2Creagh E.M. O'Neill L.A. Trends Immunol. 2006; 8: 352-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 3Takeda K. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (2462) Google Scholar). Therefore, to retain immune homeostasis and the health of an organism while avoiding severe disorders, TLR-IL-1R signaling is carefully regulated. The IL-1 ligands (IL-1α and IL-1β) have two homologous receptors, IL-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1) and IL-1 receptor type 2 (IL-1R2) (4Subramaniam S. Stansberg C. Cunningham C. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2004; 28: 415-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Upon IL-1α/β binding, IL-1R1 forms a complex with IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) and initiates a cytosolic signaling cascade as discussed above (4Subramaniam S. Stansberg C. Cunningham C. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2004; 28: 415-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In contrast, IL-1R2 functions as a “decoy” receptor, which undergoes ectodomain shedding and competes with cell surface IL1-R1 for ligand binding (11Colotta F. Dower S.K. Sims J.E. Mantovani A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 562-566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). An IL-1 receptor antagonist exists, which binds to IL-1R1 and blocks ligand binding (12Arend W.P. Malyak M. Guthridge C.J. Gabay C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 27-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). In addition to the existence of decoy and antagonistic receptors, post-translational modifications, including glycosylation (13Dower S.K. Wignall J.M. Schooley K. McMahan C.J. Jackson J.L.

Therefore, an important approach to deciphering the regulation of cytokine signaling is not only the characterization of receptor-interacting proteins and assembly of signaling pathways, but also the study of receptor post-translational modifications. One important mechanism by which cytokine signaling is regulated is through the generation and release of soluble cytokine receptors, which can bind their corresponding ligand (cytokine) and either positively or negatively regulate their biological activity (21Levine S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 284: 14177-14181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-converting enzyme (ADAM-17) is a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain) family of zinc metalloproteases, which functions as a cytokine receptor sheddase for the TNF receptor and IL-1R/TLR superfamilies (21Levine S.J.

Additionally, TNF-α-converting enzyme mediates a proteolytic cleavage event in the proximal extracellular domain of numerous other type 1 membrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein, Jagged, Delta, pro-TNF-α, the TNF receptors, IL-1R2, IL-2-α receptor, IL-6 receptor, Notch, p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), and ErbB4 (18Urra S.

The γ-secretase complex is composed of at least four components, presenilin (PS1 or PS2), nicastrin, Pen-2, and Aph-1 (Aph-1aL, Aph-1aS, or Aph-1b), and all four proteins are necessary for full proteolytic activity (40Sato T.

MAS is activated by Ca2+ in mitochondria from tissues with aralar as the only AGC isoform with an S0.5 of ∼300 nm. We have studied the role of aralar and its Ca2+-binding EF-hand motifs in glucose-induced mitochondrial NAD(P)H generation by two-photon microscopy imaging in INS-1 β-cells lacking aralar or expressing aralar mutants blocked for Ca2+ binding. Aralar knock-down in INS-1 β-cell lines resulted in undetectable levels of aralar protein and complete loss of MAS activity in isolated mitochondria and in a 25% decrease in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. MAS activity in mitochondria from INS-1 cells was activated 2-3-fold by extramitochondrial Ca2+, whereas aralar mutants were Ca2+ insensitive. In Ca2+-free medium, glucose-induced increases in mitochondrial NAD(P)H were small (1.3-fold) and unchanged regardless of the lack of aralar. In the presence of 1.5 mm Ca2+, glucose induced robust increases in mitochondrial NAD(P)H (∼2-fold) in cell lines with wild-type or mutant aralar. There was a ∼20% reduction in NAD(P)H response in cells lacking aralar, illustrating the importance of MAS in glucose action. When small Ca2+ signals that resulted in extremely small mitochondrial Ca2+ transients were induced in the presence of glucose, the rise in mitochondrial NAD(P)H was maintained in cells with wild-type aralar but was reduced by ∼50% in cells lacking or expressing mutant aralar. These results indicate that 1) glucose-induced activation of MAS requires Ca2+ potentiation; 2) Ca2+ activation of MAS represents a larger fraction of glucose-induced mitochondrial NAD(P)H production under conditions where suboptimal Ca2+ signals are associated with a glucose challenge (50 versus 20%, respectively); 3) inactivation of EF-hand motifs in aralar prevents activation of MAS by small Ca2+ signals. The results suggest a possible role for aralar and MAS in priming the β-cell by Ca2+-mobilizing neurotransmitter or hormones.

The increased glucose-induced energy production results from two processes: mass action of glucose (or glucose push) and signal-dependent potentiation of metabolism (1Wiederkehr A. Wollheim C.B. Cell Calcium. 2008; 44: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It is believed that mass action of glucose is governed by glucokinase as glucose sensor and increased substrate pressure is the driving force for the generation of glycolysis-derived cytosolic NADH, pyruvate formation, redox transfer to mitochondria through shuttle activity, and the glucose-induced respiratory burst (2Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). After the closure of ATP-dependent K+ channels (KATP channels), Ca2+ enters in the β-cell (2Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 3Maechler P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1803-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 4Wiederkehr A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 2643-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and potentiates metabolism activating mitochondrial dehydrogenases subsequent to Ca2+ inflow into the mitochondrial matrix (1Wiederkehr A. Wollheim C.B. Cell Calcium. 2008; 44: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the initial increase of cellular NAD(P)H/NAD+(P), which is produced by mass action of glucose precedes the first cytosolic Ca2+ signal recorded (5Pralong W.F. Bartley C. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 6Pralong W.F. Spat A. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27310-27314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, glucose oxidation to CO2, which largely reflects Krebs cycle activity is markedly reduced in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, and thus requires Ca2+ potentiation (1Wiederkehr A. Wollheim C.B. Cell Calcium. 2008; 44: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 7Hellman B. Idahl L.A. Lernmark A. Sehlin J. Taljedal I.B. Biochem.

Paradoxically, it has been reported that glucose-induced NAD(P)H production, which reflects mainly mitochondrial NAD(P)H, was not significantly reduced in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (9Gilon P. Henquin J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20713-20720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the extent to which Ca2+ signal potentiation is required for NAD(P)H production and the actual pathways involved is an open question. Krebs cycle dehydrogenase activation may proceed through glucose mass action, as pyruvate derived from glucose is pushed into mitochondria (1Wiederkehr A. Wollheim C.B. Cell Calcium. 2008; 44: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and is oxidized in the organelle forming mitochondrial NAD(P)H. However, Ca2+ activates pyruvate, isocitrate, and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenases and this is expected to potentiate mitochondrial NAD(P)H production. Redox shuttle systems, particularly the malate aspartate shuttle (MAS), are also pathways for glucose-induced NAD(P)H production in mitochondria (10MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and MAS is now known to be activated by Ca2+ (11del Arco A. Satrustegui J. J. Biol.

Aralar has Ca2+-binding motifs in a long N-terminal extension of the carrier, which faces the intermembrane space and allows activation of the shuttle by cytosolic, but not mitochondrial, Ca2+ signals, in brain, skeletal muscle, and heart mitochondria (11del Arco A.

Aralar overexpression in the β-cell increases glucose-induced rises in NAD(P)H levels and mitochondrial membrane potential, and the increase in mitochondrial activation correlates with augmentation of GSIS (17Rubi B. del Arco A. Bartley C. Satrustegui J. Maechler P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55659-55666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It appears that because aralar levels in INS-1 β-cell lines and islets are lower than those found in neurons or skeletal muscle cells, increasing aralar levels augmented MAS activity and GSIS. This may result from glucose-mass action, cytosolic redox transfer keeping pace with glycolysis. Here we have studied the impact of aralar knock-down and the importance of the intermembrane space Ca2+ binding motifs of aralar on metabolism-secretion coupling. MAS activity in mitochondria isolated from INS-1 cells was activated by extramitochondrial Ca2+ in the same range as that of brain or skeletal muscle, but not if aralar Ca2+-binding motifs were mutated. Our results reveal that cytosolic Ca2+ binding to aralar is required for glucose-stimulated NAD(P)H transfer to mitochondria through MAS. Moreover, Ca2+ activation of shuttle activity in cells expressing wild-type but not mutated aralar accounted for most of the NAD(P)H produced in mitochondria under conditions in which glucose-induced entry of Ca2+ in mitochondria was prevented, and a small cytosolic Ca2+ signal was delivered together with glucose. The results suggest a possible role for aralar and MAS in priming the β-cell by Ca2+-mobilizing neurotransmitter or hormones. Vector Construction—To knock-down aralar, we have followed previously described methods (18Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar) to generate aralar shRNA.pSUPER or empty pSUPER constructs from pSUPER. retro. To generate aralar shRNA.pSUPER, oligonucleotides were designed containing the aralar target sequence (shRNA A6), the mouse U6 (mU6) promoter fused to a sense strand of a 20-nucleotide sequence (GTTAGCTTCTCCTACTTCAA) followed by a short spacer (TTCAAGAGA), the reverse complement of the sense strand, and five thymidines as an RNA polymerase III transcriptional stop signal. The selection of the coding sequences for shRNA was empirically determined but they started with G, contained 40-55% GC, and were analyzed by BLAST research to ensure that they did not have significant sequence homology with other genes. Plasmid PGTEmU6 (Ambion) was used as a template for PCR isolation of the mU6 promoter. The PCR conditions were 96 °C denaturation for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of 96 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min; followed by one cycle of 72 °C for 10 min. The resulting PCR product was cloned into pCRII-TOPO (Invitrogen) to generate shRNA.pCRII-TOPO. To generate aralar shRNA.pSUPER, pSUPER.retro was digested with EcoRI and the shRNA cassette digested with EcoRI/EcoRI from shRNA. pCRII-TOPO was ligated into the vector. The H1 promoter from pSUPER.retro was deleted with NspV/AccI. The configuration of the construct was verified by DNA sequencing. To reconstitute the expression of wild-type aralar on cells expressing aralar shRNA.pSUPER vector, we have introduced mutations in the shRNA target sequence. To this end, mutations in the third base of the codons for Phe216, Ser217, and Tyr218 were introduced in the 1.04-kb BstEII fragment of FLAG-tagged pIRESaralar1 (11del Arco A. Satrustegui J. J. Biol.

The resulting sequence escapes RNA interference effects while maintaining the amino acid sequence. To generate an aralar protein inactive in Ca2+-binding, amino acids Glu27 (position x) and Asp29 (position y) of EF-hand 1, and amino acids Asp65 (position x) and Thr67 (position y) of EF-hand 2 of the aralar sequence (11del Arco A.

FLAG-tagged pIRESaralar1 and FLAG-tagged pIRESaralar1Mut vectors were confirmed by sequencing.

Stable cell lines expressing aralar shRNA.pSUPER (aralar KD) were selected for puromycyn resistance by plating for 3 weeks in media containing 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). The FLAG-tagged pIRESaralar1 and pIRESaralar1Mut vectors were transfected into the aralar KD cell line (1 μg DNA/1 × 106 cells). Stable cell lines expressing either FLAG-tagged pIRESaralar1 (Wt 24) or pIRESaralar1Mut (Mut 37) were selected for hygromycin resistance by plating for 3 weeks in media containing 200 μg/ml hygromycin (Calbiochem) and 1 μg/ml puromycin. Clonal cell lines were grown and maintained in the presence of 1 μg/ml puromycin or 1 μg/ml puromycin plus 100 μg/ml hygromycin. For all transfections Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) was used. Clonal lines were isolated with cloning cylinders (Sigma) and verified by Western blotting. Western Blotting—To determine the protein levels of aralar, FLAG-tagged aralar, or its Ca2+-binding mutant, cells were homogenized in lysis buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4, 1 mm iodoacetate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Proteins were determined by the Bradford method. Homogenates (20 μg) were subjected to electrophoresis on a 8% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of SDS, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell), and analyzed by Western blotting. Antibodies specific against aralar1 peptide-(12-343) (N-terminal extension) (15Del Arco A. Agudo M. Satrustegui J. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and FLAG peptide (Sigma) were used as first antibodies (1:5,000) with goat anti-rabbit and horse anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated IgG secondary antibodies and processed with the luminescence technique ECL (Amersham Biosciences). As control, an antibody against the β-subunit of F1-ATPase (generous gift of Professor J. M. Cuezva) was used (1:10,000). Quantitation of the bands with respect to β-subunit of F1-ATPase was carried out by densitometry (GS-800 Calibrated densitometer Bio-Rad, with Bio-Rad Quantity One software). Isolation of Mitochondria from INS-1 Clonal β-Cells—Cells were washed twice in homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4), harvested from the dish using a cell scraper and sedimented (350 × g for 10 min). Cells were homogenized in homogenization buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm iodoacetamide) and nuclei, cell debris and intact cells were removed by centrifugation for 3 min at 1,090 × g. Mitochondrial fractions were then spun down (11 min, 12,100 × g), resuspended in MSK (75 mm mannitol, 25 mm sucrose, 5 mm potassium phosphate, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) and kept on ice until used. Proteins were measured by the Bradford method. The respiratory competence of the mitochondrial preparation was assessed by verifying succinate-dependent oxygen consumption and ADP-stimulated respiration with Clark-type electrode (about 20 and 60 nanoatoms O2/min/mg of protein for mitochondria in State 4 and State 3, respectively). Reconstitution of the Malate-Aspartate NADH Shuttle Activity in Mitochondria—MAS activity was reconstituted in mitochondria isolated from INS-1 clonal β-cells as described (13Pardo B. Contreras L.

Mitochondrial fractions (0.4 mg of protein) were suspended in 2 ml of MSK and the shuttle was reconstituted in the presence of 4 units/ml glutamate-oxalacetate transaminase, 6 units/ml malate dehydrogenase, 66 μm NADH, 5 mm malate, 0.5 mm ADP, 200 nm ruthenium red, and appropriate CaCl2 additions. MAS activity was started by the addition of 5 mm glutamate and measured as a decrease in NADH fluorescence (excitation at 340 nm, emission at 465 nm) at 37 °C under constant stirring, which was calibrated with appropriate NADH standards. Free Ca2+ Calibration—The free Ca2+ concentrations were determined fluorimetrically with Fura-2 (below 1 μm free Ca2+) and Calcium Green (above 1 μm free calcium) as described (13Pardo B.

The concentrations of Fura-2 (Kd = 224 nm; excitation, 340 and 380 nm; emission, 510 nm) and Calcium Green (Kd = 14 μm; excitation, 506 nm; emission, 532 nm) were 5 and 0.1 μm, respectively (Molecular Probes). The free Ca2+ concentration was obtained by established procedures for ratiometric or non-ratiometric probes (21Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 22Martinez A. Vitorica J. Satrustegui J. Neurosci. Lett. 1988; 88: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—Cells were cultured in polylysine-coated 24-well plates 48 h before the experiment. Cells were preincubated with 10 μg/ml rhodamine 123 for 20 min at 37 °C in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate Hepes buffer (KRBH buffer; 140 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) and washed in the same buffer. The ΔΨm was monitored at 37 °C in a plate reader fluorimeter (Fluostar Optima) with excitation and emission filters set at 485 and 520 nm, respectively. Insulin Secretion Assay—Cells were cultured in 24-well plates coated with polyornithine 48 h before the experiment. The cells were washed and preincubated in glucose-free KRBH supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (KRBH/bovine serum albumin). Next, cells were stimulated for 30 min with 2.5 or 15 mm glucose or 30 mm KCl (in the presence of 2.5 mm glucose). Insulin secretion was determined by insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (SPI-BIO). Total insulin content was extracted with 10% acetic acid in ethanol (v/v). Secreted insulin was expressed as a percentage of total cellular insulin content. Imaging Measurements of Cytosolic Ca2+ in INS-1 Cells—Cells growing on coverslips coated with polylysine were loaded with 2 μm Fura-2 AM (Molecular Probes) for 40 min at 37 °C in glucose-free RPMI 1640 medium, and washed for 5-10 min in KRBH. Then coverslips were mounted in a perifusion chamber on the microscope stage as described earlier (23Ruiz F. Alvarez G. Pereira R. Hernandez M. Villalba M. Cruz F. Cerdan S. Bogonez E. Satrustegui J. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 1277-1282PubMed Google Scholar) and Fura-2 fluorescence was imaged ratiometrically using alternate excitation at 340 and 380 nm and a 510-nm emission filter with a Neofluar 40X/0.75 objective (13Pardo B.

Single cell analysis of the changes in [Ca2+]i were expressed as the ratio of fluorescence intensity at 340 (F340) and 380 nm (F380)(F340/F380). Image acquisition and analysis were performed with the Aquacosmos 2.5 software (Hamamatsu). Mitochondrial Ca2+ Measurements in INS-1 Cells—INS-1 cells were seeded onto poly-l-ornithine-coated Thermanox plastic coverslips (13 mm diameter, Nalge Nunc). Attached cells were infected with an adenovirus carrying mitochondrially targeted Aequorin (24Ishihara H. Maechler P. Gjinovci A. Herrera P.L. Wollheim C.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Cells were analyzed 48 h after viral infection. The aequorin measurements were performed as described (25Kennedy E.D. Rizzuto R. Theler J.M. Pralong W.F. Bastianutto C. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 2524-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cells were loaded with coelenterazine (2.5 μm) in glucose-free RPMI 1640 for 2 h. They were then perifused with KRBH buffer (1 ml/min) at 37 °C and the Ca2+ signal-dependent luminescence was monitored. Two-photon Excitation Microscopy in INS-1 Cells—INS-1 cells were seeded on 24 × 50-mm glass coverslips at the bottom of plastic dishes that were mounted in a perifusion chamber or on glass coverslips sealed at the bottom of plastic wells (4-well LabTek chamber slide systems, NUNC). In both cases the coverslips were coated with polylysine. Cells were washed once and incubated in KRBH for 1 h before experimentation. Two-photon excitation microscopy was performed by using Nikon TE300 inverted microscope with a S Fluor ×40/1.30 oil objective and an additional digital magnification of ×2, coupled to a RTS 2000 MP (Bio-Rad) confocal/multiphoton microscopy system. An infrared multiphoton laser (Coherent Mira 690-1000 nm) provided excitation of intrinsic NADH fluorescence with a long wave excitation at 735 nm with 150-fs pulses. Images were collected with a 480/50 nm emission filter. Cells were maintained at 37 °C with a temperature-controlled microscopic stage. Additions as indicated were made as a bolus. Images (512 × 512 pixels per frame, 0.178 μm/pixel) were taken every 10 s for 400-1300 s. Image analysis was carried out with MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging). Mitochondrial intensities were determined in individual cells following procedures used in islet β-cells (26Patterson G.H. Knobel S.M. Arkhammar P. Thastrup O. Piston D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5203-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 27Rocheleau J.V. Head W.S. Nicholson W.E. Powers A.C. Piston D.W. J. Biol.

Satrustegui J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1039-1047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Individual cells were outlined, and intensity thresholds were set that highlighted the bright areas that corresponded to in-focus mitochondria. With these thresholds, which may underestimate the mitochondrial fluorescence but avoid contamination from the cytoplasmic compartment, the intensity of these bright areas was calculated. Changes in mitochondrial NAD(P)H fluorescence were then quantified and normalized as F/F0 fluorescence values. Knock-down of Aralar—The aralar shRNA.pSUPER and the empty pSUPER vector as control were transfected into INS-1 clonal β-cells and stable cell lines were established. One of the different clones for aralar shRNA.pSUPER in which the levels of aralar protein was undetectable at all passage numbers tested was selected as the aralar knock-down INS-1 cell line used in this study (aralar KD) (Fig. 1A). To obtain wild-type aralar in cells knocked-down for aralar (Wt 24), a vector carrying FLAG-tagged aralar (pIRESaralar1Wt-FLAG) was transfected into aralar KD cells and stable cell lines were established. The levels of aralar protein in the Wt 24 cell line were similar to those of normal INS-1 cells as tested by Western blotting using the anti-aralar antibody (Fig. 1B). To verify that aralar knock-down was effective MAS activity was reconstituted in mitochondria isolated from aralar KD and Wt 24 cell lines. Fig. 1C shows that MAS activity was essentially absent in mitochondrial fractions from aralar KD cells. Effects of Aralar KD on Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (ΔΨm)—Having confirmed that knock-down of aralar was effective in abolishing MAS activity, we tested the effects of aralar deficiency on glucose-induced mitochondrial hyperpolarization. In both aralar KD and Wt 24 cells, the mitochondrial membrane was hyperpolarized by 15 mm glucose (Fig. 2A). The protonophore carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone collapsed ΔΨm. There were no significant differences between the Wt 24 and aralar KD cells. Effects of Aralar KD on Glucose-induced Insulin Secretion—Insulin secretion in response to a stimulatory glucose concentration (15 mm) was assayed in Wt 24 and aralar KD cells over a stimulation period of 30 min and expressed as % of insulin content (Fig. 2B). At basal glucose concentration (2.5 mm glucose) 2.28 ± 0.8% insulin was released from Wt 24 cells. Stimulatory glucose (15 mm) caused an increase in insulin secretion to 9.86 ± 0.92% of content (p < 0.001). Compared with Wt 24 cells the insulin secretory response in aralar KD cells was attenuated by 25.7% (p < 0.05) (from 2.20 ± 0.43 at 2.5 mm glucose to 7.33 ± 0.64% of content, at 15 mm glucose, p < 0.001) (Fig. 2B). However, insulin release stimulated by 30 mm KCl, which rapidly depolarizes the β-cell membrane and increases Ca2+ influx without depending on mitochondrial metabolism (28Kennedy E.D. Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), was the same in the two cell lines (Fig. 2B). In addition, insulin secretion in response to glucose and KCl was"
https://openalex.org/W2019185450,"Most of the p53 target genes, all except MDM2, COP1 and PIRH2, perform functions in apoptosis, differentiation and cell cycle arrest. The aforementioned oncogenes downregulate p53 through a negative feedback mechanism, and thus contribute to tumor development. In this study, we report a new p53 target, PRL-1, which is believed to be a significant regulator in the development and metastasis of a variety of cancer types. Phosphatase of regenerating liver 1 (PRL-1) overexpression reduced the levels of endogenous and exogenous p53 proteins, and inhibited p53-mediated apoptosis. On the other hand, the ablation of PRL-1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) increased p53 protein levels. The p53 downregulation was mediated by p53 ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, p53 ubiquitination by PRL-1 was achieved through two independent pathways, by inducing PIRH2 transcription and by inducing MDM2 phosphorylation through Akt signaling. In addition, we showed that the PRL-1 gene harbors a p53 response element in the first intron, and its transcription is regulated by the p53 protein. These findings imply that the new oncogenic p53 target, PRL-1, may contribute to tumor development by the downregulation of p53 by a negative feedback mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2131946958,"Ion flow in many voltage-gated K+ channels (VGK), including the (human ether-a-go-go-related gene) hERG channel, is regulated by reversible collapse of the selectivity filter. hERG channels, however, exhibit low sequence homology to other VGKs, particularly in the outer pore helix (S5) domain, and we hypothesize that this contributes to the unique activation and inactivation kinetics in hERG K+ channels that are so important for cardiac electrical activity. The S5 domain in hERG identified by NMR spectroscopy closely corresponded to the segment predicted by bioinformatics analysis of 676 members of the VGK superfamily. Mutations to approximately every third residue, from Phe551 to Trp563, affected steady state activation, whereas mutations to approximately every third residue on an adjacent face and spanning the entire S5 segment perturbed inactivation, suggesting that the whole span of S5 experiences a rearrangement associated with inactivation. We refined a homology model of the hERG pore domain using constraints from the mutagenesis data with residues affecting inactivation pointing in toward S6. In this model the three residues with maximum impact on activation (W563A, F559A, and F551A) face out toward the voltage sensor. In addition, the residues that when mutated to alanine, or from alanine to valine, that did not express (Ala561, His562, Ala565, Trp568, and Ile571), all point toward the pore helix and contribute to close hydrophobic packing in this region of the channel."
https://openalex.org/W2023069202,"The GTPase Rnd1 affects actin dynamics antagonistically to Rho and has been implicated in the regulation of neurite outgrowth, dendrite development, and axon guidance. Here we show that Rnd1 interacts with the microtubule regulator SCG10. This interaction requires a central domain of SCG10 comprising about 40 amino acids located within the N-terminal-half of a putative α-helical domain and is independent of phosphorylation at the four identified phosphorylation sites that regulate SCG10 activity. Rnd1 enhances the microtubule destabilizing activity of SCG10 and both proteins colocalize in neurons. Knockdown of Rnd1 or SCG10 by RNAi suppressed axon extension, indicating a critical role for both proteins during neuronal differentiation.

These results indicate that SCG10 acts as an effector downstream of Rnd1 to regulate axon extensions by modulating microtubule organization. One of the earliest events during neuronal differentiation is the rapid extension of axons. The growth of axons is regulated by Rho GTPases and depends on the actin cytoskeleton, microtubule dynamics, and vesicle transport (1Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar, 2Govek E.E. Newey S.E. Van Aelst L. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar).

Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 5Da Silva J.S. Dotti C.G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 694-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). One of these processes is selected to become the axon and, as a consequence, extends rapidly. The cytoskeleton plays an important role in this process, and the stabilization of microtubules is sufficient to initiate the extension of axons (7Witte H. Neukirchen D. Bradke F. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Depolymerization of actin filaments results in the extension of multiple axons indicating that F-actin restrains microtubule extension in the growth cone (8Bradke F. Dotti C.G. Science. 1999; 283: 1931-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar).The GTPases Rnd1/Rho6, Rnd2/Rho7, and Rnd3/RhoE are a unique subfamily of Rho GTPases (9Chardin P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Unlike other Rho GTPases, Rnd proteins show low intrinsic GTPase activity and are constitutively in the active, GTP-bound state (10Foster R. Hu K.Q. Lu Y. Nolan K.M. Thissen J. Settleman J. Mol.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Similar to other Rho GTPases, Rnd1–3 have been implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Expression of Rnd1 or Rnd3 results in the loss of actin stress fibers (11Nobes C.D. Lauritzen I. Mattei M.G. Paris S. Hall A. Chardin P. J.

Rnd1 also antagonizes the effects of Rho on the actin cytoskeleton in fibroblasts and neurons. Rnd1 has been implicated in neurite extension in PC12 cells and the development of dendrites and dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons (14Aoki J. Katoh H. Mori K. Negishi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

So far, the effects of Rnd1 on cell morphology have been attributed mainly to its inhibition of Rho-dependent pathways. Rnd1 and Rnd3 antagonize Rho signaling through activation of p190 RhoGAP and inhibition of the Rho effector ROCK I (18Wennerberg K. Forget M.A. Ellerbroek S.M. Arthur W.T. Burridge K. Settleman J.

In addition, Rnd1 is involved in the guidance of axons by interacting with the cytoplasmic domain of plexins, which form the signaling subunit of semaphorin receptors (21Oinuma I. Katoh H. Negishi M.

To generate an expression vector for an shRNA directed against Rnd1 (pSRi), the oligonucleotide GATCC CCGTTA CAGGT GCTAG CGAAA TTCAA GAGAT TTCGC TAGCA CCTGT AACTT TTTC was cloned into pSUPER (28Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar). The vector for an shRNA directed against SCG10 (pSSi) was generated by cloning the oligonucleotide GATCCC CCAGC AATGG CCTAC AAGGA TTCAA GAGAT CCTTG TAGGC CATTG CTGTT TTTGG AAA into pSUPER. Two silent mutations were introduced by PCR into the target sequence of the shRNA in pcDNA3-SCG10-EE (aca gca atg gcc tac aag was mutated to cc gcc atg gcc tac aag) to generate RNAi-resistant SCG10. The following antibodies were used: Tau-1 (Chemicon; MAB3420), anti-MAP2 (Chemicon; AB5622), anti-Rnd1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-25029), anti-α-tubulin (Sigma, T6793), and Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies Molecular Probes; 1:1000). A polyclonal anti-Rnd1 antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with recombinant His-tagged Rnd1 (Pineda, Berlin, Germany). The coding sequence of human Rnd1 was subcloned into the pQE-30 vector (Qiagen) and recombinant Rnd1 was expressed in Escherichia coli M15 and purified on Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid beads following the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen). The antiserum was affinity-purified using GST-Rnd1 cross-linked to glutathione-Sepharose. The anti-EE-tag, and polyclonal and monoclonal anti-SCG10 antibodies were described previously (29Di Paolo G.

Res. 1997; 50: 1000-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—For the yeast two-hybrid screen, a deletion mutant of human Rnd1 (23Rohm B. Rahim B. Kleiber B. Hovatta I. Pu¨schel A.W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) lacking the C-terminal CAAX (cysteine-aliphatic-aliphatic -any amino acid) motif was generated by PCR using the primers AGG ATC CTT AAG GAG AGA CGG GCC CCC CAG and AGT CGA CTC AGC TTT TGG CCT TTT CCT TCT TG. The Rnd1 fragment was fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DNA-BD) of the pAS2-1 vector (Clontech) to obtain pAS2-1-Rnd1-ΔCAAX. Yeast strains Y187 and AH190, and a human fetal brain MATCHMAKER cDNA library in the pACT2 vector were obtained from Clontech. AH190 cells were transformed with the cDNA library and mated with Y187 cells containing the bait construct pAS2-1-Rnd1-ΔCAAX according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Approximately 5 × 106 diploids were screened by plating on a selective medium lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan. The prey plasmids were isolated from yeast colonies and yeast Y190 cells cotransformed with individual prey plasmids and pAS2-1-Rnd1-Δ-CAAX to confirm the interaction.Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK 293T cells were grown in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics. HEK 293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate co-precipitation. Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons from embryonic day 18 rat embryos were prepared as previously described (30Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar, 31Schwamborn J.C. Pu¨schel A.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 32Schwamborn J.C. Li Y. Pu¨schel A.W. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, hippocampi dissected from the brains were incubated with trypsin/EDTA for 15 min at 37 °C and dissociated in Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 units/ml antibiotics (all Invitrogen). Cells were seeded onto 14-mm glass coverslips coated with polyornithine (Sigma) at a density of 30–50,000 cells for transfection and 10–15,000 cells for protein localization per coverslip. 3–5 h after culturing at 37 °C and 5% CO2, medium was replaced by Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin or gentamycin (Invitrogen). Neurons were transfected by electroporation using the Rat Neuron Nucleofector kit (Amaxa) or 6–8 h after plating using the calcium phosphate method as described (32Schwamborn J.C. Li Y. Pu¨schel A.W. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For electroporation, 2.5 × 106 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of Nucleofectamin solution, transfected according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, and plated at 100,000 cells per coverslip.Immunofluorescence and Image Analysis—Neurons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde supplemented with 15% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min. Cells were analyzed using a Zeiss Axioskop 40 microscope (Carl Zeiss Micro-Imaging, Inc.) equipped with a Universal Imaging SPOT CCD camera and the WASABI (Hamamatsu), SPOT Advanced Imaging software, or Adobe Photoshop. The stage of neuronal differentiation was determined following published criteria (32Schwamborn J.C. Li Y. Pu¨schel A.W. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 33Dotti C.G. Sullivan C.A. Banker G.A. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 1454-1468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neurites that were longer than 100 μm and Tau-1-positive but MAP2 negative in the distal segments were counted as axons. MAP2-positive neurites longer than one cell diameter were counted as minor processes. Neurons that did not extend any axon were classified as unpolarized and those that extended a single axon as polarized. The Student’s t test was used to determine statistical significance.Subcellular Fractionation of E18 Rat Brains—Brains from E18 rats were homogenized in homogenizing buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm DTT, 1× EDTA-free Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) using a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was subjected to differential centrifugation at 1200 × g for 10 min (fraction S1) and 5000 × g for 10 min (fraction S2), respectively, to remove nuclei and large debris. The postnuclear supernatant S2 was subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min to obtain the cytosolic fraction (S100) and a crude membrane fraction (P100). The P100 fraction was resuspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1× PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS).In Vitro Binding Assay—GST-Rnd1, -Rnd2, and -Rnd3 were expressed in E. coli M15, cells lysed using a French press and cell lysates stored at -70 °C. GST fusion proteins were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) for 2 h at 4 °C and washed three times with binding buffer (25 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 0, 1 mm DTT). If necessary, GTPases were preloaded with GTPγS. Transfected HEK 293T cells were lysed in ice-cold cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 4 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Cell lysates were cleared for 20 min at 13,200 rpm and 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated for 1 h to overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads prepared as described above. After the beads were washed with ice-cold cell lysis buffer, bound proteins were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by Western blot. When endogenous SCG10 was used for binding assays, the whole brains from E18 rat embryos was homogenized and lysed in cell lysis buffer and supernatant was incubated with preloaded glutathione-Sepharose beads following the same procedure. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transfered onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Milipore). The membrane was blocked in 5% low fat milk in 1× PBST (0.2% Tween-20) and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin or 5% milk in 1× PBST (0.2% Tween-20) depending on the antibodies used. The primary antibodies were detected by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dianova) and an ECL detection kit (GE Healthcare).Immunoprecipitation—Transfected HEK 293T cells were lysed in ice-cold cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1× proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and incubated with 3–5 μg of antibody 4 °C for 3 h or overnight. 50 μl of protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science) was added to the lysates and incubated at 4 °C for 3–5 h. After three washes with lysis buffer, bound proteins were eluted with 2× SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blot.Production of Recombinant SCG10 and SC35–125—Because full-length SCG10 has low solubility due to its hydrophobic N terminus (25Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Di Paolo G. Lutjens R. Grenningloh G. Protein Expr. Purif. 1997; 9: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we generated His-tagged fusion proteins of the N-terminal deletion mutant of SCG10 (ΔNT34-SCG10) and the truncated form SC35–125 by inserting the region encoding amino acids 35–179 or 35–125, respectively, into the pQE-30 vector (Qiagen). SCG10 proteins were expressed in E. coli M15 and purified using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid slurry (Qiagen) as recently described in detail (27Manna T. Grenningloh G. Miller H.P. Wilson L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3543-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The eluted protein was analyzed by 14% SDS-PAGE to confirm purity and size. Buffer exchange of the eluted protein was performed by dialyzing the purified proteins in PEM buffer (80 mm Pipes, 1 mm EGTA, 4 mm MgCl2, pH 6.85).In Vitro Microtubule Assembly Assay—Microtubules were prepared from fresh porcine brain. The brain tissue was homogenized in buffer A (0.1 m MES, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm AEBSF, pH 6.4) containing 0.5 m sucrose and 1 mm ATP. The MAP-enriched microtubule fraction was isolated by two cycles of temperature-dependent disassembly and assembly followed by either cold (2 °C, 60,000 × g) or warm (30 °C, 150,000 × g) centrifugations as previously described (34Shelanski M.L. Gaskin F. Cantor C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1973; 70: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar). For assembly, 1 mm GTP and 30% glycerol were added to buffer A. MAP-enriched microtubules were depolymerized on ice and resuspended at a concentration of 40 mg/ml in buffer PEM.The effects of SCG10 and Rnd1 on microtubule formation were measured using a light scattering assay (35Riederer B.M. Pellier V. Antonsson B. Di Paolo G. Stimpson S.A. Lutjens R. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Mixed tubulin, i.e. tubulin with microtubule associated proteins, at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in PEM buffer containing 1 mg/ml of GTP, was assembled by raising the temperature from 4 °C to 37 °C at time 0. Polymerization was performed with mixed tubulin either alone or in the presence of defined amounts of recombinant proteins and monitored for 30 min by measuring changes in turbidity at 350 nm in a Uvikon XS spectrophotometer (Bio-Tek Instruments) fitted with a temperature-controlled compartment.RESULTSRnd1 Interacts with SCG10—To identify new proteins interacting with Rnd1, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed with a human fetal brain cDNA library. Eight clones containing the sequence of SCG10 were isolated that grew on selective medium and were also positive for β-galactosidase activity. Retransformation of the isolated SCG10 clones confirmed the interaction with Rnd1ΔCAAX (Fig. 1A).To verify the interaction between Rnd1 and SCG10, GST pull-down assays were performed with bacterially expressed GST-Rnd1. Endogenous SCG10 from E18 rat whole brain lysate interacted with GST-Rnd1, but did not bind to the other two members of Rnd family GTPases Rnd2 and Rnd3 or GST used as a control (Fig. 1B), indicating that the interaction of SCG10 is specific for Rnd1. Rac, which regulates the destabilizing activity of stathmin (36Wittmann T. Bokoch G.M. Waterman-Storer C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6196-6203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), also did not interact with SCG10. Preloading the recombinant GTPase with GTPγS did not increase the interaction with SCG10 (data not shown), consistent with the observation that Rnd1 has very low intrinsic GTPase activity and is constitutively in the GTP-bound state (11Nobes C.D. Lauritzen I. Mattei M.G. Paris S. Hall A. Chardin P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The specific interaction with Rnd1 could also be confirmed by a GST pull-down assay with SCG10 expressed in HEK 293T cells (Fig. 2C) and by immunoprecipitation of SCG10-EE or Myc-Rnd1 after their co-expression in HEK 293T cells (Fig. 1C).FIGURE 2Rnd1 binds to the stathmin domain. A, schematic representation of the SCG10 deletion constructs. Numbers refer to amino acid position. B, indicated SCG10 deletion mutants were expressed in HEK 293T cells, and their interaction with Rnd1 analyzed by a GST pull-down assay. Bound proteins were analyzed using an anti-SCG10 antibody (upper panel). The expression of comparable amounts of mutant SCG10 proteins was verified by Western blot (lower panel). C, SCG10-EE, -4A, or -4D were expressed in HEK 293T, and cell lysates incubated with GST or GST-Rnd1 bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Rnd1 was preloaded with GTPγS. Bound proteins were analyzed by Western blot using an antibody specific for SCG10. A Western blot with an anti-EE antibody verified the expression of comparable amounts of wild type and mutant forms of SCG10. Coomassie Blue staining confirmed the loading of comparable amounts of GST or GST-Rnd1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Rnd1 Interacts with a Central Domain of SCG10 Independent of Phosphorylation—To identify the region of SCG10 that is responsible for the interaction with Rnd1, several SCG10 truncation mutants were used in a pull-down assay (Fig. 2, A and B). GST-Rnd1 bound to SCG10-ΔNT34, -ΔNT86, -ΔCT123, and -ΔCT137 expressed in HEK 293T cells but not to the smaller fragments -ΔCT111 and -ΔCT115 (Fig. 3B). Thus, amino acids 87–124 of the C-terminal stathmin-like domain with α-helical structure (37Gigant B. Curmi P.A. Martin-Barbey C. Charbaut E. Lachkar S. Lebeau L. Siavoshian S. Sobel A. Knossow M. Cell. 2000; 102: 809-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) contain sequences essential for the binding of Rnd1. However, these sequences are not sufficient to mediate the interaction with Rnd1 (supplemental Fig. S1).FIGURE 3Rnd1 enhances the microtubule destabilizing activity of SCG10. A microtubule assembly assay was performed with recombinant Rnd1 and wt or mutant forms of SCG10. Light scattering was used to measure the amount of polymerized microtubules. Mixed depolymerized microtubules (2 mg/ml tubulin; open circles) were incubated with 5 μm Rnd1 (black circles) or different forms of recombinant SCG10 (5 μm ΔSCG10: amino acids 35–179, open squares;10 μm SC35–125: amino acids 35–125, open triangles) that lacked the N-terminal hydrophobic region. To analyze the effect of Rnd1, tubulin was incubated with 5 μm Rnd1 and 5 μm ΔSCG10 (black squares), 5 μm and 10 μm Rnd1 with 10 μm SC35–125 (black triangles and diamonds, respectively) for 30 min at 37 °C. Light scattering was measured as absorbance at 350 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)SCG10 is phosphorylated by several different kinases on multiple serine residues (26Antonsson B. Kassel D.B. Di Paolo G. Lutjens R. Riederer B.M. Grenningloh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8439-8446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of phosphorylation of SCG10 at position 50, 62, 73, and 97, we used the non-phosphorylatable mutant SCG10-4A and the mutant SCG10-4D that mimics phosphorylation of the N terminus. These mutants contain 4 substitutions of the phosphorylation sites by alanine (SCG10-4A) and aspartate (SCG10-4D), respectively. GST pull-down assays showed that the interaction of Rnd1 and SCG10 is independent of these 4 phosphorylation sites (Fig. 2C). Wild-type and mutant SCG10 forms all interacted with GST-Rnd1 without apparent differences.Rnd1 Enhances the Microtubule Depolymerization Activity of SCG10—SCG10 and SCG10-4A destabilize microtubules while SCG10-4D has considerably lower activity (25Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Di Paolo G. Lutjens R. Grenningloh G. Protein Expr. Purif. 1997; 9: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 26Antonsson B. Kassel D.B. Di Paolo G. Lutjens R. Riederer B.M.

Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Rnd1 enhances the microtubule depolymerization activity of SCG10 directly, we used an in vitro microtubule assembly assay (35Riederer B.M. Pellier V. Antonsson B. Di Paolo G. Stimpson S.A. Lutjens R. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Because full-length SCG10 has low solubility due to the hydrophobic N-terminal region (25Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Di Paolo G. Lutjens R. Grenningloh G. Protein Expr. Purif. 1997; 9: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we used an N-terminal deletion mutant of SCG10 (ΔNT34-SCG10) and the truncated form SC35–125 for these assays. Twice the concentration of SC35–125 was required to obtain the same microtubule-destabilizing activity as ΔNT34-SCG10 (Fig. 3C), because it binds only one tubulin dimer while SCG10 binds two tubulin dimers. 6G. Grenningloh, unpublished results. Addition of Rnd1 to tubulin at a concentration of 5 μm had no effect on microtubule polymerization by itself (Fig. 3). When combined with 5 μm ΔNT34-SCG10 or 10 μm SC35–125, Rnd1 significantly enhanced their destabilizing effect on microtubules. The decrease of microtubule assembly was even stronger with 10 μm Rnd1. These results show that Rnd1 enhances the microtubule-destabilizing activity of SCG10.Localization of Rnd1 and SCG10 in Cultured Hippocampal Neurons—To investigate the subcellular localization of Rnd1 in neurons, a polyclonal anti-Rnd1 antiserum was generated by immunizing rabbits with purified recombinant His-tagged Rnd1. Lysates from HEK 293T cells transfected with vectors for GFP-Rnd1, GFP-Rnd2, or GFP-Rnd3 were probed with the purified Rnd1 antiserum to test the specificity of the antibody (Fig. 4A). The antibody recognized only GFP-Rnd1, but not GFP-Rnd2 or GFP-Rnd3. It also detects endogenous Rnd1 in lysates of E18 rat embryo brain (Fig. 4B). Rnd1 was present in the crude membrane fraction (Fig. 4B; P100 fraction; containing phosphorylated forms of SCG10) as well as in the cytosolic fraction (S100 fraction; containing cytosolic SCG10).FIGURE 4Rnd1 and SCG10 are present in neurites. A, the specificity of the affinity purified anti-Rnd1 antiserum was tested using lysates from HEK 293T cells transfected with vectors for EGFP-Rnd1, -Rnd2, or -Rnd3. Western blots were probed with anti-GFP (upper panel) and the anti-Rnd1 antiserum (lower panel; dilution 1:5000). B, subcellular fractions (homogenate: H, S1, S2, S100, and P100; see “Experimental Procedures”) from E18 rat brain were probed with the anti-Rnd1 antiserum (upper panel) or an anti-SCG10 antibody (lower panel). C, Rnd1 and SCG10 distribution in neurons. Hippocampal neurons were fixed at stage 3 (3 d.i.v.) with paraformaldehyde and stained with the anti-Rnd1 (sc-25029, green) and a polyclonal anti-SCG10 antibody (red).

Bacterial appendages, such as flagella and pili, are required for bacterial motility or adherence, thus playing an important role in bacterial interaction with the host and environment (1Kang H.J. Coulibaly F. Clow F. Proft T. Baker E.N. Science.. 2007; 318: 1625-1628Google Scholar). These appendages are often composed of repeated monomers. The monomers are linked together via varying mechanisms and form filaments of different length and width, with some easy to detect and others not (1Kang H.J. Coulibaly F. Clow F. Proft T. Baker E.N. Science.. 2007; 318: 1625-1628Google Scholar). A novel adhesin protein, FadA, was recently identified from the opportunistic human pathogen Fusobacterium nucleatum (2Han Y.W. Ikegami A. Rajanna C.

F. nucleatum is one of the most abundant Gram-negative anaerobes colonizing the subgingival plaque, present in both healthy and diseased periodontal sites and associated with various forms of periodontal disease (3Moore W.E. Moore L.V. Periodontol. 2000.. 1994; 5: 66-77Google Scholar). It has been suggested that F. nucleatum migrates from its primary site of colonization in the oral cavity to other parts of the body via hematogenous transmission. Transmission of F. nucleatum into amniotic fluid and placenta of pregnant women causes premature delivery (4Chaim W. Mazor M. Arch. Gynecol. Obstet.. 1992; 251: 9-15Google Scholar). Animal studies have shown that, once in the bloodstream, F. nucleatum specifically colonizes the placenta and activates TLR4-mediated placental inflammatory responses, leading to preterm and term stillbirths and unsustained live births (5Han Y.W.

The secreted mature FadA (mFadA) 3The abbreviations used are: mFadA, mature FadA; ALS, Advanced Light Source; APS, Advanced Photon Source; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; mAb, monoclonal antibodies; MAD, multiple wavelengths anomalous dispersion; r.m.s., root mean square. consists of 111 amino acids (Fig. 1) and is easily dissociated from the bacteria by washing (8Xu M. Yamada M. Li M. Liu H. Chen S.G. Han Y.W. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 25000-25009Google Scholar). Mixtures of pre-FadA and mFadA form high molecular weight aggregates, which are required for attachment and invasion of the host cells (8Xu M. Yamada M. Li M. Liu H. Chen S.G. Han Y.W. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 25000-25009Google Scholar). We recently crystallized the recombinant mFadA-His6 tag fusion protein (9Nithianantham S. Xu M. Wu N. Han Y.W. Shoham M. Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Crystalliz. Comm.. 2006; 62: 1215-1217Google Scholar). Here we report the crystal structure of mFadA at 2.0 Å resolution and its relation to the oligomeric antenna-like assembly observed in the electron micrographs of FadA. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Construction of FadA Variants—E. coli DH5α and BL21 (DE3) were maintained as described previously (8Xu M. Yamada M. Li M. Liu H. Chen S.G. Han Y.W. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 25000-25009Google Scholar). Plasmid pYWH417-6 carries the entire fadA gene in the pET21 (b) expression vector (Novagen, San Diego, CA), producing both mFadA and pre-FadA, each with a His tag fusion at the carboxyl end (8Xu M. Yamada M. Li M. Liu H. Chen S.G. Han Y.W. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 25000-25009Google Scholar). The FadA variants were constructed with the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), using the primers listed in supplemental Table 1 and following the manufacturer's instructions. Immunofluorescent Staining of FadA—F. nucleatum was harvested by centrifugation and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline. The suspension was spotted onto a glass slide and allowed to air dry. After methanol fixation, the bacteria were first incubated with 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with anti-FadA monoclonal antibody (mAb) 5G11-3G8 (8Xu M. Yamada M. Li M. Liu H. Chen S.G. Han Y.W. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 25000-25009Google Scholar) at 1:1,000 dilution for 30 min at 37 °C. Following washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the bacteria were incubated with FITC-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. For controls, FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies were incubated with the bacteria without prior incubation with anti-FadA mAb. Purification of FadA—Wild-type and variant recombinant FadA were expressed and purified from E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pYWH417-6 and its derivatives as described previously (8Xu M. Yamada M. Li M. Liu H. Chen S.G. Han Y.W. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 25000-25009Google Scholar). For electron microscopy and tissue-culture attachment assays, pre-FadA and mFadA were co-purified under denaturing conditions without further separation (8Xu M. Yamada M. Li M. Liu H. Chen S.G. Han Y.W. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 25000-25009Google Scholar). For crystallization and size-exclusion chromatography, mFadA was purified by washing the cells with hot phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma) followed by cobalt column purification (8Xu M. Yamada M. Li M. Liu H. Chen S.G. Han Y.W. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 25000-25009Google Scholar). Crystallization—All protein variants were crystallized by vapor diffusion in hanging or sitting drops at 295 K using VDX or Cryschem 24-well plates (Hampton Research, Riverside, CA). mFadA crystals were obtained as described previously (9Nithianantham S. Xu M. Wu N. Han Y.W. Shoham M. Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Crystalliz. Comm.. 2006; 62: 1215-1217Google Scholar). The crystallization conditions for the L14A variant protein form II were identical to wild-type mFadA except that the pH was 7.0. For all other variants (L14A form I and L76A), different crystallization conditions had to be established using screening kits from Hampton Research (Crystal Screens 1 and 2 or Additive Screens). Protein stock solutions of 20-30 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, and pH 8.0 were used. Drops were prepared by mixing 1 μl of protein solution with 1 μl of reservoir solution. The best crystals were obtained in sitting drops. Diffraction quality crystals of L14A form I were obtained from 0.1 m imidazole, pH 7.5, and 0.5 m sodium acetate. Mutant L76A crystallized from 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.2, 0.1% β-octylglucoside, and 0.1 m trimethylamine HCl. Crystals of the variant proteins grew within 1 week. X-ray Data Collection and Structure Determination—For cryoprotection, crystals of wild-type mFadA and its variants (L14A and L76A) were soaked for 30-60 s in corresponding reservoir solutions supplemented with 30% (v/v) glycerol. Crystals were mounted in a cryo loop (Hampton Research) and immediately flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen for x-ray data collection on an in-house x-ray diffraction system (Bruker Proteum II) or for transport to a synchrotron radiation source. Synchrotron data were collected at beam line 4.2.2 at the Advanced Light Source (ALS), Berkeley, CA and at beam line BM-19 of the Structural Biology Center at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne, IL. Diffraction images were processed either using DENZO and SCALEPACK from the HKL2000 suite (10Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol.. 1997; 276: 307-326Google Scholar) or with the d*TREK package (11Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr.. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab MAD Phasing and Refinement—For MAD phasing, crystals were soaked for 1 min in mother liquor containing 1 m NaBr. X-ray data sets at three wavelengths (λremote = 0.92871 Å, λpeak = 0.91979 Å, λedge = 0.919999 Å) were collected on a bromide-soaked mFadA crystal at beam line 4.2.2 at ALS to a resolution of 2.3 Å. Three bromide sites with high occupancies (1.17, 0.98, 0.37) were located with the program SOLVE (12Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr.. 1999; 55: 849-861Google Scholar) and used to derive phases with a figure of merit of 0.51. Density modification with the program RESOLVE (13Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr.. 2000; 56: 965-972Google Scholar) was used to improve the quality of the electron density map. Automatic chain tracing with the program RESOLVE yielded several helical fragments. Manual tracing in the program O (14Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A.. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar) was used to fill in the gaps. The model was refined against a wild-type mFadA data set collected at APS beamline BM-19 to a resolution of 2.0 Å by simulated annealing using the program CNS (15Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr.. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). For the variants, phases were obtained by molecular replacement using wild-type mFadA as the search model. Unambiguous rotation and translation solutions were obtained using different ranges of intensity data and integration radii with the program PHASER (16Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr.. 2001; 57: 1373-1382Google Scholar). Following rigid body and simulated annealing refinement in the program CNS, the model was manually adjusted in the program O (14Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A.. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar) prior to a final round of simulated annealing refinement. The stereochemical quality of the models was assessed using the program PROCHECK (17Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr.. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar). Coordinates and x-ray data for wild-type mFadA and variants L14A (in two different crystal forms) and L76A were deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the codes 3ETW, 3ETX, 3ETY, and 3ETZ, respectively. Structural Similarity Searches—Structural similarity searches were carried out on the DALI server (18Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res.. 1998; 26: 316-319Google Scholar). Dynamic Light Scattering—Dynamic light scattering was used to provide a quantitative assessment of the aggregation behavior of the protein. Measurements were performed at 277 K using a DynaPro instrument (Wyatt Technology Corp., Santa Barbara, CA) on 20-μl samples of mFadA at 2 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, pH 8.0. The dynamic light-scattering data were analyzed with the software provided by the manufacturer to determine the percentage of monodispersity. FPLC Superdex-200 Size-exclusion Chromatography—Experiments were performed at 277 K in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, pH 8.0. The samples were injected directly into the sample loop of anÄKTA Basic FPLC chromatography system (GE Healthcare) and onto a Superdex 200 gel filtration column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The protein peaks were detected by a UV monitor at a wavelength of 280 nm. Molecular Graphics—Molecular graphics were produced using the program PyMOL. Transmission Electron Microscopy—A total of 7.5 μg of FadA protein was mounted on Formvar carbon support nickel grid (Electron Microscopy Science, Hatfield, PA) and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. After the solution was removed, proteins were stained with 50% uranyl acetate at room temperature for 1 min. Unmounted proteins and excess dye were removed, and the specimen grid was dried at room temperature for 16 h. Observation was carried out using a Jeol JEM-1200EX electron transmission microscope (Jeol, Tokyo, Japan) with 80 kV of electron acceleration voltage. The images along with the scale bars were enlarged on 8 × 10-inch photo prints. Diameters of the filaments were measured by a ruler and estimated based on the magnification and the scale bar. Inhibitory Tissue-Cell Attachment Assay—The inhibitory tissue-cell attachment assay was performed as described previously (8Xu M. Yamada M. Li M. Liu H. Chen S.G. Han Y.W. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 25000-25009Google Scholar). FadA proteins were added to monolayers of Chinese hamster ovary and OKF6/Tert cells followed by the addition of F. nucleatum at a multiplicity of infection of 50-150:1. Following a 1-h incubation at 37 °C under 5% CO2, the monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with water. The bacterial colonies were counted, and the level of attachment was expressed as the percentage of bacteria recovered following cell lysis relative to the total number of bacteria initially added. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. FadA Is Exposed on the Bacterial Cell Surface—Because mFadA easily dissociates from the bacteria (8Xu M. Yamada M. Li M. Liu H. Chen S.G. Han Y.W. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 25000-25009Google Scholar), it is likely exposed on the bacterial cell surface. To confirm this, immunofluorescent staining of non-permeabilized F. nucleatum using anti-FadA mAb 5G11-3G8 was performed (Fig. 2). Wild-type F. nucleatum 12230 was stained positively by mAb 5G11-3G8 and the FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies but not by the secondary antibody alone. The fadA deletion mutant, US1 (2Han Y.W. Ikegami A. Rajanna C. Kawsar H.I. Zhou Y. Li M. Sojar H.T. Genco R.J. Kuramitsu H.K. Deng C.X. J. Bacteriol.. 2005; 187: 5330-5340Google Scholar), was not stained with mAb 5G11-3G8. Thus, the staining of FadA was specific, confirming that FadA is exposed on the surface of F. nucleatum 12230. The Crystal Structure of Wild-type mFadA—The crystal structure of wild-type mFadA was determined to a resolution of 2.3 Å by MAD phasing using crystals soaked for 1 min in mother liquor containing 1 m NaBr. The emerging model was subsequently refined against another wild-type mFadA data set to a resolution of 2.0 Å. All residues are in allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, and the stereochemistry is within acceptable limits of deviation from ideal values (Table 1). The structure was refined with all 15,871 reflections to a resolution of 2.0 Å; the Rcryst and Rfree are 22.5 and 25.4%, respectively. The model consists of residues 4-112 of mFadA, 162 water molecules, and one thiocyanate ion. There is no electron density for the first 3 residues at the N terminus or for residues 113-119 corresponding to the C-terminal hexahistidine tag. The molecule of mFadA has an elongated helix-loop-helix structure consisting of two antiparallel α-helices connected by an 8-residue loop (Fig. 3a). Fig. 4 shows a 2Fo-Fc electron density map of the loop region in which all depicted residues have been omitted from the phase calculation. The overall dimensions of the molecule are ∼100 × 20 × 20 Å with the N- and C-terminal α-helices being 90 and 70 Å long, respectively.FIGURE 42Fo-Fc electron density map of the hairpin region at 2. 0 Å resolution at contour level of 1.4 standard deviations above the mean. mFadA is shown in stick representation. All labeled residues were omitted from the phase calculation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Role of Leucine Residues—Leucine residues play a prominent structural role. There are 11 leucines in the 111-residue mFadA. Some of the leucines are 7 residues apart (Leu7-Leu14-Leu21 and Leu53-Leu60) as in leucine zippers, but others are not. The two antiparallel helices are stabilized by the two interhelical leucine-leucine contacts Leu53-Leu84 and Leu60-Leu76 (Fig. 3b). Additionally, Leu7-Leu11 provide intramolecular contacts between leucine residues on the same arm of the helical bundle (Fig. 3c). A string of three tyrosine residues (Tyr50, Tyr73, and Tyr80) is interspersed between leucine residues on the helix interface (Fig. 3b). The aromatic rings of these tyrosine residues are buried to provide hydrophobic contacts with leucine and other apolar side chain atoms, whereas the hydroxyl groups are exposed to solvent (supplemental Tables 2 and 3). The crystal structure of mFadA also reveals intermolecular contacts, the overwhelming majority of which are with molecules related by a simple translation along the b axis, roughly parallel to the axis of the antiparallel helix bundle (Fig. 3c). Leucine residues again play an important role in the non-covalent intermolecular interactions. Residues Leu7, Leu11, Leu14, and Leu21 on the N-terminal helix interact with Leu53, Leu76, and Leu84 from the central part of the neighboring molecule along the b axis. Additional intermolecular contacts are provided by Leu14, Leu21, Leu60, and Leu76, interacting respectively with Tyr80, Tyr73, and Tyr18 of the neighboring molecule related by the same translation along the crystallographic b axis (supplemental Table 2). Intermolecular salt bridges exist between Glu10, Asp15, Glu17, Glu25, Arg33, Arg56, Arg67, Glu75, Lys79, and Arg86 with oppositely charged amino acid residues on neighboring molecules (supplemental Fig. 1). Thus, the assembly of mFadA molecules in the crystal lattice represents a model for the long antenna-like structures. Mutagenesis of FadA—To examine the roles of the leucine residues, FadA variants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the pYWH417-6 plasmid as template, which carried the entire fadA gene. Leucine variants L14A, L14G, L14E, L14V, L21E, and L76A were generated. All mutational changes were verified by DNA sequencing analysis. Oligomerization of FadA and Its Variants—Dynamic light scattering of wild-type mFadA yielded a relatively low monodispersity value of 0.18, similar to the value of 0.15 measured for lysozyme as a standard. This result indicates that mFadA does not aggregate in a nonspecific manner. Indeed, wild-type mFadA forms distinct oligomers in solution, as evidenced by peaks I-V from size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 5). Reapplication of the material corresponding to peak I resulted in similar distribution of different oligomeric species, suggesting an equilibrium between different oligomerization states (data not shown). In contrast, mFadA containing L14A or L76A exhibited a drastically lower degree of oligomerization, corresponding to peak III (Fig. 5), as did L14V, L14G, L14E, and L21E (data not shown). It is not possible to deduce accurate molecular weight values from this elution profile because FadA is an elongated molecule, whereas the calibration curve displayed in Fig. 5, inset, was generated with globular proteins. An elongated protein is expected to migrate faster in a size exclusion column than a globular protein of the same molecular weight. Consequently, the true molecular weight of FadA oligomers might be lower than the value obtained by interpolation of the calibration curve. All three variants elute corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of about 50 kDa, which corresponds to an apparent oligomerization state containing 3.7 monomers. Thus, one may conclude that the L14A and L76A proteins form oligomers no larger than trimers or tetramers. Crystal Structure of Variant mFadA—The FadA variants crystallized differently from the wild-type protein (Table 1). Although they all crystallized in the same hexagonal space group P61 as wild-type mFadA, the length of the c axis is markedly different in the various crystal forms. L14A also crystallized in the monoclinic space group P21. The variant structures were essentially identical to wild-type mFadA with r.m.s. deviations for corresponding Cα atoms ranging from 0.6 to 1.1 Å, except that in L14A and L76A, the alanine residues at positions 14 and 76 lacked some of the inter- and intramolecular contacts of the leucine residues in the wild-type structure. Some packing interactions with neighboring molecules in the variant FadA crystal structures are different from wild type and from each other (Fig. 6). However, the head-to-tail interaction between neighboring molecules observed in the wild-type crystal structure (Fig. 7) is conserved in all the variant structures, suggesting that the head-to-tail interaction represents a physiologically relevant oligomerization motif.FIGURE 7Packing diagram of the wild-type mFadA crystal structure. Individual protomers are shown in α-carbon representation in different colors. The unit cell axes a, b, and c are indicated. Note that the helical axes are roughly parallel to the crystallographic b axis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Filament Formation of FadA and Its Variants—Electron microscopy studies revealed formation of long filaments by purified wild-type FadA (Fig. 8). The filaments varied in width, ranging from 30 to 170 Å, as well as in length. L14A and L76A exhibited no filaments (Fig. 8). Binding of FadA to the Host Cells—Purified FadA and its variants were tested in the inhibitory attachment assay. Wild-type FadA inhibited F. nucleatum binding to both Chinese hamster ovarian cells and immortalized oral keratinocytes OKF6/Tert cells, but the L14A and L76A variants did not (Fig. 9). These results indicate that only the wild-type FadA had functional binding activity, which was lost in the variants. We have shown previously that FadA is a novel adhesin and invasin from F. nucleatum involved in interactions with host cells (8Xu M. Yamada M. Li M. Liu H. Chen S.G. Han Y.W. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 25000-25009Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that FadA is likely exposed on the bacterial surface. Furthermore, a detailed structural analysis of mFadA was performed. The crystal structure of mFadA reveals a quintessential role for leucine residues, which mediate both intramolecular and intermolecular interactions. First, they comprise the main “molecular glue” to associate the two helical arms of the monomer; second, they form the head-to-tail association of monomers to form the antenna-like polymers. The unique interactions mediated by leucine residues lead to formation of a novel structural motif termed “leucine chain.” This chain is formed by intermolecular hydrophobic interactions between Leu7, Leu11, Leu14, and Leu21 on the N-terminal arm of one monomer with Leu53, Leu76, and Leu84 from the neighboring monomer. In addition, intramolecular Leu53-Leu84 and Leu60-Leu76 interactions play an important role in stabilizing the hairpin structure of the monomers. Mutagenesis of these leucine residues resulted in severely diminished oligomerization, abrogation of filament formation, and failure of binding to host cells. It should be pointed out that although the His tag was present in both wild-type and mutant FadA constructs, it is disordered in all but one crystal structure (one of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit of variant L76A where it forms a crystal contact with a tyrosine residue from a neighboring molecule). Therefore, the His tag cannot be involved in any physiologically relevant contact, nor does it play any role in the oligomerization of FadA. Although the FadA structure bears some resemblance to a leucine zipper, there are major differences between these two motifs. The leucine zipper is a dimerization motif between parallel α-helices involving a heptad repeat of leucine residues (19Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science.. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Google Scholar). In the FadA structure, some leucine residues are 7 residues apart, but others are not. Furthermore, although the intermolecular leucine-leucine interactions are between parallel α-helices, the intramolecular interactions are between antiparallel helices. Although Leu53, Leu60, Leu76, Leu84, and Leu87 are involved in intramolecular interactions between the two antiparallel α-helices, the N-terminal leucine residues Leu7, Leu11, Leu14, and Leu21 form intermolecular contacts with Leu53, Leu76, and Leu87 of a neighboring molecule in a parallel fashion. Note that Leu53, Leu76, and Leu87 are involved in both intramolecular and intermolecular interactions. Thus, the leucine chain represents a novel α-helical oligomerization motif between the N-terminal region of one subunit and the C-terminal region of another subunit. Based on the current observations as well as on previous studies, we propose a filamentous model of FadA in which mFadA monomers are linked in a head-to-tail pattern. The filament emanates from the outer membrane to allow binding to its receptor. Such a filamentous model is supported by the crystal structures of wild-type and variant mFadA. Furthermore, it is supported by observations from electron microscopy. The head-to-tail pattern has recently been observed in the crystal structure of the major pilin subunit from Streptococcus pyogenes, albeit utilizing a different oligomerization motif (1Kang H.J. Coulibaly F. Clow F. Proft T. Baker E.N. Science.. 2007; 318: 1625-1628Google Scholar). The observation that the L14A and L76A variant FadA proteins are deficient in filament formation and binding to host cells is an indication that each of these 2 leucine residues is crucial for biological function. However, in the crystal structure of these two variant proteins, the intermolecular head-to-tail interactions are preserved, albeit weakened by the lack of one leucine contact. The lower degree of oligomerization of these variant proteins observed in solution might be a consequence of the weakened head-to-tail interaction. However, the abrogation of biological function in the absence of Leu14 or Leu76 points to an additional role of these leucine residues in filament formation beyond the head-to-tail interactions. It is conceivable that the filaments seen in the electron micrographs represent a higher order structure of FadA formed by intertwining or bundling of FadA chains. Such an explanation is supported by the observation that these filaments range in width up to 170 Å, about 5-6 times the width of a single mFadA leucine chain. It may well be that both Leu14 and Leu76 are critical to the formation of the higher order structures, and mutation of these leucine residues may thus prevent filament formation. The lack of inhibition of attachment of F. nucleatum to host cells by L14A and L76A may be explained by their inability to form higher order filaments. The receptor-binding site of FadA has yet to be identified. Based on the model and the structural features of FadA, we speculate that the hairpin loop region may be the receptor-binding site because it is a unique and outstanding feature in this otherwise all-helical structure. Support of this hypothesis comes from the fact that FadA shares similarity with other coiled-coil helical structures with r.m.s. deviations of corresponding Cα atoms ranging from 2 to 3 Å. One example is the receptor-binding domain of the bacterial toxin colicin E3 with an r.m.s. deviation of 2.6 Å for 105 corresponding Cα atoms (20Soelaiman S. Jakes K. Wu N. Li C. Shoham M. Mol. Cell.. 2001; 8: 1053-1062Google Scholar). The receptor-binding site on colicin E3 is located on the hairpin loop connecting the two coiled-coil helices (21Kurisu G. Zakharov S.D. Zhalnina M.V. Bano S. Eroukova V.Y. Rokitskaya T.I. Antonenko Y.N. Wiener M.C. Cramer W.A. Nat. Struct. Biol.. 2003; 10: 948-954Google Scholar). Because the hairpin of the last monomer at the tip of the antenna would be completely exposed, it is plausible that this exposed hairpin is the attachment site to the host cells. It is possible that multiple hairpin loops at the tip of the filament have to be juxtaposed for binding to the receptor, supporting the notion of possible involvement of higher order filaments in function. The role of the loop region in FadA structure and function is currently under investigation. Also unclear at this stage is the role of pre-FadA in FadA structure and function. Is it possible that pre-FadA provides an anchor in the inner membrane and serves as a base for the mFadA monomers to build into a filamentous structure? If so, how does the FadA filament penetrate the outer membrane? Are there accessory proteins involved? These questions are also under investigation. In summary, FadA likely functions as a filament, in which elongated monomers are linked together in a head-to-tail fashion via the novel leucine chain motif. Further investigation of the FadA structure and function will advance our understanding of the colonization mechanism of this opportunistic pathogen in the host and help identify therapeutic targets for prevention and treatment of infections associated with this organism.

https://openalex.org/W2056581537,"In this study we present evidence that residue Val282 in the S6 transmembrane segment of the calcium-activated KCa3.1 channel constitutes a key determinant of channel gating. A Gly scan of the S6 transmembrane segment first revealed that the substitutions A279G and V282G cause the channel to become constitutively active in zero Ca2+. Constitutive activity was not observed when residues extending from Cys276 to Ala286, other than Ala279 and Val282, were substituted to Gly. The accessibility of Cys engineered at Val275 deep in the channel cavity was next investigated for the ion-conducting V275C/V282G mutant and closed V275C channel in zero Ca2+ using Ag+ as probe. These experiments demonstrated that internal Ag+ ions have free access to the channel cavity independently of the channel conducting state, arguing against an activation gate located at the S6 segment C-terminal end. Experiments were also conducted where Val282 was substituted by residues differing in size and/or hydrophobicity. We found a strong correlation between constitutive activity in zero Ca2+ and the hydrophobic energy for side chain burial. Single channel recordings showed finally that constitutive activation in zero Ca2+ is better explained by a model where the channel is locked in a low conducting state with a high open probability rather than resulting from a change in the open/closed energy balance that would favor channel openings to a full conducting state in the absence of Ca2+. We conclude that hydrophobic interactions involving Val282 constitute key determinants to KCa3.1 gating by modulating the ion conducting state of the selectivity filter through an effect on the S6 transmembrane segment.

The voltage-insensitive calcium-activated K+ channel of intermediate conductance KCa3.1 is now emerging as a therapeutic target for a large variety of health disorders such as auto-immune diseases, vascular inflammation, and cancer (1Chou C.C.

Increasing evidence also supports a prominent role of KCa3.1 in respiratory diseases such as allergic asthma (8Cruse G. Duffy S.M. Brightling C.E. Bradding P. Thorax. 2006; 61: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and airway obstruction coming from tissues remodeling (8Cruse G. Duffy S.M. Brightling C.E. Bradding P.

These data add to the compelling observations that KCa3.1 is important for fluid secretion in epithelial cells by maintaining an electrochemical gradient favorable to Cl- and Na+ transepithelial transport. K+ channel openers may in fact constitute novel therapeutic agents to correct fluid secretion in epithelia presenting fluid secretion defects such as in cystic fibrosis (10Singh S. Syme C.A. Singh A.K. Devor D.C. Bridges R.J. Lambert L.C. DeLuca A. Frizzell R.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 296: 600-611Google Scholar). The crystal structure of KCa3.1 has not yet been solved. Knowledge of the channel key structural features is, however, essential for a molecular description of drug/channel interactions. KCa3.1 is a tetrameric protein with each subunit comprising 427 amino acids organized in six transmembrane segments (S1–S6) with a pore motif between segments 5 (S5) and 6 (S6). In contrast to the maxi-KCa (KCa1.1), the KCa3.1 Ca2+ sensitivity is conferred by the Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin (CaM), 2The abbreviations used are: CaM, calmodulin; MTSEA+, methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium; MTSET+, methanethiosulfonate ethyltrimethylammonium; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; r, rat; CAG, Ca2+-activated gate; pS, picosiemens. with the CaM C-lobe constitutively bound to a domain in the membrane-proximal region of the intracellular C terminus of the channel (11Maylie J. Bond C.T. Herson P.S. Lee W.S. Adelman J.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 554: 255-261Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). CaM also regulates KCa3.1 channel assembly and trafficking and as such represents an essential accessory protein for proper KCa3.1 functioning (12Joiner W.J. Khanna R. Schlichter L.C. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37980-37985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous study, we presented evidence that the KCa3.1 channel closed configuration cannot be accounted for by a KcsA-like structure (13Klein H. Garneau L. Banderali U. Simoes M. Parent L. Sauvá R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 129: 299-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This conclusion followed from the observation that the small positively charged reagents MTSEA+, EtHg+, and Ag+ were accessible to cysteine residues engineered deep inside the channel central cavity with the channel in the closed configuration. In contrast, larger molecules such as the MTS reagent MTSET+ (5.8 Å diameter) showed a 103–104-fold difference in accessibility between the channel closed and open configurations (13Klein H. Garneau L. Banderali U. Simoes M. Parent L. Sauvá R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 129: 299-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It was concluded that the bundle crossing region, predicted on the basis of the KcsA structure to be located at the C-terminal end of the S6 transmembrane segments, cannot form a tight seal impermeable to K+ ions when KCa3.1 is in the closed configuration. This proposal is in line with the cysteine-scanning mutagenesis data from cyclic nucleotide-gated channels suggesting that the inner helices may form a constriction at the C-terminal end of the channel pore, tight enough to restrict the accessibility of reagents larger than K+ to the channel cavity, but nonobstructive to K+ ion flow (14Flynn G.E. Zagotta W.N. Neuron. 2001; 30: 689-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 15Flynn G.E. Zagotta W.N. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 563-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Xiao J. Zhen X.G. Yang J. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As a result, it was concluded that the main channel gate would be located at or close to the selectivity filter. Similar conclusions supported by SCAM data were derived from studies performed on the KCa2.2 and Kir2.1 channels (16Xiao J. Zhen X.G. Yang J. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 17Bruening-Wright A. Schumacher M.A. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6499-6506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the binding of Ca2+ to the KCa3.1-CaM complex leads to the opening of the channel gate is currently unknown. On the basis of the crystal structure of the C-terminal region of the Ca2+-CaM gated rSK2 (KCa2.2) channel, it was proposed that the binding of Ca2+ to the N-lobes of CaM causes the formation of a dimeric complex between two adjacent calmodulin binding domains while initiating a rotation of the S6 helices leading to the opening of the channel pore (18Schumacher M.A. Rivard A.F. Bachinger H.P. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 19Schumacher M.A. Crum M. Miller M.C. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 849-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism could prevail for KCa3.1. Clearly, this mechanism would rely on the structural properties of the S6 transmembrane segments. In this study, we examine through Gly scan analysis the functional coupling between the S6 transmembrane segment down from the highly conserved Gly hinge at position 274 and the channel gating process. Our results show that the transition of KCa3.1 to a closed configuration in zero Ca2+ is governed by the hydrophobic energy in side chain residue burial at Val282, so that substituting Val282 into less hydrophobic residues results in channels that are constitutively active in zero Ca2+. Val282 therefore constitutes a key determinant to the KCa3.1 gating process while being an important target for KCa3.1 potentiators. Cloning, Sequencing, and Site-directed Mutagenesis of the KCa3.1 Channel—KCa3.1 channel cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR from HeLa cells as described previously (20Simoes M. Garneau L. Klein H. Banderali U. Hobeila F. Roux B. Parent L. Sauve R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 99-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The rat (r) SK2 (KCa2.2) clone was kindly supplied by Dr. Daniel C. Devor (University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA), amplified, and subcloned into pMT21 as described previously (20Simoes M. Garneau L. Klein H. Banderali U. Hobeila F. Roux B. Parent L. Sauve R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 99-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the KCa3.1 and rSK2 channels was performed using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as described elsewhere (21Banderali U. Klein H. Garneau L. Simoes M. Parent L. Sauvá R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 333-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Oocytes—The procedure for oocytes preparation was carried out as described previously (20Simoes M. Garneau L. Klein H. Banderali U. Hobeila F. Roux B. Parent L. Sauve R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 99-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Oocytes were patched 3–5 days after coinjection of 0.1–1 ng of the cDNA coding for the channel cloned into pMT21 plus 1 ng of cDNA coding for a green fluorescent protein also cloned into pMT21. The latter was used as a marker for nuclear injection. Before patch clamping, the defolliculated oocyte was briefly incubated in a hyperosmotic solution containing (in mm) 250 KCl, 1 MgSO4, 1 EGTA, 50 sucrose, and 10 HEPES buffered at pH 7.4 with KOH, and the vitelline membrane was peeled off using fine forceps. The oocyte was then transferred to a superfusion chamber for patch clamp measurements. Solutions—The bath and patch pipette solutions contained (in mm) 200 K2SO4, 1.8 MgCl2, 0.025 CaCl2, 25 HEPES, buffered at pH 7.4 with KOH. Sulfate salts were used to minimize the contamination from endogenous Ca2+-dependent chloride channels while enabling chelation of contaminant divalent cations such as Ba2+. Calcium-free solutions were prepared by adding 1–10 mm EGTA to 200 mm K2SO4 solutions with no CaCl2. The resulting Ca2+-free concentrations were calculated using the EQCAL software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK) assuming a contaminant Ca2+ concentration of the order of 5 μm. MTSEA+ and MTSET+ (Toronto Research Chemicals Inc., Toronto, Ontario, Canada) were added directly into the bath solution just before application. In experiments where Ba2+ was used as blocking agent, the pipette solution contained (in mm) 198 NaCl, 2 KCl, 0.5 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, 25 HEPES, buffered at pH 7.3 with NaOH. The bath solution was prepared with (in mm) 200 KCl, 0.5 MgCl2, 25 HEPES, buffered at pH 7.3 (KOH), and contained either 5 mm EGTA or 25 μm CaCl2. Ag+ solutions were prepared by adding AgNO3 to a Cl--free 150 mm KOH solution that contained 60 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES with no CaCl2 and MgCl2 at pH 7.35 (KOH). The resulting Ag+-free concentration was calculated using the EQCAL software as described before. For Ag+ experiments, the pipette solution contained 150 mm KOH, 1.8 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 25 μm CaCl2 at pH 7.3 (MES). Bath solution changes were performed as described previously using a RSC-160 rapid solution changer system (BioLogic, Grenoble, France) (21Banderali U. Klein H. Garneau L. Simoes M. Parent L. Sauvá R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 333-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The solution exchange time was less than 20 ms. Patch Clamp Recordings—Multiple and single channel inside-out recordings were carried out using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate capillaries using a Narishige pipette puller (model PP-83) and used uncoated. The resistance of the patch electrodes ranged from 2 to 5 megohms. Data acquisition was performed using a Digidata 1320A acquisition system (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at a sampling rate of 2.0 kHz with filtering at 500 Hz unless mentioned. In some single channel experiments, filtering was set at 5 kHz and sampling adjusted to 10 kHz. Experiments were performed at room temperature. Single channel analysis was carried out using the QUB package (22Qin F. Auerbach A. Sachs F. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 264-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 23Qin F. Auerbach A. Sachs F. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1997; 264: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Dwell time analysis were performed on data that were idealized according to the segmental K means method based on a hidden Markov model type analysis. Homology Modeling—Structural model of the closed KCa3.1 channel was generated by homology modeling using the closed Kv1.2 structure proposed by Pathak et al. (24Pathak M.M. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Agarwal G. Roux B. Barth P. Kohout S. Tombola F. Isacoff E.Y. Neuron. 2007; 56: 124-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) as template. Sequence alignments were performed with RAPTOR (Bioinformatics Solutions Inc., Waterloo, Ontario, Canada) and SAMT06 servers. 100 models were originally generated with Modeler9 version 1 where the distances between opposite S6 transmembrane helices at Val282 were constrained to yield a van der Waals pore diameter between 4.8 and 5.8 Å in accordance with our SCAM results on the closed KCa3.1 channel (13Klein H. Garneau L. Banderali U. Simoes M. Parent L. Sauvá R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 129: 299-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The model with the lowest objective function was used for structural analysis. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was analyzed using unpaired Student’s t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data are expressed as means ± S.D. A279G and V282G Mutations Result in Constitutively Active Channels—Fig. 1 illustrates a three-dimensional model of the pore region of KCa3.1 obtained by homology modeling using the closed Kv1.2 channel structure proposed by Pathak et al. (24Pathak M.M. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Agarwal G. Roux B. Barth P. Kohout S. Tombola F. Isacoff E.Y. Neuron. 2007; 56: 124-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) as template. The model predicts that the residues Val275, Thr278, Ala279, Val282, and Ala286 should be lining the channel pore (blue in Fig. 1) with residues Cys276, Cys277, Leu280, and Leu281 oriented opposite to the pore lumen. Importantly, Val275 is presented as being located facing the channel central cavity at the proximity of the selectivity filter. In the closed configuration, the van der Waals pore diameter was estimated at 5 and 6.4 Å at Val282 and Ala286, respectively, in accordance with our previous Cys accessibility measurements (13Klein H. Garneau L. Banderali U. Simoes M. Parent L. Sauvá R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 129: 299-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To determine to what extent the conformational state of S6 constitutes a key factor to the KCa3.1 gating process, a series of experiments was first undertaken in which the residues extending from Val275 to Ala286 were individually mutated into Gly. A destabilization of the S6 α-chain is expected under these conditions as the small side chain of Gly (a single H) allows freedom of rotation around the φ and Ψ dihedral angles of amino acids resulting in backbone conformations not sterically tolerated by other amino acids (25Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 345-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). Residue substitutions to Gly along S6 were carried out using the V275C mutant channel as template because this mutant can be specifically blocked through the irreversible binding of sulfhydryl reagents such as MTSEA+ or MTSET+ as shown previously (13Klein H. Garneau L. Banderali U. Simoes M. Parent L. Sauvá R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 129: 299-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The results of these experiments are presented in Figs. 2, 3, 4. As seen in Fig. 2A, the internal application of MTSEA+ (1 mm) onto the V275C channel in 25 μm Ca2+ conditions resulted in a gradual current block reaching the current level, I0, corresponding to the current value measured in EGTA (zero Ca2+) conditions (13Klein H. Garneau L. Banderali U. Simoes M. Parent L. Sauvá R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 129: 299-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Simoes M. Garneau L. Klein H. Banderali U. Hobeila F. Roux B. Parent L. Sauve R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 99-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Identical experiments carried out with the V275C/A279G (Fig. 2B) and V275C/V282G (Fig. 2C) double mutants showed in contrast a strong MTSEA+-dependent inhibition of the inward currents to a final current value (I0) distinct from the current level (IEGTA) initially measured in the presence of EGTA. Increasing the EGTA concentration up to 10 mm did not result in a further inhibition of IEGTA, demonstrating that both channels were truly active at [Ca2+]i <10-11 m (data not shown). The most notable effects were observed with the V275C/V282G mutant, with a greater channel activity in zero than in saturating Ca2+ (25 μm) conditions. Constitutive activity was not observed when residues extending from Cys276 to Ala286, other than Ala279 and Val282, were substituted to Gly, including the Ala286 residue which, just like Ala279 and Val282, is predicted to be facing the channel pore (Figs. 1 and 2D). Control experiments were also performed to determine whether constitutive activation was dependent on the mutation V275C. In these experiments, internal Ba2+ was used as a blocking agent to determine the zero current level. The current recording illustrated in Fig. 3A shows that Ba2+ applied internally onto the V282G channel in asymmetrical 2 mm KCl (pipette), 200 mm KCl (bath) conditions at Vm = 0 mV resulted in a strong inhibition of the outward currents, reaching the current level, I0, distinct from the outward current level measured in zero Ca2+ (IEGTA). In addition, this recording demonstrates that the V282G mutant is insensitive to MTSEA, arguing for the endogenous Cys267, Cys269, Cys276, and Cys277 along S6 not contributing to the MTSEA-induced current inhibition measured with the V275C/V282G mutant channel (Fig. 2C). These experiments clearly confirm first that the constitutive activation of the V275C/V282G mutant is not related to the presence of Cys275, and second that constitutive activation is not resulting from the creation of a conduction pathway distinct from the channel pore. Fig. 3B shows the results obtained with the rSK2 channel where Ala384 (equivalent to Val275 in KCa3.1) and Val391 (equivalent to Val282 in KCa3.1) were mutated into Cys and Gly, respectively. The amino acid composition of the S6 transmembrane segments of the rSK2 channel is 75% identical to KCa3.1, the major difference being at the level of the Gly hinge at 274 with 274GVC276 in KCa3.1 corresponding to 383GAG385 in rSK2. As seen in Fig. 3B, the substitution into a Gly of the residue in rSK2 equivalent to Val282 in KCa3.1 led to channels that were constitutively active, suggesting that the gating properties of rSK2 and KCa3.1 critically depend on the nature of the residue at this position, despite a Gly hinge region expected to be far less flexible in KCa3.1 relative to rSK2. The results obtained with the KCa3.1 double mutant channels are summarized in Fig. 4A, where the ratio of the current measured in zero Ca2+ (IEGTA) to the current measured at saturating 25 μm Ca2+ (ICa) is plotted for the various Gly positions along S6 down from the conserved Gly274 hinge. As illustrated, ion conduction in the absence of Ca2+ was exclusively observed with the V275C/A279G and V275C/V282G mutants, the latter leading to a ratio close to 1. The state of the V275C/T278G mutant could not be established, however, as this mutant failed to generate detectable currents in Xenopus oocytes.FIGURE 2Glycine scan along the S6 segment below the Gly hinge at position 274. Inside-out recordings of inward currents illustrating the effect of MTSEA+ on the channel mutants. Recordings were obtained in symmetrical 200 mm K2SO4 conditions at Vm = -60 mV. The symbol ICa refers to the current level in 25 μm Ca2+, IEGTA, to the current level in 1 mm EGTA and I0 to the current level following inhibition by MTSEA+. Under these experimental conditions, Ca2+-activated K + currents are represented as inwardly directed currents relative to the zero current level I0. A, internal application of MTSEA+ (1 mm) in 25 μm Ca2+ on the control V275C channel mutant caused channel inhibition to a current level (I0) corresponding to the current level measured in zero Ca2+ (EGTA) conditions. B and C, A279G and V282G mutations resulted in channels where the current level (I0) measured following current inhibition by internal MTSEA+ (1 mm) was not equal to the level (IEGTA) recorded in zero Ca2+, indicating that the channels were ion conducting in the absence of Ca2+. D, constitutive activation was not seen with the V275C/A286G mutant, although Ala286 is facing the channel pore just like Ala279 and Val282.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3A, control inside-out recording of outward currents demonstrating that the V275C mutation is not required for constitutive activation. Experiments were performed with the V282G mutant in asymmetrical K+ conditions with 2 mm KCl + 198 mm NaCl in the pipette and 200 mm KCl in the bath (SO4 solutions could not be used as the maximum free Ba2+ concentration is 0.5 nm in 200 mm K2SO4). The voltage was maintained at 0 mV throughout to minimize the contribution coming from endogenous chloride currents. Under theses conditions, Ca2+-activated K+ currents are represented as outwardly directed currents relative to the zero current level I0. As seen, the zero current level obtained by addition of Ba2+ (10 mm) to the internal medium (I0) does not correspond to the outward current level measured in EGTA (IEGTA) confirming that the V282G channel was ion conducting in zero Ca2+. Furthermore, internal MTSEA+ application failed in this case to cause channel inhibition, arguing against an interaction of MTSEA+ with endogenous Cys residues. B, inside-out current recording of inward currents demonstrating that mutating the residue Val391 in rSK2 (KCa2.2) equivalent to Val282 in KCa3.1 also results in a channel that is constitutively active. Measurements were performed in symmetrical 200 mm K2SO4 conditions at Vm = -60 mV. Ca2+-activated K + currents are represented as inwardly directed currents relative to the zero current level I0. As observed with the V275C/V282G mutant, exposure of the A384C/V391G channel to MTSEA+ (1 mm) in zero Ca2+ (EGTA) caused a strong inward current inhibition to a current level I0 distinct from the current level measured in zero Ca2+ (IEGTA).

The symbols ICa, and IEGTA are defined as in Fig. 2. Zero current was taken as the current level obtained following inhibition by MTSEA+ (1 mm). Mutations that failed to cause constitutive activation are represented by an asterisk and corresponded to IEGTA/ICa = 0. Mutants for which no channel activity could be detected are identified by two asterisks. The results presented in A show that constitutive activity is site-specific, being observed following the substitution of the Ala279 and Val282 residues only. Also included in B is the effect of the V391G substitution (equivalent to V282G in KCa3.1) observed on the rSK2 channel (KCa2.2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Are the Constitutively Active Channels Equivalent to the Open KCa3.1?—To determine whether the pore structure of constitutively active channels in zero Ca2+ showed features associated more to the open than closed KCa3.1 channel configuration, experiments were undertaken where the accessibility of cysteines engineered at position 275 to the sulfhydryl reagents Ag+, MTSEA+, and MTSET+ was measured for the V275C/A279G and/or V275C/V282G mutants with or without Ca2+. Fig. 5 shows representative current traces illustrating the time-dependent inhibition by MTSEA+ of the V275C/A279G and V275C/V282G mutants measured in zero Ca2+ with V275C as control. Results obtained with the V275C/A286G mutant are also included to illustrate the effect of MTSEA+ on a nonconstitutively active channel, despite Ala286 facing the channel pore. These experiments were performed in symmetrical 200 mm K2SO4 conditions at Vm = -60 mV. As reported previously, the repetitive pulse application of MTSEA+ onto the V275C channel in zero Ca2+ (EGTA) caused a gradual decrease of the test inward current amplitude measured in 25 μm internal Ca2+ for a modification rate estimated at 107 ± 38 m-1 s-1 (n = 14) (Fig. 5A). These experiments also show that the current level I0 was not affected by the cumulative application of MTSEA+ (I0 = IEGTA) confirming that the V275C channel is not ion conducting in the absence of Ca2+. In contrast, the internal MTSEA+ application onto the V275C/A279G or V275C/V282G channels in zero Ca2+ (Fig. 5, B and C) caused an inhibition of the inward currents from current level IEGTA to I0, providing direct evidence that both channels were ion conducting in the absence of Ca2+. In both recordings, the time course of the MTSEA+-induced current inhibition could be fitted to a single exponential for modification rates of 297 ± 5 m-1 s-1 (V275C/A279G, n = 3) and 100 ± 15 m-1 s-1 (V275C/V282G, n = 13), respectively. The continuous application of MTSEA+ onto the V275C/A286G mutant in Ca2+ free conditions (Fig. 5D) did not result in a detectable current inhibition (I0 = IEGTA) confirming that V275C/A286G is not constitutively active. Furthermore, the absence of inhibition in this case cannot be attributed to cysteines at position 275 not being accessible to MTSEA+ for the V275C/A286G mutant, because the subsequent addition of Ca2"

We report here a novel mechanism, other than conventional calcium channels or the phopholipase C-inositol trisphosphate system, for initiating calcium oscillation downstream of integrin signaling. Upon integrin αIIbβ3 binding to fibrinogen ligand or the disintegrin rhodostomin, sodium-proton exchanger NHE1 and sodium-calcium exchanger NCX1 are actively transported to the plasma membrane, and they become physically coupled to integrin αIIbβ3. Lipid raft-dependent mechanisms modulate the membrane targeting and formation of the NHE1-integrin αIIbβ3-NCX1 protein complex. NHE1 and NCX1 within such protein complex are functionally coupled, such that a local increase of sodium concentration caused by NHE1 can drive NCX1 to generate sodium efflux in exchange for calcium influx. The resulting calcium increase inside the cell can then trigger CICR as a prelude to calcium oscillation downstream of integrin αIIbβ3 signaling. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer based on fluorescence lifetime measurements is employed here to monitor the intermolecular interactions among NHE1-integrin αIIbβ3-NCX1, which could not be properly detected using conventional biochemical assays.

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer based on fluorescence lifetime measurements is employed here to monitor the intermolecular interactions among NHE1-integrin αIIbβ3-NCX1, which could not be properly detected using conventional biochemical assays. In many excitable or nonexcitable cells, the concentration of free intracellular calcium oscillates with a period ranging from a few seconds to a few minutes. Such calcium oscillations are involved in a wide variety of cellular functions (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2000; 1: 11-21Google Scholar, 2Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2003; 4: 517-529Google Scholar). It is generally believed that, except for minor variations, the cyclic increase and decrease of calcium results from an autocatalytic release of calcium in a process called calcium-induced calcium release (CICR), 2The abbreviations used are: CICR, calcium-induced calcium release; CHO αIIbβ3, Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing exogenous human integrin αIIb and integrin β3; Fg, fibrinogen; rho, rhodostomin; PLL, poly-L-lysine; Tg, thapsigargin; EIPA, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride; MβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; PLC, phopholipase C; IP3, inositol trisphosphate; FLIM, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; TIRFM, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy; GFP, green fluorescent protein; mRFP, monomeric red fluorescent protein; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; DRM, detergent-resistant membrane. followed by a slow negative feedback that terminates calcium release. The cytoplasmic free calcium is then taken up into the organelles to reset the cycle. Despite a general agreement on how calcium oscillation proceeds once the system has been turned on, various different mechanisms have been proposed to explain how the initial calcium mobilization is generated that triggers CICR. As a general rule, calcium entry through voltage-gated channels in electrically excitable cells (3Wang S.Q. Song L.S. Lakatta E.G. Cheng H. Nature.. 2001; 410: 592-596Google Scholar) or through agonist-receptor interactions in nonexcitable cells, such as epithelial cells, hepatocytes, or oocytes (4Boitano S. Dirksen E.R. Sanderson M.J. Science.. 1992; 258: 292-295Google Scholar), is thought to initiate the CICR process (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2000; 1: 11-21Google Scholar, 2Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2003; 4: 517-529Google Scholar). Typically, in nonexcitable cells, the binding of an agonist, such as a hormone, a growth factor, or an extracellular matrix, to the corresponding cell surface receptor initiates a series of reactions that end in the activation of phopholipase C (PLC) and the production of the secondary messenger inositol trisphosphate (IP3) (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2000; 1: 11-21Google Scholar, 2Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2003; 4: 517-529Google Scholar, 4Boitano S. Dirksen E.R. Sanderson M.J. Science.. 1992; 258: 292-295Google Scholar). IP3 is thought to induce calcium release from the internal endoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria store, and governs the CICR mechanisms that modulate calcium oscillations (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2000; 1: 11-21Google Scholar, 2Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2003; 4: 517-529Google Scholar, 4Boitano S. Dirksen E.R. Sanderson M.J. Science.. 1992; 258: 292-295Google Scholar). However, not all calcium oscillations found in nonexcitable cells are initiated by the PLC-IP3 pathway (5Elliott A.C. Cell Calcium.. 2001; 30: 73-93Google Scholar). We report here a novel pathway whereby ion exchangers NHE1 and NCX1, by interacting with integrin αIIbβ3, can play an active role in mobilizing intracellular calcium that triggers calcium oscillation. Integrin αIIbβ3 is the most abundant membrane protein found in platelets (6Kieffer N. Phillips D.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol.. 1990; 6: 329-357Google Scholar). Many functions of platelet are mediated by integrin αIIbβ3 (7Phillips D.R. Charo I.F. Scarborough R.M. Cell.. 1991; 65: 359-362Google Scholar, 8Jackson S.P. Blood.. 2007; 109: 5087-5095Google Scholar), and these are tightly associated with the control of intracellular calcium concentrations (9Jackson S.P. Nesbitt W.S. Kulkarni S. J. Thromb. Haemost.. 2003; 1: 1602-1612Google Scholar). Binding of integrin αIIbβ3 with plasma fibrinogen (Fg) or von Willebrand factor, for example, elicits a complicated series of calcium events, including calcium oscillations, which modulate both the inside-out and outside-in signaling pathways and regulate platelet thrombus formation (9Jackson S.P. Nesbitt W.S. Kulkarni S. J. Thromb. Haemost.. 2003; 1: 1602-1612Google Scholar). Calcium oscillations could also be induced in human platelets by plating the cells on a substrate coated with Fg or rhodostomin (rho), a disintegrin protein isolated from snake venom (10Jen C.J. Chen H.I. Lai K.C. Usami S. Blood.. 1996; 87: 3775-3782Google Scholar, 11Chang H.H. Lin C.H. Lo S.J. Exp. Cell Res.. 1999; 250: 387-400Google Scholar). Like platelets, Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing exogenous integrin αIIbβ3 on their plasma membrane (CHO αIIbβ3) also exhibit active calcium oscillations when plated on substrates coated with Fg or rho (12Ylanne J. Chen Y. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Takada Y. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol.. 1993; 122: 223-233Google Scholar). Using CHOαIIbβ3 cells as an experimental model, we report here that calcium oscillations downstream of integrin αIIbβ3 signaling could be readily triggered by the combined function of two ionic exchangers, the sodium-proton exchanger NHE1 and the sodium-calcium exchanger NCX1, which are actively recruited from intracellular vesicles to plasma membranes and form molecular complexes with integrin αIIbβ3 by a lipid microdomain- or lipid raft-dependent mechanism. Cell Models, Preparation of Substrates, and Pharmacological Treatments—The CHO αIIbβ3 cell line and human integrin β3 cDNA was a gift from Dr. M. H. Ginsberg (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Purifications of recombinant rho and isolations of human platelets from volunteers were as described previously (11Chang H.H. Lin C.H. Lo S.J. Exp. Cell Res.. 1999; 250: 387-400Google Scholar). The fluorescently labeled proteins were made by using pDNR-Dual donor vector that contained gene constructs of interest and acceptor vector (pLP-AcGFP1-C or pLP-AcmRFP1-C) that contained fluorescence protein tags (BD Biosciences Clontech). A donor vector encoding an mRFP gene (13Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2002; 99: 7877-7882Google Scholar) (pLP-AcmRFP1-C) was constructed in the laboratory by replacing the GFP gene in pLP-AcGFP1-C with mRFP. Gene transfection was done using Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's protocol. To prepare cell growth substrates, coverglasses or 5-μm beads were incubated with Fg, rho, or poly-l-lysine (PLL) at 4 × 10-7m for 90 min at room temperature, washed with PBS three times to remove the excessive protein, and then back-coated with 5% bovine serum albumin. The substrates were prepared freshly before the experiments. Human Fg, PLL, bovine serum albumin, EGTA, EIPA, bepridil, and methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) were purchased from Sigma. Fluo-4 and Sodium Green dye were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Thapsigargan (Tg), BAPTA-AM, U-73122, U-73343, xestospongin C, KBR7943, genistein, calphostin C, and nocodazole were obtained from Calbiochem. Immunofluorescence Staining—Immunofluorescence staining was done according to the methods described previously (14Hsieh C.F. Chang B.J. Pai C.H. Chen H.Y. Tsai J.W. Yi Y.H. Chiang Y.T. Wang D.W. Chi S. Hsu L. Lin C.H. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 25466-25474Google Scholar, 15Lian W.N. Wu T.W. Dao R.L. Chen Y.J. Lin C.H. J. Cell Sci.. 2006; 119: 11-22Google Scholar). Antibody probes and concentrations used in this study included antibodies made against integrin αIIb (1:200) (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), NHE-1 (1:100), NCX-1 (1:100), CD45 (1:100) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and calveolin-1 (1:200) (Sigma). The fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA) were used at a dilution of 1:300. Ganglioside GM1 staining was done using biotin-conjugated cholera toxin B (1:100) (Sigma), followed by Cy5-conjugated streptavidin (1:200) (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). All stained samples were observed under confocal microscopy (TCS-SP5; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Live Cell Imaging—For calcium/sodium imaging, suspended cells were labeled either with 2 μm Fluo-4 or with 2 μm Sodium Green (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 10 min before cell plating and observed under time lapse fluorescence microscopy (16Lin C.H. Thompson C.A. Forscher P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol.. 1994; 4: 640-647Google Scholar, 17Lian W.N. Tsai J.W. Yu P.M. Wu T.W. Yang S.C. Chau Y.P. Lin C.H. Hepatology.. 1999; 30: 748-760Google Scholar). Fluorescence signals were quantified by MetaMorph program (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). In Fig. 1, a and c, -fold changes of intracellular calcium/sodium concentration were calculated by dividing the fluorescence intensity taken over time (Fn) with reference fluorescence intensity taken at 10 min after cell plating (F10). In Fig. 1d, fluorescence intensity taken at 40 min (F40) was divided by F10. The cell showing calcium oscillation was defined by having more than one calcium transient within a 10-min observation period. TIRFM was performed using an Olympus system, equipped with a single mode TIRF fiber illuminator and a numerical aperture 1.45 objective lens. The images were acquired by a highly sensitive charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu Photonics KK ORCA ER) controlled by the Aqua Cosmos program (Hamamatsu Photonics KK). For live cell imaging, a climate chamber was used to maintain cell viability and activity. FLIM-FRET—For FLIM-FRET measurements done in fixed cells, immunofluorescence staining was performed using fluorescein isothiocyanate and TRITC fluorochrome as FRET donor and acceptor, respectively. For live cell FLIM-FRET experiments, proteins of interest were conjugated with GFP or mRFP as a FRET pair was applied. The FLIM-FRET platform was constructed in the laboratory, as described previously (18Ghukasyan V. Hsu Y.Y. Kung S.H. Kao F.J. J. Biomed. Opt.. 2007; 12: 024016Google Scholar). Briefly, time-correlated single photon counting was built on a modified two-photon laser-scanning microscope (Olympus FV300). Two-photon fluorescence was excited using an 800-nm mode-locked femtosecond laser (Mira F-900; Coherent Inc., Palo Alto, CA) that operated at 76 MHz. Fluorescence emission was detected using a photon-counting photomultiplier (H7422P-40; Hamamatsu Photonics KK) and SPC-830 PC board (Becker & Hickl GmbH, Berlin, Germany). Images were taken at 256 × 256 pixel resolution. Data analysis via model function fitting, along with the instrument response function deconvolution and color-coding was conducted by SPCImage version 2.8 software package (Becker & Hickl). In Fig. 3e, the histogram of all image pixels was plotted as a function of fluorescence lifetime value and smoothed by the Sabitzky-Golay algorithm to approximate a normal distribution (upper panel), from which mean and S.D. were quantified (Fig. 3e, lower panel, and Fig. 4c).FIGURE 4Binding to rho by integrin αIIbβ3 on the cell membrane triggered integrin-NHE1 coupling in the intracellular vesicles. a, FRET was recorded when a CHO αIIbβ3 cell expressing NHE1-GFP and integrin β3-mRFP as FRET pair was held in contact with a rho bead (asterisk). In donor-only control, the FRET acceptor was omitted. FLIM images were captured at the time points indicated. Note the progressive increase of punctate areas inside the cell whose lifetime values were significantly reduced and color-coded in yellow/red. b, the same setting as in a, but the cells were pretreated with 200 μm genistein (Gns), 200 μm LY294002, 250 nm calphostin C (Cal C), 3 μm Tg, 500 nm nocodazole (Noc), or 20 μm MβCD for 10 min before interacting with the rho bead.

Lincz L.F. Meldrum C.J. Burns G.F. Biochem. J.. 1996; 319: 67-72Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, CHO αIIbβ3 cells were plated on different substrates as indicated at 37 °C for 20 min, lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% protease inhibitor cocktail, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100) at 4 °C for 4 h. A 10-60% continuous sucrose gradient was used to fractionate total cell lysate into 13 fractions, collected from the top. The cholesterol content within each fraction was analyzed by the Amplex Red cholesterol assay kit (Molecular Probes). The protein content within each fraction was first precipitated with 10% tricholoroacetic acid and then analyzed by 6.5% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, using 1:1000 anti-integrin αIIb, 1:1000 anti-NHE-1 (Chemicon), and 1:500 anti-NCX-1 (Swant, Bellinzona, Switzerland) as primary antibodies, followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce). Net Calcium Influxes Generated by Combined NHE1-NCX1 Effects Induced Calcium Oscillations in CHO αIIbβ3 Cells Grown on Fibrinogen/Rhodostomin Substrates—CHO αIIbβ3 cells adhered strongly to the surface coated with Fg (12Ylanne J. Chen Y. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Takada Y. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol.. 1993; 122: 223-233Google Scholar) or the disintegrin rho (supplemental Fig. 1a). The interactions between integrin αIIbβ3 and such ligands could further induce cell spreading (supplemental Fig. 1, b and c, and supplemental Movie 1), which coincided with the occurrence of intracellular calcium oscillations that started at ∼10 min after plating CHO αIIbβ3 cells on a substratum coated with either Fg or rho (Fig. 1a and supplemental Movie 2); growing CHO αIIbβ3 cells on the control PLL-coated substrate, on the other hand, did not result in any noticeable calcium transient. More than 60% of the adherent CHO αIIbβ3 and human platelet cells on Fg/rho substrates exhibited calcium oscillations (Fig. 1b, open bars). Treating these cells with calcium-free medium, Tg, or BAPTA-AM effectively inhibited calcium oscillation (Fig. 1b, gray and black bars), suggesting that both extracellular and intracellular calcium pool participated in the calcium oscillation triggered by Fg/rho. Interestingly, inhibition of calcium mobilization through the conventional PLC-IP3 pathway by U73122 or xestospongin C only partially inhibited the calcium oscillations triggered by Fg/rho (Fig. 1b, dark blue and purple bars), whereas control homolog U73343 had no obvious effect (Fig. 1b, light blue bars). Also, Goncalves et al. (20Goncalves I. Hughan S.C. Schoenwaelder S.M. Yap C.L. Yuan Y. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem.. 2003; 278: 34812-34822Google Scholar) had previously reported that platelets isolated from PLC knock-out mice still exhibited calcium oscillation when triggered by Fg, despite having a delayed onset. Taken together, these findings suggested the presence of additional pathway(s), other than PLC, that might be involved in triggering the calcium oscillations downstream of integrin αIIbβ3. To delineate the putative alternative pathway, we noticed that NHE1 and NCX1 have been reported to be involved in calcium mobilization of platelet (21Siffert W. Akkerman J.W. Nature.. 1987; 325: 456-458Google Scholar, 22Roberts D.E. McNicol A. Bose R. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 19421-19430Google Scholar) and activation of platelets (or inside-out signaling) (23Siffert W. Akkerman J.W. Trends Biochem. Sci.. 1988; 13: 148-151Google Scholar, 24Shiraga M. Tomiyama Y. Honda S. Suzuki H. Kosugi S. Tadokoro S. Kanakura Y. Tanoue K. Kurata Y. Matsuzawa Y. Blood.. 1998; 92: 3710-3720Google Scholar, 25Rosskopf D. J. Thromb. Thrombolysis.. 1999; 8: 15-24Google Scholar). In our system, treating CHO αIIbβ3 cells with bepridil and KB R7943, which inhibited the function of sodium-calcium exchanger NCX1 could effectively inhibit the calcium oscillation induced by Fg or rho substrates (Fig. 1b, red bars). NCX1 could potentially generate a local increase of calcium (to trigger CICR) by operating in a “reverse” mode, using sodium efflux in exchange for calcium influx (26Liu P.S. Kao L.S. Cell Calcium.. 1990; 11: 573-579Google Scholar). The question then was how the high local sodium concentration was generated that drove NCX1 in the reverse mode. Indeed, treating CHO αIIbβ3 cells grown on Fg or rho substrates with bepridil did cause a progressive increase of sodium (Fig. 1, c and d, and supplemental Movie 3) and cell swelling as more water flowed inside the cell (Fig. 1e). We noticed that the sodium increase and cell swelling caused by bepridil could be reversed by co-treating the cells with EIPA that perturbed the function of sodium-proton exchanger NHE1 (Fig. 1, c-e). Furthermore, EIPA treatment alone also prevented calcium oscillation (Fig. 1b, pink bars). These results suggested that NHE1 could use proton efflux in exchange for sodium influx; the neighboring NCX1 could then take the local high sodium to drive calcium influx that triggered CICR and calcium oscillation (27Borle A.B. Bender C. Am. J. Physiol.. 1991; 261: C482-C489Google Scholar, 28Gillespie J.I. Otun H. Greenwell J.R. Dunlop W. Exp. Physiol.. 1992; 77: 141-152Google Scholar, 29Thomas M.J. Sjaastad I. Andersen K.

Such combined NHE1-NCX1 activity appeared to also function in human platelets, since either EIPA or bepridil could effectively inhibit calcium oscillation induced by the cells' binding to Fg (Fig. 1b). Targeting of NHE1-NCX1 to the Plasma Membrane When Plating CHO αIIbβ3 Cells on Fibrinogen/Rhodostomin Substrates—Endogenous NHE1 and NCX1 proteins in CHO αIIbβ3 cells were revealed by Western blotting analysis (Fig. 2a). Although the amounts of ion exchanger did not change significantly when the cells were plated on different substrates, their subcellular distributions varied. In Fig. 2, b and c, immunofluorescence staining showed that the ion exchangers were present mainly in the cytoplasm as punctate vesicles but were absent from the cell membrane of CHO αIIbβ3 cells when plated on PLL control substrate for 20 min. In contrast, CHO αIIbβ3 cells grown on Fg or rho substrates for 20 min resulted in recruitment of NHE1-NCX1 from the intracellular vesicular compartments to the plasma membranes (arrowheads), where they co-localized with integrin αIIbβ3. In Fig. 2d, the dynamic redistribution process of fluorescently labeled NHE1 (NHE1-mRFP) was carefully monitored by confocal microscopy in a live CHO αIIbβ3 cell that was held in contact with a bead coated with rho (asterisk). As shown in the zoomed-in image sequence, vesicular or tubular structures that contained NHE1-mRFP were noticed to appose the plasma membrane to where the bead bound (arrowheads). We have also employed total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) to monitor fusion by an intracellular vesicle to the plasma membrane (supplemental Movie 4). A typical example of such vesicle fusion event is shown in Fig. 2e. A vesicle containing GFP-labeled NHE1 was seen entering the evanescent field of TIRFM (Fig. 2e, red arrowheads); the vesicle's fluorescence then locally dispersed in a pattern that was characteristic of vesicle fusion (yellow arrowheads). In contrast, we seldom detected vesicle in the evanescent field; nor did we see any discernible occurrence of vesicle fusion if plating CHO αIIbβ3 cells on PLL substrate (supplemental Movie 5). FLIM-FRET Measurements Revealed Direct Molecular Interactions between Integrin αIIbβ3 and Ion Exchanger NHE1 or NCX1—Despite the strong functional link between integrin αIIbβ3 and NHE1 or NCX1 (Fig. 1) and their co-localizations on the plasma membrane (Fig. 2), extensive tests using conventional co-immunoprecipitation assays failed to demonstrate their protein-protein interactions in a convincing way. Does integrin αIIbβ3 bind to the ion exchangers? To further explore this question, we employed the FRET technique to reveal any putative intermolecular interactions that could not be properly studied by conventional biochemical methodology. Notably, FRET in this study was determined by quantifying the donor fluorochrome's FLIM. The reduction of FRET donor's FLIM when present very close to (i.e. <10 nm) the acceptor fluorochrome was indicative of FRET, or intermolecular binding between the paired molecules. The use of FLIM-FRET should be comparable with and, in some cases, complementary to fluorescence intensity-based FRET measurements that apply the ratio imaging method (see “Discussion”) (18Ghukasyan V. Hsu Y.Y. Kung S.H. Kao F.J. J. Biomed. Opt.. 2007; 12: 024016Google Scholar, 32Wang Y. Chien S. Methods Enzymol.. 2007; 426: 177-201Google Scholar). Typical FLIM-FRET results between integrin αIIb and NCX1 or NHE1 or between NCX1 and NHE1 are shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3a, CHO αIIbβ3 cells were subjected to immunofluorescence staining; NHE1 stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorochrome was used as FRET donor, whereas TRITC-labeled integrin αIIb was used as FRET acceptor. The fluorescence intensity images of FRET donor are shown in gray scale, whereas the corresponding FLIM images (ranging from 1200 to 2500 ps) are displayed in pseudocolor. Note that FLIM images of the CHO αIIbβ3 cells grown on Fg or rho substrates significantly shifted to yellow/red across the entire cell, as compared with the cells grown on the control PLL substrate or the cells containing FRET donor only. In the latter two cases, long lifetime values were obtained, and the FLIM images were pseudocolor-coded in blue/green. Note also that in CHO αIIbβ3 cells grown on Fg or rho substrates, certain focal spots along the plasma membranes exhibited particularly strong FRET (red spots indicated by arrowheads). These were the regions where strong intermolecular interactions between NHE1 and integrin αIIb took place. Similar findings were obtained using NCX1 as FRET donor and integrin αIIb as FRET acceptor (Fig. 3b). Interestingly, FRET between NCX1 and NHE1 (Fig. 3c) was less evident than FRET between individual ion exchangers and integrin αIIb. To confirm that the reduction of NHE1 donor's FLIM was actually due to the energy transfer (or FRET) to the integrin αIIb acceptor, we photobleached the acceptor fluorochrome and repeated the donor's lifetime measurement (Fig. 3d). Indeed, photobleaching of the FRET acceptor effectively prevented the reduction of donor fluorochrome's lifetime, suggesting that detecting decrease of the donor's lifetime was an accurate way to reveal the occurrence of FRET. To quantify the degrees of FRET, lifetime values of individual image pixels were calculated and displayed in histograms or as mean ± S.D. (Fig. 3e). Using NHE1-integrin αIIb and NCX1-integrin αIIb as FRET pairs, we noticed that CHO αIIbβ3 cells plated on the Fg (red symbols) or rho (blue symbols) substrates exhibited profound donor lifetime reductions, compared with the cells grown on the PLL substrate (black symbols), or the cells containing donor fluorochrome only (gray symbols). Note also from these results that FRET between the NCX1 and NHE1 pair was less evident than FRET pairs between integrin αIIb and individual ion exchangers. Molecular Interactions between Integrin αIIbβ3 and Ion Exchangers Also Occurred in Intracellular Vesicular Compartments—As shown in Fig. 3a, FRET between integrin αIIbβ3 and ion exchangers was found not only on the cell membrane but also in the intracellular vesicular compartments. To further explore this phenomenon, time lapse FLIM imaging (Fig. 4) using NHE1-GFP and integrin β3-mRFP as the donor and acceptor of FRET pair, respectively, was performed on a live CHO αIIbβ3 cell, which was held in contact with a 5-μm rho-coated bead (asterisks). The resulting donor's intensity and FLIM images were shown in gray scale and pseudocolor (ranging from 1600 to 2600 ps), respectively. We noticed that FRET-positive areas (yellow/red) did appear in the cytoplasm as punctate intracellular vesicles, and these progressively increased over time (Fig. 4a), whereas the donor-only control remained free of FRET. Interestingly, such FRET between integrin β3 and NHE1 in the intracellular vesicular compartments could be effectively reduced by treating the cell with Tg that depleted intracellular calcium store or partially with MβCD that disrupted lipid raft integrity (Fig. 4b). On the other hand, genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor; LY294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor; calphostin C, a protein kinase C inhibitor; or nocodazole, a microtubule toxin, had no obvious effect on FRET between integrin β3-NHE1 in the intracellular vesicular compartments. These results indicated that following the CHO αIIbβ3 cell's binding to a Fg/rho substrates intermolecular interactions between integrin αIIbβ3 and ion exchangers took place not only on the plasma membrane, where the ligands bound to the integrin receptors, but also in vesicles many μm away from the ligand-receptor binding sites. Lipid Microdomain-mediated Targeting of NHE1 and NCX1 to the Plasma Membrane and Their Interactions with Integrin αIIbβ3—Previous reports indicated that lipid rafts were involved in integrin downstream signaling (33Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2000; 1: 31-39Google Scholar, 34Wang X. Huang D.Y. Huong S.M. Huang E.S. Nat. Med.. 2005; 11: 515-521Google Scholar) and platelet activation (35Bodin S. Tronchere H. Payrastre B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2003; 1610: 247-257Google Scholar). We have shown in Fig. 4b that disruption of lipid rafts by MβCD affected intermolecular interactions between integrin αIIbβ3 and ion exchanger NHE1 or NCX1. The same drug treatment also reduced calcium oscillations in CHO αIIbβ3 cells grown on Fg/rho substrates in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1b, green bars). These results suggested a role played by lipid rafts, or lipid microdomains, in modulating the observed calcium oscillations in CHO αIIbβ3 cells grown on Fg/rho substrates. The presence of lipid rafts was revealed b"

We offer the view that this tumult is the result of the intersecting behaviors of the many single-celled creatures (i.e., neurons, glia, and progenitors) that inhabit brains. New tools will certainly be needed if we wish to monitor the myriad cooperative and competitive interactions at play in the cellular society that builds brains."

ABF1 is an essential and abundant DNA-binding protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1Diffley J.F. Stillman B. Science. 1989; 246: 1034-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Structurally it is comprised of a N-terminal DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal activation domain. In this respect ABF1 resembles many site-specific transcription factors (2Reid J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1297-1307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). However, this protein is distinct from other site-specific transcription factors in that it is very abundant, and its ability to bind specifically to multiple sites in DNA can mediate a variety of nuclear functions (3Yarragudi A. Miyake T. Li R. Morse R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9152-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Notably whereas binding of ABF1 at the autonomously replicating sequence designated ARS1 is required for efficient replication from this origin of replication (4Rao H. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2224-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), ABF1 binding at the HMR-E silent mating type locus is one of three site-specific DNA binding events required for proper silencing in this region of the genome (5Zou Y. Yu Q. Bi X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7806-7819Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Additionally binding of ABF1 at sites located within transcriptional promoters mediates either activation or repression of transcription in over 100 different genes with diverse metabolic activities (6Yarragudi A. Parfrey L.W. Morse R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). More recently it has been shown that ABF1 plays a role during nucleotide excision repair (NER) 2The abbreviations used are: NER, nucleotide excision repair; GG-NER, global genome nucleotide excision repair; ABF1, autonomously replicating sequence-binding factor 1; ARS, autonomously replicating sequence; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CPD, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; qPCR, quantitative PCR; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; TS, transcribed strands; NTS, nontranscribed strands; WT, wild type; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate).2The abbreviations used are: NER, nucleotide excision repair; GG-NER, global genome nucleotide excision repair; ABF1, autonomously replicating sequence-binding factor 1; ARS, autonomously replicating sequence; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CPD, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; qPCR, quantitative PCR; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; TS, transcribed strands; NTS, nontranscribed strands; WT, wild type; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). of transcriptionally silent regions of the genome, so-called global genome NER (GG-NER), in yeast (7Reed S.H. Akiyama M. Stillman B. Friedberg E.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3052-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Based on this multiplicity of functions, ABF1 is one of three yeast proteins referred to as general regulatory factors (8Fourel G. Miyake T. Defossez P.A. Li R. Gilson E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41736-41743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). General regulatory factors appear to have little intrinsic regulatory activity. Rather they apparently amplify the activity of other regulatory factors with which they interact. This property has prompted some to refer to general regulatory factors as “obligate synergizers” (8Fourel G. Miyake T. Defossez P.A. Li R. Gilson E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41736-41743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).The DNA-binding domain of ABF1 recognizes a large number of specific DNA sequences scattered throughout the yeast genome, including the silent mating type loci, ARSs, telomeric X-regions, and the promoter regions of over a hundred genes. The DNA sequence RTCRYNNNNNACG has been proposed as a consensus ABF1-binding site (9Rhode P.R. Elsasser S. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell.

Genet. 2004; 36: 1331-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), and yeast genome pattern matching of this consensus sequence reveals several thousand potential ABF1-binding sites. Recent work suggests that this is a conservative estimate (6Yarragudi A. Parfrey L.W. Morse R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 12Mukherjee S.

However, ABF1 binding has been observed at many sites that do not fit this consensus sequence. At the present time genomics and other analytical approaches designed to elucidate the biological significance of ABF1 binding to DNA have assigned functions to only a small fraction of the large number of potential DNA-binding sites in the yeast genome.We previously demonstrated that ABF1 protein forms a stable complex with the yeast Rad7 and Rad16 NER proteins and plays a functional role in NER in yeast (7Reed S.H. Akiyama M. Stillman B. Friedberg E.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3052-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Rad7 and Rad16 are required for GG-NER, i.e. NER of nontranscribed regions of the genome and of the nontranscribed strands of actively transcribing genes (13Verhage R.A. van Gool A.J. de Groot N.

Our studies additionally demonstrated that like the well characterized yeast chromatin modification protein Snf2, the Rad16 component of the Rad7-Rad16-ABF1 complex generates superhelical torsion in DNA (17Yu S. Owen-Hughes T. Friedberg E.C. Waters R. Reed S.H. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), an event that is central to oligonucleotide excision during NER in vitro. Consistent with a functional role of ABF1 protein during NER in yeast ABF1 is required for survival of yeast cells following exposure to UV radiation and for GG-NER (17Yu S. Owen-Hughes T. Friedberg E.C. Waters R. Reed S.H. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Notably a temperature-sensitive abf1 allele that inactivates the DNA-binding domain of Abf1 is also UV radiation-sensitive and defective in NER.Here we report that the binding of ABF1 to its cognate DNA recognition sequence promotes efficient Rad7- and Rad16-dependent GG-NER following UV irradiation of yeast cells. Our results additionally reveal that the binding of Rad7-Rad16-Abf1 complexes to DNA does not promote significant nucleosome repositioning in regions where GG-NER is enhanced following UV irradiation of cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid and Strain Construction—All S. cerevisiae strains are in the SX46a background. The details for the construction of plasmids and strains can be found in the supplemental experimental procedures.DNA Probes for Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—A 480-bp ABF1-binding site containing DNA fragments cut from pUC18-ABF1-HIS3 or pUC18-ABF1bs-HIS3 with PvuII restriction enzyme was isolated from a 1.5% agarose gel. To generate labeled DNA probes, the gel-purified DNA fragments were end-labeled with T4 DNA polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]dATP, and the unincorporated dATP was removed on G25 columns.EMSAs of DNA Binding by ABF1—ABF1 was produced as described previously (7Reed S.H.

Competition assays were performed using unlabeled competitor DNA with wild-type or mutant ABF1 binding sequence. The gel was exposed against a phosphor screen and subsequently analyzed (GE Healthcare).EMSAs of DNA Binding by GG-NER Complex—Rad7/Rad16-containing GG-NER protein complex was purified as described previously (16Reed S.H. You Z. Friedberg E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29481-29488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). GG-NER complex was analyzed for binding activity in 10 μl with 25 ng of GG-NER complex and 15 fmol of [γ-32P]dATP-labeled DNA probe in a binding buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 40 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1.0 μg of poly(dI-dC) left for 30 min at room temperature. Supershift assays were carried out using rabbit polyclonal anti-Rad16 or anti-Rad7 antibodies (16Reed S.H. You Z. Friedberg E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29481-29488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Sample mixtures were incubated at room temperature with antibody at 1:20 dilutions for 30 min. Competition experiments are described above under “EMSAs of DNA Binding by ABF1.” Samples were fractionated by electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed for 1.5 h at 300 V at 4 °C. The gel was dried and exposed against a phosphor screen.Preparation of UV Irradiation-damaged DNA and in Vitro NER Assay—In vitro NER was undertaken as described previously (7Reed S.H. Akiyama M.

Details for the preparation of UV irradiation-damaged pUC18-ABF1-HIS3 and pUC18-ABF1bs-HIS3 ABF1 binding sequence for in vitro NER assays are noted in the supplemental experimental procedures. We estimated that on average five to six cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) per plasmid are induced in the DNA substrates used following UV irradiation. This lesion density falls well within the linear range of NER activity based on previous dose range studies (18Wang Z. Wu X. Friedberg E.C.

Primers were designed to amplify the inner nucleosomal region of N1, N2, and N3 (see Fig. 1) for histone H3 ChIP analysis to assess the histone level in these nucleosomal regions. To assess the occupancy of ABF1 and Rad7 in the HMLα I silencer region, primers for the ABF1 binding region (qPCR4), the upstream (qPCR1) and downstream regions (qPCR5) of the ABF1-binding site were used. The sequences of primers can be found in supplemental Table 1.UV Treatment of Yeast Cells, DNA Isolation, and the End Labeling Procedure for Detecting DNA Damage and Repair at the Level of Nucleotide in Vivo—These were undertaken as described previously (22Teng Y.

Nucleosomes were assembled on DNA fragments based on the murine mammary tumor virus nucleosome A positioning sequence. The sequences of primers used to generate the 105A64 fragment are provided in supplemental Table 1. The PCR fragments were purified by ion exchange chromatography on a 1.0-ml RESOURCE 1Q column using anÄKTA FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences).Nucleosome Redistribution Assays—All reactions were performed in a final volume of 10 μl containing 2 pmol of nucleosomes and 25 ng of GG-NER complex. An ATP-dependent remodeling reaction was carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm Mg-ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were terminated using 0.5 μg of λ DNA/HindIII competitor DNA, 3.5 μl of 20% sucrose were added, and the reactions were placed on ice.

Akiyama M. Stillman B. Friedberg E.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3052-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast, abf1 mutants that can bind ABF1-binding sites but are defective in DNA replication because of mutations in other regions of the protein are not abnormally sensitive to killing by UV radiation and are NER-proficient.The HMLα ABF1-binding site in the yeast genome has been studied extensively with respect to ABF1 function, chromatin structure, transcription, and NER (25Weiss K. Simpson R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5392-5403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Bi X. Braunstein M. Shei G.J. Broach J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Boiteux S. Waters R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 250: 505-514PubMed Google Scholar). This site is located within the I silencer region and promotes gene silencing at the HMLα locus. However, inhibition of ABF1 binding at this site does not alter nucleosome positioning, silencing, or transcription of HMLα (27Shei G.J. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3496-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore the site is not associated with an ARS and is not an origin of DNA replication (31Vujcic M. Miller C.A. Kowalski D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6098-6109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present studies we probed the molecular basis of the requirement for ABF1 protein for NER at this well characterized region of the genome (see Fig. 1).In initial experiments we investigated the effect of mutating the ABF1-binding site on NER by comparing ABF1 binding at the wild-type and a mutated HMLα locus using EMSAs. Purified ABF1 protein was incubated with radioactively labeled undamaged double-stranded DNA probes containing either the wild-type or mutated ABF1 binding sequences. The specificity of the protein-DNA interactions was verified by control experiments in which wild-type and mutated unlabeled DNA fragments were compared for their ability to compete with labeled probe for ABF1 binding. As shown in Fig. 2A, ABF1 efficiently bound the wild-type probe (lane 3). The observed band shift was significantly competed by an excess of wild-type cold DNA (lane 7). However, such competition was not observed in the presence of up to a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled mutant DNA (lane 5).FIGURE 2EMSAs to detect ABF1 and GG-NER complex DNA binding activity. A, EMSAs with ABF1. [γ-32P]dATP-labeled 480-bp duplex DNA containing wild-type ABF1 binding sequence (WT; lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) or triple point-mutated ABF1 binding sequence (Mut; lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) was incubated at room temperature for 30 min either with (lanes 3–8) or without recombinant ABF1 (lanes 1 and 2). A competition experiment was performed in the presence of unlabeled DNAs containing three point-mutated (lanes 5 and 6) or wild-type (lanes 7 and 8) ABF1 binding sequence. B, EMSAs with GG-NER complex. [γ-32P]dATP-labeled 480-bp duplex DNA containing wild-type ABF1 binding sequence (lanes 1–5 and 9–11) or triple point-mutated ABF1 binding sequence (Mut; lanes 6–8 and 12–14) was incubated at room temperature for 30 min either with (lanes 2–5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, and 14) or without GG-NER complex (lanes 1, 6, 9, and 12). Competition was performed in the presence of unlabeled DNAs containing triple point-mutated (Mut; lane 3) and normal (WT; lane 4) ABF1 binding sequence. In supershift assays, antibodies against Rad16 (R16)(lanes 5 and 8) and Rad7 (R7)(lane 11 and 14) were subsequently added to the mixture and incubated for another 30 min at room temperature.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In contrast to these results we observed defective ABF1 binding to probes containing point mutations in conserved nucleotides in the ABF1-binding site (lane 4), and the addition of cold competitor DNA merely inhibited background ABF1-DNA interactions (lane 8). We therefore conclude that mutations in the ABF-binding site in the HMLα locus severely impair the binding ability of ABF1 protein to the site.In light of our previous observations that ABF1 protein interacts with the Rad7-Rad16 GG-NER protein complex (7Reed S.H. Akiyama M. Stillman B. Friedberg E.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3052-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) we asked whether defective binding of ABF1 protein weakens the recruitment of Rad7 and Rad16 to the undamaged DNA probes used above. As shown in Fig. 2B, purified Rad7-Rad16 GG-NER complex bound to the wild-type probe (lane 2) more efficiently than to the mutant probe (lane 7). The specificity of the DNA-protein interactions was demonstrated by competition assays with cold competitor DNA probes (lanes 3 and 4). Furthermore the addition of anti-Rad7 and anti-Rad16 antibodies resulted in a supershift of the protein-DNA complex (lanes 5 and 11). We conclude that mutations in the ABF1-binding site that preclude the binding of ABF1 protein interfere with efficient recruitment of Rad7 and Rad16 proteins, known components of the GG-NER complex.Loss of ABF1 Binding Reduces NER Efficiency in Vitro—To establish that the failure to observe efficient recruitment of Rad7 and Rad16 proteins indeed affects GG-NER we compared repair synthesis of UV irradiated plasmids carrying either wild-type (pUC18-ABF1-HIS3) or mutated (pUC18-ABF1bs-HIS3) ABF1 binding sequences (Fig. 3, A and B). Ethidium bromide staining of the gel (Fig. 3A, top) shows the total amount of plasmid DNA loaded on the gel. The autoradiograph of the dried gel (Fig. 3A, bottom) indicates the amount of incorporated radiolabeled dATP during repair synthesis. Control experiments using undamaged plasmids were routinely included to determine background levels of radiolabel incorporation (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4). The low level of background radiolabel incorporation in the undamaged plasmid was subtracted from the specific signal incorporated in the damaged plasmid to determine the level of DNA repair synthesis. The damaged plasmid DNA containing triple point mutations in the ABF1-binding site (Fig. 3A, lane 2) was consistently repaired about 50% less efficiently than the wild-type plasmid (Fig. 3A, lane 1). This occurred over a range of initial damaged DNA substrate amounts as shown in Fig. 3B. This indicates that the presence of an ABF1-binding site in the damaged DNA plasmid DNA template consistently enhanced the repair synthesis in the plasmid over the range of DNA substrate amounts indicated.FIGURE 3In vitro NER analysis to monitor repair synthesis. NER was performed at 26 °C for 2 h using UV radiation-damaged (+UV; 300 J/m2) or undamaged (-UV) plasmid pUC18-ABF1-HIS3 (WT; lanes 1 and 3, respectively) or pUC18-ABF1bs-HIS3 (Mut; lanes 2 and 4, respectively) in the presence of wild-type yeast whole cell extract. A, ethidium bromide-stained gel represents the total DNA loading (top), and an autoradiograph of the gel indicates the level of DNA repair synthesis or background radiolabel incorporation for the damaged (+UV) or undamaged (-UV) plasmids (bottom).

Miyake T. Li R. Morse R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9152-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 6Yarragudi A. Parfrey L.W. Morse R.H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1390-1396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the function of ABF1 protein in GG-NER involves altered nucleosome positioning we introduced the triple point-mutated ABF1-binding site into the I silencer region of HMLα on chromosome III and examined micrococcal nuclease sensitivity in chromatin extracted from wild-type cells (RAD+) and those carrying a mutated ABF1-binding site (RAD+/ABF1bs) (20Teng Y. Yu S. Waters R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: E64Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Stretches of DNA separated by 140–160 bp in length that are protected in chromatin but not in naked DNA are diagnostic of nucleosomes (33Simpson R.T. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 143-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 34Thoma F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 displays micrococcal nuclease-sensitive sites at low resolution and reveals that the wild-type and mutated strains exhibited similar sensitivity. Nucleosomes were found positioned at N1, N2, N3, N4, and N5, which is consistent with previous reports of nucleosome positioning in the region (25Weiss K. Simpson R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5392-5403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).FIGURE 4Low resolution micrococcal nuclease nucleosome mapping. The amount of micrococcal nuclease (MNase) used is indicated at the top of each lane. Molecular weight markers (M) on the right indicate the size (bp) of the bands. The positioned nucleosomes (N1–N5) are shown as ellipses on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm that no major changes in chromatin structure transpire following loss of ABF1 binding we measured total histone H3 levels at the HMLα1 locus by ChIP at the N1, N2, and N3 nucleosome sites. Our results show that in each position examined the level of total histone H3 is similar in the wild type and ABF1-binding site mutant (supplemental Fig. 1). Collectively our results demonstrate that mutation of the ABF1-binding site does not significantly alter chromatin structure in the region examined.ABF1 and GG-NER Complex Binding at the ABF1 I Silencer Site in Vivo—The experiments described above were carried out using purified proteins or protein complexes and cell-free extracts. To confirm the effect of altering the consensus ABF1-binding site sequence on ABF1 binding and hence on the efficiency of GG-NER in vivo, we examined the occupancy of ABF1 and the Rad7-Rad16 GG-NER complex in the vicinity of the ABF1-binding site at the HMLα I silencer by in vivo ChIP analysis. This was accomplished using specific antibodies against ABF1 and Rad7 proteins. First we measured ABF1 occupancy at the ABF1-binding site both in RAD+ and RAD+/ABF1bs strains by mapping the binding of ABF1 using primer pairs spanning the region surrounding the HMLα I silencer. Fig. 5 shows that ABF1 bound to the wild-type ABF1 consensus site at the I silencer (qPCR4) in the absence of DNA damage (U) consistent with the expected presence of ABF1 at the I silencer. Following exposure of cells to UV radiation we observed a small initial increase (0 h) in ABF1 occupancy followed by a loss of ABF1 occupancy at later times (1 and 2 h). Occupancy of ABF1 at the I silencer returned to levels detected in unirradiated cells after 4 h. ABF1 occupancy was not detected at positions upstream (+871 to +959) or downstream (+1884 to +2095) of the I silencer (measured by using the qPCR1 and qPCR5 primers in either the RAD+ or RAD+/ABF1bs strains), indicating the specificity of ABF1 binding at the I silencer site. Furthermore ABF1 occupancy was significantly reduced at the HMLα I silencer regions tested in the RAD+/ABF1bs strain containing a triple point mutation in the ABF1-binding site of the I silencer, confirming the importance of this site for ABF1 binding.FIGURE 5ABF1 binding to HMLα I silencer requires an ABF1-binding site. Immunoprecipitation with ABF1 antibody was performed in RAD+ and RAD+/Abf1bs cells. The occupancy of ABF1 was measured by qPCR with the primers spanning the HMLα I silencer region (qPCR1, qPCR4, and qPCR5). Data are represented as average of three experiments ±S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also confirmed the occupancy of Rad7 protein at the I silencer using qPCR3 primers, which span the same region of the genome as qPCR4 primers, and antibodies raised against Rad7 protein (supplemental Fig. 2).

https://openalex.org/W2063373381,"Members of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family are mitogens for cells of mesenchymal origin and have important functions during embryonic development, blood vessel maturation, fibrotic diseases and cancer. In contrast to the two classical PDGFs, the novel and less well-characterized members, PDGF-CC and PDGF-DD, are latent factors that need to be processed extracellularly by activating proteases, before they can mediate PDGF receptor activation. Here, we elucidate the structural requirements for urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)-mediated activation of PDGF-DD, as well as the intricate interplay with uPA receptor (uPAR) signalling. Furthermore, we show that activated PDGF-DD, in comparison to latent, more potently transforms NIH/3T3 cells in vitro. Conversely, xenograft studies in nude mice demonstrate that cells expressing latent PDGF-DD are more tumorigenic than those expressing activated PDGF-DD. These findings imply that a fine-tuned proteolytic activation, in the local milieu, controls PDGF-DD bioavailability. Moreover, we suggest that proteolytic activation of PDGF-DD reveals a retention motif mediating interactions with pericellular components. Our proposed mechanism, where uPA not only generates active PDGF-DD, but also regulates its spatial distribution, provides novel insights into the biological function of PDGF-DD."

https://openalex.org/W2078047503,"The retinoblastoma protein pRB suppresses tumorigenesis largely through regulation of the E2F transcription factors. E2F4, the most abundant E2F protein, is thought to act in cooperation with pRB to restrain cell proliferation. In this study, we analyse how loss of E2f4 affects the tumorigenicity of pRB-deficient tissues. As Rb(-/-);E2f4(-/-) germline mice die in utero, we generated Rb(-/-);E2f4(-/-) chimeric animals to allow examination of adult tumor phenotypes. We found that loss of E2f4 had a differential effect on known Rb-associated neuroendocrine tumors. It did not affect thyroid and adrenal glands tumors but partially suppressed lung neuroendocrine hyperplasia. The most striking effect was in the pituitary where E2F4 loss delayed the development, and reduced the incidence, of Rb mutant tumors. This tumor suppression increased the longevity of the Rb(-/-);E2f4(-/-) chimeric animals allowing us to identify novel tumor types. We observed ganglionic neuroendocrine neoplasms, lesions not associated earlier with mutation of either Rb or E2f4. Moreover, a subset of the Rb(-/-);E2f4(-/-) chimeras developed either low- or high-grade carcinomas in the urothelium transitional epithelium supporting a key role for Rb in bladder cancer."

The Institute of Medicine's Forum on Neuroscience and Nervous System Disorders established a “Grand Challenges Initiative.” The goal is to help frame a broad, integrated research program that would attract substantial funding and generate additional resources to support large-scale efforts to tackle some of the most daunting but important neuroscience questions. The “father of neuroscience,” Santiago Ramon y Cajal, argued at the turn of the 20th century that the brain was made up of neurons woven together in a highly specific way (Azmitia et al., 2002Azmitia E. DeFelipe J. Jones E. Rakic P. Ribak C. Changing Views of Cajal's Neuron. Elsevier, New York2002Google Scholar). Although great advances bring us ever closer to mapping and understanding this exquisite network, the majority of the truly major questions remain. Many of these questions are not only of great scientific import but of broad interest to the rest of society. Some relate to specific neurological or mental disorders, while others relate to the general nature and workings of the brain and mind and how phenomena such as consciousness evolve. Although attempts have been made in the past to galvanize both the neuroscience community and the broader public around great questions—major infrastructure resources that can be shared (like the comprehensive database proposed initially for the Human Brain Project [Huerta et al., 1993Huerta M. Koslow S. Leshner A. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 436-438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar]), or broad celebrations of neuroscience advances (like the Decade of the Brain)—none has successfully translated into major research funding increases. However, now may be the time to rally the neuroscience fields and broader society. Unlike previous efforts, many in the scientific and policy communities believe that recent neuroscience advances, combined with revolutionary new tools and techniques, now position the field to be able to approach an array of the most important, overarching basic and clinical neuroscience questions and that, when presented appropriately, these questions or challenges could serve as the core of major new budget initiatives. Recognizing this opportunity, the Institute of Medicine's (IOM's) Forum on Neuroscience and Nervous System Disorders established a “Grand Challenges Initiative” that culminated in a workshop on June 25, 2008, in Washington, DC (http://www.iom.edu/neurograndchallenges). Organized by a planning committee that included many leading scientists and science policy makers, the workshop brought together more than 70 experts from a variety of disciplines within the neurosciences. The objective of this workshop was to discuss a set of questions, or grand challenges, which could galvanize a large segment of the neuroscience community to work in an integrated way on a common set of major questions with broad scientific, social, and economic implications. The ultimate goal of the Forum's efforts is to provide a basis for long-term, large-scale interagency funding initiatives focused on one or more of the grand challenges identified. The expectation is that this kind of initiative could both rally and fund a large number of neuroscience investigators. The IOM's Forum on Neuroscience and Nervous System Disorders was established in 2006 to bring together leaders from federal agencies sponsoring and regulating biomedical and clinical research, the academic community, industry, and patient advocacy organizations to discuss issues of mutual interest and concern. The Forum provides a neutral venue to explore common issues and helps foster new partnerships among stakeholders to further understand the brain and nervous system and disorders in their structure and function; further the development of more effective clinical prevention and treatment strategies; and discuss policy initiatives that will further advance the neurosciences. In keeping with the IOM's policies, the Forum is not intended to provide specific policy recommendations or arrive at consensus conclusions; rather, the Forum seeks to highlight and discuss the challenges and opportunities facing the neurosciences. The idea of identifying “Grand Challenges” has a strong history in science (Omenn, 2006Omenn S. Science. 2006; 314: 1696-1704Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). John F. Kennedy's call to put a man on the moon rallied the scientific community to a common purpose and drove enormous advances in the field. More recently, the physics community was united in 2003 by the publication of Connecting Quarks with the Cosmos. This National Research Council committee report identified a handful of fundamental questions about the universe, such as “What powered the big bang?” and “What is dark matter?”. (National Research Council, 2003National Research CouncilConnecting Quarks with the Cosmos: Eleven Science Questions for the New Century. The National Academies Press, Washington, DC2003Google Scholar). The report, and subsequent strategic planning undertaken by federal interagency efforts, has helped direct resources and funding toward the physics and astronomy communities (National Science and Technology Council, 2004National Science and Technology CouncilA 21st Century Frontier of Discovery: The Physics of the Universe. Office of Science and Technology Policy, Washington, DC2004Google Scholar). The result of this common purpose—combined with new funding, novel technologies, and an influx of scientists—drove researchers to accomplish goals that seemed impossible just a few years before. The Neuroscience Forum's Grand Challenges Initiative is intended to be developed by the field into a budgetary and scientific initiative of a similar magnitude to ultimately reduce the burden of disorders of the nervous system. As highlighted in the recent initiative undertaken by the World Health Organization (WHO), disorders of the nervous system affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide (World Health Organization and World Organization of Family Doctors, 2008World Health Organization and World Organization of Family Doctors. (2008). Integrating Mental Health into Primary Care: A Global Perspective (Geneva, Switzerland).Google Scholar). For example, depression affects 154 million people, 25 million people suffer from schizophrenia, 91 million people are affected by alcohol use disorders, 15 million people suffer from drug use disorders, epilepsy impacts 50 million, and 24 million people suffer from Alzheimer's and other dementias. The collective burden from these disorders causes a significant impact on the world's economic output. Neuroscience is not a single “science” but is actually a multidisciplinary enterprise including diverse fields (e.g., molecular biology, anatomy, psychology and psychiatry, neurology, chemistry, mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science) and multiple funding organizations (e.g., NIH, NSF, Department of Defense, foundations, private sector, and patient advocacy organizations). However, the Forum recognizes that if a significant segment of this diverse collection of scientists and funding organizations could rally their collective energy, expertise, and efforts around a small set of overarching goals, the additive benefits to the field would be logarithmic. Furthermore, our customers and ultimate sponsors, the American public, would reap the rewards of improved health through a much more advanced understanding of the brain and neurological and mental disorders. The Grand Challenges workshop provided an invigorating opportunity to step back and discuss many of the larger challenges and opportunities facing the neurosciences over the coming decades. Everyone recognized the extraordinary rate of advances over the past 50 years. Furthermore, the participants believed these past successes—in combination with new tools and techniques from molecular biology and genetics, information science and technology, mathematics, and neuroimaging—have positioned neuroscience on the cusp of even greater transformational progress in our understanding of the brain and how its activities result in mental activity. The group recognized that bringing large segments of the multiple fields that make up the neurosciences toward a common goal will be difficult and that the field still needs additional technologies and resources that can be shared to achieve its goals. But with the right infusion of new funding and resources, the group believed, the potential payoff to society would be extraordinary. The workshop discussions identified three grand challenges that might be used to develop a long-term interagency funding initiative focused on one or more of them. The challenges are:•How does the brain work and produce mental activity? How does physical activity in the brain lead to thought, emotion, and other behaviors?•Nature and nurture: how does the interplay of biology and experience shape our brains and make us who we are today?•How do we keep our brains healthy? How do we protect, restore, or enhance the functioning of our brains as we age? Understanding how the human brain produces complex outputs such as emotion, thoughts, and, ultimately, action seems to be a formidable and awesome task. These kinds of emergent properties have been a constant but difficult to reach goal for neuroscience since its beginnings. But much has been learned about cognitive function and its underlying biological bases. The time is right to ramp up integrating efforts across the molecular, cellular, synaptic, circuit, systems, computational, and psychological levels to make transformative progress in understanding these emergent properties. For many decades, philosophers and scientists have argued about the influences of nurture, or biological inheritance, versus nature. As our understanding of the brain has advanced, it has become clear that what really matters is the interplay between nature and nurture. Many of the most common nervous system disorders—schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease—are complex genetic disorders that are influenced by environmental factors. The field has benefited tremendously from an improved understanding of the role of genetics in the development and maintenance of the nervous system. However, genes, of course, do not equate to destiny. Not only does experience shape behaviors, but genetic expression as well. With an improved understanding of neuronal plasticity—the brain's ability to shape, form, eliminate, and strengthen new connections—we can begin to understand how changes in brain structure and function continue to shape who we are throughout life. We can further our understanding of just how genes and experience interact to shape us. What was a philosophical question for so many years may now be studied in ways that are more firmly based biologically and use mechanistic models. Major questions of great interest to virtually everyone in our society include how or why brain function appears to deteriorate with aging and what can be done about it. A better understanding of how lifestyles affect the aging brain and vice versa will help establish the behaviors and lifestyles that will ensure improved health of all our organs, including the brain. Research that was not possible a decade ago is now beginning to reveal the details of just how the brain ages. With this improved understanding, interventions can be developed to lessen negative impacts on the aging brain and its consequences for overall health. Neuroscience is among the most rapidly advancing domains in all of science and technology. The number of investigators has grown exponentially, with more than 38,000 neuroscientists now members of the Society for Neuroscience (Society for Neuroscience, 2008Society for Neuroscience. (2008). Membership information. http://www.sfn.org/index.cfm?pagename=membership_Aboutmembership_statistics (accessed October 20, 2008).Google Scholar). More importantly, advances in understanding the nervous system and its functioning and outputs have also come at an astounding pace. However, the field remains somewhat of a “cottage industry,” with a large majority of efforts carried out in relatively small laboratories with single investigators at their helms. This model has served the field well, but many people believe even greater progress would result both from further integration of efforts across subdisciplines and with the availability of more large-scale resources that can be accessed by more investigators. That is the purpose of this Grand Challenges Initiative: to generate additional resources to support large-scale efforts to tackle some of the most important neuroscience questions of our time. A reasonable question is whether this is the right time to mount a new budget initiative for neuroscience. Like all the sciences, neuroscience is already feeling the effects of restricted funding from the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, and other research sponsors, and the steep costs associated with scientific inflation. Our investigators are being asked to do more with less. In addition to the current pressures, all indications show that this environment of fiscal restraint will not change in the near future. In spite of that negative context, however, lessons from other fields suggest that if we do not propose some major initiatives, our field will be left behind others that are more assertive. Importantly, the idea here is not to redirect the already limited resources dedicated to funding current research project grant programs but to generate additional funds. Another reasonable question is whether this kind of initiative would overly bias the neuroscience research funding agenda in one direction or another. Again, the notion here is to provide resources that could be useful to and shared among large segments of the existing field. Further, because the concept includes securing additional resources, there is no intent to supplant (only to supplement) ongoing research efforts. The vision of this Grand Challenges Initiative is to begin to frame a more integrated, large-scale research program that would spark public excitement and attract substantial funding to move the field ahead in a quantum step and ultimately reduce the burden of disorders of the nervous system. Scientifically, the time is right. What we now need is leadership from within the field to refine and move forward the core concepts. The ideas presented here are the result of a single IOM workshop and related activities. The implementation of this vision now rests with the broader neuroscience community of researchers, policy makers, and funders to translate these or other ideas into a coherent initiative and implementation plan. A first step, as has been done by other scientific communities, like ecology, physics, and astronomy, might be for volunteers or a neuroscience professional association to establish a steering committee among active neuroscientists to define and flesh out the Grand Challenges Initiative. The core group might or might not include representatives of the critical funding agencies; both models have been used. In addition, it may be important to include colleagues from our patient advocacy community. But once refined, the Initiative can be submitted in partnership with the leaders in funding agencies to both Administration budgeters and Congressional appropriators.
