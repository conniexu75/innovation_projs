Four types of dengue virus (two of which are new), chikungunya virus, and another virus yet to be identified were isolated from the blood of patients. Dengue viruses, types 2 and 3, were isolated from the mosquitoes. Ample serologic confirmation was obtained of concurrent hemorrhagic fever and infection with one or more of these viruses. Thus, it was discovered that viruses of previously recognized types and of closely related new types apparently have etiologic roles in a new and highly dangerous epidemic disease syndrome."

The rate of beating, which is up to 150 beats per minute, is affected by cardiac drugs and by metabolic substrates and inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W2049895424,"Fourteen species of marine invertebrates representing 12 phyla were kept in sea water containing NaHC(14)O(2) for 1 hour. All of them fixed CO(2) into acids of the Krebs citric acid cycle. In most species the major portion of the radioactivity recovered after chromatography was in succinic, fumaric, and malic acids. The findings favor the hypothesis that both CO(2) fixation and the citric acid cycle are virtually universal among marine invertebrates."

https://openalex.org/W1968325890,From an adult white resident of California with clinically typical early trachoma a virus was isolated by growth in embryonated eggs. Morphologically and serologically the virus belongs in the psittacosis-lymphogranuloma group. When it is instilled into monkey eyes it produces acute follicular conjunctivitis with typical inclusion bodies.

https://openalex.org/W2002470828,"γ-AMINOBUTYRIC acid is present in relatively large amounts in the mammalian central nervous system, where it exists chiefly in the free form 1,2. The formation of this amino-acid in brain tissue takes place by the decarboxylation of L-glutamic acid 1,3,4. There are in the literature several reports of a number of substances, mainly hydrazides, which lower the central nervous system level of γ-aminobutyric acid. In addition, a few substances, like diphenylhydantion and acetazoleamide, and some conditions have been reported to elevate the brain γ-aminobutyric acid content 5."

https://openalex.org/W2056648484,"EVIDENCE that the provision of cobalt-containing supplements to ruminants will increase the vitamin B12 content of their milk is conflicting. Harper et al. 1 and Moinuddin et al. 2 found that cobaltized mineral mixtures given to ewes fed on dry rations significantly increased vitamin B12 levels in the milk. Other workers3, however, have reported that supplementary feeding with cobalt-containing trace element mixtures had no effect on the vitamin B12 content of cows' milk when the animals were either stall-fed or grazed on pasture. According to Shrimpton and Duckworth4 extra cobalt given to grazing ewes either as a drench or in a mineral supplement failed to increase the vitamin B12 content of the milk; but it seems doubtful whether any response would have been expected under the particular conditions of their trials."

https://openalex.org/W1983145578,"IN 1954 we put forward a hypothesis1 that the trans-acids content of the depot fats of ruminants may be explained by the hydrogenation of the dietary fatty acids from pasture effected by the rumen bacteria. No trans-acids were detected in pasture-fed non-ruminants and the small amounts of these acids found in the pig were attributed to the skim-milk diet. This hypothesis was afterwards elaborated in a more detailed report2. Recently Kühn and Lück3 extended this investigation to the depot fats of other non-ruminants, and whereas no appreciable amounts of trans-acids were detected in most of the species examined, 4–6.3 per cent trans-acids were found by them in the domestic cat and 3–4 per cent in the human fat. The last two results are according to them difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis that the occurrence of trans-acids is confined to the fats of ruminants only."

https://openalex.org/W2025191516,"THE bacillus of human leprosy (Mycobacterium leprae) was one of the first bacteria to be identified as the causative organism of a disease; but it remains to this day among the very few that have failed to grow in any type of culture medium. There is indeed doubt as to whether it has ever even been transmitted to an experimental animal. Much of the laboratory work on leprosy has therefore been concerned with the only other closely related organism, the rat leprosy bacillus (Mycobacterium lepraemurium), which infects rats and mice, causing disease having many of the characteristics of human leprosy; in common with M. leprae it is unusually slow-growing in the body, with at least 10 days elapsing between each generation."

This yields a mortality pattern which ""fingerprints"" the compound. Toxicants related by chemical structure or biological activity tend to possess similar mortality patterns."

K., Harthoorn, A. M., and Luck, C. P., unpublished work). The herd in question numbers some 500 head, and is the only herd of kob in Kenya. Its existence in this number on the farm- and ranch-land of Lugari cannot be supported by the landowners. Moving part of the herd to other areas is the only alternative to destruction."
