https://openalex.org/W2059214757,"The amyloid beta protein is deposited in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease but its pathogenic role is unknown. In culture, the amyloid beta protein was neurotrophic to undifferentiated hippocampal neurons at low concentrations and neurotoxic to mature neurons at higher concentrations. In differentiated neurons, amyloid beta protein caused dendritic and axonal retraction followed by neuronal death. A portion of the amyloid beta protein (amino acids 25 to 35) mediated both the trophic and toxic effects and was homologous to the tachykinin neuropeptide family. The effects of the amyloid beta protein were mimicked by tachykinin antagonists and completely reversed by specific tachykinin agonists. Thus, the amyloid beta protein could function as a neurotrophic factor for differentiating neurons, but at high concentrations in mature neurons, as in Alzheimer's disease, could cause neuronal degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2058346978,"S. cerevisiae chromosomes end with the telomeric repeat (TG1-3)n. When any of four Pol II genes was placed immediately adjacent to the telomeric repeats, expression of the gene was reversibly repressed as demonstrated by phenotype and mRNA analyses. For example, cells bearing a telomere-linked copy of ADE2 produced predominantly red colonies (a phenotype characteristic of ade2- cells) containing white sectors (characteristic of ADE2+ cells). Repression was due to proximity to the telomere itself since an 81 bp tract of (TG1-3)n positioned downstream of URA3 when URA3 was approximately 20 kb from the end of chromosome VII did not alter expression of the gene. However, this internal tract of (TG1-3)n could spontaneously become telomeric, in which case expression of the URA3 gene was repressed. These data demonstrate that yeast telomeres exert a position effect on the transcription of nearby genes, an effect that is under epigenetic control."
https://openalex.org/W2169485613,"Since 1979, a continuing study of monozygotic and dizygotic twins, separated in infancy and reared apart, has subjected more than 100 sets of reared-apart twins or triplets to a week of intensive psychological and physiological assessment. Like the prior, smaller studies of monozygotic twins reared apart, about 70% of the variance in IQ was found to be associated with genetic variation. On multiple measures of personality and temperament, occupational and leisure-time interests, and social attitudes, monozygotic twins reared apart are about as similar as are monozygotic twins reared together. These findings extend and support those from numerous other twin, family, and adoption studies. It is a plausible hypothesis that genetic differences affect psychological differences largely indirectly, by influencing the effective environment of the developing child. This evidence for the strong heritability of most psychological traits, sensibly construed, does not detract from the value or importance of parenting, education, and other propaedeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2079882829,"Clinical and experimental studies have shown that the hippocampal formation and related structures in the medial temporal lobe are important for learning and memory. Retrograde amnesia was studied prospectively in monkeys to understand the contribution of the hippocampal formation to memory function. Monkeys learned to discriminate 100 pairs of objects beginning 16, 12, 8, 4, and 2 weeks before the hippocampal formation was removed (20 different pairs at each time period). Two weeks after surgery, memory was assessed by presenting each of the 100 object pairs again for a single-choice trial. Normal monkeys exhibited forgetting; that is, they remembered recently learned objects better than objects learned many weeks earlier. Monkeys with hippocampal damage were severely impaired at remembering recently learned objects. In addition, they remembered objects learned long ago as well as normal monkeys did and significantly better than they remembered objects learned recently. These results show that the hippocampal formation is required for memory storage for only a limited period of time after learning. As time passes, its role in memory diminishes, and a more permanent memory gradually develops independently of the hippocampal formation, probably in neocortex."
https://openalex.org/W1975495422,"To understand why proteins adopt particular three-dimensional structures, it is important to elucidate the hierarchy of interactions that stabilize the native state. Proteins in partly folded states can be used to dissect protein organizational hierarchies. A partly folded apomyoglobin intermediate has now been characterized structurally by trapping slowly exchanging peptide NH protons and analyzing them by two-dimensional 1H-NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance). Protons in the A, G, and H helix regions are protected from exchange, while protons in the B and E helix regions exchange freely. On the basis of these results and the three-dimensional structure of native myoglobin, a structural model is presented for the partly folded intermediate in which a compact subdomain retains structure while the remainder of the protein is essentially unfolded."
https://openalex.org/W1974839297,"Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL; FAB M3) is characterized by a predominance of malignant promyelocytes that carry a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 15 and 17, t(15;17)(q22;q11.2-q12). This translocation has become diagnostic for APL, as it is present in almost 100 percent of cases. A Not I linking clone was used to detect this translocation initially on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and subsequently with conventional Southern (DNA) analysis. The breakpoints in ten APL cases examined were shown to cluster in a 12-kb region of chromosome 17, containing two CpG-rich islands. The region is the first intron of the retinoic acid receptor Î± gene (RARA)."
https://openalex.org/W2067871613,"Radiation hybrid (RH) mapping, a somatic cell genetic technique, was developed as a general approach for constructing long-range maps of mammalian chromosomes. This statistical method depends on x-ray breakage of chromosomes to determine the distances between DNA markers, as well as their order on the chromosome. In addition, the method allows the relative likelihoods of alternative marker orders to be determined. The RH procedure was used to map 14 DNA probes from a region of human chromosome 21 spanning 20 megabase pairs. The map was confirmed by pulsed-field gel electrophoretic analysis. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of RH mapping for constructing high-resolution, contiguous maps of mammalian chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1978411854,"We show that mammalian and Xenopus activins induce dorsal axial mesoderm and anterior structures in explants of Xenopus blastula cells that would otherwise form epidermis. The induced explants of animal cap cells can form notochord, muscle, neural tissue, and eyes all arranged in a rudimentary axial pattern. Activin A shares inductive properties and antigenic determinants with PIF, an inducing factor recently isolated from mouse macrophage culture supernatants. Genes encoding Xenopus activin beta A and beta B chains were cloned. Activin beta B transcripts are first detected in Xenopus blastula, whereas activin beta A transcripts do not appear until the late gastrula stage. Recombinant Xenopus activin beta B protein induces mesodermal and neural tissues similar to those induced by mammalian activin A and PIF. Furthermore, ectopic expression of Xenopus activin beta B produces a second body axis in embryos injected with synthetic mRNA. Our results suggest that early induction and axial patterning are accomplished by endogenous activin B, not activin A, in Xenopus."
https://openalex.org/W2025884619,"Voltage-dependent ion channels are responsible for electrical signaling in neurons and other cells. The main classes of voltage-dependent channels (sodium-, calcium-, and potassium-selective channels) have closely related molecular structures. For one member of this superfamily, the transiently voltage-activated Shaker H4 potassium channel, specific amino acid residues have now been identified that affect channel blockade by the small ion tetraethylammonium, as well as the conduction of ions through the pore. Furthermore, variation at one of these amino acid positions among naturally occurring potassium channels may account for most of their differences in sensitivity to tetraethylammonium."
https://openalex.org/W2084208256,"Overexpression of TAR-containing sequences (TAR decoys) was used to render cells resistant to HIV replication. A chimeric tRNAmeti-TAR transcription unit contained in a double copy murine retroviral vector was used to express high levels of HIV-1 TAR-containing transcripts in CEM SS cells. Replication of HIV-1 was inhibited over 99% in cells expressing chimeric tRNA-TAR transcripts, but an amphotropic murine retrovirus replicated normally in these cells. Expression of TAR sequences in CEM SS cells had no adverse effects on cell viability, indicating that essential cellular factors are not being sequestered in these cells. TAR decoy RNA-mediated HIV inhibition may also be effective against natural HIV isolates in spite of their hypervariable nature, as suggested by the fact that replication of SIVmac was also inhibited in cells expressing HIV-1 TAR decoys."
https://openalex.org/W1970604907,"The protein encoded by the RAP1 gene of S. cerevisiae binds in vitro to a consensus sequence occurring at a number of sites in the yeast genome, including the repeated sequence C2-3A(CA)1-6 found at yeast telomeres. We present two lines of evidence for the in vivo binding of RAP1 protein at telomeres: first, RAP1 is present in telomeric chromatin and second, alterations in the level of RAP1 protein affect telomere length. The length changes seen with under- and overexpression of RAP1 are consistent with the interpretation that RAP1 binding to telomeres protects them from degradation. Unexpectedly, overproduction of the RAP1 protein was also shown to decrease greatly chromosome stability, suggesting that RAP1 mediates interactions that have a more global effect on chromosome behavior than simply protecting telomeres from degradation. Such interactions may involve telomere associations both with other telomeres and/or with structural elements of the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2004878760,"The proliferative potential of human diploid endothelial cells is finite, and cellular senescence in vitro is accompanied by the failure of the endothelial cell to respond to exogenous growth factors. Senescent human endothelial cells were shown to contain high amounts of the transcript for the cytokine interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), a potent inhibitor of endothelial cell proliferation in vitro. In contrast, transformed human endothelial cells did not contain detectable IL-1 alpha messenger RNA. Treatment of human endothelial cell populations with an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to the human IL-1 alpha transcript prevented cell senescence and extended the proliferative life-span of the cells in vitro. Removal of the IL-1 alpha antisense oligomer resulted in the generation of the senescent phenotype and loss of proliferative potential. These data suggest that human endothelial cell senescence in vitro is a dynamic process regulated by the potential intracellular activity of IL-1 alpha."
https://openalex.org/W2053049601,"Most rhythmic behaviors such as respiration, locomotion, and feeding are under the control of networks of neurons in the central nervous system known as central pattern generators (CPGs). The respiratory rhythm of the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis is a relatively simple, CPG-based behavior for which the underlying neural elements have been identified. A three-neuron network capable of generating the respiratory rhythm of this air-breathing mollusk has been reconstructed in culture. The intrinsic and network properties of this neural ensemble have been studied, and the mechanism of postinhibitory rebound excitation was found to be important for the rhythm generation. This in vitro model system enables a better understanding of the neural basis of rhythm generation."
https://openalex.org/W1993343824,"Rhodopsin is a member of a family of receptors that contain seven transmembrane helices and are coupled to G proteins. The nature of the interactions between rhodopsin mutants and the G protein, transduction (Gt), was investigated by flash photolysis in order to monitor directly Gt binding and dissociation. Three mutant opsins with alterations in their cytoplasmic loops bound 11-cis-retinal to yield pigments with native rhodopsin absorption spectra, but they failed to stimulate the guanosine triphosphatase activity of Gt. The opsin mutations included reversal of a charged pair conserved in all G protein-coupled receptors at the cytoplasmic border of the third transmembrane helix (mutant CD1), replacement of 13 amino acids in the second cytoplasmic loop (mutant CD2), and deletion of 13 amino acids from the third cytoplasmic loop (mutant EF1). Whereas mutant CD1 failed to bind Gt, mutants CD2 and EF1 showed normal Gt binding but failed to release Gt in the presence of guanosine triphosphate. Therefore, it appears that at least the second and third cytoplasmic loops of rhodopsin are required for activation of bound Gt."
https://openalex.org/W2041498658,"armadillo (arm) is one of a group of Drosophila segment polarity genes that are required for normal patterning within the embryonic segment. Although arm RNA is uniformly distributed in embryos, arm protein accumulates at higher levels in regions that contain wingless, another segment polarity gene which encodes a secreted protein that regulates patterning via cell-cell communication. These local increases in arm protein require wingless activity, and mutations that alter wingless distribution produce corresponding changes in the arm protein pattern. These results suggest that wingless regulates accumulation of arm protein by a posttranscriptional mechanism. Two other segment polarity genes, porcupine and dishevelled, are required for this effect. We also show that arm protein is closely associated with the plasma membrane in virtually all cell types and often colocalizes with F-actin."
https://openalex.org/W2031208947,"Studies of NF-kappa B suggest that this enhancer binding activity corresponds to a family of at least four proteins (p50, p55, p75, and p85) differentially induced with biphasic kinetics during T cell activation. While p55 and p50 are closely related to the 50 kd DNA binding subunit of NF-kappa B, p75 and p85 exhibit DNA binding properties that distinguish them from this 50 kd polypeptide and its regulatory subunits I kappa B and p65. All four members of this kappa B-specific protein family are structurally related to the v-Rel oncoprotein and one, p85, appears identical to human c-Rel. v-Rel, but not nontransforming v-Rel mutants, binds to the kappa B enhancer and inhibits NF-kappa B-activated transcription from the IL-2 receptor alpha promoter and HIV-1 LTR. These findings suggest a Rel-related family of kappa B enhancer binding proteins and raise the possibility that the transforming activity of v-Rel is linked to its inhibitory action on cellular genes under NF-kappa B control."
https://openalex.org/W2082015086,"The erbB2 oncogene encodes a 185-kilodalton transmembrane protein whose sequence is similar to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). A 30-kilodalton factor (gp30) secreted from MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells was shown to be a ligand for p185erbB2. An antibody to EGFR abolished the tyrosine phosphorylation induced by EGF and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) but only partially blocked that produced by gp30 in SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells. In two cell lines that overexpress erbB2 but do not expresss EGFR (MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells and a Chinese hamster ovary cell line that had been transfected with erbB2), phosphorylation of p185erbB2 was induced only by gp30. The gp30 specifically inhibited the growth of cells that overexpressed p185erbB2. An antibody to EGFR had no effect on the inhibition of SK-BR-3 cell colony formation obtained with gp30. Thus, it appeared that gp30 interacted directly with the EGFR and erbB2. Direct binding of gp30 to p185erbB2 was confirmed by binding competition experiments, where gp30 was found to displace the p185erbB2 binding of a specific antibody to p185erbB2. The evidence described here suggests that gp30 is a ligand for p185erbB2."
https://openalex.org/W2060413384,"Cell proliferation during successive stages of oligodendrocyte development was delineated in the rat brain and optic nerve. Surface antigens, A2B5, O4, and galactocerebroside (GalC) identified three cell populations emerging in sequence; the incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine into newly synthesized DNA identified the proliferative cells. In vivo, progenitor cells with phenotypes A2B5+O4- and A2B5+O4+GalC- were both proliferative, whereas differentiated GalC+ oligodendrocytes were not. Under basal conditions of culture, the proliferation of both progenitor cell types of the optic nerve was nearly abolished. Activity was restored for A2B5+O4- precursor cells with medium conditioned by either type-1 astrocytes, meningeal cells, or cerebellar interneurons. In contrast, intermediate O4+GalC- cells (proligodendrocytes) were refractory to the astroglial and meningeal signals, but remained as responsive as their precursor cells to the neuronal stimulus. These data further characterize the O4+GalC- proligodendrocyte as a distinct developmental stage, one that specifies a changing response of the cell to environmental mitogens."
https://openalex.org/W2035516686,Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus 1 is a potent trans-activator of viral gene expression. We show that purified Tat protein stimulates transcription from viral promoters greater than 10-fold in vitro. A Tat protein mutant that does not trans-activate in vivo did not stimulate transcription in vitro. Tat trans-activation required a functional TAR RNA sequence; trans-activation was competed by the addition of in vitro synthesized wild-type TAR RNA but not by mutant TAR RNAs. That Tat protein directly interacts with the TAR RNA during trans-activation in vitro was suggested by competition with Tat peptides. Preliminary evidence suggests the involvement of a cellular factor in recognition of TAR RNA during Tat trans-activation. Analysis of Tat trans-activation in vitro will provide new mechanistic insights into this process and allow a more detailed study of the relationship between Tat protein structure and function.
https://openalex.org/W2004468088,"The intracellular fate of T cell antigen receptor (TCR) subunits (Î±Î²Î³Î´ÏµÎ¾2) is determined by their assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To study the structural bases for this tight correlation between assembly and intracellular fate, we sought to define the nature of determinants for both ER degradation and subunit assembly within the TCR-Î± chain. We found that a 9 amino acid transmembrane sequence of the TCR-Î± chain, containing 2 critical charged residues, was sufficient to cause ER degradation when placed in the context of the Tac antigen, used here as a reporter protein. CD3-Î´ assembled with chimeric proteins containing this short transmembrane sequence, and this assembly resulted in abrogation of targeting for ER degradation. Thus, the colocalization of determinants for ER degradation and sites of subunit interactions explains how the fate of some newly synthesized TCR chains can be decided on the basis of their assembly status."
https://openalex.org/W1998543370,"In its wild-type form, the protein p53 can interfere with neoplastic processes. Tumor-derived cells often express mutant p53. Full-length mutant forms of p53 isolated so far from transformed mouse cells exhibit three common properties in vitro: loss of transformation-suppressing activity, gain of pronounced transforming potential, and ability to bind the heat shock protein cognate hsc70. A tumor-derived mouse p53 variant is now described, whose site of mutation corresponds to a hot spot for p53 in human tumors. While absolutely nonsuppressing, it is only weakly transforming and exhibits no detectable hsc70 binding. The data suggest that the ability of a p53 mutant to bind endogenous p53 is not the sole determinant of its oncogenic potential. The data also support the existence of gain-of-function p53 mutants."
https://openalex.org/W2027802649,"Methodology has been developed that enables virtually complete purification and abundant recovery of early hematopoietic progenitors from normal human adult peripheral blood. A fraction of the pure progenitors is multipotent (generates mixed colonies) and exhibits self-renewal capacity (gives rise to blast cell colonies). This methodology provides a fundamental tool for basic and clinical studies on hematopoiesis. Optimal in vitro cloning of virtually pure progenitors requires not only the stimulatory effect of interleukin-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and erythropoietin, but also the permissive action of basic fibroblast growth factor. These findings suggest a regulatory role for this growth factor in early hematopoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W2067984601,"A general strategy for cloning and mapping large regions of human DNA with yeast artificial chromosomes (YAC's) is described. It relies on the use of the polymerase chain reaction to detect DNA landmarks called sequence-tagged sites (STS's) within YAC clones. The method was applied to the region of human chromosome 7 containing the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene. Thirty YAC clones from this region were analyzed, and a contig map that spans more than 1,500,000 base pairs was assembled. Individual YAC's as large as 790 kilobase pairs and containing the entire CF gene were constructed in vivo by meiotic recombination in yeast between pairs of overlapping YAC's."
https://openalex.org/W1562062833,"Whereas there is biological evidence that the reductive cleavage of disulfide bonds is critical for the activation of endocytosed macromolecules such as toxins, immunotoxins, and other drug carriers, virtually nothing is known about the specifics of this cleavage. To study this process, a model compound was synthesized in which a radioiodinated tyramine was linked through a disulfide bond to an undegradable carrier, poly(D-lysine), known to be efficiently endocytosed. Cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells were pulse-labeled with this probe, and the disulfide cleavage was measured as released acid-soluble radioactivity at different times of chase. Pulse-labeled cells were also subjected to subcellular fractionation to identify intracellular structures associated with disulfide cleavage. Cleavage began without lag, amounted to about approximately 7% of the initial cell-bound radioactivity in the first hour and continued for more than 6 h. It was abolished in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide. When sulfhydryl groups present at the cell surface were blocked with cell-impermeant sulfhydryl reagent, the initial phase of disulfide cleavage was inhibited, indicating that cleavage began at the cell surface. A long-lasting intracellular phase of disulfide cleavage began after about approximately 30 min of chase. Subcellular fractionation and kinetic analysis indicated that neither lysosomes nor endosomes were participating in that phase, leaving the Golgi apparatus as the most probable site of endocytic disulfide cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W2087994184,"We have monitored cytosolic [Ca2+] with fura-2 and exocytosis by measuring the membrane capacitance, and we have studied the influence of cytosolic [Ca2+] on secretion in single endocrine cells. As in neurons, cytosolic Ca2+ is sufficient to trigger exocytosis. The rate of secretion grows with the fourth or fifth power of cytosolic [Ca2+], and paired stimuli reveal facilitation. Ca2+ influx through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels can stimulate secretion 1000-fold over the basal levels measured biochemically. Unlike neurons, however, melanotrophs continue to secrete for seconds afer a depolarizing pulse, while they extrude or sequester the Ca2+ that has entered through Ca2+ channels. Following episodes of secretion, pituitary cells can retrieve membrane with half-times around 30 s at 32 degrees C, even in the absence of cytosolic K+."
https://openalex.org/W2032496144,"We show that PIF/activin can induce the formation of axial structures including a full-length notochord, segmented somites, and a neural tube in isolated epiblasts from chick blastulae. Using degenerate PCR primers, we have cloned a fragment of the activin beta B chain from chick hypoblast cDNA, and a fragment of the activin beta A chain from chick genomic DNA. Furthermore, we show that in the chick, activin is transcribed precisely when axial mesoderm is being induced. Since exogenous PIF/activin can induce the formation of axial structures and since activin beta B is transcribed at the time and place where the mesodermal axial structures are being induced, we propose that in the chick, activin B is the endogenous inducer of the body axis."
https://openalex.org/W2068199526,"We propose that integrins help to coordinate the differentiation of the internal, sarcomeric cytoarchitecture of a muscle fiber with its immediate environment and are essential for correct integration of muscle cells into tissue. We found that integrin alpha PS2 beta PS accumulated at contact regions of Drosophila embryo cells cultured in D-22 medium on Drosophila laminin. Myotubes formed, but subsequent addition of serum or fibronectin was needed for sarcomere formation: integrin and actin became concentrated at Z-bands; myosin and actin occurred between the Z-bands. This change failed to occur in the multinucleate myotubes derived from integrin beta PS null myospheroid mutants. In normal embryos/early larvae, integrin was located at Z-bands and at muscle insertions. Myogenesis and Z-bands were defective in myospheroid embryos. Attachment, spreading, and growth of myoblasts and neurons on the laminin substrate utilized different binding proteins and were independent of integrin."

https://openalex.org/W1977517182,"Integrins mediate neuronal process outgrowth on components of the ECM. Integrin alpha subunit-specific antibodies have been used to examine the roles of individual beta 1 integrins in attachment and neurite outgrowth by the neuronal cell line, PC12, in response to laminin and collagen. alpha 1 beta 1 and alpha 3 beta 1 were identified as the major beta 1 integrins expressed by PC12 cells. In functional assays, both alpha 1 beta 1 and alpha 3 beta 1 mediated PC12 cell interactions with laminin, whereas alpha 1 beta 1 alone mediated responses to collagen types I and IV. alpha 1 beta 1 and alpha 3 beta 1 were shown to recognize two different neurite-promoting sites in laminin: alpha 1 beta 1 interacted with the cross-region of laminin present in proteolytic fragments E1-4 and E1; alpha 3 beta 1 recognized a site in the long arm contained in laminin fragment E8. Thus, PC12 cells express two beta 1 integrins, which together function in attachment and neurite outgrowth on laminin and collagen. These integrins are candidates for mediating neurite outgrowth of sympathetic and other neurons in response to these ECM components."
https://openalex.org/W2036842859,"The functional competence of extrageniculate visual pathways in hemianopic humans was demonstrated by showing that distractor signals in the blind half of the visual field could inhibit saccades toward targets in the intact visual field. This inhibitory effect of unseen distractors in patients occurred only when distractors were presented in the temporal half of the visual field, was specific to oculomotor responses, and did not occur in normal subjects. These results show that a peripheral visual signal activates retinotectal pathways to prime the oculomotor system and that these pathways can mediate orienting behavior in hemianopic humans."
https://openalex.org/W2063014213,"Of 41 wild-derived mouse strains analyzed, 14 contained T cells bearing V beta 17 receptors in spite of the concomitant expression of I-E antigens. Reciprocal F1 and F2 hybrids of one of these strains, PWK, with laboratory strains revealed different patterns of V beta 17 T cell deletions from those observed with V beta 17 T cells from SJL, implying that the two V beta 17 regions are associated with recognition of distinct superantigens. The structures of the V beta 17 alleles differ by two amino acid substitutions, which lie together in an area distant from the predicted site of T cell receptor interaction with peptide-MHC complexes but overlapping with that implicated in V beta 8.2 recognition of Mls-1 superantigen. This demonstrates that the self-superantigen leading to V beta 17 T cell deletion varies with the allele of the receptor gene and confirms that T cell deletions by such ligands involve interactions with a region of the V beta domain that is distinct from the conventional combining site."
https://openalex.org/W2093060923,"To study the functional mechanism of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) X (hbx) gene product, we have expressed the hbx protein in E. coli and purified it by HPLC. The purified hbx protein was shown to be active in transactivating transcription directed by the LTR sequence of HIV-1. The hbx protein was found to have an intrinsic serine/threonine protein kinase activity. The hbx protein was detected in hepatitis B virions, and tryptic phosphopeptide maps of the hbx protein phosphorylated in the virion and of the in vitro phosphorylated bacterially expressed hbx protein were similar. Inactivation of the hbx protein by heat, protein-denaturing agents, or an ATP affinity analog, p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl 5'-adenosine, resulted in loss of both protein kinase activity and trans-activation activity. These results suggest that the HBV-encoded trans-activator hbx is a novel protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1970215270,"Site-specific chromosome breakage occurs in many ciliated protozoa during nuclear differentiation. We have determined the cis-acting sequence that controls this process in Tetrahymena thermophila. The Tetrahymena ribosomal RNA gene is bounded by two breakage sites. Injection of this gene into developing macronuclei leads to breakage at these sites. Deletion analysis has localized the sequences essential for breakage to a 28 bp region that includes a 15 bp sequence (Cbs) known to be present in other breakage sites. Insertions of Cbs allow breakage to occur at new sites, which is accompanied by elimination of surrounding DNAs and formation of telomeric sequences, as it is at natural sites. Thus, Cbs is the necessary and sufficient sequence signal for chromosome breakage in Tetrahymena."
https://openalex.org/W2093992294,"Onchocerciasis is a major blinding disease that, until recently, has been essentially untreatable. Ivermectin is a safe and effective drug for the mass treatment of onchocerciasis and when used on an individual basis, it reduces the ability of the treated person to transmit Onchocerca volvulus infection. In the present study, the effect of community-based ivermectin treatment on the degree of transmission within the community was assessed by determining the incidence of new infection in children. Ivermectin was distributed annually on three occasions to the eligible members of a population of approximately 14,000 people living on a rubber plantation in a forest area endemic for onchocerciasis. After 2 years, the prevalence of infection in 5-year-old children decreased by 21%. The annual incidence in an uninfected cohort of children decreased by 35% and, after age-specific adjustment, the reduction in incidence in 7- to 12-year-old children was 45%. Thus, community-based distribution of ivermectin led to a significant reduction in incidence of new infection. These findings suggest that ivermectin can be important in reducing the transmission of onchocerciasis."
https://openalex.org/W1479977835,"The fnr gene product, FNR, is a global regulator of anaerobic gene expression in Escherichia coli. When E. coli is switched from aerobic to anaerobic growth conditions, cytochrome o (cyoABCDE) and d oxidase (cydAB) genes are repressed and the anaerobic terminal reductase genes, including nitrate (narGHJI), dimethyl sulfoxide/trimethylamine (dmsABC), and fumarate (frdABCD) reductase, are induced. To determine if certain amino acid residues are essential for FNR to function in this regulatory process, site-directed mutations were introduced into the fnr gene. The resulting proteins were assayed in vivo for their ability to either activate dmsA'-'lacZ and frdA'-'lacZ gene expression, or repress expression of a cyoA'-'lacZ gene fusion. The fnr mutants were grouped into four classes. Class I exhibited a severe decrease in the ability to either activate or repress fnr-dependent gene expression. Mutations in four of the five cysteine residues in the FNR protein were in this class. The sole exception was an FNR Cys16----Ser mutant that exhibited normal activity. Class II mutations caused a mild reduction in FNR-dependent activation or repression while Class III mutations conferred a modest increase in the ability of the FNR protein to activate gene expression under aerobic conditions (i.e. FNR*). Finally, Class IV mutations lowered the modest aerobic FNR transcriptional activation function proportionally more than the anaerobic FNR activity. These findings identify an essential role for the NH2 terminus of the FNR protein in its various activities in anaerobic gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2034576551,"The delayed rectifier K+ channel of the squid axon undergoes a series of modifications in its kinetic and conductive parameters when it is phosphorylated as the result of shifts in its voltage-dependent parameters. These effects can be interpreted as due to electrostatic interactions between the voltage sensor of the channel and the transferred phosphate from ATP Using different concentrations of intracellular Mg2+, we determined the density of surface charges seen by the K+ channel voltage sensor before and after phosphorylation. Values for the surface charge density in the cytoplasmic side of the membrane were between eâ/Ã2 in the absence of ATP and between eâ/Ã2 under phosphorylating conditions. Incorporation of a surface potential into a kinetic model for the delayed rectifier channel can predict quantitatively phosphorylation-like changes in K+ currents. These results provide evidence for the importance of electrostatic interactions as one of the mechanisms by which phosphorylation modulates the behavior of voltage-dependent channels."
https://openalex.org/W2074624013,"To provide a rapid, specific assay for receptor systems involved in the binding of cerebellar granule neurons to astroglia, granule cells, purified from early postnatal mice, or from E15-E16 chicks, were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine and plasma membranes were prepared. The kinetics of binding of radiolabeled material to primary mouse or chick glia or to the mouse G26-24 astrocytoma cell line was measured in the presence or absence of antibodies against astrotactin, neural cell adhesion molecules, cadherins, or integrins. Addition of Fab fragments of astrotactin antibodies reduced the amount of granule cell membrane binding to astroglia by 70%. In contrast, Fab fragments of antibodies against the neural adhesion molecules N-CAM, L1, and N-cadherin and against integrin did not reduce the level of granule cell membrane binding to astroglia. Combinations of antibodies against N-CAM, L1, N-cadherin, and integrin also did not impair neuron binding to glia."
https://openalex.org/W1541992329,"We have subjected 12 different codons of a synthetic Lactobacillus casei thymidylate synthase (TS) gene to saturation site-directed mutagenesis to create amino acid sets at each of those positions. The target residues were chosen because they are highly conserved and because they are important for the structure and function of the protein as indicated by solution and structural studies. The mutagenesis procedure involved excision of a fragment of the synthetic gene containing the target codon, followed by its replacement with a mixture of oligonucleotides which code for all 20 amino acids and the amber stop codon. TS mutants were identified by DNA sequencing, and catalytically active mutants were identified by genetic complementation using a Thy- strain of Escherichia coli. Only 3 of the 12 target amino acids examined were essential for TS activity; and of the 125 total mutants identified, 57 were catalytically active. These results point to a high degree of plasticity of TS in accommodating function with structural change."
https://openalex.org/W1970366203,"The 15-megabase pair Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the 4.7-megabase pair Escherichia coli genomes were completely cleaved at a single predetermined site by means of the Achilles' heel cleavage (AC) procedure. The symmetric lac operator (lacOs) was introduced into the circular Escherichia coli genome and into one of the 16 yeast chromosomes. Intact chromosomes from the resulting strains were prepared in agarose microbeads and methylated with Hha I (5'-GCGC) methyltransferase (M.Hha I) in the presence of lac repressor (LacI). All Hae II sites (5'-[sequence: see text]) with the exception of the one in lacOs, which was protected by LacI, were modified and thus no longer recognized by Hae II. After inactivation of M.Hha I and LacI, Hae II was used to completely cleave the chromosomes specifically at the inserted lacOs. These experiments demonstrate the feasibility of using the AC approach to efficiently extend the specificity of naturally occurring restriction enzymes and create new tools for the mapping and precise molecular dissection of multimegabase genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2076814046,"The human genome has already been the subject of extensive research activity even though the Human Genome Project is only just officially starting. This review and the accompanying wall chart attempt to provide an integrated, quantitative, and detailed summary of the status of knowledge on the human genome in mid-1990. The analysis has highlighted the rudimentary nature of many of the information links needed for the task. While this overview could not be fully comprehensive and required simplifying assumptions, the results have provided estimates of relative progress on a region-by-region basis throughout the genome."
https://openalex.org/W2148900689,It has previously been shown that a mutation of yeast 5' splice junctions at position 5 (GUAUGU) causes aberrant pre-mRNA cleavages near the correct 5' splice site. We show here that the addition of exon mutations to an aberrant cleavage site region transforms it into a functional 5' splice site both in vivo and in vitro. The aberrant mRNAs are translated in vivo. The results suggest that the highly conserved G at the 5' end of introns is necessary for the second step of splicing. Further analyses indicate that the location of the U1 snRNA-pre-mRNA pairing is not affected by the exon mutations and that the precise 5' splice site is selected independent of this pairing.

Suitable selection permitted the isolation of clones secreting abundant growth hormone in culture. When such cultures were grafted to athymic mice, human growth hormone could be detected in the blood of the mice at concentrations in the physiological range for more than 4 weeks. Retrograde transfer from epithelial cells should be studied further as a possible means of introducing exogenous gene products into the circulation of humans.â Teumer, J.; Lindahl, A.; Green, H.

https://openalex.org/W2064067326,"Recent reappraisals of the role of ionized magnesium in cell function suggest that many cells maintain intracellular free Mg2+ at low concentrations (0.1 to 0.7 mM) and that external agents can influence cell function via changes in intracellular Mg2+ concentration. Depolarization and hyperpolarization of voltage-clamped Paramecium elicited a Mg2(+)-specific current, IMg. Both Co2+ and Mn2+ were able to substitute for Mg2+ as charge carriers, but the resultant currents were reduced compared with Mg2+ currents. Intracellular free Mg2+ concentrations were estimated from the reversal potential of IMg to be about 0.39 mM. The IMg was inhibited when external Ca2+ was removed or a Ca2+ chelator was injected, suggesting that its activation was Ca2(+)-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W1969775555,"Voltage-dependent potassium currents exhibit specific time tables of functional differentiation and regulate the development of action potentials in amphibian spinal neurons. A Xenopus nucleotide sequence (XSha2) encoding a potassium current has been isolated by homology screening with the Drosophila Shaker gene. Functional expression in oocytes identifies it as a delayed rectifier. Southern analysis suggests that XSha2 is a member of a family of highly related genes. XSha2 is expressed in the nervous system but is not detectable in skeletal muscle. Transcripts are apparent at the neural fold stage, and subsequent levels parallel those of the neural marker N-CAM. Thus molecular events required for the establishment of electrical excitability in the vertebrate embryo occur early during neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2162498821,"Alopecia (hair loss) is among the most distressing side effects of cancer chemotherapy. Little progress has been made, however, in its prevention or treatment, partly because of the lack of suitable experimental model. In recent work on the treatment of myelogenous leukemia in the rat, the following observations were made: (i) treatment of 8-day-old rats with cytosine arabinoside consistently produced alopecia, and (ii) ImuVert, a biologic response modifier derived from the bacterium Serratia marcescens, uniformly produced complete protection against the alopecia. In subsequent experiments, both cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin also produced alopecia in this model, and the doxorubicin-induced alopecia was prevented by treatment with ImuVert. The potential relevance of these observations to chemotherapy-induced alopecia in the clinical setting should be examined."
https://openalex.org/W2069048955,"Drug abuse in the United States has posed a dilemma during most of this century. Intemperate use of reinforcing drugs is hazardous to health and safety, but strict prohibition fosters an illicit market with criminal effects that may be equally harmful. The crux of the problem is the willingness of millions of people to risk toxicity and arrest to gain psychopharmacological rewards. Cocaine is the present source of most concern. Recommendations for reducing demand and abuse are given, including the implementation of preventive techniques, the investigation of various treatments, the use of modern chemical and electronic technology, and the development of new pharmacological alternatives."

https://openalex.org/W1508156782,"The sarcoplasmic calcium-binding protein (SCP) of the sandworm Nereis possesses three Ca2(+)-Mg2+ sites but no Ca2(+)-specific site. Binding of Mg2+, but not of Ca2+, displays a marked positive cooperativity. The apparent cooperativity of Ca2+ binding in the presence of Mg2+ results from the allostery in Mg2+ dissociation. Binding of the first Ca2+ or Mg2+ induces all the conformational change, monitored by Trp fluorescence. In displacement reactions the conformational changes occur in the step SCP.Mg3----SCP.Ca1Mg2. Stopped-flow experiments indicate that Trp fluorescence changes upon Ca2(+)-binding are instantaneous whereas Mg2(+)-binding involves a fast pre-equilibrium (Keq = 28 M-1), followed by two slow consecutive conformational changes with k1 = 13.5 s-1 and k2 = 0.21 s-1. The fluorescence change after dissociation of Ca2+ from SCP is monophasic with k = 0.02 s-1; that after Mg2+ dissociation is biphasic with k1 = 0.8 s-1 and k2 = 0.1 s-1. Trp life time measurements also indicate that Ca2(+)- and Mg2(+)-induced conformational changes are completely different. Displacement of bound Ca2+ by Mg2+ can be described by two consecutive reactions in which the first (without fluorescence change) corresponds to the dissociation of the last Ca2+ (k1 = 2.4 s-1) and the second (k2 = 0.45 s-1) to the final conformational change observed upon direct Mg2+ binding. Displacement of bound Mg2+ by Ca2+ follows the kinetic scheme of simple competition; the conformational rate constant approaches asymptotically (up to the limit of 129 s-1) the dissociation rate of Mg2+ as the concentration of Ca2+ increases. In summary, after fast dissociation of Ca2+ or Mg2+, Nereis SCP slowly converts to the metal-free configuration, but in Ca2(+)-Mg2+ exchange reactions, the conformational changes are nearly as fast as the cation dissociation reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1567234421,"In order to study the conformational changes associated with formation of the stable ternary complex of myosin subfragment-1 (S-1) with ADP and orthovanadate (Vi), S-1 was fluorescently labeled with 9-anthroylnitrile, 4-fluoro-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole, and 5-(iodoacetamido) fluorescein at the 23-, 50-, and 20-kDa peptide segments of S-1, respectively (Hiratsuka, T. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 18188-18194; Hiratsuka, T. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 7294-7299; Takashi, R. (1979) Biochemistry 18, 5164-5169). The extrinsic fluorescence of these S-1 derivatives was sensitive not only to binding of ADP but to formation of the stable ternary complex with ADP and Vi. By using these fluorescent properties, the kinetics of formation of the stable ternary complexes of these S-1 derivatives with ADP and Vi, M. ADP.Vi, were analyzed according to the scheme proposed by Goodno (Goodno, C. C. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 76, 2620-2624). [Formula; see text] The values obtained for KVi )0.2-0.4 mM) and k (0.03-0.05 s-1) of these S-1 derivatives were similar regardless of the peptide segments of S-1 where the fluorophore had been covalently labeled. These results suggest that the conformational changes, which are induced by formation of the stable ternary complex of S-1 with ADP and Vi, are transmitted to all three peptide segments of S-1 at a similar rate. The present results also encourage us to confirm that the ATPase site of S-1 resides at or near the region where all three peptide segments of S-1 are contiguous."
